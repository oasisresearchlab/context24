To investigate the mechanisms behind network remodeling , we created a stochastic model with polymerization , depolymerization , branching , capping , uncapping , severing , oligomer diﬀusion , annealing , and debranching . We ﬁnd that ﬁlament severing , enhanced near barbed ends , can explain the single molecule actin lifetime distribution , if oligomer fragments reanneal to free ends with rate constants comparable to in vitro measurements . The same mechanism leads to actin networks consistent with measured ﬁlament , end , and branch concentrations . These networks undergo structural remodeling , leading to longer ﬁlaments away from the leading edge , at the + / - 35 𝑜 orientation pattern . Imaging of actin speckle lifetimes at sub - second resolution veriﬁes frequent disassembly of newly - assembled actin . We thus propose a uniﬁed mechanism that ﬁts a diverse set of basic lamellipodia phenomenology . INTRODUCTION The force for lamellipodial protrusions is provided by a dendritic network of actin ﬁlaments . This dynamic structure is driven by actin ﬁlament polymerization , branch generation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and regulation of ﬁlament elongation by capping protein ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Watanabe , 2010 ) . Activated by nucleation promoting factors on the cell membrane , the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates ﬁlament branches at an angle of approximately 70 ◦ from ﬁlaments that reach the leading edge . These elongating barbed ends add actin monomers from the cytoplasm to push against the cell membrane and generate force for membrane extension or for the retrograde ﬂow of the whole dendritic actin network towards the cell center . This dendritic lamellipodia network structure , evident in electron micrographs of keratocytes ( Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) has been quantiﬁed by more recent electron tomograms near the leading edge , revealing the number of barbed ends , branches and ﬁlaments ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . Its characteristic pattern with ﬁlaments orientated primarily at ± 35 ◦ with respect to the protrusion axis ( Koseki et al . , 2019 ; Maly and Borisy , 2002 ; Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Schaub et al . , 2007 ) has been interpreted by two dimensional dendritic network models ( Atilgan et al . , 2005 ; Holz and Vavylonis , 2018 ; Maly and Borisy , 2002 ; Schaus et al . , 2007 ; Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) . In parallel to polymerization and branching at the leading edge , lamellipodia maintain their steady state through continuous disassembly and recycling of actin ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Watanabe , 2010 ) . Extensive biochemical and biophysical studies have identiﬁed critical aspects of the kinetics and thermodynamics of this turnover process , with coﬁlin and hydrolysis of ATP bound to actin after polymerization , followed by P 𝑖 release , playing a central role . However the precise molecular mechanisms of actin turnover in cells have not been fully resolved ( Carlier and Shekhar , 2017 ; Carlsson , 2010 ; Danuser and Waterman - Storer , 2006 ) . Single - Molecule Speckle ( SiMS ) microscopy of ﬂuorescently labeled actin revealed that actin assembly into the dendritic network is transient and not limited to the leading edge ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) . In these SiMS experiments , actin subunits incorporated into the actin network appear as single molecule speckles while diﬀuse actin contributes to background ﬂuorescence . In the lamellipodium , speckle disappearances occur within a few seconds after speckle appearances , a time which is relatively short compared to the time required for actin treadmilling through the entire lamellipodium . Since ﬁlament treadmilling cannot explain these dynamics , Miyoshi and Watanabe proposed the hypothesis of frequent ﬁlament severing near barbed ends , following by annealing of the oligomeric fragment ( Miyoshi and Watanabe , 2013 ) . 1 Holz et al . Consistent with the frequent severing near ends and annealing hypothesis , in vitro experiments show dissociation of ﬁlament fragments from ends of actin ﬁlaments in vitro , in the presence of coﬁlin and co - factors ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Kueh et al . , 2008 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ; Shekhar and Carlier , 2017 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . End - to - end annealing of actin ﬁlaments is also well - established in vitro ( Andrianantoandro et al . , 2001 ; Popp et al . , 2007 ; Sept et al . , 1999 ) . Cellular factors such as coﬁlin and Aip1 may indeed allow ﬁlament annealing to the barbed end after severing while also restricting it from resuming elongation ( Okada et al . , 2002 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . Additionally , an independent - particle Monte Carlo model based on actin SiMS data used to model FRAP of actin in lamellipodia ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) , as well as actin monomer photoactivation experiments ( Vitriol et al . , 2015 ) , provided better ﬁts with local recycling of slowly diﬀusing actin back into the network throughout the lamellipodium . A large fraction of slowly - diﬀusing oligomers were indeed observed in fragments of keratocyte lamellipodia ( Aroush et al . , 2017 ) , however the model developed by these authors did not consider or require the presence of a local recycling mechanism . Distributed turnover through severing and annealing may relate to another puzzle of lamellipodia structure revealed in electron micrographs ( Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) : while a dense branched brushwork of ﬁlaments is observed near the leading edge ( approximately within 1 𝜇 m ) , further away from the leading edge ( approximately 3 - 4 𝜇 m away ) , ﬁlaments are longer and appear more linear . The mechanism required for this remodeling has yet to be determined . To test the hypothesis of frequent severing and annealing in distributed turnover and structural remodeling of the actin network , we created a three - dimensional kinetic model of a steady - state lamellipodium based on the dendritic nucleation model . To develop a network with the observed ± 35 ◦ ﬁlament orientation pattern , we systematically examined the self - organizing ﬁlament orientation pattern as a function of the relative network growth speed . Using parameter sets matching lamellipodia of the widely studied keratocyte or XTC cell types , we perform a search over parameters describing uniform severing along the actin ﬁlament and enhanced severing near barbed ends . The model considers the diﬀusion and annealing of severed oligomers . We ﬁnd that a model without annealing cannot reproduce both the ﬁlamentous lamellipodial structure and actin SiMS data . With the addition of oligomer diﬀusion , annealing and enhanced severing near barbed ends , the structure , SiMS data , and overall increase in ﬁlament length with distance from the leading edge can be reproduced for optimized parameters . We support this mechanism by performing SiMS of Dylight - labeled actin on XTC cells indicating frequent disassembly of recently polymerized F - actin close to the leading edge . Our study thus supports that frequent severing and annealing is an important mechanism in cellular actin dynamics , motivating further experimental investigations . RESULTS Stochastic simulation of dendritic network The model shown in Fig . 1 includes barbed end polymerization , pointed end depolymerization , capping , uncapping , branching near the leading edge , debranching , severing and annealing , without explicitly considering ATP hydrolysis or phosphate release ( see Methods and Table 1 ) . We impose a constant network velocity 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 with respect to the leading edge . We selected parameters corresponding to two frequently - studied cell systems , one for fast moving keratocyte cells and one for XTC or ﬁbroblast cells . For keratocytes , 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 corresponds to the rate of cell protrusion , since the actin network is almost stationary with respect to the substrate in experiments ( Keren et al . , 2008 ; Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Schaub et al . , 2007 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) . Lamellipodia of XTC cells are frequently studied in cells that do not crawl on the substrate , so 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 provides the magnitude of the retrograde ﬂow speed ( Ryan et al . , 2012 ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . We considered uniform severing with rate constant 𝑘 𝑢𝑛𝑖 𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑣 per ﬁlament length and enhanced end severing with a rate per ﬁlament 𝑘 𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑒𝑣 near the barbed end . If an oligomer is created from one of these severing events , we assume it can diﬀuse and anneal to a nearby ﬁlament end with rate constant 𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 . Planar branching along lamellipodial plane sharpens the ﬁlament orientation pattern Prior models of dendritic networks demonstrated how the ± 35 ◦ orientation with respect to the direction of protrusion depends on the relationship between ﬁlament elongation velocity 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 and relative extension rate 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 . As shown in the results of the 2D model by Weichsel and Schwarz ( Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) in Fig . 2A , for low 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , the dominant orientation pattern has ﬁlaments branching at − 70 ◦ / 0 / 70 ◦ . Filaments oriented at angles larger than 𝜃 𝑐 , for which cos ( 𝜃 𝑐 ) = 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , lose contact with the membrane since they are not polymerizing quick enough to catch up . When this critical angle becomes smaller than 70 ◦ , the favored pattern is ﬁlaments with orientations centered at ± 35 ◦ : the ﬁlament population around 35 ◦ can generate daughter branches at − 35 ◦ and vice versa ; thus the population sustains itself even as individual ﬁlaments get capped . The − 70 ◦ / 0 / 70 ◦ was found to resume when 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 exceeds the critical angle for 35 ◦ ; in this situation , only the 0 ◦ ﬁlaments polymerize quick enough to remain in the branching region . The above behavior can be quantiﬁed by the orientation order parameter , where a value 1 ( or - 1 ) indicates all ﬁlaments are in a - 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ ( or ± 35 ◦ ) pattern . By contrast to the above 2D results , dendritic network models formulated in 3D have provided apparently contradictory 2 A C 0 µm 3 µm Branching region x y z 0 . 2 µm Leading edge 0 . 027 µm v net k br k cap k debr k sev D olig k anneal k uncap Free barbed end Free pointed end v pol k sev unif end i ii iii iv B 1 μ m or longer at lead . edge v depol capped branch Figure 1 : Three - dimensional model of the lamellipodial actin network .

( iii ) Branching at 70 ◦ occurs along a ﬁlament segment within the branching region . ( iv ) Severing occurs with uniform rate or with a rate enhanced close to barbed ends . If severing results in a fragment of length smaller than 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 , the oligomer fragment is assumed to undergo diﬀusion with diﬀusion coeﬃcient 𝐷 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔 ( not simulated explicitly ) . The diﬀusing oligomer can anneal to a nearby free barbed , or pointed end if the oligomer is uncapped . ( C ) Snapshot of a simulation .

( Atilgan et al . , 2005 ) reported that obtaining the ± 35 ◦ pattern requires restricting branching to occur primarily along the lamellipodium plane , which they attributed to structural constraints of the branching machinery at the leading edge . Schreiber et al . ( Schreiber et al . , 2010 ) and Hu and Papoian ( Hu and Papoian , 2010 ) however did observe the ± 35 ◦ pattern in 3D simulations , but the role of 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 in determining the pattern was not examined . As we are interested in structural aspects of lamellipodia , we performed systematic simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine the ﬁlament orientation pattern as function of 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 . In the simulations of Fig . 2 we consider the region close to the leading edge where severing , annealing and debranching does not inﬂuence the resulting structure , and varied the polymerization rate while keeping 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 constant . We also kept the capping and branching rates 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 and 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 ﬁxed as the orientation pattern is robust with respect to their values ( Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) . We reproduce the results of Weichsel and Schwarz’s 2D simulations ( Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) as a function of relative network growth speed , by imposing a tight planar branch restriction along the lamellipodial 𝑥𝑦 plane ( Fig . 2A ) . Note that the transition among diﬀerent orientation patterns is not abrupt at the critical angles , as a result of allowing ﬂuctuations in branching angle and a ﬁnite size of the branching region . This is the reason for the largest diﬀerence occurring at high 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 : because only ﬁlaments at small angles can keep up with the leading edge under these conditions , our simulation evolves to a narrow 3 Holz et al . - 1 - 0 . 8 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 A v e r a g e A n g l e O r d e r P a r a m e t e r Relative network growth speed ( v _ nw / v _ fil ) No restriction , no kinking No restiction , kinking 10 degree restriction , no kinking 10 degree restriction , kinking C B 0 µm 0 µm v net / v pol = 0 . 19 D O r i e n t a t i o n o r d e r p a r a m e t e r O r i e n t a t i o n o r d e r p a r a m e t e r With backward branching No backward branching Weichsel and Schwarz 1 µm 0 µm 1 µm 0 µm 1 µm Uniform 3D branching Uniform 3D branching Branching within 10 o of lamellipodium plane Branching within 10 o of lamellipodium plane Unif . 3D branching Unif . 3D branching + Kinking Branch 10 o of lamell .

( A ) Orientation order parameter as a function of relative network growth speed , 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 in a simulation where branching always occurs along the lamellipodium plane ( within 1 ◦ ) . Numerical data with or without backward branching are compared to numerical results in 2D without backward branching from Fig . S1A in Weichsel and Schwarz ( Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) . For the plots , 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 0 . 05 𝜇 m / s was constant and 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 was varied . An orientation order parameter equal to 1 indicates a network with all ﬁlaments in the − 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ orientation , while - 1 indicates the ± 35 ◦ orientation . Vertical dashed lines indicate the critical 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 for ﬁlaments at 70 ◦ and 35 ◦ along the lamellipodium plane . ( B ) Same as panel A but for a 3D simulation in which 70 ◦ branching occurs at random orientation or uniformly within 10 ◦ of the lamellipodium 𝑥𝑦 plane , without backward branching . The ﬁlament orientation is calculated from the ﬁlament projection along the 𝑥𝑦 lamellipodium plane . Uniform branching leads to a less ordered network , even when kinking of ﬁlaments hitting a boundary is implemented . ( C ) Top : 3D simulation snapshots , colored by orientation pattern , for 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 = 0 . 19 ( no kinking ) . Bottom : orientation distribution of ﬁlaments with a portion located within 1 𝜇 m of the leading edge , average of 5 simulations reaching steady state . Restricting branching along the lamellipodium plane sharpens the − 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ orientation pattern . ( D ) Same as panel C , for for 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 = 0 . 6 ( no kinking ) , showing that restricting branching along the lamellipodium plane sharpens the ± 35 ◦ orientation pattern . Parameters are as listed in Table 1 ( keratocyte parameter set ) with 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 = 10 − 5 sub / s , but with no oligomer annealing or enhanced end severing : 𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 = 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 = 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 0 . comet - like branching structure where all branching is concentrated ; this allows branching among ± 35 ◦ and other orientations ( e . g − 80 ◦ / − 10 ◦ / 60 ◦ ) to be maintained through double branching before ﬁlaments exit the branching region . There is little diﬀerence in the orientation order parameter between simulations that allow backward branching ( angles greater than 80 ◦ , chosen to include angles that would be oriented away from the leading edge considering the variation of branching angle for both orientation patterns ) and branching limited toward the leading edge ( Fig . 2A ) . Filaments that branch 4 backward exit the branching region quicker than ﬁlaments that branched forward , decreasing the likelihood of branches oﬀ of backward ﬁlaments . Even though backward - facing ﬁlaments contribute to angles larger than 80 ◦ , they do not inﬂuence the order parameter that does not measure them . Since backward branching does not aﬀect the ﬁlament orientation pattern , and since backward - facing ﬁlaments are not seen in electron microscopy images ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) , backward branching was not allowed in the rest of our simulations . Next we allowed branching to occur uniformly in 3D ( i . e . with equal probability along any azimuthal angle with respect to the axis of the parent ﬁlament ) and studied the orientation order parameter as function of 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 / 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 ( Fig . 2B ) . The order parameter was measured using the angles of ﬁlaments projected along the lamellipodial 𝑥𝑦 plane . Uniform branching led to low and weakly - varying order parameter , unlike the sharp orientation pattern with distinct transitions observed in 2D . By comparison , a quasi - 2D simulation with branching allowed to occur within 10 ◦ oﬀ the lamellipodial plane ( close to the maximum oﬀ - plane angles observed in electron microscopy ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) ( A . Narita , personal communication , March 2018 ) restored the behavior observed in 2D . In the simulations described so far , ﬁlament elongation was assumed to stop when the polymerizing barbed end reached the top or bottom 𝑧 plane . To investigate the inﬂuence of ﬁlament bending along the membrane , we also performed simulations with ﬁlament “kinking , ” in which ﬁlaments were allowed to continue their elongation parallel to the plane representing the top or bottom cell membrane . Allowing kinking lead to a high concentration of ﬁlaments along the top and bottom plane of the lamellipodium but did not however signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the orientation order parameter ( Fig . 2B ) . To further visualize the network structure in simulations , Fig . 2C , D ( and Fig . S1 for the case with kinking ) show snapshots and ﬁlament orientation patterns at low and intermediate values of relative network growth speeds . The simulations with quasi - 2D branching show clear - 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ and ± 35 ◦ respective orientation patterns . Interestingly , even though no prominent features are observed in simulations with uniform 3D branching at low relative network speeds ( Fig . 2C ) , intermediate relative network speeds do show features at ± 35 ◦ ( Fig . 2D ) . The latter histogram is not very diﬀerent from experimentally - measured distributions ( Koseki et al . , 2019 ; Maly and Borisy , 2002 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . We thus conclude that the ± 35 ◦ pattern does occur within a broad range of relative network growth speeds with uniform 3D branching , however the peaks at ± 35 ◦ are not very pronounced . Indeed , the parameters used by Atilgan et al . ( Atilgan et al . , 2005 ) corresponded to 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 0 . 26 − 0 . 46 , a parameter set that mostly lies outside the ± 35 ◦ region ; this is likely the reason why the ± 35 ◦ was not observed in this study . Our results also suggest why Schreiber ( Schreiber et al . , 2010 ) who used 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 ≈ 0 . 37 and Hu and Papoian ( Hu and Papoian , 2010 ) who had 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 0 . 45 − 0 . 51 , did observe a ± 35 ◦ with uniform 3D branching . Considering the simulation results as well as experimental evidence in electron tomograms for ﬁlaments oriented primarily along the lamellipodial plane ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) , for the rest of the simulations we proceed with the quasi - 2D case where ﬁlament branching occurs within 10 ◦ of the lamellipodial plane and relative network growth speeds result in a ± 35 ◦ orientation pattern . Estimated Parameters For both cases of keratocytes and XTC cells , which correspond to diﬀerent values for 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 , we estimated the rates of polymerizing barbed end elongation 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , branching 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 , and capping 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 , that are needed for a dendritic network with the anticipated concentration , branch length , and ± 35 ◦ ﬁlament orientation pattern ( Table 1 ) . We also assume that barbed ends can uncap with rates comparable to those in SiMS lifetime measurements of capping protein ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ) . The availability of such uncapped barbed ends for annealing is an important assumption of this work . We further use debranching rates by considering the lifetime of Arp2 / 3 complex components in SiMS ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ) and measurements of Arp2 / 3 complex proﬁles in lamellipodia ( Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ; Lai et al . , 2008 ; Ryan et al . , 2012 ) . We also assumed that uncapped barbed ends away from the leading edge do not elongate or shrink and that free pointed ends depolymerize with a rate 𝑣 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑙 = 5 / s . The results we present below are robust with respect to small changes of these parameters , as long as the overall ﬁlament disassembly rate away from the leading edge is not reaching values comparable to 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 . Maintaining a wide lamellipodium in the latter case would require a global treadmilling mechanism , which would contradict the evidence for distributed turnover . The assumption of slow barbed end dynamics away from the leading edge is consistent with the slow intensity increase in the back of lamellipodium after FRAP of actin ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) or after photoactivation of actin at the cell middle ( Lai et al . , 2008 ; Vitriol et al . , 2015 ) , as well as evidence that coﬁlin and twinﬁlin promote both barbed and pointed end depolymerization ( Hakala et al . , 2021 ; Johnston et al . , 2015 ; Shekhar et al . , 2020 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . A steady state with a ﬁnite lamellipodium depth is reached in the simulation whenever the net rate of depolymerization balances the net rate of polymerization at the leading edge . For example , in the case without enhanced end severing , annealing , or oligomer dissociation , the depth of the lamellipodium is determined by the rates of uniform severing , 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 , and 𝑣 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑙 ( Fig . S2 ) : in this case the fast growth of barbed ends at the leading edge is balanced by the slower depolymerization of a larger 5 Holz et al .

Increasing the severing rate near the barbed end to better match the short speckle lifetime experimental peak leads to short lamellipodium .

Concentration proﬁles are the average of 5 simulations in steady state . Speckle lifetimes measured for speckles within 12 𝜇 m of the leading edge over a 20 s interval in steady state for 5 simulations . number of pointed ends created by severing . Given the parameters in Table 1 , this leaves three main unknown parameters related to oligomer dissociation : 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 , the rate of uniform severing along each ﬁlament ; 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 , the longest length of a diﬀusing oligomer ; 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 , the enhanced severing rate near the barbed end ( within 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 of the end ) . We treated these three as ﬁtting parameters and considered separately the cases in the presence or absence of annealing . In the absence of annealing , dissociating oligomers do not reincorporate into the network and are thus discarded from the simulation ( corresponding to eventual disassembly into monomers , a process that we did not simulate ) . Model without annealing cannot reproduce both actin SiMS data and lamellipodial structure We conducted a parameter search over the maximum oligomer size 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 as well as end and uniform severing rates 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 , 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 for keratocyte - and XTC - like parameters without annealing ( Fig . S3 ) . We classiﬁed each parameter set in terms of how well it described the F - actin structure and concentration ( including barbed end and branch concentration proﬁles ) , actin SiMS data ( speckle lifetime distribution , appearance and disappearance proﬁle ) , and if there was an increase in length between the 6 ﬁlaments located in 0 - 1 𝜇 m and 3 - 4 𝜇 m region ( see Methods ) . Within a range of uniform and end severing rates , and short maximum oligomer lengths , the network structure and concentration of our simulation was close to that expected for keratocyte and XTC lamellipodium ( Fig . S3 ) . However , as expected , we did not ﬁnd any parameter sets that resulted in a length increase since a mechanism for an increase in length and remodeling is not included . We also did not ﬁnd any parameter set with a sharp peak at short actin speckle lifetimes , though in some cases the actin speckle lifetime distribution has a peak at relatively short times ( Fig . S3 ) . To further demonstrate that the model without annealing cannot ﬁt the experimental data , Figs . 3 and S4 contain examples of results for keratocyte and XTC parameters . In this and subsequent ﬁgures we color parameter sets black without end severing and red that include enhanced end severing ; these curves correspond to the parameters of the scan that are highlighted with a thick frame of same color in Fig . S3 . For the case with moderate uniform severing and no end severing , both the XTC and keratocyte uniform severing cases have a concentration proﬁle that is comparable to lamellipodium of their respective parameter set ( Fig . 3 ) as well as barbed end and branch distributions ( Fig . S4 ) . However , the actin speckle lifetimes do not peak at short lifetimes . With the addition of enhanced end severing , as well as increase of uniform severing , a peak at short lifetimes is observed that is closer to the experimental SiMS curves , however the lamellipodium becomes too narrow , there is a shortage of long speckle lifetimes compared to experiment , and the location of speckle appearances is restricted close the leading edge ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S4A , F ) . In conclusion , the model without annealing cannot reproduce the distributed turnover , structure of actin network and increase in ﬁlament length . Model with oligomer annealing can reproduce lamellipodium structure , actin speckle dynamics and increase in ﬁlament length away from leading edge Next , we examined if inclusion of oligomer annealing might be able to provide an adequate ﬁt to the structure , speckle , and length increase criteria . We performed another parameter search over the maximum oligomer length , end and uniform severing rates ( 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 , 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 ) for keratocyte and XTC parameter sets . For these simulations we used an annealing rate constant measured in crowded surfaces in vitro ( Popp et al . , 2007 ) . Similar to the parameter scan without annealing , a match to F - actin structure and concentration was obtained when uniform and end severing rates were within a certain range ( Fig . S5 ) . The addition of annealing improved the agreement between the speckle lifetimes , appearance and disappearance location proﬁles compared to SiMS data , resulting in parameter sets that agree with both structure and speckle dynamics ( Fig . S5 ) . We also see that with high enough severing and maximum oligomer lengths , the ﬁlament length increases in a region away from the leading edge ( Fig . S5 ) . Parameter sets where all three ﬁtting criteria are satisﬁed exist for both keratocyte and XTC cases , and all these triple matches have a ﬁnite enhanced end severing rate . Detailed results from our parameter scan for keratocytes are shown in Fig . 4 . This ﬁgure shows a case without enhanced end severing ( black curves , double match in structure and speckles for keratocyte parameters ) and with enhanced end severing ( red , triple match in structure , speckles and ﬁlament length increase ) . Both parameter sets can reproduce the actin speckle dynamics as seen in the speckle lifetime , appearance and disappearance location distributions as well as the the structure as seen in the F - actin , barbed end , and branch concentration proﬁles ( Fig . 4A - F ) . However , only the case with enhanced end severing results in a simultaneous increase in length away from the leading edge ( Fig . 4G ) . The increase brings the ﬁlament length close to the estimated average of 800 nm in keratocytes ( Schaub et al . , 2007 ) . Snapshots and movies of the optimized simulations with enhanced end severing ( Fig . 4H and Movie S1 ) clearly show more branches and shorter ﬁlaments in the region near the leading edge than away from the leading edge , similar to the electron micrographs of Svitkina et al . ( Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . The ± 35 ◦ ﬁlament orientation pattern is preserved throughout the lamellipodium in the presence of severing and annealing . For XTC cells , enhanced end severing is needed to match the actin speckle lifetime distribution , which further contributes to ﬁlament length increase . Results from our parameter scan for XTC cells in Fig . 5 show a case without enhanced end severing ( black curves , match in structure only ) and a case with enhanced end severing ( red , triple match in structure , speckles and ﬁlament length increase ) . The case with enhanced end severing provides a good overall ﬁt to SiMS and structure ( Fig . 4A - G ) , demonstrating increase in length away from the leading edge ( Fig . 4G , H and Movie S2 ) . When performing the F - actin concentration and structure match for the XTC parameter sets we used numbers matching electron tomograms in ﬁbroblasts by Vinzenz et al . ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . These concentrations are about half of the estimated F - actin concentration of 1 , 000 𝜇 M for XTC cells ( Watanabe , 2010 ) . The branching rate in the simulations of Fig . 5 corresponds to 0 . 05 𝜇 M s − 1 , which is also about half of the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation rate of 0 . 11 𝜇 M s − 1 estimated by SiMS ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ; Watanabe , 2010 ) . We checked that simulations with doubled the branching rate still provide a good ﬁt to actin SiMS data as well as a length increase away from the leading edge , with F - actin concentration at the leading edge that was around 1 , 100 𝜇 M ( Fig . S6 ) . We also tested that excluding end severing of polymerizing ends in Figs . 4 and 5 did not modify our results for the optimized parameter sets . The optimized parameter sets with speckle dynamics similar to SiMS experiments of Fig . 4 and 5 also matched another 7 Holz et al . ) Near ) the ) leading ) edge ) Away ) from ) the ) leading ) edge ) 0 ) ) µm ) ) 4 ) ) µm ) ) A B G C H ) E 1 ) ) µm ) ) 0 ) ) µm ) ) 3 ) ) µm ) ) 4 ) ) µm ) ) D F Filament ) length ) ( nm ) Figure 4 : Model results for optimized parameters of model for keratocytes with uniform severing and annealing ( black ) or model with annealing and severing , enhanced near barbed end ( red ) . The latter case provides good agreement with SiMS data , actin network structure , and ﬁlament length increase away from the leading edge .

S7 ) . The simulations of Fig . 4 and 5 also implement a mechanism of local oligomer rebinding , which is needed to match actin FRAP and photoactivation data ( Smith and Liu , 2013 ; Vitriol et al . , 2015 ) : as shown in Fig . S7B and S7E the distance travelled by oligomers before annealing is in the sub - 𝜇 m range . As a further check of consistency of our simulations with SiMS results , simulated actin SiMS for parameters with enhanced end severing of Fig . 4 ( keratocytes ) and Fig . 5 ( XTC ) do resemble experimental images from ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2014 ) ( Movies S3 , S4 ) . In Movies S3 , S4 , when an appearing and disappearing speckle are near one another , this is typically a reannealing event occurring quickly over short distances . We conﬁrmed that events that might be limited by spatial and temporal resolution or interpreted as blinking in SiMS experiments correspond to a very small fraction of speckle appearances in the simulation . Finally , we note that even though the results of this section were obtained for a speciﬁc value of annealing rate constant and 8 NearCtheCleadingCedgeC H C 1CCµmCC 0CCµmCC 3CCµmCC 4CCµmCC G AwayCfromCtheCleadingCedgeC 0CCµmCC 4CCµmCC FilamentClengthC ( nm ) A B F D E C Figure 5 : Model results for optimized parameters of model for XTC cells with uniform severing and annealing ( black ) or model with annealing and severing , enhanced near barbed end ( red ) . The latter case provides good agreement with SiMS data and actin network structure ; it can also lead to ﬁlament length increase away from the leading edge .

( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . In panel A , the distributions were normalized between 4 - 144 s . The fraction of oligomers is less than 0 . 1 % . The simulation with uniform severing used 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 = 5 · 10 − 5 / sub / s ; 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 80 sub and with enhanced end severing 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 = 5 · 10 − 6 / sub / s ; 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 = 10 − 3 / sub / s ; 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 150 sub . Other parameters listed in Table 1 ( XTC parameters ) . oligomer diﬀusion coeﬃcient , they remain valid as long as the annealing of oligomers occurs over a suﬃciently short distance . We ﬁnd that this is the case even for annealing rate constant that are lower by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to the values of Table 1 ( Fig . S7C , S7F ) . Short speckle lifetimes provide evidence for rapid disassembly near barbed ends The speckle lifetime distribution of the models with severing and annealing of Figs . 4 - 5 characteristically peaks at 𝑡 = 0 . This is a general feature of a barbed - end disassembly mechanism where newly - polymerized monomers are the ones that disassemble at higher rates , being closer to the barbed end . The experimental SiMS lifetimes in Figs . 3 - 5 used a temporal resolution of 1 s ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) . To probe the kinetics at even shorter lifetimes , SiMS of Dylight actin was repeated on XTC cells using the methods of Yamashiro et al . ( Yamashiro et al . , 2014 ) , with a temporal resolution of 0 . 1 s . We measured actin speckles appearing near the leading edge , which should represent polymerization of actin monomers rather than oligomer annealing . Approximately 16 % and 30 % of speckles disappeared within within 0 . 5 and 1 s , respectively ( Fig . 6A ) . This large amount of short speckle lifetimes strongly supports frequent disassembly of newly polymerized F - actin near the barbed end . To compare to simulations , Fig . 6B contains speckle lifetimes within 1 𝜇 m of the leading edge for the XTC parameter set with enhanced end severing and annealing of Fig . 5 ( the uniform severing case of Fig . 5 did not provide as good a match 9 Holz et al . to SiMS measurements and is not shown ) . The speckle distribution extended to short lifetimes , similar to the experiments of Fig . 6A , with the percentage of lifetimes within 0 . 5 s and 1 s being 3 % and 7 % , respectively . Doubling the enhanced end severing rate while also choosing parameters that reproduced speckle dynamics , lamellipodial structure and an overall increase in length ( 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 = 0 ; 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 = 2 · 10 − 3 / sub / s ; 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 150 sub , XTC parameters , Table 1 ) , doubled the percentage of speckle short lifetimes within 0 . 5 s and 1 s to 7 % and 14 % , respectively , closer to the experimental percentages of Fig . 6A . We conclude the short lifetimes of Fig . 6A are within the range of what is expected by an enhanced end severing mechanism , which may even occur at a rate 2 - 4 times faster than the estimate of Fig . 5 . Kueh et al . ( Kueh et al . , 2008 ) observed that actin disassembly in lamellipodia was inhibited in the presence of cytochalasin D ( CD ) , a barbed end capper that also inhibits binding of coﬁlin to F - actin at high concentrations ( Shoji et al . , 2012 ) . We tested the eﬀect of CD treatment on XTC cells using SiMS ( Fig . 6C ) . We conﬁrmed CD’s inhibitory eﬀect on ﬁlament disassembly by observing a larger fraction of actin speckles that survive after CD treatment . These results provide further support for rapid disassembly of newly - polymerized actin at barbed ends ( either through “bursting” as proposed in Kueh et al . ( 2008 ) or enhanced severing ) . DISCUSSION We showed that the hypothesis of frequent severing and annealing ( Miyoshi and Watanabe , 2013 ) provides a mechanism for distributed turnover and structural remodeling of the actin network . Using simulations based on the dendritic nucleation model , under conditions that allow self - organization into a ± 35 ◦ ﬁlament orientation pattern , we determined values for uniform and enhanced end severing rates that can simultaneously account for a diverse set of experimental data : ( 1 ) actin SiMS measurements ( Smith et al . , 2013 ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) , ( 2 ) actin photobleaching and photoactivation experiments ( Lai et al . , 2008 ; Smith et al . , 2013 ; Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ; Vitriol et al . , 2015 ) ( since our model incorporates distributed turnover ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) ) , ( 3 ) the presence of uncapped barbed ends through the lamellipodium ( Aroush et al . , 2017 ; Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ) , and ( 4 ) the change of network structure of the lamellipodium as a function of distance to leading edge ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Additionally , our simulations are consistent with SiMS of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Millius et al . , 2012 ) and capping protein ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ; Smith et al . , 2011 ) in XTC cells . Agreement with SiMS of bound Arp2 / 3 complex lifetimes occurs because the speckle lifetimes correspond to a narrow distribution of branches as compared to the lamellipodium width ( McMillen and Vavylonis , 2016 ) , as in Fig . 5F . The model is also in agreement with SiMS measurements of capping protein lifetimes in XTC cells ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ) , which were used as input to the uncapping rate constant . This uncapping is important in the model , to allow uncapped barbed ends for annealing . The presence of slowly diﬀusing oligomers assumed in the model could also be consistent with the presence of slowly diﬀusing capping proteins in XTC cell lamellipodia ( Smith et al . , 2011 ) . For the parameters of Figs . 4 - 5 , release of capped oligomers through end severing would not contribute signiﬁcantly to capping protein SiMS lifetimes , since the corresponding rate is 4 - 8 times slower than uncapping . It is also interesting to compare our model to SiMS measurement of Aip1 in XTC cells ( Tsuji et al . , 2009 ) . Assuming that appearance of Aip1 speckles corresponds to ﬁlament disruption , the frequency of Aip1 - associated ﬁlament disruption was estimated to be 1 . 8 𝜇 M s − 1 ( Tsuji et al . , 2009 ) . We calculated the simulated overall eﬀective severing rate by counting the total number of uniform and enhanced end severing within 20 s in steady state within 5 𝜇 m from the leading edge ( average of 5 simulations ) . For the enhanced end severing XTC case in Figs . 5 and S6 , the eﬀective severing rate was 0 . 17 𝜇 M s − 1 and 0 . 32 𝜇 M s − 1 , respectively . These values are a few times smaller , yet not too far from the experimental estimate . This diﬀerence could indicate an even higher enhanced end severing rate in cells as compared to Fig . 5 , as also suggested by the comparison of experimental and simulated short actin lifetimes in Fig . 6A , B . An alternative mechanism to explain the short actin SiMS lifetimes ( diﬀerent to enhanced end severing ) is rapid disassembly through cooperative strand separation , which may occur in the presence of coﬁlin , coronin and Aip1 , depending on the cofactor concentrations ( Jansen et al . , 2015 ; Kueh et al . , 2008 ; Tang et al . , 2020 ) . If such a mechanism dominates in the region near the leading edge , maintenance of F - actin concentration would require monomer by monomer regrowth of some actin ﬁlaments by an equivalent amount . While we cannot fully exclude such a dynamic - instability - like mechanism , we note that : ( 1 ) it would require additional controls or homeostasic mechanisms to balance disassembly and reassembly away from the leading edge ( while maintenance of F - actin mass is ensured by a severing and annealing mechanism ) , ( 2 ) ATP hydrolysis associated with ATP - actin monomer polymerization would be energetically more costly , and ( 3 ) reassembly of rapidly diﬀusing monomers away from the leading edge to recover bursting would also be less consistent with FRAP or photoactivation experiments ( Smith et al . , 2013 ; Vitriol et al . , 2015 ) . Prior measurements of the intensity pattern of phalloidin - stained actin ﬁlaments in keratocytes treated with low doses of CD indicates shorter ﬁlaments compared to the control case ( Schaub et al . , 2007 ) . This ﬁlament shortening could be due to capping by CD , as suggested ( Schaub et al . , 2007 ) , however it may also be related to reduced structural remodeling of the 10 C A B 10 8 6 4 2 0 N u m b e r o f S p ec k l e s 2 . 6 2 . 1 1 . 6 1 . 1 0 . 6 0 . 1 Lifetime dsA 3 . 0 s ≥ lifetime .

( B ) Simulated actin speckle lifetime distribution for the case of enhanced end severing and annealing of XTC parameters in Fig . 5 , except that end severing was allowed to occur on any barbed end , including polymerizing ones ( which does not have any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the results of Fig . 5 , see Fig . S8 ) . The fraction of lifetimes longer than 3 s were 79 % ( the fraction becomes 86 % if we exclude end severing of polymerizing ends ) . Lifetimes were averaged over 5 independent simulations and over 20 s in steady state for speckles within 1 𝜇 m of the leading edge . ( C ) Disassembly rate of Dylight 550 actin speckles in lamellipodia of XTC cell decreased after treatment with 5 𝜇 M cytochalasin D ( CD ) . A number of speckles in a lamellipodia were identiﬁed in one reference frame , and the reduction in their numbers was followed over subsequent frames . Data are from three movies at 2 𝑠 intervals .

The increase of 𝜏 after treatment is statistically signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 03 ; paired t - test ) . lamellipodium through severing / destabilization near barbed ends . Actin ﬁlament annealing , a basic assumption of our model , has been established in vitro ( Andrianantoandro et al . , 2001 ; Sept et al . , 1999 ) , including on a crowded surface which is similar to lamellipodial conditions ( Popp et al . , 2007 ) . Our results are robust with respect to the annealing rate constant and oligomer diﬀusion coeﬃcient , which is why we did not elaborate on the precise length dependence of oligomer diﬀusion and annealing rates . Speciﬁcally , the results are valid for a range of diﬀusion coeﬃcients and annealing rate constants , as long as annealing is not dominated by reannealing to the same ﬁlament , diﬀusion is fast enough such that severing contributes to speckle disappearance in SiMS , and annealing does not occur further than approximately 1 𝜇 m from the severing location . For example , the simulations results of Figs . 4 - 5 are nearly identical when reducing 𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 by 10 times compared to the value used from Popp et al . ( 2007 ) . This is because both annealing rates are in a range that allows the oligomers to diﬀuse away from the same severed ﬁlament and large enough for annealing to remodel the 11 Holz et al . network . Future work is needed however to further investigate how diﬀusion and annealing of ﬁlament segments occurs within the dense lamellipodial actin mesh . Our simulations showed how severing and depolymerization regulate the length of the lamellipodial dendritic network ( Fig . S2 ) , similar to earlier models that have been formulated at various levels of description ( Berro et al . , 2010 ; Carlsson , 2007 ; Ditlev et al . , 2009 ; Edelstein - Keshet and Ermentrout , 2001 ; Lewalle et al . , 2014 ; Manhart et al . , 2019 ; Michalski and Carlsson , 2010 , 2011 ; Mogilner and Edelstein - Keshet , 2002 ) , including use of explicit dendritic network ( Schreiber et al . , 2010 ) . We also included annealing , a process previously studied using lattice models by Carlsson and Michalski ( Carlsson , 2007 ; Michalski and Carlsson , 2010 , 2011 ) . In their models , annealing was implemented as reappearance of lattice links and lead to a wider lamellipodium , similar to our ﬁndings . Annealing was also included in the partial diﬀerential equations model of Ditlev et al . ( Ditlev et al . , 2009 ) but the implications of this mechanism were not explicitly explored . Closer to our work is the model by Huber et al . ( Huber et al . , 2008 ) who created a detailed 2D kinetic Monte Carlo model of the keratocyte lamellipodium to calculate the ﬁlament lengths and concentration proﬁles of actin and associated proteins . The model included diﬀusion of free actin monomers , ﬁlament nucleation along predeﬁned ± 35 ◦ orientations to represent branching , permanent barbed end capping , binding of ADF / coﬁlin and tropomyosin to ﬁlaments , as well as ATP hydrolysis and P 𝑖 release . Annealing among ﬁlaments was also included , without explicit modeling of severed ﬁlament diﬀusion . With this model , two distinct network regions formed ( termed the lamellipodium and lamella in that paper ) : a region with short ﬁlaments close to the leading edge , followed by a region with longer ﬁlaments starting at about 2 𝜇 m further away . The length increase with distance from the leading edge in the model Huber et al . occurred via two diﬀerent mechanisms : ( i ) ﬁlament annealing , or ( ii ) polymerization of barbed ends away from the leading edge , created by severing ; these ends were assumed to polymerize faster than barbed ends at the leading edge , as a result of the higher G - actin concentration away from the leading edge . The annealing mechanism ( i ) of Huber et al . is diﬀerent to what we described in our work : in their study it involved the joining together of any pair of ﬁlaments at the same distance from the leading edge , without accounting of the dendritic network topology . By contrast , we assumed annealing involves diﬀusing oligomers . Their work also involved annealing rate constants that were one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the values in this work , and , as we understand , it was assumed that annealing occurred even with capped barbed ends . An annealing mechanism as in Huber et al . would not contribute to actin speckle appearances and disappearances ( that were not quantiﬁed in their paper ) and is likely inconsistent with SiMS data . However we note that the Huber et al . model did lead to a peak in actin disassembly at 1 - 2 𝜇 m away from the leading edge , similar to Fig . 4D , as well as experimental results by qFSM in other cell types ( Ponti et al . , 2004 ) . It’s also unclear if fast polymerization away from the leading edge ( mechanism ( ii ) in Huber et al . ) is consistent with data using FRAP ( Lai et al . , 2008 ; Smith et al . , 2013 ) and photoactivation ( Vitriol et al . , 2015 ) of actin in lamellipodia of other cell types . These experiments argue against incorporation of fast - diﬀusing actin at the back of the lamellipodium ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) . We also note that when we included fast polymerization of barbed ends away from the leading edge in our simulations , we typically obtained a high F - actin concentration peak away from the leading edge , unlike in the simulations of Huber et al . or in prior experiments . In a study of actin dynamics that combined experiment and modeling , Aroush et al . ( Aroush et al . , 2017 ) found evidence for the presence of a large pool of short actin oligomers in keratocyte lamellipodial fragments . Using FRAP on small regions , ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy , and phalloidin labeling , the oligomer diﬀusion coeﬃcient was estimated to be about 5 𝜇 m 2 s − 1 for oligomers with an average length of 13 subunits . Aroush et al . also report that two - thirds of actin within these fragments are diﬀuse , with oligomers composed a sizable fraction of this pool . A partial diﬀerential equation 1D model ( that included polymerizable and non - polymerizable monomers , oligomers and F - actin ) provided agreement with the data , assuming actin disassembly into oligomers throughout the lamellipodia and a broad distribution of polymerizing barbed ends . The ﬁnding of oligomers , as well as the proposed distributed F - actin turnover , is consistent with main assumptions of our work . However we note that the absence of local reassembly in the mechanism proposed by Aroush et al . may not easily explain experimental observations of actin FRAP or photoactivation over large regions of other cell types ( Smith et al . , 2013 ; Vitriol et al . , 2015 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) , or the ﬁlament length increase across the lamellipodium . We also note that other studies ( Kiuchi et al . , 2011 ; Smith et al . , 2013 ) have suggested much smaller concentrations of diﬀuse actin in lamellipodia compared to Aroush et al . , though the situation could be diﬀerent in the faster keratocytes ( Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) and their fragments . The mechanism of severing and annealing modeled in this work could represent a general feature of actin dendritic networks , including yeast cells where short actin speckle lifetimes have been observed in actin patches of ﬁssion yeast ( Lacy et al . , 2019 ) . It might provide an energetically eﬃcient mechanism for network remodeling matching diﬀerent mechanical requirements : close to the leading edge , short branched networks would provide rigidity to compressive stresses ( resulting from actin polymerization against the membrane ) while longer ﬁlaments at the back might be better suited for extensional stresses through myosin motors . Future work is however needed to clarify the biochemical basis of the proposed kinetics , taking into account the energetic requirements associated with ATP hydrolysis and Pi release along actin ﬁlaments , as well as mechanics and kinetics of actin ﬁlament side - binding proteins such as coﬁlin , GMF , and tropomyosin . 12 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank David Rutkowski for helping with network visualization .

Actin ﬁlaments are represented as straight lines without excluded volume , within the simulation box . We work in the coordinate system where the leading edge is at rest . For the purposes of this work we do not consider explicitly the eﬀects of ATP hydrolysis , diﬀusion of the actin monomer pool , or excluded volume interactions among ﬁlaments . The leading edge at 𝑦 = 0 , as well as the lamellipodium top and bottom at 𝑧 = 0 and 𝑧 = 0 . 2 𝜇 m are hard boundaries . There is no boundary at 𝑦 → −∞ , allowing the mechanisms and rate constants of the system to determine the length of the lamellipodium . Periodic boundary conditions with length at least 1 𝜇𝑚 are applied in the 𝑥 - direction . A constant relative velocity , 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 , is imposed between the network and the leading edge . The network is initialized by ﬁlament seeds of 5 subunits in length at random orientations near the leading edge . The probability of a reaction event ( polymerization , depolymerization , capping , uncapping , branching , severing and annealing ) is calculated using the corresponding rates or rate constants as described below and in Table 1 . The time step was 𝑑𝑡 = 0 . 002 s . Mechanisms Polymerization , depolymerization , capping and uncapping Free barbed ends , which are created by branching at the leading edge polymerize with rate 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 . Polymerization ( elongation ) is simulated as stochastic increase of ﬁlament length by 2 . 7 nm , corresponding to addition of one monomer , when this is allowed by the distance to the hard boundaries at 𝑧 = 0 , 𝑧 = 0 . 2 𝜇 m , or 𝑦 = 0 . We examined two diﬀerent scenarios when an elongating ﬁlament reaches 𝑧 = 0 or 𝑧 = 0 . 2 𝜇 m : ( i ) the ﬁlaments stop polymerizing , or ( ii ) undergo “kinking , ” namely they continue elongation parallel to 𝑧 = 0 or 𝑧 = 0 . 2 𝜇 m , at the same angle along the 𝑥𝑦 plane . The latter is implemented to mimic bending of ﬁlaments when they come in contact with the membrane . Capping of free barbed ends occurs at a rate 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 , which stops polymerization and does not allow annealing of oligomers . Capped barbed ends become free with uncapping rate , 𝑘 𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑝 . Free barbed ends away from the leading edge are expected to undergo diﬀerent polymerization kinetics compared to barbed end at the leading edge , where membrane bound proteins such as Ena / VASP catalyze fast elongation . Recent evidence suggests that ADF / coﬁlin and twinﬁllin may assist in the depolymerization of barbed ends away from the leading edge at a slow rate ( Hakala et al . , 2021 ; Johnston et al . , 2015 ; Shekhar et al . , 2020 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . For simplicity , and accounting for these recent observations , barbed ends formed by uncapping neither polymerize or depolymerize , still allowing however annealing of oligomers . Free pointed ends ( created by severing or debranching ) depolymerize with rate 𝑣 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑙 , implemented by stochastic length decrease by 2 . 7 nm corresponding to one monomer . Depolymerization stops when the ﬁlament completely depolymerizes or meets the qualiﬁcations for an oligomer . These mechanisms are depicted in Fig . 1B . Branching and debranching Filament branches are nucleated at a total rate 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 and placed randomly along parent ﬁlaments , in proportion to their segment length within the branching region , a 27 nm region near the leading edge ( Fig . 1A ) , approximately the size of an Arp2 / 3 complex associated to proteins on the cell membrane ( Volkmann , 2001 ) . New branches form from an existing parent ﬁlament at an angle chosen from a Gaussian distribution centered at 70 ◦ with a standard deviation of 5 ◦ ( Gong et al . , 2017 ; Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) . The azimuthal angle of the branch around the axis of the parent ﬁlament is either picked from a uniform distribution ( uniform 3D branching ) or else uniformly but with the additional condition that the angle between the branch and the lamellipodium plane is smaller than a threshold value ( typically 10 ◦ , case of branching along lamellipodium plane ) . Unless otherwise indicated , branching at angles larger than 80 ◦ with respect to the axis of protrusion ( termed “backward” branching ) is not allowed ; in cases where an invalid orientation is selected , a new branch location and orientation is tried . Debranching occurs at rate 𝑘 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑟 , which we assume results in release of the Arp2 / 3 complex , leading to a free pointed end for the debranched ﬁlament . In simulations with 𝑘 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑟 = 0 , debranching was assumed to occur for branches that become 5 monomers or smaller and do not contain branches of their own . Debranching also occurs when the pointed end of a parent ﬁlament depolymerizes past a branch . Severing We considered uniform severing with constant rate 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 per ﬁlament length , and enhanced severing near the barbed end with rate per ﬁlament length 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 ( proposed as possible explanation for the short actin lifetimes observed by SiMS ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ) ) . Enhanced end severing occurred between the barbed end and 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 , the longest length for an oligomer . In a severing event , a location on the ﬁlament is chosen to split the ﬁlament into two , creating a new depolymerizing pointed end and a free barbed end . An oligomer , assumed to be diﬀusing as discussed below , is created for any ﬁlament segment that is shorter than 19 Holz et al . 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 and is not a branch or does not contain a branch . Oligomers formed at the barbed end retain the capped or polymerization state of the original ﬁlament . To allow a network to form even at high severing rates , we assumed that no severing occurs within 0 . 1 𝜇𝑚 of the leading edge and did not apply enhanced end severing to barbed ends polymerizing at the leading edge ( unless otherwise indicated ) . The latter assumption does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on our ﬁnal results . Oligomers and Annealing Since oligomers are short and typically anneal after a short time interval , we assumed that they do not branch , sever , or depolymerize , though we implemented capping and uncapping with the same rates as ﬁlaments . We assume that the probability of ﬁnding the end of a non - annealed oligomer displaced by distance 𝛿𝑥 and 𝛿𝑦 along the 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions ( in the reference frame where the leading edge is at rest ) , after time 𝛿𝑡 , with respect to the location and time of its creation by severing , is given by 2D diﬀusion : 𝑃 𝐷 ( 𝛿𝑥 , 𝛿𝑦 , 𝛿𝑡 ) = ( 4 𝜋𝐷 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔 𝛿𝑡 ) − 1 exp [ − ( 𝛿𝑥 2 + 𝛿𝑦 2 ) / ( 4 𝐷 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔 𝛿𝑡 ) ] , where 𝐷 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔 is the oligomer diﬀusion coeﬃcient . This expression neglects the small eﬀect of advection by cytoplasmic ﬂuid ﬂow as well as the boundary condition at the leading edge . Oligomer annealing to ﬁlament ends is calculated as a bimolecular reaction with rate constant 𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 . This is implemented by scanning through all pairs of oligomers and available pointed and barbed barbed ends , converting 𝑃 𝐷 to a local oligomer concentration by assuming a uniform probability along the thin 𝑧 direction , and using 𝛿𝑥 , 𝛿𝑦 as the distances between the end of the oligomer and the end on the ﬁlament that could anneal to one another . The smallest distance in the 𝑥 - direction is used according to the periodic boundary conditions . If the annealing event is accepted , the length of the ﬁlament increases by the size of the oligomer . If the oligomer anneals to a barbed end , the barbed end state of the oligomer is transferred to the ﬁlament . If an oligomer did not anneal within 20 s of its creation , it was removed since in this time it likely disassembled . Removal was unlikely to occur at the chosen annealing rate constant since most oligomers annealed within a shorter time . We checked the time step used was suﬃciently small : 𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 < 120 𝜇 M − 1 s − 1 resulted in less than 40 % of oligomers annealing per time step , when using the reference parameter values in Table 1 . We also checked that the median of the time to anneal , 𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 , and the median distance between the severing and annealing events , 𝑟 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 , were related as expected from a theoretical approximation of these quantities assuming all barbed ends are free : 𝑟 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 = ( 4 𝐷 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔 𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 ) 1 / 2 with 𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 = ( 𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑙 𝐶 𝐵 ) − 1 , where 𝐶 𝐵 is the average concentration of barbed ends in the body of the simulated lamellipodium ( Fig . S7 ) . Simulated SiMS To compare our simulations to the actin speckle appearance and disappearance in SiMS , we tagged and tracked 1 % of actin monomers that add to the network through polymerization at the leading edge . Each such polymerization corresponds to a speckle appearance . Disappearance events occur when the tagged monomers depolymerize oﬀ a pointed end or when they become part of an oligomer . Annealing of an oligomer carrying a tagged monomer is an appearance . The speckle lifetime is the time between appearance and disappearance events . Orientation order parameter We counted the number of ﬁlaments having a segment within the ﬁrst micrometer of the leading edge and deﬁned the order parameter similar to Weichsel and Schwarz ( Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) and Mueller et al . ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ) : 𝑂 = ( 𝑁 − 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ − 2 𝑁 ± 35 ◦ ) / ( 𝑁 − 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ + 2 𝑁 ± 35 ◦ ) , where 𝑁 − 70 ◦ / 0 ◦ / 70 ◦ and 𝑁 ± 35 ◦ are the number of ﬁlaments oriented between − 20 ◦ to 20 ◦ and 60 ◦ to 80 ◦ in either direction , or between 25 ◦ − 45 ◦ in either direction , respectively . The angle is measured with respect to the axis of network growth . For 3D simulations , we used the angles of the ﬁlaments projected along the 𝑥𝑦 lamellipodial plane . SiMS imaging experiments SiMS experiments using Dylight 550 labeled actin introduced to XTC cells by electroporation was performed as in ( Yamashiro et al . , 2014 ) . Cells adhered on a poly - lysine - coated glass coverslip were observed by epi - ﬂuorescence microscopy . For measurements of speckle lifetime distribution , the exposure time was 0 . 1 s / frame . The lifetime data were normalized for photobleaching as in ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . In Figure 6A experiments , the leading edge was manually marked by a line which connects the centers of furthermost speckles in several consecutive images . Only actin SiMS that appeared within ∼ 300 nm from the line were analyzed for lifetimes . Lifetimes of 0 . 1 s were omitted as being beyond the temporal resolution limit . Disassembly of actin speckles in lamellipodia of XTC cells were also observed after treatment with 5 𝜇 M cytochalasin D , added after several seconds from the start of observation , at 2 s intervals . 20 Parameter scan for severing rates and oligomer size To estimate parameters for uniform and enhanced end severing rates ( 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓 , 𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑑 ) , we performed a parameter search over these values as well as the maximum oligomer length 𝑙 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 . To summarize the results , we classiﬁed each set of these parameters in terms of their ability to match the actin network structure and concentration , actin speckle dynamics , and if there was an increase in length between the front and back of the lamellipodium ( Figs . S3 and S5 ) : • Matching actin network structure and concentration . We marked a parameter set as satisfying this condition when the following occurred : ( i ) The F - actin concentration near the leading edge was 700 - 1500 𝜇 M for keratocytes and 400 - 1300 𝜇 M for XTC parameters ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Schaub et al . , 2007 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ; Watanabe , 2010 ) ; ( ii ) The midpoint of the concentration proﬁle fell between 5 - 15 𝜇 m ( keratocytes ) and 3 - 10 𝜇 m ( XTC cells ) ; ( iii ) The barbed end and branch concentration proﬁles were within 50 % of measurements of keratocyte and ﬁbroblast lamellipodia using electron tomograms ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . • Matching actin speckle dynamics . We indicated agreement with actin speckle SiMS ( Smith et al . , 2013 ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2018 ) when the following conditions were met : ( i ) Actin speckle lifetimes peak at short times , satisﬁed when the probability of speckles with lifetimes between 2 - 4 s was 0 . 025 - 0 . 055 for keratocytes ( from the full distribution ranging from 2 - 60 s ) and the probability of lifetimes between 4 - 8 s for XTC cells was 0 . 035 - 0 . 08 ( from the full distribution between 4 - 144 s ) . We did not include lifetimes shorter than 2 or 4 s , respectively , that could be at the limits of experimental resolution ; ( ii ) The lifetime distribution extended to lifetimes longer than 10 s ( at least 20 % ) ; ( iii ) The normalized speckle appearance and disappearance proﬁles as a function of distance from the leading edge were consistent with SiMS . In simulations without annealing , the speckle lifetime distribution did not peak monotonically at the shortest lifetimes , so we separately marked parameter sets with a peak within the ﬁrst 15 s ( keratocytes ) or 35 s ( XTC ) . • Increase in length away from leading edge . We considered length increase to occur if the ﬁlament length at 50 % of the cumulative length distribution of ﬁlaments with segments between 3 - 4 𝜇 m away from the leading edge was at least 0 . 2 𝜇 m ( keratocytes ) or 0 . 1 𝜇 m ( XTC ) larger compared to 0 - 1 𝜇 m away from the leading edge . Estimation of branching and capping rates by comparison to prior electron tomograms Capping and branching rates were determined by comparing to the the barbed end , branch and ﬁlament number of electron micographs of ﬁbroblast cells in Vinzenz et al . ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) ( used for the XTC parameter set ) and barbed end , pointed end and ﬁlament number from Mueller et al . ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ) for the keratocyte parameter set . In all instances of data comparison for the barbed end and pointed end number of Mueller et al . , the average value of two 0 . 106 𝜇𝑚 bins was compared to simulation results of 0 . 212 𝜇𝑚 bins . We use a simpliﬁed 2D dendritic nucleation model , without severing and annealing , to estimate the capping and branching rates for our simulations of keratocyte and XTC cases . We assume linear actin ﬁlaments , all oriented ± 35 ◦ relative to the leading edge with the − 𝑦 direction toward the center of the cell . These ﬁlaments polymerize , branch , cap and move with respect to the position of the leading edge due to retrograde ﬂow or cell protrusion . Filaments with free barbed ends ( uncapped ) remain at the leading edge and continue to polymerize . As they cap , they stop polymerization and move toward the center of the cell with retrograde ﬂow . For the purposes of this section , we do not consider uncapping of already capped ﬁlaments . Branches form at the leading edge and also move away with retrograde ﬂow . Denoted by 𝑙 the length of a ﬁlament with barbed end located at 𝑦 , the system of equations for the number of uncapped 𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 , 𝑡 ) , capped 𝑛 𝑐 ( 𝑙 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) barbed ends and branches 𝑛 𝑏𝑟 ( 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) are : 𝜕𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 , 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝑡 = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝛿 ( 𝑙 ) − 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 , 𝑡 ) − 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , 35 𝜕𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 , 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝑙 , ( 1 ) 𝜕𝑛 𝑐 ( 𝑙 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝑡 = 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 , 𝑡 ) 𝛿 ( 𝑦 ) − 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝜕𝑛 𝑐 ( 𝑙 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝑦 , ( 2 ) 𝜕𝑛 𝑏𝑟 ( 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝑡 = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝛿 ( 𝑦 ) − 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝜕𝑛 𝑏𝑟 ( 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝑦 , ( 3 ) The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of eqn 1 represents the branching source term which creates a new ﬁlament at 0 length . The last term of eqn 1 is polymerization of the ﬁlaments with 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 cos ( 35 ◦ ) . The second term of eqn 1 and ﬁrst term of eqn 2 represents the loss of uncapped ﬁlaments and addition of capped ﬁlaments . The second term of eqn 2 represents retrograde ﬂow of capped ﬁlaments . Eqn 3 accounts for the generation of branches and their motion with retrograde ﬂow toward the center of the cell . 21 Holz et al . In steady - state , the solutions of the uncapped and capped ends to be exponential and the number of branches is : 𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 ) = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 𝑒 − 𝑙 / 𝑙 ( 4 ) 𝑛 𝑐 ( 𝑙 , 𝑦 ) = 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , 35 𝑒 − 𝑙 / 𝑙 ( 5 ) 𝑛 𝑏𝑟 ( 𝑦 ) = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 ( 6 ) where 𝑙 = 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , 35 / 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 . To compare to electron tomogram quantiﬁcations we calculate the number of branches , barbed ends and the number of ﬁlaments in bins of increasing distance to the leading edge . Integrating eqn . 6 over 𝑦 from the minimum to maximum of the bin we ﬁnd the number of branches within the 𝑖 th bin , 𝑁 𝑏𝑟 , 𝑖 . 𝑁 𝑏𝑟 , 𝑖 = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 Δ 𝑦 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 , 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . ( 7 ) where Δ 𝑦 is the bin width centered at 𝑦 = ( 1 / 2 − 𝑖 ) Δ 𝑦 such that 𝑖 = 1 is the bin that includes the leading edge . The number of barbed ends within a bin centered at 𝑦 depends on the total number of capped and uncapped ﬁlaments . We integrate over all ﬁlament lengths 𝑙 and the distance from the leading edge 𝑦 : 𝑁 𝐵𝐸 ( 𝑦 ) = ∫ ∞ 0 𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 ) 𝑑𝑙 ∫ 𝑦 + Δ 𝑦 / 2 𝑦 − Δ 𝑦 / 2 𝛿 ( 𝑦 ) 𝑑𝑦 + ∫ ∞ 0 ∫ 𝑦 + Δ 𝑦 / 2 𝑦 − Δ 𝑦 / 2 𝑛 𝑐 ( 𝑙 , 𝑦 ) 𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑙 . ( 8 ) We ﬁnd the solution for the number of barbed ends in the the 𝑖 th bin to be : 𝑁 𝐵𝐸 , 𝑖 = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 𝛿 𝑖 , 1 + 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 Δ 𝑦 , 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . ( 9 ) In the electron tomograms , the ﬁlament number was measured by counting the number of ﬁlaments crossing the middle plane of the measured bins . We calculate the equivalent ﬁlament number by integrating the sum of the capped and uncapped ﬁlaments that are long enough to cross the distance in 𝑦 at the center of such bins : 𝑁 𝑓 𝑖𝑙 ( 𝑦 ) = ∫ ∞ − 𝑦 / cos ( 35 ) 𝑛 𝑢 ( 𝑙 ) 𝑑𝑙 + ∫ − 𝑦 0 𝑑𝑠 ∫ ∞ 𝑠 / cos ( 35 ) 𝑛 𝑐 ( 𝑙 , 𝑦 − 𝑠 ) 𝑑𝑙 . ( 10 ) Integrating , we ﬁnd , 𝑁 𝑓 𝑖𝑙 ( 𝑦 ) = 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 ( 2 𝑒 𝑦𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑡 − 1 ) ( 11 ) which can be evaluated at bin 𝑖 using 𝑦 = ( 1 / 2 − 𝑖 ) Δ 𝑦 .

( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) and keratocyte cells from Mueller et al . ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ) for lamellipodia region of 1 𝜇 m . Since the leading edge is not well deﬁned in the EM tomograms , we consider the leading edge to begin at the maximum barbed end value but we also include the number of barbed ends that would be considered outside the cell ( with this deﬁnition ) in the region of 0 - 0 . 212 𝜇 m . 22 Parameter estimation for keratocyte parameter set Mueller et al . ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ) quantiﬁed the number of barbed , pointed ends and ﬁlaments in keratocyte lamellipodia near the leading edge . Assuming all pointed ends near the leading edge are at a branch , we can solve eqn . 7 for the branching rate 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 using the relative network velocity 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 0 . 2 𝜇𝑚 / 𝑠 , Δ 𝑦 = 0 . 212 𝜇 m and an estimate for the number of branches , 𝑁 𝑏𝑟 . Unlike eqn . 7 in the simple model considered in this supplementary text , the number of pointed ends in Mueller et al . ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ) increased over the ﬁrst 0 . 424 𝜇 m ( two bins ) . Using the average number of pointed ends over two bins from the leading edge as an estimate of 𝑁 𝑏𝑟 in eqn . 7 leads to 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 = 152 / 𝑠 / 𝜇 m . This number is consistent with the 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 value calculated using the number of pointed ends at longer distances , beyond the ﬁrst two bins . Using this estimate for 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 , we can estimate 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 in two diﬀerent ways : ( i ) Using eqn . 9 with 𝑖 = 1 and Table 2 we ﬁnd the capping rate to be 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 1 . 02 / 𝑠 . ( ii ) Numerically solving eqn . 11 , using the number of ﬁlaments from Table 2 with 𝑖 = 2 and 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 from above , we ﬁnd 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 32 / 𝑠 ( we do not consider 𝑖 = 1 since the number of ﬁlaments is increasing within the region 0 - 0 . 106 𝜇𝑚 , unlike in the current model ) . In the main text and supplementary ﬁgures we used branching rate and capping rates similar to the values calculated in ( i ) and ( ii ) : 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 6 / 𝑠 was required to produce consistent results when depolymerization and severing was included in the simulation . Parameter estimation for XTC parameter set Vinzenz et al . ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) studied lamellipodia of ﬁbroblast cells and measured branch , barbed end and ﬁlament number close to the leading edge , as well as the ﬁlament length distribution . The values in the ﬁrst two bins shown in Table 2 used Δ 𝑦 = 0 . 25 𝜇 m and in this system 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 0 . 03 𝜇𝑚 / 𝑠 Vinzenz et al . ( 2012 ) . The branching rate can be estimated using eqn . 7 and Table 2 to ﬁnd 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 = 17 . 9 / 𝑠 / 𝜇 m . We can estimate the capping rate 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 in three diﬀerent ways as follows . ( i ) Using the calculation for the number of barbed ends of eqn . 9 . From eqn . 9 , the value of barbed ends in bins 2 and higher is of the same order as the number of branches in eqn . 7 , consistent with the measurements in Vinzenz et al . in Table 2 . The ratio of barbed ends in the ﬁrst bin to the second bin is however a value that depends on 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 but is independent of 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 : 𝑁 𝐵𝐸 , 1 𝑁 𝐵𝐸 , 2 = 1 / 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 + Δ 𝑦 / 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 Δ 𝑦 / 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 ( 12 ) Solving for the capping rate using 𝑁 𝐵𝐸 , 1 / 𝑁 𝐵𝐸 , 2 = 580 / 170 leads to 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 082 / 𝑠 . ( ii ) Using the solution for the number of ﬁlaments of eqn . 11 and the values in Table 2 . We ﬁnd for 𝑖 = 1 , 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 06 / 𝑠 and 𝑖 = 2 , 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 04 / 𝑠 . ( iii ) Comparison to the average ﬁlament length 𝑙 = 𝑣 𝑝𝑜𝑙 , 35 / 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 . The median ﬁlament length from Vinzenz et al . ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) is approximately 162 nm ≈ 60 sub ( a value similar to Bailly et al . who measured ﬁlament lengths to be between 100 and 200 nm ( Bailly et al . , 1999 ) near the leading edge of MTLn3 cells ) . Using this value for 𝑙 , we ﬁnd 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 23 / 𝑠 . In the main text and supplementary ﬁgures we used values of 𝑘 𝑏𝑟 = 30 / 𝑠 / 𝜇𝑚 , and 𝑘 𝑐𝑎𝑝 = 0 . 2 / s to produce the same F - actin density at the leading edge while using 𝑣 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 0 . 05 𝜇𝑚 / 𝑠 ( comparable to retrograde ﬂow in XTC cells ) and also producing consistent results when depolymerization and severing is added . 23
