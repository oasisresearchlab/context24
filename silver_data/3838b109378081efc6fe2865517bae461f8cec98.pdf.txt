www . aging ‐ us . com 3736 AGING INTRODUCTION Fully grown mammalian oocytes are arrested at the diplotene stage of the first meiotic prophase within ovarian follicles , which is also called germinal vesicle ( GV ) stage . In order to produce fertilizable female gametes , these oocytes must undergo well - regulated meiotic maturation , including meiosis resumption , proper apparatus assembly and arrangement , as well as first polar body ( PBI ) extrusion . A combination of cytoskeleton , including microtubules and actin fila - ments is pivotal for the success meiosis of oocytes . Microtubules form a specialized bipolar - shaped spindle at the center of oocyte at the metaphase I ( MI ) stage , and the accurate establishment of the meiotic spindle drives the congression of chromosomes at the equatorial plate [ 1 ] . Then the inter - chromosomal microtubules form the central spindle to lead chromosomes seg - regation during anaphase I ( AI ) in oocytes [ 2 ] . Actin filaments accumulated both at the cytoplasm and cortex of oocytes , and are directly involved in pushing meiotic spindle to the cortex during meiosis I , which also maintain asymmetric spindle positioning at metaphase II ( MII ) [ 3 , 4 ] . At the telophase I ( TI ) stage , the special actin - based cortical bulges and the meiotic spindle midzone induces the formation of cytokinetic furrows for pinching off a polar body [ 5 - 7 ] . Protein kinase D ( PKD ) family , which includes three isoforms PKD1 , PKD2 , and PKD3 [ 8 - 10 ] , is a novel family of serine / threonine kinases [ 9 , 11 ] . PKD is the homology with conserved domains of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) subfamily members . In most cellular systems , PKD family members are activated through PKC - dependent pathway by phosphorylation approach . The PKC - PKD signaling cascade has been increasingly im - plicated in the regulation of multiple important bio - logical responses including protein transport , cell pro - www . aging ‐ us . com AGING 2018 , Vol . 10 , No . 12 Research Paper Inhibition of protein kinase D disrupts spindle formation and actin assembly during porcine oocyte maturation Yu Zhang 1 , Hong ‐ Hui Wang 1 , Xiang Wan 1 , Yao Xu 1 , Meng ‐ Hao Pan 1 , Shao ‐ Chen Sun 1 1 College of Animal Science and Technology , Nanjing Agricultural University , Nanjing 210095 , China Correspondence to : Shao ‐ Chen Sun ; email : sunsc @ njau . edu . cn Keywords : oocyte , meiosis , spindle , actin , PKD Received : October 2 , 2018 Accepted : November 15 , 2018 Published : December 14 , 2018 Copyright : Zhang et al .

ABSTRACT Protein kinase D ( PKD ) subfamily which includes PKD1 , PKD2 and PKD3 is a novel family of serine / threonine kinases . PKD has been widely implicated in the regulation of multiple physiological effects including immune responses , apoptosis and cell proliferation . However , the roles of PKD in oocytes have not been fully clarified . In this study we investigated the regulatory functions of PKD during porcine oocyte maturation . Our results indicated that PKD expressed in porcine oocytes and the inhibition of PKD family activity led to the failure of meiosis resumption and the first polar body extrusion . Further analysis indicated that the spindle assembly and chromosome alignment were disrupted after PKD family inhibition , and this might be through its regulatory role on MAPK phosphorylation . We also found that PKD phosphorylated cofilin for actin assembly , which further affected cortical actin distribution , indicating the roles of PKD family on cytoskeleton . In addition , a decreased expression of PKD in postovulatory aging porcine oocytes was observed , which might connect PKD with cytoskeleton defects in aged oocytes . Taken together , these results suggest that PKD possesses important functions in porcine oocyte maturation by regulating spindle organization and actin assembly . www . aging ‐ us . com 3737 AGING liferation and survival [ 12 , 13 ] . PKD has emerged as key regulators of protein transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane [ 14 , 15 ] . PKD also modulates apop - totic responses in different models [ 16 , 17 ] . Moreover , PKD is activated by oxidative stress and triggers the activation of NF - B signaling , leading to the induction of SOD2 for increased cellular survival in response to oxidative stress [ 18 , 19 ] . Recently , the PKD family is reported to be an important regulator of F - actin remodeling for cell motility [ 20 , 21 ] . Despite of these important discoveries , the functions of PKD in mammalian oocyte meiosis has not been investigated . In current study , we inhibited PKD family activity to explore the roles of PKD in porcine oocytes and we showed that PKD served as a key regulator for proper spindle organization and actin assembly for polar body extrusion of porcine oocytes . We also provided a potential link for PKD and cytoskeleton defects in aged oocytes . RESULTS Inhibition of PKD family results in the failure of oocyte maturation In this study , we first examined the existence of PKD and our results showed that PKD protein expressed in porcine oocytes ( Figure 1A ) . And then we assessed COCs viability and oocytes maturation after PKD inhibition using the PKD specific inhibitor CID755673 . After culturing for 44 h following different concen - trations of 5 μ M , 10 μ M , 20 μ M and 50 μ M CID755673 treatment , we found that the expansion of the peripheral layers cumulus was seriously affected . As shown in Figure 1B , most of the cumulus cells was fully expand - ed in the control group , whereas partially expanded or not expanded cumulus were observed in 50 μ M CID755673 treatment groups . Moreover , CID755673 treatment also disturbed PBI extrusion of porcine oocytes compared with the control groups . The percen - Figure 1 . Effects of PKD inhibition on porcine oocyte maturation .

And the proportion of PBI was 87 . 37 ± 15 . 74 % ( n = 138 , P > 0 . 05 ) , 78 . 77 ± 3 . 68 % ( n = 245 , P < 0 . 01 ) , 56 . 42 ± 6 . 53 % ( n = 241 , P < 0 . 001 ) and 10 . 11 ± 7 . 19 % ( n = 228 , P < 0 . 001 ) in 5 μ M , 10 μ M , 20 μ M and 50 μ M CID755673 groups respectively . The failure of polar body extrusion led us to examine meiosis progression after PKD inhibition . After 27h culture , only 10 . 66 ± 7 . 18 % ( n = 179 ) of oocytes were arrested at GV stage , while most of 50 μ M CID755673 - treated oocytes were arrested at GV stage ( 65 . 09 ± 7 . 90 % , n = 166 , P < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 1D ) . These findings imply that PKD inhibition may cause the block of meiosis resumption and the failure of polar body extrusion during porcine oocyte maturation . To analyze the roles of PKD family on oocyte meiosis , a concentration of 20 μ M was applied for subsequent studies . Inhibition of PKD family affects p - MAPK - mediated spindle organization in porcine oocytes Since proper spindle formation is critical for the polar body extrusion during oocyte maturation , we assessed spindle morphology after PKD inhibition . As shown in Figure 2A , most oocytes exhibited a typical barrel - shaped spindle apparatus and well - aligned chromo - somes on the metaphase plate in the control group ; however , it displayed disorganized spindles with severely misaligned chromosomes in CID755673 treatment oocytes . The statistical data of abnormal spindle also confirmed this : As shown in Figure 2B , compared with 8 . 80 ± 7 . 39 % ( n = 154 ) abnormal spindle in control oocytes , up to 68 . 70 ± 4 . 98 % ( n = 112 , P < 0 . 001 ) CID755673 - treated oocytes displayed disorganized spindles and misaligned chromosomes . We next explored the possible regulatory mechanism for the roles of PKD on spindle formation in oocytes . Our results showed that the expression of p - MAPK was Figure 2 .

The relative intensity of p - MAPK also confirmed this ( 1 versus 0 . 36 ± 0 . 25 , P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 2C ) . Taken together , our data imply that PKD is involved in the regulation of MAPK phosphorylation for meiotic spindle organization during porcine oocyte meiosis . Inhibition of PKD family affects p - cofilin - mediated actin assembly in porcine oocytes In addition , actin filaments are also the general power for the extrusion of polar body in oocytes . We also asses - sed the arrangements of the actin filaments in oocytes after CID755673 treatment . In our study , F - actin staining with phalloidin was applied , as shown in Figure 3A , the accumulation of actin signals at the cortical region significantly decreased in CID755673 - treated oocytes compared with the controls , which was also confirmed by the actin fluorescence intensity analysis from the lineation ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , quan - titative analysis of cortical actin fluorescence intensity was also consistent with the above results , showing that inhibition of PKD substantially decreased actin intensity at the cortex of oocytes ( 1 versus 0 . 61 ± 0 . 08 , n = 36 ; Figure 3 .

While there was no difference for the actin fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm of CID755673 treatment oocytes compared with the control groups ( Figure 3C ) . Actin assembly defects drove us to further explore the underlying regulator of PKD in porcine oocytes . As shown in Figure 3D , compared with the controls , the expression of p - cofilin was remarkably reduced after PKD inhibition . Quantitative analysis of p - cofilin band intensity also confirmed this ( 1 versus 0 . 32 ± 0 . 24 ; P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 3D ) . Therefore , these data suggest that PKD may be involved in cofilin phosphorylation for actin arrangement during porcine oocyte meiosis . Expression of PKD1 decreases in postovulatory aging porcine oocytes In this study , we also performed western blot analysis of oocytes to explore whether the expression of PKD family were related with oocyte aging using the postovulatory aging oocytes . And we found that PKD1 expression decreased in postovulatory aging oocytes compared to controls ( Figure 4A ) . Moreover , quan - titative analysis of band intensity also confirmed this ( 1 versus 0 . 48 ± 0 . 29 ; P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 4B ) . Thus , these results suggest that such a reduction of PKD expression might be related with cytoskeleton defects in aged porcine oocytes . DISCUSSION In the present study , we explored the functions of PKD during porcine oocyte meiotic maturation . We showed that PKD was critical for meiosis resumption , spindle organization and actin microfilament assembly , which eventually affected PBI extrusion during porcine oocyte maturation . We first showed that PKD expressed in porcine oocytes , indicating that PKD family may play roles during porcine oocyte meiotic maturation . To verify our hypothesis , by using a specific inhibitor CID755673 , we disrupted PKD activity and assessed the polar body extrusion as well as the meiotic procession . Previous study indicated that the treatment with 5 μ M CID755673 resulted in significant inhibition of NK cells [ 22 ] . Additionally , the phosphorylation levels of PKD were completely blocked at 50 μ M CID755673 treatment [ 23 ] . Thus , in the current study four different concentrations of 5 μ M , 10 μ M , 20 μ M and 50 μ M were applied to investigate the roles of PKD in oocytes . Our results showed a significant failure of the polar body extrusion after PKD inhibition when CID755673 were raised to 10 μ M ; moreover , 50 μ M CID755673 strongly blocked meiosis resumption . These findings were expected because PKD3 knock - down in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells disrupted the com - pletion of proper cell cycle , thus reduced their proliferation rate [ 24 ] . In addition , it was proposed that other PKD inhibitor , SD - 208 and CRT006610 induced G2 / M cell cycle arrest and suppressed the proliferation of cancer cell [ 25 , 26 ] . Therefore , we suggest that PKD may positively affect polar body extrusion and meiotic process of porcine oocytes . We then analyzed the causes for the defects of polar body extrusion after PKD inhibition . Our results showed abnormal spindle morphologies with misaligned chromosomes in porcine oocytes after PKD inhibition , indicating a critical role for PKD in spindle formation and chromosome alignment during porcine oocyte meiosis . Similar results were found for other protein kinases in mitosis , showing that Polo - like kinase 1 - mediated Kindlin - 1 phosphorylation ensuring mitotic spindle assembly and cellular survival [ 27 ] . The functions of protein kinases on meiotic spindle apparatus are also proposed . It has been shown that PKCs play important roles in regulating spindle organization in mouse eggs [ 28 ] . Polo - like kinase 4 and Aurora kinase A cooperate in the initiation of acen - triolar spindle assembly during oocyte meiosis [ 29 ] . Thus , our results indicate that similar with other protein kinases , PKD family is also involved in spindle organization , which regulates polar body extrusion during porcine oocyte maturation . Furthermore , to analyze the regulatory approach of PKD family on spindle formation , we examined MAPK phosphoryla - tion levels , which are critical for spindle formation and stability in oocytes [ 30 ] . Our results showed the expression level of phosphorylated MAPK reduced significantly after PKD inhibition . In other models PKD Figure 4 . PKD1 expression decreases in aged oocytes .

Overall , we conclude that PKD positive modulates the level of p - MAPK , thereby contributes to spindle formation during porcine oocytes meiosis . Moreover , the defects of polar body extrusion are probably caused by abnormal actin dynamics , including cortical and cytoplasmic actin filaments [ 32 , 33 ] . We then assessed actin distribution , and we found a significant decrease of cortical actin expression after PKD activity inhibition , which suggested the involve - ment of PKD in actin assembly during porcine oocyte meiosis . Our results were supported by the previous study showing that PKD was pivotal for F - actin stabilization and remodeling in mitotic cells [ 20 , 34 ] . It has been proposed that the prominent role of PKD on stabilizing F - actin probably was achieved through multiple downstream effectors . PKD1 phosphorylated and modulated the activity of cortactin , a key regulator of actin dynamics , and was responsible for actin assembly [ 35 ] . It was also reported that PKD partici - pated in RhoA signaling pathway for regulating cofilin - mediated F - actin reorganization [ 21 ] . In present study , we found that p - cofilin expression was greatly reduced after PKD inhibition . Thus , our data demonstrate that PKD plays conserved roles on the regulation of cofilin - mediated actin assembly for porcine oocyte maturation . Age - related decrease in fertility becomes a hallmark of animal development and human reproduction [ 36 , 37 ] . The aged eggs of compromised developmental compe - tence is pivotal characterized by the disruption of subcellular structures like spindle / chromosome anoma - lies and actin distribution defects [ 38 ] . Since PKD inhibition is also accompanied by spindle abnormality and actin distribution disorganization , we wondered if the PKD was involved in the aging - associated oocyte meiotic defects . Our results showed the decreased levels of PKD1 in postovulatory aging porcine oocytes , indicating a possible involvement of PKD in oocyte developmental competence during postovulatory aging . In summary , our data indicate that PKD phosphorylates MAPK for spindle organization and cofilin for actin assembly during porcine oocyte meiotic maturation . Meanwhile , the decreased PKD1 might be one potential reason for the cytoskeletal defects in aged oocytes .

Louis , MO , USA ) . Rabbit monoclonal anti - PKD antibody ( # 2052 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - phospho - MAPK antibody ( # 4370 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - p - cofilin antibody ( # 3313 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - β - actin antibody ( # 3700 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - GAPDH antibody ( # 2118 ) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology ( Danvers , MA , USA ) . CID755673 was from Selleck ( Houston , TX , USA ) . All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) , unless otherwise stated . COCs collection and IVM All procedures with animals were conducted according to the Animal Research Ethic Committee guidelines of Nanjing Agriculture University , China . The experimental protocols were approved by Nanjing Agri - culture University Animal Research Ethic Committee . Porcine ovaries from prepubertal gilts were collected and transported from the local abattoir to laboratory in sterile physiological saline ( 0 . 9 % NaCl ) containing 800 IU / ml of gentamicin within 2 h . By aspiration with a 20 - gauge needle attached to a 10 ml disposable syringe , cumulus - oocyte complexes ( COCs ) were harvested from 3 - 6 mm antral follicles . Oocytes with intact and compact cumulus cells and a uniform ooplasm were selected from the subnatant precipitate of follicular fluid for study . After four times rinsing with in vitro maturation modified medium 199 containing 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) , 3 . 05 mM D - glucose , 0 . 91 mM sodium pyruvate , 0 . 57 mM cysteine , 50 μ g / ml of streptomycin , 75 μ g / ml of penicillin , 10 IU / ml of hCG , 10 IU / ml of PMSG , 10 ng / ml of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and 10 % pFF . A group of sixty COCs were cultured in 500 μ l of IVM medium covered with 200 μ l mineral oil in each well of a four - well dish ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) at 38 . 5°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 incubator . CID755673 treatment in vitro A specific PKD family inhibitor , CID755673 was employed to inhibit the activity of intracellular PKD during oocytes meiosis . COCs were divided into two groups , as follows : ( i ) non - treated ( control ) group ; ( ii ) treatment group with CID755673 . To evaluate the effects of CID755673 on COCs viability and oocyte maturation , a 50 mM stock solution was prepared in DMSO and then diluted to final concentration of 5 μ M , 10 μ M , 20 μ M and 50 μ M in IVM medium . Control oocytes were treated with the same concentration of DMSO . After culture with PKD inhibitor , oocytes were prepared for phenotypic analysis . www . aging ‐ us . com 3742 AGING Assessment of nuclear maturation and meiotic progression Oocyte maturation is judged by both cumulus cells expansion and polar body extrusion . After 44 h culturing , cumulus cells expansion degree was assessed subjectively as fully expanded ( all cumulus cells were loosened ) , partially expanded ( the outer layer of cells was loosened ) or not expanded ( none of cumulus cells were loosened ) under a stereomicroscope . Subsequent - ly , for assessing the polar bodies emission , oocytes were then separated from surrounding cumulus cells completely by pipetting gently with a fine - bore pipette in 0 . 02 % ( w / v ) hyaluronidase ( in TCM - 199 ) , a group of denuded oocytes were gathered together and then rotated one by one with a thin sealed glass needle under a Olympus IX53 inverted microscope ( Olympus Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) ( 100X ) , and those with polar bodies were judged as matured oocytes . For determining the meiotic progression , denuded oocytes were stained with Hoechst 33342 and observed under a Zeiss LSM 700 META confocal system . Oocytes being in the germinal vesicle stage ( GV ) were considered immature , oocytes from GVBD - MII stage were considered to be restore maturational progression . Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy The denuded oocytes were fixed with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde ( in PBS ) for 30 min and then permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 ( in PBS ) for 8 - 12 h at room temperature . To suppress nonspecific binding of IgG , oocytes were blocked in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) - supplemented PBS for 1 h at room temperature . For evaluation of spindle configuration , oocytes were incubated with anti - α - tubulin - FITC antibody ( 1 : 400 ) overnight at 4°C . For actin staining , oocytes were labeled with Phalloidin - TRITC ( 5 μ g / ml in PBS ) for 1 h at room temperature . After washing three times , oocytes were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( 10 μ g / ml in PBS ) for 15 min . Finally , samples were mounted on glass slides , and observed under a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Zeiss LSM 700 META ; Germany ) . Protein extraction and Western blot analysis After in vitro culture for 27 h , a total of 150 porcine oocytes were collected and lysed in 2×Laemmil SDS sample buffer ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Proteins were boiled for 10 min at 100°C . After cooling and centrifugation , samples were stored at - 20°C . Protein extracts were separated using NUPAGE 12 % Bis - Tris Precast Gel ( Thermo Fisher , Waltham , MA , USA ) and electrically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . Membranes were then blocked in Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBST ) and 5 % ( w / v ) BSA for 1 h at room temperature , and subsequently incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti - PKD antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - phospho - MAPK antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - p - cofilin antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) and rabbit polyclonal anti - PKD1 antibody ( 1 : 500 ) at 4°C overnight . After washing three times in TBST ( 10 min each ) , membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1 : 5000 dilution of HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG . Finally , chemiluminescence was performed with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System ( Tanon - 3900 , China ) . Equal protein loading was confirmed by the levels of actin ( 1 : 2000 ) or GAPDH ( 1 : 2000 ) . Statistical analysis All experiments were performed at least three times .
