Testing the Role of an Arf GTPase - activating Protein dASAP in Epithelial Cell Polarity in the Drosophila Embryo by Wei Shao A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science Graduate Department of Cell and Systems Biology University of Toronto ©Copyright by Wei Shao 2010 . ii Thesis title : Testing the role of an Arf GTPase - activating protein dASAP in epithelial cell polarity in the Drosophila embryo Master of Science 2010 Wei Shao Graduate Department of Cell and Systems Biology University of Toronto ABSTRACT Baz / PAR3 is a key regulator of epithelial cell polarity ( ECP ) . To identify proteins functioning with Baz , I completed a baz genetic interaction screen by localizing 15 GFP - tagged candidates . Then I tested the role of a top candidate , dASAP ( D rosophila A rf GTPase - activating protein with S H3 domain , A nkyrin repeat and P H domain ) , in Drosophila ECP . To determine whether dASAP might interact with polarity players , I defined the localization of dASAP throughout embryogenesis with GFP - tagged proteins and an anti - dASAP antibody . To study how loss of dASAP function affects ECP , I generated a deletion allele by imprecise P - element excision . To evaluate how each of the six domains of dASAP contributes to its localization and functions , I generated constructs deleting each domain . I found associations between dASAP , actin and the apical domain . The six domains may act redundantly to localize dASAP , although interactions between domains may affect the degree of membrane association . iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS A part of the results presented in this thesis was previously published in : Shao , W . , Wu , J . , Chen , J . , Lee , D .

As an open , supportive and inspiring mentor , Tony guided me through the tough yet fruitful trip of scientific pursuit . In particular , Tony has introduced me to an artistic and exciting world of cells . More importantly , I have learned so much else from Tony , from as simple as to how to survive in science as a graduate student , to as complicated as to how to thrive in science as a future scientist . I am also very grateful about Tony’s strong recommendation that promoted me for advanced - level studies in the United States . I would also like to thank my supervisory committee members Professor Andrew Wilde and Professor Dorothea Godt for sharing insightful suggestions that helped direct my research at critical moments and for helping me get into advanced - level studies in the United States as well . I also want to thank Professor Andrew Wilde as a graduate course instructor together with Professor Julie Brill . I would like to thank Professor Ashley Bruce as my external examiner and as a graduate course instructor together with Professor Rudolf Winklbauer . I’d also like to thank Professor Gabrielle Boulianne for sharing the anti - Amphiphysin antibody . I would like to give special thanks to all my labmates for everything they have done to help me . I often recall the time when Hoon and I were working iv really hard to do live imaging in my first year . I hope what I have taught to and learned from Hoon will remain a precious treasure between us . Partnership and friendship will be the most durable when facing tough moments . Hoon , thank you very much for becoming my first “student” in this lab . I wish you realize your dream in both becoming a physician - scientist and a good Jazz drummer . I’d like to thank Andrew and Daryl , as “role models” of graduate students in our lab . Thanks to both of you guys for helping me in my experiments while showing me how to enjoy life as a graduate student . Andrew , thank you for sharing your interesting outdoor experiences in various places . Daryl , thank you very much for your joyful sense of humor and advice about teaching . I also receive a lot of support from Mel for both science and non - science . Mel , thank you very much for being willing to hear me talk in the lab and showing me some interesting facets of local life . I also want to thank CQ for his generous technical support that helped me carry out what I want to do . I would like to thank every undergraduate in our lab for doing all the routine maintenance and bringing some fresh air to the lab . Thank you , Francisco , Jenny , Ted , and Yani ( with a special thanks to Ted for the conservations we’ve had so far ) ! Francisco , I hope I pass my stuff clearly to you . Thank you for becoming my last “student” in this lab . Believe me , ASAP rocks ! Go ASAP ! Last but not least , I would like to thank the people on the sixth floor who helped me before , including Dave , Felix , Katie , Melina , Michael , Ridhdhi , and Sandy . Outside the lab , I would like to thank my housemates Jiayi and Nathaniel for becoming my friends and kindly hosting me in each of their homes in Canada and the United States . I am very glad that Nathaniel talked v to me so many times about almost everything with the by - product of my better English . Finally , I would like to give my biggest ever thanks to my parents for their endless support . Please allow me to express my feeling using an English translation from a Chinese poem : A Song of Wanderer Stretching a thread in her hand , the loving mother is making warm clothes for her departing son . Carefully she sews the clothes stitch by stitch , fearing that he will not be back for long . How can the little grateful grass repay the nurture from the sunshine of spring ? vi TABLE OF CONTENTS ABSTRACT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii A part of the results presented in this thesis was previously published in : . . iii TABLE OF CONTENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi LIST OF TABLES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xi LIST OF FIGURES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xii LIST OF APPENDICES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xv LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xvi INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 .

WT : Wild type 1 INTRODUCTION 1 . Epithelia Epithelia are composed of adherent cell layers that separate body compartments . To perform particular functions , epithelial cells accommodate different morphologies , including cuboidal , columnar , and squamous cell shapes . Some epithelia are monolayers while others are stratified . Epithelia serve critical functions in development and adult physiology . In development , the morphogenetic movement of epithelial cells is important for gastrulation and subsequent organogenesis , such as cell intercalation in convergent extension and apical constriction during tissue invagination . In adult organisms , epithelia protect underlying tissues from damage . Epithelia also separate two biochemically distinct environments from each other in order to control the substance exchange between two sides . For instance , epithelial cells along the renal tubule and the collecting duct of kidney can excrete waste and reabsorb useful materials . Epithelial cells in glands secrete hormones and enzymes into the lumen or circulatory system . Simple squamous epithelia lining the lung facilitate gas diffusion . Specialized epithelial cells sense external stimuli and send signals to the connecting nerve ( Alberts et al . , 2008 ) . The importance of epithelia is also highlighted in pathogenesis . Most types of cancer arise from abnormal epithelia . At the initiation of metastasis , epithelial cells lose intercellular junctions and increase cell motility , and eventually acquire metastatic properties of cancer cells . Malfunction of epithelia also results in physiological diseases . In the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis , epithelial cells 2 have impaired transport of water and salt , leading to accumulation of mucus and subsequent blockage of airways and glands ( Alberts et al . , 2008 ) . 2 . Epithelial cell polarity 2 . 1 Introduction to epithelial cell polarity . As discussed , epithelial cells usually face different biological environments on each side . Consistent with this , epithelial cells are polarized with distinct apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains separated by adherens junctions ( AJs ) ( Figure 1B ) . The apical domain faces the lumen or external environment while the basolateral domain contacts extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The apical and basolateral domains are both structurally different ( e . g . the apical domain usually has microvilli or cilia for specific functions ) , and biochemically distinct with enrichment of different proteins and membrane lipids . This is essential for maintaining each domain as functionally different . Such epithelial apico - basal polarity is critical for guiding normal embryonic development and for adult functions ( Alberts et al . , 2008 ) . 2 . 2 Establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity . Since epithelial cell polarity ( ECP ) is essential for the structure and functions of epithelia , it is important to investigate how ECP is established and maintained . In mammalian cell culture , the establishment of ECP is initiated by cell - cell adhesion and cell - ECM adhesion ( Yeaman et al . , 1999 ) . In particular , individual cells migrate towards each other and initiate the contact by cell protrusions with 3 Figure 1 . Schematics of epithelial development in Drosophila embryogenesis . Schematics of epithelial development at cellularization ( A ) and following epithelial cell formation ( B ) are shown . Focal planes at various positions with the corresponding names are shown . Images at these focal planes are later shown in the results . Adherens junctions labeled by grey box . Abbreviation : AJ ( Adherens junction ) , SAJ ( Spot adherens junction ) . 4 Figure 1 . Schematics of epithelial development in Drosophila embryogenesis 5 the subsequent cadherin - catenin ( AJ components ) clustering . Then the cadherin - catenin clusters promote actin protrusions to expand AJs . Afterwards , AJs facilitate the recruitment of α - catenin and PAR - 3 ( Partition defective 3 ) to regulate AJ signaling and remodel the actin cytoskeleton . Eventually , it leads to AJ maturation by the formation of contractile actin bundles underneath AJs ( Harris and Tepass , 2010 ) . During this process , cell - cell adhesions segregate different membrane lipids and proteins at the plasma membrane to create asymmetry . Later on , this polarity is reinforced and maintained by polarized membrane trafficking ( Yeaman et al . , 1999 ) . However , AJs are not always at the top of the polarity establishment hierarchy . In the Drosophila embryo , cellularizing epithelia are formed with cell membranes already in contact . Here Bazooka ( Baz , the Drosophila PAR - 3 homologue ) acts upstream of adherens junctions in establishing ECP ( Harris and Peifer , 2004 ) . Baz accumulates apically in the absence of AJs , but not vice versa , suggesting apical accumulation of AJs depends on Baz . Still , because the basolateral marker Discs large fails to be removed from the apical domain in the absence of junctions ( Harris and Peifer , 2004 ) , AJs seem to be involved in establishing epithelial cell polarity to some extent . The elaboration and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity depends on several key polarity protein complexes : the Crb / Pals1 / Patj protein complex defines the apical membrane , the PAR - 3 / Par6 / aPKC protein complex functions at the apicolateral membrane , and the Lgl / Scrib / Dlg protein complex marks the basolateral membrane . Genetic interaction analysis reveals that the mutual 6 interactions between the three complexes maintain the identity of each domain ( Tepass et al . , 2001 ; Tanentzapf and Tepass , 2002 ; Bilder et al . , 2002 ) . Recently , a fourth polarity complex of Yurt / Cora / Nrx - IV / Na + , K + - ATPase was found to be essential for the basolateral domain and it functions to counteract the apical Crb protein complex ( Laprise et al . , 2009 ) . 3 . Adherens junctions Adherens junctions are intercellular junctions mediated by homophilic interactions of classic cadherins . Classic cadherins are single - pass transmembrane proteins with multiple extracellular cadherin domains and a cytoplasmic tail . The extracellular domain of E - cadherin ( Epithelial cadherin ) is responsible for mediating the interaction of E - cadherin molecules between neighboring cells . The cytoplasmic tail of E - cadherin binds β - catenin . β - catenin interacts with α - catenin which can then bind to the actin cytoskeleton directly or indirectly through actin - binding proteins . Therefore the whole cadherin - catenin complex links AJs to the actin cytoskeleton circumferential belt underneath ( Harris and Tepass , 2010 ) . AJs play an essential role in epithelial biology . As mentioned , AJs serve as a landmark to separate the apical and basolateral domains in epithelial cell polarity . AJs are also critical for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues . Loss of AJs results in dissociation and depolarization of epithelial cells in the Drosophila embryo ( Cox et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , AJs interact extensively with the cytoskeleton inside epithelial cells . AJs remodel the actin cytoskeleton during 7 AJs assembly in mammalian epithelial cell culture ( McNeill et al . , 1993 ; Harris and Tepass , 2010 ) . AJs are also linked to microtubules through several adaptor proteins ( Ligon et al . , 2001 ; Karki et al . , 2002 ; Meng et al . , 2008 ) . Such microtubule attachment allows the delivery of membrane proteins to organize epithelial cell polarity ( Shaw et al . , 2007 ; Nejsum and Nelson , 2007 ) . In development , epithelial tissues often undergo dramatic morphogenesis which requires remodeling of AJs ( Bertet et al . , 2004 ; Blankenship et al . , 2006 ) . AJs need to be removed from the plasma membrane when cell - cell contacts are being shortened . Conversely , additional AJs are required to insert into cell - cell contacts when epithelial cells are elongating or after new contacts are made . The changes are at least partially due to membrane trafficking of junctional components ( Harris and Tepass , 2010 ) . 4 . Roles of membrane trafficking in epithelial cell polarity 4 . 1 General trafficking routes in polarized epithelial cells . Epithelial cell polarity is established and maintained so that different membrane proteins segregate into either apical or basolateral domains . However , it is well known that the plasma membrane is highly dynamic with constant insertion and removal of membranes and their associated proteins ( Steyer and Almers , 2001 ; Grant and Donaldson , 2009 ) . As a result , membrane trafficking has to be fine - tuned in order to maintain the asymmetric distribution of proteins along the plasma membrane . At least three trafficking routes have to be tightly regulated : delivery of newly synthesized proteins , recycling of pre - existing 8 proteins , and degradation of pre - existing proteins ( Rodriguez - Boulan et al . , 2005 ; Folsch , 2008 ) . New membrane proteins have to be sorted at the Golgi apparatus before delivery to either the apical or basolateral domain along the biosynthetic trafficking pathway ( Mellman and Nelson , 2008 ) . Once pre - existing proteins are removed from the plasma membrane , they have two destinations : being recycled back to the plasma membrane or being degraded in the lysosome , depending on whether the protein is required for subsequent cellular processes or not . 4 . 2 Membrane trafficking and polarity proteins . As mentioned , membrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells needs tight regulation , including transport of polarity determinants and junctional proteins . Several lines of evidence indicate extensive interactions between polarity proteins and trafficking in epithelial cells . PAR proteins regulate trafficking of polarity proteins . In the early Drosophila embryo , Cdc42 and PAR protein complex ( Baz - Par6 - aPKC ) maintain dynamic adherens junctions by inhibiting endocytosis of Crumbs and promoting its progression from early endosomes into multivesicular bodies in the neuroectoderm ( Harris and Tepass , 2008 ) . Trafficking of Crb also seems to depend on apical recycling endosomes ( AREs ) . In Drosophila embryonic epidermal cells , disruption of ARE marker Rab11 functions causes loss of Crb from the apical domain before destabilization of AJs ( Roeth et al . , 2009 ) . To support this point , Crb is found to accumulate in expanded Rab11 - positive 9 recycling endosomes in the Drosophila mutant embryo defective in exocytosis ( Blankenship et al . , 2007 ) . PAR proteins also regulate trafficking of junctional proteins . In Drosophila pupae , Cdc42 , aPKC and PAR6 cooperate with actin assembly machinery WASP ( Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ) and Arp2 / 3 ( Actin - binding protein 2 / 3 ) to stabilize adherens junctions by promoting endocytosis and thus recycling of DE - cadherin in the notum of the dorsal thorax ( Georglou et al . , 2008 ; Leibfried et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to apical polarity proteins , basolateral polarity proteins may be involved in regulating trafficking at the basolateral membrane . In MDCK cells , Lgl was shown to interact with syntaxin - 4 , a component of the basolateral exocytic machinery ( Musch et al . , 2002 ) . 5 . Actin cytoskeleton and epithelial cell polarity 5 . 1 Actin cytoskeleton . Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) is assembled from the polymerization of monomeric globular actin ( G - actin ) . F - actin can further form polarized structures like bundles or dendritic networks . This process is regulated by small Rho GTPases , including Rho1 , Rac1 and Cdc42 . Rho GTPases regulate the actin nucleation process to initiate actin polymerization at the site that Rho GTPases are activated . Active GTP - bound Rho GTPases activate actin nucleation factors either directly or indirectly . For example , Rho1 directly binds to the nucleation factor Formin which promotes actin polymerization to form bundle - like actin 10 structures . Rac1 and Cdc42 instead activate nucleation promotion factors ( NPFs ) first , such as WASP / N - WASP , WAVE ( WASP - family verprolin homology protein ) and SCAR ( S uppressor of cAMP receptor ) , and then NPFs can bind to and activate the nucleation factor Arp2 / 3 protein complex which mediates the branching of actin cytoskeleton from pre - existing F - actin ( Li and Gundersen , 2008 ) . In addition , Rho1 can regulate the assembly of contractile actinomyosin cytoskeleton through Rho kinase . Rho kinase can activate myosin light chain and inhibit myosin light chain phosphatase ( Riento and Ridley , 2003 ) . The actin cytoskeleton can associate with the plasma membrane through actin - binding proteins that directly or indirectly bind to the plasma membrane ( Sechi and Wehland , 2000 ) . Such cellular architecture allows the actin cytoskeleton to model the plasma membrane and localize actin cytoskeleton - dependent cellular processes at specific membrane domains , such as adherens junctions or polarized membrane trafficking . 5 . 2 The actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking . The actin cytoskeleton is essential for various types of membrane trafficking , including endocytosis , exocytosis , endosome trafficking , and vesicular trafficking at the Golgi apparatus ( Lanzetti , 2007 ) . The coupling of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane trafficking is usually controlled by the Rho , Rab and Arf small GTPase families and the large GTPase dynamin . Actin polymerization is important in both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Lanzetti , 2007 ; Romer et al . , 2010 ) . Actin 11 polymerization and its dynamics are involved in several steps of vesicle formation during clathrin - dependent endocytosis , including coated pit formation , tubulation , constriction , and vesicle scission ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Some endocytic proteins directly bind to the actin cytoskeleton , such as intersectin - 1 and HIPs ( Huntingtin interacting proteins ) ( Lanzetti , 2007 ) . Other endocytic proteins can interact with regulators of actin assembly , for instance , cortactin can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ) . Another emerging class of proteins that integrate the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking are BAR domain - containing proteins ( BDPs ) . The BAR domain is a membrane associated domain that can sense and / or induce membrane curvature ( Frost et al . , 2009 ) . BDPs usually have multiple domains . Most BDPs bind to dynamin and some can bind to the Arp2 / 3 activator N - WASP through some of their protein domains . An example is Drosophila Cip4 / Toca - 1 ( Cdc42 interaction protein 4 ) , which was shown to integrate membrane trafficking and actin dynamics through WASP and SCAR / WAVE ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . The actin cytoskeleton also plays a critical role in exocytosis , including stabilizing the docking of exocytic vesicles to facilitate the closure of exocytic fusion pores ( Lanzetti , 2007 ) . Exo70 , a component of the exocyst complex responsible for exocytosis , was shown to bind to Arp2 / 3 ( Zuo et al . , 2006 ) . Other than endocytosis and exocytosis at the plasma membrane , the actin cytoskeleton also drives vesicle movement . Actin can assemble into the actin “comet tail” on one side of endosomes which probably propels the vesicles 12 to move short distances ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , myosin motor proteins can transport cargoes along the actin cytoskeleton ( Apodaca et al . , 2001 ) 5 . 3 General functions of the actin cytoskeleton in epithelia . Besides its function in membrane trafficking , the actin cytoskeleton also plays other roles in various cellular processes . In the epithelia , the actin cytoskeleton forms a circumferential belt underneath AJs to support cell junctions so that epithelial tissues can resist mechanical forces without falling apart ( Lecuit and Lenne , 2007 ) . Together with myosin , the actin cytoskeleton can also facilitate cell shape change during epithelial development , such as cell intercalation during convergent extension and apical constriction of cells during tissue invagination ( discussed in detail below ) . 6 . Bazooka and epithelial cell polarity 6 . 1 Baz : a key regulator of epithelial cell polarity . Baz is an evolutionarily conserved scaffold protein with three conserved regions ( CR ) ( Figure 2 ) . CR1 at the N - terminus allows the oligomerization of Baz / PAR - 3 . Three PDZ domains in CR2 mediate protein - protein interactions . The kinase domain of aPKC can bind to CR3 close to the C - terminus ( St Johnston and Ahringer , 2010 ) . The positioning of Baz on the plasma membrane of epithelial cells is subject to various regulatory mechanisms . Recent work revealed that Baz contains a C - 13 Figure 2 . Domain architecture of Baz and its interaction partners in Drosophila . The oligomerization domain allows self oligomerization ( Benton and St Johnston , 2003A ) . The first PDZ domain binds to PAR - 6 ( Petronczki and Knoblich , 2001 ; Morais - de - Sa et al . , 2010 ) . The three PDZ domains interact with C - terminus of Armadillo and Echinoid ( Wei et al . , 2005 ) . The third PDZ domain binds to PTEN . The C - terminal aPKC binding site binds to the kinase domain of aPKC ( Morais - de - Sa et al . , 2010 ) . The C - terminal membrane targeting motif binds to phospholipids . Abbreviations : aPKC ( atypical Protein Kinase C ) , Arm ( Armadillo ) , CR ( Conserved region ) , Ed ( Echinoid ) OD ( Oligomerization domain ) , PDZ ( PSD95 / Dlg / ZO - 1 domain ) , PIPs ( phospholipids ) , PTEN ( Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 ) . 14 Figure 2 . Domain architecture of Baz and its interaction partners in Drosophila . 15 terminal phospholipid binding site involved in membrane targeting ( Krahn et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , Baz is positioned below its typical interaction partners aPKC and Par - 6 in Drosophila epithelial cells ( Harris and Peifer , 2005 ) . The exclusion of Baz from the apical surface membrane involves phosphorylation of Baz by aPKC and competitive binding of Par - 6 by Crb ( Morais - de - Sa et al . , 2010 ) . Baz is also excluded from the basolateral domain by PAR - 1 kinase . In particular , PAR - 1 phosphorylates Baz and thereby inhibits its oligomerization and the formation of Baz / PAR - 6 / aPKC polarity complex ( Benton and St Johnston , 2003B ) . As a key regulator of ECP , Baz recruits both AJ components and polarity proteins . It functions as an early apical polarity cue upstream of AJs in Drosophila embryonic primary epithelia . Baz was shown to recruit DE - cadherin and Armadillo ( Drosophila β - catenin homologue ) to the apical cortex for spot adherens junction ( precursor of AJ belt ) assembly in Drosophila cellularizing embryos ( Harris and Peifer , 2004 ) . It also recruited polarity protein Crb to the apical cortex ( Bilder et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , Baz regulates cytoskeletal organization by localizing Bitesize which can recruit the actin - binding protein Moesin to form a continuous actin belt to stabilize AJs ( Pilot et al . , 2006 ) . Baz may also regulate ECP through phospholipid asymmetry and signaling . Specifically , the third PDZ domain of Baz can bind to the lipid phosphatase PTEN that converts PIP 3 to PIP 2 ( von Stein et al . , 2005 ) , indicating Baz may help generate phospholipid asymmetry and integrate phosphoinositide signaling in ECP . 16 6 . 2 Identification of baz - interacting genes in Drosophila embryonic epidermis To identify novel baz - interacting genes in Drosophila embryonic epithelia , our lab previously performed a baz modifier screen on the second and third chromosomes ( Figure 3A and B ) . Using deficiency mapping , bioinformatics and available single mutant fly lines , we were able to identify 17 candidate genes which significantly enhanced the cuticle phenotype of baz zygotic mutant embryos ( CG30372 ( dASAP ) shown as an example in Figure 3C ) . These genes encode known and putative polarity , signaling , cytoskeletal , transmembrane , and trafficking proteins . Most of them were linked to ECP for the first time . Interestingly , both Arf79F ( the Drosophila ADP ribosylation factor 1 , dArf1 ) and the Arf1 GAP homologue CG30372 ( dASAP ) were found in this screen ( Shao et al . , 2010 ) . 17 Figure 3 . baz genetic modifier screen for novel baz - interacting genes in Drosophila embryonic epithelia .

ADP Ribosylation Factors 7 . 1 The structure of ADP ribosylation factors . ADP Ribosylation Factors ( Arfs ) are well - conserved small GTPases of the Ras superfamily . Arf GTPases exist as either GTP - bound forms ( active ) or GDP - bound forms ( inactive ) . The cycling between these two states determines the activity of Arf GTPases . Core members of the Arf GTPase family are divided into three classes based on sequence similarity . They also share several common structural features : a myristoyl group usually linked to the N - terminal amphipathic helix and an interswitch region between two switch regions . All these features are important for coupling GTP binding of Arf GTPases with their membrane association : upon GTP binding , the N - terminal amphipathic helix is released from a hydrophobic pocket by the interswitch region , and inserted together with the N - terminal myristoyl group into the membrane . Once GTP is hydrolyzed , the GDP - bound Arf GTPase spontaneously dissociates from membranes without the help of GDP displacement inhibitors , in contrast to other small GTPases . Therefore , Arf GTPases exert their functions when they are membrane - bound ( Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . 7 . 2 Classical Functions of Arf GTPases . Arf GTPases generally regulate membrane trafficking and cellular organelle structures . To do so , Arf GTPases recruit coat proteins , manipulate phospholipid metabolism and regulate the actin cytoskeleton . By localizing to different cellular compartments , each member of the Arf GTPase family interacts with a distinct 20 set of effectors to perform unique functions ( D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier , 2006 ) . Here I briefly discuss the functions of two best characterized Arf GTPases : Arf1 and Arf6 . Arf1 is typically associated with the Golgi apparatus to regulate the early secretory membrane transport and maintain the structure of the Golgi apparatus . To regulate the secretory pathway , Arf1 usually recruits different coat proteins / adaptor proteins to budding vesicles at particular vesicular compartments . In particular , COPI is recruited by Arf1 for vesicle budding at cis - Golgi in retrograde vesicle transport to ER ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , clathrin - coated vesicle formation at trans - Golgi and late endosomes is regulated by Arf1 - dependent recruitment of adaptor proteins AP - 1 / 3 / 4 and GGA ( Kirchhausen , 2000 ; Bonifacino , 2004 ) . In addition to coat proteins , the actin cytoskeleton also plays pronounced roles in vesicle trafficking . Arf1 has also been shown to stimulate actin polymerization at the site for vesicle budding : Arf1 recruits GTP - bound Cdc42 which subsequently binds ABP1 and N - WASP to initiate the actin assembly machinery in Golgi - ER trafficking , while it recruits cortactin and dynamin - 2 for actin assembly in post - Golgi transport ( D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier , 2006 ) . Moreover , some evidence suggests Arf1 modulates local lipid metabolism to facilitate vesicle formation . Arf1 can bind to phospholipase D which produces phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , and PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinase which produces PIP 2 , lipid species implicated in membrane trafficking ( Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2006 ) . 21 In contrast to Arf1 , Arf6 primarily regulates the endocytic pathway at the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes , and actin cytoskeleton remodeling at the cell periphery . Arf6 is shown to be critical for internalization of ligands through multiple endocytic pathways ( D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier , 2006 ) . Arf6 can regulate clathrin - dependent endocytosis through direct binding to protein factors in vesicle formation . For example , Arf6 is known to recruit a nucleoside diphosphate kinase NM23 - H1 to supply dynamin with GTP for vesicle fission ( Palacios et al . , 2002 ) . Similar to Arf1 , Arf6 may also modulate phospholipid metabolism at the cell surface to promote clathrin - dependent endocytosis . ( Brown et al . , 1993 ; Honda et al . , 1999 ; Paleotti et al . , 2005 ; Jovanovic et al . , 2006 ) . Arf6 can also interact with components of the exocyst complex to deliver membrane proteins to the cell surface . Through these mechanisms , Arf6 functions in cell migration , formation of specialized membrane protrusions / extensions ( e . g . invadopodia , membrane ruffles , and pseudopodia ) , and phagocytosis ( Palaclois et al . , 2001 ; Radhakrishna et al . , 1996 ; Hashimoto et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . 7 . 3 Regulators of Arf GTPase Activity : Arf Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors and Arf GTPase - activating Proteins . The activity of Arf GTPases depends on their association with GTP or GDP , which is regulated by Arf Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Arf GEFs ) and Arf GTPase - activating proteins ( Arf GAPs ) ( Figure 4 ) . The inactive GDP - bound Arf GTPase is activated by Arf GEFs through replacement of GDP with GTP . 22 Figure 4 . The Arf GTPase cycle . Arf GTPases cycle between the active GTP - bound form and the inactive GDP - bound form . This is regulated by Arf GEFs and Arf GAPs . Arf GEFs replace GDP with GTP in order to activate Arf GTPases . While Arf GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis of Arf GTPases in order to inactivate Arf GTPases . Abbreviation : Arf GAP ( Arf GTPase - activating protein ) Arf GEF ( Arf Guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) , GDP ( Guanosine diphosphate ) , GTP ( Guanosine 5’ - trisphosphate ) . 23 Figure 4 . The Arf GTPase cycle . 24 When the active GTP - bound Arf GTPase needs to be turned off , the low intrinsic GTPase activity of Arf GTPase is stimulated to hydrolyze GTP into GDP by Arf GAPs . Each Arf GEF or Arf GAP has its own Arf specificity and localizes to specific cellular compartments ( e . g . the plasma membrane , Golgi apparatus or endosomes ) . This is thought to control the activity of each Arf GTPase at particular cellular compartments ( D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier , 2006 ) . Arf GEF proteins usually have a Sec7 domain which is responsible for catalyzing the conversion from GDP to GTP . Arf GEFs can be classified into the following families with different additional domains : GBF , BIG , PSD , IQSEC , Cytohesin , FBXO8 , and Sec12 ( the Sec12 family has no Sec7 domain ) ( Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . Arf GAP proteins can be categorized into several families based on their domain architecture : ArfGAP1 , ArfGAP2 , ADAP , SMAP , AGFG , GIT , ACAP , AGAP , ASAP , and ARAP ( Kahn et al . , 2008 ) . Since most Arf GEF and Arf GAP proteins have multiple functional domains other than the GAP or Sec7 domain , they may be functionally versatile . Some domains may help localize these regulators to specific cellular compartments . For example , PH domains are common in both Arf GEFs and Arf GAPs and can target them to plasma membrane domains enriched with particular phospholipid species ( Macia et al . , 2008 ) . Other domains of Arf GAP proteins may facilitate the corresponding Arf GTPases in vesicle formation . The ALPS motifs can sense membrane curvature and help ArfGAP1 family members bind to Arf GTPases at the vesicle budding site . The BAR domains of ACAP and ASAP proteins sense or even create membrane curvatures at the site of vesicle formation . The SH3 domains 25 and Proline - rich regions containing SH3 domain binding motif in some Arf GAP proteins mediate SH3 domain - dependent protein - protein interactions . Other domains may help integrate signaling pathways : the ARAP protein family possess both an Arf GAP domain and a Rho GAP domain pointing towards integration of Arf and Rho signalings ( Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . 7 . 4 Arf GTPases / Arf regulators and epithelial cell polarity . Regulation of cellular processes at the plasma membrane is important for the cell polarity machinery . Although Arf1 usually performs its function at the Golgi , there is increasing evidence suggesting that Arf1 may also localize to and / or affect cellular processes at the plasma membrane . Overexpression of the Arf1 GEF ARNO relocalized Arf1 to the plasma membrane ( Vitale et al . , 2002 ) . In another case , an Arf1 mutant resistant to GTP hydrolysis relocalized to the plasma membrane ( Luo et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests Arf1 - GTP may be only transiently present at the plasma membrane in the presence of its regulators . Moreover , the active Arf1 was present at distinct puncta on the plasma membrane and regulated dynamin - independent endocytosis in mammalian cell culture ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . In polarized cells , Arf1 seems to function at the apical domain . Recently , our work showed that dArf1 : : GFP was weakly present at the apical circumference of epithelial cells in the Drosophila embryo ( Shao et al . , 2010 ) . Consistently , human Arf1 was shown to be localized at the apical domain of renal epithelia cells ( El Annan et al . , 2004 ) . In rhabdomere biogenesis of Drosophila , enhanced dArf1 activity disrupted apical membrane 26 transport ( Raghu et al . , 2008 ) . Thus Arf1 may exert its effect on ECP through its function at the Golgi apparatus and / or the plasma membrane . Similar to Arf1 , Arf6 also has polarized cellular distributions and activities . Drosophila Arf6 : : GFP was localized to basolateral puncta along the cell cortex with exclusion from the apical domain in Drosophila embryonic epithelia ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . In the human kidney , the localization of Arf6 is context - dependent . In the proximal tubule it is apically enriched , whereas in the collecting tubule it is primarily localized to the basolateral domain ( Annan et al . , 2003 ) . Arf6 recruits NM23H1 to stimulate dynamin - dependent endocytosis of E - cadherin in mammalian cell culture ( Palacios et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , recent work placed the activation of Arf6 downstream of PAR - 3 in AJ assembly in mammalian cell culture ( Ikenouchi and Umeda , 2010 ) . 8 . ASAP ( Arf GTPase - activating protein with SH3 domain , Ankyrin Repeat and PH domain ) The ASAP family has three members ( ASAP1 , ASAP2 and ASAP3 ) in vertebrates , only one in other metazoans ( including Drosophila ) , and none in lower eukaryotes ( Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . They are scaffold proteins with six functional domains / motifs ; from N - terminus to C - terminus a BAR domain , PH domain , ArfGAP domain , Ankyrin repeat region ( AKR ) , Proline - rich region and SH3 domain ( Figure 5 ) . Arf1 appears to be one substrate of the GAP activity of ASAP1 . In vitro biochemical assays showed that ASAP catalyzed GTP hydrolysis on Arf1 and 27 Arf5 , and to a lesser extent on Arf6 ( Kam et al . , 2000 ) . In vivo , siRNA - mediated knock - down of ASAP1 increased cellular levels of Arf1 - GTP ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) , and a GTP - hydrolysis resistant Arf1 mutant altered the localization of ASAP1 at the plasma membrane ( Luo et al . , 2005 ) . Among the three members of the vertebrate ASAP family , ASAP1 is the best studied . In mammalian cell culture , ASAP1 localizes to focal adhesions and membrane ruffles , and also to the perinuclear reticulate network ( Randazzo et al . , 2000 ; Brown et al . , 1998 ) , suggesting a role at the plasma membrane and in post - Golgi trafficking . Specific ASAP1 domains are implicated in regulating membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 5 ) . Both in vitro and in vivo membrane tubulation studies show that its BAR domain creates membrane curvatures ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) . This BAR domain also functions in trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , the BAR domain can bind to the Rab11 effector , FIP3 and regulate Rab11 - mediated trafficking ( Inoue et al . , 2008 ) . The BAR domain may also autoinhibit the GAP activity of ASAP1 through intramolecular interaction with the PH domain and / or the GAP domain ( Jian et al . , 2008 ) . The PH domain adjacent to the BAR domain of ASAP1 seems to interact with lipids at the membrane . The PH domain can bind to various phospholipids in vitro ( Kruljac - Letunic et al . , 2003 ) . Both PA and PIP 2 function as allosteric activators of GAP domain activity through the PH domain based on an in vitro enzyme assay ( Brown et al . , 1998 ) . The PH domain may also transiently interact 28 Figure 5 . Domain architectures and alignment of dASAP and human ASAP1 , and interaction partners of human ASAP1 . Sequence similarity of each domain between dASAP and human ASAP1 are indicated as positive residues / total residues and the corresponding percentage . Both identical residues and residues of conservative substitution are considered as positive . In human ASAP1 , the BAR domain can bind to Rab11FIP3 . The PH domain interacts with phospholipids . The GAP domain binds to Arf GTPases . The proline - rich region binds to the SH3 domain of CIN85 , CD2AP , Cortactin , Src and CrkL . The SH3 domain interacts with FAK , Pyk2 and APC . Abbreviations : AKR ( Ankyrin repeat ) , APC ( Adenomatous polyposis coli ) , Arf ( ADP ribosylation factor ) , BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs domain ) , CD2AP ( CD2 - associated protein ) , CIN85 ( Cbl interaction protein of 85 kDa ) , CrkL ( Crk - like protein ) , FAK ( Focal adhesion kinase ) , GAP ( GTPase - activating protein domain ) , PH ( Pleckstrin homology domain ) , PIPs ( phospholipids ) , Pyk2 ( Proline - rich tyrosine kinase 2 ) , Rab11FIP3 ( Rab11 family interaction protein 3 ) , SH3 ( Src homology 3 domain ) , Src ( Sarcoma kinase ) . 29 Figure 5 . Domain architectures and alignment of dASAP and human ASAP1 , and interaction partners of human ASAP1 . 30 with the GAP domain and contribute to the GAP activity by positioning Arf1 - GTP ( Luo et al . , 2008 ) . Together with the GAP domain , the Ankyrin repeats seem to form a relatively rigid structure and thus contribute to the overall structural stability ( Martin and Jackson , 2005 ) . ASAP1 also has a proline - rich region ( an SH3 domain binding motif ) and an SH3 domain at its C - terminus , offering a versatile platform for SH3 domain - mediated protein - protein interactions . The C - terminal region appears to physically link ASAP1 to important players in various cellular activities including membrane trafficking and organization of actin cytoskeleton especially organization of actin - based cellular structures like invadopodia and focal adhesions . The proline - rich region contains binding motifs for the SH3 domains of CIN85 ( Kowanetz et al . , 2004 ) , CD2AP ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) , and Cortactin ( Onodera et al . , 2005 ) : CIN85 is an adaptor protein that is important in clathrin - dependent endocytosis and F - actin bundling ( Gaidos et al . , 2007 ) ; CD2AP is a scaffold protein that can bind to and regulate actin cytoskeleton ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) ; Cortactin is an important component of invadopodia in addition to its role in vesicle scission during endocytosis ( Onodera et al . , 2005 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) . The proline - rich region also binds to critical signaling proteins including Src ( Brown et al . , 1998 ) and CrkL ( Oda et al . , 2002 ) . The SH3 domain can bind to the proline - rich region of Focal adhesion kinase ( Liu et al . , 2002 ) and the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 ( Kruljac - Letunic et al . , 2003 ) and to the SAMP motif of APC , a microtubule binding protein and a component of Wnt signaling ( Kaieda et al . , 2010 ) . 31 Deregulation of ASAP1 expression has been linked to multiple types of cancer ( Ehlers et al . , 2005 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; Muller et al . , 2010 ) . In particular , overexpression of ASAP1 stimulated metastasis ( Muller et al . , 2010 ) possibly through promoting the formation of cellular structures like invadopodia and focal adhesions ( Onodera et al . , 2005 ) . Since ASAP1 interacts with the oncogenes Src ( Brown et al . , 1998 ) and CrkL ( Oda et al . , 2002 ) and the tumor suppressor APC ( Kaieda et al . , 2010 ) , it is also possible that upregulation of ASAP1 alters the activity of these proteins . 9 . Drosophila embryonic epithelia as a model to study the role of dASAP in epithelial cell polarity Since ASAP proteins have not been studied in adherent cells or any intact organism , Drosophila embryonic primary epithelia may serve as an excellent model to study its role in actin cytoskeleton assembly and membrane trafficking in regulating epithelial cell polarity . After fertilization , the single - celled Drosophila embryo starts thirteen cycles of syncytial cell divisions ( nuclear division without cytokinesis ) . Nuclei migrate to the embryo periphery after nine cycles of divisions . At the end of thirteen cycles of divisions , cellularization begins with the invagination of plasma membrane to separate each nucleus into individual cells eventually forming an epithelial monolayer ( Figure 1A ) . During this process , the actin cytoskeleton is enriched at the furrow canal , the basal most part of the growing membrane , where it is coupled with endocytic events ( Sokac and Wieschaus , 2008A ; Sokac and 32 Wieschaus , 2008B ) . Exocytosis is also essential for lateral membrane growth ( Pelissier et al . , 2003 ; Murthy et al . , 2010 ) . After cellularization , epithelial cells have fully formed ( Figure 1B ) . The onset of ventral furrow formation marks the beginning of gastrulation . In this process , a stripe of cells along the ventral midline of the early Drosophila embryo invaginates to form the mesoderm . This is initiated with apical constriction . Actinomyosin meshworks attach to AJs and undergo periodic cycles of assembly and disassembly to drive constriction of the apical domain ( Martin et al . , 2010 ; Martin et al . , 2009 ) . Shortly after the initiation of ventral furrow formation , the germband along the lateral side of the embryo starts to extend to the dorsal side of the embryo . This occurs through convergent extension . The germband extends its length along the anterior - posterior ( A - P ) axis with simultaneous narrowing along the dorsal - ventral axis ( D - V ) . This is primarily driven by cell intercalation , in which cell - cell contacts are shortened along the A - P axis and lengthened along the D - V axis . To initiate the first step of cell intercalation , cortical actinomyosin becomes enriched at the cell borders along the A - P axis to drive shortening of the cell - cell contacts ( Harris and Tepass , 2010 ) . When the germband is almost fully extended , the neuroectoderm on either side of the midline starts extensive delamination of neuroblast cells , which requires substantial junctional remodeling to fill up the gaps left in the epidermis . Therefore , it requires continuous turnover of AJs by vesicle trafficking ( Harris and Tepass , 2008 ) . 33 During germband extension , an extraembryonic tissue called amnioserosa forms . It covers the dorsal side when the germband retracts from the dorsal side of the embryo . Then the embryo goes through dorsal closure in which the lateral epidermal cells elongate and cover the amnioserosa . Similar to the invaginating cells at the ventral furrow , amnioserosa cells apically constrict as well . Interestingly , recent work identified an analogous role of actinomyosin meshwork in apical constriction of amnioserosa cells during dorsal closure of Drosophila embryogenesis ( Solon et al . , 2009 ; David et al . , 2010 ) . This change accompanied by organogenesis and further development leads to hatching of the larvae . In summary , Drosophila embryonic epithelial cells constantly remodel the plasma membrane , AJs and the actin cytoskeleton to drive and to accommodate morphogenesis . Therefore , Drosophila embryonic epithelia is a great model to study how dASAP may regulate epithelial cell polarity through actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking . 10 . Objectives My thesis project began with the completion of a baz genetic interaction screen through localizing fifteen candidates as GFP fusion proteins . Then I sought to test the role ( s ) of a top candidate , dASAP , in epithelial cell polarity in Drosophila with three major objectives . First , to determine when and where dASAP might interact with major polarity players , I defined the localization of dASAP throughout embryonic development after generating GFP fusion proteins 34 and an anti - dASAP antibody . Second , to study how loss of dASAP function affects epithelial cell polarity , I used imprecise P - element excision to generate a deletion allele of dASAP . Third , to study how each of the six functional domains of dASAP contributes to its subcellular localization and functions , I generated transgenic fly lines with constructs deleting each domain . My work reveals associations between dASAP , actin and the apical domain . The six domains appear to act redundantly to localize dASAP , although interactions between domains affecting the degree of membrane association are apparent . Future work is required to determine the role of dASAP in ECP . 35 MATERIALS AND METHODS 1 . Drosophila stocks Table I .

Gene cloning and transgenics For cloning the 15 candidate genes , cDNAs were obtained from the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Center and Drosophila Genomic Resource Center . The coding region with partial 5’ UTR of cDNA clones were amplified by PCR ( please refer to Appendix I for more details ) , cloned into pENTR2B gateway entry vectors and recombined into pPWG . attB or pPGW . attB gateway destination vectors to add an upstream UAS sequence and GFP tag at either the N - terminus ( pPGW . attB ) or the C - terminus ( pPWG . attB ) . For cloning the deletion constructs , forward and reverse primers with NgoMIV restriction sites ( please refer to Appendix I for more details ) were used to flank the deletion region in opposite directions on pENTR2B - dASAP - N . Then the rest of the sequence was PCR - amplified with Phusion DNA polymerase ( Finnzymes ) . The amplified fragment with the region of interest deleted was digested by NgoMIV ( New England Biolabs ) and self ligated by T4 DNA ligase ( Fermentas ) . The pENTR2B constructs with the deletion were recombined into pPGW . attB gateway destination vectors to add an upstream UAS sequence and GFP tag at the N - terminus . Transgenic flies were generated by Genetic Services Inc . with transgenes inserted into the attp2 site . To examine embryos at early embryogenesis , transgenic lines were crossed to matα - Gal4 - VP16 females for imaging embryos of the F2 generation . To examine embryos at late embryogenesis , transgenic lines were crossed to act5C - Gal4 females for imaging embryos of the F1 generation . 43 5 . Antibody production The coding region for the PH domain of dASAP ( a . a . 300 - 414 , including 10 extra a . a . beyond each border of the PH domain ) was amplified by PCR ( please refer to Appendix I for more details ) and cloned into pGEX6P - 1 vector to add a N - terminal GST tag . GST - PH fusion protein was expressed in transformed E . coli strain BL21 and purified using a GST affinity column . The expression and stability of GST - PH protein was assessed by SDS - PAGE . The yield of GST - PH protein was assessed by Bradford protein assay . Two rabbits and two guinea pigs were injected with GST fusion proteins according to an injection scheme ( please refer to Appendix II ) . The anti - serums were obtained through the Animal Facility at the Department of Cell and Systems Biology , University of Toronto . 6 . Embryo staining and treatment In sample preparation , 4 - hour collection of embryos is used to examine early embryogenesis . 12 - hour collection of embryos is used to examine late embryogenesis . For the heat fixation method was adopted from Muller and Wieschaus ( 1996 ) . For immunofluorescence staining with heat fixation , embryos were firstly dechorionated in 50 % bleach and washed with 68 mM NaCl / 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Then embryos were transferred to hot 68 mM NaCl / 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in boiling water for 5 seconds before incubation on ice with cold 68 mM NaCl / 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . After removing all liquids , embryos were de - vitellinized by 1 : 1 heptane : methanol / 5 % EGTA and incubated on ice with methanol / 5 % EGTA for 2 hours . Embryos were rinsed twice with methanol / 5 % EGTA before 44 blocking . For immunofluorescence staining with formaldehyde fixation , embryos were firstly dechorionated in 50 % bleach and washed with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . For staining with phalloidin , embryos were fixed for 10 minutes in 1 : 1 10 % formaldehyde in PBS / heptane and de - vitellinized by hand peeling . For other staining , embryos were fixed for 20 minutes in 1 : 1 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS / heptane and de - vitellinized by methanol . Then embryos were incubated in the block solution containing PBS / 1 % normal goat serum ( NGS ) / 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 1 . 5 hours . All antibodies were diluted in NGS block solution as listed in Table IV . The embryos were stained with the primary antibody mixture overnight at 4°C and then with the secondary antibody mixture for 2 hours at room temperature . To compare the immunofluorescence level of anti - dASAP antibody between GFP - histone and Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 / CyO , TwiGFP lines , 12 - hour collections of embryos from each line were mixed and processed as a single sample in subsequent immunostaining procedures . The cytochalasin D treatment was adapted from Harris and Peifer ( 2005 ) . Dechorionated embryos were washed twice with 0 . 9 % NaCl and incubated in 1 : 1 octane / 10 μg / ml cytochalasin D ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in 0 . 9 % NaCl for 30 min at room temperature with nutation . After removing all liquids , embryos were washed twice with heptane before fixation with formaldehyde . The working solution of cytochalasin D was prepared freshly from a 1 mg / ml solution in DMSO . For the control , the embryos were treated with DMSO only . 45 7 . Image acquisition and manipulation For immunofluorescence imaging , stained embryos were mounted in Aqua PolyMount solution ( Polysciences ) and imaged with a Quorum spinning disk confocal microscope ( Quorum Technologies ) with a Hamamatsu EM CCD camera and Volocity software ( Improvision ) . Images were collected at room temperature with a 63X ( Plan - Apochromat ; NA 1 . 4 ) objective and a piezo top plate . Z stacks were collected with a spacing of 0 . 3 μm . Xcite epifluorescence was used for genotyping of embryos For time - lapse microscopy , embryos were dechorionated in 50 % bleach and washed in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and then mounted in halocarbon oil ( series 700 ; Halocarbon Products ) on a gas permeable membrane dish ( petriPERM ; Sigma ) . Live embryos were imaged using the previously - mentioned spinning disk confocal microscope with the same setup . The autofluorescent vitelline membrane of the embryo was used as a marker for the apical surface of the cells found just underneath it . All images for immunofluorescence and live imaging , unless otherwise stated , are deconvolved by Volocity software ( Improvision ) before analysis . 8 . Generation of new mutant alleles of dASAP The P element was mobilized by crossing the insertion line ( dASAP KG03963 ) to the transposase line females ( wg / CyO ; Δ2 - 3 , Sb / TM6 ) . Individual mosaic - eyed males from the F1 generation were crossed to the balancer line Gla / CyO . P element excised lines were established by crossing single white - eyed males of 46 the F2 generation to the balancer line Gla / CyO . Adult flies were then genotyped by PCR using a three - primer strategy ( please refer to Figure 20 for more details of the strategy and Appendix I for more details of the primers ) . Briefly , the forward primer binds to the sequence upstream of the P element insertion site . The reverse primer binds to the sequence downstream of P element insertion site . The universal primer binds to the inverted repeats at each border of the P element . The upstream amplicon of 0 . 56 kb is to detect upstream deletions , and the downstream amplicon of 0 . 98 kb is to detect downstream deletions . When the P element is absent or precisely excised , the whole amplicon is 1 . 54 kb . If the excision happened precisely , only the band at 1 . 54 kb would appear . If the excision was imprecise and happened within the P element , at least two bands at 0 . 56 kb and 0 . 98 kb would appear . If an upstream deletion happened , the band at 0 . 56 kb would be absent . If a downstream deletion happened , the band at 0 . 98 kb would disappear . If the deletion happened at both sides , the two bands at 0 . 56 kb and 0 . 98 kb would disappear , but the presence of extra band ( s ) depends on the extent of the deletion . If a balancer chromosome is present , it contributes to the band at 1 . 54 kb . After detecting the deletion , the size of the deletion was mapped by PCR with the same forward primer paired with two different reverse primers respectively . In particular , the amplicon between the forward primer ( FP ) and the first reverse primer ( RP1 ) is 2 . 57 kb , which can detect a deletion up to 2 . 57 kb . The amplicon between the forward primer and a further downstream reverse primer ( RP2 ) is 5 . 76 kb , which allows for detecting a deletion ranging 47 from 2 . 57 kb to 5 . 76 kb . The region covering the deletion was amplified by the closest pair of primers and sequenced to define the deleted region . 48 RESULTS 1 . Subcellular localizations of candidate proteins identified from the genetic screen Among 17 candidates from the baz genetic interaction screen , the subcellular localizations of Rho1 ( Magie et al . , 2002 ; Fox et al . , 2005 ) and PAR - 1 ( Bayraktar et al . , 2006 ) have been previously described . Therefore , to determine the localization of the other 15 candidates ( please refer to Table II for the list of fifteen candidates ) , I tagged the candidate proteins with GFP at the C - terminus , and used the UAS - Gal4 system to express the fusion protein ubiquitously . Then I examined the subcellular localization of GFP tagged proteins in lateral epidermal cells at dorsal closure . Five candidate proteins ( CG30372 , Arf79F , CG11210 , Sds22 , and Sep5 ) showed specific localizations at the apical cortex . Compared to the mid - lateral section , CG30372 : : GFP was enriched at the apical circumference ( Figure 6A , white arrow ) and apical surface puncta ( Figure 6A , yellow arrow ) . Similarly , Arf79F : : GFP was localized weakly at the apical circumference ( Figure 6B white arrow ) , and large puncta throughout cytosol ( Figure 6B , yellow arrow ) . CG11210 : : GFP also accumulated in the apical circumference ( Figure 6C , white arrow ) and apical surface puncta ( Figure 6C , yellow arrow ) . In addition , large cytoplasmic puncta ( Figure 6C , cyan arrow ) were found in mid - lateral sections . Despite high cytosolic fluorescence , Sds22 : : GFP was enriched at the apical circumference ( Figure 6D , white arrow ) . Septin 5 was localized weakly along the 49 apical circumference in a punctate pattern ( Figure 6E , white arrow ) with cytoplasmic puncta ( Figure 6E , yellow arrow ) . Nine other candidates showed specific localization patterns , and one , Cul5 : : GFP did not exhibit any fluorescence in the transgenic line . CG1951 : : GFP labeled cytoplasmic puncta of various sizes ( Figure 6F , yellow arrow ) . Fj : : GFP was localized to small cytoplasmic puncta ( Figure 6G , yellow arrow ) which is consistent with its known localization to the Golgi apparatus ( Ishikawa et al . , 2008 ) . Alt : : GFP , CG5823 : : GFP , and CG10702 : : GFP shared similar subcellular localizations to large intracellular compartments ( Figure 6H , I , J respectively , yellow arrow in H ) and the nuclear envelope ( Figure 6H , I , J respectively , cyan arrows ) suggesting endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) localization . However , in contrast to the relatively even distribution of fluorescence in CG5823 : : GFP and CG10702 : : GFP , Alt : : GFP was concentrated more locally inside cells ( Figure 6H , note the bright patches ) . hk : : GFP highlighted cellular compartments with GFP - negative centers ( Figure 6K , yellow arrow ) consistent with its know localization to multivesicular bodies ( Kramer and Phistry , 1996 ) . Asp : : GFP was weakly present along parallel linear structures ( Figure 6L , yellow arrow ) . Muskelin : : GFP was in cytosol ( Figure 6M ) . Roc2 was cytosolic with nuclear enrichment ( Figure 6N ) . Since CG30372 was enriched at the apical circumference and apical surface puncta at late embryogenesis , I chose this candidate to further characterize its subcellular localization throughout embryonic development . Based on the sequence similarity to human ASAP1 , CG30372 was renamed as dASAP 50 ( D rosophila A rf GTPase - activating protein with S H3 domain , A nkyrin Repeat and P H domain ) ( Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . 51 Figure 6 .

Subcellular localization of dASAP with GFP tagged protein throughout embryonic development To examine the subcellular localization of dASAP throughout embryogenesis , I analyzed dASAP tagged with GFP at either the N - terminus or C - terminus . 2 . 1 GFP : : dASAP colocalizes with F - actin during cellularization . At cellularization , GFP : : dASAP was enriched basally along the invaginating membrane ( Figure 7A , red arrow ) . To determine which cellular structure GFP : : dASAP localized to , I stained the GFP : : dASAP embryos for F - actin . GFP : : dASAP localized to F - actin positive puncta at the apical surface , presumably the apical microvilli ( Figure 7A - C , white arrows ) . GFP : : dASAP also colocalized with F - actin at the basal furrow canals ( Figure 7A - C , red arrows ) . 2 . 2 GFP : : dASAP gradually accumulates apically from cellularization to gastrulation . To determine when GFP : : dASAP starts to accumulate apically , I live imaged GFP : : dASAP embryos through early embryogenesis . As previously mentioned , GFP : : dASAP was enriched at the basal furrow canals ( Figure 8A , red arrow ) during cellularization . At stage 6 , GFP : : dASAP appeared at the lateral cell circumference ( Figure 8B , red brackets ) and apical surface puncta ( Figure 8B , green arrow ) , however the fluorescence was relatively equal along lateral membranes ( Figure 8B , white bracket ) . Shortly afterwards at stage 7 , GFP : : dASAP accumulated apically ( Figure 8C , white arrow ) at the cell 54 Figure 7 . GFP : : dASAP colocalizes with F - actin during cellularization .

To see if GFP : : dASAP continues to colocalize with F - actin at late embryogenesis , I analyzed the localization of both proteins in lateral epidermal cells during dorsal closure . GFP : : dASAP colocalized with F - actin at the apical circumference ( Figure 9A - C , brackets ) and partially at the apical surface patch / puncta ( Figure 9A - C , arrows ) , but showed minimal cortical localization just 1 . 2 µm below ( Figure 9A - C at - 1 . 2 µm ) . 2 . 4 GFP : : dASAP generally overlaps with Crumbs and DE - cadherin at the apical domain during dorsal closure . To determine whether GFP : : dASAP colocalizes with other polarity proteins at the apical domain , I examined the localization of the apical polarity protein Crb and the AJ protein DE - cad relative to GFP : : dASAP . Although not fully colocalized , GFP : : dASAP generally overlapped with Crb and DE - cad at the apical circumference ( Figure 10A - D at - 0 . 3 µm ) , and the level of each protein was reduced more basally at - 0 . 9 µm ( Figure 10A - D at - 0 . 9 µm ) . 59 Figure 9 .

GFP : : dASAP generally overlaps with Crumbs and DE - cadherin during dorsal closure . 63 2 . 5 GFP : : dASAP colocalizes with ectopic F - actin after cytochalasin D treatment at gastrulation . Since GFP : : dASAP highly colocalized with F - actin throughout development , it raised the possibility that the localization of GFP : : dASAP may be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton . To assess this issue , I treated GFP : : dASAP transgenic embryos with the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D . I chose to examine embryos at early gastrulation , as the cells in the embryos still retain relatively normal morphology with substantial disruption of the actin cytoskeleton . Cytochalasin D treatment resulted in ectopic cytoplasmic puncta of F - actin ( Figure 11B , arrows ) . GFP : : dASAP was found to colocalize with these puncta ( Figure 11A - C , arrows ) while remaining along the plasma membrane ( Figure 11A , bracket ) . These ectopic puncta were not due to loss of membrane integrity , for Dlg staining was still intact ( Figure 11D ) . The mislocalization of GFP : : dASAP was specific to cytochalasin D treatment , as the DMSO control did not show any ectopic GFP : : dASAP or F - actin puncta ( Figure 11E - G ) . The retention of GFP : : dASAP at the cell circumference may be attributed to F - actin remnants at the same place ( Figure 11B and C , brackets ) . Thus , the localization of GFP : : dASAP is partially dependent on actin . 64 Figure 11 .

GFP : : dASAP colocalizes with ectopic cytoplasmic F - actin puncta after Cytochalasin D treatment of embryos at early gastrulation . 66 2 . 6 GFP : : dASAP and dASAP : : GFP share similar localizations during embryogenesis . Since GFP tags at either the N - terminus or the C - terminus is close to a protein domain of dASAP , it raised the concern about whether the GFP tag may disrupt the correct targeting of dASAP protein . To examine this possibility , I compared the subcellular localization of GFP : : dASAP and dASAP : : GFP . At cellularization , both proteins were localized to and enriched at furrow canals ( Figure 12A and B , white arrows ) . At dorsal closure , both proteins share their localization at the apical circumference ( Figure 12C and D , red brackets ) and surface puncta ( Figure 12C and D , red arrows ) . Therefore , GFP : : dASAP and dASAP : : GFP showed similar subcellular localizations throughout embryogenesis . 67 Figure 12 . dASAP : : GFP has similar subcellular localizations as GFP : : dASAP at both early and late embryogenesis .

Probing the subcellular localization of dASAP with anti - dASAP antibodies To assess the localization of endogenous dASAP by immunofluorescence , I generated anti - dASAP antibodies . 3 . 1 Production of anti - dASAP antibody . To determine which region of dASAP was a suitable immunogen , I performed sequence comparisons of each protein domain versus the Drosophila proteome ( Figure 13A ) . The BAR domain was found to have the least sequence similarity with other Drosophila proteins . However , BAR domains have a high membrane binding affinity and therefore may make the BAR domain insoluble . Therefore , the PH domain with the second least similarity was chosen to produce the antigen . The PH domain was fused with GST , expressed in E . coli , and purified using glutathione resin . SDS - PAGE analysis confirmed a strong expression of GST - PH fusion protein with the expected size of 39 kDa without detectable degradation ( Figure 13B ) . After injecting two rabbits and two guinea pigs with GST - PH , four antisera ( Rb3 , Rb4 , GP1 and GP2 ) were recovered and tested for their use in immunofluorescence . Preimmune sera of the four animals showed no specific staining in WT embryos at either cellularization ( Figure 14A - D ) or dorsal closure ( Figure 14I - L ) . Immunostaining of embryos at cellularization and dorsal closure revealed that Rb4 ( Figure 14F and N ) , GP1 ( Figure 14G and O ) , and GP2 ( Figure 14H and P ) produced specific immunofluorescence signals with similar 70 Figure 13 . Purification of GST - PH fusion protein for generation of anti - dASAP antibodies . ( A ) Sequence similarity of each domain of dASAP against other Drosophila proteins .

Comparison of immunofluorescence signals from different anti - dASAP antibodies at both early and late embryogenesis . 74 patterns . During cellularization , the signals were spotty around the apicolateral circumference ( Figure 14F - H , apicolateral sections ) with residual signals at basal sections ( Figure 14F - H , basal sections ) , unlike GFP : : dASAP ( as discussed in section 3 . 3 ) . At dorsal closure , the signals were smoother and enriched at the apical circumference ( Figure 14N - P , apical sections versus mid - lateral sections ) . In contrast , Rb3 did not exhibit specific signals ( Figure 14E and M ) . Among the 3 working antibodies , Rb4 had the weakest signal at cellularization ( Figure 14F ) and the highest background fluorescence at dorsal closure ( Figure 14N ) . GP1 and GP2 had similar signal strength at cellularization ( Figure 14G and H ) , but GP2 had a lower background fluorescence ( Figure 14P ) at dorsal closure compared to GP1 ( Figure 14O ) . Consequently , GP2 antibody was chosen for subsequent analysis . 3 . 2 The immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody colocalizes with Bazooka and DE - cadherin during embryogenesis . Since the immunofluorescence pattern of anti - dASAP antibody was spotty around the apicolateral circumference at cellularization , it resembled the localization of Baz and DE - cad at the same stage . To determine whether the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody colocalizes with Baz or DE - cad , I co - immunostained wild type embryos with dASAP , Baz and DE - cad . The immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody was confirmed to colocalize with Baz ( Figure 15A - C , white arrows ) as well as with DE - cad ( Figure 15D , red arrow ) in spot adherens junctions ( SAJs ) . However , the immunofluorescence of anti - 75 dASAP antibody and Baz ( Figure 15A - C , green arrows ) did not extend to the basal junctions highlighted by DE - cad ( Figure 15D , green arrow ) . To see whether the colocalization between the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody and Baz holds true at later developmental stages , I examined embryos at dorsal closure . dASAP colocalized with Baz ( Figure 15E - G , white arrows ) and was enriched at the apical circumference ( Figure 15E , apical section versus mid - lateral section ) . The immunofluorescence pattern of anti - dASAP antibody and Baz were less smooth than that of DE - cad at this stage ( Figure 15E - G white arrows versus Figure 15H , red arrow ) . Therefore , these data suggest that the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody colocalized with the immunofluorescence of Baz throughout embryogenesis . 3 . 3 Overexpression of GFP : : dASAP alters the immunofluorescence pattern of anti - dASAP antibody . The localization of GFP tagged dASAP was different from immunofluorescence of dASAP . Specifically , both mark the apicolateral circumference but only the GFP : : dASAP constructs localized to the furrow canals at cellularization and to the apical surface at dorsal closure . Thus , it is important to test whether the antibody is reliable in detecting dASAP . To determine whether the antibody can bind to dASAP protein , I stained GFP : : dASAP transgenic embryos with the antibody . In addition to the localization at apicolateral SAJs ( Figure 16B , white arrows ) , the antibody signal was enriched at the basal furrow canals labeled by GFP : : dASAP ( Figure 16A - C , green arrows ) .

At dorsal closure , the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody was not clearly detected in GFP : : dASAP - positive puncta ( Figure 16I - K , red arrows ) at the apical surface in the transgenic embryo . This suggests the antibody could only bind to GFP : : dASAP to some extent . 3 . 4 Heat fixation changes the immunofluorescence pattern of anti - dASAP antibody at cellularization . Another possibility to explain the difference in dASAP localization between the antibody and GFP results is that the antibodies may not be able to detect all forms of dASAP due to intramolecular interactions masking the epitope ( Jian et al . , 2008 ; Luo et al . , 2008 ) . To attempt to expose all the epitope sites of dASAP , I used heat fixation before staining wild type embryos with the antibody . Interestingly , rather than being restricted at apicolateral SAJs ( Figure 15A - D , green arrows ) , the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody extended to basal junctions marked by Arm ( Figure 17A - C , white brackets ) . However , it seems that the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody did not extend its signal to the furrow canals . This was not due to loss of intact furrow canals after heat fixation , as GFP : : dASAP - marked furrow canals were still preserved after 81 Figure 17 .

Scale bar : 5 μm . 82 Figure 17 . Heat fixation alters the subcellular localization of the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody at cellularization . 83 heat fixation ( Figure 17D - F , white arrows ) . The antibody did not detect the apical surface puncta after heat fixation at dorsal closure ( Figure 17G - I ) . Instead , the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody was dramatically reduced along the anterior - posterior axis in epidermal cells ( Figure 17G - I , red brackets versus Figure 15E - H at apical section ) . The heat fixation experiments suggest differently folded forms of dASAP could not fully account for the difference between GFP : : dASAP and the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody . 3 . 5 The immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody is not decreased in zygotic dASAP deletion mutant embryos at dorsal closure . A third possibility for the discrepancy of localization patterns is that the anti - dASAP antibody may not be specific for dASAP . To test the specificity of anti - dASAP antibody , I mixed late embryos from GFP - histone ( as wild type ) and Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 / CyOTwiGFP lines for immunostaining on the same slide . Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 is a chromosomal deficiency removing the dASAP gene and neighboring genes . GFP - negative embryos ( no CyOTwiGFP balancer or GFP - histone ) were the zygotic deficiency mutants ( Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 / Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 ) , while GFP - histone positive embryos were wild type . These mutant embryos only have half the maternal supply and no zygotic expression of dASAP compared to wild type . Following immunostaining of the embryos , I could not detect any visible difference between wild type and the zygotic deficiency mutant embryos at either early ( Figure 18A versus B ) or late dorsal closure ( Figure 18C versus D ) . This 84 could be explained by two possible reasons : the antibody is not specific enough for dASAP , or that the maternal supply of dASAP is in excess . 3 . 6 The immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody is lost in zygotic baz mutant embryos at dorsal closure . Since the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody colocalized with Baz throughout embryogenesis ( see section 3 . 2 ) , I wondered whether the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody was affected in the absence of Baz . Hence I used a baz Xi106 / FM7 , TwiGFP line ( a zygotic baz mutant line ) to examine the immunofluorescence pattern of dASAP at dorsal closure where the maternal supply of Baz is undetectable by dorsal closure ( Tanentzapf and Tepass , 2003 ) . In wild type like embryos ( FM7 , TwiGFP / FM7 , TwiGFP , FM7 , TwiGFP / Y , or baz Xi106 / FM7 , TwiGFP ) , the signal of dASAP was strong at the apical circumference ( Figure 19A ) . In contrast , the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody was lost in zygotic baz mutant embryos at dorsal closure ( Figure 19B ) . This suggests Baz may be responsible for recruiting dASAP to the apical circumference . However , one concern is that an antibody against Baz was raised at the same time as the ones for dASAP and regenerated glutathione resin exposed to Baz fusion proteins was used to purify the GST - PH fusion protein . As a result , the anti - dASAP antibodies may be contaminated by anti - Baz antibodies . 85 Figure 18 .

Generation of a new mutant allele of dASAP To assess how dASAP affects epithelial cell polarity , I pursued a loss - of - function approach . However , since the original P - element mutant line used in the baz genetic interaction screen was adult viable , I decided to generate a new mutant allele , hoping for a stronger phenotype . In the original mutant line the P element ( KG03963 ) is inserted just upstream of the start codon of the dASAP gene ( Figure 20A ) . Therefore I employed imprecise P element excision to delete the downstream flanking sequence to generate a new mutant allele . To do this , I introduced the transposase source to the original mutant line in order to mobilize the P element . Then I established 400 lines from white - eyed male offspring in the F2 generation ( Figure 20B ) . Using a three - primer PCR genotyping strategy ( adapted from Tepass lab , University of Toronto ) ( Figure 20C ) , I recovered 18 lines with downstream deletions and 23 lines with deletions on both sides . The lines with upstream deletions were excluded as they affect the upstream neighboring gene . After further mapping , the allele of dasap 908WB was found to have a downstream deletion of 1 . 75 kb ( Figure 21A ) . The deletion includes the latter half of the first exon and the first half of the first intron . The deleted portion of the first exon contains the last 33 bps of the 5’ UTR ( Untranslated region ) and 129 bps of the coding region with the start codon . In addition , a partial inverted repeat sequence was present at the junction of the upstream sequence and downstream sequence after deletion ( Figure 21B ) . This new line is adult viable , but may have fertility defects ( see the discussion and future directions section ) . 90 Figure 20 .

The upstream amplicon is 0 . 56 kb and the downstream amplicon is 0 . 98 kb . When P element is absent in wild type or precisely excised , the whole amplicon is 1 . 54 kb .

Subcellular localization of deletion constructs of dASAP To determine how each protein domain of dASAP contributes to its localization and functions , I made six N - terminal GFP - tagged deletion constructs which lack each of the six domains / regions . 5 . 1 All six deletion constructs have similar localizatons to the full length GFP : : dASAP at cellularization and dorsal closure . To assess whether any protein domain is essential to localize dASAP , I analyzed the subcellular localizations of all six deletion constructs at cellularization and dorsal closure . At cellularization , all six deletion constructs retained the localizations similar to the full length GFP : : dASAP ( Figure 12A ) : the localization to ( Figure 22A - F , green brackets ) and being enriched ( Figure 22A - F , white arrows ) at the furrow canals . In addition , GFP : : dASAPΔGAP was mislocalized in tubular structures below furrow canals ( Figure 22C , red arrow ) . GFP : : dASAPΔSH3 appeared weakly at the basolateral membrane with substantial cytosolic fluorescence ( Figure 22F ) . At dorsal closure similar to the full - length GFP : : dASAP ( Figure 12C ) , all deletion constructs highlighted the apical circumference ( Figure 22G - L , red brackets ) and apical surface puncta ( Figure 22G - L , green arrows ) . The difference of localization between cellularization and dorsal closure suggests early embryogenesis may be more sensitive to reveal roles for the protein domains of dASAP . 95 Figure 22 .

Subcellular localization of GFP - tagged dASAP deletion protein at both early and late embryogenesis . 97 5 . 2 GFP : : dASAPΔGAP mislocalizes during early embryogenesis To characterize the mislocalization of GFP : : dASAPΔGAP at cellularization , I used live imaging to analyze its subcellular localization from late syncytial cell divisions to early gastrulation . Compared to full - length GFP : : dASAP ( Figure 23D - F ) , GFP : : dASAPΔGAP was strongly associated with invaginating membranes ( Figure 23A - C , side views ) and mislocalized to tubules as early as late syncytial divisions ( Figure 23A at basal section and side view , white arrows ) . These tubular structures were present at early to mid cellularization ( Figure 23B , white arrows ) . At early gastrulation , large puncta formed along the circumferential membrane at apical and subapical sections ( Figure 23C at the subapical section and side view , red arrows ) , in contrast to the full - length GFP : : dASAP at the same stage ( Figure 23F ) . The tubular structures present at late syncytial divisions and cellularization were strikingly similar to the Amphiphysin - positive endocytic tubular intermediate structure described previously by Sokac and Wieschaus ( 2007 ) at the same developmental stages . Therefore , to determine whether these GFP : : dASAPΔGAP - positive tubules are Amphiphysin - positive , I immunostained GFP : : dASAPΔGAP transgenic embryos with Amphiphysin and F - actin . In spite of the similarity in localizations , GFP : : dASAPΔGAP did not colocalize with Amphiphysin at the subapical circumference ( Figure 23G - J , brackets ) , but did at some basal tubules ( Figure 23G - J insets , blue arrows ) . These tubules were F - actin negative ( Figure 23G - J insets , blue arrows , and side view , green arrows ) . In some of the tubules , GFP : : dASAPΔGAP did not completely overlap with 98 Amphiphysin ( Figure 23G - J , the green arrow on the left versus the one on the right in each side view ) , indicating GFP : : dASAPΔGAP may not decorate the tubular structure in the same way as Amphiphysin . 99 Figure 23 .

Our screen suggests connections between membrane trafficking and epithelial cell polarity The localization of GFP - tagged candidate proteins encoded by baz - interacting genes suggests that proteins of diverse localization and function work with Baz to regulate ECP . Some of the candidates have been confirmed to be involved in ECP . For example , the protein phosphatase Sds22 was recently shown to regulate cell polarity and morphology in Drosophila epithelia of imaginal discs and follicles ( Grusche et al . , 2009 ) . Many of the GFP - tagged candidate proteins localized to membrane structures , such as the plasma membrane ( dASAP , Arf79F , CG11210 , Sds22 , and Septin5 ) , the Golgi apparatus ( Fj ) ( Ishikawa et al . , 2008 ) , the ER ( Alt , CG8523 , CG10702 ) , and possibly clathrin - coated vesicles ( CG1951 ) ( Conner and Schmid , 2005 ) . This may reflect the extensive connections between membrane trafficking and epithelial cell polarity . 2 . Polarized localizations of Arf GTPases and their regulators suggest a general involvement in epithelial cell polarity in Drosophila Based on the localization of GFP tagged constructs , both dArf1 and dASAP localize to the apical circumference in Drosophila embryonic epithelia . dArf6 was previously shown to localize to the basolateral membrane ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . Hence the polarized localization of Arf GTPases and their regulators suggest they may be involved in epithelial cell polarity in Drosophila . The presence of 102 both dASAP ( Arf1 GAP ) and dArf1 at the apical domain is somewhat surprising since the GAP activity of dASAP activity would be expected to inactivate and dissociate dArf1 from the apical circumference . Rather , another mechanism ( possibly involving an Arf GEF ) may recruit dArf1 to the apical circumference , and dASAP may regulate the association of dArf1 with the membrane locally in the apical domain . Intriguingly , I detected no evidence for the association of dASAP with the ER or Golgi apparatus , suggesting that it may regulate dArf1 at the plasma membrane . Alternatively , dASAP might play a role in segregating dArf6 from the apical domain . Although Arf1 is thought to function mainly at the Golgi apparatus , increasing evidence suggests Arf1 may also regulate endocytosis at the plasma membrane in addition to effects at the Golgi apparatus ( Luo et al . , 2005 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . Since both dArf1 and dASAP localize to the apical circumference in Drosophila embryonic epithelia , it suggests a possible interaction between dArf1 and dASAP at the plasma membrane here as well . I hypothesize the interaction may regulate endocytosis at the apical domain ( Figure 24 ) . Future work will analyze the genetic , physical and functional interaction between dArf1 and dASAP . To test for genetic interactions between dArf1 and dASAP , the darf1 mutant will be crossed to the dasap mutant in order to check whether the cuticle phenotype is enhanced compared to single mutant lines . If they do interact , this would be followed up with analysis of defects in polarity complex localization . 103 Figure 24 . The model of the role of dASAP in endocytosis at the apical domain of epithelial cells . dASAP may regulate the endocytosis at the apical domain of epithelial cells by coordinating the actin cytoskeleton and dArf1 . Upon recruitment by the actin cytoskeleton at the site of endocytosis , dASAP may remodel the actin cytoskeleton . Meanwhile , dASAP may regulate the timing of dArf1 activity . The BAR domain of dASAP may also facilitate the endocytosis by inducing membrane curvature . Abbreviation : dArf1 ( Drosophila Arf1 ) , dASAP ( Drosophila ASAP ) . 104 Figure 24 . The model of the role of dASAP in endocytosis at the apical domain of epithelial cells . 105 Specifically , the apical polarity proteins ( e . g . Crb and Baz ) and AJ components ( e . g . DE - cad ) could be stained during late embryogenesis . To evaluate a physical interaction between dArf1 and dASAP , the colocalization between the immunofluorescence of anti - dASAP antibody and dArf1 : : GFP will be examined . The physical interaction between dASAP and dArf1 will be confirmed by co - immunoprecipitation experiments . Specifically , endogenous dASAP could be immunoprecipitated from wild type embryo lysates with the anti - dASAP antibody , and then the samples could be probed for endogenous dArf1 by anti - dArf1 antibody ( Kametaka et al . , 2010 ) after western blotting . This could also be done in the reciprocal way . If such immunoprecipitations failed , overexpressed GFP : : dASAP could be immunoprecipitated from transgenic embryo lysates with anti - GFP antibody and then the sample could be probed for endogenous dArf1 with anti - dArf1 antibody or vice versa . To determine whether the GAP domain of dASAP is important for this interaction , overexpressed GFP : : dASAPΔGAP could be immunoprecipitated by anti - GFP antibody , and then the samples could be probed for dArf1 . To confirm dASAP is a dArf1 - specific GAP , the GAP activity of dASAP against dArf1 could be compared versus other Drosophila Arf GTPases . Specifically , the in vitro GTP hydrolysis rates of Arf GTPase with and without the presence of the dASAP GAP domain could be measured respectively and compared . To analyze the functional interaction between dArf1 and dASAP , the localization of dArf1 will be examined in the dasap mutant and vice versa . In particular , the localization of dArf1 : : GFP in the dasap mutant and the localization 106 of dASAP : : GFP in the darf1 mutant will be examined . These experiments will show how dArf1 and / or dASAP may affect the positioning of the other protein . Since dASAP may regulate the membrane association of dArf1 , dArf1 : : GFP may be expected to mislocalize in the dasap mutant with stronger plasma membrane localization , whereas dASAP : : GFP may localize normally in the darf1 mutant . However , if dASAP functions as a dArf1 effector than just dArf1 GAP ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) , it is possible that dASAP : : GFP may show weaker plasma membrane localization in the darf1 mutant . 3 . Interaction with the actin cytoskeleton may be important for the localization and function of dASAP . I have shown that dASAP colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton and its localization partially depends on the actin cytoskeleton . Such dependence on the actin cytoskeleton is also present in Arf GEFs ( Macia et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , I propose that the actin cytoskeleton may serve as a scaffold to localize Arf GAPs and Arf GEFs . On the other hand , many Arf GAPs ( including ASAP1 ) and Arf GEFs are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton ( Randazzo et al . , 2007 ; Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . To test whether dASAP regulates the actin cytoskeleton , the localization of the actin cytoskeleton could be assessed upon the disruption of dASAP function in the dasap mutant . Specifically , phalloidin staining of actin in the dasap mutant could examine whether there is mislocalization / disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in the mutant . Live imaging 107 with a GFP - tagged protein probe for actin could assess whether the actin dynamics are altered in the mutant . Therefore , it is possible that the actin cytoskeleton may recruit dASAP which then reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton . The actin cytoskeleton and dASAP may work in concert to regulate cellular processes such as endocytosis ( Figure 24 ) . It will be interesting to see whether disruption of F - actin by mild treatment with cytochalasin D in early embryos may mislocalize the GFP - tagged full - length dASAP proteins to similar tubular structures seen in GFP : : dASAPΔGAP early embryos . 4 . A loss of function approach to analyze the role of dASAP in epithelial cell polarity . To use a loss of function approach to study the role of dASAP in ECP , the new mutant allele dasap 908WB was constructed . However , the fly line carrying this allele needs to be further characterized . I have noticed some flies in the original homozygous viable mutant line KG03963 still retain the balancer chromosome . My attempts at crossing homozygous mutants to each other failed , suggesting that the homozygous mutant flies have a fertility problem . This may also be the case in the new mutant line 908WB . To test the fertility phenotype , homozygous male or female flies from both mutant lines will be crossed to the opposite sex of wild type flies . To measure the fertility , the total number of eggs and the number of unfertilized eggs will be counted and compared between the mutant lines and wild type . If 108 the homozygous male flies are sterile , the dasap phenotype will be analyzed in maternal / zygotic mutant embryos by crossing heterozygous male to homozygous female . If the homozygous female flies are sterile , phenotypic analyses will be performed in oogenesis . To determine whether this sterility is a null phenotype , the dasap 908WB allele has to be confirmed as a null allele . The start codon is removed in this allele , which may abolish the translation of dASAP protein . To test whether the expression of dASAP gene is diminished , immunostaining with anti - dASAP antibody will be used to assess the protein level in mutant tissues including testis ( male sterility ) or ovary ( female sterility ) . Alternatively , Real - time PCR will be used to assess the transcript level from the same mutant tissue . To test whether the allele causes the null phenotype , the allele will be crossed to the deficiency line Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 in order to see whether the phenotype of dasap 908WB / Df ( 2R ) Exel7094 flies will be stronger than dasap 908WB alone . If the phenotype is similar , then it is likely a null allele . To test if the allele affects the dASAP gene only , real - time PCR will be performed to assess the expression of neighboring genes . In addition , the specificity of the allele will be confirmed by seeing whether its phenotype can be rescued by GFP - tagged full - length and / or deletion constructs of dASAP . 5 . dASAP’s domains may be redundant in localizing the protein . The localizations of six GFP - tagged deletion constructs removing the individual protein domains of dASAP are similar to that of the full - length dASAP 109 construct , suggesting that multiple domains may function redundantly to recruit dASAP protein to the apical domain . For example , the PH domain may bind to PIP 2 while the proline - rich region may mediate the interaction of dASAP with the actin cytoskeleton through binding to actin associated proteins . Deletion of multiple domains in dASAP is required to further elucidate its localization mechanism . The function of each domain may not be redundant . For instance , the BAR domain probably functions in membrane deformation while the SH3 domain may convey downstream signaling . This possibility will be tested by examining the ability of each deletion construct to rescue the dasap mutant phenotype . Roles for the domains in the recruitment or exclusion of other proteins from the apical domain could also be tested by overexpressing each deletion construct and looking for distinct effects . 6 . The mislocalization of GFP : : dASAPΔGAP at early embryogenesis suggests a role for the GAP domain in regulating plasma membrane association The mislocalization of GFP : : dASAPΔGAP ( which has the GAP domain removed ) at early embryogenesis suggests an enhanced interaction between dASAP protein and the plasma membrane . Compared to the full - length and other deletion constructs of dASAP , GFP : : dASAPΔGAP seems to be strongly associated with the membrane with extremely low cytosolic fluorescence . It is possible that the interaction between the GAP domain and Arf GTPase ( s ) affects 110 the membrane association of dASAP . The binding of GAP domain to Arf GTPase ( s ) may signal the release of dASAP from the membrane , and in the absence of the GAP domain , dASAP would be retained along the membrane ( Figure 25 , model 1 ) . Such a relationship should be apparent when analyzing dASAP localization in the darf1 mutant . Also , to test if the GAP activity is required for the dissociation , the localization of GFP - tagged dASAP with a single point mutation in the GAP domain that abolishes the GAP activity could be examined . The enhanced plasma membrane localization of GFP : : dASAPΔGAP may also be due to the loss of interactions between dASAP’s protein domains ( Figure 25 , model 2 ) . A previous study suggests the BAR domain may bind to and inhibit the GAP domain through intramolecular interactions ( Jian et al . , 2008 ) . It is also possible that the GAP domain normally inhibits the BAR domain . The absence of the GAP domain may lead to the hyperactivity of the BAR domain which subsequently induces stronger membrane association and membrane tubulation . Deleting the BAR domain in addition to the GAP domain ( GFP : : dASAPΔBARΔGAP ) could assess whether the interaction between the GAP domain and the BAR domain regulates membrane localization of dASAP . The tubular structure at the furrow canals may naturally exist or be induced by GFP : : dASAPΔGAP . To determine whether GFP : : dASAPΔGAP induces or just mislocalizes to the tubular structures , the tubular structures will be compared between wild type embryos and GFP : : dASAPΔGAP embryos with anti - Amphiphysin antibody from late syncytial division to late cellularization . A third 111 Figure 25 . Models of the role of the GAP domain in the plasma membrane association of dASAP . Two models are shown to explain the role of the GAP domain in the plasma membrane association of dASAP . In the first model , the GAP activity may regulate the activity of Arf GTPases , which in turn modulate membrane association and tubulation through downstream signaling . The absence of the GAP domain may deregulate Arf GTPases , which eventually causes the mislocalization of the deletion protein to the tubular structure . In the second model , the BAR domain binds to and inhibit the activity of the GAP domain . Meanwhile , this intramolecular interaction allows the GAP domain to sequester the BAR domain . Once the interaction is relieved , the BAR domain can then bind to the membrane and induced membrane curvature . Therefore , the absence of the GAP domain in GFP : : dASAPΔGAP may lead to hyperactivity of the BAR domain , which results in mislocalization of the deletion protein to the tubular structures . Abbreviation : AKR ( Ankyrin repeat ) , Arf ( ADP ribosylation factor ) , BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs domain ) , GAP ( GTPase - activating protein domain ) , PH ( Pleckstrin homology domain ) , SH3 ( Src homology 3 domain ) . 112 Figure 25 . Models of the role of the GAP domain in the plasma membrane association of dASAP . 113 possibility is that GFP : : dASAPΔGAP mislocalizes to pre - existing tubules and induces new tubules . This is supported by the fact that some tubules are marked by both GFP : : dASAPΔGAP and Amphiphysin with other tubules by GFP : : dASAPΔGAP or Amphiphysin alone . Another marker may be needed to stain for these tubular structures . If it appears to induce tubules , this may be attributed to the overactive BAR domain . Alternatively , the absence of the GAP domain could lead to dArf1 misregulation and thus endocytic vesicle scission defects . In addition to the tubular structures at earlier stages of embryogenesis , the large puncta along the plasma membrane at early gastrulation may be another good place to analyze the function of dASAP . First , long - term live imaging may be performed to determine whether these large puncta appear de novo or originate from the tubular structures at earlier stages . To see if any polarity players mislocalize in these puncta , polarity ( e . g . Baz , Crumbs , and aPKC ) and junctional ( e . g . DE - cad ) proteins will be stained . Since GFP : : dASAP normally colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton , F - actin will also be stained to see if it abnormally accumulates in these puncta . Finally , to test if those puncta could be attributed to endocytic defects , one could stain for endocytic markers , such as dynamin . 114 7 . Solving the discrepancy between GFP - tagged dASAP and the immunofluorescence of the anti - dASAP antibody To solve the discrepancy between the localization of dASAP using GFP - tagged dASAP and the immunofluorescence of the anti - dASAP antibody , the following experiments will be done . Although the dASAP proteins with the N - terminal and C - terminal GFP tag have similar localizations , GFP - tagged dASAP may not be fully functional and thus may mislocalize to ectopic sites . To test whether GFP - tagged dASAP is functional or not , the ability of GFP tagged full - length dASAP constructs to rescue the phenotype of the dasap mutant line will be tested . To address the possible technical issue in generating the antigen for dASAP antibody , the anti - dASAP antibodies of Rb4 , GP1 and GP2 will be affinity purified to remove any possible contamination of anti - Baz antibodies or other antibodies . The immunofluorescence localization of the purified antibodies will be determined to see if it becomes more similar to the localization of GFP - tagged dASAP . The specificity of the purified antibody will also be assessed in dasap mutant tissues where there are no dASAP proteins . 8 . Summary My work shows an association between dASAP and actin at the apical domain of epithelial cells . The six domains of dASAP appear to act redundantly to localize dASAP to the apical domain . Interactions of the GAP domain however with other domain ( s ) / protein ( s ) affecting membrane association and tubulation 115 are apparent . This indicates dASAP may interact with the actin cytoskeleton and regulate the trafficking at the plasma membrane in Drosophila epithelia . Future work is required to determine the role of dASAP in epithelial cell polarity . 116 REFERENCES Alberts , B . , Johnson , A . , Lewis , J . , Raff , M . , Roberts , K . , and Walter , P .
