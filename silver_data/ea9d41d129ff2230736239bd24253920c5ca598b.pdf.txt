PharmacoEconomics & Outcomes News 852 , p31 - 2 May 2020 Substantial direct medical costs for symptomatic COVID - 19 cases in the US Direct medical costs associated with symptomatic COVID - 19 cases appear to be " substantially higher than other common infectious diseases " , according to an article by US - based researchers . The authors developed a Monte Carlo simulation model that represented the US population and investigated what would happen to each person infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV2 ) , with potential resource use and direct medical costs estimated for a range of infection rates . The population infection rate was determined at the start of each simulation run , with the age distribution matching the reported age distribution of COVID - 19 cases , and each infected person then moving through a probability tree of differing possible sequential clinical outcomes . Model input parameters were obtained from scientific literature or nationally representative data sources . Costs were reported in 2020 US dollar values , with a 3 % discount rate applied . The median direct medical cost for a single symptomatic SARS - CoV2 infection was $ US3045 when including only costs accrued during the course of the infection , which increased to $ 3994 with inclusion of costs incurred after the infection , such as outpatient visits and hospitalisation . Median per - case costs ranged from $ 57 – $ 96 for a person with mild illness that did not require hospitalisation , to $ 14 366 during the course of the infection for a single hospitalised case . Analysis of different infection rates demonstrated that an 80 % infection rate would result in 215 million symptomatic cases and 44 . 6 million hospitalisations in the US , corresponding to a median direct medical cost incurred during the course of the infection of $ 654 billion , which increased to $ 859 . 6 billion with inclusion of the costs during the 1 - year post - discharge period . In contrast , 50 % and 20 % infection rates were estimated to cause 134 . 4 million and 53 . 8 million symptomatic cases , respectively , resulting in median direct medical costs during the course of the infection of $ 408 . 8 billion and $ 163 . 4 billion , respectively , which increased to $ 536 . 7 billion and $ 214 . 5 billion , respectively , with inclusion of 1 - year post - discharge costs . " [ T ] he direct medical costs of a symptomatic COVID - 19 case tends to be substantially higher than other common infectious diseases " , concluded the authors . " The significant difference in costs by attack rate across the U . S . population show the value of strategies that keep the attack as low as possible and , conversely , the potential cost of any " herd immunity " strategies that allow people to get infected " .
