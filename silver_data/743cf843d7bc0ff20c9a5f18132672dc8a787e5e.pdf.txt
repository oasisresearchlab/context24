S2 . 1 - 10 1 INTRODUCTION Architectural education in China started relatively late . From its inception to development , architecture majors have been run in several long - established traditional colleges for quite some time . However , as the specialty deepens into different industry fields , various institutions of different backgrounds have created their own architecture majors according to their own directions , and they are no longer limited to engineering colleges . This integrates the architecture profession with other disciplines and better serves the society , driving the healthy development of the entire industry , relevant opinions were proposed by Musa et al . [ 1 , 2 ] . A good CAD software must have a solid function graphics support system . Jane introduced that the Auto CAD series software developed by Autodesk has always been the top product in the CAD market , and has strong performance , user - friendly user interface , and rich secondary development Computer - Aided Design & Applications , 17 ( S2 ) , 2020 , 1 - 10 © 2020 CAD Solutions , LLC , http : / / www . cad - journal . net 2 tools [ 3 ] . It has become the most commonly used CAD software and secondary research and development platform . Nima et al . introduced that Auto CAD software and its graphics format have become a CAD standard and a basic carrier for popularizing next - generation design work [ 4 - 6 ] . It is currently the most widely used CAD software in the world , accounting for about 40 % of the global CAD / CAE / CAM software market . The trend of the proportion of Auto CAD in the CAD / CAE / CAM software market is shown in Figure 1 . Ding et al . introduced that Education must be targeted and taught according to its aptitude , especially the professional education of architecture [ 7 - 9 ] . The disciplines have strong practicality . For applied universities , the combination of theory and practical engineering is more important , and its applicability is emphasized . And because the specialty of architecture has a short period of discipline construction in general application - oriented colleges , it has not come out of its own characteristics , and has always been based on the teaching models and experience of well - known architectural universities . However , with the development of society and the use of specific practices , the models and experience it brings to the public have shown more and more problems in specific teaching , and even some gaps still exist in some specific teaching , Mark Garcia et al [ 10 , 11 ] . Because the teaching mode of architecture is related to the specific resources and culture of the area where the college is located , it is strongly related to the employment direction of students and the talent market demand of the local construction - related industries . The school ' s professional positioning , teaching resources , student resources , and teaching methods need to be reformed in accordance with its own characteristics . Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the Auto CAD course , this paper conducts research on the teacher - student interaction mode suitable for the course , helping teachers and students to interact effectively and helping students to learn effectively . Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the Auto CAD course , the classification / clustering study of the characteristics of the course resources is carried out , so that resources between courses and network resources can be aggregated together . The emergence of Auto CAD technology provides complete technical support for collaborative design and builds a good technical platform . Various professional designers can realize the accurate and timely transmission of information through the design platform based on Auto CAD , which greatly improves the efficiency and technical content of collaborative design . 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 3 0 . 35 0 . 4 Years P r opo r t i on Rapid increase Increase year by year A downward trend Figure 1 : The proportion of Auto CAD in the CAD / CAE / CAM software market . 2 RESEARCH ON AUTO CAD COURSE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE TEACHING SYSTEM 2 . 1 Analysis of the Characteristics of Auto CAD Integrated Development Environment And its Resource Characteristics The basic integrated development environment of Auto CAD has the following characteristics : Computer - Aided Design & Applications , 17 ( S2 ) , 2020 , 1 - 10 © 2020 CAD Solutions , LLC , http : / / www . cad - journal . net 3 ( 1 ) It integrates the development programs of various standard parts libraries , symbol libraries , and mold design into the Auto CAD design environment to improve worker efficiency and reduce repetitive error pressure . ( 2 ) The normal and efficient operation of the function modules called under the Auto CAD platform depends on a dedicated and consistent internal data conversion interface between them . ( 3 ) Industrial manufacturers in the design and manufacturing industry have increasingly higher functional requirements for the rapidly developing and changing manufacturing technology . The seamless integration of the industry ' s excellent foundation and general software into the manufacturer ' s Auto CAD software system has become an inevitable choice . ( 4 ) The open architecture enables users and third - party software developers to modify the original system to meet their respective needs , thereby expanding system functions . Auto CAD , an automated computer - aided design software developed by Autodesk , has become a popular drawing tool . The Auto CAD course is a highly practical course . It is employment - oriented . Students need to use the reading and drawing skills learned in this course to practice and solve related problems in real life . Auto CAD course resources in the teaching system generally have the following characteristics : ( 1 ) There are various resources in the AutoCAD course , which are manifested in the resources can be WORD documents , PDFs , and other types of files ; they can also be pictures or even videos . These resources can be uploaded by teachers , or they can refer to resources on the network . ( 2 ) The resources in the AutoCAD course are time - based , and the knowledge of AutoCAD and its tools will be updated quickly . ( 3 ) The resources on the AutoCAD course do not exist alone , and they have more or less correlation with other resources , such as courseware by other teachers , learning resources on the Internet , etc . Parametric drawing is an emerging thinking technology developed by the AutoCAD market , and is a representative idea to realize intelligence . In the ranks of products being put into mass production , its automation design efficiency has become a big problem . Using the parametric drawing idea can effectively solve the problems of poor drawing quality , high repetitive drawing rate and large waste of resources in real time . At the same time , according to the designer ' s requirements for different models of products , humanized drawing , that is , for products with the same overall frame , by adjusting its size ratio , the product map can be scaled without modifying the overall frame ratio . Each figure is constructed by several lines , and the program is used to complete the interactive drawing function after a specific value is given . The parameter letters are used in the program instead of the size information . When the program is called , the letters are valued . The Auto CAD drawing function is also divided into a drawing module . The letters in this module will be assigned new values and then the drawing function will help improve the efficiency of drawing . 2 . 2 Analysis of Blended Learning Mode of Auto CAD Course Auto CAD becomes more and more important to explore a learning model that is effective and suitable for the characteristics of the course . The more popular is the mixed teaching mode , which is based on the traditional classroom teaching mode , adding the network teaching system part , so that the two organically combine . While maintaining the advantages of traditional teaching and learning , it can also provide students with communication and guidance without leaving the classroom . Problem - based learning is an activity that achieves continuous learning through the promotion of a series of questions . For learning , an important assumption is that students master knowledge and gain wisdom through a series of problem solving . Focusing on the problem , learners work together to solve problems in the context by grouping , as shown in Figure 2 . In this process , learners provide solutions to the problems raised in the situation through self - study , mutual communication , discussion , and communication with teachers . At the same time , learners ' self - learning ability , cooperation and communication ability between learners will be improved .

Modern teaching increasingly regards the teaching process as a system . Through careful and comprehensive analysis of various interwoven factors that affect successful learning , such as students , teachers , teaching materials , learning environments , etc . , they choose coping strategies and integrate effective methods to stimulate and promote student learning . The attention and thinking on the problem system can avoid the simple question - and - answer processing and design of problems in teaching , so that the problem really becomes the internal driving force to promote student learning . 2 . 3 Clustering of Teaching Resources Teaching resource clustering is to group teaching resources into multiple clusters according to certain rules or methods , so that the content of teaching resources in the same cluster maintains a relatively high degree of similarity , and at the same time , there is a big gap in resource content . Aiming at the type of data , the purpose of clustering teaching resources , and the processing method , more commonly used are partition - based clustering algorithms , hierarchical clustering , density - based clustering , and model - based clustering algorithms . Several different clustering methods of teaching resources are shown in Table 1 . Computer - Aided Design & Applications , 17 ( S2 ) , 2020 , 1 - 10 © 2020 CAD Solutions , LLC , http : / / www . cad - journal . net 5 Clustering method Description Partition - based approach Among the clustering algorithms based on partition , the K - mean algorithm is more representative . Layer - based approach Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy to divide a given data set . This method can be operated from top to bottom and bottom to top . Density - based approach Connecting adjacent areas with sufficient density can effectively handle abnormal data and is mainly used for clustering spatial data . Model - based approach After unsupervised processing , the generated clusters can be labeled with subject words or in other ways , reflecting the spatial relationship between the clustered text clusters . Table 1 : Clustering classification of several different teaching resources . In view of the diversity and relevance of Auto CAD course resources , the relationship between resources needs to be reflected , and the description of a resource can have many different feature words to describe , and a high - dimensional clustering algorithm is needed . In addition , after the course resources are clustered , they need to have good readability and interpretability . The model - based method can maintain topological continuity , that is , after pointing with similar characteristics in the input are mapped , they are also adjacent in the output space . And it can also reflect the probability distribution of training samples . The data area showing a certain probability distribution in the original data has the same probability distribution in the corresponding area on the map . The results of clustering teaching resources are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . Among them , Figure 3 clusters teaching resources into 5 categories , and Figure 4 divides teaching resources into 6 categories . It can be seen from Figures 3 and 4 that the clustering effect is good . 0 0 . 25 0 . 5 0 . 75 1 0 0 . 25 0 . 5 0 . 75 1 X Y Resource1 Resource2 Resource3 Resource4 Resource5 Figure 3 : Results of teaching resources clustered into 5 categories .

Many schools ' websites are created by network management technicians and managers . Auto CAD is a course that emphasizes practice , communication , and discussion . Its curriculum resources are diverse . This paper combines the characteristics of the course and its resources with the timeliness of course teaching , studies the methods suitable for the teaching of Auto CAD courses and the display of their resource views . View display requires the following : ( 1 ) The course syllabus and courseware can be displayed as a whole ; ( 2 ) The panel members ' discussions and their respective results can be effectively displayed ; ( 3 ) Course resources and other resources can be clustered ; ( 4 ) The clustered resource information can be displayed in an easy - to - understand manner . 3 MULTI - PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN BASED ON AUTO CAD TECHNOLOGY 3 . 1 Design of Teaching Organization Form The teaching tasks corresponding to each teaching module are carried out in the form of actual engineering design projects . The project design process is complex . Students often do not know how to proceed . This requires teachers to break down complex project design tasks into teaching modules with clear goals . Each teaching module is designed for a certain design training , and each teaching module is advanced step by step in order , and finally the results are comprehensively obtained . Its teaching organization form is " arrange design tasks - case analysis and site visits - student task implementation - task summary and evaluation " . The teaching organization form of the architectural design course is shown in Figure 5 .

Figure 5 : Teaching organization of architectural design course . In the teaching of the architectural design class , we need students to have a clear understanding of similar buildings and a perceptual understanding of their functions and structures . At the same time , students need to analyze and describe an excellent work that has been completed and thoroughly understand the work . We should focus on organizing teaching courses to guide students to think about what is architecture , from which direction to think about problems , how to proceed with design , what are the ways to deal with problems , etc . , so that students really understand the meaning of architectural design , focus on the logic and architecture of the building design methods . The relationship between education and vocational training should be considered in teaching , reducing the use of a large number of assignments to achieve teaching purposes , and giving students more time to think , not just to complete a beautiful assignment . 3 . 2 Fusion of Collaborative Design and Auto CAD Although architects and engineers have generally accepted the concept of collaborative design and applied it to actual projects , they have not yet formed a complete and unified understanding of the meaning of collaborative design . What we mean by collaborative design at this stage means that the project participants communicate the design content and organize the management of the design process in the form of a web conference through the network . However , the information transfer between project participants is still based on CAD files as information carriers , and information is shared across departments , regions , and even national borders through network messages , video conferences and other means . The collaborative operations of the project participants mainly rely on the comprehensive management of information by the network resource library . With the assistance of relevant network management software , the project managers have the corresponding authority levels . The project participants discuss , modify and make targeted design changes through the results exchange to ensure the real - time and uniqueness of the design results . Since the emergence and application of Auto CAD in the design process of the construction industry , Auto CAD technology has caused a violent impact on traditional design methods , and has brought about revolutionary changes in the design methods of the construction industry . Auto CAD technology shifts the design from a flat 2D design that relies on 2D drawings to a 3D design of the building system using 3D simulation software . However , we must also realize that although multi - professional collaborative design based on AutoCAD has design advantages that traditional design methods cannot match , the application of collaborative design in the actual design process is in its infancy . With the support of related software , collaborative design has relatively complete technical Computer - Aided Design & Applications , 17 ( S2 ) , 2020 , 1 - 10 © 2020 CAD Solutions , LLC , http : / / www . cad - journal . net 8 support , but it will take time to implement it into the entire industry chain and make it truly integrate into the design concept of designers . The proportion of Auto CAD software in architectural design teaching is shown in Figure 6 . It can be seen that its proportion has gradually increased in recent years . 1989 1994 1999 2004 2009 2014 2019 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 Y ea r s U s e r a t i o Figure 6 : Proportion of Auto CAD software in architectural design teaching . While the development of Auto CAD technology has brought a strong technical impact to the construction industry , it has also promoted the integration of collaborative design technology and Auto CAD technology , making it a whole , interdependent and inseparable from each other . For the same component in the construction process of Auto CAD model , with the transmission and sharing of data between the majors , designers of various majors can simultaneously operate the element of the component from the perspective of each major , and truly realize the core concept of Auto CAD - collaboration . 3 . 3 From 2D Design to 3D Auto CAD Design In two - dimensional graphic design , designers must have a high spatial imagination ability to truly feel the specific use of the interior space of the building , which has higher requirements for the designer ' s spatial imagination . Moreover , the designer ' s perception of the space of the building is a continuous process , and relying solely on two - dimensional spatial representations cannot explain the spatial sequence of the building in detail . Three - dimensional design based on Auto CAD can fully realize virtual reality . Through virtual display of real space , it can provide designers with realistic visual and auditory experience . The building model constructed by the 3D simulation software is a physical mapping of the real building . In the model , the material of each component and the properties of the material can be displayed , and the information of all building components can be viewed at any time , so that designers can compare the real building functions . In addition , compared to two - dimensional plane drawing , the three - dimensional design of Auto CAD can accurately express the geometric characteristics of the building , there are no obstacles to geometric expression , and it can accurately represent any complex architectural shape through the parameter settings of the software . The three - dimensional architectural drawing designed by Auto CAD is shown in Figure 7 . Although 3D attributes are the foundation of Auto CAD design , they are not all . The Auto CAD model not only contains the spatial geometric data given to the building components by the 3D design process , but also integrates non - geometric information such as material characteristics , physical characteristics , mechanical parameters , design attributes , etc . on the basis of the 3D model . The Auto CAD model can automatically obtain 2D drawings such as plan , section , elevation , etc . of the design project through the graphic operation function of the 3D simulation software while meeting the drawing rules of related design professions .

Both the 3D building design based on Auto CAD technology and the traditional 3D building design can complete the construction of the 3D model of the building , but there are still differences between the two , as shown in Table 2 .

Combining the characteristics of the course and its resources , a teaching mode suitable for the network teaching of the course is given . Starting from resource organization , the meaning of teaching resource clustering is given , and several different teaching resource clustering classifications are briefly compared , and a clustering algorithm is selected . Based on the characteristics of the Auto CAD course and its course resources , the requirements of view display in the teaching process are given , and the appropriate view is selected as the display of the teaching view . Aiming at the current situation that the traditional two - dimensional and three - dimensional design cannot meet the increasingly complex building system design , this paper proposes a new approach to build an Auto CAD model based on the multi - professional collaborative design method . The building ' s Auto CAD model is established by software , and the building ' s Auto CAD model is linked to the building process of the water supply and drainage pipeline system ' s Auto CAD model , so as to realize the collaborative design between majors . Our architectural education should not pursue a large scale , but should enable students to conduct in - depth research on issues in a small range , and in - depth digestion , which is conducive to the formation of a complete and rational cognitive system for architectural design and to improve students ' practical application ability .
