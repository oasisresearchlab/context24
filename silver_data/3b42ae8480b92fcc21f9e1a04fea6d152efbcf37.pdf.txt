Background : The CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion gene is one of the most frequent somatic genomic rearrangements in gastric cancer , especially in the genomically stable ( GS ) subtype . However , the clinical and prognostic meaning of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion in gastric cancer patients is unclear . Methods : Studies that investigated CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gastric cancer patients were identiﬁed systematically from the PubMed , Cochrane , and Embase databases through the 28th of February 2020 . A systematic review and meta - analysis were performed to estimate the clinical signiﬁcance of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion in patients . Results : A total of ﬁve eligible studies covering 1908 patients were selected for inclusion in the meta - analysis based on speciﬁed inclusion and exclusion criteria . Several fusion patterns were observed linking CLDN18 and ARHGAP26 or ARHGAP6 , with the most common type being CLDN18 / exon5 - ARHGAP26 / exon12 . The survival outcome meta - analysis of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene showed that it was associated with overall survival outcomes in gastric cancer ( HR , 2 . 03 , 95 % CI 1 . 26 – 3 . 26 , P < 0 . 01 , random - effects ) . In addition , diffuse gastric cancer had a greater proportion of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions than intestinal gastric cancer ( 13 . 3 % , 151 / 1 , 138 vs . 1 . 8 % , 8 / 442 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Moreover , gastric cancer patients with the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene are more likely to be female or have a younger age , lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages . Conclusion : The CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion is one of the molecular characteristics of diffuse gastric cancer and is also an independent prognostic risk factor for gastric cancer . In addition , it is also related to multiple clinical characteristics , including age , sex , lymph node metastasis and tumor stage . However , the mechanism of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene and potential targeted therapeutic strategies need further exploration .

CLDN18 - ARHGAP Fusion in Gastric Cancer INTRODUCTION Recurrent chromosomal translocations have been implicated in multiple tumor types . It has been demonstrated that frequent fusion genes are involved in oncogenesis and progression as driver events . The Philadelphia chromosome is well reported as the ﬁrst cancer - associated chromosomal rearrangement , resulting in the BCR - ABL fusion , which was also identiﬁed as a diagnostic feature and therapeutic target of chronic myeloid leukemia patients . Thereafter , oncologic fusion genes were frequently identiﬁed in leukemia , lymphoma and sarcoma , but with a relatively low incidence rate in epithelial tumors ( 1 ) . For epithelial tumors , the most well - known fusion gene is the EML4 - ALK gene , which was detected in ∼ 5 – 10 % of non - small cell lung cancer patients ( 2 , 3 ) . Regarding gastric cancer , The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) project proposes the molecular classiﬁcation of gastric cancers and divides them into four separate subtypes , and the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion gene is highly enriched in the genomically stable ( GS ) subtype ( 4 ) . Histologically , the majority of GS subtype cancers were the diﬀuse type according to the Lauren classiﬁcation , with common somatic mutations located in the CDH1 and RHOA genes . It is notable that CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions were mutually exclusive with RHOA mutations in the classiﬁcation of TCGA ( 4 ) . A subsequent functional study indicated that the introduction of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion to tumor cells can direct the loss of the epithelial phenotype , epithelial - mesenchymal transition , and inhibition of the RHOA signaling pathway and contribute to tumor invasiveness in cancer cell lines ( 5 ) . Our study group previously used a whole - genome sequencing approach to characterize the genomic features of signet ring cell gastric cancer and identiﬁed frequent CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions ( 6 ) . More importantly , we linked multiple clinical characteristics with CLDN18 - ARHGAP28 / 6 fusions , including the proportion of signet ring cell content , TNM stage , and poor prognosis with the current chemotherapy strategy ( 6 ) . These ﬁndings were quickly validated by an independent Japanese study ( 7 , 8 ) . Meanwhile , a further Korean study found that the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene can promote the invasion and migration capacity of gastric cancer cells ( 9 ) . However , there is a lack of studies systematically evaluating the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic meaning of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions in gastric cancers . Therefore , in this meta - analysis and systematic review , we will systematically summarize and assess the clinical signiﬁcance and advances of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene in gastric cancer . The primary endpoint of the present study is the survival outcomes of patients with the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene , and other endpoints are the relationship of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene with tumor - related clinicopathological characteristics , such as age , sex , tumor location and tumor stage .

METHODS Search Strategy We searched the Web of Knowledge , PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Collaborative Center Register of Controlled Trials databases on the 28th of February 2020 by using the terms “gastric cancer , ” “gastric carcinoma , ” “gastric neoplasm , ” “stomach cancer , ” “stomach carcinoma , ” “stomach neoplasm , ” “CLDN , ” “claudin , ” “ARHGAP , ” “Rho GTPase - activating protein , ” “oligophrenin - 1 - like” and “OPHN1L” and strictly restricted search results to titles , abstracts and keywords . We also searched previously published meta - analyses and systematic reviews . All of those articles were independently screened by two authors ( WH Zhang and SYZ ) based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study . Because the studies included in this meta - analysis have been published , ethical approval was not needed from ethics committees . The results of this study were reported according to the PRISMA statement ( 10 ) . Study Selection Those studies that reported the relationship between the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene and the clinicopathological characteristics or survival outcomes of gastric cancer patients were included . The exclusion criteria included the following : ( 1 ) mixed benign disease of the stomach ; ( 2 ) articles in languages other than English ; and ( 3 ) incomplete data or duplicated data . For studies with more than one article and with duplicated data , only the article with the most complete data was included for analysis in this study . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data from the included studies were independently extracted by two authors ( WH Zhang and QQ Hou ) . For each study , we recorded the following information : name of the ﬁrst author , year of publication , country of the study , study design , time period of the study and examined method for the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene . Furthermore , the following clinicopathological characteristics were also extracted and included in the present study : fusion types of the CLDN18 and ARHGAP genes , age ( years ) , sex ( male or female ) , tumor location ( upper third of stomach ) , tumor stage ( T stage , N stage and TNM stage ) and survival outcomes between CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive and CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative patients . The patients were divided into a CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive group and a CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative group according to the status of the expression of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions . The quality assessment of the included studies was evaluated by two authors ( WH Zhang and QQ Hou ) independently . Retrospective studies were assessed by the Newcastle – Ottawa Scale ( NOS ) , which is a 9 - point scale ( 11 ) . Studies with NOS scores lower than 6 were deemed moderate or low - quality studies . Any disagreements regarding the quality assessment were resolved by discussion with supervisors ( H Xu and JK Hu ) . Statistical Analysis This study was performed according to the Cochrane guidelines ( 12 ) . For studies that only reported the medians and ranges for continuous variables , the data were converted to means and Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 2 September 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1214 Zhang et al . CLDN18 - ARHGAP Fusion in Gastric Cancer standard deviations ( SDs ) with the method reported by Hozo et al . ( 13 ) . Categorical variables are presented as ratios and were analyzed by the Mantel - Haenszel method , and continuous variables are presented as the mean ± SD and were analyzed by the inverse variance method . The odds ratio ( OR ) and mean diﬀerence ( MD ) were used to evaluate dichotomous and continuous data , respectively . The hazard ratio ( HR ) was used to evaluate survival outcomes . The OR , HR and MD were reported with 95 % conﬁdence intervals ( CIs ) . Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by the I 2 value . According to the I 2 value , the studies were determined to have low ( I 2 < 30 % ) , moderate ( 30 – 50 % ) or considerable ( I 2 ≥ 50 % ) heterogeneity . Begg’s test was used to assess publication bias . For the survival analysis , we updated the survival information to Jan 2019 of our previous study ( all 829 patients , Shu et al . ) ( 6 ) . In addition , individual survival information from the TCGA cohort was also updated according to a recent report from the TCGA research network ( 14 ) . Survival information from other studies was extracted with the method reported by Tierney et al . by Engauge Digitizer software ( Version 11 . 2 ) ( 15 ) . A P - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant for the present study . All of the statistical analyses were performed by R software ( http : / / FIGURE 1 | PRISMA ﬂow chart .

After reading the titles and abstracts , 26 articles remained for reassessment according to their full texts . After reading the full texts of these articles , we included ﬁve studies that presented the relationship of clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes with CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene status ( Figure 1 , PRISMA Flow Diagram ) . We also evaluated the quality of all included studies with the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale , and the results showed that all studies had a score ≥ 6 . All 5 studies were from four countries ( United States , Japan , Korea and China ) and were published between 2014 and 2019 . Finally , a total of 1 , 908 patients were included in the present study : 151 ( 7 . 9 % ) patients in the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive group and 1 , 757 ( 92 . 1 % ) patients in the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative group . General characteristics of those included ﬁve studies were summarized in Table 1 . There were several fusion types in CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene gastric cancer patients . Also , the fusion types from the ﬁve reported studies between CLDN18 and ARHGAP genes are presented in Table 2 . The CLDN18 / exon5 - ARHGAP26 / exon12 fusion was the most common fusion pattern among present reports and is clearly understood . In addition , the mutation counts between the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive and CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative patients in cohorts of Shu et al . and TCGA were analyzed ( Supplementary Tables 1 , 2 ) . However , there was no overlap of the signiﬁcant mutation counts gene between CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive and - negative patients in the Shu and TCGA cohorts . Diﬀerent pathological subtypes and the sample size diﬀerence of the two cohorts may be the reasons for the results . However , the study of Shu et al . was based on the whole genome sequencing , so we cannot analyze the RNA expression level between fusion positive and negative patients . Therefore , we analyzed copy number variation in the cohort of Shu et al . ( Supplementary Table 3 ) and the RNA expression level ( Supplementary Table 4 ) in the TCGA cohort between CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive and CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative gastric cancer patients . In the meta - analysis of clinicopathological characteristics , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene - positive group had more patients with a younger age ( MD : − 5 . 85 , 95 % CI : − 11 . 22 to − 0 . 48 , p = 0 . 03 ) , a lower proportion of male patients ( OR : 0 . 40 , 95 % CI 0 . 23 – 0 . 70 , p = 0 . 001 ) , patients with a more advanced N stage ( OR : 3 . 41 , 95 % CI 2 . 00 – 5 . 82 , p < 0 . 001 ) and patients with a more advanced TNM stage ( OR : 3 . 07 , 95 % CI 1 . 56 – 6 . 05 , p = 0 . 001 ) than the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene - negative group ( Table 3 ) . However , tumor location ( p = 0 . 43 ) and T stage ( p = 0 . 07 ) were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two groups . Moreover , we found that diﬀuse gastric cancers had a greater proportion of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion genes than intestinal gastric cancers ( 13 . 3 % , 151 / 1 , 138 vs . 1 . 8 % , 8 / 442 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Survival Analysis CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive gastric cancer patients had signiﬁcantly poorer overall survival outcomes than CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative patients in the meta - analysis ( HR : TABLE 1 | Characteristics of studies reported clinicopathological characteristics between CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion and gastric cancers .

Because there were only 4 studies included in the survival analysis , publication bias was only evaluated by Begg’s test . The results demonstrated that there was no publication bias according to Begg’s test with continuity correction ( p = 0 . 555 ) . In addition , we acquired updated individual survival information from the cohort of Shu et al . and the TCGA cohort . Therefore , the survival diﬀerence between CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive and CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative patients was evaluated in these two cohorts ( Figures 3A , B ) . A signiﬁcant survival diﬀerence was found between the CLDN - ARHGAP fusion gene - positive and CLDN - ARHGAP fusion gene - negative groups with the combination of the data from the two cohorts ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3C ) . In addition , the Cox proportional hazards model was used to present the independent prognostic risk factors in the merged data of the Shu and TCGA cohorts ( Table 4 ) . In multivariate survival analysis , positive CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion ( HR : 1 . 365 , 95 % CI 1 . 031 – 1 . 809 , p = 0 . 030 ) and TNM stage ( stage III vs . stage I , HR : 3 . 018 , 95 % CI 1 . 763 – 5 . 164 , p < 0 . 001 ; stage IV vs . stage I , HR : 7 . 155 , 95 % CI 4 . 083 – 12 . 538 , p < 0 . 001 ) were independent prognostic risk factors . DISCUSSION In the present study , a total of 5 cohort studies reported the presence of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 5 September 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 1214 Zhang et al . CLDN18 - ARHGAP Fusion in Gastric Cancer FIGURE 2 | Meta - analysis of survival outcomes between CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - negative and CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive gastric cancer patients . ( A ) Survival outcomes of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion gene ( positive vs . negative ) ; ( B ) sensitivity analysis of the included studies . in gastric cancer patients . Multiple clinical characteristics were observed to be correlated with the frequency of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions . Finally , signiﬁcant enrichment of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions was observed in female patients and patients with a younger age , diﬀuse gastric cancer by Lauren classiﬁcation and more advanced tumor stages ( N stage and TNM stage ) , but CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions were not related to the primary tumor location . Most importantly , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion was signiﬁcantly related to poor survival outcomes in the meta - analysis ( HR : 2 . 03 , 95 % CI 1 . 26 – 3 . 26 , p < 0 . 01 , random eﬀects ) . Meanwhile , in the survival analysis with the combination of individual data from the Shu et al . and TCGA cohorts , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion was an independent prognostic risk factor for overall survival outcomes ( HR : 1 . 365 , 95 % CI 1 . 031 – 1 . 809 , p = 0 . 030 ) . The CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene is formed by chromosomal rearrangements of the CLDN18 and ARHGAP genes , mainly CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 and CLDN18 - ARHGAP6 fusions . CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 contains a nearly full coding region of CLDN18 and the conserved domain of ARHGAP26 / 6 . Functionally , the CLDN18 gene encodes the claudin - 18 protein , which forms tight junctions in epithelial cells . The CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion protein may disrupt the structure of the wild - type CLDN18 protein , which may impact the cellular adhesion of cancer cells . The ARHGAP26 gene encodes the ARHGAP26 protein , a member of the Rho GTPase activating the protein , which is also known as the GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase ( GRAF ) . GRAF not only regulates the activity of RHOGAP family proteins ( 16 ) but also coordinates membrane remodeling , which is necessary for the CLIC / GEEC endocytic pathway ( 17 ) . Regev et al . suggested that the GRAF protein may play a role in the maintenance of the normal epithelial phenotype , the depletion of which can induce a neoplastic transformation - related epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) - like process ( 18 ) . For the fusion proteins of CLDN18 - ARHGAP , the large segment of ARHGAP fuses to the carboxy terminus of CLDN18 and retains the carboxy - terminal GAP domain , which may aﬀect ARHGAP’s regulation of the RHOA pathway and / or the epithelial phenotype of gastric cancer cells . Several studies have indicated that the introduction of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion in cancer cells can increase their migration and invasion ability ( 5 , 6 ) , which can partially explain the advanced tumor stages in CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion - positive patients . In the TCGA gastric cancer cohort , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion was enriched in patients with the genomically stable subtype , which has higher frequency of lower third tumors , patients with a younger age and more diﬀuse histological subtype tumors ( 4 ) . In our previous study , we found that the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion was signiﬁcantly associated with the proportion of signet ring cancer cells and tumor stage ( 6 ) . Tanaka et al . also observed a higher frequency of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions in diﬀuse gastric cancers than in intestinal gastric cancers ( 22 / 172 , 12 . 8 % vs . 4 / 82 , 4 . 8 % ) ( 8 ) . In the present study , we found a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the frequency of the CLDN18 - ARHGA P fusion gene between diﬀuse gastric cancer and intestinal gastric cancer ( 13 . 3 % , 151 / 1 , 138 vs . 1 . 8 % , 8 / 442 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Therefore , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion may be an important molecular characteristic of diﬀuse gastric cancer .

CLDN18 - ARHGAP Fusion in Gastric Cancer FIGURE 3 | Individual overall survival outcomes of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion gastric cancer patients in the Shu et al . and TCGA cohorts . ( A ) Overall survival outcomes in the Shu et al . cohort ; ( B ) overall survival outcomes in the TCGA cohort ; ( C ) overall survival outcomes in the two cohorts . It is well reported that the diﬀuse subtype has a signiﬁcantly poorer prognosis than the intestinal subtype of gastric cancer according to the Lauren classiﬁcation , probably because of the more advanced tumor stages and potential resistance to traditional chemotherapy regimens of diﬀuse gastric cancers ( 19 ) . We previously reported the prognostic value of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion , which is a risk factor for overall survival and confers postoperative chemotherapy resistance ( 6 ) . The present study summarized the survival outcomes of previously reported studies focused on the C LDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene . Thereafter , the survival outcome meta - analysis showed that patients with CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion have a signiﬁcantly poorer prognosis than patients without CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion . Due to the enrichment of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion in patients with more advanced stages , it is important to assess the factors independently associated with the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion . Multivariate analyses of individual data from the Shu and TCGA cohorts presented a signiﬁcant association of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion status with poor treatment outcomes after adjusting for tumor stage , indicating that the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion is an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancers . In addition , it is necessary to mention that some of the included studies were not traditional clinical studies , and limited follow - up durations ( such as that in the TCGA cohort ) may increase the bias risk in the survival analysis above . According to a previous study ( 6 ) , gastric cancer patients with the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion gene cannot obtain survival beneﬁts from 5 - FU / oxaliplatin - based chemotherapy , which may partially explain the poor prognosis of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion patients . However , no other study analyzed the relationship between the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion gene and chemotherapy drug therapeutic sensitivity . Mechanistically , resistance to these chemotherapy drugs was observed after the introduction of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion into cell lines ( 6 ) . Because no reported gastric cancer cell lines carry CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions according to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database ( 20 , 21 ) , patient - derived xenograft ( PDX ) and organoid models may be the breakthrough point for future research to help validate drug resistance , screen fusion - targeted drugs , and guide personalized therapy ( 22 – 24 ) . Yan et al . described a gastric cancer organoid model that can be used to assess the eﬃcacy of chemotherapy ( 25 ) . Unfortunately , no patient with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion was captured in their gastric cancer organoid bank . Nakayama et al . established two CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion - positive cell lines from 125 gastric cancer PDXs ( 26 ) . Collectively , these results suggest that the establishment of PDX and organoid models can help researchers conduct drug sensitivity screening and explore personalized medicine applications for therapy response testing in the future . Speciﬁcally , the aberrant activation of claudin - 18 splice variant 2 ( claudin - 18 . 2 ) was detected in multiple types of cancer compared with its limited expression in normal tissues . The rate of claudin - 18 . 2 - positive patients was more than 80 % according to a Japanese study on gastric cancer , and more than 40 % of patients had moderate - to - strong expression ( ≥ 2 + membrane staining intensity in ≥ 40 % of tumor cells ) in both the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes ( 27 ) . Claudin - 18 . 2 has been considered a novel druggable target for some epithelial tumors ( 28 ) . Indeed , a chimeric monoclonal antibody drug has been recently developed ( i . e . , zolbetuximab , formerly known as IMAB362 ) , which induces the immune - mediated lysis of CLDN18 . 2 - positive cancer cells by activating immune eﬀector mechanisms ( 29 ) .

Clinical trials evaluating the safety and eﬃcacy of zolbetuximab for claudin - 18 . 2 - positive cancer patients are ongoing . The up - to - date evidence is promising but remains to be validated by high - quality clinical trials ( 30 , 31 ) . We also noticed that there is an ongoing clinical trial , which is focused on safety and eﬃcacy of anti - claudin18 . 2 chimeric antigen receptor t - cell ( CAR - T ) immunotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer or pancreatic cancer ( ClinicalTrials . gov Identiﬁer : NCT03159819 ) . The ﬁnal results of the anti - claudin - 18 . 2 CAR - T immunotherapy as a new anti - tumor targeted immunotherapy study are highly anticipated . Considering that a higher claudin - 18 . 2 positive rate was observed in patients with the diﬀuse subtype of gastric cancer than in those with the intestinal type ( 57 . 5 vs . 39 . 0 % ) ( 27 ) , an unsolved and important question is whether the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene is correlated with claudin - 18 . 2 protein expression and thus is suitable for zolbetuximab treatment , which requires solid clinical evidence . According to previous studies , whole - genome sequencing , RNA sequencing , reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) are all eﬀective methods for the detection of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions . Once the clinical signiﬁcance of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion has been proven and potential target treatment regimens have been determined , establishing a stable and eﬀective detection method for this fusion gene is particularly important . Considering the preservation of tumor tissue as well as the stability and economic cost of the examination , FISH may be the ﬁrst choice for promotion in clinical practice . In addition , RNA in situ hybridization techniques may be useful in the detection of fusion genes . However , the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the detection of fusion genes by such methods should be validated by clinical studies . In addition , oncogenic fusion circRNAs ( f - circRNAs ) derived from cancer - associated chromosomal translocations exhibit properties of tumor - promoting cellular transformation , cell viability and resistance to treatment ( 32 , 33 ) . Consistently , f - circRNAs derived from SLC32A2 - ROS1 and EML4 - ALK fusion genes , which have been determined as biomarkers for the use of targeted drugs in lung cancer , were also demonstrated to impact cell migration , invasion and cell proliferation in lung cancer cells ( 34 , 35 ) . More importantly , the f - circRNAs of EML4 - ALK can be detected in the plasma of EML4 - ALK - positive NSCLC patients ( 36 ) . These results suggest the following : ( 1 ) f - circRNAs are involved in the mechanism of tumorigenesis , progression and therapy resistance ; and ( 2 ) cell - free f - circRNAs could be a novel “liquid biopsy” biomarker to monitor the status of fusion genes in a noninvasive way . Therefore , we speculate and propose the following hypothesis : f - circRNAs of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene exist and can aﬀect tumor function or act as a potential “liquid biopsy” biomarker for targeted drugs ( e . g . , zolbetuximab ) . The present study also has some limitations . ( 1 ) This study only included ﬁve retrospective studies . Therefore , selection bias and quality deviation are likely among these studies , which may have an inﬂuence on the results of the meta - analysis . ( 2 ) The detection methods varied among the included studies . The potential false positive and false negative rates of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion in the included studies may have inﬂuenced the results of the meta - analysis . ( 3 ) In addition , the limited follow - up duration of the included studies was another limitation of the presented studies . ( 4 ) Although previous studies successfully demonstrated that the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion gene can induce EMT , the loss of the epithelial phenotype , and cell - cell and cell - extracellular matrix adhesion , as well as increase the invasion ability and resistance to chemotherapy drugs in cancer cell lines ( 5 , 6 ) , the speciﬁc molecular mechanisms by which CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 regulates downstream molecules and pathways remain unclear . As diﬀerent fusion modes generate various fusion proteins , it is diﬃcult to design and develop antibodies to speciﬁcally target these fusion proteins , which may hinder mechanistic investigation of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene . Furthermore , large sample size multicenter studies are expected to validate the clinical signiﬁcance and prognostic meaning of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion gene in gastric cancer patients .

CLDN18 - ARHGAP Fusion in Gastric Cancer CONCLUSIONS The CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene is characterized as one of the features of diﬀuse gastric cancer . The CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion gene is correlated with advanced tumor stages in gastric cancer , as well as poor survival outcomes . Although CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion can increase the invasion and migration ability of gastric cancer cells in vitro , the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated . Furthermore , the early detection of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion and targeted drugs for this fusion may potentially improve the survival outcomes of gastric cancer patients .
