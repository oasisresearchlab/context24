Humphrey On atomic force microscopy and the constitutive behavior of living cells Received : 23 January 2004 / Accepted : 1 June 2004 / Published online : 19 August 2004 (cid:1) Springer - Verlag 2004 Abstract Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) is one of many new technologies available to study the mechani - cal properties and mechanobiological responses of living cells . Despite the widespread usage of this technology , there has been little attempt to develop new theoretical frameworks to interpret the associated data . Rather , most analyses rely on the classical Hertz solution for the indentation of an elastic half - space within the context of linearized elasticity . In contrast , we propose a fully nonlinear , constrained mixture model for adherent cells that allows one to account separately for the contribu - tions of the three primary structural constituents of the cytoskeleton . Moreover , we extend a prior solution for a small indentation superimposed on a ﬁnite equibiaxial extension by incorporating in this mixture model for the special case of an initially random distribution of con - stituents ( actin , intermediate ﬁlaments , and microtu - bules ) . We submit that this theoretical framework will allow an improved interpretation of indentation force – depth data from a sub - class of atomic force microscopy tests and will serve as an important analytical check for future ﬁnite element models . The latter will be necessary to exploit further the capabilities of both atomic force microscopy and nonlinear mixture theories for cell behavior . 1 Introduction Among the myriad of exciting discoveries of modern biology is the observation that many types of cells re - spond dramatically to changes in their mechanical environment . Such cells may alter their orientation , shape , internal constitution , contraction , migration , adhesion , synthesis and degradation of extracellular constituents , or even their life cycle in response to per - turbations in mechanical loading ( Zhu et al . 2000 ) . Counted among these cell types are the chondrocytes , endothelial cells , epithelial cells , ﬁbroblasts , macro - phages , myocytes , and osteocytes , to name but a few . Although much has been learned about the mechano - sensitive responses of living cells , there remains a pressing need for quantiﬁcation and , in particular , for mathematically modeling the mechanobiology ( Fung 2002 ) . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) is one of several new technologies that promise to increase our under - standing of the mechanobiology and biomechanics of living cells ( Radmacher et al . 1992 ) . Brieﬂy , the AFM is a cantilever - based scanning probe that can be operated in two primary modes : the constant force mode allows the AFM to serve as a highly sensitive proﬁlometer , thus , enabling one to map the surface topography of a cell ( Fig . 1 ) ; the displacement mode allows one to per - form mechanical tests on cells , in particular , local indentation or local pulling following adhesion of the probe . The tip of the cantilever largely dictates the res - olution and ‘‘sphere of inﬂuence’’ of the mechanical interrogation . Tips can be microfabricated to have dif - ferent sizes and shapes , but many are on the order of 10 – 50 nm and shaped either as a cone or a blunted - cone with a spherical cap . In the displacement mode , common indentations are on the order of 50 – 500 nm , with the thickness of the cell often on the order of 1 – 3 l m . Most AFM - based studies of the mechanical behavior of living cells ( e . g . , Wu et al . 1998 ; Rotsch and Radm - acher 2000 ; Mathur et al . 2001 ) are interpreted using the S .

This solution was derived , of course , within the context of the many sim - plifying assumptions of classical elasticity : linear elastic behavior , material uniformity and homogeneity , isot - ropy , and inﬁnitesimal strains . Few of these assumptions apply to living cells or the associated test conditions ( Costa and Yin 1999 ) . Rather , cells are materially non - uniform , consisting of multiple families of structurally important and highly organized proteins that may ex - hibit a nonlinear behavior over ﬁnite deformations ( e . g . , see Janmey et al . 1991 ; Liu and Pollack 2002 ) . The purpose of this paper , therefore , is twofold : to present a new nonlinear constitutive model for cells that accounts for their inherent material non - uniformity as well as potential material and geometric nonlinearities , and to extend a prior solution from the ﬁnite elasticity literature for use in a sub - class of AFM studies of cell mechanics . In particular , we submit that a constrained mixture model of the cytoskeleton oﬀers potential advantages over many prior models , since one can account for constituent - speciﬁc changes in mechanical properties that have been reported recently in AFM studies ( e . g . , Wu et al . 1998 ; Rotsch and Radmacher 2000 ) . 2 Background 2 . 1 Constrained mixture models Adherent cells consist of three primary components : the cell membrane , cytoplasm , and nucleus . Whereas a complete description of cell mechanics will require sepa - rate descriptions of the mechanical properties of each component , here , we consider a homogenized idealiza - tion that holds away from the nucleus and in cases of negligible bending stiﬀness of the membrane . The cyto - plasm consists of a viscous ﬂuid ( called the cytosol ) , distributed organelles , and the cytoskeleton . The cyto - skeleton endows the cell with most of its structural integrity and consists of three primary constituents : actin ﬁlaments , intermediate ﬁlaments , and microtubules . These ﬁlaments are on the order of 5 – 25 nm in diameter and are often distributed throughout the cytoplasm . Although one could employ a full mixture theory ( see Rajagopal and Tao 1995 ) to describe the mechanics of such a multi - constituent material , which would require the solution of separate balance relations for the con - stituents , there is a lack of information on the interactions between the three primary constituents as well as between these constituents and the many accessory proteins ( Alberts et al . 2002 ) . Thus , it is not possible at present to postulate the constitutive relations for momentum ex - changes between constituents that are needed in a full mixture theory . Following Humphrey ( 2002a ) , therefore , we adopt a homogenized rule - of - mixtures model for the stress response . This allows us to include the separate contributions of the primary cytoskeletal ﬁlaments and viscous cytosol without having to solve separate balance relations for each constituent , to quantify the momentum exchanges , or to prescribe partial traction boundary conditions . A general rule - of - mixtures relation for the total Cauchy stress t ( subject to an overall linear momentum balance ) can be written as t ¼ P / k t k , where / k are individual mass fractions and t k are the individual stress responses , whether elastic or viscous . Indeed , including both the ‘‘elastic’’ response of the ﬁlaments and the ‘‘viscous’’ response of the cytosol may allow one to model some of the complex viscoelastic responses exhibited by cells ( e . g . , see Heidemann et al . 1999 ) . For motivational purposes , let us also consider a simple case wherein any mechano - sensitive changes in the polymerization or depolymerization of the structural ﬁlaments occur in but a single altered ( i . e . , new ) con - ﬁguration . In this case , one must track constituents that existed prior to the perturbation in loading ( original ) plus those produced thereafter ( new ) . Within the context of a rule - of - mixtures approach , the associated stress response can be written as ( Humphrey 2002a ) : t ¼ (cid:1) p I þ / c 2 ~ l D þ / ao t a F j ao (cid:1) (cid:2) þ / io t i F j io (cid:3) (cid:4) þ / mo t m F j mo (cid:1) (cid:2) þ / an t a F j an (cid:1) (cid:2) þ / in t i F j in (cid:3) (cid:4) þ / mn t m F j mn (cid:1) (cid:2) ð 1 Þ where p is a Lagrange multiplier that enforces incom - pressibility over transient loading , D is the stretching tensor ( i . e . , 2 D ¼ _ FF (cid:1) 1 þ F (cid:1) T _ F T where the over - dot de - notes a time - derivative ) , ~ l is a viscosity , the F j are deformation gradient tensors for each constituent rela - tive to individual natural conﬁgurations j o ( original ) or j n ( new ) , and the / s are mass fractions ( i . e . , constituent Fig . 1 Deﬂection image of a vascular smooth muscle cell isolated from the rat skeletal muscle arterioles . The AFM probe was scanned across the cell surfaces at a speed of 40 l m / s , with a tracking force of approximately 400 pN . The image was collected using Nanoscope IIIa Software 76 mass per total mass ) of individual constituents , which , by deﬁnition , are subject to the constraint : / c þ / ao þ / io þ / mo þ / an þ / in þ / mn ¼ 1 : ð 2 Þ Speciﬁcally , the subscript o denotes ‘‘original’’ and n denotes ‘‘new’’ whereas the superscripts c , a , i , and m denote cytosol , actin , intermediate ﬁlaments , and microtubules , respectively . In other words , we assume that the stress response depends both on the response of extant constituents that formed prior to any perturba - tion in loading as well as on constituents that formed thereafter . ( Note : although some constituents turn over continuously , there is no net change in mass fraction or mechanical behavior when they do so equally in an unchanging conﬁguration , which we refer to as mainte - nance . ) In the absence of turnover in an altered conﬁg - uration , the mass fractions of the new constituents are zero , thus yielding the standard rule - of - mixtures relation for stress . Finally , note that the assumption of a constrained mixture requires that constituents deform together ; be - cause these constituents may have diﬀerent natural ( i . e . , stress - free ) conﬁgurations , the individual deformation gradients F j need not be the same . Similarly , the individual stress responses t k are expected to diﬀer ( k = a , i , m for actin , intermediate ﬁlaments , and microtubules , respectively ) . Indeed , this is one of the primary advantages of a mixture theory . Nevertheless , we emphasize that , in such a formulation , the t k repre - sent ‘‘constituent - dominated’’ phenomenological re - sponses that implicitly include constituent - to - constituent interactions that cannot be quantiﬁed in suﬃcient detail ( see Brodland and Gordon 1990 ) . See Humphrey ( 2002a ) for more details on the basic theory . 2 . 2 Lessons from ﬁnite elasticity It has been well known for nearly a century that bio - logical soft tissues and elastomeric materials share many characteristic behaviors ( see Treloar 1975 ; Humphrey 2002b ) . This similarity results largely from both classes of materials exhibiting primarily an entropic , not energetic , elasticity due to their underlying long chain polymeric microstructures . Consequently , many results from ﬁnite ( rubber ) elasticity can be very useful in biomechanics . One solution that is particularly relevant to some AFM studies is that of a small , quasi - static indentation super - imposed on a ﬁnite equibiaxial stretch of an initially isotropic , nonlinearly elastic , materially uniform , incompressible material whose behavior is described by a strain - energy function W = W ( I 1 , I 2 ) . Brieﬂy , the associ - ated constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress is : t ¼ (cid:1) p I þ 2 @ W @ I 1 B (cid:1) 2 @ W @ I 2 B (cid:1) 1 ð 3 Þ where B = FF T is the left Cauchy – Green tensor and I 1 = tr C and 2 I 2 = ( tr C ) 2 (cid:1) tr C 2 are the principal invari - ants of the right Cauchy – Green tensor C = F T F . For an initial , ﬁnite equibiaxial stretch , we let F = diag [ l , l , k ] , where l is the in - plane stretch and k is the out - of - plane stretch ; by incompressibility , k = 1 / l 2 , thus , allowing the deformation to be parameterized by one stretch . For completeness , let us summarize past results for the small , superimposed indentation . The superimposed indentation force – depth ( P – d ) relationship was found by Green et al . ( 1952 ) and Beatty and Usmani ( 1975 ) . It can be written as : P ¼ 2 p C W ð Þ R W ð Þ ^ f d ð Þ ð 4 Þ where G ( W ) and S ( W ) are functionals that depend on the strain - energy function W and the ﬁnite equibiaxial stretch l , whereas the function ^ f d ð Þ depends on the geometry of the tip of the rigid indenter . For example , Costa and Yin ( 1999 ) list the following results for dif - ferent tip geometries . For a ﬂat - ended circular indenter of radius a : ^ f d ð Þ ¼ 2 a d p ; ð 5 Þ for a spherical tip of radius a : ^ f d ð Þ ¼ 4 3 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ a d 3 p ; ð 6 Þ for a conical tip with tip angle 2 F : ^ f d ð Þ ¼ 2 tan U p 2 d 2 ; ð 7 Þ and for a blunted cone - shaped tip of angle 2 F , which transitions at radius b to a spherical cap of radius a : ^ f (cid:1) d (cid:2) ¼ 2 p (cid:6) r c d (cid:1) r 2c 2 tan U (cid:7) p 2 (cid:1) arcsin (cid:7) b r c (cid:8)(cid:8) (cid:1) r 3c 3 a þ (cid:1) r 2c (cid:1) b 2 (cid:2) 1 = 2 (cid:7) b 2 tan U þ r 2c (cid:1) b 2 3 a (cid:8)(cid:9) ð 8 Þ where the radius of contact r c ‡ b and is obtained from Eq . 9 , namely ( Briscoe et al . 1994 ) d þ r c a r 2c (cid:1) b 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) 1 = 2 (cid:1) r c h i (cid:1) r c tan U p 2 (cid:1) arcsin b r c (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:6) (cid:9) ¼ 0 : ð 9 Þ Finally , Humphrey et al .

In the next section , we extend this result for a special case of a new relationship for cell mechanics that accounts for the separate contributions of the three primary cytoskeletal constituents . 3 New theoretical framework 3 . 1 A constitutive relation for cells Many diﬀerent models have been proposed for the constitutive behavior of cells ( e . g . , see Humphrey 2002a ; Stamenovic and Ingber 2002 ) . These include tensegrity models , percolation models , soft glassy rheological models , mixture models , and classical models based on linearized elasticity or viscoelasticity . Notwithstanding the potential advantages of the diﬀerent models , we submit that constrained rule - of - mixture models ( see Eq . 1 ) allow one to include nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity , diﬀerent properties and distributions of individual constituents , and , most importantly , the dif - ferent rates and extents of turnover of individual con - stituents . Here , therefore , consider the following relation for the Cauchy stress : t ¼ (cid:1) p I þ 2 F @ W @ C F T þ / c 2 ~ l / c ð Þ D ð 16 Þ where the viscosity may depend on the mass fraction of the cytosol . That is , as insoluble constituents are depo - lymerized , their fragments may alter the viscosity ( see Herant et al . 2003 ) . More important here , however , we borrow from the work of Lanir ( 1983 ) to construct a strain - energy function for a potentially evolving cyto - skeleton , while emphasizing that the resulting relations are microstructurally - motivated , but phenomenological , namely : W ¼ X N k ¼ 1 Z 2 p 0 Z p = 2 (cid:1) p = 2 / k R k u ; h ð Þ w k a k (cid:1) (cid:2) cos u d u d h ð 17 Þ where w k ( a k ) is a 1 - D strain energy function for a ﬁla - ment and a k is its stretch ; the superscript k can denote a particular constituent as well as its natural conﬁguration ( e . g . , original vs . new ) . The function R k ( / h ) represents the original distribution of orientations of a ﬁlament family k and / k are mass fractions . Consequently : @ W @ C MN ¼ X N k ¼ 1 Z 2 p 0 Z p = 2 (cid:1) p = 2 / k R k u ; h ð Þ @ w k @ a k @ a k @ C 0 11 @ C 0 11 @ C MN cos u d u d h ð 18 Þ where the 1 ¢ ( i . e . , primed ) coordinate axis coincides with the direction of a generic ﬁlament ( Fig . 2 ) , and C 0 11 is obtained from a tensorial transformation of C MN . This relation will prove useful below . Hence , we have : t ij ¼ (cid:1) p d ij þ 2 X N k ¼ 1 / k Z 2 p 0 Z p = 2 (cid:1) p = 2 R k u ; h ð Þ @ w k @ a k 1 2 a k (cid:3) @ C 0 11 @ C MN cos u d u d h ! F iM F jN þ / c 2 ~ l / c ð Þ D ij : ð 19 Þ Clearly then , in the absence of constituent turnover , our constitutive relation can be written as a simple rule - of - mixtures with each primary constituent having a single reference conﬁguration ( i . e . , N = 1 , 2 , 3 for original actin a , intermediate ﬁlaments i , and microtubules m ) , namely : t ¼ (cid:1) p I þ / a t a þ / i t i þ / m t m þ / c 2 ~ l / c ð Þ D : ð 20 Þ Turnover of constituents can easily be incorporated in Eq . 19 , in principle , given appropriate kinetics for the Fig . 2 Local spherical coordinate system used for microstructur - ally motivated , phenomenological constitutive relations of a living cell . The arrow represents the orientation of an individual ﬁlament belonging to any of the three primary families of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments . The function R k ( / , h ) quantiﬁes the distribution of all such orientations 78 mass fractions , information on the potential evolution of the individual natural conﬁgurations , and information on the potential evolution of the distribution of the ﬁlaments . This is left for subsequent consideration . 3 . 2 Small indentation superimposed on a ﬁnite equibiaxial stretch Conceptually , it may be prudent to think of at least four conﬁgurations for the cell in an AFM test ( Fig . 3 ) . First , we have a non - adherent cell with perhaps a fairly ran - dom distribution of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments . Deposition of the cell onto a substrate involves two phases : initial contact , with an upregulation of integrins , followed by an active spreading . Relative to the non - adherent refer - ence conﬁguration , we might think of this spreading as somewhat of an in - plane stretch . Finally , if the substrate is deformable , the cell could be stretched further prior to testing with the AFM . This potential sequence of events motivates the consideration of a small indentation superimposed on a large ‘‘in - plane’’ deformation of a mixture that originally had a nearly uniform distribution of constituents . Whereas the aforementioned solution for the relation P – d ( Eq . 4 ) was derived for a 3 - D stored energy function W ( I 1 , I 2 ) , the proposed strain - energy for the cell ( Eq . 17 ) is written in terms of individual 1 - D stored energy functions w k that depend solely on the stretch a k experienced by the individual constituent . Fortunately , these stretches relate to the macroscopic deformation C , if we assume aﬃne deformations . Hence , we merely need transformation relations between deriv - atives with respect to the invariants I i and those in terms of the components of C in order to utilize prior results for the indentation solution . Note , therefore , that : @ W @ C MN ¼ @ W @ I 1 @ I 1 @ C MN þ @ W @ I 2 @ I 2 @ C MN ð 21 Þ whereby , for an in - plane equibiaxial stretch , we need only to consider derivatives with respect to C 11 , C 22 , and C 33 . These provide three equations in terms of the two ‘‘unknown’’ derivatives of W with respect to I 1 and I 2 , which are denoted by W 1 and W 2 , respectively . For an equibiaxial stretch , however , the results for the in - plane components C 11 and C 22 are the same and it is easy to show that : W 1 ¼ 1 C 11 (cid:1) C 33 C 11 þ C 22 ð Þ @ W @ C 11 (cid:1) C 22 þ C 33 ð Þ @ W @ C 33 (cid:7) (cid:8) ¼ 1 l 2 (cid:1) k 2 2 l 2 @ W @ C 11 (cid:1) l 2 þ k 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) @ W @ C 33 (cid:7) (cid:8) ð 22 Þ W 2 ¼ 1 C 33 (cid:1) C 11 @ W @ C 11 (cid:1) @ W @ C 33 (cid:7) (cid:8) ¼ 1 k 2 (cid:1) l 2 @ W @ C 11 (cid:1) @ W @ C 33 (cid:7) (cid:8) ð 23 Þ Next , let W 1 ¼ ^ g C 11 ; C 22 ; C 33 ð Þ and W 2 ¼ ~ g C 11 ; C 22 ; C 33 ð Þ and consider the following derivatives : @ ^ g @ C MN ¼ @ ^ g @ I 1 @ I 1 @ C MN þ @ ^ g @ I 2 @ I 2 @ C MN and @ ~ g @ C MN ¼ @ ~ g @ I 1 @ I 1 @ C MN þ @ ~ g @ I 2 @ I 2 @ C MN ð 24 Þ which provide six equations in terms of the four ‘‘un - known’’ second derivatives of W with respect to the invariants , which we denote by W ij = W ji ( see Eq . 15 ) . As before , however , the equations for the components C 11 and C 22 provide the same information , thus leaving four equations . Solving these four equations for the four second derivatives of W with respect to the principal invariants of C yields : W 11 ¼ 1 C 11 (cid:1) C 33 ð Þ 2 (cid:3) C 11 þ C 22 ð Þ 2 @ 2 W @ C 211 (cid:1) 2 C 11 þ C 22 ð Þ C 22 þ C 33 ð Þ @ 2 W @ C 11 @ C 33 þ C 22 þ C 33 ð Þ 2 @ 2 W @ C 233 þ 2 C 11 þ C 22 ð Þ C 22 þ C 33 ð Þ C 11 (cid:1) C 33 ð Þ @ W @ C 33 (cid:1) @ W @ C 11 (cid:3) (cid:4) 2 64 3 75 ð 25 Þ W 12 ¼ 1 C 11 (cid:1) C 33 ð Þ 2 C 11 þ C 22 ð Þ @ 2 W @ C 33 @ C 11 (cid:1) @ 2 W @ C 211 (cid:3) (cid:4) þ C 22 þ C 33 ð Þ @ 2 W @ C 11 @ C 33 (cid:1) @ 2 W @ C 233 (cid:3) (cid:4) þ C 11 þ 2 C 22 þ C 33 ð Þ C 11 (cid:1) C 33 @ W @ C 11 (cid:1) @ W @ C 33 (cid:3) (cid:4) 2 6 4 3 7 5 ð 26 Þ Fig . 3 Four conﬁgurations for an adherent cell , including an assumed materially isotropic cell in a non - adherent , traction - free reference conﬁguration . Adherence and active spreading likely change the material symmetry from isotropic to anisotropic via an aﬃne deformation - dependent mechanism and possibly active remodeling ( not considered explicitly ) 79 where W 12 = W 21 and : W 22 ¼ 1 C 11 (cid:1) C 33 ð Þ 2 (cid:6) @ 2 W @ C 211 (cid:1) 2 @ 2 W @ C 11 @ C 33 þ @ 2 W @ C 233 þ 2 C 33 (cid:1) C 11 @ W @ C 11 (cid:1) @ W @ C 33 (cid:7) (cid:8)(cid:9) ð 27 Þ Recall that C = diag [ l 2 , l 2 , k 2 ] for our case herein , with k = 1 / l 2 , which allows these equations to be specialized . Most importantly , however , we can now compute A , B , C , and D in Eqs . 11 – 14 , and thus , compute G ( W ) / S ( W ) in Eq . 10—this allows us to compute indentation force – depth relations P – d for the model cell ( Eqs . 16 – 20 ) . Although the ﬁnal equation can be written directly , it proves expedient to calculate numerically the requisite quantities from these simple formulae 1 . Finally , because little is yet known about the speciﬁc functional forms of w k ( a k ) for the individual constituents of the cytoskeleton , or the associated values of the material parameters , we nondimensionalize the problem to allow illustrative simulations . Let length , time , and mass scales be , respectively : L s ¼ d ; T s ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ q d 2 E r ; M s ¼ q d 3 ð 28 Þ where d is the diameter of the cell in the non - adherent state ( see Fig . 3 ) , q is the overall mass density of the cell , and E ¼ lim l ! 1 C R (cid:7) (cid:8) ð 29 Þ where E is an initial overall elastic modulus of a cell that can be estimated at l = k = 1 , with G and S obtained from Eq . 10 . Consequently , Eq . 4 can be written as : W ¼ 2 p H g x ð Þ ð 30 Þ where W ¼ P d 2 E ; H ¼ C = R E ; g ¼ ^ f d ð Þ d 2 ð 31 Þ and x = d / d . 4 Illustrative simulations There is a pressing need for data that are suﬃcient for identifying speciﬁc forms of the constitutive functions ( including w k ( a k ) and R k ( / , h ) ) and calculating values of the associated material parameters for each constituent . Such data often have to await the development of a the - oretical framework , however , for , without a framework , one often does not know what to measure ( e . g . , overall modulus in a Hertz model versus stiﬀness and orientation for individual ﬁlaments ) . Notwithstanding the current lack of suﬃcient data , let us illustrate qualitatively some predictions of the present theoretical framework . Such simulations help us to develop intuition and indeed may help us to interpret future experimental results . 4 . 1 Illustrative mechanical behaviors Despite scant information on the mechanical behavior of individual ﬁlaments ( or , more precisely , ﬁlament - dominated behaviors that include the eﬀects of select accessory proteins ) , it appears that these behaviors may be qualitatively similar to those of soft tissue—nonlinear with slight hysteresis ( Janmey et al . 1991 ; Liu and Pollack 2002 ) . Hence , one possible form for the 1 - D energy function is ( Humphrey and Yin 1987 ) : w k a k (cid:1) (cid:2) ¼ 1 2 c k exp c k 1 a k (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) (cid:2) 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:1) 1 h i ð 32 Þ where c k and c 1 k are separate material parameters for each family of constituents k . Another possible form is ( Lanir 1983 ) : w k a k (cid:1) (cid:2) ¼ 1 2 c k 2 a k (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) (cid:2) 2 ð 33 Þ which yields a linear ﬁrst Piola – Kirchhoﬀ stress vs . stretch relation ( note : Eq . 32 reduces to Eq . 33 in the limit as a k ﬁ 1 , with c 2 k @ c k c 1 k , no sum on k ) . Similarly , despite increasing data from confocal and multi - photon microscopy , there is little information on speciﬁc distributions of the orientations of the cyto - skeletal ﬁlaments . For the purposes of illustration , however , consider a 3 - D von Mises – Fisher distribution that results directly from generalizing the von Mises distributions on the 2 - D circle ( Fisher et al . 1987 ) , namely : R k u ; h ð Þ ¼ j 4 p sinh j (cid:3) (cid:10) exp j (cid:1) cos u cos b cos h (cid:1) c ð Þ þ sin u sin b Þ (cid:11) ; (cid:1) p = 2 6 u 6 p = 2 ; 0 6 h 6 2 p ð Þ ð 34 Þ This distribution has three parameters : j , b , and c . j is a shape or concentration factor . The larger the value of j the more the distribution is concentrated towards the direction ( b , c ) —see Fig . 4 . b and c are location parameters where the distribution has rota - tional symmetry about the direction ( b , c ) . Since R k is a probability density function , its integral over all possible orientations must satisfy the normalization condition : Z 2 p 0 Z p = 2 (cid:1) p = 2 R k u ; h ð Þ cos u d u d h ¼ 1 8 k ð 35 Þ 1 Explicit derivations were carried out for a Mooney – Rivlin mate - rial whereby the classical result was conﬁrmed ( see Eq . 8 in Humphrey et al . 1991 ) . 80 4 . 2 Illustrative numerical results Recalling Fig . 3 , let us assume that each family of ﬁla - ments is randomly distributed in the non - adherent ref - erence conﬁguration . That is , let us assume an initial isotropy despite any stretch - induced anisotropy associ - ated with cell spreading or subsequent stretching of the substrate ( note : such stretch - induced changes in orien - tation can be calculated simply given a k m k ¼ F k j k M k where M k and m k are unit vectors in the direction of a particular ﬁlament in original and deformed conﬁgura - tions , respectively ) . Consequently , let R k ( / , h ) = 1 / 4 p . Let the mass fraction of the actin ﬁlaments be / a = 0 . 038 ( Cheng et al . 2000 ) . Material parameters for each ﬁla - ment within the cytoskeleton are chosen such that the actin ﬁlaments are stiﬀer in extension than the micro - tubules , with the intermediate ﬁlaments exhibiting an intermediate extensional stiﬀness ( Janmey et al . 1991 ) . Given such values , we can estimate the mass fractions of the microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments . Assuming that their mass fractions are the same , and using empirical results from Rotsch and Radmacher ( 2000 ) , which show that the ‘‘elastic modulus’’ of the cell de - creases by a factor of three when actin ﬁlaments are disrupted , we compare the initial elastic moduli E of two cases , control and actin - disrupted ( Eq . 29 ) . Of course , if the ﬁlament is disrupted completely , its mass fraction / k is zero . The parameters for our calculations are given in Table 1 . Finally , for purposes of non - dimensionaliza - tion , note that the volume of an average culture cell is approximately 4 pl ( Alberts et al . 2002 ) , thus , let d = 20 l m . Furthermore , let q = 1 g / ml for water , which is the most abundant substance in cells ( Alberts et al . 2002 ) . Assuming a quasi - static indentation ( i . e . , D = 0 in Eq . 16 ) , consider P – d ( actually Y – g ) results for diﬀerent values of the in - plane stretch l 2 [ 1 , 1 . 12 ] for both an exponential and a linear behavior ( Eq . 32 and Eq . 33 ) of the ﬁlaments and with a ﬂat - ended cylindrical indenter ( Fig . 5 ) . Similarly , consider results at a single stretch ( l = 1 . 2 ) for exponential - type ﬁlament behaviors with four diﬀerent indenter tips ( Fig . 6a ) . If we interpret the slope of the force – depth relation as a measure of the ‘‘stiﬀness’’ of the cell , we see that both the degree of ﬁnite stretch ( e . g . , degree of spreading ) and the geometry of the tip dramatically aﬀect this result , given the same material properties . In particular , only the ﬂat - ended tip yields a linear force – depth relation for the small inden - tation . The non - ﬂat - tipped indenters contact increas - ingly more material as they indent deeper . Finally , note that removal of individual constituents reduces the stiﬀness as expected ( Fig . 6b ) : disruption of the actin ﬁlaments can reduce the stiﬀness substantially , whereas there can be little contribution to the overall cytoskeletal stiﬀness by the microtubules or intermediate ﬁlaments . This observation agrees with the empirical ﬁndings of Wakatsuki et al . ( 2000 ) and Wu et al . ( 1998 ) . Although not shown , additional simulations with diﬀerent values of the material parameters ( see Table 1 ) revealed quali - tatively similar results : decreasing the stiﬀness of the actin dramatically decreased the indentation force at a given indentation depth and tip - geometry , whereas uniformly raising or lowering the values of the param - eters had no eﬀect due to the non - dimensionalization .

( 2000 ) . The volume fractions of the microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments were estimated from Eqs . 10 – 15 and Eq . 29 , and from the experiments of Rotsch and Radmacher ( 2000 ) . Stiﬀness and material parameters were assumed based on Janmey ( 1991 ) ; c 2 / E was selected for direct comparisons between the exponential and linear models Fig . 4a , b Illustrative ( possible ) distributions of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments given by a von Mises – Fisher distribution function ( see Eq . 34 ) . a j = 3 , b = 0 , c = p / 4 . b j = 7 , b = 0 , c = p / 4 81 5 Discussion Many diﬀerent experimental methods exist for interro - gating the biomechanical properties and mechanobio - logical responses of cells . They include : atomic force microscopy , magnetic bead cytometry , microfabricated cantilevers , micropatterned surfaces , micropipet aspira - tion , optical traps , stretching of cells on ﬂexible mem - branes , laminar ﬂow chambers , and rotating bioreactors . Each method promises new insight into the wonderfully complex structure , function , and properties of living cells , and each warrants rigorous biomechanical analysis . Herein , we focused on atomic force microscopy not only because of its widespread usage , but primarily because of its frequent inappropriate interpretation based on the classical Hertz solution . Many investigators recognize that the simplifying assumptions inherent to the Hertz solution do not apply in most AFM studies on cells . This was shown convincingly via ﬁnite element simulations by Costa and Yin ( 1999 ) —they wrote , ‘‘Widely applied inﬁni - tesimal strain models agreed with FEM results for linear elastic materials , but yielded substantial errors in the estimated properties for nonlinear elastic materi - als . ’’ Consequently , some employ nonlinear empirical P – d relations and then try to ascribe meaning to the associated parameters ( e . g . , Miyazaki and Hayashi 1999 ; Sato et al . 2000 ) . This approach is limited , however , by the inability to separate structural from material stiﬀnesses ; indeed , it has no biomechanical basis . Alternatively , others appear to rationalize using the Hertz solution by arguing that measuring absolute values of the material properties is less important than delineating relative changes from cell - to - cell or inter - vention - to - intervention . Finally , some appear to use the Hertz solution simply because of a lack of a viable Fig . 5a , b Combined out - of - plane indentation and in - plane equi - biaxial stretch for a exponential - type ﬁlaments and b linear - type ﬁlaments , each indented by a ﬂat - ended circular cylinder with radius 30 nm . Each line corresponds to diﬀerent in - plane stretches , from lower to upper , of l = 1 . 00 to 1 . 12 in steps of 0 . 02 . All results are non - dimensional to emphasize the qualitative responses , not the speciﬁc values Fig . 6a , b Combined indentation and equibiaxial in - plane stretch , l = 1 . 2 , for the exponential - type ﬁlament behavior . a Eﬀects of four diﬀerent indenter tips : ﬂat - ended circular cylinder with radius a = 30 nm ( dash - dotted line , which is linear ) , sphere with radius a = 30 nm ( dashed line ) , cone with tip angle 2 F = 75 (cid:2) ( dotted line ) , and blunted cone with tip angle 2 F = 75 (cid:2) and radius a = 30 nm ( solid line ) . The nonlinear responses ( for all but the ﬂat - ended indenter ) are due , in part , to the nonlinearly increasing contact area between the indenter and cell . b Eﬀects of cytoskeleton disrupting drugs with blunted cone , with 2 F = 75 (cid:2) and a = 30 nm : control ( solid line ) , actin ﬁlament disrupting drugs ( dotted line for disruption of all actin ﬁlaments , and dash - dotted line disruption of half the actin ﬁlaments ) , and microtubule and intermediate ﬁlament disrupting drugs ( dashed line ) . We assume that , if the ﬁlament is disrupted completely , the mass fraction / of the corresponding ﬁlament is zero . Note that the predicted behavior is dominated by the actin . All results are non - dimensional to emphasize the qualitative responses , not the speciﬁc values 82 alternative . Mathur et al . ( 2001 ) imply , for example , that there is simply a need for further development of applicable theoretical frameworks . Regardless , there is a pressing need to move beyond the assumptions of a linearly elastic behavior of a single constituent contin - uum under inﬁnitesimal strains . The approach and ﬁndings of Costa and Yin ( 1999 ) represent a pivotal step in improving analyses of AFM experiments . Nonetheless , their ﬁnite element solutions are limited , largely because of the use of a commer - cially available code that is best suited for strain – energy functions W ¼ ^ W I 1 ; I 2 ð Þ that describe the iso - tropic behavior of single constituent ( i . e . , materially uniform ) continua . Cells , in contrast , contain multiple structurally important constituents that are able to remodel individually to diﬀerent extents and at dif - ferent rates . Indeed , recent advances in molecular biology that allow one to selectively modify individual constituents ( see , e . g . , Wu et al . 1998 ; Rotsch and Radmacher 2000 ) necessitate a more general theoreti - cal framework for analysis . Albeit based on a number of simplifying assumptions—e . g . , small , quasi - static indentations on equibiaxially stretched cells—the ap - proach presented herein can account for the separate orientations , properties , and deformations of multiple constituents within the cytoskeleton , and , thus , chan - ges in the mechanical response of cells that are induced by biological or mechanical stimuli , such as applying cytoskeleton disrupting drugs or pre - stretch . Indeed , despite the need to introduce particular con - stitutive relations to numerically illustrate the theory , these can be varied easily as demanded by increasingly better data , thus rendering the overall theory more general . We emphasize that the two primary uses of such a framework should be to guide experimentation ( e . g . , highlight what needs to be measured , such as constituent properties , orientations , and mass fractions ) and to serve as a check for future ﬁnite element analyses of AFM , which will be needed to study additional classes of tests . In particular , the present results cannot be used in cases wherein the indentation is above the nucleus or near the periphery where the eﬀects of the underlying substrate are pronounced . In such cases , ﬁnite element analyses will be essential . Likewise , the present results should only be used in tests wherein the indentation is ‘‘small’’ and ‘‘quasi - static . ’’ This reminds us again that theory should guide experiment . Finally , the most basic issue is that of the continuum assumption . The dimensions of the cell are on the order of micrometers whereas those of the cytoskeletal ﬁlaments are on the order of nanome - ters , which suggest that a continuum assumption may be reasonable , as used in most papers to date . Nevertheless , the diameter of the indenter is often on the order of 10 – 50 nm , similar to that of the diameters of the primary constituents , thus , this merits careful attention . This could be addressed , in part , by comparing predictions with additional experiments and would likely be aided by simultaneous imaging of the cytoskeleton . Conversely , one may need to consider larger diameter indenters , particularly ones that are ﬂat - ended , for they alone can yield linear force – depth data . Of course , in the ﬁnal analysis , as noted by Truesdell and Noll ( 1965 ) , ‘‘Whether the continuum approach is justiﬁed , in any particular case , is a matter , not for the philosophy or methodology of science , but for the experimental test . ’’ Each case must be so justiﬁed , depending on the par - ticular test and its overall goal . Going beyond a con - tinuum approach will , of course , require remarkably ﬁne detail on the distributions and interactions of all con - stituents—a signiﬁcant challenge . In conclusion , the complex structure and properties of living cells demand continued research into improved models . At the minimum , we should account for the nonlinear material behavior over ﬁnite strains of a multi - constituent material . The present paper describes one step toward that goal , one that synthesizes prior work on microstructural models of soft tissues and an ana - lytical solution from ﬁnite elasticity . It is hoped that this new model allows improved interpretation of sub - classes of AFM tests and , more importantly , that it provides some direction for further research .
