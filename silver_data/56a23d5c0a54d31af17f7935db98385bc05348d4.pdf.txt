Director Department of Dental Hygiene Idaho State University Campus Box 8048 Pocatello , Idaho 83209 This paper reports on a survey of the information - seeking , critical - analysis , and computer - application practices of dental hygienists . Questionnaires were mailed to a convenience sample of seventy - one dental hygiene practitioners . A 62 % response rate was achieved . Results indicated that discussions with colleagues , continuing education courses , journals , and newsletters were the sources used most frequently for professional development and information retrieval . To evaluate professional information , these hygienists tended to rely on personal experience , credibility of the journal , and discussions with colleagues . Word processing was the most frequently used computer application ; online database searching was rare in this group . Computer use within the employment setting was primarily for business rather than clinical applications . Many hygienists were interested in attending continuing education courses on use of computers to acquire professional information . INTRODUCTION Health practitioners need information management skills to cope with the growing volume of medical knowledge [ 1 - 7 ] . The ability to quickly access , track , coordinate , critique , and store information is essential to informed daily decision making related to patient care , education , and research [ 8 ] . In addition , changes in the health care systems of industrialized countries have placed new demands on health care services . Delivery of care has " become interwoven with adop - tion of and adaption to computer and information technologies " [ 9 ] . Dental hygienists function in a constantly chang - ing information environment and need to keep up to date in the practice of their profession . Not only does information facilitate their ability to make valid decisions and statements about dental hygiene , but information also enables hygienists to provide qual - ity care to their patients . There has been little research on dental hygienists ' information - seeking practices . Bull Med Libr Assoc 83 ( 4 ) October 1995 446 Dental hygienists The few studies that have been conducted indicate that dental hygienists primarily use continuing ed - ucation courses to obtain information [ 10 - 13 ] . There were no studies found on computer applications used by dental hygenists in patient care , education , and research . It would be useful to identify information - seeking practices , computer applications used , and the degree of user comfort in this profession . There - fore , a survey was undertaken to provide preliminary findings on the validity of the questionnaire for a larger study [ 14 - 15 ] . This paper reports those initial findings . METHODOLOGY A thirty - six - item questionnaire was developed to as - sess the information - seeking , critical - analysis , and computer - application practices of dental hygienists . Numerous studies in the dental , nursing , and medical fields were examined before designing the question - naire [ 16 - 41 ] . Then an exploratory survey was carried out to evaluate the validity of the measuring instru - ment in preparation for a larger study [ 42 - 43 ] . In July 1992 , a cover letter ; questionnaire ; and stamped , self - addressed reply envelope were sent to a sample of seventy - one dental hygiene practitioners . These hygienists were selected because of longevity in the profession as well as variation in employment practices . No follow - up questionnaires were sent to nonrespondents . Subjects were informed that all re - sponses would be confidential and reported only in group form . Statistical analysis included the calculation of fre - quencies , percentages , and means . A t test was used at the . 05 level of significance to analyze variation in type of employment setting as it affected information - seeking and computer - application practices . Results , however , cannot be generalized beyond the selected population due to the small sample size used in this study . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Forty - four ( 62 % ) of seventy - one questionnaires were returned and used for data tabulation . Not all re - spondents answered each question ; percentages are based on total responses to each question . The hy - gienists employed in private clinical practice ( PCP ) were compared to those working in alternative em - ployment settings ( AES ) represented by education , public health , hospitals , and other employment set - tings besides those listed . Given the small sample , it is difficult to draw valid conclusions regarding these comparisons ; however , there were some differences between these groups . Demographic profile Representation in the sample by state was California , 24 ( 54 . 5 % ) ; Hawaii , 7 ( 15 . 9 % ) ; Colorado and Maryland , 2 each , for a total of 4 ( 9 . 1 % ) ; and Arizona , Georgia , Iowa , Maine , Montana , Nevada , New York , Ohio , and Virginia , 1 each , for a total of 9 ( 20 . 5 % ) . All hygienists were female , ranging in age from 30 to 67 years , with a mean age of 42 . 9 years . Year of graduation from dental hygiene school ranged from 1959 to 1984 . Thir - ty - four of the respondents held certificates or asso - ciate degrees in dental hygiene ( 77 . 3 % ) , twenty - one held baccalaureate degrees ( 47 . 7 % ) , eleven had a mas - ter ' s degree ( 25 % ) , and four had doctorates ( 9 . 1 % ) . One respondent had become a dentist ( 2 . 3 % ) . These respondents averaged twenty years of employment in the dental field . Twelve hygienists conducted professional re - search , and ten had published in professional jour - nals . Thirty - five hygienists belonged to professional associations ( 79 . 5 % ) , an average of 2 . 4 groups each . Hygienists in PCP ( n = 19 ) joined an average of 1 . 5 professional associations , while those in AES ( n = 15 ) averaged 3 . 6 association memberships . Thirty - six ( 81 . 8 % ) hygienists were employed at the time the questionnaire was completed , with the re - maining eight not employed . All forty - four hygien - ists had worked in clinical practice , averaging 16 . 7 years of employment in that setting . Twenty - six hy - gienists had worked in PCP only ( 59 . 1 % ) . Eighteen hygienists had worked in AES ( 40 . 9 % ) , and ten re - spondents had worked in more than one type of AES ( 22 . 7 % ) . Eleven hygienists were educators ( 25 % ) , and two were directors of professional degree programs . Eight hygienists had worked in public health , five were administrators of public health programs , and two had been employed in hospital settings . A source of confusion in interpreting employment practices is the number of different work settings within which dental hygienists can be employed . In this population sample , thirty - six hygienists worked in 49 settings , resulting in an average of 1 . 4 work settings per hygienist . Thirty - nine of these employ - ment settings had computers ( 79 . 6 % ) . Of those lack - ing computers , 2 private - practice settings had plans to acquire equipment within the next twelve months . Thus , results indicated that 41 of 49 employment set - tings would have computers within the year ( 83 . 7 % ) . Professional information Ninety - three percent of respondents felt it was im - portant to stay current with dental hygiene infor - mation . When asked if the volume of professional information was unmanageable , 37 . 2 % agreed , and an equal percentage disagreed . Many hygienists found it difficult to keep up with their reading of relevant Bull Med Libr Assoc 83 ( 4 ) October 1995 447 Gravois et al .

" information ( 59 . 5 % ) . Sixty - two percent found it was difficult to find time to search and retrieve informa - tion related to their professional interests . Also , the majority of respondents ( 66 . 7 % ) felt it would be useful to be able to search through a variety of professional articles when information was needed at work . A total of 164 journals was received by the forty - four hygienists , so the average number of profes - sional journals received each month was 3 . 7 , with a range from 0 to 15 . The PCP hygienists ( n = 26 ) re - ceived 71 journals each month , for an average of 2 . 7 journals per person . The AES hygienists ( n = 18 ) re - ceived 93 journals each month , for an average of 5 . 2 journals per person . Respondents indicated that , of 164 journals , 66 ( 40 . 2 % ) were read thoroughly , 82 ( 50 % ) were read occasionally , and 15 ( 9 . 2 % ) contents were just browsed . One person ( 0 . 6 % ) received a journal but did not read it . Respondents received 114 professional newsletters or magazines each month , for an average of 2 . 6 news - letters per hygienist , with a range from 0 to 10 . The PCP hygienists ( n = 26 ) received 51 publications , for an average of 2 per person , while those in AES ( n = 18 ) received 63 , for an average of 3 . 5 publications per person . Forty - nine of these publications were read thoroughly ( 43 % ) , forty - three occasionally ( 37 . 7 % ) , twenty - one browsed ( 18 . 4 % ) , and one was discarded ( 0 . 9 % ) . Two questions provided a multi - item list of re - sources with a frequency - of - use scale to determine sources used for professional development and sources used to obtain professional information . For profes - sional development sources , hygienists most fre - quently used discussions with colleagues ( 79 . 1 % ) , continuing education courses ( 69 . 8 % ) , and journals ( 67 . 4 % ) , while library resources ( 14 % ) , computer searches ( 9 . 4 % ) , and audiocassettes ( 9 . 5 % ) were used infrequently ( Table 1 ) . Results indicated the main sources used for obtain - ing professional information pertinent to the practice of dental hygiene were asking colleagues ( 62 . 8 % ) and browsing journals , books , and newsletters ( 54 . 8 % ) , while conducting ( 9 . 5 % ) or having someone else con - duct ( 14 . 6 % ) a computer search and using the public library ( 2 . 4 % ) were used infrequently ( Table 2 ) . Some sources were used significantly more often by the AES than the PCP hygienists : medical or dental library , conducting a computer search , and having a com - puter search done by someone else . Thus , the sources used most frequently by this sam - ple of hygienists for professional development and job - related information retrieval were continuing ed - ucation courses , discussions with colleagues , and journals . These information - seeking practices are similar to those found in other studies of the medical and dental professions [ 44 - 51 ] . When asked to identify barriers encountered when seeking professional information , eight hygienists designated " time . " Other cited barriers included problems with " availability or accessibility " of re - sources . One hygienist lived in an isolated state with no dental school and felt that public - health budget restrictions limited resources . Uncertainty concern - ing where specific information could be found was expressed by other respondents . " It is difficult to quickly find articles pertaining to a particular sub - ject , " stated one respondent . Five respondents indi - cated there were no barriers , with one stating , " I work in a four - office specialist complex that has many re - sources available . " The hygienists also were asked about their prox - imity to a collection of dental information sources Bull Med Libr Assoc 83 ( 4 ) October 1995 448 Dental hygienists Table 2 Sources used by dental hygienists to obtain professional information Frequency Always Often Sometimes Never Source * n No . % No . % No . % No . % Ask a colleague 43 9 20 . 9 18 41 . 9 15 34 . 9 1 2 . 3 Browse joumals , books , newsletters 42 11 26 . 2 12 28 . 6 16 38 . 1 3 7 . 1 Medical / dental library 42 4 9 . 5 6 14 . 3 10 23 . 8 22 52 . 4 Consult manufacturer / sales rep 42 1 2 . 4 4 9 . 5 26 61 . 9 11 26 . 2 Conduct computer search 42 3 7 . 1 1 2 . 4 7 16 . 7 31 73 . 8 Have computer search done 41 1 2 . 4 5 12 . 2 4 9 . 8 31 75 . 6 Public library 42 0 - 1 2 . 4 9 21 . 4 32 76 . 2 Continuing education courset 1 1 Ask the dentistt 1 Call agenciest 1 1 Requested reference studies via mailt 1 1 Sources ranked in order of highest combined responses to " always " and " often . " t These other sources were added by hygienists . and impact of proximity on access to these sources . It appears that distance is a factor . Twenty - five of the responding hygienists lived within twenty miles of a dental information collection . Twelve hygienists did not find a ten - mile distance to be a limiting factor . On the other hand , among those that were more than ten but less than twenty miles away , four respondents felt this distance was not a factor in their ability to access dental information . Evaluation of information Responses to a multi - item question with a frequency - of - use scale indicated that hygienists rely on personal experience ( 95 . 4 % ) , the credibility of a journal ( 90 . 7 % ) , and discussions with colleagues ( 74 . 4 % ) to evaluate professional information . Less - popular evaluation tools were methodology used ( 65 . 2 % ) , author ' s rep - utation ( 41 . 9 % ) , consultation with professional asso - ciations ( 23 . 3 % ) , and professional teaching institu - tions ( 16 . 7 % ) . There was a significant difference in this area between PCP and AES hygienists , with the latter consulting teaching institutions more frequent - ly to critically analyze professional information . Dental informatics The majority of respondents ( 75 % ) did not know what the term dental informatics meant . Twenty - nine of the hygienists owned a computer ( 65 . 9 % ) , and eight oth - ers had access to a computer . Within this group , four - teen of thirty - seven hygienists had modems ( 37 . 8 % ) . One respondent did not know if there was a modem connected to the computer . Among hygienists with - out access to a computer , two had plans to purchase a computer within the next twelve months . Eleven hygienists had conducted computer data - base searches when looking for professional infor - mation ( 25 % ) , while another respondent ' s secretary did this task . Nine hygienists ( all AES ) indicated spe - cific databases used to retrieve information . When asked to choose from a list or fill in blank spaces , results showed that seven hygienists had used MED - LINE ( 15 . 9 % ) , two had used DENTALPROJ ( 4 . 5 % ) , two had used AIDSLINE ( 4 . 5 % ) , one hygienist added GRATEFUL MED , and another stated that " a database was developed in - house for staff only . " Another multi - item question assessed nine com - puter applications , the degree of comfort using each application , and level of respondent training . A Lik - ert rating scale was used to establish the degree of comfort ( Table 3 ) . Twenty hygienists were very or moderately comfortable using the word - processing application ( 45 . 5 % ) . Sixteen of the twenty - eight hy - gienists who indicated use of this application had training ( 57 . 1 % ) . Use rates for the other eight appli - cations ranged from fifteen using computer - aided in - struction ( 34 . 1 % ) to no users for " voice activated clin - ical exams . " The AES hygienists used word process - ing and database management with a statistically sig - nificant higher degree of comfort than did PCP respondents . Thirty - nine employment settings had computers . Respondents who worked in these settings were asked to designate specific computer applications used and type of setting . Five different employment settings ( PCP , hospital , public health , teaching institution , and " other " ) were listed . Due to the limited representa - tion for all settings except PCP , the other employment settings were consolidated . Findings indicated that the most commonly used computer applications were accounts and billing functions ( 76 . 9 % ) and word pro - Bull Med Libr Assoc 83 ( 4 ) October 1995 449 Gravois et al .

The " bibliographic search and re - trieval of information " application was used in ten ( 25 . 6 % ) of thirty - nine employment settings , with more frequent use in AES than in PCP ( Table 4 ) . These findings indicate that many hygienists owned or had access to a computer yet rarely retrieved in - formation pertinent to the practice of their profession through database searching . Word processing was the most frequently used application . Computer appli - cations used within the employment settings were primarily for business rather than clinical functions ; these results are similar to other health profession studies [ 52 - 53 ] . The questionnaire concluded with three questions concerning interest in and opinions about computers . Twenty - four of the respondents thought computer skills would assist them in accessing information needed in dental hygiene practice ( 54 . 5 % ) . Twenty - eight hygienists were interested in continuing edu - cation courses on how to use the computer to acquire professional information ( 63 . 6 % ) . Also , the majority of these hygienists felt that computer skills should be introduced to students while they were obtaining a dental hygiene degree ( 70 . 5 % ) . CONCLUSIONS It is important to know how dental hygienists acquire professional information . Knowledge of information - seeking practices helps in delineating effective means of disseminating dental hygiene information . Such knowledge also serves as a foundation for providing dental hygienists with guidelines for information management and defining the skills they will need to cope with an increasingly computerized health care environment . The results of this survey suggest there may be differences in information - seeking practices and computer applications based on the type of employ - ment setting . Due to the small sample used in this study , the findings need to be validated with a larger sample of hygienists . It is difficult to compare information - seeking prac - tices and computer applications used in the dental and medical fields due to variations in clinical prac - tice resources . Most dental personnel work in private offices , while many medical personnel work in hos - pitals and clinics . Larger facilities often have more space and money to provide an assortment of infor - mation resources and computerized equipment that would not be feasible within a solo practice . There - fore , comparisons of the medical and dental fields need to acknowledge the differences in technical re - source bases . Overall , the sample of hygienists in this study had limited computer skills . Many respondents felt that computer skills would be helpful in accessing infor - mation needed in professional practice and were in - terested in attending continuing education courses to learn about online database searching . The major - ity of hygienists also indicated that computer skills should be introduced to students while they are ob - taining their dental hygiene degree .
