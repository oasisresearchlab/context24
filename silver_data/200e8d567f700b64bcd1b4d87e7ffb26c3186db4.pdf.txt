Supplementary information Nanoindentation and finite element modelling of chitosan - alginate multilayer coated hydrogel . Tatyana Sherstova , a Bjørn Torger Stokke , a Bjørn Skallerud , b Gjertrud Maurstad , a and Victorien Emile Prot b , * Figure S1 . Dot - plot of estimated Youngs modulus from individual Type I force – indentation data for the 7 % AAM - co - AMPSA ( a ) and 10 % AAM - co - AMPSA ( b ) hydrogels series . The parameters are extracted from force indentation data collected at a maximum force of 3 nN and waiting time at this contact of 3 secs . The Hertz model was used . Note that the Youngs modulus provided are obtained from Hertz analyses and do not take into account the heterogeneity of the materials tested . The relative standard deviations for the 7 % AAM - co - AMPSA samples series are observed to 1 . 5 % ( Bare gels ) ; 24 % ( 4ML ) and 28 % ( 8ML ) . The relative standard deviations for the 10 % AAM - co - AMPSA samples series are observed to 2 . 1 % ( Bare gels ) ; 25 % ( 4ML ) and 29 % ( 8ML ) .
