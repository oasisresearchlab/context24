We sequenced BCAs in patients with autism or related NDDs , revealing disruption of 33 loci in four general categories : ( 1 ) genes previously associated with abnormal neurodevelopment ( e . g . , AUTS2 , FOXP1 , and CDKL5 ) , ( 2 ) single - gene con - tributors to microdeletion syndromes ( MBD5 , SATB2 , EHMT1 , and SNURF - SNRPN ) , ( 3 ) novel risk loci ( e . g . , CHD8 , KIRREL3 , and ZNF507 ) , and ( 4 ) genes associated with later - onset psychiatric disorders ( e . g . , TCF4 , ZNF804A , PDE10A , GRIN2B , and ANK3 ) . We also discovered among neurodeve - lopmental cases a profoundly increased burden of copy - number variants from these 33 loci and a signiﬁcant enrichment of polygenic risk alleles from genome - wide association studies of autism and schizophrenia . Our ﬁndings suggest a polygenic risk model of autism and reveal that some neurode - velopmental genes are sensitive to perturbation by multiple mutational mechanisms , leading to variable phenotypic outcomes that manifest at different life stages .

However , the near ubiquitous use of chromo - somal microarrays in research and clinical diagnostics has limited the assessment of those classes of SV that do not involve large gains and losses of genetic material , such as inversions , excision / insertions , and translocations , which together consti - tute balanced chromosomal abnormalities ( BCAs ) . These events are typically deﬁned clinically at karyotypic resolution and impli - cate only broad chromosomal regions , without the gene - level sequence speciﬁcity that would permit informative interpreta - tion . Even in the research setting , there is often a failure to consider or assess BCAs , consequently bypassing a meaningful proportion of subjects with genetic events that may mark a single locus of potentially large effect . These balanced events offer a unique route , complementary to conventional approaches , for identifying individual genes or functional sequences that con - tribute to otherwise genetically complex human disorders . At cytogenetic resolution , the estimated frequency of BCAs in ASD is 1 . 3 % ( Marshall et al . , 2008 ) , an approximately 6 - fold increase over that observed in more than 10 , 000 reproductively normal controls ( Ravel et al . , 2006 ) . This ratio is almost certainly a lower bound for relative risk , given the resolution of available techniques and the inability to survey submicroscopic balanced alterations . Thus , BCAs have a meaningful impact in ASD and represent a fertile area for high - resolution study to identify func - tional sequences that contribute to human neurodevelopment . We previously described innovations in the molecular approach to massively parallel sequencing and tailored bioinfor - matics applicable to the rapid , high - resolution discovery of chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints ( Talkowski et al . , 2011a ) . These and conceptually similar methods were recently used to derive potential mechanisms of chromosomal rear - rangements in B - lymphocytes ( Chiarle et al . , 2011 ; Klein et al . , 2011 ) , to delineate complex chromosomal rearrangements and chromothripsis in cancer cells ( Stephens et al . , 2011 ) , and to document balanced chromothripsis and predominant nonho - mologous repair in the human germline and transgenic animals ( Chiang et al . , 2012 ) . Here , with nucleotide resolution , we pre - cisely characterize karyotypically deﬁned human constitutional chromosomal rearrangements : 36 de novo BCAs and two in - herited rearrangements that were transmitted from an affected parent . The results of our sequencing analyses , coupled with extensive secondary genomics support , indicate that disruption of genes from awide range of biological pathways can contribute to ASD . In many instances , the same genes also confer risk , sometimes via different mutational mechanisms , to a range of NDDs and psychiatric disorders in both children and adults . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of Genes Contributing to Neurodevelopmental Abnormalities Using a series of previously developed next - generation sequencing techniques ranging from high - depth whole - genome sequencing to a targeted capture of breakpoints approach ( Talk - owski et al . , 2011a ) , we delineated BCAs in 38 subjects with neurodevelopmental abnormalities ; these subjects include two monozygotic twin pairs ( 36 independent probands ) . All harbored a BCA that appeared balanced at karyotypic resolution and was interpreted as pathogenic by the clinical geneticist ; 36 aberra - tions arose de novo , whereas two alterations were transmitted from an affected parent and thus segregated with the pheno - type . Extensive clinical data were collected for all subjects and affected parents , as described in the Supplemental Information ( available online ) . If a structured diagnostic interview was per - formed , or a patient was formally diagnosed with autism or an ASD by the referring clinician according to DSM - IV criteria , they are referred to herein as ASD ( 50 % of subjects ) ; otherwise the disorder was classiﬁed as NDD , although many such subjects also displayed clinical features consistent with ASD . For complete clinical information for each subject and each BCA breakpoint , conﬁrmed by PCR and capillary sequencing , see Data S1 : Phenotypic and Sequencing Information on Indi - vidual Patients . Previously performed genetic testing was also obtained , and all results were unremarkable with 244 , 000 or 1 million feature array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) unless otherwise described in the Supplemental Information . This BCA sequencing approach uncovered genes that con - formed to four general classiﬁcations , and there was meaningful overlap between categories : ( 1 ) genes previously implicated in ASD or NDD and conﬁrmed here by their heterozygous inactiva - tion , ( 2 ) genes discovered to be single - locus contributors to microdeletion syndromes , ( 3 ) genes not previously implicated individually in ASD or NDD , and ( 4 ) genes previously associated with adolescent - and adult - onset psychiatric disorders by common variant genome - wide association studies ( GWASs ) or other approaches ; all but three of these represent novel ASD or NDD loci . Alterations in gene expression were also assessed for all subjects where a lymphoblastoid cell line could be obtained ( 33 of 38 subjects ; Figure S1 ) . If a gene was not directly disrupted , positional effects on expression were evaluated for genes in proximity to the breakpoint . All genes and sequences disrupted by BCAs are presented in Table S1 along with results of mRNA expression studies , whereas the subset of genes , supported by secondary analyses , is presented below and in Table 1 . Convergent Data from Molecular Diagnostics Although the presence of a BCA is conservatively associated with an (cid:1) 6 - fold increased risk of ASD , any individual BCA is rare and generally nonrecurrent , precluding assessment of false discovery by replication ; consequently , we analyzed copy - number variants ( CNVs ) to test whether speciﬁc locus hemi - zygosity contributes to genetic risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities . We curated and analyzed a large collection of 33 , 573 cases from molecular diagnostic facilities and identiﬁed that subset of cases referred for a variety of neurodevelopmental abnormalities ( n = 19 , 556 ) , as well as that comprising cases without a referral indication of NDD ( n = 14 , 017 ) . We also surveyed CNV data from 13 , 991 controls screened for absence of a reported developmental or psychiatric phenotype . Although 526 Cell 149 , 525 – 537 , April 27 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . almost 25 % of the 19 , 556 cases with neurodevelopmental abnormalities were referred for testing with an indication of autism or ASD , we did not have direct access to clinical records to conﬁrm this diagnosis so we conservatively describe these cases by using the broader term NDD . Our ﬁndings indicate that genes disrupted by BCAs in ASD individuals frequently show increased CNV burden across the diagnostic cases referred for ASD as well as those referred for other neurodeve - lopmental abnormalities , suggesting that the genes discovered can contribute to phenotypic outcomes that are not constrained by ASD diagnostic criteria . An example of the convergent genomic information collected in this study is depicted in Figure 1 ; sequencing of monozygotic twins with extensive clinical information revealed a translocation disrupting TCF4 , a gene previously implicated in both Pitt - Hopkins syndrome and schizophrenia , with concomitantly decreased mRNA expression in both subjects and a signiﬁcant impact of CNV burden across the clinical diagnostic samples ( 14 case CNVs , 0 control CNVs ; p = 0 . 0006 ) . Additional follow - up analyses revealed a signiﬁcant GWAS signal from common SNPs at TCF4 in both autism and schizophrenia ( see analyses of polygenic risk from GWAS studies below and in Table S2 ) . Across all loci disrupted by BCAs , a dramatic increase in over - all CNV burden was observed in cases compared to controls ( CNV burden across 33 loci : p = 2 . 07 3 10 (cid:3) 47 , odds ratio [ OR ] = 5 . 12 , 95 % CI = 3 . 92 – 6 . 79 ) , and this result remained robust to subset analyses and 1 million random simulations to assess empirical signiﬁcance ( see Table S2 for CNV results and Extended Experimental Procedures for analysis details ) . Comparison of the NDD cases to the 14 , 017 diagnostic cases referred for a primary indication other than NDD and analyzed on identical platforms also showed an increased CNV burden across these genes ( p = 1 . 8 3 10 (cid:3) 5 ) , a result that again exceeded the signiﬁcance of 1 million random simulations despite the previously established enrichment of large CNVs in the latter cases , which we replicate here . Notably , restricting CNV anal - yses to only those genes disrupted by a BCA in an individual with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of ASD was also highly signiﬁcant ( p = 2 . 76 3 10 (cid:3) 28 ; Table 1 ) . Individually , increased CNV burden was nominally signiﬁcant for 14 of the genes in this study , with three nonsigniﬁcant trends ( p < 0 . 10 ) , whereas ﬁve additional genes were disrupted by CNVs in three or more independent cases but never altered in controls . For the latter , the rarity of dosage alteration in cases and absence of alterations in controls limit statistical power but are consistent with a strong deleterious effect . In each category discussed further below , the genes sup - ported by secondary CNVs are brieﬂy mentioned and presented in Table 1 , whereas the full list of genes disrupted by BCAs is Table 1 .

Category 1 : Balanced Alterations Conﬁrming Loci Previously Implicated in Neurodevelopment The power of sequencing BCAs as a discovery tool for loci contributing to disease etiology is illustrated in our independent identiﬁcation of several genes previously suggested as candi - dates in ASD or NDD . We found direct disruption of AUTS2 and CDKL5 , two established neurodevelopmental loci ( Bakkalo - glu et al . , 2008 ; Sultana et al . , 2002 ) . We also found disruption of the fork - head transcription factor FOXP1 and the glutamate receptor GRIN2B , genes identiﬁed from de novo mutations in ASD by an exome - sequencing study ( O’Roak et al . , 2011 ) . We also uncovered disruptions in TCF4 , a gene mutated in Pitt - Hop - kins syndrome as well as other genes implicated by CNV anal - ysis of an autism cohort ( the transcription factor SOX5 and the dystrophin regulator SNTG2 ) ( Rosenfeld et al . , 2010 ) . Consistent with their status as previously recognized contributors to neuro - development , the collective CNV burden of these genes is sig - niﬁcant ( p = 7 . 74 3 10 (cid:3) 20 ; OR = 3 . 6 ) ( Table 2 ) . Category 2 : Individual Genes Contributing to Microdeletion Syndromes Microdeletion syndromes , which contribute to neurodevelop - mental and psychiatric disorders , typically involve hemizygosity of large genomic regions where the difﬁculty of deﬁning speciﬁc genes responsible for core phenotypes has been an obstacle for clinical genetics , predictive diagnostics , and the study of disease pathogenesis . BCA sequencing in three ASD subjects pin - pointed three individual gene contributors to microdeletion syndromes , each of which is involved in transcriptional and / or epigenetic regulation , in the 2q23 . 1 , 2q33 . 1 , and 9q34 . 3 micro - deletion syndrome regions , respectively . In 2q23 . 1 , a transloca - tion disrupted MBD5 , a member of the methyl - CpG binding domain protein family deﬁned by a highly conserved methyl binding domain and including MeCP2 , a causal locus in Rett syndrome . An international consortium follow - up study recently found 65 structural variations spanning the 2q23 . 1 microdeletion region in cases with syndromic features , including ASD , seizures , and intellectual disability , establishing MBD5 as a necessary , sufﬁcient , and predictive locus for a majority of the phenotypic features of the 2q23 . 1 microdeletion syndrome ( Talk - owski et al . , 2011b ) . In the 2q33 . 1 and 9q34 . 3 regions , we respectively identiﬁed disruption of SATB2 , a gene involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling ( Rosenfeld et al . , 2009a ) , and of EHMT1 , encoding a histone methyltransfer - ase ( Kleefstra et al . , 2006 ) . In a fourth region ( 15q11 - 13 ) , the nested genes SNURF - SNRPN were disrupted at 15q11 . 2 in a subject with ASD and multiple developmental abnormalities , including sensory integration disorder , but without Angelman or Prader - Willi syndromes , both of which result from imprinting Figure 1 . Convergent Genomic Evidence Implicates TCF4 in Neurodevelopment ( A ) A t ( 3 ; 18 ) ( q13 . 32 ; q21 . 2 ) translocation was sequenced with our custom jumping library protocol in monozygotic twin boys with multiple developmental abnormalities , directly disrupting TCF4 in intron 8 , a gene previously associated with Pitt - Hopkins syndrome ( PHS ) by mutation analysis and with schizophrenia by GWAS . ( B ) Analysis of CNVs revealed disruption of coding and noncoding exons in 14 independent CNVs among 19 , 556 NDD cases compared to no CNVs observed in 13 , 991controls ( p = 0 . 0006 ) , implicatinghemizygosityof TCF4 asahighlypenetrantlocusinNDD , PHS , andASD ( seealsoTableS2andRosenfeldetal . , 2009b ) . ( C ) ReducedmRNA expressionof TCF4 wasdetected inboth cases from EBV - transformedlymphoblastoid celllines compared totwo gender - matched controls with two independent primers spanning exons 16 - 17 and exons 18 - 19 . For related supplemental data , see also Figures S1 and S2 , Tables S1 and S2 , and Data S1 : Phenotypic and Sequencing Information on Individual Patients . 528 Cell 149 , 525 – 537 , April 27 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . within the region . Our data argue for increased resolution and interpretation from molecular diagnostic testing of regional disorders , particularly for loci in which individual gene disrup - tions can yield phenotypes that are similar to or indistinguishable from that deﬁning the syndrome . Given their localization to syn - dromic regions , it is not surprising that CNV analysis of genes in this category reﬂected a strong impact in neurodevelopment ( p = 1 . 64 3 10 (cid:3) 26 ; OR = 10 . 2 ) ( Table 2 and Figure 3 ) . Category 3 : Novel Genes Conferring Risk to Autism and Neurodevelopment BCA sequencing yielded 22 novel ASD / NDD candidate genes that , like the genes in categories 1 and 2 , are also likely to contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotype in the corre - sponding subjects . The collective increase in CNV burden for these candidates was highly signiﬁcant ( p = 2 . 21 3 10 (cid:3) 15 , OR = 4 . 1 ) ( Table 2 ) . The most signiﬁcant individual genes are two loci localized to previously identiﬁed genomic disorder regions ( KIRREL3 and SMG6 ) and one encoding a DNA helicase ( CHD8 ) . Similar to the category 2 genes , we observed dysregulation by BCA and secondary CNV support for novel genes in regions associated with classic terminal deletion disorders : KIRREL3 in 11q24 . 1 ( Jacobsen syndrome ) and SMG6 in 17p13 . 3 ( Miller - Dieker syndrome ) . KIRREL3 encodes a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin family expressed in developing and adult brain of mouse and developing sensory pathways ( Morikawa et al . , 2007 ; Serizawa et al . , 2006 ; Tamura et al . , 2005 ) . The locus was disrupted by a BCA 39 . 6 kb upstream of the mRNA coding region that altered both mRNA and protein levels ( Table 1 and Figure S2 ) . Disruption of SMG6 nominates nonsense - mediated decay as another pathway in ASD and NDD , but not necessarily in the lissencephaly phenotype commonly seen in Miller - Dieker syndrome ( see Supplemental Information and Figure S3 ) . CHD8 encodes a DNA helicase that remodels chromatin struc - ture ( Thompson et al . , 2008 ) . Although it has never been individ - ually linked to a human disorder , it represents a strong autism and NDD candidate locus . It was disrupted by a BCA in a subject diagnosed with ASD ( Table 1 and Data S1 : Phenotypic and Sequencing Information on Individual Patients ) , was supported by our CNV analyses ( Table S2 , see also genes sensitive to dosage dysregulation section below ) , and was among the loci within the minimal region of overlap from previous analyses of de novo microdeletions ( Zahir et al . , 2007 ) . CHD8 is a transcrip - tional repressor that also interacts with genes implicated in NDD such as CHD7 , a causal locus in CHARGE syndrome . ( Batsukh et al . , 2010 ; Nishiyama et al . , 2009 ; Rodrı´guez - Paredes et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , in seven subjects no annotated gene was disrup - ted but several expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) , conserved sequences , and regions with predicted regulatory effects were impacted by breakpoints ( Table S1 ) , suggesting that BCAs may also provide a novel entre´e into such regions . In these subjects , we considered both loci in proximity to the breakpoint for positional effects ( e . g . , KIRREL3 ) , as well as disrupted but functionally unannotated sequences themselves , such as the highly conserved 6q16 . 3 sequence of unknown function disrup - ted by a BCA in an ASD subject ( denoted as ‘‘High Cons’’ in Table S1 ) and the noncoding RNA LOC401324 . Category 4 : Neurodevelopmental Loci Associated with Risk that Crosses Traditional Diagnostic Boundaries A remarkable number of genes implicated in ASD or NDD by single - gene disruption from BCAs in our study have also been recently associated with a spectrum of developmental , psychi - atric , and behavioral phenotypes by other strategies , such as GWAS and mutation screening , including TCF4 ( Pitt - Hopkins syndrome , intellectual disability , schizophrenia ) ( Amiel et al . , 2007 ; Blake et al . , 2010 ; Rosenfeld et al . , 2009b ) , GRIN2B ( schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and neurodevelopment ) ( En - dele et al . , 2010 ) , EHMT1 ( schizophrenia ) ( Kirov et al . , 2012 ) , and four novel neurodevelopmental genes that overlap with category 3 : ZNF804A ( schizophrenia , psychosis , and cognitive function ) ( O’Donovan et al . , 2008 ; Walters et al . , 2010 ) , ANK3 ( bipolar disorder and schizophrenia ) ( Ferreira et al . , 2008 ; Wil - liams et al . , 2011 ) , C18orf1 ( schizophrenia ) ( Meerabux et al . , 2009 ) , and PDE10A ( schizophrenia ) ( Kehler and Nielsen , 2011 ) . All loci with the exception of ANK3 are supported by secondary CNV analyses ( Table 1 ) . Of these category 4 candidates not previously associated with ASD or NDD , only PDE10A has an established function , encoding a phosphodiesterase suggested as a biological candidate in schizophrenia due to its high tissue - speciﬁc expression in the caudate nucleus . Speciﬁc PDE10A inhibitors provide a potential therapeutic approach to schizo - phrenia due to their regulation of cAMP and cGMP , thereby altering dopamine D1 and D2 receptor activity ( Kehler and Niel - sen , 2011 ; Lakics et al . , 2010 ) . Genes in this category appear to contribute to pleiotropic effects ranging from early - onset autism and intellectual disability to adult - onset psychosis , often through different mutational mechanisms . Several were previously associated with psychi - atric disorders by unbiased GWAS and / or by candidate gene studies of common variants , which are thought to reﬂect a more subtle effect on gene regulation than the outright inactiva - tion caused by the BCA disruption . One compelling example of different mutational mechanisms is TCF4 , where rare mutations are recognized as causing NDD , sometimes with a diagnosis of Pitt - Hopkins syndrome , but common TCF4 Table 2 .

Taken together , our ﬁndings support the long - hypothesized notion of a neurodevelopmental component to adult - onset neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia ( Murray and Lewis , 1987 ; Owen et al . , 2011 ; Weinberger , 1986 ) . However , our data extend this hypothesis to suggest that differing mutational impact on the same sets of genes constitutes a signiﬁcant overlap in the genetic etiology of autism , schizophrenia , psychosis , bipolar disorder , and intellectual disability , comprising at least a subset of the total genetic vari - ance for each of these disorders . The collective CNV burden for these genes decisively supports the fundamental hypothesis that some psychiatric disease - associated genes are important in neurodevelopment ( p = 5 . 1 3 10 (cid:3) 15 ; OR = 6 . 7 ) ( Table 2 ) . Polygenic Risk from Genome - wide Association Studies Our identiﬁcation of genes disrupted by BCA in ASD or NDD with an increased CNV burden among diagnostic cases with neuro - developmental abnormalities suggests that these are relatively penetrant alterations in human development , consistent with polygenic risk factors of modest to large effect . However , the discovery of the genes in category 4 suggests that for some loci , an accumulation of subtle genetic effects associated with common polymorphisms could have a pleiotropic impact across a spectrum of early childhood and adult - onset psychiatric disor - ders . To test this hypothesis , we performed gene - set enrichment analyses in data sets from GWASs of autism and schizophrenia ( Ripke et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ; Weiss et al . , 2009 ) by using an established method in which each linkage disequilibrium block across the genome is scored with the maximum Z score achieved in the block ( Rossin et al . , 2011 ) . Analysis of an initial autism study revealed a highly signiﬁcant enrichment of risk alleles across the gene set ( empirical p = 0 . 0018 ) , a result that persisted in the second GWAS of autism ( p = 0 . 068 ) . Moreover , we discovered a signiﬁcant enrichment of associated alleles from the largest GWAS meta - analysis of schizophrenia to date ( empirical p = 0 . 0009 ) . Struck by these results , we evaluated the potential for any unforeseen confounding variables by per - forming identical enrichment analyses in phenotype - permuted data sets from the meta - analysis of schizophrenia and autism studies ( p = 0 . 444 and p = 0 . 518 , respectively ) , in a well - powered GWAS study of Crohn’s disease ( p = 0 . 819 ) ( Franke et al . , 2010 ) , and from GWAS data for seven other unrelated traits ( p values ranged from p = 0 . 06 to p = 0 . 917 , ﬁtting nicely to the expected null distribution ) . These data indicate an unusually strong enrichment of subtle effects from common polygenic risk loci in autism and schizophrenia among the genes identiﬁed by our BCA sequencing and further support the hypothesis that diverse mutational mechanisms at these loci can confer pleio - tropic effects across conventional diagnostic classiﬁcations ( Figure 2 ) . Genes Sensitive to Dosage Dysregulation The ﬁnding that some genes associated with ASD or NDD due to inactivation of one allele may also contribute to abnormal phenotypes when more subtly disrupted suggests that some ASD or NDD genes require tight control of their expression for appropriate neurodevelopmental function . In such circum - stances , disruption by increased dosage might also produce an NDD phenotype . This is highlighted in more detailed examina - tion of the CNV analyses presented in Figures 1 , 3 , and 4 , which indicate that for some genes , the CNV data predict that both deletion and duplication are risk factors for abnormal neurode - velopment , whereas for other loci the mechanism of disruption appears to be dosage speciﬁc . For example , previously estab - lished NDD risk loci ( TCF4 , Figure 1 ; SATB2 and MBD5 , Figure 3 ) almost exclusively display deletion among the CNV cases , clearly supporting a similar mechanism of dysregulation to that seen for the BCA disruption . This is also true for NDD candidates such as PDE10A and KIRREL3 . However , there are a number of genes similar to the three instances shown here for which CNV analysis supported genetic risk from both deletion and duplication , approaching a near 50 : 50 balance , including two well - established loci ( AUTS2 and CDKL5 ) ( Figure 4A and Table S3 ) . Interestingly , CNV analysis also supported genetic risk pre - dominantly resulting from duplication of a locus ( e . g . , CHD8 , GRIN2B , and FOXP1 , Figure 4B ) , suggesting similar phenotypic outcomes from both dosage increase and heterozygous inacti - vation by BCA disruption , as in this study , or de novo mutations in a previous study ( for GRIN2B and FOXP1 ) ( O’Roak et al . , 2011 ) . These data build upon previous ﬁndings in recurrent rearrangement regions , such as the common recurrent 16p11 . 2 microdeletion / microduplication ( Weiss et al . , 2008 ) , where both deletion and duplication increase risk for autism to different degrees and have disparate impacts ( including recip - rocal phenotypes ) for other disorders and physiological traits . Figure 2 . Genes Disrupted by Chromosomal Abnormalities Confer Risk across Diagnostic Groups All genes disrupted by a BCA and analyzed in the CNV analyses are shown . Although all genes are implicated in ASD or NDD by BCA disruption in this study , some loci also represented single - gene contributors to previously recognized genomic disorder ( GD ) regions ( three microdeletion syndromes , two terminal deletion syndromes , and one duplication syndrome ) . There were also genes discovered in ASD or NDD in this study that had been previously linked to adolescent - or adult - onset neuropsychiatric disorders ( NPD ) by common variation association studies . The asterisk ( * ) denotes a gene not previously implicated in ASD or NDD ( category 3 ) .

Disrupted Genes Do Not Converge on a Single Pathway in Neurodevelopment The genomics approach in this study enabled direct interpretation of locus speciﬁcity for further downstream analyses . We evaluated the networks in which these genes may partici - pate and whether any biological pathways emerged as signiﬁcantly enriched for genes disrupted by these BCAs . A qualitative network analysis based on interactions from PubMed abstracts and the use of a natural language processing algorithm identiﬁed a network of 429 interacting genes ( Figure 5 and Figure S4 ) . Fourteen of the original genes , many of which are involved in transcriptional regulation , were found to interact indirectly in a large , intercon - nected network , and TCF4 , SNRPN , CHD8 , and GTF2F1 were conﬁrmed as interacting partners of the RNA Polymerase II complex . Analysis of gene ontology ( GO ) terms found enrichment of transcription factors , phospho - proteins , and protein heterodimerization activity ( p < 0 . 005 ) . A quantitative network assessment did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant ﬁrst - or second - order interac - tions compared to chance expectations ( given the size and composition of the given networks ) . The nominally signiﬁcant Cell 149 , 525 – 537 , April 27 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 531 networks ( statistical enrichment of pathways at p < 0 . 05 ) included shared interactions between SNTG2 , UTRN , GNA14 , and CDKRAP2 ( p = 0 . 01 ) as well as KCND2 and GRIN2B ( p = 0 . 03 ) ( Figure S4 ) . The SNURF - SNRPN complex was nominally signiﬁcant in both analyses and in an assessment of physical interactions ( Supplemental Information ) . No results were sig - niﬁcant after correction for multiple testing . There was also no convergence on one or a few pathways involved in Figure 4 . Genes Sensitive to Dosage Dysregulation Provided is an example of genes illustrated by this study that appear to be sensitive to a spectrum of mutational mechanisms reciprocally altering their gene dosage . In Figures 1 and 2 are examples of genes such as TCF4 and SATB2 that are disrupted exclusively by deletions . ( A ) Genes sensitive to dosage dysregulation from which both deletion and duplication appear to confer risk for similar phenotypes ( AUTS2 , CDKL5 , C18orf1 ) .

Two of thesegenes , FOXP1 and GRIN2B arealso supportedby denovomutation inASDfamilies ( O’Roak et al . , 2011 ) . CHD8 is a completely novel candidate not previously implicated in ASD or any human abnormality . These data suggest annotation of the human genome is insufﬁcient to reliably predict the impact of various mutational mechanisms of speciﬁc loci involved in neurodevelopment .

These results could also signify that interaction of a diverse range of functional networks at many levels is critical to normal human neurodevelopment and that there is ample opportunity for genetic lesions to disrupt different functional pathways while still leading to similar neurodevelopmental outcomes . DISCUSSION Direct sequencing of BCA breakpoints , followed by targeted assessmentofmoleculardiagnosticCNVﬁndingsinindependent subjects , proved to be an efﬁcient strategy for individual gene discovery in abnormal neurodevelopment . As this approach begins with sequence resolution of individual BCAs , it is not subject to notable limitations of other de novo mutation studies that rely purely on CNVs or on exome sequencing ( i . e . , primarily identiﬁcation of large multigene regions in the former and failure to assess most noncoding sequence in the latter ) and therefore providesaneffectivecomplementtotheseapproaches . Theyield of this study is considerable ; 22 novel loci are disrupted by BCAs and 14 loci are supported from secondary analyses either by a statistical enrichment of CNV burden or disruption in multiple cases and absence of dosage alterations in controls , with several additional genes and sequences whose potential for contribution merits further examination . These ﬁndings not only extend speciﬁc knowledge of neurodevelopmental genes implicated by microdeletion syndromes , GWA , CNV , and exome sequencing studies but also reveal entirely unsuspected genes in ASD and NDD . This work also presents direct evidence for a complex genetic architecture that connects neurodevelop - mental and adult - onset psychiatric disorders by implicating robustly associated schizophrenia loci as contributors to neuro - developmental abnormalities . Our analyses were based upon the premise that alone , a de novo BCA disruption in a single case , CNVs spanning a given locus , or the presence of a de novo mutation within the coding region of an interesting biological candidate does not by itself represent compelling evidence that a gene contributes to neuro - development . Instead , we sought convergent genomic evidence combining disruption by a de novo BCA ( or in two subjects a BCA that cosegregated with the phenotype ) with association by CNV or mutation in independent and similarly affected cases , followed by comparison with risk loci from GWAS studies . The strength of evidence varied between loci , as shown in Table 1 and Table S2 . In some instances , genes were statistically sup - ported by secondary CNV analyses , in others , the statistical support was inconclusive , and in several the CNV data do not nominate the locus as an NDD candidate ( e . g . , ZBTB20 ; see Figure 5 . Network Analysis of Genes Implicated in Autism or Neurodevelopment in This Study A large network of genes disrupted by BCAs in this study are connected by ﬁrst - , second - , or higher - order interactions . No networks were signiﬁcantly enriched forgenesdisruptedbyBCAsaftercorrectionformultiplecomparisons , thoughanumberoflocihavelimitedfunctionalannotationavailableorremainofunknown function . See also Figure S4 . Cell 149 , 525 – 537 , April 27 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 533 Table 1 , Table S2 , and Table S3 ) . Additionally , like any genetic study , we cannot discount a potential contribution from altered expression of other genes at a distance from the site of the disruption . Although such an effect could result from the trans - position of functional elements , the comprehensive testing of this possibility is problematic because it could involve dysregu - lation that is tissue - speciﬁc , that occurs due to the potentially altered nuclear organization of the rearranged chromosomes , or that is a secondary physiological consequence of the primary gene disruption . Nonetheless , secondary CNV analyses from independent NDD cases indicate a profound collective contribu - tion of the disrupted genes on neurodevelopment . Simulations and subset analyses to evaluate empirical signiﬁcance estab - lished that the increased CNV burden of the loci disrupted by BCAs was robust ; unusually speciﬁc to neurodevelopmental disorders compared to other phenotypic presentations referred for molecular diagnostic testing ; and not driven by any single gene , individual disruption category , cluster of symptoms , or discrete diagnostic category . Rather , it was an accumulation of risk factors from all four categories that collectively contributed to the signiﬁcant burden observed ( see Supplemental Informa - tion ) . For some genes , developmental abnormalities were pre - dominantly associated with dosage alteration in only one direction , whereas for others the increased CNV burden involved both deletions and duplications . These data illustrate the imma - ture state of annotation of the human genome with respect to dosage sensitivity and to prediction of phenotypic outcomes from genetic lesions , a limitation that may be alleviated at least in part by the growing capacity to sequence BCAs in a relatively high - throughput manner . A surprising number of genes previously associated with adolescent - or adult - onset psychiatric disorders were disrupted in children with autism and NDD in this study . The concept of schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder has long been proposed ( Murray and Lewis , 1987 ; Weinberger , 1986 ) , and a growing consensus in the recent literature suggests that there are shared risk factors across what are viewed clinically as distinct phenotypic classiﬁcations , although few of these have been described at the individual gene level ( Owen et al . , 2011 ) . Our study supports a shared genetic etiology for at least a portion of the phenotypic spectrum of schizophrenia , autism , and the neurodevelopmental abnormalities studied here . We ﬁnd unambiguous gene disruption by BCAs in ASD and NDD subjects , coupled with an increased CNV burden and a substan - tial overrepresentation of polygenic risk compared to null expectations from GWAS of schizophrenia . Individual genes may thus show a differential risk depending on the nature of the genetic lesion , with heterozygous inactivation from BCA , CNV , or deactivating point mutation being a relatively penetrant contributor to ASD or NDD , whereas subtle effects from common variants contribute to later - onset disorders . However , contrary to this simple hypothesis , we were surprised to ﬁnd persistent enrichment of these genes also among common variant associations from autism GWAS studies , suggesting that even subtle perturbation of genes important in normal human development can contribute to abnormal outcomes across the lifespan , presumably in interaction with other genetic and environmental inﬂuences . This initial sequence - based delineation of a large collection of subjects harboring chromosomal aberrations in autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders establishes an approach that can be exploited for efﬁcient discovery of individual genetic factors contributing to otherwise complex disorders . Each individual gene identiﬁed provides a new , speciﬁc hypothesis concerning the disease to be tested with further genetic and biological study . If supported , each then represents a foundation for investigations into the role that the biochemical activity and regulation of its product play in pathogenesis and into the poten - tial for treatment through their manipulation . Ultimately , such data will also provide invaluable annotation of the human genome and profoundly impact the clinical interpretation of genomic events in subjects referred to diagnostic laboratories for autism and other developmental abnormalities . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Patients Subjects were obtained from the Developmental Genome Anatomy Project ( DGAP ) ( Higgins et al . , 2008 ) , the Autism Consortium of Boston , the Center for Human Genetic Research ( CHGR ) Neurodevelopmental Repository , and the Autism Genome Resource Exchange ( AGRE ) . These studies were approved by the institutional review board of Partners HealthCare System . Clinical information was obtained by direct questionnaires , medical records , or structured clinical interviews ( see Data S1 : Phenotypic and Sequencing Information on Individual Patients ) . Sequencing Sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform ( Illumina ) . Libraries were created by four different methods optimized for delineating BCAs , including ( 1 ) Illumina standard insert paired - end sequencing , ( 2 ) Illumina mate - pair sequencing ( long 2 , 000 – 4 , 000 bp inserts ) , ( 3 ) our customized jumping libraries ( long 3 , 000 – 4 , 500 bp inserts ) , and ( 4 ) our capture of breakpoints method ( CapBP ) for rearrangements previously localized ( see Supplemental Informa - tion with complete protocols in Talkowski et al . [ 2011a ] ) . Interestingly , some rearrangements proved to be far more complex than suspected by karyotyp - ing , and in at least two subjects this complexity represented balanced germline chromothripsis similar to but distinct from previously described events in cancer cells ( DGAP127 and DGAP203 ; see Table S4 and ( Chiang et al . , 2012 ) ) . In complex rearrangements where more than two genes were disrupted by BCA breakpoints , we conservatively excluded these cases from interpretation in our secondary CNV / GWAS analyses . Bioinformatics Sequencing reads were aligned via publicly available alignment programs and custom scripts , followed by processing of BAM ﬁles with a C + + program , Bamstat , to tabulate mapping statistics and output lists of anomalous read - pairs ( deﬁned as having ends that map to two different chromosomes , having an abnormal insert size , and / or unexpected strand orientations ) ( Talkowski et al . , 2011a ) . Anomalous pairs were clustered by their mapped mates withaprogramthatperforms asingle - linkage clustering ofpaired reads if corresponding ends map within a speciﬁed distance . All junction fragments predicted from paired - end sequencing were PCR ampliﬁed from genomic DNA , independent of the libraries and sequencing reads , and all breakpoints presented in this study were conﬁrmed by capillary sequencing ( Table S1 and also Table S5 ) . Evaluation of CNVs in Independent Subjects Complete details on the CNV data , statistical analyses , and simulations to determine empirical signiﬁcance are fully described in Supplemental Informa - tion . We compiled CNV data from 33 , 573 cases from molecular diagnostic laboratories of Signature Genomic Laboratories ( SG ) and Children’s Hospital Boston ( CHB ) analyzed by oligonucleotide aCGH . A subset of the SG data 534 Cell 149 , 525 – 537 , April 27 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . was included in a recent CNV study ( Cooper et al . , 2011 ) . We fully annotated both data sets and collapsed all subjects with an indication for study ( but without additional clinical information to verify a speciﬁc diagnosis ) of autism , ASD , or a related neurodevelopmental abnormality into a combined NDD cohort ( 19 , 556 cases ) and those for which the clinical indication did not indicate an NDD ( 14 , 017 cases ) . Control data were obtained across multiple published resources as described in the Supplemental Information ( n = 13 , 991 independent controls ) . Only 6 , 239 controls were analyzed for CNVs on the X chromosome , and this reduced comparison group was used for analyses of CDKL5 . The resolution between the clinical aCGH and higher - resolution control SNP microarrays varied extensively . To overcome this disparity but retain the native resolution of each individual array platform , we analyzed all CNVs that disrupted any documented coding or noncoding exon from all transcripts available from multiple database sources ( Table S1 ) . Notably , post hoc analyses reveal that a size ﬁlter of 100 kb , or the reso - lution of the most sparse control arrays , would have resulted in an almost identical CNV burden test to our exon disruption model ( p = 1 . 18 3 10 (cid:3) 47 ) , but would have omitted high - conﬁdence CNV calls in controls that could point toward reduced penetrance or nonsigniﬁcant loci in this study such as ZBTB20 . Empirical signiﬁcance was established by simulations performed in MATLAB ( Mathworks ) with custom scripts with all methods and ﬁndings described in the Supplemental Information . In brief , 1 million gene sets of 33 loci were randomly selected from the genome , and case - control CNV burden tests were performed for each random gene set . These same analyses were performed for NDD cases compared to all other cases in the molecular diag - nostic cohort . Neither simulation detected a random gene set exceeding the signiﬁcance of the experimental gene set . Another set of experiments per - formed subset analyses , randomly selecting up to 1 , 000 gene sets of each possible number of k genes from the experimental gene set of 33 loci , ranging from k = 5 tok = 33 , ﬁnding a minimum of 90 . 5 % of all subsets at alevel as low ask = 5exceededmultiple testingcorrectionand100 % ofthe1 , 000gene sets to be signiﬁcant at k > 13 ( see Supplemental Information ) . Genome - wide Association Studies We performed gene - set enrichment analysis from GWAS data by using pub - lishedmethods ( Rossinetal . , 2011 ) onarecentmeta - analysisofschizophrenia ( Ripke et al . , 2011 ) and two GWASs of autism ( Weiss et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Brieﬂy , linkage disequilibrium blocks across the genome are scored with the maximum Z score achieved in the block . That score is corrected for the number of tests across the block via linear regression and the residuals are then used as the new , corrected score for each block . Genes nominate scores based upon the unique set of blocks they overlap , and the nominated scores are compared to background scores from all genes in the genome via a one - tailed rank - sum test . Network Analysis A qualitative assessment of interacting genes and complexes for each of the genes in which functional information was available ( little data existed for some of the novel genes ) was initially performed with Natural Language Pro - cessing ( NLP ) from published abstracts ( see Supplemental Information ) . Secondary analyses of GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia Of Genes And Genomes ( KEGG ) enrichments were then performed followed by quantitative network building of ﬁrst - and second - order interactions of the set of proteins coded by the genes disrupted by BCAs . The signiﬁcance of these networks was determined by permutation testing ( Supplemental Information ) .
