R E V I E W FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS Lessons from yeast for clathrin - mediated endocytosis Douglas R . Boettner , Richard J . Chi and Sandra K . Lemmon Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the major pathway for internalization of membrane proteins from the cell surface . Half a century of studies have uncovered tremendous insights into how a clathrin - coated vesicle is formed . More recently , the advent of live - cell imaging has provided a dynamic view of this process . As CME is highly conserved from yeast to humans , budding yeast provides an evolutionary template for this process and has been a valuable system for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms . In this review we trace the formation of a clathrin - coated vesicle from initiation to uncoating , focusing on key findings from the yeast system . Since electron micrographs first identified compelling dense regions of the curved plasma membrane , there has been continued interest in endocytosis 1 . Following their initial visualization , careful purification led to the identification of clathrin as the source of the polygonal lattices surrounding these endocytic pits 2 , 3 . The biochemical characterization of neurons , enriched with these pits , resulted in the purification of key constituents ; we have since gained extensive knowledge of the factors involved in CME . Additionally , several in vitro systems helped to determine the biochemical properties of clathrin , including its self - assembly association with adaptors 4 . However , at that time , biological study of mammalian systems was hamstrung by a lack of tools for examining endocytosis dynamically in live cells . To escape those pitfalls and difficulties , studies of endocytosis turned towards the yeast model , Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Yeast provided a facile genetic system , which , when combined with technological advances , greatly accelerated discovery of endocytic mechanisms . Yeast screens for end 5 and dim mutants 6 began illuminating the factors involved , and were the first to identify a role for actin in endocytosis 7 , 8 . Breakthroughs in live - cell fluorescence microscopy permitted real - time visualization of cellular function — a powerful tool when combined with the capabilities to delete or manipulate genes in yeast . This allowed wholesale testing of endocytic factor recruitment in live yeast , yielding a more detailed understanding of the cellular roles of these components 9 – 12 . Recently , quantitative immunoelectron microscopy has provided more detailed spatial resolution and fresh insight into the organization of the endocytic machinery 13 . Buoyed by additional findings in mammalian systems and new in vitro assays to investigate aspects such as actin assembly and membrane tubulation , our understanding of CME has changed dramatically from a static picture of clathrin - coated pits to a well - orchestrated chain of events . In yeast , a multitude of modular proteins ( Fig . 1 ) , with conserved homologues in metazoans , have been categorized into distinct temporal phases on the basis of their recruitment and function at the endocytic site ( Fig . 2 ) . During the immobile phase , endocytic coat factors appear in cortical patches at the plasma membrane and cargo collection begins . Additional endocytic factors are then recruited and positioned for the activation of actin assembly . In the slow mobile phase , actin assembly drives invagination while membrane - binding proteins sculpt and hold the membrane to prepare the site for vesicle scission . After vesicle release there is a fast mobile phase characterized by immediate disassembly of the endocytic coat , and the nascent vesicle , driven by actin assembly , moves deep into the cell . This review presents an overview of the endocytic process in yeast , focusing on more recent discoveries and highlighting major similarities and differences between endocytosis in yeast and human . Establishment of clathrin - coated pits Understanding the precise events necessary to select a membrane site for initiation of a clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) has remained beyond our range of detection . As many endocytic factors bind to phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , lipid phosphorylation by inositol kinases plays a role in the formation and size of CCPs 14 , 15 . In yeast , the earliest proteins seen at the incipient CCP are clathrin , the Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain protein Ede1 , and Syp1 , the F - BAR / μ2 homology counterpart to FCHo1 / 2 ( refs 10 , 11 , 16 - 19 ) . After 1 – 2 min , these factors are joined by the Hip1 / R homologue , Sla2 ( refs 9 , 20 ) . Rapidly after Sla2 , the final major constituents of the endocytic coat are recruited : Sla1 , a Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain protein , as well as End3 and Pan1 , two EH domain factors 9 , 10 . The clathrin adaptors Yap1801 / 2 ( AP180 / CALM ) and Ent1 / 2 ( epsins ) arrive around the time as these middle – late coat factors ( R . J . C . unpublished observation ; ref . 21 ) . The roles of the three endocytic factors arriving earliest are still being dissected . Clathrin heavy chain or light chain mutants ( chc1Δ or clc1 Δ , respectively ) exhibit reduced ability to uptake α - factor by Ste2 , the mating pheromone receptor 22 , 23 . Live - cell imaging has shown that clathrin mutants exhibit delays in cortical patch maturation , as measured by increases in the Douglas R . Boettner , Richard J . Chi and Sandra K .

Deletion of Ede1 also results in endocytic phenotypes similar to clathrin - null mutants 10 , 25 . However , the early arriving Syp1 is dispensable for endocytic patch formation in yeast 10 , 16 – 18 . In contrast , in mammalian cells , the Syp1 - like FCHo1 / 2 , Eps15 and their interacting partner intersectin are reported to be essential for endocytic site initiation 26 . How clathrin is recruited to the cortex is still unclear . The heavy chain terminal domain forms a β - propeller that provides a platform for association with adaptors to mediate clathrin recruitment . A major site on the terminal domain interacts with adaptors containing short linear peptides with the consensus sequence Lϕpϕp , also referred to as ‘clathrin box motifs’ , where ϕ is hydrophobic and p represents a polar residue 27 . Initial yeast studies indicated that clathrin assembly at cortical patches is dependent on the adaptors Ent1 / 2 and Yap1801 / 2 ( ref . 11 ) , which contain carboxy - terminal clathrin box motifs . However , AP180 proteins and epsins arrive at the cortex after clathrin ( R . J .

Also , mutation of the clathrin Lϕpϕp - binding site in the yeast heavy chain terminal domain does not prevent cortical association of clathrin 28 , and endocytosis is almost normal in this terminal domain mutant 28 . Another clathrin box motif binding site on the terminal domain was predicted in this study , which could explain the limited phenotypic consequences of the terminal domain mutation . Consistent with this hypothesis , studies in mammals have now identified as many as four distinct binding sites involved in clathrin – adaptor interaction in the clathrin terminal domain , and ablation of all four sites is required to significantly affect CME 29 , 30 . Identification of specific cargo - sorting adaptors in yeast is continuing . The only known cargo for AP - 2 is the K28 killer toxin , but its receptor remains unknown 31 . AP - 2 is not essential in yeast , and so does not play a central role in CME like its animal counterpart 32 , 33 . Yap1801 / 2 are cargo - selective adaptors for recycling the v - SNARE ( vesicle SNAP receptor ) protein Snc1 ( ref . 34 ) . Deletion of both AP180 homologues causes no general endocytic phenotype 32 , but these factors are partially redundant with yeast epsins 35 . Syp1 is also likely to be a cargo adaptor , as overexpression improves internalization of the cell - wall stress sensor , Mid2 , and this is dependent on its C - terminal AP - 2 μ2 homology region 17 . Sla1 interacts directly with NPFxD sorting motifs ( for example , in Ste2 and Wsc1 ) through its Sla1p homology domain 1 ( SHD1 ) region 36 , 37 . Sla1 also binds to clathrin through a variant clathrin box motif ( LLDLQ ) , an interaction that is subject to autoregulation mediated through Sla1’s SHD2 region 38 . However , in common with the epsins and AP180 adaptors , Sla1 appears with later coat factors 9 , after clathrin recruitment . Thus , clathrin at the patch seems to serve as a ‘basket’ to capture adaptors and their cargo for internalization , and adaptor association with clathrin in turn stabilizes the endocytic site . Consistent with this observation , fluorescent α - factor ( bound by its receptor Ste2 ) is collected into pre - existing early endocytic patches 19 . It remains unknown what adaptors collect ubiquitinated endocytic cargo , such as Ste2 and many downregulated permeases . The epsins ( through ubiquitin - interacting motifs ( UIM ) ) and Ede1 ( through its ubiquitin association domain ( UBA ) ) were thought to be redundant adaptors for ubiquitinated cargo . This idea arose from research demonstrating that removal of the epsin UIMs had little effect on internalization of Ste2 , but in combination with ede1Δ the defect became severe 39 . However , recent studies showed that internalization of both ubiquitinated cargo and cargo dependent on short peptide sorting motifs ( for example , NPFxD ) were equally defective in these cells , so these effects were not specific to ubiquitin - modified cargos 40 . Furthermore , ubiquitinated receptors were internalized efficiently , even when the epsin UIMs and the UBA region of Ede1 were deleted . The epsin UIMs and Ede1 UBAs may still have cargo - binding functions , but these must be redundant with other ubiquitin - binding endocytic factors such as SH3 - domain proteins like Sla1 , whose third SH3 domain binds ubiquitin 41 . Controlling actin assembly Yeast endocytosis requires the assembly of a dense branched actin network to promote plasma membrane invagination 42 . This involves multiple layers of regulation that create a small timeframe of actin assembly . Branched actin filaments are formed through the Arp2 / 3 complex , which appears only during the actin phase of endocytosis 9 , 43 . Arp2 / 3 - complex activity relies on activation by nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) . There are five known endocytic NPFs ( Pan1 , Las17 , Myo3 , Myo5 and Abp1 ) that increase Arp2 / 3 - complex potency by delivering actin monomers to the actin assembly site 43 .

Las17 is also recruited around this time .

All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W additional endocytic factors , including Syp1 , Sla2 , Sla1 , Vrp1 , Bzz1 and Bbc1 , control the ability of NPFs to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 ) . The earliest - arriving NPFs are Pan1 and the WASp homologue Las17 , which together are proposed to function in priming actin assembly at the cortical patch . Although ablation of the NPF activity of Pan1 ( pan1 - ΔWA ) or Las17 ( las17 - ΔWCA ) alone causes little change in phenotype , combining the two mutations leads to marked endocytic progression defects 44 . Both Pan1 and Las17 arrive 20 – 25 s before detectable amounts of actin at the cortical patch , so both NPFs must be initially maintained in an inhibited state 9 , 45 . Evidence indicates that Sla2 negatively regulates Pan1 - NPF activity 46 . However , both Sla2 and Pan1 are found together in the coat , and how their interaction is regulated is not known . Syp1 and Sla1 are known negative regulators of Las17 and probably help prevent premature actin assembly before full endocytic coat maturation . Syp1 binds Las17 through its unstructured central domain to attenuate Las17 stimulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex 16 . One hypothesis is that this inhibition is lifted as the Syp1 F - BAR domain senses changes in membrane curvature , resulting in the departure of Syp1 from the patch just before the major burst of actin assembly 16 . The first two SH3 domains of Sla1 negatively regulate Las17 NPF activity 47 . Unlike Syp1 , Sla1 does not leave the endocytic site ; instead , it remains in close proximity to Las17 until actin assembly deepens the invagination 13 . Subsequently , Sla1 follows the clathrin coat to the tip of the invagination , whereas Las17 remains near the neck where constriction takes place 13 . This spatial separation may facilitate release of Sla1’s hold on Las17 . Just before the rapid actin assembly phase , another F - BAR domain protein Bzz1 ( related to syndapin ) is recruited to the CCP along with the WIP ( WASp - interacting protein ) homologue Vrp1 44 . Bzz1 SH3 domains may interact with Las17 , which could lift the negative regulation of Sla1 through competitive binding 44 , 48 . Another possibility is that the proline residues within Vrp1 act as a sink for the Sla1 SH3 domains to recruit it from Las17 and lift Sla1 - mediated inhibition . The type - 1 myosins ( Myo3 / Myo5 ) are seen at cortical patches only during the actin assembly phase 43 , 44 . Before that , they are bound by cytosolic calmodulin in a conformational state that prevents their assembly and activity 49 . Vrp1 is crucial for cortical recruitment and activation of Myo3 / Myo5 , which together with Las17 are the most potent Arp2 / 3 complex activators during internalization 43 , 44 , 50 . Although defects in Pan1 and Las17 NPF activities cause elongated endocytic lifetimes , internalization is ultimately completed . In contrast , vrp1Δ or myo3Δ myo5Δ yeast are defective for inwards movement , indicating that myosin activity drives invagination 44 . Immuno - electron microscopy has shown that as the membrane is deformed there is a spatial split between the major NPFs 13 . The type - 1 myosins stay at the cortex , whereas Las17 moves inwards to the middle of the elongating endocytic tubule , and Pan1 is found at the tip of the invagination . During the actin phase another NPF inhibitor appears , the SH3 domain protein Bbc1 , which inhibits both Las17 and type - 1 myosin in vitro 44 , 47 . However , Bbc1 localizes near the neck of the invagination , suggesting that it mainly restrains Las17 activity 13 . Overall , the locations of the Arp2 / 3 complex activators and negative regulators are also critical for productive invagination and scission . The final NPF , Abp1 , is a weak activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex ; curiously , however , it also inhibits the NPF activities of Las17 and the myosins in vitro 44 . Furthermore , abp1Δ does not cause major endocytic defects . Instead , Abp1 seems to be more important for recruitment of coat disassembly factors following vesicle scission 10 . In mammalian cells , the Arp2 / 3 complex , WASp and other actin regulators ( for example , WIP , syndapin and cortactin ) have been visualized at the endocytic site 51 – 53 . N - WASp is auto - inhibited , but binding to the SH3 domain of syndapin relieves this inhibition and promotes actin assembly for endocytosis 54 – 56 . Another BAR - domain protein , PICK1 , is a negative regulator of Arp2 / 3 activity . Loss of PICK1 leads to actin aggregation and reduction in AMPA receptor internalization 57 . However , relatively few studies dissecting the roles of Arp2 / 3 complex regulators in endocytosis have been reported in animal cells . This may be due to general morphological changes that result from perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton .

The colour of the negative regulators changes from red to pink and then to white to indicate that their inhibitory activity is partial or relieved . F - actin is shown as a grey cloud surrounding the endocytic site . Initially , actin assembly is blocked by Syp1 , Sla1 and Sla2 , which prevents early activation of Las17 and Pan1 ( left ) . Myosin 1 is inhibited by calmodulin in the cytosol . Next , the activator Bzz1 arrives , and Vrp1 is recruited by Las17 ( middle ) . This may allow early F - actin seeding and the beginning of membrane invagination , as inhibitors start to lose their influence ( pink ) . Release of Syp1 from the cortex and recruitment of myosins ( by Vrp1 ) and Arp2 / 3 complex lead to robust actin assembly and invagination ( right ) . Another negative regulator , Bbc1 , arrives in the late phase , preventing excessive endocytic actin accumulation . It is not known when the Pan1 inhibitory function of Sla2 is relieved , as they move together into the coat . Sla2 is shown here losing its influence as the endocytic site invaginates .

All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W Translating actin assembly into membrane invagination As substantial amounts of actin are assembled by the Arp2 / 3 complex in yeast , the membrane deforms and creates an extended tubule with a clathrin - coated tip 13 . New discoveries have begun to explain how actin assembly is leveraged into membrane curvature . The talin - like proteins , including Sla2 in yeast and Hip1 / Hip1R in mammals , are crucial for translating actin assembly into membrane tension through binding to the endocytic coat , the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane 58 – 61 . This family of proteins is composed of an AP180 N - terminal homology domain ( ANTH ) , a central coiled - coil region and a talin Hip1 / R / Sla2 actin - tethering C - terminal homology domain ( THATCH ) . Sla2 is initially recruited to a forming cortical patch through ANTH binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( refs 62 , 63 ) . The Sla2 coiled - coil region mediates dimerization and direct interaction of Sla2 with the clathrin light chain , Sla1 and Pan1 ( refs 20 , 46 , 64 ) , whereas the C - terminal THATCH domain mediates interaction with F - actin 65 – 67 . In sla2 Δ yeast , early endocytic factors ( including clathrin ) are recruited , but these patches do not invaginate . Instead , waving F - actin assemblies emanate from the cortex , consistent with a membrane - actin anchoring role for Sla2 ( refs 9 , 11 ) . Similar F - actin structures are observed in mammalian cells depleted of Hip1R ( ref . 61 ) . Binding of Hip1R to the N - terminus of clathrin light chain induces a conformational change in Hip1R to a closed state 67 , 68 , which decreases its affinity for F - actin 67 . This conformational change is consistent with yeast studies showing self - interaction between the Sla2 THATCH and coiled - coil regions 60 . Yeast light chain also regulates Sla2 , as overexpression of the Sla2 - binding region of the light chain can suppress endocytic defects in chc1Δ yeast 24 . Newer yeast studies support the conformational regulation model . A mutant light chain lacking its Sla2 - interacting residues can suppress endocytic defects caused by impaired Arp2 / 3 - complex activation ( las17Δ , vrp1Δ , or myo3Δ myo5Δ ) 69 . Furthermore , this suppression depends on the Sla2 actin - binding region 69 . Therefore , preventing clathrin - light - chain - mediated release of Sla2 – actin attachments can bypass reduced actin assembly by increasing and prolonging anchorage to the membrane . The confluence of Hip1R and Sla2 studies has led to a new model for the translation of actin assembly into membrane invagination ( Fig . 4 ) 67 , 69 . As actin is assembled at the endocytic patch , it is bound by Sla2 at the periphery of the clathrin - coated pit . As the pit matures , clathrin light chain binds Sla2 and causes it to undergo a conformational change that releases actin . In this manner , membrane invagination continues unidirectionally and is timed with clathrin coat formation . It is noteworthy that the THATCH domain of Sla2 is not required for general endocytosis 59 , 60 , 70 ; thus , other unidentified membrane – actin tethering factors must exist to provide additional anchoring . Actin - generated tension facilitates membrane tubule scission Once the coat module factors move inwards , the resultant elongated membrane tubules are targeted by the membrane scission apparatus , including the N - BAR - domain - containing amphiphysins ( Rvs161 / Rvs167 ) and the dynamin homologue Vps1 . The amphiphysins form heterodimers that assemble at the narrowing neck of the tubular invagination , just above the clathrin coat 10 , 13 . Amphiphysin - null mutations lead to wildly inconsistent patch behaviour , including tubules that retract to the cortex 9 , 69 , 71 , 72 . In mammals , the GTPase dynamin is required for scission to complete internalization 73 . Earlier reports suggested that dynamins are not involved in yeast scission 10 , 74 . However , recent studies have resurrected Vps1 as the yeast endocytic dynamin . Although it is not required for endocytosis , Vps1 is seen at endocytic patches and vps1 Δ causes a retraction phenotype , albeit one that is much weaker than amphiphysin nulls 71 , 75 . Yeast studies have led to a model of how scission may occur 76 , 77 . In this model , membrane binding by the amphiphysins , along with other PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins ( for example , Sla2 , epsins , and Yap1801 / 2 ) , filters the charged lipids to a concentrated region of the membrane bilayer and protects them from dephosphorylation by the synaptojanins Inp51 / Sjl1 and Inp52 / Sjl2 . Meanwhile , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 outside this region continues to be dephosphorylated , causing a charge differential that produces a lipid phase boundary . When the boundary force is combined with tension supplied by actin assembly and myosin motors , scission becomes energetically favourable 76 . The retraction phenotypes of amphiphysin - null mutants are consistent with the lipid boundary model , as are the stalled elongated invaginations present in inp51 Δ inp52 Δ or inp51 Δ inp52 - ts inp53 Δ ( inp - ts ) mutants 78 , 79 . In these mutants , a lipid boundary may never form . However , it remains counterintuitive that SLA2 overexpression suppresses the inp - ts endocytic defects , as increased Sla2 should protect more PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and further retard lipid boundary formation 78 .

( d ) As the clathrin coat continues to form at the tip , Sla2 is bound by clathrin light chain causing a conformational shift ( to a closed state ) that releases the hold of Sla2 hold on F - actin . This may direct the force of actin assembly towards the formation of a tubule , as well as promote vesicle scission at the neck . 6 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2012 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W It is likely that SLA2 suppression is instead due to additional force caused by increasing actin attachments . Consistently , disruption of the Sla2 - binding region of light chains also suppressed the growth and endocytic defects of rvs161 Δ / rvs167 Δ ( ref . 69 ) . The result was an increase in successful internalization events even after cortical retraction , and suggests that increases in membrane tension can overcome deficits in phase separation . During deep invagination of the membrane , it is likely that the amphiphysins function as the equivalent of surgical retractors , holding the membrane tubule shape as the actin cytoskeleton is extended by Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin assembly , creating more tension on the peripheral Sla2 . In Schizosaccharomyces pombe , two F - BAR domain proteins ( Cdc15 and Bzz1 ) seem to be critical for scission during endocytosis 80 . Interestingly , Cdc15 is located near the cortex where it also activates myosin - 1 , but Bzz1 is located above the coat where it activates the WASp homologue Wsp1 . Thus , these proteins actually coordinate constriction of the tubule neck with actin assembly at two zones . Bzz1 also seems to function in coordinating scission in budding yeast 81 . Similar BAR domain protein – actin relationships during endocytosis are also being discovered in animal cells 82 – 84 . Disassembly of the endocytic coats and recycling of factors Following scission , coat disassembly is initiated by the synaptojanins and Ark1 / Prk1 kinases ( Fig . 2 ) 21 , 62 , 85 . Arf3 , its GTPase - activating protein Gts1 , and Lsb5 ( a GGA homologue ) are also suspected to be involved in coat disassembly , but their roles are still not well - defined 21 . Along with a role in vesicle scission , synaptojanin dephosphorylation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 promotes uncoating of epsins , AP180s and Sla2 by releasing their PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding domains 21 . After actin assembly peaks , Inp52 is recruited by the SH3 domain of Abp1 , consistent with a disassembly role late in endocytosis 21 , 62 . Arp2 / 3 complex activity and / or binding to the SH3 domain of Abp1 also mediates late recruitment of the Ark1 and Prk1 kinases ( related to AAK1 and GAK1 in animal cells ) 21 , 86 – 88 . These kinases phosphorylate a plethora of endocytic coat factors , including Pan1 , Sla1 , Ent1 / 2 , Yap1801 / 2 and Scd5 at Lxx ( Q / T ) xTG motifs 87 , 89 – 94 , and interaction of some of these factors is diminished by this phosphorylation 87 , 92 . Furthermore , ark1Δ prk1Δ mutants have endocytic defects and accumulate large cytoplasmic aggregates of endocytic factors , F - actin and membrane , also supporting a disassembly role 85 , 95 – 97 . Mutation of all Prk1 phosphorylation sites on Pan1 to alanine leads to similar phenotypes 97 . Additionally , Prk1 inhibits Pan1 binding to F - actin and its Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity 97 . Thus , Prk1 phosphorylation may negatively regulate actin assembly by deactivating Pan1 at the end of internalization . Ark1 / Prk1 modifications must be reversed by dephosphorylation to reactivate coat proteins for new rounds of internalization . In yeast , this is achieved by Scd5 - mediated targeting of protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) to Ark1 / Prk1 - phosphorylated endocytic factors 87 , 98 , 99 . Scd5 is recruited to the cortex during the late immobile phase of internalization 87 , 100 , although cortical recruitment is not required for its endocytic function 96 . Consistent with a role in recycling endocytic factors , scd5 mutants are suppressed by deletion of PRK1 ( refs 87 , 91 ) , and mutation of the PP1 - binding site in Scd5 impairs endocytosis 89 , 98 . Scd5 itself is a target of Prk1 , so its phosphorylation after vesicle scission may be another means to accelerate uncoating 87 , 89 , 91 . Although Ark1 and Prk1 mediate disassembly of endocytic coats in yeast , the major mammalian homologue , AAK1 , instead promotes endocytosis by phosphorylating the μ - subunit of AP - 2 , increasing the adaptor’s affinity for membranes and cargo - sorting motifs 101 – 103 . The related kinase , GAK , also phosphorylates AP - 2 μ - chains , but GAK is more likely to function in the uncoating of clathrin coats during endocytosis through its auxilin domain 104 – 107 . Yeast also has an auxilin , but it is not required for endocytosis 21 . The paradigm most similar to yeast phosphoregulation of endocytosis is found at the nerve synapse , where in resting neurons several endocytic factors are cytosolic and inactive due to phosphorylation by inhibitory kinases such as Cdk5 ( refs 108 – 111 ) . Synaptic transmission leads to calcium influx and activation of calcineurin , which dephosphorylates and reactivates the endocytic factors required for synaptic vesicle recycling . Finally , the actin network is quickly broken down by molecules that bind and sever actin , including Cof1 ( ADF / cofilin ) , Aip1 , Crn1 ( coronin ) and Srv2 . Cof1 , Aip1 and Crn1 , similarly to Ark1 / Prk1 and Sjl2 , are recruited with a delay after peak actin activity , so their arrival coincides with actin disassembly 112 , 113 . ADP - actin is preferentially bound by Cof1 , and many Cof1 molecules can bind cooperatively to the sides of the actin cable to produce biochemical twisting , leading to the severing of actin between cofilin attachment sites 114 – 116 . Aip1 interacts with the Cof1 – ADP - actin complex and caps the newly exposed barbed end , thus preventing elongation 117 , 118 . Srv2 binds to Cof1 to displace the ADP - actin monomers from Cof1 ( refs 117 , 119 – 121 ) , whereas Crn1 enhances Cof1 - mediated severing of older actin and ADP - actin filaments 122 . The cooperation of these factors allows for efficient and rapid disassembly of the actin network , which may also help to propel the vesicle into the cell . Conclusions and new frontiers CME in yeast and higher eukaryotes requires almost all the same factors and proceeds with similar timing 53 , 123 . Although the role of actin in animal cell CME has been controversial , overwhelming evidence now validates its importance 82 , 83 , 124 – 128 . Recent electron micrographs have allowed clear visualization of actin filaments and their orientation at the CCP ( ref . 125 ) . Although yeast endocytosis is uniformly dependent on actin , it becomes more important in mammalian cells during specialized events such as the uptake of viral particles or endocytosis at focal adhesions and other regions of membrane tension 124 , 126 – 129 . These events are likely to require the force of actin assembly to overcome resistance due to particle size or membrane attachment . These ‘specialized’ internalizations may be more comparable to yeast CME , given that the yeast plasma membrane is constantly in contact with the cell wall and under high turgor pressure 130 . In fact , actin is less essential for yeast endocytosis following hypertonic treatment 131 . Additionally , cell shrinkage may also break connections between the plasma membrane and cell wall , thereby reducing the necessity for actin - assembly - induced tension . Emerging technologies have uncovered additional similarities between yeast and animal CME . A new cell - free system utilizing GTP - γS to block membrane fission , combined with electron microscopy and high - resolution fluorescence microscopy , enabled determination of the three - dimensional localization of endocytic factors on arrested invaginations 83 . These resultant long membrane tubules are reminiscent of yeast endocytic invaginations described by Idrissi et al . 13 . Live - cell imaging of endocytosis in animal cells has also seen major advances over the last ten years .

All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W signatures of 34 mammalian endocytic factors in relation to scission , demonstrating conserved endocytic behaviours with analogous yeast components 53 . Now , a new targeting technique may enable the tagging of single copies of mammalian genes at their endogenous loci for the study of CME , in much the same way that has been possible in yeast 123 . Finally , new studies uncovered a non - clathrin - mediated , Arp2 / 3 - complex - independent internalization pathway in yeast that is dependent on formin and Rho1 , similar to the RhoA pathway in animal cells 132 . This opens the door to using molecular genetic approaches in yeast to study another conserved endocytic pathway . Our expanding knowledge of CME is validating the yeast model as an evolutionary template for this process . Attention is now focussing on endocytic specialization in the mammalian system to understand the vast diversity of endocytic patches and clathrin structures . However , yeast remains an ideal tool for uncovering the detailed molecular mechanisms of this essential process , because these fundamentals are transferable to all living organisms .
