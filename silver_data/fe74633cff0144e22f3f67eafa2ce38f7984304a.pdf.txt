As birds breed in most terrestrial habitats 31 worldwide , we proposed that variation in eggshell conductance has evolved to 32 optimise embryonic development under different breeding conditions . This is the first 33 study to take a broad - scale macro - ecological view of avian eggshell conductance , 34 encompassing all key avian taxonomic groups , to assess how life history and climate 35 influence the evolution of this trait . Using whole eggs spanning a wide phylogenetic 36 diversity of birds , we determine that body mass , temperature seasonality and whether 37 both parents attend the nest are the main determinants of eggshell conductance . Birds 38 breeding at high latitudes , where seasonal temperature fluctuations are greatest , will 39 benefit from lower eggshell conductance to combat temporary periods of suspended 40 embryo growth and prevent dehydration during prolonged incubation . The nest 41 microclimate is more consistent in species where parents take turns incubating their 42 clutch , resulting in lower eggshell conductance . This study highlights the remarkable 43 functional qualities of eggshells and their importance for embryo survival in extreme 44 climates . 45 46 Keywords : avian eggshells , climate , life - history , nest , temperature seasonality , water 47 vapour conductance 48 49 50 51 3 1 . Introduction 52 53 Adaptive diversification across species typically occurs amidst an array of distinct 54 ecological niches and environments , and is a key driver in the development of novel 55 functional traits to enhance the fitness of an organism [ 1 ] . The evolution of a new trait 56 may provide the adaptive potential to exploit a resource that was not previously 57 possible , or interact with its environment in a new way without a specific change in the 58 external environment [ 2 ] . Close association between certain traits and a species 59 environment and life - history can therefore point to probable causes of trait divergence 60 [ 3 ] . Traits can evolve rapidly over several generations or slowly over millions of years 61 in accordance with environmental rates of change [ 4 ] . Species persistence during 62 abrupt climate change will , therefore , depend on their ability to rapidly respond and 63 adapt to novel environmental conditions [ 5 ] . Individual species will either move to more 64 favourable conditions , tolerate or adapt to their changed environment , or go extinct [ 6 ] . 65 Understanding the evolutionary history and diversification of functional traits closely 66 linked to reproductive success will help predict how species will react to these new 67 environmental pressures . 68 69 Foremost , the survival of any species is reliant on having a viable embryo . One crucial 70 step in understanding avian responses to environmental differences over evolutionary 71 time is a better appreciation of factors shaping avian incubation and their subsequent 72 influence on the embryo [ 7 ] . Birds have evolved multiple functional traits to improve 73 offspring survival in the nest : arguably one of the most important is the eggshell . Most 74 bird species lose 10 - 20 % of their fresh egg mass over the incubation period through 75 the passive diffusion of water vapour through the eggshell to the ambient air [ 8 ] . Eggs 76 4 that lose too much water during incubation frequently do not hatch due to desiccation 77 [ 9 ] , while embryos that do not lose enough water from the egg experience respiratory 78 problems or drown [ 10 ] . Maintaining controlled loss of water from inside the egg to the 79 external environment while allowing sufficient exchange of respiratory gases is , 80 therefore , essential for normal embryo development and hatching . 81 82 Birds are highly diversified and widely distributed , occupying every continent on Earth 83 and every terrestrial habitat within it [ 11 ] . Some birds breed in extremely inhospitable 84 environments , such as cold and dry regions [ 12 ] , deserts [ 13 ] , moist wetlands [ 14 ] and 85 high altitudes [ 15 ] . Among these are ground nesting birds in alpine or Arctic / Antarctic 86 regions that must cope with unpredictable wind , precipitation , and snow conditions , 87 with ambient temperatures fluctuating from below freezing to over 45 o C [ 16 ] . Avian 88 embryos in such cold regions will freeze to death if left unattended by their parents 89 [ 17 ] . Deserts birds that breed in the Sahara , Arabian and Kalahari regions face 90 extreme physiological challenges to conserve water and avoid dehydration for the 91 eggs , adults and hatchlings [ 18 ] . In contrast to dry , xeric environments , eggs exposed 92 to high precipitation are prone to rain - induced suffocation [ 19 ] . The major challenges 93 for birds breeding in high altitude regions like the Himalayas is the low barometric 94 pressure and high solar radiation , which can result in desiccation of egg contents and 95 overheating of the embryo [ 15 ] . Species living at such environmental extremes must 96 adapt behaviourally or physiologically at each stage of their breeding cycle if they are 97 to produce viable offspring [ 20 ] . 98 99 Water vapour conductance through the avian eggshell , herein referred to as 100 conductance or G H2O , is influenced by the properties of the eggshell ( e . g . , pore length , 101 5 functional pore area and eggshell cuticle ) and humidity and gas composition of the 102 surrounding environment . Species that incubate their eggs buried [ 21 ] , in dry [ 22 ] or 103 wet environments [ 23 ] or at high altitudes [ 15 ] have particularly unusual vapour 104 pressure gradients , yet are still able to maintain water loss within acceptable limits . 105 G H2O may be optimised to suit particular environments through changes in nest - site 106 preferences , eggshell structures , and incubation behaviours [ 14 ] , making eggs and 107 their species - specific conductance ideal model systems for understanding how trait 108 selection varies over time during diversification . 109 110 Predicting G H2O of a species is not straight forward , as multiple ecological factors must 111 be taken into account . For example , brood - chambers of burrow - nesting birds are often 112 permanently saturated with water vapour , resulting in a low water - vapour pressure 113 ( favouring enhanced conductance ) and longer incubation periods ( favouring reduced 114 conductance ) [ 24 ] . Inter - species differences in G H2O thus can only be untangled by 115 considering the contribution of multiple life - history traits , and the phylogenetic history 116 of the lineage . A study across 141 non - passerine species detected differences in G H2O 117 between nest types and parental incubation behaviours [ 25 ] , emphasising the 118 importance of maintaining a suitable nest microclimate for optimum egg - water loss . 119 However , it is unknown whether a similar relationship between conductance and 120 nesting behaviour is expected in the passerines , which comprise over 6 , 000 species 121 and represent almost 60 % of all living birds [ 26 ] . Moreover , previous studies have 122 typically focused either on ( i ) one group of birds , e . g . , gulls , with the goal to look for 123 micro - adaptations between closely related species [ 27 ] , or ( ii ) eggs of ‘extreme 124 nesters’ such as desert - nesting Bedouin fowl ( Gallus domesticus ) [ 28 ] and grey gulls 125 ( Larus modestus ) [ 29 ] , water - nesting grebes and divers [ 30 ] and marsh - nesting black 126 6 terns ( Chlidonias niger ) [ 31 ] . The role of life - history and environmental factors in the 127 evolution of avian eggshell conductance thus requires a large - scale comparative 128 analysis encompassing all key taxonomic groups . 129 130 Our aim was to evaluate how climate and life - history influence G H2O across a wide 131 taxonomic distribution of birds spanning across 28 avian orders , after accounting for 132 the effects of adult body mass and phylogeny . Previous comparative analyses of 133 eggshell conductance have not corrected for allometric effects of body mass [ 25 ] , 134 which can hide potentially important adaptive information relating to the environment 135 and nesting behaviour of the species . Based on previous findings , we predicted G H2O 136 would be primarily explained by body mass . In contrast , we predict that mass - 137 independent conductance ( R G H2O ) would be primarily associated with traits known to 138 affect nest humidity , including climate , nest location and type . 139 140 2 . Materials and methods 141 142 ( a ) Egg samples and preparation 143 144 In total , 365 bird species were included in this study . Conductance of whole emptied 145 eggs at the Natural History Museum , Tring ( NHM , UK ) was established using the 146 standard protocol of measuring the decrease in egg mass as a result of water loss 147 over consecutive days , in eggs kept in constant moisture - free conditions [ 32 ] . G H2O 148 measured using whole eggshells is preferable to eggshell fragments as shell thickness 149 and porosity varies between different regions of an egg [ 33 ] ; therefore , we only used 150 values from whole eggs in this study . 151 7 152 Eggs were prepared by gently cleaning the surface , filling the egg with water then 153 sealing the blow hole ( see Supporting Information ) . Eggs were placed in an acrylic 154 desiccator cabinet ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Nalgene™ , catalogue number : 5317 - 155 0070 ) inside a constant - temperature thermocabinet ( Porkka , Hertfordshire , UK ) at 156 30±1°C . Temperature was monitored via a logtag analyser every 10 min ( Loggershop , 157 Bournemouth , Dorset , UK ) . Self - indicating silica gel ( Merck , Honenbrunn , Germany , 158 catalog number : 101969 ) were placed in the desiccator to remove all moisture . Any 159 loss in egg mass was entirely due to the diffusion of water vapour via the shell pores 160 [ 34 ] . The first 24 - hrs can give unexpectedly high mass loss values as the outer shell 161 surface dries out [ 35 ] . Therefore , the eggs were left 24 - hr before being weighed to the 162 nearest 0 . 1 mg ( Sartorius , Göttingen , Germany ) , then were returned to the desiccator . 163 Eggs were weighed at the same time of day on three successive days to give two 164 values of 24 - hr mass loss ( M H2O ) . Species G H2O was then calculated , as described in 165 the Supporting Information . 166 167 Species mean G H2O values of whole eggs reported in the literature ( n = 188 ) were 168 incorporated if specimens had been measured under constant conditions 169 ( temperature and humidity ) , and followed protocols used in the present study . G H2O 170 measures from whole fresh eggs ( unemptied or water - filled ) and museum ( water - filled ) 171 eggs were combined as G H2O does not differ significantly between these treatments 172 [ 36 ] . Mean G H2O values reported in the literature were corrected to adjusted to 173 standard barometric pressure ( 1 ATM ) at 30 o C ( see Supporting Information ) . 174 175 ( b ) Life - history and ecological data 176 8 177 We collated data on 18 key life - history traits that have previously been hypothesised 178 to play a role in the evolution of avian conductance in addition to climate variables 179 ( table 1 ) . This data was extracted from multiple sources detailed in the Figshare 180 repository ( DOI : 10 . 6084 / m9 . figshare . 12490559 ) . Major sources are detailed in 181 section ( e ) of Supplementary Information . Only 13 predictors were included in the 182 analysis due to collinearity ( see Supporting Information ) . Phylogenetic generalised 183 least squares ( PGLS ) method was used to test the evolutionary association between 184 whole eggshell G H2O life - history traits , within a phylogenetic context [ 37 ] . In this 185 procedure , closely related species are assumed to have more similar traits because 186 of their shared ancestry and consequently will produce more similar residuals from the 187 least squares regression line . By taking into account the expected covariance structure 188 of these residuals , modified slope and intercept estimates are generated that account 189 for interspecific autocorrelation due to phylogeny . 190 191 Prior to updated avian phylogenies based on genomic DNA , near - passerines was a 192 term given to tree - dwelling birds ( within the conventional non - passerines ) that were 193 traditionally believed to be related to Passeriformes due to ecological similarities . In 194 this study Pterocliformes ( sandgrouse ) , Columbiformes ( pigeons ) , Cuculiformes 195 ( cuckoos ) , Caprimulgiformes ( nightjars ) , and Apodiformes ( swifts , hummingbirds ) 196 were defined as near - passerines . All passerines and near - passerines are land birds 197 and have altricial and nidicolous ( stay within the nest ) chicks , while non - passerine 198 chicks vary in their mode of development and include water and land birds [ 38 ] . 199 Sandgrouse are an exception as they have precocial young and are not tree - dwelling 200 [ 39 ] . In respect to nest architecture , most passerines build open - cup nests , though 201 9 some build more elaborate dome structures with roofs [ 40 ] . Dome nests , however , are 202 more common among passerines than non - passerines , and are particularly frequent 203 among very small passerines [ 41 ] . Although these groups are no longer recognised 204 as near - passerines , this definition was used here to distinguish between ecologically 205 profound differences among birds . 206 207 Avian phylogenetic trees were constructed online ( http : / / www . birdtree . org ) from the 208 complete avian phylogeny of Jetz et al . [ 42 ] , and used the primary backbone tree of 209 Hackett et al . [ 43 ] . Ten thousand trees were constructed and statistical analyses were 210 performed in the program R , version 3 . 6 . 1 ( R Software , Vienna , Austria , http : / / www . R - 211 project . org ) . All quantitative variables ( except absolute median latitude , annual 212 temperature and temperature range ) were log 10 - transformed prior to phylogenetic 213 analysis to reduce skewness [ 44 ] . 214 215 As body mass affects all aspects of animal biology and ecology [ 45 ] , our initial set of 216 phylogenetic analysis account for adult body mass by including this variable as a 217 predictor of log ( G H2O ) . We repeated our phylogenetic analysis using mass - corrected 218 G H2O as the response variable , herein called relative G H2O ( R G H2O ) , thereby removing 219 adult body mass as a predictor . R G H2O values were computed as residuals from a 220 PGLS regression of log ( G H2O ) on log ( body mass ) ( slope = 0 . 53 ± 0 . 03 s . e . ; intercept 221 = −0 . 69 ± 0 . 12 s . e . ; λ = 0 . 68 ; figure S1 ) for G H2O . Using this second series of models , 222 we can ask how well one or more life - history traits results in higher or lower G H2O than 223 is expected for a given body mass of the adult bird . 224 225 10 Phylogenetic signal in G H2O and R G H2O was measured by Pagel’s lambda ( λ ) [ 46 ] using 226 the phylosig function in the package ‘phytools’ [ 47 ] to determine to what the extent 227 related species were more likely to share similar conductance values than species 228 drawn randomly from a tree . The phylosig function was used to test the hypothesis 229 that Pagel ' s λ is different from 0 . To test the alternative hypothesis ( that Pagel ' s λ is 230 less than 1 ) , we computed the difference in the log - likelihood ratio of the lambda model 231 ( phylosig function ) and Brownian motion model ( brownie . lite function ) , then compared 232 it to a chi - squared ( χ 2 ) distribution with 1 degree of freedom . PGLS models were fitted 233 using the phylolm function in the package ‘phylolm’ [ 48 ] . We ran the full model 234 containing all traits as predictor variables , then used the ‘pdredge’ function from the 235 package MuMIn [ 49 ] to fit all possible model combinations with a maximum of five 236 predictors following protocols by Powney et al . [ 50 ] , in addition to a null model 237 comprising only the intercept . The best subset of models had an AICc ( Akaike’s 238 information criterion adjusted for low sample size ) within 2 of the model with the lowest 239 AICc [ 51 ] . Conditional model averaging was then used to identify parameter estimates 240 and importance for each trait present in at least one of the subset models [ 52 ] . 241 242 3 . Results 243 244 In total , we used over 2533 eggs from 364 species to assess diversification in 245 conductance across the avian phylogeny . These species span across 85 families and 246 represent 28 of the 49 extant avian orders . Overall , bird species in Australia , North 247 America and South America had higher log ( G H2O ) and R G H2O than species in Africa , 248 Europe and Asia ( figure S2 ) . G H2O was highest for large flightless birds ( e . g . , ostriches 249 ( Struthio camelus ) ( 106 . 99 mg day - 1 Torr - 1 ) ) , nightjars ( Caprimulgiformes 0 . 55 ± 0 . 19 250 11 mg day - 1 Torr - 1 ) and songbirds ( Passeriformes 0 . 74 ± 0 . 05 mg day - 1 Torr - 1 ) . G H2O was 251 also high for aquatic birds ( e . g . , common loons ( Gavia immer ) 98 . 82 mg day - 1 Torr - 1 ) , 252 kiwis ( Southern brown kiwi ( Apteryx australis ) 26 . 22 mg day - 1 Torr - 1 ) and penguins 253 ( Sphenisciformes 22 . 66 ± 5 . 45 mg day - 1 Torr - 1 ) . Viewing total phylogenetic variation in 254 this trait ( figure 1 a and 2 a ) revealed that log ( G H2O ) and R G H2O were typically lower in 255 passerines and near - passerines , than non - passerines ( figure 1 b ) . 256 257 ( a ) Phylogenetic correlation 258 259 Phylogenetic signal for log ( G H2O ) and R G H2O ( see table 2 ) was significantly different 260 from 0 ( i . e . , no phylogenetic signal ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) and 1 ( i . e . , the Brownian explanation ) 261 ( P < 0 . 001 ) , meaning that while there is an effect of phylogeny on conductance , it is 262 influenced by evolutionary process that are weaker than would be seen with a 263 Brownian motion model of trait evolution . Phylogenetic signal was high for Log ( G H2O ) 264 ( λ = 0 . 96 ) , showing that closely related species exhibit similar eggshell conductance 265 prior to accounting for differences in body mass , and this biological similarity 266 decreases as the evolutionary distance between species increases . Phylogenetic 267 signal was intermediate for R G H2O ( λ = 0 . 55 ) , suggesting that phylogeny and other 268 selective pressures ( e . g . , those associated with species life - history or climate ) are 269 important in determining eggshell conductance , after accounting for differences in 270 species body mass . 271 272 ( b ) Life - history and climate influence conductance across birds 273 274 12 Adult body mass and temperature seasonality were the strongest predictors of 275 log ( G H2O ) across all birds based on conditionally averaged models ( Table S1 in 276 Supporting Information ) . Log ( G H2O ) was significantly higher among heavier species 277 ( z = 18 . 40 , P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 1 c and 3 a ) since initial egg mass increases with adult body 278 mass ( n = 251 , r 2 = 0 . 89 , P < 0 . 001 [ 52 ] ) . Log ( G H2O ) was negatively associated with 279 increased temperature seasonality across all birds ( z = 2 . 13 , P = 0 . 03 ; figure 2 b and 3 b ) . 280 Temperature seasonality is defined here as the amount of temperature variation over 281 a given year ( or averaged years ) based on the standard deviation of monthly 282 temperature averages [ 53 ] . There was also a weaker yet significant effect of dietary 283 calcium , nest location , mode of development , shared incubation and parental contact 284 among top - ranked models ( table S2 ) . 285 286 Temperature seasonality ( z = 2 . 20 , P = 0 . 03 ) and whether contact incubation was 287 shared among parents ( z = 2 . 22 , P = 0 . 03 ) were significant in conditional averaged 288 models after accounting for adult body mass ( R G H2O ) ( table S3 and figure 2 ) . R G H2O 289 overall decreased with temperature seasonality ( figure 2 b and 3 b ) . R G H2O was higher 290 in species where both parents incubate the clutch ( figure 2 c ) . Dietary calcium , mode 291 of development , nest location , and parental contact showed weaker but significant 292 correlations with R G H2O among top - ranked models ( table S4 ) . R G H2O was higher in 293 species with calcium - rich diets , precocial young , parents that return to the nest with 294 wet plumage and ground nesters compared to tree nesters ( figure S6 ) . Based on 295 conditionally averaged models for G H2O and R G H2O , eggshell conductance across 296 birds is primarily influenced by adult body mass , temperature seasonality and parent 297 incubation strategies . 298 299 13 4 . Discussion 300 301 This study focused on one performance trait – conductance – of modern avian 302 eggshells to better understand how birds have achieved high ecological diversity . We 303 identified the importance of phylogeny , physiology ( body mass and mode of 304 development ) , behaviour ( diet , parental incubation strategies and nest location ) and 305 climate in the evolution of this trait . This study is the first to identify a broad - scale 306 reduction in eggshell conductance where temperature seasonality increases . Regions 307 with greater temperature seasonality experience a greater range in temperatures over 308 the course of a year , and correlates with an organisms’ temperature tolerance breadth 309 [ 54 ] . Increased temperature seasonality occurs further from the equator and is 310 associated with a decline in annual temperature , precipitation and day length [ 55 ] . A 311 comparative study on 139 bird species found that adults inhabiting low and seasonally 312 variable temperatures had lower basal metabolic rate after removing the effects of 313 body mass [ 56 ] . In light of this , it appears possible that eggshells are already preparing 314 the embryo for adulthood , with respect to their environment and breeding biology . 315 Amniotic embryos adjust their metabolic activity and active cell division in response to 316 varying environmental conditions , and by doing so , alter their period of development 317 [ 57 ] . Reproductive strategies to prolong the egg state are most diverse in reptiles , and 318 less varied in birds and mammals that provide more parental care [ 58 ] . Even so , the 319 low metabolic rate expected for embryos incubated in highly seasonal climates would 320 favour a reduction in conductance to prolong their incubation period . 321 322 Broad - scale geographical trends in RG H2O identified here may be the result of long - 323 term evolutionary responses or short - term physiological modifications [ 59 ] . 324 14 Evolutionary adaptation would involve changes in G H2O over ( rather than within ) 325 generations when natural selection acts on genetic variants while acclimatisation 326 would involve reversible changes to G H2O that can happen gradually ( > 1 day ) in 327 response to recent environment [ 60 ] . Intraspecific variation in G H2O has been reported 328 across altitude [ 61 , 62 ] and humidity [ 63 , 64 ] gradients of multiple species , but the 329 timeframe in which G H2O diversification has taken place is unknown . Some studies 330 propose that rapid evolution of eggshell structure from exposure to novel environments 331 is unlikely [ 65 , 66 ] , and is instead compensated by behavioural modifications of the 332 parents . Other studies find that incubation behaviour does not significantly modulate 333 conductance [ 67 ] , so adaptive responses must be accomplished by changes in 334 eggshell structure [ 63 ] . 335 336 Birds are seemingly capable of short - term and instantaneous physiological 337 adjustments in shell structure in response to environmental variation . Pigeons 338 ( Columba livia ) bred for several years within an environmentally controlled room 339 experienced ~ 30 % lower G H2O than predicted when exposed to high temperature and 340 low humidity over a short period [ 68 ] . Similarly , domestic chickens ( Gallus domesticus ) 341 bred at high elevation for multiple generations produced eggshells with a 30 % higher 342 G H2O within two months of being translocated to low altitudes [ 69 ] . In other species , 343 G H2O did not change when individuals were transferred to higher altitudes [ 70 ] or were 344 exposed to natural seasonal changes in humidity [ 71 ] , suggesting there is variation in 345 the plasticity of a species response . Identifying the speed of the response in eggshell 346 parameters to novel environments across multiple species will be very informative in 347 determining climate change effects on bird species and their breeding . 348 349 15 We found that conductance across birds was also dependant on nest location , whether 350 parents alternate nest attendance , and whether the parent returns to the nest with wet 351 plumage , corroborating previous studies [ 25 , 72 ] . Shared incubation between two 352 parents allows one of them to be relieved from incubation to feed while the other 353 incubates the egg , thus allowing the eggs to be covered at all times [ 73 ] . Clutches that 354 are incubated by both parents encounter less variation in egg temperature than 355 clutches that are incubated by a single parent [ 74 ] , and thus , are expected to have 356 higher eggshell conductance . Water added to the nest by parents can be many orders 357 of magnitude higher than water lost by the eggs [ 75 ] . Consequently , RG H2O is 358 significantly higher in species where parents return the nest with wet plumage [ 25 ] . 359 Eggs laid on the ground , in a burrow , mound or on floating vegetation are subject to 360 higher humidity than arboreal nesters , leading to eggshell adaptations that promote 361 water loss . Common loons ( Gavia immer ) , for example , had the highest R G H2O of the 362 species investigated . This may be attributed to their high eggshell porosity [ 76 ] in 363 response to building nests on or near the water where transpiration of water is high , 364 and nest materials can be wet [ 64 ] . Nest location and whether parents return to the 365 nest with wet or dry plumage was significant in most top models where these predictors 366 were included , but this effect was weak compared to life - history traits retained in 367 conditionally averaged models . Combined , our results demonstrate that different 368 behavioural strategies used by parents to alter nest humidity have contributed to the 369 evolution of conductance among birds . 370 371 Variation in incubation period across the altricial - precocial spectrum reflects a trade - 372 off between embryo growth rate and degree of maturity when hatched . Precocial 373 species take up to 2 times longer to incubate an egg of the same size as altricial 374 16 species , but are far more developed when they hatch [ 77 ] . For eggs of the same mass , 375 precocial species incur a higher total energy cost than altricial species because the 376 embryo is larger for a longer period during incubation [ 78 ] . Consequently , eggs of 377 species with fast ( precocial ) growing offspring had significantly higher R G H2O than 378 those of species with slow ( altricial ) growing offspring based on top - ranked models . 379 As higher conductance enables greater gas exchange , this may optimise embryo 380 access to high energy content in precocial eggs [ 79 ] , thus resulting in a more 381 developed chick at birth . R G H2O in passerines was found here to be particularly low , 382 likely because they have altricial young , whereas non - passerines consist of precocial 383 and altricial species . 384 385 Data accessibility 386 387 Data is publicly available in the Figshare repository , including specimen and species - 388 specific water vapour conductance , life histories and sources used in this study ( DOI : 389 10 . 6084 / m9 . figshare . 12490559 ) .

Condor 89 , 620 48 – 65 . ( doi : 10 . 2307 / 1368759 ) 621 622 623 624 26 Table 1 . Putative predictions and definitions for 13 possible explanations for variation in water vapour conductance ( G H2O ) in birds . 625 Predictor Hypothesis Definition Body mass As adult body mass is correlated to egg mass , heavier birds will have higher G H2O due to greater egg surface area . Mean body mass ( g ) of adult birds . Clutch size Evaporation from multiple eggs will create a nest atmosphere of greater humidity and reduced water vapour transfer , so G H2O should be higher for species with larger clutches . Number of eggs per brood , measured as geometric mean of the typical minimum and maximum clutch size . Calcium content Eggshells of calcium - poor species are expected to be thinner , less dense and more porous than calcium - rich species , and thus facilitate higher G H2O . ( 1 ) Calcium - rich : Species that ingest mollusc shells , fish , shellfish , calcareous grit , calcareous ash or bones . ( 2 ) Calcium - poor : Species with primarily insectivorous or granivorous diet . 27 Egg maculation Maculated eggs are expected to have lower G H2O than immaculate eggs to reduce the risk of desiccation . ( 1 ) Immaculate : No spotting or markings on eggshell surface . ( 2 ) Maculation : Maculation present on eggshell surface . Nest type Fully enclosed nests have less air movement than semi - enclosed and exposed nests , facilitating greater G H2O . ( 1 ) Exposed : Nest is open above and has no side walls ( no nest , scrape , saucer , platform , heap ) . ( 2 ) Semi - enclosed : Nest is partially open and has side walls ( cup , bowl , pendant , sphere , dome , pouch ) . ( 3 ) Enclosed : Nest is entirely enclosed ( cavity , burrow , crevice ) . Nest location Nests above ground have lower risk of flooding or water accumulation , therefore will have lower G H2O . ( 1 ) Ground : Nest location in or on the ground , or floating on water . 28 ( 2 ) Tree : Nest located in tree , bush , shrub , wall , cave roof , or attached to reed . ( 3 ) Cliff : Nest located on cliff . Nest lining Incorporation of nest lining will better insulate the egg , therefore will have higher G H2O . ( 1 ) Lined : Nest lining is always or sometimes present . ( 2 ) Not lined : Nest lining is absent . Habitat Among open nesting species , more direct sunlight reaches eggs in open habitats and experience greater air movement around the nest than closed habitats . Open nesting species in open habitats will have lower G H2O than in closed habitats . ( 1 ) Open : Breeds in desert , grassland , open water , open moorland , low shrubs , rocky habitats , seashores and cities . ( 2 ) Semi - open : Breeds in open shrubland and bushland , scattered bushes , parkland , forest edge . ( 3 ) Dense : Breeds in forest with a closed canopy , or in the lower vegetation strata of dense thickets , shrubland , mangroves or marshland . 29 Incubating parent Nest vapour pressure will decrease when the parent leaves the nest uncovered , which is more likely to occur if incubation is not shared between parents , resulting in lower G H2O . ( 1 ) Shared : Contact incubation of eggs by two adults . ( 2 ) Not shared : Contact incubation of eggs by single adult . Mode of development Higher G H2O may contribute to improving the use of nutritional support by the embryo of precocial species by removing excess water , thus resulting in increased development at hatching . ( 1 ) Altricial : Newly born young are relatively immobile , naked , and usually require care and feeding by the parents . ( 2 ) Precocial : Newly born young are relatively mobile , covered in feathers , and independent . Parental care The eggs of species that provide biparental care are expected to have higher G H2O as nest humidity and temperature can be better maintained when both parents assist . ( 1 ) Uniparental : The brood is provisioned and / or defended by one adult ( 2 ) Biparental : The brood is provisioned and / or defended by two adults Parental contact The wet incubating parent returning to the nest will ( 1 ) Wet plumage : Adults returned habitually to 30 increase the nest’s humidity , thus are excepted to have higher G H2O . the nest with wet plumage . This included species that feed on freshwater or marine prey or use nests built on water . ( 2 ) Dry plumage : Adults did not return habitually to the nest with wet plumage . Temperature seasonality Eggs incubated in environments with highly variable temperature will experience lower G H2O as high temperature seasonality occurs in cooler environments . Average temperature seasonality ( BIO4 ) of breeding / resident range , based on WorldClim v1 data . Precipitation seasonality Eggs incubated in environments with highly variable precipitation will experience higher G H2O to combat temporary periods of excessive rain . Average precipitation seasonality ( BIO15 ) of breeding / resident range , based on WorldClim v1 data . 626 31 Table 2 . Estimates of phylogenetic signal in eggshell water vapour conductance 627 ( G H2O ) in all birds . Phylogenetic signal was analysed separately for log 10 - transformed 628 G H2O ( log ( G H2O ) ) and residual water vapour conductance ( R G H2O ) . The p - value tests 629 the null hypothesis of no phylogenetic signal ( λ = 0 ) and Brownian motion model ( λ = 630 1 ) of evolution . 631 Response variable Pagel’s λ Log likelihood Log likelihood for λ = 0 Log likelihood for λ = 1 P for λ = 0 P for λ = 1 log ( G H2O ) 0 . 96 - 74 . 39 590 . 76 - 125 . 64 < 0 . 001 < 0 . 001 R G H2O 0 . 55 27 . 20 258 . 50 - 92 . 27 < 0 . 001 < 0 . 001 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 32 646 Figure 1 . Relationship between conductance of whole eggs and ecological variables 647 for 364 bird species . ( a ) Phylogenetic tree from which water vapour conductance 648 ( G H2O ) data were obtained . The bar plots around the phylogeny represents the only 649 significant predictors of log ( G H2O ) in conditionally averaged models . Conditional model 650 averaging was used to obtain a single average model when more than one PGLS 651 model was best ranked ( i . e . more than one model with ΔAICc < 2 from the top ranked 652 model ) . Branch colours show the diversification in log ( G H2O ) across the phylogeny and 653 ancestral trait estimates . G H2O is plotted as a function of ( b ) avian group and ( c ) adult 654 body mass ( g ) within each of the three avian groups .

Relationship between conductance of whole eggs and ecological variables 661 for 364 bird species . ( a ) Phylogenetic tree of residual water vapour conductance 662 ( R G H2O ) . Bar plots and rings around the phylogeny represent significant predictors of 663 R G H2O in conditionally averaged models . Conditional model averaging was used to 664 obtain a single average model when more than one PGLS model was best ranked ( i . e . 665 more than one model with ΔAICc < 2 from the top ranked model ) . Branch colours show 666 the diversification in R G H2O across the phylogeny and ancestral trait estimates . R G H2O 667 is plotted as a function of ( b ) temperature seasonality within each avian group , and ( c ) 668 whether both parents incubate the eggs . In the hybrid box plot , species R G H2O are 669 shown as filled circles , vertical lines indicate the median , box shows the interquartile 670 range ( IQR ) and the whiskers are 1 . 5× IQR ( distribution is shown as histograms ) . P - 671 values are given in asterisks with * < 0 . 05 , * * < 0 . 01 and * * * < 0 . 001 .
