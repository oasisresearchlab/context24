ABSTRACT A combination is achieved of two lines of psychometric interest : a ) multidimensional scaling and b ) factor analysis . This is accom - plished with the use of three - mode factor analysis of scalar product matrices , one for each subject . Two of the modes are the groups of objects scaled And the third mode is the sample of subjects . Results are an object space , a person space , and a system for changing weights given to dimensions and of angles between dimensions in the object space for individuals lbcated at different places in the person space . The development is illustrated with data frm an adjective similarity study . 1 One line of recent development in quantitative psychology involves creation of models which incorporate description of individ - ual behavior with description of the variety of individuals with respect to this behavior . Multidimensional scaling of individual responses in comparisons among objects in a group of objects is a particular example . A separate scaling experiment could be conducted for each individual in a sample of subjects so as to obtain measures of dissimilarity between objects or pairs of objects . Such measures of dissimilarity frequently are taken as distances between points for the objects in a space which represents the responses of the subject to the objects . Tucker and Hessick ( 1963 ) presented a model for in - vestigating the variety of such spaces for a sample of individuals . An example of the application of this model to color vision data was given by Helm and Tucker ( 1962 ) . Tucker and Hessick emphasized the description of the subjects by the estabAshment of a person space . The multidimensional scaling space implied for selected " idealized individuals " could be determined by subsequent analysis and used as an aid in interpretation of the person space . In contrast ' Horan ( 1969 ) has presented a model which involves a common multidimensional space for the objects and which is utilized ' in theory ' differentially by the various subjects in a sample by different weighting of the dimen - sions by the various subjects . Horan did not develop a procedure for the description of individual subjects . Carroll and Chang ( 1969 ) developed a model similar to that of Horan but included a person 2 space . The present repOrt concerns a model which involves both a person space and a common object space and for which individual parameters may effect changes not only in the weights given to the dimensions of the object space but also in the angles between these dimensions . This model utilizes Tucker ' s ( 1966 ) recent development of three - mode factor analysis . A point of some interest is that the present model has wider applicability than to only multidimensional scaling . It may be used whenever each object in a group of objects is represented as a vector in an object space , eminating from an origin to a terminal point . Input data to analysis by the model are the scalar products of the pairs of vectors for each subject . Such scalar products may be ob - tained by some one of a variety of procedures , including direct ratings as in the data used in an example to be presented . For multidimensional scaling when measures of interpoint distances in a Euclidean space are available , these distances may be converted to scalar products of ' sectors eminating from the centroid of the ob - jects by the procedure given by Torgerson ( 1958 , aee pages 257 - 258 ) where d jk represents the distance between points for objects and k and bjk represents the scalar product between vectors for these objects . Such a conversion from interpoint distances to scalar products is to be accomplished separately for each subject . When the measures are comparative interpoint distances for each subject , a solution must be made for the additive constant for each subject and then the scalar products computed . In other cases , such as when only the rank order of the interpoint distances is known , one of the nonmotric scaling procedures like the one by Kruskal ( 1964 ) could be 3 used to scale the data for each subject so as to obtain interpoint distances and the scalar products between vectors for the objects . Consider that there are n objects in a multidimensional scaling experiment . Note that the word " object " is used to designate individual words , phrases , shapes , colored chips , etc . that are being scaled in an experiment . Subscripts j and j ' = 1 , 2 , , n will be used to designate these objects . Let data be for N individ - uals . A subscript i = 1 , 2 , N will be used to designate these individuals . The scalar product between the vectors for objects j and for individual i is designated by xjili . These scalar products may be assembled into matrices in several different ways . One way is to define a matrix Xi for each individual having a row and a column for each object . Each of these matrices will be symmet - ric with each scalar product appearing twice in symmetric locations . The diagonal entries will be the squares of the lengths of the vectors . Another way is to define a matrix X having a row for every combi - nation of j and j ' , thus having n 2 rows , and a column for each individual . The matrix X i for each individual is strung out into a column vector to form a column of the matrix X . Both of these forms will be used . Multidimensional scaling for each individual would result in a matrix A i of coordinates of the points for the objects on dimensions for the individual . Let there be i dimensions in the multidi - mensional scaling space for individual i . Matrix A i would be n x Qi with entries where qi is used as a subscript index Ai for dimensions for individual i . Matrix A i i8 related to X i by X = Ai Ai 4 ( 1 ) and may be obtained from X i by any of several matrix factoring teobniques . Its actual determination for each individual is only of theoretical concern in the present context . Consider a supermatrix formed by adjoining horizontally the Xi matrices for all individuals , thus forming ( A1 , A2 , Ai , AN ) which will be of order n x . . E Qi . Let the rank of this super matrix be P , Then matrices i B , of order n x P and rank P , and ( W1 , W2 , . . * lip so . , WN ) of order P x E Qi and rank P , exist such that i ( A 1 , A2 , el " Ai , 414 , AO B ( W 1 , W 2 , 6 . 49 WI , " " NN ) Since ( Al , A2 , Ills Ai , . . , * hashas n rows , its rank can be no greater than n thus 0 ( 2 ) n ( 3 ) where the possibility t , f P equalling zero is discelded as being trivial . Note that there is a row of B for each object . The matrix B contains all of the information about the objects and can be con - sidered to represent a common scaling space for all individuals . The matrices Ni for the individuals form transformations of the common scaling space to the individual scaling space , 5 Some relations for each individual based on the comton scaling space and the individual transformation : : . are of interest . From equation ( 2 ) Ai = B Wi ( 4 ) which when substituted in equation ( 1 ) yields Xi = B Wi WI B ' ( 5 ) and , upon the definition of the P x P , symmetric matrix Hi as Hi = Wi WI ( 6 ) becomes X . = B H B ' ( 7 ) Note that the rank of matrix Hi is the lesser of P or Qi Equation ( 7 ) gives an important relation of the individual scalar productsmatrixX . to he common scaling space matrix B and the matrix H i which contains information abput the use of the common dimensions by the individual . The foregoing development has separated parameters for the objects from parameters for the individuals . Indi - viduals may be conceived as making different use of the various common dimensions and of involving different relations among the common 6 dimensions . Each matrix H i characterizes each individual . Further interesting results may be obtained for each individual by defining a diagonal matrix Di containing the square roots of the diagonal entries in the matrix Hi Let and D 2 = Diag ( H ) Fi = B D . 0 = D1H i D1 Note that 0 i is P x P , symmetric , and has unit diagonal entries . From equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , Oi is positive , semi - definite . Thus , the off - diagonal ent ies in Oi may be considered to be cosines of angles between the common dimensions for phe individual . For any individual whose judgments were based on the same relations among the dimensions as existed for the common scaling space the matrix 0 i would be an identity . Individuals who altered the relations among the common dimensions would be characterized by Oi matrices that were not identities . Substitution of equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) into equation ( 7 ) yields ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) Xi = Fi iFi Oa ) Thus , the entries in the F i matrix are the coordinates of points for the objects standardized for the individuals ' use of the dimensions . Entries in D i may be conceived as representing the weights given the dimensions by the individual . Parameters for each individual , then , include weights which he might use in his reactions to each common scaling dimension and the cosines of the angles representing the relations between the common dimensions which would characterize the individual ' s system of reactions . A second aspect of the complete model is to be considered next . This aspect concerns development of a person space for description of the variety of individuals in a sample . While the matrices Hi contain parameters for the individuals , these matrices may not form the most compact basis for description of the sample of individuals , A more compact basis may be developed from the Matrix X which has a row for each pair of objects and a column for each individual . Consider that X is of rank M which is less than ether N or n 2 This presumes that the responses of the individuals may be described in a space having fewer dimensions than the number of indi - viduals or the number of paired objects . Such a situation may or may not be the case for any palAcular body of Observations ; and when it is not the case , as is probably true for th ? majority of ob - served bodies of data , a reduced rank desaription may or may not be an adequate approximation to the observations . A model is being con - sidered here when the rank of X is lees than its order , In this case matrices C and Z can be developed such that C hat ; n 2 rows for the pairs of objects and M columns while Z has M rows and N columns for the individuals and so that X = C Z Entries in matrix C may be designated as c Ji f m and entries in matrix Z may be designated as zmi The c ' s s however may be recorded in M matrices C m one for each column of C with a row and a column for each object . An alternative form of equation ( 12 ) is ( 12 ) M X . = E Cmz mi ( 13 ) m = 1 Note in equation ( 12 ) for any particular individual that the column of X is a weighted sum of the columns of C , the weights being the . fs for that individual . In equation ( 13 ) each of the columns of C is recorded as a matrix C m which is multiplied by the scalar z mi . These weighted matrices , Cmzmi , are summed over all dimen - sions m . This type of paired statements of relations will be used several times in the following development . Since the matrix Z has a row order , equal to the rank of X , it also has a rank of M and the product Z Z ' is non - singular and the matrix Z may be defined as Z = z ' ( z zi ) - 1 with entries z im Then , from equation ( 12 ) or 00 C = X Z ( 15 ) N C m = E Xi z im ( 16 ) i = 1 Since C m is a weighted sum of symmetric matrices X i C m is symmetric also . Substitution from equation ( 7 ) into equation ( 16 ) yields N N C m = F BH Blz im = B ( E Hiz im ) B ' i = 1 i = 1 A matrix G m may be defined as N Gm = iE 1 Hiz im = where G m is P x P and symmetric since each H i is P x P and symmetric . Substitution of equation ( 18 ) into the last term of equation ( 17 ) yields C m = BG m B ' a result that will be used subsequently . An alternative definition to that of equation ( 18 ) involves the ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) 10 matrix G , which has a row for each pair of common scale dimensions , p and p ' , and a column for each person dimension m and the matrix H , which also has a row for each pair of common scale dimen - sions and a column for each individual . Then equation ( 18 ) may be written as G = H Z A consistent relation is for H = G Z or M H . = EGz . 1 m = 1 m mi from which and equation ( 7 ) M X . = E B G Btz . 1 m mi . m = 1 The same result can be obtained by substitution from equation ( 19 ) into equation ( 13 ) . Equation ( 23 ) may be written in terms of the elements of the matrices as xJD . . , . 1 P P M = E E Eb . b . ltz g p = 1 p ' = 1 m = 1 . 3P P mi PP ' m ( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) ( 24 ) 11 This equation is of considerable interest : it is a special case of the three - mode factor analysis model developed by Tucker ( 1966 ) . A consequence is that many of the propositions and methods of analysis for three - mode factor analysis may be utilized in the present context . In this adaptation of the three - mode factor analysis theory , first point is that two of the modes are identical , the objects form two of the modes while the individuals form the third mode . One simpli - fication results , the matrix B is the factor matrix for two object modes . Another point of interest is that the , matrices Hi for the individuals are dependent on the core matrix G of the three - mode factor analysis and the factor matrix Z among individ - uals as per equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) . Thus the factor matrix Z among individuals provides a basic description of the responses of the individuals . An important topic involves possible transformations of the matrices in the m - del of equation ( 23 ) . Consider square , non - singular matrices T and U of orders P and M so that and B T = Bt U Z = Z ( 25 ) ( 26 ) where B t and Zu are the transformed matrices B and Z Inverse transformations are to be applied to the core matrix G so that M E T - 1 G m ( T / ) - 1 umm ' = G tml u m = 1 where u mm / tu is the mm ' entry in U - 1 and G m ' is the m ' matrix of the transformed core matrix . The result of these transformations is that E Bt G tu ( B t ) / zu ' i = E B Gm B ' z mi = X i m / m m ' = 1 m = 1 12 ( 27 ) ( 28 ) so that these transformations do not change the form of the model nor the representation of the scalar products . These transfor - mations are analogous to rotation of axes in factor analysis . A major difference is that there is no necessary equivalent inter - pretation of orthonormal transformations as representing uncorrelated factors and oblique transformations as representing correlated factors . The matrices T and U may or may not be orthonormal without affecting a difference in the interpretation as to corre - lations among the factors . The transformations can be carried through to the matrices Hi of individual parameters for the scaling space . The transformed Hi matrices may be designated by HI and defined by to u H i = E G m ' z m ' = 1 Then the scalar products matrices for the individuals are ( 29 ) Xi = Bt t ( Bt ) ' 1 Matrices Di Fi , and Oi may be defined analogously to equations ( 8 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) . Equation ( 11 ) then applies to the transformed matrices . A logical consequence of the possibility of transformations is that the object space of matrix B and the person space of matrix Z are identifiable from the scalar product matrices Xi but particular dimensions of these spaces are not identifiable . Some practical matters will be discussed subsequently as related to data analysis ; however , some further conditions are necessary in order to establish complete identifiability for reference matrices B Z , and G . Once such reference matrices are established uniquely , other solutions may be selected within the possibilities of transformations . Since matrices T and U are non - singular , inverse trans - formations are possible from equations ( 25 ) , ( 26 ) , and ( 27 ) so that when Bt Zu , and G tu are given along with T and U , matrices B Z , and G can be determined . When any particular solution is given with matrices Bt $ Zu , and Gtu matrices T and U may be determined such that B ' B = I ZZ ' = I 13 ( 30 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) 14 M M E G G ' m m r E G2 = 62 ( 33 ) m = 1 m = 1 m G ' G = r 2 where A 2 and r 2 are diagonal matrices . Proof of this possibility depends upon expressing the super matrix ( K1 X 2 Xi , XN ) and the matrix X in basic form ( see Horst , 1963 , pages 364 - 382 ) such that ( X1 ' X2 ' " " Xi I " " X N ) B A ( L1 L 2 ' * * * 1 Li X = YPZ L ) where A and r are diagonal matrices , ( L1 L2 2 ' . " 1 L . ' L N ) is a PxnN section of an orthonormal matrix , and Y is an n 2 x M section of an orthonormal matrix . . Note that matrices B and Z are sections of orthonormal matrices as speci - fied in equations ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) . To obtain equation ( 7 ) from equation ( 35 ) define A L . = 1 B ' so that , using equation ( 31 ) ( 34 ) ( 35 ) ( 36 ) ( 37 ) Hi = ALB 15 ( 38 ) Further algebraic manipulations involving equations ( 14 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 31 ) , and ( 32 ) yield equation ( 33 ) . To obtain equation ( 12 ) from equation ( 36 ) define Y r = c ( 39 ) Filrther algebraic manipulations involving equations ( 19 ) and ( 31 ) yield equation ( 34 ) . Equations ( 31 ) through ( 34 ) specify a useful standard form . Possible data analysis procedures will be discussed in con - junction with an example which will illustrate also a number of the features of the model . This example utilizes judgmental data on tthe relations between personality adjectivesl . Each subject judged each pair of adjectives on a nine point scale running from - 4 through 0 to + 11 . A rating of - 4 was to mean that the two adjectives in a pair were opposite in meaning while a rating of + 4 was to ; lean that the two adjectives in a pair were identical in meaning . A rating of 0 was to mean that the two adjectives were completely independent in meaning . Intermediate ratings were to mean granations of tenden - cies toward oppositeness or similarity . The twelve adjectives 1 . The questionnaire was constructed by Mr . Teddy Dielman while par - ticipating in a special seminar conducted by the author at the University of Hawaii . Mr . Dielman collected the data on the 22 subjects at the University of Hawaii . 16 listed in Table 1 were used in the study and the questionnaire included all 66 possible pairs of adjectives . Data from 87 subjects were used in the analysis , 22 graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Hawaii and 65 undergraduate students at the University of Illinois . The ratings were divided by 4 so that the adjusted ratings ranged from - 1 to + 1 . A possible psychological model represents each adjective as a unit length vector with the adjusted ratings of similarity between a pair of adjectives befng interpreted as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors for the two adjectives . Thus , a matrix Xi can be constructed from the ratings by each subject . This matrix will contain the adjusted ratings by the sub - ject . This model has an intuitive appeal in that the following relations exist . 1 ) Two adjectives judged opposite in meaning by an adjusted rating of - 1 are represented by oppositely directed vectors . 2 ) Two adjectives judged to be unrelated by an adjusted rating of 0 are represented by vectors at right angles so as to involve unrelated directions in the space . 3 ) Two adjectives judged to be identical by an adjusted rating of + 1 are represented by identical vectors . Ratings between - 1 , 0 , and + 1 , represent partial degrees of relatedness which may be taken to be equivalent to cosines of angles in the ranges of 1800 90° , and 0° , respectively . The ratings by each subject were recorded in a 12 x 12 matrix X i with each rating recorded in the two , symmetrically located cells 17 for the pair of adjectives . Values of + 1 were recorded in the diagonal cells for the squares of the lengths of the vectors . Analysis followed Tucker ' s ( 1966 , pp 297 - 298 ) method I which utilizes an Eckart - Young ( 1936 ) type approximation for each mode of the data matrix . Since , in the present case , two of the modes are identical , being the adjectives , the analyses for these modes were identical and required only one run through the computer . The super matrix ( K , , , X . , . . . , X N ) was formed , the product ( X 1 , X 2 ' . . . , X . , 0 . 0 , XN ) ( X 1 , X 2 , 00 . , X . . 00 , XN ) ' was computed , and characteristic roots and vectors of this product were obtained . The plot in Figure 1 of root size against root number was inspected to determine the number of dimensions to retain for the object ( adjective ) space . Roots 1 and 2 appear quite distinct from the remaining roots while roots 4 through 12 are quite close to a straight line . Root 3 is slightly above the straight line drawn through roots 4 through 12 . A decision was made to retain three dimensions in the object space ; that Is , the Lumber P of dimensions in the object space was set equal to 3 . Thus , the matrix B , given in Table 1 , contained the first three characteristic vectors . This matrix is in the standard form defined in equation ( 31 ) . Matrix X was formed by recording the entries in each matrix X . as a column vector . Thus , matrix X had 144 ( = 12 squared ) rows and 87 columns , one for each subject . Since the number of columns was less than the number of rows , the product X ' X was computed and the characteristic roots and vectors of this product were determined . Figure 2 presents the plot of root size against root number . The points on this plot appear to lie on a hyperbolic shaped curve so 18 that there is no clear break to aid in deciding on the number of dimensions to retain for the person space . The first root is con - siderably larger than any of the remaining roots ; however , the dif - ferences between successive roots 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 are somewhat larger than the differences between successive roots 5 onward . From this observation , a 4 dimensional person space was selected for use in this example ; that is , the number M of dimensions for the person space was set at 4 . Matrix Z ' contained the first four characteristic vectors . This matrix is in the standard form defined in equation ( 32 ) , in subsequent processing it was multiplied by V1T , which equals Tr in this study , so that the sum of squares of entries in each column became equal to N Figure 3 presents the dimensional plots , or scatter plots , for pairs of dimensions of the adjusted matrix Z . Matrix C was computed by C 2 X V ( 40 ) a relation that may be derived from equations ( 12 ) and ( 32 ) and which is consistent with an Eckert - Young rsclution of the matrix X An alternative procedure for determination of the person space is useful when the number of rtms of X is less than the number of columns ; that is , n 2 < N . In this procedure the matrix product X X ' is formed and its characteristic roots and vectors are Obtained . OW OM Note that the non - zero roots are identical for X ' X and X X ' , the one of these matrices having a larger order having more zero roots . Thus the root aize against root number plot is identical for the al - ternative proceeures and the decision as to number of dimensions to retain remains the same . Once the value of M is settled , a matrix Y may be formed containirg the first M characteristic vectors of X X ' , Let A be a diagonal matrix containing the M selected characteristic roots . Then and C AI / 2 Z 2 A ' 1 / 2Y ' X where A 1 / 2 is diagonal containing the equhre roots of the charac - teristic roots and A - 1 / 2 is diagonal containing the reciprocals of the square roots of the characteristic roots . Once the Aatricos B , and C are determined the core mattix zlay be computed . Matrices Cm are farmed from the columns of C , one matrix for each 4olumn of C As per the discussion following equations ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) , each Cm matrix for the example was 12 x 12 , symmetric with a row and a column for each of the 12 adjectives . Matrices G m are computed by G m 2 8 ' C m 19 ( 141 ) ( 42 ) ( 43 ) which may be derived from equations ( 19 ) and ( 31 ) . The matrices G m for the example are given in Table 2 . They are 3 x 3 , symmetric with a row and a column for each dimension in the object space . 20 Transformations of the axes of the object space and of the person space are considered next . The specific form of theue transformations depends upon the nature of the domain of phenomena being investigated , the design of the study , and relations observed in the data and the results obtained in matrices B , ZiandG . The only general principle is that the transformations should aid in the interpretation of the results . These interpretations are dependent not only upon the results obtained from the study bit also upon the design of the study and upon knowledge of the domain of phenomena being studied . Rotation to simple structure is not always appropriate and should be expliatly justified as meaningful when employed by an investigator . Use of a varimax rotation ( Kaiser , 1958 ) shoulei not be an automatic , reflex reaction for rotation of axes in factor analytil type analyses . In the adjective similarity study the adjectives were selected so as to , possibly , be representable in a two dimensional space having dimensions related to strength and to calmness . There were siw pairs of more or less opposite meaning adjectives , two pairs for strength , two pairs for calmness , one pair for a combination of strength and calmness , and one pair for a combination of strength and the negative of calmness . Thus , if the hypotheses made curing the selection of the adjectives were correct , the adjective vectors should radiate like spokes of a wheel in a two dimensional space . This is not the type of configuration for a simple structure . A different principle was required for determin - ation of a transformation in the object space . The design for the adjective similarity study was almost success - ful in terms of a two dimensional space . There were two large roots 21 as shown in Figur 1 for the Object space . However , a small third dimension appeared to exist , In order to define the transformation of axes in the three dimensional space a decision was made to define three " conceptual " adjectives each of which might be considered as pure for each of the transformed dimensions . For a strength dimension , which had an intuitive appeal for a meaningful dimension , the centroid or four adjecti ( pe vectors was Obtained : 7 , Gtrong ; 8 , courageous ; weak reflected ; and - 2 , cowardly reflected . This vector is the fimt row of matrix B c given in Table 3 , The two positive vec . cors were nearly co - linear while the negative vectors were nearly oppo - sitely directe , : from the poaitivt . vectors so that with the reflections the four vectors formed a relatively tight cluster . Calmnes & appealed as a second dimension and was represented by a conceptual vector determined as the centroid of three adjective vectors : 3 , serene ; 6 , calm ; - 12 , excitable reflected . Adjective 9 , nervous , appeared as not being sufficiently opposite to 3 , serene , and 6 , calm , to be included in the cluster . The second row of matrix Bc it Table 3 is the conceptual vector for calmness . A problem remained as to the nature of the third dimension and the definition of an appropriate conceptual vector . After mud : study a decision was made to une adjective 4 , self - conscious , to define the third conceptual vector . This adjective has the highest loading on the unexpected third dimension . Thus , the third row of matrix Be is the vector for adjective 4 , self - conscious , Matrix Be can be considered to be a vertical extension of matrix B so that equation ( 25 ) can be used to yiald B T 2 Bt 22 ( 44 ) where B t is the transformed matrix B c In the present scheme for developing T Btc is to be a diagonal matrix . Before completing the development of matrix T the possibility of a transformation of the aces in the person space was studied . In - spection cf the dimension plots for the subject space revealed no particular clustering of the individuals other than that they were all positive on the first dimension , see F . 4gure 3 . No othep prin - ciple was appearant for a transformation . The first dimension would , then , represent a general dimension among the individuals and the other Three dimensions would be interpreted as representing de / ient perceptions of the similarity rIlations among the adjee ' cives . As noted previously , a deoision was made to scale the 1 matrix so that the sum of squares of the person coordinates on each dimension would equal N . This scaling should make the person coefficients independent of the sample size except for sampling variance . The entries in the characteristic vector of a person space tend to be ' inversely related to the sample size since the sum of squares are restricted to unity . The preceding decisions resulted in the trans - formation matrix U being defined as U 2 AT I ( 45 ) ( Note that this is not a general definition of U s ) This resealing of the person coefficients results in an inverse resealing of the core matrices G u = 1 G At a One other decision was made which affected the transformation 23 ( 46 ) matrix T for the object space ' the diagonal entries in the trans - formed core matrix G t1 u , for the general dimension among individuals , should be unity . This may be accomplished defining a diagonal matrix S such that S 2 = Diag ( Bc GI Bic ) ( 47 ) Then the matrix T is definei such that , _ 1 1 = S . B ( 48 ) Table 3 presents the computation ! for the Adjective Similarity Study . The transformed object space matrix Bt is given at the T - ght in Table 1 and the transformed core matrix is given at the right in Table 2 , Inspection of the transformed matrix Bt for the adjectives indicates some interesting relations . As expected , the fi - , st di - mension , A , may be characterized as strength with the adjectives 7 , strong , and 8 , courageous having high positive coefficients and the adjectives 1 , weak , and 2 , cowardly having negative loadings high in absolute value . These adjectives have trivial loadings on the other two dimensions . The second dimension , B ma ; be character - ized as Falmness with adjectives 6 , calm , and 3 , serene having high positive loadings and the adjective 12 , excitable , having a negative 24 loading high in absolute value . The adjectives have trivial loadings on dimensions A and C . The third dimension , C , is charac - terized by a high positive loading for the adjective 4 , self - conscious . Interesting descriptions are given for the other adjectives . Adjective 5 , retiring , is slightly weak , high on calmness and on self - consciousness . Adjective 9 , nervous , is negative on calmness and positive on self - consciousness . Adjective 10 , self - confident , is positive on strength and calmness while being negative on self - consciousness . Adjective 11 , aggressive , is positive on strength , negative on calmness , and slightly negative on self - consciousness . These descriptions of the adjectives appear quite reasonable . Interpretation of the core matrix and the person space dimensions may best be accomplished by the use of " conceptual " individuals lo - cated at variors , but systematic , points in the person space . Table 4 presents results for seven conceptual individuals . The points for these conceptual individuals are indicated on the dimension plots of Figure 3 by open circles . The first conceptual individual is lo - cated at a point having a unit coordinate on the first person dimension and a zero coordinate on each of the other three dimensions . This conceptual individual may be thought of as representing the general dimension among the individuals . The weights used by this individual for the three dimensions of the object space are all unity . Dimensions A and 13 are almost orthogonal while dimension C has nega - tive cosincs of angles with the other two object dimensions . Thus , the self - ccnscious dimension is considered to be related to weakness ( the negative of strength ) and to excitability ( the negative of calm - ness ) . Conceptual individuals 2 + and 2 - have unit coordinates on 25 dimension 1 but are contrasted by positive and negative coordinates on dimension 2 of the person space . The comparison of these two conceptual individuals indicates a small change in the weight for object dimension A , a larger change in the weight given dimension B , and no change in the weight for dimension C . Major contrasts occur , however , in the cosines of the angles between the dimensions of the object space . Conceptual individuals 3 + and 3 - present a contrast associated with the third dimension in the person space . Conceptual individual 3 + gives higher weights to all three di - mensions , which indicates that he gave , , ore extreme ratings , while keeping the three dimensions of the object space nearly orthogonal . Conceptual individual 3 - , in contrast , gave lower weights to all three dimensions and used the dimensions of the object apace as quite oblique , especially dimensions A and C for which the cosine of the angle was - . 90 . Thus , for this conceptual individual , the self - conscious dimension was almost opposite to the strength dimension . Conceptual individuals 4 + and 4 - present a contrast associated with the fourth dimension in the person space . The main effect of this dimension in the person space is a change in the weight given to dimension C of the object space plus some change in the weight given to dimension A . The p . - eceding eovparisons of conceptual individuals indicate that different locations in the person space are associated with both the changes in weights given to the object space dimensions and changes in the angles between the object space dimensions . The Adjective Similarity Study illustrated one method of analysis . Other methods are possible for developing the standard form matrices B Z , and G . There are other procedures possible , also , for 26 developing the transformations , One possibility that may be appropriate for some studies is to make the core matrix as simple as possible . A point of special note is that , if every matrix GV can be made diagonal , all matrices HI must be diagonal and the variation from individual to individual would occur only in var - iation in the weights applied to the several transformed object dimensions . This would correspond to the model utilized by Horan ( 1969 ) and by Carroll and Chang ( 1969 ) . When not every matrix 0 : 0 ; 1 can be made diagonal the differences between individuals will in - volve changes in the angles between the dimensions of the object space as well as possible changes in the weights for the object space dimensions . The present model allows for each of these cases . 27 REFERENCES Carroll , J , Douglas , and Chang , J . J . A new method for dealing with individual differences in multidimensional scaling . .
