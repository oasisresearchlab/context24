The 12 regulatory network governing lamellipodial and lamellar actin structures is prototypical of such a system , 13 containing tens of actin - nucleating and - modulating molecules with functional overlap and feedback loops . Due 14 to instantaneous and long - term compensation , phenotyping the system response to perturbation provides 15 limited information on the roles the targeted component plays in the unperturbed system . Accordingly , how 16 individual actin regulators contribute to lamellipodial dynamics remains ambiguous . Here , we present a 17 perturbation - free reconstruction of cause - effect relations among actin regulators by applying Granger - causal 18 inference to constitutive image fluctuations that indicate regulator recruitment as a proxy for activity . Our 19 analysis identifies distinct zones of actin regulator activation and of causal effects on filament assembly and 20 delineates actin - dependent and actin - independent regulator roles in controlling edge motion . We propose that 21 edge motion is driven by assembly of two independently operating actin filament systems . A record of this 22 paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information . 23 24 Introduction 25 Many cell functions are regulated by biochemical and biophysical circuits with component redundancy , 26 as well as feed - back and feed - forward interactions . A prototypical case of such a circuit is the machinery 27 driving the formation of lamellipodia and lamella filamentous actin ( F - actin ) networks ( Insall and Machesky , 28 2009 , Isogai and Danuser , 2018 ) . The dynamics of network assembly is controlled by dozens of actin - binding 29 proteins with distinct structural and kinetic properties ( Figure 1A ) ( Krause and Gautreau , 2014 , Blanchoin et al . , 30 2014 , Insall and Machesky , 2009 , Pollard , 2016 , Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . The complexity in architectural dynamics 31 is superimposed by complexity in biochemical signals , which orchestrate filament branching by the Arp2 / 3 32 complex , filament elongation by formins and Ena / VASP proteins , filament capping by Capping Protein ( CP ) , 33 and filament severing by ADF / cofilin proteins ( not depicted ) in response to cell - intrinsic and - extrinsic 34 mechanical and chemical cues ( Figure 1A ) . Although genetic and molecular perturbation has been 35 instrumental in compiling an inventory of these system components and their basic contributions to 36 lamellipodia formation , the functional hierarchy among the components has yet to be defined . In a system with 37 3 so many functionally overlapping elements , perturbation of any one of them or any regulator upstream results 38 almost instantaneously in a rewiring of the circuitry ( Isogai and Danuser , 2018 ) . 39 In the face of redundancy and nonlinearity , phenotypes induced by experimental perturbation are in a 40 strict sense uninterpretable with respect to the role the targeted component plays in the unperturbed system 41 ( Vilela and Danuser , 2011 , Welf and Danuser , 2014 ) . Phenotypes show how the system adapts to the 42 intervention , which is unequal to the function the targeted component assumes in the intact system ( Figure 43 1B ) . For example , the linear F - actin nucleator formin mDia1 , the branched actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 and the 44 filament elongator VASP collectively contribute to the formation of actin networks , which in turn drives 45 membrane protrusion ( Insall and Machesky , 2009 , Krause and Gautreau , 2014 , Blanchoin et al . , 2014 , Pollard 46 et al . , 2000 , Goode and Eck , 2007 , Krause et al . , 2003 , Courtemanche , 2018 ) . Perturbation of mDia1 will affect 47 the actin network and subsequent membrane protrusion , but the phenotype , if observable , is confounded by 48 altered activation of Arp2 / 3 and VASP ( Figure 1C ) . Of note , the disconnect between phenotype and 49 component function is intrinsic to the circuit wiring and does not relate to the widely - discussed additional 50 complication of cellular adaptation to long - term perturbation ( Hoeller et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , feedback relations 51 often escape conventional perturbation approaches . For example , Arp2 / 3 and F - actin are in a forward relation 52 Arp2 / 3 → F - actin ( Figure 1D ( 1 ) ) , but based on extensive biochemical experimentation there may be also a 53 positive feedback F - actin → Arp2 / 3 ( Figure 1D ( 2 ) ) ( Mueller et al . , 2017 , Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . How important is 54 this feedback eventually for the growth of the branched lamellipodial actin network ? Answering this question is 55 non - trivial and gets more complicated when considering the concurrent contributions of additional factors such 56 as VASP . VASP accelerates elongation of pre - formed filaments . Will the elongated filaments recruit more 57 Arp2 / 3 and in turn more F - actin nucleation ( Figure 1E ( 3 ) ) ? And will the newly nucleated F - actin serve as an 58 additional substrate for VASP ( Figure 1E ( 4 ) ) ? To dissect circuitry of such complexity the field needs novel 59 approaches that overcome the limitations of probing by perturbation . 60 Several studies of actin regulation during cell protrusion and retraction have exploited live cell 61 fluorescence time - lapse imaging and computer vision as an observational approach to infer the underlying 62 molecular pathway structure without experimental intervention ( Mueller et al . , 2017 , Bisaria et al . , 2020 , 63 Barnhart et al . , 2017 , Lee et al . , 2015 , Welf and Danuser , 2014 , Isogai and Danuser , 2018 , Ji et al . , 2008 ) . 64 4 Fluorescence intensity fluctuations reporting the recruitment of actin modulators to the F - actin network as a 65 surrogate of their activity were extracted from live cell movies . Fluctuation time series were then exploited to 66 establish the correlation between molecular and morphological activities , assuming that the numerical coupling 67 of the two is an indicator of local functional relations ( Ponti et al . , 2004 , Lee et al . , 2015 , Ji et al . , 2008 , 68 Mendoza et al . , 2015 , Mueller et al . , 2017 , Wang et al . , 2018 , Bisaria et al . , 2020 ) . This paradigm has also 69 been applied to the analysis of regulatory signals upstream of actin dynamics ( Machacek et al . , 2009 , Azoitei 70 et al . , 2019 , Yang et al . , 2016 , Marston et al . , 2020 ) . However , these analyses do not inform on the causal 71 relation between activities , especially not in the face of feedback relations . 72 Given a set of temporally resolved variables , the hierarchy of cause - and - effect relations can be inferred 73 by statistical assessment of the power of the signal of a putative cause for the prediction of the signal of a 74 putative effector . This notion of inferring causality has long been employed in econometrics and 75 neurophysiology ( Granger , 1969 , Bressler and Seth , 2011 ) . The most popular of these frameworks is the 76 Granger - causality ( GC ) analysis , which defines a statistical test of the hypothesis that past observations of one 77 variable possess indispensable information for explaining the current and future observations of a second 78 variable ( Eichler , 2013 ) . Because of the explicit temporal direction in the relationships , the GC framework also 79 permits analysis of nonlinear regulatory motifs such as feedback , redundant pathways , and even nested 80 feedbacks . 81 Granger - causal ( G - causal ) relations must be interpreted only within the system of co - observed 82 variables . For example , if the observed signal of a variable X is causative for an unobserved latent factor that is 83 causative for the observed signal of a variable Y , then X will be determined as G - causal for Y . While in many 84 biological studies , knowledge of such indirect relations can yield great insight for practical purposes , the 85 prediction of a G - causal relation is not to be mistaken for a causality that pinpoints direct molecular 86 interactions . Accordingly , we refer to G - causal relations as indicators of functional causality . In contrast , the 87 prediction of Granger - noncausality has the strong implication that the two considered variables are 88 independent , regardless of any latent factor . This property permits the exclusion of functional relations at the 89 level of the whole system based on a partially observed system ( Eichler , 2007 ) . 90 5 In this work , we illustrate the potential of GC analysis in overcoming the challenges of deciphering the 91 molecularly entangled regulation of lamellipodial F - actin assembly . Using multivariate time - series representing 92 the spatiotemporal molecular and cell morphological dynamics of the system , we build generative stochastic 93 models that capture the causal structure of the system . Our GC analytical pipeline , for example , shows that 94 actin dynamics at the most proximal zone , i . e . ~ 0 – 0 . 7 µm from the cell edge , Granger - causes ( G - causes ) edge 95 motion , while actin more distal from the cell edge ( zones ~ 0 . 7 – 1 . 4 µm ) is predicted as Granger - noncausal ( G - 96 noncausal ) for edge motion . Notably , this latter zone showed a strong positive correlation between F - actin 97 dynamics and edge motion , demonstrating that GC analysis is distinct from correlation analysis : Correlation is 98 not causation . We further applied the GC pipeline to identify the causal relations between actin modulators and 99 F - actin dynamics . For Arp2 / 3 and VASP , for example , our analysis determines that both modulators G - cause 100 edge motion yet operate independently from each other – a conclusion that has been inaccessible by 101 conventional perturbation and correlation - dependent approaches . 102 103 Results 104 Extraction of image fluctuation time series of actin regulator recruitment suitable for Granger - causality 105 analysis 106 To study G - causal relations among actin regulators , F - actin assembly and lamellipodia dynamics , we 107 acquired fluorescence time - lapse images of cells expressing either endogenously tagged or low concentration 108 of tagged ectopic regulator protein , so as to not perturb the endogenous stoichiometry among regulators . By 109 ensuring low expression of the labelled regulator ( see Methods ) , local changes in fluorescence intensity largely 110 reflect the association of the regulator with F - actin ( Danuser and Waterman - Storer , 2006 ) . We illustrate the 111 time series extraction based on the example of U2OS cells co - expressing Arp3 labelled with CRISPR / Cas9 - 112 edited C - terminal HaloTag ( Halo ) and mNeonGreen - tagged actin under a truncated CMV promoter . Cycles of 113 edge protrusion and retraction events were sampled every 3 seconds for 15 minutes ( Figure 1F ) . Visual 114 inspection of these cycles in conjunction with F - actin dynamics and Arp3 recruitment revealed the well - 115 established characteristics of a lamellipodium with actin retrograde treadmilling at the cell front ( ~ 1 . 5 µm from 116 6 the edge ) and a lamella with slower and spatially less coherent actin dynamics beneath ( > 1 . 5 µm from the 117 edge ) ( Ponti et al . , 2004 ) ( Video S1 ) . 118 To record fluctuation time series of edge motion and cytoskeletal dynamics , we partitioned the 119 protruding and retracting front of the cell into submicron - scale probing windows ( Figure 1G ) , and tracked their 120 positions over time so that they maintained a constant relation with an edge sector of the same submicron 121 scale , as described previously ( Ma et al . , 2018 , Machacek et al . , 2009 ) . This generates a coordinate system 122 that allows simultaneous registration of spatiotemporal fluorescent intensity fluctuations and cell edge 123 protrusion / retraction dynamics ( Video S2 - S3 ) . The size of the probing windows was fine - tuned to be several - 124 fold smaller than the average length scale of protrusion and retraction events , and small enough to capture the 125 distinct cytoskeleton dynamics in lamellipodium and lamella . Specifically , the lamellipodia depth in U2OS cells 126 measured 1 . 4 µm , on average . Thus , for our spatial analyses , we defined the lamellipodia region as the band 127 ~ 0 – 1 . 4 µm from the cell edge and the lamella region as the band ~ 1 . 4 – 2 . 9 µm from the cell edge . We further 128 divided these regions into half to examine potential spatial gradients in Arp2 / 3 and actin activities within each 129 region . For each probing window we then read out time series of locally averaged Arp2 / 3 and actin intensities 130 and mapped them into space - time matrices ( Figure 1H ; see Methods ) . For the window row at the cell front , we 131 also read out the average velocity , with positive and negative values indicating protrusion and retraction , 132 respectively . Of note , any probing window in layer 2 and higher is unambiguously associated with one probing 133 window in layer 1 . This permits the analysis of causal relations between different types of events , for example , 134 Arp2 / 3 and velocity , or Arp2 / 3 and another actin regulator , in the same or different window layers . 135 136 Workflow of Granger - causal pathway inference between regulators of lamellipodial actin dynamics 137 To illustrate the inference of G - causal relations we focus on the questions ‘how causal’ is Arp2 / 3 138 recruitment to a particular target window for the assembly of actin in the same window , and ‘how causal’ is the 139 assembly for cell edge motion at that location . Common expectation in the field would suggest the existence of 140 a causal chain Arp2 / 3 → F - actin → motion . Thus , we can use the data in Figure 1H to validate the basic 141 application of GC - analysis for this system . However , even with these extremely well - studied relations , it is 142 7 unknown at what distance from the cell edge they may break and whether there is feedback from F - actin to 143 Arp2 / 3 recruitment ( Figure 1D ) . Both questions can be uniquely addressed by GC - analysis . 144 Per Granger’s definition ( Granger , 1969 ) , Arp2 / 3 recruitment is G - causal for F - actin , if the best 145 prediction of the F - actin assembly time series using ‘all available information’ , including the Arp2 / 3 recruitment , 146 is significantly better than the best prediction of F - actin assembly using all information except the Arp2 / 3 147 recruitment . Hence , in a particular target window we need to assess whether knowledge of the Arp2 / 3 148 recruitment supports the prediction of F - actin assembly in the same window . The F - actin assembly time series 149 in the target window may further be influenced by the Arp2 / 3 and F - actin recruitment in the neighboring probing 150 windows . Indeed , the high level of similarity between fluctuation time series in windows surrounding the target 151 window suggest a strong biochemical coupling of the actin regulatory process in space ( Figure 2A ) . To 152 determine the G - causal relation between Arp2 / 3 and F - actin in the target window , contributions from time 153 series in the surrounding windows must be considered as confounding factors . The model also accounts for 154 the protrusion / retraction ( P / R ) velocities as potential confounders , i . e . the analysis considers whether Arp2 / 3 155 and F - actin co - fluctuate simply because they jointly follow the edge movements . Taken together , the 156 indispensability of Arp2 / 3 recruitment for the prediction of F - actin assembly at a given location is tested by 157 comparing two models ( Figure 2B , see Methods ) : ( 1 ) the full model incorporating fluctuation time series of 158 Arp2 / 3 , F - actin and associated edge motion in the target window and the four neighboring windows ( Methods 159 Eq . 2 ) , and ( 2 ) the reduced model equivalent to the full model minus the Arp2 / 3 fluctuation time series in the 160 target window . If Arp2 / 3 is an indispensable variable , the full model will lead to a significantly better prediction 161 performance than the reduced model . Because of the additional degrees of freedom , the full model will always 162 perform better than the reduced model , as assessed by the variance of the difference between predicted and 163 measured F - actin fluctuations . The key question is whether the additional degrees of freedom significantly 164 improve the prediction . This is answered by application of a Fisher test under the null - hypothesis that the full 165 and reduced models are equally strong predictors ( Methods Eq . 3 ) . In the context of Figure 2 , low P - values , 166 therefore , indicate a causal link from Arp2 / 3 recruitment to F - actin assembly . 167 G - causal links describe direct interactions between the observed variables . For example , in a pathway 168 A → B → C A is referred to as directly causal for B , and indirectly causal for C . Hence , the G - causal link from 169 8 Arp2 / 3 recruitment to F - actin assembly cannot be mediated by edge motion . If the pathway were to consist of a 170 chain Arp2 / 3 → edge motion → actin , then edge motion would have accounted for F - actin assembly in the full 171 and reduced models , rendering Arp2 / 3 dispensable for the prediction . 172 To draw firm and reproducible conclusions on the causality between variables , we integrated the 173 subcellular P - values of the GC tests over multiple , independently imaged cells . From a statistical perspective , 174 the sampling unit , i . e . the physical entity that is repeatedly and independently measured in our imaging 175 experiments , is one cell . Because a statistical conclusion is a statement on the representative property of a 176 population of sampling units , hypotheses on causal relations need to be tested based on per - cell observations . 177 To accomplish this , we computed the median of P - values of GC evidences over the probing windows of a cell 178 as the per - cell observation of causality . A per - cell median P - value of less than 0 . 05 indicates that the majority 179 of probing windows in the cell show G - causal interactions between the investigated variables ( Figure 2C ) . 180 Subsequently , we apply the Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine whether the per - cell median P - values of n 181 cells are less than 0 . 05 , in which case the two investigated variables are considered as causally connected 182 ( Figure 2D ) . 183 After completing the pairwise testing of G - causal relationships between all variables in the observed 184 system , causal relations are integrated and represented as a graph ( Sugiyama et al . , 1981 ) ( Figure 2E ) . To 185 account for spatial variation in causal interactions , we compute graphs separately for lamellipodia and lamella 186 ( in our U2OS cell model : 0 – 0 . 7 µm and 0 . 7 – 1 . 4 µm vs 1 . 4 – 2 . 2 µm and 2 . 2 – 2 . 9 µm , respectively ) . For the 187 example of Arp2 / 3 , F - actin , and edge velocity , the graphs indicate a causal interaction between Arp2 / 3 and 188 actin , as expected ( Pollard et al . , 2000 , Isogai et al . , 2015 , Goley and Welch , 2006 , Blanchoin et al . , 2000a ) , as 189 well as a feedback from F - actin to Arp2 / 3 , demonstrated for the first time in living cells . This feedback may be 190 explained by the intrinsic recruitment dynamics of the dendritic polymer network , in which the nucleation of 191 branches yields additional filaments that in turn can be branched again . Our analysis further shows that actin is 192 in a causal feedback relation with edge velocity , however only for the probing windows in layer 0 – 0 . 7 µm . The 193 forward link from actin to edge motion describes the well - established conversion of actin filament growth into 194 mechanical push of the cell edge through mechanisms such as the Brownian Ratchet ( Mogilner and Oster , 195 1996 ) . The feedback from edge motion to F - actin assembly may be governed by several mechanisms 196 9 including mechanical and chemical force - feedback from the increasing membrane tension or membrane 197 deformation ( Mueller et al . , 2017 , Higashida et al . , 2013 , Batchelder et al . , 2011 , Bieling et al . , 2016 , Lou et al . , 198 2019 ) . Importantly , the graphs indicate that there is no direct causal interaction between Arp2 / 3 and velocity . 199 This means that any modulation in Arp2 / 3 recruitment translates into modulation of edge velocity only via F - 200 actin dynamics . The absence of a causal link from velocity to Arp2 / 3 implies that the predicted feedback from 201 edge motion to actin in layer 0 – 0 . 7 µm is independent of Arp2 / 3 , i . e . signals must exist that translate the 202 morphological dynamics or variation in membrane tension into actin nucleators other than Arp2 / 3 . Hence , this 203 data refutes the proposal that the bending of actin filaments under plasma membrane load contributes 204 significantly to Arp2 / 3 recruitment ( Risca et al . , 2012 ) . These first results demonstrate how Granger - causality 205 analyses functionally relate molecular processes in a hierarchical and nonlinear order . 206 207 Actin and Arp2 / 3 fluctuations cross - correlate with edge velocity , but so do fluctuations of a cytosolic 208 tag 209 We also present the cross - correlations ( CCs ) between Arp2 / 3 , F - actin , and edge velocity . For both CC - 210 and GC - analyses it is essential that the time scales of variable fluctuations match . A straightforward approach 211 to determine the time scale of stochastic time series relies on the auto - correlation function ( ACF ) , which for 212 protrusion and retraction projects average cycles of ~ 60 s but cycles of > 4 min for F - actin and Arp2 / 3 213 recruitment ( Figure 3A ) . 214 Since Arp2 / 3 and F - actin dynamics are known to be related to protrusion and retraction dynamics 215 ( Pollard et al . , 2000 , Krause and Gautreau , 2014 ) , we hypothesized that the overall F - actin and Arp2 / 3 216 fluctuation signals contained shorter time scale fluctuations that would align with that of edge motion cycles 217 whereas the dominant cycles at longer time scales are unrelated to cell morphodynamics . To test this , we 218 decomposed the raw time series of F - actin and Arp2 / 3 recruitment into low - frequency ( LF ) oscillations and low - 219 frequency subtracted ( LFS ) oscillations ( Figures 3B - 3E , see Methods ) . Indeed , the ACFs of the LFS signals 220 closely matched the ACF of edge velocities ( Figures 3F and 3G , Video S4 ) . Hereafter , we refer to LFS - 221 molecular activity without specifying the LFS for brevity . 222 10 We computed the cross - correlation ( CC ) between LFS - actin or - Arp2 / 3 and edge velocity in each 223 window as previously described ( Machacek et al . , 2009 ) . Within the lamellipodia ( layers 1 and 2 ; ~ 0 – 1 . 4 µm ) , 224 the fluctuations of F - actin assembly best correlated with the edge velocity with a time delay of ~ 9 s ( Figure 3H ) , 225 which is in line with previous reports ( Ji et al . , 2008 , Lee et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , Arp2 / 3 fluctuations preceded 226 edge velocity fluctuations by ~ 3 s in layer 1 , whereas in layer 2 , Arp2 / 3 followed the edge velocity by ~ 6 s 227 ( Figure 3I ) . 228 Our correlation and GC - analyses operate under the assumption that intensity fluctuations in F - actin and 229 Arp2 / 3 faithfully report the addition or removal of actin subunits and Arp2 / 3 complexes to or from the 230 lamellipodial network . To test the validity of this assumption , we performed correlation analyses with images of 231 diffuse HaloTag alone . The CC curves between cytoplasmic HaloTag intensities and edge velocity consistently 232 showed positive correlation values at negative time lags and negative correlations at positive time - lags ( Figure 233 S1A ) . To explain the mechanism underlying the positive and negative lobes we turned to kinetic maps , which 234 indicate the average accumulation of a fluorescent signal relative to a morphodynamic event such as 235 protrusion or retraction onset ( Azoitei et al . , 2019 , Lee et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure S1B ) . The typical fluorescence 236 intensities of the cytoplasmic HaloTag reached its highest values after the fastest retraction , which explains the 237 negative correlations between the HaloTag and edge velocity at positive time - lags . This peak of the HaloTag 238 mean intensity was still observable before the fastest protrusion , which was captured by the positive 239 correlations at negative time - lags . These fluctuation patterns of cytoplasmic HaloTag depicted systematic 240 volume changes near the edge during P / R cycles , where the volume was maximized right before the protrusion 241 onset and minimized at or right before the retraction onset as the cell edge maximally stretched out . 242 The CC pattern of a diffuse , cytoplasmic HaloTag with edge velocity resembled the CC patterns of both 243 actin and Arp2 / 3 with edge velocity in the most distal region we analyzed ( layer 4 ; 2 . 2 – 2 . 9 µm ) ( Figures 3H 244 and 3I ) . This suggests that in the lamella , the LFS F - actin and Arp2 / 3 signals reflect a fraction of fluorescent 245 probes that are diffusing in contrast to the relatively static cytoskeleton structures such as cortical actin fibers , 246 whose fluorescence fluctuations are captured by the LF baseline recruitment signal . The CC patterns of F - actin 247 and Arp2 / 3 recruitments with edge velocity in the transitional region 1 . 4 – 2 . 2 µm ( layer 3 ) exhibited a mixture of 248 the lamellipodial and cytoplasmic CC curves . This shows that the CC curves of F - actin and Arp2 / 3 differentiate 249 11 two distinct cytoskeleton behaviors in lamellipodium and lamella , and that the lamellipodium - to - lamella 250 transition in U2OS cells locates in the 1 . 4 – 2 . 2 µm region . 251 252 Beyond correlation – a generative stochastic model to capture spatial information flows 253 Since cytoplasmic signals still correlated with edge velocity , correlations alone are insufficient to identify 254 causal relations among the molecules involved in lamellipodial dynamics . To accomplish causal inference , we 255 had to formulate a generative , stochastic model that specifies the dependencies of the edge velocities on 256 molecular activities in subcellular space and time . Towards such a model , we first assembled a spatially 257 propagating autoregressive ( SPAR ) model that prescribes the propagation of molecular activities in a target 258 window to four adjacent windows ( Figure S1C , see Methods ) . Analysis of actin dynamics by the SPAR model 259 detected the propagation of F - actin signal fluctuations in retrograde direction in regions with prominent actin 260 retrograde flow , as expected ( Figure 4A , Video S5 ) . It also predicted that actin fluctuations propagate laterally 261 throughout the entire lamellipodia . In contrast , per the SPAR model fluctuations in the cytoplasmic HaloTag 262 signal did not spatially propagate in most lamellipodia / lamella regions ( Figure 4B , Video S6 ) . This illustrates 263 the capacity of SPAR analysis to differentiate between spatiotemporally propagated and non - propagated 264 molecular activities . 265 266 GC analysis identifies a causal chain from Arp2 / 3 to F - actin to edge velocity at the lamellipodia front 267 We extended the SPAR model to capture the relations between two spatiotemporally coupled 268 molecular activities and edge velocity ( Figure 2B ) . Applied to the analysis of lamellipodia dynamics , we first 269 tested the causal effect of Arp2 / 3 recruitment on F - actin assembly at each subcellular probing window in the 270 cell shown in Figure 1F . Most windows in the lamellipodia region ( layers 1 and 2 ; ~ 0 – 1 . 4 µm ) displayed 271 significant GC P - values , whereas the Arp2 / 3 did not G - cause actin fluctuation in the majority of windows 272 outside the lamellipodia ( layers 3 ; ~ 1 . 4 – 2 . 2 µm ) ( Figures 4C and S2A ) . As one would expect , F - actin 273 fluctuations at the lamellipodia front ( layer 1 ) had G - causal effects on edge motion , with almost all probing 274 windows showing P - values < 0 . 0001 ( Figure 4D ) . The G - causal effect sharply dropped to a median P - value of 275 0 . 032 over all windows at the lamellipodia base ( layer 2 , Figure S2B ) . Beyond the lamellipodium , F - actin 276 12 fluctuations stayed G - noncausal for edge velocity in most windows ( median P - values 0 . 419 and 0 . 571 over all 277 windows in layers 3 and 4 , respectively ; Figure 4D and not shown ) . For the remaining combinations of pairwise 278 relations between F - actin , Arp2 / 3 and edge velocity , we found distinct subcellular patterns of causality 279 reflecting the fine - grained spatial regulation of the lamellipodial and lamellar actin machinery ( Video S7 - S12 ) . 280 Together , these analyses demonstrate the high spatial resolution of the SPAR models in delineating spatial 281 zones of distinct causal hierarchy among subcellular events . 282 We then examined whether the patterns of G - causal relations identified in a single cell were 283 reproducible in cells imaged over independent experimental sessions ( Figure 4E ) . Applied to a population of n 284 = 20 cells , these statistical analyses confirmed a causal relation from Arp2 / 3 to F - actin assembly in layers 1 285 and 2 ( ~ 0 – 1 . 4 µm ) , as expected . Our data also identified that F - actin assembly G - causes Arp2 / 3 recruitment 286 ( rank test P - values < 0 . 001 ) , confirming the proposal of an autocatalytic dendritic nucleation put forward in 287 Figure 1D as one of the hypotheses difficult to be tested by intervention approaches ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 , 288 Blanchoin et al . , 2000b , Carlsson , 2003 , Isogai et al . , 2015 ) . Both forward and feedback causal relations 289 between Arp2 / 3 and F - actin were insignificant in layers 3 and 4 ( rank test P - values > 0 . 522 , Figure 4E ) , 290 demonstrating that Arp2 / 3 - actin interactions as they relate to P / R cycles are confined to the lamellipodia area . 291 Similarly , the analysis of median P - values in cell cohorts supported a strong G - causal relation from F - actin to 292 edge motion in layer 1 ( rank test P = 0 . 001 , Figure 4E ) , but no significant relation deeper into the lamellipodia 293 ( rank test P = 0 . 935 ; Figure 4E ) . 294 A critical insight gained from a SPAR model that combines Arp2 / 3 , F - actin , and edge motion is that 295 Arp2 / 3 recruitment at the lamellipodia front is G - noncausal for edge velocity ( rank test P = 0 . 135 , Figure 4E ) , 296 consistent with a causal cascade Arp2 / 3 → F - actin → edge velocity . Hence , any causal effect from Arp2 / 3 297 recruitment to edge motion is fully mediated by F - actin assembly . Indeed , when we excluded the F - actin data 298 from the SPAR model , the GC pipeline predicted a strong G - causal relation from Arp2 / 3 to edge velocity in 299 layer 1 ( rank test P < 0 . 001 ) , but not in layer 2 ( rank test P = 0 . 977 , Figures S2C - S2E ) . This shows that the 300 mechanism of GC inference distinguishes direct from indirect causal effects among the observed components 301 of a molecular system . 302 13 The change in GC topology between the two - and three - component systems ( Figures S2F - S2H and 303 4E ) also rules out the possibility that any other variable besides F - actin mediates the causal effect of Arp2 / 3 on 304 edge velocity . If such a hidden mediator were to exist , then the GC analysis in the three - component model 305 would predict an additional G - causal relation from Arp2 / 3 to edge velocity bypassing F - actin . 306 To further validate the specificity of GC inference , we applied the pipeline to an inert HaloTag 307 cytoplasmic control data ( n = 12 cells ) . As expected , the analysis determined that cytoplasmic HaloTag 308 fluctuation is G - noncausal for F - actin assembly or edge velocity ( Figure S3 , rank test P - values > 0 . 633 ) , 309 although the fluctuations correlate with edge motion quite strongly ( Figure S1A ) . This again underlines the 310 ability of the presented pipeline to separate causal from correlative relations . 311 312 mDia1 recruitment G - causes F - actin assembly at the lamellipodia base and in the lamella and plays an 313 actin - independent role at the lamellipodia front 314 Using the GC pipeline we set out to determine where other actin nucleators and modulators affect actin 315 assembly and cell edge protrusion / retraction . We started with the formin family member mDia1 . Formins are 316 known to bind to the barbed - ends and processively elongate linear actin filaments ( Pollard , 2016 , 317 Courtemanche , 2018 ) . We stably depleted endogenous mDia1 in U2OS cells using lentiviral short hairpin RNA 318 and introduced exogenous SNAP - tagged mDia1 and mNeonGreen - tagged actin under a truncated CMV 319 promoter to follow their dynamics . Live cell movies displayed dynamic recruitment of mDia1 near the cell edge 320 along with the edge protrusion / retraction cycles ( Figure S4A , Video S13 ) . We found no G - causal interactions of 321 mDia1 with either actin or edge motion ( Figures S4B and S4C ) , which seemed to contradict previous reports in 322 other cell types of mDia1 functioning as the initiator of actin assembly and protrusion ( Isogai et al . , 2015 , Lee 323 et al . , 2015 ) . We suspected that the level of overexpression of mDia1 ( Figure 5A ) , albeit experimentally 324 controlled as much as possible , resulted in a significant perturbation of the stoichiometry among the 325 nucleators , masking mDia1’s proper function . We thus inserted by CRISPR / Cas9 a SNAP - tag before mDia1’s 326 N - terminal sequence but found the resulting fluorescence movies to have too low signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) 327 for a meaningful causality analysis ( data not shown ) . To overcome the deficiency in SNR , we decided to 328 14 endogenously tag mDia1 with a tandem mNeonGreen2 - based split fluorescence protein ( sFP ) strategy 329 ( Kamiyama et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 5B ) , which primarily suppresses background , yet also amplifies the signal . 330 Live cell movies of endogenous mDia1 displayed multiple spots of dynamic recruitment a few microns 331 back from the cell edge , which were unobservable with exogenous expression of tagged mDia1 ( Figure 5C ) . 332 The spots co - localized with spots enriched for actin and they appeared to be associated with strongly 333 protruding cell edge segments ( Video S14 ) . 334 Using CC analysis , we found that , unlike F - actin and Arp2 / 3 , mDia1 recruitment and edge velocity 335 correlated homogenously across the lamellipodia and lamella . The CC curves over multiple cells ( n = 14 ) 336 consistently showed maximal negative values at positive lags of ~ 3 - 9 s ( Figure S4D ) . Kinetic maps indicated 337 that this negative peak was associated with mDia1 recruitment after maximal retraction and before protrusion 338 onset ( Figure S4E ) , consistent with previous observations ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) . 339 To determine how much mDia1 recruitment causes actin assembly and edge motion , we applied the 340 GC pathway inference pipeline to mDia1 / actin live cell movies . On a per - cell basis , most windows at the 341 lamellipodia base and in the lamella ( ~ 0 . 7 – 2 . 9 µm ) showed significant G - causal effects of mDia1 on F - actin 342 recruitment ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . For the entire cell population ( n = 14 ) , the analysis determined causal 343 influence of mDia1 on F - actin assembly at the lamellipodia base and lamella ( ~ 0 . 7 – 2 . 9 µm , rank test 344 P < 0 . 012 , Figure 5E ) , but not at the lamellipodia front ( 0 – 0 . 7 µm , rank test P = 0 . 452 ) . The observed G - causal 345 feedback between actin on mDia1 ( rank test P < 0 . 010 , Figure 5E ) , may represent mDia1’s activity to recruit 346 profilin - bound actin for F - actin nucleation and elongation . 347 Our analysis further identified a direct G - causal relation between mDia1 and edge velocity at the cell 348 edge , where mDia1 is G - noncausal for F - actin assembly ( 0 – 0 . 7 µm , rank test P = 0 . 008 and P = 0 . 452 , 349 respectively , Figure 5E ) . This suggests that mDia1 performs a function related to edge dynamics that is 350 independent of F - actin assembly such as inhibiting barbed - end capping proteins ( Shekhar et al . , 2015 ) or 351 regulating microtubules and cell - matrix adhesions ( Ishizaki et al . , 2001 , Yamana et al . , 2006 ) . 352 In summary , these GC analyses unveil a dual role of mDia1 in distinct spatial locations , one as a direct 353 F - actin assembly factor at the base of the lamellipodia , and another as an indirect modulator of edge motion 354 through actin - independent functions . 355 15 356 GC analysis detects causal shifts between wild - type and mutant of VASP deficient in actin assembly 357 Lamellipodial and lamellar F - actin assembly is regulated by numerous additional factors that are fine - 358 tuning edge motion . In particular , the elongation factor VASP localizes to the tip of lamellipodia and accelerates 359 elongation of actin filaments ( Bear and Gertler , 2009 ) . We took advantage of the vast biochemical knowledge 360 of VASP - actin interactions to test whether our GC analysis has the sensitivity to detect subtle shifts in F - actin 361 assembly and cell edge movement as a consequence of genetic mutations in VASP . 362 We co - imaged actin with SNAP - tagged wild - type VASP ( VASP WT ) and Halo - tagged S239D / T278E 363 mutant VASP ( VASP MT ) in a VASP knock - down cell line ( Figure S6A ) . VASP MT has previously been described 364 to maintain proper membrane localization , however with attenuated actin polymerization activity ( Benz et al . , 365 2009 ) . In our U2OS cells , VASP WT localized to a narrow band at the very tip of the lamellipodia ( Figure 6A , 366 Video S15 ) . At large , this localization pattern applied also to VASP MT , but VASP WT shifted towards the tip of the 367 cell edge ( Figure 6A ) . By CC analysis , we found that fluctuations in VASP WT recruitment preceded edge 368 protrusions by ~ 3 s at the very front but were decoupled from edge motion in layers 2 - 4 ( Figure 6B , only layers 369 1 and 2 are shown ) . The same spatiotemporal pattern arose for VASP MT recruitment ( Figure 6B ) , although the 370 CC peak in layer 1 was reduced compared to VASP WT . 371 GC analysis identified marked differences between VASP WT and VASP MT . Shown for a representative 372 cell , VASP WT recruitment G - causes F - actin assembly in most windows at the lamellipodia front ( Figure 6C , 373 median P - value 0 . 047 ) whereas VASP MT recruitment was G - noncausal ( median P - value 0 . 152 ) . The 374 differences were consistent over a cell population imaged over multiple independent experimental sessions ( n 375 = 18 ) . VASP WT was G - causal for F - actin assembly at the lamellipodia front ( rank test P = 0 . 025 ) , but VASP MT 376 was not ( rank test P = 0 . 831 , Figure 6D ) . This result shows the exquisite sensitivity of GC analysis in 377 pinpointing differences between molecular activities that are not detectable by CC analysis . 378 Unexpectedly , GC analysis also identified a direct causal relation from VASP WT to edge velocity , which 379 was independent of the measured F - actin dynamics ( rank test P < 0 . 001 , Figure 6D ) . VASP MT did not show this 380 direct causal link ( rank test P = 0 . 831 , Figure 6D ) , indicating that the strong correlation between VASP MT and 381 edge velocity in Figure 6B does not imply causation . 382 16 Next , we used GC analysis to test possible feedback from F - actin to VASP recruitment ( Figure 6E ) . 383 Contrary to the feedback between F - actin and Arp2 / 3 , which accompanies dendritic nucleation of actin 384 filaments throughout the entire lamellipodia , VASP and actin are in bidirectional G - causal relations only in the 385 most distal layer of the lamella ( ~ 2 . 3 – 2 . 9 µm , Figure 6F ) . We suspect that this relation is a numerical artifact of 386 the strong colocalization of VASP and F - actin at focal adhesions ( Krause et al . , 2003 ) ( Video S15 ) . 387 In summary , co - imaging of VASP WT and VASP MT first confirmed the biochemically characterized 388 deficiency of VASP’s S239D / T278E mutation in F - actin assembly in a living cell and unveiled direct causal 389 influence of VASP on edge motion . Notably , per our GC analysis , VASP - elongation of F - actin was confined to 390 the lamellipodia front , without any feedback from F - actin assembly . 391 392 Two discrete actin networks independently drive edge motion 393 Our GC pipeline delineated spatial zones in which Arp2 / 3 , mDia1 , and VASP assume differential G - 394 causal roles in assembling F - actin . We wondered whether these three actin regulators operate in parallel or 395 whether they are causally related among themselves . Specifically , we asked whether Arp2 / 3 and VASP 396 operate cooperatively , i . e . VASP elongates F - actin nucleated by Arp2 / 3 , or separately in differentially regulated 397 F - actin networks ( Winkelman et al . , 2014 , Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . In the cooperative case , Arp2 / 3 398 recruitment would be expected as indispensable for explaining VASP recruitment ( Figure 1E ( 3 ) ) . VASP - 399 mediated F - actin assembly may also promote Arp2 / 3 recruitment ( Figure 1E ( 4 ) ) , which would be reflected by a 400 G - causal relation from VASP to Arp2 / 3 . If Arp2 / 3 and VASP operated separately , our pipeline would report no 401 G - causal relations . 402 To test these hypotheses , we co - imaged U2OS cells ( n = 18 ) expressing SNAP - tagged exogenous 403 VASP and endogenous Halo - tagged Arp3 ( Figure 7A ) . For a representative cell , the GC tests at individual 404 target windows at the lamellipodia front indicated that neither one of the two actin regulators are causal for the 405 other ( Figure 7B , median P - values > 0 . 222 ) . The absence of such relations was further confirmed for 406 lamellipodia and lamella at the level of the entire cell population ( Figure S7A , rank test P > 0 . 204 ) . On the other 407 hand , VASP is identified as G - causal for edge motion , independent of Arp2 / 3 ( Figure S7A , rank test 408 P < 0 . 016 ) , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 and VASP operate in two distinct F - actin architectures , which synergistically 409 17 drive cell edge protrusion . In line with this prediction , GC pathway analysis indicated that Arp2 / 3 and VASP 410 contribute as separate F - actin assembly factors to cell edge protrusion ( Figure 7C ) . Importantly , this result 411 does not invalidate the earlier established linear causal chain from Arp2 / 3 → actin → edge motion ( Figure 2E ) . 412 In the data underlying Figure 7C , actin is not observed and thus Arp2 / 3 appears causal for edge motion . Of 413 note , the fluctuation signals of Arp2 / 3 and VASP correlated strongly with zero - time lag , which relates to their 414 concurrent recruitment during P / R cycles ( Figure S7B ) . However , co - recruitment does not mean coupled 415 function . This underlines again the marked difference between correlation and causation analysis . 416 417 Discussion 418 When perturbed , regulatory pathways containing feedbacks and redundancies tend to respond with 419 instantaneous adaptation . Thus , the ensuing phenotype is difficult to interpret in terms of the function the 420 targeted component assumes in the unperturbed pathway . To reconstruct cause - effect relations between 421 components of pathways , we adopt here the framework of Granger causality to live cell fluorescence imaging 422 of the unperturbed system . 423 We chose the lamellipodial and lamellar actin assembly pathways to present three classes of 424 experiments : i ) control experiments with known outcome , validating the technology per se ; ii ) experiments with 425 expected outcomes that were confirmed by GC analysis and thus raise confidence in the approach ; iii ) 426 experiments that led to insights inaccessible by conventional perturb - and - observe approaches . Among the 427 third class , our analyses define spatially segregated functions of mDia1 as an actin nucleator and as a 428 nucleation - independent modulator of actin dynamics ; and the existence of independently operating F - actin 429 structures under the regime of Arp2 / 3 and VASP . 430 Our pipeline distinguishes with high specificity and sensitivity causation from correlation and allows the 431 unmixing of functionally distinct molecular activities , which visually seem to be represented by identical 432 fluorescence image fluctuations . This feature is illustrated with a VASP mutant that is deficient in actin - 433 polymerization but localizes qualitatively identically to wildtype VASP at the lamellipodia edge . Our analysis 434 recognizes that the VASP mutant is G - noncausal for F - actin assembly and edge motion , although its 435 18 recruitment to the leading edge positively correlates with edge motion . We further identify that Arp2 / 3 , actin 436 and edge motion are in a linear causal chain , a finding in good agreement with the literature . Finally , our 437 analyses determine that different actin regulators cause F - actin assembly in distinct spatial domains within the 438 lamellipodia and lamella . Arp2 / 3 is shown to be G - causal for F - actin assembly only in the lamellipodia ( 0 – 1 . 4 439 µm from the edge ) , VASP only in the lamellipodia front ( 0 – 0 . 7 µm ) , and mDia1 at the lamellipodia base and in 440 the lamella ( 0 . 7 – 2 . 9 µm , Figure 7D ) . 441 The Arp2 / 3 complex requires a pre - formed filament or “mother filament” to act as an actin branch 442 nucleator ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . The origin and source of the mother filament remains obscure . In two 443 independent studies , the formin mDia1 was suggested to stimulate Arp2 / 3 activity in vitro and to precede 444 lamellipodia protrusion onset in vivo ( Isogai et al . , 2015 , Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Our data in U2OS cells determine 445 that mDia1 initiates actin assembly during retraction and is G - causal for F - actin at the lamellipodia base and in 446 the lamella ( Figure 5F ) . Indeed , this may be the region where mother filament seeds form prior to protrusion 447 onset , followed by autocatalytic nucleation of branched actin after activation and recruitment of Arp2 / 3 more 448 proximal to the leading edge . In addition to mDia1’s selective G - causal relation for F - actin assembly at the 449 lamellipodia - to - lamella transition , we found an unexpected direct G - causal relation between mDia1 and edge 450 motion at the lamellipodia front , where this nucleator is G - noncausal for F - actin ( Figure 5F ) . At first sight , this 451 outcome could be interpreted as mDia1 - decorated F - actin be too scarce compared to F - actin structures 452 controlled by other nucleators for a causality between mDia1 and F - actin to be detected . However , our pipeline 453 determined a causal link from mDia1 to edge motion not mediated through F - actin . Hence , the mDia1 signal 454 does contain information to support the prediction of an actin - independent link to edge motion . If the mDia1 455 image fluctuations were purely noise , this link would not be extracted . We propose that the GC from mDia1 to 456 edge movement relates to mDia1’s function in freeing F - actin barbed ends from capping proteins . This finding 457 indicates the unique opportunities perturbation - free analyses generate to distinguish multi - functional properties 458 of components . No perturbation experiment could be designed to determine this duality in mDia1’s action in the 459 lamellipodia and lamella . 460 19 The proposed pipeline further identified a direct causal chain at the lamellipodia front from Arp2 / 3 to F - 461 actin to edge velocity with feedback from F - actin to Arp2 / 3 , and a chain from VASP to F - actin to edge velocity 462 with a second G - causal link from VASP to edge velocity independent of F - actin - polymerization ( Figure 7E ) . 463 We interpret this result with a model , in which the membrane - tethered VASP bundles F - actin ( either by 464 VASP alone or in cooperation with fascin ) ( Bachmann et al . , 1999 , Breitsprecher et al . , 2008 , Schirenbeck et 465 al . , 2006 , Winkelman et al . , 2014 ) and thus contributes to protrusion forces in parallel to VASP’s activity as an 466 actin polymerase . Indeed , the direct link to edge motion is abrogated by VASP mutant that also abrogates F - 467 actin bundling ( Doppler and Storz , 2013 ) ( Figures 6D and S6C ) . This model is also consistent with our finding 468 that VASP - and Arp2 / 3 - induced F - actin assembly G - causes edge motion independently from each other 469 ( Figure 7C ) and highlights the sensitivity of our pipeline in deconvolving the inputs of distinct system 470 components into a common target – information that would have been inaccessible using traditional 471 perturbation approaches . 472 The performance of Granger causal inference is repeatedly disputed in the literature ( Stokes and 473 Purdon , 2017 , Barnett et al . , 2018 , Stokes and Purdon , 2018 ) . Where most discussions of these issues land is 474 an agreement that the performance depends on the dataset and the underlying model of the connectivity of 475 variables . Thus , it is imperative to validate the model assumptions . In most cases such a validation has to rely 476 on empirical analyses , as the causal structure of the analyzed variables is generally unknown . 477 To accomplish this in our work , we then checked reproducibility of GC outcomes across independent 478 imaging experiments with overlapping components : ( actin , Arp2 / 3 ) vs ( actin , cytoplasmic HaloTag ) vs ( actin , 479 mDia1 ) vs ( actin , VASP WT , VASP MT ) vs ( Arp2 / 3 , VASP ) . The GC pathways identified from the partially 480 observed systems were consistent enough to draw hypotheses for causal pathways in the whole system of 481 Arp2 / 3 , VASP , mDia1 , actin and edge motion . To check how much the GC network outcome depends on the 482 modeling strategy , we implemented variants of our framework in which one of the key strategies of our model 483 was oppressed ( see Methods and Figure S8 ) . We lost consistency in the GC pathway outcomes across 484 different imaging experiments when we eliminated spatial propagation of signals in the SPAR model or when 485 we dropped a flexible regression model selection under the Akaike - Information Criterion ( AIC ) ( see Methods ) . 486 This shows that inclusion of the information from neighboring windows is critical to eliminate confounding 487 20 factors , as is the proper choice locally of the time delays between variables . On the other hand , our tests 488 indicated that the GC pathway prediction is insensitive towards transformation of the raw image signals into 489 LFS signals ( Figure S8 ) . 490 The key limitation of the GC framework is that G - causal relations can only be determined within the 491 system of co - observed variables ( Eichler , 2013 ) . While the proposed pipeline determines cause - and - effect 492 relations between pairs of molecular processes , it is not yet able to map out directly causal interactions in 493 larger process circuits with multiple components funneling information through one common component . 494 Remedy to this limitation will arise from the development of hyperspectral imaging of an increasing number of 495 components ( Valm et al . , 2017 ) and from expanded multivariate GC models that integrate data from several 496 rounds of experiments under identical conditions but different configurations of component labeling . 497 21 Supplemental information 498 Supplemental Figures S1 – S8 499 Supplemental Videos S1 – S15 500 Supplemental Tables S1 – S2 501 502 Acknowledgments 503 We thank Dr .

Arp2 / 3 is Granger - causal for F - actin 607 assembly only in the lamellipodia , VASP only in the lamellipodia front , and mDia1 in the lamellipodia back and 608 lamella . No feedback is identified from F - actin assembly to VASP recruitment , while feedbacks are detected 609 from F - actin to Arp2 / 3 and mDia1 in their respective activity areas . The GC analysis suggests that Arp2 / 3 and 610 VASP operate independently to Granger - cause edge motion . We derive from this data the proposal that 611 Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin network and VASP - elongated linear actin bundles are independent F - actin 612 network architectures synergistically driving edge motion .

Dick McIntosh ( University of Colorado Boulder ) 635 and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Sigma ; F0926 - 500ML ) in a 636 humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 . All cells were tested for mycoplasma using a PCR - based Genlantis 637 Mycoscope Detection Kit ( MY01100 ) . Cells were not authenticated . 638 639 METHOD DETAILS 640 Plasmids 641 pSpCas9n ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX462 ) , pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( PX458 ) and pLKO . 1 were from Drs . Feng 642 Zhang and David Root , respectively ( Addgene plasmids # 48141 , # 48138 and # 10878 ) . Gene - targeting single 643 guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) were designed using CRISPor ( Concordet and Haeussler , 2018 ) . The self - cleaving 644 donor vector pMA - tial1 was a kind gift from Dr . Tilmann Bürckstümmer ( Lackner et al . , 2015 ) . HaloTag flanked 645 with homologous arms targeting the last exon of Arp3 / ACTR3 ( NM _ 005721 ) was cloned seamlessly into pMA - 646 tial1 ( HaloTag - N - 18 - ACTR3 donor ) using HiFi Assembly ( NEB ) . A codon - optimized split fluorescent protein 647 mNeonGreen2 1 - 10 ( mNG2 1 - 10 ) was cloned with SalI / NotI into the XhoI / NotI sites of pLVX - IRES - Puro ( Clontech ) . 648 mNeonGreen2 11 placed in tandem of four ( mNG2 114 ) , each separated with a GSGSG 5 amino acid linker and 649 flanked with homologous arms targeting the first exon of mDia1 / DIAPH1 ( NM _ 00521 ) , was blunt cloned into 650 the EcoRV site of pMA - tial1 ( mNG2 114 - C - 18 - DIAPH1 donor ) . mNeonGreen , SNAP , Halo , human β - actin , 651 mouse VASP and mouse mDia1 DNA fragments were PCR amplified with corresponding flanking homology 652 regions to seamlessly clone into pLVXCMV100 using HiFi Assembly to generate mNeonGreen - 18 - actin , 653 SNAP - 21 - and Halo - 21 - tagged VASP , and SNAP - 21 - mDia1 where 18 and 21 denotes the number of amino 654 acids in the linker between the tag and the tagged gene . These linkers and the terminal ends used for tagging 655 were chosen based on our previous work ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) . The 18 - linker sequence was 656 ( SGLRSGSGGGSASGGSGS ) and the 21 - linker sequence was ( EPTTEDLYFQSDNAIAGRPRSSG ) . The S235 657 and T273 residues ( corresponding to the S239 / T278 residues on human VASP ) in the Halo - tagged VASP were 658 28 PCR mutated to aspartic acid and glutamic acid , respectively . VASP knockdown ( KD ) cells were generated 659 and enriched by lentiviral infection of pLKO . 1 containing the short - hairpin RNA targeting VASP 660 ( TRCN0000369620 ) and by subsequent puromycin ( 2 µg / ml ) selection , 48 hours post - infection . All new 661 constructs used in this study were sequenced verified and are listed in Key Resources Table . Primers and 662 gBlocks used for cloning are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . mNeonGreen is licensed by Biotechnology & 663 Pharmaceuticals , Inc . 664 Cell Culture 665 Cells were counted using Cellometer Auto 1000 Bright Field Cell Counter ( Nexcelom ) . Lentiviral 666 particles were generated using the packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2 . G ( Addgene plasmids # 12260 and 667 # 12259 ) . Infected cells were bulk sorted using FACS , or selected with Puromycin ( 1 µg / ml ; Gibco ) . 668 Engineering of Genome - edited Cells 669 Arp3 was C - terminally tagged with HaloTag at its endogenous genetic loci in U2OS cells , and were 670 generated as follows : 1 x 10 5 U2OS cells seeded in a 6 well plate were transiently transfected overnight with 671 two pX462 plasmids containing a ACTR3 - targeting sgRNA together with HaloTag - N - 18 - ACTR3 donor using 672 polyethylenimine ( PEI ; Sigma ) . Genome - edited cells were labeled with Halo - TMR ligand ( 5 µM ; NEB ) , and 673 single cell Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorted ( FACSed ) into 96 wells tissue culture plates . Genome - edited 674 cells expressing Halo - Arp3 were screened and verified with Western Blotting . 675 Initially , we endogenously tagged mDia1 with a single HaloTag , but the signal from the tagged protein 676 was too dim , presumably due to the low abundance of mDia1 molecules in cells . This resulted in a very low 677 SNR not suitable for imaging and causality inference ( data not shown ) . To overcome this limitation , we used a 678 self - complementing split fluorescent protein mNeonGreen2 1 - 10 / 11 system with reduced background ( Feng et al . , 679 2017 ) , which allows signal amplification of low abundant proteins using a relatively short , 16 amino acid - long 680 11th β - strand . mDia1 was N - terminally tagged with four mNG2 11 peptides placed in tandem ( mNG2 114 ) , each 681 separated with a 5 amino acid linker ( GSGSG ) , totaling 79 amino acids in size from its endogenous loci in cells 682 expressing the mNG2 1 - 10 cells : 1 x 10 5 U2OS - mNG2 1 - 10 cells seeded in a 6 well plate and transiently 683 transfected overnight with plasmid pX458 containing a DIAPH1 - targeting sgRNA together with the mNG2 11 4 - C - 684 29 18 - DIAPH1 donor vector using PEI . Genome - edited cells were bulk FACSed , containing both heterozygous 685 and homozygous edited cells , verified with Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence using anti - mDia1 686 antibodies ( Figures 5A and S5 ) . 687 Introduction of Fluorescent Probes and Considerations to Minimally Perturbing the Cells 688 To minimize potential unforeseen perturbations , both ACTR3 and DIAPH1 CRISPR donor vectors 689 contain an additional 18 amino acid linker ( SGLRSGSGGGSASGGSGS ) between the tag and the tagged gene 690 inspired by Dr . Michael Davidson’s designs . Lentiviral constructs harboring a previously described truncated 691 CMV promoter containing only the first 100 bps of the promoter ( CMV100 ) ( Dean et al . , 2016 ) were used to 692 achieve low expression of the exogenous genes . In addition , all the tagged genes contained a variable amino 693 acid linker varying from 18 - 21 amino acids to minimize interference due to tagging . 694 Live - Cell Time - lapse Imaging of Cells 695 Cells were seeded on fibronectin ( 10 µg / ml ) - coated # 1 . 5 glass - bottom dishes and allowed to spread 696 overnight . The following day , cells were labeled with HaloTag ligand conjugated with JF549 ( 0 . 4 – 1 µM ; 697 Promega ) and / or SNAP ligand conjugated with SiR - 647 ( 0 . 25 – 1 µM ; NEB ) for 30 minutes , and subsequently 698 washed twice with DMEM . Prior to imaging , the media was replaced with phenol - red free DMEM supplemented 699 with 20 mM HEPES pH7 . 4 . Time lapse image sequences were acquired on a climate - controlled ( maintained at 700 37°C ) , fully motorized Nikon Ti - Eclipse inverted microscope with Perfect Focus System , equipped with a 60× , 701 1 . 49 NA APO TIRF objective ( Nikon ) with an additional 1 . 8× tube lens ( yielding a final magnification of 108× ; 702 Andor Technology ) , and an Andor Diskovery illuminator coupled to a Yokogawa CSU - X1 confocal spinning 703 disk head with 100 nm pinholes . Image sequences were recorded using a scientific CMOS camera with 6 . 5 - µm 704 pixel size ( pco . edge ) at a 3 Hz frame rate . 705 Overview of the Granger Causality ( GC ) analysis pipeline 706 The input to the Granger Causality ( GC ) pipeline is a set of two - channel fluorescence live cell movies 707 visualizing the dynamic recruitment of proteins implicated in regulating cell edge protrusion and retraction 708 cycles . Conceptually , GC analysis is not limited to protein recruitment , but any variable for which a time series 709 can be extracted from a live cell movie can be processed , as discussed in the following sections . Given the 710 30 specific test application in this work , one variable unrelated to protein recruitment is the local edge movement . 711 We thus refer to the variables more generally as molecular and cellular activities . After image processing and 712 statistical causal inference , the pipeline produces diagrams of the cause - effect relation network between the 713 imaged activities . The pipeline is designed to automatically optimize computational parameters in a data - driven 714 fashion . Thus , the pipeline runs from the raw movies to the cause - effect network with very few user inputs . In 715 the following , we describe each step of the pipeline with the necessary detail . 716 In comparison to our previous analyses of edge motion and molecular activities ( Ma et al . , 2018 , Azoitei 717 et al . , 2019 ) , we upgraded the image and signal processing to obtain more accurate subcellular readouts , 718 which was essential to the application of statistical modeling and causal inference . Specifically , we developed 719 a new segmentation method called Multi - Scale - Automatic ( MSA ) segmentation that combines multiple 720 segmentation results from different algorithms and parameters to generate accurate cell masks . In terms of 721 signal processing , we introduced a decomposition of the molecular activity oscillation into low - frequency and 722 high - frequency activities , because the molecular recruitments encompassed a sub - spectrum of oscillations that 723 were much slower than those of the protrusion - retraction ( P / R ) cycles . These technical improvements 724 contributed to generating robust and consistent GC predictions within the network of actin regulators . 725 Cropping an active part of a cell showing dynamic edge motion 726 Several cells were typically imaged in one fluorescence movie . For the statistical inference of causal 727 relations among molecular activities near the edge , we cropped a part of a cell where most of the cell edge 728 segments displayed at least a few cycles of P / R events . In such an area , the imaged proteins typically showed 729 multiple cycles of recruitments co - fluctuating with the dynamic edge motion . We avoided cropping regions with 730 frequent occurrence of ruffling , because the fluorescence intensities at ruffles are abnormally amplified . We 731 also avoided regions that were filled with static cytoskeletal structures such as transversal arcs in the actin 732 images and focal adhesions in the VASP images . Unlike protein recruitment in the lamellipodia , the molecular 733 activities on the static structures were unrelated to edge movement . These cropping criteria were equally 734 applied across all the fluorescence movies of different proteins . 735 Multi - Scale - Automatic ( MSA ) segmentation 736 31 The cell area in each frame of cropped live cell movies was segmented to extract cell edge motion 737 profiles and molecular activities near the cell edge . The previous segmentation methods developed in our lab 738 for edge motion profiling consist of three steps : ( i ) smoothing images with a Gaussian filter ; ( ii ) using an 739 automatic intensity thresholding algorithm ; ( iii ) morphological closing of cell masks for filling small holes . The 740 automatic thresholding algorithms include Otsu ( Otsu , 1979 ) , Rosin ( Rosin , 2001 ) , and a custom - written 741 algorithm called ‘minmax’ as previously described ( Ma et al . , 2018 ) . These methods were successfully applied 742 to a variety of imaging studies with different data quality ( Machacek et al . , 2009 , Han et al . , 2015 , Ma et al . , 2018 , 743 Azoitei et al . , 2019 ) . However , the automatic thresholding algorithms often failed when the signal - to - noise - ratio 744 varied between different parts of the images , and it was inconvenient for a user to have to optimize the 745 segmentation parameters for each movie . 746 To automate the manual optimization of the segmentation parameters and to improve the accuracy of 747 edge motion profiles , we developed the MSA segmentation method , which is a simple ensemble - learning 748 method ( Rokach , 2010 ) that combines the previous segmentation methods in our lab . First , we computed 42 749 different cell masks for each image by applying all combinations of segmentation parameters : 3 thresholding 750 algorithms , 7 different σ values of Gaussian filters for smoothing ranging from 0 to 3 pixels , and 2 different 751 radius parameters for morphological closing . For each pixel , we then computed the mask score which is 752 defined by the number of different cell masks that classified the pixel as foreground . The mask scores 753 themselves across pixels became a new , transformed image where the signals are proportional to foreground 754 probabilities . The mask score image was much easier to segment because the scores in the background 755 clustered at a low value and the scores in the foreground clustered at a high value . We used the middle value 756 of the low and high scores of the two peaks to segment the mask score images . In most cases , the MSA 757 segmentation generated more accurate cell masks than any single combination of the thresholding algorithms 758 and Gaussian filtering parameters , as assessed by visual inspection . 759 To segment the two - channel fluorescence images with different combinations of proteins as objectively 760 as possible , we added the two images of the different proteins so that the cell masks did not depend on a 761 particular protein . Since our two - channel images had pixel intensities in a similar range , the addition was 762 32 applied without scale adjustment . The summation image was segmented using the MSA segmentation 763 method . 764 Cell edge trembling correction 765 To ensure accurate edge motion profiling , we investigated whether cell masks of a movie measured the 766 morphological changes in an unbiased manner . We occasionally found events , in which cell masks globally 767 dilated or eroded by ~ 1 pixel between two consecutive frames before stabilizing again at the following frames . 768 This cell edge trembling was subtle but caused a systematic bias in the cross - correlation between edge 769 velocity and molecular recruitment at lag 0 , as previously addressed ( Marston et al . , 2020 ) . Though the MSA 770 segmentation reduced this edge trembling effect , the bias in the cross - correlations remained . 771 We corrected the segmented edge trembling effect by introducing weighted averaging of three 772 consecutive cell masks . In particular , we first computed the level set function at each location ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) defining 773 the distance from the cell boundary toward the cell inside . The level set functions , 𝜙 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) at three consecutive 774 time points were averaged with weights as follows : 775 Corrected Mask ( 𝑡 ) = { ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) | 1 5 𝜙 𝑡−1 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) + 3 5 𝜙 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) + 1 5 𝜙 𝑡 + 1 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) > 0 } , 776 where the weights were chosen heuristically . The corrected masks generated subcellular edge velocities and 777 molecular activities that showed no bias in the cross - correlations . 778 Tracking edge motion and probing windows 779 The segmented cell boundaries of a live cell movie allowed us to measure edge velocities and 780 molecular activities at a submicron - scale using the previously developed morphodynamic profiling algorithms 781 ( Ma et al . , 2018 , Machacek et al . , 2009 ) . We tracked the segmented cell boundaries and small probing 782 windows that partitioned the area near the edge ( Figure 1G ) . In the application of the algorithm , we used the 783 option ‘Constant number’ as a method of propagating the windows between consecutive time points . To select 784 the size of the probing windows , we first visually inspected an overall depth of the lamellipodia from the edge , 785 which was ~ 1 . 4 µm for most of the imaged cells . We decided to analyze a band 0 – 2 . 9 µm sub - adjacent to the 786 cell edge in order to capture probable differences in molecular recruitment between lamellipodia and lamella . 787 33 Lamellipodia and lamella were further split in two layers in order to capture potential gradients in regulation . 788 This determined the size of the probing windows to 720×720 nm 2 width and depth ( Figure 1G ) . Using this 789 window grid , we extracted time series of local edge velocity and recruitment of two different proteins . 790 Subtraction of low - frequency oscillation for molecular recruitments 791 To test the requirement of GC - based causal inference and correlation analysis for compatible time 792 scales between the analyzed variables , we determined the characteristic time scales of extracted edge 793 velocities and molecular recruitments using auto - correlation analysis . In each probing window , the auto - 794 correlation function ( ACF ) of an edge velocity time series was computed . The ACFs were averaged over the 795 windows for each cell . The per - cell averaged ACFs were remarkably consistent ( Figure 3A ) , showing that the 796 average duration of P / R cycles is maintained across experiments . The ACFs had a maximal negative value at 797 ~ 30 s on average ( Figure 3A ) , indicating a duration of P / R cycles of ~ 60s . In contrast , the ACFs of molecular 798 recruitments indicated much slower cycles with durations > 240 s ( Figure 3A for actin and Arp2 / 3 ) . 799 We decided to cancel out fluctuation components much slower than the average P / R cycle , assuming 800 that these components are marginally involved the regulation of edge movements . To accomplish this we 801 computed moving medians over rolling time intervals of 60 s ( 20 frames ) , i . e . the average duration of a P / R 802 cycle . Examples of raw molecular activity time series ( 𝑋 𝑡 ) and their low - frequency components ( 𝐿𝐹 𝑡 ) are shown 803 in Figures 3B and 3D . Taking 𝐿𝐹 𝑡 as baseline activity , the low - frequency subtracted ( LFS ) molecular activity 804 was defined as the percentage of activity above baseline relative to the baseline : 805 𝐿𝐹𝑆 . 𝑋 𝑡 = 𝑋 𝑡 −𝐿𝐹 𝑡 𝐿𝐹 𝑡 × 100 . 806 Intriguingly , the LFS activities of actin and Arp2 / 3 recruitments displayed spatiotemporal dynamics similar to 807 the corresponding edge velocity dynamics ( Figures 3C and 3E ) . We concluded that the LFS activities are the 808 primary drivers of the edge fluctuations and thus focused our causality analysis of actin regulating factors on 809 this signal . 810 Reconstruction of synthetic live cell movies using LFS - molecular recruitments 811 34 To examine the difference between molecular recruitments observed in the fluorescence movies and 812 computed LFS - molecular activities , we reconstructed synthetic live cell movies that visualized the LFS - 813 activities next to the original fluorescence intensities ( Video S4 ) . 814 The process of mapping LFS time series back into the image space required a few steps to ensure the 815 smooth transition between the window - based array of LFS - activities and time - lapse images . Since the LFS - 816 activities had signed values , they were rescaled to the [ 0 , 1 ] range . We matched the 1 st percentile of the 817 activities to 0 and the 99 th percentile to 1 , and truncated at the two extreme percentiles to exclude outliers . 818 Since a cell shape could not be perfectly morphed into the shape at the next time frame , the trajectory of 819 locations of each window over time was not smooth enough , so direct mapping of the scaled LFS - activities into 820 the pixels covered by the associated probing window in in the image space generated artifacts . Instead , we 821 applied cubic smoothing spline interpolation to the mapped pixel intensities using the Matlab function csaps ( ) 822 with a strong smoothing parameter . This resulted in successful reconstruction of LFS - activity movies from the 823 original imaging data . 824 The reconstructed live cell fluorescence movies allowed us to visualize the activities of actin and its 825 regulators that fluctuated at the time scale of edge P / R cycles . The movies showed a much stronger coupling 826 of , for example , LFS - actin activity to P / R events than the original actin activities ( Video S4 ) . 827 Filtering out probing windows at quiescent edges 828 Before inferring GC relations , our pipeline implemented diagnostic tests that checked whether the 829 imaged cell edge motion displayed systematic P / R events and whether the edge velocity time series were 830 appropriate input for statistical time series analysis . Because our study targets pathways that regulate P / R 831 cycles in migrating cells , we eliminated windows that sampled molecular activities in quiescent edge sectors . 832 To identify such windows , we statistically tested if the edge velocity time series represented a white - noise 833 process with the underlying assumption that actively regulated time series cannot be described by white noise . 834 We used the Matlab function lbqtest ( ) that implements the Ljung - Box test ( Ljung and Box , 1978 ) to determine 835 whether the auto - correlation of the edge velocity time series were zero – an indication that the edge in that 836 35 sector was quiescent . If the proportion of the quiescent windows was > 50 % , then the cell was labeled as 837 overall quiescent and excluded from the subsequent GC inference . 838 For non - quiescent windows we also checked if the edge motion fulfilled stationarity . Since the GC 839 analysis requires that the observed time series is free of a trend , we performed for each edge velocity time 840 series an augmented Dickey – Fuller test ( Dickey and Fuller , 1979 ) ( using the Matlab function adftest ( ) ) – the 841 standard test to identify the existence of systematic trends in time series data ) . If the majority of probing 842 windows was determined to possess systematic trends , then the cell edge motion was determined as non - 843 stationary overall and the data was excluded from further analysis . 844 Spatially propagating auto - regressive ( SPAR ) models for one - channel live cell movies 845 Inferring the GC relations within a dynamic system relies on a model that specifies how the time series 846 data in the system are generated . To build such a model for live cell imaging data , we began with modeling the 847 dynamics of molecular activities of one protein across subcellular windows and over time . On top of a purely 848 auto - regressive model quantifying the dependency of a variable’s future on its past , we added spatial 849 dependency to quantify how much the future of a variable in one location relates to the present and past of the 850 variable in the four adjacent probing windows . 851 We denote by 𝑌 𝑡 , 𝑌 𝑡𝐿 , 𝑌 𝑡𝑅 , 𝑌 𝑡𝑈𝑝 , 𝑌 𝑡𝐿𝑜 the molecular activities at time 𝑡 in a target window and in its left , right , 852 upper and lower neighboring windows , respectively . Our generative stochastic model for one protein , called the 853 Spatially Propagating Auto - Regressive ( SPAR ) model , is written as follows . 854 𝑌 t = 𝛼 + ∑ 𝜙 𝑗 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗 𝑃 0 𝑗 = 1 + ∑ 𝜙 𝑗𝐿 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝐿 𝑃 1 𝑗 = 1 + ∑ 𝜙 𝑗𝑅 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝑅 𝑃 1 𝑗 = 1 + ∑ 𝜙 𝑗𝑈𝑝 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝑈𝑝 𝑃 1 𝑗 = 1 + ∑ 𝜙 𝑗𝐿𝑜 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝐿𝑜 𝑃 1 𝑗 = 1 + 𝜖 𝑡 , ( Eq . 1 ) where 𝜖 𝑡 ’s are independent identically distributed random errors with mean 0 and variance 𝜎 2 , 𝑃 0 is the auto - 855 regressive order for the same window , 𝑃 1 is the cross - regressive order for the four adjacent windows , and 856 36 𝜙 𝑗𝐿 , 𝜙 𝑗𝑅 , 𝜙 𝑗𝑈𝑝 , 𝜙 𝑗𝐿𝑜 are the coefficients to quantify the influence of the left , right , upper and lower window time 857 series , respectively , on the target series . 858 The number of possible SPAR models depends on the range of values that must be considered as 859 plausible regressive orders , 𝑃 0 and 𝑃 1 . For the present study , we considered 𝑃 0 and 𝑃 1 up to half the duration 860 of an average P / R cycles , which is ~ 30 sec or 10 time frames . Thus , we set 1 ≤ 𝑃 0 , 𝑃 1 ≤ 10 . This led to 861 10 × 10 possible SPAR models to describe the dynamics of one variable . As discussed next , these models are 862 evaluated independently in every window , which comes with substantial computational burden . Therefore , to 863 reduce the number of possible model orders for efficiency , we made the assumption that the cross - regressive 864 order is less than the autoregressive order for the same window ( 𝑃 0 ≥ 𝑃 1 ) , because 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝐿 , 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝑅 , 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝑈𝑝 or 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝐿𝑜 would 865 be less correlated with 𝑌 𝑡 than 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗 would be . This assumption reduced the number of candidate models from 866 100 to 55 . After the model selection procedures described below , the selected orders ranged from 4 to 9 for 𝑃 0 , 867 and from 1 to 3 for 𝑃 1 , for most molecular activities analyzed in this paper . 868 Our pipeline includes an exhaustive model selection step , which is essential for accurate causal 869 inference ( see below ) . In each probing window , we fitted all candidate SPAR models across the set range of 870 regressive orders . The model parameters were estimated by the standard least - squares method based on 871 which we computed the Akaike - Information Criterion ( AIC ) ( Akaike , 1974 ) for all the fitted models . Analysis of 872 the spatial distribution of the orders indicated that while the AIC values varied between cells and between 873 activity , they were similar for the probing windows in one layer . Thus , we selected the optimal 𝑃 0 and 𝑃 1 as 874 those minimizing the averaged AIC values per window layer and per - cell . This simplification is also necessary 875 to limit computational cost and to increase robustness in model selection as not every window offers sufficient 876 signal to noise ratio for a complete optimization of the AIC . 877 After AIC - based model selection , we statistically tested whether fluctuations in a particular molecular 878 activity propagated between adjacent windows . For example , we found that fluctuations in actin recruitment 879 near the cell edge actively propagated to adjacent windows while fluctuations in the concentration of a 880 cytoplasmic probe showed no intracellular information flow ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . To identify these information 881 flows , we compared the prediction capability of the full model ( Eq . 1 ) with the capability of reduced models in 882 37 which the influence of activities in either the left , the right , the upper , or the lower window adjacent to the target 883 window was excluded ( Figure S1C ) . For example , to identify the information flow from the left window to the 884 target window , we tested the following null hypothesis for the SPAR model in ( Eq . 1 ) : 885 𝐻 0 : 𝜙 1𝐿 = ⋯ = 𝜙 𝑃 1 𝐿 = 0 . 886 As discussed below ( Eq . 3 ) , this hypothesis is accepted , i . e . no information flow , or rejected , i . e . information 887 flows from the left window to the target window using a Fisher test that compares the residuals of the full and 888 reduced models . We obtained the P - values for four directional intracellular information flows at individual 889 windows . These multiple testing results were then adjusted to control the false discovery rate ( FDR ) ( Benjamini 890 and Hochberg , 1995 ) at 20 % . 891 Granger - causality test at a single window for two - channel live cell movies 892 We extended the SPAR model for the dynamics of one protein ( Eq . 1 ) to identify inter - molecular 893 information flows at each probing window . In the SPAR model for two - channel live cell movies , we specified 894 the spatiotemporal dependency between subcellular molecular activities and local edge velocities as follows : 895 896 𝑌 t = 𝛼 + ∑ 𝜙 𝑗 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗 𝑃 0 𝑗 = 1 + ∑ ∑ 𝜙 𝑗𝐷 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝐷 𝑃 1 𝑗 = 1 𝐷 = { 𝐿 , 𝑅 , 𝑈𝑝 , 𝐿𝑜 } + ∑ 𝜃 𝑗 𝑉 𝑡−𝑗 𝑄 0 𝑗 = 0 + ∑ ∑ 𝜃 𝑗𝐷 𝑉 𝑡−𝑗𝐷 𝑄 1 𝑗 = 0 𝐷 = { 𝐿 , 𝑅 } + ∑ 𝛽 𝑗 𝑋 𝑡−𝑗 𝑀 0 𝑗 = 0 + ∑ ∑ 𝛽 𝑗𝐷 𝑋 𝑡−𝑗𝐷 𝑄 1 𝑗 = 0 𝐷 = { 𝐿 , 𝑅 , 𝑈𝑝 , 𝐿𝑜 } + 𝜖 𝑡 , ( Eq . 2 ) 897 where 𝑌 𝑡 , 𝑋 𝑡 denote the putative effector and causative activities at time 𝑡 ( 𝑡 = 1 , 2 , … , 𝑇 ) , 𝐷 = { 𝐿 , 𝑅 , 𝑈𝑝 , 𝐿𝑜 } 898 denote the left , right , upper , and lower windows to the analyzed target window , 𝑉 𝑡 denotes the edge velocities 899 at the edge segment closest to the target window , 𝑃 0 , 𝑃 1 , 𝑄 0 , 𝑄 1 , 𝑀 0 are the temporal lag orders for different 900 features , and 𝜖 𝑡 ’s are independent random errors with mean 0 and variance 𝜎 2 ( Figure 2B ) . 901 38 In this SPAR model , a current activity of the effector ( 𝑌 𝑡 ) is explained by all the local features available 902 in the two - channel movies . Importantly , in contrast to typical time series regression models , we include the 903 activity at present time of the putative cause ( 𝑋 𝑡 ) and thus refer to our analysis as instantaneous Granger - 904 causality ( Runge , 2018 ) . Given that our imaging frequency is set to one multi - channel acquisition every 3 905 seconds , the activities of the putative cause and relevant features at the present time ( 𝑋 𝑡 𝑋 𝑡𝐷 , 𝑉 𝑡 , 𝑉 𝑡𝐷 ) in ( Eq . 2 ) 906 can be regarded as the proxy of their past values up to ~ 1 . 5 second before the processed time 𝑡 . Incorporating 907 a contemporaneous link turned out to be critical for the model to result in GC outcomes that are consistent with 908 the known biochemical relations between Arp2 / 3 and F - actin . This indicates that inter - molecular information 909 flows occur faster than multi - channel light microscopy permits without introducing photo - toxicity and bleaching . 910 Similar to the SPAR model for one protein , the optimal model orders were selected using the AIC . 911 Orders up to the half of the P / R cycle were considered under the following constraints : 1 ≤ 𝑃 1 ≤ 𝑃 0 ≤ 10 , 0 ≤ 912 𝑄 1 ≤ 𝑄 0 ≤ 10 , 0 ≤ 𝑀 0 ≤ 10 . Since an exhaustive testing of all combinations of possible orders is 913 computationally too costly , we employed a sequential model selection approach , where ( i ) the SPAR model in 914 ( Eq . 1 ) was first considered to select the auto - regressive orders , 𝑃 0 and 𝑃 1 ; ( ii ) using the selected 𝑃 0 and 𝑃 1 , 915 the model in ( Eq . 2 ) without the terms of { 𝑋 𝑡 } was used to choose the optimal 𝑄 0 and 𝑄 1 ; ( iii ) lastly , the optimal 916 𝑀 0 was selected using the other pre - selected orders . As in the model selection for one protein , the model 917 orders were chosen to be the one minimizing the averaged AIC values per probing window layer on a cell . In 918 the example of SPAR models testing the GC from Arp2 / 3 to F - actin in the region 0 – 0 . 7 µm , the selected model 919 orders varied among the analyzed 20 cells within ranges 6 ≤ 𝑃 0 ≤ 8 , 1 ≤ 𝑃 1 ≤ 3 , 1 ≤ 𝑄 0 , 𝑄 1 ≤ 2 , 0 ≤ 𝑀 0 ≤ 3 . It is 920 noteworthy that the optimal lag orders between putative cause and effect relations were mostly 𝑀 0 = 1 and 921 models with only a contemporaneous term ( 𝑀 0 = 0 ) occurred for two out of 20 cells . 922 To identify the GC relations between two molecular processes in a particular window , we tested 923 whether the activities of the putative cause in the same window ( { 𝑋 𝑡 } ) were indispensable in explaining the 924 current effector activity ( 𝑌 𝑡 ) . In other words , we tested the null hypothesis for the SPAR model in ( Eq . 2 ) , 925 𝐻 0 : 𝛽 0 = ⋯ = 𝛽 𝑀 0 = 0 , 926 by using the following F - test statistic , 927 39 𝐹 = ( 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 − 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑀 0 + 1 ) ( 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑇 − 𝑝 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 ) ⁄ , ( Eq . 3 ) where 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 ( 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 ) is the residual sum of squares of the full model ( the reduced model or the model 928 restricted by the null hypothesis 𝐻 0 ) , 𝑇 is the total number of time points , and 𝑝 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 is the number of parameters 929 of the full model . A large F - statistic indicated the indispensability of the putative cause at a probing window , 930 resulting in a small P - value . The P - values obtained by the F - tests in individual windows provided subcellular 931 evidence for the tested causal relation . 932 The directionality of the GC relation follows from the temporal structure designed in the model for 933 inference . Since we employ an instantaneous GC formalism the interpretation of directionality needs attention 934 in the situation , in which only the contemporaneous link from 𝑋 𝑡 and 𝑌 𝑡 is significant without any lagged 935 dependency between ( 𝑋 𝑡−𝑗 , 𝑌 𝑡 ) or ( 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗 , 𝑋 𝑡 ) , 𝑗 ≥ 1 . In this situation , the framework may be detecting bi - 936 directional GC relations between { 𝑋 𝑡 } and { 𝑌 𝑡 } , that is , a causal feedback loop . However , since the sampling 937 rate permitted by microscopy may not always be fast enough , a significant contemporaneous link without 938 support from a lagged dependency is insufficient to claim causal feedback . This situation never occurred in the 939 presented image data . 940 Statistical diagnostics of the Granger - causality tests in individual windows 941 After fitting the regression models and implementing the F - tests , we applied three diagnostic measures 942 to validate the model estimates in individual windows . First , we checked auto - correlations of the residuals , 943 which need to be close to zero at all lags . Second , we checked the condition number which is an index of 944 multi - collinearity of the predictors in the regression model ( Eq . 2 ) . A large condition number ( conventionally > 945 30 ) indicates severe multi - collinearity and unstable parameter estimation . Third , we checked whether the 946 distribution of the residuals follows a normal distribution using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( KS ) test via the 947 Matlab function kstest ( ) . If those diagnostic measures indicate poor regression estimates , then the 948 corresponding F - test P - values were not accepted for further cell - based analysis . 949 Granger - causal relations based on cell - to - cell variability 950 40 Following GC - analysis in each probing window , the per - window GC P - values were then integrated into 951 per - window layer / per - cell median P - values . Because the elementary unit of our imaging experiments was one 952 cell , the per - cell measurements were statistically tested to determine the final conclusion on GC relations 953 based on cell - to - cell variability . We utilized Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine whether the per - cell 954 median P - values of n cells were significantly smaller than the nominal level 0 . 05 , or equivalently , whether the 955 majority of probing windows in a particular layer showed significant evidence for a putative causal relation over 956 multiple independent cells . Using the Matlab function signrank ( ) , the signed rank tests were implemented 957 separately to the four layers that partitioned the lamellipodia and lamella region according to the distance from 958 the cell edge ( Figure 2D ) . The obtained rank test P - values in this study were listed in Supplementary Table S2 . 959 Drawing GC pathway network diagrams 960 The GC analysis of two - channel live cell movies determined the combinatorial GC relations between 961 the recruitment of two molecules and the edge motion dynamics at different distances from the edge ( Figure 962 2D ) . The obtained GC relations resulted in connectivity networks , which we visualized using the hierarchical 963 graph drawing algorithm ( Sugiyama et al . , 1981 ) , which is implemented in the Matlab function digraph ( ) . For all 964 graphs we set the option of layout to ‘layered’ , assuming that edge motion is the ultimate effector of the 965 pathways . It automatically generated GC networks at the different distances from the cell edge ( Figure 2E ) , 966 which unveiled spatially heterogeneous actin regulatory pathways in lamellipodia and lamella . 967 Key modeling strategies which enable reproducible GC pathway outcomes 968 We chose to examine how much the GC outcomes varies between different modeling strategies . We 969 implemented variants of our framework by removing one of the key modeling strategies at the time . We 970 eliminated : ( i ) low - frequency subtraction ( LFS ) ; ( ii ) spatial propagation of information between probing 971 windows , that is , by exclusion of the dependencies of the effector variable on the terms 𝑌 𝑡−𝑗𝐷 , 𝑉 𝑡−𝑗𝐷 , 𝑋 𝑡−𝑗𝐷 , 𝐷 = 972 { 𝐿 , 𝑅 , 𝑈𝑝 , 𝐿𝑜 } ; in Eq . 2 ; ( iii ) Akaike - Information Criterion ( AIC ) - based model selection , that is , by pre - setting all 973 the lag orders ( 𝑃 0 , 𝑃 1 , 𝑄 0 , 𝑄 1 and 𝑀 0 ) to 1 ; and ( iv ) contemporaneous links . The four variants of the framework 974 were applied to two imaging datasets in which we have strong expectations of GC outcomes based on existing 975 literature : two - channel movies of ( actin , Arp2 / 3 ) and ( actin , cytoplasmic HaloTag ) . 976 41 Elimination of LFS had no effect on the prediction , in that the analyses for both data sets resulted in the 977 same GC networks ( Figure S8A ) . Thus , the LFS was not critical for the GC result , but it produced clearer 978 cross - correlation curves and auto - correlation curves . In contrast , elimination of spatial propagation or AIC - 979 based model selection , resulted in GC outcomes that were neither consistent with the outcomes generated by 980 the complete modeling strategy nor were they consistent for common links between the two imaging datasets 981 ( actin , Arp2 / 3 ) and ( actin , cytoplasmic HaloTag ) ( Figures S8B – C ) . For example , when we pre - specified all the 982 lag orders ( 𝑃 0 , 𝑃 1 , 𝑄 0 , 𝑄 1 and 𝑀 0 ) to be 1 without utilizing the AIC - based model selection , this analysis identified 983 the GC from F - actin to edge velocity only in layer 1 for the dataset of ( actin , Arp2 / 3 ) movies , whereas it 984 identified the GC from F - actin to edge velocity only in layer 2 for the dataset of ( actin , cytoplasmic HaloTag ) 985 movies ( Figure S8C ) . This is a self - contradiction , demonstrating that over - simplified model orders can lead to 986 wrong GC relations , and the model selection step is essential for accurate causal inference . The analysis 987 without using the instantaneous GC identified no causal interactions between any of the variables ( Figure 988 S8D ) , suggesting that a proper model for lamellipodia dynamics imaged every 3 seconds needs to include 989 contemporaneous predictors so that the model can capture fast interactions between actin and its regulators . 990 991 42 SUPPLEMENTAL VIDEO LEGENDS 992 993 Video S1 .
