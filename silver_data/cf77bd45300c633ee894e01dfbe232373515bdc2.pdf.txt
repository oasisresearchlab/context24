However , the key regulatory molecules regulating this process have remained elu - sive . Here , we demonstrate that Rap1 plays a pivotal role in chemokine - induced integrin activation and migration . Rap1 was activated by secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine ( SLC ; CCL21 ) and stromal - derived factor 1 ( CXCL4 ) treatment in lymphocytes within seconds . Inhibition of Rap1 by Spa1 , a Rap1 - speciﬁc GTPase - activating protein , abrogated chemokine - stimulated lymphocyte rapid adhesion to endo - C thelial cells under ﬂow via intercellular adhesion molecule 1 . Expression of a dominant active Rap1V12 in lymphocytes stimulated shear - resistant adhesion , robust cell migration on immobilized intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 , and transendothelial migration under ﬂow . We also demonstrated that Rap1V12 expression in lymphocytes induced a polarized morphology , accompanied by the redistribution of CXCR4 and CD44 to the leading edge and uropod , respectively . Spa1 effectively suppressed this polarization after SLC treatment . This unique characteristic of Rap1 may control chemokine - induced lymphocyte extravasation . Introduction Leukocyte emigration is multistep processes mediated by adhesive interactions with the vascular endothelium . Or - chestrated by chemokines and adhesion molecules , these in - teractions sequentially result in rolling , firm adhesion , and transmigration through the endothelial layer ( Springer , 1995 ; Butcher and Picker , 1996 ) . Firm attachment to the endothelium under flow is mediated by leukocyte integrins , typically the (cid:2) 2 and (cid:3) 4 subtypes ( Springer , 1995 ; Butcher and Picker , 1996 ) . Chemokines presented on the endothelium in lymphoid and inflammatory tissues rapidly up - regulate the adhesive activity of leukocyte integrins , enabling integrin - dependent adhesion of circulating lymphocytes to the en - dothelium at these sites ( Butcher et al . , 1999 ) . Chemokines also induce a distinct polarized cell morphology and cell surface receptor distribution , which also facilitates cell migration ( Sanchez - Madrid and del Pozo , 1999 ) . Adhering lympho - cytes migrate over the endothelium under the control of chemokine promigratory signals and adhesion molecules , usually initiating emigration at the intercellular junction . In addition , fluid shear stresses are required for rapid and effi - cient transmigration of lymphocytes ( Cinamon et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , the roles of chemokines in lymphocyte trafficking can be subdivided into the rapid activation of integrins , the induction of attached lymphocyte migration , and the facilita - tion of shear - dependent lymphocyte transmigration across the endothelium .

Gi protein – linked receptors trigger a diversified cas - cade of second messengers ( Thelen , 2001 ) . Although PI3K is important in neutrophil chemotaxis , lymphocytes did not show a significant dependence on this mediator ( Hirsch et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2000 ; Sasaki et al . , 2000 ) . Inhibition of PI3K activity has little effect on lymphocyte homing in vivo ( Con - stantin et al . , 2000 ) or on transendothelial migration in lami - nar flow chambers ( Cinamon et al . , 2001 ) . These findings imply that chemokine receptors can induce lymphocyte che - motaxis through PI3K - independent pathways . The small GTPase Rap1 is a potent inside - out signal that functions in a distinct manner from PI3K and PKC , and increases the adhesive activity of both lymphocyte func - tion – associated antigen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) and very late antigen 4 ( VLA - 4 ; Katagiri et al . , 2000 ; Reedquist et al . , 2000 ) . Rap1 activation occurs in response to a variety of external stimuli ( Bos et al . , 2001 ) , including T cell receptor engagement ( Katagiri et al . , 2002 ) , CD31 stimulation ( Reedquist et al . , 2000 ) , and CD98 ligation ( Suga et al . , 2001 ) . In this paper , we investigate the possibility that Rap1 is involved in lym - phocyte adhesion and transmigration by chemokines . We show that rapid Rap1 activation by chemokines is required for adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes through en - dothelium . Furthermore , Rap1 has the unique functions that stimulate robust cell migration and induce lymphocyte polarization . Our work suggests that Rap1 plays a pivotal role in lymphocyte trafficking . Results SLC stimulates rapid Rap1 activation in lymphocytes To examine the activation of Rap1 in primary lymphocytes , mouse lymph node ( LN ) cells were treated with secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine ( SLC ) . Rap1 activation was sub - sequently measured with the pull - down assay using a GST – RalGDS – RBD fusion protein ( Zwartkruis et al . , 1998 ; Fig . 1 A ) . Rap1 was maximally activated by SLC at 30 s , the ear - liest time point measurable , but down - regulated to basal lev - els over the minutes after stimulation ( Fig . 1 A ) . Rap1 acti - vation by SLC was completely inhibited by PTX treatment , indicating that Rap1 activation is linked to Gi protein sig - naling ( Fig . 1 B ) . Stromal - derived factor 1 ( SDF - 1 ) also in - duced rapid Rap1 activation in LN cells ( Fig . 1 C ) . Rap1 triggers rapid LFA - 1 – mediated adhesion to ICAM - 1 induced by chemokines We examined the requirement of Rap1 activation for inte - grin - dependent adhesion . Soluble SLC induced the tran - sient shear - resistant adhesion of LN cells to immobilized in - tercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ; Fig . 2 A ) , an effect that was blocked by treatment with either anti - LFA - 1 or anti - ICAM - 1 antibodies . Increased adhesion was first de - tected at 1 min and peaked at 10 min , but was quickly down - regulated to basal levels after 15 min . To examine the induction of adhesion after Rap1 activation , we inhibited Rap1 activation by overexpressing Spa1 , a Rap1 - specific GTPase - activating protein ( Kurachi et al . , 1997 ) , in lym - phocytes . LN cells derived from transgenic mice in which the adenovirus receptor ( coxsackie adenovirus receptor ) is only expressed in T cells ( Wan et al . , 2000 ) were infected with adenovirus expressing either GFP alone or Spa1 . Ap - proximately 80 % of the infected cells , primarily Thy - 1 – pos - itive T cells , expressed GFP ( unpublished data ) . Rap1 acti - vation after a 30 - s SLC stimulation in Spa1 - expressing cells was reduced to 20 % of the levels observed in control cells ( Fig . 1 C ) . The degree of Rap1 suppression correlated with the infection efficiency , suggesting that Rap1 activation is markedly inhibited in Spa1 - expressing cells . Then , we exam - ined the effect of Spa1 expression on lymphocyte adhesion to ICAM - 1 after SLC stimulation ( Fig . 2 A ) . Spa1 - express - ing T cells did not adhere in response to soluble SLC treat - ment . PMA - stimulated adhesion was not affected in Spa1 - expressing cells , indicating that Spa1 specifically inhibits chemokine - induced adhesion ( Fig . 2 A ) . We also examined the induction of lymphocyte attach - ment by immobilized SLC and the effect of Spa1 on this Figure 1 . Chemokine - induced Rap1 activation in lymphocytes . ( A ) Rap1 activation by SLC . LN cells were treated with 100 nM SLC for the indicated time ( min ) . GTP - bound Rap1 was detected with pull - down assays using GST – RalGDS – RBD ( top ) . Total Rap1 is shown ( bottom ) . ( B ) PTX treatment prevented Rap1 activation . LN cells were cultured for 2 h in 50 ng / ml of PTX , then stimulated with 100 nM SLC for 30 s and analyzed for Rap1 activation as above ( A ) . ( C ) Spa1 - inhibited Rap1 activation . Lymphocytes infected with an adenovirus encoding GFP alone ( control ) or Spa1 ( Spa1 ) were stimulated with either 100 nM SLC or 100 nM SDF - 1 for 30 s and analyzed for Rap1 activation as above . Infection efficiencies as indicated by GFP expression were (cid:2) 80 % . Rap1 activation was reduced to 20 % of the control levels , as estimated by an image analyzer ( model LAS1000 ; Fuji ) . on J une 22 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 21 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Roles of Rap1 in adhesion / migration by chemokines | Shimonaka et al . 419 process . ICAM - 1 – coated discs were pretreated with SLC ; unbound SLC was removed by washing . Adenovirus - infected lymphocytes were loaded into the flow chamber and incubated for the time indicated before application of shear stress . Immobilized SLC also triggered rapid , transient adhesion to ICAM - 1 , comparable to that induced by soluble SLC ( Fig . 2 B ) . Spa1 inhibited the adhesion to ICAM - 1 induced by immobilized SLC . Thus , Spa1 expression in - hibited adhesion triggered by both soluble and immobi - lized SLC . Furthermore , we examined the effect of Spa1 inhibition of Rap1 on the arrest of rolling lymphocytes in under - flow ad - hesion assays using a mouse endothelial cell line , BC1 ( Tat - suta et al . , 1992 ) . Pretreatment of BC1 with SDF - 1 drasti - cally increased firm adhesion of rolling lymphocytes to the BC1 monolayer ( Fig . 2 C ) , as seen with human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVEC ; Cinamon et al . , 2001 ) . Firm attachment was significantly inhibited by treatment with antibodies against either LFA - 1 or ICAM - 1 . Spa1 expression abrogated firm adhesion of rolling T cells . Conversely , expression of a constitutively activated Rap1 ( Rap1V12 ) in T cells increased adhesion to immobilized ICAM - 1 ( see following paragraph ) and induced T cell arrest on endothelial cells in the absence of SDF - 1 ( Fig . 2 C ) . However , neither Spa1 nor Rap1V12 expression in T cells affected rolling or tethering adhesion on BC1 monolayers ( unpublished data ) . These results suggest that Rap1 activa - tion is both necessary and sufficient for chemokine - induced T cell arrest on endothelial layers via the LFA - 1 – ICAM - 1 interaction . Activation of Rap1 induced robust cell migration on immobilized ICAM - 1 Next , we examined the effect of Rap1V12 on T cell adhe - sion and migration . Rap1V12 expression in primary T cells increased adhesion to ICAM - 1 ( Fig . 3 A ) , as previously seen for T cell clones ( Katagiri et al . , 2002 ) or lymphocytes de - rived from Rap1V12 - transgenic mice ( Sebzda et al . , 2002 ) . Surprisingly , Rap1V12 also stimulated robust cell migration on ICAM - 1 , comparable to that seen after SLC stimulation ( Fig . 3 B ) . Rap1V12 - expressing cells moved on ICAM - 1 as Figure 2 . Lymphocyte adhesion under shear stress . ( A ) SLC - stimulated adhesion to immobilized ICAM - 1 . Lymphocytes infected with the control or Spa1 - encoding adenovirus were incubated in the absence or presence of either 100nM SLC or 10 ng / ml PMA , at 37 (cid:4) C for the indicated time on ICAM - 1 , and then washed with shear stress at 2 dyne / cm 2 for 1 min . Attachment of SLC - stimulated control cells treated with anti - LFA - 1 or anti - ICAM - 1 antibody is also indicated at the 10 - min time point . Quantitated numbers of GFP - positive attached cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of the input GFP - positive cells . PMA - stimulated attachment is indicated for the 10 - and 20 - min time points . The data are representative of three independent experiments . ( B ) Spa - 1 – inhibited lymphocyte adhesion triggered by immobilized SLC . ICAM - 1 – coated disks were pretreated with 100 nM SLC . Unbound SLC was removed by washing . Lymphocytes infected with either the control or Spa1 adenovirus were incubated on uncoated or SLC - coated ICAM - 1 discs at 37 (cid:4) C for the indicated time and then washed with shear stress at 2 dyne / cm 2 for 1 min . GFP - positive attached cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of the input GFP - positive cells . The data are representative of three independent experiments . ( C ) Attachment of lymphocytes to endothelial cells under flow . Lymphocytes infected with adenoviruses encoding GFP alone ( control ) , Spa1 , or Rap1V12 adenovirus were perfused over a BC1 endothelial monolayer over - laid with 100 nM SDF - 1 under shear stress ( 0 . 1 dyne / cm 2 ) for 10 min . The effect of antibody blocking of LFA - 1 or ICAM - 1 was shown for lymphocytes infected with the control adenovirus . Lymphocytes that rolled away or attached throughout the shear stress phase were considered as “roll - away” ( open bar ) and “firm attachment” ( closed bar ) , respectively . These categories were expressed as a percentage of total interacting cells , including rolling , transiently attached , and firmly attached cells . Adenovirus - infected cells , suspended at 2 (cid:5) 10 6 / ml were perfused into the flow chamber . Approximately 60 – 70 GFP - positive cells were captured by the BC1 monolayer during a 10 - min perfusion ( per high power field , 440 (cid:5) 440 (cid:6) m , magnification 20 ) . Data means and SE were determined from four independent experiments with SE .

PMA treatment increased adhesion levels , but did not stimulate migration ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , in contrast to the stimulatory effect of Rap1 on both adhesion and migration . Then , we compared the Rap1V12 promigratory effect with other Ras / Rho family GTPases . We used a proB cell line , BAF / 3 , reconstituted with human LFA - 1 ( BAF / LFA - 1 ; Kata - giri et al . , 2000 ) , which endogenously expresses CXCR4 and migrates on immobilized ICAM - 1 in response to SDF - 1 stimulation ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Rap1V12 expression in BAF / LFA - 1 stimulated both adhesion and migration ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) at a migratory speed of 15 (cid:6) m / min , comparable to that induced by SDF - 1 . Introduction of constitutively activated Rap2A , Rac , Cdc42 , Rho , or H - Ras had little or small stimulatory effect on adhesion . Previously , we demon - strated that mild stimulation of adhesion by Rac1V12 and H - RasV12 required PI3K activity ( Katagiri et al . , 2000 ) . However , none of these GTPases , with the exception of Rap1V12 , enhanced cell migration . Thus , Rap1 has unique characteristics facilitating both adhesion and migration . Activation of Rap1 also induced VLA - 4 – dependent adhesion and migration on immobilized VCAM - 1 We also examined the involvement of Rap1 activation in chemokine - induced VLA - 4 – dependent adhesion to vascu - lar cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) . Soluble SLC in - duced shear - resistant adhesion of lymphocytes to immo - bilized VCAM - 1 , which was blocked by treatment with either anti - VLA - 4 or anti - VCAM - 1 antibodies ( Fig . 5 A ) . Spa1 expression greatly reduced SLC - stimulated adhesion to VCAM - 1 ( Fig . 5 A ) . Conversely , Rap1V12 expression in T cells increased adhesion to VCAM - 1 ( Fig . 5 A ) , as reported in Jurkat cells ( Reedquist et al . , 2000 ) . As is the case of LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 , Rap1V12 stimulated lymphocyte motility on VCAM - 1 , the velocity of which was comparable to that stimulated with SLC on VCAM - 1 ( Fig . 5 B ; Videos 3 and 4 ) . The migration velocity of Rap1V12 - expressing lympho - cytes on VCAM - 1 was similar to that on ICAM - 1 ( Fig . 3 B ) . The cell motility on VCAM - 1 stimulated by SLC was Figure 3 . Random cell migration on ICAM - 1 . ( A ) Adhesion of T cells on immobilized mouse ICAM - 1 – Fc . The adhesion of T cells infected with control adenovirus ( control ) stimulated with either 100 nM SLC or 10 ng / ml PMA and Rap1V12 - expressing T cells ( Rap1V12 ) are shown . Adhesion to ICAM - 1 was (cid:7) 10 % in the presence of anti - LFA - 1 or anti - ICAM - 1 antibodies . The mean and SE of triplicate determinations are shown .

The mean velocity of GFP - positive cells ( n (cid:8) 20 ) was calculated and indicated with SE . Figure 4 .

BAF / LFA - 1 cells expressing constitutively activated small GTPases were measured for adhesion on immobilized human ICAM - 1 – Fc . BAF / LFA - 1 trans - fected with vector alone ( vector ) were stimulated with 20 nM SDF - 1 and measured as in Fig . 3 . The mean and SE of triplicate determinations are shown . ( B ) Effects of the Ras / Rho family on the migration of BAF / LFA - 1 on ICAM - 1 . BAF / LFA - 1 cells expressing constitutively activated small GTPases were measured for migration on immobilized human ICAM - 1 – Fc as described in Materials and methods . BAF / LFA - 1 transfected with vector alone ( vector ) were stimulated with 20 nM SDF - 1 . on J une 22 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 21 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Roles of Rap1 in adhesion / migration by chemokines | Shimonaka et al . 421 abrogated by Spa - 1 expression ( Fig . 5 B ) . Together , these re - sults indicate that Rap1 mediates proadhesive and promigra - tory effects of SLC through VLA - 4 / VCAM - 1 . Rap1 stimulates transmigration of lymphocytes under shear flow Next , we examined the role of the promigratory effect of Rap1 on transendothelial migration under shear stress using an MBEC4 endothelial cell line . LN cells infected with ei - ther control or Spa1 - encoding adenovirus were incubated with MBEC4 monolayers in the presence or absence of SLC for the indicated times ( 1 , 5 , and 10 min ) . 20 min of shear stress ( 2 dyne / cm 2 ) was then applied . SLC stimulated shear - resistant adhesion of T cells infected with control adeno - virus , enhancing transmigration as early as 1 min ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . The adhesion and transmigration levels were aug - mented by increasing the period of SLC incubation , with the maximal transmigration level ( 55 % of input cells ) at the 10 - min time point . The transmigration efficiency reached (cid:2) 70 % of the attached cells under these conditions ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . However , in the absence of shear flow , no lympho - cytes transmigrated through the MBEC4 monolayer , dem - onstrating shear - stress dependency of lymphocyte transmi - gration , as seen for HUVECs ( Cinamon et al . , 2001 ) . Experiments using soluble or immobilized SDF - 1 stimula - tion demonstrated similar results , but possessed very low efficiencies of adhesion and transmigration through the MBEC4 monolayer ( unpublished data ) . Spa1 expression in lymphocytes reduced SLC - induced adhesion and transmi - gration to basal levels ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Conversely , Rap1V12 expression in T cells augmented both adhesion and transmigration under flow in the absence of SLC ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . The rate of transmigration without shear flow was (cid:7) 10 % at any time points measured ( unpublished data ) , indicating that Rap1V12 - expressing T cells still requires shear stress for efficient transmigration . The time course and efficiency of Rap1V12 - expressing T cell transmigration was similar to those of SLC - stimulated cells ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . These results indicate that Rap1 rapidly induces firm attach - ment and enhances transmigration , which is consistent with the Rap1 effect on integrin - dependent adhesion and migra - tion ( Fig . 3 and Fig . 5 ) . PMA stimulated attachment to en - dothelial cells , but failed to induce transmigration under flow ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Although treatment with PTX re - duced SLC - stimulated adhesion and transmigration to basal levels , the transmigration induced by Rap1V12 was unaf - fected ( Fig . 6 C ) . Time - lapse images exhibit the active mi - gration of SLC - stimulated or Rap1V12 - expressing lympho - cytes over the endothelium before transmigration under shear stress ( Fig . 7 ) . In contrast , PMA - stimulated lympho - cytes adhered to the endothelium were not motile ( Fig . 7 ) . These results paralleled those obtained for adhesion and mi - gration on immobilized ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 ( Fig . 3 and Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that cell migration enhancement by Rap1 is crucial for transmigration . Rap1 activation triggers cell polarization Chemokines induce a polarized cell morphology and induce the redistribution of chemokine receptors to the leading edge ( Nieto et al . , 1997 ; Gomez - Mouton et al . , 2001 ) and intercellular adhesion molecules , including CD44 ( del Pozo et al . , 1995 ) , to the uropod . As leukocyte polarization plays an important role in rapid directional movement , we exam - ined the effect of Rap1 activation on this process . Rap1V12 expressing BAF / LFA - 1 cells , fixed in suspension , demon - strated a polarized cell shape with a morphologically - defined leading edge and a uropod ; control cells were round in shape ( Fig . 8 ) . The polarized cell shape was examined with CXCR4 and CD44 , leading edge and uropod markers , re - spectively . Compared with homogenous or intermingled distribution in nonpolarized control cells , CXCR4 and CD44 were segregated , concentrating at the leading edge and uropod , respectively . A similar polarization phenotype concurrent with the redistribution of cell surface receptors was also seen on stimulation with SDF - 1 ( Fig . 8 ) . Spa1 ex - pression completely suppressed the polarized phenotype in - duced by SDF - 1 . These results suggest that Rap1 activation by chemokines induces cell polarization . Figure 5 . Cell adhesion and migration on VCAM - 1 . ( A ) SLC - stimulated adhesion to immobilized VCAM - 1 – Fc . Lymphocytes infected with the control , Spa1 - , and Rap1V12 - encoding adenovirus were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nM SLC at 37 (cid:4) C for 10 min on VCAM - 1 , and then washed with shear stress at 2 dyne / cm 2 for 1 min . Attachment of SLC - stimulated control cells treated with anti - VLA - 4 or anti - VCAM - 1 antibody is also indicated . The numbers of GFP - positive attached cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of the input GFP - positive cells . The mean and SE of triplicate determinations are shown . ( B ) Migration velocity of T cells on immobilized VCAM - 1 – Fc . Migration velocity of T cells infected with control or Spa - 1 adenovirus stimulated with or without 100 nM SLC and Rap1V12 - expressing T cells are shown .

When stimulated with SLC or SDF - 1 , lymphocytes were transformed into polarized cell shapes with well - devel - oped leading edges and uropods marked by CXCR4 and CD44 , respectively ( Fig . 9 A ) . Control adenovirus - infected lymphocytes , indicated by GFP expression , were similarly transformed by SLC into a polarized cell shape with the de - velopment of CD44 - marked uropods ( Fig . 9 C ) . Quan - titative analysis indicated that (cid:2) 60 % of stimulated cells exhibited this polarized phenotype ( Fig . 9 B ) . Rap1V12 ex - pression , also indicated by GFP expression , markedly in - creased the number of polarized lymphocytes with CD44 - marked uropods ( Fig . 9 , B and C ) , comparable to the levels induced by SLC . Conversely , Spa1 expression reduced the number of SLC - stimulated polarized lymphocytes exhibit - ing an asymmetric redistribution of CD44 to basal levels ( Fig . 9 , B and C ) . Collectively , these results indicate that Rap1 activation triggers lymphocyte polarization even in nonadherent lymphocytes . Thus , Rap1 - mediated cell polar - ization triggered by chemokines does not depend on inte - grin - mediated adhesion . Discussion Our report is the first to demonstrate the requisite involve - ment of Rap1 in chemokine - stimulated integrin activation and transendothelial migration . Our work reveals that Rap1 is associated with chemokine - mediated rapid integrin activa - tion , enhancement of cell migration , and cell polarization in lymphocytes . These characteristics of Rap1 , not observed for other Ras / Rho GTPases , likely contribute in the induction of lymphocyte extravasation and tissue migration in re - sponse to chemokines . Integrin adhesiveness is regulated by ligand binding affin - ity and / or lateral mobility / clustering ( avidity ; van Kooyk and Figdor , 2000 ) . Previous studies indicated that chemo - kines ( SDF - 1 , SLC , and EBII - ligand chemokine ) regulate LFA - 1 adhesive activity by modulating avidity and affinity of LFA - 1 , and demonstrated the existence of a PI3K - inde - pendent pathway responsible for the attachment of lympho - cytes to high density ICAM - 1 molecules or high endothelial venules ( Constantin et al . , 2000 ) . Rap1V12 up - regulates soluble ICAM - 1 – Fc binding and a conformational epitope associated with the high affinity state of LFA - 1 ( Katagiri et Figure 6 . Attachment and transmigration of T cells . ( A ) Attachment of T cells to MBEC4 endothelial cells under flow . T cells infected with adenoviruses encoding either GFP alone ( cont ) , Spa1 , or Rap1V12 were incubated with or without either 100 nM SLC or 10 ng / ml PMA for 1 , 5 , and 10 min on MBEC4 monolayers pretreated with TNF (cid:3) for 24 h . Shear stress was then applied at 2 dyne / cm 2 for 20 min . In the absence of TNF (cid:3) pretreatment , lymphocyte adherence to MBEC4 endothelial cells was (cid:7) 10 % of the input cells ( not depicted ) . Loaded cell numbers were 2 (cid:5) 10 6 and (cid:2) 100 – 120 GFP - positive cells per microscopic field ( 440 (cid:5) 440 (cid:6) m ) were accumulated on the MBEC monolayers at each time point . Shear - resistant attach - ment to the endothelial cells was reduced to less than a half of normal levels after blocking with mAb specific for LFA - 1 or VLA - 4 . Treatment with both antibodies further reduced cell numbers to (cid:2) 15 % of normal levels .

These findings support the notion that Rap1 plays an essential role in chemokine - induced lymphocyte ad - hesion . Although both Rap1 and PI3K (cid:9) are thought to function in chemokine - stimulated integrin activation , we did not find a significant effect of PI3K inhibitors on lym - phocyte attachment and transmigration through endothelial layers in our experimental system . The relative contribution of these signaling pathways may vary according to the ex - pression levels of Rap1 and PI3K (cid:9) in leukocytes and the density of ICAM - 1 on endothelial cells . Our work demonstrates that Rap1 is the major inside - out signal for LFA - 1 and VLA - 4 by chemokines , thus playing a critical role in lymphocyte attachment to immobilized ICAM - 1 , VCAM - 1 , and endothelial cells under flow . Rap1 activation by chemokines occurs in seconds , which is fol - lowed by the integrin - triggering effect of Rap1 in a minute . Thus , the integrin - triggering effect of Rap1 occurs within a time window of chemokine - induced conversion of rolling lymphocytes to firm arrest . It has recently been shown that endothelial chemokines also trigger earlier VLA - 4 – medi - ated capture by subsecond modulation of integrin avidity ( Grabovsky et al . , 2000 ) . We showed the requisite involve - ment of Rap1 in lymphocyte arrest under the suboptimal shear stress ( 0 . 1 dyne / cm 2 ) . Our experimental system failed to support efficient lymphocyte rolling or tethering at a higher shear stress ( 1 – 5 dyne / cm 2 ) . This precludes us from examining whether Rap1 is also involved in extremely rapid integrin modulation . Therefore , it is still an open question of whether Rap1 could function as a subsecond integrin modulator in lymphocyte arrest . It is also possible that Rap1 activation by apical endothelial chemokines could convert transient lymphocyte attachment to shear - resistant adhesion necessary for the later progression to lymphocyte transen - dothelial migration . The Rho family of small GTPases regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements underlying morphological transformations such as lamellipodia , filopodia , and focal adhesion ( Hall , 1998 ) . These signal transducers likely contribute to leuko - cyte adhesion and migration through such rearrangements , but little is known about their contributions to rapid inte - grin activation after chemokine stimulation . Rho was previ - ously reported to be involved in IL - 8 – induced adhesion of leukocytes via VLA - 4 and Mac1 ( Laudanna et al . , 1996 ) . However , it remains to be determined whether Rho modu - lates either integrin affinity or clustering . Rac1 was reported to regulate integrin - mediated spreading in T cells , resulting in the enhancement of cell adhesion without affecting inte - grin affinity ( D’Souza - Schorey et al . , 1998 ) . In BAF / LFA - 1 cells , Rac1V12 , Cdc42V12 , and RhoV14 expression stimu - lates membrane ruffling , dendrite extension , or cell round - ing , respectively ( unpublished data ) . However , these GTP - Figure 7 . Time - lapse images of transendothelial migration under flow .

Recent work by McLeod and col - leagues showed both Rap1 and Rap2 activation after SDF - 1 stimulation of B cell lines and the expression of RapGAPII inhibited chemotaxis toward SDF - 1 in Transwell assays us - ing bare membranes ( McLeod et al . , 2002 ) . It was not clear from this paper whether Rap1 and Rap2 are critically in - volved in integrin - mediated adhesion and migration in - duced by chemokines . Although this work could identify a stimulatory effect of Rap2 on chemotaxis , our work could not identify an effect of constitutively active Rap2 on LFA - 1 activation and migration on immobilized ICAM - 1 . Rap2 likely acts in a manner unrelated to integrin - mediated adhe - sion and migration . Thus , our work indicates the unique ability of Rap1 to rapidly trigger LFA - 1 activation on chemokine stimulation . Leukocyte emigration from the bloodstream across the microvessel wall into tissues is an essential step in the in - flammatory response and lymphocyte homing . This process is based on robust leukocyte cell motility . In addition to an effect on integrin triggering , our paper demonstrates a promigratory effect of Rap1 on lymphocytes . Rap1V12 ex - pression stimulated lymphocyte motility on ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 at similar levels observed for chemokine stimula - tion . Cell migration requires the coordination of front ad - hesion and rear de - adhesion . Detachment of the cell rear of Rap1V12 - or SDF - 1 – stimulated migratory cells was im - paired by mutation of the tyrosine - based endocytosis motif of the (cid:2) 2 integrin subunit ( Tohyama et al . , 2003 ) .

Control adenovirus - infected lymphocytes exhibited a homogeneous distribution of CD44 without typical uropods .

Therefore , firm attachment does not necessarily hamper cell migration . Our paper demon - strates that the activation of Rap1 induces both integrin - mediated cell adhesion as well as migration . Chemokines critical for T cell homing such as SLC are dis - tributed on the apical side of high endothelial venule ( Stein et al . , 2000 ; Warnock et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , it is unlikely that a chemokine gradient across the endothelium stimulates trans - migration of T cells in vivo . Retention of chemokines on the apical side is instrumental both to prevent dilution of che - mokines by the flowing blood and to restrict the site of lym - phocyte emigration . Our work indicated that both soluble chemokines and Rap1V12 expression were able to trigger initial arrest and promote subsequent diapedesis . Thus , a chemokine gradient is not necessarily required for transen - dothelial migration , which is in agreement with other works ( Cinamon et al . , 2001 ; Cuvelier and Patel , 2001 ) . Our paper suggests that haptokinesis , rather than chemo - taxis , is important for transmigration . We showed in this paper that Rap1V12 expression in lymphocytes induced ro - bust cell motility and transmigration without exogenous chemokines . PTX treatment did not inhibit transmigration of Rap1V12 - expressing lymphocytes , excluding the possi - bility that Rap1 enhances transmigration by promoting en - dogenous PTX - sensitive Gi machineries . The transmigra - tion stimulated by soluble chemokines and Rap1V12 still required the application of shear stress , consistent with results observed for lymphocyte transmigration through chemokine - immobilized HUVEC layers ( Cinamon et al . , 2001 ) . This result suggests that chemokine activation of Rap1 and shear activation of transmigration are two separa - ble and probably sequential processes . Shear stress depen - dency of transmigration implies that shear - induced mecha - notransduction in lymphocytes and / or endothelial cells is required in addition to Rap1 signaling . Alternatively , shear stress may induce cell deformation , helping to redirect free membrane protrusions at the leading edge to junctions in the endothelium . Given the presence of chemokines on the apical side of the endothelium , it is feasible that attached lymphocytes are stimulated by chemokines to migrate over endothelial cells under the control of the Rap1 promigratory signal , as seen in our work . When migrating lymphocytes reach intercellu - lar junctions , they begin diapedesis between tightly apposed endothelial cells . Although the detailed process of diapedesis is still unclear , several adhesion molecules of the immuno - globulin superfamily , including CD31 , CD99 ( Schenkel et al . , 2002 ) , and JAM - 1 ( Martin - Padura et al . , 1998 ; Oster - mann et al . , 2002 ) that are concentrated at endothelial junc - tions , have been reported to play a critical role in leukocyte transmigration . Antibody cross - linking of CD31 and CD99 on leukocytes also activates LFA - 1 and VLA - 4 , acting through Rap1 signaling in the case of CD31 ( Hahn et al . , 1997 ; Reedquist et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , it is conceivable that chemokines and junctional adhesion molecules sequentially activate Rap1 , stimulating haptotactic migration through endothelial cell layers . The acquisition of front - rear polarity is critical for cell migration . Chemokines induce lymphocyte polarization , associated with the development of both a leading edge and uropod . The polarized characteristics induced by chemo - kines and Rap1V12 are indistinguishable in terms of both morphology and cell surface receptor distribution , and ap - pear to be inherent to lymphocytes because it occurs with - out the spatial cues such as adhesion or chemokine gradi - ents . Many lines of evidence indicate that the Rho family of GTPases is involved in leukocyte chemotaxis through cy - toskeletal remodeling and cell polarity ( Sanchez - Madrid and del Pozo , 1999 ; Worthylake and Burridge , 2001 ) . Constitutively activated Rac1 , Cdc42 , or Rho failed to stimulate cell polarization and migration in our system . This result is consistent with previous reports demonstrat - ing their inhibitory effects on both CSF - 1 – stimulated mac - rophage chemotactic migration ( Allen et al . , 1998 ) and lymphocyte polarization ( del Pozo et al . , 1999 ) . As yet , no constitutively active Ras / Rho family GTPases , with the ex - ception of Rap1 , have been reported to stimulated lympho - cyte polarization and migration , suggesting a unique func - tion for Rap1 in lymphocyte polarization and migration . The relationship of Rap1 with cell polarity determination and migration was previously indicated from studies in yeast ( Chant and Stowers , 1995 ) and flies ( Asha et al . , 1999 ) . In budding yeast , Bud1 ( closest homologue to Rap1 ) determines the bud site by recruiting polarity - deter - mining factors , such as Cdc42 and Cdc24 ( a guanine ex - change factor for Cdc42 ; Gulli and Peter , 2001 ) . However , Rap1 does not directly activate Cdc42 or Rac in lymphoid cells ( unpublished data ) . There is little evidence indicating a pathway triggered by chemokines inducing the hierarchi - cal activation of GTPases . Chemokines may activate Rap1 and Rho family GTPases in parallel . It is also conceivable that Rap1 may control spatial regulation of Rho family GTPases and regulatory proteins , as implied from studies in budding yeast . Our paper demonstrates the critical contributions of Rap1 to integrin activation , enhancement of integrin - mediated migration , and cell polarization , resulting in chemokine - triggered lymphocyte transmigration . The unexpected rela - tionship between integrin triggering and cell polarization and migration suggests that Rap1 governs not only integrins , but also lymphocyte migration machinery . The mechanism by which Rap1 accomplishes this task awaits further study . In particular , the identification of Rap1 effector molecules is crucial to clarify whether Rap1 controls these biological ef - fects through single or multiple biochemical events , which will provide important information facilitating a better over - all understanding of Rap1 function .

Active GTP - bound Rap1 was measured using a GST – RalGDS – RBD fusion protein as de - scribed previously ( Franke et al . , 1997 ) . Spa1 or Rap1V12 expression in lymphocytes via adenovirus Spa1 and Rap1V12 were expressed in lymphocytes using adenoviruses produced according to the manufacturer’s instruction ( AdEasy TM adeno - viral vector system ; Stratagene ) . LN cells from transgenic mice carrying the adenovirus receptor expressed in T cells ( Wan et al . , 2000 ) were infected with recombinant adenoviruses , cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS and 50 (cid:6) M 2 - ME with 20 (cid:6) g / ml 2C11 for 2 h , and then with 5 U IL - 2 for 36 h . Infection efficiencies were estimated by lymphocyte GFP expres - sion levels with FACSCalibur™ ( Becton Dickinson ) . Greater than 80 % of the lymphocytes constantly expressed GFP .

H - Ras , Rac , and Rho were described previously ( Kata - giri et al . , 2000 ) . Adhesion to immobilized ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 SLC - induced adhesion to ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 was measured at 37 (cid:4) C in a parallel plate flow chamber ( FCS2 system ; Bioptechs ) . 0 . 1 (cid:6) g / ml recom - binant mouse ICAM - 1 ( Katagiri et al . , 2002 ) and 0 . 05 (cid:6) g / ml VCAM - 1 hu - man IgG1 - Fc was coated on polystyrene disks that were then blocked with 1 % BSA . For production of recombinant mouse VCAM - 1 , the first three immunoglobulin domains ( aa 1 – 309 ) of mouse VCAM - 1 was ob - tained from lung mRNA by RT - PCR , and a fusion protein of this fragment and human IgG1 - Fc was generated essentially as described previously ( Katagiri et al . , 2002 ) . The flow chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted confocal laser microscope ( model LSM510 , Carl Zeiss MicroIm - aging , Inc . ) . Shear stress was generated with an automated syringe pump ( Harvard Apparatus ) . 2 (cid:5) 10 6 cells suspended in 500 (cid:6) l Lefkovitz L15 medium ( GIBCO BRL ) containing 0 . 5 % BSA were loaded with or without 100 nM SLC ( R & D systems ) and were incubated for the indicated time be - fore applying shear stress at 2 dyne / cm 2 . Phase - contrast and GFP fluores - cence images were recorded and processed to count cells using Image - Pro ® Plus software ( Media Cybernetics ) . Under - flow adhesion and transmigration assays with endothelial cells Mouse endothelial cells , BC1 and MBEC4 ( Tatsuta et al . , 1992 ) , were cul - tured on fibronectin - coated disks for 2 d . The BC1 and MBEC4 monolayers were pretreated with TNF (cid:3) for the last 6 and 24 h , respectively . The cul - tured disk was set in the flow chamber as described above . For lymphocyte attachment under flow , the BC1 monolayer was preincubated with SDF - 1 for 10 min and then washed . Lymphocytes were resuspended at 2 (cid:5) 10 6 / ml in Lefkovitz L15 medium containing 5 % FCS , and then loaded into the chamber under shear stress at 0 . 1 dyne / cm 2 for 10 min . For transmigration , an MBEC4 endothelial cell line was used because MBEC4 efficiently sup - ports transmigration , when compared with BC1 and other mouse endothe - lial cells . Because lymphocyte rolling on the MBEC4 monolayer treated with TNF (cid:3) for 24 h was insufficient for lymphocyte accumulation , lympho - cytes were loaded into the flow chamber with or without SLC , and incu - bated on the endothelial monolayer for 1 , 5 , and 10 min . Then , shear stress was applied at 2 dyne / cm 2 for 20 min . Phase - contrast and GFP fluores - cence images were recorded every 10 s . The GFP - positive cells that re - mained firmly adherent were scored for attachment . The GFP - positive cells that became phase - dark from phase - light during migration over the endo - thelial monolayer were scored for transmigration . Cell migration assays Random cell migration was recorded at 37 (cid:4) C with a culture dish system for live - cell microscopy ( (cid:10) T culture dish system ; Bioptechs ) . 0 . 1 (cid:6) g / ml mouse and human ICAM - 1 – Fc , and 0 . 05 mg / ml mouse VCAM - 1 – Fc were coated on thermoglass - based dishes ( Bioptechs ) . Cells were loaded in the ICAM - 1 – Fc – or VCAM - 1 – Fc – coated dish and mounted on an inverted confocal laser microscope ( model LSM510 , Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) . Phase - contrast and GFP fluorescence images were taken every 15 s for 20 min . GFP - positive cells were traced and calculated for velocity using ImagePro ® Plus software ( Media Cybernetics ) . Immunofluorescent staining BAF / LFA - 1 or adenovirus - infected T cells were fixed with 3 . 3 % PFA for 15 min at RT . Fixed cells were mounted on poly - L - lysine – coated slides . For double staining , fixed cells were first stained with 1 (cid:6) g / ml SDF - 1 – Fc , fol - lowed by FITC - conjugated goat anti – human IgG ( 1 : 100 dilution ) . Then , CD44 was detected by rat anti – mouse CD44 mAb ( 1 : 50 dilution ; BD Bio - sciences ) , followed by Alexa ® 546 conjugate goat anti – rat IgG ( 1 : 400 dilu - tion ; Molecular Probes , Inc . ) . Cells were incubated with each antibody for 1 h , and unbound antibodies were removed by washing with PBS / 0 . 1 % BSA five times .
