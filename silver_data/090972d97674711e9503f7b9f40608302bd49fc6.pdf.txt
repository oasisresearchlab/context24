Methods Two hundred and five stages II – III CRC patients were included in this study . Formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded specimens were stained for cortactin and the correlation between the staining , its clinicopathological parameters , and its prognostic power were analyzed statistically . Results Of the 205 patients studied , 113 cases ( 55 . 1 % ) were strongly positive for cortactin . Cortactin expression correlated with tumor invasion ( P = 0 . 018 ) , histological grade ( P = 0 . 004 ) , and preoperative CEA level ( P < 0 . 001 ) . In univariate analysis , tumor invasion , American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) stage , lymphovascular invasion , preoperative CEA level , and cortactin expression were significant prognostic factors for disease - free survival ( P = 0 . 034 , 0 . 009 , 0 . 043 , 0 . 004 , and 0 . 004 , respectively ) , while for overall survival , tumor invasion , AJCC stage , pathologic grade , preoperative CEA level , and cortactin expression were significant prognostic factors ( P = 0 . 003 , 0 . 008 , 0 . 038 , 0 . 017 , and < 0 . 001 , respectively ) . In multivariate analysis , tumor invasion , preoperative CEA level , and cortactin expression maintained their independent prognostic influence on disease - free survival ( P = < 0 . 001 , 0 . 003 , and 0 . 008 , respectively ) . However , tumor invasion , AJCC stage , and cortactin expression influenced overall survival ( P = 0 . 036 , < 0 . 001 , and 0 . 004 , respectively ) . Conclusions Cortactin may be a good biomarker to be applied in the clinical setting to predict the prognosis of patients with completely resected pathologic stages II – III CRC . Keywords Colorectal adenocarcinoma . Cortactin . Prognosis Introduction Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the three leading causes of cancer - related death among men and women worldwide . 1 It is estimated that in 2008 , approximately 149 , 000 new cases of CRC will be diagnosed in the USA . 2 Even among patients who undergo potentially curative resection alone , 40 % to 50 % of them ultimately relapse and die of metastatic disease . 3 Although tumor - nodes - metastasis ( TNM ) classifi - cation is useful for staging colorectal cancer patients and selecting them for specific treatment , 4 it is not sufficient , as many patients at the same stage may have various outcomes , indicating that the conventional staging procedures may be The authors have no commercial , proprietary , or financial interest in the products or companies described in this article .

Cortactin is an actin - binding protein that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to regulate the actin cytoskeleton 6 and inhibits debranching of dendritic actin networks . 7 Cortactin is overexpressed in many types of human cancers , including head and neck and esophageal squamous carcinomas , colorectal , gastric , hepatocellular , breast and ovarian can - cers . 8 Most frequently , cortactin overexpression occurs through chromosomal amplification of the 11q13 region , such as breast , 9 head / neck carcinomas , 10 and gastric adeno - carcinoma , 11 however , overexpression has also been reported in tumors without that amplification . 12 , 13 Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton has effects on cell migration , motility , and adhesion , as well as on tumor invasion and metastasis . 6 In some studies , overexpression of cortactin correlated with histological differentiation , T and N stage in gastric cancer , 11 depth of invasion in colorectal cancer , 14 as well as poor prognosis for patients with lymph node metastasis . 9 , 10 , 15 However , the prognostic significance of cortactin status in patients with CRC remains controversial . Thus , the present study was designed to specifically investigate the clinico - pathological role of expression of cortactin , as well as the correlation with clinical outcomes in stages II – III CRC . Materials and Methods Patient Management and Follow - up Two hundred and five consecutive , unselected , stages II – III CRC patients were seen at our department from March 1996 to March 2000 . The histologic sections were reviewed by two expert pathologists ( X . J . and Y . Z . ) to verify the histologic diagnosis . All patients underwent curative - intent surgery for stages II – III CRC ( according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) criteria ) . No patients with rectal cancer received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in this study . All excised specimens were formalin - fixed and sliced at 10 - mm intervals . Therapeutic strategies were applied according to stage of disease and presumed risk of relapse . Patients with stage II disease underwent follow - up based on history , physical examination , complete blood count , liver function tests , ultrasound scan of the abdomen , and carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) monitoring every 3 months . Total body computed tomography scan and colonoscopy were done once a year . Patients with stage II high - risk disease ( pT4 and / or gross volume tumors , perforation , obstruction , poorly differentiated histology , long - lasting symptoms , elevated CEA preoperatively , blood or lymphatic vessel invasion ) were encouraged to undergo six cycles of fluorouracil - based adjuvant chemotherapy . If no contraindications were present , patients with stage III disease underwent six cycles of fluorouracil - based adjuvant chemotherapy , then were followed up . One hundred forty - four patients received fluorouracil - based adjuvant chemo - therapy . Sixty - one ( 49 . 2 % ) patients with stage II did not receive adjuvant interventions . This study was approved by the local ethical committees . Immunohistochemistry Tissue microarray sections were de - waxed in xylene , rehy - drated in alcohol , and immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 min to suppress endogenous peroxidase activity . Antigen retrieval was performed by heating ( 100°C ) each section for 30 min in 0 . 01 mol / L sodium citrate buffer ( pH6 . 0 ) . After three rinses ( each for 5 min in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ) , sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a polyclonal rabbit anti - human cortactin ( clone H - 191 ) antibody ( 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) diluted in PBS . After three washes ( each for 5 min in PBS ) , sections were incubated with biotin - labeled secondary immunoglobulin ( 1 : 100 , DAKO , Glostrup , Denmark ) for 1 h Fig . 1 Strong cortactin ( A , ×200 ; B , ×400 ) immunostaining in colon adenocarcinoma . J Gastrointest Surg ( 2010 ) 14 : 1248 – 1257 1249 at room temperature . After three additional washes , peroxi - dase activity was developed with diaminobenzidine ( DAB ; DAKO , Glostrup , Denmark ) at room temperature . The immunostaining intensity was separately evaluated by two pathologists ( X . J . and Y . Z . ) who had no knowledge of the patients ' clinical status . For cortactin expression , samples were classified into two groups , positive group or negative / weak group . At least 200 tumor cells were scored per ×40 field . All sections were scored in a semiquantitative manner according to the method described previously , which reflects both the intensity and percentage of cells staining at each intensity . 16 Intensity was classified as 0 ( no staining ) , + 1 ( weak staining ) , + 2 ( distinct staining ) , or + 3 ( very strong staining ) .

Expression of cortactin was classified as follows : when ≥ 30 % of the carcinoma cells in a given specimen were positively stained for cortactin , the sample was classified as cortactin positive . Statistical Analysis Correlations between clinicopathological factors and cortactin expression were analyzed using Fisher ’ s exact probability test or χ 2 test . Survival was calculated by the Kaplan – Meier method , and differences in survival were determined by the log - rank analysis . A multivariable analysis of several independent prognostic factors was carried out using Cox ' s proportional hazards regression model . 17 Significance was defined as P < 0 . 05 . The statis - tical data were obtained using an SPSS software package ( SPSS 11 . 5 Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Results Relation of Clinicopathologic Factors According to Cortactin Expression A total of 205 patients with completely resected pathologic stages II – III CRC were included in this study . The median age was 57 ( range , 29 – 78 ) years , with 118 males and 87 females . Median follow - up time was 125 . 5 months ( range , 108 . 5 to 156 . 5 months ) . Of the 205 patients studied , 113 cases ( 55 . 1 % ) were strongly positive for cortactin ( Fig . 1a and b ) . Twenty - five cases ( 12 . 2 % ) were negative and 47 cases ( 22 . 9 % ) revealed unclear weak reactions . The relationship between cortactin expression and clinico - pathological features is shown in Table 1 . Cortactin expression correlated with tumor invasion ( P = 0 . 018 ) , histological grade ( P = 0 . 004 ) , and preoperative CEA level ( P < 0 . 001 ) . No other clinicopathological parameter was related to cortactin expression ( Table 1 ) . Of 140 , 88 ( 62 . 9 % ) patients with colon cancer were strongly positive for cortactin , and 45 of 65 ( 69 . 2 % ) patients with rectal Parameter P value a Disease - free survival Overall survival Age , years < 65 vs . ≥ 65 0 . 433 0 . 406 Gender Male vs . female 0 . 723 0 . 095 Location Colon vs . rectum 0 . 667 0 . 493 Tumor invasion pT1 / pT2 vs . pT3 / pT4 0 . 034 0 . 003 Lymph nodal status pN0 / pN1 vs . pN2 0 . 098 0 . 072 AJCC stage II vs .

Determination of Independent Factors Affecting Prognosis In univariate analysis by log - rank test , tumor invasion , AJCC stage , lymphovascular invasion , preoperative CEA level , and cortactin expression were significant prognostic factors for disease - free survival ( P = 0 . 034 , 0 . 009 , 0 . 043 , 0 . 004 , and 0 . 004 , respectively . ) , while for overall survival , tumor invasion , AJCC stage , pathologic grade , preoperative CEA level , and cortactin expression were significant prognostic factors ( P = 0 . 003 , 0 . 008 , 0 . 038 , 0 . 017 , and < 0 . 001 , respectively . ) ( Table 2 , Fig . 2 ) . Cortactin expres - sion was not a significant prognostic factor for disease - free survival in patients with rectal cancer ( Fig . 3a , P = 0 . 195 ) and colon cancer ( Fig . 3b , P = 0 . 464 ) , while for overall Fig . 2 Cumulative Kaplan – Meier curves for disease - free survival ( a ) and overall survival ( b ) stratified according to cortactin expression ( A , P = 0 . 004 ; B , P < 0 . 001 ) . 1252 J Gastrointest Surg ( 2010 ) 14 : 1248 – 1257 survival , cortactin expression was a significant prognostic factor in patients with rectal cancer ( Fig . 4a , P = 0 . 022 ) . However , cortactin expression was not a significant prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with colon cancer ( Fig . 4b , P = 0 . 102 ) . A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the independent prognostic roles of cortactin after adjusting for other significant covariates . All variables that significantly affected survival in univariate analysis were introduced into a Cox proportional - hazard model ( Table 3 ) . At the end of the stepwise process , tumor invasion , preoperative CEA level , and cortactin expression maintained their independent prognostic influence on disease - free survival ( P = < 0 . 001 , 0 . 003 , and 0 . 008 , respectively ) . However , tumor invasion , AJCC stage , and cortactin expression influenced overall survival ( P = 0 . 036 , < 0 . 001 , and 0 . 004 , respectively ) . The 5 - year survival rate for patients with cortactin negative / weak expression ( n = 72 ) was 55 . 9 % ( 95 % CI , 44 . 5 – 67 . 3 % ) , whereas patients with cortactin positive expression ( n = 133 ) was 33 . 3 % ( 95 % CI , 25 . 3 – 41 . 3 % ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 3c ) .

J Gastrointest Surg ( 2010 ) 14 : 1248 – 1257 1253 Discussion The precise preoperative staging of CRC is fundamental for surgical strategy , incomplete staging means incomplete treatment and poor outcome . 18 Large - scale clinical evalua - tions of predictive markers are currently in progress , including determination of their ability to predict response of patients to therapy for advanced disease and for adjuvant treatment . In the present study of 205 tumors , we demonstrated that higher cortactin expression are signifi - cantly associated with correlated with tumor invasion , histological grade , and preoperative CEA level , and found that cortactin expression status in the tumors of patients with CRC is a strong independent prognostic factor for disease - free and overall survival .

Importantly , cortactin expression status remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis . Recently , Lee et al . reported the expression of cortactin was higher in the colorectal adenocarcinoma and tubular adenoma than in the normal colorectal epithelia , and that higher cortactin immunostaining score was associated with more advanced stages ( T and M stage ) . 14 However , in another study , cortactin expression was negatively correlat - ed with TNM staging and lymphatic invasion status in CRC . 19 In previous studies , cortactin has been associated with histologic grade , T and N stage , and prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma 11 and head / neck squamous cell carcinoma . 20 , 21 ( Table 4 ) Several gain - and loss - of - function studies over the past few years have convincingly demonstrated the role of cortactin in regulation of cell motility and invasion by virtue of its role in actin remodelling , invadopodia formation , adhesion , endocytosis , and regulation of cell – cell junctions . 22 Although the acquisition of a motile phenotype has conventionally been regarded as a late event in tumor progression , it was recently proposed that aberrant cell motility may , in addition to being essential to tumor invasion and metastatic dissemination , also contributes significantly to rapid tumor growth . 23 Indeed , cortactin overexpression in our study was associated with tumor invasion , histological grade . From the pathologist ' s point of view , cortactin overexpression could be a new prognosis marker for CRC . Serum levels of CEA are widely used as tumor markers in patients with gastrointestinal cancer . Several reports have suggested that the postoperative serum CEA level is a useful marker of recurrence after colorectal surgery . 24 – 27 Moreover , it can be measured cheaply and easily . Monitoring of the postoperative CEA level is thus commonly used in the follow - up of CRC patients . 27 – 31 However , there has been some controversy about the significance of the preoperative CEA level as a predictive factor of recurrence . 32 , 33 Recently , Takagawa et al . reported preoperative serum CEA was a reliable predictive factor of recurrence after curative surgery in CRC patients . 34 Our current results endorse these findings . We have confirmed that preoperative CEA level is an important marker for disease - free survival in CRC , which is an additional finding in the current study . As previous studies have reported , the main factor influencing prognosis in CRC is the presence or absence of metastasis in the regional lymph nodes . 35 , 36 However , we found there wasn ’ t any association between lymph node status and disease - free survival and overall survival in this study , which will need to be studied in further studies . In conclusion , cortactin may be a good biomarker to be applied in the clinical setting to predict the prognosis of patients with completely resected pathologic stages II – III CRC .
