Unveiling the knowledge domain and emerging trends of olfactory dysfunction with depression or anxiety : A bibliometrics study Fangwei Zhou † , Tian Zhang † , Ying Jin , Yifei Ma , Yangsong Li , Mengting Zeng and Guodong Yu * Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery , Afﬁliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , China Olfactory dysfunction ( OD ) accompanied by depression or anxiety is a very common clinical problem , and there has been a growing number of studies on OD with depression or anxiety in recent decades . This study performed bibliometric and visual analyses of the literature on OD with depression or anxiety to derive research trends and identify emerging research foci . Relevant publications were obtained from the Science Citation Index - Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index in the Web of Science Core Collection databases ( 2002 – 2021 ) . CiteSpace and VOSviewer were applied to identify and evaluate research foci and emerging trends in this research domain . The analyses found that the number of publications related to OD with depression or anxiety has increased signiﬁcantly over the past 20 years , up from 15 in 2002 to 114 in 2022 . The country that ranked highest in the number of articles and international cooperation was the United States . The top 10 most frequent keywords were “depression , ” “olfaction , ” “anxiety , ” “dysfunction , ” “olfactory bulbectomy , ” “olfactory dysfunction , ” “Parkinson’s disease , ” “odor identiﬁcation , ” “brain , ” and “disorders . ” Analysis of keywords with the strongest citation bursts revealed that “oxidative stress” is an emerging research hotspot . A timeline chart of the cluster of co - cited references demonstrated that Parkinson’s disease was always a topic of interest in this area of research . This study conducted an objective , comprehensive , and systematic analysis of these publications , and identiﬁed the development of trends and hotspots in this research domain . It is hoped that this work will provide scholars , worldwide , with information to assist them in further research and the development of new therapies .

It has been estimated that 3 – 20 % of the worldwide population suﬀers from olfactory dysfunction ( OD ) ( Marin et al . , 2018 ) . Approximately one - third of patients with OD experience severe suﬀering and have a marked decrease in quality of life ( Croy et al . , 2014 ; Marin et al . , 2018 ) . Epidemiological studies have found that the prevalence and severity of OD increase with age , but the underlying mechanism is unclear ( Ottaviano et al . , 2013 ; Attems et al . , 2015 ) . Common causes of OD are upper respiratory infections , head trauma , and sinus disease , which account for about two - thirds of all OD cases ( Ciofalo et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , environmental pollution , drugs , toxic chemicals , and nutritional disorders can also lead to OD ( Murphy et al . , 2002 ) . Tobacco smoking can lead to a reversible decrease in the sense of smell , whereas chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps may cause partial or complete absence of smell ( Vennemann et al . , 2008 ; Guilemany et al . , 2011 ) . Recent research indicates that there is an association between OD and neurodegenerative diseases , and the high prevalence of OD , its early presentation , its persistence throughout the disease process , and the simplicity of olfactory testing have created interest in investigating OD as an early indicator of neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) , and Lewy body dementia ( Marin et al . , 2018 ) . Employing smell as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disorders is useful for prophase characterization , early diagnoses , diﬀerential diagnoses , and predicting the clinical outcomes of neurodegenerative disorders ( Fullard et al . , 2017 ) . It is well known that OD can aﬀect the physical and mental health of people . Individuals with OD are more likely to suﬀer from anxiety , depression , and even have a dramatically greater risk of death , because of their inability to respond on time to dangerous odors , such as leaking gas , toxic chemicals , and rotting food ( Hummel et al . , 2016 ) . The olfactory bulbs are considered the ﬁrst processing centers of olfaction and they assist in the detection and recognition of odors ( Smith and Bhatnagar , 2019 ) . Studies suggest that the olfactory bulbs and their central connections probably have a crucial function in emotional behavior ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) , and research has demonstrated that removing the olfactory bulbs induces depression - like behavior in animals after a “latency period” ( Yuan and Slotnick , 2014 ) . This latency period might represent the time required for follow - up changes in the limbic and hypothalamic bulbar targets that have an essential role in regulating emotion and memory . Depression - like behavior in animals following the removal of the olfactory bulbs is associated with changes in neurotransmission and endocrine and immune responses that have similarities to those observed in humans with depression ( Song and Leonard , 2005 ) . In the past few decades , researchers throughout the world have conducted studies in understanding the epidemiology , mechanisms , and association of OD with anxiety and depression . However , there is a lack of comprehensive reports that can help researchers obtain a visual overview of research trends in this ﬁeld . Bibliometrics is the utilization of mathematical - statistical approaches to summarize scientiﬁc activity in a ﬁeld of research and identify emerging frontiers and foci , or increasing patterns of research , using literature databases and metrological features ( Ma et al . , 2021 ) . Since its birth in the 1920s , bibliometrics has given birth to evaluation metrics such as journal impact factors , citations , and Altmetrics , as well as bibliometric methods such as citation analysis and scientiﬁc knowledge mapping ( Fanelli and Glänzel , 2013 ; Bornmann and Marx , 2016 ) . After the 1960s , with the rise of complex network analysis , bibliometrics began to expand from unidimensional statistical analysis to network analysis based on binary co - occurrence relationships , such as bibliographic coupling , co - citation analysis , co - authorship network analysis , author co - citation analysis , and journal co - citation analysis ( Waltman et al . , 2014 ) . In short , bibliometrics is a discipline that studies the distribution structure , quantitative relationships , and change patterns of documentary intelligence . Compared to conventional review articles , the bibliometric analysis oﬀers an up - to - date , intuitive , and non - biased approach to identifying trends and exploring speciﬁc domains of expertise , presented in the form of visual maps ( Zhu and Zhang , 2021 ) . Importantly , bibliometrics can reveal diﬀerent aspects of statistical rules , patterns of association , and evolutionary dynamics in the literature collections and the research ﬁelds they represent . Besides describing and predicting trends in a domain , bibliometric analysis can also be used to compare contributions made by diﬀerent countries / regions , institutions , authors , and journals ( Tang et al . , 2021 ) . Several forms of visualization software , such as CiteSpace , VOSviewer , and HistCite , have been created to assist scholars in building knowledge maps , assessing the latest frontier advances in research , and visualizing trends in scientiﬁc publications ( Wang and Meng , 2021 ) . To date , those bibliometric tools have been applied to assess research trends and “hotspots” in various ﬁelds , such as disease treatment , pain management , toxicology , molecular biology , environmental pollution , food safety , urban hazards , and novel materials ( Cheng et al . , 2021 ; Mostafaie et al . , 2021 ; Wu C . C . et al . , 2021 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) . Although previous reviews have provided an outline for the theoretical and empirical elements of the relationship between OD and depression , to our knowledge , none of these articles have used quantitative or visualization methods to investigate the longitudinal and cross - sectional features , trends , and current hotspots in research on this topic . Thus , this study collected qualitative and quantitative data on publications and identiﬁed Frontiers in Neuroscience 02 frontiersin . org fnins - 16 - 959936 September 6 , 2022 Time : 8 : 41 # 3 Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 959936 FIGURE1 Flowchart of the literature selection process in this study . the most proliﬁc or inﬂuential countries , institutions , authors , journals , and citations in this area . The purpose of this research was to conduct a thorough bibliometric analysis of research related to OD with depression or anxiety from 2002 to 2021 , as well as to provide scholars who have already entered or will soon enter the ﬁeld with new perspectives on the status of relevant studies , emerging trends , and future research directions , from a global perspective . Materials and methods Data collection and search strategy This study performed a bibliometric analysis using the Science Citation Index - Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index of the Web of Science Core Collection ( WoSCC ) database . The search phrase was : Topics = [ ( olfactory dysfunction OR olfactory disorder ) AND ( anxiety OR anxious OR depression OR depressive ) ] . The language of the documents was limited to English . We thoroughly searched the databases for relevant publications between 2002 and 2021 , and only original articles and reviews were included in our analysis ; meeting abstracts , editorial material , letters , and book chapters were excluded . A detailed ﬂowchart of this study’s process for selecting articles is shown in Figure 1 . To avoid bias from the continuous updates of databases , all publication searches and document downloads were conducted only on 25 May 2022 . Two researchers in this study checked the data collection and entry independently . Diﬀerences in the results obtained by the two researchers were resolved by consensus through discussion or by consulting with experts in the ﬁeld . Statistical analysis The bibliometric analysis conducted in this study employed CiteSpace 5 . 8 . R3 ( Drexel University , Philadelphia , PA , United States ) , VOSviewer 1 . 6 . 16 ( Leiden University , Leiden , Netherlands ) , and an online bibliometric analysis tool . 1 Before conducting the bibliometric analysis , the downloaded documents were converted to plain text ﬁles , which were later uploaded to the bibliometric analysis tools . The processing of the data produced a range of maps of visual knowledge areas and identiﬁed emerging trends and landmark literature , which were classiﬁed by countries , institutions , authors , journals , keywords , and citations . In addition , their H - index , impact factor , and category quartile were determined based on the 2021 Journal Citation Report . A journal’s impact factor is an internationally recognized index for evaluating the impact of journals ( Eyre - Walker and Stoletzki , 2013 ) , and the H - index is regarded as a crucial parameter for determining the scientiﬁc inﬂuence of journals , authors , institutions , and countries / regions ( Wu H . et al . , 2021 ) . CiteSpace is a visualization analysis tool that concentrates on analyzing the underlying knowledge contained in scientiﬁc publications , which has evolved in the context of scientometrics and the visualization of data . The visual network diagrams of this study consist of many nodes and lines . The nodes represent various items , such as countries / regions , institutions , authors , and co - cited references . The size of a single node reﬂects the number of observed items . The thickness of each circle indicates the number of citations relative to the “time zone” or time frame , and the lines between nodes refer to the collaboration / co - occurrence / co - citation of articles . CiteSpace was also applied in 1 http : / / bibliometric . com / Frontiers in Neuroscience 03 frontiersin . org fnins - 16 - 959936 September 6 , 2022 Time : 8 : 41 # 4 Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 959936 FIGURE2 ( A ) Number of publications per year ( 2002 – 2021 ) .

Centrality is used to evaluate the importance of a node in a visual network . The higher the number of links through a node in a network , the higher the centrality of that node . VOSviewer software is commonly used to create bibliometric visualization diagrams . It can be used to create maps of authors , institutions , countries , or journals based on collaborative relationships , or to establish keyword networks based on their concurrence . In contrast to commonly used bibliometric programs , VOSviewer focuses particularly on bibliometric graphical representation , which is especially useful for visualizing large bibliographies in an easily interpretable manner . The major aim of using VOSviewer was to analyze bibliometric networks and construct visualization diagrams , ultimately achieving an in - depth and comprehensive understanding of the structure and growing trends in scientiﬁc research . VOSviewer software can build three types of visual maps : network maps , temporal overlay maps , and density visualization maps .

Results General information A total of 1 , 056 publications ( including 867 original articles and 189 review articles ) met the inclusion criteria of being published between 2002 and 2021 . The number of publications has grown signiﬁcantly during the last 20 years , which suggests a growing interest in the association of OD with depression and anxiety ( Figure 2A ) . Annual publications rose from 15 in 2002 to 114 in 2021 . These 1 , 056 publications were cited 41 , 480 times ( average per item = 39 . 28 , H - index = 89 ) . Research activity peaked in 2017 – 2021 , with 434 papers published during this 5 - year period , accounting for more than 40 % of the total number of publications . Each original article or review was marked with at least one subject category in the WoSCC database . A total of 83 subject categories were assigned to the 1 , 056 publications about OD with depression or anxiety . The largest number of publications fell into the category of neuroscience ( 486 ) , followed by psychiatry ( 216 ) and clinical neurology ( 208 ) . Distribution by countries / regions and institutions Researchers from 1 , 453 institutions in 61 countries / regions have published papers in this ﬁeld . The top 10 countries and institutions that have contributed the most publications to research on this subject are shown in Tables 1 , 2 , respectively . The top ﬁve countries with the most articles are the United States ( 304 ) , Germany ( 183 ) , China ( 112 ) , Japan ( 86 ) , and Canada ( 64 ) ( Figure 2B ) .

The CiteSpace analysis of the distribution of institutions contributing to the literature in the ﬁeld ( Figure 3B ) revealed that the ﬁve most productive institutions were the Technische Universitat Dresden ( 62 ) , Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche ( 36 ) , National Institutes of Health ( 26 ) , Harvard University ( 25 ) , and University of California ( 25 ) . The top three institutions , ranked by their centrality , were all located in the United States : University of California ( 0 . 13 ) , Harvard University ( 0 . 12 ) , and National Institutes of Health ( 0 . 08 ) . Distribution by author A large amount of research was generated by 5 , 422 authors . Table 3 shows the top 10 most productive authors , and Figure 4 shows the collaboration networks of authors . The distribution of collaborations shown in Figure 4 reveals that the relationship between these authors is quite fragmented . This means that the scale of collaboration among academics is relatively small and generally inadequate . The largest number of publications were authored by T . Hummel of Technische Universität Dresden ( 45 publications ; 1 , 878 citations ) , followed by I . Croy of the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena ( 21 publications ; 1 , 128 citations ) and Z .

Keywords analysis Figure 5 shows the maps resulting from the VOSviewer analysis of the 1 , 056 publications . Figure 5A includes 221 terms ( 5 , 278 in total ) , each of which appears at least 10 times ; these terms are grouped into ﬁve clusters . The top 10 most frequent keywords were depression ( 374 ) , olfaction ( 159 ) , anxiety ( 158 ) , dysfunction ( 123 ) , olfactory bulbectomy ( 116 ) , olfactory dysfunction ( 111 ) , PD ( 100 ) , odor identiﬁcation ( 98 ) , brain ( 96 ) , and disorders ( 93 ) . The analysis generated ﬁve clusters of articles based on their topics , namely , clinical characteristics , pathogenesis , mechanisms , pathological physiology , and the treatment of OD with depression or anxiety . Figure 5B displays the distribution of keywords in chronological order , which is indicated by the depth of the color of the area . Most research before 2012 focused on “clinical characteristics , ” whereas the newly identiﬁed research hotspots indicate that “mechanism” and “treatment” seem to be the focus of future research . The density of the keywords was based on their frequency and displayed in the form of a density graph ( Figure 5C ) . CiteSpace identiﬁed keywords with citation bursts , which are considered to be indicators of emerging trends . The top 10 keywords with the strongest citation bursts in this ﬁeld are shown in Figure 5D . The blue line represents the total time span and the burst period is marked by the red line to show the start and end years of the burst .

After 2016 , the keyword with the strongest citation burst was “oxidative stress” ( 9 . 63 ) . These changes over time indicate changes in research focus . Characteristics of the top 10 most cited articles The top 10 most cited articles are shown in Table 4 , ranked by their number of citations . The number of citations of these articles ( 7 , 848 ) accounted for 18 . 9 % of the total number of all citations ( 41 , 480 ) . The article “Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis” by Zhao et al . ( 2008 ) , which was published in Cell in 2008 was the most frequently cited article ( 2 , 251 ) . Of the top 10 most cited publications , three were published in journals with an impact factor ≥ 20 ( Cell ; Lancet Neurology ; and Nature Reviews Drug Discovery ) and ﬁve were published in journals with an impact factor between ≥ 5 and < 20 ( Neuropsychopharmacology ; Brain Pathology ; Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews ; Molecular Psychiatry ; and Progress in Neuro - Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry ) . Citation analysis Analysis of cited references is considered to be a crucial part of bibliometric studies . A total of 53 , 331 cited references from 1 , 056 articles were included in the co - citation analysis , and a cluster graph was constructed based on their co - occurrence . Figure 6A shows a visual network of co - cited references , which consisted of 219 nodes and 364 links . Each node represents a cited article , with the links between nodes indicating the frequency of being cited for the same reference . The diameter of a node is proportional to the frequency with which the cited reference is quoted . Figure 6B depicts CiteSpace’s clustering of the reference co - citation network , showing only the largest eight clusters , based on index terms and identiﬁed by their log - likelihood ratio algorithm . The largest cluster was “PD” ( # 0 ) , followed by “adult neurogenesis” ( # 1 ) , “olfactory bulbectomy” ( # 2 ) , “olfaction” ( # 3 ) , “chemosensory event - related potential” ( # 4 ) , “gustation” ( # 5 ) , “anosmia” ( # 6 ) , and “non - motor symptoms” ( # 7 ) . Figure 7 presents the top eight clusters in the form of a timeline that portrays the clusters together with horizontal timelines in descending order , thus indicating the scientiﬁc relevance of the references . The top 20 references with the strongest citation bursts are shown in Figure 8 , which identiﬁes emerging research hotspots in relevant areas . Most of the bursts are neuroscience - related articles , indicating that neuroscience is a hot subject in OD with depression or anxiety . Distribution by journal Table 5 displays the features of the top 10 most productive journals . These journals accounted for 18 . 2 % ( 192 publications ) of the total number of published articles , and 20 % of these journals are in the ﬁrst quartile ( Q1 ) . Among these journals , three have published more than 20 articles . Behavioural Brain Research , PLOS One , and Movement Disorders published the most articles ( total = 82 articles , 7 . 8 % ) , with Behavioural Brain Research publishing the largest number of articles ( 35 ) and having the largest H - index ( 17 ) . However , Movement Disorders had the highest impact factor and the average number of citations . The Journal Citation Report Q1 contained Movement Disorders and Chemical Senses ; Q2 included Behavioural Brain Research , PLOS One , Progress in Neuro - Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry , Parkinsonism & Related Disorders , Neuropharmacology , and Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience , whereas Brain Research and Neuroscience were ranked as Q3 . Figure 9 displays a dual map of journals : the cited journals are on the right side of the ﬁgure and where they are cited are on the left side . The distinct lines between citing and cited journals illustrate that the citation links were sourced from diﬀerent subjects . The names of journals are marked on the vertical axis of the oval . The main citation paths in the dual map are depicted as two orange paths and two green paths . The orange paths indicate articles published in molecular / biology / immunology journals that are cited in molecular / biology / genetics and psychology / education / social journals . The green paths indicate studies published in psychology / education / health journals that are commonly cited in molecular / biology / genetics and psychology / education / sociology journals . Discussion Olfaction is crucial for a broad range of behaviors , such as food localization , emotional regulation , perception of danger , sexual behavior , and social behaviors ( Croy et al . , 2014 ; Marin et al . , 2018 ) . The olfactory bulbs project to brain regions that play a vital role in emotion and cognition , such as the orbitofrontal cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala ( Kohli et al . , 2016 ) . A large amount of evidence shows that OD is related to various neuropsychiatric disorders , including depression and anxiety ( Fang et al . , 2021 ) . Functional and structural damage to the olfactory system , particularly the olfactory bulbs and olfactory epithelium , are common in patients suﬀering from depression ( Zuo et al . , 2018 ) . The underlying mechanisms of how OD triggers depressive - like behaviors are complex and need to be examined further . This article investigated research hotspots and frontiers in OD with depression or anxiety by focusing on the worldwide status and trends in research . Although studies in this area are extensive , they are relatively chaotic and lack analysis of Frontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin . org fnins - 16 - 959936 September 6 , 2022 Time : 8 : 41 # 9 Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 959936 TABLE 4 Top 10 most co - cited references about OD with depression or anxiety from 2002 to 2021 .

Simultaneously , it demonstrates the urgent need in these countries to have eﬀective treatment for OD . Furthermore , the United States has the highest centrality score and is the most active country in international cooperation . It is surprising that Germany , despite being in second place in terms of publications , appears to have less cooperation with other countries and has a lower positive centrality score .

Health . However , the top 10 authors of most publications in this domain all have a centrality of less than 0 . 01 . This suggests that there is insuﬃcient collaboration among top researchers , which may be related to their research being comparatively full - ﬂedged . Overall , cooperation among countries , institutions , and authors is rare . In the future , further collaboration across diﬀerent levels of research should be conducted to obtain more signiﬁcant evidence and achieve an enormous breakthrough . Our analysis of keywords revealed that research on the clinical characteristics , pathophysiology , mechanisms , and treatment of patients with OD and depression or anxiety disorders has attracted extensive attention in the last two Frontiers in Neuroscience 11 frontiersin . org fnins - 16 - 959936 September 6 , 2022 Time : 8 : 41 # 12 Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 959936 decades . Analyzing the keywords with the most burst citations can , to some extent , reveal the development of trends and transformational mutation points in a discipline , and indicate potentially valuable research directions . Our results demonstrate that the interests of scholars were distinct at diﬀerent stages . During the early phase of research ( between 2002 and 2011 ) , academic circles focused greater attention on the clinical characteristics and treatment of OD . Notably , “olfactory bulbectomized rat” is an important keyword with the strongest burst of citations in earlier years . The olfactory bulbectomized rat has been generally acknowledged in academic circles to be an animal model of depression ( Morales - Medina et al . , 2017 ) . Removal of the olfactory bulbs leads to many abnormalities in neurotransmitter secretion and the endocrine and immune systems in rodents , and the behavioral changes it produces are similar to those observed in patients with depression ( Song and Leonard , 2005 ) . Since the behavioral deﬁcits induced in animals with their olfactory bulbs removed are reversed after repetitive antidepressant administration , it is a commonly used model to test the eﬀectiveness of potential antidepressants ( Sato et al . , 2008 ) . The olfactory bulbectomized model of depression has been conﬁrmed by a range of scientiﬁc evidence showing that there is an association between the functions of the olfactory bulbs and depression in humans and rodents ( Landis et al . , 2012 ) . As time went on , in vitro studies have received sustained attention . At a later stage ( from 2012 to 2021 ) , the mechanisms underlying the association of OD with depression or anxiety ( such as messenger RNA and oxidative stress ) have emerged as more prominent research hotspots . Substantial evidence suggests that oxidative stress is an early reaction in neurodegenerative diseases , in which neuronal injury in vulnerable groups of neurons can surpass 90 % ( Saleem et al . , 2020 ) . Studies have revealed that oxidative stress causes oxidative modiﬁcations in speciﬁc cells of the olfactory bulbs , which is a primary mechanism for age - related OD ( Vaishnav et al . , 2007 ) . Journal analysis can provide valuable information that can assist researchers in selecting relevant journals to submit their ﬁndings . Our study indicates that neuroscience and psychiatry journals publish the most articles in this domain , which implies that the association of OD with depression or anxiety is one of the core topics of neuroscience and psychiatry . We found that the top 10 most proliﬁc journals published less than one - ﬁfth ( 18 . 2 % ) of the total papers in the area , indicating that the distribution of the literature among journals is signiﬁcantly dispersed , probably due to the diversity of research directions , which cover neuroscience , psychiatry , clinical neurology , pharmacology , behavioral sciences , and biochemistry - molecular biology . The visualization map in Figure 9 displays the distribution of scientiﬁc journals by discipline , as well as the evolution of research content by discipline on a macro level . From the four main paths in the dual map of journals , it is apparent that research on OD with depression or anxiety has been a multidisciplinary eﬀort . Molecular , biology , immunology , psychology , education , and health are the essential and core subjects of OD with depression or anxiety . As the majority of research in this ﬁeld is interdisciplinary , international collaboration among researchers should be strengthened to yield high - quality research ﬁndings . The timeline of the cluster map of co - cited references shows the high level of interest in the mechanisms of OD accompanying depression in academic circles . A substantial amount of literature suggests a strong link between OD and depression . The cross - sectional study conducted by Seo et al . ( 2009 ) on the Korean general population showed that subjects with poorer olfactory function had higher levels of depression and poorer cognitive performance . A recent nationally representative longitudinal study in the United States found that people with olfactory impairment were more likely to experience frequent depressive symptoms in the future compared to healthy people ( Eliyan et al . , 2020 ) . These data suggest that OD predicts subsequent development of depression in adults and that the olfactory function test may be a useful tool to screen for depression in the general population . Sanna et al . ( 2021 ) also found that in addition to olfactory function , other factors such as age , gender , and cognitive function were associated with depression . Conversely , the course and duration of depression can have a dramatic eﬀect on olfactory function ( Pabel et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , it has been shown that the severity of depression is also closely related to olfactory function . It was reported that odor identiﬁcation and odor recognition memory were poorer in patients with severe major depressive disorders compared to those with mild major depressive disorders ( Zucco and Bollini , 2011 ) . Strengths and limitations This study performed , for the ﬁrst time , a comprehensive , objective , and visual analysis of publications related to OD with anxiety or depression and their developing trends , which can provide a comprehensive reference for researchers engaged in this topic . In addition , we used various bibliometric software to investigate diﬀerent dimensions of research hotspots , enabling us to obtain more accurate and objective ﬁndings . Inevitably , this study has some limitations . First , the literature included in this study may not be exhaustive . As the WoSCC database is an authoritative , comprehensive , and diverse database that indexes core journal citations , and has been shown to be more accurate than some other databases ( especially in the natural sciences ( You et al . , 2021 ) ) , we did not search other databases . Moreover , this study only included original research and reviews , and the language was limited to English , which may have reduced the number of publications retrieved and led to the omission of some publications . The inability of the bibliometric software to distinguish between manuscripts focused on human and Frontiers in Neuroscience 12 frontiersin . org fnins - 16 - 959936 September 6 , 2022 Time : 8 : 41 # 13 Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 959936 animal models is another limitation of this study . Finally , a small number of authors in the data may have duplicate names , and some of the authors may have honorary positions or part - time positions at diﬀerent universities . Nevertheless , we still believe that this study accurately illustrates the current status and general trends in research on this topic . This study has established a foundation for neuroscientists , otolaryngologists , and related researchers to rapidly identify research foci and emerging research trends in OD with depression or anxiety . Conclusion This is the ﬁrst study to use bibliometric analysis to provide information about developing trends and foci of research articles related to OD with depression or anxiety during the past two decades . These results may lay a foundation for relevant research in the ﬁeld worldwide . During the past two decades , the number of relevant articles has grown signiﬁcantly . In addition , scholars can conduct more relevant research in the ﬁeld of neuroscience and study the association of OD with neurodegenerative diseases , especially Alzheimer’s disease and PD . Notably , oxidative stress is another hot topic in this ﬁeld . Simultaneously , relevant researchers may consider publishing more original studies or reviews in psychiatry or neuroscience journals in future . It would be highly valuable to have further exploration of the molecular biological mechanism of OD with depression or anxiety and to determine new eﬀective treatments in later studies . We hope that this work will be instructive for researchers and assist them in improving future research quality , and ultimately beneﬁt patients with OD .
