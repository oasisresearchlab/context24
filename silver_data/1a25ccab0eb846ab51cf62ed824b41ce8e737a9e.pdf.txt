In recent years , neurodiverse children have increasingly been involved in the technology design process , but the design approaches adopted have focused mostly on overcoming difficulties of working with these children , leaving their strengths untapped . We present a new participatory design ( PD ) framework , Diversity for Design ( D4D ) , which provides guidance for technology designers working with neurodiverse children in establishing PD methods that capitalize on children’s strengths and also support potential difficulties . We present two case studies of use of the D4D framework , involving children with ASD and dyslexia , showing how it informed the development and refinement of PD methods tailored to these populations . In addition , we show how to apply the D4D framework to other neurodiverse populations . Author Keywords Participatory design ; children ; neurodiversity ; autism ; dyslexia .

INTRODUCTION The term ‘neurodiversity’ refers to a subset of neurological conditions , which typically result in a child being labeled as having special educational needs ( SEN ) . These conditions include ( among others ) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) , dyslexia , anxiety disorders and intellectual disabilities [ 4 ] . Neurodiversity seeks to reframe how these conditions are viewed by arguing that they constitute alternative cognitive processing styles occurring across a wide spectrum . This perspective offers a new way of thinking about the involvement of these children in design by recognizing that these conditions have associated strengths alongside the deficits that often define them . Indeed , as Armstrong [ 4 ] points out , the view of these different cognitive styles as disabilities is dependent on the social and cultural context of the individual ; for instance in a pre - literate society dyslexia would not be seen as a disability at all . The benefits technology can bring to children with SEN are now widely acknowledged within the child - computer interaction research community . More researchers are now seeking to involve them within the technology design process through approaches such as participatory design ( PD ) , where users are actively involved throughout the design process [ 12 , 14 ] . However , there is a tendency for this work to focus predominantly on how to overcome the difficulties of working with these children e . g . [ 1 , 14 , 23 ] . The importance of revisiting how disability is viewed in HCI has recently been discussed . Armagno [ 3 ] has argued in favor of applying a social model of disability , which shifts the focus from the functional limitations of individuals to problems resulting from limits of environments , barriers and cultures . He highlights the need for methodologies that adopt this alternative model such that the solutions developed by designers , responsible for creating and developing interactive digital products , are not also subject to the same limitations [ 3 ] . In employing the neurodiversity perspective , Dalton [ 9 ] has called for the specific development of “neurodiverse design protocols and methods – for example , for participatory design” . While the moral proposition of neurodiversity raises questions for designers , the development of design methods that balance children’s strengths or weaknesses requires time and careful consideration . Technology projects often have tight schedules , and designers are rarely experts in the subject matters they pursue . In following Armagno and Dalton’s suggestions , if design methods are informed by incorrect assumptions and preconceptions of the neurodiverse community , resulting technologies may serve to further marginalize these groups . In this paper , we provide designers with a framework that guides them in adapting PD to account for neurodiversity . The framework facilitates the development of PD methods , which direct designers’ attention to children’s strengths , while supporting their difficulties .

These examples illustrate the flexibility of the framework in accommodating designers’ resources and preferences , and demonstrate how the resulting methods evolve on the basis of theory and practice . Our framework serves as a unifying resource that can guide the development and documentation of new PD methods for neurodiverse children . In guiding designers to record and justify their methodological decisions , our framework can contribute towards capturing designers’ tacit knowledge , facilitating a deeper understanding of designerly practices . Finally , we propose that the implications of our framework can go well beyond the neurodiverse population to empower individuals from the wider population by reinforcing their strengths . BENEFITS OF NEURODIVERSITY TO PD There are a significant number of children labeled as “gifted and talented” who have also been diagnosed with a neurological condition such as ADHD , ASD , or dyslexia [ 24 ] . Armstrong [ 4 ] has identified characteristic strengths associated with different neurodiverse conditions . These strengths are presented in Table 1 alongside some of the difficulties that typically define the conditions , although we note that these characteristic strengths / difficulties are not necessarily observed in all individuals diagnosed with these conditions . Furthermore many associated characteristics can be viewed as either a strength or as a difficulty depending on the situation or the lens through which it is viewed . Alper et al . [ 2 ] highlight that gifted children with diverse needs are “at risk of growing frustrated or bored with existing interactive technologies because their needs…are not well understood or identified” . This emphasizes the importance of involving them directly in the technology design process rather than using proxies , such as parents , carers or teachers , to make design decisions on their behalf . Creativity is a strength commonly associated with all of these conditions . Creativity is a much - debated concept and while there are many definitions of the term , most refer to the generation of ideas that are both novel and appropriate [ 29 ] . Creativity is viewed as a key skill within PD , with Warr and O’Neill [ 29 ] proposing “the more creative we are in design , the greater the probability of designing useful and usable software applications and software” . The creative strengths of neurodiverse individuals along with other talents such as , for example , the spontaneity and risk - taking of individuals with ADHD , or the strong visual - spatial skills and innovative thinking of individuals with dyslexia , could result in extremely valuable , and potentially unique , contributions to the design of new technology . While adapting PD to support the involvement of children has been relatively common for over a decade [ 15 ] , recently some researchers have begun recognizing the strengths of neurodiverse children . After involving children with high - functioning autism ( HFA ) in the design of a technology - enhanced learning environment , Frauenberger et al . [ 12 ] stated that they “have a tendency to become very good at what they like , whatever skill that might be” and emphasized the importance of their input within the end product . Gibson et al . [ 13 ] also highlighted the positives of working with ‘difficult’ children in mainstream classes , which can frequently include those with ADHD , stating that “the benefits far outweigh the problems” . These benefits included strengthening the enjoyment of the group , quickly understanding the need for a “different and fun” product , and being more innovative and less inhibited in their ideas . Despite this movement , within the HCI community there Associated Characteristics ( P = a strength and x = a difficulty ) ADHD ASD Dyslexia Anxiety disorders Intellectual disabilities Spontaneous and high energy / Restless P x Divergent or innovative thinkers P P Creative ( in specific areas ) P P P P P Risk - takers / Impulsive P x Attention to details or high precision P P High focus ( related to interests ) / Distractible P x P x P x Strong systemizers / Obsessive routines P x Prodigious memory / Poor memory P x Visual - spatial skills P P x x Exceptional talents in very specific areas P P Ability to see “big picture” P Social skills x P Reading , writing and / or spelling abilities x Cognitive abilities x Communication skills x x P Intense phobias x Table 1 . Characteristic strengths and difficulties associated with neurodiverse conditions [ 4 ] remains a tendency to focus on the barriers that need to be overcome to enable the participation of neurodiverse children e . g . [ 1 , 11 , 23 ] . Guha et al . [ 14 ] , for example , have developed a model for involving children with special needs more generally within the technology design process . The authors propose three layers to their model including ( 1 ) level of children’s involvement ; ( 2 ) nature / severity of disability ; ( 3 ) availability / intensity of support . This model has combined best practice from special education teaching with technology development [ 19 ] , but as Fohlin [ 10 ] points out , the second layer of this model can be viewed as “an obstacle that needs to be overcome” in the third layer . Exemplifying researchers’ focus on the limiting factors of neurodiversity , Dalton [ 8 ] conducted a meta - review of papers in the ACM digital library ( 1999 - 2013 ) referencing dyslexia or autism and found “no paper made any positive mention of any aspect of either of these conditions” . In reflecting on the challenges of PD more generally , Sanders et al . [ 27 ] observe that it can be “difficult for many people to believe they are creative and behave accordingly” . PD methods must thus support a design environment in which individuals feel comfortable and confident generating and sharing creative ideas alongside designers . Crafting design environments that provide the best possible opportunities for children to realize their potential and make meaningful design contributions becomes even more critical in the context of neurodiversity . Armstrong [ 4 ] discusses the importance of niche construction in the education of neurodiverse children . This concerns adapting the environment to match the particular needs of an individual , to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses . In this spirit , Kärnä et al . [ 19 ] propose a framework for involving children with special needs in technology design and development , called Children in the Centre ( CiC ) . CiC has five levels , with the central component focusing on the children’s interests , strengths and needs , which can facilitate the emergence of the children’s potential and hidden skills . CiC therefore acknowledges children’s limitations , whilst not restricting participation to being exclusively limitation - centric . Though Kärnä et al . describe rich examples of applying CiC to a technology design project , they do not present a practical framework that can guide future work . In summary , recognizing the importance of neurodiversity in HCI highlights a need for a flexible framework that can guide technology designers in the development of PD methods that support the specific capabilities of children from different neurodiverse populations . One way to achieve this is through the application of niche construction . The following section introduces the TEACCH program , which is based on this philosophy , and forms the foundation of our PD approach . D4D : A FRAMEWORK FOR NEURODIVERSITY IN PD TEACCH ( Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication handicapped CHildren ) is an evidence - based program that has been used internationally in the education of individuals with autism for over 30 years . Mesibov et al . [ 22 ] explain that the aim of TEACCH is not “being normal” , but rather for individuals with autism to function as comfortably and effectively as possible within society . The primary link between TEACCH and the neurodiverse movement is the focus on the fundamental strengths of the condition . Although Mesibov et al . [ 22 ] do acknowledge “all programs should work on both strengths and deficits to some extent” , they emphasize that the priorities of TEACCH are on strengths . The TEACCH program incorporates a Structured Teaching intervention approach . Structured Teaching is “an array of teaching or treatment principles and strategies” based on the understanding of and respect for the ‘Culture of Autism’ , that can be applied to each person’s particular situation [ 24 , 32 ] . These principles include the following : ( 1 ) Understanding Culture : TEACCH recognizes and responds to autism as a culture i . e . the “characteristic and predictable patterns of thinking and behavior” observed in the condition [ 22 ] . Examples of these characteristics include strengths related to , and preferences for , visual processing and following routines [ 28 ] . ( 2 ) Tailoring to the Individual : TEACCH is premised on the philosophy that its application should be flexible and individualized , enabling its’ concepts and methods to be relevant for a wide range of “developmental levels and behavioral profiles” [ 22 ] . Whereas the first principle targets typical ASD characteristics , here the focus is on characteristics specific to the individual , including “skills levels , talents , special interests , personality , feelings , quirks and potential” [ 22 ] . An example would be to theme a particular activity for a child with an interest in World War I with prominent WWI figures or battles . ( 3 ) Structuring the Environment : TEACCH incorporates “situational modifications” to help mitigate potential difficulties by matching the environment to an individual’s “abilities and ways of understanding and learning” [ 22 ] . One example of this is to set a predictable sequence of activities to make the environment more comprehensible and prevent anxieties related to uncertainty or surprises . ( 4 ) Providing Supports : TEACCH provides supports to make the specific activities more understandable to the individual [ 28 ] . Examples of supports include providing visual representations or physical demonstrations of task instructions to reinforce verbal explanations . In abstracting the key TEACCH principles , it becomes apparent that the program’s philosophy can be generalized to a wider neurodiverse population . Moreover , as Mesibov et al . [ 22 ] highlight , characteristics of ASD can also exist in conditions such as ADHD and OCD , as well as in typically developing children , for instance the attention to detail in ASD and OCD . This suggests that structuring the environment or incorporating supports that capitalize on typical ASD strengths could benefit children with other neurodiverse conditions associated with similar strengths ( or difficulties ) . In using TEACCH to inform a framework for PD methods that broadly support the participation of neurodiverse populations , we must therefore consider how these four key principles can apply to PD . A typical PD session centers on a design activity and collaboration between participants . The potential for collaboration and creativity is influenced by how the design activity has been crafted . Therefore , the construction of the design environment , and how strengths are promoted and weaknesses are accommodated ( structuring the environment and providing supports ) should be informed by the typical characteristics of the neurodiverse culture as well as by each participating child’s own talents and strengths ( understanding culture and tailoring to the individual ) . Fig . 1 presents our proposed PD framework for neurodiversity , which we call Diversity for Design ( D4D ) . Figure 1 : Diversity for Design ( D4D ) framework We intentionally employ the term framework , as opposed to method or tool , as the term reflects the necessary flexibility D4D provides designers in developing methods appropriate to their specific context and constraints , whereas method implies more rigidity and precise replication . In considering designers’ agency and need for flexibility in conducting design research , the D4D framework guides them in tailoring their PD methods to enable the participation of neurodiverse populations . To demonstrate how our D4D framework for neurodiversity can be employed in practice , we present two case studies , one using PD to inform math software for children with ASD , and the second employing PD during the development of software to assist children with dyslexia with their reading difficulties . CASE STUDY 1 : DEVELOPING PD METHODS FOR CHILDREN WITH ASD The first case study describes a project that aimed to involve children with HFA and Asperger’s Syndrome ( AS ) in the development of an intelligent tutoring system for helping children with ASD at Key Stage 3 ( aged 11 - 14 ) to learn math . The lead designer in the project had two years to work with children on designing certain aspects of the system . This timeframe enabled taking an iterative stepwise approach to the process of developing a PD method for children with ASD . Here we describe those steps . Theoretically - informed PD Our first step involved reviewing existing literature in order to identify the typical strengths ( e . g . visual - spatial skills ) and preferences ( e . g . preference for structure and routines ) , as well as potential difficulties ( e . g . distractibility ) of children with ASD , particularly those relevant in a PD context . The TEACCH characteristics of the Culture of Autism [ 22 ] played an important role here , as did other key literature within the field of autism , e . g . [ 5 , 16 ] . We then undertook a critical review of existing PD methods and techniques for children , e . g . [ 14 , 15 , 20 ] , to provide inspiration for features that could be incorporated into a PD method for children with ASD . We selected PD features that we believed would either capitalize on the strengths or support the difficulties associated with ASD , both in terms of structuring the design environment or providing appropriate supports within the design activities . Next , we determined which of the features could be applied to benefit the wider ASD population , and which could be tailored to the individual child participants . The PD method established through this process is as follows ( PD features responsive to ASD characteristics are presented in small caps , with the number of the corresponding feature from the D4D framework summarized in Fig . 2 in brackets ) : In preparing the sessions , it was important to identify children’s HOBBIES AND INTERESTS ( 8 ) through e . g . surveys or discussions with their guardian , with the aim to integrate them into PD – either within the overall design task , specific activities , or as a form of reward for participating . Children with ASD often have exceptional knowledge or skills in areas related to their special interests [ 22 ] and therefore integrating these into the design process allows them to contribute their knowledge / skills . Moreover , it was essential to choose design task CONTENT APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHILDREN ’ S ABILITY LEVEL ( 9 ) to mitigate any concerns about failure . Also due to preferences for routine and potential auditory sensitivities , each session was to take place in a QUIET / FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT ( 1 ) , e . g . in a separate classroom at the children’s school . In providing structure to the sessions , we would use a VISUAL SCHEDULE ( 5 ) for displaying each of the activities , using both text and images , and also a set of rules agreed on by all participants to guide appropriate behavior during sessions . This would be visible throughout the session with a child TICKING OFF EACH ACTIVITY ( 6 ) on completion . To capitalize on the children’s visual strengths the session would begin with A VISUAL RECAP ( 2 ) of what happened in the previous session ( if appropriate ) , incorporating images of activities undertaken during the past session , a summary of the main achievements and how they linked to the current session . Next , the current sessions would be VISUALLY INTRODUCED ( 2 ) , involving references back to activities displayed on the schedule and explanations of what each would entail . Where possible all ACTIVITIES WOULD INTEGRATE VISUAL COMPONENTS ( 14 ) . Each session would finish with a SUMMARY OF THE SESSION AND AN INTRODUCTION TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT WEEK ( 2 ) , to highlight what the children had achieved and to prevent anxieties about unknown , upcoming activities . To reflect the systemizing approach of children with ASD each session would FOLLOW A SIMILAR STRUCTURE ( 3 ) , i . e . same start / end , and design activities would be CONSISTENTLY STRUCTURED ( 15 ) wherever possible . Lastly , the sessions would ideally be SCHEDULED AT THE SAME TIME AND PLACE ( 4 ) each week to provide some familiarity for the children . In performing design work within sessions , during initial sessions we would incorporate fun , structured ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON BUILDING TEAM RAPPORT AND SKILLS ( 12 ) , e . g . Lego building challenges , to help the children feel comfortable and confident about working in a collaborative design environment . In introducing the main design task , SIMILAR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE DEMONSTRATED ( 13 ) and critiqued , to build on the children’s reality - based creativity style . The IDEA GENERATION PROCESS WOULD BE SPLIT INTO EXPLICIT STAGES ( 11 ) and incorporate VISUAL DESIGN TEMPLATES ( 16 ) , to guide the process of generating and documenting individual ideas , and combining these with other design team members . If a child appeared to be struggling to make progress an ADULT WOULD INTERVENE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ( 18 ) to enable the child to successfully complete the activity . Fig . 2 summarizes how the various features were informed by our D4D framework . White boxes ( with solid or dashed lines ) indicate PD features that were informed by theory . Next , we describe how our method was trialed with children with ASD , and additionally how we refined it by reflecting on our design practice . Practice - informed PD : one - to - one workshops Our second step involved applying our theoretically - inspired PD method in one - off design workshops with individual children with HFA / AS ( see [ 6 ] for full details ) . The aim of these workshops was to explore the children’s strengths and difficulties during participation within typical design activities . Given our inexperience with the user group at the time , we intentionally used one - to - one design sessions to create a safe design context that was easier for us to control . Ten children with HFA / AS aged 11 - 14 from three specialist ASD schools participated in the workshops . Our original literature review highlighted the talent , knowledge and focus children with ASD can have within areas related to their special interests . Therefore , we tailored the design task to match a common interest of children with ASD ( and children in general ) : computer games [ 21 ] . To draw links with the intelligent tutoring system we sought to inform , the children were asked to design a math - based computer game for their peers . Each session involved four activities : 1 ) introduction to the workshop , 2 ) discussion of the child’s previous experience of math and computer games , and demonstration of existing math games , 3 ) generation and documentation of design ideas , 4 ) physically drawing an interface design of best idea using provided art materials . These activities drew from features of our D4D framework for ASD presented earlier . The findings from these workshops are discussed below with the resulting implications in bold . Our workshops revealed the need to evolve existing features due to difficulties that children faced . We found that VISUAL DESIGN TEMPLATES ( 16 ) , in particular , needed to provide more guidance to children in the initial idea generation phase . At the beginning of sessions , when children were provided with a blank design template on which to document their ideas , many struggled to generate any . However , once we changed our protocol to incorporate example ideas and partially completed interface designs , children were able to expand on the ideas given , and in some cases generate their own idea ( s ) where previously they had been unable to do so . We also discovered emergent uses , as features we had included were sometimes used in unexpected ways . The VISUAL SCHEDULE ( 5 ) worked well to prepare the children for which activities would be encountered during the workshop . To our surprise , it also proved useful as a tool for re - engaging any children who became distracted during the session , enabling them to see where they were and resume from where they had left off more easily . Figure 2 : D4D framework applied to the development of PD features for the ASD population Our workshops highlighted the flexibility required for certain features , such as the provision of ADULT SUPPORT ( 18 ) . An adult facilitator was present to re - engage some of the children if they became distracted . This facilitator was additionally able to support children who initially struggled with idea generation by providing them with inspiration and verbal encouragement . At the same time , we observed the importance of applying tacit knowledge about each child in providing support . For example , interventions that supported some children would stifle others , who remained engaged throughout and enthusiastically shared their own ideas without verbal prompts . Moreover , our sessions demonstrated the importance of tailoring content to the individual child participant’s ability level . During the demonstration of existing math games , although the difficulty of the demonstrated levels was intentionally kept low , it still proved too difficult for some . An inability to understand the game had a strong negative impact on engagement . For example , instead of documenting his ideas , one boy wrote ‘I hate the basketball’ , referring to the game he had been unable to understand . We thus modified this protocol to ensure that children’s abilities be established in advance where possible , and to rely on video demonstrations rather than direct interaction with software , to avoid uncertainties about appropriate content level . Finally , certain features such as the ROUTINE OF TICKING OFF ACTIVITIES ( 6 ) gained more prominence than originally intended . Many of the children appeared to enjoy this routine and some explicitly asked to tick off the last activity at the end of the session . This suggested to us that this responsibility could be further leveraged , thus in subsequent sessions this role was explicitly ‘assigned’ to a child . From our workshops , we observed that while most of our proposed PD features enabled children to participate , others required modification . This prompted a first iteration of our PD method ( see Fig . 2 ) : while 10 of our original features remained the same ( solid white boxes ) , five others were revised based on our insights ( dashed boxes ) . Practice - informed PD : collaborative workshops In a third and final step , we applied the iterated PD method in a new design context involving two design teams of children with ASD , see [ 7 ] . The collaborative nature of this step created new demands , thus we anticipated adapting or adding new features . The method was used over six design workshops , with each design team involving three children with HFA aged 12 - 13 , two researchers ( one undertaking an interaction designer role ) , and one teaching staff member from the children’s school . Our objective in the workshops was to explore children’s preferences for types of feedback and rewards , to inform the design of the math tutoring system . As in the first series of workshops , we chose a design task related to computer games . Our design workshops demonstrated a need to evolve existing features . Varying levels of ADULT SUPPORT were present throughout , and our facilitators focused on supporting engagement and idea generation . At the same time , however , we discovered individual difficulties that needed to be accommodated to enable the children to share their many ideas most effectively . For instance , one child was sensitive to touching paper , and thus required the facilitator to write / draw his ideas on the paper - based templates . Others struggled to work in teams , did not listen to each other’s ideas , and were hyper - critical . Adult intervention was required to reposition the workshop as a collaborative activity . These emergent needs led us to redefine the role of ADULT SUPPORT ( 19 ) to additionally include responding to specific sensitivities and collaboration patterns to facilitate equity in participation . Our experiences also highlighted the need to introduce new features . In one of the design teams , children initially found it challenging to generate design ideas . As a response , the teaching assistant directed them to generate ideas for a very specific aspect of the feedback system . This enabled children to begin generating focused ideas , which were later expanded and integrated in a wider variety of feedback mechanisms . Focusing early design sessions on the FINER DETAILS OF THE DESIGN TASK ( 7 ) and then extending the design context in later sessions is therefore one way to match the detail - focused processing style of children with ASD . A second feature concerned children’s expressive preferences in sharing their ideas . We observed quickly that some children with artistic talents preferred to draw their ideas and appeared to lack confidence in sharing their ideas verbally , while others seemed restricted by their drawing ability , but were able to eloquently describe their ideas verbally . Children’s individual expressive strengths evolved over the course of the sessions and evidenced the need to support MULTIPLE MODES OF EXPRESSION ( 10 ) by providing opportunities to share ideas verbally or visually . After the fourth and fifth design sessions , one of the researchers converted the paper - based design ideas into videos of a digital prototype of the math game . The children asked to watch each video several times , which helped them generate ideas about how to improve the feedback and reward design . Children with ASD typically think about things in a concrete way , therefore CONVERTING PAPER - BASED DESIGN IDEAS VERY QUICKLY INTO CONCRETE COMPUTER - BASED REPRESENTATIONS ( 17 ) of the design product fit with their reality - based style of creativity . During the sessions it became clear that some of the children had extensive knowledge of computer games . For example , one boy suggested useful game design resources to the researchers , and was able to analyze the many games he had played to reflect on what made them successful . This knowledge came to guide the team’s idea generation , highlighting the importance of being able LINK THE DESIGN ACTIVITIES TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE / SKILLS ( 20 ) of individual participants by identifying relevant skills in advance and explicitly encouraging a child to contribute to a design activity that links to their specific strengths . Our collaborative workshops showed that while most of our PD features worked well in the new context , we needed to evolve one feature , and introduce four additional features ( see grey boxes in Fig . 2 ) . CASE STUDY 2 : DEVELOPING PD METHODS FOR CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA Our second case study concerns an ongoing EU - funded project aimed at developing a learning tool to help dyslexic children between the ages of 9 - 11 improve their reading and writing skills . Given that our design research stage has been limited to one year , we had less time to develop a PD method , thus this case presents a considerable contrast to the previous one . As stated earlier , characteristics of ASD can also exist in other conditions , including dyslexia [ 26 ] . Thus , we built on the foundations laid during our previous case study . We describe the stepwise process of method development we used in the following sections , with the number of the corresponding feature in the D4D framework summarized within Fig . 3 in brackets . Theoretically - informed PD Our first step involved identifying typical strengths , preferences , and potential difficulties of children with dyslexia from the literature . We relied , in particular , on a recent review of dyslexia [ 26 ] , which enabled us to identify shared characteristics between ASD and dyslexia . As presented in Table 1 , two overlapping characteristic strengths are a high focus on activities related to interests , and strong visual - spatial skills . These similarities suggested that PD features previously developed in the context of ASD to support these strengths would be transferable to this context . These features were : § Building on existing talents by theming design workshop to HOBBIES / INTERESTS ( 9 ) and capitalizing on CHILDREN ’ S EXISTING KNOWLEDGE OR SKILLS ( 17 ) during idea generation § Taking advantage of visual strengths by I ncluding A VISUAL RECAP ( 2 ) of the previous session followed by a VISUAL SCHEDULE ( 4 ) of design activities ; integrating VISUAL COMPONENTS ( 12 ) within design activities where possible ; and using VISUAL DESIGN TEMPLATES ( 13 ) for documenting ideas Our review also revealed overlapping difficulties between ASD and dyslexia , such as anxieties related to failure , the unfamiliar , or the unknown . The PD features originally developed to overcome these difficulties were : § Incorporating APPROPRIATE CONTENT FOR THE CHILD ’ S ABILITY LEVEL ( 10 ) to help mitigate failure § Conducting session in QUIET / FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT ( 1 ) and scheduling sessions at the SAME TIME / PLACE EACH WEEK ( 3 ) to limit unknown factors § Providing an INTRODUCTION TO THE CURRENT SESSION and WHAT WILL HAPPEN THE NEXT WEEK ( 2 ) to ensure the child knows what to expect Next , we reviewed existing applications of PD to establish how to capitalize strengths and support difficulties specific to children with dyslexia , focusing both on the broad level and at the level of the specific individual . In shaping our PD method to be specific to dyslexic children , we introduce the ‘ BIG PICTURE ’ OF THE DESIGN TASK ( 5 ) first , focusing on specific design components during later sessions as a way to capitalize on dyslexic children’s global processing style . We employ a MULTISENSORY APPROACH ( 6 ) in design activities , incorporating visual elements to maximize typical visual strengths , and kinesthetic elements e . g . Lego - based tasks , to enable children to participate in ways more natural for them . Furthermore , ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR COMPLETING THE DESIGN TASK ( 14 ) would be provided to promote independence and encourage metacognitive thinking , e . g . providing different sources of idea inspirations , as dyslexic children tend to overgeneralize negative experiences . Practice - informed PD : observations and interviews Our second step involved balancing our theoretically - informed PD method with best practice notions from teachers . We conducted observations and interviews in two Figure 3 : D4D framework applied to the development of PD features for a dyslexic population UK primary schools and two specialist dyslexia - teaching centers to capture strategies used by teachers to support neurodiversity , which would be useful to employ during PD . The lead researcher observed and took detailed notes documenting the teaching strategies employed by the teachers during one - to - one , small group and entire class literacy lessons . The same researcher then interviewed five of these teachers , including one mainstream primary school teacher , two SEN teachers , and two specialist dyslexia teachers . The interviews focused on teaching strategies witnessed during observations , including how teachers engaged children , built on their strengths to increase their confidence , selected appropriate content , supported particular difficulties , incorporated children’s interests , and integrated technology into their teaching . This step suggested a need for inclusion of two additional features . The specialist teachers sought to create a non - threatening environment where children felt confident enough to ‘have a go’ . This led to us ADAPTING THE RULES ( displayed on the visual schedule ) ( 7 ) to emphasize ‘having a go’ at an activity and to clarify that there were no ‘wrong answers’ . We also learned that specialist teachers employed a quick succession of short literacy tasks to keep children engaged , and constructed sessions with key achievable targets that children would not ‘fail’ . Thus , design activities incorporated into the PD method would be SHORT , FOCUSED AND ACHIEVABLE ( 15 ) , with all tasks having precise objectives , being explained as simply as possible , and lasting no more than 10 minutes . Finally , in witnessing children’s reading difficulties in practice , we proposed to evolve the feature ADULT SUPPORT ( 19 ) to include help with spelling , writing and reading , and for text to be avoided wherever possible . Practice - informed PD : collaborative workshops In a third and final step , we applied our revised PD method in three design workshops involving a single design team , comprised of four children with reading / writing difficulties , one researcher undertaking an interaction designer role , and one teaching staff member from the children’s school who knew the children well . All children were aged 9 - 10 and were undergoing dyslexia assessment . The workshops were targeted at informing the design of a game forming part of a larger learning tool , for children aged 9 - 11 . In particular , the goal was to generate design ideas for the game’s navigation and reward systems . Our work with children revealed further difficulties that introduced new PD features . Children frequently became distracted from current activities by resources for previous activities , such as the pens for ticking off activities on the visual schedule . This sensitized us to remove RESOURCES NOT APPLICABLE TO THE CURRENT ACTIVITY FROM VIEW ( 8 ) to maintain the children’s focus on the activities . Difficulties the children encountered also required us to evolve existing features . For example , the VISUAL SCHEDULE ( 4 ) that detailed the structure of the workshop included the words ‘The End’ , but unknowingly , we had used an elaborate font that was difficult for children to discern . While in this instance , reading the text itself was not essential , difficult - to - read text can lower children’s confidence , potentially affecting their willingness to contribute to design activities . This highlighted the importance of overriding any aesthetic choices and using a DYSLEXIA FRIENDLY FONT ( 16 ) at all times . The workshops also evolved existing features , such as having MULTIPLE MODES OF EXPRESSION ( 11 ) , with the children not only expressing their ideas visually via drawing and verbally during group discussions , but also sometimes with acting , using materials as props , e . g . using a board rubber to show how they interact with their mobile phone . Fig . 3 summarizes how each of these steps was informed by our D4D framework . White boxes indicate theoretically - inspired features , with features appropriated from the ASD method presented in solid lines . Grey boxes represent features that were proposed by teaching practices and the design workshop sessions . ADAPTING THE D4D FRAMEWORK In illustrating the practical application of the D4D framework , we break down our process into a series of steps a designer might employ for another neurodiverse population . We use children with ADHD as an example . Understand the Culture of ADHD : Examine the ADHD literature to identify the typical characteristics of the culture of ADHD , including strengths , preferences and difficulties . Reflect on how these might manifest within a PD context . Consider supplementing theoretical views with design research , such as observations or interviews with both the children and the adults that work with them , or trial design activities and workshops . Understand the Individual Children : Consider how the method will be tailored to the individual children participating in the session . Identify in advance the children’s ability levels in relation to the design task content , their existing knowledge / skills as well as hobbies / interests and how these could be linked in with the design activities . Decide on whether to involve an adult already familiar with the children , such as a teacher , for providing relevant information and additional support . Structure the Environment and Provide Supports : Determine the implications of these insights within the context of the designer’s tacit knowledge on the environment structure and types of supports required , focusing especially on capitalizing strengths and supporting known difficulties . For example , a detail - focused or global processing style requires consideration of the initial presentation of the design task , while a particular preferred information presentation style impacts on what and how information in the visual schedule should be presented . DISCUSSION Many designers do not have experience of working with neurodiverse populations . Over continuous exposure to a neurodiverse population , designers can develop the expertise necessary to engage such individuals in design activities , but the time constraints of most technology projects do not allow for this . Furthermore , within PD , participants can play multiple roles , at various levels of involvement [ 17 ] . For meaningful participation , neurodiverse children require support to emphasize their strengths , and provisions to mitigate their difficulties . This enables a deeper level of involvement where designers ‘learn with’ the participants during the design process rather than simply ‘learning about’ [ 17 ] . We found that children were most suited to contributing ideas and evaluating different design options . However , as some children also had extensive technical knowledge / skills , they additionally had the potential to contribute towards assessing technical feasibility and developing design prototypes . The present paper proposed a new framework , D4D , to guide designers in supporting the meaningful participation of neurodiverse children . Our contribution is not in developing a novel PD method , as many of the features we identified in our neurodiverse PD methods are not novel . Rather it is the adaptation of the TEACCH education principles as a design framework that scaffolds designers in the creation of new PD methods for children with a range of neurodiverse conditions , guiding them to identify the specific combination of PD features most appropriate for their target population . The implications of our work are three - fold . First , in many research projects involving neurodiverse children , methods are generated “on the fly” for use within specific project bounds . Often , only minimal details are provided about these methods , their rates of success , and reasons underlying success or failure . This makes it difficult for the research community to learn from each other’s experiences . In hoping that HCI researchers will employ the D4D framework , and document the resulting methods , we aspire to create a common point of reference and a practical resource that is enriched over time to benefit those working with neurodiverse children . Indeed , given the overlap of characteristics between some of these conditions , PD methods developed for one condition can become reusable and transferable to another . Second , researchers may hesitate to rigorously document their methods because of the complexity of methodological choices both at the inception and application stage . Additionally , parties involved in design activities draw on tacit knowledge and prior experiences . Reflecting on our case studies , the lead designer drew on experiences of conducting design workshops , observations of how teachers intervened in challenging situations , and conversations with individual children or their parents regarding the children’s interests or difficulties . These influences led to new PD features guided by , and subsequently captured within , the D4D framework . The framework can thus serve to capture and model designers’ strategies and tacit knowledge longitudinally providing us with more insight into the often - elusive nature of design practice . Third , a practical contribution of our work is to demonstrate a process through which the D4D framework can guide the development of features for incorporation in PD , informed by theory and practice . Importantly , this process is flexible to the practices of different designers and their constraints . Case Study 1 presented an in - depth approach , where sufficient time was available to undertake iterative testing of the different feature sets with the target population . Case Study 2 presented a lightweight approach that partly reused the method from the first case study , and replaced the more time - consuming and resource intensive design workshops with ethnographic work . Whereas Case Study 1 is strongly informed by design practices including children , Case Study 2 takes a more teacher - centric approach . An important feature of our process is the acknowledgement that methods are not only proposed but also practiced . Although theory was initially used to develop each PD method , the D4D framework facilitated the incorporation of insights gained from our application of these methods . Neurodiverse conditions , which entail a range of specific talents and difficulties , create an additional demand to reflect and capture the practice of design methods in a more iterative process . The D4D framework of neurodiversity therefore guides initial method construction , but also scaffolds reflection and further development . As systematically evaluating the outcomes of this framework is beyond the scope of this work , it would be valuable if designers using D4D evaluated and reported on the outcomes of their methods with different populations ; potentially considering the quantity , quality and / or novelty of ideas generated using their method . A final contribution of our work is the documentation and development of two PD methods for ASD and dyslexia . We note , however , that given the limited scope of our paper , the frameworks presented here should be viewed as illustrative rather than fully comprehensive , and may not cover a complete set of PD features for all children with ASD or dyslexia , let alone the wider neurodiverse population . We conclude with some optimism about the far - reaching implications of neurodiversity for HCI . Kapp et al . [ 18 ] have argued that “many neurological conditions have variable traits , fluid boundaries among one another , a continuous nature within the general population , and strengths beyond or as part of significant challenges” . While we have highlighted the many commonalities between different neurodiverse conditions , it is important to acknowledge that these conditions exist on a spectrum . Indeed , there is often no clear line demarcating a formal diagnosis of a neurodiverse condition . Consequently , many children remain undiagnosed , and characteristics typically associated with neurodiverse conditions can also be found throughout the child population . We argue that taking a strength - focused individualized approach to involvement in PD is a philosophy that can benefit the wider child population . It allows us to focus on each child’s capability set , rather than consider where children are in accordance with a baseline . Guided by our framework , PD can be adapted to help maximize any child’s potential for making meaningful contributions to the design process . This draws parallels with the work of Van Rijn [ 25 ] who highlights the challenges of designers working with ‘extreme’ user groups they share little in common with , and how insights from designing with one particular group can actually contribute to an understanding of how to design for any user group . We therefore hope HCI researchers begin to consider how a neurodiverse approach might apply more generally within the child population , as well as to teams of children with mixed cognitive styles .
