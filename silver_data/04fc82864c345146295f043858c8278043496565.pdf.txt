Whereas the organization of muscle myo ﬁ brils and mechanism regulating their contractility are relatively well - established , the principles by which myosin - II activity and force - balance are regulated in non - muscle cells have remained elusive . We show that Cal - desmon , an important component of smooth muscle and non - muscle cell actomyosin bundles , is an elongated protein that functions as a dynamic cross - linker between myosin - II and tropomyosin - actin ﬁ laments . Depletion of Cal - desmon results in aberrant lateral movement of myosin - II ﬁ laments along actin bundles , leading to irregular myosin distribution within stress ﬁ bers . This manifests as defects in stress ﬁ ber network organization and contractility , and accompanied problems in cell morphogenesis , migration , invasion , and mechanosensing . These results identify Caldesmon as critical factor that ensures regular myosin - II spacing within non - muscle cell actomyosin bundles , and reveal how stress ﬁ ber networks are controlled through dynamic cross - linking of tropomyosin - actin and myosin ﬁ laments . Contractile actomyosin bundles , composed of thin actin ﬁ laments and thickmyosinII ﬁ laments , arekeyforceproducersandmechanosensors in diverse animal cell types and tissues . They include myo ﬁ brils of striated muscles , contractile ﬁ laments of smooth muscles , and stress ﬁ bers of non - muscle cells 1 , 2 . Myo ﬁ brils are comprised of regular , repetitive patterns of the force - generating and load - bearing devices , called sarcomeres . The force for muscle contraction is generated by ATP - dependent sliding of bipolar myosin II ﬁ laments along a bipolar array of actin ﬁ laments within the sarcomeres . Muscle contraction is activated by Ca 2 + released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the troponin – tropomyosin ( Tpm ) complex . Ca 2 + - binding to troponin induces a conformational change , which shifts the position of Tpm along the major groove of the actin ﬁ lament to allow actin – myosin interactions and muscle contraction 3 . Two structures within the sar - comeres , the Z - disc and the M - band , anchor actin and myosin II ﬁ la - ments to an elastic ﬁ lament system that is composed of giant protein titin . The Z - disc harbors α - actinin cross - linked antiparallel actin ﬁ la - mentsfromtheadjacentsarcomeresandseveralassociatedproteins 4 , 5 . M - band at the center of the sarcomere is composed of a hexagonal array of proteins including myomesins that position the myosin II ﬁ laments to the middle of the sarcomere , and are hence critical in controlling the force imbalances during muscle contraction 6 .

Stress ﬁ bers are key mechanosensing elements in non - muscle cells , and they share many structural components with muscle sarcomeres 7 – 11 . However , smooth muscle and non - muscle cells lack many key components of striated muscle myo ﬁ brils , such as proteins of the M - band . Therefore , how the organization of actomyosin bundles within contractile units is main - tained , and how the force imbalances during contraction are con - trolled in smooth muscles and non - muscle cells have remained elusive 1 , 2 . Moreover , stress ﬁ bers and smooth muscle actomyosin bundles do not express the troponin complex , and thus the mechan - isms controlling their contractility are incompletely understood . Although stress ﬁ bers and smooth muscle actomyosin bundles lack certain key components of striated muscle myo ﬁ brils , they con - tain other proteins that may functionally replace central striated muscle components . These include actin / myosin - binding protein Caldesmon , whichhas smooth muscle ( H - Caldesmon ) and non - muscle cell ( L - Caldesmon ) speci ﬁ c splicevariants . Apartfromthe ~ 250residue regions in the center of H - Caldesmon , the two splice variants are identical to each other 12 , 13 . The N - terminal ~ 200 residue region of Cal - desmon interacts with both myosin II and calmodulin 14 , and the C - terminal ~ 200 residue region binds actin ﬁ laments , tropomyosin , and calmodulin 15 – 18 . The C - terminal region of Caldesmon inhibits the actin - activated ATPase of myosin II in vitro , and the binding of cal - modulinto thisregiondecreases its af ﬁ nity forF - actin and releases the inhibition 19 – 21 . Based on biochemical studies , several different func - tions for Caldesmon were proposed . According to the popular view , Caldesmon regulates actomyosin contractility in a Ca 2 + / calmodulin and phosphorylation - dependent manner and is hence functionally equivalent to the skeletal muscle troponin complex 13 . Caldesmon was additionally proposed to stabilize actin ﬁ laments to maintain the structural integrity of actomyosin bundles 22 , 23 , and stabilize the latch - state of myosin II capable of maintaining force for long periods with low energy consumption 24 . Despite extensive biochemical data , the in vivo function of Cal - desmon has remained elusive . Knockout mice , lacking both L - Caldesmon and H - Caldesmon , die perinatally 25 , whereas speci ﬁ c deletion of the H - Caldesmon resulted in defects in arterial muscle relaxation 26 . Innon - musclecells , Caldesmonover - expressionincreases the thickness of stress ﬁ bers in lung carcinoma A549 cells , and depletion of Caldesmon by RNAi resulted in thinner stress ﬁ bers 27 . On the other hand , over - expression of Caldesmon decreased the con - tractilityofSV80cells 28 . Whetherthesephenotypesresultfromdefects in actomyosin bundle organization , increased contractility of acto - myosin bundles , from the loss of myosin II latch - state , or from some other defects in actomyosin bundles is not known . Altered expression levels of Caldesmon are also linked to the progression of many cancers 29 , 30 and developmental abnormalities 25 , 31 – 33 , but the underlying mechanism has remained elusive . Here , we revealed that Caldesmon is an extended protein that displays a highly dynamic association with stress ﬁ bers . Importantly , studiesonCaldesmonknockoutandrescuecellsprovideevidencethat Caldesmon does not function as a negative regulator of myosin II activity , but that it instead cross - links myosin ﬁ laments and actin - tropomyosin ﬁ laments to maintain the regular spacing of myosin II ﬁ laments within actomyosin bundles . Our ﬁ ndings reveal how force imbalances in actomyosin bundles , and the organization of the mechanosensitive stress ﬁ ber networks , are controlled through dynamic cross - linking of actin and myosin ﬁ laments . Results Caldesmon is a dynamic component of contractile stress ﬁ bers Caldesmon associates with stress ﬁ bers in non - muscle cells 28 , 34 , but its precise localization within actomyosin bundles has not been reported . We applied 3D super - resolution structured illumination microscopy ( 3D - SIM ) on U2OS cells immunostained with Caldesmon - speci ﬁ c antibody , and on cells expressing mCherry - fusion of Caldesmon . Both endogenous Caldesmon and mCherry - Caldesmon displayed periodic localizationpatterns along the contractile ventralstress ﬁ bers and transverse arcs but were absent from the non - contractile dorsal stress ﬁ bers ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . Caldesmon localization appears to be independent of rapid actin dynamics because dimin - ishing actin ﬁ lament assembly by Latrunculin - A treatment did not displace Caldesmon from stress ﬁ bers ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Several proteins , such as NM - IIA , NM - IIB , myosin - 18B , and tropo - myosins show relatively stable association with stress ﬁ bers , whereas othersincludingpalladin , α - actinin , VASP , andcalponin - 3display rapid dynamics at stress ﬁ bers 7 , 9 , 35 – 37 . Fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) experiments on ventral stress ﬁ bers of U2OS cells expressing either GFP - Caldesmon or GFP - NM - IIA revealed that Cal - desmon is a highly dynamic stress ﬁ ber component , with halftime of approximately 1 – 2 s . As reported earlier 7 , 38 , the recovery of NM - IIA heavy - chain was much slower compared to Caldesmon ( Fig . 1b , d , e ) . Because Caldesmon was proposed to regulate myosin II activity in vitro 21 , we also tested the possible effects of myosin II inhibition on Caldesmon dynamics . Inhibiting the ATPase activity of myosin II by para - amino - blebbistatin 39 did not result in detectable effects on Cal - desmon dynamics at stress ﬁ bers ( Fig . 1c and f ) . Together , these experiments show that Caldesmon localizes to myosin II - containing , contractile stress ﬁ bers and is a highly dynamic component of these actomyosin bundles . Caldesmon is an extended molecule that cross - links the necks of myosin II ﬁ laments to tropomyosin - actin ﬁ laments To reveal the precise localization of Caldesmon , and its different protein domains within stress ﬁ bers , we performed 3D - SIM on U2OS cells expressing a Caldesmon construct fused to mCherry at its N - terminus and to GFP at its C - terminus . Interestingly , the N - and C - terminal mCherry and GFP of Caldesmon did not co - localize with each other at stress ﬁ bers , but were separated from each other by ~ 0 . 3 µ m ( Fig . 2a , b ) . This provides evidence that in cells Caldesmon is anextendedprotein . WenextexaminedtherelationshipofCaldesmon and myosin II in more detail by staining mCherry - Caldesmon expres - sing U2OS cells with NM - IIA coiled - coil and NM - IIA regulatory light - chain ( RLC ) - speci ﬁ c antibodies . 3D - SIM analysis revealed that the N - terminalregionofCaldesmonlocalizedtotheneckregionofmyosin II . This is because the mCherry signal displayed two peaks that ﬂ anked theNM - IIAcoiled - coilsignal ( Fig . 2cand e ) , but waslocated inbetween the two myosin motor domain signal peaks within individual NM - IIA bundles ( Fig . 2d and f ) . To uncover the mechanisms by which Caldesmon localizes to stress ﬁ bers , we generated truncated versions of Caldesmon , and expressed those as N - terminal mCherry - fusions in U2OS cells . The N - terminal domain of Caldesmon ( residues 1 – 200 ) , which binds myosinIIinvitro 13 andassociateswiththenecksofmyosinIIbundlesin cells ( Fig . 2c – f ) displayed diffuse cytoplasmic localization with only very weak enrichment to stress ﬁ bers . On the other hand , the C - terminal region of Caldesmon ( residues 380 – 501 ) displayed strong localization to stress ﬁ bers . Moreover , deletion of the C - terminal region resulted in diffuse cytoplasmic localization of Caldesmon ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . However , unlikethe full - length Caldesmon , the C - terminal region ( residues 380 – 501 ) localized also to non - contractile dorsal stress ﬁ bers ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) and displayed relatively uniform / random localization along the contractile ventral stress ﬁ bers ( Supplementary Fig . 2d , e ) . The expression of these con - structs didnotalter the overallcellshape or stress ﬁ ber architecturein wild - type U2OS cells . Because the C - terminal region of Caldesmon binds F - actin 40 and interaction of the full - length smooth muscle Caldesmon to actin ﬁ laments was reported to be enhanced by Tpm 19 , we examined the effects of different stress ﬁ ber - associated Tpms on actin Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 33688 - w Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6032 2 interactions of Caldesmon . Actin ﬁ lament co - sedimentation assay revealed that both full - length Caldesmon and its C - terminal region ( residues 380 – 501 ) bind actin ﬁ laments , with the af ﬁ nity of the full - length Caldesmon being slightly higher ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Binding of both full - length Caldesmon and its C - terminal region were enhanced by saturating actin ﬁ laments with Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm2 . 1 and Tpm3 . 2 , whereas decoration of actin ﬁ laments with Tpm4 . 2 had no detectable effect on Caldesmon binding ( Supplementary Fig . 2f , g ) . Consistent with the biochemical data , the C - terminal domain of Caldesmon displayed slightly less co - localization with Tpm4 . 2 in U2OS cells as compared to other stress ﬁ ber – associated Tpm iso - forms ( Supplementary Fig . 3g ) . b c d 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 4 5 20 10 25 15 30 Time ( s ) F l uo r e sc en c e r e c o v e r y Cald NMIIA 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 4 5 20 10 25 15 30 Time ( s ) F l uo r e sc en c e r e c o v e r y Cald ( control ) Cald ( amBlbb ) e f Pre - Bleach Bleach Post - Bleach 1’’ 10’’ 30’’ C a l d c on t r o l 1 .

Caldesmonassociateswiththeneckregionofmyosin II and with Tpm - decorated actin ﬁ laments through its N - terminal domain and C - terminal domain , respectively . Caldesmon knockout cells display defects in cell morphology and migration To uncover the cellular function of Caldesmon , we generated Caldes - monknockout U2OScelllines using CRISPR / Cas9approach . Following cell sorting ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , Sanger and NGS sequencing were performed for two knockout clones generated by two different guide - RNAs . This con ﬁ rmed complete Caldesmon inactivation in both knockout clones ( Supplementary Fig . 4b – f ) . Both sequenced clones also displayed depletion of Caldesmon protein as determined by Western blotting and by immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Visualizing F - actin by ﬂ uorescent phalloidin and focal adhesions by vinculin - speci ﬁ c antibody in cells grown on ﬁ bronectin - coated coverslips and on crossbow micropatterns revealed that stress ﬁ bers werestillpresentintheknockoutcells , butthestress ﬁ bernetworkwas less regularly organized as compared to wild - type U2OS cells . The dorsal stress ﬁ bers in knockout cells were typically abnormally long , and transverse arcs often displayed a ‘ tilted ’ orientation compared to the leading edge ofcell ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Moreover , Caldesmon knockouts displayed larger cell area as compared to wild - type cells , and were more elongated and irregular - shaped ( Fig . 3c , d ) . These phenotypes could be partially rescued by over - expression of full - length GFP - Caldesmon , demonstrating that they do not result from off - target effects . Caldesmondepletion was alsoaccompaniedby defects in cell motility , as measured from the migration of individual cellsplated on ﬁ bronectin - coated surfaces , and collective migration as measured by wound healing assay ( Fig . 3e – h ; Supplementary Movies 1 – 3 ) . Finally , the transwell matrigel assay revealed a signi ﬁ cant decrease in invasive migration of Caldesmon knockout cells ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5b , c ) . These results demonstrate that Caldesmon is not critical for stress ﬁ ber assembly or maintenance , but its depletion results in abnormal organization of the stress ﬁ ber network , as well as defects in cell morphogenesis , migration , and invasion . Caldesmon is not a negative regulator of stress ﬁ ber contractility Basedonbiochemicaldata , Caldesmonwasconsideredtofunctionasa negative regulator of myosin II 13 . Hence , it is expected that Caldesmon depletion would result in increased contractility of stress ﬁ bers . To examine the role of Caldesmon in stress ﬁ ber contractility , we ﬁ rst applied traction - force microscopy ( TFM ) on wild - type and Caldesmon knockout cells . Surprisingly , these experiments revealed that Caldes - mon knockout cells exert 50 – 75 % diminished contractile forces onto the substrate as compared to the wild - type U2OS cells ( Fig . 4a , b , and Supplementary Fig . 5d , e ) . We next examined the contractility of stress ﬁ bers by monitoring the retrograde ﬂ ow of transverse arcs . These actomyosin bundles are assembled at the lamellipodia – lamellum interface , and they undergo myosin II - dependent retrograde ﬂ ow towards the cell center 7 , 41 . During retrograde ﬂ ow , transverse arcs can fuse with each other to form thicker actomyosin bundles that mature into ventral stress ﬁ bers 42 . Live - cell imaging of wild - type and Caldes - mon knockout cells , transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP - Life - act , on a ﬁ bronectin - coated surface indicated that the knockout cells display slower retrograde ﬂ ow of transverse arcs , and defects in their fusion with each other ( Supplementary Fig . 5f , g ; Supplementary Movies 4 and 5 ) . To study this in a more controlled environment , we utilized ﬁ bronectin - coated circular micropatterns . Live imaging of cells plated on circular ﬁ bronectin islands revealed that the dynamic behavior of stress ﬁ bers was indeed altered in Caldesmon - depleted cells ( Supplementary Movies 6 and 7 ) . Although the retrograde ﬂ ow of transverse arcs was still evident also in the Caldesmon knockout cells , the rate of transverse arc ﬂ ow was diminished by ~ 40 % ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Nuclear localization of downstream transducers of the Hippo pathway , YAP / TAZ , are regulated by substrate rigidity and contractile forces of the cell 43 , 44 . We thus compared nuclear localization of YAP in wild - type and Caldesmon knockout cells plated on 8 and 50kPa matri - ces . Please note that in these experiments Caldesmon was visualized by mouse polyclonal antibody , which also displays non - speci ﬁ c staining in the nuclear and perinuclear regions . When plated on 8kPa matrix , both wild - type and knockout cells exhibited similar , predominantly cyto - plasmic YAP localization . However , in cells plated on 50kPa matrix , YAP displayed more profound nuclear localization in wild - type cells as compared to Caldesmon knockout cells ( Fig . 4e – g ) . Thus , Caldesmon knockout cells have defects in sensing substrate stiffness . To understand in more detailhow depletion of Caldesmon affects themechanical propertiesofindividualstress ﬁ bers , we executed laser nanosurgery experiments on transverse arcs of wild - type and Caldes - mon knockout cells ( Fig . 5a – f ) . Following our previous studies 45 – 48 , we visualized stress ﬁ bers in wild - type and Caldesmon knockout cells through lentiviral transduction with RFP - Lifeact . To standardize cell shape and size and induce strong transverse arc formation , we utilized single - cell micropatterned glass coverslips in crossbow shapes that mimic polarized cell shapes . We then used femtosecond laser ablation to sever selected transverse arcs and ﬁ t the resulting time - dependent retraction to a Kelvin – Voigt ( KV ) model to obtain a time constant ( τ ) and plateau retraction distance ( L o ) . In some cases , arc retraction did not ﬁ t KV retraction kinetics , perhaps because of the disconnect between the curved morphology of the arcs and the linear structure assumed by the KV model . We therefore subjected all SFs to a second , model - independent analysis in which we measured the distance retracted by one end of a cut ﬁ ber 60s after ablation ( Fig . 5b ) . We did not observe statistically signi ﬁ cant differences across the two cell populations in τ , L o , or retraction at 60 s , implying that Cal - desmon does not measurably affect the mechanics of individual transverse arc ﬁ bers ( Fig . 5a – f ) . To provide greater standardization of cell shape and stress ﬁ ber length while investigating the mechanics of ventral stress ﬁ bers , we revisited these studies on rectangular frame micropatterns ( Supplementary Fig . 6a – e ) . Here , a short gap is intro - duced on one edge of the frame to promote the assembly of a ventral Fig . 1 | Caldesmon is a dynamic component of contractile stress ﬁ bers . a Representative 3D - SIM image demonstrates that Caldesmon localizes to con - tractile ventral stress ﬁ bers and transverse arcs , but is absent in non - contractile dorsalstress ﬁ bersinU2OScells .

This geometry also did not yield signi ﬁ cant Caldesmon - dependent differences in single - stress ﬁ ber mechanics . Similar results were obtained through laser ablation experiments repeated on cells cultured on unpatterned , ﬁ bronectin - coated glass ( Supplementary Fig . 6f – i ) . Together , these experiments demonstrate that depletion of Cal - desmon does not result in increased stress ﬁ ber contractility , as would be expected if it would function as a negative regulator of myosin II as previously proposed . Instead , we show that the mechanics of indivi - dual stress ﬁ bers are largely unaltered in Caldesmon knockout cells , whereas the organization of the stress ﬁ ber network and overall forces a b Cald N - terminus Cald C - terminus N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 8 0 . 6 Line scan ( µm ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 e f mCherry - FL - Cald - GFP 2 . 4 . 3 . 1 . 5 . 1 . 2 . 4 . 3 . 5 . 1 . 0 Myosin tail mCherry - Cald 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 e c ne cs e r ou l f de z il a m r o N i n t en s i t y 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 Line scan ( µm ) 0 . 3 0 . 35 0 . 25 0 . 15 0 . 05 Line scan ( µm ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 mCherry - Cald Myosin RLC N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y 0 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 5 0 . 6 1’ . c mCherry - FL - Cald NMIIA tail + 1’ . 2 . 3 . 5 . 1 . 4 . 1 . 2 . 3 . 5 . 4 . d mCherry - FL - Cald NMIIA RLC + 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 1 . 1’ . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 .

These defects do not arise from decreased myosin activation by phosphorylation , because myosin light chain ( RLC ) phosphorylation was unaltered in the Caldesmon knockout cells ( SupplementaryFig . 7b – h ) . Moreover , FRAPanalysisdemonstratedthe dynamics of NM - IIA heavy chains on ventral stress ﬁ bers were very similar in wild - type and Caldesmon knockout cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7i – j ) . Caldesmon controls the force balance and myosin distribution within stress ﬁ bers Because loss of Caldesmon leads to the abnormal organization of the stress ﬁ ber network , we next analyzed the effects of Caldesmon depletion on the distribution and dynamics of myosin II bundles . Importantly , by staining the cells with an antibody against NM - IIA heavy chain , we revealed anabnormaldistribution of myosin ﬁ laments and ﬁ lament stacks in the knockout cells plated on ﬁ bronectin - coated coverslips , as well as on crossbow micropatterns ( Fig . 6a ; Supple - mentary Fig . 7a ) . NM - IIA ﬁ laments displayed uniform distribution alongtransversearcsand ventralstress ﬁ bersin wild - typecells , butthe leading edges of Caldesmon knockout cells exhibited areaswhereNM - IIA stacks were clumped together , whereas other regions of transverse arcs were completely devoid of NM - IIA . Blind analysis of the images revealed that ~ 50 % of the knockout cells displayed an irregular NM - IIA patternalongstress ﬁ bers , whereasthecorrespondingnumberinwild - type cells was < 5 % ( Fig . 6b ) . This phenotype could be rescued by expressing full - length mCherry - Caldesmon in the knockout cells ( Fig . 6c ) . Interestingly , the distributions of F - actin and different Tpm isoforms were still relatively uniform in the knockout cells ( Supple - mentary Fig . 8c ) , whereas α - actinin distribution was somewhat affec - ted by Caldesmon depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . More detailed 3D - SIM analysis revealed that in wild - type cells , α - actinin displayed complementary localization with Caldesmon with a distance of ~ 0 . 6 μ m between the α - actinin peaks along stress ﬁ bers ( Fig . 7a , b ) . On the other hand , the distances between α - actinin peaks along the stress ﬁ bers of Caldesmon knockout cells were more variable and typically shorter ( Fig . 7a , c – e ) . Similarly , an actin ﬁ lament pointed end capping protein of stress ﬁ bers , Tmod1 , displayed a less regular pattern within stress ﬁ bersofCaldesmonknockoutcellsascomparedtothewild - type cells ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Of note , the actin ﬁ lament barbed end capping protein ( as visualized by eGFP – CP - β 2 construct ) did not localize to stress ﬁ bers in wild - type or Caldesmon knockout cells ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . These results indicate that also the organi - zation of actin ﬁ laments within stress ﬁ bers is somewhat disturbed in the absence of Caldesmon . To explore the role of Caldesmon in myosin distribution in more detail , we performed live - cell imaging of wild - type and Caldesmon knockout cells co - expressing RFP - actin and GFP - NM - IIA . In wild - type cells , myosin ﬁ laments assembled at the lamellipodia – lamellum interface , displayed consistent and uniform ﬂ ow towards the cell center , and eventually fused with each other to form thicker NM - IIA stacks , as reported earlier 49 – 51 . In contrast , NM - IIA movements in Caldesmon knockout cells were less uniform . Although the NM - IIA ﬁ laments appeared to assemble normally at the cell edge , they typi - cally displayed abnormal lateral movements along transverse arcs and were further ‘ pulled ’ unequally towards opposite directions . These events resulted in NM - IIA ﬁ lament accumulation at certain stress ﬁ ber regions as clumps of GFP - NM - IIA puncta , while the remaining stress ﬁ ber regions became devoid of NM - IIA ﬁ laments ( Fig . 6d ; Supple - mentary Fig . 11a , b ; Supplementary Movies 8 – 10 ) . To dissect the functions of different Caldesmon domains in the regulation of NM - IIA distribution along stress ﬁ bers , we performed knockout - rescue experiments using Caldesmon deletion constructs ( Fig . 8a ) . Blind analysis of NM - IIA distribution on transfected cells revealed that full - length mCherry - Caldesmon ef ﬁ ciently rescued the abnormal myosin distribution of knockout cells . In contrast , Caldes - monlackingtheN - terminal ( myosin - binding ) regiondidnotrescuethe phenotype , as ∼ 50 % of cells displayed irregular NM - IIA distribution ( Fig . 8b ) . Please note that this value is similar to the one quanti ﬁ ed from the knockout cells ( Fig . 6b ) . The construct lacking the central region of Caldesmon [ Cald ( 1 – 200 / 374 – 531 ) ] rescued the myosin phenotypetoalargeextent , with ~ 10 % cellsdisplayingirregularNM - IIA distribution . Surprisingly , theconstructcontainingonlytheN - terminal ( myosin - binding ) regionofCaldesmon [ Cald ( 1 – 200 ) ] partiallyrescued the myosin phenotype with ~ 30 % of cells displaying irregular myosin distribution along stress ﬁ bers . However , many ‘ rescue ’ cells expres - sing this construct exhibited another unusual myosin phenotype , in which NM - IIA was largely dissociated from stress ﬁ bers , and accumu - lated in the perinuclear region of the cell ( Fig . 8a , right panel ) . Finally , we carried out knockout - rescue experiments with a smooth muscle Caldesmon isoform ( H - Cald ) , which is identical to the non - muscle L - Cald , apart from harboring ~ 250 residues longer linker region between the N - and C - terminal domains of the protein . Blind analysis of NM - IIA distribution revealed that H - Cald rescues the knockout phenotype quite well , but not to the same extent as the L - Cald ( Supplementary Fig . 11c , d ) , indicating that the length of Caldesmon molecule may be ﬁ ne - tuned to match the myosin II isoform expressed in the corre - sponding cell - type . Collectively , these experiments revealed that Caldesmon pre - vents abnormal lateral ‘ sliding ’ of myosin II ﬁ laments along actin ﬁ la - ments and is therefore critical for maintaining the regular distribution of myosin II along stress ﬁ bers . Discussion The mechanisms by which contractile actomyosin bundles are assembled in different cell types are relatively well understood , but how myosin II activity and force balance are controlled within con - tractile actomyosin bundles of smooth muscle and non - muscle cells has remained elusive . Here , we provide evidence that Caldesmon is critical for controlling myosin II distribution and force - balance within actomyosin bundles in non - muscle cells . We show that : ( 1 ) Caldesmon is an extended and highly dynamic component of contractile stress ﬁ bers , where it links myosin II ﬁ laments to speci ﬁ c tropomyosin - actin ﬁ laments , ( 2 ) Caldesmon does not function as a negative regulator of Fig . 2 | CaldesmonisanextendedproteinanditsN - terminaldomainassociates with theneck ofmyosin II ﬁ lament . a Representative exampleof a3D - SIM image obtained from U2OS cell expressing full - length Caldesmon in which mCherry ( magenta ) and GFP ( green ) were fused to the N - and C - termini of the protein , respectively .

Our experiments provide evidence that the non - muscle Caldes - mon splice variant ( L - Caldesmon ) , is an extended molecule , whose N - terminal domain associates with the neck regions of myosin II molecules within NM - IIA ﬁ laments , while the C - terminal region of L - Caldesmon binds speci ﬁ c tropomyosin – actin ﬁ laments .

Interestingly , our results propose that Caldesmon associatesslightlybetterwithactin ﬁ lamentsdecoratedby non - muscle tropomyosin isoforms Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm2 . 1 , and Tpm3 . 2 , as compared to Tpm4 . 2 - decorated or bare actin ﬁ laments . In this context , it is impor - tant to note that stress ﬁ bers are composed of functionally distinct actin ﬁ laments that are speci ﬁ ed by different tropomyosin isoforms , and from these Tpm4 . 2 is most closely associated with myosin II function 9 , 58 . Caldesmon may thus preferentially interact with those actin ﬁ lamentsthatdonotform ‘ tracks ’ formyosinIImovement . These data , together with our FRAP and domain depletion experiments , demonstrate that Caldesmon is a dynamic component that cross - links myosin II to tropomyosin - actin ﬁ laments ( Fig . 8c ) . PreviousstudiesproposedthatCaldesmonfunctionsasanegative regulator of myosin II and / or it stabilizes actin ﬁ laments within con - tractile actomyosin bundles 13 , 27 . However , several lines of evidence from our work are not consistent with these earlier models . First , loss of Caldesmon results in decreased overall contractility and retrograde ﬂ ow of the stress ﬁ ber network . Caldesmon depletion also does not increase the pre - stress within individual stress ﬁ bers , as would be expected if Caldesmon would function as a troponin - like negative regulator of myosin II activity . Second , the N - terminal myosin II - binding domain of Caldesmon is absolutely critical for the cellular function of the protein . On the other hand , the isolated C - terminal actin - binding region of Caldesmon still localizes to stress ﬁ bers , but cannotrescuetheCaldesmon knockout phenotype , althoughprevious biochemical studies proposed that this domain alone can regulate myosin II movement along actin ﬁ laments in a Calmodulin - regulated manner 13 . Finally , Caldesmon is a highly dynamic component of stress ﬁ bers and appears to preferentially associate with those tropomyosin – actin ﬁ laments that are not linked to myosin II move - ment . Thus , Caldesmon is not well - suited to function as a ‘ road block ’ for myosin II movement . It is also important to note that , since stress ﬁ bers are still present in Caldesmon - depleted cells , and because the N - terminal myosin II - binding domain is critical for its function in non - muscle cells , Caldesmon is also unlikely to function as an important stabilizer of actin ﬁ laments within stress ﬁ bers . Our results reveal that Caldesmon prevents abnormal lateral ‘ sliding ’ of myosin II ﬁ laments along actomyosin bundles , and is thus critical in maintaining uniform spacing between individual myosin II ﬁ laments within stress ﬁ bers ( Fig . 8d ) . Thus , rather than functioning as a negative regulator of myosin II similarly to troponin complex in striated muscles , we provide evidence that Caldesmon functionally resembles the M - band components of skeletal muscle sarcomere that are critical for maintaining the force - balance in muscles 6 . However , at the molecular level Caldesmon is very different from the M - band proteins , because Caldesmon links myosin II to tropomyosin – actin ﬁ laments , and is a highly dynamic protein within stress ﬁ bers . We speculate that this is due to the rapid dynamics of stress ﬁ bers com - pared to myo ﬁ brils . Thus , in stress ﬁ bers , there is a need for a more dynamic system that maintains uniform myosin II distribution and force balance . Our results , together with earlier studies 10 , 59 – 63 , also suggest that the organization of actin ﬁ laments must be different between skeletal muscle sarcomeres and stress ﬁ bers of non - muscle cells . Unlike the highly regular length of actin ﬁ laments in muscle sarcomeres , we propose that tropomyosin - actin ﬁ laments , especially in transverse arcs , are of irregular length and can often extend beyond the adjacent α - actinin - rich Z - disk - like regions of stress ﬁ bers . This would allow myosin II ﬁ laments to move long distances laterally along transverse arcs , as observed in our live - imaging experiments . More - over , loss of Caldesmon appears to result in the aberrant organization of actin ﬁ laments within stress ﬁ bers , together with laterally moving myosin II ﬁ laments . Although F - actin and tropomyosin distributions appear quite regular within the stress ﬁ bers of Caldesmon knockout cells , α - actinin appears to form larger aggregates in the absence of Caldesmon , and the distributions of α - actinin and Tmod1 along stress ﬁ bers are less regular in Caldesmon knockout cells . We speculate that these phenotypes are linked to the aberrant lateral movement of myosin II ﬁ laments because there are no reports indicating that Cal - desmon would interact with α - actinin or Tmods . In addition to linking myosin II ﬁ laments to Tpm - actin ﬁ laments , Caldesmon may also have more speci ﬁ c functions in cells . This is because Caldesmon also binds calmodulin , and this interaction inhi - bits the actin - binding of Caldesmon 19 , 20 . Thus , the stress ﬁ ber locali - zation of Caldesmon maybe controlled by Ca 2 + / calmodulin . Moreover , as an elongated protein that links the necks of myosin II ﬁ laments to actin ﬁ laments , Caldesmon could , in principle , also function as a mechanosensor within stress ﬁ bers . However , our FRAP experiments revealed that Caldesmon is a highly dynamic component of stress ﬁ bers , and its dynamics are not affected by the inhibition of myosin . Thus , if Caldesmon also functions as a mechanosensor , it is most likely able to respond to forces only in a very short time scale . In addition to its role in animal physiology , altered expression levels of Caldesmon were also linked to multiple cancers 13 . Our experiments demonstrate that in osteosarcoma cells , Caldesmon depletion resultsindecreased cell migration and invasion . However , in the complex tissue environment the loss of Caldesmon , and hence the defects in force - balance of actomyosin bundles , are expected to have different effects on cancer progression , depending on the type of cancer and tissue environment . In this context , it is important to note that based on the nuclear localization of YAP , our experiments suggest Caldesmon knockout cells are unable to sense substrate stiffness which is a property associated with cancer progression 64 .

Caldesmon interlinks myosin II to tropomyosin - decorated actin ﬁ laments by associating through its N - terminal domain with the ‘ neck - region ’ of myosin II , and with tropomyosin - actin ﬁ laments through its C - terminal domain . We further propose that myosin II motor domains associate with Tpm4 . 2 decorated - actin ﬁ laments ( refs . 9 , 64 ) , whereasCaldesmonpreferstobindactin ﬁ lamentsdecorated by other non - muscle tropomyosin isoforms . d In wild - type cells ( left ) , myosin II ﬁ laments display regular spacing within transverse arcs .

The polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gel substrates with 26kPa stiffness ( Young ’ s modulus ) were prepared as described previously 75 , 76 on glass - bottomed 35mm imaging dishes ( CELLView TM , Greiner bio - one ) . The gels were covered with ﬂ uorescent 488 - nano beads ( diameter 200nm ) and after that further coated with collagen - 1 . Prior to cell plating , gels were incubated with warmed 10 % FBS and supplement - containing DMEM media for 1 h . Cell transfections and live - cell imaging . Wild - type and Caldesmon KO U2OS cells transfected with GFP - Lifeact construct were incubated for 24 h . Wild - type , untransfected and mCherry - FL - Caldesmon trans - fected U2OS cells were cultured on the collagen - 1 - coated 35mm ima - ging dishes for 2 h at 37°C . After a brief wash , we imaged the attached cells and the ﬂ uorescent beads beneath the cells using the 3I Marianas imaging system ( 3I Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) by bright ﬁ eld and epi - ﬂ uorescence settings before and after cell - detachments by trypsi - nization ( microscope speci ﬁ cations and imaging setup as described before in live - cell imaging section ) . Displacement maps were received by comparing the bead images before and after trypsinization . Trac - tion ﬁ elds were computed from the displacement data by utilizing the principle of Fourier transform traction cytometry as described before 77 , 78 . Cell borders were manually tracked and analyses of differ - ent groups were performed as blind analyses . Laser nanosurgery Laser ablation studies were performed as previously described 47 , 48 . Brie ﬂ y , U2OS cells were transduced with RFP - Lifeact and cultured on either unpatterned surfaces , rectangular frame patterns , or crossbow patterns . Micropatternsweremadeaspreviouslydescribed 46 – 48 Brie ﬂ y , coverslipswereplasma - treatedandthenincubatedwith50 µ g / mlpoly - L - lysine conjugated to polyethylene glycol ( PLL - g - PEG ; SuSoS ) in 10mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , for 1h at room temperature , then rinsed with PBS and deionized water . To pattern the surface , coverslips were placed under a quartz - chrome photomask with micropattern features ( FrontRangePhotomask , featuresweredesignedusingAutoCAD ) . The mask and coverslips were then illuminated using 180nm UV light ( Jelight ) for 15 min and then rinsed with PBS . Both patterned and unpatterned coverslips were incubated with 20 µ g / ml ﬁ bronectin ( EMD Millipore ) in 100mM bicarbonate solution , pH 8 . 5 , overnight at 4 °C , then rinsed with PBS . U20S cells were seeded 3000 – 5000 cells / cm 2 and incubated for 4 – 6 h at 37 °C to allow for attachment and spreading . Imaging and ablation were performed with a ZeissLSM 780 confocal microscope system equipped with a Spectra - Physics Mai - tai laser for multiphoton imaging and ablation . Single stress ﬁ bers were then photo - irradiated with the femtosecond laser to induce an inci - sion . The retraction was tracked every 1 s for 75s and ﬁ t to a Kelvin – Voigt single - exponential model to extract a viscoelastic time constant ( τ ) and plateau retraction distance ( L 0 ) . Retraction curves were excluded from the τ and L 0 datasets if they did not meet all ofthe following criteria for the ﬁ tted KV equation : ( 1 ) adjusted R 2 > 0 . 9 , 2 ) τ < 0 . 8 * imaging window ( τ < 60 ) , and ( 3 ) sum squared errors of pre - diction < 10 . The model - independent analysis of retraction was calcu - lated bysubtracting the distancebetween the severed ends at 60 s and at 0s and dividing by 2 . Random migration assay Random cell migration velocities were studied as reported previously 70 . Wild - type and Caldesmon KO cells untransfected or GFP - FL - Caldesmon transfected were cultured for 2h on a 12 - well plate coated with ﬁ bronectin before imaging . Live - cell imaging was per - formed using a Cell - IQ imaging system by Nikon Plan Fluor ×10 / 0 . 30 Ph1 DL objective ( ﬂ uorescent and phase - contrast mode ) and the time - lapse images of cells were captured with Qimaging Retiga EXi camera ( pixel no . ( W × H ) : 1392 ×1040 ) with 2 ×2 binning at 10 min intervals for 24 h . The system utilizes Cell - IQ Imagen 4 . 1 . 0 and Cell - IQ Analyser 4 . 4 . 0 software for cell imaging and analysis . The ﬂ uorescence and phase - contrast images were stitched and combined together to dif - ferentiatebetweentransfectedandnon - transfectedcells .

Cells col - liding with each other or undergoing division were omitted during the analysis and the measured migration velocities across groups were used to plot scatter box plots . Wound healing assay Wound - healing property of wild - type and Caldesmon KO U2OS cells was assessed by wound healing assay . 5 ×10 5 cells were seeded in a 12 - well culture plate and incubated for 18 – 24 h to form a uniform cell - monolayer . Scratch was made with 200 µ l micropipette tip in the mid - area of every well , media replaced with 10 % FBS + 10 mM HEPES containing - DMEM media and time - lapse live cell imaging performed using Cell - IQ imaging system by Nikon Plan Fluor 10x / 0 . 30 Ph1 DL objective ( phase - contrast mode ) . Images were captured with Q ima - ging Retiga EXi camera ( pixel no . ( W × H ) : 1392 ×1040 ) with 2 ×2 bin - ning at 10min intervals for 24 h using Cell - IQ Imagen 4 . 1 . 0software . Time - lapse images were stitched , analyzed to obtain wound area covered ( % ) , length covered ( µ m ) calculated with Cell - IQ Analyser 4 . 4 . 0 software , and used to plot a line graph as means of percent area covered by U2OS wild - type and Caldesmon KO cells from three indi - vidual repeats . 3D - matrigel invasion assay The 3D - matrigel assaywasused to assess the invasive property of wild - type and Caldesmon KO U2OS cells as reported earlier 79 . Cell invasion was performed using 6 . 5mm with 8 . 0 μ m pore polycarbonate mem - brane insert ( CLS3422 - 48EA , Sigma - Aldrich ) as per manufacturer ’ s guidelines . 500 µ l of 300 µ g / ml matrigel was added into the transwell insert without creating bubbles and allowed to polymerize for 30min at 37°C without letting it dry . 500 µ l of serum - free DMEM media was added to the upper chamber of the insert while 20 % FBS containing DMEM was added to the lower chamber , i . e . , into the wellsuch thatthe insert was immersed into the media . 25ng / ml epidermalgrowth factor ( AF - 100 - 15 , Peprotech ) was added to the lower chamber as a che - moattractant . U2OS wild - type and Caldesmon KO cells were trypsi - nized , suspended in 1 . 5 % FBS containing DMEM media , added 5×10 4 cells to the upper chamber , and incubated for 6 h at 37°C . Following incubation , the inserts were removed from wells , washed with PBS , scrapped with moist cotton swabs from inside the insert to remove cells , ﬁ xed ( 4 % paraformaldehyde ) , permeabilized ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , and counterstained with DAPI and phalloidin 488 dyes . The insert was cut , mounted on a slide on Vectashield® Vibrance ™ antifade mounting medium ( H - 1700 - 10 , Vector Laboratories ) , and images were captured with Leica DM5000B upright microscope equipped with ×20 / 0 . 7 HC PL APO CS wd = 0 . 59 objective , DAPI - 5060C ( ex 377 / 50 , em 447 / 60 ) and GFP - 4050B ( ex 466 / 40 , em 525 / 50 ) ﬁ lters and Hamamatsu Orca - Flash4 . 0 V2 sCMOS camera . Minimum ﬁ ve images across different view - ﬁ elds captured for wild - type and Caldesmon KO cells from three replicates . The images were visualizedusingLASX3 . 4 . 2 and processed using Fiji imageJ 1 . 53c software . Kymograph analysis To analyze the ﬂ uctuations in myosin ﬁ laments in wild - type and Caldesmon - depleted U2OS cells , myosin ﬁ laments in transverse arcs ﬂ owing from the cell periphery towards the cell center were tracked for 30min . Time - lapse images of selected transverse arcs collected at 100s intervals were applied to draw the kymographs . DiAna co - localization analyses To determine the percent co - localization volumeand distanceanalysis between two protein molecules in a three - dimensional space , Fiji imageJ 1 . 53c - based DiAna was utilized as described previously 80 . 3D - imageJ suite is essential for executing DiAna tool . For DiAna colocalization analysis , GFP - and mCherry - tagged protein images were captured using GE Deltavision OMX super - resolution microscope as described in the super - resolution imaging section . SIM images con - structed from average intensity projections of Z - stacks were used as source images in DiAna plugin . Green and red channel images were split , and segmented with the 3D - iterative segmentation tool in imageJ using the following criteria ; min vol . pixels : 10 , max vol . pixels : 100 , min threshold / contrast : 10 , elongation criteria ( for F - actin ) , step threshold method with best segmentation and methodvalue : 100 . The segmented images werefurther uploaded in DiAna “ analyze ” option . % volume colocalization and distance between one or more red and green dots were measured from center - to - center , center - to - edge , and edge - to - center of red and green dots . The mean volume co - localized ( % ) and distance ( µ m ) between two protein molecules in different groups were calculated and plotted .

Statistics and reproducibility Single - blind analysis of different groups was performed for the following experiments : Traction force microscopy ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5d , e ) ; live - cell imaging of retrograde arc ﬂ ow ( Fig . 4c , d and Supplementary Fig . 5f , g ) ; laser ablation studies ( Fig . 4h – k and Supplementary Fig . 6a – g ) . Double - blind imaging and analysis were performed for the following experiments : NM - IIA ﬁ lament phenotype in wild - type and Caldesmon KO U2OS cells ( Fig . 5a – c ) ; NM - IIA ﬁ lament rescue phenotype in Caldesmon FL - and domain - null expressing cells ( Fig . 6a , b ) . The YAP localization was quanti ﬁ ed as reported previously 44 , 81 . For analyzing the YAP locali - zation in U2OS wild - type and Caldesmon KO cells ( Fig . 4e – g ) , YAP expression in cell - cytoplasm and nucleus was quanti ﬁ ed using Fiji ImageJ - ROI tool blindly for wild - type and Caldesmon KO cells . Thereafter , the ratiometric expression of YAP in the nucleus : cyto - plasm was calculated by diving YAP - nuclear expression to YAP - cytoplasmic expression . Other experiments followed non - random execution . Densitometric quanti ﬁ cations of Western blots and co - sedimentation assay gels were carried through Image Lab ™ 6 . 0 ( Biorad ) and Fiji imageJ 1 . 53c software . In line plot analysis , the highest mean ﬂ uorescence intensity value was set to 1 AU within the group , and the rest intensity values were normalized to that value . In Western blots , the mean values after quanti ﬁ cations from three experiments were normalized with wild - type protein levels , the mean value of wild - type data was set to one , and the intensities of other groups were normalized to that value . Experiments described in Figs . 1a – d , 3a , g , 6c , 7a , 8a , and Supplementary Figs . 1a – c , 2a , c – d , 3a – e , 5b , f , g , 7b , i , 8a – c , 9a , 10 , 11a – c were repeated at least in three independent experiments , and we observed similar results as shown in the ﬁ gures in every individual repeat . All the values obtained after quanti ﬁ cations were recorded , analyzed , and calculated in spread - sheets using Microsoft excel version - 2016 . The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 . 03 software . Statistical signi ﬁ cance between two groups was assessed by unpaired , non - parametric one - tailed / two - tailed t - tests or by one - way ANOVA while , two - way ANOVA was implemented to compare more than two independent groups . The p - values were adjusted for multiple comparisons and indicate 0 . 05 signi ﬁ cance with 95 % CI . Sig - ni ﬁ cance was determined with Tukey ’ s post hoc HSD analysis and Mann – Whitney / Wilcoxon rank - sum test ( MWW ) . The graphs indi - cate the p - values for respective analyses .
