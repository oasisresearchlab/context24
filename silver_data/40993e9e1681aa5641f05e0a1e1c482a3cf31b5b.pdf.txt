Erm " Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of California School of Medicine , La Jolla , California 92093 - 0668 Abstract . We have used a lipophilic styryl dye , N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( p - diethylaminophenyl - hexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM 4 - 64 ) , as a vi - tal stain to follow bulk membrane - internalization and transport to the vacuole in yeast . After treatment for 60 min at 30°C , FM 4 - 64 stained the vacuole mem - brane ( ring staining pattern ) . FM 4 - 64 did not appear to reach the vacuole by passive diffusion because at 0°C it exclusively stained the plasma membrane ( PM ) . The PM staining decreased after warming cells to 25°C and small punctate structures became apparent in the cytoplasm within 5 - 10 min . After an additional 20 - - 40 min , the PM and cytoplasmic punctate staining disappeared concomitant with staining of the vacuolar membrane . Under steady state conditions , FM 4 - 64 staining was specific for vacuolar membranes ; other membrane structures were not stained . The dye served as a sensitive reporter of vacuolar dynamics , detecting such events as segregation structure formation during mitosis , vacuole fission / fusion events , and vacuolar morphology in different classes of vacuolar protein sorting ( vps ) mutants . A particularly striking pattern was observed in class E mutants ( e . g . , vps27 ) where 500 - 700 nm organelles ( presumptive prevacuolar com - partments ) were intensely stained with FM 4 - 64 while the vacuole membrane was weakly fluorescent . Inter - nalization of FM 4 - 64 at 15°C delayed vacuolar label - ing and trapped FM 4 - 64 in cytoplasmic intermediates between the PM and the vacuole . The intermediate structures in the cytoplasm are likely to be endosomes as their staining was temperature , time , and energy dependent . Interestingly , unlike Lucifer yellow uptake , vacuolar labeling by FM 4 - 64 was not blocked in sec18 , sec14 , end3 , and end4 mutants , but was blocked in secl mutant cells . Finally , using permeabilized yeast spheroplasts to reconstitute FM 4 - 64 transport , we found that delivery of FM 4 - 64 from the endosome - like intermediate compartment ( labeled at 15°C ) to the vacuole was ATP and cytosol dependent . Thus , we show that FM 4 - 64 is a new vital stain for the vacuo - lar membrane , a marker for endocytic intermediates , and a fluor for detecting endosome to vacuole mem - brane transport in vitro . , (cid:127) E C R E T I O N and endocytosis are major mechanisms of membrane flow to and from the plasma membrane ( PM ) ~ in eukaryotic ceils . Plasma membrane equilib - rium is maintained by the addition of secretory vesicles after fusion and subtraction of endocytic vesicles after invagina - tion . Thus , eukaryotic cells must balance secretory and en - docytic traffic to maintain the appropriate protein and lipid content in the PM .

Both pathways consist of vectorial events that encompass a series of vesicular trans - fers from one organelle to another . However , requirements of the secretory pathway have been characterized in greater detail than the requirements for incoming endocytic mem - brane traffic ( Pryer et al . , 1992 ; Rothman and Orci , 1992 ) . Recently , genetic analysis of the endocytic pathway in yeast has resulted in the isolation of mutants defective in en - docytosis . The end3 and end4 mutants were isolated with defects in u - factor internalization and subsequent degrada - tion in the vacuole ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Another mutant renl , defective in receptor endocytosis accumulates the internal - ized a - factor receptor in a prevacuolar compartment ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . These genetic approaches in yeast are begin - ning to complement studies in higher eukaryotic cells . For example , yeast temperature - sensitive actin mutants are de - fective for internalization of a a - factor ( Kubler and Riez - man , 1993 ) , which is consistent with depolymerization of © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 03 / 779 / 14 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 128 , Number 5 , March 1995 779 - 792 779 actin filaments blocking endocytosis at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ) . One drawback , however , in the use of yeast as a model sys - tem for studying endocytosis is the lack of morphological and biochemical approaches that are already well estab - lished in animal cell systems ( Gruenberg and Howell , 1989 ; Salzman and Maxfield , 1993 ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not internalize a variety of ligands that can be used as morphological tracers to visualize intermediates between the PM and the vacuole . Furthermore , no biochemical assay for any endocytic fusion or transport event has been recon - stituted with yeast membranes in vitro . In this report , we have used a morphological and bio - chemical approach to examine endocytosis in yeast with the styryl dye N - ( 3 - thiethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( p - diethyl - aminophenylhexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM 4 - 64 ) . Styryl dyes are sensitive to membrane potentials and have been useful in studying mitochondria ( Bereiter - Hahn , 1976 ) and synaptic vesicle recycling in vitro ( Betz et al . , 1992a ) . We show that FM 4 - 64 initially stains the yeast PM , then small cytoplasmic compartments , and finally the vacuolar membrane . This process is time , temperature , and energy dependent . As a vital stain , FM 4 - 64 allows us to follow transport from the PM to the vacuole membrane in real time . Yeast mutants defective in ER to Golgi transport ( secl8 ) , Golgi transport ( sec14 ) , and receptor - mediated endocytosis ( end3 and end4 ) did not block vacuolar membrane labeling by FM 4 - 64 . However , yeast mutants that accumulate secre - tory vesicles ( i . e . , secl ) did block vacuolar labeling by FM 4 - 64 . Additionally , we have reconstituted transport of FM 4 - 64 from the cytoplasmic intermediates to the vacuole . The data suggest that FM 4 - 64 enters the yeast cell by an endo - cytic mechanism , which may be : ( a ) visualized with fluo - rescence microscopy ; ( b ) distinct from receptor - mediated events ; and ( c ) amenable to biochemical analysis .

All strains were maintained on rich media plates composed of 1 % yeast extract ( Y ) , 2 % bactopeptone ( P ) , 2 % dextrose ( D ) , and 2 . 5 % agar .

FM 4 - 64 was added to 20 - 40 # M from a stock solution of 16 mM in DMSO . The cells were then incubated with shaking for 30 - 60 min if performed at 0°C or 10 - 15 rain at 23 ° and 30 " C . After this preliminary labeling step , the cells were harvested at 700 g for 3 min at room temperature or 40C for the 0°C experiments . The cells were then resuspended in fresh YPD media at 10 - 20 OD60o U / ml , incubated with shaking for various times in kinetic studies or for 30 - 60 rain for steady state experiments . After this " chase " period , the cells were again harvested at 700 g for 3 rain , resuspended at 25 - 40 OD6o0 U / ml in fresh YPD media , placed on standard slides , and viewed . For CDCFDA ( Molecular Probes Inc . ) staining , cells were incubated in YPD media containing 0 . 1 M citrate - KOH , pH 4 . 0 , for 20 min at 23 * or 30°C with 10 tzM CDCFDA added from a 10 mM stock solution in DME The cells were harvested at 700 g for 3 min , resuspended at 25 - 40 OD6oo U / ml in fresh YPD media , placed on standard slides , and viewed . For DASPMI ( Molecular Probes Inc . ) staining , cells were incubated in YPD media with 5 - 10 / ~ g / ml of DASPMI ( added from a 50 t ~ g / ml stock solution in water ) for 5 - 10 min at 23°C , placed on standard slides , and viewed . To measure cell associated FM 4 - 64 , stained cells were converted to spheroplasts ( Vida et al . , 1993 ) and then lysed in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 25 % methanol , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 5 % SDS . After clarifying the lysate with centrifugation at 13 , 000 g for 3 rain , the fluorescence of the su - pernatant was determined in a Perkin Elmer 650 - 10S fluorescence spec - trophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 515 and 640 rim , respectively . Photomicroscopy A Nikon Microphot - SA microscope equipped with a UFX - DX metering system was used for all photomicrographs . A 100x CF N Plan DIC achro - matic objective ( NA 1 . 25 ) was used for all photomicrographs occasionally using a 1 . 5× magnification changer . A 546 nm filter was used for FM 4 - 64 fluorescence and a 450 - 490 nm filter was used for CDCFDA and DASPMI fluorescence . Fluorescence exposures ranged from 8 to 45 s , DIC exposures were 2 - 5 s ( through a No . 1 green filter ) , all using Kodak T - Max 400 film . To immobilize cells , 5 - 7 # 1 ofa 1 mg / ml solution of concanavalin A ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) in water was air dried on 1 × 75 × 25 mm slides . 4 / ~ 1 of a cell suspension was applied and a 22 × 22 mm No . 1 cover - slip was gently layered on top of the cells . These conditions resulted in flat , evenly spread cells and the slide preparations were suitable for viewing up to 30 rain . Reconstitution with Permeabilized Cells All procedures for preparing cytosol and cytosol - free permeabilized yeast spheroplasts were identical to previously described methods ( Vida et al . , 1990 , 1993 ) . Cytosolic extracts were made from TVY614 spheroplasts with the 150 , 000 g supematant having a protein concentration of 29 mg / ml . Results The Styryl Dye , FM 4 - 64 , Is a Vital Stain for the Vacuolar Membrane in Yeast Contractile vacuoles of Dictyostelium discoideum ameba have been vitally stained with the styryl dye FM 4 - 64 ( Heuser et al . , 1993 ) . To determine if this potential sensitive dye would stain the vacuolar membrane of S . cerevisiae , we treated a diploid strain ( BHY10 . 5 ) with FM 4 - 64 . This dye selectively labeled the membrane of structures within the cell that corresponded to the vacuole as viewed by differen - tial interference contrast optics ( Fig . 1 ) . To confirm that the vacuole membrane was stained with FM 4 - 64 , double label - ing with CDCFDA , a vital dye for the vacuole lumen ( Prin - gle et al . , 1989 ) , was used to mark the vacuoles with lumenal fluorescence . The apparent membrane ring staining of FM 4 - 64 was coincident with the internal fluorescence of CDCFDA in the vacuole lumen ( Fig . 1 ) . From this double - labeling analysis , we concluded that FM 4 - 64 was a specific and sensitive dye for the vacuolar membrane in yeast . An Endocytic Mechanism Transports FM 4 - 64from the PM to the Vacuolar Membrane Temperature has played a key role in dissecting receptor - mediated endocytic events in animal cells . Reduced tem - peratures ( < 4°C ) block ligand internalization while ligand Figure 1 . The styryl dye , FM 4 - 64 , stains the vacuolar membrane in yeast . A diploid strain ( BHY10 . 5 ) was incubated at 30°C for 15 min with 40 / ~ M FM 4 - 64 in YPD media . The cells were harvested with centrifugation , the free dye was removed , fresh YPD media was added , and the cells were incubated further at 30°C . After 30 min , the media pH was adjusted to 4 . 0 , CDCFDA was added ( 10 / ~ M final concentra - tion ) , and the cells were incubated an additional 15 min at 30°C . The cells were then viewed under a fluorescence microscope with filters for CDCFDA , FM 4 - 64 , or DIC optics as indicated . Arrows indicate examples of coincident staining between CDCFDA and FM 4 - 64 . Bar , 5 / ~ m . Vida and Emr A Vital Stain for Endocytosis in Yeast 781 binding is unaffected . The earliest characteristics of PM in - ternalization can be observed in cells after warming . To de - termine if an endocytic mechanism was used for internal - ization of FM 4 - 64 in yeast , we stained cells at 0°C , warmed them to 25°C , and followed dye transport over time with fluorescence microscopy . After 30 min at 0°C , FM 4 - 64 ex - clusively stained the cell perimeter , consistent with its possi - ble insertion into the PM ( Fig . 2 , 0 ' ) . Washing away the free FM 4 - 64 followed by warming the ceils allowed us to per - form pulse / chase experiments and track internalization of the dye over time . After just 10 min at 25°C , the PM signal of FM 4 - 64 decreased while small discrete fluorescent dots appeared in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 , 10 ) . Within the next 10 min of incubation at 25°C , these structures were still visible ( Fig . 2 , 20 ) . After 40 min at 25°C , the number of small punctate structures decreased concomitant with vacuolar membrane staining , which increased even further after 60 min ( Fig . 2 , 40 ' and 60 " ) . The vacuolar membrane staining by FM 4 - 64 persisted for more than 4 h of growth ( almost three generations , Fig . 2 , 4h ) . This kinetic analysis of dye uptake closely resembled the expected pattern of an endo - cytic pathway . Particularly striking was the appearance of the presumptive endocytic intermediates , which previously had not been observed in yeast . These fluorescent dots did not appear to exhibit the punctate nature of the Golgi complex in yeast ( Franzusoff et al . , 1991 ) , or the polarized pattern ob - served during endocytic uptake of the STE2 gene product , the u - factor receptor ( Jackson et al . , 1991 ) . FM 4 - 64 showed remarkable stability in the vacuolar membrane , persisting for as long as 4 h in an environment Figure 2 . Kinetics of FM 4 - 64 internalization from the PM and transfer to the vacuole . BHY10 . 5 cells were continuously shaken with 80 # M FM 4 - 64 for 30 rain at 0°C in YPD media . An aliquot was removed and immediately photographed ( indiced as Or ) . The remaining cells were washed , resuspended in fresh media , placed at 25°C , and aliquots were removed and photographed at the times indicated .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 128 , 1995 782 rich in hydrolytic enzymes ( Fig . 2 , 4h ) . To further study the stability of FM 4 - 64 , we stained cells and then allowed the culture to reach stationary phase . After 24 h ( , , o16 cell gener - ations ) , the vacuoles , extremely spherical due to the starved condition of the cells , remained brightly fluorescent indicat - ing that the dye was not degraded ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , within 30 min of restoring the cells to fresh media , vacuole mor - phology changed dramatically showing fragmentation and segregation structure formation ( Fig . 3 B ) . The FM 4 - 64 - staining persisted during these events and served as a sensi - tive , stable marker following these physiologically dynamic processes of the vacuolar membrane . FM 4 - 64 Does Not Stain Mitochondria The apparent specificity of FM 4 - 64 for the vacuolar mem - brane was unexpected . Depending on growth conditions , yeast mitochondria can appear as dots or tubules near the cell periphery ( McConnell et al . , 1990 ) . Because FM 4 - 64 is a membrane potential - sensitive styryl dye , mitochondria were one possibility for the identity of the punctate dot - like structures seen early after warming cells to 25°C ( Fig . 2 , 10 ' ) . Additionally , fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine can stain mitochondria in yeast ( Kean et al . , 1993 ) . To exam - ine this further , we compared FM 4 - 64 staining to the stain - ing pattern of DASPMI , a membrane potential sensitive mi - tochondrial dye ( Bereiter - Hahn , 1976 ) . Cells were stained at 0°C with FM 4 - 64 and warmed to 25°C for 10 - 15 min , to observe the punctate pattern of discrete dots ( Fig . 4 A ) . This pattern was distinct from the tubule mitochondrial structures stained with DASPMI ( Fig . 4 B ) . These double staining experiments revealed no overlaps between FM 4 - 64 and DASPMI in the same cell . Furthermore , mitochondrial staining by DASPMI ( Fig . 4 B ) was observed even at 0°C , conditions where FM 4 - 64 exclusively labeled the PM ( Fig . Figure 3 . FM 4 - 64 is stable and follows vacuolar membrane dy - namics . BHY10 . 5 cells were stained with FM 4 - 64 as described previously ( see Fig . 1 ) .

From this analysis , we concluded that FM 4 - 64 does not stain mitochondrial membranes and it enters the cell by a different mechanism than DASPMI . FM 4 - 64 Uptake from the PM Is Energy Dependent To further characterize the apparent endocytic behavior of FM 4 - 64 uptake , we determined if FM 4 - 64 transport from the PM , to the small punctate organelles , and subsequently to the vacuolar membrane was energy dependent . Cells were incubated at 30°C in rich media with glucose or in rich me - dia with 10 mM NAN3 , 10 mM NaF as energy poisons to block all ATP production . After 10 min in the glucose me - dia , transport from the PM to the small punctate structures was observed , which eventually gave rise to vacuolar mem - brane staining within 60 rain ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , when energy poisons were present , only PM staining was observed ( Fig . 5 ) . Dot - like staining and vacuolar membrane staining was completely inhibited even after 60 min in the presence of energy poisons ( Fig . 5 ) . Additionally , the energy - depleted cells showed a marked decrease in fluorescence intensity . This is most likely due to rapid photobleaching when the membrane potential of the PM was lost as a result of energy depletion . To test this , cells were lysed after 60 min of NaNJNaF treatment and the associated FM 4 - 64 was mea - sured in a spectrofluorometer . Energy starved cells still bound as much as 79 % of the dye compared to cells treated with glucose , suggesting the decrease in staining intensity ( Fig . 5 ) was not due to less cell associated FM 4 - 64 . Vacuole morphology was also sensitive to the loss of cellular ATP . The organdie appeared as a single large spherical compart - ment ( Fig . 5 ) similar to that seen in starved cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . Importantly , the presence of energy poisons was not lethal to the cells even after 60 rain of treatment . When the cells were washed free of NaN3 / NaF and supplied with fresh glucose media , normal vacuolar membrane staining of FM 4 - 64 was observed within another 60 min of incubation ( Fig . 5 , inset ) . Therefore , as expected for an endocytic uptake pro - cess , membrane delivery of FM 4 - 64 from the PM to the vacuole was energy dependent . Internalization at 15°C Allows Trapping FM 4 - 64 in Endocytic Intermediates Another characteristic of endocytosis is the effect intermedi - ate temperatures have on transport rates from the PM to in - Figure 5 . Uptake of FM 4 - 64 and vacuolar membrane staining is energy dependent . A culture of BHYI0 . 5 was harvested , washed once with water , once with YP media , resuspended in YP media , and divided in two equal cultures . One culture received glucose at 2 % final concentration ( Glc ) and the other received NaN3 plus NaF , each at 10 mM final concentration ( NF + F - ) . FM 4 - 64 was added and the cultures were incubated at 30°C . Aliquots from each culture were removed and photographed at 10 ' and 60 ' as indicated .

In yeast , the transport rate of inter - nalized or - factor is sufficiently slowed at 15°C as to allow significant trapping of c ~ - factor in an endocytic compartment between the PM and the vacuole ( Singer and H . Riezman , 1990 ) . We tested these temperature conditions on FM 4 - 64 internalization and vacuolar membrane delivery . After load - ing the PM with FM 4 - 64 at 0°C ( Fig . 6 , 00 ) , cells were shifted to 15°C for 25 min resulting in the apparent accumu - lation of intermediate transport structures ( Fig . 6 , 15° ) . This appearance was not observed after shifting the cells from 0 ° to 30°C for 25 rain where the vacuolar membrane was stained ( Fig . 6 , 30° ) . If cells were placed back at 0°C after the 15°C incubation , the fluorescent intermediates between the PM and the vacuole remained stable and discrete for periods of up to 2 h ( data not shown ) . This permitted a detailed kinetic analysis of FM 4 - 64 delivery from the 15°C compartment to the vacuole within the same cell . After shift - ing cells from 15 ° to 0°C , they were placed on a microscope slide and observed to contain numerous small fluorescent structures throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 , 0 ' ) . Within 2 min of warming to 25°C , some of these structures disap - peared concomitant with the vacuole membrane becoming weakly fluorescent ( Fig . 7 , 2 ' ) . This observation continued during the next 2 rain and by 6 rain very few of the 15°C in - termediates were visible leaving only vacuole membrane fluorescence ( Fig . 7 , 6 ' ) . After 12 min of incubation , the 15°C intermediates were undetectable , leaving the vacuole membrane exclusively fluorescent ( Fig . 7 , 12 ' ) . From this ki - netic analysis , we concluded that FM 4 - 64 could mark two endocytic steps in yeast ; ( a ) transport from the PM to the cy - toplasmic intermediate endosomes ; and ( b ) transport from these intermediate structures to the vacuole . FM 4 - 64 Staining in the Morphological Classes of Vacuolar Protein Sorting ( vps ) Mutants The morphology of the yeast vacuole changes continually due to the dynamic behavior of this organdie throughout the cell cycle . Mutants defective for vacuolar protein sorting , vps , in addition to mislocalizing vacuolar hydrolases also show defects in proper maintenance of vacuole morphology ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . The vps mutants were first classified into three morphological groups ( A - C ) with the use of vital stains and electron microscopy ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . Im - munofluorescence localization of two vacuolar membrane proteins , alkaline phosphatase and the H÷ - ATPase , divided the mutants into three additional morphological groups ( D - F ) ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . The wild - type ( class A ) mor - phology was observed in vps35 ( Fig . 8 A ) ; fragmented vacu - oles ( class B ) were seen in vpsl7 ( Fig . 8 B ) ; very small cytoplasmically dispersed " specks " of fluorescence ( class C ) were detected in vpsl8 ( Fig . 8 C ) ; a single enlarged vacuole ( class D ) was visible in vpsl5 ( Fig . 8 D ) ; a mix of fragmented vacuoles and one to three larger vacuoles ( class F ) were stained in vpsl mutants ( Fig . 8 F ) . In a class E vps mutant , vps27 , the vacuole was only weakly stained but an ' ~ 750 nm membrane - enclosed structure was intensely stained ( Fig . 8 E ) . This organelle is thought to correspond to a prevacuolar intermediate compartment that becomes exaggerated in class E mutants ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Additionally , class E vps mutants have been shown to accumulate the a - factor receptor ( STE3 gene product ) in this compartment ( Davis et al . , 1993 ; Figure 6 . Internalization at 15°C traps FM 4 - 64 in endosomal inter - mediates . BHYIO . 5 cells were stained with FM 4 - 64 for 30 rain at 0°C . An aliquot was removed and immediately photographed ( O°C ) . The remaining cells were harvested , resuspended in fresh media , and split in half . One half was incubated at 30°C while the other was incubated at 15°C ( as indicated ) for 25 min . The sample at 15°C was placed back at 0°C ( to stop all membrane transport ) before photography for FM 4 - 64 fluorescence and DIC optics as indicated . Bar , 2 . 5 # m . Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , in class E vps mutants , FM 4 - 64 appears to become trapped in the same endocytic intermedi - ate that contains internalized a - factor receptor molecules . Effects of sec and end Mutants on FM 4 - 64 Internalization In all vps mutants , FM 4 - 64 labeled the vacuole with an ex - pected pattern , suggesting that internalization from the PM was not severely impaired .

After preshifting these tempera - ture - sensitive mutants to the restrictive temperature ( 370C ) for 30 min , they were incubated with FM 4 - 64 . Neither the secl8 , ( blocked in ER - to - Golgi transport ) nor the secl4 ( Golgi blocked ) mutants inhibited vacuolar staining by FM 4 - 64 at 370C ( Fig . 9 ) . The secl8 mutant did shown reduced intensity of vacuolar membrane staining , suggesting that the overall transport efficiency of FM 4 - 64 may have been affected . In contrast , the secl mutant ( blocked in vesicle - to - PM transport ) did not show vacuolar staining at 37°C but instead exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining with some prominent punctate dots ( Fig . 9 ) . At 23°C , the vacuolar membrane was stained normally , in secl mutant cells ( Fig . 9 ) . The block of vacuolar membrane fluorescence at 37°C in the secl mutant was reversible . After shifting cells back to 230C , vacuolar membrane staining was observed ( data not shown ) . Similar results were obtained with the sec6 , and sec15 mutants that also block secretory vesicles from fusing with the PM ( data not shown ) . From this analysis , no sec mutant blocked internalization of FM 4 - 64 from the PM and only late - acting sec mutants blocked vacuolar delivery of in - ternalized FM 4 - 64 . Recently , two yeast mutants , end3 and end4 , were isolated that specifically show defects in a - factor internalization as well as an apparent defect in fluid - phase endocytosis of Lu - cifer yellow ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . To determine if the end3 and end4 mutants also exhibited defects in FM 4 - 64 uptake or vacuolar membrane staining , we stained these mutant cells at the permissive ( 23°C ) and restrictive ( 37°C ) temper - atures . Both mutants did not show defects in vacuolar mem - brane staining and appeared identical to wild - type cells under the same temperature conditions ( Fig . 10 ) . This sug - gested that FM 4 - 64 could enter the cell independent of END3 and END4 gene functions .

The transfer from this intermediate to the vacuole upon warming occurred within 2 - 6 min and ap - peared to represent a vesicular transport event ( Fig . 7 ) . To further test the apparent vesicular nature of this reaction , we determined if this process could be reconstituted in vitro . We have previously reconstituted intercompartmental protein transport to the vacuole from the secretory pathway using a permeabilized yeast cell system ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . To test for transport of FM 4 - 64 in permeabilized cells , spheroplasts were first loaded with FM 4 - 64 at 0°C , internalized at 15°C , and then subjected to permeabilization by freeze / thaw and a series of hypotonic washes . After spheroplasts were washed under conditions that removed > 98 % of the cytosol ( Vida et al . , 1990 , 1993 ) , they were incubated at 25°C for 60 min . A diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of FM 4 - 64 staining was ob - served ( Fig . 11 ) . The FM 4 - 64 staining was distinct from the vacuolar staining observed with CDCFDA under identical permeabilization conditions ( Fig . 11 ) . When the permeabi - lized cells were incubated with exogenous cytosolic protein extracts or ATP , the diffuse FM 4 - 64 staining pattern ap - Vida and Emr A Vital Stain for Endocytosis in Yeast 787 Figure 9 .

How - ever , when ATP and cytosol were added together , the FM 4 - 64 fluorescence redistributed to the vacuolar membrane ( Fig . 11 ) . This suggested that in vitro transport of FM 4 - 64 from the intermediate compartment to the vacuole requires both energy and cytosolic protein and thus may correspond to a vesicle - mediated transport event . Discussion In this report , we have explored the staining and transport properties ofa styryl dye , FM 4 - 64 , in yeast ceils for the first time . Previously , FM 4 - 64 has been used to follow synaptic vesicle recycling in the frog neuromuscular junction ( Betz et al . , 1992a ) and osmotic regulation in D . discoideum ( Heuser et al . , 1993 ) . Under steady - state conditions in yeast , FM 4 - 64 specifically stains the vacuolar membrane . Delivery of the dye to the vacuole appears to follow an endocytic trans - port route . During a time course of FM 4 - 64 staining , we observed : ( a ) initial PM staining followed by ; ( b ) cytoplas - mic punctate staining , which finally chased to ; ( c ) staining of the vacuole membrane . Similar to other vesicle - mediated transport events , the internalization of FM 4 - 64 and trans - port of the dye to the vacuole exhibited energy , time , and temperature dependence . Energy depletion lead to PM stain - ing exclusively ( Fig . 5 ) . At 0°C , FM 4 - 64 accumulated in the PM while at 150C the dye accumulated in small punctate intermediate compartments that do not correspond to the vacuole or other previously characterized organelles in yeast . Other vital stains like DASPMI or CDCFDA show no Vida and Emr A Vital Stain for Endocytosis in Yeast 789 Figure IL Reconstitution of membrane transport from the 15°C intermediate compartment ( s ) to the vacuole with permeabilized cells in vitro . Spheroplasts from BHY10 . 5 were stained with FM 4 - 64 using the same conditions as described previously ( see Fig . 6 , and Materials and Methods ) . The cells were then subjected to permeabilization with one freeze - thaw cycle and four different washes to remove endoge - nous cytosol . Incubations with buffer alone , ATP , exogenous cytosol , and ATP plus exogenous cytosol were performed for 60 min as indi - cated . All ATP samples included a regeneration mix and cytosolic protein was added back at 5 mg / ml . The upper panel ( Buffer ) shows the same cells stained with CDCFDA demonstrating the presence of vacuoles , all other panels show FM 4 - 64 fluorescence . Bar , 5 ~ m . temperature dependent characteristics . These observations support a model in which FM 4 - 64 staining of the vacuole membrane is mediated by endocytic uptake of the dye and vesicle - mediated transport via an endosome - like intermedi - ate organelle . Thus , FM 4 - 64 represents a useful marker in yeast to visualize bulk lipid transport from the PM to the vacuole . The unexpected specificity of FM 4 - 64 for vacuolar mem - branes and not other organelles underlies its use as a precise intracellular marker . This specificity also implies that FM 4 - 64 mirrors a natural pathway for endocytosis of endoge - nous PM lipids and proteins . Using fluorescent - labeled phosphatidylcholine , an endocytic pathway to the vacuole and a nonendocytic pathway to mitochondria have been de - scribed in yeast ( Kean et al . , 1993 ) . FM 4 - 64 appears to fol - lows an endocytic pathway . However , other possibilities could explain the characteristics of FM 4 - 64 internalization . For instance , the cytoplasmic intermediate structures could be lipid droplets or large complexes of lipid carrier proteins . These would need to selectively extract components out of the PM ( along with FM 4 - 64 ) and specifically shuttle them to the vacuole . These two characteristics argue against a lipid droplet but a specific carrier protein complex could possibly perform such a task ( Pagano , 1990 ) . This putative carrier protein would need to transfer significant amounts of phos - pholipid to maintain FM 4 - 64 fluorescence in the cytoplasm because styryl dyes like FM 4 - 64 are preferentially fluores - cent in lipid bilayers ( Betz et al . , 1992a ) . Furthermore , the fluorescent intermediates trapped at 15°C were not washed out of the cytoplasm under conditions that remove > 98 % of cytosolic protein when making permeabilized cells ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) , which further argues against a carrier protein . This makes a carrier protein mechanism somewhat unlikely . The data favor a model in which endosomes or clusters of endocytic vesicles function as intermediates in transport of FM 4 - 64 from the PM to the vacuole . Until recently , endocytosis has been difficult to study in yeast . Yeast , unlike mammalian cells , do not internalize a The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 128 , 1995 790 wide array of physiological ligands that can serve as endo - cytic markers for receptor - mediated or fluid - phase events . For this reason , enveloped viruses ( Makarow , 1985a ) , u - amylase , fluorescent dextrans ( Makarow , 1985b ) , and LY have all been used to study endocytic events in yeast ( Riez - man , 1985 ) . Receptor - mediated internalization of the a - and c ~ - factor mating pheromones is the most reliable measure for biologically relevant endocytic events in yeast . Two mutants defective in receptor - mediated internalization of a - factor ( end3 and end4 ) have been reported ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . The end3 and end4 mutants also show defects in LY uptake , sug - gesting that they also affect fluid - phase endocytosis ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Other yeast mutants like sec18 , sec7 , and sec14 , have also been reported to block LY from staining the vacu - ole ( Riezman , 1985 ) . However , these mutants did not com - pletely block FM 4 - 64 uptake and transport to the vacuole membrane . This might suggest that FM 4 - 64 enters the cell by a non fluid - phase uptake mechanism . It should be noted , however , low rates of fluid phase endocytosis could go un - detected with LY as a fluid phase marker ( Riezman , H . , per - sonal communication ) . Thus , the lack of a detectable LY sig - nal in the vacuole of the end3 and end4 mutants may not indicate a complete block in fluid phase uptake . Surprisingly , FM 4 - 64 was blocked from reaching the vacuole in the late acting sec mutants , which accumulate Golgi - derived secretory vesicles . In these late sec mutants ( e . g . , secl ) FM 4 - 64 was observed as diffuse punctate stain - ing in the cytoplasm , suggesting that internalization of FM 4 - 64 is not blocked in late sec mutants but transfer of the dye to the vacuole from these cytoplasmic intermediates is blocked . These observations suggest that certain of the late acting SEC gene products may also function in the early en - docytic pathway ( Riezman , 1985 ) . Distinct gene products may facilitate the pathway for FM 4 - 64 uptake and transport to the yeast vacuole . The selective vacuole membrane staining by FM 4 - 64 pro - vides a major improvement in the visual detection of vacuo - lar organdie morphology and dynamics . Vital stains like FITC , the endogenous fluorophore in ade2 mutants , and CDCFDA have played important roles in studying vacuole morphology and inheritance ( Weisman et al . , 1987 ) . How - ever , these dyes share similar disadvantages in that they are lumenally sequestered and all passively diffuse across mem - branes into the vacuole independent of vesicle carriers . FM 4 - 64 is the first vital stain specific for the vacuolar mem - brane and its use allows unencumbered views of organelle structure . For instance , with lumenal stains , the distinct identity of small vacuoles clustered together is often difficult to observe . However , with just the vacuole membrane stained by FM 4 - 64 , these types of structural variations are easily resolved and identified . The morphological classes of vps mutants also support the vacuolar membrane specificity of FM 4 - 64 . With certain vps mutants , the vacuole follows predictable albeit aberrant structural changes , which is most severe in class B and C vps mutants ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . FM 4 - 64 staining in all vps mutants tested gave the predicted pat - tern of change observed for each mutant class . Most interest - ing was the class E morphology where a distinct organdie proximal to the vacuole stained intensely with FM 4 - 64 . This is very similar in appearance to the initial demonstra - tion of this compartment using antibodies against the vacuo - lar H÷ - ATPase for immunofluorescence staining ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Remarkably , FM 4 - 64 localization in a class E vps mutant was nearly identical in appearance to the local - ization pattern observed for the a - factor receptor ( STE3 gene product ) in the class E renl ( vps2 ) mutant , defective in recep - tor endocytosis and turnover ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . The appar - ent increased concentration of FM 4 - 64 in this compartment most likely reflects decreased membrane transport to the vacuole or fluorescent instability due to membrane potential decrease of the vacuolar membrane . Thus , in class E vps mu - tants , transport to the vacuole appears to be impaired . Using FM 4 - 64 as a marker , a new pathway in yeast mem - brane traffic has been opened up to biochemical and genetic analysis . The permeabilized cell system we developed to study biosynthetic protein traffic to the vacuole ( Vida et al . , 1990 , 1993 ) and formation of vacuole segregation structures ( Conradt et al . , 1992 ) is now useful for studying transport from the 15°C endocytic intermediate compartment to the vacuole ( Fig . 11 ) . Internalized label was not washed out of the cell along with cytosolic proteins , indicating the inter - mediate compartment retains strong association with per - meabilized cells , possibly to cytoskeletal components . The ATP and cytosol dependence of in vitro vacuolar membrane staining with FM 4 - 64 indicates that at the simplest level , a fusion reaction must take place between the intermediates and the vacuole . It seems more likely , however , that vesicles bud from the intermediate compartment ( s ) and mediate transport of dye to the vacuole . Further evidence will be re - quired to prove that a vesicle - mediated transport reaction is reconstituted between the 15°C endocytic intermediate com - partment and the vacuole . Using recently developed proce - dures to purify endocytic intermediates from yeast ( Vida et al . , 1993 ; Singer - Kruger et al . , 1993 ) , it may be possible to isolate and characterize the putative vesicles that bud from FM 4 - 64 - labeled intermediates . Additionally , FM 4 - 64 could be a useful marker for fluorescence activated cell sort - ing to isolate yeast mutants that cannot take up the dye .
