B . Stradal 4 and Giorgio Scita 1 , 2 , 8 Actin - crosslinking proteins organize actin into highly dynamic and architecturally diverse subcellular scaffolds that orchestrate a variety of mechanical processes , including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in motile cells . How signalling pathways control and coordinate the activity of these crosslinkers is poorly defined . IRSp53 , a multi - domain protein that can associate with the Rho - GTPases Rac and Cdc42 , participates in these processes mainly through its amino - terminal IMD ( IRSp53 and MIM domain ) . The isolated IMD has actin - bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo . However , the manner of regulation of this activity in the full - length protein remains largely unknown . Eps8 is involved in actin dynamics through its actin barbed - ends capping activity and its ability to modulate Rac activity . Moreover , Eps8 binds to IRSp53 . Here , we describe a novel actin crosslinking activity of Eps8 . Additionally , Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro , enhancing IRSp53 - dependent membrane extensions in vivo . Cdc42 binds to and controls the cellular distribution of the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex , supporting the existence of a Cdc42 – IRSp53 – Eps8 signalling pathway . Consistently , Cdc42 - induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8 . Collectively , these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex , regulated by Cdc42 , contributes to the generation of actin bundles , thus promoting filopodial protrusions . The dynamics of actin filaments and their architectural organization into ordered arrays are essential for a variety of cellular processes requiring the generation of mechanical forces . A plethora of actin - binding pro - teins regulate the rate of actin turnover , and the cellular location and architectural organization of filamentous actin 1 , 2 . Actin crosslinking and / or bundling proteins organize actin into arrays by mediating a bivalent interaction between actin filaments to form networks that support subcellular structures , such as lamellipodia , filopodia , stress fibres and focal adhesions . The diversity and complexity of these structures is determined by the activity of several crosslinking proteins 3 – 6 . More than 23 different classes of proteins crosslink actin filaments 7 , raising the question of whether they act redundantly or exert specific functions . Additionally , it is largely unknown how the activity of these crosslinkers is regulated and coordinated by signalling pathways . Among the actin - based , crosslinked structures are filopodia and den - dritic extensions , such as neurites . Filopodia are rod - like membrane pro - trusions formed by parallel bundles of actin filaments . They are thought to be guiding or exploratory devices , probing the space ahead of pro - truding leading edges of advancing lamellipodia 8 . In neurons , filopodia have been observed at the cortical outer boundaries of growth cones , guiding their path and along neurites where they often precede the for - mation of dendritic spines 9 . How these protrusions are initiated and maintained are two major unanswered questions . One attractive model proposes that filopodia are initiated from the cell leading edge where few actin filaments , embedded in a highly - branched array , coalesce into crosslinked bundles 10 . To initiate these bundles , filaments must be locally crosslinked and their barbed ends protected from capping . Ena – VASP family proteins may fulfil this role by localizing at the tips of filopo - dia and favouring clustering of filaments 10 – 12 . Alternatively , formins are thought to have a key role in these events 13 by processively promoting the linear elongation of actin filaments and competing with cappers 14 – 16 . Whatever the case , bundling proteins are required to crosslink filaments , generating stiff rods that can overcome membrane resilience and the tendency of filaments to buckle 17 . 1 Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare ( IFOM ) , Via Adamello 16 , 20139 , Milan , Italy . 2 Department of Experimental Oncology , Istituto Europeo di Oncologia ( IEO ) , Via Ripamonti 435 , 20141 , Milan , Italy . 4 Signalling and Motility Group , German Research Centre for Biotechnology ( GBF ) , Mascheroder Weg 1 , D - 38124 Braunschweig , Germany . 5 Institute for Human Genetics , University Hospital Eppendorf , Hamburg Martinistrasse 52 , D - 20246 Hamburg , Germany . 6 Dipartimento di Medicina , Chirurgia ed Odonoiatria , Università degli Studi di Milano , 20122 Milan , Italy . 7 These authors contributed equally to this work . 8 Correspondence should be addressed to G .

This protein is implicated in filopodia formation in mesenchymal cells , in promoting the formation of branched neurites and dendritic spines in neuronal cells 19 – 21 , 24 and is also involved in the formation of lamellipodia 25 . This dual function of IRSp53 is reflected by its ability to bind Rac and WAVE2 , which are essential for lamellipodia formation 23 , 25 , and Cdc42 ( ref . 21 ) and Mena 19 , which are implicated in filopodia extension . Finally , IRSp53 is characterized by a conserved actin crosslinking domain , the IMD 20 , 26 . The isolated , dimeric IMD is sufficient to elicit filopodia - like protru - sions , underpinning its importance in this process . However , the regula - tion of this activity in full - length IRSp53 , and its mechanisms of action in vivo , remain largely unknown . Additional complexity is derived from the observation that one of the main proteins that interacts with IRSp53 is Eps8 ( ref . 27 ) . Eps8 is involved in actin dynamics through its ability to activate Rac by forming a complex with Abi1 ( an interactor of the non - receptor tyrosine kinase , Abl ) , Sos - 1 ( an exchange factor for Ras and Rac ) and phosphatidylinosi - tol - 3 - kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) 28 – 30 , the stability of which is increased by associa - tion with IRSp53 ( ref . 27 ) . Furthermore , Eps8 possesses barbed - ends capping activity 31 , 32 that directly modulates actin - based motility . This function is regulated through protein – protein interactions 31 , 32 , suggest - ing that the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex may coordinate barbed - ends cap - ping and actin - crosslinking activity in a signalling - dependent manner , leading to the generation of membrane protrusions . Here , we investigate this possibility . RESULTS The Eps8 – IRSp53 interaction involves multiple surfaces Eps8 was previously reported to bind IRSp53 ( ref . 27 ) . To assess the physiological relevance of this association , coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) derived from eps8 - knockout mice and their matched eps8 - reconstituted cells . IRSp53 specifically interacted with Eps8 ( Fig . 1a ) . The association was constitutive and independent of stimulation by growth factors , such as platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ; Fig . 1a ) and epidermal derived growth factor ( EGF ; data not shown ) . Mapping of the interaction surfaces by coimmunoprecipitation ( Fig . 1b , d , e ) and in vitro pulldown experiments ( Fig . 1c , d ) revealed that the SH3 domain of IRSp53 can associate with two distinct proline - rich regions of Eps8 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Notably , the SH3 domain of Eps8 also bound to IRSp53 ( data not shown ) , consist - ent with the presence of a PXXDY motif ( the minimal consensus sequence recognized by the SH3 domain 33 ) in IRSp53 ( Fig . 1d ) . This suggests that multivalent interactions mediate the formation of an IRSp53 – Eps8 complex . However , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 is the critical interaction surface as a mutant of IRSp53 lacking a functional SH3 domain ( IRSp53 W413G ) was no longer able to bind Eps8 ( Fig . 1e ) . Conversely , an SH3 - impaired Eps8 mutant 30 retained full binding ability to IRSp53 ( Fig . 1e ) . Furthermore , determination of the binding affinity between IRSp53 and Eps8 revealed an affinity constant in the nanomo - lar range ( Fig . 1f ) , indicating that IRSp53 and Eps8 form a tight SH3 - mediated complex . Finally , the interaction between Eps8 and IRSp53 is specific , as of the three Eps8 - related proteins 34 , only Eps8L1 weakly associated with the SH3 domain of IRSp53 ( Fig . 1g ) . The IRSp53 – Eps8 complex bundles actin filaments in vitro Both Eps8 and IRSp53 contain domains that mediate a direct interac - tion with F - actin 20 , 31 — the IMD of IRSp53 dimerizes and crosslinks F - actin 20 , 26 — however , the mechanisms that enable IRSp53 to exert its actin - filaments - bundling activity , both in vitro and in vivo , are ill defined . Conversely , the isolated Eps8 carboxy - terminal region efficiently caps the barbed ends of actin filaments 31 . This function is self - inhibited in the context of full - length Eps8 ( refs 20 , 31 ) , and binding of Eps8 to Abi1 relieves this inhibition 31 . Thus , we examined the possibility that the asso - ciation between IRSp53 and Eps8 regulates either the barbed - ends cap - ping function of the Eps8 or the bundling activity of IRSp53 . Purified recombinant IRSp53 had no effect on the ability of the iso - lated Eps8 barbed - capping domain ( data not shown ) or the Eps8 – Abi1 complex to inhibit barbed - ends growth in spectrin – actin seeds actin - polymerization assays ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . Furthermore , in the same assay , IRSp53 did not induce the barbed - ends capping activity of full - length Eps8 , either alone or in the presence of a tenfold molar excess of GTP - loaded Rac or Cdc42 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . The concentrations of IRSp53 and Eps8 were higher than their dissociation constant ( Fig . 1f ) , indicating that no barbed - ends capping activity could be elicited , even under conditions in which IRSp53 and Eps8 form a stoichiometric complex . Next , we examined whether Eps8 regulates the F - actin bundling activ - ity of IRSp53 . The isolated IMD , but not full - length IRSp53 , efficiently crosslinked F - actin ( Fig . 2a ) . This was further confirmed by fluorescence - based in vitro assays , where staining of F - actin with rhodamine – phalloi - dine revealed the formation of actin - filament bundles ( Fig . 2b ) . Similar results were also obtained when the light scattering ( directly proportional to the amount of cross - linked actin ) of F - actin solutions was monitored in the absence or presence of IRSp53 or the IMD ( data not shown ) . All these assays indicated that IRSp53 crosslinking activity is self - inhibited , suggesting that binding to interacting proteins , such as Eps8 , may regulate this activity . This possibility was examined using fluores - cence - based and cosedimentation assays . Full - length IRSp53 was inac - tive , even at a molar ratio of actin : crosslinker of 1 : 5 ( Fig . 2a – c ) . The addition to IRSp53 of a region of Eps8 ( Eps8 201 – 250 ; Fig . 1f ) , which is unable to bind to and to bundle F - actin ( see below ) but associates with IRSp53 , did elicit the crosslinking activity of IRSp53 ( Fig . 2c ) . The more physiologically relevant full - length Eps8 was then tested . Intriguingly , Eps8 , in addition to association with the barbed ends of actin filaments , can also bind to their sides 31 , suggesting that Eps8 may also function as an actin crosslinker . Accordingly , the addition of full - length Eps8 alone to F - actin was sufficient to induce the formation of bundles , as determined by cosedimentation ( Fig . 2d ) , fluorescent ( Fig . 2e ) and light scattering assays ( Fig . 2f ) . Eps8 was already effective at an actin : Eps8 molar ratio of 1 : 0 . 5 . Thus , although the Eps8 full - length protein is auto - inhibited as a barbed - ends capper 31 , it is functional as a crosslinker . More importantly , the addition of Eps8 , at its minimal effective bundling con - centration ( 0 . 5 μ M ) , to IRSp53 led to 40 - fold stimulation in crosslink - ing activity with respect to Eps8 alone ( Fig . 2g – h ) . A similar synergic increase in crosslinking by the concomitant presence of Eps8 and IRSp53 could be detected by quantifying the amount of bundled actin in cosedimentation assays ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . This increase was twofold higher than that obtained by concomitant addition to IRSp53 of the minimal binding region of Eps8 ( Fig . 2g – h ) . Conversely , no synergy or activation was observed in the presence of print ncb1502 . indd 1339 print ncb1502 . indd 1339 15 / 11 / 06 16 : 32 : 05 15 / 11 / 06 16 : 32 : 05 Nature Publishing Group ©200 6 1340 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 8 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2006 A RT I C L E S ΔIMD – IRSp53 and Eps8 ( Fig . 2g – h ) , ruling out the possibility that bind - ing of IRSp53 to Eps8 induces the bundling activity of the latter . Thus , Eps8 is capable of activating and synergizing with IRSp53 to mediate the formation of actin bundles . Eps8 enhances IRSp53 - mediated membrane protrusive activity in vivo Filopodia extensions are supported by mechanical forces generated by the growth and bundling of actin filaments 17 .

In agreement with these observations , IRSp53 induces the formation of filopodia - like protrusions and dendritic – membrane extensions mainly through its IMD 20 . The asso - ciation of IRSp53 with interactors such as Mena , is thought to be important for regulation of this activity 19 , 35 . We observed that the ectopic expression of IRSp53 led to a significant increase in the number and length of actin - rich filopodia - like protrusions in Cos - 7 cells ( Fig . 3 and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) , and in a variety of other cell lines , including HeLa ( Fig . 4 ) and MEFs ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) . Conversely , the expression of Eps8 , which prominently localized at the leading edges of spontaneously formed lamellipodia - like protrusions and along micro - spikes ( considered precursors of filopodia ; Fig . 3a ) , had no effect on filo - podia - like extensions ( Fig . 3 and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . The concomitant expression of Eps8 and IRSp53 increased membrane protrusions , which adopted the shape of long and highly branched exten - sions , where Eps8 localized with a pattern similar to that observed in Cdc42 - induced filopodia ( Fig . 3 and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b ) . Representative examples are shown also as digitalized images to highlight the contour of cells ( Fig . 3b and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . Using this analysis , a protrusive index was determined by meas - uring the total length and the number of branches of these protrusions , indicating that cells expressing Eps8 and IRSp53 displayed a 2 . 4 - fold increase in length and 3 . 8 - fold increase in the number of branched exten - sion as compared with IRSp53 alone ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) . Enhanced elongation and branching were not observed in the presence of IMD and Eps8 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) and conversely , structure – function analysis using various fragments of Eps8 indicated that the binding of Eps8 to both IRSp53 and F - actin was required to cooperate with IRSp53 in mediating membrane protrusions ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) . Additionally , the presence of Abi1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3c ) and VASP ( data not shown ) at the tips of these structures 36 , 37 and the lack of tubulin along the shaft of the most peripheral branches of these extensions ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3c ) , together with real - time video microscopy ( data not shown ) , demonstrated that they represent bona fide filopodia . Taken together , these data indicate that the synergic activity of IRSp53 and Eps8 in mediating actin bundling in vitro may account for the in vivo observations .

IRSp53 caused the formation of filo - podia - like protrusions . However , these protrusions were significantly reduced in HeLa cells where Eps8 , but not members of the WAVE2 com - plex , Abi1 and WAVE2 , or N - WASP was knocked down ( Fig . 4a and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) , despite equal expression levels of IRSp53 in the various cell types ( Fig . 4b ) . Similar results were obtained using MEFs derived from either Eps8 or N - WASP knock - out mice and their corresponding control cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) . Notably , in HeLa cells treated with an RNAi specific for eps8 , re - expression of mouse eps8 cDNA , at levels similar to endogenous levels , rescued membrane - protrusions formation induced by IRSp53 expression ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) . Mena – Vasp family proteins have also been implicated in the formation of filopo - dia through a mechanism that remains debated 11 , 12 , 38 , 39 . Mena has been shown to bind to IRSp53 in a Cdc42 - dependent manner and promote extension of filopodia 19 . However , genetic knockouts of Mena and Vasp , but not Evl ( Ena – VASP - like protein ) 40 , had little or no effects on filopo - dial extensions .

S3d and ref . 41 ) . Interestingly , impairing the function of Mena – VASP family proteins further reduced the ability of IRSp53 to form filopodia ( Fig . 4c – d ) , suggesting that Eps8 and the Ena – VASP fam - ily are both implicated in this process . Taken together , these results pro - vide molecular genetic evidence for a model whereby an Eps8 – IRSp53 complex possessing enhanced actin - bundling activity is crucial for the formation of extended membrane protrusions . Cdc42 controls and requires the crosslinking activity of IRSp53 and Eps8 for the formation of filopodia We next addressed the regulation of the activity of the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex . IRSp53 and Eps8 have been reported to localize to leading edges and associate with F - actin . The concomitant expression of these two proteins enhances their activity in promoting membrane extensions , suggesting that they may become enriched at sites where membrane and actin dynamics are coupled . To explore this possibility , a fractionation protocol that separated actin - rich , membrane - associated fractions was used . The ectopic expression of IRSp53 caused the relocalization of Eps8 to the Triton X - 100 - insoluble fraction ( Fig . 5a ) , which correlated with a site - restricted redistribution of Eps8 in the presence of IRSp53 ( Fig . 3a ) . Notably , both the IRSp53 SH3 domain ( which binds Eps8 ) and the IMD ( which associates with F - actin ) were required to induce Eps8 redistri - bution ( Fig . 5b ) . Thus , one mechanism contributing to the increased protrusive activity of the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex is their restricted locali - zation to sites where their F - actin - bundling activity is most required . Next , we examined whether IRSp53 - mediated Eps8 relocalization was physiologically relevant and regulated by signalling - dependent mecha - nisms . IRSp53 can bind both activated Rac 25 , 27 , 42 and Cdc42 ( ref . 21 ) .

( a ) Control , IRSp53 ( Irsp53 KD ) , Eps8 ( Eps8 KD ) or double IRSp53 and Eps8 ( IRSp53 + Eps8 KD ) RNAi - treated HeLa cells were transfected with a constitutive active Myc - tagged Cdc42 ( Myc – Cdc42 QL ) . Cells were fixed and stained with anti - Myc or rhodamine – phalloidine to detect Cdc42 QL or F - actin , respectively . The scale bar represents 10 µm . The right panels represent digitalized tenfold magnifications of the indicated areas of each corresponding image to highlight the cell contour . ( b ) Quantification of filopodia induced by Cdc42 QL in the various knockdown cells shown in a . The number of the various knockdown cells expressing Cdc42 QL and presenting filopodia were counted . At least 100 cells in each experiment performed in triplicate were analysed . ( mean ± s . e . m . ) . Data are expressed as the fraction of Cdc42 QL - expressing cells presenting filopodia in the various knockdown and control cells with respect to Cdc42 QL - expressing control cells ( relative filopodia index ) . Cdc42 QL induced filopodia in about 73 % of transfected control cells . The expression levels of Eps8 , IRSp53 , Myc – Cdc42 QL and tubulin were analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies ( see text and Supplementary Information , Fig . S6 , 7 ) print ncb1502 . indd 1344 print ncb1502 . indd 1344 15 / 11 / 06 16 : 32 : 21 15 / 11 / 06 16 : 32 : 21 Nature Publishing Group ©200 6 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 8 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2006 1345 A RT I C L E S Binding of IRSp53 to GTP - loaded Cdc42 , but not Rac , was readily detected ( Fig . 5c ) . Importantly , Eps8 interacted with GTP - loaded Cdc42 in an IRSp53 - dependent manner , indicating that a Cdc42 – IRSp53 – Eps8 complex can be formed ( Fig . 5c ) . A corollary of this finding is that acti - vation of Cdc42 may direct the cellular distribution of Eps8 to Triton X - 100 - insoluble fractions in an IRSp53 - dependent manner . We found that activated Cdc42 caused a redistribution of Eps8 and IRSp53 from a Triton X - 100 - soluble to a Triton X - 100 - insoluble fraction ( Fig . 5d ) , and that RNAi - mediated ablation of IRSp53 abrogated Cdc42 - dependent redistribution of Eps8 ( Fig . 5d ) . Thus , Cdc42 regulates the cellular distri - bution of the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex , further indicating that this complex functions as a critical mediator of Cdc42 - dependent actin - based events . IRSp53 - mediated protrusions were , as previously reported , independ - ent of Cdc42 activity or expression ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . SI6a , b ) 43 , indicating that when IRSp53 is ectopically expressed , a properly localized complex with Eps8 can be formed that bypasss the need for Cdc42 activity . These results , together with the observation that in vivo Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia extensions , which also involve IRSp53 19 – 21 , 26 and Eps8 ( this study ) , predicts that the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex may participate with Cdc42 - dependent pathways to mediate the formation of these protrusions . Consistently , RNAi - based , individual removal of IRSp53 or Eps8 , albeit to a lesser extent , significantly reduced the ability of activated Cdc42 to form filopodia ( Fig . 6a , b ) . This effect was fully restored by re - expressing in IRSp53 – HeLa - KD cells — a mutant of IRSp53 resistant to RNAi treatments ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S7 ) . Additionally , the simultaneous ablation of IRSp53 and Eps8 was as effective as the individual removal of IRSp53 , providing genetic evidence that Eps8 and IRSp53 act in the same pathway ( Fig . 6 ) . Notably , Cdc42 neither directly activated IRSp53 nor synergized with Eps8 in inducing actin crosslinking in vitro ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S6c ) . Taken together , these results are consistent with a model whereby Cdc42 recruits an IRSp53 – Eps8 complex to sites along lead - ing edges , where the enhanced crosslinking activity of the complex contributes to the generation of actin bundles required to overcome membrane resilience and buckling forces , thus resulting in the formation of extended protrusions . DISCUSSION Here , we describe how the actin crosslinking activities of two distinct proteins , IRSp53 and Eps8 , which form a tight molecular complex , act in a coordinated fashion to crosslink actin filaments favouring the formation of extended and branched protrusions . Coordinated regulation of actin crosslinkers is essential to generate the diverse architectural complexity of the actin - filament network that is necessary to provide the mechani - cal elasticity that supports various cellular activities 6 . In Drosophila , two actin crosslinkers , fascin and forked , have complementary and synergic roles in producing propulsive forces for sensory bristles development 3 , 44 , 45 . Additionally , rheological studies in vitro , coupled with live - cell imaging , revealed that α - actinin and fascin cooperate to enhance the mechanical responses of actin arrays 4 , 46 . IRSp53 and Eps8 seem to function in a simi - lar fashion with some important and notable peculiarities . These proteins can act individually as crosslinkers as both possess intrinsic , yet differentially regulated , actin - bundling activities . More importantly , they can form a complex whose crosslinking output is syn - ergistically augmented by the ability of Eps8 to induce the otherwise auto - inhibited function of IRSp53 . This type of signalling arrangement is intriguingly reminiscent of a common circuit module , the feed - forward loop ( FFL ) 47 , which often recurs and governs the dynamic behaviour of transcriptional and signalling networks . FFLs are three - components modules composed of two factors X and Y ( Eps8 and IRSp53 , respec - tively ) , one of which X ( Eps8 ) regulates the other Y ( IRSp53 ) , but both jointly regulating a Z function , actin crosslinking . Here , we are dealing with a coherent FFL , where Eps8 has a positive effect on actin crosslink - ing both directly and indirectly , through IRSp53 . One feature of FFL circuitry is the generation of a threshold - type of response . This analogy facilitates prediction of their dynamics , based on the analysis of similar networks . Accordingly , one would expect that a transient stimulus may be sufficient to activate Eps8 , but may not last long enough to have both Eps8 and IRSp53 active . Only prolonged stimuli may close the AND gate , a ‘logic gate’ that gives positive output only if converging inputs are both postive ( active ) , leading to biologically relevant actin crosslink - ing . Therefore , such a loop is presumably able to filter out short , noisy signals , while reacting to long and sustained stimuli . Thus , a cell may respond by dramatically altering its shape only if extra - cellular cues are sufficiently prolonged and elevated to ’activate’ Eps8 , and consequently IRSp53 , increasing the ’strength’ of actin filaments through bundling . On the other hand , as soon as the stimulus is retracted , Eps8 will be inactivated first and later , as a consequence , IRSp53 . All these predictions are currently being tested . The other important property of the IRSp53 – Eps8 complex , with respect to more canonical crosslinkers , is that it is regulated by a GTPase and thus acts as bona fide effector of Cdc42 , which , by directly asso - ciating with IRSp53 , restricts the spatial distribution of the activated crosslinker complex to sites where its activity is required . Finally , Eps8 displays both barbed - ends capping and bundling activity . It is , therefore , intriguing to speculate that barbed - ends capping may not only control actin treadmilling rates , but also restrict Eps8 localization to leading edges of membrane protrusions , where the presence of IRSp53 may then turn the Eps8 – IRSp53 complex in efficient bundler crosslink - ing actin filaments near or in very close proximity to plus ends . This is thought to be the initial requirement to generate stiff rods of bundled filaments capable of overcoming membrane resistance 17 , ultimately favouring the formation of extended protrusions .

Cells were selected in puromycin 2 . 5 μg / ml and Eps8 knockdown ( KD ) clones were obtained by a serial dilutions protocol . Cells knocked down for IRSp53 were obtained by transiently transfecting the cells with a pSUPER - based vector carrying short hairpin loop oligos specific for human IRSp53 ( CAAGACACTGCCACGTTCA ) . The IRSp53 RNAi - resistant mutant bearing two silent mutations ( 471 CTCGGACAAGGA ( G→A ) CTGCA ( G→ A ) TACATCGACG 500 ) was generated by PCR . Protein purification . His – Eps8 FL was purified from human 293T cells . Briefly , 293T cells transfected with pCDNA – HisMax4 – Eps8 were lysed in 20 mM phos - phate buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 1 mM β - mercaptoeth - anol , 5 % glycerol , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) and sonicated . His – Eps8 was purified using Ni - NTA – agarose ( Qiagen , Venlo , The Netherlands ) following standard procedures . Recombinant Eps8 fragments were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain ( Stratagene , Cedar Creek , TX ) and affinity purified using GS4B glutathione – Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . Eluted proteins were dialysed in 50 mM Tris – HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 20 % glycerol .

Each single assay was repeated at least five times with similar results . Representative experiments are shown . Fluorescence microscopy of actin bundling . Monomeric G - actin was polymer - ized as described above . F - actin was mixed with varying concentrations of recom - binant and purified proteins ( as described in the text and in Fig . 2b , c , e and g ) in F - buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min . Actin was then labelled with rhodamine – phalloidine and 0 . 1 % DABCO and 0 . 1 % methylcellulose were added to the mixture . The samples were mounted between a slide and a coverslip coated with poly - lysine and imaged by fluorescence microscopy . Light scattering . Light scattering measurements were performed at an angle of 90° and at a wavelength of 370 nm in a Perkin Elmer ( LS55 ) fluorescence spec - trophotometer .

Briefly , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 2 % BSA for 10 min and then incubated with the primary antibody for 45 min , followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 30 min . F - actin was detected by staining with rodhamine – phalloidine ( Sigma ) at a concentration of 6 . 7 U ml – 1 . Generation of digitalized images was obtained by applying the Adobe Photoshop filter ’find edges’ to outline the cell contour . The average total length of protrusions per cell extending from the cell soma was calculated using ImageJ program in at least 30 different cells in triplicate experiments and expressed as fold increase with respect to the average total length of protrusions in control cells .

After 10 min on ice , cells lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation ( 145 , 000g , 45 min , 4 ˚C ) . Supernatants corresponded to the Triton X - 100 - soluble , cytosolic - enriched fractions ; pellets were solubilized in equal volume of RIPA buffer ( 15 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 140 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % NP - 40 , 2 % SDS , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ) , subjected to extensive sonication and centrifuged at 16 , 000 g for 20 min at 4 ˚C . Supernatants represented the Triton X - 100 - insoluble , membrane - and F - actin - enriched fractions . Equal amounts of each fraction were loaded resolved on SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies .

It is important to point out that to generate the full spectrum of actin protrusions in cells the concomitant expression of full length Eps8 and IRSp53 is needed ( + + + + ) , whereas the concomitant expression of IRSp53 and Eps8 fragments ( ( Eps8 1 - 535 ) , bearing the proline - rich region mediating this interaction , but unable to bind actin filaments 1 , had minimal effect on membrane extension ( + ) with respect to individual expression of IRSp53 ( + ) . Similarly , the concomitant expression of IRSp53 and Eps8 535 - 821 ( + + ) , and 648 - 821 ( + ) that retain actin binding 1 , but not bundling activity ( not shown ) , has marginal effects on IRSp53 - mediated protrusions . ppp © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N 6 WWW .
