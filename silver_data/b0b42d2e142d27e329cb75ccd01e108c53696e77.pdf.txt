Methods : We searched PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and CNKI ( Chinese Database ) for studies published as of March 2 , 2020 , and we searched references of identified articles . Studies were reviewed for methodological quality . A random - effects model was used to pool results . Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 . Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test . Results : 43 studies involving 3600 patients were included . Among COVID - 19 patients , fever ( 83 . 3 % [ 95 % CI 78 . 4 – 87 . 7 ] ) , cough ( 60 . 3 % [ 54 . 2 – 66 . 3 ] ) , and fatigue ( 38 . 0 % [ 29 . 8 – 46 . 5 ] ) were the most common clinical symptoms . The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C - reactive protein ( 68 . 6 % [ 58 . 2 – 78 . 2 ] ) , decreased lymphocyte count ( 57 . 4 % [ 44 . 8 – 69 . 5 ] ) and increased lactate dehydrogenase ( 51 . 6 % [ 31 . 4 – 71 . 6 ] ) . Ground - glass opacities ( 80 . 0 % [ 67 . 3 – 90 . 4 ] ) and bilateral pneumonia ( 73 . 2 % [ 63 . 4 – 82 . 1 ] ) were the most frequently reported findings on computed tomography . The overall estimated proportion of severe cases and case - fatality rate ( CFR ) was 25 . 6 % ( 17 . 4 – 34 . 9 ) and 3 . 6 % ( 1 . 1 – 7 . 2 ) , respectively . CFR and laboratory abnormalities were higher in severe cases , patients from Wuhan , and older patients , but CFR did not differ by gender . Conclusions : The majority of COVID - 19 cases are symptomatic with a moderate CFR . Patients living in Wuhan , older patients , and those with medical comorbidities tend to have more severe clinical symptoms and higher CFR . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; clinical characteristics ; meta - analysis ; systematic review 5 Introduction In December 2019 , a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause appeared in Wuhan , China . [ 1 ] The National Health Commission ( NHC ) of the People’s Republic of China later announced that a novel coronavirus , now named COVID - 19 by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , [ 2 ] was responsible for the outbreak . [ 3 ] High - throughput sequencing identified COVID - 19 as a betacoronavirus . This novel virus is genetically similar to bat coronaviruses , and shares about 79 % and 50 % of its genetic sequence with the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) , respectively . [ 4 ] Although epidemiological evidence suggests most of the initial patients were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan , the animal source of COVID - 19 has not yet been identified . [ 1 ] Human - to - human transmission is now responsible for most new infections , including those among family members and health care workers . [ 5 - 7 ] Pneumonia caused by 2019 - nCOV , known as COVID - 19 , is of huge global concern , with confirmed cases in 34 Chinese provinces and nearly 30 countries across five continents . The WHO’s International Health Regulations Emergency Committee declared this outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( PHEIC ) on 30 January 2020 . [ 2 ] As of 2 March 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID - 19 in China has reached 80302 and 2947 , respectively . Outside of China , a total of 10449 cases have been confirmed , including 170 deaths . [ 8 ] 6 Only one published systematic review and meta - analysis summarized clinical characteristics of COVID - 19 . [ 9 ] It reported a case - fatality rate ( CFR ) of 4 . 3 % and that fever , sore throat , and muscle soreness or fatigue were the most common symptoms . In that review the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography ( CT ) was 96 . 6 % . However , this article analysed results from only ten studies , including one Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) report that provides epidemiological data only , and four preprint articles ( one was already withdrawn ) that are not peer reviewed . [ 10 ] This article failed to report any clinical laboratory findings , treatments and geographical distribution of COVID - 19 which are essential to a thorough understanding of clinical characteristics . Many cases have emerged inside and outside Wuhan over the past month . [ 1 , 5 , 6 , 11 - 50 ] Recent publications suggest there may be significant differences between clinical outcomes for COVID - 19 between patients inside and outside Wuhan . Xu , et al . found that patients outside of Wuhan experienced milder illness and less pronounced laboratory abnormalities compared to counterparts inside Wuhan . [ 24 ] Although the number of COVID - 19 cases continues to grow worldwide , little attention has been paid to summarizing the clinical signs , risk factors , laboratory and chest CT findings , complications , and treatments of COVID - 19 . We performed a systematic review and meta - analysis to provide a comprehensive characterization of COVID - 19 to better inform efforts to treat and control the current outbreak . 7 Methods Search strategy and selection criteria Our systematic review and meta - analysis was undertaken according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines . [ 51 , 52 ] We searched four databases , PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science and CNKI ( Chinese Database ) , to identify studies reporting COVID - 19 . Articles published on or before March 2 , 2020 were eligible for inclusion . We used the following search terms : “coronavirus” or “nCoV” or “SARS - CoV - 2” or “COVID - 19” . References of all retrieved studies were screened for additional eligible publications . Primary studies were eligible if they reported any information on COVID - 19 patients in China without restriction on study type or study design . We excluded studies that focused on infection in infants , did not report original data or clear diagnostic criteria , and no reliable clinical data as well as research outside mainland China . Two independent reviewers ( LF and BW ) screened the literature search and assessed each study for inclusion . Any disagreement was solved by consulting a senior investigator ( HZ ) . Data analysis Four authors ( TY , XC , BW , and LF ) independently extracted relevant information , including first author , publication time , study designs , city , number of COVID - 19 patients , mean or median age of patients , maximum follow - up duration ( days ) , history of exposure in Wuhan , smoking history , 8 diagnostic criteria of COVID - 19 , presence of medical comorbidities , clinical symptoms , radiologic findings , laboratory findings , complications , supportive treatment , and clinical outcome of COVID - 19 patients . We also extracted the original author ' s guidelines for defining severe case and screened them according to Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment Of COVID - 19 ( Sixth Edition ) from the NHC . [ 8 ] We classified patients admitted to intensive care units ( ICU ) as severe cases when authors did not report diagnostic criteria for disease severity . Studies that only reported data for critically ill patients were excluded in the overall meta - analysis but were included in the meta - analysis restricted to severe cases . We used the quality assessment tool for case series studies published by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) to assess the methodological quality of included studies . [ 53 ] We scored 0 or 1 point for each item according to the criteria and added scores for all items to generate an overall quality score that ranged from 0 to 9 . Based on the overall score , we classified studies as low ( ≥7 ) , moderate ( 5 - 6 ) , or high risk of bias ( ≤4 ) . Any disagreement was resolved through discussion by all investigators . We performed data analyses using meta packages in R ( version 3 . 6 . 0 ) . Random - effects meta - analysis was used to calculate pooled estimated prevalence with 95 % confidence intervals of clinical symptoms , laboratory findings , chest CT findings , complications , treatment , and fatality of COVID - 19 patients . [ 54 ] To minimize the impact of studies with extremely small or extremely large prevalence estimates on overall estimates , Freeman - Tukey 9 double arcsine transformation was used to stabilize the variance of specific prevalence rates before using random - effects meta - analysis models to pool data . [ 54 ] We assessed heterogeneity between studies using I 2 , with values of 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % representing low , moderate , and high heterogeneity , respectively . [ 55 ] If substantial heterogeneity ( I 2 > 75 % ) was detected , we further explored the possible source of heterogeneity through subgroup analysis and used the following grouping variables : age , sex , region , and underlying medical comorbidities . We also performed subgroup analyses to explore whether the prevalence of outcomes differed by these subgroups . If a meta - analysis included more than three studies , publication bias was assessed by Egger’s test . [ 56 ] Results Our search produced 2247 publications . Of these , 1648 were unique records , from which 1434 records were excluded after screening their titles and abstracts ( figure 1 ) . We assessed the eligibility of 214 full - text papers , of which 99 did not report original data , 47 did not report clinical features of COVID - 19 ( e . g . , epidemiological characteristics , mathematical models , virus structure ) , six did not include clear diagnostic criteria , 17 had a sample size smaller than four , two were conducted outside mainland China , and one focused on patients aged less than one year . After excluding these studies , 43 eligible studies with 3600 patients were included . Among included studies , one study only reported data on critically ill patients and was excluded from the overall meta - analysis but was included in the meta - analysis restricted to 10 patients with severe illness . [ 1 , 5 , 6 , 11 - 50 ] Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included studies . Included studies were published between 24 January 2020 and 28 February 2020 , among which 25 ( 58 . 1 % ) were in Chinese and the remaining was in English . The earliest enrollment time was 16 December 2019 and the latest was 27 January 2020 . One publication was a letter , and the remainder were journal articles . Most included studies were retrospective case series ( 40 [ 90 . 3 % ] ) , 27 ( 62 . 8 % ) were from cities outside Wuhan , and 34 ( 79 . 0 % ) only included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID - 19 . The number of patients enrolled in each study ranged from 4 to 1099 . Mean or median age of patients varied from 39 to 72 years ( median 41 years ; 43 studies ) . The proportion of male patients ranged from 29 . 0 % to 77 . 0 % ( median 56 . 5 % ; 42 studies ) . The proportion of patients who had ever traveled to or were resident of Hubei Province varied from 28 . 5 % to 100 . 0 % ( median 91 . 0 % ; 36 studies ) . The number of family - clusters ranged from 1 to 5 ( 10 studies ) . The proportion of patients who were current smokers ranged from 0 . 0 % to 18 . 0 % ( median 7 . 2 % ; 9 studies ) , and health workers ranged from 0 . 0 % to 29 . 0 % ( median 4 . 0 % ; 5 studies ) . The proportion of patients with hypertension ranged from 0 . 0 % to 48 . 0 % ( median 16 . 0 % ; 27 studies ) , diabetes ranged from 0 . 0 % to 50 . 0 % ( median 10 . 1 % ; 26 studies ) , cancer ranged from 0 . 0 % to 17 . 0 % ( median 1 . 0 % ; 15 studies ) , chronic respiratory / lung diseases ranged from 0 . 0 % to 17 . 0 % ( median 2 . 0 % ; 16 studies ) , having any coexisting medical comorbidity ranged from 12 . 0 % to 67 . 0 % . The proportion of patients diagnosed with severe COVID - 19 varied from 0 . 0 % to 100 . 0 % ( median 26 . 5 % ; 21 studies ) , and the most commonly 11 used diagnostic criteria was The Guidelines on 2019 - nCoV Treatment and Prevention issued by the NHC ( 70 . 6 ) ( 17 studies ) . 9 ( 20 . 9 % ) of 43 studies were rated as low risk of bias , 30 studies ( 69 . 8 % ) as moderate , and all remaining studies rated as high risk of bias ( supplementary Table1 ) . We meta - analysed the prevalence of 16 clinical symptoms among COVID - 19 patients ( figure 2 ) . Fever ( 83 . 3 % [ 95 % CI 78 . 4 – 87 . 7 ] ) , cough ( 60 . 3 % [ 54 . 2 – 66 . 3 ] ) , and fatigue ( 38 . 0 % [ 29 . 8 – 46 . 5 ] ) were the most common , followed by increased sputum production , shortness of breath , and myalgia , with estimated prevalence just under 30 % for each , respectively . Eleven studies reported the proportion of COVID - 19 patients who did not exhibit obvious symptoms , and the pooled estimated prevalence was 5 . 6 % ( 1 . 4 - 11 . 6 ) . Among 16 commonly reported laboratory findings ( figure 3 ) , the most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C - reactive protein ( 68 . 6 % [ 58 . 2 – 78 . 2 ] ) and decreased lymphocyte count ( 57 . 4 % [ 44 . 8 – 69 . 5 ] ) , as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase ( 51 . 6 % [ 31 . 4 – 71 . 6 ] ) . Ground - glass opacities ( 80 . 0 % [ 67 . 3 – 90 . 4 ] ) and bilateral pneumonia ( 73 . 2 % [ 63 . 4 – 82 . 1 ] ) and were the most frequent chest CT findings ( figure 3 ) . The vast majority of patients received antiviral therapy ( 90 . 0 % 74 . 1 – 99 . 0 ] ) , antibiotic treatment ( 71 . 5 % [ 50 . 0 – 89 . 7 ] ) , and oxygen therapy ( 71·5 % [ 28·0 – 99·7 ] ) . Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) was the most common complication ( 15 . 7 % [ 5 . 0 – 30 . 4 ] ) . The overall estimated prevalence of severe case and death was 25 . 6 % ( 17 . 4 – 34 . 9 ) and 3 . 6 % ( 1 . 1 – 7 . 2 ) , respectively ( figure 4 ) . In subgroup analysis ( supplementary table2 - 5 ) , studies from Wuhan had 12 significantly higher prevalence of death , fever , fatigue , headache , elevated leukocyte count , and elevated lactate dehydrogenase , and elevated aspartate aminotransferase compared to patients from other cities ( all p < 0 . 05 ) . Similarly , the prevalence of death , ARDS , headache , increased leukocyte count , and increased lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of older patients was larger ( all p < 0 . 05 ) , and the prevalence of diarrhea , and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of patients with any coexisting medical condition was larger ( all p < 0 . 05 ) . The prevalence of fatigue , myalgia , decreased leucocyte count were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of male patients was smaller , whereas the reverse was true for the prevalence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase ( all p < 0 . 05 ) , though fatality did not differ by gender . A total of eight studies reported separate results for severe cases and non - severe cases . Overall , the existence of clinical symptoms , abnormalities in laboratory and chest CT findings , and complications were higher among patients with severe illness compared to patients without severe illness ( table2 ) , however these differences were not statistically significant due to limited sample size and statistical power ( data not shown ) . Publication bias was found in the following subgroup outcomes : fever , myalgia , diarrhea , rhinorrhea , hemoptysis , decreased leucocytes , lymphopenia , increased creatine , creatine kinase , and procalcitonin , bilateral pneumonia , solid nodules , antiviral therapy , and immunoglobulin therapy 13 ( figure 2 - 4 , all p < 0 . 005 by Egger test ) . Substantial heterogeneity was present within most subgroups ( table 2 and figure 2 - 4 ) . Discussion Our systematic review and meta - analysis of 43 studies involving 3600 patients provides the most comprehensive overview of clinical features , laboratory findings , chest imaging findings , disease severity , and CFR of COVID - 19 patients . Compared with the only previous published systematic review on the subject , we included 31 additional studies performed detailed subgroup analyses . Particularly our results suggest CFR and proportion of severe cases are both declining as 2019 - nCOV spreads away from Wuhan . The dominant clinical features of COVID - 19 were fever , cough , and fatigue , while congestion , rhinorrhea , sore throat and diarrhea are rare . [ 13 , 16 , 19 , 24 ] The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities were reduced lymphocyte count , elevated C - reactive protein , and elevated lactate dehydrogenase , all of which are generally consistent with previous reports of patients with COVID - 19 . [ 11 , 19 , 24 ] However , all these laboratory markers are very non - specific , making their clinical utility limited . When evaluating suspected cases , physicians cannot rely on these laboratory abnormalities to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of COVID - 19 . These abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with SARS and MERS . [ 57 - 59 ] Previous research suggests these abnormalities may be related to the cytokine storm brought on by infection . [ 22 ] Recently , a study suggested that COVID - 19 may primarily affect T lymphocytes , especially CD4 + T cells , resulting in significant lymphopenia as well as decreased IFN - γ 14 production . [ 60 ] Additionally , by using a multiple linear regression model , a study showed that CD4 + T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools ( p = 0·010 ) . [ 61 ] However , the number of cases currently reported is too small to draw firm conclusions , and further studies are required . The most frequently reported finding on CT imaging was ground - glass opacities , particularly bilateral opacities impacting three or more lobes . These results are also consistent with previous studies , [ 21 ] and are also frequently identified in MERS and SARS . [ 57 - 59 ] In this systematic review and meta - analysis , we found a CFR of 3 . 6 % , which is closer to the estimate ( 2 . 3 % ) in a report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) that includes the epidemiological characteristics of 44672 confirmed COVID - 19 patients in mainland China ( updated through February11 , 2020 ) . [ 10 ] CFR may have been higher in earlier reports because of belated treatment during the earlier stages of the outbreak or a decline in fatality after sustained human - to - human transmission . [ 1 , 14 , 19 ] Of note , roughly half of the studies included in our analysis were from outside Wuhan , the epicenter of the current outbreak , and our subgroup analysis found significantly lower prevalence of death among patients treated outside Wuhan . This may indicate fatality from COVID - 19 is declining . In our analysis , the proportion of severe cases ( 25 . 6 % ) was close to the estimate in the China CDC report ( 18 . 5 % ) . [ 10 ] This is consistent with previous studies that patients from Wuhan had significantly higher prevalence of death , fever , elevated leucocyte count , and elevated aspartate aminotransferase 15 compared with patients from other cities in China ( all p < 0 . 05 ) . [ 1 , 14 , 19 ] Additionally , the China CDC report supports our finding that the overall CFR in Hubei ( 2 . 9 % ) is higher than that outside Hubei ( 0 . 4 % ) . [ 10 ] This interpretation could be supported by a study that showed lower fatality in patients who did not have direct contact with the site of the original disease . [ 62 ] Similarly , the CFR , proportion of severe cases , ARDS , headache , increased leukocyte count , and increased lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of older patients was larger ( all p < 0 . 05 ) , which is consistent with previous publications . [ 62 ] This finding suggests COVID - 19 may disproportionately impact the elderly or people living with medical comorbidities . This is consistent with a single - center retrospective study found that older patients ( > 65 years ) with comorbidities and ARDS were at increased risk of death . [ 45 ] A multivariate Cox regression analysis results showed age and severe cases were identified as independent prognostic factors for virus clearance . [ 62 ] Furthermore , a study showed that children might be less likely to become infected or , if infected , may show milder symptoms . [ 16 ] Another study also confirmed that the elderly and those with comorbidities including diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , liver diseases , malignancy were more likely to develop critical illness ( 62 . 1 % ： 25 . 0 % ， p < 0 . 001 ) . [ 62 ] Our study did not find significant differences between men and women in terms of CFR and proportion of severe cases . This finding is similar to a previous study in which there was no difference in the proportion of men and women admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) for treatment of COVID - 19 . 16 [ 6 ] However , this differs from another study which found that men are more susceptible to COVID - 19 than women , [ 63 ] as well as a recent publication reporting that seven of nine infant patients were female . [ 64 ] There is no clear explanation as to why men and women would be at different risk of infection , however some have proposed genetic mechanisms or sex - specific effects . [ 65 ] Whether there are differences in risk of infection between men and women requires further research . We found the prognosis was worse among severe cases compared to non - severe cases , however these differences were not statistically significant , which is likely due to insufficient sample size . In our research , there was no significant difference in the degree of lymphocyte decline between severe cases and non - severe cases . This conclusion can be supported by this research that the expression level of lymphocyte counts has no significant correlation with the severity of the disease . [ 22 ] However , some studies showed that lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of severe cases . [ 45 ] At present , it is unclear whether lymphocyte count is related to severity of disease . Further investigation is needed to establish whether lymphocytosis or lymphopenia can help predict mortality in COVID - 19 patients . [ 62 ] We found many patients were treated with antiviral and antibiotic therapy . Currently there is no treatment that can cure COVID - 19 . Supportive measures may reduce complications and fatality . [ 14 ] The impact of antivirals and antibiotics on patients ' prognosis remains unknown and requires further clinical evaluation . Currently , clinical trials of lopinavir / ritonavir ( LPV / r ) and 17 remdesivir registered in the Chinese clinical trial registry are ongoing . The recently published systematic review and meta - analysis on the clinical characteristics of 50466 patients may reflect a combination of fallacies . [ 9 ] Authors misuse fundamental terms . They mistake incidence for prevalence and odds ratio for proportion . They demonstrate the proportion of severe cases is 88 % and case fatality rate is 42 % in figures , which are misleading . PRISMA guidelines and test for heterogeneity were not mentioned . Authors state in Methods that “Only available data from published articles were collected . Data from unpublished papers were not included . ” However 4 out of 10 references were from Medrxiv , a platform that publishes non - peer reviewed reports . These reports , as it clearly states on Medrxiv’s website , should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health - related behavior and should not be reported as established information . One reference providing 4021 cases was already withdrawn from publication . [ 66 ] It is inappropriate to include the China CDC report providing epidemiological characteristics of 44672 cases of COVID - 19 ( as of February 11 , 2020 ) in a meta - analysis of its clinical characteristics . [ 10 ] This report , based on national surveillance data , provides epidemiological data only , including spatiotemporal distribution . Albeit this report includes a large sample , data on clinical symptoms that are not systematically reported , may not be reliable . For example , 53 % did not report if they have co - morbidity or not . 9 out 10 studies included in the meta - analysis were published / submitted before February 11 , 2020 so cases in these 9 studies must have already been included in the China CDC report . It is inappropriate to count an individual 18 twice . After excluding the China CDC report and the four preprint articles , only 369 patients would be reportable in that review . Authors did not list specific imaging performance in abnormal imaging , nor did they list pulmonary fibrosis and its incidence . However in Discussion they use two lengthy paragraphs to explain the content of pulmonary fibrosis , which may cause readers to mistakenly believe that the imaging abnormality is pulmonary fibrosis . Author failed to report any clinical laboratory findings and treatments of COVID - 19 which are essential to a thorough understanding of clinical characteristics . They also failed to report the diagnostic criteria for abnormal chest CT detection and severe cases . Our systematic review and meta - analysis has limitations . First , we found substantial heterogeneity between studies and significant publication bias among several subgroups . Second , this study performs an analysis during an ongoing outbreak . Many regions affected by COVID - 19 haven not yet published clinical datasets , which may skew the results of this analysis . All these datasets are retrospective , which prevents us from exploring risk factors . Additionally , our meta - analysis focused on Chinese people , not those infected in other countries , so geographical and ethnic differences were not excluded . Finally , the meta - analysis was performed by comparing entire datasets against one another , therefore there was no way to analyse data on the level of individual patients . Conclusion This review provides a comprehensive characterization of clinical features among COVID - 19 patients . Patients living in Wuhan , older patients , and those 19 with medical comorbidities tend to have more severe clinical symptoms and higher fatality . Better therapeutics are crucial for the treatment of severe cases . Our comprehensive characterization of COVID - 19 will inform healthcare providers and public health policy makers in their efforts to treat and control the current outbreak .
