The WAVE regulatory complex is inhibited Ayman M Ismail , Shae B Padrick , Baoyu Chen , Junko Umetani & Michael K Rosen The WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) transmits information from the Rac GTPase to the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 complex . We have reconstituted recombinant human and Drosophila WRC in several forms and shown that they are inactive toward Arp2 / 3 complex but can be activated by Rac in a nucleotide - dependent fashion . Our observations identify core components needed for WAVE inhibition , reconcile contradictory existing mechanisms and reveal common regulatory principles for the WAVE / WASP family of proteins . Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family have a central role in the transmission of extracellular signals to the actin cytoskeleton 1 . These proteins use their VCA domain to stimulate the actin - nucleating activity of Arp2 / 3 complex in response to upstream signals from the Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac . The WAVE subgroup of the WASP family participates in numerous processes , including cell polarization and motility , T cell activa - tion and neuronal guidance 2 – 4 . Aberrant WAVE signaling is important in tumor pro - gression and metastasis 5 . In the cell , WAVE proteins are incorporated into a conserved , heteropentameric complex , referred to here as the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , containing WAVE , Sra1 , Nap1 , Abi and HSPC300 ( refs . 3 , 4 , 6 ) . Sra1 binds to Rac , functionally linking the GTPase to Arp2 / 3 complex 4 , 6 . Although the existence and importance of the WRC have been widely demonstrated 4 , 6 , its regulatory function is poorly understood . Based on puriﬁcation of the WRC from bovine brain , it was initially proposed that WAVE is inactive within the complex and that Rac binding activates it toward Arp2 / 3 complex , concomitant with the dissociation of Nap1 and Sra1 ( ref . 3 ) . Proof that a puriﬁed biochemical activity is attributed to the correct factors requires reconstitution . However , a subsequent recon - stitution 7 led to a very different model , in which WAVE is fully active within the WRC and Rac binding produces neither further stimula - tion toward Arp2 / 3 complex nor dissociation of the assembly , con - sistent with observations in cells 8 , 9 . Resolution of these two contradictory models is necessary to understand WAVE regulation and response to upstream signals . One explanation could be that there is an unidentiﬁed inhibitory factor in the initial puriﬁcation . To examine this possibility , we reconstituted a highly homogeneous , recombinant human WRC in 500 nM VCA 200 nM VCA 100 nM VCA 100 nM WRC 200 nM WRC 500 nM WRC Control d Sra1 Nap1 Abi2 WAVE1 VC A SH3 HSPC300 PRD PRD WRC Time ( s ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 F l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0 . 03 0 . 01 – 0 . 01 – 0 . 03 6 . 9 7 7 . 1 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 O D 280 ∆ O D 280 Mass from fit = 396 kDa WRC theoretical mass = 397 kDa for 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry Radius ( cm ) 9 , 000 rpm 10 , 500 rpm c 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 O D 280 ( × 10 – 3 ) Volume ( ml ) WRC peak b Fractions pooled Sra1Nap1WAVE1Abi2 HSPC300 250 37 50 75100150 2520 15 Abi2 1 – 158 WAVE1 1 – 208 - ( GGS ) 3 WAVE1 ∆ PRD - PreS ( GGS ) 3 - VCA ( kDa ) M o l . w t . m a r k e r W R C M i n i W R C - P r e S M i n i W R C - P r e S c u t w i t h P r e S c i ss i on p r o t ea s e Red box contrast enhanced a Figure 1 WRC is inhibited .

Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9 ) insect cells ( Figs . 1a , b and Supplementary Table 1 online ) . Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the WRC contains one molecule of each subunit ( Fig . 1c ) . WAVE1 VCA concentrations of 100 – 500 nM produced substantial activation of Arp2 / 3 complex in actin assembly assays , indicated by rapid ﬁlament assembly and a shorter initial lag time . The same concentrations of WRC produced virtually no activation ( Fig . 1d ) . Thus , WAVE is inhibited within the recombinant , ﬁve - component WRC , ruling out the need for an additional inhibitory factor . The VCA is at the immediate C terminus of all WASP proteins . Loss of even a few C - terminal residues substantially reduces VCA activity ( data not shown ) . To determine whether the inactivity of our WRC preparations was due to bona ﬁde inhibition or artifactual C - terminal proteolysis , we engineered a WRC in which the WAVE1 proline - rich region was replaced with a PreScission protease cleavage site ( WRC - PreS ) . WRC - PreS was also inactive toward Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2a ) . Treatment of this material with PreScission protease ( GE Life Sciences ) released the VCA from the other WRC components ( Supplementary Fig . 1a online ) , allowing it to activate Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2a ) . We also created a WRC - PreS lacking the C - terminal proline - rich region and SH3 domain of Abi2 ( MiniWRC - PreS ) . MiniWRC - PreS could be generated by coexpression of all ﬁve components in Sf9 insect cells ( Fig . 1a ) . Alternatively , it was assembled from an Sra1 – Nap1 heterodimer produced in Sf9 insect cells and a bacterially expressed WAVE – Abi – HSPC300 heterotrimer . Both versions of MiniWRC - PreS were inhibited and could be activated by PreScission cleavage , similar to WRC - PreS ( Figs . 2b , c and Supplementary Figs . 1b , c ) . Thus , the inactivity of WRC - PreS , and by extension wild - type WRC , is due to genuine inhibition and not to inactivating modiﬁcations of the VCA . These data imply that the intermolecular afﬁnity of the VCA for the remaining components of the pentamer is low , consistent with our observations of only weak VCA inhibition by various WRC subcom - plexes in trans ( data not shown ) . Additionally , the proline - rich region of WAVE and the C terminus of Abi are not necessary for inhibition . Finally , our two methods of generating MiniWRC - PreS demonstrate that inhibition within the WRC does not result from kinetic trapping produced during in vivo folding , but originates from the basic thermodynamics of the assembly . To establish generality of this model , we also attempted to express the Drosophila melanogaster WRC ( dWRC ) in insect cells . Full - length dWAVE could not be expressed in these cells . But when we replaced the proline - rich region with a ( GGS ) 6 linker , expression increased substantially , enabling us to reconstitute dWRC . Like human WRC , dWRC was inactive toward Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2d and Supple - mentary Fig . 2a online ) . A dWRC - PreS was also inactive and could be activated by PreScission protease cleavage ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Therefore , several forms of the human and Drosophila WRC are inactive toward Arp2 / 3 complex . Rac1 binds to Sra1 ( ref . 4 , 6 ) , but it is not clear how this interaction affects the activity or integrity of the WRC . We found that in actin assembly assays , Rac1 loaded with the GTP analog GMPPNP ( Rac1 - GMPPNP ) activated the WRC , whereas Rac1 - GDP did not ( Fig . 2e ) . We estimate that the barbed ends concentrations here are over tenfold greater than previously reported for activated WRC 3 , 8 . The dose dependence of activation suggests that Rac1 has micromolar afﬁnity for WRC . Immobilized glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - Rac1 - GMPPNP bound an Sra1 – Nap1 heterodimer and all ﬁve components of a minimized WRC ( MiniWRC D VCA , Supplementary Table 1 ) , whereas GST - Rac1 - GDP did not bind any component ( Fig . 2f ) . Thus , Rac1 can activate WRC in a nucleotide - dependent fashion without dissociating the complex . Our reconstitutions suggest that the source of the differences between previous models for WRC activity is not an unidentiﬁed factor in the WRC puriﬁed from natural sources but absent in the recombinant materials . Rather , the discrepancies appear to stem from differences in reconstituting and handling the assembly , and from the recently recognized fact that oligomerization of WASP proteins g Sra1 Nap1 Abi2 W AVE1 V C A SH3 HSPC300 Inactive Sra1 Nap1 Abi2 WAVE1 VCA SH3 * * HSPC300 Rac1 Active V C A Inactive GBD VCA Active GBD WRC WASP C d c 42 Rac - GDP Rac - GMPPNP Sra1 : NAP1 MBP - WAVE1 1 – 178 MBP - Abi2 1 – 158 MBP - HSPC300 + + + + + + M o l . w e i gh t m a r k e r Sra1NAP1 MBP - WAVE1 1 – 178 MBP - Abi2 1 – 158 MBP - HSPC300 GST - Rac1 250 150 100 75 50 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 0 . 0 B a r bed end s ( n M ) ( kDa ) f e 0 0 100 WRC conc .

In the report of active reconstituted WRC 7 , the complex was generated by mixing a Pir121 – Nap1 subcomplex ( Pir121 is a close homolog of Sra1 ) with a GST - WAVE2 – Abi1 subcomplex on glu - tathione - Sepharose ( and optionally adding HSPC300 ) , incubating and washing away unbound materials before elution . This method would reject unbound Pir121 – Nap1 subcomplex but retain uncom - plexed GST - WAVE2 – Abi1 material . We have found that various WAVE - containing subcomplexes of the pentamer have very high activity that increases over time as a result of aggregation . Indeed , we obtained stable , reproducible activity of our WRC preparations only when such subcomplexes were rigorously removed during puriﬁcation ( see Supplementary Methods online ) . These biochemical properties , plus the constitutive dimerization of GST , suggest that the high activity reported for the previous reconstitution of WRC resulted from contamination of WRC with aggregated , hyperactive subcom - plexes . This high basal activity , coupled with the relatively low afﬁnity of Rac for the WRC , could also explain the reported inability of the GTPase to stimulate activity further . A second protocol leading to active WRC involved a freeze - thaw cycle 8 , which activates the complex unless performed in the presence of 4 15 % glycerol ( Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) . We cannot currently explain the reported WRC dissociation upon Rac activation 3 , but we note that Rac may bind subcomplexes lacking WAVE with higher afﬁnity than intact WRC , as there would be less resistance to allosteric change in the former . There are strong mechanistic parallels between the regulation of WASP and WAVE ( Fig . 2g ) . In WASP , the VCA is inhibited by intramolecular contacts to the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) 1 . WASP is activated by Cdc42 binding to the GBD , causing release of the VCA ( which remains tethered to the GBD ) . In the WRC , the VCA is inhibited by an intracomplex interaction , perhaps to Sra1 and / or Nap1 , as the pentamer is inactive but the WAVE1 – Abi2 – HSPC300 trimer is active 10 . The WRC is activated by Rac1 binding to Sra1 , which may release the VCA but does not cause dissociation of the complex . Thus , WASP and WAVE proteins are regulated by the same principles , achieved through different molecular details . It remains to be seen whether other WASP family members , such as WHAMM , WASH and Bee1 , are regulated by analogous or distinct mechanisms . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank D . Jia ( Univ .
