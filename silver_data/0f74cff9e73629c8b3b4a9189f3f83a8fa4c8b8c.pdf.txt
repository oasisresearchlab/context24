In this paper , we explore fun as a user gain since the benefits that children gain from PD are relatively unexplored . We reflect on ‘Making Things ! ’ , a case study involving children in the design of FabLab workshops for the future . Our findings show that the child - participants gain from the process through fun in overcoming challenges , working towards finalised objects , experimenting , and interacting with others . Based on our findings , we posit that fun can be a direct gain of children participating in PD , but also relates to additional user gains ( e . g . developing self - esteem ) . Furthermore , we hypothesise that opening up the assessment of children’s user gains would fit the notion of the child as process designer . These findings extend the debate on benefits children can gain through PD and highlight the importance of fun as a user gain . Author Keywords Participatory Design ; user gains ; children ; fun .

INTRODUCTION Participants are at the heart of Participatory Design ( PD ) . In short , PD is a set of theories and practices related to the concept of involving end - users in the design process [ 1 , 2 ] . Despite different strands in PD , the core characteristic has always been to enable users to participate in design processes , enhance their skills , improve their quality of life at work or during leisure and give them a voice in decision - making [ 3 , 4 ] . However , in many cases participants do not see any tangible outcomes of the process , and outreach may only be interesting to the academic community instead of the participants [ 5 ] . In previous studies ( e . g . [ 3 , 4 , 6 ] ) , it has been suggested that participants can and should benefit through PD . This paper contributes to this discussion by exploring children’s user gains in PD processes . Since the 1990s , an increasing amount of attention has been paid to children as participants in design processes [ 7 ] and the methods adequate to achieve this ( e . g . [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] ) . However , current research on involving children in PD processes is often criticised for being ‘fast and furious’ or ‘reduced PD’ : child - participants are only engaged in isolated , short - termed design sessions while being left out of the decision - making process [ 11 ] . Read et al [ 12 ] critically refer to this trend as the ‘crowdsourcing of ideas’ . Instead of being merely tokenistic , decorative or even manipulative , genuine forms of children’s participation should generate knowledge of the children , enable their voices to be heard , impact decision - making and empower children [ 5 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] . This view corresponds to the early Scandinavian PD tradition , in which the motivations are mainly political ( i . e . democratizing the workplace ) . Central is the idea that the objective of design is not only technological products , but also for participants to develop new insights , design abilities , and a critical stance towards technology through their engagement in design work ) [ 13 ] . To pursue more genuine forms of participation that fit the democratising values of this PD tradition , Schepers , Dreessen & Zaman [ 16 ] have argued for extending the range of children’s roles that has been identified so far - including Druin’s [ 10 ] seminal classification - with an additional role , being ‘the child as process designer’ . This role precedes the actual involvement of the child in the PD process and entails the collaboration with children to design a PD process . In this way , the children do not merely participate in the process but are also involved in designing , negotiating and deciding on the methods being used . We hypothesise that allowing children to ( co - ) define a PD process and its methods may result in more opportunities to experience user gains . Yet children’s user gains appear to remain underexplored . However , explicitly addressing what child - participants gain from a process is crucial for PD and its ambitions of caring for participants [ 3 , 4 , 17 ] .

Fun can be described as a range of subjective experiences that are playful and liberating [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] . In PD processes , it can keep the child - participants engaged and provide them with internal motivation to participate , making it rewarding for its own sake rather than for an external reward [ 21 , 22 ] . Fun has always been a central concept in the field of Interaction Design and Children ( IDC ) ( see e . g . [ 23 , 24 , 25 ] ) . And although IDC researchers often ensure they include a range of activities that are potentially fun for their child - participants , it is generally considered as self - evidently and not made explicit . Exploring fun as a user gain in PD processes involving children , previous IDC literature ( e . g . [ 23 , 24 , 25 ] ) has mainly focused on the role of fun serving learning , play and / or usability goals . Read et al [ 23 ] , for instance , have measured fun using the ' Fun Toolkit ' with 5 - 10 year olds to discuss the relationship of fun to usability . Fun as a user gain , however , is hardly touched upon . In this paper , we first conceptualize user gains and discuss fun ( as a user gain ) . Next , we report on the results of ‘Making Things ! ’ : a PD process to design FabLab workshops for the future together with children of 6 - 12 years old . The case analysis shows that fun can be a direct user gain , but can also relate to additional gains ( e . g . developing a sense of self - esteem , being proud of their own skills and persistence and daring to step out of the comfort zone more easily ) . Moreover , we believe it is worthwhile to reflect upon how opening up the assessment of children’s user gains would fit the notion of the child as process designer [ 16 ] . These findings extend the further debate on the different benefits that children experience through their involvement in PD processes , highlight the importance of fun as a user gain and form a first exploration of user gains in relation to the child as process designer . 2 . CHILDREN’S USER GAINS Literature has shown that the personal benefits that participants can gain from PD are relatively unexplored . This is particularly the case when it comes to children’s user gains in PD processes . PD researchers who have explored the topic of adult user gains - mainly through analysing case studies - include Bossen et al [ 4 ] and Garde & Van Der Voort [ 6 ] . For instance , Bossen et al [ 3 ] evaluated the ‘iSchool’ project and identified user gains on several levels . On a personal level , participants could gain new career and educational opportunities or acquire new competencies . At a collective level , participants were offered a venue for reflecting on their professional practices , and increased their competence in working within interdisciplinary groups . In contrast , children are seldom asked what they have gained from participating in PD processes . Benton et al [ 26 ] , Barendregt et al [ 17 ] , and Garzotto [ 27 ] include three of the few contributions to this field . The former [ 26 ] researched the involvement of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) in the technology design process , and pinpointed , among other things , learning better teamwork skills as benefit for the children . Barendregt et al [ 17 ] proposed that explicitly integrating learning opportunities in PD activities could be a way to provide clear benefits to participating children and schools . Finally , through studying children’s participation in the co - design process of an online tool for cooperative hyperstorytelling , Garzotto [ 27 ] derived several educational benefits for the children involved , such as developing critical thinking capabilities . Although children’s user gains appear to remain underexplored , explicitly addressing what child - participants gain from a PD process is crucial for PD and its ambitions of caring for participants [ 3 , 4 , 17 ] . 3 . FUN AS USER GAIN Accounting for fun as a potential gain for child - participants in a PD process allows the designer to “ create something that increases or enhances a users’ cognitive abilities , enabling them to become a better creative thinker , a better problem solver , increase retention and spend more time engaged in the experience ” [ 18 , p . 26 ] . Fun can have powerful positive influences on memory and can aid to learning ( more ) effectively [ 18 , 25 , 28 ] . Dodero , Gennari , Melonio & Torello [ 29 ] state that co - design tasks should not only be engaging but also fun for children to partake in . Many PD methods designed for children - such as Mission from Mars [ 30 ] , KidReporter [ 31 ] , and Character Design [ 32 ] - depart from an emphasis on fun , positively impacting children’s motivation to participate in design processes [ 30 ] and interact with technology [ 33 ] . To gain insights into how fun can play a role in PD processes involving children , we refer to previous literature on fun . The literature has put forward several meaningful interpretations of fun , which may be relevant in the context of PD processes . First , children - and adults alike - often experience fun as the outcome of challenging activities , such as solving problems or discovering new things [ 20 ] . Malone [ 21 ] relates fun to interface design . He defines ‘challenge’ ( i . e . whether or not the game has a clear goal and the player’s likelihood of winning is unsure ) as a component that computer games should comprise to be considered captivating . Papert [ 34 ] refers to the notion of ‘hard fun’ , to indicate that something can be fun because it is hard rather than in spite of being hard . Second , according to Woolley [ 18 ] , a fun experience can be understood in terms of whether it is active or passive ( i . e . how engaged in the activity a person is ) . Similarly , Shneiderman [ 20 ] makes the distinction between fun - in - doing and fun - in - not - doing . The former relates to more active forms of fun , such as dancing , while the latter entails more relaxing and calm forms in which action or goals are absent ( e . g . listening to music ) . Third , the experience of fun is also shaped by interaction with others [ 18 ] . Some authors , such as Reed [ 35 ] emphasize that social interaction is a vital component to experiences of fun . Similarly , according to Druin & Inkpen [ 36 ] , children find it fun to play , and share experiences , with others . Short Papers ( Notes ) IDC 2018 , June 19 – 22 , 2018 , Trondheim , Norway 397 Together , these studies show how fun can be of relevance in PD processes involving children . However , as these interpretations show , fun as a user gain for children has been mainly researched as a rather functional , utilitarian guiding principle . Fun as a user gain is hardly touched upon within the IDC community . We now reflect on the role of fun as children’s user gain by means of a case study . In doing so , we discuss the involved participants ( 4 . 1 ) , the process of the case study ( 4 . 2 ) , and the data analysis ( 4 . 3 ) . 4 . CASE STUDY : ‘MAKING THINGS ! ’ ‘Making Things ! ’ is an on - going long - term PD process ( January 2015 - August 2018 ) in which children are involved in the design of FabLab workshops for the future . This process is set up by the first two authors of this article : two design researchers of FabLab Genk ( part of LUCA , School of Arts ) together with a local youth work organisation ( ‘LYWO’ ) . LYWO aims to offer activities in leisure time with attention to the wellbeing of the ( socially disadvantaged ) children . LYWO’s mission is to empower children by seeing them as active individuals with their own strengths and possibilities that can shape and give meaning to society , instead of problem youths . The organisation strives to give children the opportunity to play freely , have fun , and be themselves [ 37 ] . Hence , the aims of ‘Making Things ! ’ - and its focus on children’s user gains - fit the aims of LYWO . ‘Making Things ! ’ aims for designing FabLab workshops for the future , in a participatory manner . In this way , the case study is an exploration of providing children with opportunities to ( co - ) design PD processes ( cf . [ 16 ] ) . By encouraging children to design the workshops themselves before effectively participating in them , we hope they can create better FabLab workshops for the future that they can continue to use after ‘Making Things ! ’ or that can be appropriated by other stakeholders . 4 . 1 Participants In ‘Making Things ! ’ between 55 and 65 local children from primarily Moroccan and Turkish descent , eight youth workers and two design researchers are involved . As participation of the children in the activities is voluntary - both in the research reported on in this paper as well as the activities of LYWO - and weekly presence is not mandatory , the group of children changes every week , with a core group of about 30 participants . This means that , each week , between 25 and 35 children participate in the research activities of ‘Making Things ! ’ . LYWO activities are all group - based , and children are divided according to age : toddlers ( 3 - 6 y / o ) , children ( 6 - 12 y / o ) , teenage girls ( 10 - 16 y / o ) and teenage boys ( 10 - 16 y / o ) . For practical reasons , this paper focuses on the involvement of the 6 to 12 year olds . 4 . 2 Process In what follows we detail the research process which consists of five phases ( see : Table 1 ) , including 1 ) participatory observations and sensitising packages ; 2 ) a participatory mapping ; 3 ) a first iteration of the workshops ; 4 ) evaluations ; and 5 ) a second iteration of the workshops , followed by interviews . 4 . 2 . 1 Phase 1 : observations / sensitizing packages First , from April to May 2016 , six sessions of participant observations ( PO ) [ 38 ] were carried out , involving a total of 55 to 65 boys and girls ( PO 6 . 1 - PO 6 . 6 ) . We focused on how the children engaged in diverse activities organised by LYWO ( e . g . games or crafting ) and how they interacted with peers and the youth workers . Next , 20 children were handed over a sensitising package ( SP ) [ 39 ] containing two assignments to express - through drawing , writing or crafting - experiences and ideas related to the workshops ( SP 2 . 1 and SP 2 . 2 ) . In total , 20 children completed the first assignment and 18 children the second one . 4 . 2 . 2 Phase 2 : participatory mapping On 7 May 2016 a participatory mapping ( PM ) [ 18 ] with 29 children - including the ones who completed the sensitising package - was organised ( PM 2 . 1 ) . By putting adhesive , play - related icons on a large paper and explaining the rationale , the children reflected on their vision and notion of play and discussed what activities they considered as fun . 4 . 2 . 3 Phase 3 : low - tech workshops Third , on 29 June 2016 , 33 boys and girls participated in a first low - tech workshop ( LTWS ) in which they were invited to make and customize paper ornaments , jumping - jack puppets and necklaces ( LTWS 3 . 1 ) . The goal was to yield insights in their making skills and knowledge , to inspire the design of the FabLab workshops . In July - November 2016 , three other low - tech workshops took place in the FabLab in which approximately 30 children experimented with some of the available machines ( LTWS 3 . 2 - LTWS 3 . 4 ) . 4 . 2 . 4 Phase 4 : evaluations ( brainstorms and interviews ) Fourthly , after each workshop in phase 3 , the participating children were invited to take part in informal brainstorms ( IB ) ( June - December 2016 ; IB 4 . 1 - IB 4 . 4 ) . They evaluated their experiences and expectations of the past and future workshops , including what they thought they had gained from them . Additionally , unstructured interviews ( UI ) with three youth workers of LYWO ( 24 November and 15 December 2016 ; UI 4 . 1 - UI 4 . 3 ) were carried out . We found it important to include the youth workers in assessing children’s users gains , as the children often talked to them about what they had gained from a specific workshop while the researchers were not present ( e . g . on their way from the FabLab back to LYWO’s facilities ) . As LYWO foregrounds user gains as well as having fun in their activities , the youth workers were familiarized with these objectives and used to critically reflect on these matters . 4 . 2 . 5 Phase 5 : high - tech workshops ( and evaluations ) Finally , four high - tech workshops ( HTWS ) were organised ( April - November 2017 ; HTWS 5 . 1 - HTWS 5 . 4 ) in which approximately 50 children experimented with electronics , hardware and software via Ozobot ( https : / / ozobot . com / ) , Makey Makey ( https : / / makeymakey . com / ) , and soldering . Short Papers ( Notes ) IDC 2018 , June 19 – 22 , 2018 , Trondheim , Norway 398 An important part of these workshops entailed experimenting with LittleBits ( littlebits . cc ) , i . e . modular electronic building blocks that connect through magnets and can be used to create , for instance , a keytar . We ended the activities with assembling a cube out of straws and pipe cleaners to make spherical soap bubbles . These workshops were evaluated through unstructured interviews ( UI ) with the children ( UI 5 . 1 - UI 5 . 4 ) . Furthermore , the LYWO youth worker who was most involved in the process and collaborated intensively with us ( i . e . ‘Abby’ ) evaluated the workshops by taking part in a semi - structured interview ( SI ) on 27 October 2017 ( SI 5 . 1 ) .

Table 1 . Short overview of the ‘Making Things ! ’ process . 4 . 3 Analysis Over two years of ethnographic fieldwork , our field documentation included audio - and video recordings , sensitising packages , transcribed interviews , logged field notes and other output ( e . g . background maps ) . For the scope of this paper , the informal brainstorms , observations of the workshops 1 and semi - or unstructured interviews with the children and youth workers appeared to contain most relevant data for exploring fun as a user gain . Both the informal brainstorms ( ‘IB 4 . 1’ - ‘IB 4 . 4’ ) and unstructured interviews with the children ( after each workshop , ‘UI 5 . 1’ - ‘UI 5 . 4’ ) were videotaped . Audio - documentation was retrieved from the semi - and unstructured interviews with the youth workers ( ‘UI 4 . 1’ - ‘UI 4 . 3’ and ‘SI 5 . 1’ ) . The audio - and video documentation of brainstorms and interviews was then transcribed and complemented with written researchers’ notes . The first two authors of this paper , who engaged in the data gathering , also performed the qualitative data analysis . Various coding iterations were performed , starting with an open coding based on the field notes taken by the researchers during the brainstorms , observations and interviews , to then look for recurring patterns and relations in the data . In a final coding iteration the codes were clustered and grouped into categories . The following categories were identified : 1 ) fun in overcoming challenges ; 2 ) fun in working towards finalised objects ; 3 ) fun in experimenting ; and 4 ) fun in interacting with others . During this last coding iteration , the distinction between indirect and direct user gains began to emerge , which appeared to be relevant to account for a seeming overlap between the categories ( rather , this can be explained by some of the findings being categorised as ‘direct gain’ and others as ‘indirect gain’ ) . The results should thus be interpreted in this light . 5 . RESULTS In the following part , we discuss children’s user gains , focusing on fun in relation to overcoming challenges ( 5 . 1 ) , working towards finalised objects ( 5 . 2 ) , experimenting ( 5 . 3 ) , and interacting with others ( 5 . 4 ) . Although we specifically discuss the benefits experienced and expressed by children during the brainstorms and interviews ( IB 4 . 1 - IB 4 . 4 and UI 5 . 1 - UI 5 . 4 ) , these findings were further complemented by data from the interviews with the youth workers ( UI 4 . 1 to UI 4 . 3 and SI 5 . 1 ) . 5 . 1 Fun in overcoming challenges A major finding concerning fun as a user gain is related to overcoming challenges . To illustrate , both the children ( IB 4 . 1 - 4 . 4 ) and Abby ( UI 4 . 3 and SI 5 . 1 ) discussed the workshops in which they assembled and customized laser - cut boxes ( LTWS 3 . 2 - 3 . 4 ) . They said to experience difficulties in assembling the boxes because of the puzzle - like edges that needed to fit correctly . Children actively sought the help of peers , the youth worker and us . With some assistance , most of the children were able to assemble 1 To clarify , the workshops in the FabLab and the workshops for the data gathering were one and the same . Short Papers ( Notes ) IDC 2018 , June 19 – 22 , 2018 , Trondheim , Norway 399 the boxes . Afterwards they all looked back on it as ‘being fun’ . The youth worker implied that the children were excited that they pulled it off : “ almost everyone came to me to show [ their finished boxes ] . ( . . . ) That sense of pride , “look what I made ! ” and the fact that they took their boxes home and worked further on them , that’s fantastic ” ( Abby , SI 5 . 1 ) . The majority of the children also enthusiastically and proudly showed their boxes to their parents . However , it is difficult to find the sweet spot for fun in relation to overcoming challenges . One of the children specifically referred to the high - tech workshops in which they made the bubble cube ( HTWS 5 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) : “ [ I didn’t like making ] the cube . It was a bit too hard” ( Irmak , girl , 9 y / o , UI 5 . 1 ) . Abby confirmed that the children found the activity too challenging and therefore ‘no fun’ . Furthermore , results from the interview with the youth worker revealed that through overcoming challenging activities ( like assembling the boxes ) , the children developed a sense of self - esteem , a confidence in their own skills and persistence : “ that’s important , ( . . . ) they learn that although this doesn’t seem feasible in the beginning , once they persevere ( . . . ) , they’re able to do it . And then , over time , you’ll start to notice that the children start to believe in themselves as well ” ( Abby , UI 4 . 3 ) . 5 . 2 Fun in working towards finalised objects Although we explicitly stimulated experimentation and tried to show that things do not always work out or break down , the participating children were very result - driven and experienced a lot of fun in having something finished at the end of the workshops , particularly the older children ( 10 - 12 y / o ) . For instance , in the high - tech - workshops ( HTWS 5 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) in which the children made the spherical soap bubble cube , we wanted to let them explore a problem - solving trial - and - error process . The cube needed to be almost perfectly square to result in a lasting bubble , which appeared to be difficult and only some of the children succeeded . The interviews after the workshops showed that the children did not experience this process as being fun : “I just wanted to have my square bubble … I got very frustrated because I had to try over and over again” ( Sükran , girl , 11 y / o , UI 5 . 1 ) . This focus on the end - result was less present amongst the younger children ( 6 – 10 y / o ) who took part in similar workshops as the older ones ( 10 – 12 y / o ) . For instance , in one of the workshops , all children created a Halloween - themed puppet ( LTWS 3 . 1 ) . When showing his puppet , Eslem ( girl , 6 y / o ) drew attention to the fact that Mehmet’s ( boy , 7 y / o ) puppet missed a leg , Mehmet replied : “ That’s okay . It’s one that has just one leg because it wasn’t finished ” ( UI 5 . 2 ) . Abby stated that : “the younger ones ( . . . ) really have fun in creating something . Whereas the older ones , ( . . . ) , it has to go fast because it has to be finished . They are focused on the result and not on creating something ” ( SI 5 . 1 ) . 5 . 3 Fun in experimenting Our results further showed that children experienced fun in creating . Whether they participated in making a keytar with LittleBits or in customizing necklaces , the children enjoyed being creative : “ [ I liked it ] because we got to make stuff ourselves . And got to make music ourselves” ( Kerem , boy , 7 y / o , UI 5 . 1 ) . Particularly the younger children ( 6 – 10 y / o ) got completely absorbed in creative activities . Whereas the girls were particularly fond of doing arts and crafts , the boys took a particular liking in creating cars with LittleBits and making music with Makey Makey kits : “Although the wheels didn’t work , the boys really liked [ creating cars with the LittleBits ] ” ( Abby , UI 4 . 3 ) . Figure 1 : Soldering and experimenting with Makey Makey . When partaking in creative activities , the younger children clearly had fun in experimenting while doing so . The sole act of experimenting ( e . g . with electronics or crafting ) was a distinctive user gain for them . For instance , during the LittleBits workshop ( HTWS 5 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) , the younger children immediately started trying out different compositions with the building blocks , whereas the older ones first created the desired end - result and then - if there was time left - began experimenting . As Abby stated : “in the beginning [ Nora , girl , 7 y / o ] just wanted to make the right composition and afterwards , [ she ] started experimenting with the different components , but only after she made the keytar” ( SI 5 . 1 ) . When children experienced fun in experimenting , they also were open to learning . For instance , while experimenting with Makey Makey ( HTWS 5 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) , the children wanted to know why certain elements could function as keyboard key and other elements could not ( see : Figure 1 ) . They showed eagerness to learn more about conductive objects ; this was illustrated by Ravza ( 6 y / o , girl , UI 5 . 4 ) in response to a workshop in which we experimented with soldering : “trying to do that [ soldering ] was really fun ( . . . ) . I have never done it but I know now that some things melt and others don’t” . 5 . 4 Fun in interacting with others Children were constantly seeking out opportunities to play with each other and engage in teamwork ; this suggested they gained fun in interacting with others . For instance , they explicitly asked to work together to create a keytar Short Papers ( Notes ) IDC 2018 , June 19 – 22 , 2018 , Trondheim , Norway 400 even though we provided them with a LittleBits kit per child ( see : Figure 2 ) . When playing with the Ozobot ( HTWS 5 . 2 ) , we observed the children actively interacting with each other , for instance by drawing paths for the robot together . When the children were asked whether they preferred to tinker with the Ozobot alone or together , Emin ( boy , 9 y / o ) replied : “I like to play together . It is more fun ! ” ( UI 5 . 2 ) . Fun in interacting with others was also foregrounded through the children explicitly seeking each other out to ‘perform’ for each other , after creating their keytars . Throwing these ‘shows’ was not an assignment , but something that happened in the moment : “They had a lot of fun , especially when giving their performances ! ” ( Abby , SI 5 . 1 ) . Abby further explained that the children felt more comfortable to do something in group , instead of alone . She felt that this allowed some children to step out of their comfort zones more easily ( Abby , SI 5 . 1 ) . Figure 2 : Working together to create a keytar and performing . 6 . DISCUSSION The ‘Making Things ! ’ case study allowed us to come to two reflections on fun as user gain in PD processes involving children ( 6 . 1 and 6 . 2 ) , but also posed some challenges ( 6 . 3 ) . 6 . 1 Fun as direct and indirect user gain First , Bossen et al [ 3 , 4 ] have touched upon the distinction between direct and indirect user gains . As examples of indirect user gains , they referred to voices that have been heard in a design process . Direct gains can include the ( further ) development of personal skills or an improved quality of work or life . Our results point to another distinction that can be made between different types of user gains ; between fun as user gain an sich versus fun in relation to other gains . By pointing out the fun that children experienced in overcoming challenges , in working towards finalised objects , experimenting and in interacting with each other , we showed that fun in itself can be a user gain in a rather direct way . Furthermore , our findings also suggested that fun as a user gain is indirectly related to other user gains . For instance , through overcoming the challenge of assembling the boxes and having fun in doing so , the children developed a sense of self - esteem , and felt proud of their own skills and persistence . Fun through interacting with each other – e . g . through performances – related to daring to step out of the comfort zone . 6 . 2 The child as process designer Second , we acknowledge that although the user gains discussed in this paper were assessed with children , the methods used for doing so were very much selected and designed by adults . Adult researchers often believe that they understand how children think and behave [ 40 ] . Misrepresentations may arise since researchers and children have different assumptions [ 41 ] , for instance of how methods for assessing user gains should be used in that process . We did not evaluate whether the assessment of the user gains itself ( e . g . through the informal brainstorms with the children ) was experienced as fun by the children . When reflecting on the role of process designer [ 16 ] , the assessment of children’s’ user gains [ 3 , 4 ] would be particularly relevant . We refer to Vaajakallio [ 42 ] who , in relation to design games , discusses how the design of methods is part of co - design . She reports that even a minor involvement in adjusting the method has proven to increase the participants’ feelings of empowerment . Doing so “ would be a fruitful area to explore different forms of participation and different degrees of sharing control in the design process ” , Vines et al . ( [ 43 ] , p . 436 ) state . In this line of thought , we believe that opening up the assessment of children’s user gains would fit the notion of the child as process designer . The further investigation of this forms an essential part of our follow - up research . 6 . 3 Challenges Although fun is often considered as self - evidently in workshops with children , our research showed fun as a user gain in PD processes is not always straightforward . We found it is closely connected to the conditions for flow . As Csikszentmihalyi [ 44 ] points out , flow is to be situated somewhere at the sweet spot between not being too easy ( then it becomes boring ) and not being too hard ( which might cause frustration ) . Similarly , our study showed that children expressed to experience fun when the PD activities demanded efforts that matched their capabilities . In future research , a challenge thus lies in finding a balance between ‘fun’ and ‘not fun’ . 7 . CONCLUSION The reflection on ‘Making Things ! ’ shows how the child - participants gained from the process through experiencing fun in overcoming challenges , working towards finalised objects , experimenting , and interacting with others . Based on our findings , we state that fun can be a direct user gain , but can also relate to additional gains ( e . g . developing a sense of self - esteem , being proud of their own skills and persistence and stepping out of the comfort zone more easily ) . We also discuss that opening up the assessment of children’s user gains would fit the notion of the child as process designer and forms [ 16 ] . However , more research is needed for this and will be carried out ( e . g . in the continuation of ‘Making Things ! ’ ) .

SELECTION AND PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN In ‘Making Things ! ’ , between 55 and 65 local children from primarily Moroccan and Turkish descent ( 6 - 12 years old ) participated ; they were all members of LYWO . As this study took place in the context of the LYWO , we obtained a signed consent form from the youth work organisation . Children and their parents were told about the objective of the research and had the opportunity to ask questions ; parents provided consent orally for their children and the children assented to participate . Participation of the children in the research activities - as well as LYWO’s activities - is voluntary ; they can leave at any time without adverse consequences . Moreover , pseudonyms are used in this paper to ensure the privacy of each participant ( children and youth workers ) and the youth work organisation . 9 . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ‘Making Things ! ’ is funded by LUCA , School of Arts’ research platform . We thank the children and LYWO’s youth workers for their participation . 10 . REFERENCES 1 .
