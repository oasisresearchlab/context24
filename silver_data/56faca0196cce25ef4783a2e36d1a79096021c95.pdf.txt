Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos M . J . Evans· & M . H . Kaufmant Departments of Genetics * and Anatomyt . University of Cambridge , Downing Street . Cambridge CB2 3EH , UK Pluripotential ceUs are present in a mouse embryo until at least an early post - implantation stage , as shown by their ability to take part in the formation of chbnaerlc animals l and to form teratocarcinomasz• Until now it has not been possible to es tablish progressively growing cultures of these ceDs In vitro , and ceU Ones have only been obtained after teratocarcinoma forma tion In vivo . We report here the establishment in tissue culture of pluripotent ceU lines which have been isolated directly from In vitro cultures of mouse blastocysts . These ceUs are able to differentiate either in vitro or after innoculation into a mouse as a tumour in vivo . They have a normal karyotype . 0028 - 0836 / 81 / 280154 - - 03 $ 0 1 . 00 Nature Vol . 292 9 July 1981 Fig . l Groups of pluripotential embryo cells ( arrowed ) growing in monolayer culture on a background of mitomycin C - inhibited STO cells . The isolation of a definite cell line from a blastocyst takes only - 3 weeks and the pluripotential cell colonies are visible within 5 days of passage . We have had 30 % yield of lines from blastocysts in one experiment . Two of the lines have been rigorously cloned by single - cell isolation but most were only colony - picked - this makes no difference . Previous attempts to obtain cultures of pluripotential cells directly from a mouse embryo have been unsuccessfue , 4 , although cells with a similar appearance have been reported to be present transiently5 . 6 . We considered that success might depend on three critical factors : ( 1 ) the exact stage at which pluripotential cells capable of growth in tissue culture exist in the embryo ; ( 2 ) explantation of a sufficiently large number of these precursor cells from each embryo ; and ( 3 ) tissue culture in conditions most conducive to multiplication rather than differentiation of these embryonic cells . These considerations have been discussed at greater length elsewhere ' . An indication of the optimal stage of embryonic development might be gained by a comparison of the properties of embryonic cells at various stages with established cultures of embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cells . Cell - surface antigen expression and the patterns of protein synthesis revealed by two - dimensional electrophoresis have suggested that neither the cells of the 6 ! - day ectoderm nor those of the 3 ! - day inner cell mass show homology with EC cells , but that epiblast cells of the early post - implantation embryo at 5 ! days post coitum may do S08 ( the day of finding coital plug is termed day ! ) , Cells from embryos of an early post - implantation stage seem to be the best candidates for direct progenitors of pluripotential cells in culture . As these embryos are difficult to isolate , and as the cell number in the isolated epiblast is small , we chose an alternative route to obtain embryo cells at this stage of development . Mouse blastocysts may be induced to enter a state of diapallse just before implantation . This delay in implantation depends on the maternal hormonal conditions , and may be induced experimentally by ovariectomy at an appropriate stage 9• Embryos in implantational delay hatch from the zona but remain free - floating in the uterine lumen . A gradual increase in cell number occurs lO , and the primary endoderm may be formed but no further development takes place until implantation occurs , under the control of hormonal stimuli . 129 SvE mice were caged in pairs and examined for mating plugs each morning . They were ovariectomized on the afternoon of day 2 ! of pregnancy , injected subcutaneously with 1 mg Depo - Provera ( Upjohn ) , and delayed blastocysts were reco vered 4 - 6 days later . The blastocysts were cultured intact in © 1981 Macmillan Journals Ltd © Nature Publishing Group 1981 Nature Vo ! ' 292 9 July 1981 groups of about six embryos in small drops of tissue culture medium under paraffin oil on tissue culture plastic Petri dishes for 4 days . The blastocysts attached within 48 h and the tro phectoderm cells grew out and differentiated into giant tropho blast cells . The inner cell mass cells subsequently developed into large egg cylinder - like structures , with a group of small round cells surrounded by endodermal cells growing attached to the Petri dish . The egg cylinder - like structures were picked off the dish , dispersed by trypsin treatment and passaged on to gelatin pretreated Petri dishes containing mitomycin C - inactivated STO fibroblasts . All culture was carried out in Dulbecco ' s modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 10 % newborn calf serum . The cultures were examined daily and passaged by trypsinization every 2 - 3 days . Actively proliferating colonies of cells closely resembling EC cells were apparent from an early stage . These colonies were picked out , passaged and mass cultures grown . The cell cultures had the appearance and general growth characteristics of feeder - dependent EC cells ( Fig . 1 ) . The embryos used to initiate these cultures are from normal 129 SvE strain mice , that is , from the same strain of mice as many EC cell lines , in particular those grown in this laboratory . Therefore it was important to exclude any possibility of contamination of these cultures with EC cells from established cell lines . Cell cultures were established from different embryos in three separate experimental series , but the best indication of their separate identity came from their karyotype . Cultures were initiated from 6 - 12 embryos , thus it might be expected that both male and female cells should be present . None of the 129 embryonal carcinoma cell lines in this laboratory have a normal karyotype , and , in particular - in common with most available embryonal carcinoma cell lines - they do not contain a Y chromosome . These embryo - derived cells have a completely normal karyotype . An XY karyotype is shown in Fig . 2 . Three additional cell lines have been analysed ; two of these are normal 40XX and one is normal40XY . We have termed these directly embryo - derived cells EK to distinguish them from EC cells . EK cells grow rapidly in culture and have been maintained for over 30 passages in vitro . Cultures of EK cells were collected by trypsinization , and _ 10 6 cells injected subcutaneously into the flank of syngeneic male mice . Tumours grew in all cases , and histological examina tion of these revealed that they were teratocarcinomas . When the EK cells were passaged without feeder cells they formed embryoid bodies which , when kept in suspension , became cystic . ~ • a " A . . - • ~ • , . . . . . . , , •• • . . • A • t • • • . . . . • ~ • - . . . . . . • Fig . 2 Karyotype of an embryo - derived pluripotential cell line , 40XY .

All these procedures may result in chimaerism of the resulting mouse ; h , the missing link supplied here . Embryoid bodies allowed to attach to a Petri dish spread out and differentiated in the usual way into a complex of tissues . Preli minary observations indicate that , like early ectoderm cells of the mouse embryo and EC cells , EK cells carrl the cell - surface antigens recognized by M1 - 22 - 25 ( Forssman ) . 11 and anti - I Ma ( lacto - N - iso - octaosyl ceramide ) 12 . 13 and also that two dimen sional gel electrophoretic separations of their proteins very closely resemble those of the EC cell line PSMB . We have demonstrated here that it is possible to isolate pluripotential cells directly from early embryos and that they behave in a manner equivalent to EC cells isolated from terato carcinomas . The network of inter - relationships between the mouse embryo and pluripotential cells derived from it has previously lacked only the direct link between the embryo and cells in culture for completion . We have now demonstrated this ( Fig . 3 ) . Teratocarcinoma cells are now being widely used as a model for the study of developmental processes of early embryonic cell commitment and differentiation . Their use as a vehicle for the transfer into the mouse genome of mutant alleles , either selected in cell culture or inserted into the cells via transformation with speciflc DNA fragments , has been presented as an attractive proposition . In many of these studies the use of pluripotential cells directly isolated from the embryos under study should have great advantages . We have now shown that these EK cell lines are readily established from cultures of single blastocysts and so far have 15 lines of independent embryonic origin , some of which have been isolated from non - 129 , outbred mouse stocks . We are now studying the chimaeric mice formed from these cells . We thank Mrs A . Burling for technical assistance and Dr E . P . Evans for advice regarding karyotype analysis . M . J . E . and M .

Numerous antisera have been raised which detect antigens that are expressed in early embryonic cells and become restricted during differentiation , being expressed in only a minority of adult cells ( reviewed in refs 1 - 3 ) . The precise antigenic determinants recognized by such antisera have not been defined . However , studies using a hybri doma antibody against mouse spleen cells 4 and monoclonal autoantibodies of patients with cold agglutinin diseaseS have shown that two defined carbohydrate antigen systems , the Forssman and the Ii antigens , have stage - specific expression in early mouse embryos . We now describe evidence that the stage - specific embryonic antigen SSEA - l ( ref . 6 ) involves the carbohydrate sequence Gallli - + 4GlcNAc i 1 . 3 Fuca This determinant is formed by a 1 - + 3 fucosylation of blood group I or i antigens which are branched or linear oligo sac charides , respectively7 - 9 , built of Gallll - + 4GlcNAc units and known as type 2 precursor chains 10 of the major blood group antigens . Thus , we introduce the concept of simple glycosylation changes as a basis for stage - specific expression of embryonic antigens . A relationship between the stage - specific embryonic antigen , SSEA - 1 , and blood group I antigen was suggested by : ( 1 ) some similarities in the distribution of these two antigens in early post - implantation embryos and teratocarcinomass . lI , and ( 2 ) the reactivities of anti - I and - SSEA - 1 reagents with a gly cosphingolipid fraction of erythrocytes 12• Subsequent immunocytochemical studies ( to be described elsewhere ) have clearly shown that the two antigens are not identical . Further more , in binding assays using radio iodinated blood group 1 - active glycoproteinsl3 isolated from sheep gastric mucins and human meconium , the anti - SSEA - 1 reagent gave a binding curve only with the latter glycoprotein ( Fig . 1 ) . The specificity of anti - SSEA - 1 reagent was further investi gated by inhibition assays using blood group substances with known A , B , H , Lewisa , Lewis b , I and i activities , some of which 0028 - 0836 / 81 / 280156 - 03 $ 01 . 00 Nature Vol . 292 9 July 1981 are shown in Fig . 1 . These substances were clearly divisible into two groups : those with potent inhibitory activities , giving 50 % inhibition at 0 . 3 - 6 fJ . g ml - l , and those with negligible or weak activities requiring concentrations > 100 fJ . g ml - l for 50 % inhibition . Almost all the substances with strong SSEA - 1 activity lacked blood group ABH activities but expressed Lea and / or Ii activities . The two ovarian cyst glycoproteins with the strongest SSEA - 1 activity , designated N - 11O % and F1 , contained 8 . 5 % and 1 . 6 % fucose , respectivelyI4 . ls . In experiments to be described else where , we showed that their reaction with anti - SSEA - 1 was abolished by mild acid hydrolysis . Thus , it seemed likely that the SSEA - 1 determinant involved fucose residue ( s ) and that the fucosyllinkage was other than those associated with A , B , H , Lea or Le b activities lO• This agrees with previous evidence for the presence of unusual fucosyl glycopeptides20 in undifferentiated cells of mouse embryos and teratocarcinomas . Inhibition of binding assays were next performed with chem ically synthesized21 - 23 and natural oligosaccharidesl4 . 24 contain ing type 1 ( Gal { H - + 3GlcNAc ) or type 2 ( GaI131 - + 4GlcNAc / Glc ) precursor chain10 sequences ( Fig . 2 ) . Whereas Ii - active synthetic tri - and pentasaccharides consisting of type 2 precursor chains were inactive as inhibitors of anti - SSEA - 1 , several fucose - containing oligosaccharides showed inhibitory activities . The most active inhibitor ( IDso 0 . 5 nmol ) was the oligosaccharide designated N - 1 RL O . 71a , containing a fucosyl ated type 2 sequence : Gal131 - + GIcNAc fl . 3 Fuca This oligosaccharide was one of several isolated from gly coprotein N - 1 after partial alkaline degradationl4 . The very poor inhibitory activity of 3 - fucosyl lactose indicated that subterminal N - acetyl glucosamine is an important component of c : .
