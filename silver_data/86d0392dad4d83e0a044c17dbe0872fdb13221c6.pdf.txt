Abstract Targeted nucleases are powerful tools for mediating genome alteration with high precision . The RNA - guided Cas9 nuclease from the microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) adaptive immune system can be used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells by simply specifying a 20 - nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA . Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9 - mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining ( NHEJ ) or homology - directed repair ( HDR ) in mammalian cells , as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies . to minimize off - target cleavage , we further describe a double - nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs . This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites , evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off - target activity . Beginning with target design , gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1 – 2 weeks , and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2 – 3 weeks . © 2013 Nature America , Inc .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t INTRODUCTION The ability to engineer biological systems and organisms holds enormous potential for applications across basic science , medicine and biotechnology . Programmable sequence - specific endonucleases that facilitate precise editing of endogenous genomic loci are now enabling systematic interrogation of genetic elements and causal genetic variations 1 , 2 in a broad range of species , including those that have not previously been genetically tractable 3 – 6 . A number of genome editing technologies have emerged in recent years , including zinc - finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) 7 – 10 , transcription activator – like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) 10 – 17 and the RNA - guided CRISPR - Cas nuclease system 18 – 25 . The first two technologies use a strategy of tethering endonuclease catalytic domains to modular DNA - binding proteins for inducing targeted DNA double - stranded breaks ( DSBs ) at specific genomic loci . By contrast , Cas9 is a nuclease guided by small RNAs through Watson - Crick base pairing with target DNA 26 – 28 ( Fig . 1 ) , representing a system that is markedly easier to design , highly specific , efficient and well - suited for high - throughput and multiplexed gene editing for a variety of cell types and organisms . Precise genome editing using engineered nucleases Similarly to ZFNs and TALENs , Cas9 promotes genome editing by stimulating a DSB at a target genomic locus 29 , 30 . Upon cleavage by Cas9 , the target locus typically undergoes one of two major pathways for DNA damage repair ( Fig . 2 ) : the error - prone NHEJ or the high - fidelity HDR pathway , both of which can be used to achieve a desired editing outcome . In the absence of a repair template , DSBs are re - ligated through the NHEJ process , which leaves scars in the form of insertion / deletion ( indel ) mutations . NHEJ can be harnessed to mediate gene knockouts , as indels occurring within a coding exon can lead to frameshift mutations and premature stop codons 31 . Multiple DSBs can additionally be exploited to mediate larger deletions in the genome 22 , 32 . HDR is an alternative major DNA repair pathway . Although HDR typically occurs at lower and substantially more variable frequencies than NHEJ , it can be leveraged to generate precise , defined modifications at a target locus in the presence of an exogenously introduced repair template . The repair template can either be in the form of conventional double - stranded DNA targeting constructs with homology arms flanking the insertion sequence , or single - stranded DNA oligonucleotides ( ssODNs ) . The latter provides an effective and simple method for making small edits in the genome , such as the introduction of single - nucleotide mutations for probing causal genetic variations 32 . Unlike NHEJ , HDR is generally active only in dividing cells , and its efficiency can vary widely depending on the cell type and state , as well as the genomic locus and repair template 33 . Cas9 : an RNA - guided nuclease for genome editing CRISPR - Cas is a microbial adaptive immune system that uses RNA - guided nucleases to cleave foreign genetic elements 18 – 21 , 26 . Three types ( I – III ) of CRISPR systems have been identified across a wide range of bacterial and archaeal hosts , wherein each system comprises a cluster of CRISPR - associated ( Cas ) genes , noncoding RNAs and a distinctive array of repetitive elements ( direct repeats ) . These repeats are interspaced by short variable Ran et al . Page 2 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t sequences 20 derived from exogenous DNA targets known as protospacers , and together they constitute the CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) array . Within the DNA target , each protospacer is always associated with a protospacer adjacent motif ( PAM ) , which can vary depending on the specific CRISPR system 34 – 36 . The Type II CRISPR system is one of the best characterized 26 – 28 , 37 , 38 , consisting of the nuclease Cas9 , the crRNA array that encodes the guide RNAs and a required auxiliary trans - activating crRNA ( tracrRNA ) that facilitates the processing of the crRNA array into discrete units 26 , 28 . Each crRNA unit then contains a 20 - nt guide sequence and a partial direct repeat , where the former directs Cas9 to a 20 - bp DNA target via Watson - Crick base pairing ( Fig . 1 ) . In the CRISPR - Cas system derived from Streptococcus pyogenes ( which is the system used in this protocol ) , the target DNA must immediately precede a 5 ′ - NGG PAM 27 , whereas other Cas9 orthologs may have different PAM requirements , such as those of S . thermophilus ( 5 ′ - NNAGAA 22 , 26 for CRISPR1 and 5 ′ - NGGNG 28 , 37 for CRISPR3 ) and Neisseria meningiditis ( 5 ′ - NNNNGATT ) 39 . The RNA - guided nuclease function of CRISPR - Cas is reconstituted in mammalian cells through the heterologous expression of human codon – optimized Cas9 and the requisite RNA components 22 – 25 . Furthermore , the crRNA and tracrRNA can be fused together to create a chimeric , single - guide RNA ( sgRNA ) 27 ( Fig . 1 ) . Cas9 can thus be re - directed toward almost any target of interest in immediate vicinity of the PAM sequence by altering the 20 - nt guide sequence within the sgRNA . Given its ease of implementation and multiplexing capacity , Cas9 has been used to generate engineered eukaryotic cells carrying specific mutations via both NHEJ and HDR 22 – 25 , 40 . Direct injection of sgRNA and mRNA encoding Cas9 into embryos has enabled the rapid generation of transgenic mice with multiple modified alleles 41 , 42 . These results hold enormous promise for editing organisms that are otherwise genetically intractable . Cas9 nucleases carry out strand - specific cleavage by using the conserved HNH and RuvC nuclease domains , which can be mutated and exploited for additional function 37 . An aspartate - to - alanine ( D10A ) mutation in the RuvC catalytic domain 27 , 28 allows the Cas9 nickase mutant ( Cas9n ) to nick rather than cleave DNA to yield single - stranded breaks , and the subsequent preferential repair through HDR 22 can potentially decrease the frequency of unwanted indel mutations from off - target DSBs . Appropriately offset sgRNA pairs can guide Cas9n to simultaneously nick both strands of the target locus to mediate a DSB , thus effectively increasing the specificity of target recognition 43 . In addition , a Cas9 mutant with both DNA - cleaving catalytic residues mutated has been adapted to enable transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli 44 , demonstrating the potential of functionalizing Cas9 for diverse applications , such as recruitment of fluorescent protein labels or chromatin - modifying enzymes to specific genomic loci for reporting or modulating gene function . Here we explain in detail how to use a human codon – optimized , nuclear localization sequence - flanked wild - type ( WT ) Cas9 nuclease or mutant Cas9 nickase to facilitate eukaryotic gene editing . We describe considerations for designing the 20 - nt guide sequence , protocols for rapid construction and functional validation of sgRNAs and finally the use of Ran et al . Page 3 Nat Protoc .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t the Cas9 nuclease to mediate both NHEJ - and HDR - based genome modifications in human embryonic kidney ( HEK 293FT ) and human stem cell ( HUES9 ) lines ( Fig . 3 ) . The Cas9 system can similarly be applied to other cell types and organisms , including humans 22 , 23 , 25 , mice 22 , 41 , 45 , zebrafish 45 , Drosophila 46 and Caenorhabditis elegans 47 . Comparison with other genome editing technologies As with other designer nuclease technologies such as ZFNs and TALENs , Cas9 can facilitate targeted DNA DSBs at specific loci of interest in the mammalian genome and stimulate genome editing via NHEJ or HDR . Cas9 offers several potential advantages over ZFNs and TALENs , including the ease of customization , higher targeting efficiency and the ability to facilitate multiplex genome editing . As custom ZFNs are often difficult to engineer , we will primarily compare Cas9 with TALEN . • Ease of customization— Cas9 can be easily retargeted to new DNA sequences by simply purchasing a pair of oligos encoding the 20 - nt guide sequence . In contrast , retargeting of TALEN for a new DNA sequence requires the construction of two new TALEN genes . Although a variety of protocols exist for TALEN construction 14 , 17 , 48 , 49 , it takes substantially more hands - on time to construct a new pair of TALENs . • Cleavage pattern— WT S . pyogenes Cas9 ( SpCas9 ) is known to make a blunt cut between the 17th and 18th bases in the target sequence ( 3 bp 5 ′ of the PAM ) 27 . Mutating catalytic residues in either the RuvC or the HNH nuclease domain of SpCas9 converts the enzyme into a DNA nicking enzyme 22 , 27 . In contrast , TALENs cleave nonspecifically in the 12 – 24 - bp linker between the pair of TALEN monomer - binding sites 50 . • Editing efficiency— SpCas9 and TALENs have both been shown to facilitate efficient genome editing in a variety of cell types and organisms . However , owing to the ease of targeting , Cas9 can be used to target multiple genomic loci simultaneously , by co - delivering a combination of sgRNAs to the cells of interest . Limitations of the Cas9 system Cas9 can be targeted to specific genomic loci via a 20 - nt guide sequence on the sgRNA . The only requirement for the selection of Cas9 target sites is the presence of a PAM sequence directly 3 ′ of the 20 - bp target sequence . Each Cas9 ortholog has a unique PAM sequence ; for example , SpCas9 requires a 5 ′ - NGG PAM sequence . This PAM requirement does not severely limit the targeting range of SpCas9—in the human genome , such target sites can be found on average every 8 – 12 bp ( refs . 22 , 51 ) . In addition to the targeting range , another possible limitation is the potential for off - target mutagenesis ; please see Boxes 1 and 2 for details and strategies on minimizing off - target modifications . Experimental design Target selection for sgRNA— The specificity of the Cas9 nuclease is determined by the 20 - nt guide sequence within the sgRNA . For the S . pyogenes system , the target sequence ( e . g . , 5 ′ - GTCACCTCCAATGACTAGGG - 3 ′ ) must immediately precede ( i . e . , be 5 ′ to ) a 5 ′ - NGG PAM , and the 20 - nt guide sequence base pairs with the opposite strand to mediate Ran et al . Page 4 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Cas9 cleavage at ~ 3 bp upstream of the PAM ( Figs . 1 and 4a top strand example ) . Note that the PAM sequence is required to immediately follow the target DNA locus , but that it is not a part of the 20 - nt guide sequence within the sgRNA . Thus , there are two main considerations in the selection of the 20 - nt guide sequence for gene targeting : ( i ) the 5 ′ - NGG PAM for S . pyogenes Cas9 and ( ii ) the minimization of off - target activity 51 , 52 . We provide an online CRISPR Design Tool ( http : / / tools . genome - engineering . org ) that takes a genomic sequence of interest and identifies suitable target sites . To experimentally assess off - target genomic modifications for each sgRNA , we also provide computationally predicted off - target sites ( for a detailed discussion , see Box 1 ) for each intended target , ranked according to our quantitative specificity analysis on the effects of base - pairing mismatch identity , position and distribution . For increased targeting specificity , an alternative strategy using the D10A nickase mutant of Cas9 ( Cas9n ) along with a pair of sgRNAs may be used . The design criteria for orientation and spacing of such sgRNA pairs are described in Box 2 . The CRISPR Design Tool provides the sequences for all oligos and primers necessary for ( i ) preparing the sgRNA constructs , ( ii ) assaying target modification efficiency and ( iii ) assessing cleavage at potential off - target sites . It is worth noting that because the U6 RNA polymerase III promoter used to express the sgRNA prefers a guanine ( G ) nucleotide as the first base of its transcript 59 , an extra G is appended at the 5 ′ of the sgRNA where the 20 - nt guide sequence does not begin with G ( Fig . 4b , c ) . On rare occasions , certain sgRNAs may not work for reasons yet unknown ; therefore , we recommend designing at least two sgRNAs for each locus and testing their efficiencies in the intended cell type . Approaches for sgRNA construction and delivery— Depending on the desired application , sgRNAs can be delivered as either PCR amplicons containing an expression cassette ( Fig . 4b ) or sgRNA - expressing plasmids ( Fig . 4c ) . PCR - based sgRNA delivery appends the custom sgRNA sequence onto the reverse PCR primer used to amplify a U6 promoter template ( Fig . 4b ) . The resulting amplicon could be co - transfected with a Cas9 expression plasmid pSpCas9 . This method is optimal for rapid screening of multiple candidate sgRNAs , as cell transfections for functional testing can be performed shortly after obtaining the sgRNA - encoding primers . Because this simple method obviates the need for plasmid - based cloning and sequence verification , it is well suited for testing or co - transfecting a large number of sgRNAs for generating large knockout libraries or other scale - sensitive applications . Note that the sgRNA - encoding primers are over 100 bp long , compared with the ~ 20 - bp - long oligos required for plasmid - based sgRNA delivery . Construction of an expression plasmid for sgRNA is also simple and rapid , involving a single cloning step with a pair of partially complementary oligonucleotides . The oligo pairs encoding the 20 - nt guide sequences are annealed and ligated into a plasmid ( pSpCas9 ( BB ) , Fig . 4c ) bearing both Cas9 and the remainder of the sgRNA as an invariant scaffold immediately following the oligo cloning site . The transfection plasmids can also be modified to enable virus production for in vivo delivery . For these approaches , the following plasmids are used within this protocol : Cas9 alone ( pSpCas9 ) or Cas9 with an invariant sgRNA scaffold and cloning sites for inserting a guide sequence ( pSpCas9 ( BB ) ) . For the backbone Ran et al . Page 5 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cloning construct , we have also fused 2A - GFP or 2A - Puro to Cas9 to allow screening or selection of transfected cells ( pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP or pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro , respectively ) . Finally , we provide pSpCas9n ( BB ) , a D10A nickase mutant of Cas9 for HDR and for double - nicking applications ( Box 2 ) , along with the 2A - GFP and 2A - Puro fusion constructs ( pSpCas9n ( BB ) - 2A - GFP , pSpCas9n ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ) . In addition to PCR and plasmid - based delivery methods , Cas9 and sgRNAs can be introduced into cells as mRNA and RNA , respectively . Design of repair template— Traditionally , targeted DNA modifications have required the use of plasmid - based donor repair templates that contain homology arms flanking the site of alteration 54 , 55 ( Fig . 2 ) . The homology arms on each side can vary in length , but are typically longer than 500 bp ( refs . 55 , 56 ) . This method can be used to generate large modifications , including insertion of reporter genes such as fluorescent proteins or antibiotic resistance markers . The design and construction of targeting plasmids has been described elsewhere 57 . More recently , ssODNs have been used in place of targeting plasmids for short modifications within a defined locus without cloning 32 . To achieve high HDR efficiencies , ssODNs contain flanking sequences of at least 40 bp on each side that are homologous to the target region , and they can be oriented in either the sense or antisense direction relative to the target locus . It is worth noting that targeting efficiencies can vary widely depending on cell type , target locus , type of repair donor and location of modification relative to the DSB site . As a rule of thumb , single - base correction rates drop approximately fourfold at 100 bp away from the DSB site , and beyond 200 bp away drug selection markers may be required 58 . Clonal isolation of cell lines— Isolation of clonal cell lines with specific modifications is often desired . This can be achieved after transfection by isolating single cells through either FACS ( Steps 54 – 65 ) or serial dilutions ( Steps 66 – 70 ) , followed by an expansion period to establish a new clonal cell line . It is worth noting that cell types can vary substantially in their responses to single - cell isolation , and literature specific to the cell type of interest should be consulted . Functional testing SURVEYOR nuclease assay : In cells co - transfected with a pair of sgRNAs to mediate a genomic ( micro ) deletion or inversion , indel mutations can be detected either by the SURVEYOR nuclease assay 59 or by sequencing ( Fig . 5a ) . Our online CRISPR Design Tool provides recommended primers for both approaches . However , SURVEYOR or sequencing primers can also be designed manually to amplify the region of interest from genomic DNA . Custom primers are chosen using the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) Primer - BLAST in order to avoid nonspecific amplification . SURVEYOR primers should be designed to amplify 200 – 400 bp on either side of the Cas9 target ( for a total amplicon 400 – 800 bp long ) to allow clear visualization of cleavage bands by gel electrophoresis ( Fig . 5b ) . To prevent excessive primer dimer formation , SURVEYOR primers should be designed to be typically 18 to 25 nt long with melting temperatures of ~ 60 Ran et al . Page 6 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t °C . For SURVEYOR assay or sequencing analysis , we recommend testing that each pair of candidate primers produces a single PCR product , as well as testing for the absence of nonspecific cleavage during the SURVEYOR nuclease digestion process ( Fig . 5 ) . Plasmid - or ssODN - mediated HDR : HDR can be detected via PCR amplification , followed by either sequencing of the modified region or restriction - fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis . PCR primers for these purposes should anneal outside the region spanned by the homology arms to avoid false detection of residual repair template ( primers HDR - Fwd and HDR - Rev ; Table 1 and Fig . 6a ) . For ssODN - mediated HDR , SURVEYOR PCR primers may be used . Either the WT Cas9 nuclease or mutant Cas9 nickase can be used to mediate HDR , although the efficiency of the latter can vary widely by cell type . Detection of indels or HDR by sequencing : Targeted genome modifications can also be detected by either Sanger or deep sequencing . For the former , genomic DNA from the modified region can be amplified with either SURVEYOR or HDR primers . Amplicons should be subcloned into a plasmid such as pUC19 for transformation , and individual colonies should be sequenced to reveal the clonal genotype . Alternatively , deep sequencing is suitable for sampling a large number of samples or target sites . NGS primers are designed for shorter amplicons , typically in the 100 – 200 - bp size range . For the detection of NHEJ mutations , it is important to design primers situated at least 50 bp from the Cas9 target site to allow for the detection of longer indels . For larger deletions mediated by multiple sgRNAs , priming sites should be designed outside the deleted region . We provide guidelines for a two - step PCR fusion method to attach bar - coded sequencing adaptors for multiplex deep sequencing . We recommend the Illumina platform for its generally low levels of false positive indel detection . By comparison , Ion Torrent is less suitable for indel analysis owing to high sequencing error rate with homo - polymers 60 . Detailed descriptions of NGS optimization and troubleshooting can be found in the Illumina user manual . Off - target indel analysis ( Box 1 ) can then be performed through read - alignment programs such as ClustalW , Geneious or simple custom sequence analysis scripts .

We provide an online CRISPR Design Tool ( http : / / tools . genome - engineering . org ) that takes an input sequence ( for example , a 1 - kb genomic fragment from the region of interest ) , identifies and ranks suitable target sites and computationally predicts off - target sites for each intended target . Alternatively , one can manually select guide sequences by identifying the 20 - bp sequence directly upstream of any 5 ′ - NGG . 2 . Order necessary oligos and primers as specified by the online tool . If the cleavage site is chosen manually , the oligos or primers should be designed as described in Figure 4b , c . Design of the ssODN template ( optional ) ● TIMING 1 h 3 Design and order custom ssODN . Purchase either the sense or antisense ssODN directly from IDT or the preferred supplier . We recommend manually designing homology arms of at least 40 nt on either side and preferably 90 nt for optimal HDR efficiency . It is not necessary to PAGE - purify the ssODN . 4 Resuspend and dilute ssODN ultramers to a final concentration of 10 μM . Do not combine or anneal the sense and antisense ssODNs .

( A ) Generation of the sgRNA expression construct by PCR amplification ● TIMING 2 h i . Preparation of diluted U6 PCR template . We recommend using pSpCas9 ( BB ) or pSpCas9n ( BB ) ( supplementary Data 2 ) as a PCR template , but any U6 - containing plasmid can be used . Dilute the template with ddH 2 O to a concentration of 10 ng μl – 1 . Note that if a plasmid or cassette already containing a U6 - driven sgRNA is used as a template , a gel extraction will need to be performed after PCR ( Step 5A ( iv ) ) , using the QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , to ensure that the product contains only the intended sgRNA and no trace of sgRNA carryover from the template . ii . Preparation of diluted PCR primers . Dilute the U6 - Fwd and U6 - Rev ( designed either using the CRISPR Design Tool or by hand and unique for each sgRNA , Step 1 ) primers ( table 1 ) to a final concentration of 10 μM in ddH 2 O by adding 10 μl of the 100 μM primer stock to 90 μl of ddH 2 O . iii . U6 - sgRNA PCR . Set up the following reaction for each U6 - Rev primer as follows : Component Amount ( μl ) Final concentration Herculase II PCR buffer , 5× 10 1× dNTP , 100 mM ( 25 mM each ) 0 . 5 1 mM U6 PCR template ( pSpCas9 ( BB ) ) 1 0 . 2 ng μl −1 U6 - Fwd primer ( universal ) 1 0 . 2 μM U6 - Rev primer ( sgRNA specific ) 1 0 . 2 μM Herculase II fusion polymerase 0 . 5 Distilled water 36 Total 50 ▲ CRITICAL STEP To minimize error in amplifying sgRNAs , it is important to use a high - fidelity polymerase .

Successful reactions should yield a single 370 - bp - long product , and the template should be invisible . ? TROUBLESHOOTING vi Purify the PCR product by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer ' s directions . Elute the DNA in 35 μl of EB buffer ( part of the kit ) or water . ■ PAUSE POINT Purified PCR products can be stored at – 20 °C for up to several months . ( B ) Cloning sgRNA into the pSpCas9 ( BB ) vector for co - expression with Cas9 ● TIMING 3 d i . Preparation of the sgRNA oligos inserts . Resuspend the top and bottom strands of oligos for each sgRNA design ( Step 1 ) to a final concentration of 100 μM . Prepare the following mixture for phosphorylating and annealing the sgRNA oligos ( top and bottom strands ) : Component Amount ( μl ) sgRNA top ( 100 μM ) 1 sgRNA bottom ( 100 μM ) 1 T4 ligation buffer , 10× 1 T4 PNK 1 ddH 2 O 6 Total 10 ii . Phosphorylate and anneal the oligos in a thermocycler by using the following parameters : 37 °C for 30 min ; 95 °C for 5 min ; ramp down to 25 °C at 5 °C min – 1 . iii . Dilute phosphorylated and annealed oligos 1 : 200 by adding 1 μl of oligo to 199 μl of room temperature ddH 2 O . iv . Cloning the sgRNA oligos into pSpCas9 ( BB ) . Set up a ligation reaction for each sgRNA , as described below . We recommend also setting up a no - insert , pSpCas9 ( BB ) - only negative control for ligation . Note : if you are using the Cas9 D10A nickase mutant for subsequent applications , substitute pSpCas9 ( BB ) with pSpCas9n ( BB ) . Alternatively , if fluorescence - based screening or selection is needed , substitute with pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP , pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro , pSpCas9n ( BB ) - 2A - GFP or pSpCas9n ( BB ) - 2A - Puro .

Transform the PlasmidSafe - treated plasmid into a competent E . coli strain , according to the protocol supplied with the cells . We recommend the Stbl3 strain for quick transformation . Briefly , add 2 μl of the product from Step 5B ( vii ) into 20 μl of ice - cold chemically competent Stbl3 cells , incubate the mixture on ice for 10 min , heat - shock it at 42 °C for 30 s and return it immediately to ice for 2 min . Add 100 μl of SOC medium and plate it onto an LB plate containing 100 μg ml – 1 ampicillin . Incubate it overnight at 37 °C . Note that it is not necessary to incubate competent cells for the outgrowth period after heat shock when you are transforming ampicillin - resistant plasmids . ix Day 2 : inspect the plates for colony growth . Typically , there are no colonies on the negative control plates ( ligation of Bbs I - digested pSpCas9 ( BB ) alone without annealed sgRNA oligo insert ) , and there are tens to hundreds of colonies on the pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) ( sgRNA inserted into pSpCas9 ( BB ) ) cloning plates .

TROUBLESHOOTING Functional validation of sgRNAs : HEK 293FT cell culture and transfections ● TIMING 3 – 4 d ▲ CRITICAL The CRISPR - Cas system has been used in a number of mammalian cell lines . Conditions may vary for each cell line . Below we detail transfection conditions for HEK 293FT cells . Note that ssODN - mediated HDR transfections , performed with Amaxa SF cell line Nucleofector kit , are described in Steps 14 – 29 . For hESC ( HUES9 ) culturing and transfection , follow Steps 30 – 53 . 6 HEK 293FT maintenance . Cells are maintained according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations . Cells are cultured in D10 medium supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . 7 To passage , remove the medium and rinse the cells once by gently adding DPBS to the side of the vessel , so as not to dislodge the cells . Add 2 ml of TrypLE to a T75 flask , and incubate the mixture for 5 min at 37 °C . Add 10 ml of warm D10 medium to inactivate the trypsin , and transfer the cells to a 50 - ml Falcon tube . Dissociate the cells by pipetting them up and down gently , and then reseed them into new flasks as necessary . ▲ CRITICAL STEP We typically passage cells every 2 – 3 d at a split ratio of 1 : 4 or 1 : 8 , never allowing cells to reach more than 70 % confluency . Cells are discarded upon reaching passage number 15 . 8 Preparation of cells for transfection . Plate the well - dissociated cells onto 24 - well plates in D10 medium without antibiotics 16 – 24 h before transfection . Seed the cells at a density of 1 . 3 × 10 5 cells per well in a total volume of 500 μl . Scale up or down according to the cell line supplier ' s manual as needed . Ran et al . Page 15 Nat Protoc .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not plate more cells than the recommended density , as doing so may reduce transfection efficiency . 9 On the day of transfection , cells are optimal at 70 – 90 % confluency . Cells can be transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 or the Amaxa SF cell line 4D - Nucleofector X kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Transfections should be performed as follows : for sgRNAs cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) , transfect 500 ng of sequence - verified CRISPR plasmid ( pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) ) ; if you are transfecting more than one plasmid ( Box 2 ) , mix them at equimolar ratios and use no more than 500 ng of total DNA . For sgRNA amplified by PCR , mix the following : pSpCas9 ( Cas9 only ) 400 ng sgRNA amplicon from Step 5A ( each ) 20 ng pUC19 ( carrier DNA ) Fill up total DNA to 500 ng ▲ CRITICAL STEP We recommend transfecting in technical triplicates for reliable quantification , and including transfection controls ( e . g . , GFP plasmid ) to monitor transfection efficiency . pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) - 2A - GFP or pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) - 2A - Puro may be used in place of pSpCas9 if fluorescence sorting or drug selection , respectively , is desired . In addition , the pSpCas9 ( BB ) cloning plasmid and / or the sgRNA amplicon may be transfected alone as a negative control for downstream functional assays . 10 Add Lipofectamine complex to the cells gently , as HEK 293FT cells can detach easily from the plate , which will result in a lower transfection efficiency . 11 Check cells after 24 h for transfection efficiency . The percentage of fluorescent cells in the transfection control ( e . g . , GFP ) can be estimated by using a fluorescence microscope . Typically , more than 70 % of cells are transfected . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 12 Supplement the culture medium with an additional 500 μl of warm D10 medium . ▲ CRITICAL STEP Add D10 very slowly to the side of the well , and do not use cold medium , as cells can detach easily . Puromycin selection can be applied at a concentration of 1 – 3 μg ml – 1 for HEK 293FT cells ( may vary depending on the cell line ) . 13 Incubate the cells for a total of 48 – 72 h after transfection before passaging them for downstream applications or harvesting for indel analysis . Co - transfection of CRISPR plasmids and HDR templates into HEK 293FT cells ( optional ) ● TIMING 3 – 4 d 14 Linearize 1 – 2 μg of targeting vector if possible by cutting once at a restriction site in the vector backbone near one of the homology arms or at the distal end of either homology arm .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Alternatively , if you are using ssODNs , simply resuspend them to a final concentration of 10 μM ( see Step 4 ) and skip Steps 15 and 16 . 15 Run a small amount of the linearized plasmid alongside uncut plasmid on a 0 . 8 – 1 % ( wt / vol ) agarose gel to check for successful linearization . Linearized plasmids should run above the supercoiled plasmid . 16 Purify the linearized plasmid with the QIAQuick PCR Purification kit , and elute in 35 μl of EB buffer . 17 Preparation of cells for transfection . Culture HEK 293FT in T75 or T225 flasks . Plan ahead to have sufficient cells for the day of transfection ( 2 × 10 5 cells per transfection if you are using the Amaxa SF cell line 4D - Nucleofector X kit S ) . 18 Prewarming plates for transfection . Add 1 ml of warm D10 medium into each well of a 12 - well plate . Place the plates in the incubator to keep the medium warm . 19 Use option A in the table below for preparing the co - transfection of the HDR targeting plasmid with the Cas9 plasmid or option B for the co - transfection of ssODN with the Cas9 plasmid . To prepare transfection controls , see Step 9 . If an sgRNA is cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP , cells may also be sorted by fluorescence . If you are using Cas9 nickase to mediate HDR , substitute pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) with pSpCas9n ( sgRNA ) from Step 5B ( v ) . ▲ CRITICAL STEP For HDR applications , we recommend cloning sgRNA guides into one of the sgRNA expression plasmids described in Step 5B , rather than using the PCR - based expression approach . ( A ) For the cotransfection of the HDR - targeting plasmid with the Cas9 plasmid : ( i ) Pre - mix the following DNA in PCR tubes : Cas9 plasmid ( pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) ) 500 ng Linearized targeting plasmid 500 ng ( B ) For the cotransfection of ss0DN and with the Cas9 plasmid : ( i ) Pre - mix the following DNA in PCR tubes : Cas9 plasmid ( pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) ) 500 ng ssODN template ( 10 μM ) 1 μl 20 Dissociation of cells for transfection . Remove the medium and rinse the cells once gently with DPBS , taking care not to dislodge cells . Add 2 ml of TrypLE to a T75 flask and incubate it for 5 min at 37 °C , and then add 10 ml of warm D10 medium and triturate gently in a 50 - ml Falcon tube . ▲ CRITICAL STEP Ensure that the cells are triturated gently and dissociated to single cells . Large clumps will reduce transfection efficiency . 21 Take a 10 - μl aliquot from the cell suspension and dilute it into 90 μl of D10 medium for counting . Count the cells and calculate the number of cells and the Ran et al . Page 17 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t volume of suspension needed for transfection . We typically transfect 2 × 10 5 cells per condition with the Amaxa SF cell line 4D - Nucleofector X kit S , and we recommend calculating for 20 % more cells than required to adjust for volume loss in subsequent pipetting steps . Transfer the volume needed ( 20 μl per transfection plus waste volume ) into a new Falcon tube . 22 Spin down the cells from Step 21 at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature . 23 Prepare the transfection solution by mixing the SF solution and S1 supplement supplied in the Amaxa SF cell line 4D - Nucleofector X kit S ; a total of 20 μl of supplemented SF solution is used per transfection . Likewise , we recommend calculating for 20 % more volume than required . 24 Remove the medium completely from the pelleted cells from Step 22 , and gently resuspend the cells in an appropriate volume ( 20 μl per 2 × 10 5 cells ) of S1 - supplemented SF solution . Do not leave the cells in SF solution for extended periods of time . 25 Pipette 20 μl of resuspended cells into each DNA premix from Step 19 . Pipette gently to mix and transfer to a Nucleocuvette strip chamber . Repeat this step for each transfection condition . 26 Electroporate the cells by using the Nucleofector 4D program recommended by Amaxa , CM - 130 . 27 Gently and slowly pipette 100 μl of warm D10 medium into each Nucleocuvette strip chamber , and transfer all the volume into a well with the prewarmed medium from Step 18 . ▲ CRITICAL STEP Cells are very fragile at this stage , and harsh pipetting can cause cell death . 28 Incubate the mixture for 24 h . At this point , transfection efficiency can be estimated from the fraction of fluorescent cells in the positive transfection control . Nucleofection typically results in > 70 – 80 % transfection efficiency . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 29 Slowly add 1 ml of warm D10 medium to each well without dislodging the cells . Puromycin selection can be applied at a concentration of 1 – 3 μg ml – 1 for HEK 293FT cells ( may vary depending on the cell line ) . Incubate the cells with puromycin for at least 72 h . Cells can then be cultured in regular medium for downstream experiments or harvested for genotyping . hESC ( HUES 9 ) culture and transfection ● TIMING 3 – 4 d ▲ CRITICAL hESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells can vary widely in their transfection efficiency , tolerance of single - cell dissociation and maintenance conditions . For a given cell line of interest , relevant literature or the distributor should be consulted . 30 Maintaining HUES9 cells . We routinely maintain HUES9 cells ( a hESC cell line ) in feeder - free conditions with mTesR1 medium . Prepare mTeSR1 medium Ran et al . Page 18 Nat Protoc .

Dilute cold GelTrex 1 : 100 in cold DMEM and coat the entire surface of a 100 - mm tissue culture plate . 33 Place the plate in an incubator for at least 30 min at 37 °C . 34 Thaw a vial of cells at 37 °C , transfer the cells to a 15 - ml Falcon tube , add 5 ml of mTeSR1 medium and pellet at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature . 35 Aspirate the GelTrex coating ( Step 32 ) and seed ~ 1 × 10 6 cells with 10 ml of mTeSR1 medium containing ROCK inhibitor from Step 31 . 36 Replace with mTeSR1 medium without ROCK inhibitor after 24 h and refeed daily . 37 Passaging cells . Passage the cells before they reach 70 % confluency . 38 Aspirate the mTeSR1 medium and wash the cells once with DPBS . 39 Dissociate the cells by adding 2 ml of Accutase and incubating them at 37 °C for 3 – 5 min . 40 Add 10 ml of mTeSR1 medium to the detached cells , transfer the mixture to a 15 - ml Falcon tube and resuspend gently . 41 Replate the cells onto GelTrex - coated plates in mTeSR1 medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor . 42 Replace with normal mTeSR1 medium 24 h after plating . 43 Transfection . We recommend culturing cells for at least 1 week after thawing and before transfecting by using the Amaxa P3 primary cell 4D Nucleofector kit . 44 Refeed log - phase growing cells ( 50 – 70 % confluency ) with fresh medium 2 h before transfection . 45 Dissociate to single cells or small clusters of no more than ten cells ( as viewed under the microscope ) with Accutase and gentle resuspension . 46 Count the number of cells needed for nucleofection ( 200 , 000 cells per transfection ) and spin down at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature . 47 Remove the medium completely and resuspend it in 20 μl of S1 - supplemented P3 nucleofection solution , per 2 × 10 5 cells . 48 Pipette the resuspended cells with added DNA ( Steps 9 and 19 ) into electroporation cuvettes and electroporate according to the suggested program . For 2 × 10 5 cells , we typically use 1 μg of total DNA . Ran et al . Page 19 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

Puromycin selection can be applied at a concentration of 0 . 5 μg ml – 1 ( may vary depending on the cell line ) . Typically , we observe > 70 % transfection efficiency with Amaxa nucleofection . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 51 At 48 – 72 h post transfection , dissociate the cells with Accutase and resuspend them gently in a 5× volume of mTeSR1 . Reserve a fraction of the resuspended cells at this stage for replating ( Steps 41 and 42 ; make sure to add ROCK inhibitor for each passaging ) , for downstream applications or clonal isolation ( Steps 54 – 70 ) , and use the remaining cells for genotyping ( Steps 71 – 126 ) . ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not dissociate the cells mechanically without Accutase . 52 Spin the cells down at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature . ▲ CRITICAL STEP Do not spin the cells without inactivating the Accutase first , or above the recommended speed ; doing so may cause cells to lyse . 53 Process pelleted cells directly for DNA extraction with the QuickExtract solution ( Steps 71 – 74 ) . Isolation of clonal cell lines by FACS ● TIMING 2 – 3 h hands - on ; 2 – 3 weeks expansion ▲ CRITICAL Isolation of clonal cell populations from the transfected cells ( Step 51 ) can be performed 24 h after transfection by FACS ( Steps 54 – 65 ) or by serial dilutions ( Steps 66 – 70 ) . Given that cell types can vary greatly in their response to FACS , clonal - density dilution or other isolation procedures , literature specific to the cell type of interest should be consulted . 54 Preparation of FACS media . Cells can be sorted in regular D10 medium supplemented with penicillin - streptomycin . The antibiotics - containing medium should be filtered through a 0 . 22 - μM Steriflip filter . If fluorescence sorting is also required , phenol red – free DMEM or DPBS is substituted for normal DMEM . 55 To 96 - well plates , add 100 μl of D10 medium supplemented with penicillin - streptomycin per well . ▲ CRITICAL STEP Not all sorted cells may survive the FACS process or the subsequent outgrowth ; therefore , the number of plates prepared and cells sorted may need to be adjusted to ensure an adequate number of clonal lines derived . 56 Preparation of cells for FACS . Dissociate the cells ( from Steps 11 or 28 ) by aspirating the medium completely and adding enough TrypLE to thinly cover the adherent layer of transfected cells . Incubate the mixture for 5 min at 37 °C and add 400 μl of warm D10 medium . Ran et al . Page 20 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

Place the cells on ice until sorting . 61 Sort single cells into the 96 - well plates prepared from Step 55 . If sgRNA is cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP , fluorescence may be used to enrich for transfected cells . After sorting , examine the plate under a microscope and determine the presence of a single cell in most of the wells on the plate . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 62 Return the cells to the incubator and allow them to expand for 2 – 3 weeks . Add 100 μl of warm D10 medium 5 d after sorting . Change 100 μl of the medium every 3 – 5 d as necessary . 63 Inspect the colonies for “clonal” appearance 1 week after sorting : rounded colonies radiating from a central point . Mark off the wells that are empty or that may have been seeded more than a single cell . 64 When the cells are more than 60 % confluent , prepare replica plates for passaging ( one well for each clone ) by adding 100 μl of D10 medium to each well in the replica plates . Dissociate the cells directly by pipetting up and down vigorously 20 times , and plate 20 % of each of the resuspended volumes into the replica wells to keep the clonal lines . Change the medium every 2 – 3 d thereafter and passage accordingly . 65 Use the remaining 80 % of cells for DNA isolation and genotyping ( Steps 71 – 74 ) . Isolation of clonal cell lines by dilution ● TIMING 2 – 3 h hands - on ; 2 – 3 weeks expansion ▲ CRITICAL As cell types can vary greatly in their response to FACS , clonal - density dilution or other isolation procedures , literature specific to the cell type of interest should be consulted . 66 Dissociate the cells from the transfected wells ( Steps 11 or 28 ) 48 h after transfection . Take care to dissociate to single cells . A cell strainer ( Step 60 ) can be used to prevent clumping of cells . 67 Count the number of cells from each 24 - well plate , and serially dilute them in D10 medium to a final concentration of 0 . 5 cells per 100 μl to reduce the likelihood of having multiple cells per well . We recommend using 60 cells in 12 ml of D10 medium for each 96 - well plate , and plating at least two 96 - well plates for each transfected population . Ran et al . Page 21 Nat Protoc .

We recommend examining the dissociated cells under a microscope to ensure successful dissociation and recounting cells at an intermediate serial dilution stage to ensure accuracy . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 68 Multichannel - pipette 100 μl of diluted cells to each well of a 96 - well plate . The remaining cell suspension can be kept and used for genotyping at the population level to gauge overall modification efficiency . 69 Inspect the colonies for a clonal appearance ~ 1 week after plating ( rounded colonies radiating from a central point ) . Mark off the wells that may have been seeded with multiple cells . 70 Return the cells to the incubator and allow them to expand for 2 – 3 weeks . Refeed and replica - plate the cells as needed and as detailed in Steps 64 and 65 . Functional testing : detection of indel mutations by the SURVEYOR nuclease assay ● TIMING 5 – 6 h ▲ CRITICAL Before assaying the cleavage efficiency of transfected cells , we recommend testing each new SURVEYOR primer on negative ( untransfected ) control samples for the intended cell type by SURVEYOR nuclease digestion . 71 Harvesting cells for DNA extraction . Dissociate all transfected cells ( from Steps 13 , 29 , 53 , 65 or 70 ) and spin them down at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature . Keep the replica plates as needed to maintain transfected cell lines in culture . 72 Aspirate the medium completely . 73 For DNA extraction , use the QuickExtract solution according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . We typically use 50 μl or 10 μl of the solution for each well of a 24 - well or 96 - well plate , respectively . 74 Normalize the extracted DNA to a final concentration of 100 – 200 ng μl – 1 with ddH 2 O . ■ PAUSE POINT Extracted DNA can be stored at – 20 °C for several months . 75 Setting up the SURVEYOR PCR .

Other high - fidelity polymerases , such as PfuUltra ( Agilent ) or Kapa HiFi ( Kapa Biosystems ) , may be used as a substitute . In addition , because SURVEYOR cleavage results can detect naturally occurring single - nucleotide polymorphisms , it is important to run negative control samples of untransfected or otherwise unmodified cells . 76 Perform a PCR with the following cycling conditions , for no more than 30 amplification cycles : Cycle number Denature Anneal Extend 1 95 °C , 2 min 2 - 31 95 °C , 20 s 60 °C , 20 s 72 °C , 30 s 32 72 °C , 3 min 77 Run 2 – 5 μl of the PCR products on a 1 % ( wt / vol ) agarose gel to check for single - band products .

SURVEYOR nuclease digestion products can be visualized on a 2 % ( wt / vol ) agarose gel . For better resolution , products can be run on a 4 – 20 % gradient polyacrylamide TBE gel . Load 10 μl of the product with the recommended loading buffer and run the gel according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Typically , we run the gel until the bromophenol blue dye has migrated to the bottom of the gel . Include the DNA ladder and negative ( untransfected ) controls on the same gel . 85 Stain the gel with SYBR Gold dye diluted 1 : 10 , 000 in TBE ( 20 μl of stock in 200 ml of TBE ) . Rock the gel gently for 15 min . Be sure to shield the staining solution from light to avoid photobleaching of the dye . 86 Image the gel by using a quantitative imaging system without overexposing the bands . The negative controls should have only one band corresponding to the size of the PCR product , but they may have occasional nonspecific cleavage bands of other sizes . These will not interfere with analysis if they are distinct in size from the target cleavage bands . The sum of target cleavage band sizes , provided by the CRISPR Design Tool , should be equal to the size of the PCR product . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 87 Estimation of the cleavage intensity . Measure the integrated intensity of the PCR amplicon and cleaved bands by using ImageLab , ImageJ or other gel quantification software . 88 For each lane , calculate the fraction of the PCR product cleaved ( f cut ) by using the following formula : f cut = ( b + c ) / ( a + b + c ) , where a is the integrated intensity of the undigested PCR product and b and c are the integrated intensities of each cleavage product . A sample gel is shown in Figure 6 . 89 Indel occurrence can be estimated with the following formula , based on the binomial probability distribution of duplex formation : Functional testing : detection of genomic microdeletions by PCR ● TIMING 3 – 4 h hands - on ; 2 – 3 weeks expansion 90 Transfect the cells as described in Steps 8 – 13 or Steps 43 – 51 with a pair of sgRNAs flanking the region to be deleted . 91 At 24 h after transfection , isolate the clones by FACS or by serial dilution as described above ( Steps 54 – 70 ) . 92 Expand the cells for 2 – 3 weeks . 93 Extract the DNA from clonal lines as described above ( Steps 71 – 74 ) by using 10 μl of QuickExtract solution , and normalize the genomic DNA with ddH 2 O to a final concentration of 100 ng μl – 1 .

CRISPR - Cas can be easily multiplexed to facilitate high - efficiency genome editing in mammalian cells : by using two sgRNAs , we were able to demonstrate simultaneous targeting of the human DYRK1A and GRIN2B loci at efficiencies of 65 – 68 % for each locus in HEK 293FT cells ( Fig . 5b ) . Likewise , a pair of sgRNAs can be used to mediate microdeletions , such as excision of EMX1 exon 3 , which we genotyped by PCR at a clonal level ( Fig . 5c ) . Note that the precise location of exon junctions can vary . We also demonstrate here the use of ssODNs and targeting vector to mediate HDR ( Fig . 6a , b ) with both WT and the D10A nickase mutant of Cas9 in HEK 293FT and HUES9 cells ( Fig . 6c ) . Note that we have not been able to detect HDR in HUES9 cells by using Cas9n with a sgRNA , which may be due to low efficiency or a potential difference in repair activities in HUES9 cells . The state of ploidy of the cell type of interest may also affect modification efficiency . However , Cas9n may be paired with two sgRNAs to mediate a DSB and stimulate HDR in HUES9 cells .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Box 1 | Considerations for off - target cleavage activities Similarly to other nucleases , Cas9 can cleave off - target DNA targets in the genome at reduced frequencies 51 , 52 , 61 . The extent to which a given guide sequence exhibits off - target activity depends on a combination of factors including enzyme concentration and the abundance of similar sequences in the target genome . For routine application of Cas9 , it is important to consider ways to minimize the degree of off - target cleavage and also to be able to detect the presence of off - target cleavage 51 , 52 , 61 . Minimizing off - target activity . For application in cell lines , we recommend following two steps to reduce the degree of off - target genome modification . First , by using our online CRISPR Design Tool , it is possible to computationally assess the likelihood of a given guide sequence to have off - target sites . These analyses are performed through an exhaustive search in the genome for off - target sequences that are similar to the guide sequence . Comprehensive experimental investigation of the effect of mismatching bases between the sgRNA and its target DNA revealed that mismatch tolerance is ( i ) position dependent : the 8 – 14 bp on the 3 ′ end of the guide sequence is less tolerant of mismatches than the 5 ′ bases ; ( ii ) quantity dependent : in general , more than three mismatches are not tolerated ; ( iii ) guide sequence dependent : some guide sequences are less tolerant of mismatches than others ; and ( iv ) concentration dependent : off - target cleavage is highly sensitive to the transfected amounts , as well as relative ratios of Cas9 and sgRNA 51 . As shown in the illustration ( adapted with permission from ref . 51 ; error bars show s . e . m . ( n = 3 ) ) , Cas9 can exhibit off - target cleavage in the genome , which may be minimized by carefully titrating the amount of pSpCas9 DNA transfected . The CRISPR Design Tool integrates these criteria to provide predictions for likely off - target sites in the target genome . We also recommend titrating the amount of Cas9 and sgRNA expression plasmid to minimize off - target activity . Detection of off - target activities . We have found experimentally that Cas9 can cleave at genomic off - target sites with either 5 ′ - NGG or 5 ′ - NAG PAMs . By using our CRISPR - targeting web tool , it is possible to generate a list of the most likely off - target sites , as well as primers for performing SURVEYOR or sequencing analysis of those sites . For isogenic clones generated using Cas9 , we strongly recommend sequencing candidate off - target sites to check for any undesired mutations . It is worth noting that there may be off - target modifications in sites that are not included in the predicted candidate list , and full genome sequencing should be performed to completely verify the absence of off - target sites . Furthermore , in multiplex assays where several DSBs are induced within the same genome , there may be low rates of translocation events and they can be evaluated by using a variety of techniques such as deep sequencing 62 .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Box 2 | Double - nicking strategy for minimizing off - target mutagenesis To minimize off - target activity , a double nicking strategy can be used to introduce DSBs at the target site 43 . Whereas the WT Cas9 nuclease is guided by an sgRNA to mediate a DSB at the target locus , the D10A mutant Cas9 nickase ( Cas9n ) can be specified by a pair of appropriately spaced and oriented sgRNAs to simultaneously introduce single - stranded nicks on both strands of the target DNA . The DSBs from double nicking are then repaired via NHEJ and result in indel formation with similar levels of efficiency to that of WT Cas9 . As single - stranded nicks are repaired without indel formation , DSBs would only occur if both sgRNAs are able to locate target sequences within a defined space . Thus , this strategy effectively doubles the number of bases that need to be specifically recognized at the target site and significantly increases the specificity of genome editing . To facilitate efficient double nicking , the pair of sgRNAs must be designed such that 5 ′ overhangs are generated upon nicking . The target loci for the sgRNA pairs must also be offset with an optimal gap of 0 – 20 bp ( see illustration : target DNA loci , blue N ′ s ; PAM , pink ; predicted cleavage sites on each strand , red triangles ) 43 . The expression constructs for sgRNA pairs can be prepared by the PCR - based method as described for sgRNAs ( Step 5A ) . The sgRNAs can then be combined at 1 : 1 ratio and introduced along with Cas9n by using identical procedures as for WT Cas9 and sgRNAs ( Step 9 , 20 ng for each sgRNA ) . Editing achieved by using this double - nicking strategy can be similarly detected using SURVEYOR assay or DNA sequencing . In addition to facilitating DSB - and NHEJ - mediated mutagenesis , double nicking can also be used to promote HDR with comparable efficiency as WT Cas9 .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Box 3 | Frequently asked questions from the CRISPR Discussion Forum The following questions are selected from the CRISPR Discussion Forum ( discuss . genome - engineering . org ) . Q1 : Should I use crRNA + tracrRNA or sgRNA ? Although we initially reported that sgRNAs with a truncated tracrRNA 3 ′ tail , sgRNA ( + 48 ) , are less effective for gene targeting in mammalian cells than using crRNA and tracrRNA pairs 22 , we have optimized the sgRNA architecture by extending its tracrRNA tail . sgRNA ( + 85 ) , used in pSpCas9 vectors , is able to mediate the highest efficiency of genome modification 57 . Q2 : My 20 - bp target site does not start with G ; can I replace the first base with G ? For efficient U6 transcription of sgRNA , a G is preferred at the 5 ′ position , which corresponds with the first base of the 20 - bp guide sequence . For guide sequences that do not begin with a G , we recommend adding an additional G to the 5 ′ of the guide sequence , resulting in a 21 - bp guide sequence ( 5 ′ - GNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN - 3 ′ , where the 20 Ns correspond to the 20 - bp genomic target sequence immediately upstream of the 5 ′ - NGG PAM ) . The addition of a 5 ′ G does not alter the specificity of the sgRNA or affect the efficiency of Cas9 cleavage . Q3 : Should I include the PAM sequence in my sgRNA ? No , the PAM sequence should not be included as a part of the sgRNA . The PAM sequence is located in the genomic target site , immediately following the 20 - bp target sequence , but it is not a part of the sgRNA . Only the 20 - bp target sequence is used to construct the sgRNA . For S . pyogenes Cas9 , the PAM sequence is 5 ′ - NGG . Q4 : Which one is more efficient for mediating HDR , WT Cas9 or Cas9 nickase ? WT Cas9 is more efficient at mediating homologous recombination than Cas9 nickase . The efficiency of HDR mediated by Cas9 nickase is highly dependent on the cell type . Although Cas9 nickase can reduce the risk for off - target activity , we suggest testing both WT Cas9 and Cas9 nickase when performing gene targeting experiments . Q5 : Does the CBh promoter in pSpCas9 work in my cell line ? The CBh promoter is an altered version of the CAG promoter 69 , and we have validated it in the following cell lines : HEK 293FT , human ESCs , mouse ESCs , HepG2 , HeLa and Neuro 2a . For other cell lines , we recommend testing Cas9 expression by using pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP and checking for green fluorescence , or staining for Cas9 expression using antibodies against the 3× FLAG epitope that has been fused to the N - term of Cas9 . Q6 : Which method of sgRNA expression is more effective , PCR - generated U6 - sgRNA expression cassette or pSpCas9 plasmid carrying the appropriate sgRNA ? We have found that the use of pSpCas9 plasmid often results in higher cleavage efficiency . The use of PCR - generated U6 - sgRNA expression cassettes allows easy and Ran et al . Page 39 Nat Protoc .

Q7 : Can the HDR template ( plasmid or ssODN ) contain the sgRNA target site ? We have found that it is possible to achieve HDR by using both plasmids and ssODNs that contain the target site . However , single bases can be silently mutated to prevent cleavage of the templates . Ran et al . Page 40 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

The Cas9 nuclease from S . pyogenes ( in yellow ) is targeted to genomic DNA ( shown for example is the human EMX1 locus ) by an sgRNA consisting of a 20 - nt guide sequence ( blue ) and a scaffold ( red ) . The guide sequence pairs with the DNA target ( blue bar on top strand ) , directly upstream of a requisite 5 ′ - NGG adjacent motif ( PAM ; pink ) . Cas9 mediates a DSB ~ 3 bp upstream of the PAM ( red triangle ) . Ran et al . Page 41 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

DSBs induced by Cas9 ( yellow ) can be repaired in one of two ways . In the error - prone NHEJ pathway , the ends of a DSB are processed by endogenous DNA repair machinery and rejoined , which can result in random indel mutations at the site of junction . Indel mutations occurring within the coding region of a gene can result in frameshifts and the creation of a premature stop codon , resulting in gene knockout . Alternatively , a repair template in the form of a plasmid or ssODN can be supplied to leverage the HDR pathway , which allows high fidelity and precise editing . Single - stranded nicks to the DNA can also induce HDR . Ran et al . Page 42 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

Steps for reagent design , construction , validation and cell line expansion are depicted . Custom sgRNAs ( light blue bars ) for each target , as well as genotyping primers , are designed in silico via the CRISPR Design Tool ( http : / / tools . genome - engineering . org ) . sgRNA guide sequences can be cloned into an expression plasmid bearing both sgRNA scaffold backbone ( BB ) and Cas9 , pSpCas9 ( BB ) . The resulting plasmid is annotated as pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) . Completed and sequence - verified pSpCas9 ( sgRNA ) plasmids and optional repair templates for facilitating HDR are then transfected into cells and assayed for their ability to mediate targeted cleavage . Finally , transfected cells can be clonally expanded to derive isogenic cell lines with defined mutations . Ran et al . Page 43 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Figure 4 . Target selection and reagent preparation . ( a ) For S . pyogenes Cas9 , 20 - bp targets ( highlighted in blue ) must be followed at their 3 ′ ends by 5 ′ - NGG , which can occur in either the top or the bottom strand of genomic DNA , as in the example from the human EMX1 gene . We recommend using the CRISPR Design Tool ( http : / / tools . genome - engineering . org ) to facilitate target selection . ( b ) Schematic for co - transfection of the Cas9 expression plasmid ( pSpCas9 ) and a PCR - amplified U6 - driven sgRNA expression cassette . By using a U6 promoter - containing PCR template and a fixed forward primer ( U6 - Fwd ) , sgRNA - encoding DNA can be appended onto the U6 reverse primer ( U6 - Rev ) and synthesized as an extended DNA oligo ( Ultramer oligos from IDT ) . Note that the guide sequence in the U6 - Rev primer , designed against an example target from the top strand ( blue ) , is the reverse complement of the 20 - bp target sequence preceding the 5 ′ - NGG PAM . An additional cytosine ( ‘C’ in gray rectangle ) is appended in the reverse primer directly 3 ′ to the target sequence to allow guanine as the first base of the U6 transcript . ( c ) Schematic for scarless cloning of the guide sequence oligos into a plasmid containing Cas9 and the sgRNA scaffold ( pSpCas9 ( BB ) ) . The guide oligos for the top strand example ( blue ) contain overhangs for ligation into the pair of BbsI sites in pSpCas9 ( BB ) , with the top and bottom strand orientations matching those of the genomic target ( i . e . , the top oligo is the 20 - bp sequence preceding 5 ′ - NGG in genomic DNA ) . Digestion of pSpCas9 ( BB ) with BbsI allows the replacement of the Type II restriction sites ( blue outline ) with direct insertion of annealed oligos . Likewise , a G - C base pair ( gray rectangle ) is added at the 5 ′ end of the guide sequence for U6 transcription , which does not adversely affect targeting efficiency . Alternate versions of pSpCas9 ( BB ) also contain markers such as GFP or a puromycin resistance gene to aid the selection of transfected cells . Ran et al . Page 44 Nat Protoc .

Anticipated results for multiplex - sgRNA - targeted NHEJ . ( a ) Schematic of the SURVEYOR assay used to determine the indel percentage . First , genomic DNA from the heterogeneous population of Cas9 - targeted cells is amplified by PCR . Amplicons are then reannealed slowly to generate heteroduplexes . The reannealed heteroduplexes are cleaved by SURVEYOR nuclease , whereas homoduplexes are left intact . Cas9 - mediated cleavage efficiency ( percentage indel ) is calculated on the basis of the fraction of cleaved DNA , as determined by integrated intensity of gel bands . ( b ) Two sgRNAs ( orange and dark blue bars ) are designed to target the human GRIN2B and DYRK1A loci . SURVEYOR gel shows modification at both loci in transfected cells .

( c ) Paired sgRNAs ( light blue and green bars ) are designed to excise an exon ( dark blue ) in the human EMX1 locus . Target sequences and PAMs ( pink ) are shown in respective colors , and sites of cleavage by Cas9 are indicated by red triangles . A predicted junction is shown below . Individual clones isolated from cell populations transfected with sgRNA 3 , 4 or both are assayed by PCR ( using the Out - Fwd and Out - Rev primers ) , reflecting a deletion of ~ 270 bp long . Representative clones with no modification ( 12 / 23 ) , mono - allelic modification ( 10 / 23 ) and bi - allelic ( 1 / 23 ) modification are shown . ( d ) Quantification of clonal lines with EMX1 exon deletions . Two pairs of sgRNAs ( 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 , left - flanking sgRNAs ; 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 , right flanking sgRNAs ) are used to mediate deletions of various sizes around one EMX1 exon . Transfected cells are clonally isolated and expanded for genotyping analysis of deletions and inversion events . Of the 105 clones screened , 51 ( 49 % ) and 12 ( 11 % ) are carrying heterozygous and homozygous deletions , respectively . Only approximate deletion sizes are given , as deletion junctions may be variable . Ran et al . Page 46 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

( a ) Either a targeting plasmid or an ssODN ( sense or antisense ) with homology arms can be used to edit the sequence at a target genomic locus cleaved by Cas9 ( red triangle ) . To assay the efficiency of HDR , we introduced a HindIII site ( red bar ) into the target locus , which was PCR - amplified with primers that anneal outside of the region of homology . Digestion of the PCR product with HindIII reveals the occurrence of HDR events . ( b ) ssODNs , oriented in either the sense or the antisense ( s or a ) direction relative to the locus of interest , can be used in combination with Cas9 to achieve efficient HDR - mediated editing at the target locus . A minimal homology region of 40 bp , and preferably 90 bp , is recommended on either side of the modification ( red bar ) . ( c ) Example of the effect of ssODNs on HDR in the EMX1 locus is shown using both wild - type Cas9 and Cas9 nickase ( D10A ) . Each ssODN contains homology arms of 90 bp flanking a 12 - bp insertion of two restriction sites . Ran et al . Page 47 Nat Protoc . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .
