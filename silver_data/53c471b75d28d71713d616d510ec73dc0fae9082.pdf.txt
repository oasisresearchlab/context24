Self - propelled deformable particle model for keratocyte galvanotaxis Ifunanya Nwogbaga 1 and Brian A . Camley 1 , 2 1 Department of Biophysics , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD 21218 2 Department of Physics & Astronomy , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD 21218 During wound healing , ﬁsh keratocyte cells undergo galvanotaxis where they follow a wound - induced electric ﬁeld . In addition to their stereotypical persistent motion , keratocytes can develop circular motion without a ﬁeld or oscillate around the ﬁeld direction . We developed a coarse - grained phenomenological model that captures these keratocyte behaviors . We ﬁt this model to experimental data on keratocyte response to an electric ﬁeld being turned on . A critical element of our model is a tendency for cells to turn toward their long axis , arising from a coupling between cell shape and velocity , which gives rise to oscillatory and circular motion . Galvanotaxis is inﬂuenced not only by the ﬁeld - dependent responses , but also cell speed and cell shape relaxation rate . When the cell reacts to an electric ﬁeld being turned on , our model predicts that stiﬀ , slow cells react slowly but follow the signal reliably . Cells that polarize and align to the ﬁeld at a faster rate react more quickly and follow the signal more reliably . When cells are exposed to a ﬁeld that switches direction rapidly , cells follow the average of ﬁeld directions , while if the ﬁeld is switched more slowly , cells follow a “staircase” pattern . I . INTRODUCTION Directed cell migration is necessary for processes like wound healing , immune response , and developmental bi - ology [ 1 ] . In healing wounds , epidermal keratocyte cells in ﬁsh and amphibians can follow electrical ﬁelds [ 2 – 4 ] . It has been known since the 19 th century that skin wounds generate electric ﬁelds [ 5 , 6 ] . In vivo , injuries are be - lieved to create changes in the ionic content , altering the transepithelial potential [ 7 , 8 ] and subsequently leading to electric ﬁelds and migration [ 9 ] . In vitro , many sin - gle cells also have strong directional response to electric ﬁelds . Dictyostelium discoideum , human mesenchymal stem cells , ﬁbroblasts , and keratocytes in electric ﬁelds typically migrate towards the cathode [ 8 , 10 – 14 ] . Kerato - cytes in particular are relatively geometrically simple and have become a useful model system for cell motility in re - sponse to electric ﬁelds [ 15 – 18 ] . Interestingly , in addition to their stereotyped persistent motility , keratocytes also display spontaneous circular motion , a persistent turn - ing driven by asymmetries in traction forces and myosin contractility at the rear of the cell [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] . This behavior is also seen in detailed molecular models resolv - ing cell shape and polarity [ 15 – 17 , 19 , 20 ] and emerges from self - propelled deformable particle models [ 21 ] . In the presence of a ﬁeld , keratocytes may oscillate around the ﬁeld direction [ 22 ] . The molecular details of galvanotaxis in keratocytes are not yet clear . There is evidence that galvanotaxis is driven by electrophoresis of mobile , charged transmem - brane proteins [ 18 , 22 , 23 ] , but the speciﬁc protein species acting as a sensor is unknown . In addition , the details of how this spatial asymmetry on the cell surface leads to initiation of the downstream signaling cues and migra - tion are not fully understood . Despite this uncertainty , it is clear that electric ﬁelds are a key cue in wound heal - ing , overriding other signals [ 9 , 24 ] . As the study of di - rected motion in electric ﬁelds is expanded to the study of groups of cells [ 25 – 31 ] , there is a need for phenomenologi - cal models that can quantitatively describe galvanotaxis . We developed a stochastic model of single - cell galvan - otaxis describing the cell as a self - propelled deformable particle [ 21 , 32 – 35 ] , tracking the cell’s shape and velocity . Experimentally , cell shape plays a key role in motility . A cell’s shape aﬀects the traction forces it applies to the surface , subsequently aﬀecting its motility [ 36 ] . Kerato - cytes adopt diﬀerent morphologies for migrating forward versus making turns [ 17 ] . We therefore include a cou - pling between the cell’s velocity and its shape to allow the shape to aﬀect motility ; this coupling is known to create circular motion [ 21 ] . In addition , we introduce a polarity angle to indicate the underlying biochemical po - larization of the cell – the “compass” that responds to the electric ﬁelds . This polarity is then coupled with the cell’s velocity . We show using linear stability analysis that , as in [ 21 ] , this model has regimes where persistent linear crawling by the cell is stable , and others where more complex behaviors like circular motion arise . We ﬁt this model to the data of [ 22 ] studying how keratocyte directionality responds to an activated ﬁeld . We then use these parameters to show how the cell’s directionality de - pends on features like cell speed and the rate its shape relaxes to equilibrium . Finally , we show that the cell’s rate of response to a switched - on electric ﬁeld also can inﬂuence its response to rapidly - switched ﬁelds , where cells may reliably follow each ﬁeld direction , follow the average of the ﬁelds , or develop a more complex behavior , depending on the cell’s parameters . II . MODEL Our model includes four key variables to represent the state and motion of a keratocyte : shape ( characterized by a tensor S αβ ) , center of mass r ( t ) , velocity v = d r d t , and a internal polarity direction ˆ p ( Fig . 1 ) . The symmetric traceless shape tensor S αβ [ 21 ] captures a r X i v : 2 2 04 . 01589v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 4 A p r 2022 2 θ R 0 - s / 2 R 0 + s / 2 s = 0 p v s > 0 R 0 FIG . 1 : Cells are modeled as deformable ellipses ( left ) , with a velocity v , an underlying biochemical polarity unit vector ˆ p , Their orientation is characterized by a angle from the ˆx - axis , θ . Cells begin as circular ( right ) with radius R 0 . They can deform to ellipses with semi - major and semi - minor axes lengths of R 0 ± s / 2 . s controls eccentricity , with s = 0 denoting no deformation from a circle . the extent of deformation from a circle , s ( t ) , and the orientation of the cell’s long axis , θ ( t ) , S αβ = s (cid:18) n α n β − 1 2 δ αβ (cid:19) , ( 1 ) where δ αβ is the Kronecker delta and ˆn ( t ) = ( cos θ , sin θ ) points along the long axis of the cell ( Fig . 1 ) . Here , s ( t ) is a nonnegative number that describes the degree of deformation . s = 0 is a circular cell while increasing s increases cell eccentricity . The eigenvalues of S αβ are ± s / 2 . We draw cells with a deformation s as being an ellipse with the length of the semi - major and minor axes given by A = R 0 + s / 2 and B = R 0 − s / 2 , where R 0 is the radius the cell would have if it were circular ( Fig . 1 ) . We chose the deviation s / 2 to be consistent with the deﬁnition of s in the Fourier mode representation of [ 34 ] . Our model’s dynamics for S αβ , v , and ˆ p are given in Eqs . ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) and shown schematically in Fig . 2 . The cell’s velocity obeys : d v d t = µ ( γ − | v | 2 ) v − a S (cid:126) (cid:126) · v − χ | v | v × ( v × ˆp ) + σξ ( t ) ˆv ⊥ . ( 2 ) The ﬁrst two terms on the right hand side are from [ 21 ] . The ﬁrst term describes the cell’s self - propulsion , which will ( in the absence of other eﬀects ) drive the cell’s speed to √ γ . The second term on the right hand side shows how the velocity responds to cell shape : if a < 0 ( which is true everywhere in this paper ) , velocities along the cell’s major axis will increase , and velocities along the cell’s minor axis will decrease , leading the velocity to align to ± ˆ n ( see Appendix A ) . The third term’s triple cross product ( a la [ 37 ] ) shows a rotation of velocity to come into alignment with the cell’s polarity – i . e . that the cell tries to move along its direction of internal biochemical polarity . This term is essential for galvanotaxis , as we assume the electric ﬁeld alters the polarity ˆ p . The last term on the right is a rotational noise : ξ ( t ) is a Gaussian Langevin noise with (cid:104) ξ ( t ) (cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104) ξ ( t 1 ) ξ ( t 2 ) (cid:105) = δ ( t 1 − t 2 ) . ˆv ⊥ is a unit vector perpendicular to v . Cell shape S αβ obeys , following [ 21 ] exactly : d S αβ d t = − κS αβ − b (cid:18) v α v β − 1 2 v 2 δ αβ (cid:19) . ( 3 ) The ﬁrst term in this equation informs us that elongated shapes tend to relax back to a circular shape with a rate κ – similar to the role of cell tension in [ 16 ] . The second term on the right of Eq . 3 models cell shape responding to cell velocity , and was proposed by [ 21 ] as the simplest term obeying the symmetries of the problem . If b < 0 , cells expand their shape perpendicular to the direction of the velocity and contract parallel to the velocity , and vice versa if b > 0 . As keratocytes have their long axis perpendicular to the direction of travel , we will have b < 0 throughout this paper . Lastly , the time evolution of the angle of the polarity , ˆp = ( cos φ p , sin φ p ) , is given by : d φ p d t = − 1 τ arcsin [ ( ˆv × ˆp ) z ] − 1 τ b arcsin [ ( ˆE × ˆp ) z ] + σ p ξ p ( t ) . ( 4 ) The ﬁrst term here aligns the cell’s polarity with its ve - locity over a timescale τ i . e . a cell will want to polarize along its direction of travel [ 38 – 42 ] . The second term similarly shows that the polarity tends to align to the electric ﬁeld’s direction ˆ E over a timescale τ b . This is the only role of the electric ﬁeld within our model . The term ξ p is a Gaussian Langevin noise with zero mean and (cid:104) ξ p ( t 1 ) ξ p ( t 2 ) (cid:105) = δ ( t 1 − t 2 ) . Within our model , we only include the electric ﬁeld’s direction – we do not explicitly include its magnitude , which could alter the timescale over which the polarity aligns with the bias , τ b . III . RESULTS Phase diagram of model in absence of a ﬁeld We show the phases of cell motion in the absence of a ﬁeld in Fig . 3A . With no ﬁeld present and no noise , we observe two relevant steady states : cells may either travel in a straight line with their long axis perpendicular to their velocity , or move in a circular trajectory . Like the original work of [ 21 ] , we observe a transition between perfectly straight , linear motion at small cell speeds ( low γ ) and large shape relaxation rates ( large κ ) and circu - lar motion at large γ and small κ . We can identify this transition line by a linear stability analysis around the steady - state of a cell crawling in a straight line , neglect - ing noise ( Appendix C ) . We ﬁnd two transition lines γ 1 3 E Cell speed and self - propulsion Velocity alignment rate to polarity Velocity tends to long axis Noise perturbs velocity + polarity Rate of shape relaxation Elongation perpendicularto velocity Polarity alignment rate to velocity Polarity alignment rate to field γ a χ σ , σ p κ b τ - 1 τ b - 1 FIG . 2 : Schematic of the diﬀerent terms in the equations of motion for velocity ( Eq . 2 ) , shape ( Eq . 3 ) , and polarity ( Eq . 4 ) . and γ 2 , γ 1 = κ 2 ab + (cid:18) 1 2 µ + χ + τ − 1 ab (cid:19) κ + χ + τ − 1 2 µ ( 5 ) γ 2 = χτ + 1 ab κ 2 + χτ + 1 2 µ κ . ( 6 ) Linear motion is stable to perturbations if γ < min ( γ 1 , γ 2 ) . Once γ > γ 1 or γ 2 , then linear motion is unstable . We mark the region of the phase diagram Fig . 3A where linear motion is stable as “Persistent Motion Stable . ” The phase diagram is plotted with respect to the “wild - type” parameters , the default ﬁtted values for our model parameters . We found these parameters from ﬁtting our model to data from [ 22 ] showing cells’ response to a ﬁeld being turned on ( see Section V : Methods and Fig . 4 ) In Fig . 3A , we highlight three points on the phase di - agram and show example trajectories . The curve in Fig . 3A is simply γ 2 , because γ 2 < γ 1 in the region of param - eter space presented . Unlike the phase diagram , which was constructed without noise , the example trajectories have noise . In the presence of noise , the orientation of the cell changes even in the linear motion phase , and the cell undergoes a persistent random walk due to its ori - entational ﬂuctuations . Thus , we deﬁne linear motion as characterized by perfectly straight cell migration with - out noise . Meanwhile , persistent motion is the analog of linear notion in the presence of noise , characterized by a persistent random walk with no loops , turns , or oscil - lations . We see in Fig . 3A that our wild - type values , represented by point i , are slightly above the transition line , where linear / persistent motion is unstable ; meaning that the cell would exhibit circular motion / noisy trajec - tory with loops , turns , and oscillations . At the wild - type parameters , we see cell trajectories that resemble “knots on a string” [ 17 ] , where the cell goes through episodes of circular movement ( Fig . 3i , Movie S1 ) . The wild - type values being right above the transition line is due to an assumption in our ﬁtting process : because both circular and persistent motion are observed in normal keratocytes , reasonable parameters must be close to the transition ( Section V ) . As we move away from the transition line and increase cell speed by increasing γ ( Fig . 3ii , Movie S2 ) , we see that the cell travels perpetually in a circle , slightly per - turbed by noise . If we move across the transition by increasing cell shape relaxation rate κ ( Fig . 3iii , Movie S3 ) , we see that persistent migratory motion is stabi - lized again . While the boundary derived from Eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) is determined without added noise , it nonetheless captures a key transition in the model between persistent and circular migration . Field stabilizes cell response Fig . 3A shows cell behaviors in the absence of a ﬁeld . Fig . 3B shows how these phases can change in the pres - ence of a ﬁeld . In our simulations , we noticed that un - stable linear motion without a ﬁeld can stabilize with a ﬁeld ( Movie S4 ) , depending on where we are in parameter space . We extended our linear stability analysis to the case with a ﬁeld present with no noise ( Appendix C ) . The linear stability curves are shown in the lines in Fig . 3B , where the solid line demarcates the transition between unstable linear motion and stable linear motion in the absence of an electric ﬁeld , and the dotted line demar - cates the transition in the presence of an electric ﬁeld . However , even if the straight trajectory is linearly unsta - ble , the cell may still be able to follow the ﬁeld . Fig . 3iv shows an example of a trajectory from the phase diagram using our wild - type parameters . ( This trajectory , like all our plotted example trajectories , includes the stochastic noise terms ) . In Fig . 3iv , the ﬁeld is on , but persistent motion is unstable . This is apparent by the presence of loops , turns , and oscillations . It is crucial to note that cells in the regime of globally unstable linear motion , such as Fig . 3iv , clearly can still follow a ﬁeld . The lin - ear stability analysis shows whether the linear trajectory following the ﬁeld is stable to small perturbations – and at the wild - type parameters , it is not . However , once we move across the solid transition line by increasing the rate χ that v aligns with ˆp , linear motion is unstable only in the absence of a ﬁeld , meaning that a cell would migrate persistently without oscillations when a ﬁeld is present . We then see the oscillations around the ﬁeld di - rection disappear in Fig . 3v . Once we cross the dotted transition line by increasing the rate of v − ˆp alignment further , Fig . 3vi shows us a cell following the ﬁeld even more persistently . 4 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 / wt 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 / w t i ii iii Persistent Motion Stable Persistent Motion Unstable Field Stable Stable Unstable iv v vi 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 / wt 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 b / b , w t 0 100 200 300 400 500 X ( m ) - 200 - 100 0 100 200 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 X ( m ) - 150 - 100 - 50 0 50 100 150 Y ( m ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 X ( m ) - 200 - 100 0 100 200 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 X ( m ) - 35 - 30 - 25 - 20 - 15 - 10 - 5 0 200 400 600 X ( m ) 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 50 100 150 200 X ( m ) - 150 - 100 - 50 0 Y ( m ) A B i ii iii iv v vi → → → FIG . 3 : ( A ) : Linear stability phase diagram in γ − κ plane in the absence of electric ﬁeld .

Simulations recapitulate experimental response to ﬁeld To validate our model parameters and determine their wild - type values , we ﬁt our simulations to data from Allen et al . ( 2013 ) [ 22 ] . This data , shown in blue dots in Fig . 4 , shows the experimental data of the average response of 140 cells responding to a ﬁeld being switched on after 15 minutes of no exposure . We simulated 1000 cells freely traveling , responding to a ﬁeld pointing in the + ˆx - direction that is switched on after 15 minutes . In Fig . 4 , we plot the average response of those 1000 cells as directedness vs . time in minutes . The directedness is deﬁned by (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) , where φ is the angle of the cell veloc - ity relative to the ﬁeld . For the ﬁrst 15 minutes when no ﬁeld is present , we observe cells on average to go in all directions , so (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) ≈ 0 . Once the ﬁeld turns on , the cells in the experiment respond to the ﬁeld and follow it to varying levels of precision . In the ﬁgure , we see the directedness leveling oﬀ at (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) ≈ 0 . 6 . This reﬂects both orientational noise and cell trajectories that often oscillate around the ﬁeld direction ( Fig . 3iv ) . Details of the ﬁt are discussed in Section V . Our model captures the experimentally observed re - 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time ( min ) - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 c o s DataSimulation OFF ON FIG . 4 : Cell response to a ﬁeld being turned on .

What parameters inﬂuence this response and to what degree ? Cell speed , shape , and ability to align with ﬁeld control cell response to ﬁeld activation In Fig . 5 we use the cell directedness (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) in re - sponse to a ﬁeld being turned on in order to understand the inﬂuence of model parameters . We see that cells with lower speeds , γ < γ wt , have a more reliable response – their value of (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) saturates to a value of ∼ 0 . 9 , com - pared to ∼ 0 . 6 for the wild - type cells ( Fig . 5A ) . How - ever , this may come at a cost : for a slow enough cell , γ = 0 . 25 γ wt , the response to a ﬁeld turned on at 15 minutes takes over 45 minutes to reach its steady - state level . This behavior is closely linked to where the cell’s parameters are in the phase diagram ( Fig . 3 ) . For speeds much above the wild - type speed , e . g . γ = 1 . 5 γ wt , cells undergo a mostly circular trajectory and there is no net directedness . Based on our linear stability results , we would expect that increasing the rate of shape relaxation κ would make linear , persistent motion more stable , al - lowing for a more directed response . This is what we ﬁnd ( Fig . 5B ) : increasing κ leads to a more directed response ( saturation value of (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) nearing 1 ) . Similarly to our results for cell speed , increasing shape relaxation rate κ can both increase the accuracy and slow the response time ( see κ = 10 κ wt curve ) . In our model , the electric ﬁeld reorients cell polarity ˆ p – but for the cell’s actual motility to reﬂect this change in polarity , the coupling between polarity and velocity is essential . The rate of this coupling is χ . We see that if we decrease χ below the wild - type value , the response to signal becomes systematically less directed ( Fig . 5C ) . However , increasing χ can simultaneously increase ac - curacy and the response time of cells – increasing χ to 10 χ wt results in a cell that reaches near - perfect alignment with the ﬁeld in under ﬁve minutes . This suggests that , with our ﬁt parameters , bringing the velocity in align - ment with the polarity can be the slowest element of cell reorientation . This is consistent with the small value of the time scale τ b : polarity aligns with the ﬁeld in much less than a minute . We have also modeled an alignment of cell polarity back to cell velocity ( “self - alignment” [ 38 , 39 , 42 , 43 ] ) , which occurs with timescale τ . Self - alignment appears to not be essential to cell response . Increasing τ ( reducing the inﬂuence of self - alignment ) even by orders of magni - tude does not have a large eﬀect on directionality ( Fig . 5D ) . By contrast , if τ is decreased to the order of τ b , e . g . at τ = 0 . 1 τ wt , the cell’s polarity must compromise between the ﬁeld direction and the current velocity , and the cell responds more slowly and has a low directedness saturation level . Our model has the cell polarity align to the ﬁeld over a timescale τ b , subject to stochastic noise . Increasing τ b should then reduce the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld . By increasing τ b suﬃciently ( τ b = 50 τ b , wt ) we can nullify cell response to the ﬁeld entirely ( Fig . 5E ) . Because τ b controls cell repolarization to the ﬁeld , we would naively expect decreasing τ b below the wild - type to make the cell response to ﬁeld turn - on faster . However , instead we see little eﬀect of setting τ b = 0 . 1 τ b , wt , suggesting that the reorientation of polarity to the ﬁeld is not rate - limiting – sensible as τ b , wt = 0 . 024 minutes , far less than the timescale for cell reorientation . The relative unimpor - tance of τ b is consistent with the importance of χ : solely increasing χ can make cells respond in < 5 minutes . Cell response to switching ﬁelds includes averaging , tracking , and more complex behaviors Our results in Fig . 4 and 5 show how a cell responds to a ﬁeld that is switched on and kept in a ﬁxed direction . Fig . 6 illustrates the results we see when we observe how a cell responds to a ﬁeld being continually switched between the + ˆ x - and + ˆ y - directions . This is motivated by the experiments of Zajdel et al . [ 29 ] , who probed collective cell migratory response to a rapidly switching electric ﬁeld ( Fig . 6A ) . They discovered that on short time scales ( 20 seconds ) the group of cells time average the varying ﬁeld and follow the composite direction . For example , if a ﬁeld switches from E 0 ˆ x and E 0 ˆ y , cells travel in a 45 degree angle . However , on longer times , cells follow the ﬁeld direction reliably . When single cells respond to time - varying ﬁelds , do they track it closely ( Fig . 6C , Movie S5 ) or average the ﬁeld ( Fig . 6D , Movie S6 ) ? The experimental results of [ 29 ] and our results of Fig . 5 suggest that when a ﬁeld is switched on , there is a delay in response , which aﬀects how well a cell would track or average a ﬁeld . We know some of the parameters that control this .

Error bars are not shown in order to preserve clarity , but curve - to - curve variability is limited ( see dotted red wild - type curve from panel to panel ) . what degree do these parameters control responses to a changing ﬁeld ? ? On what time scale is a switching ﬁeld considered “rapid” ? In Fig . 6 , we show how cells respond to a switching electric ﬁeld . During each simulation , we vary the di - rection of the ﬁeld from + ˆ x to + ˆ y every t ET minutes – the “exposure time” ( Fig . 6A ) . t ET is held constant throughout a single simulation . We show results for how the cell behavior varies with exposure time , varying ex - posure time over 60 values from t ET = 2 . 5 minutes to 2 . 5 hours . We show in Fig . 6B the cell’s response to a switching ﬁeld as a function of exposure time by showing the probability density of the cell velocity’s angle φ cell . We plot this angle relative to the reference angle of 45 o , φ r = π / 4 , which the cell would take if the cell aver - aged the signal perfectly . ( We compute the angles of the velocity averaged over the exposure time ; see Ap - pendix D ) . We anticipated that a cell would take the average of a dynamically changing ﬁeld at short expo - sure times , when the cell could not adequately respond in the timescale of the changing ﬁeld . In this case , the cell should travel along φ r = π / 4 . However , when the exposure time is much longer than the cellular response time ( typically on the order of 10 minutes ) , we would 7 0 100 200 300 400 X ( m ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 0 500 1000 X ( m ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Y ( m ) 0 10 20 30 X ( m ) 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 C D E 2 . 5 75 150 / wt = 0 . 25 0 1 2 2 . 5 75 150 E x po s u r e T i m e ( m i n ) P r obab ili t y D en s i t y / wt = 0 . 25 0 2 - - / 2 0 / 2 2 . 5 75 150 / wt = 0 . 25 0 1 / wt = 1 0 1 2 / wt = 1 0 1 2 - - / 2 0 / 2 / wt = 1 0 2 / wt = 5 0 1 2 / wt = 10 0 5 - - / 2 0 / 2 / wt = 10 0 5 B A E t ET FIG . 6 : ( A ) : Schematic of simulation .

However , as the expo - sure time increases , we would expect to see two distinct bands at ∆ φ = ± π / 4 , a sign that φ cell = { 0 , π / 2 } , in - dicating that the cell is traveling in a staircase pattern 8 ( Fig . 6C ) . This characteristic shape is seen most clearly in Fig . 6B when κ = 10 κ wt . This is consistent with the response to a ﬁeld turning on at κ = 10 κ wt seen in Fig . 5B , where we see a very high level of cell directedness , but a slow response . Hence , we expect cells would not be able to follow a ﬁeld with a short switching time , but would track reliably at long exposure times , forming solid bands at ± π / 4 . However , this branching response is not as evident in the other parameters shown in Fig . 6B . The heat map for χ = 10 χ wt is similar , but shows two clear bands at nearly all exposure times except the shortest ones – there is no averaging unless the ﬁeld is switched less than every 5 minutes . Again , this is consistent with Fig . 5C , where high values of χ have a response time of < 5 minutes and a highly directed response . γ = 0 . 25 γ wt has a heatmap with a forking pattern , but the noise blurs the bands since the cell does not follow and respond to the ﬁeld as strongly , consistent with Fig . 5A . The middle panels of Fig . 6B all show heatmaps at the wild - type parameter values , however , like γ = γ wt 0 . 25 , the heatmaps look blurred at short exposure times , though there are clear peaks at ± π / 4 at longer expo - sure times . The behavior at short exposure time shows a broad distribution of angles ∆ φ , but with a peak at zero , indicating that the cell is most commonly going in the expected direction φ r . Fig . 6C and D show representa - tive examples of trajectories at the wild - type parameters when the ﬁeld is switched at 2 . 5 hours and 5 minutes , respectively ( see also Movies S5 and S6 ) . Even with a ﬁeld on , we observe some parameter val - ues where cells move in circles , which leads to strange results in the corresponding heatmaps in Fig . 6B . For γ = 5 γ wt and κ = 0 . 25 κ wt , we do not see a branching pattern nor do we see peaks at ∆ φ = ± π / 4 , as the cell is rotating – which can be seen in Fig . 5A and B as oscilla - tions in the directionality . This rapid rotation does follow a sort of staircase pattern ( Fig . 6E , Movie S7 ) – but does not result in a net movement in the direction of the ﬁelds . In this regime , the rotating cell body moves perpendicu - lar to the ﬁeld direction . Depending on the direction of the cell’s rotation ( clockwise or counter - clockwise ) , the cell will then move in diﬀerent directions in the ﬁeld . In this example where the cell rotates counterclockwise , the cell’s center of mass drifts in the + ˆ y - direction when the ﬁeld points in the ˆ x - direction , and the cell drifts in the − ˆ x - direction when the ﬁeld points in + ˆ y . When the cell rotates clockwise , the drifts will be in the opposite direc - tion . This rotational motion explains the patchy struc - ture of the heat maps of γ = 5 γ wt and κ = 0 . 25 κ wt : they are constructed from one long simulation , where the cell spontaneously breaks symmetry from its initial condi - tions , ending up rotating clockwise or counter - clockwise , setting its direction of net drift . Therefore , we see either a large density at ∆ φ > 0 or ∆ φ < 0 , which changes from one exposure time to another . We see from this that the inﬂuence of our stochastic noise is attenuated at these extreme parameter values , as the cell’s initial symmetry breaking persists over the length of the trajectory . For the parameter set χ = 0 . 25 χ wt , cells are much less eﬀective at following the ﬁeld ( Fig . 5C ) , and we do not see a strong directed response in the heat maps . This is also in the regime where cells are experiencing episodes of rotation , albeit not always in a perfectly circular pattern ( Movie S8 ) . However , the heat map is not as patchy as the heat maps for γ = 5 γ wt and κ = 0 . 25 κ wt . Instead of seeing larger densities at ∆ φ > 0 or ∆ φ < 0 , we see a more uniform distribution with slight densities near ∆ φ = π / 4 or ∆ φ = − π / 4 at longer exposure times . This is due to the slower rotation and less directed motion in this regime . Hence , this regime has a greater sensitivity to noise . We are plotting the direction averaged over the exposure time . For γ = 5 γ wt , κ = 0 . 25 κ wt , cells often are able to perform several circular motions per averaging period – so the average angle picks up on the net drift . Slower rotations , as in χ = 0 . 25 χ wt , lead to less directed velocities . Therefore , we don’t see analogous patchy bands in the χ = 0 . 25 χ wt case . IV . DISCUSSION Our model recapitulates many separate qualitative mi - gration behaviors observed in single keratocyte cells in or out of a ﬁeld , including straight linear motion , persis - tent turning , turning while following a ﬁeld ( Fig . 3iv ) , and more complex “knots on a string” dynamics ( Fig . 3i ) . These behaviors occur at slightly diﬀerent param - eter points in our model , but they can be created from relatively small changes in parameters – so we expect keratocytes , which have a broad distribution of diﬀerent properties including speed and aspect ratio , would nat - urally exhibit all of the phases shown in Fig . 3 . This results from our initial assumption that wild - type model parameters had to be near the transition calculated from the linear stability analysis . Within our results , we have only studied cells in the presence or absence of a ﬁeld , and have not systemat - ically varied the strength of the ﬁeld , which is not ex - plicitly invoked in our model . There is some evidence that stronger electric ﬁelds increases directedness and de - creases response times of keratocytes [ 13 , 14 , 22 ] . How - ever , these results may be diﬃcult to interpret , as Allen et al . [ 22 ] observed speed increases in keratocytes corre - lated with increasing ﬁeld – but also noted that the in - crease in voltage also led to an increase in temperature , which separately increases cell speed [ 44 ] . The most nat - ural interpretation of our model to study ﬁeld strength systematically is to assume that the rate at which the polarity aligns with the ﬁeld , τ − 1 b , could increase as the ﬁeld increases . For our ﬁt parameters , we predict rel - atively small changes from making the time τ b smaller ( Fig . 5e ) – suggesting that increasing ﬁeld strength be - yond 1 V / cm ( the ﬁeld used in the experimental data shown in Fig . 4 ) would not directly increase taxis , but that dropping the ﬁeld could lead to impaired directional - ity . It is also possible that electric ﬁelds could have eﬀects 9 on single cells beyond repolarization , such as an increase in cell speed ( electrokinesis ) . Increasing ﬁeld strength has been observed to increase cell speed in neural progenitor cells and 3T3 ﬁbroblasts [ 45 , 46 ] , though ﬁeld strengths as low as 0 . 25 V / cm are enough to induce a statistically signiﬁcant response in individual cells and cell clusters [ 22 ] . These possibilities have been systematically stud - ied by Prescott et al . , in experiments on human corneal epithelial cells , who found that the only consistent model was one where cells preferentially polarize in the direction of the ﬁeld [ 47 ] , supporting our broad assumptions about the polarity . Within our model , if cell speeds changed as a function of ﬁeld strength , this could lead to dramatic changes in single - cell response ( Fig . 5A ) . A core element of our model is coupling between cell motion and cell shape , which drives persistent circular motion and oscillation . This coupling could arise through the dynamics of Rho GTPases within the cell [ 16 , 48 ] , and similar eﬀects can be generated through actomyosin instabilities [ 19 ] . How can experimental interventions be interpreted in our minimal model without these el - ements ? κ is a suitable parameter for this interpretation . κ is the rate of cell shape relaxation from an ellipse to a circle . Our model trajectories reveal that a cell with a slower rate of shape relaxation ( transitioning from large κ to κ wt ) can hold an elongated shape for longer peri - ods of time . Slower shape relaxation allows the cell to respond to cues and perturbations more quickly ; how - ever , it tends to sacriﬁce accuracy in following these cues and perturbations ( Fig . 5 ) . We ﬁnd that more elongated cells with small values of κ turn more quickly ( Fig . 5 ) . However , when κ (cid:28) κ wt , cells begin to oscillate . Lee et al . observed that cells with myosin activity inhibited by blebbistatin ( low contractility ) were less likely to os - cillate [ 15 ] , developing a model in which unequal amounts of adhesion on the left and right sides of the cell driven by myosin contractility destabilize linear motion , caus - ing the cell to oscillate . It would be natural to assume that our shape relaxation rate κ would increase with con - tractility . This leads to a contradiction with [ 15 ] , as we see oscillation at low κ , not high contractility . However , blebbistatin has other eﬀects on cell motility , including changing cell speed [ 49 ] . In our model , reduction in cell speed stabilizes linear motion ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , the bleb - bistatin treatments in [ 15 ] may not be straightforward to predict . Zajdel et al . [ 29 ] studied how collections of MDCK kidney epithelial cell line and primary , neonatal mouse skin keratinocytes respond to a rapidly changing ﬁeld . They saw that at exposure times of 10 seconds , a group of cells would average the ﬁeld and follow the composite direction , but would follow a staircase pattern for longer exposure times of 1 . 5 hours . Our results are broadly in agreement with Zajdel et al . in the regime where per - sistent motion is stable . κ = 10 κ wt is a very clear ex - ample . The “wishbone” pattern clearly shows that at small time scales , we see the cell averaging and taking the composite ﬁeld , but at large time scales , we see a cell follow a staircase pattern . The branching point of the wishbone is determined by the cell response time , which is determined by the transition region in the directed - ness vs . time plots ( Fig . 5 ) , the region where the graph has a sharp incline before saturating at steady value of (cid:104) cos θ (cid:105) . Other heat maps show similar behavior , but the level of noise masks the eﬀects . For example , in the wild - type , the density at short time scales is centered at zero , but has a wide spread . Understanding to what extent these single - cell response curves inﬂuence the ability of cell groups to turn around is a future direction . One striking prediction of our model is that , in ex - treme parameter ranges where cells undergo rapid rota - tion , they will travel perpendicularly to the ﬁeld , with a directionality that depends on the cell’s direction of ro - tation ( Fig . 6E ) . In principle , this suggests it could be possible in vitro to use an electric ﬁeld to separate cells that rotate clockwise versus counterclockwise . While we only see this behavior at extreme parameter values when stochasticity becomes less important , our results show that this is possible , highlighting that this behav - ior is allowed by the symmetry of the system , when the clockwise / counter - clockwise rotation breaks the symme - try between ± ˆ y with the ﬁeld in the ˆ x - direction . This drift of single cells is similar to behavior observed in sim - ulations of clusters of rotating cells following a chemical gradient [ 50 ] . V . METHODS Model calibration and ﬁtting Where possible , we use well - known cell parameters for shape , size , and speed . We choose a characteristic speed of v 0 = 10 µ m min − 1 [ 51 , 52 ] , which ﬁxes γ = v 20 . We note that the actual speed of the cell will depend on other parameters other than γ ( see Appendix C ) ; we have only set its rough order of magnitude by choosing v 0 . To set the remainder of our parameters , we ﬁt our model to the experiments results of Allen et al . [ 22 ] , who studied cell directionality in response to an electric ﬁeld being turned on ( shown in Fig . 4 ) . We extracted this data with WebPlotDigitizer [ 53 ] . The experiments show that if the cell’s velocity has an angle φ to the x - axis , the average directionality (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) increases to a steady state value over a time of ∼ 5 − 10 minutes after the ﬁeld is turned on ( Fig . 4 ) . The parameters that needed to be calculated were a , b , κ , ω 0 , χ , τ , τ b , σ , and σ p ; we reparameterized µ = ω 0 / v 20 . To get our ﬁt parameters , we picked from a broad range of plausible values ( See Appendix B ) using Latin hypercube sampling , and then ran a simulation to match the experiment by having no electric ﬁeld when t < 15 min , then setting E = [ 1 , 0 ] when t ≥ 15 min . To min - imize the inﬂuence of initial conditions , we simulate 2 hours of trajectory as equilibration time before the t = 0 point of the trajectories shown in Fig . 4 . We ran 1000 re - 10 Parameter Value Units Description Source v 0 10 µ m min − 1 characteristic keratocyte velocity [ 51 , 52 ] γ v 20 µ m 2 min − 2 propulsion term Deﬁned as v 20 κ 1 . 3068 min − 1 shape relaxation rate ﬁt χ 0 . 0720 min − 1 rate of velocity aligning with polarity ﬁt τ 0 . 0617 min time scale of polarity aligning with velocity ﬁt τ b 0 . 0238 min time scale of polarity aligning with bias ﬁt ω 0 0 . 9758 min − 1 characteristic frequency of keratocyte rotation , deﬁned as ω 0 = µv 20 Fit constrained by [ 17 ] σ 0 . 3372 µ m min − 1 . 5 velocity rotational noise ﬁt σ p 0 . 7058 min − 1 . 5 polarity displacement noise ﬁt a - 0 . 1132 µ m − 1 min − 1 controls rate of velocity responding to shape ( a < 0 means velocity along cell’s long axis increases ) ﬁt b - 0 . 5423 min µ m − 1 controls rate of shape responding to velocity ( b < 0 means cell shape expands perpendicular to ve - locity direction ) ﬁt ∆ t 0 . 001 min time step for simulations TABLE I : Table of parameter values , description , and sources . peated simulations to construct the average directionality (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) over time . The same procedure of equilibration and averaging was conducted for the curves in Fig . 5 , but with 500 simulations . Parameter sets that led to numer - ical instabilities were discarded ; we found these largely corresponded to cells oscillating unphysically fast . We then chose the parameters that created the best - ﬁtting directionality curve , according to our criterion ( see Eq . 8 below ) . We know that in order to observe both circular motion and persistent motion , as seen experimentally , we must have our parameters close to the transition between cir - cular and straight motion ( see Section III ) . To ensure we are near this transition point , and to reduce the number of ﬁt parameters , we constrained the possible ﬁt values for b and κ using two pieces of information : 1 ) the rough experimental aspect ratio of keratocytes , and 2 ) the idea that the cells must be near the transition between circular and persistent motion . The value of the shape deforma - tion parameter s emerges from the model ; if the cell is at steady state in a straight line , it takes on the value s ss = − b κ µγ β + µ , where β = ab 2 κ . Note that a , b < 0 . The values κ and b that would be found if the parameters were at the transition line and at steady state are κ 1 = − as − ( χ + τ − 1 ) , κ 2 = − as χτ + 1 b T = 2 sµκ 2 γµ − as , where s = s ss is the value of s in the steady - state with the cell crawling straight ( Appendix C ) . b T is derived by rearranging v 2ss ( Appendix C ) . There are two equations for κ . Choosing κ = κ 1 sets the system to the transition line in the phase diagram if γ 1 < γ 2 , and choosing κ = κ 2 sets the system to the transition line if γ 2 < γ 1 . For all the plausible range of parameters shown in Table II , γ 2 < γ 1 and so we always choose κ to be near κ 2 ( Table II ) . In setting κ and b , we assume s ss = 12 . 5 µ m , which sets the aspect ratio of the keratocyte . We know experimentally that the roughly elliptical keratocyte cells of interest that we were modeling had an radius of R 0 = 14 . 5 µ m for an equivalent circle of the same area . We then choose the steady state value of s = 12 . 5 µ m , which ensures that the aspect ratio of the cell , ( R 0 + s / 2 ) / ( R 0 − s / 2 ) ≈ 2 . 5 . Our goal is to ﬁnd the parameter set that minimized the error between simulations and experiment – but we suspect from our simulations that many of the oscilla - tions about the steady - state value in the experimental data of Fig . 4 are from the ﬁnite sample size of 140 cells . To avoid overﬁtting , we have chosen not to directly minimize the error between simulation and experiment in (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) ( Fig . 4 ) . Instead , we want our model to correctly capture the response time and steady - state directionality of the data . We ﬁt both the simulated and experimental measurements of (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) to a hyperbolic tangent function : (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) = A tanh (cid:18) t − t s τ r (cid:19) + B . ( 7 ) using MATLAB’s nlinﬁt . As described above , the simu - lation curves of (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) were constructed from averaging together 1000 simulations of the ﬁeld being turned on . In this ﬁt function , t s is the time of the inﬂection point of tanh ( · ) i . e . the time where the derivative is maximal . τ r is the scaling factor that determines how “wide” the function is at the transition . Physically , τ r sets the scale of the time the cell takes to respond to an electric ﬁeld being turned on . The other key parameter in the ﬁtting form Eq . ( 7 ) is the long - time value of the directional - ity , SS = lim t →∞ (cid:104) cos φ (cid:105) = A + B . We found the values τ expt and SS expt from ﬁtting the experimental curve to Eq . ( 7 ) . We then chose , among the range of parameters , the parameters that minimize the error (cid:15) in steady - state 11 value SS = A + B and response time τ r between the experiment and theory : (cid:15) = (cid:18) τ r − τ expt τ expt (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) SS − SS expt SS expt (cid:19) 2 ( 8 ) The resulting wild - type parameters are shown in Table I . The errors bars in Fig . 4 were calculated with the bootstrap method . 100 of the 1000 simulated cells were sampled and the mean of their response was calculated . This process was repeated for 100 samples . The standard deviation of the mean responses of the 100 samples were calculated and used as the error bars . Numerical methods We simulate our model equations ( Eq . ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) ) using the Euler - Maruyama method . To handle the noise ξ ( t ) and ξ p ( t ) numerically , we deﬁned a new Gaussian dis - tributed random variable Γ : Γ ( ∆ t ) = (cid:90) t + ∆ t t ξ ( t ) d t . Using the delta - correlation of the noise , (cid:104) Γ (cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104) Γ 2 (cid:105) = ∆ t . That means numerically , Γ = X√ ∆ t , where X ∼ N ( 0 , 1 ) . For an example of this approach , we inte - grate Eq . ( 2 ) from time t to t + ∆ t : v ( t + ∆ t ) − v ( t ) = f ( v ( t ) , S (cid:126)(cid:126) ( t ) , ˆp ( t ) ) ∆ t + σ Γ ˆv ⊥ ( t ) , Other equations are integrated similarly .

Appendix A : Interpreting shape - velocity coupling In our equations of motion for the velocity , we have a term S (cid:126)(cid:126) · v , which is a matrix product , i . e . its α th component is S αβ v β . We can write S (cid:126)(cid:126) = s   cos 2 θ − 1 2 cos θ sin θ cos θ sin θ sin 2 θ − 1 2   = s 2 (cid:32) cos 2 θ sin 2 θ sin 2 θ − cos 2 θ (cid:33) . ( A1 ) The eigenvectors of S (cid:126)(cid:126) are just the unit vectors parallel to the axis , ˆ n = ( cos θ , sin θ ) and perpendicular to it , ˆ n ⊥ = ( − sin θ , cos θ ) , with eigenvalues ± s / 2 , respectively . If we break up the velocity into the components perpendicular to and parallel to the long axis , v = v (cid:107) ˆ n + v ⊥ ˆ n ⊥ , then S (cid:126)(cid:126) · v = S (cid:126)(cid:126) · ( v (cid:107) ˆ n + v ⊥ ˆ n ⊥ ) = s 2 v (cid:107) ˆ n − s 2 v ⊥ ˆ n ⊥ Thus , revisiting Eq . ( 1 ) , we see that − a S (cid:126)(cid:126) · v = − as ( v (cid:107) ˆ n − v ⊥ ˆ n ⊥ ) / 2 . When a < 0 , as is true everywhere in this paper , this term then makes the velocity component along the long axis ˆ n increase while the component along the short axis decreases – this term makes the velocity align more along the long axis of the cell . Appendix B : Parameter range variation We show in Table II the ranges of parameter values used to ﬁt in our Latin hypercube process . Appendix C : Linear stability analysis We start by ﬁnding the stationary solutions of the deterministic portions of Eqs . ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) , which are a ﬁrst step to ﬁnding linear stability but are also interesting in their own right . First , let us deﬁne v = v ( cos φ , sin φ ) , where v 1 = v cos φ and v 2 = v sin φ are the ﬁrst and second components , respectively . Earlier , we deﬁned ˆn = ( cos θ , sin θ ) and ˆp = ( cos φ p , sin φ p ) , meaning that n 1 , n 2 , p 1 , p 2 can be deﬁned the same way v 1 and v 2 were deﬁned . Knowing 14 Parameter Range Comments κ [ 0 . 9 , 1 . 1 ] κ 1 , 2 Linearly spaced χ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] Logarithmically spaced τ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] Logarithmically spaced τ b [ 0 . 01 , 10 ] τ Logarithmically spaced ω 0 [ 0 . 9 , 1 . 1 ] π 3 rad This constraint is both from the rough timescale of ω 0 ∼ 1 deg / s [ 17 ] and earlier ﬁts , which pointed at this being the plausible range . σ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] (cid:112) v 20 ω 0 Linearly spaced σ p [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] (cid:112) v 20 ω 0 Linearly spaced | a | [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] Logarithmically spaced ; a is required to be negative so that the velocity along the long axis of the cell increases , leading to the turning instability ( Appendix A ) . b [ 0 . 9 , 1 . 1 ] b T Linearly spaced ; b is constrained to be near the value given by the transition condition ( see Methods , Section V ) . b is also required to be negative so that ab > 0 , which is necessary for the instability to occur [ 21 ] . TABLE II : Table showing range over which parameters were varied in the ﬁt . the components of ˆn allow us to list the components of S (cid:126) (cid:126) using Eq . ( 1 ) . Second , it will serve us to rewrite the deterministic portions of Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) component - wise : d v α d t = µ ( γ − v 2 ) v α − aS αβ v β − χ v ( v α v β − | v | 2 δ αβ ) p β , d S αβ d t = − κS αβ + b (cid:18) v α v β − 1 2 | v | 2 δ αβ (cid:19) . where we have implicitly assumed Einstein summation . After making the appropriate substitutions for the components of v , ˆp , and ˆn , one can derive equations for the velocity magnitude , v , the angle of the velocity , φ , the shape change s , and the angle of the major axis θ i . e . Eqs . ( C1 ) - ( C4 ) . To derive Eq . ( C1 ) , one must calculate ˆv · ∂ t v = ( cos φ ) ∂ t v 1 + ( sin φ ) ∂ t v 2 . To derive ( C2 ) , one must calculate ˆv ⊥ · ∂ t v = ( − sin φ ) ∂ t v 1 + ( cos φ ) ∂ t v 2 . To derive Eqs . ( C3 ) and ( C4 ) , one must calculate ( cos 2 θ ) ∂ t S 11 + ( sin 2 θ ) ∂ t S 12 and ( − sin 2 θ ) ∂ t S 11 + ( cos 2 θ ) ∂ t S 12 , respectively . These calculations yield the following equations : d v d t = µ ( γ − v 2 ) v − asv 2 cos 2 ( θ − φ ) ( C1 ) d φ d t = − as 2 sin 2 ( θ − φ ) − χ sin ( φ − φ p ) ( C2 ) d s d t = − κs + v 2 b cos 2 ( θ − φ ) ( C3 ) d θ d t = − v 2 b 2 s sin 2 ( θ − φ ) . ( C4 ) Following [ 21 ] , assuming that we have a steady state with the cell moving in the + ˆ x - direction , i . e . φ = 0 , and that ab > 0 , the steady state solutions for the velocity magnitude , v , and the shape deformation , s , can be calculated by setting Eqs . ( C1 ) - ( C4 ) equal to 0 and solving . When b < 0 , the steady state occurs when θ = π / 2 and s ss = − b κv 2ss , v 2ss = µ γ β + µ , where β = ab 2 κ . ( When b > 0 , the steady state occurs when θ = 0 and s ss = + b κv 2ss . ) b < 0 is used everywhere in this paper for our model . These results so far are identical to the results of Ohta et al [ 21 ] except that we have introduced the scale µ to help make the units of the problem more explicit . At the steady state , φ = φ p , which removes the polarity’s inﬂuence in Eq . ( C2 ) ; thus the polarity equation does not aﬀect the steady - state values of s or θ . 15 Next , for linear stability analysis we can ﬁrst consider the deterministic portion of Eq . ( 4 ) without the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld . In that case , Eq . ( 4 ) simpliﬁes to d φ p d t = − 1 τ arcsin ( ˆv × ˆp ) = φ − φ p τ . ( C5 ) where we have assumed that | φ − φ p | is small enough that arcsin ( sin ( φ p − φ ) ) = φ p − φ , which will be true in our linear stability analysis below . Then , we can deﬁne two new variables , ψ = θ − φ and (cid:15) = φ − φ p , constructing two equations for our analysis from Eqs . ( C1 ) - ( C5 ) : d (cid:15) d t = − as 2 sin 2 ψ − χ sin (cid:15) − (cid:15) τ ≡ f ( (cid:15) , ψ ) ( C6 ) d ψ d t = − 1 2 (cid:18) − as + bv 2 s (cid:19) sin 2 ψ + χ sin (cid:15) ≡ g ( (cid:15) , ψ ) . ( C7 ) Next , we have to linearize f and g with respect to (cid:15) and ψ to ﬁrst order . We evaluate the derivatives of f and g at (cid:15) ∗ = 0 and ψ ∗ = π / 2 ( i . e . at a steady state where velocity and polarity are pointed in the same direction , but the long axis of the cell is perpendicular to this , appropriate since b < 0 for our model ) , giving us : d dt (cid:18) (cid:15) ψ (cid:19) ≈ A (cid:18) (cid:15) ψ (cid:19) ( C8 ) where the Jacobian matrix A =   ∂f ∂(cid:15) ∂f ∂ψ ∂g ∂(cid:15) ∂g ∂ψ   =   − χ − τ − 1 as χ − as + bv 2 s   . Here , s = s ss and v = v ss . For b > 0 , the derivatives are evaluated at (cid:15) ∗ = 0 and ψ ∗ = 0 , altering the second column of the Jacobian matrix by a factor of - 1 . For the solutions of our system of linearized equations to be stable , the eigenvalues of A must both have negative real parts , which requires Tr ( A ) < 0 and det ( A ) > 0 . We can derive Eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) by solving for the γ values that set Tr ( A ) = 0 and det ( A ) = 0 . The linear stability results of our model in the absence of a ﬁeld reduces to that of Ohta & Ohkuma [ 21 ] in the limit where v is no longer aligned with ˆp ( χ → 0 ) , but ˆp is perfectly aligned with v ( τ − 1 → ∞ ) . In this case γ 1 → ∞ while γ 2 → γ c = κ 2 ab + κ 2 µ . As we noted above , µ = 1 is chosen implicitly in [ 21 ] . We also conducted linear stability analysis with the electric ﬁeld present in the deterministic portion of Eq . ( 4 ) , which takes the form d φ p d t = φ − φ p τ + φ E − φ p τ b = φ − φ p τ − φ p τ b . ( C9 ) φ E = 0 since E = [ 1 , 0 ] . To do stability analysis , we need three equations for (cid:15) , ψ , and φ p , as now the angle between the polarity and the electric ﬁeld is important . f ( (cid:15) , ψ , φ p ) gains an extra term , + φ p / τ b , while g ( (cid:15) , ψ , φ p ) remains unchanged and we deﬁne ∂ t φ p ≡ h ( (cid:15) , ψ , φ p ) . The resulting Jacobian matrix is A =   ∂f ∂(cid:15) ∂f ∂ψ ∂f ∂φ p ∂g ∂(cid:15) ∂g ∂ψ ∂g ∂φ p ∂h ∂(cid:15) ∂h ∂ψ ∂h ∂φ p   =   − χ − τ − 1 as τ − 1 b χ − as + bv 2 s 0 τ − 1 0 − τ − 1 b   . ( C10 ) where the derivatives are evaluated at the appropriate steady - state values of (cid:15) , ψ , and φ p . For the solutions to be stable , all three eigenvalues of A must have a negative real part . The analytical form for these conditions are cumbersome ; we show stability diagrams determined by numerically ﬁnding the eigenvalues of A in Fig . 3B . 16 Appendix D : Probability density plots In Fig . 6 , we showed the eﬀect of a rapidly switching ﬁelds in terms of the probability density of angles of the cell velocity . In these simulations , the ﬁeld was switched between the + ˆ x - and + ˆ y - directions with “exposure times” t ET ranging from every 2 . 5 minutes to 2 . 5 hours . The simulation was run for a total of t max = 100 hours . To measure the cell response , we calculated the angle between the average cell velocity in a given time window and the reference angle φ r = π / 4 , which is the average direction of the changing ﬁeld . Algorithm : 1 . Simulate the cell and ﬁnd v ( t ) for a time t ET , keeping the ﬁeld constant . 2 . Compute the average velocity over this time , ¯ v 3 . Find the angle between ¯ v and φ r and store : ∆ φ = φ cell − φ r , where φ cell = arctan ( ¯ v 2 / ¯ v 1 ) 4 . Switch the ﬁeld direction and then repeat steps 1 - 3 until total time t max . 5 . Plot probability density of angles . Appendix E : Supplementary movie captions In all movies , the magnitude | v | shows the magnitude of the velocity in units of µ m / min . Parameters not stated explicitly are given by the default values in Table I . Movie S1 : Trajectory of wild - type cell without any ﬁeld .

At these parameters , the polarity follows the ﬁeld reliably but the cell direction does not .
