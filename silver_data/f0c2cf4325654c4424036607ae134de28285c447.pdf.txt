[ 25 ] As a result , most studies show only low loading capacities and since the MSN pores are generally too small they offer only weak protection against pro - teases . [ 26 ] In addition , these inorganic nanoparticles are typically taken up into cells by endocytosis , which could be detri - mental to sensitive cargo . Recently , we showed cytosolic delivery of low molecular weight dyes / drugs into cells via membrane fusion of liposomes with cell membranes induced by a com - plementary pair of coiled - coil ( CC ) lipo - peptides ( denoted CP 4 K 4 and CP 4 E 4 , Scheme 1 ) . [ 27 – 29 ] For this , these cholesterol – poly ( ethylene glycol ) – peptide conjugates were inserted into the lipid bilayers ( LBs ) of both liposomes and live cells resulting in fusion between opposing membranes . Mechanistic studies revealed that coiled - coil formation between the complementary peptides E 4 / K 4 drives this process . [ 30 – 32 ] Furthermore , liposomes containing the anticancer drug doxorubicin could target and kill modified HeLa cells in a zebrafish xenograft model using the same approach . [ 33 ] In this contribution we studied whether coiled - coil mediated membrane fusion [ 34 , 35 ] could be used for the delivery of large inorganic nanoparticles like protein encap - sulated MSNs to cells ( Figure 1 a ) . Cytochrome - c ( cytC ) was chosen as a model protein as its cytosolic delivery activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway . This allowed us to monitor the uptake of cytC loaded MSNs ( MSNs / cytC ) and the induction of apoptosis [ 36 ] as a measure of cytosolic activity of cytC . 2 . Results and Discussions 2 . 1 . cytC Encapsulation and Release Studies For this study , a new type of MSNs featuring a cuboidal - like geometry ( 90 × 43 nm 2 ) was synthesized ( Figure 1b ) . [ 37 ] The nitrogen adsorption – desorption isotherms of MSNs exhib - ited the characteristic type IV isotherms [ 38 ] with a Brunauer – Emmett – Teller ( BET ) surface area of 506 m 2 g − 1 ( Figure 1c ) . The pore size distribution was found to be 10 ± 1 nm . cytC ( geometric size 2 . 6 × 3 . 2 × 3 . 3 nm 3 ) is a small redox pro - tein that is present in the inner membrane of mitochondria and induces apoptosis when released into the cytosol . [ 39 ] The pore dimensions of MSNs are sufficiently large to accommodate cytC and the open disk - shaped mesostructure renders the encapsulation of cytC very efficient . Within less than 5 min more than 95 % of cytochrome - c ( cytC ) was encapsulated into Protein delivery into the cytosol of cells is a challenging topic in the field of nanomedicine , because cellular uptake and endosomal escape are typically inefficient , hampering clinical applications . In this contribution cuboidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs ) containing disk - shaped cavities with a large pore diameter ( 10 nm ) are studied as a protein delivery vehicle using cytochrome - c ( cytC ) as a model membrane - impermeable protein . To ensure colloidal stability , the MSNs are coated with a fusogenic lipid bilayer ( LB ) and cellular uptake is induced by a complementary pair of coiled - coil ( CC ) lipo - peptides . Coiled - coil induced membrane fusion leads to the efficient cytosolic delivery of cytC and triggers apoptosis of cells . Delivery of these LB coated MSNs in the presence of various endocytosis inhibitors strongly suggests that membrane fusion is the dominant mechanism of cellular uptake . This method is potentially a universal way for the efficient delivery of any type of inorganic nanoparticle or protein into cells mediated by CC induced membrane fusion . J . Yang , J . Tu , R . C .

Introduction Intracellular protein delivery holds promise for a range of biomedical applications , [ 1 ] such as cancer therapy , [ 2 , 3 ] vaccina - tion , and enzyme based therapeutics . [ 4 ] However , therapeutic proteins are susceptible to proteolysis and denaturation , limiting their efficacy in the body . [ 5 , 6 ] To solve the delivery problem , protein delivery systems based on for instance polymeric nanoparticles , [ 7 ] hydrogels , [ 8 , 9 ] or lipid - based nano - particles [ 10 , 11 ] have been developed . Also mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs ) have been studied as carriers for a variety of biomolecules including anticancer drugs , oligonucleo - tides , and proteins . [ 2 , 12 – 24 ] However , most MSNs used in drug delivery studies to date typically have pores with diameters up to 4 nm , thereby limiting their use as efficient carriers for high © 2017 The Authors .

KGaA , Weinheim the mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs / cytC ) . The maximum cytC loading capacity of these cuboidal MSNs was determined to be 470 µ g mg − 1 MSNs ( Figure 2 a , black curve ) . The zeta - potential of MSNs / cytC also changed by increasing the concentration of cytC ( Figure 2a , red curve ) , reaching almost neutrality at saturating concentrations of cytC . At cytC : MSNs weight ratios of 1 : 8 or 1 : 4 the encapsulation efficiency ( EE % ) was quantitative , revealing the excellent protein encapsulation potential of these large - pore MSNs . Compared to native cytC , the encapsulated cytC in the MSNs revealed a slight broadening of the adsorption peak in the UV – Vis spectrum , but no blue shift was observed , suggesting that the interaction between the protein and pore surface did not change the structure of cytC ( Figure S1a , Supporting Information ) . [ 40 ] Since cytC has a positive charge at pH 7 . 4 its adsorption is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged silanol groups on the surface of MSNs . [ 41 , 42 ] Therefore , we studied the influence of ionic strength on the release profile of cytC . At high ionic strength ( 270 × 10 − 3 m ) , 70 . 4 % of cytC was released from MSNs / cytC which decreased to only 16 . 8 % in low ionic strength ( 12 × 10 − 3 m ) buffer revealing the electrostatic nature of protein binding ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ) . Thus , cytC can be loaded with high efficiency into MSNs at low ionic strength and subsequently released at conditions of high ionic strength ( e . g . , inside cells ) . However , the decreased surface charge of MSNs upon cytC loading as evidenced by the near neutral zeta - potential induced aggregation of the nanoparticles . To increase their colloidal sta - bility MSNs / cytC were therefore decorated with a lipid bilayer . After introduction of a fusogenic lipid bilayer composed of Adv .

After loading the MSNs with cytC , the zeta - potential shifted from − 28 . 0 to − 11 . 6 mV . Application of the lipid bilayer onto the exterior sur - face of these particles resulted in a more negative zeta - potential ( − 20 . 5 mV ) ( Figure 2c ) . As a result the lipid coated nanoparti - cles were colloidal stable for at least one week . The presence of the lipid bilayer also reduced the premature release of cytC by a factor of ≈ 1 . 6 as the lipid bilayer acts as a physical bar - rier [ 46 ] thereby retaining the protein better within the MSNs ( Figure 2d ) . 2 . 2 . Intracellular Delivery of cytC Previously , we reported that a pair of complementary lipo - peptides ( i . e . , CP 4 E 4 / CP 4 K 4 ) designed to form coiled - coils was able to mediate the targeted fusion of membranes between liposomes and cells . [ 27 , 47 ] So far , this approach was used to deliver low molecular weight dyes and drugs into the cytosol and nucleus of live cells . To study the scope of this synthetic fusion system , we now were interested to study whether coiled - coil mediated fusion could be used to enhance the intracellular delivery of inorganic nanoparticles like MSNs . Typically , MSNs or lipid bilayer coated MSNs are taken up by endocytosis , [ 14 , 46 , 48 , 49 ] which can be detrimental to the cargo . By employing coiled - coil mediated delivery , the cellular uptake mechanism might be shifted from endocytosis to a direct cytosolic entry via membrane fusion . In order to enhance the intracellular delivery of MSNs / cytC , the nanoparticles were coated with a fusogenic lipid bilayer containing 1 mol % CP 4 E 4 ( MSNs / cytC @ CPE - LBs ) . To induce nanoparticle uptake via membrane fusion , cells were pretreated with CP 4 K 4 [ 29 ] and subsequently MSNs / cytC @ CPE - LBs were added to the medium . Lipopeptides and lipid bilayer coated MSNs with or without CP 4 E 4 were well tolerated by HeLa cells as no signs of toxicity were observed ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information ) . Confocal microscopy imaging revealed that the cytosol became fluorescent within 30 min , indicative of the efficient delivery of Atto488 - labeled cytC inside the cytosol ( Figure 3 a ) . By contrast , when one or both of the lipopeptides were omitted , and thus coiled - coil mediated fusion cannot occur , only limited cellular uptake was observed ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information ) . The intracellular location of the MSNs upon CC mediated delivery was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . It showed that a fraction of the MSNs was outside of the cell , some were entering into the cytoplasm while the majority already appeared inside the cytosol ( Figure 3d , e ) . Importantly , the MSNs appeared not to be localized in endosomes or lysosomes , but were found in the cytosol . From the TEM image it seemed that the MSNs were aggregated ( Figure 3e ) . A possible explanation might be that upon the Adv . Healthcare Mater . 2017 , 6 , 1700759 Figure 2 .

Published by WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim delivery into the cells , the MSNs lose their lipid bilayers and it is well - known that bare MSNs have a tendency to aggregate . In comparison , the uptake efficiency of bare MSNs into cells is low ( Figure S3c , Supporting Information ) . More importantly , in the control experiment bare MSNs were located in early endosomal compartments as evidenced by the presence of a membrane bilayer ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information ) . These results show that CC driven membrane fusion enhances the cellular uptake of these nanoparticles . 2 . 3 . Endocytosis and Micropinocytosis Inhibitors Marginally Affect Delivery To investigate the cellular uptake pathway , we repeated the lipid bilayer coated MSNs delivery in the presence of sev - eral well - known inhibitors using flow cytometry measure - ments ( FACS ) and confocal microscopy imaging . [ 27 , 50 – 54 ] In this study , wortmannin ( Wor ) was used as a micropinocy - tosis inhibitor as it blocks PI3 - kinase , [ 50 , 52 , 55 , 56 ] while gen - istein ( Gen ) inhibits tyrosine - phosphorylation of Cav 1 and caveolin - dependent endocytosis . [ 57 – 59 ] Furthermore , chlor - promazine ( Chl ) was used as it blocks clathrin - dependent endocytosis , [ 51 , 60 , 61 ] and microtubule formation was inhibited by nocodazole ( Noc ) . Uptake studies in the presence of these inhibitors give insight in the intracellular trafficking and internalization mechanisms involved in the uptake of the lipid bilayer coated MSNs . [ 50 – 54 ] Finally , as endocytosis of nanopar - ticles is an energy - dependent process , sodium azide ( NaN 3 ) was used to deplete the energy demands for endocytosis and restrict metabolic activity . [ 62 , 63 ] FACS analysis revealed that Gen , Wor , and Noc had no adverse effect on the delivery of fluorescently labeled cytC ( Figure 4 a ) , whereas in the presence of Chl and NaN 3 , uptake of nanoparticles containing cytC was slightly lowered to 90 % as compared to the initial experiment in the absence of inhibitors . To further study the role of CC formation on the mechanism of cellular uptake , we omitted the CP 4 K 4 pretreatment of HeLa cells in control experiments . Without inhibitors , the MSNs / cytC uptake was less than 60 % ( Figure 4b , red column ) . In the presence of Chl or NaN 3 , the uptake of lipid bilayer coated MSNs was sharply reduced to 10 % ( Figure 4b , dark blue and blue columns ) . This clearly indicates that in this control experi - ment the nanoparticles are most likely taken up by a clathrin - dependent endocytosis pathway . Taken together these inhibi - tion studies strongly indicated that the dominant pathway for CC mediated MSN delivery is most likely via membrane fusion between the lipid bilayer coated MSNs and the cell membrane . By contrast , when CC mediated delivery cannot occur due to the absence of the lipopeptides , the dominant and less efficient route of cellular uptake is via endocytosis . 2 . 4 . Cell Apoptosis Induced by cytC after Delivery It is well - known that an increase in cytC concentration in the cytosol triggers caspase activation , [ 64 – 66 ] ultimately resulting in apoptosis of the cell . [ 39 , 67 ] Therefore , the amount of apoptosis as quantified by caspase activity can be used as a tool to confirm the actual delivery of cytC in the cytosol of cells . 100 % apoptosis was induced by treatment with anti - Fas receptor antibody after 5 h .

Published by WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim bilayer - coated MSNs resulted in 55 % of apoptosis after 48 h ( Figure 5 a , green column ) . By contrast , free cytC induced only 10 % of apoptosis ( Figure 5a , red column ) , without CC infor - mation cytC delivered by lipid bilayers induced around 20 % of apoptosis ( Figure 5d , blue column ) . Optical microscopy imaging demonstrated the morphological changes of apoptotic HeLa cells versus healthy cells upon cytC delivery , supporting the caspase assay ( Figure 5b , c ) . In summary , coiled - coil mediated membrane fusion enhanced the observed level of apoptosis , due to the increased uptake and release of cytC into the cytosol of cells . In control experiments where one or both of the lipopeptides were omitted only minimal levels of apoptosis ( < 10 % ) were observed , revealing that coiled - coil mediated delivery of MSNs @ LBs is more efficient when compared to delivery via endocytic pathways ( Figure 5d – f ) . 3 . Conclusions Direct cytosolic delivery of cytC encapsu - lated MSNs decorated with a fusogenic lipid bilayer was achieved by targeted coiled - coil mediated membrane fusion with the cells while the uptake via endocytosis was mini - mized as shown by the inhibition cell uptake study . The uptake pathway and localization of MSNs / cytC in HeLa cells were confirmed by TEM and confocal imaging , and the release of functional cytC was demonstrated by its ability to trigger enhanced levels of apop - tosis . We believe that our coiled - coil - based membrane fusion system is suitable for the delivery of a wide range of proteins or high molecular weight compounds as long as these can be encapsulated in the pores of the MSNs . It is envisaged that this method is also suitable for the delivery of any ( in ) organic nanoparticles as long as it can be encapsu - lated in or decorated with a fusogenic lipid bilayer carrying the coiled coil peptide at its interface . Therefore , this method of delivery may have applications in the field of biomedi - cine and diagnostics . Adv . Healthcare Mater . 2017 , 6 , 1700759 Figure 4 . Mechanistic cellular uptake study .
