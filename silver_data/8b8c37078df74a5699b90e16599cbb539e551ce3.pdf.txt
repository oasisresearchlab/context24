Biomaterials have emerged as important tools for the development of physiological models , due to the range of adaptable properties of these materials , such as degradability and biocompatibility . Biomaterial hydrogels can act as alternative substrates for cellular studies , which have been particularly key to the progression of the cardiovascular ﬁeld . This review will focus on the role of hydrogels in cardiac research , speciﬁcally the use of natural and synthetic biomaterials such as hyaluronic acid , polydimethylsiloxane and polyethylene glycol for culturing induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes ( iPSC - CMs ) . The ability to ﬁne - tune mechanical properties such as stiffness and the versatility of biomaterials is assessed , alongside applications of hydrogels with iPSC - CMs . Natural hydrogels often display higher biocompatibility with iPSC - CMs but often degrade quicker , whereas synthetic hydrogels can be modiﬁed to facilitate cell attachment and decrease degradation rates . iPSC - CM structure and electrophysiology can be assessed on natural and synthetic hydrogels , often resolving issues such as immaturity of iPSC - CMs . Biomaterial hydrogels can thus provide a more physiological model of the cardiac extracellular matrix compared to traditional 2D models , with the cardiac ﬁeld expansively utilising hydrogels to recapitulate disease conditions such as stiffness , encourage alignment of iPSC - CMs and facilitate further model development such as engineered heart tissues ( EHTs ) .

Cardiac Extracellular Matrix The myocardium consists of multiple cell types [ 1 ] , with cardiomyocytes and cardiac ﬁbroblasts being the most abundant ones . In the healthy myocardium , the extracellu - lar matrix ( ECM ) acts as a mechanical scaffold that provides structural organization and support to these cells and is key for maintaining cardiac homeostasis by mediating cellu - lar responses [ 2 ] . Cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies trigger remodelling of the ECM , leading to increased collagen deposition and stiffness of the extracellular matrix as part of pathological changes of the myocardium [ 3 , 4 ] . The ECM is known to dictate cardiac cell behaviour by altering matrix rigidity , thus altering cell phenotypes and structure [ 5 ] . Thus , elucidating the matrix environment within the myocardium is relevant for understanding the progression of cardiovascular disease phe - notypes . Recent cardiovascular research has shifted towards developing physiologically comparable synthetic ECM models that mimic healthy and diseased myocardium tissues , e . g . , by utilizing hydrogels . Induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes ( iPSC - CMs ) are cardiac cells generated from stem cells which are widely used in the ﬁeld for studying cardiac diseases and modelling cardiac phenotypes as alternatives to primary cells or tissue [ 6 ] . Many Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / ijms24129995 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 2 of 15 in vitro models use iPSC - CM and cardiac ﬁbroblasts cultured on plastic dishes or glass , which often have a highly variable stiffness range from of 1 MPa – 3 GPa . These conditions do not reﬂect physiological conditions in the heart , with the healthy ECM possessing a modulus of approximately 10 kPa whilst ﬁbrotic ECM stiffness is approximately greater than 40 kPa [ 7 , 8 ] . The stiffness of cell culture surfaces often correlates to different disease phenotypes , such as transition of ﬁbroblasts to myoﬁbroblasts in cardiac ﬁbrosis , which con - sequently activates distinct biomechanical pathways [ 9 ] . Therefore , cells cultured on stiffer substrates may not display a healthy phenotype , thus causing difﬁculty in distinguishing a ‘healthy’ phenotype for downstream comparison to diseased cells . Cell culture dishes , consequently , deviate from the biophysical environment , which highlights the requirement for softer substrates to examine cellular systems . Several strategies have been employed to improve cell culture dishes and better mimic native myocardium environments . The dish surfaces are commonly coated with several substrates that are found in the ECM , such as collagen , laminin or ﬁbronectin . Formulations that contain several of these ECM components , such as Matrigel or Geltrex , can further facilitate cell differentiation and attachment . However , a key drawback with these ECM formulation coatings is their batch - to - batch variability in composition and biomechanical properties ( such as stiffness ) , which leads to a lack of experimental reproducibility [ 10 ] . Furthermore , the stability of ECM coatings can be problematic in long - term cell culture experiments . This is a notable issue when they are used for cardiac research , since cardiac cells such as iPSC - CMs only reach maturity after 30 days . The limitations associated with simple glasses or plastic dishes have driven the search for alternative substrates that possess greater structural integrity and are biologically , chemically and mechanically modiﬁable . 1 . 2 . Hydrogels as Synthetic Biomaterials Scaffolds Biomaterials are natural or synthetic substances which can interact with biologi - cal systems and maintain signalling , thus playing a major role in tissue engineering ad - vances [ 11 , 12 ] . Hydrogels , which are 3 - dimensional crosslinked polymer networks that absorb and retain water whilst maintaining their structural integrity , have emerged as a promising class of synthetic biomaterials [ 13 ] . The structural integrity of hydrogels can be altered through chemical modiﬁcation based on the crosslinking of polymer chains [ 14 ] . Speciﬁcally , the mechanical properties can be ﬁnely tuned by modulating several factors including polymer composition or charge , network architecture / crosslinking density , and responsiveness to external stimuli [ 15 ] . Furthermore , varying the composition and / or crosslinking density of hydrogels is an effective means to control their degradability or lifetime . The degree of crosslinking between polymers directly impacts the integrity of the hydrogel , with greater crosslinking resulting in a stronger gel but reduced ﬂexibility of the network ; a balance of network crosslinking is required to enable mechanical strength and elasticity of a hydrogel [ 16 ] . In addition to crosslinking , the molecular weight and chemical nature of polymers used for hydrogel synthesis can further impact the hydrophilicity and swelling behaviour of gels , as the incorporation of monomers that have high hydrophilicity portray greater swelling ratios [ 17 ] . Choice of polymer can therefore alter the formation and degradation properties of hydrogels . Due to the modular nature of hydrogels , they are extensively developed and applied as biomaterials for wide - ranging medicinal applications [ 18 – 21 ] . 1 . 3 . Functionalisation of Hydrogels Hydrogel biomaterials often display poor cell adhesion properties ; hence , function - alisation of hydrogels is key for transforming them from bioinert to bioactive . There are several methods of functionalising hydrogels to improve properties , with chemical modiﬁ - cation being the most common . The installation of functional groups onto polymers or via post - functionalisation of the hydrogels after gelation can improve the adsorption capacity of hydrogels , in addition to reﬁning their selectivity and stability [ 22 ] . In the search for more biocompatible reaction conditions , post - functionalisation strategies have moved away Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 3 of 15 from inefﬁcient metal - catalysed reactions and towards mild click reactions that employ organocatalysts [ 23 ] . Peptides , such as integrin binding peptides , are a common motif used to improve bioactive properties into hydrogels , where their chemical functionality promotes interaction between the hydrogel and cell components to facilitate cell adhesion [ 24 ] . The naturally occurring peptide arginyl - glycyl - aspartic acid ( RGD ) is most widely used for the func - tionalisation of gels to improve cell attachment ( Figure 1 ) [ 25 ] . In general , the content of peptides in hydrogel scaffolds is positively correlated to the number of ﬁbroblasts and cardiomyocytes attached to various hydrogels [ 26 , 27 ] . Int . J . Mol .

Various end groups utilized for polyethylene glycol hydrogel functionalization . Electrostatic interactions also play a key role in functionalising hydrogels , as oppos - ing charges between the surface of hydrogels and cells increase the strength of electrostatic a tt raction [ 22 ] . Charged residues are a tt racted to polar groups , and often these interactions occur at functional sites [ 28 ] . The electrostatic charges can facilitate interactions between enzymes , peptides and proteins and therefore improve cell adhesion to hydrogel surfaces . Mechanical properties of hydrogels and electrostatic interactions can also be in ﬂ uenced by various factors , such as the molecular weight of hydrogel materials , ratios of materials used , pH and temperature [ 29 ] . Various reactive groups on amino acids that are inherent ( e . g . , amines , thiols or car - boxylates ) or synthetically modi ﬁ ed ( e . g . , azides ) can be utilised to ligate peptides to hy - drogels [ 30 , 31 ] . In particular , lysine and cysteine are commonly used amino acids within this context due to their accessible amino and / or thiol groups . For example , thiol - ene click Figure 1 .

Various reactive groups on amino acids that are inherent ( e . g . , amines , thiols or carboxylates ) or synthetically modiﬁed ( e . g . , azides ) can be utilised to ligate peptides to hydrogels [ 30 , 31 ] . In particular , lysine and cysteine are commonly used amino acids within this context due to their accessible amino and / or thiol groups . For example , thiol - ene click chemistry has been commonly used for protein conjugation where the nucleophilic thiol or amino groups can react with electrophilic unsaturated bonds , such as alkynes or alkenes , under mild conditions to form robust thioether bonds [ 32 ] .

Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 4 of 15 • Application of hydrogels in cardiovascular research Hydrogels have been employed within in vitro cardiac research as they show great potential to represent the physiological conditions of the heart , by acting as tissue scaffolds that mimic the matrix environment . Consequently , most hydrogels for cardiac research are often derived from ECM proteins such as collagen , elastin or mixtures of ECM proteins such as Matrigel since they are naturally occurring and therefore may reﬂect an appropriate response to cells and remodelling [ 33 ] . In addition , the permeability of hydrogels allows for facile diffusion of nutrients , which is a desirable feature of the native ECM . Naturally occurring polymers , such as collagen , hyaluronic acid and alginate are a popular choice for developing hydrogels ( Figure 2 ) since these polymers are inherently biocompatible and degradable [ 34 ] . However , natural hydrogels can suffer from a narrow property range ( e . g . , mechanical stiffness or degradability ) , very from batch to batch and are less amenable to covalent modiﬁcation . In contrast , hydrogels that are based on synthetic polymers such as polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) are renowned for their high stability and modularity , with the polymers serving as ‘blank’ backbones for chemical modiﬁcations [ 35 , 36 ] . The overall structure of these hydrogels can be altered to access tailored properties , by simply adjusting the relative ratios of precursor polymers or even changing fundamental polymer characteristics such as molecular weight [ 37 ] . In addition , the mechanical stiffness of synthetic hydrogels can be modiﬁed through adjusting scaffold porosity and network interconnectivity including crosslinking density [ 38 ] . Int . J . Mol .

Various chemical composition / structure of natural hydrogels ( formed from alginate , gelatin / collagen and hyaluronic acid ) and synthetic hydrogels ( formed from polyacrylamide , poly - dimethylsiloxane and polyethylene glycol ) commonly used as substrates for cardiovascular research . Natural and synthetic hydrogels used for iPSC - cardiomyocytes often require additional coatings to facilitate attachment . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 5 of 15 An essential feature when developing synthetic hydrogels is to ensure the mainte - nance of a desirable pH near 7 . 4 which imitates the ECM environment . Deviation from a physiological pH , often indicated through changes in colour of cell culture media , can result in acidic hydrogels , which are highly cytotoxic and thus incompatible for cell culture . This issue can arise when using synthetic hydrogels , where leaching of unreacted precursors or small molecules can change the pH or cause cytotoxicity . Therefore , it is often essential to thoroughly wash synthetic gels with physiological buffers or media to remove any remaining compounds / materials that are not incorporated into the network . The rest of this review will focus on examples of both natural and synthetic hydrogels that have been directly used in the ﬁeld of cardiovascular research , whilst highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses ( Table 1 ) .

Hydrogels from Natural Polymers Natural hydrogels can further be classiﬁed into two primary groups , polysaccharides ( such as hyaluronic acid and alginate ) and proteins ( such as collagen ) [ 45 ] . 2 . 1 . Collagen / Gelatin Based Hydrogels Collagen is the dominant extracellular protein in the heart , playing a key role in the structure of the cardiac myocardium . Gelatin , obtained by hydrolysis of collagen , is a water - soluble polymer ( Table 1 ) that has been utilized widely for tissue engineering and hydrogel synthesis due to its ease of availability , low cost , biodegradability and cell attachment motifs and peptides [ 46 , 47 ] . In addition , gelatin can be easily modiﬁed and processed into various forms and thus is commonly used for hydrogel development and drug therapeutics [ 41 ] . Both collagen and gelatin hydrogels have high biocompatibility Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 6 of 15 with iPSC - CMs , both as individual biomaterials and when blended with other proteins such as ﬁbrin [ 48 ] . A key advantage of gelatin as a biomaterial is the lack of further ECM coatings required for cell adhesion ; iPSC - CMs have been shown to attach directly to gelatin hydrogels for over 3 weeks in culture , which is ideal for cardiac cell ageing experiments [ 49 ] . Anisotropic alignment of sarcomeric structures in rat cardiomyocytes has also been portrayed with culture on gelatin gels [ 50 ] . Furthermore , cardiomyocytes have portrayed synchronized beating and calcium transients whilst pacing on gelatin hydrogels , indicating gelatin hydrogels are suitable for electrophysiological analysis [ 51 ] . Gelatin hydrogels recapitulate a range of soft stiffnesses with elasticities ranging from 1 – 236 kPa [ 50 ] , which , however , limit the capabilities for producing stiffer hydrogels . In addition , gelatin hydrogels are more susceptible to degradation by proteases , increasing the degradation rate and decreasing the thermal stability of hydrogels [ 52 , 53 ] . Furthermore , the source from which collagen has been extracted to form gelatin can alter the stiffness and crosslinking of the hydrogel , thus impacting hydrogel properties and variability between gelatin hydrogels [ 54 ] . 2 . 2 . Alginate Gels Alginate is a natural polymer ( Table 1 ) that can be rapidly crosslinked in the presence of calcium , and it has been used extensively as a substrate to study cardiomyocytes [ 39 ] . A key feature of alginate hydrogels is their ionic crosslinking mechanism , which enables temperature independent gelation , facile cell encapsulation and good cell recovery [ 55 ] . Additionally , alginate has low toxicity and is readily available at a low cost . Furthermore , alginate hydrogels can range in stiffnesses , from 200 – 500 kPa ( Table 1 ) . Alginate hydrogels with and without RGD peptide modiﬁcation portrayed cardiac ﬁbroblast attachment [ 56 ] , highlighting the excellent cytocompatibility of alginate hydrogels with cardiac cells . Cardiomyocytes cultured on hydrogels formed from a combination of alginate and gelatin have shown successful beating of human iPSC - CM and sarcomeric protein expression [ 57 ] . Alginate scaffolds also hold advantageous electrophysiological properties , exempliﬁed by their increased conductivity , enhanced cell alignment and higher expression of electrical coupling protein connexin - 43 under electrical stimulation in cardiac cells [ 40 ] . Despite the maintenance of cardiac cell structure and beneﬁcial electrophysiological properties of alginate hydrogels , there are several limitations of using alginate hydrogels in the cardiovascular ﬁeld . The repelling anionic surface of native alginate hydrogels leads to issues with cell attachment , hence often requiring further functionalisation of alginate scaffolds or addition of peptides [ 58 ] , which may further deviate from physiologically relevant conditions . Previous research and clinical trials using alginate scaffolds with cardiac ﬁbroblasts have shown degradation over relatively short periods of time , varying from 15 to 21 days [ 59 , 60 ] . Cardiovascular research often requires long - term cultures of cardiac cells , such as iPSC - CMs which require a minimum of 30 days in culture . Thus , the rapid degradability of alginate hydrogels can be a signiﬁcant challenge . 2 . 3 . Hyaluronic Acid - Based Hydrogels Hyaluronic acid is a natural glycosaminoglycan ( Table 1 ) that is abundant in the myocardial extracellular matrix and plays a role in cardiac development , structural organi - sation and wound healing processes [ 21 ] . The uncomplicated ability to modify hyaluronic acid hydrogels via peptide conjugation makes it an attractive biomaterial . Thiol - modiﬁed hyaluronic acid hydrogels portrayed increased dermal ﬁbroblast attachment and prolifera - tion up to 15 days in vitro cell culture when crosslinked with polyethylene glycol diacrylate and RGD peptides [ 61 ] . Furthermore , a range of stiffnesses are accessible starting from thiolated hyaluronic acid and varying the ratios and thus the crosslinking density , which is beneﬁcial for testing different stiffnesses [ 62 ] . However , hyaluronic acid gels of stiffnesses greater than 1 kPa Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 7 of 15 did not affect myoﬁbrillar assembly of cardiomyocytes [ 63 ] , indicating that the effect of stiffnesses may be saturated or overridden on hyaluronan gels and therefore may not serve as an accurate tool . Functionalisation of hyaluronic acid can also cause unintended issues , as gels synthesized with tyramine displayed cell leakage due to poor mechanical strength of the network coupled with low cell viability over 3 days [ 64 ] . As with alginate gels , studies using hyaluronic acid gels have highlighted issues with rapid degradation ( thinning of gels ) and reduced stiffness over time [ 65 ] . Cardiomyocyte maturity and alignment are essential factors in cardiovascular research , with several studies aiming to reﬂect physiological conditions by maintaining cardiac structures [ 66 , 67 ] . Hyaluronic acid , when added to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and ﬁbroblasts , disrupted the organisation of cells , with reduced alignment and increased tissue diameter [ 68 ] . The altered structure of cardiac cells when exposed to hyaluronic acid indicates signiﬁcant issues with hyaluronic acid as a representative ECM model . Furthermore , injection of thiol hyaluronic acid hydrogels into rat myocardium led to an inﬂammatory response and recruitment of granulomas surrounding the hydrogel , ref . [ 69 ] suggesting the in vivo applicability of the hydrogels may be limited . The biocompatibility issues with hyaluronic acid hydrogels therefore highlight a key limitation of this substrate for investigation into cardiac cell function . 3 . Synthetic Hydrogels Compared to natural hydrogels , the use of synthetic hydrogels has steadily increased primarily due to their ﬂexibility in controlling mechanical and chemical properties . Nev - ertheless , synthetic hydrogels often require additional derivatisation , usually via surface coating , to enhance cell attachment [ 70 ] . 3 . 1 . Polydimethylsiloxane Polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) is a silicone - based polymer ( Table 1 ) that is commonly used in biological research across a wide - range of cell types due to its biocompatibility , optical clarity , low cost and ﬂexibility in fabrication [ 71 ] . There are several commercially available formulations of PDMS ; however , Sylgard 184 is the most prevalent precursor for hydrogel synthesis due to its simple curing and strong mechanical properties . Another signiﬁcant strength of using PDMS hydrogels is the wide range of elasticity and mechanical stiffnesses that can be developed ( Table 1 ) . PDMS hydrogels can be created by blending Sylgard 184 elastomer curing agent and Sylgard 527 base agent and curing overnight at 65 ◦ C . The different ratios of Sylgard 527 to Sylgard 184 alters the Young’s modulus of mechanical stiffness , and thus can achieve a range of elastic moduli from 12 kPa to 2 . 5 MPa [ 72 ] . The ability to combine PDMS hydrogels with other biomaterials such as hyaluronic acid and polyethylene glycol enhances mechanical properties and degradation , making it desirable for research [ 73 , 74 ] . The varying stiffnesses of PDMS have been utilised for studying ﬁbrosis , as cardiac ﬁbroblasts cultured on stiffened PDMS hydrogels portrayed activation and conversion to myoﬁbroblasts [ 75 ] , indicating that PDMS can mirror pathophysiological conditions of the ECM . In addition , other cardiac cell parameters such as cardiomyocyte electrophysiology can be assessed when using PDMS as a substrate . Large differences in calcium wave propagation velocity have been observed in ventricular myocytes cultured on stiff vs . soft PDMS , 2 . 7 MPa vs . 27 kPa [ 76 ] . Thus , this demonstrates that PDMS is suitable for mimicking both healthy and diseased cardiac environments . Further supporting evidence was found in increased contractility and calcium handling responses from iPSC - CMs cultured on PDMS substrates that possessed physiological stiffness [ 77 ] . Sarcomeric organisation and alignment of cardiac cells are features of successful dif - ferentiation and cell maturity , which are key factors observed when using alternative substrates for ECM environments . Micro - grooved PDMS hydrogels have been shown to improve iPSC - CM alignment ( Figure 3 ) , with greater organisation of sarcomeric struc - tures [ 78 ] and higher expression levels of sarcomeric components compared to iPSC - CMs Int .

A key issue with untreated PDMS is the hydrophobicity of its surface , which negatively impacts protein adsorption and inhibits cell a tt achment [ 80 ] . Thus , ECM coatings ( such as ﬁ bronectin or Matrigel ) are often added to PDMS to enhance bioactive properties . However , delamination of the coating from the hydrogel surface is a signi ﬁ - cant issue , leading to increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis [ 81 ] . Furthermore , basal respi - ration and ATP production rates were found to be reduced in ventricular cardiomyocytes cultured on PDMS gels in comparison to gelatin hydrogels , independent of substrate ri - gidity [ 81 ] . This indicates PDMS may not portray metabolic changes of cardiomyocytes as well as other hydrogel substrates , which is an important factor to consider when review - ing candidates for ECM models . 3 . 2 .

Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 9 of 15 3 . 2 . Polyacrylamide Polyacrylamide ( PAA ) is a synthetic biomaterial ( Table 1 ) that has widely been used for the study of cardiomyocytes , due to its non - toxicity , stability and hydrophilic properties [ 82 ] . The stiffness of PAA hydrogels ( up to 200 kPa ) can be easily modiﬁed by altering the ratio of bis - acrylamide crosslinker and acrylamide monomers [ 83 ] , increasing the desirability of PAA hydrogels as ECM models . A principal advantage of PAA hydrogels is that they are suitable for investigating electrophysiology of cells due to their comparatively low mechanical stiffnesses ( Table 1 ) . Patch clamping carried out on neonatal rat CMs cultured on 9 kPa PAA gels portrayed longer action potential durations than cardiomyocytes on softer ( 5 kPa ) and stiffer ( > 15 kPa ) PAA hydrogels [ 84 ] . The changes in CM electrophysiology based on substrate stiffness indicates PAA is also effective at mimicking the ECM .

Cardiac ﬁbroblasts cultured onto soft ( 2 and 4 . 5 kPa ) PAA hydrogels and 2 kPa were shown to express α - smooth muscle actin after 15 days , indicating that the gels are good surrogates for native tissue as α - smooth muscle actin is a classic activated ﬁbroblast marker [ 86 ] .

Sci . 2023 , 24 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 15 Polyacrylamide ( PAA ) is a synthetic biomaterial ( Table 1 ) that has widely been used for the study of cardiomyocytes , due to its non - toxicity , stability and hydrophilic proper - ties [ 82 ] . The sti ﬀ ness of PAA hydrogels ( up to 200 kPa ) can be easily modi ﬁ ed by altering the ratio of bis - acrylamide crosslinker and acrylamide monomers [ 83 ] , increasing the de - sirability of PAA hydrogels as ECM models . A principal advantage of PAA hydrogels is that they are suitable for investigating electrophysiology of cells due to their comparatively low mechanical sti ﬀ nesses ( Table 1 ) . Patch clamping carried out on neonatal rat CMs cultured on 9 kPa PAA gels portrayed longer action potential durations than cardiomyocytes on softer ( 5 kPa ) and sti ﬀ er ( > 15 kPa ) PAA hydrogels [ 84 ] . The changes in CM electrophysiology based on substrate sti ﬀ - ness indicates PAA is also e ﬀ ective at mimicking the ECM .

PAA can also be used to investigate changes in gene expression ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 4 .

Analogous to many other synthetic hydrogels , the non - ionic nature of polyacryla - mide leads to inert surfaces and hence often demands functionalisation to promote e ﬀ ec - tive adhesion of cells and proteins [ 87 , 88 ] . Furthermore , PAA hydrogels may not be suit - able for simulating a ﬁ brotic or ageing ECM , as PAA gels tend to have lower sti ﬀ nesses and and / or tensile strengths due to excessive swelling [ 89 , 90 ] .

Analogous to many other synthetic hydrogels , the non - ionic nature of polyacrylamide leads to inert surfaces and hence often demands functionalisation to promote effective adhesion of cells and proteins [ 87 , 88 ] . Furthermore , PAA hydrogels may not be suitable for simulating a ﬁbrotic or ageing ECM , as PAA gels tend to have lower stiffnesses and and / or tensile strengths due to excessive swelling [ 89 , 90 ] . Furthermore , PAA hydrogels are often Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 10 of 15 difﬁcult to adhere to plastic surfaces , which restricts their more general use in cell culture studies [ 91 ] . In addition , the short life span of PAA hydrogels ( usually up to 10 days ) is not ideal for long - term iPSC - CM cultures [ 88 , 92 ] . Finally , PAA hydrogels often suffer from poor thermostability , with structural deterioration / degradation due to hydrolysis of amide groups , thus disrupting polymer chains [ 93 ] . 3 . 3 . Polyethylene Glycol ( PEG ) Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) hydrogels ( Table 1 ) are widely used in the medical ﬁeld as delivery strategies for bioactive molecules and tissue engineering , due to their biocom - patibility , non - toxicity and propensity for chemical modiﬁcation [ 94 ] . PEG holds several structural , physical and chemical properties that are similar to the ECM , such as its high - water solubility and level of hydration [ 95 ] . The well - developed chemistry behind PEG hydrogels offers potential to develop hydrogels with highly speciﬁc properties , which can be tailored to recapitulate the ECM . Despite PEG itself not having reactive functional groups along the polymer backbone , the end groups such as thiol and alkynes can be easily modiﬁed with reactive motifs to create telechelic polymers ; low molecular weight polymers with functional groups on both chain ends are valuable hydrogel precursors [ 96 ] . This modularity enables the production of a vast range of hydrogels with various desirable gel properties . PEG hydrogels have been widely used in the cardiac ﬁeld across several cell types . iPSC - endothelial cells encapsulated in PEG hydrogels have been shown to successfully incorporate into vascular networks and express genes involved in vasculature develop - ment [ 97 ] . Furthermore , PEG hydrogels can maintain cardiac cell structures , as 3D culture of adult murine cardiomyocytes encapsulated in PEG hydrogels have shown preserved sarcomeric integrity and t - tubular structure [ 44 ] . The lack of interference with cell struc - tures signiﬁes that PEG is a suitable material for assessing the effects of ECM environments on cardiac cell structure . In addition , contractility of aortic valve interstitial cells in PEG hydrogels has also been measured [ 98 ] , indicating the potential of PEG hydrogels to assess a vast range of cardiac parameters such as stress ﬁbre formation and molecular structure . However , a major limitation of PEG hydrogels is their distinctive lack of cell speciﬁc adhe - sion , which requires functionalisation ( e . g . , with RGD peptides ) to increase their afﬁnity for cell binding [ 30 ] . 4 . Conclusions Cardiac research is highly dependent on the synthetic models that are used to explore cardiac diseases . Therefore , it is instrumental that these models are robust and physiologi - cally relevant . Currently , many scientiﬁc in vitro ﬁndings are unable to be recapitulated in a whole organism . With the advancement in technologies such as the development of iPSC - CMs and induced pluripotent stem cell - derived ﬁbroblasts , there is an unfulﬁlled need for a mechanically stable hydrogel that can withstand long term cell cultures and achieve a range of stiffnesses , to better imitate the ECM under various conditions and physiologi - cal states . Ideal hydrogel properties for iPSC - CMs would include limited degradability , biocompatibility , effective cell adhesion and low cost to enable wide - scale use . Chemical modiﬁcation of hydrogels with attachment peptides such as RGD have enhanced iPSC - CM attachment to hydrogels , which are common issues experienced with iPSC - CMs due to the sensitive nature of the cells . Furthermore , iPSC - CMs cultured on hydrogels can enable maturation of cells , addressing a key issue of iPSC - CMs in the ﬁeld . Another important consideration for hydrogels suitable for iPSC - CM culture include gels that do not interfere with ECM protein deposition , as iPSC - CMs in co - culture with FBs interact and deposit their own ECM proteins such as collagen [ 99 , 100 ] . Hydrogels that can coat surfaces such as coverslips and cell culture dishes would be beneﬁcial , enabling cell culture compatibility and thus easing experimental design . Hydrogels offer a highly effective biomaterials platform , allowing for 2D cellular mod - elling in a more physiologically relevant environment than plastic cell culture dishes , and Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9995 11 of 15 are better for emulating the adult myocardium and ECM . Hydrogels are highly versatile , inexpensive and biocompatible , characteristics which offer key improvements compared to traditional in vitro cell culture models . The ability to chemically modify hydrogels and change their network structure enables the creation of gels with highly tailored mechanical properties that are suitable for a range of applications within the cardiovascular ﬁeld . Hydrogels can also be adapted to include conductive polymers , forming electroconductive gels capable of promoting regeneration of cardiac tissue and repair due to restoration of electrical coupling between cardiac cells , as found in the native myocardium . Furthermore , hydrogels can be employed as therapeutic strategies in 3D contexts , with cardiac cells encapsulated in hydrogels and injected into the body for regenerative purposes [ 101 , 102 ] . Other techniques can further enhance the ﬁdelity of ECM models . For example , micropatterning of substrates can improve cell alignment , structural organisation and contractility , thus serving as a maturation strategy for iPSC - CMs [ 76 , 87 , 103 ] . Nano pillar electrode structures have also been used to improve maturity . A recent study reported a correlation between nanopillars and matured morphology of CMs through inducing differentiation via cytoskeleton rearrangement and F - actin assembly [ 104 ] . Nanopillar electrodes have also been utilised for iPSC - CM electrophysiological measurements , cap - turing intracellular action potentials across multiple cells [ 105 ] . Further models such as engineered heart tissue ( EHTs ) or engineered muscle tissue develop 3D culture systems by using a combination of cardiomyocytes and FBs to form 3D models of the myocardium , which are reﬂective of cardiac physiology [ 89 , 106 ] .
