Due to clinical conditions of each application , there is a need for continued improvement of HSC mobilization regimens . Previous studies have shown that genetic ablation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 in HSCs results in their mobilization without affecting survival . Here we rationally identi ﬁ ed a C dc42 a ctivity - s peci ﬁ c in hibitor ( CASIN ) that can bind to Cdc42 with submicromolar af ﬁ nity and competitively interfere with guanine nucleotide exchange activity . CASIN inhibits intracellular Cdc42 activity speci ﬁ cally and transiently to induce murine hematopoietic stem / progenitor cell egress from the BM by suppressing actin polymerization , adhesion , and directional migration of stem / progenitor cells , conferring Cdc42 knockout phenotypes . We further show that , although , CASIN administration to mice mobilizes similar number of phenotypic HSCs as AMD3100 , it produces HSCs with better long - term reconstitution potential than that by AMD3100 . Our work validates a speci ﬁ c small molecule inhibitor for Cdc42 , and demonstrates that signaling molecules downstream of cytokines and chemokines , such as Cdc42 , constitute a useful target for long - term stem cell mobilization . Introduction Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) are a rare population of cells residing in a unique bone marrow ( BM ) micro - environment ( also known as niche ) , that undergo a complex but highly ordered hematopoiesis program throughout the life - span of mammals [ 1 – 5 ] . In addition to supporting blood cell development , HSCs are characterized by their self - renewal ability , a property that explains the mostly conserved HSC numbers found in animals [ 1 , 4 , 6 ] . HSC transplantation has become a standard care for the treatment of many hematologic malignancies , including chemotherapy sensitive relapsed acute leukemia or lym - phoma , and for some non - malignant diseases , such as BM failure in Fanconi anemia [ 7 – 11 ] . Under physiological conditions , few HSCs circulate in peripheral blood ( PB ) [ 12 ] . The induced movement of HSCs from BM into PB is termed HSC mobilization . Mobilized PB stem cells have become a preferred stem cell source for autologous transplantation , and are widely used for allogeneic stem cell transplantation [ 13 – 16 ] .

However , broad inter - individual variability exists in response to this mobilization regimen , and poor HSC mobilization in response to G - CSF is often found in patients who have been treated for cancer or who have genetic disorders [ 8 , 9 , 17 ] . AMD3100 , a CXCR4 antago - nist , has been used alone or in combination with G - SCF to mobilize stem cells [ 18 – 21 ] . A recent study found that AMD3100 mobilizes a different set of HSCs than G - CSF [ 19 ] , raising the possibility that the PB stem cells collected by these two regimens may have different properties . Indeed , a more recent study using AMD3100 in combina - tion with CXCR2 agonist , GRO β shows a preferential traf ﬁ cking of stem cells with high - engraftment ef ﬁ ciency resulted from synergistic signaling on neutrophils [ 22 ] . Hence , development of new methods to mobilize HSCs , alone or in combination with existing regimens , will con - tinue to have therapeutic value to further improve transplant outcomes . The Rho family small GTPase Cdc42 regulates actin organization , cell – cell and cell - extracellular matrix adhe - sions , and directional movement in many cell types [ 23 , 24 ] . In HSCs , Cdc42 integrates signals from multiple cell surface receptors — including c - Kit , CXCR4 , and β 1 integrin — to regulate cytoskeleton dynamics that affects cell polarity , adhesion and migration properties in normal HSC maintenance [ 25 – 27 ] . Unlike the related Rac1 and Rac2 GTPases [ 28 , 29 ] , Cdc42 is not required for HSC survival or proliferation but is essential in mediating HSC homing , lodging , and retention in the bone marrow niche [ 25 ] . Studies of a Cdc42 gain - of - activity using the Cdc42GAP knockout mouse model have revealed that constitutively elevated Cdc42 activity similarly causes defective adhesion and migration leading to decreased engraftment of HSCs [ 30 ] , suggesting that a precise reg - ulation of Cdc42 activity is required for retaining HSCs in the BM niche . The current studies are aimed to develop a new concept , i . e . , pharmacologic targeting of Cdc42 is of therapeutic value for effective mobilization of LT - HSCs thus bene ﬁ ting stem cell harvest , in preclinical mouse models . Our work not only stringently examines the effect of Cdc42 targeting in HSC mobilization , but also validates a lead small molecule inhibitor speci ﬁ c for Cdc42 activity that could be broadly useful to study biological and pathological roles of Cdc42 in blood and other tissue cells . Materials and methods Animals C57Bl / 6 and congenic BoyJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . Animals were maintained in the animal barrier facility at the Cincinnati Children ’ s Hospital Medical Center . All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children ’ s Hospital Medical Center prior to study initiation ( IACUC protocol # 2013 – 0159 ) . CASIN CASIN and its inactive analog ( referred to Peterson et al . , as Pirl1 - related compound 2 and 7 , respectively ) [ 31 ] were obtained from Chembridge Corporation , and puri ﬁ ed to > 99 % by high - performance liquid chromatography . For in vitro studies , CASIN ( containing 0 . 02 – 0 . 2 % DMSO ) was used at 2 – 20 µM in IMDM . For in vivo experiments , CASIN was dissolved in PBS with 15 % ethanol , and administered by IP ( 2 . 4 mg / kg ) or IV ( 1 . 2 mg / kg ) injection . Separately , C57Bl / 6 mice were treated with AMD3100 at 5 mg / kg by IP . Flow cytometry HSPCs were immunophenotyped using FACS analysis with the phenotypic antibodies IL - 7R α - APC - cy7 , c - Kit - APC , Sca - 1 - PE , CD34 − FITC , FcRII / III ( CD16 / 32 ) - PE - cy7 , as well as biotinylated lineage - depletion cocktail labeled with the secondary antibody Percp - cy5 - streptividin . The sub - compartments of HSPCs , including LT - HSC and ST - HSC were then quanti ﬁ ed accordingly . Moreover , LT - HSCs are also de ﬁ ned by FCAS analysis using antibodies of LSK as above together with CD150 - PE - cy7 , CD48 / 41 - FITC . Blood cell differentiation was determined by the ﬂ ow cytometry after staining with CD3 , B220 , CD11b , Gr1 , and Ter119 . Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by ﬂ ow cytometry after BrdU labeling and and / or annexinV and 7AAD staining . CFU determination of HPC mobilization C57Bl / 6 mice were mobilized with CASIN ( 1 . 2 mg / kg , IV ) , and progenitor cell numbers in PB were determined at 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , and 4 h post CASIN injection . At each time point , 200 μ l of PB was added to 4 ml of cytokine - containing methylcellulose ( Stem Cell Technologies , Vancouver , Canada ) and plated in triplicate in 35 mm - gridded dishes . Colonies were enumerated 7 days post plating . Separately , C57Bl / 6 mice were treated with AMD3100 at 5 mg / kg by IP or with huG - CSF ( Amgen ) at 12 . 5 μ g / kg in PBS / 0 . 1 % BSA by IP at 100 μ g / kg per day once a day for 5 days and animals were analyzed on day 6 . In the combinatory treat - ment , CASIN was administrated by IV ( 1 . 2 mg / kg ) injec - tion on day 6 of G - CSF regimen or together with AMD3100 and PB samples were analyzed 2 h post CASIN treatment . 750 W .

Recipient CD45 . 1 BoyJ mice ( n = 4 ) were lethally irradiated ( 11 . 75 Gy ) prior to trans - plantation and injected intravenously with PBMC from 500 μ l PB . Morbidity was examined everyday by 2 weeks and weekly until month 4 when the secondary transplan - tation was performed using 5 × 10 6 BM cells of the primary recipients .

Results Cdc42 activity - speci ﬁ c inhibitor , CASIN , speci ﬁ cally inhibits Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange activity In search of a Cdc42 - speci ﬁ c small molecule inhibitor , we examined compounds , including Pir1 that show inhibitory activity in an in vitro Xenopus oocyte lysate assay of actin polymerization induced by Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) [ 31 ] , which may directly involve the Cdc42 - WASP ( Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) signal - ing cascade . An analog of Pir1 , the lead chemical for F - actin inhibition reported by Peterson [ 31 ] , which we term C dc42 a ctivity - s peci ﬁ c in hibitor ( CASIN ; Fig . 1a ) , was found to confer the most active Cdc42 binding activity in an in vitro binding assay , in which puri ﬁ ed proteins were labeled with ﬂ uorescence dye and microscale thermophor - esis were measured by a NanoTemper Monilith Instrument [ 32 ] , in comparison with Pirl1 and another inactive analog ( Fig . 1b , S1 ) . CASIN directly interacted with puri ﬁ ed Cdc42 with an af ﬁ nity of 332 ± 101 nM Kd ( Fig . 1b ) and did not bind to related Rho GTPase RhoA , Rac1 , RhoJ , RhoU , or RhoV , nor the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) intersectin ( Fig . 1b and S2A , S2B ) . In the GEF reaction of Cdc42 catalyzed by the DH - PH module of intersectin GEF , CASIN showed a dose - dependent inhibition of GEF - induced dissociation of GDP from Cdc42 ; whereas in similar experiments CASIN did not affect RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange reaction catalyzed by the RhoA - speci ﬁ c GEF , LARG ( Fig . 1c ) . These data indicate that CASIN binds speci ﬁ cally to Cdc42 - GDP . When CASIN were examined in ﬁ broblast cells , we found that it inhibited bradykinin - induced F - actin morpho - logic changes of wild - type ( WT ) mouse embryonic ﬁ broblast ( MEF ) cells but showed no effect on Cdc42 − / − cells that are resistant to bradykinin stimulation ( Figure S3 ) . Thus , CASIN can directly bind to Cdc42 and speci ﬁ cally inhibit Cdc42 GEF reaction . CASIN inhibits Cdc42 activity , F - actin polymerization , and polarization of blood progenitors To examine the effect of CASIN in inhibiting Cdc42 activity in primary hematopoietic cells , murine low - density bone marrow ( LDBM ) cells were treated with CASIN , and the effect on endogenous Cdc42 - GTP species was deter - mined by an effector - domain pull - down assay [ 27 , 29 ] . As shown in Fig . 2a , 5 μ M CASIN could suppress Cdc42 - GTP formation , but not Rac1 activity , activated by stem cell factor ( SCF ) , Stromal cell - derived factor 1 α ( SDF - 1 α ) or ﬁ bronectin . Further , CASIN caused a dose - dependent inhibition of SDF - 1 α - induced Cdc42 activation without affecting the activity of the closely related Rac1 or RhoA , and removal of CASIN by a wash of the cells restored Cdc42 responsiveness to SDF - 1 α ( Fig . 2b ; data not shown ) . CASIN also induced a dose - dependent suppression of polarized distribution of Cdc42 and tubulin in blood pro - genitor cells ( Fig . 2c ) . Similar effects of CASIN were observed in F - actin polymerization and polarity assays of primitive long - term HSCs ( LT - HSCs ; Fig . 2d , S4 ) . CASIN , on the other hand , did not alter the maturation of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) into multi - lineage progenitors detected by colony - forming assays ( Fig . 2e ) . These results suggest that CASIN can selectively and reversibly inhibit Cdc42 activity regulated by cytokine , chemokine , and adhesion molecules in HPCs without affecting HPC differentiation . CASIN dose - dependently suppresses adhesion and migration of wild - type blood progenitor cells but has no effect on Cdc42 − / − HPCs To further ascertain the functional speci ﬁ city of CASIN , we next examined the effect of CASIN on the Cdc42 - regulated cellular functions in WT and Cdc42 − / − HPCs . In WT but not Cdc42 − / − Lin − BM cells ( enriched for HPCs ) , CASIN was effective in suppressing basal and SDF - 1 α stimulated Cdc42 activity but did not affect Rac1 - GTP formation ( Fig . 3a ) , consistent with our observation that CASIN directly and speci ﬁ cally interacts with puri ﬁ ed Cdc42 but not other Rho GTPases , including Rac1 and RhoA ( Fig . 1b , S2 ) . CASIN treatment of Lin − BM cells led to a dose - dependent inhibition of adhesion to ﬁ bronectin by colony - forming cells , and impairment of directional migration toward a SDF - 1 α gradient by colony - forming unit ( CFU ) cells , mimicking that of Cdc42 gene deletion when it was Rational identi ﬁ cation of a Cdc42 inhibitor presents a new regimen for long - term hematopoietic stem . . . 751 used at a higher dosage ( Fig . 3b , c ) . While CASIN dose - dependently suppressed adhesion and directional migration activities of WT Lin − BM cells to the extent of Cdc42 − / − cells , no additive cellular effects of CASIN in these assays were detected upon CASIN treatment of Cdc42 − / − Lin − BM cells ( Fig . 3b , c ) . More importantly , CASIN treatment did not affect proliferation of WT or Cdc42 − / − LDBM cells ( Fig . 3d ) , allowing Cdc42 − / − cells to retain a higher pro - liferative activity than WT cells as previously observed [ 25 ] . In primary HPCs , CASIN inhibited several known Cdc42 downstream - signaling events , including phosphor - PAK1 , phosphor - WASP , and phosphor - aPKC , similar to that by Cdc42 gene deletion ( Fig . 3e ) . Together , these results indicate that CASIN suppresses adhesion and migration but does not affect the proliferation of HPCs . Importantly , CASIN does not appear to have detectable effects on Cdc42 − / − bone marrow cells . CASIN speci ﬁ cally inhibits Cdc42 activity and Cdc42 - mediated signaling in HSPCs To probe for the molecular mechanism of CASIN action , we transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) from Cdc42 − / − mice with lentiviral vector expressing a constitutive active Cdc42 mutant , Q61L ( Cdc42 - Q61L ) , and found that CASIN was incapable of Fig . 1 Chemical and genetic evidence that CASIN speci ﬁ cally and reversibly inhibits Cdc42 activity . a Chemical structure of CASIN . b Microscale thermophoresis measurement of CASIN binding to puri ﬁ ed Cdc42 protein . Fluorescently labeled Cdc42 , Rac1 , or RhoA ( 200 nM ) was subjected to titration of increasing concentrations of CASIN . The relative changes in thermophoresis were traced . Results are representative of at least three independent experiments . c Guanine nucleotide exchange reaction was performed using ﬂ uor - escent BODIPY FL - GDP bound to Cdc42 ( 50 nM ) , catalyzed by intersectin ( INTN ; 9 nM ) ( left ) or using ﬂ uorescent BODIPY FL - GDP bound to RhoA ( 50 nM ) , catalyzed by LARG ( 10 nM ) ( right ) in the presence or absence of CASIN ( 5 or 25 µM ) . Results are representative of at least three independent experiments 752 W . Liu et al . suppressing F - actin polymerization in Cdc42 − / − HSPCs expressing the Cdc42 - Q61L mutant protein ( Fig . 4a ) , sug - gesting that CASIN acts at the activation site but not the effector site of Cdc42 . We also carried out a simulation of CASIN binding to the Cdc42 three - dimensional ( 3D ) structure and found that CASIN can interact with a surface groove of Cdc42 that is required for interaction with GEFs such as DOCK180 ( Fig . 4b ) . Further , mutational analysis of surface residues of Cdc42 reveals that Cdc42 - M45E mutation at the GEF action site resulted in a loss of the binding activity to CASIN in vitro ( Fig . 4c ) and the unresponsiveness to CASIN in cells where endogenous WT Cdc42 was readily inhibited by CASIN ( Fig . 4d ) . Collectively , these results indicate that CASIN selectively inhibits Cdc42 activity and Cdc42 - mediated signaling in HSPCs . CASIN induces mobilization of HSCs in mice Adult HSCs reside primarily in the BM , with only a small faction in the peripheral blood ( PB ) under normal physio - logic conditions [ 3 , 12 , 33 ] . Previous gene targeting Rational identi ﬁ cation of a Cdc42 inhibitor presents a new regimen for long - term hematopoietic stem . . . 753 experiments in mice have found that Cdc42 knockout in mice results in massive mobilization of HSCs from the BM to the peripheral [ 25 ] . To examine whether CASIN could mobilize HSCs in mice , we applied a protocol of intrave - nous ( IV ) injection of CASIN to C57Bl / 6 mice . Pharma - cokinetic analysis indicates that CASIN concentration in the serum of injected animals was quickly reduced from 20 μ M to less than the effective concentration of 0 . 5 μ M in ~ 30 min ( Fig . 5a , S5 ) , suggesting that the effect of CASIN is tran - sient . IV injection of CASIN in mice resulted in a marked inhibition of Cdc42 activity in LDBM hematopoietic cells in vivo ( Fig . 5b ) . Colony - forming unit in culture ( CFU - C ) assay showed that CASIN was able to induce a fourfold increase of progenitor activities in the peripheral blood ( PB ) compared to controls 2 h after CASIN injection ( Fig . 5c ) . Concomitant with the CASIN - induced increase in colony - forming activity in PB , a signi ﬁ cant increase in progenitor activity was observed in spleen and liver of the mice ( Fig . 5d ) . Consistent with the lack of effect on Cdc42 − / − cells in vitro , the effect of CASIN in mobilizing HPCs appears to be speci ﬁ c through Cdc42 , as CASIN administration showed no additive effect on mobilized CFU - C activity in Cdc42 − / − mice ( Fig . 5e ) . To examine potential toxicity of transient CASIN treat - ment , both long - term IV and IP injection protocols of CASIN into mice in a broad range of dosages ( 0 . 1 – 5 mg / kg ) were tested . No detectable toxicity on multi - lineage blood differentiation were observed by either H & E staining or marker FACS analysis of the BM , liver , spleen , and PB up to a period of 6 months of daily injection ( Figure S6 and data not shown ) . Further , CASIN does not appear to alter the survival or cell cycle status ( Figure S7 and data not shown ) and mobilizes BM HSPCs that confer all different lineages of cells ( Fig . 5f ) in the treated mice . Taken toge - ther , these results demonstrate that CASIN is safe and effective in mobilizing blood progenitors in vivo . CASIN - mobilized HSCs are superior in functionality to those mobilized by AMD3100 Cytokine granulocyte colony - stimulating factor , G - CSF and a CXCR4 antagonist , AMD3100 have become the standard of care in mobilizing HSCs for transplantation . AMD3100 has been clinically used alone or in combination with G - SCF to mobilize stem cells [ 18 – 21 ] . To determine the potential applicability of CASIN in preclinical settings , we then attempted to compare the mobilization capacity of CASIN , over AMD3100 or G - CSF . In a progenitor colony - forming unit ( CFU ) activity assay , we found that all 3 agents were able to mobilize progenitor cells from BM to peripheral blood , with G - CSF treated mice showing the greatest CFU activity in PB ( Fig . 6a ) . Since G - CSF has non - responders and potential issue on growth stimulation in the clinics , and since G - CSF administration requires a distinct 5 - day injection protocol , we decided to focus on a comparison of CASIN with AMD3100 , a small molecule antagonist of CXCR4 which shares signaling with Cdc42 and requires only a single injection [ 34 ] . We found that CASIN administration led to a ~ 6 - fold increase of pheno - typically de ﬁ ned LT - HSCs ( LSKCD150 + CD48 − CD41 − ) in PB 2 h after IV injection , whereas AMD3100 caused a ~ 5 - fold increase of mobilization of phenotypic HSCs ( Fig . 6b ) . More importantly , we sought to determine the functionality of the HSCs mobilized by CASIN or AMD3100 . To this end , PB harvested from the vehicle , CASIN or AMD3100 - treated mice were analyzed in a transplant assay to determine radioprotection by trans - planted HSCs in lethally irradiated recipient mice . Both the CASIN and AMD3100 mobilized HSPCs were found capable of rescuing lethally irradiated mice , while trans - plant of PB from vehicle - treated mice resulted in death of the recipients in 4 weeks ( data not shown ) . The primary recipients of transplanted PB from CASIN or AMD3100 mobilized mice showed comparable , over 80 % Fig . 2 CASIN inhibits Cdc42 activity , F - actin polymerization and cell polarity of hematopoietic cells . a Isolated low - density bone marrow ( LDBM ) cells from WT C57Bl / 6 mice were cultured overnight in a medium without cytokines .

Results are means ± SD from three independent experiments . c Effect of CASIN on the polarity of blood progenitors . CASIN at indicated increasing concentrations was added to cultured Lin - Kit + progenitors of WT C57Bl / 6 mice , and the polarized distributions of endogenous Cdc42 and Tubulin were quanti ﬁ ed after immuno ﬂ uorescent staining for Cdc42 and Tubulin , respectively . Results are representative of at least three independent experiments . d Effects of CASIN on F - actin polymerization in long - term ( LT ) - HSCs . Freshly isolated Lin - Sca1 + Kit + CD34 − Flk2 − LT - HSCs from WT C57Bl / 6 mice were incubated for 16 h in medium without growth factors in the present or absence of the indicated concentrations of CASIN . The cells were then stimulated with SDF - 1 α ( 100 ng / mL ) for 15 min before ﬁ xation . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of F - actin by Fluorescein - phalloidin and Nuclei with DAPI were carried out . Cells with polymerized cortical F - actin distribution were quanti ﬁ ed . n = 20 – 25 cells in each group . Results are representative of at least three independent experiments . e CASIN does not alter the BFU - E , CFU - GM , or CFU - GEMM activity of WT C57Bl / 6 LDBM cells . LDMCs were treated with different doses of CASIN for 2 h followed by CFU assay using methycellulose medium supplemented with rmSCF , rmIL - 3 , rhIL - 6 , and ehEPO in triplicate in 35 mm - grid - ded dishes . Colonies were enumerated on day 7 . Results are repre - sentative of at least three independent experiments 754 W . Liu et al . donor - derived blood cells in PB and BM in multiple lineages ( Fig . 6c and Figures S8A , S8B ) . Remarkably , the CASIN - mobilized HSCs reconstituted over 90 % of the LSKCD34 − compartment in the primary recipients ( Fig . 6d ) , indicating a long - term reconstitution potential of CASIN - mobilized HSCs . In addition , expression of CD26 in LSK population of BM cells or serum SDF - 1 α level did not change after CASIN injection ( Figures S8C , S8D ) , suggesting that CASIN does not affect CD26 - mediated effects like G - CSF or serum SDF - 1 α content [ 35 , 36 ] . Although CASIN displayed only a slight improvement in mobilization capacity for phenotypic HSCs over AMD3100 ( sixfold vs ﬁ vefold ; Fig . 6b ) , secondary transplant of the BM cells from primary recipients showed that CASIN - mobilized HSCs were superior in quality to those mobilized by AMD3100 , as they were able to maintain over 90 % PB or BM chimerism of various lineages in the secondary recipients 6 months post transplant , whereas AMD3100 - mobilized PB resulted in only ~ 15 % and 35 % chimerism in the BM and PB , respectively ( Fig . 6e , f ) . When CASIN was applied to mice in combination with AMD3100 or G - CSF , an additive effect in mobilizing HSPCs to PB was detected by CFU assays ( Fig . 6g , h ) . Taken together , these data show that pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 by CASIN leads to a transient mobili - zation of LT - HSCs with a superior quality .

Current clinical HSC mobilization utilizes only G - CSF and less frequently AMD3100 as mobilization agents with limitations in ef ﬁ cacy and patient application [ 9 , 17 , 19 , 21 ] . There is a great need for improved HSC mobili - zation regimens . We report here that the chemical inhibitor CASIN speci ﬁ cally and reversibly inhibits Cdc42 activity , which can transiently mobilize long - term engraftable HSCs . There are several ﬁ ndings that highlight the signi ﬁ cance of our study : ( 1 ) CASIN binds speci ﬁ cally to Cdc42 and competitively interferes with its guanine nucleotide exchange activity ; ( 2 ) CASIN reversibly inhibits Cdc42 activity by suppressing actin polymerization , adhesion , and directional migration ; ( 3 ) CASIN transiently mimics Cdc42 knockout phenotype in inducing HSPC egress from mouse BM ; ( 4 ) CASIN administration to mice mobilizes HSCs with better long - term reconstitution potential than those mobilized by AMD3100 . Core values of a chemical inhibitor or probe include its speci ﬁ city and reversibility , which are the causal factors for side effects or toxicity . We demonstrated that CASIN can speci ﬁ cally and transiently inhibit Cdc42 activity without notable effects on the closely related Rac1 or RhoA . To date , several Cdc42 inhibitors have been reported . The ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed small molecule ML141 ( CID - 2950007 ) has been shown to inhibit nucleotide binding of Cdc42 GTPase ; however , ML141 also exhibits low - micromolar potency and selectivity against other members of the Rho family of Fig . 4 CASIN speci ﬁ cally inhibits Cdc42 activity and Cdc42 - mediated signaling in HSPCs . a SDF - 1 α - induced F - actin polymerization ana - lyzed by FACS analysis ( n = 3 ) in WT murine Lin − cells with or without CASIN treatment ( 0 , 5 , 10 μ M ) , in comparison to that of Q61L - transduced or Cdc42 − / − cells .

Liu et al . GTPases , including Rac1 , Rab2 , and Rab7 [ 37 , 38 ] . In addition , recent studies show that ML141 fails to sub - stantially reduce Cdc42 activity and alleviate cell migration [ 39 ] . The second Cdc42 inhibitor AZA1 suppresses both Cdc42 and Rac1 activities in a dose - dependent manner [ 40 ] . Another small molecule , ZCL278 speci ﬁ cally targets Cdc42 - intersectin interaction and inhibits Cdc42 - mediated cellular processes , but its action is not reversible [ 41 ] . Finally an inhibitor targeting the activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 2 ( ACK - 2 ) not only binds Cdc42 in the GTP - bound form but also interacts with clathrin and in ﬂ uences clathrin assembly [ 42 , 43 ] . In the present study , we show that CASIN speci ﬁ cally binds to puri ﬁ ed Cdc42 protein but does not bind to other Rho GTPases , including RhoA , Rac1 , RhoJ , RhoU or RhoV , nor the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) intersectin ( Fig . 1b , c and S2 ) . Furthermore , CASIN inhibits Bradykinin - induced ﬁ lopodia formation mediated by Cdc42 in WT cells but shows no effect on Cdc42 − / − cells ( Figure S3 ) . More importantly , CASIN does not show any detectable effects on Cdc42 − / − HSPCs in multiple functional assays , and CASIN admin - istration to mice mimics Cdc42 knockout to transiently mobilize HSCs and shows no detectable toxicity ( Figure S6 , S7 ) nor effects on multi - lineage blood differentiation ( Fig S8 ) . Since CASIN has a rather shorter lifetime by the i . v . injection protocol ( Figures S5 ) and since Cdc42 activity is transiently and reversibly suppressed by CASIN , CASIN can be repeatedly administered to transplant recipients without causing insensitivity . Therefore , the stringent cri - teria in speci ﬁ city and reversibility demonstrated by CASIN distinguishes it from other Cdc42 chemical inhibitors . Another intriguing ﬁ nding of our study is that CASIN appears superior to AMD3100 in producing functional long - term HSCs in the mouse transplantation model . Previous studies have demonstrated that while Cdc42 inhibitor ML141 , which inhibits nucleotide binding of Cdc42 alone only triggers modest HSPC mobilization , combination of G - CSF and ML141 signi ﬁ cantly increases HSPC counts and colony - forming units in PB , as compared to mice treated with G - CSF alone [ 44 ] . This might be , at least in part , due to non - speci ﬁ c nature of ML141 . Our present results demonstrate that CASIN speci ﬁ cally inhibits Cdc42 activity through inhibiting Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange activity . Although , the PB containing mobilized HSCs from both CASIN - and AMD3100 - treated donor mice were cap - able of rescuing the lethally irradiated primary recipient mice , the CASIN - mobilized PB was able to maintain over 90 % PB or BM chimerism of various lineages , including the stem cell - enriched LSK compartment , in the secondary recipients 6 months post transplant . In comparison , the AMD3100 - mobilized PB resulted in only ~ 15 % and 35 % chimerism in the BM and PB , respectively , and almost undetectable donor LSK cell population in the BM of the secondary recipients ( Fig . 6 ) . It should be noted that our study compared the effects of CASIN to those with a single dose of AMD3100 . In this context , further detailed optimi - zation of CASIN mobilization protocol compared with the AMD3100 multi - dosage protocol may reveal additional dif - ferences and similarities . Our results with CASIN in mobi - lizing functional HSCs anchors a recent study reporting that a CXCR2 agonist , GRO β in combination with AMD3100 are more effective than G - CSF in mobilizing engraftable HSCs in mice [ 22 ] . However , GRO β + AMD3100 shows disadvantage in mobilizing total hematopoietic progenitor ( LSK ) cells and phenotypic ( SLAM LSK ) HSCs compared to G - CSF [ 22 ] . Thus , it seems that CASIN , acting as a single agent , can be as potent as the combination regimen of GRO β + AMD3100 in mobilizing functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from the BM to the peripheral . Our present study demonstrates that CASIN is safe and effective in mobilizing blood progenitors in vivo Fig . 6 CASIN - mobilized HSCs are superior in functionality to those mobilized by AMD3100 . a Mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor CFU activities in peripheral blood post - CASIN , AMD3100 or G - CSF injection . PB from the mice treated with CASIN ( 1 . 2 mg / kg , IV ) , AMD3100 ( 5 mg / kg , IP ) , or G - CSF injection ( 100 μ g / kg per day once a day for 5 days , IP ) were subjected to CFU assay .

In addition to its application in mouse model , we recently show that CASIN effectively and transiently mobilizes xenografted human CD34 + hemato - poietic progenitor cells to the PB 1 h after injection [ 45 ] . Furthermore , conditioning with CASIN signi ﬁ cantly facil - itates engraftment of human blood progenitors in a trans - plant model without any myeloablation [ 45 ] . Although further improvement on its potency and better under - standing the bene ﬁ ts of its short half - life ( reversibility ) in vivo are needed , we believe that CASIN may represent a safe and improved pre - conditioning agent for future human hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . A major challenge for successful BM transplantation is effective mobilization and harvesting of donor HSCs with suf ﬁ cient number and functional quality . Novel methods of HSC mobilization and improved engraftment are needed for treatment of blood diseases through BM transplantation , especially for BM failure and leukemia patients who have limited stem cell numbers and are intolerable to intensive pre - conditioning regimens . In this report , we provide evidence that CASIN speci ﬁ cally and transiently inhibits Cdc42 activity and acts as a single agent to effectively mobilizing phenotypic and functional HSCs to the peripheral . Since our previous genetic studies have established that Cdc42 is essential for the retention of HSCs in the BM niche [ 25 , 26 ] , CASIN may prove to be a new method for blood stem cell collect and transplantation that may signi ﬁ cantly impact on future BM transplantation . Speci ﬁ cally , CASIN would improve both sides of the transplant practice — providing a new way to mobilize HSCs from donors and improving engraftment ef ﬁ ciency in recipients without increasing treatment - related toxicity .
