Treated cells underwent apoptosis with specific DNA fragmentation . Direct injection of the p53 - adenovirus con struct into H358 tumors s . c . implanted into nu / nu mice , followed by i . p . administration of cisplatin , Induced massive apoptotic destruction of the tumors . These results support the clinical application of a regimen corn blaing gene replacement using replication - deficient wild - type p5 . 3adeno viiiis and DNA - damaging drugs for treatment of human cancer . Introduction The biochemical features of programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) show a characteristic pattern of DNA fragmentation resulting from cleavage of nuclear DNA . Recent studies have demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs or ionizing radia tion may be related to the status of the p . 53 gene and that DNA damagingstimuliareableto elevateintracellularp53proteinlevelsin cells that are in the process of apoptosis ( 1â€”5 ) . Inhibition of the cell cycle at G @ by increased levels of the wt - p533 protein allows more timefor DNArepair ; if optimalrepairis impossible , p53maytrigger programmed cell death . Thus , p53 may contribute to the induction of apoptotic tumor cell death by chemotherapeutic agents . Inactivation of thep53 gene by missense mutation or deletion is the most common genetic alteration in human cancers ( 6 , 7 ) . The loss of p53 function has been reported to enhance cellular resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents ( 8 ) . Our preliminary experiments showed that human NSCLC H358 cells , in which both alleles of p53 are deleted , were resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs , whereas cell line WTH226b , which has endogenous wt - p53 , readily showed apop totic cell death 16 h after treatment with CDDP and etoposide . 4 Therefore , we sought to determine whether the introduction of the wt - p53 gene into H358 cells by an adenoviral vector could increase Received 1 / 31 / 94 ; accepted 3 / 18 / 94 .

The constructionand identificationof Ad - p53or Ad - Luc were reported previously ( 10 ) . Briefly , the p53 expression cassette that contains human cytomegalovirus promoter , wt - p53 cDNA , and SV4O early polyadenylation signal was inserted between the XbaI and CIa ] sites of pXCJL . 1 . The p53 shuttle vector and the recombinant plasmid pJM17 were cotransfected into 293 cells ( AdS - transformed human embryonic kidney cell line ) by a liposome - mediatedtechnique . The culturesupernatantof 293 cells showingthecompletecytopathiceffectwas collectedandusedforsubsequent infections . The control Ad - Luc virus was generated in a similar manner . Ad - p53 and Ad - Luc viruses were propagated in 293 cells . The presence of replication - competent virus was excluded by HeLa cell assays . The viral titers were determined by plaque assays ( 11 ) . Detection of Nucleosomal DNA FragrnentaUon . DNA was isolated from parental , Ad - Luc - infected , and Ad - p53 - infected cells that did or did not receive CDDP treatment , by incubating cells at 55Â°Cfor 6 h in lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM EDTA , 100 mM NaC1 , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , and 50 @ WmlproteinaseK ] . DNA was extractedtwice with equal volumes of phenolandonce with chloroform - isoamylalcohol ( 24 : 1 ) andthen precipitated in ethanol . Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 . 5 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . TdT - mediated dUTP nick end labeling was performed according to a procedure reported previously ( 12 ) . Monolayer cells were treated with 0 . 01 % Nnonidet P40 . The slides were immersed in TdT buffer [ 30 mMTris - HCI ( pH 7 . 2 ) - 140 mMsodium cacodylate - 1mMcobalt chloride ] and incubatedwith biotinylated dUTP ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) and TdT at 37Â°C for 45 mm . The slides were covered with 2 % bovine serum albumin for 10mm and incubated with avidin - biotin complex ( Vectastain Elite Kit ; Vector Lab oratories , Burlingame , CA ) for 30 mm . The colorimetric detection was per formed by using diamino - benzidine . Resultsand Discussion H358 cells were transduced in vitro with the human wt - p53 cDNA by exposure to Ad - p53 . Western blot analysis showed a high level of wt - p53 protein expression as early as 24 h after infection with Ad - p53 , but no wt - p53 was detected in parental ( uninfected ) cells or control cells infected with Ad - Luc ( data not shown ) . Concurrent immunohistochemical evaluation demon strated detectable wt - p53 protein in more than 80 % of infected cells , suggesting that the transfer and expression of p53 by AD - p53 was highly efficient ( data not shown ) . Continuous exposure of Ad - p53 - infected H358 cells to CDDP reduced their viability rapidly , whereas significant cell death for parental and Ad - Luc - infected cells occurred only after 72 h of expo sure to CDDP ( Fig . IA ) .

The fmding that exposure to CDDP reduced the size of 11358 spheroids infected with Ad - p53 by inducing apoptosis on the surface suggests that Ad - p53 infects nonproliferating cells and that CDDP initiates the apoptotic process in quiescent cells . In an effort to determine the efficacy of a combination of gene replacement therapy and chemotherapy in human cancer , we exam med whether sequential administration of Ad - p53 and CDDP could induce apoptosis in vivo . Following 3 days of direct intratumoral injection of Ad - p53 or i . p . administration of CDDP , H358 tumors implanted s . c . into nu / nu mice showed a modest slowing of growth .

After 24 h , 100 pJ of medium , Ad - Luc viral stock ( 10Â°PFU / ml ) , or Ad - p53 viral stock ( 10Â°PFU / ml ) were added .

Cells were exposed to CDDP ( A ) continuously or ( B ) for 24 h followed by recovery in drug - free medium . Cells that remained as an attached monolayer were assessed for viability over 5 days by measuring trypan blue uptake .

A 24h 48 h II UI - + - + cells transduced with Ad - p53 . Moreover , the reduction of viability could be observed even when cells were maintained in drug - free medium after 24 h of exposure , suggesting that lethal damage could be induced within 24 h ( Fig . 1B ) . The sensitivity of wt - p53 - transduced H358 cells to CDDP was dose dependent ( Fig . 1C ) . An internucleosomal DNA ladder indicative of DNA fragmen tation was evident in cells expressing wt - p53 after 24 h of exposure to CDDP ; parental and Ad - Luc - infected cells , however , did not show DNA fragmentation ( Fig . 14 ) . TdT - mediated dUTP - biotin nick end labeling , which detects DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in situ , showed many apoptotic cells in Ad - p53 - infected cells treated with CDDP for 24 has shown in Fig . 2G which demonstrates darkly staining nuclei and nuclear fragments not present in Fig . 2 , Bâ€”F . Introduction of wt - p53 is known to induce apoptosis in some types of tumor cell lines with deleted or mutated p53 ( 13â€”15 ) . However , overexpression of wt - p53 alone could not promote DNA fragmenta tion in our p53 - negative H358 cell line ( Fig . 2 ) , although their growth was suppressed by Ad - p53 ( Fig . 1 ) . This is compatible with our previous studies showing that stable H358 clones could be obtained after retrovirus - mediated wt - p53 transfer and that the clones grew more slowly than parental cells ( 16 ) . The potential therapeutic efficacy of the combination of Ad - p53 and CDDP was evaluated in terms of the relative change in volume of H358 spheroids . The multicellular tumor spheroid model exhibits in vitro a histological structure similar to that of primary tumors and micrometastases . Treatment with CDDP caused a reduction of relative volume in Ad - p53 - infected H358 spheroids but had no significant effect on parental or Ad - Luc - infected spheroids ( Fig . 3A ) . In situ TdT - mediated dUTP labeling showed many cells in the process of apoptosis on the surface of Ad - p53 - infected spheroids , whereas no apoptotic cells were seen on spheroids not infected with Ad - p53 ( Fig . 3 , Bâ€”E ) . We reported previously that retroviral - mediated wt - p53 expression inhibited growth of H322a spheroids induced by trans forming growth factor a ( TGF - a ) ( 17 ) . The retroviral vector could not infect H358 spheroids , however , because cells in these spheroids did â€˜ . , @ : . @ , - @ ( @ _ - . 1 - @ @ I - - @ . # : â€˜ @ @ @ @ â€˜ . - : @ @ 4 - @ . p44 , s @ i . @ - @ : : . . @ - - @ - @ : - - â€¢ â€¢ @ â€¢ @ @ â€¢1 â€¢ . . . - . 0 @ â€˜a C @ @ â€¢ i e - @ ! @ @ @ s _ @ @ t @ . s @ , Â° 4 - @ ' a @ . a - s - @ â€œ . . @ @ . . . . â€˜ . . . . @ @ 4pâ€¢ . . @ . . - s @ - - - . - . - - @ . . . - . â€˜ . @ 4 . - @ - . t @ S , - ( @ 4I .

Histological examination revealed a mas sive destruction of tumor cells in the area where Ad - p53 was injected in mice treated with CDDP . In situ staining demonstrated many apoptotic cells around acellular spaces ( Fig . 4 , Bâ€”E ) . In contrast , tumors treated with CDDP alone or Ad - p53 alone showed neither acellularity nor apoptotic areas . This report describes a novel strategy for human gene therapy combined with conventional chemotherapy using a DNA cross - link ingagent . Tumorcellresistanceto chemotherapeuticdrugsrepresents a major problem in clinical oncology . NSCLC accounts for at least 80 % of thecasesof lungcancer ; patientswithNSCLCare , however , generally unresponsive to chemotherapy ( 18 ) . One goal of current cancer research is to fmd ways to improve the efficacy of gene replacement therapy for cancer by investigating interaction between the gene product and chemotherapeutic drugs . The herpes simplex thymidine kinase ( HS - tK ) gene , when delivered to brain tumors by a retroviral vector system , successfully induced susceptibility to the antiviral agent ganciclovir ( 19 ) . The HS - tK gene product is an exog enous viral enzyme , whereas the wt - p53 protein is expressed in normal tissues , suggesting that the modulation of chemoresistance by alterations in wt - p53 expression might be an alternative approach using a pathway mediated by an endogenous genetic program . An adenovirus system has potential advantages for gene delivery in vivo , such as ease of producing high titer virus , high infection efficiency , and infectivity for many types of cells . The stability and duration of expression of the introduced gene are still controver sial , however . For chemo - gene therapy , the levels of expression and the high infectivity may be more significant than the duration of expression because drugs can kill infected cells within several days .

Murray chemotherapeutic drugs can occur within 6 h after DNA - damaging References stimuli ( 3 , 20 ) , although increased p53 DNA binding activity can be reversed over the course of 4 h if the stimulus is removed ( 21 ) . In our model , the expression of the wt - p53 gene is driven mdc pendently by the cytomegalovirus promoter contained in an Ad p53 vector . Therefore , a high level of p53 expression can be maintained even after cessation of drug exposure . The expression of wt - p53 protein by Ad - p53 peaks at postinfection day 3 ( 14 - fold greater than endogenous wild - type ) and decreases to a low level by day 9 ( 22 ) . This suggests that a transiently high level of wt - p53 expression is sufficient to initiate the cytotoxic program in the cancer cell . Our data indicate that p53 has an important role as a determinant of chemosensitivity in human lung cancer cells . A variety of treatment protocols , including surgery , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy , have been tried for human NSCLC , but the long - term survival rate remains unsatisfactory . The combination therapy we present here might be effective as an adjuvant treatment to prevent local recurrence follow ing primary tumor resection or as a treatment that could be given by intralesional injections in drug - resistant primary , metastatic , or locally recurrent lung cancer . Protocols are being developed to explore these clinical applications . 2290 I â€˜ @ j 10 Jo on April 20 , 2017 . © 1994 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from CHEMOSENSI11VITYINDUCED BY GENE TRANSFER ( ed ) , Methods in Molecular Biology , Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols , pp . 109â€”128 .
