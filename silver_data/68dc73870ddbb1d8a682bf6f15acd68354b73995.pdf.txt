At the cleavage furrow , the phosphoinositide PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 plays an important role by recruiting and regulating essential proteins of the cytokinesis machinery [ 1 ] . Accordingly , perturbation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 regulation leads to abortive furrow - ing and binucleation [ 2 – 4 ] . To determine how PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is regulated during cytokinesis , we individually knocked down each of the enzymes controlling the phosphoinositide ( PIP ) cycle in Drosophila . We show that depletion of the Drosophila ortholog of human oculocerebrorenal syndrome of L owe 1 ( OCRL1 ) , an inositol 5 - phosphatase mutated in the X - linked disorder oculocerebrorenal Lowe syndrome , trig - gers a high rate of cytokinesis failure . In absence of dOCRL , several essential components of the cleavage furrow were found to be incorrectly localized on giant cytoplasmic vacu - oles rich in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and in endocytic markers . We demon - strate that dOCRL is associated with endosomes and that it dephosphorylates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on internal membranes to restrict this phosphoinositide at the plasma membrane and thereby regulates cleavage furrow formation and ingression . Identiﬁcation of dOCRL as essential for cell division may be important to understand the molecular basis of the pheno - typic manifestations of Lowe syndrome . Results and Discussion dOCRL , the Drosophila Ortholog of OCRL1 , Is Required for Cell Division To identify whichof theenzymes controlling thePI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 cycle are essential for cytokinesis , we individually depleted the 34 Drosophila putative kinases ( 13 ) , phosphatases ( 16 ) , and phospholipases ( 5 ) that directly or indirectly regulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels , and we recorded cell divisions in an a - tubulin - GFP Drosophila S2 cell line [ 5 ] . Among these enzymes , inactivation of CG9115 and CG3573 led to a signiﬁcant increase in cytoki - nesis failure ( see Figures S1A and S1C available online ) . Whereas the myotubularin CG9115 has already been impli - cated in cell - cycle progression [ 6 ] , we report here the ﬁrst evidence that the inositol 5 - phosphatase CG3573 is important for cytokinesis . The cytokinesis defects observed in the ab - sence of CG3573 function correlated with the appearance of giant multinucleated cells , with cells that can reach ten times the size of control cells ( Figure 1A ) . The CG3573 gene encodes a protein of 850 amino acids that we named dOCRL after one of its two human orthologs , OCRL1 ( oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe 1 ) ( Figure S1B ) . dOCRL comprises an inositol polyphosphate 5 - phosphatase catalytic domain ( IPP ) and a C - terminal RhoGAP - like domain that is catalytically inactive in both dOCRL human orthologs [ 7 ] . Mutations in OCRL1 are responsible for Lowe syndrome , a rare X - linked disorder seen in w 1 in 200 , 000 births and for some cases of Dent disease [ 8 , 9 ] . The cellular function of OCRL1 is poorly characterized ; it has been proposed to modu - late membrane trafﬁc [ 10 ] , actin dynamics [ 11 ] , and / or Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis [ 12 ] . Because investigation of OCRL1 func - tions is hampered by functional redundancy between OCRL1 and INPP5B in mammals [ 13 ] , we further analyzed the function of its Drosophila ortholog in cultured cells . The polyploidy phenotype was speciﬁc to dOCRL knockdown because two additional independent double - stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) ( dOCRL dsRNA2 and dOCRL dsRNA 5 0 UTR ) triggered cytoki - nesisfailureinS2cells ( Figure1B ) . Wethenperformedarescue experiment by stably expressing an mCherry - dOCRL , a GFP - dOCRL , or a GFP - dOCRL phosphatase - dead cDNA that are not targeted by the dOCRL 5 0 UTR dsRNA . Although dOCRL constructs restored efﬁciency of cytokinesis to levels seen in nontreated cells , the phosphatase - dead mutant was not able to rescue cytokinesis defects ( Figure 1B ; Figure S1D ) . These results demonstrate that dOCRL is necessary for cytokinesis via its inositol 5 - phosphatase enzymatic activity . dOCRL Is Associated with Endocytic Compartments We took advantage of the fact that dOCRL fused to GFP or mCherry was functional ( Figure 1B ) to investigate the subcel - lular localization of the enzyme . Besides a diffuse staining in the cytoplasm , dOCRL was associated with cytoplasmic vesi - cles , visualized as dot - like or ring - like structures ( Figure 2A ) . We further found that GFP - dOCRL partially colocalized with the small GTPase Rab5 , a marker of early endosomes ( Fig - ure 2A ; 17 . 5 % of dOCRL vesicles were positive for Rab5 ) . Because dOCRL was also present on vesicles that were not positive for Rab5 , we explored the potential association of dOCRL with endosomes of other origin . We cotransfected mCherry - dOCRL with GFP - Rab7 or YFP - Rab11 [ 14 ] and found that dOCRL was also associated with these markers of late and recycling endosomes ( Figure 2A ; 62 . 3 % and 53 . 5 % of dOCRL vesicles were positive for Rab7 and Rab11 , respec - tively ) , indicating that similarly to its human orthologs , dOCRL is associated with endosomes of diverse origins [ 15 – 17 ] . Remarkably , when dOCRL was depleted , Rab5 , Rab7 , and Rab11 were present on giant abnormal vacuoles rarely seen in control cells ( Figure 2B ) , showing that in the absence of dOCRL , the endocytic compartments are disorganized . dOCRL Controls PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 Homeostasis Because the preferential substrate of the inositol 5 - phospha - tase OCRL1 is the phosphate at the 5 0 position of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 18 ] , we analyzed the distribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 upon dOCRL depletion using GFP - Tubby or mCherry - PH PLC d as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 biosensors [ 19 ] . In control and in dOCRL knockdown cells , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was associated with the plasma membrane * Correspondence : sebastien . carreno @ umontreal . ca ( Figure 2C ; Figure S2A ) . Strikingly , we found that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 accumulated on the abnormal vacuoles observed in dOCRL knockdown cells . To test whether dOCRL depletion modiﬁes PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis , we monitored GFP - Tubby or mCherry - PH PLC d ﬂuorescence and quantiﬁed the ratio of signal associ - ated with endomembranes to that associated with the plasma membrane . We measured a signiﬁcant increase of the ratio of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 localized on endomembranes to that associated with the plasma membrane when dOCRL was depleted when compared to control cells ( Figure 2D ; Figure S2B ) . This defect of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis was rescued when mCherry - dOCRL was expressed in absence of endogenous dOCRL ( Figure 2D ) . These results indicate that dOCRL controls PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 enrichment on the plasma membrane by dephos - phorylating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on endomembranes . dOCRL Is Required for Proper Furrowing of the Contractile Ring During cytokinesis , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 accumulates at the contractile ring of mammalian cells while it furrows [ 2 , 4 ] . Furthermore , a tight control of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels at the cortex of dividing cells is important to maintain cleavage furrow stability and cytoki - nesis efﬁciency [ 2 , 3 , 20 ] . We therefore investigated whether dOCRL depletion can impinge on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 mitotic distribution and cleavage furrow stability ( Figure 3A ; Movie S1 ; Movie S2 ) . Whereas in control cells PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was enriched at the cleavage furrow , this accumulation was deﬁcient upon dOCRL depletion ( Figure 3A ; Figure S3A ) . We measured that in control conditions , enrichment of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the equatorial cleavage furrow was progressive and occurred when cells advanced from metaphase to telophase . Interestingly , we found a similar progressive increase of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 associated with endomembranes when dOCRL - depleted cells went from metaphase to telophase ( Figure 3A ; Figure S3B ) . This shows that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - rich endomembranes observed in dOCRL - depleted cells share similarity with the plasma membrane of the cleavage furrow . Because PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 plays a key role in controlling actin dynamics [ 21 ] , we then asked whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 deregulation could impinge on ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) organization . In control telophase cells , F - actin was mainly cortical and was enriched at the cleavage furrow . Although F - actin was enriched at the cleavage furrow of dOCRL - depleted cells , it also abnormally accumulated on the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - rich endo - membranes ( Figure S3C ) . We then assessed the dynamics of F - actin in mitotic cells stably expressing GFP - utrophin as a F - actin reporter [ 22 ] ( Figure 3B ) . We used the equatorial enrichment of GFP - utrophin ﬂuorescence to mark the longitu - dinal width of the contractile ring . In control cells , contractile rings occupied an average of 12 . 5 % of the cell length , whereas in dOCRL - depleted cells , the contractile rings were twice as broad ( Figure S3D ) . This indicates that dOCRL function is necessary to spatially constrain the contractile ring . Similarly to ﬁxed conditions , we measured a signiﬁcant defect in F - actin homeostasis during cell division with a high level of F - actin ﬂuorescence at the surface of the endomembranes ( Fig - ure S3E ) . These results establish that dOCRL is necessary for stabilization of the contractile ring and suggest that the fur - rowing deﬁciency observed upon dOCRL depletion occurs through defective homeostasis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and F - actin . dOCRL Is Required for the Proper Assembly of Components of the Cytokinetic Machinery We then asked whether , similarly to F - actin , other components of the cytokinetic machinery were also mistargeted to the endomembrane surface instead of accumulating solely at the cytokinetic ring .

In turn , RhoA drives polymerization of F - actin and activation of myosin II to generate the forces necessary for ingression of the cleavage furrow . While in control cells , RhoA accumulated at the cytoki - netic ring ; when dOCRL was depleted , RhoA was mistargeted to endomembranes ( Figure 4A ) . This shows that dOCRL is necessary to correctly localize RhoA during cytokinesis . Inter - estingly , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was shown to play an important role in concentrating RhoA at the division site of budding yeast [ 25 ] . We then monitored cell division in S2 cells stably expressing mCherry - anillin and the regulatory light chain of myosin II , Sqh - GFP ( Figure 4B ; Movie S3 ; Movie S4 ) [ 26 ] . These two proteins are essential components of the cytokinetic machinery and their individual depletion promotes a high rate of cytokinesis failure [ 27 – 29 ] . Whereas myosin II is essen - tial for actomyosin contractions , anillin is a multidomain protein capable of scaffolding different components of the cytokinetic ring at the plasma membrane [ 30 , 31 ] . As previ - ously reported [ 26 , 32 ] , anillin was nuclear in control interphase cells , became uniformly cortical in metaphase , and accumu - lated at the cytokinetic ring in anaphase ( Figure 4B ; Fig - ure S4A ) . myosin II was mostly cytoplasmic in interphase and was evenly distributed at the metaphase cortex and enriched at the cleavage furrow ( Figure 4B ; Figure S4B ) . In dOCRL - depleted cells , we found that myosin II and anillin were mistargeted to the abnormal giant vacuoles during cell division . Similarly to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , we measured that association of anillin and myosin II with endomembranes increased when dOCRL - depleted cells progressed from metaphase to telophase ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . Together , these results show that contractile ring components are aberrantly recruited to the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched endomembranes when function of dOCRL is impaired . This further implies that dOCRL and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 are required to specify the molecular distinction between the cytokinetic ring membrane and endomembranes . The spatial restriction of speciﬁc phosphoinositides on different cellular membranes contributes to membrane struc - tural heterogeneity . The majority of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is concentrated at the plasma membrane ; however , the mechanisms control - ling PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis remain mysterious . Our studies identify the Drosophila ortholog of the human inositol 5 - phos - phatases OCRL1 and INPP5B as essential for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis . We propose that in wild - type conditions , dOCRL dephos - phorylates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on membranes of the endocytic compart - ment to reduce PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 intracellular levels .

During cell division , enrichment of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane of the cytokinesis ring is critical for the stability of the furrow . In dOCRL - depleted cells , defects in cytokinesis could arise through at least two distinct mechanisms . One possibility is that accumulation of F - actin , RhoA , myosin II , and anillin on vacuoles of endocytic origin reﬂects a natural trafﬁcking process that transports cytokinetic machinery elements to the furrow [ 33 ] . In that model , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis and dOCRL function are necessary to regulate the trafﬁcking and fusion of endosomes carrying cytokinetic machinery elements to the cleavage furrow . Alternatively , defects in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis directly trigger mislocalization of key compo - nents of the cytokinetic machinery to intracellular membranes at the expense of the cortical cleavage furrow . In that model , progressive enrichment of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the cleavage furrow represents a spatial cue that helps specify recruitment and localization of the cytokinetic machinery components . In accordance with this model , we found a progressive enrich - ment of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , anillin , and myosin II at the surface of the abnormal endomembranes while dOCRL - depleted cells pro - gressed from metaphase to telophase . These two models are not mutually exclusive and could operate in concert to control cytokinesis . The importance of dOCRL for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis , endocytic compartment speciﬁcation , and cyto - kinesis may also be relevant to understand how mutations in OCRL1 produce the phenotypic manifestation of the Lowe syndrome .
