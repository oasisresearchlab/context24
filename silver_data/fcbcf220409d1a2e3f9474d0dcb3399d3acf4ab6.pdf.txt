REGULAR ARTICLE Co - operation over distance ? The spatial dimension of inter - organizational innovation collaboration Anja Dettmann 1 & Sidonia von Proff 1 & Thomas Brenner 1 Published online : 25 June 2015 # Springer - Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015 Abstract In the literature , there is a controversy about the role of space in innovation collaboration . With a longitudinal study of 47 inter - organizational innovation groups in Germany , we examine the link between the spatial composition of group members and group characteristics that are important to perform innovation projects . Hence , concep - tually and methodologically , we use social - psychological concepts in the field of spatial economics . We find that the share of regional partners is per se not a determining factor for the formation of a functional working group with the necessary characteristics to be successful . But very often regional groups are small and show shortcomings in their partner structure . Keywords Innovation collaboration . Collaboration over distance .

O38 1 Introduction Most innovation co - operation projects consist of partners who are located at rather short distance and within organizational and cognitive boundaries . Spatial proximity supports knowledge flows ( Arndt and Sternberg 2000 ; Asheim and Gertler 2007 ; Bell and Zaheer 2007 ; Boufaden and Plunket 2008 ) and thus is a facilitator for interaction and learning processes ( Boschma 2005 ; Freel 2003 ) ; it reduces costs ( Bayona et al . J Evol Econ ( 2015 ) 25 : 729 – 753 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00191 - 015 - 0414 - 8 * Sidonia von Proff vonproff @ geo . uni - marburg . de Anja Dettmann a . dettmann @ fz - juelich . de Thomas Brenner thomas . brenner @ geo . uni - marburg . de 1 Department of Geography , Chair of Economic Geography and Location Research , University of Marburg , Deutschhausstrasse 10 , 35032 Marburg , Germany 2001 ) ; and finally it is a pre - requisite for social relationships between co - operating partners ( Broekel and Binder 2006 ; Olson and Olson 2000 ; Dutton et al . 1996 ) . Nevertheless , for the healthy economic development of a region , some external knowl - edge has to be integrated ( Grabher 1993 ; Broekel and Meder 2008 ) . Thus , the question arises whether the share of regional partners is an influential factor on how inter - organizational groups develop over time as work and social units . Neither individuals and their characteristics nor relations are the unit of analysis ; rather , the focus is on the innovation team as a whole . The paper at hand adopts a social - psychological approach and analyzes inter - organizational groups in their characteristics as a work and social unit . Thus , we combine characteristics of working groups and matters of space on one level of analysis . ( See Levy et al . 2012 , for a slightly similar approach on a project level . ) In our study we relate the share of regional partners compared to group size , i . e . , regionality , to factors from very different fields ( e . g . , social , organizational and structural factors of a group ) . This offers the chance to get a holistic overview of the relation between proximity and different group factors , but also requires reducing the complexity of each factor . In order to avoid misunderstandings , we use the term group in what follows . The term network would evoke the association of social network analysis , which is not the method we will use here . At the beginning of the second section our definition of ‘ group ’ is explained in detail . The theoretical discussion will show that many findings and concepts exist in economic geography about the spatial composition of groups and networks and how this is linked to innovation performance . The study analyzes how regionality is linked to distinct group characteristics , particularly - but not exclusively - the social bonding of the group ( i . e . , all forces keeping members in the group ) as well as how regionality develops over time . These issues are studied empirically by means of 47 German publicly funded innovation groups . For this purpose , we develop a theory - based empirical approach that allows for measuring a number of crucial group characteristics . Since a functional team is required for later performance , the analysis of group characteristics standing for functionality and effectiveness is a promising way to identify determinants of later success . Group success is difficult to measure , especially for young groups . Therefore , we take an indirect approach . We assume that certain group characteristics ( developed from the social - psychological literature ) are a precon - dition for success and thus we measure these characteristics . This is related to the findings of Chang and Bordia ( 2001 ) that task cohesion of groups is positively associated with performance , and the one of King and Anderson ( 1996 ) that certain group characteristics are antecedents of innovation . Furthermore , we take an evolu - tionary view of groups with a focus on their initial formation and on their further development during innovative activities . The innovative and interdisciplinary point of our approach is to set the development of the characteristics of an innovation group in relation to its spatial dynamics . The paper proceeds as follows . In the next section , we discuss theoretical aspects regarding the role of regional and external partners in innovation groups . In addition , we derive six characteristics from the literature on group level innovation and innova - tion networks standing for working groups ’ ability to innovate . The third chapter contains our data and the analytical framework . In the first part of section four , we present the way in which regionality develops over time and thus how innovating groups change their spatial preferences regarding partners in the development process . 730 A . Dettmann et al . The second part of section four presents and discusses the relationship between regionality and the development of group characteristics supporting later innovations . Section five concludes . 2 Innovating groups and space The basis for our theoretical considerations as well as the empirical approach is a well - defined concept of the type of group we study . We will focus on intended and officially established inter - organizational groups . These are groups of independent actors that are consciously established with the purpose to conduct joint innovative activities in an organized manner . They are systems that pass different stages of development and educe characteristics superior to the sum of the characteristics of their members . These systems consist of interdependent participants with different institutional backgrounds , show cooperative and coordinated interaction , have an own structure in terms of norms , rules , and roles , are task - related and output driven , and appear as one unit to third parties . In these cases , individuals build their relationships consciously and voluntarily in order to form a group for a particular task ( Powell 1990 ) . Forsyth ( 2006 , p . 159 – 160 ) states that these “… cross - functional teams include individuals with different back - grounds and areas of expertise who join together to develop innovative products and identify new solutions to existing problems … [ They ] are fundamentally groups , and they possess basic characteristics of any group ” . Using the group level for an analysis is related to the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts . Established innovation groups have very similar characteristics to professional teams : a distinct number of participants , face - to - face interaction over a longer period , differentiated roles , some kind of management , common norms , and group cohesion ( Gebert and von Rosenstiel 1996 , p . 127 ) . However , established innovation groups are not perfectly comparable to work teams because their actors do not share a common institutional and organizational background . Hence , the main challenge is to develop an organizational setting in terms of roles , norms and rules . Then , “ individuals can identify with organizations and their interests as strongly as they may do with groups , with compa - rable psychological dynamics as a result ” ( Schruijer 2008 , p . 430 ) . Regarding the manifold theories about groups ( for an overview see Forsyth 2006 , p . 53ff ) , our understanding of groups is a systemic one . In our context , a group is a self - organizing , evolving system that comes into existence when independent actors join because they need each other ( Miller 1978 ) , as is the case in innovation projects . Note that the innovation process in our study is conscious , aspired , and operationalized in an organizational environment developed by the members over time . 2 . 1 Regional partners in innovation groups : the formation stage Due to the evolutionary perspective of the study , it is important to look at the different stages inter - organizational working groups pass over time : the formation stage and the performance stage . Established groups have a distinct formation stage in the beginning . In this stage , actors aim to find ( and to integrate ) partners , common goals , concrete projects , and an inner structure ( Tuckman 1965 ) . Studies have found the regional The spatial dimension of innovation collaboration 731 context to be of great importance in partner searching processes ( Broekel and Binder 2006 ; Ter Wal 2009 ; Blumberg 2001 ) . Here , economic and social aspects are the main arguments explaining the importance of spatial proximity and , in this sense , the importance of regional partners for innovation processes . In line with our interdisci - plinary approach , we present both strands . From an economic point of view , costs and resources of the co - operating partners have the strongest impact on size , geographical range , and success of innovation groups . There is certainly a firm somewhere in the world that is a technologically optimal partner . However , the costs of searching for a potential innovation collaborator increase with the time spent on the search . Freel ( 2003 ) finds that smaller companies collaborate more often locally than larger ones , which can be explained by their smaller resource base . Firms searching thoroughly will soon face information overkill . They need a strategy to reduce the amount of information and the costs of analyzing the information systematically . Hence , they could search among their former collaborators or search for recommendations , i . e . , firms which their collaborators know ( indirect links ) . Due to job mobility , customer and supplier relationships , and more , firms have some trustful connections to other firms , often locally situated ( Cantner and Graf 2006 ; Fleming and Frenken 2007 ) . Cooperation with a more or less well - known partner gives some security against hold - ups in the innovation competition because there is some trust . Trust and secrecy are highly important during the partner search , as original ideas could be stolen . It is a trade - off relationship between innovative potential and trust ( Cantner and Graf 2010 ) . Håkansson ( 1989 ) found that a spatially proximate network is of special relevance if there is no on - going commercial exchange between the partners to provide a basis for collaboration . If no prior partner enters into consideration , individuals will most likely either ask a person they know for an adequate partner or will search in their home region , where meeting an unknown person is easy ( see DiMaggio and Louch , 1998 , on socially embedded transaction ) . In short , a local search in a social or spatial sense is most likely . This is supported empirically by Singh ( 2005 ) as well as Breschi and Lissoni ( 2009 ) , who find , in empirical studies , that social ( and not spatial ) proximity causes the bulk of knowledge flows . Since social networks are often of spatially limited expansion , the spatially limited knowledge flows result from both spatial and social proximity . Of course , spatial distance can be overcome by temporary proximity ( Torre 2008 ) , but linking with distant new group members requires knowledge ( at least ) of their existence ; this is often the case through social proximity . However , these economic consequences of information overkill may often be unconscious and since they lead to the same result as the social arguments derived below they cannot be separated . Beside the economic arguments , intangible factors between geographical proximate partners play a role . This has been referred to as ‘ embeddedness ’ ( Uzzi 1997 ) , ‘ buzz ’ ( Bathelt et al . 2004 ) , or ‘ something in the air ’ ( Marshall 1927 ) . This is supported empirically by findings on the strong tendency for repeated partnerships ( Agrawal et al . 2006 ; Breschi and Lissoni 2009 ; Goerzen 2007 ) and the often stressed importance of social aspects in research partnerships ( Dutton et al . 1996 ; Hinings and Greenwood 1996 ; Kraut et al . 1987 ) , as frequent interaction and unintended meetings are known to enhance sympathy and trust ( Guirdham 2002 ; Kiesler and Cummings 2002 ; Lewicki and Bunker 1996 ) and take place primarily in the close environment of persons . Since the close social environment is often also spatially close , personal relationships and 732 A . Dettmann et al . groups are frequently built in a regional context . Tuckman ( 1965 ) identified stages of group development , wherein forming ( the initial meeting of partners ) , storming , ( the negotiation about norms , rules and goals ) and norming ( development of group cohe - sion ) belong to the formation of a group . During these stages , members predominantly face social processes they describe as stressful and unpredictable . This explains the strong tendency to choose well - known partners . A further mechanism is the need for at least temporal face - to - face contacts in the formation stage because social interaction requires non - verbal information ( Aronson et al . 2009 ) . Due to the low costs faced by regional partners in joining the constitutive group meetings , they have a lower barrier to take part in the group . We deduce our first hypothesis : H1 : Inter - organizational innovation groups choose primarily regional partners ( i . e . , > 50 % ) during the formation stage and thus they have a high degree of regionality . Above , we explained that new group members are selected often via social ties , especially when the partner is located at a distance . “ Social ties ” can refer to previous spatial proximity , previous collaboration , as indirect social links ( mutual friends ) of individual group members . In these cases , social proximity substitutes for spatial proximity . Choosing distant partners requires the strong belief in a successful co - operation in advance even without frequent face - to - face meetings . By contrast , regional partners can be included although their social bonding may be weak , knowing that relationships can be more readily intensified over time in a joint environment than over distance . Hence , most partners who are included in an innovation group can be expected to be either socially / institutionally linked to other members or to be located in geographic proximity . One average , the following should hold : H2 : Inter - organizational innovation groups with more distant partners show a stronger social bonding than those with few distant partners . Of course , new group members can be distant from the view of the group manage - ment , but , in fact , spatially proximate to one of the other distant members . In this case , it is hard to say whether the person is actually proximate or distant . Nevertheless , on average , we believe Hypothesis H2 to be true . 2 . 2 Regional partners in innovation groups : the performance stage During the performance stage , the group keeps developing . The decision whether a company continues participating in the project or not depends to a large extent on the resulting costs and perceived benefits . At first , all actors have to invest resources ( person - nel , machinery , organization effort ) into the project . Meetings and interactions lead to reinforcement of the ( up to then loosely ) established structure ( Drach - Zahavy and Somech 2001 ) . The involved actors gradually adapt to each other and transaction costs decrease . Notwithstanding , the costs of collaboration remain higher for distant group members than for those in close proximity . For example , spontaneous meetings , being very important during product development , are much easier and travelling is cheaper . The spatial dimension of innovation collaboration 733 For some actors , the focus of the group develops in a direction departing from their core competencies or aims . They will probably leave the group , while others may join it as soon as the group needs their competencies . Since the benefits are not yet real and will be uncertain for quite a while , the uncertainty can lead to some random fluctuation based on differences in the perception of benefits . The fewer resources a company has , the more likely uncertain future benefits will be a reason for leaving the group . Larger com - panies ( i . e . , with larger resources ) can be expected to have greater stamina in this case and benefit from expensive but lucrative projects . This could explain the finding of Arndt and Sternberg ( 2000 ) that larger companies benefit more from inter - regional links and smaller firms more from intra - regional links . However , economic arguments do not suffice to explain the commitment of members in innovation groups . Due to the voluntary character of innovation groups , social relationships play an outstanding role . Argyle and Henderson ( 1985 , p . 241 ) found out that “… under the right conditions , for example small and cohesive groups , work relationships are a very powerful source of satisfaction and support ” . Hence , commitment is not only a question of economic benefits , but can also be strongly linked to the motivating character of social patterns in group relationships . Additionally , the group performs the complex task of an innovation project requiring a lot of communication processes , coordination , and task - related learning . Here , sound relationships are of great importance , too ( Chang and Bordia 2001 ) . Argyle ( 1991 ) found out in a study of work teams showing different degrees of personal bonding ( from social friends to disliked colleagues ) that those teams with a high commitment were most successful . Trust in work relationships is linked to group cohesiveness and commitment ( Dirks and Ferrin 2001 ; Lewicki and Bunker 1996 ) . The increase of cohesiveness and commitment in turn is strongly linked to the amount of personal interaction requiring spatial proximity ( Aronson et al . 2009 ; Kraut et al . 1988 ; Kiesler and Cummings 2002 ) . Hence , the supporting role of spatial proximity regarding the maintenance of sound work relationships is a key for successful innovation groups . The fact that spatial proximity is important in mutual learning and knowledge - exchange processes was already stated in earlier papers ( Amin and Wilkinson 1999 ; Bathelt et al . 2004 ; Bell and Zaheer 2007 ; Kirat and Lung 1999 ; Maskell and Malmberg 1999 ; Morgan 1997 ) . However , continuous spatial proximity is a feature of regional partners only . A possibly low social bonding of regional partners can be compensated by the joint regional environment . Hence , the difference between regional and distant partners regarding the social depth is supposed to vanish quickly as the former are bonded from the beginning and latter can catch up over time . By contrast , loosely connected distant members have a high chance of being lost , since strengthening the relationship is difficult . Thus , regional partners are lost less often and integrated more easily while distant partners have a lower chance of being included and kept during the performance stage ( if they are not tightly bonded to existing group members ) . To sum up , economic and social arguments lead to the same result : the group will rarely get spatially more wide - spread . We state : H3 : Inter - organizational innovation groups increase the degree of regionality they gained during the formation stage . 734 A . Dettmann et al . 2 . 3 Regionality and the characteristics of innovation groups In order to make the complex processes of groups theoretically and methodologi - cally manageable , the psychological literature identified a set of qualities ( in terms of characteristics ) , to help characterize professional groups ( Forsyth 2006 ) . If these characteristics are missing or are underdeveloped , teams might have a limited functionality . Regarding performance , many findings exist for single team charac - teristics such as communication patterns , knowledge management , size , or leader - ship ( Fussell et al . 1998 ; Hirst and Mann 2004 ; Janhonen and Johanson 2011 ; Stankiewicz 1979 ; Sydow 2001b ; and many more ) . But the study at hand aims to use a rather holistic approach such as the UNESCO study on team performance ( Andrews 1979 ) , and considers a wider portfolio of group characteristics . This is the key to understanding where spatial attributes are influential to the character of a group and thus its ability to perform innovation projects : “ A multivariate design approach is [ … ] required to examine the impact of the numerous group character - istics which may impinge upon innovation ” ( King and Anderson 1996 , p . 87 ) . The literature on group processes and professional groups offers many approaches to arrange and formulate characteristics of groups , reflecting the very different back - grounds of this field of research . Innovation is a rare topic here . We found only one study ( King and Anderson 1996 ) close to our approach using a multivariate design of four “ antecedents of group level innovation ” bringing together earlier literature . Using recent innovation group literature ( Conway and Steward 2009 ; Endres 2001 ; Forsyth 2006 ; Human and Provan 2000 ; Müller et al . 2002 ; Sydow 2001a ) we added two further characteristics and checked the robustness of King ’ s and Anderson ’ s . The resulting six group characteristics cover social , coordination , and project related processes in innovation groups and should be general enough to be applied to other group level innovation studies . These are explained in Table 1 , where the first columns displays our developed characteristics . In particular , these are : communi - cation and information exchange within the group ; coordination of the group representing the functionality and role of the group management ; development of a common identity ; documentation and reflection activities in the group ; a goal - oriented structure ; and co - operation between group partners . The second column describes each characteristic , the fourth and fifth column refers to the respective findings in earlier studies . The third column displays the operationalization for the empirical part : for each characteristic , several indicators are checked , that may be true or not ( dummy variables ) . The amount of true indicators ( normalized to a range from 0 to 1 ) gives the strength of this characteristic in the group . For a deeper discussion about the distinct social - psychological processes that take place between members of a group , we would like to point to the original literature on group processes ( see Forsyth 2006 ; Argyle and Henderson 1985 ; Guirdham 2002 ; Guzzo and Shea 1992 ) . Of course , the defined characteristics in their role as indicators for group function - ality can only be a first proposal to measure innovation groups in a holistic and longitudinal way . The lack of interdisciplinary ( Schruijer 2008 ) as well as evolutionary network studies ( Powell et al . 2005 ) in economic geography indicate that intensive research is still required in order to understand the complex relationships between innovation activities and spatial proximity .

Dettmann et al . Using this approach for the first time , it is difficult to develop hypotheses a priori about the way a regional partner pool influences distinct group processes . Hence , we analyze very openly how regionality is linked to group characteristics and whether a regional partner pool triggers or hampers their development . 3 Data and method 3 . 1 Empirical approach The objects of study are innovation groups in the eastern part of Germany that received public funding during their formation . The funding program , Innovationsforen , is conducted by the German Ministry of Education and Research ( BMBF ) and aims at fostering network structures between regional actors in order to raise the innovation performance of these regions . ( See http : / / www . unternehmen - region . de / de / 162 . php for more information on the program . ) Until 2010 , the program supported more than 120 inter - organizational innovation groups and it is still ongoing ( until 2013 : more than 150 groups ) . Innovationsforen funds primarily very young initiatives with innovation ideas of supra - regional importance . The program tries to create opportunities for face - to - face communication and the establishment of relationships through financing topic - related conferences , workshops , and meetings for 6 months . The recipients are invited to form regional as well as inter - regional links ( no limits defined ) as long as some of the actors are located in the eastern part of Germany . To receive funding , the groups have to apply with a convincing innovation idea and a network concept to conduct the project . This very open approach is fortunate for our analysis : there is no bias to be expected regarding regional focus or a specific industry . However , groups that receive funding may develop differently from groups that do not receive public funding . The funding puts some pressure on the groups to develop a proper group structure and organization . Furthermore , it provides a joint incentive to progress in group formation . Some of these differences can be seen in the comparison between the funding period and the devel - opments thereafter . However , we believe that this does not interfere strongly with our research focus on the relationship between group characteristics and regionality and are supported in this belief by the fact that no differences in this sense can be observed between the funding period and the time thereafter . Nevertheless , further studies of this kind are necessary to prove this . The groups pass two formation stages : before they apply ( basic group ) and during the funding period that focuses on partner search processes and the development of inner structures . We measured the groups for the first time at application ( stage 1 ) , a second time after the funding ( stage 2 ) , and a third time in performance ( stage 3 ) . Hence , we know how regional the inter - organizational innovation groups proceed after an unsupported formation ( measurement S1 ) , after a funded constitution stage ( mea - surement S2 ) , and at one point of the ongoing performance stage ( measurement S3 ) . We do not compare the innovation groups with non - funded ones ( “ control groups ” ) , because we look at the interrelatedness of group factors within and between different stages of group development . We do , however , investigate how they develop depend - ing on characteristics prior to funding . Hence , we do not make statements about what the program accomplishes for regional development or the like . Instead , the The spatial dimension of innovation collaboration 739 longitudinal examination gives insights on group development - the ( probable ) effects of the program are discussed along with the results . The basic idea of our research concept ( see Fig . 1 ) is to measure the group character - istics as well as the regionality and to compare them in the above named three points in time . Additionally , the relationships of the variables between the three stages are analyzed . To measure the characteristics , we used different types of data sources . For S1 ( pre - funding ) we analyzed the application documents of the groups , for S2 ( end of funding ) the final reports , and for performance ( S3 ) we interviewed the group managers by phone . The analyzed documents had distinct standards set by the funding program regarding the group information they were compelled to disclose . This ensured that detailed information would be available for most of the groups . Missing information regarding stages S1 or S2 was gained in the interviews . Since the group managers are the “ core ” of the group , and were usually involved right from the beginning of the group establishment , they have detailed information about all activities of the group and its members . The interviews were highly standardized and measured concrete situations or behavior in the groups , so we reduced the risk of positive self - presentation and socially desired answers . Note that , in this study , our understanding of the group members refers to individuals and not to firms or organizations . Individ - uals are delegated by their firms and research institutes into these inter - organizational groups to become a functional and innovating team . From a scientific perspective , this leads to the question of whether the actors should be interpreted as individuals or as representatives of firms and other organizations . Both interpretations would not fully reflect the situation . However , since we are mainly interested in the social aspects of the groups and their formation , the individual level is of higher importance here because these processes depend on individual interaction . The perspective of individuals in a group allows us to use psychological approaches and concepts . The groups usually consist of one or a few employees of small and medium sized firms . For the study at hand , 47 inter - organizational innovation groups were chosen out of a sample of more than 120 funded groups . The criteria were , first , to choose groups for which all S1 Applica(cid:2)on S2 End of funding Funding period ( 6 month ) Post - funding period ( 2 - 9 years ) G r o up c h a r a c t e r i s (cid:2) c s S3 Today Characteris(cid:2)c 1 Characteris(cid:2)c 2 Characteris(cid:2)c 3 Characteris(cid:2)c 4 Characteris(cid:2)c 5 Characteris(cid:2)c 6 Structural A(cid:3)rib .

Fig . 1 Temporal structure of our research approach 740 A . Dettmann et al . documents were available and the conduction of an interview was possible and , second , to obtain a heterogeneous sample , especially regarding success and failure in group developments . Since Innovationsforen is open for all industries and innovation ideas , the groups varied strongly in size , structure , and strategy . Additionally , the funding took place in different years ( between 2001 and 2010 ) giving the performance stage a variable duration but also enabling an analysis over a long time period . Having a heterogeneous sample like this , using three different sources of data , and aiming at underlying relationships between group characteristics and regionality , the research concept re - quired a high level of standardization . In this case , the key tool is a catalogue of indicators measuring the group characteristics ( see column 3 in Table 1 ) . In order to get quantitative and categorical information , respectively , from the group managers , a strictly standardized catalogue was designed covering all indicators and additional variables . Because of the data sources consisting primarily of text ( written and spoken ) , we had to assign numbers to the content or answer categories . Three possible values for each indicator were defined : 0 = the indicator is not given , 0 . 5 = the state of the indicator is partly developed or planned , 1 = the indicator is completely developed . Whether something is not present can be clearly determined ( assigning a value of 0 ) . The same holds if some indicators are completely developed or present ( assigning a value of 1 ) . Since we build upon textual data , we are not able to measure the exact degree of completion or presence . Consequently , everything in between gets assigned the value 0 . 5 , which is the most correct way to express contentual betweenness . The values of the group characteristics consist of the equally - weighted indicators and they are normalized so that each characteristic takes a value between zero ( characteristic is not existing ) and one ( characteristic is completely developed ) . By using three values for the indicators , the knowledge of the group managers of members ’ relationships and actions is categorized sufficiently broad to avoid an incorrect assessment . 3 . 2 Method In order to test for structural and social factors beyond the group characteristics , we defined additional variables ( see Table 2 ) . Furthermore , the performance stage is of a varying duration in the sample ( 1 to 10 years ) . For this reason , we had to create control variables measuring important events such as additional funding from other sources . The data for the additional variables were collected as quantitative or categorized data . Especially for the additional variables it was not possible to obtain them for all groups , the reason being that managers changed for some groups during the last years and the new staff could not answer all questions . Furthermore , some questions were added ( unfortunately ) after the first interviews had been completed . These causes of missing values seem not to be related to the studied variables and we do not expect relevant biases . Table 2 lists these variables ; Table 4 adds descriptive statistics of the variables for each stage . Table 3 shows the correlations . As expected , the group characteristics are mutually correlated . We calculate the variance inflation factor in the regressions , which shows that these correlations are not problematic for the results . Note that not all group members participated in all group projects : a project is a concrete problem solution ( innovation ) and there may be several projects conducted in one inter - organizational innovation group . In other words , the group consists of all The spatial dimension of innovation collaboration 741 actors interested in principle in working together on joint innovation projects ( i . e . , signed members ) ; but only parts of the group actually work together on concrete Table 3 Correlation matrix iac coor doc ident str size regio proj bonding coop 0 . 46 0 . 45 0 . 34 0 . 54 0 . 41 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 32 0 . 09 iac 0 . 60 0 . 49 0 . 40 0 . 36 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 04 − 0 . 02 coor 0 . 39 0 . 40 0 . 23 0 . 09 0 . 09 0 . 04 − 0 . 06 doc 0 . 43 0 . 26 0 . 00 0 . 10 0 . 08 − 0 . 05 ident 0 . 48 0 . 23 0 . 05 0 . 22 0 . 14 str 0 . 19 − 0 . 26 0 . 21 0 . 19 size − 0 . 38 − 0 . 08 0 . 14 regio 0 . 08 − 0 . 36 proj 0 . 26 Bold numbers refer to significant correlation Table 2 Structural , social , and control variables Variable ( abbreviation ) Description of the variable Number of members ( size ) Structural variable for measuring the group size in terms of number of firms or other organizations Regionality ( regio ) Structural variable for measuring the share of regional members ( number of regional members relatively to group size ) Project members ( proj ) Structural variable for measuring the number of project members relatively to group size Group relationship ( bonding ) Social variable for measuring the social depth of personal bonding regarding the majority of group members ( categorical : 0 = do not know each other , 0 . 5 = sharing a professional relationship , 1 = sharing a professional and personal relationship ) Degree of sub - group development ( subgr ) Structural variable for measuring in how far the group is divided into sub - groups .

Since joint projects enhance the groups ’ social and cognitive proximity ( Drach - Zahavy and Somech 2001 ) , the variable proj measures the share of group members actively involved in one or more innovation projects . It might be , that at a certain point in time , there are no projects conducted in a group because the planned projects had not yet begun or the last project had just been completed or stopped . As explained in section 2 . 2 , social bonding influences group dynamics . Similar to Argyle ( 1991 ) , we measured social bonding stepwise by being not acquainted , having a professional , or having a professional AND private relationship . As the objects of study are so different regarding their location , industry , 1 and innovation ideas , we did not use a standard definition for region . We asked the interviewees to refer to partners ‘ in their region ’ . Using this “ subjective regionality ” , we guaranteed that the interviewees always had a group in mind whose members shared a regional context . We argue that the belonging of group members to a complex construct like a region cannot be adequately measured by distance thresholds or administrative boarders . The study at hand deals with a regional belonging developed in people ’ s minds and differing between areas , industries , and cultures . The study at hand is based on two methods of analysis . In order to test for the change of variables between different points in time ( Δ 12 or Δ 23 ) , the paired Wilcoxon test is used . To test how different variables are related to each other within or between different stages , we estimated linear regression models . The residuals were sufficiently normally distributed according to KS tests . We tested the models using a test of variance inflation for multicollinearity . The test result was always negative , showing that the group characteristics and variables measured sufficiently different aspects of a group in spite of correlation . We used a 5 % - significance level , unless stated otherwise . Since some data points were missing , not all groups can be included in all regres - sions . We tried to include preferably those variables which were complete . Notes are given if variables were excluded for this reason . 1 The groups belong to instruments , energy , health , logistics , construction , biotech , chemicals , ICT , and more , thus giving a broad picture of industrial activity .

In particular , it contains findings on how the regional partner pool develops over time , that social bonding is important to overcome distances , and whether public funding can reduce the strong tendency to choose regional partners . The second part presents our findings on the relationship between regionality and innovation group characteristics ( section 2 . 3 ) . 4 . 1 The change of regionality in innovation groups As explained above , the group formation consists of two parts : the ‘ natural ’ formation before application for funding and the ‘ established ’ formation during the 6 months of funding . Figure 2 shows the highest degree of regionality after the first formation ( S1 ) . Without the support of funding or consulting , innovation groups are built primarily of regional actors . In particular , 22 of the 42 groups for which we have regio1 data consist purely of regional members , only four groups have more than 50 % non - regional members . Hence , Hypothesis H1 is largely confirmed for a ‘ natural ’ formation stage of groups . The number of non - regional partners rises significantly during the funding stage ( from S1 to S2 ) , from 20 to 35 % ( Wilcoxon test : p - value = 0 . 006 ) . Of course , the funding program requires a certain amount of regional partners at the beginning . Nevertheless , there is no fixed share , and the value of 80 % is very high and can be better explained by the mechanisms presented in section 2 . 1 than by the program framework . The result indicates that groups following their natural search have a strong tendency to choose regional partners , whereas public funding can reduce this strong tendency for Table 5 Relation between regionality and group relationship before ( S1 ) and after ( S2 ) funding , today ( S3 ) , and over all stages Before funding ( n = 24 ) After funding ( n = 27 ) Today ( n = 30 ) Over all stages ( n = 81 ) Spearman correlation − 0 . 240 − 0 . 432 * − 0 . 105 − 0 . 354 * * : significant at alpha < 0 . 05 Fig . 2 The average number of regional and non - regional partners in the groups before ( S1 ) , after funding ( S2 ) , and today ( S3 ) 744 A . Dettmann et al . regional partners significantly ( the funding program pressures groups to incorporate missing competences ) . It increases the group resources and guides the members through the risky and stressful stages of early group development processes . These supportive economic , but first of all psychological , effects were pointed out in nearly all of our interviews . Although , the inter - organizational innovation groups integrate a lot of distant partners , the regional environment remains the most important pool for partners : over all stages , approximately 68 % of the group members are regional actors . We assume that this value would be a lot higher in unfunded groups as the ‘ natural ’ search leads to a higher degree of regionality . Since all groups ( two exceptions ) integrated non - regional members when expanding , the risk of a lock - in situation seems to be much less . The change after funding ( Δ 23 ) is not significant , in contrast to our Hypothesis H3 stating that regionality increases over time . A possible reason for this is the choice of interview partners and our “ subjective regionality ” : the question as to who is a regional group member was answered by the group managers . Thus , every member at a distance from the spatial core of the group ( location of the group manager ) is viewed as a distant member , even though they can be spatially close to other distant group members . Unfortunately , we cannot investigate this further with the available data . Figure 2 shows a strong growth of the groups during funding by doubling the number of members in 6 months . The growth in the post - funding stage from an average size of 20 members ( S2 ) to 37 members today is also large , but this stage can endure up to 9 years in our sample . The interviews revealed that overcoming spatial distance is a problem for innovation projects . Although only 32 % are distant partners over all stages , this group is responsible for 40 % of group membership resignations . We assumed from the theory that distant actors , who are chosen as group members , are socially more strongly bonded to the other members than regional partners or are likely to be lost . To answer this question , we asked the group managers how they would describe the relationship of the majority of the group members concerning the three points in time and additionally to assign their answer to the following categories : 0 = do not know each other , 0 . 5 = have a professional relationship , and 1 = have a professional and personal relationship . If groups with more distant members showed a higher social depth at the end of constitution there should be a negative correlation between regionality and group relationship ( Hypothesis H2 ) . Analyzing the data independently from particular stages , the correlation is signifi - cantly negative Table 5 . On average , the more distant partners a group has , the higher is the social bonding between the partners . Running the test for particular stages , we only found this relationship to be significant for S2 . There is no indication that the funding program has a different impact on distant and regional partners regarding social processes . Thus , the high social depth regarding distant partners is brought into the groups from past contexts . Hence , Hypothesis H2 is confirmed . Having in mind the high number of completely regional groups , the finding can result from low variance in the data . Overall , we conclude that there is a tendency to integrate distant partners only in case of social bonding . We assumed from the theory that spatial proximity facilitates regional partners in maintaining and intensifying relationships when performing projects . This indicates that , over time , the difference between regional groups and the ones with more distant The spatial dimension of innovation collaboration 745 partners vanishes regarding social depth . We found evidence for this , since the rela - tionship between regionality and group relationship becomes insignificant in S3 . Hence , groups with many distant members reach social depth sooner , but those with regional partners catch up over time due to the advantages of spatial proximity . Our results shed new light on the relationship between spatial proximity and social processes in groups . The longitudinal perspective of our study reveals that the choice of partners is primarily led by social and economic determinants and less by spatial proximity per se . It has rather an indirect effect , as , on the one hand , social - psychological processes make it very likely that well known partners are also regional partners . On the other hand , spatial proximity saves resources and thus facilitates integration with less well - known partners . Both aspects lead to a strong preference for regional partners . Only if the resources of a group are increased , e . g . , in the case of funding , can this regional bias be weakened . It seems as if , during formation , social processes and ties are the most important determinants in group development . 4 . 2 The relationship between regionality and characteristics of innovation groups In the following , the relationship between regionality and group variables is investi - gated . We built linear regression models with regionality in stage 2 and stage 3 , respectively , as the dependent variable . The independent variables are the six group characteristics [ IaC , Coor , Ident , Str , DocRefl and Coop ] , the group size [ size ] , regionality [ regio ] , the group relationship [ bonding ] and the share of group members involved in projects [ proj ] in the group of the stage before . Model 1 : Regio 2 ¼ f IaC 1 ; Coor 1 ; Ident 1 ; Str 1 ; DocRefl 1 ; Coop 1 ; Size 2 ; Regio 1 ; Bonding 1 ; Proj 1 ; d pre ð Þ Model 2 : Regio 3 ¼ f IaC 2 ; Coor 2 ; Ident 2 ; Str 2 ; DocRefl 2 ; Coop 2 ; Size 3 ; Regio 2 ; Bonding 2 ; Proj 2 ; d post ; Subgr ð Þ Because of the different length of the post - funding stage , we tested for the influence of time by integrating a time variable ( t ) in the regression models , but it never had a significant impact on any variable . We also tested an interaction term regio1 * bonding1 in the first model without any significant findings . Hence we excluded both variables in the final models in order to increase the degrees of freedom . Model 1 is found to have no explanatory power and no variable is significant , not even the level of regionality at S1 has a significant impact on regionality at S2 . We have shown above that the funding increases the amount of inter - regional partners ; the finding here shows that the initial regionality does not matter for the increase . Model 2 has good explanatory power ( see Table 6 ) . The highly significant regionality variable indicates that regionality at S2 is a good predictor for regionality at S3 . Together with the finding from above , that 746 A . Dettmann et al . there is no significant change in regionality between S2 and S3 , we observe a high stability of the level of regionality during the performance stage . Indepen - dent from the duration of the performance stage , regional groups keep the tendency to choose regional partners , whereas groups with many partners beyond the region keep including distant ( but apparently socially bonded ) actors . The group characteristics do not influence regionality . Hence , a predominantly regional partner pool at an early development stage makes it very difficult for innovation groups to overcome a regional limitation ( without external intervention ) . The share of inter - regional partners at early stages has a strong influence on the later development of regionality . In short , there is strong path dependency . For politicians , this result indicates that the restructuring of groups is very difficult the more regionally limited they are . This finding can be explained with an argument similar to the “ imprinting theory ” developed by Stinchcombe ( 1965 ) and applied to networks by Marquis ( 2003 ) : the initial regionality is a feature of the group that is perpetuated over time because new entrants follow the behavior of the incumbents . No other significant impacts on the regionality of the groups are found . Thus , we turn to the impact of regionality on the performance , more precisely , the group char - acteristics that are preconditions for success . The longitudinal research concept allows for measuring the influence of regionality on group characteristics between different stages . We tested , on the one hand , the influence of regionality in S1 on characteristics in S2 and , on the other hand , the influence of regionality in S2 on characteristics in S3 .

The development degree of all group characteristics in stage 2 depends mainly on their degree in stage 1 , indicating high stability . Note that there were only 6 months between S1 and S2 , and thus the time for changes in the group characteristics was limited . The missing relevance of regionality regarding the development of the group characteristics is also confirmed in stage 3 . For the development degree of the characteristics today we do not find any significant relationships with regionality in stage 2 . Hence , neither regionality seems to depend strongly on the group characteristics nor do the group characteristics seem to depend strongly on regionality . Three different conclusions might be drawn from this : 1 ) spatial proximity does not matter for the development of groups ; 2 ) spatial distance is compensated by other kinds of proximities ; or 3 ) none of the groups has so many spatially distant members that group development would be influenced . We see the second conclusion as most likely – based on the findings on personal bounding – but more research is needed for a final statement . We found four variables in S2 to have a positive impact on other variables at S3 : a high identity feeling , a low established structure , additional funding , and low sub - group development . ( See Table 8 . ) However , these variables are not in the focus of this paper . In sum , we found out that the degree of regionality had no significant relationship on the successful development of group characteristics which are required to perform Table 8 Relation between regionality ( S2 ) and group characteristics ( S3 ) ( Models 4a - f ; n = 39 ) Group characteristic in S3 as dependent variable IaC2 Coor2 Ident2 Str2 DocRefl2 Coop2 Size2 Regio2 d _ post subgr Adj .

The variable “ proj2 ” was not included due to an insufficient number of cases 748 A . Dettmann et al . innovation projects successfully and for the group to be self - sustainable . We assume that the success or failure of inter - organizational innovation groups strongly depends on the topics , strategies , and aims that have to fit to the regional partner pool and thus it becomes a question of the quality of regional partners . As expectable after the findings of Singh ( 2005 ) and Breschi and Lissoni ( 2009 ) , spatial proximity / regionality per se does not have direct influence on group characteristics . In a further model , we pooled the variables of S2 and S3 in order to find out whether there is a general relationship between regionality and other group characteristics without a time lag , i . e . , without assuming any causality . Table 9 shows the results . Model 5 : Regio ¼ f IaC ; Coor ; Ident ; Str ; DocRefl ; Coop ; Proj ; Size ; Bonding ; d post ð Þ Regarding the focus of our paper , the most important result is that regionality is linked to a less well developed structure as well as a lower level of bonding ( the latter relationship we already found in Table 5 ) . In line with studies emphasizing the substi - tutional relationship between social and spatial proximity ( e . g . , Hansen 2013 ) , we found that groups with many spatially distant partners showed more personal bonding . This result helps us to specify the role of the regional environment for innovation groups in more detail . It seems to be a pre - requisite to build up personal relationships that later help to overcome long distances in joint projects . Regional groups are rather incomplete and not optimally staffed ( low level of Str ) , which shows how important distant partners are – the more specific or complex the projects , the more important the distant partners . Since groups with high regionality do not display the strongest social relationships , spatial proximity can be a protector for social overembeddedness . The regional environment is of great importance in order to add a critical number of actors who can become either very good partners because of an eased social catching up or who keep their rather distant position , bringing in fresh ideas as well as a professional way of interacting . 5 Conclusion The study at hand analysed the development of inter - organizational innovation groups during their earliest stages . This approach excluded performance / success measurement , since the innovation groups were still too young to be evaluated in this respect . Nevertheless , relating our findings to performance measures would be Table 9 General relation between regionality and other group variables ( n = 50 ) IaC Coor Ident Str DocRefl Coop proj Size d _ postfund Bonding Estimate 0 . 217 − 0 . 141 0 . 226 − 0 . 314 * 0 . 179 − 0 . 029 0 . 014 − 0 . 002 − 0 . 022 − 0 . 143 * * : significant at alpha < 0 . 05 .

The focus lies on the regionality , i . e . , the amount of regional group members , its development over time , and its relation to several group characteristics . In the theory part , these characteristics were developed from the economic - geographic , social - psychologi - cal , and management literature . These characteristics are relevant for performing innovation projects successfully . The empirical part consisted of a longitudinal analysis of 47 inter - organizational innovation groups in Germany . In the theory part , we presented arguments for a spatially rather delimited partner search and discussed the ambivalence of spatial proximity for group characteristics . We then empirically analysed the development of the regional partner pool and how its size was linked to other group characteristics - within distinct development stages and between them . We found out that regionality per se was neither a facilitator nor a barrier for the successful development of characteristics that the groups needed to perform projects and become self - sustaining . Groups with a larger share of distant partners showed a high social bonding from the beginning , whereas groups which were more regionally limited caught up . The way a group will develop is decided in a surprisingly early stage . Once it is consti - tuted , the regionality does not change much – despite the inclusion of ( many ) new partners . This means that groups show strong path dependency in their regionality . Therefore , policy measures aiming at inter - regional collaboration have to be applied at an early stage of group formation . Very regional groups are often less optimal staffed and incomplete , i . e . , the structure is less devel - oped . Probably , the region as core pool for partners is often too small . Overall , the partner search in the innovation groups under investigation was strongly led by social processes and personal ties . Of course , there are some limitations to our work and further studies in this line are necessary to improve our understanding of the development of innovation groups . Regarding the data , the results hold first of all for Germany and they are deduced from a rather limited sample size . The approach of analyzing the group comes along with neglecting the motives of the individuals , especially those having left the group . However , there exist studies on what motivates individuals to search for collaboration partners . The dichotomy of regional / non - regional partners neglects concrete distances as well as the distance between “ distant ” members . Here , further investigations would be helpful . The subjectivity of being regional is open to dispute , but for our purposes it is more adequate than defining regional by certain distances that possibly do not coincide with the “ felt distance ” between partners . One can argue that group characteristics are influenced by the team composition . This is true , but of limited relevance in our case , since we do not investigate the cause of the characteristics , but rather their development . Last , but not least , the results are independent of the industry and the location ( within the eastern part of Germany ) , which is , on the one hand , a strength , because we can find general relationships between group characteristics and its spatial compo - sition , but , on the other hand , is a weakness , because more differentiated results regarding regional features and industrial specific could not be gained . But as mentioned in the introduction , the aim was to get a very first impression about the relationship between the spatial composition of a group with a special focus on regional belonging and the development of particular group characteristics . 750 A . Dettmann et al . Additionally , we could show the development of a regional partner pool in inter - organizational groups for the first time . To sum up , we took an interdisciplinary and eclectic approach and analyzed innovation groups as an own unit of analysis in terms of being a group with distinct characteristics and dynamics . With our longitudinal perspective , we could show the importance of social processes for the constitution of groups , the importance of personal ties in overcoming distance , and the importance of path dependent to the spatial dimension of innovation groups .
