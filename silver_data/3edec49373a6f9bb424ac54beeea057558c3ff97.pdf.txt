Tel . : + 1 617 452 3084 ; fax : + 1 617 452 3085 E - mail address : cortiz @ mit . edu Abstract Stem cell - based gene therapy and tissue engineering have been shown to be an efficient method for the regeneration of critical - size bone defects . Despite being an area of active research over the last decade , no knowledge of the intrinsic structural and nanomechanical properties of such bone tissue exists . In this study , we report the nanomechanical properties of engineered bone tissue derived from genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) overexpressing the rhBMP2 gene , grown in vivo in the thigh muscle of immunocompetent mice for four weeks , compared to femoral bone adjacent to the transplantation site . Supplementary experiments showed that the two types of bone had similar mineral contents ( 61 and 65wt . % for engineered and femoral bone , respectively ) , overall microstructures showing lacunae and canaliculi ( both measured by back - scattered electron microscopy ) , chemical compositions ( measured by energy dispersive X - ray analysis ) , and nanoscale topographical morphologies ( measured by tapping mode atomic force microscopy imaging or TMAFM ) . Nanoindentation experiments revealed that the small length scale mechanical properties were statistically different with the femoral bone ( indented parallel to the bone long axis ) being stiffer and harder ( apparent average elastic modulus , E ~ 27 . 3 ± 10 . 5 GPa and hardness , H ~ 1 . 0 ± 0 . 7 GPa ) than the genetically engineered bone ( E ~ 19 . 8 ± 5 . 6 GPa , H ~ 0 . 9 ± 0 . 4 GPa ) . TMAFM imaging of residual indents showed that both types of bone exhibited viscoelastic plastic deformation . However , fine differences in the residual indent area ( smaller for the engineered bone ) , pile up ( smaller for the engineered bone ) , and fracture mechanisms ( microcracks for the engineered bone ) were observed with the genetically engineered bone behaving more brittle than the femoral control . © 2004 Elsevier Ltd .

Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 1 1 . Introduction Bone regeneration presents a major challenge to orthopedic medicine . Current methods of treating massive bone loss mainly depend on artificial prostheses , which fail in the long term and often result in the loss of function and morbidity . Gene therapy offers a promising avenue to an efficient biological therapy for regenerating massive bone defects . In particular , Mesenchymal Stem Cell ( MSC ) - based tissue engineering has been reported to be an innovative and efficient approach for regenerating bone tissue in vivo ( Lieberman et al . , 1998 and 1999 ; Gazit et al . , 1999 ; Turgeman et al . , 2001 ; Moutsatsos et al . , 2001 ; Dumont et al . , 2002 ; Zilberman et al . , 2002 ; Dragoo et al . , 2003 and 2005 ; Dayoub et al . , 2003 ; Sugiyama et al . , 2005 ; Peterson et al . , 2005 ; Hasharoni et al . , 2005 ) . The expression of an osteogenic growth factor from the BMP family like BMP - 2 , BMP - 6 and BMP - 9 by MSCs exerts a paracrine effect on the host MSCs and an autocrine effect on the engineered MSCs ( Gazit et al . , 1999 ; Li et al . 2002 ) . Thus , enhanced bone formation is achieved by both the host MSCs and the engrafted engineered MSCs . In spite of the extensive research performed on genetically engineered stem cell - based bone tissue engineering during the last decade , no knowledge of the intrinsic structural and nanomechanical properties of such bone tissue exists . In order for this approach to be optimized for clinical settings , a thorough multiscale analysis of the chemical and physical properties needs to be systematically carried out . New nanoscale methodologies , applied in particular to bone , such as atomic force microscopy imaging ( Tai et al . , 2005 ; Hassenkam et al . 2004 ; Fantner et al . , 2004 , Fantner et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2003 ) high resolution force spectroscopy ( Thompson et al . , 2001 ; Currey 2001 , Fantner et al . , 2005 ) , and nanoindentation ( Tai et al . , 2005 ; Rho and Pharr 2000 ; Thompson et al . , 2001 ; Ferguson et al . , 2003 ; Hengsberger et al . , 2001 ) D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 2 enable a window into the fine details of structure and mechanical behavior at extremely small length scales . In some cases , micro - and macroscopic assays , which yield averaged quantities over larger length scales , may not be sensitive enough to identify the underlying differences between two different sample populations and hence , nanoscale studies are desirable . In addition , nanoscale methodologies are useful when the volume of material available is too small for larger scale analyses , for example with tissue - engineered bone formation in critical sized defects and mouse models . The accuracy of biomechanical properties reduced using traditional engineering beam theory applied to whole bone bending tests on mouse bone has also been questioned ( Silva , et al . 2004 ) . Nanoindentation studies , in particular , have focused on differences between cortical and trabecular bone ( Rho et al . , 1997 ) , variations as a function of distance from the osteonal center ( Hengsberger et al . , 2001 ) and through the femoral cortex ( Rho et al . , 1999a ) , anisotropy ( Fan et al . , 2002 ) , viscoelasticity and time - dependent plasticity ( Fan and Rho , 2002 ) , and variations due to mineral content ( Tai et al . , 2005 ; Ferguson et al . , 2003 ) . More clinically relevant studies are starting to appear including nanoindentation properties of aged bones ( Nalla et al . , 2005 ; Kavukcuoglu et al . , 2005 ; Rho et al . , 2002b ) the senescence - accelerated mouse as a model for senile osteoporosis ( Silva et al . , 2004 ; Malzbender , J . , 2005 ) , and rat osteopetrotic mutations ( Jamsa et al . , 2002 ) . Here we report , for the first time , a comparison of the nanoindentation properties and nanoscale deformation mechanisms of tissue - engineered bone derived from genetically engineered MSCs that were implanted ectopically in mice in vivo to native femoral bone adjacent to the transplantation site . Other supplementary techniques were employed to further interpret the nanoscale data including ; back - scattered electron ( BSE ) microscopy to estimate mineral content , Raman spectroscopy to identify chemical bonds , D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 3 energy dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) analyses for elemental analysis , histology and micro - computerized tomography ( µ CT ) scans for morphology and quantitative analysis . Such multitechnique investigations that combine new nanotechnological methodologies with traditional characterization tools will be crucial for the advancement of gene therapy and tissue engineering platforms towards the clinical settings . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Genetically engineered MSCs expressing BMP2 The genetic engineering of MSCs to express inducible rhBMP - 2 has been described in detail previously ( Moutsatsos et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , Cells from the C3H10T1 / 2 MSC line were transfected with a ptTATop - BMP2 plasmid vector that encodes for both a tetracycline transactivator and rhBMP - 2 . The inducible human BMP - 2 expression vector , ptTATop - BMP2 , has a bidirectional promoter ( TATA sequence ) and consists of six tetracycline operators flanked by two transcriptional units with opposite orientations . In this vector , the level of the transactivator , which activates the bidirectional promoter , as well as the expression of hBMP - 2 can be regulated by doxycycline , a derivative of tetracycline , yielding higher levels of gene expression as well as a greater frequency of inducible clones . The engineered MSCs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2mM L - glutamine , 100units / ml penicillin , 100units / ml streptomycin , and 10 % FCS ( Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) . Doxycycline was supplemented to the culture media in order to prevent cell differentiation before implantation . 2 . 2 . In vivo ectopic bone formation D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 4 For transplantations in vivo the BMP2 expressing MSCs were transplanted in the following manner : After trypsinization , aliquots of approximately 3 × 10 6 cells were seeded on pre - cut , biodegradable fiber mats ( 3×3mm ) fabricated by the process of electrospinning ( Li et al . , 2002 ) . Briefly , the solution of poly ( lactide - co - glycolide ) ( PLAGA , 50 : 50 ) in a mixture of DMF and THF ( 35wt . % ) was loaded into a glass syringe with a capillary nozzle . The polymer solution was then electrospun at an electric potential of 30 kV and at a working distance of 30cm under ambient conditions to develop fibers having diameters in the range of 4 - 8 µ m . Prior to transplantation , C3H / HeN female mice age 6 - 8 weeks ( n = 10 ) were anesthetized using ketamine - xylazine mixture , injected intra - peritoneal , and the skin of the thigh muscle was swabbed with isopropyl alcohol ( 70 % ) , and chlorhexidine gluconate ( 0 . 5 % ) . The skin and muscle were cut and the cell - seeded scaffolds were transplanted . Ectopic bone formation was monitored using in vivo fluoroscopy ( Premier Encore Fluoroscan , Hologic , MA , USA ) once in two weeks . Doxycycline was not supplemented to the mice drinking water in order to induce BMP - 2 expression , which would lead to bone formation . Four weeks post transplantation , when the formation of substantial bone tissue was verified by fluoroscopy , the mice were sacrificed . 2 . 3 Micro - Computerized Tomography ( µ CT ) A quantitative morphometric analysis of the bone formation , in intramuscular transplants , was undertaken using µ CT scanning ( micro - CT40 , Scanco , Switzerland ) . Mice were sacrificed and the transplanted leg was dissected and subjected to micro - CT scan in vitro at a resolution of 20 µ m . The bone tissue was segmented from marrow and soft tissue using a global thresholding procedure . In addition to the visual assessment of D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 5 structural images , morphometric indices were determined from the microtomographic datasets using direct 3D morphometry ( Muller et al . , 1997 ; Hildebrand et al . , 1999 ) . The ectopic bone volume was computed by contouring the ectopic bone image and the bone density was calculated according to the ratio of bone volume to total tissue volume . 2 . 4 Bone sample preparation Following ex vivo µ CT scanning , bone samples were dissected from the sacrificed animals , rinsed with PBS , and embedded in glycol methacrylate using a JB - 4 embedding kit ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , PA , USA ) in vacuum , according to the manufacturer protocol . Samples were prepared without chemical fixation , demineralization etches , or alcohol dehydration and stored in aqueous solution to ensure maximum hydration and as close to physiological conditions as possible . Blocks were cut with a diamond impregnated saw ( Buehler ) and then polished on Al 2 O 3 paper ( South Bay Technologies ) from 9 - 0 . 05 µ m grit size . For histology , the bones were fixed in 4 % buffered formalin for 24hours and decalcified in 0 . 5M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid for three weeks . Samples were then passed through ethanol grade and embedded in paraffin . Paraffin blocks were sectioned into 5 µ m thick sections using an automated microtome ( Leica RM2165 , Germany ) and stained using hematoxilin - eosin ( H & E ) and Masson’s Trichrome stains . 2 . 5 BSE , Raman Spectroscopy , and EDX A low vacuum electron detection ESEM ( Philips / FEI XL30 FEG - SEM , Hillsboro , Oregon USA ) was employed in back - scattered mode a water vapor environment to image uncoated samples ( electron acceleration = 15kV , operating current = 180µA , working D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 6 distance = 10 . 0mm , water vapor = 0 . 3Torr , depth resolution ~ 3 µ m , spatial resolution ~ 10 µ m ) . Mineral contents were calculated directly from grayscale pixel values which directly correlate with average atomic number and mineral content ( Skedros et al . , 1993 ) . Raman spectroscopy ( Kaiser Hololab 5000R , Ann Arbor , Michigan USA , depth resolution ~ 1 µ m , spatial resolution ~ 50 µ m ) was carried out at 785nm utilizing coherent CW Argon / Ion and Ti / S Lasers using a 100µm diameter optical fiber to maximize throughput . Elemental composition analysis was obtained via energy dispersive X - ray analysis ( EDX ) through a sapphire EDX detector ( EDAX , Mahwah , New Jersey , USA , depth resolution ~ 3 µ m , spatial resolution ~ 10 µ m ) with LEAP + crystals for optimal light element performance . 2 . 6 Nanoindentation Load - controlled nanoindentation experiments were conducted in ambient conditions using a Hysitron , Inc . ( Minneapolis , Minnesota USA ) Triboindenter and a Berkovich ( trigonal pyramid ) diamond probe tip following a protocol previously reported ( Tai et al . , 2005 ) . Each experiment involved a four segment load function ; a 3sec hold at zero load , a constant loading rate of 50µN / sec until the maximum set peak load was reached , a hold of 20sec , 1 and finally a constant unloading rate of 50µN / sec . Values for elastic moduli were calculated from 95 - 20 % of the initial unloading curve by fitting these data to contact mechanical theory for an isotropic , elastic half - space ( O - P method , Oliver and 1 To ensure that creep effects were kept at a minimum , the variation in elastic modulus was calculated ( Oliver and Pharr , 1992 ) for three different experiments ; 1 ) the hold period was varied between 10 to 90 sec . , 2 ) after the hold period , the sample was unloaded to 20 % of the maximum force and reloaded back to the maximum force for several cycles , and 3 ) the loading / unloading rate was varied by 2 orders of magnitude ( the limit of the instrument ) . All three series of experiments found that the variation in elastic moduli was < 10 % . D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 7 Pharr , 1992 ) . 2 Hardness ( H = maximum load / area at maximum load ) values were calculated from both the O - P contact area at maximum load and from contact areas measured by AFM imaging of residual indents immediately after indentation . 3 A 3 - way ANOVA statistical analysis as performed on 2500 indents using Systat software package ( Point Richmond , CA , USA ) which takes into account the different types of bone ( femoral and engineered ) , animal ( 6 different animals ) , and maximum loading ( 500 , 1000 , and 7000 µ N ) . Residual indents were imaged within a 20 minute time period after indentation using a Quesant Q - Scope 350 and Si 3 N 4 Wavemode NSC16 cantilevers in tapping mode as previously reported ( Tai et al . , 2005 ) . There were 6 pairs tested with ~ 50 indents per sample at each maximum load , where the indents were spaced 7 µ m apart creating a grid 60×60 µ m in size ( ~ 40 % of the total femur cross - section ~ 150 µ m ) . Tests were conducted parallel to the cortical long bone axis for the femoral bone and in the cortical - like surface region for the engineered bone . 3 . Results 3 . 1 µ CT Analysis 2 It is important to note that indentation moduli reported here as estimated by the O - P method should be regarded as " apparent " or " effective " since this model neglects plasticity , viscoelasticity , pileup , and anisotropy ( Oliver and Pharr , 2004 ) and the fact that they are known to vary with length scale ( Malzbender , 2005 ) . Recently , more advanced theoretical approaches have started to be developed which are continuum mechanical in nature such as anisotropic elastic and elastic - perfectly plastic finite element analysis ( Fan et al . , 2004 ; Tai et al . , 2005 ) , poro - micromechanical models ( Hellmich and Ulm , 2005 ) , and two - phase composite formulations ( Oyen and Ko , 2005 ) . These models will be explored in future studies but for the purposes of this paper , i . e . to compare an experimental model and a control , the O - P method is sufficient ( Tai et al . , 2005 ) and also has the advantage of enabling the analysis of a larger amount of data ( > 2500 indentation curves ) to get a more accurate statistical distribution in a reasonable period of time . 3 The hardness calculated by the O - P method represents resistance to total deformation ( elastic , viscoelastic , plastic ) while the AFM calculated hardness represents resistance to plasticity . The O - P hardness has a tendency to underestimate the contact area , hence overestimate the hardness ( Oliver and Pharr , 2004 ) . D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 8 µ CT scans shown in Fig . 1 indicate significant growth of ectopic bone in between the femur and tibia at the transplantation site . Quantitative analysis performed on the scanned engineered bone tissue indicated that the average bone volume reached 21 . 84±2 . 61 SE mm 3 ( n = 6 ) . The bone density ( bone volume normalized by the total tissue volume ) was calculated to be 0 . 19±0 . 0051 SE ( n = 6 ) . 2D images demonstrate that the new bone tissue is composed of distinct compact ( Fig . 1c ) and trabecular regions ( Fig . 1d ) , as indicated by the degree of porosity on the outer rim and the inner region , respectively . The outer and inner surfaces of the cortical – like region can be visualized using 3D reconstruction images ( Fig . 1a – outer aspect ; Fig . 1b – mid section showing inner aspect ) . All implants formed an oval - shaped structure following the initial 3D structure of the scaffold on which the cells had been seeded prior to implantation . These images highlight the powerful osteogenic potential of genetically engineered MSCs , which can induce robust bone formation within a short period of time . 3 . 2 Histological Analysis H & E staining of 5 µ m sections of the newly formed engineered bone four weeks post implantation validated the results obtained by µ CT scans ( Fig . 2 ) . A dense region of bone was seen at the outer aspect of the implant resembling compact bone . In the inner compartment of the implants more sparse bone trabecules were evident ( Fig . 2b - d ) surrounded by bone marrow . Thus , the inner compartment showed resemblance to native trabecular bone tissue . The presence of collagen within the new engineered bone trabecules was further demonstrated by a positive Masson’s Trichrome staining ( Fig . 2e , f ) . D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 9 3 . 3 Surface Morphology and Topography A BSE image of the femoral cortical bone ( view down the long axis , Fig . 3a ) shows a relatively uniformly mineralized structure ( as reflected by the image grey scale ) over ~ 1 / 10 of the entire femoral cross - section with uniformly shaped and oriented lacunae and canaliculi . The genetically engineered bone ( Fig . 3b ) shows a similar degree and uniformity of mineralization as the femoral bone , but with larger lacunae that are more nonuniform in orientation and shape . Canaliculi were also observed . The femoral bone and engineered bone samples were found to exhibit ~ 5 % and ~ 10 % porosity , respectively , as calculated from the lacunae visible in the BSE images . The distributions of weight percent mineral content ( Fig . 4 ) measured from BSE image analysis were found to be statistically similar ( p < 0 . 001 ) for genetically engineered ( 61 . 2±3 . 3wt . % ) and femoral bone ( 64 . 6±2 . 0wt . % ) . Smaller scan size BSE images ( Fig . 5 ) reveal that the smaller length scale nanostructure for both the femoral and engineered bone are similar as well . 3 . 4 Chemical Analysis Raman spectra for the cortical and cortical - like regions of the femoral and engineered bone , respectively , showed similar structural compositions ( Fig . 6 ) and peaks characteristic of the mineral and organic phases . The increase in intensity for the amide I band in the engineered bone has been suggested to be due to an increase in non - reducible pyridinoline cross - link content in collagen ( Nalla et al . , 2005 ) . An EDX analysis comparison indicates elemental composition and relative mineral content proportions in both types of bone to be similar as well ( Fig . 7 ) . The Ca / P ratio for the femoral and engineered bone were found to be 0 . 77 and 0 . 70 , respectively . D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 10 3 . 4 Nanoindentation Force vs . indentation depth data for one pair of femoral and genetically engineered bone were averaged and plotted together ( Fig . 8 ) . The genetically engineered bone ( E ~ 19 . 8±5 . 6GPa , H ~ 0 . 9±0 . 4GPa ) was statistically less stiff and had a lower average hardness than the femoral bone ( E ~ 27 . 3±10 . 5GPa , H ~ 1 . 0±0 . 7GPa ) ( n = 2449 , p < 0 . 0005 , Fig . 9 ) , as calculated from the O - P method . Statistical differences between animals as well as maximum loads were observed for both modulus and hardness values ( p < 0 . 0005 ) . The modulus and hardness values were found to increase with decreasing maximum load . The distribution of calculated modulus and hardness values ( Fig . 10 ) for both types of bone appear multimodal at lower maximum loads and homogenize and narrow at higher maximum loads . The engineered bone exhibited a broader distribution in elastic moduli . Hardness values calculated via AFM imaging of residual indents ( n = 6 ) were 0 . 7±0 . 2 and 0 . 8±0 . 3 , for the femoral and engineered bone respectively ( not statistically different , p > 0 . 01 which is likely due to the small number of datapoints available ) . 3 . 5 TMAFM Imaging of Residual Indents TMAFM images ( Fig . 11 ) show clear residual viscoelastic plastic deformation localized within the indent regions and a granular morphology away from the indent region for both samples . Flattening of these surface topographical features was observed within the indent region for both samples . The femoral bone exhibited pileup along the edges of the indent ( ~ 100nm in height ) while the genetically engineered bone did not ( Fig . 11b , d ) . Along the edge of the engineered bone indent impression , microcracks were observed that were not apparent in the femoral bone ( Fig . 11e , f ) . The average maximum D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 11 lateral dimension of the topographical features away from the deformed region for the femoral and engineered bone were 158±80 and 145±60nm , respectively which were found to be statistically different ( Fig . 12 , p < 0 . 05 ) . The peak - to - valley height values , for the femoral and engineered bone , were measured to be 34±13 and 34±15nm , respectively which were not statistically different ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The appearance and dimensions of these features are slightly greater than that of previous studies of mineral particles in bone as determined by TMAFM ( Eppell et al . , 2001 ) , SAXS ( Fratzl et al . , 1992 ) and X - ray diffraction ( Landis 1995 ; Biltz and Pellegrino , 1969 ; Mann , 2001 ; Wachtel and Weiner , 1994 ) . This observation is likely due to assemblies of crystallites adhering together to form larger surface morphological features as individual platelets were not isolated from each other by chemical means . 4 . Discussion Nanoindentation has shown to be a viable technique for quantifying the bio ( nano ) mechanical properties of small volumes of tissue engineered bone produced in vivo . Table 1 compares structural and nanomechanical data obtained from mice femoral and genetically engineered ectopic bone . While the two types of bone were found to have similar mineral contents , overall porous microstructures showing lacunae and canaliculi , chemical compositions , and nanoscale topographical morphologies , apparent elastic moduli reduced from nanoindentation data were found to be statistically different with the femoral bone ( indented parallel to the bone long axis ) being ~ 1 . 4× stiffer than the engineered bone . The average value obtained for the femoral bone ( ~ 27GPa ) is slightly lower than that reported in the literature for femoral mouse cortical bone loaded in the D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 12 same direction using nanoindentation which was found to be ~ 31GPa ( Silva , et al . 2004 ) and 43 . 5 - 35 . 2GPa ( Kavukcuoglu , et al . 2005 ) and may be due to the effects of alcohol and / or dehydration used in these studies ( Rho and Pharr , 1999 ) . O - P calculations showed that the femoral bone was ~ 1 . 1× harder than the engineered bone , and hence exhibited a greater resistance to total deformation ( the sum of elastic , viscoelastic , and plastic ) . Since mineral content and nanoscale morphology were statistically similar for both types of bone , these parameters can not be responsible for these material property trends . The Raman - suggested increase in collagen crosslink density for the engineered bone relative to the femoral would be expected to result in an increase in modulus , and hence can not be responsible as well . Hence , other origins could be ; 1 ) variations in the overall organization and interactions between the organic and mineral constituents and / or 2 ) variation in the composition and / or supramolecular structure of the organic component . Such variations could result from differences in age ( i . e . the femoral bone is 10 - 12 weeks old and the ectopic is 4 weeks old ) and / or loading conditions ( i . e . the femoral bone is weight bearing while the ectopic is non - weight bearing ) . Ongoing nanotechnological studies provide a promising pathway to further investigate both of the above hypotheses , including ; high resolution tapping mode AFM imaging as a function of acid demineralization ( Tai , et al . 2005 ) and chemically and spatially specific high resolution force spectroscopy ( Dean , et al 2005 ) . Lastly , the engineered bone also exhibited a more heterogeneous distribution of material properties likely because the overall structure seems to exhibit a lesser degree of regularity than the femoral bone . Direct visualization of the nanoscale mechanisms of deformation via in - situ high resolution tapping mode AFM imaging was achieved . Generally , both samples exhibited similar viscoelastic plastic deformation at the length scales studied in this paper . D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 13 However , fine differences in the residual indent area ( smaller for the engineered bone ) , pile up ( smaller for the engineered bone ) , and fracture mechanisms ( microcracks for the engineered bone ) were observed with the genetically engineered bone behaving more brittle than the femoral control . Viscoelastic / plastic deformation at this length scale may arise from a variety of mechanisms including ; mineral particle displacement , underlying porosity and voiding which would relieve triaxial stresses , collagen fibril slippage , collagen denaturation , debonding of mineral - organic interfaces , crosslink scission , crack formation and propagation , deformation and structural phase transformation , viscous stretching of the organic component , and rupture of self - healing sacrificial bonds . Again , further nanomechanical studies will be able to shed insight into which deformation mechanisms may be dominant . Future studies in this area include nanoindentation of the trabecular - like regions in the engineered bone , the rate dependence of nanoscale properties , the temporal evolution of bone remodeling , and the effects of mechanical loading of bone formation and adaptation , and at different implantation sites including critical - size bone defects in flat and long bones . The long term goal is to employ such nanomechanical methodologies as an optimization tool in the field of bone tissue engineering in general , for example via implanted cell number , transgene duration of expression , and scaffold design and composition . Such an optimization process will be crucial to the advancement of the tissue engineering strategy , described in this study , towards human clinical trials . 5 . Acknowledgements D . Gazit and K .

Figure Legends Fig . 1 . 3D ( a and b ) and 2D ( c and d ) µCT images of femoral and genetically engineered bone ( the latter indicated by arrows ) . 3×10 6 BMP2 expressing MSCs were implanted in the thigh muscle of C3H / HeN mice . Four weeks post implantation the mice were sacrificed and the legs were subjected to µCT scans at 20µm resolution . Images obtained by µCT demonstrated the formation of new bone tissue within the implantation site . The new tissue had an outer cortical - like surface ( c ) and an inner compartment showing cancellous - like features ( d Engineered bone was formed as an oval - shaped structure following the initial shape of the polymeric scaffold on which the cells were seeded . The outer ( a ) and inner ( b – mid section ) surface of the cortical - like region can be visualized using a 3D reconstruction of the µCT scans . Fig . 2 . Histological evaluation of genetically engineered bone . Following µCT scans ; bone samples were fixed in formalin and processed for histology . Hematoxilin - Eosin staining of 5µm paraffin sections demonstrated the formation of an outer region of dense bone tissue , surrounding an inner compartment containing a cancellous - like inner portion D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 19 ( a ) . Higher magnifications showed the presence of bone marrow within in the new bone ( b , c , d ) . Masson’s Trichrome staining indicated that the engineered bone was composed of collagen fibers stained with green color ( e , f ) . EB = engineered bone ; M = muscle ; BM = bone marrow . ( b is a 10× magnification of the inlet in a ; c is the magnification of the inlet in b ; d is the magnification of the inlet in c ) . Fig . 3 . Environmental back - scattered scanning electron microscope images at 500x magnification of ( a ) femoral and ( b ) genetically engineered bone . The femoral view orientation is along the long bone axis and the genetically engineered bone is the outer cortical - like surface . Elongated pores are visible with an average aspect ratio of 3 . 4±1 . 0 and average maximum dimension of 9 ± 2µm that correspond well with the typical size of osteocyte lacunae ( Currey , 2002 ) . The maximum dimension of these pores is highly oriented within the section circumferentially . Closer inspection reveals the presence of channels emanating from the lacunae ( a ) , which are presumably canaliculi . Osteons are not observed since mouse cortical bone does not undergo Haversian remodeling in the same manner as larger animals ( e . g . bovine , human , etc . ) ( Bianco and Robey , 2000 ) . BSE images of the cortical - like outer shell of the genetically engineered bone ( b ) shows a similar degree and uniformity of mineralization as the femoral bone , but with larger pores that are more nonuniform in orientation and shape with an average aspect ratio of 2 . 4±1 . 0 and average maximum dimension of 13±5µm where both of these parameters were statistically different from the femoral bone ( p < 0 . 01 ) . It this section , we observe two larger , more circular pores surrounded circumferentially by elongated pores in the central portion of the section , and elongated pores with their long axes aligned parallel to the outer edge of the section . Canaliculi were also observed . Fig . 4 . The distributions of weight percent mineral content measured from BSE image analysis of 4×4 µ m square regions separated by 7 µ m each ( total analysis size 40×40 µ m ) for the genetically engineered and femoral bone . Fig . 5 . Environmental back - scattered scanning electron microscope images at 2000x magnification of ( a ) femoral and ( b ) genetically engineered bone . The femoral view orientation is parallel to the long bone axis . Heterogeneities in mineral content are visible and darker streaks throughout , whose dimensions are consistent with canaliculi . The femoral bone appears to have small localized regions of high mineral content and oriented striations running throughout the entirety of the image . While some regions appeared anisotropic , completely oriented striations were not observed in the engineered bone . Fig . 6 . Raman spectra for the femoral and genetically engineered bone ( a ) between 0 and 3500 cm - 1 and ( b ) expanded region between 1400 and 1700 cm - 1 . The notable peaks at 1080 , 960 , 595 , and 435 cm - 1 correspond to typical phosphate and carbonate bonding ( Carden et al . , 2003 ; Tarnowski et al . , 2002 ) from the mineral phase . The most prominent peak at 960 cm - 1 which corresponds to the phosphate ion P - O υ 1 symmetric stretch , is observed in both bone materials . ( b ) Peaks at 1445 and 1655 cm - 1 specify the presence of a CH 2 wag and amide I bond , respectively , from the organic phase . D . Gazit and K . Tai et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 20 Fig . 7 .

Typical nanoindentaion data on loading and unloading using a Berkovich probe tip comparing femoral and genetically engineered bone from one particular mouse at maximum loads of ( a ) 500 , ( b ) 1000 , and ( c ) 7000 µN at a loading rate of 50 µN / sec . There were > 50 indents for each averaged curve where each indent was spaced 10 µm apart . The horizontal error bars represent ± standard deviation and are typical for the entire loading curve ( i . e . vary by < 5 % with load ) . The femoral view orientation is parallel to the long bone axis and the genetically engineered bone is the outer cortical - like surface . Fig . 9 . Apparent ( a ) moduli and ( b ) hardnesses reduced from nanoindentation data via the Oliver - Pharr method ( Oliver and Pharr , 1992 ) for 6 different bone sample pairs ( i . e . 6 difference mice ) with > 50 indents for each set of data . . The femoral view orientation is parallel to the long bone axis and the genetically engineered bone is the outer cortical - like surface . Hi - lo bars represent one standard deviation . Fig . 10 .

TMAFM amplitude images and section profiles are given of the residual impressions after loading and unloading to 7000 µ N using a Berkovich probe tip at a loading rate of 50 µN / sec . The ( a ) femoral view orientation is parallel to the long bone axis and ( b ) the genetically engineered bone is the outer cortical - like surface . Amplitude images are reflective of abrupt surface topographical changes . Sectioned line scans through corresponding height images ( not shown ) show significant pileup for the ( c ) femoral bone , but a negligible amount for the ( d ) engineered bone . Signs of crack formation is not evident for the ( e ) femoral bone but is suggestive for the ( f ) engineered bone along the edge of the indent impression . Fig . 12 .
