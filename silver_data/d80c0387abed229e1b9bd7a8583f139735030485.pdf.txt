In the present study , the authors focused on psychotherapeutic insight to identify the different effects of novelty and appropriateness . Three experiments were conducted ( total N = 452 ) using a micro - counseling dialogue ( MCD ) paradigm , which can induce stable and differential insights by providing different types of solutions to mental distress problems ( Experiment 1 ) and negative descriptions ( Experiment 2 ) . Further , in Experiment 3 , the authors improved the study by employing a group of high school students with test anxiety ( assessed using the Test Anxiety Inventory ) , which was more ecological . Across the three experiments , higher insightfulness and pleasantness were induced by high novelty ( experiments 1 and 2 ) and appro - priateness ( experiments 1 to 3 ) . In Experiment 3 , the effect of test anxiety was found , wherein the low - test anxiety group generated higher insightfulness compared to the high - test anxiety group , and this effect was stronger in the inappropriateness condition . The results provide evidence that novelty and appropriateness are key factors in inducing psychotherapeutic insightfulness . ARTICLE HISTORY Received May 21 , 2020 Introduction In the psychotherapy domain , insight has been defined as a client’s formation of a new understanding of them - selves and the world with a counselor’s assistance , which includes the establishment of new connections that might lead to positive effects , such as symptom change and fostering positive feelings ( Castonguay & Clara , 2007 ) . Insight is not only considered a salient character - istic of a good therapist ( Novotney , 2013 ) , but empirical studies have also examined the role of the patient’s insight on symptom improvement . A meta - analysis study ( Jennissen , Huber , Ehrenthal , Schauenburg , & Dinger , 2018 ) systematically examined the association between patients’ insights and psychotherapy outcomes in various psychotherapy treatments , such as psychody - namic , cognitive behavior , unspecific counseling , and emotion - focused , and a significant moderate correlation was observed between the two . Its magnitude is compar - able with the effect sizes of established treatment factors , such as the therapeutic alliance ( Flückiger , Del Re , Wampold , & Symonds , 2012 ; Horvath , Del Re , Flückiger , & Symonds , 2011 ) , positive regard ( Farber & Doolin , 2011 ) , and empathy ( Elliott , Bohart , Watson , & Greenberg , 2011 ) . This evidence emphasizes the impor - tant role of insight in improving clinical symptoms ; however , the specific elements that facilitate insight in psychotherapy and may lead to different levels of insight have been rarely studied . Insight , one of the most typical forms of creativity in cognitive psychology , has received much attention in recent decades ( Dietrich & Kanso , 2010 ) , which is a sharp contrast to the limited studies conducted in the field of therapeutic insight . Recent studies have focused on insightful problem - solving with various paradigms using riddles ( Huang , Tang , Sun , & Luo , 2018 ; Luo & Niki , 2003 ) , the chunk decomposition of Chinese char - acters ( Huang , Fan , & Luo , 2015 ) , and ambiguous pic - tures ( Ludmer , Dudai , & Rubin , 2011 ) as experimental materials to induce controllable insight . Since it has been long agreed ( Runco & Jaeger , 2012 ; Stein , 1953 ) that creativity contains the two key elements of novelty ( also as new , originality ) and appropriateness ( also as usefulness , value ) , two studies – Huang et al . ( 2015 ) and Huang et al . ( 2018 ) – have manipulated novelty and appropriateness to investigate brain activity during insightful problem - solving processes using the chunk deposition paradigm and the riddle paradigm , CONTACT Wencai Zhang zhangwc @ psych . ac . cn 16 LinCui Road , Chaoyang District , Beijing 100101 , P .

CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 2021 , VOL . 33 , NO . 3 , 311 – 320 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1080 / 10400419 . 2021 . 1940032 © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group , LLC respectively . The results show that besides some shared brain activation , novelty and appropriateness also spe - cifically activate a distinct neural circuit , which points to the unique contributions of these two factors to creative insight . Additionally , studies with divergent thinking paradigms ( Diedrich , Benedek , Jauk , & Neubauer , 2015 ; Runco & Charles , 1993 ; Runco , Illies , & Eisenman , 2005 ) have sought to establish the contribu - tion of novelty and appropriateness to creativity and suggested that the authors should accurately measure creativity by manipulating the two factors . Based on the above - mentioned evidence , manipulating the two factors of novelty and appropriateness in a psychotherapeutic scenario to explore their influence in inducing therapeutic insight could be of great value . There are some stimulating discussions on the ele - ments of insight in psychotherapy that are closely related to novelty and appropriateness . First , some studies qua - litatively analyzed interactive communication between patients and therapists and suggested that several psy - chological elements were helpful to insight generation in psychotherapy ( Elliott , 1985 , 1994 ; Mahrer & Nadler , 1986 ) . Elliott ( 1984 ) suggested that insight may have four elements , comprising metaphorical vision or seeing with figurative eyes , connections that include a perception of patterns and links , suddenness , and newness . Elliott ( 1994 ) further suggested a general model of insight events , comprising contextual priming ( a painful and problematic life event narrated to the therapist ) , novel information ( the new information takes the form of a therapist’s interpretation that is relevant to the clients’ specific painful event or general function ) , initial distantiated processing , insight , and elaboration . The authors considered contextual priming and novel information to have a similar conceptual meaning to the appropriateness and novelty of creativ - ity . However , these qualitative studies , by collecting therapeutic information simply provide preliminary evi - dence that identifies insight - related elements . Whether appropriateness and novelty can truly facilitate insight into psychotherapy under a controlled experimental set - ting has rarely been studied . Past studies have focused on measuring the effect of novelty on therapeutic insight or alleviating negative emotions . Several studies have been conducted on obser - ving the effect of novelty on therapeutic insight using textual micro - counseling dialogue ( MCD ) , which is orga - nized in a problem - solution form and is similar to the real therapy procedure of clients expressing their mental dis - tress problems and the therapist providing solutions ( Jiang , Yu , Zhang , & Zhang , 2016 ; Yu , Zhang , Fan , Luo , & Zhang , 2019 ; Yu , Zhang , Zhang , Zhang , & Luo , 2016 ) . They used therapeutic metaphors as a novel solution and literal solutions as a familiar solution , and found that a novel metaphorical solution induced greater insightful - ness and greater neural activation of the hippocampus and amygdala compared with literal familiar solutions . When these materials were adopted for a randomly con - trolled intervention experiment , therapeutic metaphors were found to induce greater insightfulness and improve - ment of mental distress ( Hu , Zhang , Zhang , Yu , & Zhang , 2018 ) . Specifically , this study applied the metaphorical and literal solutions of the MCD paradigm to observe the effect of the novelty factor on promoting therapeutic insight . To date , however , insufficient research has been per - formed into the effect of appropriateness on therapeutic insight in a strictly controlled setting . Some studies on metaphorical expressions have found that the factors of language context ( also called pragmatics ) , such as apt - ness , problem - solving , emotion , and difficulty , signifi - cantly affect metaphor comprehension ( Holyoak & Stamenkovic , 2018 ; Marmolejo - Ramos & Cevasco , 2014 ; Prat , Mason , & Just , 2012 ; Samur , Lai , Hagoort , & Willems , 2015 ) and suggest that in a problem - solving context , selective attention motivated by the content of a metaphor concept may similarly influence attention to the details of a target problem or its solutions ( Keefer & Landau , 2016 ) . Thus , the one might assume that an appropriate or inappropriate problem context of mental distress could affect the level of therapeutic insight induced by novel metaphorical solutions . In sum , this study is aimed at detecting the facilitating effect of appropriateness and novelty on therapeutic insight in a scenario of textual therapeutic talk using the MCD paradigm ( Yu et al . , 2016 ) across three experi - ments . The factor of appropriateness was manipulated by presenting an appropriate problem ( mental distress description ) or an inappropriate problem ( negative pic - ture description ) , and the factor of novelty was manipu - lated by presenting a metaphorical or literal solution . Besides measuring insightfulness , the authors would also take the positive emotion into account . In behavior cognitive therapy , therapists assume that the experience of joy in one emotion that is a frequent consequence of insight ( Holtforth et al . , 2007 ) , and the experience of joy would derive from two kinds of psychotherapy change process . Some insights solve or give the promise of solving the emotional problem ( negative reinforce - ment ) , and some insights create or give the promise of the creation of positive opportunities ( positive reinfor - cement ) . Thus , in the current paper , the authors hypoth - esis that novel and appropriate solutions will separately induce higher insightfulness and positive emotion , and a combination of the two will produce higher insightful - ness and positive emotion ( Hypothesis 1 ) . 312 R . LIU ET AL . The concept of insight in CBT is consistent with cognitive restructuring ( Holtforth et al . , 2007 ) , which means challenging an existing maladaptive thought and paradigm and replace it with an alternative para - digm which is more logical and adaptive . As a therapeutic technique , cognitive restructuring is widely applied in CBT when intervening various mental disorders ( Wolgast , Lundh , & Viborg , 2012 ) , including test anxiety ( Von Der Embse , Barterian , & Segool , 2013 ) . To further improve the experimental design to be more ecological , the authors would examine whether the effect of novelty and appropriateness to insightfulness and posi - tive emotion would be different in individuals who score high and low in test anxiety among high school students , for test anxiety is much intense in high school . The authors would hypothesis that individuals with anxiety symptoms will differ from normal individuals in produ - cing insightfulness and positive emotion ( Hypothesis 2 ) . Experiment 1 In Experiment 1 , the authors tested the hypothesis that novelty and appropriateness will affect the induced insight - fulness in a psychotherapeutic scenario . The authors pro - posed that novelty and appropriateness would at least separately affect insightfulness ; the greater the novelty or the appropriateness , the greater would be the insightfulness . Materials and methods Participants The study participants comprised 32 undergraduate and graduate students from several universities in Beijing recruited through online advertisements . The participants received monetary compensation . The sample was 53 % female , with a mean age of 22 . 9 years ( SD = 2 . 27 ) . The data collection did not depend on any analysis of the results . 1 The participants reported normal or corrected normal vision and no history of mental distress . The study , comprising the three experiments , was approved in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Institute of Psychology , Chinese Academy of Sciences . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants . A post - hoc power analysis , using G * Power version 3 . 1 . 9 , showed that a sample size of 32 yields a power of 95 % when high effect sizes ( f2 ) were set as 0 . 4 ( based on Cohen , 2013 ) and at a significance level of 5 % ( two - sided ) , which indicating that the current sample size is effective . Materials ● The materials comprised 64 experimental stimuli that were problem - solution pairs , selected from Yu et al . ( 2016 ) . They were randomly assigned into four experimental conditions according to whether the problem was appropriate or not and whether the solution was novel or not , and each condition was made up of 16 pairs of experimental stimuli . These stimuli were randomly presented to each partici - pant . The experimental conditions were as follows : For appropriateness , the textual expressions of real distressed problems were set as high appropriate , and the equilong blank expressions of the mean - ingless symbol of ××× were set as low appropriate ; for novelty , the metaphorical and literal solutions were set as high and low levels of novelty , respec - tively . Ultimately , we obtained four conditions : pro - blem - metaphorical ( described as HAHN ) , problem - literal ( described as HALN ) , blank - metaphorical ( described as LAHN ) , and blank - literal ( described as LALN ) .

CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 313 Procedures The current study adopted a 2 ( problems , high vs . low ) × 2 ( novelty , high vs . low ) within - subjects design . The experimental stimulus was presented via E - prime 2 . 0 software . Specifically , a fixation point “ + ” was first presented in the center of the screen ( 500 ms ) ; then a problem would appear ( 8000 ms ) . Participants were told to carefully read and comprehend the problem and vividly imagine the scenarios described . Then another fixation point ( 500 ms ) and a solution ( 8000 ms ) would appear . After the presentation , participants were asked to evaluate the solutions on a 9 - point scale in terms of insightfulness , novelty , and appropriateness , with 1 point indicating a solution had the least effect and 9 points indicating it had the most , and emotional valence , with 1 point indicating a study had the most negative valence and 9 points indicating it had the most positive valence . The authors declared all the measures , manipulations , and exclusions for each study . Results and discussion We performed a two - way repeated - measure ANOVA featuring appropriateness ( high vs . low ) and novelty ( high vs . low ) as independent variables , and ratings of insightfulness and emotional valence as dependent vari - ables . Additionally , the ratings of novelty and appropri - ateness as check variables were measured , and the novelty and appropriateness factors were found to have been successfully manipulated ( see supplementary materials ) . For insightfulness , the ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of appropriateness , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 4 . 251 , p = . 048 , η p2 = . 121 , showing that the ratings of insight - fulness were higher in the high appropriate condition ( M = 5 . 741 , SD = 0 . 157 ) than in the low condition ( M = 5 . 287 , SD = 0 . 221 ) . On the other hand , a significant main effect of novelty was also observed , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 12 . 332 , p = . 001 , η p2 = . 285 , indicating that ratings of insightfulness were higher when the solution was metaphorical ( M = 5 . 910 , SD = 0 . 196 ) than literal ( M = 5 . 118 , SD = 0 . 190 ) . There was no statistically Figure 1 . Results of experiment 1 and experiment 2 . 314 R . LIU ET AL . significant interaction of appropriateness and novelty ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 1 . 167 , p = . 288 , η p2 = . 036 , ( See Figure 1 ) . Second , for emotional valence , the ANOVA showed a moderately significant main effect of appropriateness , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 3 . 133 , p = . 087 , η p2 = . 092 , showing that pleasantness ratings were higher in the high appropriate condition ( M = 6 . 265 , SD = 0 . 147 ) than in the low condition ( M = 6 . 133 , SD = 0 . 142 ) . Moreover , a signifi - cant main effect of novelty was revealed , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 6 . 629 , p = . 015 , η p2 = . 176 , indicating that pleasant - ness ratings were higher when the solution was meta - phorical ( M = 6 . 345 , SD = 0 . 139 ) than literal ( M = 6 . 053 , SD = 0 . 162 ) . There was no statistically significant inter - action of appropriateness and novelty , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 0 . 302 , p = . 586 , η p2 = . 010 . These results suggest that ( 1 ) a novel solution and appropriate scenario induces higher insightfulness and pleasantness ; thus , the hypothesis of Experiment 1 is supported and ( 2 ) the blank condition may not be an ideal control condition since it only employed a meaningless symbol without any sentence comprehen - sion and negative affect . Therefore , Experiment 2 was conducted to improve this case . Experiment 2 In Experiment 2 , the experimental conditions were further improved to investigate the effect of novelty and appropriateness on induced insightfulness in a psychotherapeutic scenario by replacing the blank condition in Experiment 1 with an objective description of a negative picture . Materials and methods Participants Participants comprised 60 graduate students from a university in Beijing recruited through online adver - tisements . All were provided with monetary compensa - tion . The sample was made up of 36 men and 24 women , with a mean age of 22 . 9 years ( SD = 0 . 889 ) . A post - hoc power analysis , using G * Power version 3 . 1 . 9 , showed that a sample size of 60 yields a power of 99 % when high effect sizes ( f2 ) were set as 0 . 4 ( based on Cohen , 2013 ) and at a significance level of 5 % ( two - sided ) , which indicating that the current sample size is effective . Materials The materials comprised 72 experimental stimuli that were problem - solution pairs with the MCD paradigm . They were selected from Yu et al . ( 2016 ) . Compared to Experiment 1 , the low appropriateness condition replaced the equilong blank expressions of a meaningless symbol of ××× with objective descriptive sentences of a negative picture . Thus , there were four conditions : problem metaphorical ( HAHN ) , problem - literal ( HALN ) , negative description - metaphorical ( LAHN ) , and negative description - literal ( LALN ) . Table 1 lists examples of the experimental materials . Procedures Experiment 2 also adopted a 2 ( appropriateness of pro - blems , high vs . low ) × 2 ( novelty , high vs . low ) within - subjects design . Experimental materials were presented in paper form for each participant individually . All the participants were told to carefully read and comprehend the materials and rate the solutions one - by - one on a 9 - point scale in terms of the dimensions of insightful - ness and emotional valence after reading , with 1 point indicating a solution had the least value and 9 points indicating it had the most . Results and discussion A series of two - way repeated - measure ANOVAs were conducted to clarify the effect of appropriateness and novelty on two ratings pertaining to the solution of insightfulness and emotional valence , respectively . Additionally , the ratings of novelty and appropriateness as check variables were measured , and the novelty and the appropriateness factors were found to have been successfully manipulated ( see supplementary materials ) . Regarding insightfulness , the authors detected results similar to study 1 that a significant main effect of appro - priateness was observed , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 4 . 445 , p = . 039 , η p2 = . 070 , showing that the higher appropriateness condi - tion ( M = 6 . 263 , SD = 0 . 178 ) elicited more insightfulness than lower appropriateness ( M = 6 . 180 , SD = 0 . 167 ) . A significant main effect of novelty was also observed , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 16 . 006 , p < . 001 , η p2 = . 213 , showing that the metaphorical condition ( M = 6 . 363 , SD = 0 . 171 ) elicited more insight than the literal condition ( M = 6 . 080 , SD = 0 . 180 ) . No significant interaction was found , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 2 . 523 , p = . 118 , η p2 = . 041 ] . Concerning the ratings of emotional valence , the authors found a main effect of appropriateness , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 21 . 100 , p < . 001 , η p2 = . 263 , showing that the higher appropriateness condition ( M = 6 . 869 , SD = 0 . 121 ) elicited greater pleasantness than lower appropriateness ( M = 6 . 672 , SD = 0 . 120 ) . No other significant main effect , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 0 . 967 , p = . 330 , η p 2 = . 016 , or interaction , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 0 . 006 , p = . 941 , η p2 < . 001 , was detected ( see Figure 1 ) . The results were consistent with Experiment 1 regarding the dimension of insightfulness that a novel solution and an appropriate scenario would induce CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 315 higher insightfulness , suggesting that novelty and appro - priateness may influence insightfulness separately . Since all the participants employed so far were normal under - graduates or graduates , the psychotherapeutic scenario may be more effective in a sample of high school stu - dents with anxiety symptoms . Therefore , in Experiment 3 , the authors ( 1 ) focused on high school students with anxiety symptoms and ( 2 ) tested the validity of the above results in a more ecological classroom situation . Experiment 3 In Experiment 3 , the authors focused on a specific popu - lation of high school students because high school stu - dents in China experience immense test anxiety . If the authors could find a moderate effect of anxiety , the results would consequently have some clinical implications . Materials and methods Participants The sample comprised 360 high school students ( 180 males ) in Grade 2 in Henan Province , China , with a mean age of 17 . 2 years ( SD = 0 . 671 ) . Of these , 14 participants were excluded from the formal experiment due to them failing to complete it . For the sample , the authors used a 15 % split in scores of the emotionality dimension of Test anxiety inventory to divide the parti - cipants into two groups ( high vs . low test anxiety ) . Participants whose test anxiety scores were ranked in the top 15 % and higher than 17 . 3 ( M + 1SD , M = 13 . 55 , SD = 3 . 76 ) were classified as the high - test anxiety group ( n = 48 ) , whereas those ranked in the bottom 15 % and lower than 9 . 79 ( M - 1SD ) were classified as the low test anxiety group ( n = 54 ) , A post - hoc power analysis , using G * Power version 3 . 1 . 9 , showed that a sample size of 101 yields a power of 95 % when high effect sizes ( f2 ) were set as 0 . 4 ( based on Cohen , 2013 ) and at a significance level of 5 % ( two - sided ) , which indicating that the current sample size is effective . Materials The materials were 54 problem - solution pairs with the MCD paradigm selected from Yu et al . ( 2016 ) . Compared to Experiments 1 and 2 , Experiment 3 only employed three types of dialogs : problem metaphorical ( HAHN ) , problem - literal ( HALN ) , and negative description - metaphorical ( LAHN ) . Test anxiety inventory ( TAI ) . The TAI is a 20 - item , self - report inventory , developed by Spielberger , Gonzalez , Taylor , Algaze , and Anton ( 1978 ) . The instrument comprises two subscales of worry and emo - tionality , and each subscale comprises 10 items scored on a 4 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( almost never ) to 4 ( almost always ) , with the total score ranging from 20 to 80 . The current study used an emotionality subscale . A Chinese version , revised by Ye and Rocklin ( 1988 ) , was used and Cronbach’s α of the emotionality subscale was 0 . 78 . Procedures Experiment 3 was conducted following a procedure similar to Experiment 2 . Results and discussion Experiences of solutions in the dimensions of insightful - ness and emotional valence were subjected to a two - way mixed - model ANOVA , with test anxiety ( high and low ) as a between - subject factor and problem - solution types ( HAHN , HALN , and LAHN ) as a within - subject factor . Additionally , the ratings of novelty and appropriateness as check variables were measured and the novelty and appropriateness factors were found to have been suc - cessfully manipulated ( see supplementary materials ) . First , within the dimension of insightfulness , a significant main effect of the problem - solution type was observed , F ( 2 , 200 ) = 55 . 055 , p < . 001 , η p2 = . 355 . A Bonferroni post - hoc test showed that the problem - metaphorical conditions ( HAHN , M = 7 . 089 , SD = 0 . 12 ) elicited significantly higher ratings of insightfulness than the negative description - metaphorical conditions ( LAHN , M = 5 . 899 , SD = 0 . 172 ) , p < . 001 , and no other significant difference was detected . Additionally , there was a significant main effect of group , F ( 1 , 100 ) = 4 . 666 , p = . 033 , η p2 = . 045 , meaning that the low test anxiety group ( M = 6 . 935 , SD = 0 . 159 ) generated more insightfulness from the solutions compared with the high test anxiety group ( M = 6 . 436 , SD = 0 . 168 ) . Moreover , the authors found a significant interaction between the problem - solution type and group , F ( 2 , 200 ) = 3 . 988 , p = . 020 , η p2 = . 038 . A further simple effect analysis indicated that the low test anxiety group pro - duced a higher rating of insightfulness ( M = 6 . 36 , SD = 1 . 58 ) than the high anxiety group ( M = 5 . 43 , SD = 1 . 87 ) only in the negative description - metaphorical solution condition , p = . 008 , and no other significant simple effect was detected . For emotional valence , the main effect of problem - solution type was observed , F ( 2 , 200 ) = 55 . 368 , p < . 001 , η p2 = . 356 . Further post - hoc tests revealed that pleasant - ness ratings in the problem - metaphorical condition ( HAHN , M = 7 . 181 , SD = 0 . 099 ) were significantly higher than in the negative description - metaphorical 316 R . LIU ET AL . condition ( LAHN , M = 6 . 46 , SD = 0 . 120 ) , p < . 001 , and no other significant difference was detected . Moreover , the main effect of groups was found , F ( 1 , 100 ) = 4 . 087 , p = . 046 , η p2 = . 039 , meaning that the high test anxiety group ( M = 6 . 744 , SD = 0 . 139 ) rated the solution less positive than the low test anxiety group ( M = 7 . 129 , SD = 0 . 131 ) . No interaction was detected , F ( 2 , 200 ) = 1 . 563 , p = . 212 , η p2 = . 015 ( see Figure 2 ) . In Experiment 3 , the authors found the effect of appropriateness ( by comparing HAHN and LAHN ) in the dimensions of insightfulness and pleasantness . Importantly , an interaction between the test anxiety group and novelty and appropriateness was observed , which further emphasized the role of appropriateness . General discussion In the study , the authors manipulated two key elements of creativity ( novelty and appropriateness ) in three experiments by progressively varying appropriateness conditions from a nonsense symbol to descriptions of negative pictures to explore the role of creative factors in inducing therapeutic insight . This study repeated the previous findings of the facilitation effect of novelty on therapeutic insight and further found the facilitation effect of appropriateness and the inhibition effect of test anxiety on therapeutic insight . Appropriateness induced greater insightfulness and pleasantness in all three experiments and showed a stable effect in all age groups . When the solution fitted the core mental distress that a problem delivered , the positive element of solutions , such as insightfulness and pleasantness , would be much better induced . In discussions of what could facilitate insight in psy - chotherapy , Grawe ( 2004 ) argued that “corrective experiences can be generated by triggering the schemas underlying the patient’s problematic experiences and behavior and then by overlaying them with new sche - mas , ” indicating the effect of the problem context in psychotherapy . More importantly , in the last chapter of the book , Insight in Psychotherapy ( Castonguay & Clara , 2007 ) , the authors summarized additional possi - ble dimensions , stages of attainment , consequences , and research questions of therapeutic insight , of which readiness ( or motivation ) was emphasized . They considered that clients would often demonstrate a readiness for moving forward with the insight process when they were confused and wanted to understand something about themselves . These clients’ states of puzzlement seemed to motivate active self - exploration , which could lead to new emotional aware - ness and insight . Socratic questioning as a key technol - ogy in cognitive behavioral therapy ( Beck , Wright , Newman , & Liese , 1993 ; Clark & Egan , 2015 ; Neenan , 2009 ) also emphasizes guiding clients using questioning to clarify the problems and thoughts that they have in their minds so that cognitive restructuring can be facili - tated . In addition , the representational change theory of insight ( Knoblich , Ohlsson , Haider , & Rhenius , 1999 ; Ohlsson , 1992 ) states that if the problem solver forms an inappropriate representation and wrong mental sets of the problem , the problem - solving process will be hindered . In the present study , the appropriate condi - tion provided an initial representation ( problem ) that was compatible with the goal representation provided by the solution in comparison to the inappropriate condition , thereby producing greater insightfulness . Huang et al . ( 2015 ) revealed similar results by utilizing the chunk deposition paradigm to explore the effect of appropriateness on insightful problem - solving . The behavioral results suggest that the participants achieved a shorter reaction time under appropriate experimental conditions , indicating that appropriateness improves the onset of insight . Figure 2 . Results of experiment 3 . CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 317 The authors found that a novel metaphor solution induced greater insightfulness and pleasantness , indicat - ing the critical role of novelty . This result is consistent with those of previous studies ( Hu et al . , 2018 ; Jiang et al . , 2016 ; Yu et al . , 2019 ) . Some studies have compared the effect of novel cognitive reappraisal and ordinary reappraisal on the negative emotional arousal of nega - tive pictures . They found that the creativity of cognitive reappraisals was positively correlated with the effective - ness of negative emotional regulation ( Wu , Guo , Tang , Shi , & Luo , 2017 ) and that novel cognitive reappraisal produced greater pleasantness and neural activations of the amygdala , hippocampus , and ventral striatum than ordinary cognitive reappraisal , whether as immediate or long - term measures ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Other studies have found that cognitive restructuring ( or reappraisal ) of negative emotion overlaps with divergent thinking of creativity in both the ability of reappraisal’s generation ( Weber , Loureiro de Assunção , Martin , Westmeyer , & Geisler , 2014 ) and brain activation patterns ( Fink et al . , 2017 ; Perchtold et al . , 2018 ) . Novelty is a dominant factor in creativity and consistently correlates highly with creativity ( Runco & Charles , 1993 ; Runco et al . , 2005 ; Runco & Jaeger , 2012 ) . Thus , high novelty may induce high insightfulness because of its creativity . From a psychotherapeutic perspective , various orientations agree that insight is the formation of new perceptions , the establishment of new connections , and the gaining of new perspectives ( Hu & Jiang , 2010 ) , which clearly emphasizes the concept of newness . Since insight is a consequence of cognitive restructuring ( Luo & Knoblich , 2007 ; Yu et al . , 2016 ) , novel metaphor solu - tions contained greater cognitive restructuring elements in the current study than literal solutions , which could easily help clients establish new connections and trans - form maladaptive thoughts into new and adaptive per - spectives . Hence , clients can gain insightfulness . Nevertheless , in Experiment 3 , novelty did not success - fully distinguish insightfulness . It is speculated that the age characteristics of younger high school students and extreme grouping characteristics based on anxiety may be one reason for their insensitivity to the novelty effect on insightfulness . However , these participant character - istics did not reduce the effect of appropriateness on insightfulness . Experiment 3 found a significant interaction , where the test anxiety group gained less insightfulness when the context was not appropriate to the solution ( negative description - metaphor ) . Given that the present study employed metaphors as novel materials , the lower insightfulness may relate to a deficiency in perceiving the metaphor in an appropriate context for anxious individuals . Ishikawa , Suzuki , and Okubo ( 2018 ) found that people with social anxiety tended to be insensitive when associating “pleasantness” and “brightness , ” which is a familiar metaphorical association widely found in daily life . These results suggest that people with anxiety ( social anxiety or test anxiety ) may have some deficiency in understanding metaphors . Furthermore , some studies have considered the role of aptness in metaphor com - prehension . Aptness refers to “the extent to which the statement captures important features of the topic” ( Chiappe et al . , 2003 ) , which is a similar concept to appropriateness . Evidence has revealed that apt meta - phors are faster and easier to comprehend ( Gagné , 2002 ) and topics are more likely to be rated as category mem - bership of metaphorical terms ( Jones & Estes , 2005 , 2006 ) . The evidence suggests that the appropriate con - text may strengthen the connection between the pro - blem and solution , which promotes the understanding of the metaphor and thus facilitates insightfulness . This may be one reason for the lack of difference in insight - fulness between anxiety and no - anxiety groups when the problem context was appropriate to the solution , in comparison to inappropriate contexts . This study has some limitations . First , the experimen - tal conditions are progressive only on the dimension of appropriateness , and the variable of novelty was not manipulated further . Second , in Experiment 3 , the iden - tification of test anxiety was determined through the emotionality dimension of the test anxiety scale rather than the whole two dimensions or clinical samples . Third , the participants used in this study were college students and high school students ; and also , the stimuli of xxx and negative situation don’t have any meanings in the real therapeutic context , these conditions were only made for the experimental design , so the external of these two conditions should be carefully considered ; therefore , careful consideration should be taken when generalizing the results to other groups . In summary , this study explored the characteristics of insight in psychotherapeutic scenarios by manipu - lating two factors of creativity , novelty and appropri - ateness , and found that novelty and appropriateness separately affect insight and pleasantness . Theoretically , this study expanded the scope of insight research from the problem - solving domain of cognitive psychology to emotional psychological therapy situa - tions , which is closer to real - life situations . In addition , this research has certain application significance . First , the experimental design illustrates the impact of appro - priateness on inducing therapeutic insight , prompting us on the importance of the therapist in identifying problems during psychological counseling . Moreover , Experiment 3 selected a group of participants with test anxiety symptoms , affirming the ability and validity of 318 R . LIU ET AL . the textual micro - counseling paradigm in inducing therapeutic insight , thereby contributing to the appli - cation of this paradigm in clinical and interventional treatment . Note Sensitivity analysis was conducted with G * power 3 . 1 , and the parameters were set as follows in each analysis : alpha level 0 . 05 , power 0 . 80 , correlation among repeated measures 0 . 50 . The analysis showed that our sample of three experiments was sufficient to detect a small effect of f = 0 . 25 ( equivalent to η p2 = . 06 ) in Experiment 1 with a sample size of 32 ; f = 0 . 18 ( equivalent to η p2 = . 03 ) in Experiment 2 with a sample size of 60 ; and f = 0 . 13 ( equivalent to η p2 = . 017 ) in Experiment 3 with a sample size of 102 .
