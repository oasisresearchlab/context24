Beyond Just Rules : Server Rules for Shaping Positive Experiences in an Online Play Community for Youth KRITHIKA JAGANNATH , University of California , Irvine , USA 1 KATIE SALEN , University of California , Irvine , USA Rules , a quintessential property of any and every game , are one of the factors that influence player experiences . Online multiplayer games have two dimensions of rules that can be leveraged to improve player experiences – game rules that developers work with at the game design level and server rules that the player community creates and maintains . A few studies suggest that server rules can be leveraged to shape player experiences at the individual and community levels , but little work has investigated the role of server rules in play communities tailored for youth . The rise in online multiplayer gaming among youth motivates a need to understand how server rules shape the culture and climate of online communities . Using a mixed methods research approach , we analyzed server rules ( 1920 ) across 60 “ in - the - wild ” moderated Minecraft servers . We report on findings from a subset of 19 Minecraft servers explicitly tailored for young adolescents ( 475 rules ) . We offer a nuanced understanding of server rules in relation to youth developmental needs , particularly during early adolescence ( ages 7 - 14 years ) and discuss how server rules can be harnessed to shape positive player experiences in online gaming communities for all youth .

Rules reflect values such as cooperation , fairness , equity [ 46 ] , and shape social norms that eventually determine the governance mechanisms within play communities [ 41 , 63 , 78 , 110 , 119 , 124 ] . For example , governance in League of Legends was crowdsourced and drew from rules and social norms to determine the consequences of toxic behaviors [ 81 , 82 ] . In short , rules are a valuable component that can be leveraged to improve player experiences in online games . 1 Author ’ s addresses : Krithika Jagannath kjaganna @ uci . edu , Katie Salen , ksalen @ uci . edu .

CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . Although rules may be defined and grouped in different ways ( e . g . , formal , informal , unwritten ) , this work considers two main distinctions – game rules and social rules [ 73 , 125 , 130 ] . Simply put , game rules or “ designed rules ” [ 57 ] operate at the level of game design and are meaningful only within the context of a specific game ( i . e . gameplay ) . Social rules or “ written rules ” [ 57 ] that relate to social norms and etiquette , however , are meaningful within and outside the gameplay . These rules are defined by players ( i . e . , users ) at the play community level and are not the same as game rules . In online multiplayer games where players gather on a virtual server ( a designated play space for networked players ) , server rules correspond to a “ unique set of player - created rules concerning fair play and proper behavior ” ( [ 41 ] , p2 ) . Server rules attend to the collective experience and operate at the community level . Server rules help maintain an ideal player experience for all members of a community . From a deeper analysis of a game ’ s rules at the server level , we can start to understand the social and technological touchpoints that can be harnessed to improve experiences in play - communities . Little work has looked at analyzing server rules in online multiplayer games . For example , Donaldson [ 41 ] examined the relationship between game rules and community rules in the League of Legends and dynamics between players and game developers . To the best of our knowledge , no empirical work has sought to investigate server rules in the context of play communities for young adolescents ( YAs ) . According to the official fact release statement by the publisher ( Microsoft ) , 90 percent of the “ online population ” in the U . S . has heard of Minecraft and more than 50 percent of youth , ages 9 - 11 , in the U . S . and Europe play Minecraft ( Microsoft Fact Sheet 2021 [ 95 ] ) . We also know from public blogs and news articles that for many youths , their journey into Minecraft starts when they are much younger ( 6 - 7 years ) and continues well into their teens [ 104 , 127 ] . Minecraft , popular among youth and adults alike , has a unique characteristic in that any licensed user can spin a public Minecraft server and tailor the server to create a specific experience for players . With growing concerns around gaming practices where youth are concerned ( c . f . scholars petition against the World Health Organization ’ s proposal on gaming as a disorder [ 2 ] ) , it is vital to develop practices around rules that can support developmental needs while also keeping young adolescents safe . For many young people today , their journey into online multiplayer video games begins when they are very young ( typically 7 or 8 years , but sometimes even 5 years ) and continues well into their tweens and teens [ 31 , 55 , 99 , 104 , 127 ] . We wondered if there is something specific in the design of servers that define themselves as “ kid - friendly ” or “ family - friendly ” that support the unique developmental needs of younger players . Knowing more about such features can inform our understanding more generally about how online play - based platforms could be designed to take into account the interests and needs of youth [ 8 , 32 , 40 , 43 , 76 ] . Video games are an integral part of social life for many youth today [ 55 , 95 , 105 , 107 , 109 , 124 ] . In fact , video games are so integral to growing up these days that not playing video games tends to be an indicator that a child may be socially disconnected [ 116 ] . Online games are broken when it comes to supporting the needs of young adolescents or those between the ages of 8 and 12 . Despite official reports that youth ages 9 - 11 ( c . f . Microsoft Fact Sheet 2021 [ 95 ] ) and often much younger ( e . g . , as revealed by the lived experiences of youth in this work ) play Minecraft [ 107 ] , policies like COPPA ( Children ’ s Online Privacy Protection Act 2 ) , CIPA ( Children ’ s Internet Protection Act 3 ) , and platform - specific clauses do not acknowledge that players under 13 play video games like Minecraft . 2 https : / / www . ftc . gov / legal - library / browse / rules / childrens - online - privacy - protection - rule - coppa 3 https : / / www . fcc . gov / consumers / guides / childrens - internet - protection - act Beyond Just Rules 222 : 3 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) research shows that sandbox style ( i . e . open virtual worlds ) games like Minecraft may serve as online proxies for real world playgrounds , operating as interest - driven ( i . e . “ intrinsically motivated ” ) spaces where youth can explore their creative interests , build technical expertise , and form social connections with peers and near - peers [ 8 , 71 , 105 , 112 , 119 , 124 ] . Emerging evidence , although from limited studies clearly points to server rules as one of the mechanisms that can shape the social experiences for youth on gaming servers dedicated for them [ 57 , 111 , 112 , 124 ] . Despite Minecraft ’ s popularity among youth ( ages 6 - 14 ) , we have little empirical research about “ in - the - wild ” Minecraft servers that present themselves as “ kid - friendly ” or “ family - friendly ” ( Doyle 2014 ; Salen 2017 ) [ 1 , 114 ] . With more youth reportedly choosing to spend their time in online virtual world games [ 55 , 95 , 107 , 127 ] , it is imperative that we develop a more accurate understanding of how such interest - driven spaces can promote healthy social experiences in youth . To address this urgent opportunity , we set out with a broad question – what might server rules reveal about the kinds of play communities that gaming servers envision for their young players ? As part of a larger research agenda , we identified a subset of Minecraft servers known as kid - friendly servers that are specifically tailored for youth ( in general ages 7 - 14 ) . These servers include server rules as do many other moderated Minecraft servers such as Hypixel 4 which form the focus of our work in this paper . Given the developmental needs of YAs on such servers , we endeavor to understand how rules are being used in current approaches to the design of play communities by looking more closely at the meaningful characteristics of server rules . Furthermore , we wondered if there are distinct similarities and / or differences in the ways that rules are formulated in kid - friendly servers and those like Hypixel ( i . e . , not tailored for YAs ) . We conducted a mixed - methods study of server rules across 60 “ in - the - wild ” Minecraft servers to analyze server rules and the socio - technical forms of governance reflected in those rules . In this paper , we report select findings and offer two main contributions – i ) a thick description of salient characteristics of kid - friendly server rules in a subset of servers ( n1 = 19 ) ; and ii ) ii ) a set of guiding questions for creating server rules within gaming servers for youth . Through the current study we extend prior work by illuminating the ways in which server rules are characteristic of the kid - friendly genre . In the following section , we review select multi - disciplinary literature that motivate and lend the theoretical support for the work in this paper . We then describe the chosen research setting and methodological approach followed by three key themes based on our analysis of the data . We conclude with a broader discussion and recommendations for future work . Our findings offer insights into how server rules and practices around server rules lend themselves as key levers to shape positive play experiences in online gaming communities for youth . 2 RELATED WORK The review of prior work in this section draws from the allied disciplines of Games Studies , HCI , and related domains focused on youth development . First , we provide an overview of how prior work has been focused on understanding the role of rules in online multiplayer games . Through this understanding , governance emerged as an area that helps us understand how rules are enforced and operationalized for shaping player experiences in online communities . Given the target population of YA players as increasingly important stakeholders in online games , we review seminal 4 hypixel . net / 222 : 4 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . literature in the fields of Developmental Science and Learning Sciences as a way to understand their developmental needs . 2 . 1 Overview and Role of Rules in Online Multiplayer Games With greater emphasis towards designing improved experiences at the individual and the community levels within the CHIPlay and HCI communities ( [ 9 , 61 , 67 , 100 , 118 , 129 , 132 ] , several stakeholders including game developers , players , moderators , researchers , designers , and even parents / caregivers of youth players are eager to understand how to shape healthier social interactions and experiences for players and the play community writ large . Game developers have always leveraged game rules to improve player experiences [ 41 , 46 , 97 , 121 ] . In the case of World of Warcraft ( published by Blizzard Entertainment ) for example , developers modified game rules corresponding to player interaction to promote the values of equity for new players and autonomy for the more seasoned players [ 46 ] . Similarly , developers created a novel queuing system in the League of Legends ( Riot ) to enforce fair negotiations among players [ 41 ] . In contrast , fewer studies have focused on how social rules might improve experiences at both the player and community levels [ 3 , 96 , 98 ] . Research on the role of server rules in shaping experiences within play communities for young adolescents are few and far between [ 110 , 124 ] . Given that server rules contribute to the player experience it is important to understand their potential to positively shape the experience at both individual and community levels . 2 . 2 Rules as a Basis for Social Norms and Online Governance : HCI Scholarship HCI offers a wealth of knowledge on the role of rules as foundational blocks that inform social norms and the practices of community moderators . As Coleman explains , norms and formal rules establish social rights whereas laws establish what is legally right , although each right can exist independently without the other , support or even conflict with each other [ 28 , 29 , 108 ] . Social norms describe “ actions regarded by a set of persons as proper or correct , improper or incorrect . They are purposively generated , in that those persons who initiate or help maintain a norm see themselves as benefiting from its observed or harmed by its being violated . Norms are ordinarily enforced sanctions , which are either rewards for carrying out those actions regarded correct or punishments for carrying out those actions regarded as incorrect ” ( [ 28 ] , p . 242 ) . HCI Research suggests that rules should be clearly and explicitly articulated for the benefit of new and existing members of online communities [ 79 ] . Researchers in HCI have leveraged user / community - created rules and social norms to understand the governance mechanisms in those corresponding online communities including Minecraft ( e . g . , [ 26 , 45 , 79 , 112 , 124 ] ) . For example , Fiesler et al . ’ s analysis of a large dataset of community - created rules on the Reddit platform enabled the authors to produce a nuanced understanding of governance in sub - reddits [ 45 ] . The authors found that user - defined community rules are unique to their corresponding subreddits but also share some common attributes across those subreddits . In the same sense , Minecraft is analogous to the Reddit platform . The Minecraft platform stipulates a set of rules at the platform level and enables its users to define rules for their servers . Server rules may be authored by adults who serve as moderators on the Minecraft servers [ 111 ] , or by youth in the play community [ 124 ] . In a study of other virtual worlds for youth , Beals and Bers [ 8 ] emphasize on rules as a key feature for regulating an effective and safe community and suggest that rules can be authored by adults , youth , or both . In a design - led research study , Tekinbaş et al . [ 124 ] observed that community rules or agreements created by youth were effective without the traditional technological mechanisms on an after - school kid - friendly Minecraft server . Research Beyond Just Rules 222 : 5 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . shows that children are capable of understanding ( well - formulated ) rules starting at ages seven or eight [ 21 , 52 , 83 ] . They begin to construct their own rules or interpretations of rules especially through play [ 25 , 62 , 125 , 128 ] . 2 . 3 Play Communities for Youth : Developmental Science Perspectives Youth today are coming of age at a time when there is , in principle , a growing abundance of access not only to knowledge and information , but also to social connection [ 8 , 68 – 71 , 86 , 92 , 105 , 106 , 112 , 124 ] . However , children and adolescents are disproportionately affected by the risks of the digital world due to their developmental vulnerabilities and their status as “ early adopters ” of emerging technologies [ 76 , 89 , 90 , 92 , 126 ] . Research in Developmental Science and related fields shows that the quality of activities , particularly during early and middle adolescence ( ages 6 - 14 ) , are strongly correlated with brain development [ 34 , 36 , 37 , 53 , 64 , 66 , 85 ] . The development of one ’ s socio - emotional , cognitive , and physical abilities are aided through healthy social relationships with peers and other caring adults ( e . g . , parents , teachers , coaches ) as youth begin to expand their social connections [ 37 , 69 , 94 ] . Online communities , gaming servers , social and online media , for example , offer youth opportunities to connect with others around shared interests or engage in common activities [ 69 , 105 ] . However , we do not fully understand which combination of social and technological features might promote healthy online social behaviors in youth [ 43 ] . With youth reporting increased time spent online — including playing games with others — parents , educators , and technology developers are eager to better understand what shapes behavior online , positive , and negative behavior alike [ 47 , 68 , 75 , 86 , 104 , 105 , 112 , 116 , 126 , 127 ] . The growing discussion surrounding management of behavior in online spaces is tied , for example , to concerns about the impact disruptive and harmful behavior may have on children and adolescents [ 23 , 60 , 86 , 88 , 91 , 126 ] . These perspectives should be factored and addressed , but given the rise in online gaming among youth , it is just as important to understand how we might better support youth in interest - driven online spaces [ 8 , 32 , 76 , 116 ] . The science of adolescence underscores the importance of trusted and supportive social settings where young adolescents can explore and developer their identity and interests with peers and caring adults [ 34 , 37 – 39 , 42 , 84 ] . Addressing this need within an ever - evolving online world can be complex and challenging because multiple stakeholders including youth , parents and caregivers , facilitators , researchers , designers , practitioners , and policymakers may have competing goals and interests [ 116 ] . Be that as it may , understanding how we might better support youth interested in online gaming is a worthwhile endeavor in today ’ s networked and interconnected world . 2 . 4 Summary of Related Work We encounter rules as formal statements or unwritten rules in various settings in everyday life – at school or work , on the playground , on the freeway , at the dinner table , and so on . They help establish an understanding of common practices for what people can or cannot do , how they might be expected to behave , and consequences of their behaviors [ 79 , 102 , 103 ] . Prior HCI studies across various content - based and social networking platforms have sought to understand how rules defined at the platform / game - level and user - level shape values , social norms , and governance practices within corresponding online communities ( e . g . , [ 26 , 45 , 93 , 117 ] . Taken together , these studies suggest that formally published rules are an important component of community governance and help facilitate a better understanding of shared social norms , especially among new members . While game rules have been the focus of prior research , the area of server rules has 222 : 6 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . remained relatively underexplored . No work till date has examined server rules for young adolescents . To the best of our knowledge , the work presented in this paper is the first to examine server rules across “ in - the - wild 5 “ servers that have been tailored for youth . Additionally , our analytical approach draws from evidence - based research in Developmental Science and Learning Science which provide insights into the developmental perspectives of young adolescents . Through the work in this paper , we begin to identify opportunities for innovating player experiences through a deeper understanding of server rules in play communities tailored for youth . 3 RESEARCH SETTING & CHOSEN METHODOLOGY In this section , we describe the research context and chosen methodological approach for our study . 3 . 1 Minecraft Server Ecosystem : A Unique Gaming Platform for Understanding Server Rules Minecraft is a sandbox style virtual world game that is playable as a single - player or multiplayer experience . The gaming platform allows any licensed user to create their own multiplayer Minecraft server . This feature has led to a proliferation of servers that range in size from very small to very large ( e . g . , servers with 50 or fewer players to servers like Hypixel and Mineplex 6 that host 100 , 000 online players at a time ) . Most servers are locally managed or governed , as opposed to being centrally managed by the game ’ s developer ( Mojang [ 101 ] ) and publisher ( Microsoft ) . Online multiplayer gaming platforms like Minecraft can be viewed as a collection of rich socio - technical ecosystems comprising the “ big G ” and “ little g ” [ 48 , 49 ] . The social infrastructure ( big G ) corresponds to an online gaming community and a variety of socio - cultural practices that include playing games , talking about games , creating and sharing game - related content , and watching game play by others . The technological infrastructure ( little g ) corresponds to the gaming servers , their underlying software technologies , and may include online communication tools such as in - game chat , discussion forums , and external multimedia ( i . e . , text , voice , video chat ) applications . Minecraft is supported by an ecosystem that includes multimodal communication tools ( text , audio , and video chats ) or platforms such as TeamSpeak 7 , Discord 8 , and Mumble 9 . Each server ecosystem in Minecraft can be considered as an independent community with distinct server rules , social norms , and practices that can vary widely from server to server . As a result , multiplayer Minecraft servers can produce different kinds of experiences for players depending on how the servers are being governed . As part of a broader research agenda , we are interested in the multiplayer version of Minecraft , one of the most consistently top - ranked video games among youth [ 1 , 44 , 114 , 127 ] . 3 . 2 Kid - friendly or Family - friendly Minecraft Servers Kid - friendly or family - friendly servers [ 1 , 114 ] are specifically constructed as interest - driven spaces for youth typically between ages 7 through 14 . They are also intergenerational in that very young adolescents , older teen adolescents , and adults ( including parents , family - members , and grandparents ) often play together on a given server . These servers are managed by friendly and helpful server staff who not only reassure parents about kids ’ safety on the server through their 5 The use of “ in - the - wild ” in this work refers to servers that have been created by users as opposed to the creators ( Mojang ) or the publisher ( Microsoft ) and in not intended to imply the research context used in HCI ( e . g . , [ 33 , 113 ] ) 6 mineplex . com 7 https : / / www . teamspeak . com / en / 8 https : / / discord . com / 9 https : / / www . mumble . info / Beyond Just Rules 222 : 7 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No .

Server staff ( administrators , moderators ) promote kids ’ unique and creative interests whether it be playing as ardent fans of Harry Potter in a Hogwarts ’ themed world ( e . g . , The Sandlot 10 , celebrating special events like birthdays and graduation ceremonies , role - playing with other kids , tinkering with , or developing server infrastructure , and so on . 3 . 3 Methodological Approach 3 . 3 . 1 Data Collection . Drawing from the initial study sample of 60 in - the - wild multiplayer servers , we collected the published rules ( N = 1920 ) from each server between March 2020 and February 2021 in the form of text excerpts and noted the server URL links , names , and other available information ( e . g . , source of the server ) . Using a copy of the master dataset , we organized the raw data into two different streams – i ) Rules data : comprised all available server rules along with corresponding server names and their unique web addresses ( URLs ) ; and ii ) Other metadata : included all other metadata with links to the server rules pages and the corresponding server names and server URLs to prepare the dataset for analysis . We also collected 12 rules from the platform page , which the publisher refers to as Code of Conduct or community standards for all users of Minecraft . The platform includes rules - like statements under their terms of service page , which are not included in this dataset because those statements correspond to end user license agreements ( EULA ) . In preparing the final dataset for analysis , the first author began with the second stream of metadata to scan for any anomalies and to better understand the components of the dataset . The latter is a strongly recommended practice in qualitative research where the researcher develops a fluency or familiarity with the data to engage with it before even coding ( e . g . , Swanson & Holton 2005 ; Bailey 2007 ; Cresswell 2013 ) . Bailey ( 2007 ) . In this paper , we report on a set of select themes from a subset of 19 kid - friendly servers and 475 server rules . Our unit of analysis matches the way that rules were published on server websites - resulting in rules that were either 1 - 2 sentences or in some cases , longer paragraphs ( with examples , sub - rules and so on ) . As part of the data cleanup process , we removed 61 statements that were not rules or complete meaningful statements from the copy of the dataset such as “ About Player shop plots ” : “ Spawn Protection ” , and “ Maturity ” . 3 . 3 . 2 Data Analysis . We applied an inductive - deductive grounded theory approach for analyzing 1932 server rules ( 1920 server rules and 12 publisher - defined rules ) and the metadata for the 60 servers . As Swanson & Holton ( p . 238 , [ 123 ] ) explain , in the process of inductively generating codes and themes and then verifying it against the dataset , inductive and deductive techniques are invoked . Through an iterative process , both authors inductively generated eight axial codes for types of rules and seven codes for attributes of rules based on a deductive process to finally produce a taxonomy ( Appendix A ) that may be useful for understanding server rules and features of servers reflected in those rules . For the scope of this paper , we report on themes applicable to the subset of 475 server rules in 19 kid - friendly servers ( 475 server rules ) and briefly discuss differences with server rules on the other servers ( i . e . , that do not self - describe as kid - friendly ) and that of the platform . As a post - hoc step during the write up of the study findings , we contrasted the ratings 10 https : / / www . sandlotminecraft . com / 222 : 8 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . within the ESRB ( Entertainment Software Rating Board 11 ) and developed the final names for the server genres . Consequently , the kid - friendly genre is unique ( i . e . , not mapped to the ESRB rating system ) but the “ everyone ” and “ mature ” server categories correspond to the same categories in the ESRB rating system . For the initial few iterations of coding the data , the first author used a software application ( MAXQDA ) for coding and moved on to secure spreadsheets to carry out the remaining analysis . This was more of an arbitrary choice but allowed us to easily maintain and track iterations of the coding process . The first author presented the codes and themes regularly in research lab meetings with peers and with the second author to debrief findings and incorporate feedback in the analysis process . Such debriefing with peers and experts is a strongly recommended practice for ensuring that the researcher remains open to other possible interpretations and as an audit mechanism [ 6 , 123 ] . We also applied quantitative techniques including frequency distribution like Fielser et al . ’ s approach ( Table 2 , p . 77 [ 45 ] ) , plotting graphs in R to test the assumptions for parametric data ; and running non - parametric tests as a way to explore other ways to triangulate the qualitative findings . We include the frequency distribution table in the next section to highlight similarities within kid - friendly servers and differences across other kinds of servers ( e . g . , large network servers and competitive servers like Hypixel , Mineplex , etc . ) . 3 . 3 . 3 Ethics of Study . Our dataset draws from data published on the Minecraft platform website and 60 Minecraft servers listed online in the public internet domain . Server rules for three servers are listed on their corresponding Discord servers , to which the first author gained access to through an invitation link by joining the server . Server rules for the remaining 58 servers are publicly accessible on their corresponding websites . This work was approved by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) at the University of California , Irvine . Engaging with data available freely on the internet ( i . e . , a public domain ) poses sensitive and serious implications for individuals or entities being researched and the researcher [ 30 , 131 ] . As Convery and Cox explain in their insightful review , and Whiteman addresses some of these issues , although the internet is perceived to be a public space that is exempt from informed consent procedures , it does not relieve researchers who must consider the potential risks and harm that may compromise the rights of people who produce content online . Until a broader consensus or practice can be developed , Convery and Cox suggest a framework [ 30 ] for considering before commencing such research , which we address in Appendix B . 4 FINDINGS Our preliminary analysis showed that 35 out of the 60 servers used server - specific categories to publish their server rules , a useful rubric that surfaced high level differences among the servers . For example , servers that self - describe as “ mature ” have a greater proportion of rules about the norms of gameplay on the server ( e . g . , build rules , cheat rules , client mods and hacks , creative world rules , etc . ) . Or the patterns varied by the length of server rules . For example , Blocklandia 12 and Autcraft 13 that self - describe as kid - friendly group their rules by such codes while Addstar 14 , another kid - friendly server has a shorter consolidated set of rules . Yet through the lens of these categories alone , rules appear to be similar across all servers regardless of how they self - describe ( e . g . , kid - friendly , 11 https : / / www . esrb . org / ratings - guide / 12 https : / / www . blocklandia . com / 13 autcraft . com / 14 addstar . com . au / Beyond Just Rules 222 : 9 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . family - friendly , mature , competitive , etc . ) . They have do - and - don ’ t statements applicable in - game ( e . g . , don ’ t grief , don ’ t build or claim someone else ’ s land ) or in text - chat ( e . g . , don ’ t spam , all chat must be in English only , etc . ) and so on . While these pre - existing categories informed our coding process , they were not sufficient to help answer the questions posed by this work . A deeper analysis reveals that rules within and across servers can be organized as rulesets or types of rules based on how they are phrased and the kinds of information they include ( Appendix A ) . In the following , we report on three main themes based on an analysis of rulesets ( 475 rules coded based on their types and attributes per the coding schema in Appendix A ) across 19 kid - friendly servers . We use examples to contrast any difference and exemplify consistent patterns that we found in the dataset . 4 . 1 Articulating Community Values & Mission Statements Our analysis reveals that server rules are used to signal values ( e . g . , a friendly and inclusive community ) and mission statements about the server and play community writ large . Mission statements provide an overview about the server ; what players can expect from the server or what the server staff aim to offer . They may be published on the server ’ s landing page but are usually also included at the start of the server rules . If we consider servers to be organizations , the mission statements include information about who the staff or moderators are on the servers ( e . g . , former educators , parents who co - play with youth ) . In this sense , rules can be considered as metadata that signal important information for parents ( e . g . , OhanaCraft 15 as a server that does not tolerate bullying or trolling behaviors ; KidClub 16 and Indiesquish 17 are servers where staff work with parents to understand youth needs ) . Kid - friendly server rules reveal values and goals of kid - friendly servers , similar to the mission statements . In servers that do not have mission statements such as S25 , S37 , and S42 , rules are even more salient as markers of kid - / family - friendliness . In making rules explicit and clear , some of the kid - friendly servers are consistent with what Ringland ( 2018 ) observed on Autcraft . Some kid - friendly servers ( S2 , S23 , S39 , for example ) have much shorter and fewer rules but the majority of rules in this genre are more elaborate . For example , Indiesquish and The Sandlot servers explicitly mention that their staff ( i . e . , moderators and administrators ) are present to help young players and are available for addressing concerns that parents of youth on their servers might have . Rules in kid - friendly servers also reveal background information about who the staff and players are . For example , staff may include parents and former educators ( e . g . , The Sandlot server ) or adult gamers who volunteer as administrators on the server ( e . g . , Indiesquish ) . Similarly , players may include neurodivergent youth , children and families , or people from the LGBTQ community ( e . g . , Indiesquish , The Sandlot ) . The two quotes below from Indiesquish and The Sandlot servers ’ homepages exemplify how the metadata reveals nuances about the mission of the server . “ We work closely with our players to ensure everyone has a relaxing , fun experience , and will happily make arrangements with parents to minimize the impacts of change for example , when we need to change server maps ) on our autistic miners ” – mission statement from Indiesquish ’ home page . “ The Sandlot aims to provide a family - friendly environment for younger players , free from swearing , abusive language , and mature content that is often found on many Minecraft servers ( and the internet in general ) . ” - mission statement on The Sandlot ’ s main and “ About Us ” web pages . The 15 ohanacraft . com / 16 https : / / connectedcamps . com / minecraft - kid - club 17 indiesquish . com / 222 : 10 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . metadata on the Noobscraft 18 server shows a list of their staff by roles on a separate page and a mission statement or overview of the server on the footer area throughout their website ( “ . . . is now a unique , completely grief free , family friendly Minecraft server for all to enjoy . We pride ourselves in offering a unique Minecraft server experience which is suitable for the whole family to play . ” ) . Indiesquish and The Sandlot servers include information about their safe - listing application process ( also known as “ whitelisting ” ) . Noobscraft omits this metadata , implying that any Minecraft user can play on their server . LucidDreams 19 has a forum post for its server rules within which the creator provides more nuanced information about the server goals and staff . “ We also aim in building a safe environment where parents are at ease knowing their child can play in peace , without fear of being bullied , argued with or griefed by . Our main aim is to also help establish friendship between other players - you can consider us as a family ! ” This metadata suggests that LucidDreams as a server may be aligned with servers like Indiesquish and The Sandlot for example even though it does not explicitly self - describe as kid - friendly . Mineplex , one of the larger player communities , states their goals as a preamble to their rules “ We want to offer everybody a safe environment where they can have fun , meet new people , share their opinions , and be respected on the network . The focus of our rules is to ensure a positive and accepting environments for all our users . ” All these five servers share one salient metadata – server rules . This appears to be a more consistent feature in nearly all moderated Minecraft servers . In other words , moderated servers without other metadata can still include rules . Some of these servers include multiple Minecraft servers within the same ecosystem , ( e . g . , OhanaCraft has three servers and Cubeville 20 has multiple servers within their respective server ecosystems ) . 4 . 2 Capacity for Scaffolding Learning in Youth Our findings suggest the following characteristics drawn from the rules data , applicable to the kid - friendly genre : • Playing and interacting with others socially is as important as , if not more than , playing Minecraft • Rules suggest that staff want to be seen as approachable and helpful ; rules mention the ways through which members can contact them within the given online server ecosystem • Next steps are not limited to consequences for breaking rules , they include information on how people can get help or contact server staff • When a reason for why a rule exists is provided , protecting kids or keeping kids safe online ranks as the top reason and maintaining a friendly environment for everyone is another frequent explanation The list of desired and undesired behaviors derived from rules in this genre relate more to ways of being in a shared community than ways of playing the game . For example , rules in the kid - friendly server genre emphasize on helpful actions to play , trade , and share resources with other players ; to be welcoming and friendly to everyone on the server . Overall , kid - friendly servers have roughly the same number of rulesets around etiquette for social play ( and general social interactions online ) and for Minecraft ( in - game specific ) suggesting an equal emphasis on social behaviors as much as playing Minecraft . Starting with the first category of kid - friendly servers , seven servers grouped as kid - friendly based on the rulesets match the self - descriptions of kid - friendly by the corresponding servers . These servers self - describe as kid - friendly 18 noobscraft . com / 19 luciddreams . enjin . com / 20 cubeville . org / Beyond Just Rules 222 : 11 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . and are also coded as kid - friendly based on characteristic patterns in their rulesets . One server that did not self - describe as kid - friendly along with 11 other servers that self - described as family - friendly are coded as kid - friendly based on the patterns in their rulesets . These servers explicitly address kids as their main audience in their rules although other server metadata may not mention it . The most salient difference is that the highest number of rules providing desired actions or outcomes ( positive social ) , consequences of inappropriate action , and an underlying rationale for why the rule exists , come from kid - friendly servers ( cf . , Table 1 ) . This is important because only 475 rules in the dataset come from kid - friendly ( 19 servers ) , whereas 707 rules are from 21 ” everyone ” category of servers and 738 rules are from 20 “ mature ” category of servers . In this sense , kid - friendly servers extend the rules defined by the platform . Interestingly , we noted that longest rule in one of the kid - friendly servers was 562 words , whereas the longest rule in the mature server genre was 303 ; maximum word count in the everyone server category was 319 . Rules in kid - friendly servers are long because they include more descriptions ( examples ) and / or explanation ( next steps , consequences , etc . ) . The striking resemblance across the kid - friendly servers is that they include nearly as many positive actions as desired outcomes as they do the negative actions within the server ecosystem , and their rules are not mere duplicates of each other . Fiesler et al . , [ 45 ] examined this aspect in subreddit rules but did not find evidence that subreddits were copying rules from a standard template . Through the examples illustrated in the findings , here too , the results show that rules in kid - friendly servers are phrased unique to a given server . At a cursory glance , these rules appear to be similar to those in servers that do not identify as kid - friendly . It is only through the taxonomy that the nuanced differences start to become apparent . This finding is salient because youth may not always have supportive parents who can guide their journey into Minecraft that are designed for youth . These server rules mention positive actions , consequences , and reasons explicitly albeit to varying degrees of detail suggest that rules on kid / family - friendly servers are created with an intent to encourage positive behaviors , not only constrain inappropriate behaviors . For example , “ Being mean to other players is not acceptable . Players come to Ohanacraft and are accepted for who they are and are treated as a friend ” in OhanaCraft suggests the server goals are to provide inclusive and friendly spaces for players , whoever they may be .

CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . 4 . 3 Articulating Practices of Community Moderators Our findings show that server staff or community moderators leverage server rules to describe their practice and invite players to reach out to them with any questions , suggestions , or issues related to the server and play experience . Server staff reveal that they author server rules either in the metadata or within the rules . For example , S37 that does not self - describe but was coded as kid - friendly based on rulesets , states the following along with their rules : “ We reserve the right to amend all of these rules as needed ! Thank you for taking the time to read this ! Please reach out to a staff member anytime if you have any more questions or would like some more clarification . ” Similarly , on S59 , a family - friendly server that closed , staff mention that their rules are authored by moderators . Another kid - / family - friendly server , S07 , invites players to contact staff if the chat plugin inaccurately flags content ( e . g . , “ It ’ s so strong that at times it filters things it shouldn ’ t filter . Having something you type filtered doesn ’ t mean you ’ re in trouble , it just means that you triggered our filter . If you ever have questions about the chat filter you are welcome to email us . . . ” ) . A limitation of this dataset is that we cannot ascertain whether or not youth participate in the creation of these rules . Five topic codes reveal aspects of governance – Player - Staff Ban Appeal , Player - Staff Interactions , Social Governance , Technological Governance , and Socio - Technical Governance . Of these , the largest number of rules that reveal aspects of governance comes from kid - / family friendly servers – 269 governance topics out of 475 total in kid - friendly ( 57 % ) ; 282 out of 707 total in the everyone server genre ( 40 % ) ; and 199 out of 738 in the “ mature ” category ( 27 % ) . The findings reveal that in kid - friendly servers , rules coded as a governance topic guide players on how to report any problems including non - compliant behaviors that are against the server rules . For example , OhanaCraft , coded as a kid - friendly server , includes three rules to guide players on how they might report misbehaviors : 1 ) Reporting behavior and rules violations . 2 ) Report any rules being broken to the staff immediately . Use / msg to any of the staff to report it . If no staff are online , you may use / report and a staff will get to it as soon as possible . 3 ) If you have a problem with a staff member , report it to a Paladin or Co - owner using / mail . Autcraft and Cubeville , also coded as kid - friendly , include similar rules on how players can contact moderators . These rules are phrased to convey players ’ rights in kid - / family - friendly servers like Autcraft , Cubeville , and OhanaCraft . For example , “ You have the right to report poor behavior and rules violations of any player or staff . ” ( OhanaCraft , a kid - friendly server ) . Similarly , S45 , coded as an “ everyone ” type of server specifies – “ Staff reserve the right to use their own discretion regardless of the any rules listed , if you think it is unfair , please let us know by directly messaging another staff member . Failure to abide by these rules may result in a mute or ban from the Discord and / or Server . If you witness another player breaking rules , report them to the staff . ” Although this second example centers around staff rights , it offers players a way to contact staff with any concerns . The analysis shows that such rules , characteristic of kid - friendly and “ everyone ” servers , inform players how they might actively voice any concerns about improper actions on the server including those by staff . As a point of contrast , the analysis shows that servers in the “ mature ” genre phrase their rules in terms of staff rights . For example , a rule on S50 . unspecified self - label and coded as “ mature ” category of servers , states , “ . . . Staff reserves the right to remove any player deemed unruly . staff reserves the right to perform ANY administrative action on offenders if deemed necessary . Staff claims no responsibility for any damages financial , emotional , or mental in nature . ” This quality is worth noting as rules in kid - friendly servers and “ everyone ” type of servers are expressed to inform players of their rights to report inappropriate action . While the evidence is inadequate to form a sound conclusion , the ways Beyond Just Rules 222 : 13 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . in which these rules are phrased suggest that kid - friendly and “ everyone ” genre of servers offer a feedback channel and invite players to use it on their respective servers . 4 . 4 Secondary Results : Meaningful Similarities and Differences Using a similar approach that Fiesler et al . [ 45 ] used to identify various types of rules on subreddits , we created a frequency distribution table ( Table 2 ) to meaningfully compare and contrast rulesets against the server types ( c . f . Table 1 ) . By this stage , servers were coded into categories based on their rulesets . These categories for rulesets ( e . g . , Social Play etiquette , Player ban appeals , Descriptive , Restrictive , etc . ) and the categories of the server types or genres ( kid - friendly , everyone , and mature ) were developed through continuous analysis in parallel . This frequency distribution is useful in two ways . First , it reveals the distribution of rules within each server genre according to the ruleset or types of rules and attributes ( Columns 4 - 9 , left to right ) . The analysis shows that restrictive ( i . e . , don ’ t ) rules , the mention of undesired behaviors , and descriptive rules ( with examples or explaining something ) are the top three rulesets in the kid - friendly genre . Similarly , the top three rulesets in the “ everyone ” genre correspond to restrictive , descriptive , and a close tie between Minecraft / in - game etiquette and prescriptive ( i . e . , do ) rule types . Whereas , the “ mature ” category favors descriptive , rules that mention antisocial or undesired behaviors , and restrictive rules as its top three rule - types . The second use for this frequency table is in contrasting the rulesets across the three server genres . The kid - friendly genre ranks highest in rulesets that mention desirable / permissible behaviors ( 227 out of 521 prosocial rules ) . Similarly , a majority of rules that mention a rationale / reason comes from the kid - friendly genre ( 109 out of 201 rulesets coded as rationale ) whereas only about 1 / 8th of such rules come from the “ mature ” server genre . 4 . 5 Summary of Findings Our findings reveal that community moderators have developed innovative ways to include organizational metadata ( mission statement , values , staff information ) as part of their server rules . They articulate strong positive social values through server rules for their youth audience , suggesting that community rules are a valuable tool to promote healthy social interactions within play communities . A systematic analysis of server rules also surfaces interesting design patterns in kid - friendly servers in that server rules can provide vital clues for players - including reasons for why a rule might exist or suggesting what players could do when a typical problem occurs on the server . Furthermore , server rules are authored by community moderators - who are players and caring adults ( as former / current educators , parents or caregivers ) themselves . To this end , server rules reflect their visions for young players – to curate playgrounds where YAs can play and learn with peers , near - peers , and other friendly adults within moderated spaces that keep YAs safe from online harm . From a developmental perspective , adolescence is a time for building healthy social relationships with peers and others within safe spaces . Taken together , our analysis suggests that server rules are an important design touchpoint for facilitating player experiences particularly for YAs ( i . e . , 7 - 14 years ) . We turn to discuss what our findings mean for supporting YA players in the next and final section of this paper in light of their developmental needs . 222 : 14 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No .

CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . 5 DISCUSSION 5 . 1 Rules as Tools to Explore Teachable Moments The attributes of providing an underlying rationale , explanations for any consequences , and instructions on how to give or get help correspond to a well - known concept in the learning sciences literature known as scaffolding . Simply put , the term scaffolding , adapted from Wood [ 133 ] , refers to an approach where an individual or an entity ( e . g . , a bot ) supports an individual carry on with their activities and is ready to intervene when the individual is unable to make further progress or needs more input to accomplish additional goals . Server rules in kid - friendly servers include these attributes . Given that moderators use rules to enforce social norms and determine next steps ( e . g . , consequences of repeatedly failing to follow a rule , sanctions , etc . ) , our findings point to the usefulness of server rules as potential scaffolding tools . Rather than banning the player immediately in the event of non - normative behavior , server rules in kid - friendly servers reveal an intent to invite players ( including YAs , or YAs with their parent / caregiver ) to enter a conversation with community moderators . This is a key differentiating aspect between server rules that enforce punitive outcomes if a player “ breaks a rule ” [ 119 ] . On a related note , HCI research suggests that norms should be made explicit and visible to members of a community , particularly to overcome the problems that online digital medium presents ( e . g . , trolling or harassing someone anonymously ; [ 79 ] ) . Grimes ’ view , however , is that rules may constrain the freedom in children to play and be creative [ 56 , 58 ] . Similarly , in a study of classroom rules , Boostrom [ 13 – 15 ] explains that too many explicit rules might limit the opportunities for educators and learners to teach and learn respectively . Just as game rules are designed to produce a variety of emergent player experiences [ 125 , 130 ] , server rules also must be designed to help players make informed choices . Server rules in kid - friendly servers do this currently by providing additional information such as rationale , consequences or what to expect , and prompts to suggest next steps . While more innovation is certainly possible and warranted , server rules have the potential to be used as scaffolds to guide YAs in social play . Rules and social norms may help youth develop critical thinking skills needed for making responsible decisions [ 8 , 13 , 15 ] . While more work is necessary to understand rules from the perspectives of youth , our study findings should be considered in light of the target audience that include parents and caregivers ( e . g . , S07 , S17 , S18 , S22 , S23 , S25 , S42 , and S59 ) . The emphasis on friendly and approachable server staff ( or moderators ) signals to parents and caregivers that children can safely enjoy playing Minecraft with other people on kid - friendly servers . The most striking finding is that rules in kid - friendly servers not only specify inappropriate actions , but also explicitly state appropriate actions in the form of positive social values such as being polite , helping to keep the community friendly and safe , and enjoying Minecraft with everyone . Furthermore , server rules reflect moderators ’ goals of keeping the server safe and appropriate for young children . Rules mention how youth might report concerns to staff or interpret the technological features such as chat filters , ( e . g . , “ It ’ s so strong that at times it filters things it shouldn ’ t filter . Having something you type filtered doesn ’ t mean you ’ re in trouble , it just means that you triggered our filter . If you ever have questions . . . you are welcome to email us ” – S07 , a kid - friendly server ) . On a subset of kid - friendly servers , rules also provide an underlying rationale ( e . g . , “Do not grief… because other players should be able to leave and come back later without their work being destroyed – Cubeville ) . Rules play an additional role in that they signal a set of values and beliefs on the servers to parents and caregivers . Rules present moderators as the primary point of contact for ensuring that youth are safe on the servers . In summary , our findings suggest that rules 222 : 16 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . in kid - friendly servers are tailored to provide specific support for youth and reveal insights into moderators ’ goals for the culture and climate of their servers . 5 . 2 Community Moderators as More Than Arbitrators Our analysis of server rules suggest that moderators in kid - friendly servers sponsor and legitimize youth interests . Server rules reveal that moderators rely on various social and technological mechanisms for moderating play on their kid - friendly servers . Rules also suggest that moderators recognize that youth on their servers belong to diverse age groups and tailor their approaches accordingly . The rules describe moderators ’ goals for working closely with younger adolescents and their parents to provide additional support in understanding the server rules . The findings suggest that moderators strive to provide opportunities for youth on their servers to cultivate friendships , creativity , leadership , and other prosocial behaviors . They moderate social interactions within their Minecraft server ecosystems , that include online discussion forums , in - game chats configured for various activities ( e . g . , chat for youth interested in roleplays , global chat for all players on the server , etc . ) , and extended play - spaces such as Discord . They also moderate emergent play behaviors on the Minecraft servers . Although moderators play with youth on their servers when they can , they encourage youth to follow their interests whether through creative youth - led play - acts or role - plays ; developing technical expertise in Minecraft ; or volunteering as youth moderators to build leadership and social skills ; and so on . By holding players accountable to server rules , moderators function as “ warm demanders ” [ 11 , 12 ] . The phrase “ warm demanders ” [ 77 ] refers to those people like teachers , facilitators , coaches , who care for youth while at the same time challenging the latter to better themselves . Through an understanding of mission statements , goals , and moderation practices in server rules , our study findings strongly suggest that community moderators in kid - friendly servers do more than arbitrate conflict or enforce norms in the traditional sense ( i . e . , ban a player or mete out some punishment retrospectively when a player breaks a rule ) . Rather , our analysis of rules reveals that kid - friendly server moderators play with YAs ( as expert players who enjoy playing Minecraft themselves ) ; plan fun and engaging activities on the server for YAs ; and invite YAs to contribute to the community by reaching out to the moderators . In this sense , moderators are valuable and important stakeholders in play communities - tasked with not only arbitrating play experiences , but also designing play experiences and the community culture . This finding is consistent with prior work [ 24 ] . Understanding server rules forms an important step towards advancing our knowledge about play - based moderation . Our paper builds on prior work [ 112 , 119 , 124 ] and contributes a nuanced understanding of how server rules can be used to influence player behavior and experiences at the individual and community levels . Moderators can accomplish the design of their server spaces because the platform enables them to author their server rules ; as rightful experts in matters of the game and YAs ( as parents , teachers , or caregivers ) . Future work might consider how moderators in such play communities may be officially recognized by platforms as chosen representatives or liaisons between game developers and players . Server rules reveal governance mechanisms that we might imagine being mobilized within digital playgrounds created for youth , particularly YAs . More broadly , this aspect of community moderators may be relevant for training moderations within gaming communities in general . Research shows that the culture and climate of gaming communities can discriminate and exclude players or increase stigma for vulnerable groups ( e . g . , because of some aspect of their identity or social status ; [ 116 ] ) . Based on our analysis of server rules , we offer an educated guess that server rules are viable spaces space for signaling characteristics of community moderators ( e . g . , being friendly and approachable ; inviting players to report issues or ask questions ; playing with the community ) to the community . Beyond Just Rules 222 : 17 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . 5 . 3 Developmental Perspectives : Leveraging Server Rules to Shape Player Experiences Adolescence is a vulnerable period for developing one ’ s social brain and research shows that the quality of social experiences , positive or negative , shape brain development [ 36 , 37 , 66 ] . Young adolescents or YAs have a particularly high proclivity for social learning with peers and near - peers [ 10 , 34 , 37 , 69 ] . They seek opportunities for exploring their identity and taking risks as they learn to navigate their social world [ 37 ] . Studies show that sandbox style ( i . e . , open virtual worlds ) games like Minecraft serve as online proxies for real world playgrounds , operating as interest - driven ( i . e . , “ intrinsically motivated ” ) spaces that can support healthy social development in YAs [ 72 , 105 , 111 , 112 , 119 , 124 ] . Such positive outcomes through online games are not automatic – rather made possible through attending to social and technological mechanisms that can be designed to shape positive player experiences [ 124 ] . Our work demonstrates that integrating developmental perspectives is necessary to deeply understand the ways in which server rules might be harnessed to create more positive social experiences for YAs . Our findings suggest that server rules can be a viable tool for embedding support for social learning in YAs . We note that the characteristics of kid - friendly server rules in theory support the developmental perspectives of YAs . For example , YAs are motivated to seek opportunities to learn how they might navigate the social world [ 34 , 134 ] . The findings show that kid - friendly server rules provide rich descriptive examples and instructions for YAs to learn how to play with others on the server . Similarly , the evidence base shows that YAs are eager to contribute and earn social status [ 37 ] . Our analysis shows how moderators invite kids to ask questions or offer suggestions about their play experiences on the server . Taking these into account , our work suggests that server rules may be viable artefacts that youth could contribute to and perhaps even lead the design of their online playgrounds . We note that our work reveals insights into the potential of server rules , but more work is needed to understand how moderators enforce these rules within their servers . Additionally , YAs are beginning to explore their identity in relation to themselves and others in their social groups [ 35 ] . Viewing rules as more fluid ( i . e . , something that can be revised and ongoing ) may help engage YAs in connecting their social play experiences with the community values to promote belongingness . We identified three main developmental perspectives that are relevant to our study findings – scaffolding social learning ; inviting youth as active community participants ; and fostering social values ( that are applicable outside virtual worlds in online and offline spaces ) . Based on this analysis , we offer a set of guiding questions that may help shape future work in factoring the developmental needs of YAs when designing server rules ( Table 3 ) . Future work may reveal additional developmental perspectives and extend this work . 5 . 4 Strengths & Limitations Understanding server rules is valuable as they reveal how servers position themselves within the socio - cultural contexts of gaming in Minecraft . As Bourgonjon et al . [ 17 , 18 ] explain , such rhetorics can help us understand socially constructed meanings . “ When studying the impact of video games , we therefore believe it is meaningful to map out the foundations of the debate by exploring the perspectives of players . ” ( p . 1733 [ 19 ] ) . This perspective is relevant for the present study which seeks to understand the potential role of server rules in curating play experiences within kid - friendly Minecraft servers . 222 : 18 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . Table 3 . Towards a Model of Server Rules that take into account developmental perspectives Governance mechanism Developmental Perspectives to be considered Guiding Questions Server Rules : a set of do - and - do - not statements that inform players about permitted and prohibited actions , potential consequences , and underlying rationale within the server ecosystem . Consider rules as a tool to support and scaffold learning Do rules include examples of prosocial behaviors ? Do server rules reflect underlying rationale ? Do rules offer information on what next steps are ? Do rules tell players how to reach moderators ? Invite youth into the rule design process Are rules written to be understood by youth ? Are youth involved in the ongoing process of writing and rewriting server rules ? Consider rules as a space to articulate community values Are server values visible in the rules ? The same quality of our study ’ s strength contributes to its limitations . By design , the dataset is insufficient to explain the underlying rationale of why rules and metadata are presented in a certain manner . At this point , we can only assert our findings in relation to the described practices reflected in the server rules . Yet , the results of this study are interesting as it motivates the need to understand more ( e . g . , kids ’ perspectives on rules and how they are being enforced ) which we suggest as future work . We also rely on other research methods ( interviews , observational data ) to understand the lived experiences of community moderators in kid - friendly servers , beyond the scope of our research questions in this paper . 5 . 5 Future Work This work matters even more now than ever before for three main reasons . First , emerging evidence around the mediating role those online digital environments play in the social and learning experiences of youth [ 51 , 92 ] . Critically , evidence - based research has shown that changes in the body and brain during early adolescence are shaped by the quality of relationships and social interactions during this period [ 34 , 37 , 65 , 94 ] . But recent studies show that the quality of social interactions can shape brain development in adolescents [ 37 , 65 ] . Prior research shows that , with adequate support , virtual world games like Minecraft help youth develop social connections , technical expertise , and socio - emotional competencies [ 8 , 16 , 105 , 112 , 124 ] . With online games like Minecraft becoming an intrinsic feature of social life for many present - day youth , especially young adolescents [ 55 , 116 ] , the pressing question is how such play - based spaces might be developmentally more responsive to youth [ 8 , 32 , 40 , 43 , 76 ] . Second , despite research that highlights the promise of harnessing virtual world games for youth development , alarmist attitudes towards gaming as negative phenomena persist in popular discourse and in the literature ( e . g . , games are aggressive or addictive ; [ 2 , 22 , 27 , 50 , 74 , 80 ] . These latter perspectives do not help us make sense of the ever - increasing popularity of Minecraft among youth . In the wake of the COVID - 19 pandemic , online games like Minecraft were one of the limited available ways through which youth could find social connections [ 4 , 7 , 31 ] . However , ongoing initiatives at the research - practice and policy levels are striving to restore the rights of youth ( Digital 5Rights 21 , Raising Good Gamers 22 , Headstream 23 ; 21 5rightsfoundation . com / 22 raisinggoodgamers . com / 23 https : / / www . headstreaminnovation . com / Beyond Just Rules 222 : 19 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . FairPlay Alliance 24 ) and advocate for a better understanding of features that can provide safe , developmentally appropriate , and equitable digital playgrounds for youth . Third , research in HCI on socio - technical governance approaches in online communities has been largely focused on content moderation [ 26 , 59 , 117 ] and automated approaches for mitigating harm and disruptive behaviors [ 54 , 82 ] . Moderation in multiplayer games like Minecraft necessitate socio - technical mechanisms that need to address the emergent nature of social interactions inherent in play - based contexts that go beyond content moderation . A better understanding of server rules and described practices in kid - friendly Minecraft servers informs possible approaches for developing trust and supporting youth in online playgrounds that may also apply in other similar contexts . The current research was motivated in part , by a need to understand the extent to which online social play communities like those instantiated by kid - friendly Minecraft servers , considered the developmental needs of young adolescents . 6 CONCLUSIONS In this paper , we analyzed key characteristics of server rules in a subset of kid - friendly Minecraft servers and found that community moderators harness server rules to nurture values at the individual and community levels . They also use tools to signal salient aspects about their server and practices around server rules to various stakeholders including – reassuring parents and caregivers about the safety of their children ; informing youth players on possible next steps for issues they may face on the server ; and presenting themselves as friendly and approachable staff who are there to facilitate inclusive and fair play experiences for the entire community on their servers . Our findings in this paper draw from a broader study on the social and technological features of gaming servers for youth in relation to their developmental needs . This work offers important considerations for future work on innovating social play - based experiences in online communities for youth . Through this work , we also contribute a taxonomy for server rules and integrate insights from the allied field of developmental science that may be valuable for advancing our understanding of youth audiences in online play communities .

Coding Schema generated based on thematic coding approach [ 20 ] Ruleset code ( type of rule ) Description of Code . The first two codes and last 3 attributes draw from [ 45 , 71 ] Salient Examples Social Play Etiquette Rules of this type describe how one is expected to play and interact with other people on the server , also applied to how one should generally behave on the server . Rules of this type are applicable universally ( within and outside the gameplay ) ( Tekinbaş e t al . , 2021 ) “ We ask our players to “ be a good nugget ” . . treat others as friends and encourage positive behavior . Don ’ t take away from another ’ s ability to express themselves through fair play . ” ( S01 ) “ Don ’ t post someone ’ s personal information without permission . ” ( S45 ) Minecraft / in - game etiquette How one is expected to play Minecraft with other people on the server . Rules of this type are applicable within the gameplay specific to Minecraft ( Tekinbaş et al . , 2021 ) “ Be respectful to all players , their belongings , and their builds . Grieving and stealing will be dealt with accordingly . ” ( S49 ) “ No PvP unless both parties consent ” ( S32 and S55 ) Player Safety & Account Related to what every individual is expected to do with respect to their personal information and account on the server , rules on how to protect oneself within the server ecosystem “ Be safe . Do not share or ask for any personal information about you or real life : Real names ( first name is OK ) …” ( S51 ) “ Sharing account information in chat or private messaging is not allowed . ” ( S03 ) Player - ban appeals Conveying what players may expect from various staff / what staff do on the server ( e . g . , admins , moderators , helpers , etc . ) “ You can appeal any ban on the forums , whether guilty or not . Be polite , apologize when appropriate and you might be allowed back on our server . ” ( S15 ) “ No ban evasion If you believe you ’ ve been unjustly banned , you can appeal on the forums ” ( S13 ) Player - Staff interactions Rules that mention how staff and players may contact each other , when players may contact staff and how they might do so within the given server ecosystem “ Please talk to a member of staff if another player is bullying , trolling , or using hate speech towards you . You or staff may request a private support chat room on discord to further discuss and investigate incidents . ” ( S08 ) “ Persistent hassling of Staff members for anything is not allowed . This includes world - editing , protections , . . . among other things . ” ( S18 ) 222 : 26 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . Social Governance Explicit rules about staff managing the server ; Conveying what players may expect from various staff , what staff do on the server ( e . g . , admins , moderators , helpers , etc . ) “ The staff is here to help . We volunteer ourselves to this community out of love and a desire to see it succeed . If you have issues with any of us , please contact that member ’ s respective Management or Administrator . ” ( S24 ) “ Staff are expected to show only the highest possible level of maturity , but between general members we allow a more relaxed atmosphere ” ( S27 ) Tech governance Related to what players may expect from technological controls on the server ; or conveying the purpose of tech controls used for moderation ( e . g . , chat filters , software to detect cheating , etc . ) “ No swearing or trying to bypass the filter . ” ( Stated slightly differently S4 , S18 , S53 ) Socio - tech governance Rules that convey how staff use technological controls to manage the server , activities on the server . The difference between tech governance and socio - tech governance is that the latter includes some aspect that is handled by server staff and the use of tech is often implied ( e . g . , banned immediately ) “ We reserve the right to change our rules at any time , the moderation team may issue bans or mutes at their own discretion . ” ( S14 ) “ Harsh swear words will get you banned immediately . Admins reserve the right to decide what is considered harsh . ” ( S22 ) Rules Attribute ( applies to all rules regardless of code ) Definition of Attribute Salient Examples Desired / permissible ( prosocial ) Rules that mention desired outcomes for the group / community for a given server “ Respect others / be Respectful to all ” ( e . g . , S01 , S02 , S07 , S09 , S12 , S23 , S34 , S38 ) An example of permissible behavior in one server but prohibited in many others is : “ Swearing is allowed , but offensive remarks and spam are discouraged . ” ( S49 ) Undesired / disallowed ( asocial ) Rules that mention undesired behaviors , considered as breaking rules , or behaviors that will be punished “ No cursing or profanity . ” ( S54 ) “ Do not use client - side mods , a hacked client , or circumvent server plugins in a way that gives an unfair advantage . ” ( S43 ) Next steps ( consequences / help ) Rules that mention next steps in a situation that can correspond to a . consequences or “ punishments ” for breaking rules ; or b . guidelines or instructions on how to proceed “ . . . Not following the rules may result in a kick , mute , jail , temporary ban , permanent ban , or permanent IP ban . . . With exceptions , staff will always warn players before resorting to these punishments . ” ( S37 ) “ . . . Any skins that can cause offence or upset will be monitored by admins and you will be asked to change them . ” ( S17 ) Beyond Just Rules 222 : 27 PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No . CHI PLAY , Article 222 , Publication date : October 2022 . Rationale Rules that provide a reasoning or explanation for why the rule exists or a perspective from server staff “ . . . wearing inappropriate or grown - up Minecraft skins such as those depicting Herobrine , nudity , gore , or are scary to young children . ” ( S07 ) “Do not grief… When a player builds something , they should be able to leave and come back later without their work being destroyed . ” ( S15 ) Descriptive Rules that explain or describe something or provide examples of something ( Note : some rules include elaborate examples even though the main rule may be restrictive & / prescriptive ) “ Spam includes , but is not limited to , repeating sentences and / or splitting short sentences into several lines unnecessarily . Very occasional use of CAPS is fine ( for example , in using abbreviations like LOL or slipping the OCCASIONAL word into a sentence ) , but repeated and large - scale use of CAPS is not . . . . This is to ensure that server chat , which can get very busy at times , is kept as clean and readable as possible . ” ( S22 ) The above code of Rationale provided also applies in this example Prescriptive ( e . g . , do , can , may ) Rules written as “ Do something ” ( Fiesler et al . 2018 ) “ Avoid spam in the server chat ( max . 4 lines at a time ) . ” ( S32 ) “ Please only use English in public chats . We ’ re unable to moderate other languages . . . you will be asked to take it to a private channel . ” ( S36 ) Restrictive ( e . g . , don ’ t know , cannot ) Rules written as “ Don ’ t do something…” , “ No . . . ” , “ . . . not allowed ” ( Fiesler et al . 2018 ) “ Do not bully anyone in the server ” ( S19 ) “ No excessive swearing , spamming or overusing caps , or bypassing the censor ” ( S41 ) 222 : 28 Krithika Jagannath & Katie Salen PACM on Human - Computer Interaction , Vol . 6 , No .

Concepts by Convery and Cox [ 30 ] Concept Considerations Summary [ 29 ] Chosen Approach in this study Intrusiveness Whether research includes passive or active participation ; deception / honesty about the researcher ’ s role This study takes on a passive analysis to analyze texts ( i . e . , not involved in the production ) and there was no deception involved . Public / Private whether or not the community is closed for members , checking if participants believe their community is private We did not include servers whose rules and basic metadata was not available without registering . Although the first author registered where possible , we did not collect private data ( e . g . , discussion forums ) for this study . Vulnerability How vulnerable the community is ( e . g . , children , victims of abuse ) Servers that are kid - friendly include vulnerable populations and potentially other groups . Through the analysis of metadata , we excluded any content from discussion forums from this study Potential Harm Whether the research could cause harm to individuals or the community , or provoke emotional reactions As stated at the start of Section 3 . 1 , this research aims to characterize the server genres . We recognize that servers may not necessarily agree with the labels . We limit my analysis to what is reflected in the metadata . Our hope is that the characterization is useful for developing interventions and designs that can benefit kid - friendly servers ( and potentially other kinds of servers ) Confidentiality Protecting the anonymity of participants ) Study uses metadata at the server level ( See item # 2 in this table ) Intellectual Property Rights Whether permission is required to use the materials online To the best of our knowledge , we did not come across such clauses . Informed Consent The above factors determined if informed consent is needed or not The IRB determination for the Study noted our intent to reveal the ( first author ’ s ) researcher positionality and research goals and determined that informed consent is not needed Received : February 2022 , Revised : June 2022 , Accepted : July 2022 .
