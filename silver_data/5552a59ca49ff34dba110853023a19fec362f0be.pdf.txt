The postsynaptic part of excitatory synapses re - 3 sides in dendritic spines , which are small protrusions on the dendrites . One of the key features of 4 synaptic plasticity is its correlation with the size of these spines . A long - lasting synaptic strength 5 increase ( long - term potentiation , LTP ) is only possible through the reconfiguration of the actin 6 spine cytoskeleton . Here , we develop an experimentally - informed three - dimensional computational 7 model in a moving boundary framework to investigate this reconfiguration . Our model describes 8 the reactions between actin and actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) leading to the cytoskeleton remod - 9 eling and their effect on the spine membrane shape to examine the spine enlargement upon LTP . 10 Moreover , we find that the incorporation of perisynaptic elements enhances spine enlargement upon 11 LTP , exhibiting the importance of accounting for these elements when studying structural LTP . 12 Our model shows adaptation to repeated stimuli resulting from the interactions between spine 13 proteins and mechanical forces . 14 Significance Statement 15 Dendritic spines are small protrusions that receive stimulation from presynaptic neurons . Upon 16 stimulation , the dendritic spines change their size , an important feature of synaptic plasticity . 17 This change is achieved by modifications to the actin cytoskeleton and mediated by many actin - 18 binding proteins . To investigate the fundamental mechanics of spine expansion , we developed a 19 3D biophysical model that accounts for the dynamics of cytoskeleton - membrane interactions . Our 20 simulations predict that spine expansion due to actin remodeling can be enhanced by including 21 the interaction with perisynaptic elements that affect the spine’s mechanical properties . We also 22 1 found that mechanical properties can control spine expansion after repeated stimuli , which ensures 23 physiological size . Thus , we predict that spine growth is regulated by its mechanical properties . 24 1 Introduction 25 Dendritic spines are small protrusions from dendrites that form the postsynaptic part of a vast 26 majority of excitatory synapses ( Harris 2020 ; Nakahata and Yasuda 2018 ; Okabe 2020 ) . In response 27 to glutamate signals released by stimulated presynaptic neurons , spines undergo both biochemical 28 and morphological changes that can be long - lasting ( Matsuzaki et al . 2004 ; Okamoto et al . 2004 ; 29 Kasai et al . 2010 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Such changes have been long hypothesized as the biological mechanisms 30 underlying memory storage in the brain ( Yuste and Bonhoeffer 2001 ) . One of the most - studied 31 long - lasting changes is long - term potentiation ( LTP ) . 32 LTP induction alters the dendritic spine morphology . It has been shown that spines increase 33 their volume dramatically , by up to 390 % , after stimulation ( Tønnesen et al . 2014 ; Chang et al . 34 2017 ) . This increase is associated with an increase in AMPAR - mediated currents and depends on 35 NMDAR activation and actin polymerization ( Matsuzaki et al . 2004 ) . Actin is highly concentrated 36 in dendritic spines ( Matus et al . 1982 ) and plays a key role in LTP ( Cingolani and Goda 2008 ; 37 Okabe 2020 ) . Around 95 % of F - actin in the spine undergoes rapid treadmilling ( time scale ∼ 40 s ) , 38 generating an expansive force caused by actin polymerization ( Honkura et al . 2008 ) . Moreover , the 39 equilibrium between actin monomers ( G - actin ) and F - actin is affected by stimulation ( Okamoto 40 et al . 2004 ) , suggesting that structural reconfiguration of actin is necessary for spine enlargement . 41 Actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) aid the reconfiguration of the cytoskeleton by promoting G - 42 actin polymerization , F - actin depolymerization , and capping the F - actin ends , which prevents 43 their polymerization and depolymerization ( Pollard and Borisy 2003 ) . Experiments have shown 44 that ABPs are necessary for LTP ( Cingolani and Goda 2008 ; Fortin , Srivastava , and Soderling 45 2012 ) . To achieve the transient size increase seen during the first 4 - 7 minutes of LTP ( Tønnesen 46 et al . 2014 ; Chang et al . 2017 ) translocation of ABPs into the spine is necessary ( Bosch et al . 47 2014 ) , in addition to the Arp2 / 3 and cofilin activation due to Ca 2 + influx ( Rangamani , Levy , et al . 48 2016 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . After three hours , the spine settles to a size that is 40 % larger than that prior 49 to LTP induction ( Tønnesen et al . 2014 ; Chang et al . 2017 ) . Hence , the reconfiguration of the 50 2 actin cytoskeleton of dendritic spines , and thus , structural plasticity is possible by an orchestrated 51 interplay between actin and ABPs triggered by different signaling pathways ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) . 52 Besides changes in size promoted by the cytoskeleton reconfiguration , spines experience further 53 mechanical modifications upon LTP . For example , mechanical coupling of the actin filaments with 54 the extracellular environment through molecular clutches is necessary to push the membrane for - 55 ward ( Kastian et al . 2021 ) . Degradation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) by proteases promotes 56 structural and functional LTP ( Wang et al . 2008 ) . The elastic storage modulus and viscous loss 57 modulus of the spine increase , which facilitates its mechanical stabilization due to the stiffening of 58 the internal structure ( Smith et al . 2007 ) . Therefore , both biochemical reactions and mechanical 59 force generation are required for structural LTP ( sLTP ) . 60 In this work , we seek to answer the following questions : Can a minimal model of actin - membrane 61 interactions capture the dynamics of spine changes during sLTP ? How spine enlargement upon LTP 62 can be enhanced by the mechanical changes induced through the interaction with other perisynaptic 63 elements ? And finally , how do repeated stimuli affect sLTP ? To answer these questions , we develop 64 a 3D computational model using a system of partial differential equations with moving boundaries 65 to incorporate the spatio - temporal dynamics of actin and ABPs in the expanding dendritic spines . 66 We systematically investigate the contribution of ABPs and mechanics to sLTP under different 67 conditions that mimic the alteration of spine properties . Our results predict that actin interaction 68 with ABPs is suﬀicient to capture the spine growth during sLTP and that further increase can 69 be obtained when including the interaction with other perisynaptic elements . Moreover , the spine 70 enlargement capacity diminished with repeated stimuli , hinting at a homeostatic mechanism related 71 to its mechanical properties . 72 2 Materials and Methods 73 We develop a mathematical model in which F - actin dynamics in the dendritic spine are affected 74 by Arp2 / 3 and cofilin . As in cell motility models ( Mogilner and Edelstein - Keshet 2002 ; Tania , 75 Prosk , et al . 2011 ; Tania , Condeelis , and Edelstein - Keshet 2013 ) , we assume that these ABPs are 76 suﬀicient to promote membrane protrusion because their interaction with F - actin increases the force 77 generated by actin polymerization which helps to overcome the membrane resistance ( Xiong et al . 78 3 2010 ; Mogilner and Oster 1996 ) . Thus , we expect that the spine enlargement seen shortly after LTP 79 induction will be driven by the reconfiguration of the cytoskeleton , similar to the reconfiguration 80 needed for cell motility , and that other proteins minimally affect spine expansion . In the model , 81 actin , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin are free to diffuse in the spine volume . Upon LTP , there is an influx of 82 these proteins into the spine that represents the translocation of ABPs . Note that the ABPs chosen 83 in our model are required for synaptic function . For example , conditional mutagenesis of Arp2 / 3 , 84 which promotes actin branching ( Pollard and Borisy 2003 ; Pollard , Blanchoin , and Mullins 2000 ) , 85 hinders spine enlargement upon LTP and is implicated in psychiatric disorders ( Kim , Racz , et al . 86 2013 ) . Loss of cofilin impairs learning ( Rust et al . 2010 ) . Cofilin is an ABP whose function depends 87 on its relative concentration with actin ; it severs F - actin at low concentrations but promotes actin 88 nucleation at high concentrations ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard 2006 ) . 89 2 . 1 Governing equations 90 Based on the assumptions described above , we formulate a system of partial differential equations 91 ( PDEs ) that describe the spatio - temporal dynamics of F - actin with uncapped ( + ) ends ( or barbed 92 ends ) , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin . Note that barbed ends polymerize G - actin , which generates an expand - 93 ing force . Moreover , the action of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin , in addition to the actin influx upon LTP 94 induction , increase the number of barbed ends in the spine . Thus , in our model , the increment of 95 barbed ends during stimulation allows us to approximate the dynamics of barbed ends with PDEs 96 instead of considering single filaments . This system is coupled with the spine membrane dynamics , 97 as described in ( Doubrovinski and Kruse 2011 ) . To examine the dendritic spine size and shape 98 changes , we implement a moving boundary framework . The forces generated by actin polymer - 99 ization F actin , the membrane F mem , and drag F drag dictate the displacement of the membrane Γ , 100 which enclose the spine to an evolving domain Ω , hence Γ = ∂ Ω . 101 In the absence of inertia , the force balance becomes 102 F actin + F mem + F drag = 0 . ( 1 ) Note that vectors are in bold font . As in ( Gonçalves and Garcia - Aznar 2021 ) , we describe the 103 interactions between the spine and the extracellular environment through F drag , a dissipative force 104 4 that can represent the contributions of fluid drag and extracellular matrix adhesion . The drag force 105 is given by 106 F drag = − ω v p = − ω dΓ d t , ( 2 ) where ω represents an effective drag coeﬀicient and v p is the protrusion velocity , i . e . , the displace - 107 ment of the membrane over time . Thus , the membrane evolves according to 108 dΓ d t = 1 ω ( F mem + F actin ) , ( 3 ) where F actin is the force generated by the polymerization of F - actin near the dendritic spine mem - 109 brane that pushes the membrane forward ( Mogilner and Oster 1996 ; Lacayo et al . 2007 ; Honkura 110 et al . 2008 ) , given by 111 F actin = − ∂ E B ∂ Γ . ( 4 ) Following ( Doubrovinski and Kruse 2011 ) , the force applied to the membrane is dictated by the 112 total potential generated by the number of barbed ends per cubic volume B inside the spine 113 E B = Z Ω d r ψ ( r , Γ ) B ( r ) , ( 5 ) where 114 ψ = ψ ( r , Γ ) = α tanh ( β d s ( r , Γ ) ) / 2 . ( 6 ) is a soft repulsive potential ( Fig . 2L ) that depends on the distance d s ( r , Γ ) ( Fig . 2B - C ) , given by 115 d s ( r , Γ ) = sign ( r ) d ( r , Γ ) , sign ( r ) = 8 > > < > > : − 1 if r ∈ Ω 1 if r / ∈ Ω , d ( r , Γ ) = min s ∈ Γ = ∂ Ω | | r − s | | . ( 7 ) Thus , barbed ends closer to the membrane have greater contributions to the potential energy . Note 116 that when α , β −→ ∞ , the membrane is a reflective boundary . We use a signed distance to track 117 the relative position of r with respect to the spine membrane . 118 The force generated by actin is balanced by an opposing force generated by the membrane 119 5 F mem , which counteracts membrane deformations and is given by 120 F mem = − ∂ E mem ∂ Γ , ( 8 ) where 121 E mem = κ 2 Z Γ d AH 2 ( 9 ) represents the membrane Helfrich free energy due to bending ( Helfrich 1973 ) . Here , H is the mean 122 curvature , and κ is the bending modulus . Note that we consider the membrane as a 2D elastic 123 continuum with negligible thickness , as in ( Krüger 2012 ; Deserno 2015 ) . The volume and surface 124 area of the spine membrane are unconstrained due to the influx of proteins and membrane addition 125 through traﬀicking mechanisms ( Yang and Liu 2022 ) . Thus , we do not consider membrane tension 126 and osmotic pressure in our model . 127 2 . 1 . 1 Actin dynamics 128 F - actin in dendritic spines is distributed in two different pools , the stable pool and the dynamic pool . 129 In contrast to the stable pool of actin , with a lifetime of ∼ 17 min , the dynamic pool undergoes rapid 130 treadmilling ( ∼ 40 s ) ( Honkura et al . 2008 ) . We assume that the structural changes in dendritic 131 spines are mostly driven by the dynamic pool that has short filaments with uncapped ( + ) ends 132 undergoing continuous polymerization , which generate F actin . Therefore , we do not explicitly model 133 the stable pool , which only accounts for 5 % of the total F - actin ( Honkura et al . 2008 ) . We keep 134 track of the number of barbed ends per unit volume B ( r , t ) at position r ∈ L ⊂ R 3 , where L is 135 a cubic lattice domain ( see Fig . 2F - G ) , instead of F - actin or G - actin concentration . Note that 136 keeping track of the number of barbed ends instead of the number of actin filaments reduces the 137 complexity of the model because otherwise , we would have to account for the length of the filaments . 138 Here , we assume that actin filaments with barbed ends have similar lengths . Although this is a 139 simplifying assumption , the modeled F - actin is dynamic and has a short length ( Honkura et al . 140 2008 ) , which we expect to exert similar force to the membrane ; hence , differences in F - actin length 141 are negligible . Lastly , we assume that ATP is not depleted throughout the simulation . 142 6 The dynamics of the number of barbed ends per unit volume are given by 143 ∂B ∂t = −∇ · ( ν d B ) | { z } F - actin elongation + η ∇ · ( f u B ) | { z } repulsive force density − k β B | { z } basal efflux + Ψ 0 | { z } scale factor 0 B @ f nuc | { z } nucleation function + f sev | { z } severing function + I β | { z } basal influx + I S , β ( r , t ) | { z } stimulus - triggered influx 1 CA = − v · ∇ B − B ∇ · v | { z } F - actin elongation + η ( f u · ∇ B ) + ηB ∇ · f u | { z } repulsive force density − k β B | { z } basal efflux + Ψ 0 | { z } scale factor 0 B @ f nuc | { z } nucleation function + f sev | { z } severing function + I β | { z } basal influx + I S , β ( r , t ) | { z } stimulus - triggered influx 1 CA , ( 10 ) where k β is a constant basal efflux rate . The basal influx I β of actin is due to local actin synthesis 144 ( Cajigas et al . 2012 ; Tiruchinapalli et al . 2003 ) . Because the proteins used in the model are dispersed 145 in the spine head , we assume a homogeneous basal influx . The stimulus - triggered influx I S , β mimics 146 the transient influx upon stimulation ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) . Hence , it is nonzero only during a brief 147 window of time after stimulus initiation ( 1 minute ) . In line with experimental observations ( Bosch 148 et al . 2014 ) , we localize the stimulus - triggered influx to the spine head . For consistency of units , 149 these terms are multiplied by a conversion factor Ψ 0 that changes from concentration units in µM 150 to the number of barbed ends per µm 3 . ∇ represents the gradient operator . Note that the number 151 of barbed ends per unit volume is not conserved due to the stimulus - triggered influx . 152 The first term in Eq . ( 10 ) , −∇ · ( ν d B ) , denotes the change in the barbed ends per unit volume 153 due to the polymerization of G - actin in the direction d = d ( r , Γ ) = ∇ d s ( r , Γ ) , d s is defined in Eq . 154 7 ( Fig . 2D ) . Hence , d is the unit vector emanating from r and directed to the closest point in 155 the membrane . F - actin ( + ) ends are continuously polymerizing G - actin at a speed ν . Since the 156 dynamic pool treadmills fast and accounts for 95 % of F - actin in the spine ( Honkura et al . 2008 ) , we 157 take the actin polymerization velocity to be fixed and independent of actin concentration . Thus , 158 v = ν d represents the velocity field of actin polymerization . 159 The second term in Eq . ( 10 ) , η ∇ · ( f u B ) , accounts for the change in B due to a force density 160 f u , given by 161 f u = f u ( r , Γ ) = −∇ ψ ( r , Γ ) , ( 11 ) 7 where ψ is the is a soft repulsive potential defined in Eq . ( 6 ) . Actin filaments interact with the 162 intracellular environment , which includes transient attachments to the substrate ( Doubrovinski 163 and Kruse 2011 ) . The effects of such interactions are represented by effective filament motility 164 parameter η that reduces the impact of ∇ · f u on B . The force field f u confines the system to Ω 165 ( Doubrovinski and Kruse 2011 ) . Note that the vectors of f u have direction d ( Fig . 2D , H ) . Hence , 166 f u can describe the force that generates a retrograde flow of F - actin to create a gap between the 167 barbed end and the membrane to fit G - actin during polymerization . 168 The nucleation function accounts for the nucleation of new filaments with uncapped ( + ) ends 169 by Arp2 / 3 binding to actin filaments . We choose the nucleation function proposed by ( Carlsson , 170 Wear , and Cooper 2004 ) 171 f nuc = f nuc ( A , B ) = k nuc A Ψ 1 B , ( 12 ) which reflects the side - branching of Arp2 / 3 . This function agrees with the observations in ( Risca 172 et al . 2012 ) , where the nucleation of new filaments is enhanced on the side of bent filaments . Here , 173 k nuc represents the nucleation rate , A is the Arp2 / 3 concentration , and Ψ 1 is a unit conversion 174 factor . 175 Cofilin severs F - actin in a concentration - dependent manner ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard 176 2006 ) , creating new filaments with uncapped ( + ) ends . Based on observations of ( Bosch et al . 177 2014 ) , we assume that during the first few minutes after LTP the concentration of F - actin in the 178 spine is higher than the concentration of cofilin . Because cofilin severs F - actin at low concentrations 179 ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard 2006 ) , we assume that cofilin binding to F - actin is cooperative ( De 180 La Cruz 2005 ) . This is represented by the severing rate function 181 f sev = f sev ( C , B ) = k sev C n k n + C n Ψ 1 B , ( 13 ) where k sev is the severing rate , k n is the dissociation constant , n is the Hill coeﬀicient to capture 182 the cooperative nature of the kinetics , and C represents the concentration of cofilin . 183 8 2 . 1 . 2 Arp2 / 3 Dynamics 184 The evolution of Arp2 / 3 concentration over time is given by 185 ∂A ∂t = −∇ · ( ξν mp d A ) | { z } bulk flow − k A A | { z } degradation − f nuc | { z } nucleation function + I A | { z } basal influx + I S , A ( r , t ) | { z } stimulus - triggered influx , ( 14 ) where k A is a constant degradation rate . We assume that as the dendritic spine expands , the 186 Arp2 / 3 molecules are transported towards the membrane by a bulk flow , as in ( Tania , Condeelis , 187 and Edelstein - Keshet 2013 ) . Note that the motion of the bulk flow is driven by the motion of 188 F - actin since actin is highly dense in the spine . The speed of the bulk flow is given by ξν mp , with 189 ν mp representing the protrusion velocity . To ease the model simulations , we make the following 190 simplifications : 1 ) instead of calculating ν mp at each node of the mesh representing the spine 191 membrane , we take the velocity of the protrusion at one side of the spine head for all nodes , as 192 described in Section 2 . 4 . 2 ) If the protrusion shrinks at that location , i . e . , the velocity direction 193 is opposite to the expanding direction , we take ν mp = 0 to avoid numerical instability . 3 ) The 194 polymerization velocity ( ν in Eq . 10 ) is lower than ν mp . Thus , we multiply ν mp by 0 < ξ < 1 to 195 have similar velocities in all the variables and avoid numerical problems . This can represent the 196 hindering of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin by the high density of proteins inside the dendritic spine ( Helm 197 et al . 2021 ) . 198 2 . 1 . 3 Cofilin Dynamics 199 The evolution of cofilin concentration is given by 200 ∂C ∂t = −∇ · ( ξν mp d C ) | { z } bulk flow − k C C | { z } degradation − f sev | { z } severing function + I C | { z } basal influx + I S , C ( r , t ) | { z } stimulus - triggered influx , ( 15 ) where k C is the degradation rate . Note that cofilin is also transported by bulk flow towards the 201 membrane at speed ξν mp . 202 9 2 . 2 Numerical implementation 203 In the model , the dynamics of actin barbed ends , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin are given by Eqs . ( 10 ) , ( 14 ) , 204 and ( 15 ) . In the simulation , these equations are solved over time in a cubic domain with an 205 embedded triangular mesh representing the dendritic spine membrane ( Fig . 2E ) . A signed distance 206 function is used to calculate the proximity of the chemical species to the membrane ( Fig . 2B ) . The 207 force generated by actin polymerization and the force generated by the membrane are calculated 208 from the spatial location of the barbed ends and the geometry of the spine mesh , respectively . 209 These forces dictate the evolution of the spine mesh ( Eq . 3 ) . To reach a stable spine morphology , 210 we set the basal influx to be homogeneously distributed inside the spine head and impose absorbing 211 boundary conditions because the proteins have a stable arrangement in the spine neck ( Bär et al . 212 2016 ) . The basal influx remains in the same location throughout the simulation ( cyan circles in Fig . 213 2I ) . We assume that the stimulus - triggered influx rapidly reaches the spine head at ∆ x distance from 214 the membrane and within z = 0 . 7 and z = 1 µm ( red triangles in Fig . 2I ) . We restrict the height of 215 the stimulus location to capture the observations that the configuration of the postsynaptic density 216 ( PSD ) , a dense receptor site at the tip of the spine , remains stable during the early phase of sLTP 217 ( Bosch et al . 2014 ; Tønnesen et al . 2014 ) , i . e . , the duration of the simulations . Finally , we scale the 218 stimulus - triggered influx to the initial head size to ensure that the same amount of proteins flows 219 into the spine during the stimulus time window . 220 We solve the system of partial differential equations using MATLAB’s ( MATLAB 2021 ) ode45 221 solver at each time - step ∆ t for all positions r of a discretized cubic lattice domain L ∈ R 3 with ∆ x 222 spacing ( Fig . 2J ) . The gradient operator is discretized using an explicit finite difference scheme . 223 The spine membrane Γ is approximated by a 3D polygon with a triangular isotropic mesh consisting 224 of n v vertices located at s i ∈ R 3 , i ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . . , n v } ( Fig . 2K ) . Γ is updated according to Eq . ( 3 ) at 225 each time - step . For numerical accuracy , the membrane is remeshed using an isotropic remesher 226 ( Helf 2021 ) ( based on OpenMesh OpenMesh 2020 ) , with a target edge length of ∆ s . The points 227 corresponding to the base of the dendrite are fixed throughout the simulation ( Fig . 2A ) . See 228 Figure 3 for a flowchart of the simulation . 229 10 2 . 2 . 1 Membrane Discretization 230 In this section , we present the discretized version of the continuous PDE system that we implement 231 in the simulation . Note that we use the concentration of Apr2 / 3 and cofilin , or the number of barbed 232 ends per unit volume ( Fig . 2G ) instead of modeling the structure of the dendritic spine cytoskeleton 233 ( Fig . 2F ) . The points of the cubic domain mesh r remain constant over the simulation ( Fig . 2E , J ) . 234 A triangular mesh that represents the spine membrane is embedded in this cubic domain ( Fig . 2K ) . 235 The position of the nodes of the spine mesh s change at each time - step according to Eq . ( 3 ) . 236 The distance d ( r , Γ ) , defined in Eq . ( 7 ) , corresponds to the minimum distance from the lattice 237 point r to the hexagonal mesh representing the membrane Γ . For its calculation , there are two 238 cases ( Fig . 2D ) : 239 1 . The closest point to the membrane from r is a vertex s . Then , 240 d ( r , Γ ) = √ w · w , w = r − s . ( 16 ) 2 . The closest point to the membrane from r is the triangular face i that spans through the 241 vertices ( s i , s i + 1 , s i + 2 ) . Then , 242 d ( r , Γ ) = | w · n i | , n i = N i √ N i · N i , N i = ( s i + 1 − s i ) × ( s i + 2 − s i ) , ( 17 ) where N i is the normal vector and × represents the cross product . 243 In our numerical implementation , the normal vector to the mesh surface points to the outside of 244 the spine , and the polymerization direction is − w because we are using the signed distance . This 245 is considered in the calculations by changing the signs accordingly . 246 For the calculation of the force generated by the membrane F mem ( Eq . 8 ) , we follow ( Zhu , Lee , 247 and Rangamani 2022 ) and take the bending force with the spontaneous curvature equal to zero . 248 To obtain the initial spine shape , we construct a mesh with a spheroid connected to the x - y plane 249 representing the membrane via a cylinder , which represents the spine neck . To obtain a stable 250 shape , we let the position of the vertices evolve according to Eq . ( 3 ) , but only considering the force 251 generated by the membrane ( i . e . , F actin = 0 ) . We anchor the spine to the dendrite by fixing the 252 vertices corresponding to the dendrite ( magenta points in Fig . 2A ) . 253 11 2 . 2 . 2 Code Accessibility 254 The code has been deposited in Zenodo ( https : / / zenodo . org / records / 10114856 ) . 255 2 . 3 Constraining kinetic parameters to experimental measurements 256 Experimental results from ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) form the foundation of the temporal dynamics of the 257 number of barbed ends , and Arp2 / 3 and cofilin concentration in our model . Therefore , we fit the 258 model parameters to the data in ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) that shows the normalized concentrations of 259 β - actin , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin - 1 in dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 neurons after inducing sLTP 260 by 2 photon glutamate uncaging for 1 minute ( Fig . 4A - B ) . Other parameters are taken from the 261 literature or set to a physiological range ( Table 1 ) . 262 2 . 3 . 1 Protein Dynamics 263 We obtain the data points from Figure 1 in ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) by annotating the plots in Fiji 264 ( Schindelin et al . 2012 ) with the multi - point tool . This figure shows the volume ( RFP ) and amount 265 of GFP protein quantified by the relative fluorescence intensity ( F ) to the average baseline ( F0 ) . 266 The points are exported to Matlab ( MATLAB 2021 ) using the ReadImageJROI . m function ( Muir 267 and Kampa 2015 ) . After scaling the points to the corresponding scale set in Fiji , we calculate the 268 normalized concentration of the proteins as the ratio between the protein fluorescence intensity and 269 the spine volume , as in ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) ( Fig . 4A ) . 270 For estimation of the parameters corresponding to the actin , cofilin , and Arp2 / 3 influx into 271 the dendritic spine upon LTP , we develop a minimal model that assumes that these proteins are 272 continuously entering and exiting the spine . Moreover , we consider protein degradation and recent 273 experimental findings showing that some proteins , like β - actin , are synthesized locally in the spine 274 ( Cajigas et al . 2012 ; Tiruchinapalli et al . 2003 ) . For simplicity , we have gathered the continuous 275 protein influx and synthesis in a source term I , and the efflux and degradation in a decaying rate 276 k . Besides these continuous fluctuations , we consider a protein influx triggered by LTP induction 277 I S ( t ) , only present during the glutamate uncaging ( 1 minute ) . We assume that I S ( t ) are constant 278 values and that during the stimulus window , corresponding to the 1 - minute of glutamate uncaging , 279 I S ( t ) > 0 , and I S ( t ) = 0 otherwise . Hence , in this minimal model , the dynamics for the normalized 280 12 concentrations of β - actin ( β ) , Cofilin - 1 ( C ) , and Arp2 / 3 ( A ) are given by 281 d β d t = I S , β ( t ) + I β − k β β , d A d t = I S , A ( t ) + I A − k A A , d C d t = I S , C ( t ) + I C − k C C . ( 18 ) To reduce the number of parameters and guarantee that the pre - stimulus ( i . e . , I S , β ( t ) = I S , A ( t ) = 282 I S , C ( t ) = 0 ) level of protein concentration equals one for all the proteins , we first calculate the 283 steady state of the system ( β ∗ , A ∗ , C ∗ ) = ( I β / k β , I A / k A , I C / k C ) . Then , we scale the system using 284 the nondimensional quantities ( b ( t ) , a ( t ) , c ( t ) ) = ( β ( t ) / β ∗ , A ( t ) / A ∗ , C ( t ) / C ∗ ) , which gives 285 d b d t = I S , β ( t ) β ∗ + k β ( 1 − b ) , d a d t = I S , A ( t ) A ∗ + k A ( 1 − a ) , d c d t = I S , C ( t ) C ∗ + k C ( 1 − c ) . ( 19 ) We fit the data points from ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) to the solutions of Eqs . ( 19 ) with the lsqcurvefit 286 function in Matlab to obtain the values of the efflux rate constants : k β , k A , and k C ; and the 287 influxes upon LTP : I S , β ( t ) , I S , A ( t ) , and I S , C ( t ) . We use the ode45 solver to evolve the system in 288 Eqs . ( 19 ) . Figure 4B shows the resulting fit ( squared norm of the residual = 0 . 0538 ) , and the 289 resulting parameters are in Table 1 . We obtain the value of actin basal concentrations from ( Helm 290 et al . 2021 ) , and for Arp2 / 3 and cofilin , we take the mean of the molarity of the cytoskeleton 291 proteins , hence ( β ∗ , A ∗ , C ∗ ) = ( 3000 , 20 , 40 ) µM . 292 We use a simplified version of our model that neglects the spatial component ( i . e . , setting 293 to zero the F - actin elongation , repulsive force density , and bulk flow terms in Eqs . 10 , 14 , and 294 15 ) to compare the model output against experimental measurements ( Fig . 4C ) . Note that the 295 evolution of the normalized concentration of barbed ends in the model is similar to the normalized 296 concentration of β - actin from the experimental data , despite the differences in the evolution of 297 the concentrations of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin ( Fig . 4D ) . This discrepancy between the evolution in the 298 experimental data and the model arises because the nucleation and severing events in the model 299 reduce the protein concentrations ( terms − f nuc and − f sev in Eqs . ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , respectively ) . 300 13 During our data fitting , we did not account for the interactions between ABPs and actin because 301 the experimental setup does not distinguish when cofilin is bound or unbound to F - actin ( Bosch 302 et al . 2014 ) ( Eq . 19 ) . For example , the slow decay of cofilin normalized concentration in the data is 303 attributed to cofilin binding to F - actin and stabilizing it ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) . However , in the model , 304 cofilin normalized concentration sharply decays after stimulation to a value below pre - stimulation 305 due to the enhancement of severing events induced by the increase of F - actin . The concentration of 306 Arp2 / 3 in the model exhibits a similar decay due to the increase of nucleation events promoted by 307 the increase of F - actin . We are interested in the evolution of the spine expansion upon LTP , which 308 we assumed to be regulated by the force generated by actin polymerization . Hence , we considered 309 this model to be a good proxy for the interactions between proteins upon LTP because it exhibits a 310 trend in the evolution of barbed ends similar to the evolution of β - actin in the experimental data . 311 2 . 3 . 2 Scale Factors 312 To convert the concentrations of β - actin to number of barbed ends per µm 3 , we assume that there 313 are 167 G - actin per F - actin since the mean length of dynamic F - actin in dendritic spines is around 314 450 nm ( range : 200 - 700 nm , Honkura et al . 2008 ) and a monomer of actin contributes to 2 . 7 nm 315 of the filament length ( Mogilner and Oster 1996 ) . To change from number of molecules to µM , 316 we use Avogadro’s number and obtain Ψ 0 ≈ 3 . 6 number of barbed ends / (cid:0) µm 3 µM (cid:1) . To convert 317 number of barbed ends per µm 3 to concentration of Arp2 / 3 , we follow ( Tania , Condeelis , and 318 Edelstein - Keshet 2013 ) and assume that there is a minimal distance of 37 nm between branches 319 of a filament . Hence , there are 12 molecules of Arp2 / 3 per F - actin , which gives a scale factor of 320 Ψ 1 ≈ 0 . 02 µm 3 µM / number of barbed ends . 321 2 . 4 Force - velocity calculation 322 To calculate the protrusion velocity of the spine ( Eqs . 14 , and 15 ) , we select a node in the mesh 323 corresponding to the middle of the spine head at the start of the simulation and keep track of its 324 horizontal displacements in a fixed x - direction at each time - step . The velocity is calculated by 325 dividing the displacement by the time step duration in every iteration of the model . We assume 326 that negative displacements have zero protrusion velocity . For the force - velocity relationship , the 327 forces are measured locally , i . e . , we take the average force generated by the nodes of the triangular 328 14 face that intersects the cell displacement trajectory . 329 2 . 5 Stimulus 330 In our model , the stimulus from the presynaptic terminal triggers an influx of proteins into the spine , 331 consistent with the observations in ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) . Therefore , we assume that the stimulus - 332 triggered terms I S , β , I S , A , and I S , C in Eqs . ( 10 ) , ( 14 ) , and ( 15 ) , respectively , are set to the values 333 in Table 1 divided by the number of basal protein locations during the 1 minute period , and zero 334 otherwise . The division ensures that the total levels of proteins in the model match experimental 335 data . The basal influxes are also divided by the number of basal protein locations . Before and after 336 the stimulus window , these terms are equal to zero . The stimulus - triggered influx is normalized 337 for the spine volume , so the amount of stimulus - triggered influx is independent of the size of the 338 spine . Note that we localize the stimulus - triggered influx to the spine head instead of simulating 339 its transport from the dendrite through the spine neck because the experimental data only shows 340 the increase of the proteins in the spine head . Moreover , the diffusion of G - actin from the shaft to 341 the spine is fast ( time constant of 0 . 005 - 0 . 67 s , Honkura et al . 2008 ) , and the available data does 342 not determine whether the proteins enter the spine using vesicular transport or diffusion . Thus , 343 modeling the transport of actin and ABPs through the spine neck would represent an additional 344 delay to the dynamics for which we do not have experimental data . Moreover , most actin filaments 345 in the spine neck are stable and form rings ( Bär et al . 2016 ; Honkura et al . 2008 ) , suggesting that 346 the dynamics between actin and ABPs can differ in that domain . 347 3 Results 348 Using a minimal model for spine actin - membrane interactions , we investigated the spatio - temporal 349 evolution of the number of barbed ends and concentration of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin . We used 3D 350 numerical simulations to validate our model against experimental observations of spine growth 351 during sLTP qualitatively . We investigated how different mechanical parameters can affect spine 352 growth dynamics during a single stimulus and finally , predict how spine volume can change due to 353 multiple stimuli . These results are discussed in detail below . 354 15 3 . 1 Stimulus - triggered influx reproduces experimentally observed spine growth 355 dynamics 356 We begin with an investigation of the spatial distribution of the number of barbed ends and the 357 concentration of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin over time . First , we ran the simulation for 1 minute while 358 keeping the membrane fixed . We observed that the ABPs kept a similar spatial configuration at 359 the end of 1 minute while the barbed ends increased at the center of the spine head ( Fig . 5C ) . We 360 speculate that the increase is due to the repulsive force density term in the barbed ends dynamics 361 ( Eq . 10 ) . Therefore , we allowed membrane evolution for 3 minutes ( Eq . 3 ) and investigated 362 whether the barbed end concentration reached a steady state when the force generated by them 363 pushed the membrane forward . We found that the increase in the number of barbed ends slowed 364 down at the end of the 3 minutes . Moreover , the shape of the dendritic spine settled to a new 365 equilibrium shape in which the length of the neck was reduced and its width increased while the 366 width of the head was reduced ( Fig . 5A ) . Therefore , for the initiation of each simulation condition , 367 we use this framework in which mechanical equilibrium is achieved . 368 Having established the mechanical equilibrium , we next simulated sLTP induction in the spines 369 by activating the stimulus - triggered influx inside the head ( Fig . 2I ) for 1 minute , which results in a 370 transient spine enlargement ( Fig . 5C ) . Four minutes after the stimulus , the spines settled to a new 371 larger size with a shorter and wider neck consistent with experimental observations ( Bosch et al . 372 2014 ; Tønnesen et al . 2014 ; Yang and Liu 2022 ) . The final shape is shown in Figure 5B . 373 Next , we integrated the values of the number of barbed ends and concentration of ABPs over 374 time in the cubic domain to understand how the stimulus alters the dynamics of ABPs . Figure 375 5D shows that the total values of the number of barbed ends , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin concentration 376 equilibrate before the stimulus is added at 4 min . When the stimulus was triggered , we observed 377 that the number of barbed ends increased , as in the experimental data ( Fig . 4A ) . The cofilin 378 concentration also increased while the Arp2 / 3 concentration decrease slowed down ( Fig . 5D ) . 379 Arp2 / 3 decreased throughout the simulation because it is sequestered for nucleation events ( see Eqs . 380 14 , 12 ) . After stimulation , the variables decayed at rates similar to the experimental observations 381 ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) ( compare with Fig . 4A ) . These dynamics , informed by the parameter estimation , 382 qualitatively replicate the experimentally observed protein dynamics . 383 16 We next calculated the spine volume and surface area over time ( Fig . 5E ) . Note that small 384 fluctuations appeared when we allowed membrane changes ( after minute 1 ) driven by the balance 385 between the force generated by actin polymerization and the force generated by the membrane . 386 The spine volume increased during the stimulus and continued to increase at a slower rate after the 387 stimulus was turned off . The surface area also increased during the stimulus but settled to a new 388 equilibrium value afterward . The first phase of growth is consistent with the main features of sLTP , 389 where the spine head size increases in response to a stimulus ( Bosch et al . 2014 ; Matsuzaki et al . 390 2004 ; Tønnesen et al . 2014 ) . However , in experimental data , the spine shrinks after the first phase 391 but we don’t see this shrinkage in our model , which is likely a result of our simplifying assumptions . 392 The addition of further mechanisms to our model could prevent such an increase . 393 We also measured the radius of the spine neck and head at the same height over time ( z ∼ 0 . 63 394 µm and z = 0 . 84 µm , respectively , see Fig . 5F ) . While the spine head radius showed a similar 395 trend to the spine surface area , the spine neck increased after the stimulus finished , consistent with 396 ( Tønnesen et al . 2014 ) . After normalizing the values of volume , surface area , spine neck radius , and 397 head radius ( Fig . 5H ) , we observed an increase in the spine volume ( 14 . 92 % ) and a small increase 398 in the spine surface area ( 3 . 03 % ) and spine head radius ( 4 . 6139 % ) after stimulation . Figure 5G 399 shows the normalized variables of Figure 5D divided over the normalized volume . The increase 400 in cofilin concentration is larger than the increase in the number of barbed ends and similar to 401 experimental data ( Fig . 4B ) . Note that in the model , the decrease of the ABPs and number of 402 barbed ends after stimulation is faster . Moreover , Arp2 / 3 shows a sustained decrease . Overall , 403 we found that our 3D model qualitatively replicates the temporal trends in protein concentration 404 observed in experiments ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) . 405 To further inspect how the forces generated by the membrane and actin polymerization influence 406 the shape evolution of the spine , we plotted the membrane mesh color - coded by the norm of these 407 forces ( Fig . 6A ) . During the first phase of the simulation , where the membrane is fixed , we observed 408 that the actin polymerization force dominates in the spine head while the membrane force dominates 409 in the spine neck . When the membrane is allowed to move , the actin polymerization force decays 410 at the tip of the spine head , and the membrane force increases at the base of the spine neck . 411 As expected , the force generated by actin polymerization increased in the spine head during the 412 stimulation window but settled to a new steady state after 4 min . Throughout the simulation , the 413 17 force generated by the membrane is higher at the spine neck and the base of the spine rather than 414 at the spine head . Note that the higher force in the spine neck arises from the smaller radius of 415 the neck compared to the spine head radius while the higher force at the shaft is due to the sharp 416 change in curvature in the junction of the spine neck and the dendrite . 417 To quantify the evolution of the forces generated by the membrane and actin polymerization 418 over time , we integrated the norm of the force vectors corresponding to each node of the spine 419 membrane ( Fig . 6B ) . At the start of the simulation , where the spine membrane is fixed , there is 420 a rapid decay of the total force generated by actin polymerization because the barbed ends are 421 pushed back by the repulsive force density ( Fig . 5C ) . The forces settled to a stable value when 422 the membrane was allowed to evolve . During the stimulation window , the force generated by actin 423 polymerization increased while the force generated by the membrane showed a smaller increase . 424 We further analyzed this difference by obtaining the normalized change in the forces ( Fig . 6C ) . 425 Although the total force generated by the membrane has a smaller increase than the force generated 426 by actin polymerization , it decreases the effect of the force generated by actin when the forces are 427 added ( Fig . 6C ) . After stimulation , the force generated by actin polymerization decays to a value 428 smaller than that before stimulation , which relates to the trend shown by the barbed ends ( Fig . 429 5G ) . The sum of the forces reaches an equilibrium at the end of the simulation . 430 The force - velocity relationships are shown in Figure 6D - F , for the forces generated by the 431 membrane , actin polymerization , and their sum , respectively . We calculated the force - velocity 432 for spine growth by calculating the membrane horizontal displacement at the middle of the spine 433 head and measured the forces locally . This relationship is nonlinear ( could not be fitted to a line ) . 434 Consistent with other actin - mediated force - velocity relationships , we find that the velocity is higher 435 for smaller forces ( McGrath et al . 2003 ; Brangbour et al . 2011 ) . We observed that higher actin 436 polymerization forces do not correspond to faster protrusions ( Fig . 6E ) , which signals a delay in 437 the membrane response to polymerization forces . 438 3 . 1 . 1 Barbed ends determine spine volume change 439 The Ca 2 + entry due to the spine activation of the NMDARs triggers a signaling cascade that leads 440 to activation of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin ( Rangamani , Levy , et al . 2016 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Because , in our model , 441 we only account for the external influx of these proteins upon LTP , we investigated whether a further 442 18 increase due to NMDAR activation enchances spine enlargement . For this , we assumed that the 443 activated proteins contribute to the proteins entering upon LTP induction . Thus , we increased the 444 value of I S , A and I S , C by 50 % . To have a better representation of the changes in volume , number 445 of barbed ends , and concentration of proteins , we obtained their normalized values at each minute 446 of the simulation ( Fig . 7 ) . We found that the increase of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin ( Fig . 7C - D ) slightly 447 increases the production of barbed ends ( Fig . 7B ) . However , there is a slight reduction in the 448 normalized volume after stimulation , from 1 . 1493 to 1 . 1287 ( Fig . 7A ) . Thus , we concluded that 449 the increase in Arp2 / 3 and cofilin might produce a negative effect on spine enlargement . 450 We then examined the effect of disrupting the stimulus - triggered influx of barbed ends , Arp2 / 3 , 451 and cofilin on spine enlargement . We observed that setting I S , A = 0 or I S , C = 0 during stimulation 452 had an insignificant effect on spine enlargement : the normalized increase in volume at the end of the 453 stimulation changes from 1 . 1493 to 1 . 1417 and 1 . 14926 , respectively ( Fig . 7A ) . Only impeding the 454 stimulus - triggered influx of actin hindered the increase in spine volume to 3 . 72 % after stimulation . 455 Note that when I S , β = 0 , the peak of normalized Arp2 / 3 and cofilin concentration after stimulation 456 exhibits an increase , proving that these proteins are sequestered by the stimulus - triggered influx of 457 actin through nucleation and severing events ( Fig . 7C - D ) . From these simulations , we conclude that 458 as long as there are suﬀicient barbed ends , spine volume change will be robust . The biochemical 459 details of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin are critical for governing the dynamics of actin reorganization ( Pollard 460 and Borisy 2003 ) but the number of barbed ends determines the growth itself . We inferred that 461 the enhancement of barbed ends after LTP induction is suﬀicient to overcome the membrane force 462 and allow spine enlargement , in line with previous theoretical work in cell protrusion ( Rangamani , 463 Fardin , et al . 2011 ; Lacayo et al . 2007 ) . 464 3 . 1 . 2 Effect of membrane bending stiffness on spine morphology 465 The bending stiffness of neuronal membranes varies depending on the neuron type and compartment 466 ( i . e . , cell body , neurite , growth cone ) from 1 . 8 × 10 − 19 to 2 . 3 × 10 − 19 J ( Pontes et al . 2013 ) . In 467 our model , we noticed that the total membrane force exhibited only a small increase during the 468 stimulation window ( Fig . 6C ) . However , the total membrane force diminished the increase of the 469 force generated by actin polymerization . Therefore , we further investigated the effect of the force 470 generated by the membrane on spine growth upon stimulation . To do this , we varied the bending 471 19 stiffness κ in Eq . ( 9 ) by 25 % its value in the simulations . We observed changing membrane stiffness 472 altered the spine shape after stimulation . With a larger membrane stiffness , the spines show a wider 473 neck and thinner head ( Fig . 8A ) , suggesting that the increase in the membrane stiffness counteracts 474 the high curvature of the neck and the side of the spine head . Decreasing the bending stiffness 475 results in spines with a thinner neck ( Fig . 8B ) . 476 Interestingly , we observed that the increase of volume of the spine during stimulation is similar 477 for the different values of membrane stiffness ( V = 1 . 1493 , 1 . 1447 , and 1 . 1347 for κ , 1 . 25 κ , and 478 0 . 75 κ , respectively , Fig . 8C ) . However , the spine with reduced membrane stiffness showed a smaller 479 change in volume after stimulation due to the reduced spine neck radius . The most notable change 480 in the normalized number of barbed ends , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin for different values of κ occurs after 481 the stimulation window ( Figs . 8D - F ) . The normalized concentrations of B , A , and C are smaller for 482 increased bending stiffness . There is an increase in the force generated by actin polymerization upon 483 stimulation when the membrane stiffness increases ( Fig . 8H ) . We assumed that such an increase is 484 due to the resistance of the membrane in the middle of the membrane head , where the curvature is 485 smaller and the barbed ends need to produce a higher force to enlarge the spine head . As expected , 486 the changes in the force generated by the membrane are directly related to the membrane stiffness : 487 when the membrane is stiffer it generates a larger force ( Fig . 8G ) . Note that a decrease in κ results 488 in a decrease of the overall force ( i . e . , | | F mem + F actin | | , Fig . 8I ) . Taken together , we conclude 489 that the resistance offered by the membrane affects the spine shape dynamics and the membrane 490 mechanical properties due to lipid and protein composition could play an important role in sLTP . 491 3 . 2 Perisynaptic mechanical forces promote spine enlargement 492 Dendritic spines are embedded in an extracellular matrix and surrounded by other neurons and 493 glia cells ( Fig . 9A ) . Hence , spine enlargement can be promoted or hindered by these perisynaptic 494 elements ( Dityatev and Rusakov 2011 ) . Recent experimental results show that coupling F - actin 495 in the spine head with the extracellular space via a molecular clutch is necessary to achieve spine 496 enlargement upon LTP ( Kastian et al . 2021 ) ( Fig . 9A ) . This molecular clutch mechanism was pro - 497 posed from the observation that the forward movement of the protrusion growth is variable despite 498 the retrograde flow being continuous . Such variation could be to be due to the transient linkage of 499 F - actin with membrane proteins bound to ligands on the substrate ( Mitchison and Kirschner 1988 ) . 500 20 In their experiments , Kastian et al . 2021 showed that shootin1a couples polymerizing F - actin to cell 501 adhesion molecules N - cadherin and L1 - CAM . Moreover , LTP induction triggered Pak1 - mediated 502 shootin1a phosphorylation , promoting the coupling between F - actin and adhesion molecules . This 503 clutch coupling is thought to reduce the retrograde flow of F - actin and increase the force generated 504 by actin polymerization ( Kastian et al . 2021 ) . Here , we investigated the impact of such coupling 505 on volume growth . 506 We assumed that upon LTP induction , shootin1a is highly phosphorylated , and hence , it me - 507 chanically couples F - actin to the extracellular adhesive substrates for the extent of the stimulation 508 window . To simulate the reduction of retrograde flow and the resulting enhancement of actin poly - 509 merization caused by this coupling , we first decreased the value of the effective filament mobility η 510 in Eq . ( 10 ) . We found that reducing η by 40 % decreases the normalized volume after stimulation 511 ( from 1 . 1493 to 1 . 1268 ) and affects the volume evolution of the spine ( Fig . 9C ) . Therefore , we in - 512 stead increased the polymerization velocity ν by 40 % in Eq . ( 10 ) , which caused a further reduction 513 in the normalized volume at the end of the stimulation window ( ∆ V = 1 . 1085 , Fig . 9C ) . Since 514 the normalized number of barbed ends per unit volume increases during this period ( Fig . 9D ) , we 515 concluded that the reduced change in volume results from the interaction between forces : when the 516 polymerization force increases , it increases the counteracting forces generated by the membrane . 517 Interestingly , combining the reduction in η and the increase in ν lessens the volume increment at 518 the end of the simulation ( Fig . 9C ) . 519 We next investigated which other mechanisms could enhance spine expansion . To allow spine en - 520 largement upon LTP the extracellular matrix remodels through the action of matrix matalloproteinase - 521 9 ( MMP - 9 ) ( Wang et al . 2008 ) . This protease degrades the extracellular matrix after LTP until 522 it is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases - 1 ( TIMP - 1 ) ( Magnowska et al . 523 2016 ) . We mimicked these interactions by decreasing the effective drag coeﬀicient ω by 40 % during 524 the stimulation window . We observed an enhancement in the normalized volume of 6 . 73 % after 525 the stimulation ( Fig . 9C , E ) . Moreover , when we combined the decrease in the drag coeﬀicient 526 with a rise in polymerization speed , the normalized volume change after the stimulation window 527 was enhanced by 8 . 65 % from control ( Fig . 9C , E ) . Interestingly , the normalized sum of the forces 528 generated by the membrane and actin polymerization reduces ( Fig . 9B , F ) indicating that the en - 529 hancement of spine enlargement after stimulation is achieved by a membrane that is more sensitive 530 21 to changes in the forces . 531 3 . 3 Repeated LTP inductions lead to a reduction in spine growth rate 532 Since synapses receive a series of stimuli ( Huang and Kandel 1994 ) , we finally investigated what 533 would happen to spine enlargement upon repeated LTP inductions . To do so , we simulated repeated 534 LTP inductions : the first at the start of the simulation , the second at minute 2 , and the third at 535 minute 4 . Thus , the spine was stimulated for one minute ( i . e . , I S > 0 in Eqs . 10 , 14 , and 15 ) and 536 let to rest for the following minute . We chose this stimulation protocol because the spine volume 537 increase is reduced after one - minute rest ( Fig . 10B ) . 538 We observed an increase in the size of the spine head and a shortening and widening of the spine 539 neck at the end of each stimulus ( Fig . 10A ) . The spine normalized volume increased with every LTP 540 induction ( Fig . 10B ) . Note that the volume increase after each induction is larger than the increase 541 between stimuli ( Figs . 10E ) . However , the volume increase lowers after each instance of the stimuli 542 ( 14 . 92 % , 12 . 6 % , and 10 . 36 % after the first , second , and third stimulus , respectively ) . Interestingly , 543 the peak of the normalized number of barbed ends per unit volume was smaller after each stimulus , 544 while the peak in normalized cofilin concentration was higher in the last stimulus ( Fig . 10C ) . The 545 normalized concentration of Arp2 / 3 reduced its decreasing rate during each stimulation window 546 ( Fig . 10C ) . 547 The peak of the total normalized actin force during the stimulation window decreases over time 548 while the force generated by the membrane has a steady increase during the simulation that is 549 independent of the repeated stimulations ( Fig . 10D ) . Note that after the third stimulation , the 550 normalized force generated by actin is lower than the normalized force generated by the membrane , 551 which can explain the reduction of the respective volume increase . Taken together , the change 552 in the trends of the normalized protein concentration and forces hint at a complex relationship 553 between the stimulus - triggered influx and the spine volume . In our simulation , spine enlargement 554 was dependent on the spine size at the start of the LTP induction : larger spines showed a smaller 555 increase , consistent with experimental observations ( Matsuzaki et al . 2004 ; Hobbiss , Ramiro - Cortés , 556 and Israely 2018 ) . 557 22 4 Discussion 558 In this work , we proposed a minimal biophysical model in which spine enlargement upon LTP is 559 driven by similar mechanisms to those of cell motility . Our model accounts for the spatial localiza - 560 tion and chemical reactions of actin barbed ends , Arp2 / 3 , and cofilin , and their interactions with 561 the spine membrane . For purposes of computational tractability , we only focused on a few key 562 ABPs . We chose ABPs that capture minimal actin remodeling events ( Pollard and Borisy 2003 ; 563 Pollard , Blanchoin , and Mullins 2000 ) and are known to be important for healthy brain function . 564 For example , failure of Arp2 / 3 function leads to spine loss and abnormal synaptic function , enhanc - 565 ing excitation and leading to similar symptoms to psychiatric disorders ( Kim , Rossi , et al . 2015 ) , 566 and experimental studies indicate that cofilin is involved in Alzheimer’s disease synaptic dysfunc - 567 tion ( Ben Zablah , Merovitch , and Jia 2020 ) . Importantly , the kinetic parameters of these species 568 were fitted to experimental data ( Bosch et al . 2014 ) , indicating that our model predictions represent 569 plausible dynamics . The spatiotemporal maps from the simulations give us a sense of how these 570 molecules may arrange themselves in the spine during active remodeling . It is possible that there 571 may be mislocalization of the proteins in the experiments due to the challenges associated with 572 the overexpression of recombinant proteins fused to GFP ( Suratkal , Yen , and Nishiyama 2021 ) , 573 resulting in miscalibration . Nonetheless , the main dynamic events of increase in actin barbed ends 574 and the net force generated are consistent with the literature ( Pantaloni , Clainche , and Carlier 575 2001 ; Mogilner and Oster 1996 ) . 576 Our simulations replicate the initial phase of rapid volume increase seen in experiments ( Bosch 577 et al . 2014 ; Matsuzaki et al . 2004 ; Okamoto et al . 2004 ) . The force - velocity relationships predicted 578 from our model are consistent with other actin - mediated force - velocity relationships ( McGrath 579 et al . 2003 ; Brangbour et al . 2011 ; Mogilner and Oster 1996 ) . The spatial nature of our model 580 allows us to investigate the forces distribution along the spine membrane over time . We observed 581 that rapid volume increase in our model is driven by the enhancement of the force generated by 582 actin polymerization due to the stimulus - triggered influx of actin . The neck becomes wider and 583 shorter after LTP induction , as observed in experimental data ( Tønnesen et al . 2014 ) , hinting that 584 membrane forces could drive changes in the spine neck . Concurrently , the total number of barbed 585 ends decreases below basal levels , thereby reducing the force generated by actin polymerization . 586 23 Then , the force generated by the membrane dominates , driving spine neck expansion , and hence 587 the slow increase in the total volume of the spine . Therefore , the rapid spine volume increase upon 588 stimulation is due to an enlargement of the spine head by increased actin polymerization while 589 the slow increase in the volume after stimulation is driven by the membrane counteracting the 590 large curvature of the spine neck . Further experiments are needed to test whether the interplay 591 between the polymerization and membrane forces explains the expansion and shrinkage of the spine . 592 Although we did not consider the effect of the periodic actin rings in the neck ( Bär et al . 2016 ; 593 Alimohamadi et al . 2021 ) , we observed that the neck retained its cylindrical structure . Future 594 extensions of our work could explore a previously proposed theoretical hypothesis suggesting that 595 such rings promote mechanical stability of the spine ( Alimohamadi et al . 2021 ) . 596 We showed that the increase of the spine volume upon LTP is enhanced when the interactions 597 between the spine and perisynaptic elements are included . Indeed , recent experimental data found 598 that the clutch molecules , which couple F - actin with the extracellular space , reduce the speed of 599 the retrograde flow and hence , promote the actin polymerization force driving spine enlargement 600 ( Kastian et al . 2021 ) . When the coupling with F - actin was disrupted , polymerization of F - actin 601 increased the retrograde flow ( Kastian et al . 2021 ) . Furthermore , the activity of MMP - 9 , which 602 drives extracellular proteolytic remodeling , is necessary and suﬀicient for spine enlargement and 603 synaptic potentiation ( Wang et al . 2008 ) . However , this activity has to be timely inhibited to 604 ensure synaptic responsiveness ( Magnowska et al . 2016 ) hinting to complex dynamics in the ECM . 605 We examined the spine response under repeated stimuli and observed that their volume ex - 606 pansion reduced after each stimulation . Thus , in line with experimental data ( Matsuzaki et al . 607 2004 ) , larger simulated spines experience less volume increase upon LTP ( Matsuzaki et al . 2004 ) . 608 This volume saturation is thought to be regulated by homeostatic mechanisms ( Turrigiano 2008 ) , 609 where the spine regulates its synaptic strength by increasing or decreasing the number of AMPARs 610 or NMDARs at the PSD . It has been shown that dendritic spines that experience these home - 611 ostatic mechanisms show larger volume increases upon LTP induction ( Hobbiss , Ramiro - Cortés , 612 and Israely 2018 ) . Interestingly , spines modulate mechanically their response to multiple stimuli 613 by stiffening ( Smith et al . 2007 ) . Here , we show that such homeostasis may be achieved by the 614 interaction between proteins and the forces that drive spine expansion ( Fig . 11 ) 615 Computationally , to our knowledge , this is the first 3D model that allows simultaneous protein 616 24 temporal and spatial evolution , described by partial differential equations ( PDEs ) in a moving 617 boundary framework , leading to asymmetric shape changes for sLTP . To facilitate computational 618 simulations and mathematical description of the model , we made some simplifying assumptions , 619 such as : 1 ) There is a large enhancement of protein concentration upon LTP , which allows us to 620 describe their dynamics using a continuum description ( PDEs ) . This limits the model to a short 621 time window after stimulation . 2 ) Instead of modeling the stimulus - triggered transport of proteins 622 from the dendrite to the spine head through the spine neck , we implemented a localized increment 623 of proteins in the spine head due to the lack of experimental data to determine the type and 624 dynamics of such transport . 3 ) We assumed that F - actin is constantly branching and severing and 625 only accounted for the number of barbed ends at each location instead of tracking the individual 626 actin filaments . Therefore , our model is not suitable to examine the length or orientation of F - actin . 627 4 ) We modeled the dynamics of free cofilin and Arp2 / 3 , and hence , removed the bound cofilin and 628 Arp2 / 3 through the terms f sev and f nuc , respectively ( see Eqs . 10 - 15 ) . Although these functions 629 describe the complex binding dynamics between the proteins , our model does not account for the 630 localization of the stable cofilin bound to F - actin . 5 ) We assumed unconstrained membrane addition 631 through traﬀicking mechanisms without accounting for the localization of exocytic and endocytic 632 zones ( Park et al . 2006 ) , which could influence the resulting spine shape . 6 ) Instead of modeling 633 the interactions with the ECM and other perisynaptic elements , we modified model parameters . 634 However , molecular clutches are complex and dynamic structures ( Giannone , Mège , and Thoumine 635 2009 ) and future extensions can incorporate the coupling of F - actin with the substrate through 636 adhesions binding and unbinding , as in cell protrusion models ( Sens 2020 ; Alert et al . 2015 ) . We 637 also focused on the biophysical aspects of spine growth but did not include the signaling events 638 that are a part of the process ( Ohadi , Schmitt , et al . 2019 ; Bell , Bartol , et al . 2019 ; Bell , Holst , 639 et al . 2022 ) . These signaling events are known to be regulated by the spine shape ( Ohadi and 640 Rangamani 2019 ; Bell , Holst , et al . 2022 ; Bell , Lee , and Rangamani 2022 ) . In future work , our 641 framework can be extended to include these upstream signaling events and downstream receptor 642 traﬀicking events . Furthermore , because simulations involved the whole cubic domain , presynaptic 643 and perisynaptic elements can be added at some computational cost . Recent progress in the analysis 644 of moving boundary problems could elucidate an understanding of the relationship between model 645 parameters and its dynamics ( Čanić 2021 ) . 646 25 In summary , we have shown that the simplest biochemical events associated with actin remod - 647 eling result in a volume increase upon LTP , which is enhanced when we account for the interaction 648 with the extracellular matrix . The spine volume increase lessens after multiple stimuli , which hints 649 at a possible homeostatic mechanism by the interaction between the proteins and the forces gener - 650 ated by the membrane . We anticipate that this work will set the stage for coupled modeling and 651 interrogation of the biochemical and mechanical events of sLTP in closer proximity than before . 652 Acknowledgements 653 This work was supported by the NIH Grant Number 1RF1DA055668 - 01 , NIH RO1 GM132106 , and 654 by an Air Force Oﬀice of Scientific Research Grant FA9550 - 18 - 1 - 0051 to P .

A ) Upon LTP induction , glutamate is released from the presynaptic neuron and taken up by the postsynaptic neuron . Consequently , a cascade of chemical reactions is initiated ( B ) , and an influx of actin , cofilin , and Arp2 / 3 into the spine is triggered . This remodels the spine cytoskeleton allowing for spine enlargement . C ) Actin filament treadmilling , branching , and severing events remodel the cytoskeleton . In this model , we focus on how the spatio - temporal dynamics of actin , cofilin , and Arp2 / 3 dictate the shape of the dendritic spine .
