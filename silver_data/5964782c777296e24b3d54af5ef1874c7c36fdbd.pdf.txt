In the pres - ent study we examined Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent “cross - talk” between these two protein kinase families . Using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors and domi - nant - negative kinases ( dnKinase ) , we identified a re - quirement for CaMKK acting through CaMKI in the stimulation of ERKs upon depolarization of the neuro - blastoma cell line , NG108 . Depolarization stimulated prolonged ERK and JNK activation that was blocked by the CaMKK inhibitor , STO - 609 ; this inhibition of ERK activation by STO - 609 was rescued by expression of a STO - 609 - insensitive mutant of CaMKK . However , activation of ERK by epidermal growth factor or car - bachol were not suppressed by inhibition of CaMKK , indicating specificity for this “cross - talk . ” To identify the downstream target of CaMKK that mediated ERK activation upon depolarization , dnKinases were ex - pressed . The dnCaMKI completely suppressed ERK2 activation whereas dnAKT / PKB or nuclear - targeted dnCaMKIV , other substrates for CaMKK , were not in - hibitory . ERK activation upon depolarization or trans - fection with constitutively active ( ca ) CaMKI was blocked by dnRas . Additionally , depolarization of NG108 cells promoted neurite outgrowth , and this ef - fect was blocked by inhibition of either CaMKK ( STO - 609 ) or ERK ( UO126 ) . Co - transfection with caCaMKK plus caCaMKI also stimulated neurite outgrowth that was blocked by inhibition of ERK ( UO126 ) . These data are the first to suggest that ERK activation and neurite outgrowth in response to depolarization are mediated by CaMKK activation of CaMKI . One of the most ubiquitous cellular signaling mechanisms is the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 pathway . ERKs belong to the MAP kinase family of which ERK1 / 2 is most closely related to the c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and the stress - activated kinase , p38 ( 1 ) . ERK activation plays a role , largely through regulation of gene transcription , in a number of cellular processes including cellular proliferation , DNA synthesis , differentiation , and cellular survival ( 2 – 6 ) . In neurons , ERKs also regulate neurite outgrowth , dendritic mor - phology , and are required for synaptic plasticity in long - term potentiation and in temporal and spatial memory ( 7 – 14 ) . The ERK family is activated by a myriad of extracellular ligands including hormones , neurotransmitters , and growth factors acting through G protein - coupled receptors , tyrosine kinase receptors , and ligand - or voltage - gated ion channels ( 15 , 16 ) . These membrane receptors and channels stimulate the Ras / Rap family of small G proteins that in turn trigger a complex cascade of protein kinases terminating in activation of the MAP kinase family including the ERKs ( 17 – 20 ) . The re - sponse of the ERK pathway to various stimuli can be cell type - specific and / or - dependent on regulation of different sub - cellular pools of small G proteins ( 17 , 18 , 21 ) . Some of these pathways are mediated in part through elevation of intracel - lular calcium , which can play an important role in ERK acti - vation , especially in neurons . For example , KCl depolarization of hippocampal neurons activates ERK , and this is required for regulation of gene transcription ( 5 , 22 ) and for activity - depend - ent dendritic plasticity and filopodial formation ( 8 ) . Several mechanisms for calcium activation of ERK have been reported including pathways through PYK2 , EGF receptor transactivation , RasGRF1 , and CalDAG - GEFs ( 23 , 24 ) . The family of CaM kinases ( Ks ) , which are activated by stimuli that elevate intracellular calcium , have also been proposed to mod - ulate ERK activation ( 8 , 23 ) . For example , in vitro CaMKII can activate SynGAP ( 25 ) , a Ras inhibitory GTPase expressed in neurons ( 26 ) , which may inhibit ERK activation , although a regulatory role for CaMKII in the SynGAP pathway has not been demonstrated in cells . In fact , ERK activation by N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor stimulation is normal in SynGAP heterozygous knockout mice ( 27 ) . In thyroid cancer cells , CaMKII may associate with Raf - 1 and phosphorylate it down - stream of integrin signaling , thereby contributing to ERK activation ( 28 ) . In addition to CaMKII , members of the CaMK cascade may also be involved in ERK activation . The CaMK cascade consists of CaMKK and its downstream substrates CaMKI , CaMKIV , and AKT / PKB ( 29 , 30 ) . CaMKI is predominantly cytoplasmic , but its physiological functions are largely undefined ( 31 ) . CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear , where it phosphorylates transcription factors and regulates gene transcription ( 32 , 33 ) . Glutamate and KCl depolarization persistently activate CaMKI in hippocampal neurons whereas CaMKIV activation is transient ( 34 ) . AKT / PKB is activated by CaMKK , and this pathway protects NG108 cells from apoptosis ( 35 ) . Expression of constitutively active ( ca ) CaMKK or CaMKIV has been pro - posed to activate ERK and JNK in PC12 cells ( 36 ) .

It was recently reported that neither CaMKII nor CaMKIV are sufficient to activate ERK - dependent transcription in NG108 cells ( 37 ) . Interestingly , expression of either nuclear or cytoplasmic CaMKII is unable to activate ERK , and nu - clear CaMKII inhibited neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( 38 ) . Thus , the requirement for specific CaMK family members that may mediate calcium effects on ERK remains to be elucidated . Therefore , we have carefully evaluated the roles of CaMKs in ERK activation using more specific molecular and pharmacological inhibitors to determine the physiologic significance of this pathway in neurite outgrowth upon cel - lular depolarization .

Cell Culture and Treatments— The hybrid neuroblastoma cell line , NG108 , was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) plus 1 % HT selection supplement ( Invitro - gen ) , 10 % fetal calf serum , penicillin / streptomycin , and L - glutamine at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . NG108 cells were serum - starved overnight in DMEM at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 prior to stimulation with the indicated reagents for Western blotting or immunoprecipitation . Cells were pretreated with the inhibitors KN - 93 ( 5 (cid:1) M ) , KN - 92 ( 5 (cid:1) M ) , UO126 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) , H89 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) , and antennapedia ( Ant ) - CaM KIINtide ( 5 (cid:1) M ) for 30 min prior to depolarization , unless otherwise indicated .

Cells were stimulated with KCl ( 60 m M ) to elevate intra - cellular calcium by isotonic depolarization for the indicated times . Sterile - filtered 60 m M isotonic medium consisted of 70 m M NaCl , 60 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 2 m M CaCl 2 , 25 m M HEPES - HCl , and 30 m M D - glucose with an osmolality of (cid:2) 330 . To measure neurite outgrowth , NG108 cells were seeded at low density ( (cid:2) 5 , 000 cells / well ) on cover slips in 24 - well plates with DMEM plus 1 % HT selection supplement , 10 % fetal calf serum , penicillin / streptomycin , and L - glutamine at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . After the cells adhered to the plates , the cells were placed in DMEM plus 1 % HT selection supplement , 1 % fetal calf serum , penicillin / streptomycin , and L - glutamine at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 , and then treated with KCl ( 60 m M ) for 5 days to induce differentiation as previously reported ( 12 , 39 , 40 ) . NG108 cells were pretreated with STO - 609 ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) or U0126 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) for 1 h and 30 min , respectively , prior to and for the duration of depolarization with KCl . NG108 cells were fixed and analyzed for neurite outgrowth as indicated under “Immunocytochemistry” below . To measure neurite outgrowth in transfected cells , NG108 cells were seeded on cover slips in 24 - well plates with DMEM plus 1 % HT selec - tion supplement , 1 % fetal calf serum , penicillin / streptomycin , and L - glutamine at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . 40 – 50 % confluent cells were co - trans - fected with EGFP , along with the control vector pcDNA3 , or constitutively active CaMKK and KI - tagged with EGFP using Lipo - fectAMINE 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s guide - lines . Each plate received the same amount of DNA . Following trans - fection , cells were maintained in DMEM plus 1 % HT selection supplement , 1 % fetal calf serum , penicillin / streptomycin , and L - gluta - mine at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 48 h . Cells were treated with U0126 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) for the duration of the experiment . NG108 cells were fixed , and GFP - positive cells were analyzed for neurite outgrowth by confocal microscopy . Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation— Following NG108 cell stimulations , medium was aspirated , and equivalent amounts of ice - cold lysis buffer ( 10 % glycerol , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 200 m M NaCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 ) plus freshly added inhibitors ( 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 2 (cid:1) g / ml aprotinin , 1 (cid:1) g / ml leupeptin , 10 (cid:1) g / ml trypsin inhibitor , 1 m M sodium orthovanadate ) were added to each plate of cells . On ice , plates were scraped and cellular proteins placed in ice - cold microcentrifuge tubes . Briefly , cell lysates were spun at 8 , 000 for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cytoskeleton and nuclei . Equiv - alent amounts of supernatants from each tube were then quantified by the Bradford protein assay on a 96 - well plate , and standards and sample protein concentrations were read by a microplate reader ( (cid:1) Quant , BIO - TEK INSTRUMENTS , Inc . ) . Equivalent amounts of pro - tein were resolved by SDS - PAGE , blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes , and examined by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies . Unless otherwise indicated , Western blotting for total ERK2 , CaMKII , and CaMKI served as additional loading controls . Equal amounts of cell lysates per treatment condition were used for immunoprecipitations of FLAG - ERK2 . Immunoprecipitations were car - ried out at 4 °C for 4 h inice - cold lysis buffer . Precipitated proteins were washed 2 (cid:3) with lysis buffer , resolved by SDS - PAGE , and Western - blotted for phosphorylated FLAG - ERK2 ( pFLAG - ERK2 ) . FLAG West - ern blotting for FLAG - ERK2 was performed on lysates to serve as a loading and transfection control . For quantitation of Western blots , autoradiographs were scanned and densitized using Kodak ID 3 . 0 . 2 system software ( New Haven , CT ) . Band densities were normalized to untreated controls and then to the loading control and presented as fold phosphorylation as indicated . Statistics— To determine whether significant differences existed among treatments , an analysis of variance was performed on the data with significance set at 0 . 05 . To compare whether significant differ - ences existed between two treatments a Student’s t test was performed on the data with significance set at 0 . 05 . Significance levels ( p value ) are indicated in the figures : a single asterisk indicates p (cid:2) 0 . 05 and a double asterisk indicates p (cid:2) 0 . 01 . Immunocytochemistry— NG108 cells were fixed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde , 4 % sucrose , phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and 50 m M HEPES pH 7 . 5 . at 37 °C for 15 min . Cells were then washed three times for 5 min in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min . Cells were then washed three times for 5 min in PBS , stained with phalloidin ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) and Hoechst 33342 ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature , and washed three times for 5 min in PBS . Coverslips were then mounted on glass slides and analyzed by either fluorescence or confocal microscopy . Plasmids and Transfections— The caCaMKK has previously been published ( 35 ) . The caCaMKI ( IHQS286EDDD , F307A ) , EGFP - tagged caCaMKI , and caCaMKIV ( R136A , HMDT305DEDD ) with a nuclear localization signal were generated in the Soderling laboratory . EGFP - tagged caCaMKI was constructed using the pEGFP vector ( Clontech ) . The dnCaMKK ( K71A , T108A , S458A ) , dnCaMKI ( K49E , T177A , IHQS286EDDD , F307A ) , and dnCaMKIV nuclear ( T196A , K71E , HMDT305DEDD ) plasmids were all generated in the Soderling labora - tory . The CaMKK (cid:3) L233F plasmid was provided by Dr . Hiroshi To - kumitsu ( Kagawa Medical University , Kagawa , Japan ) . The FLAG - ERK2 and RasN17 plasmids were provided by Dr . Philip Stork ( Vollum Institute , Portland , OR ) . 70 – 80 % confluent cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 , along with the control vector pcDNA3 , or the indi - cated plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufac - turer’s guidelines . Each plate received the same amount of DNA , and following transfection cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for 28 h . Cells were then serum - starved overnight , treated as indicated , and lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer . FLAG - ERK2 was then immunopre - cipitated and examined by Western blot for activation ( pFLAG - ERK2 ) . RESULTS Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent ERK Activation in NG108 Neuroblastoma Cells— To investigate the potential role of CaMKs in modulat - ing Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent ERK activation , we selected the NG108 neuroblastoma cell line that can be stimulated by depolariza - tion to raise intracellular calcium levels ( 41 , 42 ) . Depolariza - tion of neuronal cells is known to produce activation of CaMKII ( 43 ) and CaMKK ( 35 ) as well as ERK ( 5 , 44 ) . Several different stimulation paradigms that involve activation of ERK ( 45 , 46 ) or CaMKs ( 47 ) regulate neurite outgrowth of NG108 cells , thereby providing a useful biochemical and physiological indi - cator of potential “cross - talk” between CaMKs and ERK . Depolarization of NG108 cells with KCl resulted in robust ERK activation that was evident within 1 min ( Fig . 2 A ) and maintained at both 20 and 60 min ( Fig . 1 A ) . In general , we have focused on the sustained activation of ERK ( 20 and 60 min . ) rather than its rapid stimulation ( 1 – 5 min ) because sus - tained activation appears to be important for physiological phenomena such as gene transcription and neurite outgrowth ( 5 , 8 , 48 , 49 ) . As expected , inhibition of MEK , the upstream activator of ERK , by UO126 ( 50 ) completely blocked ERK ac - tivation ( Fig . 1 A ) , as did transfection with the dominant - neg - ative Ras , RasN17 ( co - transfected with FLAG - tagged ERK2 , Fig . 1 B ) . In some cell types , elevation of intracellular calcium activates adenylyl cyclase to elevate cAMP , and depending on the cell type , cAMP can activate ERK through PKA ( 20 ) . How - ever , pretreatment of NG108 cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) did not block ERK activation in NG108 cells but did inhibit ERK activation in hippocampal neurons ( data not shown ) . Thus , depolarization of NG108 cells activates ERK through a signaling cascade involving Ras and MEK but not PKA . CaMKII Does Not Mediate ERK Activation— NG108 cells contain endogenous CaMKI , CaMKII , and CaMKIV as well as CaMKK ( Fig . 1 C ) , the upstream activating kinase for CaMKI and CaMKIV . Therefore , NG108 cells are a useful tool for examining which CaMKs may mediate ERK activation by de - polarization . The potential role of CaMKs in depolarization - dependent ERK activation was initially investigated using a general pharmacological CaMK inhibitor , KN - 93 . KN - 93 ( and KN - 62 ) are known to inhibit binding of Ca 2 (cid:4) / CaM to CaMKs , thereby blocking their activation ( 51 ) . Depolarization of NG108 cells resulted in an (cid:2) 4 – 5 - fold increase in ERK activation at 20 and 60 min that was significantly blocked by KN - 93 but not by its inactive analog KN - 92 ( Fig . 1 D ) . The ineffectiveness of the inactive analog KN - 92 suggests that KN - 93 inhibition may be specific for the CaMK family . To assure that KN - 93 was not acting indirectly ( e . g . to inhibit voltage - dependent Ca 2 (cid:4) chan - nels ) , we used ionomycin to elevate Ca 2 (cid:4) and activate ERK , and this was also significantly blocked by KN - 93 but not KN - 92 ( Fig . 1 E ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that ERK activation requires CaMKs in response to elevation of intracel - lular calcium . Previous studies have confirmed that depolarization of NG108 cells results in activation of the two major classes of F IG . 1 . Activation of ERK by depo - larization requires Ras , MEK , and CaM kinases . A , ERK activation re - quires MEK . NG108 cells received no pre - treatment or were pretreated ( 20 min ) with UO126 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) and then stimulated with KCl ( 60 m M ) for the indicated times . Endogenous ERK activation was meas - ured in cell lysates ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) by Western blotting for phosphorylated - ERK1 / ERK2 , p44 , and p42 , respectively ( pERK1 / 2 ) . The lower panel is a Western blot of total ERK2 . B , ERK activation requires Ras . NG108 cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 along with the control vector pcDNA3 or RasN17 . Cells were stimulated with KCl for 20 min , and FLAG - ERK2 phosphoryl - ation was analyzed ( see “Experimental Procedures , ” n (cid:1) 4 , (cid:5) S . E . ; * , p (cid:2) 0 . 05 ) . C , expression profile of endogenous CaM ki - nases in NG108 cells . Endogenous CaMKI , CaMKII , CaMKK , and CaMKIV proteins were examined in cell lysates by Western blotting for the indicated pro - teins . D , ERK activation is blocked by the general CaMK inhibitor KN - 93 but not the inactive analog KN - 92 . NG108 cells , with or without KN - 93 ( 5 (cid:1) M ) or KN - 92 ( 5 (cid:1) M ) pretreatment for 30 min , were stim - ulated with KCl for the indicated times . Endogenous ERK activation was meas - ured by Western blotting as in A , and the density of the bands were determined , normalized for total ERK2 , and quanti - fied for fold - stimulation relative to the control in the absence of KCl ( n (cid:1) 4 , (cid:5) S . E . ) . E , ERK activation by ionomycin is CaM kinase - dependent . NG108 cells re - ceived no pretreatment or were pre - treated with KN - 93 or KN - 92 as in D , stimulated with ionomycin ( 500 n M ) for 20 min and endogenous ERK activation was quantified as in D ( n (cid:1) 3 , (cid:5) S . D . ; * * , p (cid:2) 0 . 01 ) . general CaMKs , CaMKII ( 52 ) and CaMKK ( 35 ) . CaMKII is the best known multifunctional CaMK that mediates many cellu - lar responses from Ca 2 (cid:4) / CaM ( 43 , 53 ) . Therefore , we wanted to specifically block CaMKII to assess its role in mediating Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent activation of ERK . CaMKII is rapidly activated within 1 min upon depolarization of NG108 cells ( Fig . 2 A , lower panel ) and returns to basal levels by 5 – 10 min ( data not shown ) . CaMKIIN is an endogenous brain protein that specif - ically inhibits CaMKII with an IC 50 of 0 . 1 (cid:1) M whereas at 10 (cid:1) M it exhibits little or no inhibition of CaMKI , CaMKIV , CaMKK , PKA , or protein kinase C ( 54 ) . CaM KIINtide , a 27 - residue peptide derived from CaMKIIN , retains the potency and spec - ificity of CaMKIIN , and we have also determined that in vitro it does not directly inhibit ERK ( data not shown ) . CaM KIIN - tide can be made cell - permeable by attachment of an Ant se - quence ( 55 ) . Incubation of NG108 cells with 5 (cid:1) M Ant - CaM KIINtide effectively blocks activation of CaMKII upon depolar - ization , but has little effect on ERK activation at 1 min ( Fig . 2 A ) or 20 min ( data not shown ) . Ant - CaM KIINtide also had no effect on activation of CaMKI by CaMKK ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results suggest that ERK activation by calcium is CaMKII - independent in NG108 cells . CaMKK Is Required for ERK Activation by Depolarization— CaMKK is the upstream activator of the two other multifunc - F IG . 2 . ERK activation requires CaMKK . A , ERK activation by depolarization is CaMKII - independent . NG108 cells received no pretreatment or were incubated for 30 min with the cell - permeable CaMKII inhibitor Ant - KIINtide ( 5 (cid:1) M ) , stimulated with KCl for 1 min , and endogenous ERK activation ( pERK1 / 2 , panel 1 ) or CaMKII ( pCaMKII , panel 3 ) were measured . The second and fourth panels are loading controls showing total ERK2 and CaMKII , respectively . B and C , ERK activation requires CaMKK . NG108 cells , without or with pretreatment for 60 min with STO - 609 ( 2 . 6 (cid:1) M or as indicated ) , were depolarized for the indicated times . Endogenous CaMKI activation by CaMKK ( B ) was measured by Western blotting for phosphorylated CaMKI ( pCaMKI ) . C illustrates the dose - response of inhibition by STO - 609 for endogenous ERK activation upon depolarization as measured in Fig . 1 ( n (cid:1) 3 , (cid:5) S . D . ; 26 (cid:1) M , n (cid:1) 6 , (cid:5) S . E . ) . D , time course of ERK activation . NG108 cells , without or with pretreatment with STO - 609 ( 2 . 6 (cid:1) M , 60 min ) , were depolarized for the indicated times , and activation of endogenous ERK and AKT ( another CaMKK substrate ) were measured ( pERK1 / 2 and pAKT , respectively ) . The two bottom panels are Western blots of ERK2 , demonstrating equal loading of proteins . E , CaMKK (cid:3) L233F reverses STO - 609 inhibition of ERK activation . NG108 cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 along with the control vector pcDNA3 or the CaMKK L233F ( STO - 609 insensitive mutant ) plasmid and pretreated with STO - 609 as indicated . Cells were then stimulated with KCl for 20 min , and FLAG - ERK2 phosphorylation was analyzed ( n (cid:1) 7 , (cid:5) S . E . ) . tional CaMKs , CaMKI and CaMKIV ( 29 , 30 ) . Inhibition of CaMKK was achieved using a recently described inhibitor STO - 609 ( 56 ) . In vitro this compound has an IC 50 of 0 . 26 (cid:1) M ( 0 . 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) for CaMKK and 26 (cid:1) M for CaMKII with little or no inhibition of CaMKI , CaMKIV , PKA , protein kinase C , or ERK . At a concentration of 2 . 6 (cid:1) M it inhibits CaMKK but not CaMKII in cultured hippocampal neurons ( 57 ) . CaMKK activates CaMKI , through phosphorylation of Thr - 177 ( 58 ) , and depolar - ization of NG108 cells for 5 and 20 min resulted in CaMKI phosphorylation at this site that was completely blocked by 2 . 6 (cid:1) M STO - 609 ( Fig . 2 B ) . These data confirm the efficacy of STO - 609 to block CaMKK activity . We next wanted to determine if inhibition of the CaMK cascade would effect ERK activation . Fig . 2 C shows a STO - 609 dose - response curve , and ERK activation was completely blocked by 2 . 6 (cid:1) M , the same concentration that inhibited CaMKK activation of CaMKI . Interestingly , the inhibitory con - centration of STO - 609 on ERK activation by depolarization was nearly 0 . 26 (cid:1) M , which is similar to the IC 50 for CaMKK ( 56 ) . Since STO - 609 up to 26 (cid:1) M has no effect on ERK in vitro , it is likely that STO - 609 was blocking ERK activation by inhibiting CaMKK . The effect of 2 . 6 (cid:1) M STO - 609 was further character - ized in Fig . 2 D , which shows a time course of ERK activation out to 2 h ( top panel ) ; STO - 609 completely blocked ERK acti - vation at all time points examined ( second panel ) . We have previously shown , both in vitro and in NG108 cells , that the protein kinase AKT / PKB is also a direct substrate of CaMKK ( 35 ) . CaMKK activation of AKT / PKB upon depolarization was maximal at about 60 min . whereas activation of CaMKIV oc - curred within 1 – 5 min . Fig . 2 D ( third panel ) confirms the slow activation of AKT upon depolarization , and this response was also suppressed by STO - 609 ( fourth panel ) to below basal ( i . e . no depolarization ) levels . With pharmacological compounds a concern is that the mol - ecule modulates not only the protein of interest , but it may also have other effects . To confirm the specificity of STO - 609 toward CaMKK in our system , we used a point mutant of CaMKK that is insensitive to STO - 609 , CaMKK L233F ( 59 ) . NG108 cells were transfected with FLAG - tagged ERK2 without or with co - trans - fection with CaMKK L233F . In the absence of STO - 609 , CaMKK L233F had no effect on ERK with or without depolariza - tion ( Fig . 2 E ) . However , STO - 609 strongly suppressed activa - tion of ERK upon depolarization , and this inhibition was res - cued by expression of CaMKK L233F ( Fig . 2 E ) . Taken together , these data strongly suggest that activation of ERK upon depo - larization proceeds primarily through CaMKK in NG108 cells . To examine whether STO - 609 blocks ERK activation in re - sponse to other stimulation paradigms , we treated NG108 cells with EGF or the muscarinic receptor agonist , carbachol . De - pending on the cell type , both of these agonists can activate multiple signaling pathways including elevation of intracellu - lar Ca 2 (cid:4) from external or internal stores . As can be seen in Fig . 3 A , depolarization , EGF , and carbachol all activated ERK in NG108 cells , but only ERK activation through depolarization was blocked by STO - 609 . As a control for calcium influx and STO - 609 specificity , we also examined the ability of KCl , EGF , and carbachol to activate CaMKII . Activation of CaMKII was maximal at 1 min and rapidly declined to near basal levels within 5 – 10 min . As illustrated in Fig . 3 B , all treatments activated CaMKII , and this activation was insensitive to STO - 609 . These data confirm the specificity of STO - 609 for inhibit - ing CaMKK but not CaMKII , and for blocking ERK activation in response to depolarization but not EGF or carbachol stimu - lation in NG108 cells . ERK activation by EGF and carbachol are presumably mediated by signaling pathways not involving CaMKK and perhaps even independently of Ca 2 (cid:4) . In addition , since CaMKII activation occurred in the presence of STO - 609 , this indicates that Ca 2 (cid:4) influx in response to depolarization is not blocked by STO - 609 . Involvement of CaMKI , but Not CaMKIV or AKT / PKB , in ERK Activation— The above data strongly implicate a major role for CaMKK in ERK activation upon depolarization of NG108 cells . The two major known targets of CaMKK are CaMKI and CaMKIV . AKT / PKB is a relatively weak substrate for CaMKK and does not exhibit significant CaMKK - mediated activation upon depolarization in NG108 cells until (cid:2) 30 – 40 min . ( Fig . 2 C ) . Since CaMKK - mediated activation of ERK oc - curs by 5 min or less ( Figs . 2 A and 3 B ) , AKT / PKB is an unlikely intermediate candidate to activate ERK . Furthermore , dnAKT / PKB had no inhibitory effect on ERK activation ( data not shown ) . We have previously shown that expression of constitutively active CaMKIV in PC12 cells results in activation of ERK ( 36 ) , but more recent studies have shown that some expressed CaMKIV constructs , especially dominant - negatives ( 60 ) , are not properly localized to the nucleus , like the endogenous CaMKIV , unless a nuclear localization signal is provided ( 57 ) . Therefore , to determine which CaMK may be responsible for CaMKK - mediated activation of ERK , NG108 cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 along with dnCaMKI and dnCaMKIV constructs , and ERK activation was examined . De - polarization resulted in 3 – 5 - fold activation of transfected FLAG - ERK2 at both 20 and 60 min ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) , and this was largely to completely inhibited by dnCaMKI or dnCaMKK . The dnCaMKIV with a nuclear localization signal did not sig - nificantly suppress ERK activation at 20 or 60 min , although it did block N - methyl - D - aspartate - stimulated CREB - mediated transcription in hippocampal neurons ( 57 ) . These results con - firm an obligatory role for CaMKK in depolarization - mediated activation of ERK in these cells and strongly implicate CaMKK acting through CaMKI but not CaMKIV or AKT / PKB . More - over , caKK and caKI , but not nuclear localized caCaMKIV , significantly increased ERK activation ( Fig . 4 C ) . The ability of F IG . 3 . Depolarization , but not EGF or carbachol , activation of ERK depends on CaMKK . A , STO - 609 specifically blocks KCl activa - tion of ERK . NG108 cells , with or without STO - 609 pretreatment ( 2 . 6 (cid:1) M , 60 min ) , were stimulated with KCl , EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) , or carbachol ( 10 (cid:1) M ) for the indicated times , and endogenous ERK activation was measured ( pERK1 / 2 ) . B , STO - 609 does not block CaMKII activation . NG108 cells were treated identically to A for 1 min and analyzed for pERK1 / 2 and pCaMKII as well as total ERK2 and CaMKII . caCaMKI to activate ERK was blocked by RasN17 , suggesting that CaMKI activates ERK through Ras in NG108 cells ( Fig . 4 D ) , similar to ERK activation upon depolarization ( Fig . 1 B ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that CaMKK and CaMKI are both necessary and sufficient for ERK activation in NG108 cells . To investigate whether CaMKK may also be important for calcium signaling to other MAP kinase family members , we analyzed JNK and p38 activation in NG108 cells treated with STO - 609 . Depolarization robustly activated both endogenous ERK and JNK at 20 and 60 min ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Similar to ERK , JNK activation by depolarization was completely blocked by STO - 609 at both time points . Although depolarization may have slightly activated p38 at 20 min , an effect that was re - duced by STO - 609 , at 60 min there was no apparent activation ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Thus , it appears that activation of both ERK and JNK by depolarization is mediated by CaMKK . The acti - vation of p38 was too weak to assess the role of CaMKK in its activation . CaMKK / CaMKI Regulate Neurite Outgrowth through ERK— To examine the physiologic significance of ERK activation by CaMKK in response to depolarization , we analyzed neurite outgrowth stimulated by depolarization in NG108 cells . A neu - rite was defined as a thin protrusion from the cell soma extend - ing at least one cell diameter in length . Only 5 % of NG108 cells generated neurites while maintained in low serum for 5 days ( Fig . 6 , A , upper left and B ) . Depolarization is known to stim - ulate neurite extension in NG108 cells ( 12 , 40 ) , and in our experiments (cid:2) 60 % of cells displayed neurites under these con - ditions ( Fig . 6 , A , upper right and B ) . Importantly , the stimu - lation of neurite production upon depolarization was com - pletely blocked by inhibition of either CaMKK ( STO - 609 , Fig . 6 , A , lower left and B ) or ERK ( UO126 , Fig . 6 , A , lower right and B ) . STO - 609 and UO126 treatments did not affect basal levels of neurite outgrowth of cells maintained in low serum ( Fig . 6 B ) . As a control for cell viability , NG108 cells were stained with Hoechst to examine nuclear condensation . Treatment of cells with KCl , STO - 609 , or UO126 in low serum did not affect cell viability ( data not shown ) . To determine whether ERK is downstream of CaMKK in mediating neurite outgrowth , cells were transfected with ca - CaMKK and EGFP - caCaMKI in the presence or absence of UO126 . About 15 % of NG108 cells transfected with EGFP vector alone generated neurites ( Fig . 7 , A , left and B ) . Cells expressing caCaMKK / KI generated neurites in (cid:2) 85 % of the cells ( Fig . 7 , A , middle and B ) , an effect that was completely blocked by inhibiting ERK ( UO126 , Fig . 7 , A , right and B ) . These results suggest that calcium - evoked neurite outgrowth is mediated by CaMKK and CaMKI acting through MEK and ERK . DISCUSSION A number of pathways exist for how ERK may be regulated by calcium signaling including the modulation of small G pro - teins , phosphatases , and protein kinases ( 23 ) . The present study demonstrates a new pathway , the CaMK cascade of CaMKK / CaMKI , in ERK and JNK activation upon depolariza - tion of NG108 cells . This conclusion is based on the use of STO - 609 , a pharmacological inhibitor of CaMKK , as well as dominant - negative kinases . Importantly , the inhibition of ERK activation by STO - 609 was rescued by transfection with a STO - 609 - insensitive mutant of CaMKK . Although depolarization F IG . 4 . CaMKI mediates activation of ERK by CaMKK . A and B , dnCaMKK and dnCaMKI block KCl activation of ERK . NG108 cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 along with the control vector pcDNA3 or vectors encoding dnCaMKK , dnCaMKI , or dnCaMKIV con - taining a nuclear - localization signal ( dnKIVnuc ) . Cells were stimulated with KCl for 20 ( A ) or 60 min ( B ) , and FLAG - ERK2 phosphorylation was analyzed ( n (cid:1) 6 , (cid:5) S . E . ) . C , caCaMKK and caCaMKI are sufficient to activate ERK . NG108 cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 along with the control vector pcDNA3 or vectors expressing caCaMKK , caCaMKI , or caCaMKIVnuc , and FLAG - ERK2 phos - phorylation was analyzed ( n (cid:1) 6 , (cid:5) S . E . ) . D , CaMKI activation of ERK is Ras - de - pendent . NG108 cells were co - transfected with FLAG - ERK2 along with the control vector pcDNA3 or caCaMKI without or with RasN17 as indicated , and FLAG - ERK2 phosphorylation ( pFLAG - ERK2 ) was analyzed . activated the downstream substrates of CaMKK ( CaMKI , CaMKIV , and AKT / PKB ) , only the dominant - negative con - struct for CaMKI blocked ERK activation , indicating a central function for CaMKI . It is known that CaMKIV is involved in transcriptional regulation , and AKT / PKB activation by CaMKK suppresses apoptosis . The specific inhibitor of CaMKII , CaM KIINtide , did not suppress ERK activation , eliminating a role for this regulatory enzyme . These results provide a cellular function for CaMKI in modulating Ca 2 (cid:4) - de - pendent responses , such as neurite outgrowth , mediated by the ERK / JNK pathways in NG108 cells . ERK activation connects extracellular stimulation to cell growth , proliferation , survival , and differentiation by the acti - vation of small G proteins ( 15 ) . Since ERK activation in NG108 F IG . 5 . Activation of JNK upon de - polarization also requires CaMKK . A and B , KCl activation of JNK is blocked by STO - 609 . NG108 cells , without or with STO - 609 pretreatment ( 2 . 6 (cid:1) M , 60 min ) , were stimulated with KCl for 20 min ( A ) or 60 min ( B ) , and activation of endoge - nous ERK ( pERK1 / 2 ) , JNK ( pJNK ) , and p38 ( phospho - p38 ) was determined . F IG . 6 . Calcium - stimulated neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells requires CaMKK and ERK . A , neurite outgrowth in NG108 cells is CaMKK and ERK - dependent . NG108 cells were plated and grown in 1 % serum without or with 60 m M KCl , to induce neurite formation ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) , in the absence of presence of STO - 609 ( 2 . 6 (cid:1) M ) or UO126 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) for 5 days . Fixed cells were stained with fluores - cein isothiocyanate - phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton , and representative cells are shown in A . Note the presence of neurites induced by KCl ( upper right panel compared with upper left panel ) that are blocked by inhibition of CaMKK ( lower left panel ) or ERK ( lower right panel ) . B , data from three separate experiments are quantified in terms of the percentage of cells with neurites more than 1 cell body in length ( n (cid:1) 3 , (cid:6) 300 cells , (cid:5) S . D . ) . F IG . 7 . Stimulation of neurite outgrowth by caCaMKK plus caCaMKI is mediated by ERK . A , NG108 cells , cultured in the presence of 1 % serum , were transfected with EGFP ( left panels ) or EGFP - tagged constructs of caCaMKK plus caCaMKI without ( middle panels ) or with ( right panels ) treatment of UO126 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) for 2 days . Cells were examined by confocal microscopy for EGFP expression , and representative cells are shown . B , results from six experiments were analyzed in terms of numbers of EGFP - positive cells exhibiting neurites more than one cell body in length ( n (cid:1) 6 , (cid:6) 300 cells , (cid:5) S . E . ) . cells , in response to either depolarization or transfection with caCaMKI , was blocked by dominant - negative RasN17 , this in - dicates that Ras is downstream from CaMKI . ERK activation was not dependent on PKA , so it is likely that the Rap1 / B - Raf pathway is not involved in activating ERK in this system ( 17 , 49 , 61 ) . Active Ras triggers the MAP kinase kinase kinase , Raf - 1 , at the plasma membrane , which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase kinase , MEK ( 16 ) . MEK is a dual specificity serine / threonine kinase that phosphorylates and ac - tivates ERK1 / 2 , and the MEK inhibitor UO126 also suppressed Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent ERK activation in our experiments . Thus , we conclude that Ras and MEK are downstream of CaMKI in the ERK activation pathway . Depolarization of NG108 cells produced a prolonged activa - tion of ERK that persists for at least one hour . In striatal neurons the duration of ERK activation may be regulated by its dephosphorylation catalyzed by the tyrosine phosphatase STEP ( 62 ) . Calcium regulation of STEP appears to function primarily in the prolonged activation of ERK by N - methyl - D - aspartate and glutamate signaling but not depolarization sig - naling pathways . STEP regulation of ERK by KCl depolariza - tion has not been reported in NG108 cells , perhaps accounting in part for the sustained ERK activation we observed . Pro - longed ERK activation in response to depolarization of hip - pocampal neurons is critical to regulation of gene transcription through phosphorylation of transcription factors such as CREB ( 5 , 44 , 63 ) . Rapid phosphorylation of CREB after depolarization may be due to activation of nuclear CaMKIV ( 64 ) , an excellent CREB kinase ( 65 ) . Slow , sustained CREB phosphorylation for up to an hour requires a Ras / MEK pathway that also involves a CaM kinase ( i . e . is blocked by KN - 93 ) ( 44 ) . Based on our results , it is likely that CaMKI mediates this sustained activa - tion of ERK . Our data demonstrate that both AKT and ERK are activated during overlapping time points ( 30 – 60 min ) in NG108 cells . AKT has been proposed to inhibit the Raf - 1 / MEK / ERK path - way in differentiated myotubes ( 66 ) . However , recent studies in neurons would suggest that AKT does not inhibit Raf - 1 - medi - ated signaling and axon outgrowth ( 14 ) . Our data would sug - gest that AKT activation is not inhibiting ERK activation in NG108 cells . Indeed , AKT activation by CaMKK may function in an independent pathway that mediates neuronal survival ( 35 ) , consistent with the data presented here that prolonged depolarization ( i . e . 5 days for neurite outgrowth ) does not stim - ulate apoptosis in NG108 cells . The role of ERK activation in neuronal physiology is very broad and includes neurite outgrowth . NG108 cells are an established model for examining neurite outgrowth by various stimuli ( 11 , 38 , 39 ) . Fibronectin , constitutively active Ras , and angiotensin signals have all been shown to stimulate neurites in NG108 cells in an ERK - dependent manner ( 45 , 46 ) . We show that prolonged treatment of NG108 cells with KCl stimulates neurite outgrowth , and this neuritogenesis is blocked by inhib - itors of CaMKK ( STO - 609 ) or MEK ( U0126 ) . Importantly , neu - rite formation in response to co - transfection with caCaMKK plus caCaMKI is blocked by U0126 . This indicates that CaMKK / KI and MEK are part of the same pathway rather than parallel pathways . A requirement for ERK activation in neu - rite outgrowth has also been reported in PC12 cells ( 67 , 68 ) . In PC12 cells , KCl stimulation of neurite formation has been shown to depend on PKA , Ras , and Rap1 , and it is blocked by ERK inhibitors ( 49 , 69 – 71 ) . In hippocampal neurons , filopodial formation in response to repetitive pulses of KCl requires a prolonged activation of ERK that is blocked by the general CaMK inhibitor KN - 93 ( 8 ) . We speculate that the relevant CaMK in this system may be CaMKI . Prolonged incubation of neurons in KCl also stimulates neurite extension , perhaps through CaMKIV ( 72 ) . In the absence of depolarization , imma - ture neurons also express neurites , one of which becomes the axon , and the remainder develop into dendrites . Recent de - tailed studies in hippocampal neurons have shown that den - dritic arborization depends on (cid:4) CaMKII ( 50 ) whereas CaMKI mediates axonal outgrowth and growth cone motility ( 57 ) . Thus , it appears that various members of the CaMK family regulate different aspects of neurite development . Although CaMKI is a rather ubiquitously expressed kinase and some in vitro substrates ( e . g . synapsin 1 ) are known ( 73 – 75 ) , few in vivo substrates have been identified ( 76 , 77 ) and therefore physiological roles for CaMKI have been largely un - explored . Our results provide a cellular role for CaMKI in regulating the Ca 2 (cid:4) - dependent ERK / JNK pathway . Acknowledgments— We thank Dr . Philip J . S .
