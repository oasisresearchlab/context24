Tools for Innovation This book demonstrates how the latest research in cognitive science can expand our understanding of creating and implementing new ideas , as well as how innovation has been and can be cultivated . It is widely known that innovation is crucial to sustain success in business , government , and engineering . But capturing the effective means of fostering innovation remains elusive . How can organizations actively promote innovation , which arises from a complex combination of cognition and domain expertise ? Researchers across an array of fields are studying innovation , with exciting new findings suggesting that science is beginning to understand how it can be cultivated . It is now more important than ever for seemingly distant fields to share conclusions and , in concert , translate them into viable applications . In this unique and exciting collaboration , engineers , cognitive scientists , psychologists , computer scientists , and marketers explore the practical methods that support innovation and creative design , from different ways of thinking and conceptualizing to computer - based tools . The authors present research on processes as well as on the evaluation of existing methods . Their lessons drawn are at the forefront of the interdisciplinary movement to use science to help organizations thrive .
