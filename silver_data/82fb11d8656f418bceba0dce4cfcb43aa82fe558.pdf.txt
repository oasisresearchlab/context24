In vitro , they enhance elongation of actin ﬁlaments , but at rates differing in nearly an order of magnitude according to species , raising questions about the molecular determinants of rate control . Chimeras from fast and slow elongating VASP proteins were generated and their ability to promote actin polymerization and to bind G - actin was assessed . By in vitro TIRF microscopy as well as thermodynamic and kinetic analyses , we show that the velocity of VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation depends on G - actin recruitment by the WASP homology 2 motif . Comparison of the experimentally observed elongation rates with a quantitative mathematical model moreover revealed that Ena / VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation displays a saturation dependence on the actin monomer concentration , implying that Ena / VASP proteins , independent of species , are fully saturated with actin in vivo and generally act as potent ﬁlament elonga - tors . Moreover , our data showed that spontaneous addition of monomers does not occur during processive VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation on surfaces , suggesting that most ﬁlament formation in cells is actively controlled .

The only proteins known so far that directly enhance ﬁlament elongation by interaction with the growing barbed end and recruitment of monomeric actin for polymerization are formins and Ena / VASP proteins . Ena / VASP family members were previously shown to localize in a protrusion - dependent manner to lamellipodia tips ( Rottner et al , 1999 ) and to inﬂuence the length of actin ﬁlaments as well as their apparent branching density within lamellipodia ( Bear et al , 2002 ) , and Listeria monocytogenes comet tails ( Plastino et al , 2004 ) . Ena / VASP proteins are required for the formation of ﬁlopodia in mammals and Dictyostelium ( Schirenbeck et al , 2006 ; Applewhite et al , 2007 ; Dent et al , 2007 ) and were also shown to enhance the actin - driven propulsion of L . monocytogenes ( Laurent et al , 1999 ; Loisel et al , 1999 ; Geese et al , 2002 ) as well as of beads coated with ActA ( Samarin et al , 2003 ) . Additionally , they are implicated in neuritogenesis and cortex development ( Kwiatkowski et al , 2007 , 2009 ) as well as in tumour development and progres - sion ( Hu et al , 2008 ; Philippar et al , 2008 ) . Ena / VASP proteins display a conserved tripartite architec - ture encompassing an N - terminal Ena / VASP homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain required for subcellular targeting followed by a central proline - rich domain implicated in recruitment of proﬁlin – actin complexes ( Jonckheere et al , 1999 ; Ferron et al , 2007 ) , and a C - terminal EVH2 domain mediating tetramer - ization and interaction with monomeric and ﬁlamentous actin ( Bachmann et al , 1999 ; Hu¨ttelmeier et al , 1999 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . The G - actin - binding site ( GAB ) within the EVH2 domain displays close sequence homologies to WASP homology 2 ( WH2 ) motifs , which are present in many actin regulators ( Supplementary Figure S1 ; Paunola et al , 2002 ; Dominguez , 2007 , 2009 ) . In addition , the adjacent F - actin - binding site ( FAB ) was also proposed to posses WH2 - like properties ( Dominguez , 2007 , 2009 ) . While both Ena / VASP proteins and formins accelerate actin ﬁlament barbed end elongation in vitro , the underlying molecular mechanisms are different ( Faix and Grosse , 2006 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ; Chesarone and Goode , 2009 ; Dominguez , 2010 ) . Formin dimers remain processively asso - ciated with the growing ﬁlament barbed end by virtue of their dimeric FH2 domain while inserting thousands of actin monomers , thereby efﬁciently protecting the ﬁlament from Received : 10 May 2010 ; accepted : 2 December 2010 ; published online : 7 January 2011 * Corresponding author .

Moreover , formin - mediated enhancement of ﬁlament elongation strictly depends on the recruitment of proﬁlin – actin complexes by the adjacent proline - rich FH1 domain ( Chang et al , 1997 ; Sagot et al , 2002 ; Kovar et al , 2006 ) . Surface - immobilized VASP captures growing barbed ends ( Pasic et al , 2008 ) and , when clustered on the surface at sufﬁciently high density , can translocate processively with the growing ﬁlament end ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Unlike formins , proﬁlin appears dispensable for VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation in vitro ( Samarin et al , 2003 ; Schirenbeck et al , 2006 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . A notable property of VASP is the different inﬂuence of CPs when VASP is free in solution or clustered on the surface of a bead . Upon clustering , VASP triggers processive ﬁlament elongation at high concentrations of CP that block VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation in solution ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Collectively , this suggests that clustered VASP tetramers cooperate in tethering and elongating actin ﬁlaments at surfaces , such as on the cell membrane and the surface of pathogens such as L . monocytogenes ( Laurent et al , 1999 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ; Footer et al , 2008 ) . Although the ﬁlament elongation activity of VASP could be attributed to its GAB and FAB motifs , the underlying general mechanisms of VASP - mediated actin assembly remained obscure , as human VASP ( hVASP ) showed a drastically reduced elongating activity in vitro when compared with the orthologue from the highly motile soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum ( DdVASP ) ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . To dissect the molecular mechanism of Ena / VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation , we employed a domain shuf - ﬂing approach , replacing the GAB , FAB and their connecting linker region of hVASP by those of the fast - elongating DdVASP and by WH2 motifs from other actin - binding proteins . Our results allowed us to develop a quantitative mathematical model for an afﬁnity based , WH2 - domain - mediated actin assembly used by Ena / VASP proteins , where - by the ﬁlament elongation rate is correlated to the saturation of the GAB with actin monomers . Results VASP , Mena and EVL enhance ﬁlament elongation to similar extends Previously , it was shown that hVASP only weakly accelerates actin elongation in vitro , whereas the Dictyostelium ortholo - gue DdVASP enhanced the growth of single ﬁlaments about seven - fold ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Mammalian cells express two additional Ena / VASP proteins , referred to as Ena ( enabled ) and EVL ( Ena / VASP like ) , the latter of which is abundantly expressed in migrating neutrophils , suggesting that this particular paralogue might mediate faster ﬁlament elongation than hVASP . In search for the underlying cause of different ﬁlament elongation rates , we compared DdVASP and the three mammalian Ena / VASP proteins on the domain level and found that the lengths of the linkers separating the GAB and FAB motifs in hVASP , EVL , Mena and DdVASP differ considerably , encompassing 18 , 25 , 33 and 40 residues , respectively ( Figure 1A and B ) . Recently , it was shown that the length of the linkers separating the three WH2 motifs in the protein Cobl was critical for its actin nucleation activity ( Ahuja et al , 2007 ) . Since models of VASP - mediated actin assembly propose that a GAB - bound actin monomer is handed over directly to the barbed end of the FAB - bound ﬁlament ( Ferron et al , 2007 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ; Dickinson , 2009 ) , we assumed that the short 18 residues linker of hVASP might impair this transfer and hence cause the lower elongation activity compared with DdVASP . Whereas the GAB and FAB of DdVASP differ substantially from the mammalian Ena / VASP proteins , the sequences of GAB and FAB motifs of the latter are almost identical ( Figure 1A and B ; Supplementary Figure S1 ) . This suggests that mammalian Ena / VASP proteins display comparable actin - binding properties , in turn making them well - suited candidates to investigate the effects of the linker lengths on the ﬁlament elongation rate . We employed TIRF microscopy to quantify the effects of puriﬁed Ena / VASP isoforms on single actin - ﬁlament elonga - tion in vitro . Control actin ﬁlaments grew spontaneously from 1 . 3 m M G - actin ( 30 % OG labelled ) , with an average rate of 10 . 5subunits s (cid:2) 1 ( sub s (cid:2) 1 ) in our assays . Similar to hVASP , the EVH2 domain from Mena and full - length EVL - bundled actin ﬁlaments and enhanced their elongation rate , both in solution and when clustered on beads in the presence of CP ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) . However , Mena and EVL again only slightly increased the elongation rate of actin ﬁlaments by B 1 . 5 - fold like hVASP ( Figure 1C and D ) . Thus , despite different linkers , all three mammalian Ena / VASP paralogues possess low actin - ﬁlament elongation activities and mediate considerably slower elongation rates when compared with DdVASP in vitro ( Figure 1E ) . Domain shufﬂing of GAB and FAB motifs reveals the molecular requirement for fast ﬁlament elongation Replacement of the GAB and FAB from hVASP ( hGAB and hFAB ) by the corresponding motifs from DdVASP ( DdGAB and DdFAB ) ( Figure 2A ) allowed hVASP to assemble actin ﬁlaments with signiﬁcantly higher elongation rates when compared to the wild - type protein . Chimera hVASP DdGABFAB mediated virtually the same elongation rates as DdVASP , both in solution and when clustered on beads , enhancing ﬁlament elongation rates up to B 70subs (cid:2) 1 ( Figure 2B – D ; Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 ) . Almost identical results were obtained with hVASP DdGAB - L - FAB , additionally containing the entire linker region ( L ) of DdVASP , corroborating our previous ﬁnding that the linker region does not affect ﬁlament elongation ( Figure 2C ) . Most notably , chimera hVASP DdGAB already enhanced the ﬁla - ment elongation rate up to 41 subs (cid:2) 1 in solution and up to 49subs (cid:2) 1 on saturated beads , respectively , pointing towards a key role of actin monomer recruitment during VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation ( Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 ) . In contrast , chimera hVASP DdFAB mediated only a moderate acceleration of the elongation rate up to 23 . 2 subs (cid:2) 1 in solution and 19 . 2subs (cid:2) 1 on beads when compared with hVASP , suggesting that the contribution of the FAB motif to ﬁlament elongation is smaller than that of the GAB motif ( Figure 2B – D ; Supplementary Movie 4 ) . The differential enhancement of the ﬁlament elongation rate by the VASP chimeras was conﬁrmed by seeded pyrene actin polymerization assays ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 457 The GAB has a pivotal role in specifying Ena / VASP elongation properties Since the transplantation of the DdGAB motif into the hVASP backbone was already sufﬁcient to enhance actin - ﬁlament elongation 4 – 5 - fold , we hypothesized that GAB - mediated actin monomer recruitment determines the ﬁlament elonga - tion rates driven by Ena / VASP proteins . Therefore , we sought to analyse the afﬁnities of DdGAB and hGAB peptides for G - actin under buffer conditions that were used in the TIRF experiments . Binding of GAB peptides to OG - actin monomers caused a 10 – 20 % increase in OG - ﬂuorescence , which was instrumental to detect the formation of GAB – actin complexes by ﬂuorescence titrations . Determination of the equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) for DdGAB and hGAB peptides to latrunculin - A ( LatA ) sequestered Mg 2 þ – ATP – actin in the presence of 50mM KCl showed that their afﬁnities towards G - actin differed by as much as B 20 - fold , yielding K D values of 0 . 63 and 10 . 3 m M , respectively ( Figure 3A – C ) . Concomitant binding of LatA to actin had virtually no effect on the GAB – actin interaction ( Figure 3C ) . Competition experiments with OG labelled and unlabelled actin in G - buffer revealed that both the DdGAB and hGAB peptides bound B 1 . 7 – 2 - fold stronger to OG - actin than to unlabelled actin ( data not shown ) . The K D value determined for the DdEVH2 – actin interaction was virtually identical to the K D value obtained for the DdGAB peptide , showing that the monomer afﬁnity of the GAB motif is not changed within the VASP tetramer ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . In addition to the equilibrium constants , we analysed the kinetics of actin monomer binding to the EVH2 domains of hVASP and DdVASP by stopped - ﬂow analysis , yielding k on values of 53 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 for the DdEVH2 domain and signiﬁcantly lower rates of B 12 – 18 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 for the hEVH2 domain , respectively ( Figure 3D ) . As expected , the DdGAB peptide inhibited actin - ﬁlament nucleation in pyrene assays according to its relatively high afﬁnity to monomers , but did not noticeably sequester actin monomers even at a high molar excess ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) , indicating that binding of the GAB to monomers does not interfere with ﬁlament elongation . This ﬁnding is in line with previous results showing that WH2 motifs display proﬁlin - like properties during barbed end assembly , and that they rapidly dissociate from the monomer after its incorporation into the ﬁlament ( Hertzog et al , 2002 , 2004 ) . Collectively , these results let us hypothesize that the faster ﬁlament elongation mediated by DdVASP compared with hVASP is mainly caused by a higher afﬁnity for monomers , resulting in a signiﬁcantly higher saturation of the VASP tetramer at low actin concentra - tions typically used in in vitro polymerization assays . Replacement of the GAB of hVASP by other WH2 motifs reveals a saturation - based mechanism of VASP - mediated actin assembly To further investigate the dependence of the ﬁlament elongation rates on the afﬁnity of the G - actin - binding motif , M a x . e l on ga t i on r a t e ( s ub s – 1 ) h V A S P D d V A S P 0 20 40 60 80 h E V L M ena E V H 2 In solution Clustered on beads Ena / VASP A c t i n E ( Ena / VASP ) ( nM ) E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s – 1 ) hVASP Mena EVH2 hEVL 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 4 8 12 16 20 C MenaEVH2 hEVL hVASP D 0 0 0 150 150 150 300 300 300 GAB ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ FAB F G T EVH1 EVH2 A GAB FAB Linker ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗ ∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗ ∗∗ B Figure 1 Effects of hVASP , Mena and hEVL on actin - ﬁlament elongation .

Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 458 we replaced the GAB in hVASP with foreign WH2 core motifs from WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) , which binds mono - mers with a high afﬁnity in G - buffer ( K D ¼ 0 . 16 m M ) , and the WH2 motif from thymosin b 4 ( T b 4 ) , which displays a much weaker G - actin - afﬁnity ( K D ¼ 3 . 1 m M ) ( Chereau et al , 2005 ) . We found that the afﬁnity of the WIP - WH2 - peptide to Mg 2 þ – ATP – actin in the presence of 50mM KCl was rather high , yielding a K D value of 0 . 84 m M ( Figure 4B ) . Unfortunately , T b 4 binding to OG - actin did not result in a detectable change in ﬂuorescence ( data not shown ) as pre - viously reported for pyrene - or NBD - labelled actin ( Hertzog et al , 2002 ) . Notwithstanding , we noted that the K D value of the interaction of Mg 2 þ – ATP – actin with full - length T b 4 in the presence of 50mM KCl was previously determined to be 1 . 4 m M ( De La Cruz et al , 2000 ) . Assuming that the afﬁnity of the T b 4 – WH2 motif for actin under our polymerization conditions is about a factor 4 lower ( as reported for G - buffer ; Chereau et al , 2005 ) , we estimated the K D for the T b 4 – WH2 – actin interaction to be in the range of B 5 . 6 m M . Based on these different afﬁnities , we tested the ﬁlament elongation properties of chimeras hVASP WIP and hVASP T b 4 . Remarkably , both WH2 chimeras promoted actin assembly in an Ena / VASP - mediated manner , enhancing ﬁlament elongation in solution and processively elongating actin ﬁlaments in the presence of CP when clustered on polystyrene beads ( Figure 4C ; Supplementary Movie 5 ) . As hypothesized , chimera hVASP WIP - mediated fast elongation rates both in solution and on beads ( 32 . 1 and 36 . 3 subs (cid:2) 1 , respectively ) , whereas chimera hVASP T b 4 enhanced ﬁla - ment elongation only moderately to 20 . 1 and 19 . 5subs (cid:2) 1 , respectively ( Figure 4D ) . As shown in Figure 4E , the elonga - tion rates mediated by VASP clustered on beads increased in order of their afﬁnities for actin monomers . Notably , the rates appeared to approach saturation at higher actin concentra - tions , as can be most clearly seen for chimeras hVASP DdGAB and hVASP WIP . Thus , these results let us propose that the elongation rate of processive ﬁlament growth on VASP - satu - rated beads reaches a maximum rate when the available GAB regions are saturated ( actin concentration b K D ) , suggesting that all Ena / VASP proteins are potent ﬁlament elongators at high actin monomer concentrations .

Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 459 model of actin - ﬁlament end - tracking proteins ( Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ; Dickinson et al , 2004 ) , in which processive elongation is achieved by multivalent afﬁnity - modulated interactions between the VASP tetramer and the ﬁlament tip ( Figure 5 ) . At steady state , one VASP subunit of a tetramer binds to the ﬁlament terminal subunit by its GAB , leaving a number ( N ) of free GABs to capture monomers from solution ( concentration C ) with rate constant k on . Captured monomers either dissociate ( at rate constant k off ¼ k on (cid:3) K D ) or are transferred to the tip and irreversibly incorporated with rate constant k t . As shown in the Materials and methods section and Figure 5A , this kinetic model derives the VASP - mediated elongation rate r V to be r V ¼ k t CN C þ K D þ k t = k on ð 1 a Þ In Figure 4E , model predictions show excellent agreement with elongation rates observed on beads saturated with chimeras hVASP WIP , hVASP T b 4 , hVASP DdGAB and hVASP WTover the widest possible range of actin concentra - tions that is applicable to TIRF assays ( 0 . 5 – 4 m M actin ) . Importantly , the model anticipates a saturation of the rate with respect to monomer concentration , which will be achieved when all GAB sites are occupied with actin . All four curves were ﬁtted simultaneously by weighted least - squares regression with only four ﬁtted parameters : the number of GABs N , the transfer rate constant k t , which was shown to have nearly the same value for all hVASP constructs ( Supplementary Figure S5A ) , and the values of k on only for the WIP and T b 4 chimeras ( for ﬁtted values see Figure 4F ) . Interestingly , global ﬁtting of the experimental data yielded N ¼ 3 , suggesting that a single VASP tetramer operates at a ﬁlament tip during ﬁlament elongation . Our model also implies that processive ﬁlament elongation by VASP may not only occur with VASP clustered on beads , but also with soluble VASP tetramers . Consistently , a mono - meric DdVASP mutant was previously shown to be not functional in solution ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Noting that half - maximal elongation rates are already achieved at relatively low tetramer concentrations ( B 25 – 50nM ) , we estimate by assuming an on - rate constant of B 20 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 for VASP binding to the barbed end that a single VASP tetramer might be processively associated with the ﬁlament end for B 1 – 2 s . This would correspond to the incorporation of 70 – 140 subunits , which is in the range of the resolution limit of our TIRF setup ( Supplementary Figure S6 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . A non - processive monomer trans - fer by single VASP tetramers transporting monomers from solution would require an at least one order of magnitude higher on - rate constant . For example , an on - rate constant of tetramer binding to a ﬁlament tip of 300 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 would be required to add monomers at 60s (cid:2) 1 from a 50 - nM solution of VASP tetramers carrying four monomers at a time .

Notably , these calculations were very recently conﬁrmed by experimental data showing short tracks of processive ﬁlament elongation by single VASP tetramers in solution using TIRF microscopy ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . We have previously shown that ﬁlament elongation can be readily inhibited by CP , and that single VASP tetramers are only transiently associated with the barbed end ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Therefore , we hypothesize that monomers are also added spontaneously to the ﬁlament end in a parallel pathway to VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation . For monomer addition from solution , which we refer to as the direct pathway , the elongation rate would then be r d ¼ k f (cid:3) C , where r d is the elongation rate and k f is the rate constant of spontaneous actin monomer addition ( neglecting the disso - ciation rate , which should be negligibly small o 1s (cid:2) 1 for ATP – actin ( Pollard et al , 2000 ) ) . Thus , the total elongation rate observed with VASP in solution is the sum of the VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation rate and the rate resulting from the direct pathway , and hence described by r Vsol ¼ r V þ r d ( Figure 5B ) . We speculate that the direct pathway creates free barbed ends , which in turn are accessible for actin mono - mers , other VASP tetramers or barbed end binding proteins such as CP ( Figure 5B ) . However , when VASP is clustered on surfaces , CP is prevented from binding to barbed ends , suggesting that the direct pathway is largely inhibited under hVASP T β 4 0 400 0 100 100 200 200 300 300 400 hVASP WIP C 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 h VA S P W T W I P T β 4 D d G A B On beads In solution E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s – 1 ) D hVASP chimeras 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 1 2 3 4 5 ( Actin ) ( μ M ) hVASP DdGAB hVASP WIP hVASP T β 4 hVASP K D ( μ M ) k on ( µM – 1 s – 1 ) k off ( s – 1 ) k t ( s – 1 ) = 41±13 A hVASP hVASP DdGAB hVASP WIP hVASP T β 4 N = 3±0 . 6 A 10 . 3 0 . 6 31 . 8 B 13 . 6 B 142 . 2 B 154 . 5 B 0 . 84 5 . 6 * 15 53 16 . 2±2 . 8 A 25 . 4±5 . 5 A * Estimated from ( Cherau et al , 2005 , De La Cruz et al , 2004 ) A Best fit to experimental data F E Beads coated with : E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s – 1 ) B Calculated WIP WH2 Ca 2 + – ATP – actin + LatA + 50 mM KCl 1 . 6 μ M Dissociation constants ( K D ) 0 . 84 μ M Mg 2 + – ATP – actin + LatA + 50mM KCl T β 4 WH2 8 . 4 μ M * 5 . 6 μ M * K D in G - buffer B A 63 nM * 320 nM * 160 nM # 3 . 1 μ M # Figure 4 Analysis of hVASP WH2 chimeras reveals VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation is enhanced by saturable monomer binding to GAB sites .

Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 461 these conditions , probably due to sterical hindrance , allowing ﬁlament elongation exclusively by VASP - mediated monomer delivery ( Figure 5C ) . Consistently , independent ﬁtting of the elongation rates mediated by VASP proteins clustered on beads under consideration of the direct pathway yielded very low k f values between 0 and 0 . 25 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ( Supplementary Figure S5A ) and was almost equally well ﬁtted with k f ¼ 0 ( Figure 4E ) . Moreover , comparison of elongation rates mediated by the slow - elongating hVASP over a range of actin concentrations showed that the rates obtained with hVASP in solution depended much more strongly on the actin monomer concentration when com - pared with the rates on hVASP - coated beads , yielding a rate constant for spontaneous monomer addition of k f ¼ 8 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ( Supplementary Figure S7 ) . Consistently , glo - bal ﬁtting of the data for VASP - coated beads employing this k f value was impossible ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) , support - ing that the direct pathway is inhibited during processive ﬁlament elongation by clustered VASP . Role of the FAB motif in VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation For lower - afﬁnity Ena / VASP proteins , the elongation rate is determined entirely by the actin monomer afﬁnity , the num - ber of monomer binding sites ( N ) , and the transfer rate k t . Since K D and N should be the same for hVASP and hVASP - DdFAB , the higher assembly rate by hVASP - DdFAB could be due to a faster transfer rate k t , perhaps arising from a lower afﬁnity of the DdFAB motif for F - actin . Assuming that the FAB motif determines the afﬁnity of VASP for F - actin and that VASP binds to F - actin in a 1 : 1 ratio ( Bachmann et al , 1999 ; Laurent et al , 1999 ) , we estimated the K D value for the hFAB to be in the range of B 100nM by high speed co - sedimenta - tion assays ( Figure 6A and B ) . DdVASP bound to F - actin with a signiﬁcantly lower afﬁnity , yielding a K D value of about 1 m M ( Figure 6A and B ) . From these values , we estimated that individual DdFAB motifs remain bound to F - actin roughly 20 % of the time during VASP - mediated elongation whereas hFAB motifs spent 40 % of the time on the ﬁlament ( see Supplementary data for calculations ) . Assuming that mono - mer incorporation by the adjacent GAB motif is only possible when the FAB motif is detached , this could account for the higher rates mediated by chimeras bearing the DdFAB relative to those containing the hFAB . The slightly higher elongation rates mediated by Ena / VASP proteins harbouring the DdFAB motif compared with equivalent constructs with the hFAB motif could indeed be ﬁtted with a higher k t value ( Figure 6C ) . This suggests that the FAB modulates ﬁlament Figure 5 Mathematical model of VASP - mediated actin - ﬁlament elongation . ( A ) General mechanism of VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation . AVASP tetramer is attached to the ﬁlament barbed end by at least one EVH2 domain during ﬁlament elongation . The free EVH2 domains recruit actin monomers from solution with an on - rate constant k on , and subsequently either transfer the subunit onto the barbed end with a transfer rate k t or release the actin monomer back into solution with an off - rate k off . This model also assumes that upon binding of the GAB - associated monomer to the barbed end , the already bound GAB is quickly ( or simultaneously ) released from the now penultimate subunit so that it becomes immediately available to capture another monomer . By this cycle , the VASP tetramer is able to processively track the elongating ﬁlament tip while cyclically maintaining one GAB bound to the terminal subunit and three GABs free to capture monomers from solution . ( B ) VASP - mediated actin - ﬁlament elongation in solution . When VASP is free in solution , both , processive association of VASP with the barbed end and spontaneous addition of free actin monomers via the direct pathway with an independent transfer rate constant k f can occur . Free barbed ends produced by the direct pathway are accessible either for other VASP tetramers , actin monomers or , if present , capping proteins . The average elongation rate is therefore the sum of the VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation rate and the rate of the direct pathway . ( C ) VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation on surfaces . Upon clustering , the high density of VASP at the surface leads to processive association of VASP with the ﬁlament end , efﬁciently blocking binding of capping proteins and also preventing spontaneous addition of monomers via the direct pathway . Hence , ﬁlament elongation is exclusively fueled by actin monomers recruited and transferred by VASP . Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 462 elongation depending on its dwell time on the side of the ﬁlament , thus affecting the rate of monomer transfer to the barbed end . Consistently , deletion of the FAB motif from both Mena and VASP resulted in faster propulsion of L . mono - cytogenes in reconstituted MV D7 cells ( Geese et al , 2002 ) , and a DdVASP D FAB mutant mediated slightly higher elongation rates in vitro when compared with the wild - type protein ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Thus , a lower afﬁnity of the FAB for F - actin might not only result in higher elongation rates under in vitro TIRF conditions , but could also enhance the maximal elongation rate of VASP - mediated ﬁlament elonga - tion under saturating conditions ( Figure 6D ) . What is clearly needed to understand the role of the FAB in this process in more detail are structural data of the FAB in complex with the ﬁlament . Discussion Here , we unraveled an afﬁnity - based mechanism by which Ena / VASP proteins differentially enhance actin - ﬁlament elon - gation in solution and on functionalized surfaces , and present a testable mathematical model for Ena / VASP - mediated actin - ﬁlament elongation . The comparison of hVASP chimeras encompassing WH2 motifs with different actin afﬁnities revealed that ﬁlament elongation rates result from direct binding and incorporation of actin monomers by their WH2 - like G - actin - binding motifs , and moreover , that their saturation with G - actin correlates directly with the enhance - ment of the ﬁlament elongation rate . Our results clearly explain the differences in the actin polymerizing activities of Ena / VASP proteins from different species in vitro and demonstrate that Ena / VASP proteins from evolutionary dis - tant organisms employ a common mechanism to promote actin - ﬁlament assembly . In the ‘actoclampin’ model of tethered elongation ( Dickinson et al , 2002 ; Dickinson , 2009 ) , the hypothetical multimeric actoclampin protein mediates ﬁlament elongation by two adjacent actin - binding modules , one processively tracking and tethering the growing ﬁlament end and the other binding and delivering monomeric actin for elongation . Rate - limiting factors for ﬁlament elongation are therefore the translocation speed of the ﬁlament - binding modules at the barbed end , the on - rate of monomer binding , the kinetics of monomer transfer and GAB release from the barbed end or the number of monomers recruited by the monomer - binding modules . This model can in principle be applied to the action 1 10 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 DdVASP hVASP DdGAB hVASP hVASP DdFAB ( Actin ) ( μ M ) D C DdVASP hVASP DdGAB hVASP hVASP DdFAB Contain DdFAB : Contain hFAB : Elongation rate ( sub s – 1 ) E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s – 1 ) Calculated elongation rate ( sub s – 1 ) 19 . 2 ± 3 . 9 65 . 4 ± 6 . 9 11 . 5 ± 3 . 6 59 . 1 ± 7 . 5 70 . 4 14 . 3 11 . 3 58 . 5 k t ( s – 1 ) 40 40 54 54 P S P S P S P S P S P S GST - DdVASP Actin 3 . 6 ( GST - DdVASP ) ( μ M ) 2 . 5 μ M actin 1 . 8 0 . 9 0 . 45 0 . 23 0 . 11 P S P S P S P S P S P S GST - hVASP Actin 2 . 8 ( GST - hVASP ) ( μ M ) 2 . 5 μ M actin 1 . 4 0 . 7 0 . 35 0 . 18 0 . 09 0 1 2 3 4 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 VASP bound / a c t i n t o t a l ( VASP total ) ( μ M ) hVASPDdVASP B A K D 1 μ M K D 100 nM Figure 6 Function of the FAB motif in VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation .

Taking into account that different FAB motifs might alter k t depending on their F - actin afﬁnity , experimental data could be ﬁtted with ﬁxed K D and k on values , yielding a higher k t value for constructs bearing the DdFAB motif ( k t values are highlighted in bold ) .

Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 463 of both , formins and Ena / VASP proteins . However , due to the considerable structural and biochemical differences between their interactions with G - and F - actin , these two protein families employ different molecular mechanisms to enhance ﬁlament elongation ( Kovar et al , 2006 ; Ferron et al , 2007 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ; Chesarone and Goode , 2009 ) : formins processively track the growing barbed end of a ﬁlament by virtue of their dimeric FH2 domains , which , however , have only negligible afﬁnities towards G - actin ( Pring et al , 2003 ; Kovar et al , 2006 ) . Notably , FH2 - assembled actin ﬁlaments grow slower than spontaneously assembled actin ﬁlaments , consistent with a rate - limiting effect of the translocating ﬁlament - binding module on the ﬁlament elon - gation rate in the actoclampin model ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Dickinson , 2009 ; Paul and Pollard , 2009 ) . This inhibi - tory effect of the FH2 domain is quantiﬁed by the ‘gating factor’ , which describes the fraction of time the formin spends in the open state , allowing actin monomer incorpora - tion ( Paul and Pollard , 2009 ) . Impeded ﬁlament elongation by the FH2 domain is compensated by the FH1 domain , which recruits monomers as proﬁlin – actin complexes that are sub - sequently transferred to the FH2 - bound barbed end to en - hance ﬁlament elongation ( Kovar et al , 2006 ) . The elongation rate of formin - mediated actin assembly was accordingly shown to correlate with the number of proﬁlin - binding sites within the FH1 domain , and hence the number of recruited monomers ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . In contrast , Ena / VASP tetramers are composed of small G - and F - actin - binding modules , and are not expected to proces - sively track the barbed end of the ﬁlament in the same way as the dimeric FH2 domain of formins ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ; Dominguez , 2009 ) . Additionally , proﬁlin was shown to be dispensable for VASP - mediated actin assembly in vitro ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ; Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) , sug - gesting that monomer recruitment is achieved directly by its WH2 - like motifs . Since insertion of other WH2 motifs with different G - actin afﬁnities into the hVASP backbone was sufﬁcient to accelerate ﬁlament elongation to different ex - tents according on their G - actin afﬁnity , we propose that direct monomer recruitment is key for rapid Ena / VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation . Our ﬁndings show that the function of the GAB in ﬁlament elongation can be mimicked by other WH2 motifs , and that a general modular arrange - ment of a G - actin - binding WH2 motif and the FAB from VASP is sufﬁcient to generate actin - ﬁlament elongators that allow fast and processive ﬁlament elongation in the presence of CP when clustered on surfaces . Importantly , the elongation rates mediated by Ena / VASP proteins were shown to correlate with the afﬁnity of their GAB to actin monomers at low actin concentrations . Since the actin afﬁnity of the hGAB motif is rather low and moreover strongly depends on the ionic strength of the reaction buffer , it is not surprising that previous studies reported incoherent results on the impact of vertebrate Ena / VASP proteins on ﬁlament barbed end elongation in in vitro studies using relatively low concentrations of actin and VASP in buffers with different salt concentrations ( Skoble et al , 2001 ; Samarin et al , 2003 ; Barzik et al , 2005 ; Pasic et al , 2008 ) . The good agreement between the experimental data and the mathematical model presented here supports a processive mechanism whereby multiple free GABs of the tetrameric VASP capture actin monomers from solution and transfer them onto the ﬁlament tip ( Figure 5 ) , which is similar to the ﬁlament end - tracking mechanism ( Dickinson et al , 2004 ) . Notably , individual ﬁlaments elongated from VASP - coated beads at roughly the same rates as with VASP in solution ( Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) , suggesting that the number of involved GABs ( N ) is a ﬁxed value , irrespective of whether VASP is immobilized on a surface or in solution . Interestingly , taken together , our data strongly suggest that ﬁlament elongation is mediated by a single VASP tetramer at any given time . These ﬁndings are consistent with a recent study by Hansen and Mullins ( 2010 ) reporting processive ﬁlament elongation by a single VASP tetramer in solution . On beads , ﬁlament elongation could be similarly accom - plished by one VASP tetramer , but since clustering is required for processive elongation ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) , our experiments cannot rule out the possibility that in a given geometric context four clustered VASP tetramers could oper - ate together , with one EVH2 domain tethering the ﬁlament while the other three EVH2 domains each participate in monomer delivery around a central actin ﬁlament . Together , our model does not only explain the different elongation rates mediated by Ena / VASP in vitro , but also anticipates that all Ena / VASP proteins are potent ﬁlament elongators in vivo , where the concentration of polymeriza - Calculated elongation rate for hVASP WT ( K D = 10 . 3 μ M ; k on = 15 μ M – 1 s – 1 ) hVASP DdGAB ( K D = 0 . 6 μ M ; k on = 53 μ M – 1 s – 1 ) 1 10 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 ( Actin monomers ) ( μ M ) E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s – 1 ) TIRF - assay conditions Biomimetic motility assay conditions In vivo conditions Figure 7 Calculation of the saturation dependence of ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP proteins . Comparison of the calculated elongation rates for processive ﬁlament elongation mediated by hVASP WT and hVASP DdGAB over a large range of actin concen - trations . Grey boxes indicate G - actin concentrations typically used in TIRF assays or present in biomimetic motility assays ( Samarin et al , 2003 ) , as well as physiological G - actin concentrations , for instance in the lamellipodium tip ( Koestler et al , 2009 ) . Different G - actin afﬁnities of the GAB motifs result in markedly different elongation rates mediated by chimeras hVASP and hVASP DdGAB in TIRF assays . However , both proteins are expected to be saturated with actin monomers and to enhance ﬁlament elongation to the same extent at very high monomer concentrations , for example under in vivo conditions . Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 464 tion - competent actin is much larger than under in vitro conditions ( Figure 7 ) ( Pollard et al , 2000 ) . It has been previously proposed that Ena / VASP enhances protrusion of lamellipodia and propulsion of ActA - coated beads and Listeria in reconstituted motility assays indirectly by prevent - ing capping of barbed ends by CP , by lowering the number of Arp2 / 3 - dependent ﬁlament branches or by mediating rapid attachment - detachment cycles of actin ﬁlaments to allow both the binding of F - actin and insertion of monomers by Brownian motion ( Laurent et al , 1999 ; Bear et al , 2000 , 2002 ; Samarin et al , 2003 ) . We show here that these ﬁndings are more readily explained by enhanced actin - ﬁlament elonga - tion rates mediated by processive interaction of Ena / VASP proteins with ﬁlament barbed ends , consistent with the actoclampin end - tracking motor hypothesis ( Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ; Dickinson et al , 2002 , 2004 ; Dickinson , 2009 ) . Finally , since our model implies that spontaneous addition of actin monomers is likely not to occur during processive VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation on surfaces , and since Ena / VASP proteins are abundantly found at sites of active actin assembly , it seems plausible that most if not all actin - ﬁlament elongation in the cell is directly controlled by end - tracking proteins . Materials and methods In vitro TIRF microscopy Time lapse total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) was essentially performed as described ( Breitsprecher et al , 2008 ) . Images from an Olympus IX - 81 inverted microscope were captured every 5 or 10s with exposures of 100ms with a Hamamatsu Orca - R2 CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Corp . , Bridgewater , NJ ) . The pixel size corresponded to 0 . 11 m m . If not stated otherwise , reactions in TIRFassays contained 1 . 3 m M actin ( 30 % OG labelled ) . Prior to the experiments , Ca 2 þ – ATP – actin was converted to Mg 2 þ – ATP – actin by addition of 10 (cid:3) Mg - exchange buffer ( 1mM MgCl 2 , 10mM EGTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . Polymeriza - tion experiments were performed in TIRF buffer ( 10mM imidazole , 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP , 10mM DTT , 15mM glucose , 20 m gml (cid:2) 1 catalase , 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 glucose oxidase and 0 . 25 % methylcellulose ( 4000cP ) , pH 7 . 4 ) . Assays with functionalized beads additionally contained 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) micro - spheres . Saturation of the beads with Ena / VASP proteins was conﬁrmed by SDS – PAGE prior to the experiments . The recorded data were analysed with ImageJ software either by manually tracking ﬁlaments or by tracking barbed ends using the plugin MtrackJ . Every experiment was repeated at least three times . On beads , total lengths of growing ﬁlaments were measured for at least 10 time frames . Filament growth rates were diagrammed as plots of length versus time and the average elongation rate in subunitss (cid:2) 1 was calculated from linear regressions of the slopes . Carboxylated 2 m m - diameter polystyrene microspheres ( Polyscience ) were coated with 5 m M of the different VASP constructs according to Samarin et al ( 2003 ) . The highest applicable actin concentration in TIRF assays was 4 m M since high background ﬂuorescence prevented the analysis of single actin ﬁlaments at higher concentrations . Mathematical model of VASP - mediated ﬁlament elongation The saturating dependence on substrate concentration and depen - dence on afﬁnity is reminiscent of the Michaelis – Menten model for enzyme kinetics , in which reversible binding of the substrate ( in this case , actin monomers ) is followed by irreversible conversion to product ( F - actin subunits ) . We assume each ﬁlament tip remains associated with a number ( N ) of GAB regions that are available for capturing monomers from solution ( at concentration , C ) with forward rate constant k on ( m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ) . Captured monomers are then either transferred to the ﬁlament tip at rate k t ( s (cid:2) 1 ) or released back into solution with off - rate k off ( s (cid:2) 1 ) . Let n be the ( average ) number of the N total GAB regions occupied by bound monomers .

Actin monomer binding assays Synthetic peptides DdGAB ( GRNALLGSIENFSKGGLKKTVT ) and hGAB ( GLAAAIAGAKLRKVSK ) were obtained from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research ( Braunschweig ) , and the WIP ( GRNALLSDISKGKKLKKTVT ) and T b 4 ( MSDKPDMAEIEKFDKSKLK KTET ) peptides were purchased from Peptide Specialty Labora - tories . Except for T b 4 , the binding of WH2 peptides to OG - actin resulted in a 10 – 20 % increase in OG - ﬂuorescence , which was used to detect the formation of WH2 – actin complexes . Fluorescence titrations were carried out in a Jasco FP - 6500 ﬂuorimeter . Excitation wavelength was 490nm and the OG - ﬂuorescence was detected at an emission wavelength of 520nm . All titrations were carried out at 22 1 C in either G - buffer or G - buffer supplemented with the KCl concentrations indicated and a ﬁve - fold molar excess of LatA ( Biomol ) to actin . After each addition , the solution was allowed to reequilibrate for 100s . If stated , Ca 2 þ – ATP – actin was converted to Mg 2 þ – ATP – actin by addition of 10 (cid:3) Mg - exchange buffer prior to the experiment . Reactions contained 0 . 02 % Tween 20 to avoid unspeciﬁc protein adsorption . Dissociation equilibrium constants ( K D ) were obtained by non - linear least - square ﬁtting utilizing the program package BPCﬁt ( Witte et al , 2008 ) .

Stopped - ﬂow experiments The kinetics of the interaction of EVH2 domains and OG - actin were monitored by detecting the increase in OG - ﬂuorescence using a Hi - tech Scientiﬁc SF - 61 DX single mixing stopped - ﬂow system , equipped with a 515 - nM cutoff ﬁlter . All reactions were carried out with Mg 2 þ – ATP OG - actin in G - buffer supplemented with 50mM KCl , 0 . 02 % Tween 20 and a ﬁve - fold molar excess of LatA over actin monomers . For experiments with the DdEVH2 domain , a ﬁnal concentration of 2 . 5 m M OG - actin was used . For hEVH2 , 10 m M OG - actin was used . Experiments were repeated 10 – 15 times for each EVH2 concentration , and the experimental data were accumulated for ﬁtting . Association rate constants ( k on ) were obtained by non - linear least - square ﬁtting of a reversible bimolecular reaction model ( A þ B 2 C ) to the data utilizing the program package BPCﬁt ( Witte et al , 2008 ) . The time course of the complex concentration C ( t ) was Actin - ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP D Breitsprecher et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 3 | 2011 465 calculated using the following equation : C ð t Þ ¼ C equ (cid:6) ð ﬃﬃﬃ w p þ C equ Þ C equ þ ﬃﬃﬃ w p (cid:6) exp ð k on (cid:6) ﬃﬃ w p (cid:6) t Þ exp ð k on (cid:6) ﬃﬃ w p (cid:6) t Þ(cid:2) 1 with : w ¼ ð A 0 þ B 0 þ K D Þ 2 (cid:2) 4 (cid:6) A 0 (cid:6) B 0 where A 0 and B 0 denote the total concentrations of OG - actin and EVH2 , respectively and C equ denotes the equilibrium concentration of the complex , which was calculated using the K D values determined for the interaction of OG - actin and the WH2 peptides ( v . i . ) .
