Frame ABSTRACT The actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family comprises small actin - binding proteins with crucial roles in development , tissue homeostasis and disease . They are best known for their roles in regulating actin dynamics by promoting actin treadmilling and thereby driving membrane protrusion and cell motility . However , recent discoveries have increased our understanding of the functions of these proteins beyond their well - characterized roles . This Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster serve as an introduction to the diverse roles of the ADF / cofilin family in cells . The first part of the article summarizes their actions in actin treadmilling and the main mechanisms for their intracellular regulation ; the second part aims to provide an outline of the emerging cellular roles attributed to the ADF / cofilin family , besides their actions in actin turnover . The latter part discusses an array of diverse processes , which include regulation of intracellular contractility , maintenance of nuclear integrity , transcriptional regulation , nuclear actin monomer transfer , apoptosis and lipid metabolism . Some of these could , of course , be indirect consequences of actin treadmilling functions , and this is discussed .

Posted on 9 August 2016 are widely recognized for their ability to regulate actin dynamics by severing filaments and enhancing their depolymerization . They are found in all eukaryotes , with most mammals expressing three isoforms ; in humans and mice these are the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as destrin ) , cofilin - 1 ( CFL1 ) and cofilin - 2 ( CFL2 ) ( Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ) . All three are encoded from different genes , and ADF shares 70 % amino acid identity with cofilins , whereas the latter share 80 % identity at the amino acid level . The functions of individual actin depolymerizing factors are not always clear from the existing literature for several reasons . Many reportsaddressingthe rolesofcofilins donotspecify which isoform is being studied or what the contributions of individual isoforms are in the context of total cellular actin depolymerizing activities , partly because it is thought that many of their functions overlap . In addition , antibodies often do not discriminate between different isoforms , and sometimes ‘ rescue experiments ’ have used cofilin from lower eukaryotes that express only one isoform . For these reasons and for simplicity , we refer to the group of actin depolymerizing factors collectively as cofilin ( s ) , except in cases where the roles for specific isoforms have been defined . Cofilinsarerequiredfornormaldevelopment , andlossoftheirtight regulation has severe consequences on tissue homeostasis and organism health ( see Box 1 ) . This Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster aim to introduce non - expert readers to the family of cofilin proteins , and it will also serve as a summary of newer emerging roles and review the latest findings in cofilin research . Hence , we will briefly summarize the well - characterized roles of cofilins in actin treadmilling , the major mechanisms of their regulation and their impact on membrane protrusion and cell motility . Finally , we will discuss emerging aspects of cellular functions of cofilins that expand our knowledge of this crucial family of proteins , besides their direct actions in actin turnover . Biochemistry , actin treadmilling and expression of cofilins Expression of cofilins Despite their similarity at the amino acid level , cofilins have different degrees of affinity for actin . Initial biochemical characterizations have revealed that although all mammalian isoforms have the ability to bind to filamentous ( F ) - and globular ( G ) - actin , ADF and CFL1 are able to bind to and promote steady - state F - actin disassembly to similar extents , whereas CFL2 is less efficient ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ; Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) . This biochemical difference was thought to reflect the fact that ADF and CFL1 are mainly expressed in tissues that benefit from a higher degree of actin turnover . Specifically , ADF is mainly expressed in neuronal , epithelial and endothelial cells , whereas CFL1 appears to be ubiquitously expressed in most adult tissues . CFL2 , by contrast , is considered to be restricted to muscle tissue , which is not associated with high actin turnover ( Gurniak et al . , 2005 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . However , a more recent study has implied that ADF , CFL1 and CFL2 all bind to G - and F - actin with similar affinities , Box 2 . Cofilin – actin binding and insights on actin severing ADFand CFL1 bind to ADP - associated actin subunits with higheraffinity compared to ATP - or ADP - P i subunits , and accelerate P i release ; however , CFL2 has the ability to bind to the latter forms with higher affinity than ADF and CFL1 ( Kremneva et al . , 2014 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ; Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) . The ADP - actin regions of actin filaments ( which represent the ‘ older ’ pointed ends , as opposed to the ATP - actin - rich regions that represent the ‘ newer ’ elongating barbed ends of the filaments ) is where severing preferentially occurs at the boundaries between bare and cofilin - decorated parts of filaments ( Suarez et al . , 2011 ) . Presumably , this is because cofilin binding results in changes in the properties and structure of the actin filaments , thus making them susceptible to fragmentation ( Galkin et al . , 2011 , 2001 ; McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Hence , theactin - severing function ofcofilin isdirectlyrelatedtoits concentrationrelativetoactin ( thecofilin : actinratio ) atanygiventimeand location . Highconcentrationsofcofilinappeartobeabletonucleateactin monomers , as well as to saturate and stabilize actin filaments , whereas lower ratios between cofilin and actin promote filament disassembly because cofilin is only bound sporadically to filaments ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Other factors have recently been identified to cooperate with cofilin and to enhance the depolymerization of actin filaments . These factors include actin - interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ) , twinfilin proteins , adenylyl cyclase - associated protein 1 ( CAP1 ) and the coronins ( Chen et al . , 2015 ; Gressin etal . , 2015 ; Johnston etal . , 2015 ; Kueh etal . , 2008 ; Mikatietal . , 2015 ; Nadkarni and Brieher , 2014 ) . In addition to severing , cofilin also de - branches mainly ‘ older ’ ADP - bound actin filaments , whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is the protein complex responsible for nucleating new filaments , introducing 70° branches on F - actin , preferentially binds to newly polymerized ATP - actin segments ( Chan et al . , 2009 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) . However , although cofilin debranching activity has been studied and does occur , anothercofilin - likemoleculetermedgliamaturationfactor ( GMF , ofwhich there are different isoforms ) appears to be more specific for the Arp2 / 3 complex branches and is more efficient than cofilin in mediating debranching ( Haynes et al . , 2015 ; Poukkula et al . , 2014 ; Ydenberg et al . , 2013 ) . Box 1 . Physiological importance of ADF and cofilins Cofilinsarepartoftheminimumsetofproteinsthatareessentialforactin - based motility in vitro ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) , as well as for endocytosis , at least in yeast ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . As a consequence , their importance in embryonic development , health and disease is evident . CFL1 deficiency is embryonic lethal in mice owing to defects in proliferation , polarization and migration of neural crest cells , with the latter leading to subsequent failure of neural tube closure ( Bellenchi etal . , 2007 ; Gurniaketal . , 2005 ) . ADFis unableto compensatefor CFL1 loss in vivo , implying that they have non - redundant roles in brain development . Mutations ordeletion ofADF lead to developmentof cornea disease in mice ( ADF is the predominant isoform expressed in cornea ) , which is marked by aberrant actin cytoskeleton arrangement , epithelial hyperproliferation and eventual blindness ( Bellenchi et al . , 2007 ; Ikeda et al . , 2003 ; Verdoni et al . , 2008 ) . Deletion of the genes encoding either ADFor CFL1 has no discernible effect on ureteric bud development in mice , but their co - depletion leads to severely perturbed branching morphogenesis and disrupted cell motility , cell shape and actin structures ( Kuure et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , double depletion of ADF and CFL1 ( but not single deletion ) in the skin epithelium of adult mice also leads to loss of tissue homeostasis , with extensive epidermal thickening , aberrant cell morphology with loss of cell – cell contacts , hyperproliferation and a pronounced accumulation of filamentous actin ( Kanellos et al . , 2015 ) , indicating that there is some functional redundancy between ADF and CFL1 in some tissue contexts . CFL2 mutations promote the development of myopathies in humans ( Agrawal et al . , 2007 ; Ockeloen et al . , 2012 ) . Genetic deletion of CFL2 in mice causes lethality eight days after birth due to severe muscle deficiencies and aberrant actin accumulation within muscle myofibrils , indicating that CFL2 has an important role in muscle development and maintenance ( Agrawal et al . , 2012 ) . A role of CFL2 in actin monomer exchange in sarcomeres has also been proposed ( Gurniak et al . , 2014 ) . Cofilins have also been implicated to be involved at various stages of cancer development and to contribute to tumour progression , invasion and metastasis ( Wang et al . , 2007 , 2004 , 2006a ) . Cofilin could also be involved in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders owing to its role in formation of cofilin – actin rods in response to stimuli that affect normalneuronalfunction ( BamburgandBernstein , 2016 ; Bamburgetal . , 2010 ) . 2 CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 0 , 1 - 8 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 187849 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e (cid:129) A d v a n c e a rt i c l e and , interestingly , ADF and CFL2 are able to sever actin filaments more efficiently compared to CFL1 ( Chin et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , lack of a readily available antibody against CFL2 has delayed deeper understanding of the role of this isoform . We now know that many tissues express all three isoforms , including oligodendrocytes , keratinocytes and cancerous tissue of non - muscle origin ( Kanellos et al . , 2015 ; Zuchero et al . , 2015 ) , and that CFL2 is a major constituent in human peritoneal mesothelial cells ( Herzog et al . , 2015 ) . It is possible that tissues that express multiple isoforms might fine tune their expression levels individually in order to tightly control the rates of actin turnover , whereas the types of accessory protein that decorate actin filaments and the expression patterns of cofilin ancillary proteins ( see Box 2 ) modify their efficiency . In turn , this could be linked to their tissue - specific functions . Information on the mechanism of cofilin - mediated actin - filament severing can be found in Box 2 . Localization By severing , de - branching and enhancing the depolymerization of ‘ older ’ filaments , cofilin increases the availability of filament ends , as well as the actin monomer pool , thereby promoting filament and dendritic nucleation and / or elongation ( see also Box 2 ) . This makes cofilins pivotal regulators of actin - based membrane protrusion and cell locomotion ( reviewed in Bravo - Cordero et al . , 2013 ) . However , despite their similarity , it is still under debate whether each isoform fulfils unique roles at the cell periphery ; a recent study suggests that they do because ADF or CFL1 depletion leads to characteristic differences in cell migration , focal adhesion turnover and formation of aberrant actin structures for each isoform ( Tahtamouni et al . , 2013 ) . In keeping with their role in remodelling the actin cytoskeleton , ADF and CFL1 are enriched in sub - cellular locations that are associated with high actin turnover , specifically in ruffling membranes or actin - based membrane protrusions at the leading edges of motile cells ( lamellipodia , invadopodia , etc . ) , neuronal axons and the contractile rings formed during the final stages of mitosis ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . CFL2 , by contrast , is predominantly localized between the Z - discs in muscle sarcomeres , where it regulates the length of actin filaments as a result of its ability to bind to and disassemble ATP - or ADP - P i - bound filaments with greater efficiency when compared with that of ADF or CFL1 ( in sarcomeres the barbed ends of the filaments are capped , and actin subunit exchange and length maintenance is primarily restricted to the pointed ends that might contain a mixture of ADP - , as well as ATP - or ADP - P i - bound subunits ) ( Kremneva et al . , 2014 ) . However , cofilins also contain a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) and are able to translocate to the nucleus , and there is increasing evidence of their involvement in nuclear function ( see below ) . Regulation of cofilins Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation The activity of cofilins is regulated by a plethora of mechanisms , including phosphorylation on residue Ser3 by LIM kinases ( LIMK1 and LIMK2 ) ( reviewed in Scott and Olson , 2007 ) and TES kinases ( TESK1 and TESK2 ) , which inhibits their interaction with actin ( Toshima et al . , 2001a , b ) ( see poster ) . The predominant upstream regulators of LIMK activity are the Rho family of small GTPases and the Rho - associated effector kinases . Specifically , phosphorylation ( activation ) of LIMKs can be downstream of the Rho and Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) pathway ( Maekawa et al . , 1999 ; Ohashi et al . , 2000 ) or of Rac or Cdc42 that signal through p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) or myotonic dystrophy kinase - related Cdc42 - binding kinase α ( MRCK α ) activity ( Dan et al . , 2001 ; Edwards et al . , 1999 ; Sumi et al . , 2001 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) . LIMKs are also downstream of mitogen - activated protein kinase - activated protein kinase 2 ( MAPKAPK2 ) activity in endothelial cells ( Kobayashi et al . , 2006 ) . The regulation of TES kinases is understood to a much lesser extent . Dephosphorylation of Ser3 leads to cofilin activation . The main protein phosphatases known to activate cofilin are slingshot ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ) and chronophin ( encoded by PDXP ) ( Gohla et al . , 2005 ) , although the more generic serine / threonine phosphatases type 1 and type 2A have also been reported to dephosphorylate cofilin ( Ambach et al . , 2000 ) . Slingshot phosphatases can also interact with and dephosphorylate LIMKs , which inactivates them , thereby adding another level of regulation of cofilin activity ( Soosairajah et al . , 2005 ) . The phosphorylation - dependent regulation of cofilin is likely to be context - specific and is still incompletely understood . PIP 2 binding One of the first cofilin regulatory mechanisms to be identified was phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) binding , which inhibits the interaction of cofilin with actin as they both interact with the same region on the surface of cofilin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ; Zhao et al . , 2010 ) ( see poster ) . Cofilin clusters PIP 2 molecules at the membrane through its interaction with multiple PIP 2 headgroups ; hence , changes in PIP 2 density can effectively regulate cofilin activity at the membrane ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . Chemoattractants , such as epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , promote the local activation of cofilin by stimulating its release from PIP 2 , following PIP 2 hydrolysis that is triggered by phospholipase C ( PLC ) . In turn , this local cofilin activation induces the formation of membrane protrusions and mediates directional cell motility and chemotaxis ( Mouneimne et al . , 2006 , 2004 ; van Rheenen et al . , 2007 ) . Even the local activation of a chemically modified inactive form of cofilin is sufficient to drive localized protrusions and directional cell migration ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Regulation of cofilin through PIP 2 binding appears to be confined to subcortical actin networks and is independent of LIMKs ( Song et al . , 2006 ) . In fact , the general inhibition of cofilin through LIMK - mediated phosphorylation acts in concert with its local activation through release from phospholipids to permit cellular directional sensing . This is one possible explanation of why LIMK inhibition , which generally leads to higher levels of active ( unphosphorylated ) cofilin , results in loss of cell directionality and impaired invasion in three - dimensional matrices ( Mouneimne et al . , 2006 ; Scott et al . , 2010 ) . Regulation through pH Cofilin activity is also affected by the intracellular pH , and the Na + - H + exchanger NHE1 ( encoded by SLC9A1 ) plays an important role in this regulation . Firstly , the cofilin - induced clustering of PIP 2 ( see above ) is sensitive to pH , with higher pH inhibiting clustering ; this can decrease PIP 2 density at the membrane , leading , in turn , to increased local cofilin release and activation , and pH - dependent membrane protrusions and motility in response to growth factor stimulation ( Frantz et al . , 2008 ; Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . Secondly , cofilin activities , with respect to actin severing and filament depolymerization , are regulated by pH , with cofilin being more potent at increased pH ( pH 8 ) ( Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) . Thirdly , local pH variations influence the binding of cofilin to cortactin , another cofilin - interacting protein , evident in invasive protrusions of breast cancer cells . An increase in pH , mediated by NHE1 , results in the 3 CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 0 , 1 - 8 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 187849 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e (cid:129) A d v a n c e a rt i c l e release of cofilin from cortactin ; this activates cofilin and promotes cell invasion ( Magalhaes et al . , 2011 ) . Other regulatory mechanisms Other types of regulation of cofilins that have been reported include phosphorylation of CFL1 by viral ( v ) - Src at Tyr68 ( a residue that is not present in ADF ) , which ‘ marks ’ the protein for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation through the ubiquitin – proteasome pathway ( Yoo et al . , 2010 ) . It is unclear whether this represents a physiological mechanism that is normally carried out by cellular ( c ) - Src . Furthermore , oxidation of cofilin cysteine residues in motile cells regulates its binding to actin and affects cell motility ( Cameron et al . , 2015 ) . The same modification has been reported to influence cofilin activities during apoptosis ( see Apoptosis section below ) . Lastly , mechanosensitive regulation of cofilin actin binding and severing activity has been reported ( Hayakawa et al . , 2011 ; Tojkander et al . , 2015 ) . Cofilin appears to preferentially bind to less - tensile actin filaments and to mediate their degradation , whereas filaments under tension are protected from cofilin - mediated fragmentation . This mechano - regulation has been shown to be important for the maturation of contractile stress fibres in cells ( Tojkander et al . , 2015 ) . New and emerging roles of cofilins Contractility Co - depletion of ADF and CFL1 in HeLa cells causes the accumulation of abnormal F - actin structures , which is mediated by excessive myosin - II activity ( Wiggan et al . , 2012 ) . It has long been known that cofilin and myosin and / or tropomyosin compete for binding to actin filaments ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) , and this could be important for distinguishing actin filaments on the basis of distinct properties and molecular composition ( Bryce et al . , 2003 ) . However , a physiological relevance of this competition has only recently been reported , where it was shown to regulate intracellular contractility , which if left unchecked in the absence of ADF and CFL1 , leads to excessive force generation and multiple cellular defects , such as unrestrained membrane blebbing , as well as impaired chromosome segregation and cell division ( Wiggan et al . , 2012 ) . The effects are less prominent when ADF is depleted alone and are most severe after co - depletion of both ADF and CFL1 , implying functional redundancy in this cellular context ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Wiggan et al . , 2012 ) . Increased contractility following ADF and CFL1 co - depletion has also recently been reported , where it was shown that a similar mechanism involving tight control of contractile actin fibres by cofilins regulates nuclear architecture and ultimately cell viability ( see below ) ( Kanellos et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , another consequence of dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton occurs during neuritogenesis . In differentiating neurons , the ADF - and CFL1 - mediated remodelling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton facilitates normal neurite differentiation . ADF and CFL1 loss results in an aberrant actin cytoskeleton with a denser , presumably more tensile , actin cortex that obstructs appropriate microtubule positioning and protrusion , blocking neuritogenesis ( Flynn et al . , 2012 ) . Apoptosis During induction of apoptosis with staurosporine , active ( lacking phosphorylation of Ser3 ) cofilin can translocate to mitochondria before cytochrome c release , and this has been shown to be crucial for the initiation of cell death ( Chua et al . , 2003 ) . TGF - β - induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells also requires mitochondrial translocation of cofilin ( Zhu et al . , 2006 ) . Although cofilin action during induction of apoptosis ( albeit not completely understood ) might suffice for the initiation of the process , other actin - binding proteins could be involved , for example CAP1 ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , oxidation of cysteine residues in active cofilin is essential for its translocation to mitochondria during oxidant - induced apoptosis . Following its translocation , cofilin promotes cytochrome c release by affecting the permeability of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( Klamt et al . , 2009 ) . However , cofilin oxidation is dispensable when apoptosis is induced by stimuli other than reactive oxygen species ( Klamt et al . , 2009 ) ( see poster ) . Translocation of cofilin to mitochondria also mediates amyloid - β - induced neurotoxicity in a process that involves Ran - binding protein 9 ( Woo et al . , 2015 ) . In addition to these roles at early stages of apoptosis , cofilin might also be involved in the regulation of apoptosis - associated morphologies during the later stages , such as in apoptosis - associated bleb formation ( Mannherz et al . , 2005 ) . Nuclear actin transport Actin regulates fundamental nuclear processes , such as transcription , reprogramming and gene activation ( reviewed in Miyamoto and Gurdon , 2013 ) . Hence , cells appear to have evolved very sophisticated mechanisms for tight regulation of the balance between the amount and state of actin in both the cytoplasm and nucleus . One of the mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of nuclear actin levels is mediated by an interaction between cofilin and importin - 9 ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ) ( see poster ) . Actin does not have a classic NLS , whereas cofilins have a bipartite NLS that allows for their efficient shuttling into the nucleus ( Munsie et al . , 2012 ) . Importin - 9 interacts with actin in a cofilin - dependent manner ( likely to be mediated through the cofilin NLS ) , and this interaction is crucial for the nuclear transport of actin , which in turn influences the level of transcription ( see also below ) ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ) . Transcription As mentioned above , nuclear actin and cofilin influence transcriptional activity in cells . This is supported by the fact that CFL1 is part of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery ( Obrdlik and Percipalle , 2011 ) . Specifically , CFL1 has been found to have a role in transcriptional elongation of gene - coding sequences and apparently does not associate with untranslated regions or promoters . Silencing of CFL1 leads to significantly reduced transcriptional activity , and the association of both RNA polymerase II and actin with gene coding regions is also affected , highlighting the importance of CFL1 as part of the transcriptional apparatus ( Obrdlik and Percipalle , 2011 ) . Interestingly , restoring nuclear actin levels independently of cofilin does not restore normal transcription , suggesting that cofilin is not simply controlling transcription through regulation of monomeric actin availability ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ) . Nuclear architecture The depletion of both ADF and CFL1 leads to severe perturbation of cellular and adult tissue homeostasis , which is marked by the uncontrolled assembly of contractile actin filaments and consequent increase in tension that promotes nuclear deformation and loss of cell viability ( Kanellos et al . , 2015 ) . A specialized subset of contractile actin fibres ( which are tethered into focal adhesions ) pass over the nucleus and regulate nuclear shape – these are collectively termed the ‘ actin cap ’ ( Khatau et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2012 ) . The linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton ( LINC ) complex , which localizes to the nuclear envelope , physically connects these actin 4 CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 0 , 1 - 8 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 187849 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e (cid:129) A d v a n c e a rt i c l e cap fibres with the nuclear lamina ( reviewed in Starr and Fridolfsson , 2010 ) . Disruption of this LINC - complex - mediated connection relieves nuclei from the increased forces exerted on them by the aberrant tensile filaments that arise after ADF and CFL1 depletion , and restores nuclear integrity and normal shape ( Kanellos et al . , 2015 ) . This implies that the actin cap fibres are regulated by cofilins in cells and that this regulation is crucial for nuclear positioning and migration , as well as probably all the cellular features and responses that are controlled by the link between the actin cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope ( Starr and Fridolfsson , 2010 ) ( see poster ) . Interestingly , increased tension in actin filaments that are linked to the nuclear lamina promotes the formation of indentation sites in the nuclei of normal endothelial cells , and this affects chromatin condensation ( Versaevel et al . , 2014 ) . This emphasizes the importance of tight regulation between actin filaments and acto - myosin contractility , mediated by cofilins , for nuclear morphology and function , including chromosome regulation . Lipid metabolism Cofilin that is phosphorylated at Ser3 was long considered to be an inactive form of cofilin without any biological function ; however , this might not be the case as it has been shown to interact directly with phospholipase D1 ( PLD1 ) ( Han et al . , 2007 ) . Phospholipase D proteins comprise a family of enzymes that catalyse the conversion of phosphatidylcholine ( PtdCho ) , a phospholipid found in biological membranes , to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , thereby triggering downstream signalling ( reviewed in Exton , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2006b ) . PLD1 activity is regulated by Rho signalling ( Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) , which also controls the activity of LIMKs and subsequent cofilin phosphorylation . The interaction of cofilin phosphorylated at residue Ser3 with PLD1 is required for the translocation of PLD1 to the plasma membrane and the stimulation of its activity ( Han et al . , 2007 ) . The activity of PLD1 can be inhibited by constitutively active cofilin ( Ser3 to Ala mutation ) , silencing of cofilin expression or overexpression of slingshot phosphatase , whereas it is enhanced by overexpression of cofilin or a mimetic of cofilin that is phosphorylated at Ser3 ( Ser3 to Asp mutation ) . This confirms that even in its phosphorylated , presumed inactive form , cofilin is likely to fulfil important biological roles ( Han et al . , 2007 ) . Mechanical checkpoint Another emerging role for cofilins is the regulation of cell proliferation in response to mechanical cues , which promote cofilin - mediated actin cytoskeleton remodelling , in turn influencing the activity of the transcriptional co - activators YAP1 and TAZ ( encoded by WWTR1 ) ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ) . Activity of the YAP and TAZ pathway is crucial for cell proliferation , during development , and has also been implicated in various diseases such as cancer ( reviewed in Piccolo et al . , 2014 ) . Increased mechanical tension upon cofilin depletion , and subsequent stabilization of actin stress fibres , promotes the nuclear localization of YAP and TAZ , and enhances transcription and proliferation ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , cytoskeleton remodelling , or release of tension through chemical inhibition of contractility , inhibits proliferation , and these responses are independent of the classic Hippo pathway that is mediated by the effector kinases MST1 and MST2 ( also known as STK4 and STK3 , respectively ) , and LATS1 and LATS2 ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ) . This crosstalk between the actin cytoskeleton and the YAP and TAZ pathway has been shown to be the main driver of a subset of uveal and skin melanomas . Cells from these uveal melanomas have reduced levels of cofilin activity , which promote actin cytoskeleton stability and activation of YAP . YAP activation is sensitive to inhibition of either contractility or actin polymerization in this context as well ( Feng et al . , 2014 ) . Taken together , these findings demonstrate that cells can sense the architecture of the microenvironment and respond to mechanical cues by cofilin - dependent remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton , eliciting responses that are vital for cell fate and tissue homeostasis . Stress response As well as an NLS , cofilin also has a nuclear export signal ( NES ) , which mediates its transport out of the nucleus ( Munsie et al . , 2012 ) . Under stress conditions , such as heat shock , osmotic stress or ATP depletion , cofilin accumulates in the nucleus where it excessively binds to , and saturates , actin filaments , resulting in the formation of cofilin – actin ‘ rods ’ . Although this has been shown to occur mainly inside the nucleus , cytoplasmic rod formation has also been observed ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Munsie et al . , 2012 ) . Rod formation is involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders , such as Huntington ’ s and Alzheimer ’ s , as the cofilin – actin rods are part of the protein inclusions that contribute to the disruption of neurite function ( Bamburg and Bernstein , 2016 ; Minamide et al . , 2010 , 2000 ) . Although not completely understood , it has been proposed that rod formation under conditions of stress could serve as a means for the cell to prevent excessive ATP hydrolysis associated with actin filament turnover , which would make ATP unavailable for other cellular stress responses ( Bernstein et al . , 2006 ) . Because cofilin – actin rod formation is a rapid response when cells are stressed in vitro , it has been suggested that rod formation could be a potential candidate for the targeted treatment and prevention of neuronal degenerative disorders ( Bamburg et al . , 2010 ) . Concluding remarks Cofilins have long been implicated in a diverse and multifaceted array of cellular functions and , as discussed above , many new and unexpected roles have emerged . We think it likely that many more will emerge in the coming years . However , it remains to be established whether the ‘ newer ’ biological roles of cofilins are a direct result of their actin - severing activities or whether these proteins also have as yet unappreciated activities as adaptor proteins and so contribute to the scaffolding of specific molecular complexes in space and time . Despite a wealth of information on their cytoplasmic functions , the nuclear roles of cofilins ( and indeed of actin itself ) are only now becoming clearer . Roles of nuclear actin appear to include its association with all three RNA polymerases , as well as in controlling the movement of entire chromosomes ( Chuang et al . , 2006 ; Miyamoto and Gurdon , 2013 ) , yet the regulation of these activities and the consequences of their misregulation for health and disease are not well understood . We postulate that cofilins are likely to contribute to the activities of nuclear actin , and future work will surely address this . There is evidence that deformability of the nuclear envelope is a property of cancer cells that facilitates successful cell migration and invasion through complex ‘ crowded ’ environments , and actin mediates this deformability ( Davidson et al . , 2014 ; Thiam et al . , 2016 ) . This is in keeping with our own data that the activities of ADF and CFL1 in cancer cells are required for maintenance of cell shape , nuclear integrity and cell viability , and loss of ADF and CFL1 causes irreversible nuclear deformation ( Kanellos et al . , 2015 ) . Taken together , the current evidence points to a growing list of diverse biological roles for cofilins , as well as to the crucial nature 5 CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 0 , 1 - 8 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 187849 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e (cid:129) A d v a n c e a rt i c l e of their actions and their multi - layered regulation that are frequently perturbed in disease .
