Nas’aiman M . M . Z . 1 Centre of Construction , Building and Tropical Architecture Faculty of Built Environment , University of Malaya 50603 Kuala Lumpur ABSTRACT The effectiveness of a project team is important because it affects work quality and productivity . In these days due to increasing in globalization of organizations , most tasks and projects require contribution of an entire team . Similarly , teamwork in project virtual teams is important and personalities of the team members greatly contribute to this environment . This study was about the relationship between organizational climate , management , leadership and personality trait relationships with virtual team set the use of ICT and development of company . The study attempted to explore the type of team personality composition that mostly impacted the effectiveness of the virtual team success including the personality traits of the team members . Qualitative method of research design was employed with the findings analysed by descriptive approach . A questionnaire survey distributed to 30 respondents that were randomly selected from a renowned organization within the industry . The findings showed that the majority of the respondents agreed that the relationship between organizational climate and job satisfaction among the group members was very closely related to leadership , management and existing personality trait . In addition , the smooth use of ICT was directly specifically for virtual team itself . It could be concluded that leadership styles in organizational management based on personality selected trait . Keywords : Personalities , Virtual Project Team , Effectiveness INTRODUCTION A globalization change has pave way for organization management to strategize and to shape working relationship that uses information systems as platform to increase social capital . The proliferations of globalization have major corporations making use virtual teams that has with as much as 137 million worker reported worldwide involve with remote electronic work in some capacity or other ( Mathers , 2001 ) . Organizations utilize the use of virtual team to draw on work processes not confined to one geographical locale and expertise ( Harowitz et al , 2006 ) . Not only that , they have become primary modalities of communication to work process design , time and cost reduction ( Preiss , 1999 ) . Subsequently , the rationale of having virtual work is a sound business decision , as it will consequently reduce workspace costs , increased productivity , improving customer service , better access to global markets and environmental benefits ( Cascio , 2000 ) . Virtual teams are established of members who work in an organization or across an inter - organizational system . They are employees who are expected to work together and collaborate to achieve an organizational goal within specific time and limited resources . A multi - cultural team is a team whose members have different cultural backgrounds , for instance because they are from different countries .

By dynamically allocating people to projects based on expertise rather than location , organizations can more easily assign the most qualified people to appropriate projects without concern for the expense and wasted productivity caused by extensive travel or frequent relocation ( Goldman , 2000 ) . The excellence of the organization is due to many factors . However , many managers and researchers in the field of leadership and management tend to view leadership and its relationship to personality traits and ICT as well as the existence of a virtual team that built a reputation as a major contributor to the achievement or the direct cause of the organization and an efficient organizational climate . The leadership is generally much based on the assumption that leadership is the cause of the effectiveness of the organization . The leader of an organization that can handle changes and creating an efficient organizational climate can lead an organization to excellence and bring satisfaction to existing customers . Effective leadership and personality traits leaders also often associated with the nature , value and ethical conduct . Attitudes and behaviour of leaders impact the treatment of members of the organization and this will in turn affect the organization ' s performance ( Trevino et al , 2003 ) . Often the issues found in the organisation which relate to the virtual team are : a ) Leadership quality Poor leadership will cause any team to fail , whether it is physical or digital , the issue becomes much more sensitive when you’re dealing with virtual teams . Many virtual managers are poor leaders and poor communicators . They do not know how to get their message across , or they’re indecisive when it comes to choosing the ways in which they want the project to function ( Tuffley , 2009 ) . b ) Trust When work in virtual teams , it’s all too easy to forget that we are in fact working with real people who just happen to be far miles away , and trust in the relationship takes a beating . Yet trust is paramount to collaboration , to getting things done , and to relying on those who we don’t see every day and cannot look in the eye . ( Holton J . A . , 2001 ) c ) Bond If there is no trust it will be hard to create the bond between the team members . Without bond there will be no unity in the team . This is bad culture as it can bring down the team as a whole . ( Furumo & Pillis , 2008 ) d ) Communication Efficiency Disadvantage that comes with virtual teams is a reduction in communication efficiency . A number of studies have consistently shown that much of what humans communicate to one another is not based on their verbal language , but on non - verbal language . Some studies show that as much as 30 % of communication is non - verbal . ( Jarvenpa & Leidner , 1999 ) VIRTUAL TEAM In these days and age with the rampant rise of communication technology within organization pave the way for the evolution on how people interact interdependently thus the rise of virtual team . It is better defined as a group of individuals with a common purpose and goal who works across different time zone , distance but within the boundaries of organizations with communication technologies act as link . Virtual team also factored in cultural differences as well as diverse working environment . Its main Journal Design + Built The Impact of Virtual Team Characteristics on Project Effectiveness _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 3 purpose was to facilitate steps to be achieve that become the basis for the people to work together but still be interdependent . This current trend has enable organization to maintain and or decrease operation cost overtime . Organizations nevertheless , it does not come without challenges . In today’s corporate culture , most of operational task were simplified with the use of computer - aided process and technology , which in turn make virtual team possible that can transcend the boundaries of how organization operates . This allows work to be carried out over intricate web of technological links therefore reduces the need for collocated teams . People communicate and collaborate electronically with colleagues in geographically disperse group within or / and outside of organization , whilst depending upon the information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) as oppose to face - to - face discussions ( Roojie et al , 2007 ) . Correlation working relationship with multiple teams that transcend geographical boundaries , time and organization culture . Three main components of virtual team consist of purpose , people and link . Virtual team need to have a common ground that endeavour the same goal that need to be accomplish which in turn construct processes in achieving those objective whilst working side by side using feasible methodology . People are the integral part of the virtual teams , everyone in the team must be independent and self - reliant but still be mutually dependent . Constant evolvement of ICT has led to organizational growth in its flexibility and structure ( Fulk & DeSantics , 1995 ; Jarvenpaa & Ives , 1994 ) . Virtual team symbolizes a significant example of organizational changes ( Jarvenpaa & Ives , 1994 ) . Virtual team is also known as sets of workforces with certain skills separated by time , space and cultural differences with mutual objective brought together by way of ICTs ( DeSantics & Poole , 1997 ) . A virtual team is considered as a breakthrough in the form organizational network ( Miles & Snow 1986 ) as it used evolutionary of ICT technology to interact . Collaboration between members of organization in a geographically challenge locale can be done in a more productive manner as people in virtual team groups work on tasks interdependently . They carry out their work through electronic platform whilst geographically scattered , at the same time have equal responsibility for team outcomes . They are wide reaching globally across and down the chain of commands . It a major hindrance for virtual teams as they face challenges in the aspect of communication , task as well as culture ( Malhotra , 2003 ) . Cultural pays a huge part in virtual teaming environments . They are more likely to include members with different cultures than contrasting teams in the same locale ( Duarte & Synder , 2001 ) . Culture can be defined as customary beliefs , social forms , and material traits of a racial , religious , or social group often used to discern one group from another . One of the challenges from organization whom employs virtual teams may face is cultural differences such as national culture , organizational culture and functional culture ( Duarte & Snyder , 2001 ; Beamer & Varner , 2008 ) . Each members of the team have their own cultures , and as the team develops , this distinctive mix of team members’ national , functional and organizational culture forms a unique team culture . Cultural values serve as filter for one’s insight of the surrounding environment , guiding behavior such as decision - making ( Chudoba et al . , 2003 ) . Culture on its own brings together the world of languages , is still relevant in virtual environment despite the fact communications is mediated through ICT ( Vatsyayan , 1981 ) . Extensive used of communication technology has led to creation of virtual team . Interaction in virtual team is mediated by time , distance and technology ( Driskell et al , 2003 ) . Virtual team uses ICT in using 4 facets ( Mittleman & Briggs , 1999 ) . Technologies are used to gather , interpret and present information , such as collaborative document management systems and electronic white boards . It can also be used to facilitate Journal Design + Built The Impact of Virtual Team Characteristics on Project Effectiveness _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 4 communication between team members globally and or within external organizations . Lastly , information technologies can assist team member process information by providing structure systems for brainstorming , problem solving , and decision making activities . Technologies may also be used to structure the group process through meeting agendas , assignment charts and project management tools . In all likelihood the perception of virtual team has three main aspects : first is its functionality whereby team members are interdependent in task at hand , are liable to any outcomes , and collectively manages relationships across organizational boundaries ; Secondly , team members are geographically dispersed ; and third , they rely on technology - mediated communication to accomplish tasks ( Cohen & Gibson ; 2003 ) . In essence , team members are scattered and they use computer - mediated communication . Technological Tools Use in Virtual Teams and Its Advantages Nevertheless , the uses technology solely does not make them a virtual team because others used technological support regardless of the locations for work on day - to - day basis . The sole importance of teams using technology as means of communication enhance the need for ‘virtuality’ , as virtual teams does not have any other option but to use technology for ‘virtuality’ . Virtual teams have no chronological work environment , and hardly ever meet face - to - face ; in reality , team members may not even have the occasion to do just that ( Hertel et al 2005 ) . Table 1 further illustrated the use of technological tools use in virtual teams , its advantages as well as mode of sensory uses .

( 2007 ) Types of Virtual Team Virtual team distinguishes by the number of persons involved with the measure of interaction between . It consists of several “telework” ( telecommunicating ) carry out within and outside of an organization with information communication technology ( ICT ) act as bridge that make it possible . Thrown into the mix several teleworkers whereby reporting will be done under the same supervision . Virtual team has common goal ( s ) that interaction amongst member are vital to accomplish the ends . A network of communication thus is form as a result of collaborative work that create “virtual communities” which are entities of distributed work done via online on the basis of common purpose , roles and norms . Telework is considered as cost savings method to reduce the time - consuming commute to and from workplace and offer the flexibility of having more personal time ( Johnson , 2001 ) . The differences of virtual team classified with respect to two variables ( the number of locations ) and managers ( one or more ) Cascio and Shurygailo ( 2003 ) . Consequently , there are four categories of teams : 1 . Teleworkers : A single manager of a team at one location . 2 . Remote team : A single manager of a team distributed across multiple location . 3 . Matrixed teleworkers : Multiple manager of a team at one location . 4 . Matrixed remote teams : Multiple managers across multiple locations .

Table 2 : Classifying Physical Teams Versus Virtual Teams Activity Physical Teams Nature Virtual Teams Nature Nature of interaction Opportunity to share work an non - work related information . The extent information minimal of is informal related exchange of information Utilization of resources Increases the opportunity for allocation and sharing of resources . Each collaborating body will have to have access to similar technical and non - technical infrastructure Control and accountability ( over and within the project ) The project manager provides the context for ongoing monitoring of activities and events and thus enhances their ability to respond to requirements . The collaborating bodies were accountable to the task leaders and the project coordinator who had limited authority to enforce any penalties for failure to achieve their tasks Working environment They constraints information interacting encountered accessing and with others . Sometimes not able to share ideas or dilemmas with other partners . Although it is norm for organization to make use of virtual team , it will not likely to replace traditional team as virtual team not be suitable for all circumstances ( Nemiro , 2002 ) . Lurey and Raisinghani ( 2001 ) survey conducted in 12 separate virtual teams from eight different sponsor companies in IT found that organizations choose to employ this method have to focus their effort in the same direction as they were employing traditional team . It is concluded the effectiveness of ICT - enabled virtual collaboration with the face - to - face communication support , lead to high level of satisfaction in collaboration . Virtual Team Leadership As organization worldwide strive to improve their deliverable quality of work to remain competitive and ensure growth , researchers and practitioners are challenged to tamper with the nature of leadership requirements pertaining to organizations in general ( Robinson & Harvey , 2008 ) and virtual teams in particular ( Leonard , 2011 ; Pearce , 2004 ) . Virtual teams approach poses significant leadership and management challenges for organization that want to using it in their system . No doubt that this challenges are existing in traditional teams but the leadership challenges may become more considerable in virtual settings ( Malhotra et al . , 2007 ; Morgeson et al . , 2010 ) due to the presence of physical cultural , and temporal dispersions ( Leonard , 2011 ) . Leadership ability to successfully influence a team member to maintain commitment in achieving team goals is an important requirement of leader effectiveness ( Yukl & Tracey , Journal Design + Built The Impact of Virtual Team Characteristics on Project Effectiveness _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 7 1992 ) . However , it is depending on the situation to prove that specific leadership pulled from the leader’s repertoire is appropriate to the circumstances at hand ( Stott and Walker , 1995 ) . Effective leaders are also able to adapt their behaviors and employ the needed skills in ways that influence subordinates and improve productivity and morale ( Kipnis et al . , 1980 ) . Leaders that able to demonstrate both people - oriented and task - oriented leadership roles are more effective than those who tend to focus solely on one relationship function ( Quinn , 1988 ; Hart & Quinn , 1993 ) . Leadership effectiveness is depending on the direct interaction of the leader with team members in the processes of team development and performances management ( Fleishman et al . , 1991 ; Kozlowski et al . , 1996 ) . When the leadership effectiveness taking places it will produce positive outcomes , for instance , the research conducted indicates that leadership effectiveness is linked to greater team member satisfaction and performance ( Kayworth & Leidner 2001 ) . The technical knowledge skills and communication skills that able to explain to team with clear , engaging way are expected from the effective leaders ( Hackman & Waltron , 1986 ) . The set of skills for a leader to provide clear guidance and goals facilitates the members to observe and evaluate their own performance in the team ( Kozlowski , 1998 ) ; also with effective leadership , team members able to fully utilized team processes in order to control team performance ( Zaccaro & Burke , 1998 ) . In addition , with leadership effectiveness presence it will able to cultivate team innovation ( Somech , 2006 ) . The team outcomes are depending on the nature of leadership ( Fjermestead & Hiltz , 1999 ) , as shown that teams with the effective leaders are able to maximize the team performance . While , Shachaf & Hara ( 2005 ) suggest four dimensions of effective virtual team leadership : 1 . Communication ( the leader provides continuous feedback , engages in regular and prompt communication , and clarifies tasks ) ; 2 . Understanding ( the leader is sensitive to schedules of members , appreciates their opinions and suggestions , cares about member’s problems , gets to know them , and expresses a personal interest in them ) ; 3 . Role clarity ( the leader clearly defines responsibilities of all members , exercises authority , and mentors virtual team members ) ; and 4 . Leadership attitude ( the leader is assertive yet not too “bossy , ” caring , relates to members at their own levels , and maintains a consistent attitude over the life of the project ) . The Big Five Personality Traits The relevant characteristics of virtual team using a widely - employed model of individual personality behavior which often referred to as the big five are extraversion , openness , conscientiousness , agreeableness and neuroticism . Extraversion represents the tendency to be sociable , assertive , and active , and to experience positive effects , such as energy and passion ( Watson & Clark , 1997 ) . Agreeableness refers to the tendency to be gullible , compliant , caring , and gentle ( Digman , 1990 ) . Conscientiousness is comprised of two related facets : a behavioral organizing or task - orientation element and an element of prudence . ( John , 1992 ) . Neuroticism or emotional stability refers to the tendency to demonstrate poor emotional adjustment and experience negative effects , such as nervousness , lack of self - confidence , and aggression . As a final point , openness to experience represents a character to be imaginative , out of the ordinary , open to ideas , and unconventional ( McCrae & Costa , 1997 ) .

Lurey and Raisinghani ( 2001 ) , studied the factors contribute to the effectiveness of virtual teams and the results specify that the processes used by the team and their relationships were most convincing related to team effectiveness . This remark has caused little surprise since effectiveness was defined as team performance and member satisfaction . Edward and Sridhar ( 2003 ) verified from their study that the technologies’ facilitate trust among the team members , and well - defined task structure and processes were positively associated with the effectiveness , and trust level of global virtual teams . Costigan and Berman ( 1998 ) stated that trust is related to the perceived effectiveness of the reward practices of the organization . The researchers indicate that in positively influencing the effectiveness of traditional teams , trust is one of the main factors even though there is a limited studies of the trust on the team performance ( Bromiley & Cummings , 1995 ) . The general effect of trust has been proper documented . With high level of trust , it able to reduce interpersonal transaction costs ( Handy , 1995 ) , improvement security in relationships , facilitate open information sharing ( Larzelere & Huston , 1980 ) , promote risk taking ( McAllister , 1995 ) and contribute to the well - being of individuals and enable well balance stability of organizations ( Cook & Wall , 1980 ) . Morgan and Hunt ( 1994 ) stated that trusting work relationships influenced cooperation , reduced conflicts , increased commitment to the organization and reduced the tendency to leave . Adapting to new environment from co - locations to virtual is long processes that pose many challenges of misfit and trials scenarios . This is seen as encouraging factor for teams moving from co - location to virtual environments , an ability to adapt and change can be a long process riddled with trial and error scenarios . This process is seen as crucial in the effectiveness of the team ( Kirkman et a l . , 2002 ) . Hertel et al . ( 2005 ) collected a list of criteria from the team managers both at the individual and at the team level . The results of the field study showed good reliability of the task work - related attributes , teamwork - related attributes , and attributes related to tele - cooperative work . In the application of organizational effectiveness , checking thoroughly trust as a bellwether has no substitute . Cook and Wall ( 1980 ) study proves that “trust between individuals and groups within organizations are a highly important ingredient in the long - term stability of the organization and the well - being of its members” ( p . 39 ) . In this study , it will attempt to determine how important personality and leadership give an impact of effectiveness of the virtual team success within Malaysia ICT companies . METHODOLOGY The section describes the case study , the study design , data collection methods , and data analysis methods used in this study . The discussion extends to the criteria of respondents’ selection , identification of study population as well as data transformation techniques . Generally , the study adopted qualitative data collection . The case study of a construction company in Klang Valley is selected for it is well - known as one of the most active main construction company for projects in urban areas . The targeted population for the study will be those who involved in construction projects for more than 5 years and play the role as key personnel in construction projects . This included those in project , procurement , information technology , planning and design departments within the company .

Respondents were selected randomly from 49 staffs as research population , based on criteria set as mentioned above . According to Kelley et al . ( 2003 ) , random sampling allows the results to be generalized to the larger population . By using this sampling method , every member of a large population has an equal chance to be selected for sampling , which therefore eliminates bias in sampling . This sampling technique is popular for conducting surveys and one of the advantages is that this technique provides a better population representation , reducing bias in sampling and is considered easy to handle ( Kelley et al . , 2003 ) . The responses from the survey were analyzed using analysis packages namely Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS ) for descriptive statistics results . Descriptive statistics provide information regarding the measurement of central tendency ( mean , mode and median ) and standard deviation . The data are shown in tables and graphic forms , which provide a complete view of the profile of the findings with the percentage of responses given to each point on the Likert scale . Sekaran and Bougie ( 2013 ) noted that descriptive analysis could provide general overview on what is happening in research finding . Respondents are required to make an appropriate option for each statement submitted by Likert Scale 4 points . As usual , before conducting the data collection , researchers obtained consent from relevant parties such as management of the company and the respondents themselves . After a week researcher managed to collect all 30 responses to form a database for analysis . Summary from the literature search , Figure 1 below conceptualizes a relationship between “team leader” , “team member” and “virtual team effectiveness” in managing a project under virtual team . Figure 1 : Conceptual Framework DATA COLLECTION AND DISCUSSION A brief description of the participants are listed in Table 3 .
