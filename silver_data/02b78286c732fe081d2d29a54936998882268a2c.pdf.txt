Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 087411 Summary Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for cell morphology and migration . mDia is an actin nucleator that produces unbranched actin filaments downstream of Rho . However , the mechanisms by which mDia activity is regulated in the cell remain unknown . We pulled down Liprin - a as an mDia - binding protein . The binding is mediated through the central region of Liprin - a and through the N - terminal Dia - inhibitory domain ( DID ) and dimerization domain ( DD ) of mDia . Liprin - a competes with Dia autoregulatory domain ( DAD ) for binding to DID , and binds preferably to the open form of mDia . Overexpression of a Liprin - a fragment containing the mDia - binding region decreases localization of mDia to the plasma membrane and attenuates the Rho – mDia - mediated formation of stress fibers in cultured cells . Conversely , depletion of Liprin - a by RNA interference ( RNAi ) increases the amount of mDia in the membrane fraction and enhances formation of actin stress fibers . Thus , Liprin - a negatively regulates the activity of mDia in the cell by displacing it from the plasma membrane through binding to the DID - DD region . Key words : Actin cytoskeleton , mDia , Rho , Liprin - a Introduction Temporal and spatial remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell morphology , polarity , migration and cytokinesis . One of the key molecules that regulate actin remodeling is the small GTPase Rho . Rho shuttles between the inactive GDP - bound form and the active GTP - bound form , and works as a molecular switch in actin remodeling in response to both extra - and intracellular stimuli ( Hall , 2005 ) . Mammalian homolog of Diaphanous ( mDia ) , a group of formins , is one of the Rho effectors , and is involved in the Rho - mediated assembly of actin stress fibers ( Watanabe et al . , 1999 ; Hotulainen and Lappalainen , 2006 ) , the formation of the contractile ring ( Watanabe et al . , 2008 ) , and formation of filopodia ( Schirenbeck et al . , 2005 ) . Formins comprise a large family that is conserved from yeast to mammals . More than 30 formins have been described to date , with more than 15 members in vertebrates ( Higgs , 2005 ) . Formins are characterized by the presence of the highly conserved formin homology ( FH ) 1 and 2 domains and produce unbranched , long actin filaments . The FH2 domain catalyzes de novo actin nucleation and polymerization , being persistently associated with the barbed end of nascent filaments and protecting them from capping proteins ( Moseley et al . , 2004 ; Higgs , 2005 ; Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . The adjacent FH1 domain recruits profilin – actin complexes and accelerates filament elongation . In addition to these domains , mDia contains GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) , Dia - inhibitory domain ( DID ) , dimerization domain ( DD ) and coiled - coil ( CC ) domain in the N - terminus , and Dia autoregulatory domain ( DAD ) in the C - terminus ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . mDia is auto - inhibited via an intramolecular interaction between DID and DAD , which inhibits the ability of FH1 - FH2 to nucleate and elongate actin filaments in vitro and in vivo . Binding of GTP - bound Rho to GBD disrupts this intramolecular interaction and leads to activation of mDia ( Watanabe et al . , 1999 ) . Activated mDia then induces actin polymerization through the FH1 - FH2 domain . Intriguingly , whereas purified formins remain bound to and elongate the barbed end for many minutes to produce long filaments ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002 ; Higashida et al . , 2004 ) , actin cables and the cytokinetic ring assembled by yeast formins in vivo are comprised of relatively short filaments of 0 . 3 – 2 . 3 m m in length ( Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ; Kamasaki et al . , 2007 ) . These findings indicate that the ability of mDia is crucially regulated in the cell . Notably , release of auto - inhibition by activated Rho is suggested to induce not only actin polymerizing activity but also membrane localization of mDia in the cell ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . Because endogenous mDia1 , although sometimes enriched at the extended edge of cells , is mainly distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm ( Watanabe et al . 1997 ; Brandt et al . , 2007 ) , membrane targeting of mDia molecules has been studied using truncation fragments . Such studies have revealed that the membrane localization of mDia is mediated through its DID - DD - CC domains in addition to its binding to Rho ( Seth et al . , 2006 ; Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Watanabe et al . , 2010 ; Gorelik et al . , 2011 ) . These results suggest that , in addition to regulation by Rho , the activity and localization of mDia are regulated by its interaction with DID - binding proteins . This possibility is also suggested by the fact that N - terminally truncated mutants of mDia lacking DID , such as mDia1 D N3 , expressed in the cell produce longer 108 Research Article J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e filaments than does full - length mDia1 ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ; Higashida et al . , 2008 ) . To search for such DID - binding proteins , we carried out a pull - down assay with an N - terminal mDia1 fragment as the bait . We have identified Liprin - a as an mDia - interacting protein , and found that this protein regulates the membrane localization of mDia through direct binding to the DID - DD region , and modulates the amount of actin filaments in the cell .

Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 1 ) 110 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Results Identification of Liprin - a as an mDia - binding protein To identify proteins that interact with mDia1 , we used a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion of an N - terminal GBD - DID - DD fragment of mDia1 , amino acids 69 – 451 ( mDia1 N ) ( Rose et al . , 2005 ) , as bait , and performed a pull - down assay ( Fig . 1A ) . This procedure specifically pulled down a 160 kDa protein from the S100 fraction of the mouse brain ( Fig . 1B ) . This protein retained the interaction with up to 200 mM NaCl washing ( data not shown ) . Mass spectrometry of digests of the protein identified 18 peptides that are all present in Liprin - a 3 ( Fig . 1C ) . Liprin - a is a protein enriched in synaptic structures , and consists of isoforms 1 – 4 in mammals ( Serra - Pages et al . , 1995 ; Serra - Pages et al . , 1998 ; Spangler and Hoogenraad , 2007 ) . Immunoblot analysis , using antibodies to Liprin - a 1 and Liprin - a 3 , revealed that GST – mDia1 N pulled down not only Liprin - a 3 but also Liprin - a 1 ( supplementary material Fig . S1A ) from the brain S100 fraction . Furthermore , mDia1 N D G , an N - terminal fragment containing DID - DD without GBD , also interacted with both Liprin - a isoforms ( Fig . 1D ) , suggesting that GBD is dispensable for binding to Liprin - a . An antibody to mDia1 ( Watanabe et al . , 1997 ) co - immunoprecipitated endogenous Liprin - a isoforms from mouse brain lysate ( Fig . 1E ) and 293F cell lysate ( Fig . 1F ) , verifying endogenous interaction of the two proteins . mDia directly binds to Liprin - a 3 through its central region Liprin - a isoforms consist of an approximately 800 amino acid - long coiled - coil domain in the N - terminus , followed by three consecutive sterile alpha motif ( SAM ) domains in the C - terminus ( Spangler and Hoogenraad , 2007 ) . To characterize the domain in Liprin - a that interacts with mDia1 , a series of FLAG - tagged deletion mutants of Liprin - a 3 ( Fig . 2A ) were expressed with GFP – mDia1 N D G in HeLa cells , and subjected to immunoprecipitation . In this assay , GFP – mDia1 N D G co - precipitated FLAG - tagged full - length ( FL ) Liprin - a 3 ( Fig . 2B ) , and , conversely , FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( FL ) co - precipitated GFP – mDia1 N D G ( supplementary material Fig . S1B ) . Under these conditions , GFP – mDia1 N D G co - precipitated the Liprin - a 3 fragments of amino acids 1 – 817 , 217 – 817 and 417 – 817 but not those of amino acids 817 – 1194 ( Fig . 2B ) . No precipitation was found with the fragments of amino acids 1 – 217 or 617 – 817 ( Fig . 2B ) . GFP alone did not precipitate any Liprin - a 3 proteins ( supplementary material Fig . S1C ) . We then expressed the N - terminal domain of mDia2 or mDia3 with FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 217 – 817 ) , and examined the interaction . Liprin - a 3 ( 217 – 817 ) also precipitated GFP – mDia2 N D G and GFP – mDia3 N D G ( Fig . 2C ) . These results indicate that all three mDia isoforms interact with Liprin - a 3 through their DID - DD regions . To examine whether mDia1 and Liprin - a 3 directly interact , we prepared recombinant mDia1 N and Liprin - a 3 ( 417 – 817 ) . However , the latter protein underwent proteolytic degradation during preparation and so we chopped it to Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) , which was prepared as a single band protein on SDS - PAGE . Using these proteins , we first performed analytical gel filtration . We prepared mDia1 N ( 44 kDa ) and Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) ( 30 kDa ) proteins separately , and incubated 150 m g of Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) with 150 m g of mDia1 N for 30 minutes at 4 ˚ C . We then applied either this incubation mixture or 150 m g each of either protein to a Sephadex G200 column for gel filtration . Whereas Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) or mDia1 N applied alone were eluted in a single peak at the elution volume of 12 ml ( estimated relative molecular mass , Mr , 195 kDa ) or 13 ml ( estimated Mr 130 kDa ) , respectively , the incubation mixture of these proteins yielded a new protein peak at the elution volume of 11 ml ( estimated Mr 300 kDa ) as well as the aforementioned two peaks ( Fig . 2D ) . Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( CBB ) staining of the fractions detected Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) and mDia1 N , with a protein ratio of 1 : 1 in the peak fractions of the mixture ( Fig . 2D ) . Given the estimated Mr , these results indicate that mDia1 N and Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) made a tetramer – tetramer complex . We next used surface plasmon resonance to measure the binding affinity between GST – Liprin - a 3 and mDia1 N . Because Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) adhered to the sensor tip , we prepared Liprin - a 3 ( 671 – 737 ) to use instead . Although a larger protein including this sequence , Liprin - a 3 ( 617 – 817 ) , did not precipitate with mDia1 N D G in the coexpression experiment ( Fig . 2B ) , Liprin - a 3 ( 671 – 737 ) interacted weakly with mDia1 N on BIAcore . The association ( k a ) and dissociation ( k d ) rate constants and the equilibrium dissociation constant ( K D ) of binding of GST – Liprin - a 3 ( 671 – 737 ) and mDia1 N were 2 . 04 6 10 4 M – 1 second - 1 , 0 . 021 second – 1 and 1 . 03 6 10 2 6 M , respectively . Liprin - a preferably binds to the open form of mDia To further confirm direct binding of mDia1 and Liprin - a 3 , we incubated GST – mDia1 N D G or GST and Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) in vitro , and precipitated GST proteins with glutathione ( GSH ) Sepharose . GST – mDia1 N D G specifically pulled down Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . The Liprin - a - binding domain of mDia1 defined above contains DID , which serves as a binding site for DAD . A256D ( alanine 256 changed to aspartic acid ) and I259D ( isoleucine 259 to aspartic acid ) mutations in DID affects its binding to DAD in vitro ( Lammers et al . , 2005 ) . We therefore examined the effect of these DID mutations on Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) binding . Whereas wild - type mDia1 N D G effectively pulled down Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) , the mDia1 N D G ( A256D ) and mDia1 N D G ( I259D ) precipitated markedly less amounts of Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . These results indicate that alanine 256 and isoleucine 259 are important in binding of mDia1 , not Fig . 2 . Liprin - a directly binds to mDia through its central region . ( A ) Representation of Liprin - a 3 and truncation mutants . All constructs were tagged with FLAG epitope at the N - terminus except for 457 – 737 and 671 – 737 that were tagged with GST and used in gel filtration after GST cleavage and BIAcore , respectively . Amino acid numbers for the N - and C - terminal residues of each mutant protein are shown . ( B ) Identification of the mDia - binding domain in Liprin - a 3 . GFP – mDia1 N D G was expressed in HeLa cells together with each of the indicated FLAG – Liprin - a 3 proteins . The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - GFP antibody . The immunoprecipitates ( IP , right panels ) as well as lysates ( Input , left panels ) were analyzed by immunoblotting ( IB ) with anti - GFP antibody and anti - FLAG antibody . ( C ) Interaction of all three mDia isoforms with Liprin - a . GFP – mDia1 N D G , GFP – mDia2 N D G or GFP – mDia3 N D G were expressed with FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 217 – 817 ) in HeLa cells , and immunoprecipitation was performed as described for B . ( D ) Analytical gel filtration . Recombinant proteins of Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) and mDia1 N were prepared and either used separately or incubated in equal amounts . mDia1 N alone ( dashed line ) , Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) alone ( broken line ) or the incubation mixture ( solid line ) was loaded on a Superdex G200 10 / 30 column and protein elution was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm ( upper panel ) . The column was calibrated with ferritin , aldolase , conalubumin and ovalubumin . Lower panels show CBB staining of indicated fractions for indicated proteins . Liprin - a binds and regulates mDIA 111 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Fig . 3 . Liprin - a preferably binds to the open form of mDia . ( A ) A256D and I259D mutations impair binding of mDia1 N D G to Liprin - a 3 . Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) was incubated with either GST or GST – mDia1 N D G , GST – mDia1 N D G ( A256D ) or GST – mDia1 N D G ( I259D ) conjugated to GSH Sepharose beads . Co - precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and CBB staining . ( B ) Fluorescence polarization assay . FITC - labeled mDia1 - DAD peptide ( 1175 – 1196 ) was mixed with indicated concentrations of recombinant mDia1 N and then with Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) and the fluorescence polarization was measured . ( C ) Liprin - a 3 binds to an open form of mDia1 . GFP – mDia1 ( FL ) or GFP – mDia1 ( FL ) ( V161D , M1182D ) was expressed in HeLa cells with FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) , FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( FL ) or FLAG . Immunoprecipitation was performed with FLAG affinity gel . Immunoprecipitates ( IP , right panels ) as well as lysates ( Input , left panels ) were analyzed by immunoblotting ( IB ) with anti - GFP and anti - FLAG antibodies . ( D ) Impaired binding of Liprin - a 3 to mDia1 N in complex with GTP c S – RhoA . GST or GST – mDia1 N conjugated to GSH Sepharose beads were pre - incubated with GDP – RhoA or GTP c S – RhoA , followed by incubation with Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) , and precipitated . Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by CBB staining . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 1 ) 112 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e only to DAD but also to Liprin - a , and suggest that binding sites in DID of mDia1 for DAD and Liprin - a 3 might overlap . To test this , we performed fluorescent polarization assays . Polarization of a fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labeled 22 - mer DAD peptide ( amino acids 1175 – 1196 ) was strongly increased after addition of a threefold excess of mDia1 N as a result of the decreased mobility of the higher molecular mass DAD – mDia1 N complex , as first described by Rose et al . ( Rose et al . , 2005 ) . The addition of a ninefold excess of Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) over DAD to this reaction quickly reduced the polarization ( Fig . 3B ) , suggesting that Liprin - a competed with DAD for binding to mDia1 N and released DAD from the mDia1 N . We then wondered whether Liprin - a binds to the inactive , closed form of mDia by disrupting the intramolecular interaction between DID and DAD . To test this , we co - transfected HeLa cells with either pEGFP – mDia1 ( FL ) or pEGFP – mDia1 ( FL ) ( V161D , M1182D ) and either p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) or p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( FL ) , and performed immunoprecipitation using an anti - FLAG antibody . The mutations at valine 161 and methionine 1182 interfere with the Rho binding and the DID – DAD interaction , respectively ( Lammers et al . , 2005 ; Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . Expression of the V161D , M1182D mutant strongly induced thin stress fibers ( Fig . 4B ) , indicating that this mutant is the active open form of mDia . Both FLAG - tagged Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) and Liprin - a 3 ( FL ) effectively precipitated the mDia1 mutant , but wild - type mDia1 to much lesser extent ( Fig . 3C ) . These results suggest that Liprin - a does not effectively bind to the closed form of mDia by displacing DAD from DID , but preferably binds to Fig . 4 . Overexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) reduces formation of Rho - induced actin stress fibers in HeLa cells . ( A ) Reduction in formation of actin stress fibers by overexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were transfected with either p3 6 FLAG or p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) , fixed and stained with anti - FLAG antibody ( upper panels ) and Texas - Red – phalloidin ( lower panels ) . Arrowheads indicate cells expressing FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) . ( B ) Reduction of Rho – mDia - induced stress fibers by overexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were transfected with indicated plasmids with or without p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) , fixed and stained with anti - FLAG antibody ( supplementary material Fig . S2D ) and Alexa - Fluor - 647 - labeled phalloidin ( lower panels ) . GFP fluorescence is shown in upper panels . ( C ) Effects of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) expression on F - actin intensity . The fluorescence intensity of phalloidin staining of transfected cells in each experiment in B was quantitatively compared by normalizing it to that of non - transfected cells in the same experiment ( see Materials and Methods ) . Each column shows the mean + s . e . m . of the number of cells indicated above the column . The results are representative of at least three independent experiments . ( D ) Effects of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) expression on the long / short axis ratio of cells . HeLa cells were transfected with indicated combination of plasmids , and the ratio of the long / short axis was determined using ImageJ software . The number of cells analyzed is indicated above each column . The results are from three independent experiments . * P , 0 . 05 and * * P , 0 . 01 for indicated comparison . { P , 0 . 05 and { P , 0 . 01 compared with GFP - expressing cells . Scale bars : 20 m m . Liprin - a binds and regulates mDIA 113 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e mDia that has been pre - opened by activated Rho . We therefore examined possible formation of a ternary complex of mDia1 , Liprin - a and RhoA . GST fusion of mDia1 N bound to GSH Sepharose was incubated with GDP – RhoA or GTP c S – RhoA . After several washes , Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) were added , incubated for 30 minutes and pulled down with the beads . Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) was pulled down with GST – mDia1 N pre - incubated with GDP – RhoA , but not with GST – mDia1 N in complex with GTP c S – RhoA ( Fig . 3D ) . These results suggest that , although Liprin - a preferably binds to the open form of mDia , it does not form a ternary complex with GTP – RhoA and mDia . Overexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) reduces formation of Rho - induced stress fibers in HeLa cells Given that mDia catalyzes actin polymerization ( Watanabe and Higashida , 2004 ) , we examined the effect of Liprin - a expression on the actin cytoskeleton in cells . We expressed FLAG - tagged Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4A ) , and compared the actin cytoskeleton of transfected cells with that of untransfected cells by staining with Texas - Red – phalloidin . Expression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) decreased formation of stress fibers and peripheral actin filaments , and reduced the number and size of focal adhesions ( Fig . 4A ; supplementary material Fig . S2A – C ) . Some cells exhibited spread morphology , often with concave or hollow spaces in their cell body , and underwent apoptosis . Consistent with the decrease in number of stress fibers , significant decrease in the actin fluorescence intensity compared with control cells was observed ( Fig . 4C ) . By contrast , expression of FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 417 ) lacking the mDia - binding domain had no effect on the actin cytoskeleton ( data not shown ) , indicating that Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) suppressed endogenous actin filament formation through mDia binding . We then examined the effects of expression of this Liprin - a 3 fragment on stress fibers induced by a constitutively active RhoA mutant , V14RhoA . We coexpressed Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) with V14RhoA in HeLa cells , and examined their actin cytoskeleton . Expression of V14RhoA induced thick stress fibers in HeLa cells as reported ( Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ) . Coexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) markedly decreased formation of stress fibers induced by the RhoA mutant ( Fig . 4B ) . The fluorescence intensity in the cells coexpressing the Liprin - a 3 fragment and V14RhoA was significantly reduced compared with that found in the cells transfected with V14RhoA alone ( Fig . 4C ) . We next expressed GFP – mDia1 D N3 that lacked the N - terminal Liprin - a - binding domain or GFP – mDia1 ( FL ) ( V161D , M1182D ) ( Fig . 1A ) with or without FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) in HeLa cells , and compared the actin phenotype of these cells . Expression of both mDia1 mutants induced elongation of HeLa cells , where thin stress fibers were aligned along the long axis of the cells ( Fig . 4B , D ) ( Watanabe et al . , 1999 ) . Notably , coexpression with FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) remarkably reduced the formation of stress fibers induced by GFP – mDia1 ( FL ) ( V161D , M1182D ) but not that by mDia1 D N3 ( Fig . 4B ; supplementary material Fig . S2D ) . Consistently , expression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) significantly decreased the actin fluorescence intensity and attenuated elongation of cells induced by mDia1 ( FL ) ( V161D , M1182D ) , but the increased actin fluorescence intensity and elongation induced by mDia1 D N3 was not significantly affected by expression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) ( Fig . 4C , D ) . These results suggest that suppression of stress fiber formation by Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) depends on its binding to mDia . Depletion of Liprin - a increases formation of actin fibers in cultured cells The above results indicate that endogenous Liprin - a negatively regulates the mDia - mediated formation of actin fibers in cells . We examined this issue first in HeLa cells . HeLa cells express both Liprin - a 1 and Liprin - a 3 ( Fig . 5A ; supplementary material Fig . S3A ) . We transfected HeLa cells with short interfering RNAs ( siRNA ) against Liprin - a 1 ( either # 1 or # 2 ) and Liprin - a 3 ( either # 1 or # 2 ) , with four different combinations of these siRNAs , or with scrambled control siRNA . Transfection efficiency of siRNA in these experiments , as determined by Block - iT Red fluorescent Oligo , was almost 100 % ( data not shown ) . Treatment with each siRNA for Liprin - a 1 , Liprin - a 3 or their combinations specifically suppressed the expression of respective Liprin - a isoforms to an almost negligible amount at 48 hours , except for siRNA for Liprin - a 3 ( # 2 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . We then stained the cells with Texas - Red – phalloidin and anti - vinculin antibody . The depletion of each Liprin - a isoform did not apparently change the cell shape , but markedly increased the number of stress fibers and increased the number and size of focal adhesions ( Fig . 5B ; supplementary material Fig . S3B – D ) . Although some clusters of cells subjected to RNA interference ( RNAi ) for either Liprin - a 1 or Liprin - a 3 did not show the enhanced actin phenotype , combined RNAi for Liprin - a 1 and Liprin - a 3 increased the number of clusters of cells showing the phenotype . We then examined whether depletion of human mDia1 suppresses the phenotype caused by Liprin - a 1 depletion . Depletion of endogenous mDia1 induced a slight loss of stress fibers , and prevented the enhanced formation of actin fibers induced by depletion of Liprin - a 1 ( Fig . 5B ) . To quantify the F - actin fluorescence intensity , we compared the F - actin intensity of cells depleted of Liprin - a s with that of non - transfected cells . Quantitative analysis showed that depletion of Liprin - a s enhanced the F - actin intensity , and that this enhancement was abolished by the depletion of mDia1 ( Fig . 5C ) . The cells treated with siRNA for Liprin - a 3 ( # 2 ) did not show significantly enhanced formation of F - actin ( Fig . 5C ) , probably because of its poor depletion efficiency ( Fig . 5A ) . These results suggest that Liprin - a negatively regulates the mDia - mediated formation of actin fibers and that the two isoforms exert this function redundantly in HeLa cells . Enhanced formation of stress fibers by Liprin - a depletion and its attenuation by additional depletion of mDia1 were also observed in NIH 3T3 cells ( supplementary material Fig . S4 ) . Liprin - a s regulate the membrane localization of mDia through binding to the DID - DD region It is proposed that mDia isoforms are maintained in an inactive state in the cytosol and recruited to the plasma membrane upon activation ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . To examine membrane translocation of mDia1 , we prepared the cytosol and the membrane fractions from HeLa cells at various times after stimulation with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , and analyzed the amount of endogenous mDia1 in each fraction by immunoblotting . We found that mDia1 was recruited to the membrane fraction upon stimulation ( Fig . 6A ) . We next examined whether Rho mediates mDia1 translocation to the membrane by expressing V14RhoA in HeLa cells . The amount of mDia1 in the membrane fraction was increased in the cells expressing V14RhoA compared with that in control Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 1 ) 114 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Fig . 5 .

Liprin - a binds and regulates mDIA 115 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e cells expressing GFP ( Fig . 6B ) . This Rho - mediated membrane accumulation of mDia1 was suppressed by coexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) ( Fig . 6B ) . We then examined the effect of Liprin - a depletion on the membrane enrichment of mDia in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA or a combination of siRNAs against Liprin - a 1 and Liprin - a 3 . After 48 hours , the cells were collected and the amount of mDia1 in the membrane was examined . The cells depleted of Liprin - a s showed significant enrichment of mDia1 in the membrane fraction compared with the control cells ( Fig . 6C ) . The above results together suggest that Liprin - a controls the membrane localization of mDia through its binding . We corroborated this action by using immunofluorescence to examine membrane targeting of the mDia N - terminal fragments containing the DID - DD - CC region ( Seth et al . , 2006 ; Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Ramalingam et al . , 2010 ; Gorelik et al . , 2011 ) . We expressed GFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) and its A256D or I259D mutant in HeLa cells and examined the localization . When GFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) or the A256D or I259D mutants were expressed alone , they localized to the membrane of the extended edge of cells located at the periphery of the cell cluster ( Fig . 7A ) . The mean percentage of cells showing this localization in the cells expressing these constructs was about 43 , 69 and 64 % , respectively ( Fig . 7B ) . However , when these fragments were coexpressed with Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) , only the membrane localization of GFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) was significantly attenuated ( Fig . 7A , right panels ) , with 29 % of cells showing the membrane localization ( Fig . 7B ) . These results support our hypothesis that Liprin - a regulates membrane localization of mDia1 through binding to its DID - DD region . Fig . 6 .

Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 1 ) 116 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Discussion In this study , we used GST – mDia1 N as the bait and pulled down Liprin - a 3 as an mDia1 - binding protein from the mouse brain lysates ( Fig . 1B ) . Immunoprecipitation confirmed interaction of endogenous mDia1 with not only Liprin - a 3 but also Liprin - a 1 ( Fig . 1E , F ) . Immunoprecipitation analysis ( Fig . 2C ) demonstrated that all of the three mDia isoforms can bind Liprin - a 3 . The binding site in mDia1 for Liprin - a 3 is localized in its DID - DD domain and apparently overlaps with that for DAD ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Although Liprin - a preferentially binds to an open , active form of mDia ( Fig . 3C ) , it cannot form a ternary complex with mDia and GTP – RhoA ( Fig . 3D ) , indicating that Liprin - a binds to the open form of mDia after GTP – RhoA dissociates from it . Overexpression of the mDia1 - binding domain of Liprin - a and RNAi experiments suggest that Liprin - a regulates the amounts of Rho – mDia - mediated actin stress fibers in the cells ( Figs 4 , 5 ) . Furthermore , biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis suggest that Liprin - a controls mDia1 localization in the plasma membrane ( Figs 6 , 7 ) . A large body of evidence suggests that Diaphanous - related formins ( DRFs ) , including mDia isoforms , stay in the cytosol in an auto - inhibited form through DID - DAD binding and that binding of GTP – Rho to their GBD activates DRFs by disrupting the intramolecular interaction . The DRFs are then recruited to the plasma membrane or other subcellular localization for function through the N - terminal region . Seth and co - workers showed that N - terminal fragments containing GBD , DID and DD regions of mDia and FRL a can localize to the membrane in RAW cells ( Seth et al . , 2006 ) . They also showed that Rho - binding defective mutants of these fragments still localized to the membrane in a Fig . 7 . Membrane localization of GFP – mDia1 - DID - DD - CC in HeLa cells and its suppression by overexpression of Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) . ( A ) Immunofluorescence . HeLa cells were transfected with either pEGFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) encompassing the DID - DD - CC region , pEGFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) ( A256D ) or pEGFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) ( I259D ) together with p3 6 FLAG or p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) and cultured for 18 hours . The cells were fixed with 10 % TCA , and stained with anti - GFP and anti - FLAG antibodies . Each image represents a single focal plane of GFP staining . Arrowheads indicate cells expressing FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) . Scale bar : 20 m m . ( B ) Quantitative analysis of membrane localization of GFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) . Experiments were performed as described in A . The percentage of cells showing the membrane localization of the GFP signal in each group was determined by dividing their number by the total number of cells expressing GFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) or mutants . The results are from four independent experiments , in each of which more than 50 cells were examined . * P , 0 . 05 , * * P , 0 . 01 compared with cells expressing GFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) . Liprin - a binds and regulates mDIA 117 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e saturating manner but to a lesser degree , indicating that the membrane localization of mDia1 and FRL a is mediated by both Rho - dependent and Rho - independent interactions and that the latter is through DID binding to unknown partners on the membrane . Brandt and co - workers reported that IQGAP1 binds to the FH3 of mDia1 , containing DID - DD - CC regions , and mediates mDia1 localization to the leading edge of migrating cells and the phagocytic cup ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , Gorelik and colleagues assessed the contribution to membrane targeting of mDia2 of each of the N - terminal basic domains , GBD , DID , DD or CC region and concluded that these regions collectively contribute to plasma membrane localization ( Gorelik et al . , 2011 ) . These results suggest that binding to the membrane through N - terminal regions is important for the localization and function of mDia proteins , and can be a regulatory step for their function . Our findings that Liprin - a binds to the DID of mDia isoforms , displaces mDia1 from the membrane , and regulates the amount of F - actin in the cell suggest that Liprin - a competes for DID binding with binding protein ( s ) on the membrane , and induces inactivation of mDia isoforms by membrane dissociation . We propose this as one of the regulatory mechanisms by which mDia controls stress fiber formation in the cell . Many actin structures produced by formins in the cell ( such as stress fibers , actin cables and the contractile ring ) are comprised of relatively short actin filaments ( 0 . 3 – 2 . 3 m m ) ( Cramer et al . , 1997 ; Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ; Kamasaki et al . , 2007 ) . However , purified formins can produce long , often up to 30 m m , actin filaments in vitro ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2009 ) . It has therefore been questioned how the length of formin - mediated actin filaments is regulated in the cell ( Chesarone et al , 2010 ) . Thus far , three formin - binding proteins with inhibitory actions have been identified . They are mammalian Dia - interacting protein ( DIP ) , Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bud14 and Drosophila melanogaster spire ( Chesarone et al . , 2009 ; Eisenmann et al . 2007 ; Quinlan et al . , 2007 ) , all of which inhibit formin - mediated actin polymerization by blocking the FH2 domain . By contrast , Liprin - a targets DID and regulates mDia activity by displacing it from the cell membrane . Such a DID - mediated regulatory mechanism might be consistent with the fact that expression of N - terminally truncated mDia1 mutants lacking DID ( such as mDia1 D N3 ) induces long actin filaments in the cell ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ) . Liprin - a was first identified as an interacting protein of the leukocyte common antigen - related ( LAR ) family of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ( Serra - Pages et al . , 1995 ) and suggested to be involved in LAR distribution and clustering ( Serra - Pages et al . , 1998 ) . Recent studies have shown that depletion of endogenous Liprin - a 1 decreases migration and spreading of cultured cells , whereas the overexpression of the protein increased cell migration and spreading ( Shen et al . , 2007 ; Asperti et al . , 2009 ) . Such action of Liprin - a in cell migration might be consistent with our findings on its role in mDia regulation . Depletion of Liprin - a enhances Rho - mediated formation of focal adhesions ( this study ) , and enhanced Rho activity interferes with cell migration ( Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ) . Given that mDia1 is also required for cell migration ( Yamana et al . , 2006 ) , these results suggest that Liprin - a regulates the activity of mDia1 spatiotemporally in the cell to a proper level for migration . The functions of Liprin - a in neuronal cells have also been reported . In Drosophila , both the Liprin - a homolog Dliprin - a and LAR homolog Dlar localize in the presynapse at the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) , and both mutants display a decrease in the number of synaptic boutons , an increase in the lengthening of active zones and a reduction in synaptic vesicle release at the NMJ ( Kaufmann et al . , 2002 ) . Epistasis analysis showed that Dliprin - a is required for the action of Dlar at the synapse , indicating that Dliprin - a and Dlar cooperatively regulate the synaptic growth at the NMJ . Recently , Pawson and co - workers reported that Drosophila Diaphanous also localizes in presynapses at NMJ and that Diaphanous mutants showed a decrease in synaptic bouton number at NMJ ( Pawson et al . , 2008 ) . They also showed that Diaphanous functions downstream of Dlar and the Rho GEF trio , and regulates synaptic growth through the regulation of synaptic actin polymerization and microtubule stabilization . These findings , together with our present study , suggest that Dlar , diaphanous and Dliprin - a might all function in a single signaling pathway , and that Liprin - a might regulate synaptic growth at NMJ by regulating mDia activity and controlling reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . In summary , we have identified Liprin - a as a negative regulator of mDia1 , and possibly also of other isoforms . Analysis of this function of Liprin - a in other systems might shed a new light on how mDia - mediated actin remodeling is regulated in cell morphogenesis and in shaping of tissue architecture .

S1B , 1 m g of pEGFP – mDia1 N D G , pEGFP – mDia1 ( FL ) , pEGFP – mDia1 ( FL ) ( V161D , M1182D ) or pEGFP and 3 m g of p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( FL ) , p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) or p3 6 FLAG were mixed with 5 m l of Lipofectamine LTX in 250 m l Opti - MEM . The mixture was then added to each 60 - mm culture dish . After 18 hours , the cells were washed once with PBS and suspended in 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , containing 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM b - ME , 5 mM EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . The cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 12 , 000 g for 15 minutes at 4 ˚ C . For the experiments shown in Fig . 2B , C and supplementary material Fig . S1C , the supernatant was incubated with 10 m l of anti - GFP antibody ( MBL ) and 15 m l of Protein - A – Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) for 2 hours at 4 ˚ C .

Fluorescence polarization assay Fluorescence polarization assay using an mDia1 DAD peptide ( Rose et al . , 2005 ) was performed as described previously ( Watanabe et al . , 2010 ) . An mDia1 DAD peptide ( 1175 – 1196 ) labeled with FITC at the N - terminus was synthesized by Invitrogen . After the baseline fluorescence of 50 nM FITC - DAD was obtained , 150 nM mDia1 N was added , and fluorescence was measured with an interval of 10 seconds . At 180 seconds , 450 nM Liprin - a 3 ( 457 – 737 ) was added , and changes in polarization were recorded . Fluorescence staining analysis of F - actin and cell morphology For the overexpression experiments shown in Fig . 4 and supplementary material Fig .

The mixture was added to HeLa cells that were plated at a density of 5 6 10 4 cells per 35 - mm dish and cultured overnight in DMEM containing 10 % FCS . Cells were cultured for 16 hours , washed with PBS , and fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS . For the RNAi experiments shown in Fig . 5 and supplementary material Figs S3 and S4 , 1 m l of 20 m M siRNA was mixed with 4 m l of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) in 200 m l of Opti - MEM . HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 cells of semi - confluency were treated with trypsin – EDTA and suspended , and the siRNA mixture was added to 1 . 0 6 10 5 HeLa cells or 5 6 10 4 NIH 3T3 cells in 1 . 8 ml of the culture medium . The cells were then seeded on a cover glass , in a well of a six - well plate , and cultured for 48 hours . For quantification of F - actin fluorescence intensity , the cells were trypsinized at 24 hours after siRNA transfection , and mixed with non - transfected cells labeled with DiI ( Invitrogen ) at a ratio of 9 : 1 , and cultured for 24 hours at 37 ˚ C . The cells were washed with PBS , and fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS . Permeabilization and incubation with antibodies were performed as described ( Ishizaki et al . 2001 ) . Primary antibodies used were anti - FLAG monoclonal ( 1 : 200 ) , anti - FLAG polyclonal ( 1 : 200 ) or anti - vinculin monoclonal ( 1 : 200 ) . Secondary antibodies included Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG , Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes ) . F - actin was stained with Alexa - Fluor - 647 – phalloidin ( 1 : 100 ; Molecular Probes ) or Texas - Red – X - phalloidin ( 1 : 100 ; Molecular Probes ) . Immunofluorescence images were collected with a LSM510 confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) using an oil immersion objective lens ( Plan - Apochromat 63 6 1 . 4 NA oil DIC ) , and the 0 . 5 m m - thick optical section of the bottom was used for analysis . Quantification of F - actin intensity was performed using ImageJ software ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij ) . In brief , each transfected or non - transfected cell in the same field was outlined and the mean phalloidin fluorescence intensity was determined in each cell . The fluorescence intensity of each transfected cell was normalized by dividing the mean phalloidin fluorescence intensity of each cell by the average of those of non - transfected cells ( . 3 ) in the same field . We also used ImageJ software to determine the average of focal adhesion areas and the number of focal adhesions per cell in supplementary material Figs S2 and S3 . Briefly , each transfected cell was outlined , and thresholded images of vinculin - positive clusters were obtained . Focal adhesion areas larger than 0 . 1 m m 2 were measured and averaged , and the number of focal adhesions per cell was determined . The ratio of the long axis to the short axis in Fig . 3D was also determined using ImageJ software . Quantification of membrane localization of mDia1 For the experiments shown in Fig . 6A , HeLa cells were starved in DMEM containing 0 . 5 % FCS for 24 hours and stimulated with 10 % FCS at the indicated times . For the experiments shown in Fig . 6B , transfection of plasmid DNA was performed as described above . After 3 hours , the medium was changed to Opti - MEM , and the cells were starved in Opti - MEM for 15 hours . For the experiments shown in Fig . 6C , HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA and cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FCS for 48 hours . Cellular fractionation to the cytosol and membrane fractions was performed using a Native Membrane Protein Extraction Kit ( M - PEK ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Merck ) . Each fraction was subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting was performed . Protein band intensities were measured using Adobe Photoshop . The standard curve for immunoblotting of mDia1 was constructed by applying graded membrane fractions of control cells in each experiment , and the intensity of the sample bands was expressed as the fold change compared with the control band . Immunofluorescence analysis of membrane localization of mDia1 DID - DD - CC fragments HeLa cells were transfected with 0 . 5 m g of either pEGFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) , pEGFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) ( A256D ) or pEGFP – mDia1 ( 136 – 570 ) ( I259D ) together with 2 m g of either p3 6 FLAG or p3 6 FLAG – Liprin - a 3 ( 1 – 817 ) as described above . Cells were fixed at 18 hours after transfection with 10 % TCA on ice for 10 minutes . The fixed cells were stained with anti - GFP polyclonal ( 1 : 200 ; MBL ) and anti - FLAG monoclonal ( 1 : 200 ) antibodies . Secondary antibodies were Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes ) . Staining was examined with a Leica SP5 confocal imaging system ( Plan - Apochromat 40 6 1 . 25 NA ) . Optical sections of 0 . 5 m m thickness were obtained from the bottom to the top of the cell , and the section showing membrane localization of the GFP signal in at least a part of the cell was chosen for analysis . The percentage of cells with plasma membrane localization was determined by dividing the number of cells showing plasma membrane localization by the total number of GFP - positive cells .
