The aim of the study was to adapt FP in the Greek context and evaluate its longitudinal effectiveness in Greek students . The sample of the present research consisted of 314 children aged 9 – 12 years from six elementary schools in Athens and Crete , Greece . Students were randomly assigned to condition ( intervention or control group ) and the effectiveness of the program was examined through three measurements ( before , at the end of the intervention and 3 months later ) . Data analyses ( Repeated measures ANCOVA ’ s , Confirmatory Factor Analyses ) were conducted using SPSS 25 and Mplusv . 8 . 0 . Results showed that FP - GR influenced participants ’ general attitudes towards refugees , affected their xenopho - bic and intolerant attitudes but did not seem to have any significant impact on participants ’ altruism . These results provide initial evidence that the FP - GR is an effective school - based prejudice - reduction program that promotes inclusive education for refugee - background elementary school children . Suggestions for the improvement of specific elements of FP - GR are also provided . Keywords Refugee children . Inclusive education . Multicultural and anti - racist school program . Attitudes . Anti - racism policy Introduction Beyond doubt , modern societies are characterized by constant and broad changes on economical social , demographic and educational level ( Cavounidis 2013 ) . Up to the end of 2018 , 70 . 8 million people had been forcibly displaced from their country of origin because of conflict , war and persecution . This number included nearly 25 . 9 million refugees with over half of them being children [ United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) 2019 ] . Thus , a global concern has been raised not only in terms of ensuring the safe settlement of refugee background people ( UNHCR 2019 ) but also in terms of promoting their peaceful and harmonious social inclusion to the host countries ( Sacramento 2015 ) . Given that education is a key factor for social cohesion , the integration of refugees into the educational settings becomes one societal challenge high in the international agenda ( Beißert et al . 2019 ) . Accumulating evidence suggest that ed - ucation is among the most effective ways for refugee youth to become socially accepted and integrated in a new culture ( Thomas et al . 2016 ) . Unfortunately , youth with refugee back - ground face often attitudinal barriers related to stereotypes , prejudice and xenophobia that make integration and quality education more difficult to attain ( Pugh et al . 2012 ) . Relevant literature suggests that refugee youth are usually stigmatized and become targets of bias - based bullying in the form of racist name calling , teasing , social isolation and segregation ( Earnest et al . 2015 ) . The social exclusion they usually face represents a problem with profound negative effects not only to their school adjustment but also to their overall psychoso - cial well - being ( Szaflarski and Bauldry 2019 ) . Social integra - tion is considered a reciprocal process which can be success - fully achieved when the host community adopts an open , pos - itive and inclusive orientation towards cultural diversity ( Berry 1997 ; Plexousakis et al . 2019 ) . It is perceived to be the most effective strategy for immigrants ’ well - being that requires a readiness on the part of the receiving communities to welcome ethnic minorities without prejudice ( Sengupta and Blessinger 2018 ) . Moreover , inclusive school environments have been shown to promote students ’ school performance , * Theodoros Giovazolias giovazot @ uoc . gr 1 Department of Psychology , University of Crete , Gallos Campus , Rethymno , 74100 Crete , Greece 2 Department of Early Childhood Education , National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s12144 - 020 - 00842 - w Published online : 9 June 2020 Current Psychology ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 cultivate trust and acceptance of cultural differences , reduce prejudicial attitudes and enhance civic engagement in adult - hood ( Kourkoutas and Giovazolias 2015 ; Mickelson and Nkomo 2012 ) . Particularly , it has been suggested that when children are actively involved in educational programs that establish acceptance and encourage the exchange of views , their general altruistic attitudes can be promoted ( Büssing et al . 2013 ) . Research has shown that altruism , which refers to voluntary actions that benefit another without personal in - terest or external awards ( Batson et al . 2015 ) , raises support for migration ( Hansen and Legge 2016 ) and that children who care more about the well - being of others tend to increase help - ing behaviors towards migrant populations ( Batson et al . 2009 ) . Given that schools can highly contribute to tackle the rise of racism , discrimination and xenophobia ( De Paola and Brunello 2016 ) , the implementation of educational programs that address ethnic diversity and foster a pluralistic school culture for host and refugees students has become an issue of critical importance for the research community ( Barnett 2018 ) . School - Based Programs towards Ethnic Diversity Culturally sensitive and inclusive interventions aim to alter students ’ racial attitudes and decrease prejudicial and xeno - phobic manifestations ( Beelmann and Heinemann 2014 ) . Multicultural and anti - racist school - based interventions sup - port that prejudice stems from ignorance or misleading social information and can be reduced by providing knowledge that changes the way children think and feel about an out - group ( White and Gleitzman 2006 ) . Thus , by providing anti - bias information through socialization influences ( e . g . story books , games ) children acquire the skills needed to break down neg - ative generalizations , overcome roadblocks to empathy ( Aboud et al . 2012 ) and cultivate multicultural awareness ( Killen and Smetana 2015 ) . Further , social skills interventions supporting the active construction of attitudes focus on teach - ing children different ways of processing information under - lying group dynamics ( e . g . through role playing ) ( Rutland and Killen 2015 ) . The effectiveness of interventions aimingat changing chil - dren ’ s racial attitudes is well documented in the literature ( Brenick et al . 2019 ) . Okoye - Johnson ( 2011 ) in a meta - analysis of 30 curricular and reinforcement multicultural in - tervention studies conducted in prekindergarten through twelfth graders , found that exposure to multicultural education led to a reduction in students ’ racial attitudes . Similarly , Aboud et al . ( 2012 ) in a systematic review of 32 studies on anti - prejudice interventions ( 14 contact and 18 media / instruc - tion ) delivered to young children found that somewhat fewer than half had positive outcomes in ethnic prejudice and dis - crimination reduction . Yet , most of these studiesare conducted within the context of more traditional majority / minority rela - tions ( e . g . White majority / Black minority , host majority / immigrants minority children ) . Surprisingly , there is a dearth of well - structured evaluated interventions targeting attitudes of majority group members towards other out - groups such as refugees ( Ülger et al . 2018 ) . To our knowledge , only three studies have evaluated interventions focusing on changing children ’ s attitudes and behaviors towards refugees . Cameron et al . ( 2006 ) assessed the effectiveness of extended contact - through friendship storytelling - interventions in changing children ’ s ( 5 - to 11 - years old ) attitudes towards refugees and intended behaviors towards hypothetical refugee background children . Results supported the effectiveness of extended contact intervention only in improving attitudes towards refugees . Turner and Brown ( 2008 ) evaluated the longitudinal effectiveness of “ The Friendship Project ” , a multicultural - antiracist school - based in - tervention in the UK designed to improve children ’ s attitudes towards refugees . The program was found to be effective in improving short - term but not long - term attitudes . Finally , Glen et al . ( 2020 ) in a study with children aged 8 to 11 years , found that inducing empathy though brief narrative interven - tions promoted prosocial behavior towards refugees . The Friendship Project - Greece ( FP - GR ) The FP - GR is a multifaceted anti - prejudice program that fo - cuses on promoting positive intergroup relations among Greek host primary students and refugee background children . The core elements of FP - GR are derived from “ The Friendship Project ” a multicultural - antiracist program , de - signed by a small voluntary organization [ Kent Refugee Action Network ( KRAN ) ] working to address the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in the Kent area , UK . FP - GR is considered to be an enriched version of the original “ The Friendship Project ” as it endorses a multi - strategic approach ( Greco et al . 2010 ) that draws upon social learning and cog - nitive development theories regarding the development and change of children ’ s prejudicial attitudes . More precisely , FP - GR entails four weekly structured les - sons concentrating on a threefold objective : a ) knowledge : an understanding of concepts such as “ refugee ” , “ racism ” and “ discrimination ” , b ) values of participants : to encourage chil - dren ’ s respect towards refugees , and c ) skills : for example , identification of prejudicial and egocentric attitudes in them - selves and in society and empathy ( Turner and Brown 2008 ) . Based on the Empathy - Attitude - Action model which supports the role of empathy in promoting prosocial behaviors ( Batson et al . 2002 ) FP - GR ( for a detailed description of the original “ The Friendship Project ” see Turner and Brown 2008 ) was supplemented with extra empathy activities such as video ( e . g . “ Ivine and the Pillow ” ) , collaboration tasks ( e . g . group discus - sion , role - playing ) and reflective writing ( e . g . the FP - GR 3112 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 diary , a personal booklet designed and distributed to children by the interventionists ) . More specifically , according to previ - ous research , videos that induce empathy by portraying others in need decrease prejudice and enhance children ’ s engage - ment in prosocial behaviors ( Vezzali et al . 2019 ; Williams et al . 2014 ) . Additionally , collaboration activities that teach students how to work effectively with others , despite of their differences in attitudes seem to promote empathetic skills ( Hollingsworth et al . 2003 ) . Finally , reflective writing has been suggested as an effective instructional tool for fostering empathy ( Chen and Forbes 2014 ) . The content of each FP - GR ’ s lesson is outlined below : Lessons 1 & 2 : Spot the refugee . The intervention begins with a child - friendly video animated by UNICEF entitled “ Ivine and the Pillow ” to motivate children and involve them in the program . This short video ( 2 . 35´ ) depicts in an emo - tionally engaging way the true story of a 14 - year - old refugee child after their perilous escape from Syria . Through brain - storming , children elaborate on what makes someone a refu - gee . Interventionists discuss the definition of the concept “ ref - ugee ” as “ someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , member - ship of a particular social group , or political opinion ” ( United Nations General Assembly 1951 ) . Next , LEGO® minifigures are distributed to the class and children are asked to identify the similarities that the figures share and suggest an identity for each figure based on its characteristics . The interventionist , using a UNHCR poster with LEGO® minifigures , encourages children to guess which one of the figures is a refugee , explain how they came up with that choice and think if their decision is in accordance with the given definition of “ refugee ” . The above - mentioned structured learning tasks aim for a better understanding of the roots of racial biases and discriminative thinking as well as the harmful effects of distorted prejudicial beliefs on people ’ s emotional and social well - being . Lessons 3 & 4 : How does it feel ? Children working in small groups ( 4 – 5 persons ) discuss how they would feel in several scenarios ( e . g . “ as a child of their age who has accidentally been separated from the family while holidaying in a foreign land ” ) and portray their thoughts and feelings . A UNHCR ’ s poster en - titled “ How does it feel ” is used as a motivator , where one LEGO® figure is alone , away from the group . Interventionists use a series of questions as the basis for discussion ( e . g . What similarities and differences are there between the situation of the lonely LEGO® figure and the hypothetical scenarios we consid - ered ? ) . Children are next encouraged to engage in role - playing , an effective cooperative learning technique ( Stevens 2015 ) that enhances perspective taking ( Mead 1934 ) . Through all thesecollaboration activities participants are expected to explore different ways of thinking about diversity , develop feelings of empathy and cultivate the skills needed for handling possible social interactions with outgroups . At the end of each lesson children are prompt to reflect upon and describe in their FP - GR diary their inner thoughts and feelings about what they had experienced and learned in the class . Study Justification , Aim and Research Questions As mentioned earlier in this literature review , social integration is considered to be a crucial factor for refugee ’ s youth well - being and the establishment of long - term harmonious intergroup rela - tions ( Buchanan et al . 2018 ) . Greece has recently received a substantial influx of refugees ; according to the International Rescue Committee ( IRC 2019 ) , Greece currently hosts approxi - mately 50 thousand refugees , with the most having stayed long enough to expect final resettlement . Official statistics show that the number of under - aged refugees studying in Greek public schools has already reached a record of 12 . 5 thousand with near - ly 66 % of them being asylum seekers or beneficiaries of interna - tional protection ( UNHCR / Greece 2019 ) . However , the Greek society is still characterized by increased levels of racial discrimination . In particular , Greek youth seem to be prone to nationalist , xenophobic and authoritarian attitudes and intolerance towards ethnic minority groups ( Koronaiou et al . 2015 ) . Thus , given the increased hostility of Greek com - munity towards refugees and the possible danger of socially segregating and marginalizing this group ( Hangartner et al . 2019 ) it is more than vital to implement evaluated programs that focus on changing host students ’ anti - refugee sentiment . Accumulating evidence also suggest that prejudice reduction in - terventions are more effective when implemented in primary school students and adolescents ( Aboud et al . 2012 ) as intergroup attitudes , favoring ingroup and excluding outgroup members seem to develop in middle - childhood ( Nesdale 2008 ) . In this study , we evaluated the longitudinal effectiveness of FP - GR in a sample of Greek students , aged 9 to 11 years . This program was designed to : a ) reduce xenophobia and prejudice towards refugees , b ) cultivate tolerant attitudes towards ethnic diversity and , c ) promote general altruism by fostering empa - thy . More specifically , it hasbeen supported that xenophobia , defined as the fear or hatred against foreigners , decreases when the foreign and strange become more familiar ( Suleman et al . 2018 ) . Evidence also suggest that the reduc - tion of xenophobic attitudes are associated with lower levels of prejudice against refugees ( Obeid et al . 2019 ) . Furthermore , tolerance towards refugees , described as the emergence of positive feelings and the acceptance of equality between the ingroup and outgroup members ( Van Zalk et al . 2013 ) is an attitude that can be cultivated through activities that promote empathy ( Hollingsworth et al . 2003 ) . Similarly , altruism is a prosocial behavior that can be promoted through the develop - ment of empathetic understanding ( Batson et al . 2015 ) . The following hypotheses have been formulated based on the above objectives : 3113 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 H1 : The participation in FP - GR is expected to have a short - and a long - term positive impact on students ’ atti - tudes towards refugees . H2 : The participation in FP - GR is expected to reduce students ’ intolerant attitudes towards refugees both in a short and in a long - term basis . H3 : The participation in FP - GR is expected to decrease students ’ xenophobia towards refugees both in a short and in a long - term basis . H4 : The participation in FP - GR is expected to have no impact on Greek student ’ s attitudes towards the in group . H5 : The participation in FP - GR is expected to have a short - and a long - term positive impact on Greek students ’ general altruism . Methods Overall Study Design and Data Collection FP - GR involved four weekly sessions ( approx . 90 min each ) , which were conducted in children ’ s classrooms by four trained psychologists / counselors . The longitudinal effective - ness of the program was evaluated with three assessments or waves separated by 1 month and 3 months , respectively . More precisely , the baseline ( Time 1 ) assessment was conducted in February of 2019 ( before the intervention ) , the second ( Time 2 ) in March of 2019 ( after the completion of the intervention ) , while the third ( Time 3 ) in June of 2019 ( 3 months after the completion of the intervention ) . An a priori G * power analysis ( ES = . 25 , α = . 05 , df = 3 ) indicated a sample size of 175 in order to achieve results with 80 % power . In order to ensure a sufficientsample , our eligibility criteria included schools with over 300 students enrolled in grades 4 , 5 and 6 that didnot operate reception structures for refugee education . An initial call was sent to 20 schools and the intervention took place to six schools that responded positively . Students with parental consent from each grade willing to participate in the study were given a unique personal code and were randomly allo - cated to the intervention group ( IG ) and to the control group ( CG ) respectively , using Google ’ s random number generator . For the data collection , for each assessment , a paper - based self - report anonymous questionnaire was administered to the total sample . The interventionist ’ s academic profile in con - junction with a manual containing a detailed description of each lesson plan and a protocol recording intervention process at the end of each session ensured the fidelity of the program . Voluntariness and anonymity of the participant ’ s responses were clearlyexplained and ensured . Permission by teachers and school principals as well parental consent for children ’ s participation in the study were also required . No compensate was given for the participation in the study . The research obtained approval by the Ethics Committee of University of Crete and the Greek Ministry of Education . Participants The sample at Time 1 consisted of 367 Greek regular elemen - tary students ( M age = 10 . 79 ; SD = . 87 , 51 . 2 % girls ) enrolled in grades 4 , 5 and 6 in six primary public schools in Athens and Crete . The schools were selected through convenience sam - pling , as explained above , and participants were randomly assigned to IG ( n = 200 , 50 . 5 % girls ) and CG ( n = 167 , 51 . 2 % girls ) . An attrition rate of 9 . 5 % at Time 2 and Time 3 respectively , as well as deleted outliers ( n = 18 ) reduced the analyzed sample to 314 participants ( M age = 10 . 79 ; SD = . 87 ; 51 . 9 % girls ; 55 . 1 % intervention group ) ( see Fig . 1 ) . The two groups ( intervention vs control ) did not differ in terms of sex or school grade they attended ( χ 2 = . 406 , p = . 524 and χ 2 = . 401 , p = . 818 , respectively ) . Concerning the final sam - ple ’ s distribution in grade , 107 ( 34 . 1 % ) were 4th graders , 99 ( 31 . 5 % ) were 5th graders and 108 ( 34 . 4 % ) were 6th graders . Additionally , 273 ( 86 . 9 % ) were Greeks , and 36 ( 11 . 7 % ) were of “ Other ” racial heritage ( e . g . Albanian , Italian ) . Instruments Attitudes towards Refugees Attitudes towards refugees ( e . g . I like refugees ) were measured by a six - item self - report instru - ment constructed by Turner and Brown ( 2008 ) . The Greek version of the “ Attitudes towards Refugees ” scale was trans - lated from the original , back - translated , and adjusted for cul - tural adaptation by the research team . Items were rated on a five - point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree ) with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes towards refugees . No missing values were reported in a sam - ple of 177 Greek primary students ( M age = 10 . 6 , SD = . 83 , 55 . 4 % girls ) . The psychometric properties of this and the fol - lowing scales were tested using Mplusv . 8 . 0 software . One - factor confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) model using maxi - mum likelihood estimator ( MLR ; Yuan and Bentler 2000 ) proved an excellent fit to the data , χ 2 = 5 . 14 , df = 8 , p > . 05 . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 6 . 62 , df = 5 , p > . 05 ) and scalar invariance ( Δχ 2scalar vs metric = 5 . 25 , df = 5 , p > . 05 ) across gender were also confirmed . Internal consistency of the instru - ment was , ω = . 85 . Test - retest reliability – 4 weeks interval - was also supported ( r = . 77 , p < . 001 ) . In the present study the one - factor CFA model for the “ Attitudes towards Refugees ” scale provided an exact fit to the data ( χ 2 = 8 . 50 , df = 8 , p > . 05 ) . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 13 . 64 , df = 10 , p > . 05 ) and scalar invariance ( Δχ 2scalar vs metric = 1 . 81 , df = 9 , p > . 05 ) across time were also confirmed . Omega values were as follows : ( Time 1 , ω = . 83 ; Time 2 , ω = . 85 ; Time 3 , ω = . 86 ) . 3114 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 Attitudes towards Greek People Attitudes towards Greek peo - ple ( e . g . I like Greek people ) were measured in order to provide evidence for the discriminant validity of the interven - tion . Following the paradigm of Turner and Brown ( 2008 ) we used the same items as before , but we replaced the word “ Refugees ” with “ Greek people ” . The Greek version of the “ Attitudes towards Greek people ” scale was translated from the original , back - translated , and adjusted for cultural adapta - tion by the research team . No missing values were reported in a sample of 177 Greek primary students ( M age = 10 . 6 , SD = . 83 , 55 . 4 % girls ) . One - factor CFA model using MLR estimator ( Yuan and Bentler 2000 ) proved an excellent fit to the data , χ 2 = 8 . 50 , df = 8 , p > . 05 . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 3 . 88 , df = 5 , p > . 05 ) and scalar invariance ( Δχ 2scalar vs metric = 1 . 79 , df = 5 , p > . 05 ) across gender were also confirmed . Internal consistency of the instrument was ω = . 76 . Test - retest reliability - 4 weeks interval - was sup - ported ( r = . 78 , p < . 001 ) . In the present study the one - factor CFA model for the “ Attitudes towards Greek people ” scale provided a reasonable fit to the data , χ 2 = 23 . 56 , df = 8 , p < . 05 , RMSEA = . 08 , CFI = . 93 , SRMR = . 04 . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 13 . 76 , df = 10 , p > . 05 ) and partial sca - lar invariance ( Δχ 2partial scalar vs metric = 11 . 06 , df = 8 , p > . 05 ) across time were also confirmed . Omega values were as fol - lows : ( Time 1 , ω = . 70 ; Time 2 , ω = . 80 ; Time 3 , ω = . 81 ) . Tolerance and Xenophobia Tolerant ( e . g . Immigrants are good for the Greek economy ) and xenophobic attitudes ( e . g . Immigrants increase criminality ) towards refugees were measured with eight items from the Tolerance and Xenophobic Questionnaire ( TRQ , see Van Zalk et al . 2013 ) . The Greek version of the TRQ scale was translated from the original , back - translated , and adjusted for cultural adaptation by the research team . Each item was rated on a four - point Likert scale ( 1 = don ’ t agree at all to 4 = agree completely ) with higher scores indicating more frequent use of the corre - sponding attitude . For the purpose of our study we changed the words “ Swedish ” , “ Sweden ” and “ Immigrants ” with “ Greek ” , “ Greece ” and “ Refugees ” respectively . We also recoded Tolerance items so that lower scores reflected in - creased level of intolerance . The Little ’ s Missing Completely at Random ( MCAR ) test in a sample of 177 Greek primary students ( M age = 10 . 6 , SD = . 83 , 55 . 4 % girls ) was not significant , χ 2 = 5 . 51 , df = 6 , p = . 48 , indicating that missing values were distributed completely at random . A fac - tor loading cutoff of . 32 ( Tabachnick and Fidell 2001 ) sug - gested the deletion of item 8 ( β = . 11 , p > . 05 ) of the Xenophobia subscale . The two - factor CFA model proposed by previous studies ( Van Zalk et al . 2013 ) provided using MLR estimator ( Yuan and Bentler 2000 ) a reasonable fit to the data , χ 2 = 28 . 01 , df = 12 , p < . 05 , RMSEA = . 09 , CFI = . 91 , SRMR = . 05 . Discrimination of the two constructs was accomplished as the factor correlation coefficient ( r = − . 74 , p < . 001 ) did not exceed the cutoff value of . 85 ( Brown 2006 ) . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 5 . 15 , df = 5 , p > . 05 ) and scalar invariance ( Δχ 2scalar vs metric = 2 . 28 , df = 5 , p > . 05 ) of the questionnaire across gender were also con - firmed . Internal consistency for the four - item Tolerance sub - scale was ω = . 67 and for the three - item Xenophobia sub - scale , ω = . 59 , respectively . Test - retest reliability was also supported ( Tolerance , r = . 72 , p < . 001 ; Xenophobia , r = . 75 , p < . 001 ) . In the present study the two - factor CFA provided a satisfactory fit to the data , χ 2 = 33 . 94 , df = 12 , p < . 05 , RMSEA = . 08 , CFI = . 91 , SRMR = . 06 . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 11 . 51 , df = 10 , p > . 05 ) and partial scalar invariance ( Δχ 2partial scalar vs metric = 12 . 97 , df = 8 , p > . 05 ) across time Analysed Intervention Group ( n = 173 ) Analysed Control Group ( n = 141 ) Valid Post - Test Questionnaires ( n = 173 ) Dropout = 17 Outlier = 10 Valid Post - Test Questionnaires ( n = 141 ) Dropout = 18 Outlier = 8 Six schools from two geographical areas participated in this study Allocated to Intervention Group and Pre - Tested ( n = 200 ) Allocated to Control Group and Pre - Tested ( n = 167 ) Fig . 1 Flowchart of study participants 3115 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 were also confirmed . Omega values for the Xenophobia sub - scale were ( Time 1 , ω = . 57 ; Time 2 , ω = . 60 ; Time 3 , ω = . 72 ) and for the Tolerance subscale were ( Time 1 , ω = . 65 ; Time 2 , ω = . 67 ; Time 3 , ω = . 68 ) , respectively . Altruism The Generative Altruism Scale ( GALS , Büssing et al . 2013 ) is a self - report instrument designed to measure adolescents ’ and young adults ’ altruism , ( e . g . When I see needy persons , I ask them how I can help ) . The Greek version of the GALS scale was translated from the original , back - translated , and adjusted for cultural adaptation by the research team . All items were scored on a four - point Likert scale mea - suring the intensity of the respective attitude or behavior ( 0 = Never to 3 = Very Often ) . There are two versions of the GALS scale , the 11 and the 9 - item version respectively . The MCAR test in a sample of 177 Greek primary students ( M age = 10 . 6 , SD = . 83 , 55 . 4 % girls ) was not significant , χ 2 = 17 . 23 , df = 10 , p = . 07 , indicating that missing values were distributed completely at random . One - factor CFA model using MLR estimator ( Yuan and Bentler 2000 ) for the 11 - item scale proved an acceptable model fit with characteristics of χ 2 = 62 . 385 , df = 43 , p < . 001 , RMSEA = . 05 , CFI = . 97 , SRMR = . 04 . Metric ( Δχ 2metric vs configural = 3 . 45 , df = 10 , p > . 05 ) and scalar invariance ( Δχ 2scalar vs metric = 6 . 82 , df = 10 , p > . 05 ) across gender were also confirmed . Internal con - sistency for GALS was , ω = . 87 . Test - retest reliability was also supported ( r = . 74 , p < . 01 ) . In the present study the one - factor CFA model for the GALS provided a satisfactory fit to the data , χ 2 = 68 . 55 , df = 43 , p < . 001 , RMSEA = . 04 , CFI = . 95 , SRMR = . 04 . Partial metric ( Δχ 2partial metric vs configural = 17 . 71 , df = 19 , p > . 05 ) and partial scalar invariance ( Δχ 2partial scalar vs partial metric = 24 . 64 , df = 16 , p > . 05 ) across time were supported . Omega values were as follows : ( Time 1 , ω = . 80 ; Time 2 , ω = . 86 ; Time 3 , ω = . 85 ) . Data Analyses Attrition analyses with Independent - Samples Τ - tests were car - ried out to test the differences between participants and no participants in the baseline variables . A Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was also conducted to assess the normality of the study variables . Furthermore , descriptive statistics were examined and zero - order correlations were carried out among all the research variables in the three waves . Multivariate anal - yses were conducted to examine the differences by demo - graphics ( i . e . , gender , grade and parental level of educational attainment ) in the study variables in the three assessment points . Repeated measures ANCOVAs , controlling for the influence of the four interventionists , were carried out in order to evaluate the longitudinal effectiveness of the FP . Interventionists were treated as continuous variables by dum - my coding ( the first interventionist was specified to be the reference group ) . Moreover , univariate and multivariate outliers were assessed by boxplot and mahalanobis distance and were treated accordingly . Homogeneity of variances ( Levene ’ s test ) and homogeneity of covariances ( Box ’ s M test ) were tested in the research variables in all assessment points . When the Mauncly test of sphericity was violated ( p < . 05 ) , the Greenhouse - Geisser correction was used to cor - rect for this prevalent violation . Effect sizes ( ES ) were assessed using the Partial Eta - Squared ( η ρ 2 ) and the Cohen ’ s d measures . The η ρ 2 indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable accounted by some effect ( small ES = . 01 ; medium ES = . 09 ; large ES = . 25 ) while the Cohen ’ s d ( Cohen 1988 ) assesses the size of difference between two means in SD units ( small ES = . 20 ; medium = . 50 ; large = . 80 and above ) . The η ρ 2 provides valuable information when compar - ing effects between studies with similar experimental designs while the Cohen ’ s d seems more robust to these differences ( see Laken 2013 ) . All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 25 . The Cohen ’ s d was computed using an online cal - culator ( www . socscistatistics . com ) and the η ρ 2 was converted into Cohen ’ s d with De Coster ( 2012 ) spreadsheet . Results Normality Test Attrition Analyses The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test indicated that all study vari - ables were non - normally distributed ( p < . 05 ) . Nevertheless , F - test is supported to be robust to violations of normality ( Blanca et al . 2017 ) and thus , ANCOVAs were conducted in subsequent analyses . Attrition analyses indicated no group differences in baseline assessment ( Time 1 ) , for Attitudes to - wards refugees t ( 312 ) = . 783 , p = . 624 ; Intolerance , t ( 45 . 91 ) = . 154 , p = . 88 ; Xenophobia , t ( 342 ) = − . 94 , p = . 35 and Generative Altruism , t ( 341 ) = − . 901 , p = . 40 . Nevertheless , group differences were found in Attitudes to - wards the Greek people , t ( 31 . 33 ) = − 2 . 47 , p < . 05 , with partic - ipants demonstrating higher levels of positive attitudes ( M participants = 26 . 20 , M noparticipants = 24 . 00 ) . Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Correlations among the Study Variables Means , standard deviations and bivariate correlations among the study variables are presented in Table 1 . Regarding the effect of demographics on the research variables in all waves , a multivariate analysis of variance indicated no significant effects of gender , F ( 15 , 103 ) = 1 . 09 , p = . 374 , Wilk ’ s Λ = . 77 , grade , F ( 30 , 206 ) = . 97 , p = . 513 , Wilk ’ s Λ = . 77 , pa - ternal educational level , F ( 75 , 535 ) = . 89 , p = . 727 , Wilks ’ Λ = . 55 , or maternal educational level , F ( 75 , 497 ) = . 76 , p = . 93 , Wilks ’ s Λ = . 60 . 3116 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 Covariance Analyses Effect of FP - GR on Attitudes Towards Refugees in the Two Study Groups Homogeneity of variances [ F 1st wave ( 1 , 312 ) = . 004 , p > . 05 ; F 2nd wave ( 1 , 312 ) = . 20 , p > . 05 ; F 3rd wave ( 1 , 312 ) = . 08 , p > . 05 ] , and covariances ( Box ’ s M = . 517 , p > . 05 ) was con - firmed by the data . The Greenhouse - Geisser correction [ Mauchly ’ s test : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 6 . 78 , p < . 05 ] showed a significant interaction between time and group , F ( 1 . 96 , 604 . 83 ) = 5 . 29 , p < . 01 , η ρ 2 = . 03 , Cohen ’ s d = . 34 , whilst controlling for the effect of the interventionists . More specifically , the IG dem - onstrated significantly higher levels of positive attitudes to - wards refugees in the 2 nd wave of assessment and the 3 rd wave respectively compared to the 1st wave ( Μ interventiontime2 – time1 = 2 . 08 , p < . 001 , Cohen ’ s d = . 42 ; Μ interventiontime3 – time1 = . 93 , p < . 05 , Cohen ’ s d = . 18 ) . Nevertheless a significant but small reduction in positive attitudes towards refugees was found from the 2nd to the 3rd wave of assessment for this treatment group ( Μ intervention time2 – time3 = 1 . 14 , p < . 01 , Cohen ’ s d = . 22 ) . On the contrary , no significant attitudinal change across time was supported for the CG ( p > . 05 ) . Furthermore , the IG showed significantly higher levels of pos - itive attitudes towards refugees compared to the CG on the2nd wave of assessment ( M intervention - control = 1 . 62 , p < . 01 , Cohen ’ s d = . 33 ) . Effect of FP - GR on Attitudes towards Greek People in the Two Study Groups Although homogeneity of covariances was supported ( Box ’ s M = 8 . 51 , p > . 05 ) , homogeneity of variances was not con - firmed across all assessment points [ F 1st wave ( 1 , 312 ) = . 021 , p = . 86 ; F 2nd wave ( 1 , 312 ) = . 009 , p = . 93 ; F 3rdwave ( 1 , 312 ) = 5 . 87 , p < . 02 ] . Results [ Mauchly ’ s test : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 1 . 80 , p > . 05 ] showed a no significant interaction between time and group F ( 2 , 618 ) = 1 . 30 , p = . 27 , η ρ 2 = . 00 , while controlling for the effect of the interventionists . Additionally , no significant main effects were supported for time [ F ( 2 , 618 ) = . 64 , p > . 05 ] and group [ F ( 1 , 309 ) = . 051 , p > . 05 ] respectively . Effect of FP - GR on Xenophobia in the Two Study Groups Homogeneity of variances was not equally supported across all assessment points [ F 1st wave ( 1 , 312 ) = 6 . 73 , p < . 01 ; F 2nd wave ( 1 , 312 ) = . 60 , p > . 05 ; F 3rd wave ( 1 , 312 ) = 2 . 56 , p > . 05 ] . Instead homogeneity of covariances was confirmed ( Box ’ s M = 10 . 35 , p > . 05 ) . The Greenhouse - Geisser correction [ Mauchly ’ s test : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 8 . 27 , p < . 05 ] indicated a significant interaction between time and group , F ( 1 . 95 , 602 . 05 ) = 6 . 56 , p < . 01 , η ρ 2 = . 04 , Cohen ’ s d = . 41 , whilst controlling for the effect of the interventionists .

Results showed [ Mauchly ’ s test : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 5 . 80 , p > . 05 ] a significant interaction between time and group , F ( 2 , 618 ) = 7 . 94 , p < . 001 , η ρ 2 = . 03 , Cohen ’ d = . 34 . The IG demonstrat - ed no significant change in general altruism between the 1 st and the 2nd wave of assessment ( Μ intervetnionl time1 – time2 = − . 95 , p > . 05 ) . Surprisingly , a significant reduction in general altruism was found for this treatment group from the 2 nd wave of assessment to the 3rd wave respectively ( Μ intervetnionltime3 – time2 = − 1 . 03 , p < . 05 , Cohen ’ s d = . 15 ) . Additionally , analyses of the data indicated a significant reduction of the altruistic behavior for the CG across time ( Μ controltime2 – time1 = − 1 . 4 , p < . 01 , Cohen ’ s d = . 22 ) and Time 3 ( Μ controltime3 – time1 = − . 44 , p < . 01 , Cohen ’ s d = . 31 ) . Discussion The current study evaluated the longitudinal impact of the FP - GR , a structured theory - driven intervention program designed to prevent prejudice and generate children ’ s positive attitudes towards refugees . Our findings provide initial support regard - ing the positive short - term impact of FP - GR on children ’ s general attitudes towards refugees . The long - term effective - ness of the program , though significantly smaller in magni - tude compared to the short - term , can also be supported by the results of this study . Additionally , discriminant validity of the FP - GR was confirmed as IG participant ’ s attitudes towards Greek people remained stable . Furthermore , no statistical lon - gitudinal attitudinal change was detected for the CG . These effects appear to be in agreement with previous results of studies aiming to reduce prejudicial attitudes and cultivate social and emotional skills ( e . g . Brenick et al . 2019 ; Turner and Brown 2008 ) . Indeed , most of the reinforcement pro - grams designed to promote positive intergroup attitudes report only low to moderate effects ( e . g . mean ES = . 08 ; Okoye - Johnson 2011 ) which often tend to weaken or disappear after a time delay ( Beelmann and Heinemann 2014 ) . Our results , although small in effect size ( mean ES = . 30 ) , should be con - sidered educationally significant given the cut - off . 25 ES value proposed by Tallmadge ( 1977 ) . Additionally , it should be mentioned that they are in line with suggestions pertaining that in a low intensity and cost program , even a slight attitu - dinal change could have impressive implications and practical importance ( Ellis 2010 ) . Furthermore , the FP - GR showed a positive moderate longitudinal impact on children ’ s xenopho - bic attitudes towards refugees . More specifically , the IG dem - onstrated significantly lower levels of xenophobia in the short - term and in the long - term , respectively ( mean ES = . 26 ) . Furthermore , no statistical longitudinal attitudinal change was found for the CG . These findings could have implications for the effectiveness of FP - GR in combating xenophobia , the “ psychological state of hostility or fear towards outsiders ” ( Reynolds and Vine 1987 , p . 28 ) . It has been documented that misconceptions and threat narratives about refugees wide - spread in society can evoke feelings of anxiety and fear in children and fuel anti - immigrant attitudes ( Glen et al . 2020 ) . The effectiveness of direct and manipulated exposure to anti - bias information in reducing negative generalizations and cul - tivating empathy is well supported ( Bigler and Liben 2006 ) . Indeed , media / instruction anti - prejudice interventions in young children have yielded promising results ( see Aboud et al . 2012 ) . The FP - GR , acknowledging that ignorance is a key factor of xenophobia ( Van der Westhuizen and Kleintjes 2015 ) provided children with the accurate and developmen - tally appropriateknowledge to dispel false myths and to recon - struct possible distorted beliefs about refugees . To our knowl - edge , this is the first study that assesses the effectiveness of an anti - prejudice program in combating the xenophobic attitudes of the majority children using a psychometrically sound in - strument . Thus , our results not only contradict previous re - search supporting the weak impact of multicultural interven - tions on changing negative ethnic stereotypes and attitudes 3118 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 ( e . g . Killen et al . 2011 ) but also confirm the potential efficacy of the FP - GR in decreasing xenophobic attitudes . The FP - GR demonstrated a negative but small in effect size ( ES = . 18 ) short - term impact on children ’ s intolerant attitudes towards refugees . Contrary to our hypothesis , the mean dif - ference between the initial assessment and that conducted 3 months after the end of the intervention was found to be insignificant . Tolerance towards immigrants is understood as a basic democratic principle that is based on the abstract un - derstanding and endorsement of equality between immigrants and non - immigrants ( Rapp 2017 ) . The weak impact of the FP - GR on changing participants ’ intolerant attitudes towards ref - ugees could be attributed to age differences regarding abstract and critical level of thought ( Walker et al . 2018 ) as well as the limited time of the program to cultivate children ’ s abstract thinking about equality and social justice , two concepts close - ly related to tolerance . Self - report measures are not also sen - sitive enough to determine whether the profile of attitudinal change manifested by participants reflects changes in actual behavior ( Brenick et al . 2019 ) . That means that the FP - GR may be effective in combating children ’ s intolerant attitudes towards refugees but still in an implicit and unconscious way . Contrary to our expectations , the FP - GR did not seem to have any significant positive short - term impact on IG ’ s altru - ism . Unexpectedly , IG participants showed a significant re - duction in their motivation to behave altruistically , 3 months after the completion of the intervention . Additionally , the CG demonstrated significantly lower levels in altruism in the long run . As it has been already mentioned , the FP - GR aimed at fostering children ’ s altruistic behavior by implementing sev - eral well - structured empathy inducing activities . More specif - ically , it was anticipated that by stimulating participants ’ em - pathetic concern towards refugees , there would be an im - provement in their prosocial helping or caring for others ( Fourie et al . 2017 ) . The unstable levels of altruism found in both groups contradict theories supporting the biological roots of altruism ( Rajhans et al . 2016 ) . Furthermore , the insignifi - cant impact of the program on enhancing children ’ s generative altruism , conceptualized as the non - conflictual pleasure of fostering the success and / or welfare of another ( Büssing et al . 2013 ) provides support for the contextual nature of al - truistic behavior . More specifically , our results confirm previ - ous findings suggesting that individual ’ s altruistic actions are not intrinsic and uniform but depend partially on the societally shared conceptions and the established positive relationships with particular social identity groups ( Jenkins et al . 2018 ) . We acknowledge that participants had few opportunities for inter - group contact , which has been proposed as the most effective way to reduce prejudice ( Brown and Hewstone 2005 ; Pettigrew and Tropp 2006 ) , as they were enrolled in schools that did not operate reception structures for refugee education . Results could also be explained from a developmental stand - point , given that acting altruistically requires acquisition of Theory of Mind , an ability necessary to attribute mental states and put oneself into another ’ s shoes ( Wellman et al . 2001 ; Wellman and Liu 2004 ) . Elementary students are not yet able to perform hypothetical reasoning and it is not before 12 years of age that they acquire the ability to reason abstractly ( Piaget 1972 , 1981 ; Rafetseder et al . 2013 ) . Additionally , given that our study assessed neither empathy nor altruism specifically towards refugees ( as to our knowledge there are no available research measures ) , we do not have enough evidence to pro - vide support for the Empathy - Attitudes - Action model ( Batson et al . 2002 ) , which states that increasing empathy towards one social out - group ( e . g . refugees ) , improves positive attitudes and in turn promotes prosocial behaviour ( e . g . altruism ) to - wards that group . Taken together , these findings confirm that the FP - GR not only influenced participants ’ general attitudes towards refu - gees , but also affected their xenophobic and intolerant atti - tudes . The small effect sizes found in our study could be par - tially attributed to several reasons . First , as it has been already mentioned , the FP - GR is a brief and low intensity preventative anti - prejudice program . In a meta - analysis conducted by Okoye – Johnson in 2011 , it was found that multicultural pro - grams were longitudinally effective in changing deep - rooted stereotypes , when embedded to the school everyday life , from curriculum and instructional materials through every compo - nent of the school experience . Second , following the ethical principle of respect for person , parental consent was a require - ment for children ’ s participation in this research . It is , then , possible that parents who permitted their child participation in the present multicultural – antiracist program , already dem - onstrated low levels of xenophobic and intolerant attitudes to - wards refugees . According to the literature , parents ’ subtle prejudicial cognition and automatic behavior are positively as - sociated with children ’ s prejudice towards an out - group ( Pirchio et al . 2018 ) . Thus , the effectiveness of the FP - GR in promoting intergroup understanding and acceptance was pos - sibly assessed in a sample of children with pre - existing positive perceptions of cultural diversity , giving little room for im - provement . Finally , the FP - GR is a program implemented ex - clusively at the individual level . Hence , it could be supported that the small effect sizes indicate those pertaining the effec - tiveness of multilevel – individually and systematically - ap - proaches in addressing race discrimination ( Greco et al . 2010 ) . More specifically , according to ecological developmen - tal models , development should be addressed as a result of complex links between individuals and multiple , causally in - teractive proximal socialization contexts ( Bronfenbrenner 1977 ) . Thus , it is possible that the effectiveness in changing participants ’ intergroup attitudes of anti - prejudice programs is moderated by various social factors associated with children ’ s development of racism and discrimination such as media neg - ative stereotypes about the out - group and teachers lack of in - tercultural competence ( Hajisoteriou et al . 2019 ) . 3119 Curr Psychol ( 2022 ) 41 : 3111 – 3123 This intervention study contributes to existing literature in several ways . First , taking into account the critical role that a reliable and valid measurement plays in intervention studies ( Gabrera - Nguyen 2010 ) , the outcomes of the present program were assessed using developmentally appropriate and psycho - metrically sound self - report instruments . Second , given the multifaceted character of attitudes ( Rutland and Killen 2015 ) , several measures and indicators were employed in or - der to investigate and capture any potential attitudinal chang - es . Third , in contrast to the majority of studies assessing the immediate effects of interventions on intergroup attitudes ( Beelmann and Heinemann 2014 ) , our research considered the short - term as well as the long - term stability of the out - comes . Finally , to our knowledge , this is one of the few eval - uations of a preventing program that prepares children to en - gage in a meaningful way with their outgroup refugee peers ( e . g . Turner and Brown 2008 ) . Limitations and Recommendations This study has also some limitations that are worth mentioning . First , we did not control for participants ’ pre - existing levels of contact with refugees . This is an important limitation given that being socially engaged with many cross - cultural companions has been linked to unbiased racial attitudes ( Aboud et al . 2003 ) . Furthermore , the implementation of the FP - GR took place by professionals , culturally competent and expertized in educational interventions towards diversity . Hence , the effec - tiveness of this program might not be confirmed in the future , especially when implemented by low levels of intercultural lit - eracy and sensitivity teachers . Indeed , teachers ’ negative implic - it racial attitudes not only serve as a potential predictor of im - plicit prejudicial attitudes displayed by children ( Vezzali et al . 2012 ) but could also act as a “ hidden and well camouflaged ” obstacle for the successful implementation of anti - prejudiced school based programs . Additionally , children ’ s attitudes to - wards refugees were assessed via self - report instruments . Although this type of measures represent one of the most fre - quently used research tools in relevant psychological research , they tend to be susceptible to response bias . In our case partic - ipants might have felt accountable for the anti - prejudice infor - mation they have received and thus provided socially desirableresponses . Self - report measures also evaluate only ex - plicit attitudes ( Axt 2018 ) . Nevertheless , research has shown that implicit attitudes , activated by the mere presence of the attitude object without the person ’ s full awareness or control , provide more information than explicit attitudes ( Dovidio et al . 2002 ) . The Implicit Association Test ( IAT ) and several “ priming ” methods ( for a description see McKeague et al . 2013 ) have the potential to provide a useful way of mea - suring children ’ s unconscious racial attitudes . Further , given that attitudes have a cognitive , emotional and behavioral component , well - conceived and well - executed behavioral observations can offer a valuable insight into them ( Furr and Funder 2007 ) . Taking all these into consideration , a multimethod approach could be examined , if researchers are really interested in deter - mining the true change in attitudes . Finally , children ’ s empathet - ic and altruistic behavior towards refugees was not evaluated in this study , as to our knowledge there are no available instru - ments reported in the literature . Despite the limitations of this study , the FP - GR did have an impact on children ’ s general , xenophobic and intolerant atti - tudes towards refugees . The next step is to improve the longitu - dinal effectiveness of this particular intervention and similar anti - prejudice programs , by taking into consideration the follow - ing suggestions . First , it seems important that multicultural and moral development programs be fundamentally embedded in the everyday school curriculum . Second , where possible , these programs could be combined with structured intergroup contact learning experiences , which have been found to promote inter - group relations ( Liebkind et al . 2019 ) . Finally , the professional development of teachers on cultural diversity issues should be an educational priority ( Giovazolias et al . 2019 ; Szelei et al . 2019 ) . Overall , investing in preventive school - based programs that prepare host society students to interact successfully with refugee background children results in the peace - building and the social cohesion of multicultural societies . Our study supports that the FP - GR is indeed a promising anti - prejudice program that could be implemented in elementary school settings .
