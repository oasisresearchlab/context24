We described time trends in social contacts for the pre - pandemic and pandemic periods in Quebec , Canada . Methods : CONNECT is a population - based study of social contacts conducted shortly before ( 2018 / 2019 ) and during the Covid - 19 pandemic ( April 2020 – February 2021 ) , using the same methodology for both periods . We recruited participants by random - digit - dialing and collected data by self - administered web - based questionnaires . Questionnaires documented socio - demographic characteristics and social contacts for two assigned days . A contact was defined as a two - way conversation at a distance ≤2 meters or as a physical contact , irrespective of masking . We used weighted generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and robust variance ( taking possible overdispersion into account ) to compare the mean number of social contacts over time by characteristics . Results : A total of 1291 and 5516 Quebecers completed the study before and during the pandemic , respectively . Contacts significantly decreased from a mean of 8 contacts / day prior to the pandemic to 3 contacts / day during the spring 2020 lockdown . Contacts remained lower than the pre - Covid period thereafter ( lowest = 3 contacts / day during the Christmas 2020 / 2021 holidays , highest = 5 in September 2020 ) . Contacts at work , during leisure activities / other locations , and at home with visitors showed the greatest decreases since the beginning of the pandemic . All sociodemographic subgroups showed significant decreases of contacts since the beginning of the pandemic . Conclusion : Physical distancing measures in Quebec significantly decreased social contacts , which most likely mitigated the spread of Covid - 19 .

While the province of Quebec was the epicenter of the first wave , most Canadian provinces experienced stronger second and third waves in terms of cases and hospitalisations . Since the beginning of the pandemic , Canada has adopted unprecedented physical distancing measures from complete lockdowns to a combination of school and non - essential businesses closures and restrictions on gatherings and household visits , depending on epidemiological indicators and regions ( 2 ) . Given that physical distancing measures are a cornerstone of public health COVID - 19 mitigation efforts , it is important to examine how social contacts changed over time : 1 ) to better understand the dynamics of the pandemic , 2 ) to inform future measures , and 3 ) to provide crucial data for mathematical modeling . To our knowledge , this is the first study that has compared social contacts documented shortly before and during the COVID - 19 pandemic using the same methodology . The main objective of this study is to describe the time trends in social contacts for the COVID - 19 pre - pandemic ( 2018 - 2019 ) and pandemic periods ( April 2020 - February 2021 ) in Quebec , Canada using a social contact survey and a representative sample of the population . Specific objectives are to describe the time trends in the number of social contacts , overall and by location ( home , work , school , public transport , leisure , other ) and by key socio - demographic characteristics . METHODS Study design CONNECT ( CONtact and Network Estimation to Control Transmission ) is a population - based survey of epidemiologically relevant social contacts and mixing patterns conducted in the province of Quebec , Canada . The first phase of CONNECT was conducted in 2018 - 2019 ( February 2018 to March 2019 ) , one year before the Covid - 19 pandemic . Four additional phases of CONNECT were undertaken to document changes in social contacts during the COVID - 19 pandemic period ( CONNECT2 : April 21 st - May 25 th 2020 and CONNECT3 , 4 , 5 : July 3 rd 2020 - February 26 th 2021 ) ( Appendix , Table S1 ) . All CONNECT phases were conducted with the same methodology . Recruitment of participants The target population of CONNECT consisted of all non - institutionalized Quebecers without any age restriction ( e . g . , elderly living in retirement homes who generally have personal phone lines were .

We used random digit dialling to recruit participants . The randomly generated landline and mobile phone number sample was provided by ASDE , a Canadian firm specialized in survey sampling ( 3 ) . After having explained the study , verified eligibility of the household and documented the age and sex of all household members , we randomly selected one person per household to participate in the study , using a probability sample stratified by age . This recruitment procedure was sequentially repeated for every new phase of CONNECT ( i . e , new participants were recruited for every CONNECT phase ) . Data collection We collected data using a self - administered web - based questionnaire . A secured individualized web link to the questionnaire and information about the study were sent by email to each selected participant who consented to participate in the study . Parents of children aged less than 12 years were asked to complete the questionnaire on behalf of their child , whereas teenagers aged 12 - 17 years completed their own questionnaire , after parental consent . The same questionnaire was used for all CONNECT phases . The first section of the questionnaire documented key socio - demographic characteristics . The second section was a social contact diary , based on instruments previously used in Polymod and other similar studies ( 4 - 6 ) ( an example of the diary is provided in the Appendix , Figure S1 ) . Briefly , participants were assigned two random days of the week ( one week day and one weekend day ) to record every different person they had contact with between 5 am and 5 am the following morning . A contact was defined as either physical ( handshake , hug , kiss ) or nonphysical ( two - way conversation in the physical presence of the person , at a distance equal or less than 2 meters , irrespective of masking ) . Participants provided the characteristics of the contact persons ( age , sex , ethnicity , and relationship to themselves ( e . g . , household member , friend , colleague ) ) as well as characteristics of the contacts with this person : location where the contact ( s ) occurred ( home , work , daycare / school , public transport , leisure , other location ) , duration , usual frequency of contact with that person , and whether the contact was physical or not . Participants reporting more than 20 professional contacts per day were asked not to report all their professional contacts in the diary . Instead they were asked general questions about these professional contacts : age groups of the majority of contact persons , average durations of contacts and whether physical contacts were generally involved or not . Additional questions about teleworking were included from CONNECT2 onwards . .

All participants gave their consent to participate in the study during the recruitment phone call . Analyses We weighted the participants of the CONNECT 1 - 5 surveys by age , sex , region ( Greater Montreal and other Quebec regions ) , and household composition ( households without 0 - 17 - year - olds , households with 0 - 5 - year - olds , if not with 6 - 14 - year - olds , if not with 15 - 17 - year - olds ) , using the Quebec data of the 2016 Canadian census and we verified that they were representative of the Quebec population for key socio - demographic characteristics . To obtain daily number of social contacts on a weekly basis , we weighted the number of daily contacts reported during the week ( 5 / 7 ) and the weekend ( 2 / 7 ) . We classified the type of employment of workers using the 2016 National occupation classification ( NOC ) ( 7 ) . We estimated the number of social contacts per person and per day , for all locations combined and for 6 different locations : home , work , school , public transportation , leisure , and other locations . To do so , several steps were necessary . First , for a contact person met in more than a single location during a single day , the location of the contact was assigned in the following hierarchical order , according to risk of transmission : home , work , school , public transport , leisure and other locations ( 8 ) . For example , if a parent reported contacts with his child at home , in public transportation and in a leisure activity , we only considered the home contact to avoid counting contacts with the same person multiple times . Second , for workers reporting more than 20 professional contacts per working day , we added their reported number of professional contacts to the work location for their working day ( s ) . Similar to other studies which allowed a maximal number of contacts per day ( 4 , 5 , 9 ) , we truncated professional contacts at a maximum of 40 per day to eliminate extreme values and contacts at low risk of transmission of infectious diseases . Third , we identified all workers in schools through their NOC code and job descriptions and attributed their professional contacts to the school location . We did so to describe social contacts in schools , not only between students , but also between students and their teachers , educators , and other school’s workers . Unless specified , we estimated the mean number of contacts in the different locations using a population - based denominator . With this method , all individuals were considered in the denominator of each location had they reported contacts or not for that location . The sum of contacts in the different locations gives the total number of contacts . .

We used data collected from February 1 st 2018 to March 17 th 2019 as our pre - Covid period . We used data collected from April 21 st to May 25 th 2020 to represent the first wave , data collected from July 3 rd to August 31 st 2020 to represent the summer , and data collected from September 1 st 2020 to February 26 th 2021 to represent the second wave . We further stratified the second wave to represent periods of expected seasonality in social contacts : September with the return to school and at work , fall with gathering restrictions , the Christmas holidays with school and work vacations and closure of non - essential business , January and February 2021 with the gradual return to work and school after Christmas vacations and school / non - essential business closures , and the introduction of a curfew . We compared the mean number of social contacts over time ( total or by location ) using weighted generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and an identity link . Generalized estimating equations with robust variance ( 10 ) were used to account for the correlation between the two days of diary data collection and overdispersion . We also compared the mean number of social contacts according to different key socio - demographic characteristics using the same procedure and adjusting for age . Results are presented as the absolute difference in the mean number of contacts compared to the previous period or between subgroups . All statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9 . 4 . RESULTS Participants A total of 1291 , 546 , and 4970 Quebecers completed the social contact questionnaires during the pre - Covid period ( CONNECT1 ) , the first wave ( CONNECT2 ) , and summer 2020 and second wave ( CONNECT3 - 5 ) , respectively . Participation rates ( number of questionnaires completed among consenting participant ) were 30 % , 38 % , and 34 % for CONNECT 1 , 2 , and 3 - 5 respectively ( Appendix Figure S3 ) . These participants were generally representative of the Quebec general population , and they were comparable across the different phases of CONNECT ( Table 1 ) . Time trends in the number of social contacts During the pre - pandemic period , the mean number of social contacts per person per day was 7 . 8 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 7 . 2 - 8 . 5 ) ( Figure 1 and Appendix Table S2 ) . This number decreased . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

It then increased gradually during summer 2020 and peaked at 5 . 0 ( 95 % CI : 4 . 3 - 5 . 8 ) contacts / day in September ; this peak coincided with the return to school and work . The mean number of contacts decreased significantly again during fall 2020 to 4 . 1 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 7 - 4 . 5 ) when physical distancing measures were intensified in Quebec to control the second wave . The mean number of social contacts also decreased significantly during the Christmas holidays at 2 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 7 - 3 . 1 ) because of school and work vacations and closure of non - essential businesses . There was a trend towards increasing numbers of contacts in January ( 3 . 5 , 95 % CI ( 3 . 0 - 3 . 9 ) ) with the gradual return to school and in February 2021 ( 4 . 0 , 95 % CI ( 3 . 3 - 4 . 6 ) ) with the re - opening of non - essential businesses . During the pre - pandemic period , the great majority of contacts occurred at home ( 2 . 3 contacts : 1 . 2 with household members and 1 . 1 with visitors ) , at work ( 2 . 7 contacts ) and at school ( 1 . 6 contacts ) . The mean number of contacts at home with household members remained relatively constant over time ( 1 . 2 to 1 . 4 contacts ) , whereas the number of contacts at home with visitors varied significantly through the study period with lower numbers observed during the spring 2020 lockdown , in January and February 2021 ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 contacts ) . Compared to the pre - pandemic period , contacts at work and school decreased significantly during the spring lockdown ( 1 . 2 and 0 . 0 , respectively ) , summer ( 1 . 2 and 0 . 2 ) and the holidays ( 0 . 8 and 0 . 0 ) and peaked in September 2020 ( 1 . 5 and 0 . 9 ) with the return at work and school . Contacts in the other locations ( transport , leisure and other ) represented a small proportion of overall contacts during the pre - pandemic period ( 1 . 3 contacts ) . They also decreased significantly since the beginning of the pandemic and stayed low through the study period . Time trends in the number of social contacts by age The location of social contacts varied substantially by age ( Figure 2 , Appendix Table S3 ) . Contacts in households represented an important part of contacts for all age groups . Contacts in other locations were highly dependent on age . The main locations of contacts away from home for individuals aged 0 - 17 , 18 - 65 , and > 65 years were , respectively , school , work , and other locations . During the pre - pandemic period , the mean number of social contacts at school / daycare for youth aged 0 - 17 years was 3 . 3 contacts ( Figure 2A ) . These contacts significantly decreased to nearly 0 during the spring 2020 lockdown and the Christmas holidays . They reached the pre - pandemic level with the return to school in September ( 4 . 0 contacts ) , during fall 2020 ( 3 . 0 ) and in February 2021 ( 3 . 7 ) . Except for post - secondary , similar time trends in contacts at school / daycare were observed by education level ( daycare , elementary , high school ) ( Appendix Table S4 ) . .

These contacts significantly decreased to 1 . 7 during the spring 2020 lockdown and thereafter remained significantly lower than the pre - pandemic period ( from 1 . 3 during the Christmas holidays to 2 . 7 in September ) . The number of contacts at work varied by the type of occupation and the proportion of workers reporting teleworking , and therefore having no contact at work ( Appendix Tables S5 , S6 ) . During the pre - pandemic period , the greatest number of contacts at work were reported by workers in the domains of Sales & services ( 10 . 8 ) , Management ( 10 . 2 ) , and Health ( 10 . 1 ) . Contacts at work decreased during the spring 2020 lockdown for the majority of domains and remained lower than the pre - pandemic period thereafter . Except for workers in the domains of Health and Sales & Services , the majority of workers in the other domains ( > 50 % ) reported teleworking since the beginning of the pandemic . During the pre - pandemic period , the mean number of social contacts in other locations for adults older than 65 years was 1 . 6 ( Figure 2C ) . These contacts decreased significantly at the beginning of the pandemic and remained low through the study period ( between 0 . 2 and 0 . 8 ) . Therefore , adults older than 65 years had virtually no contact outside their house during this period . Time trends in the number of social contacts by key socio - demographic characteristics During the pre - pandemic period , the mean number of social contacts was significantly higher among individuals living in households with ≥ 3 individuals ( vs households with 1 - 2 individuals ) , in households with 0 - 17 - year - olds ( vs household without 0 - 17 - year - olds ) , among native French or English speakers ( vs other mother tongues ) , and among individuals with a university degree ( vs no degree ) ( Figure 3 , Appendix Table S3 ) . During the first wave , social contacts significantly decreased for most socio - demographic characteristics . The mean number of social contacts slightly increased after the first wave for all socio - demographic characteristics , although it remained lower than the pre - pandemic period through the study period . During the second wave , the only significant differences between socio - demographic characteristics were a higher number of contacts in households with more individuals and / or households with 0 - 17 - year - olds , mainly explained by the greater number of contacts with household members . Of note , individuals with a university degree had the greatest decrease of their social contacts during the first wave ( from 10 . 7 to 2 . 5 , p < 0 . 0001 ) and their contacts remained relatively low through the study period ( 2 . 5 to 4 . 4 ) . .

Contacts decreased from a mean of 8 contacts per day prior to the pandemic to 3 contacts per day during the spring 2020 lockdown , a 60 % decline . Contacts then increased gradually during the summer to peak at 5 contacts per day in September with the return to school and at work ( 36 % decline vs pre - Covid ) . Contacts decreased thereafter during the fall 2020 and winter 2021 to about 4 contacts per day as the physical distancing measures were intensified in Quebec to control the second wave of Covid - 19 ( 47 % decline vs pre - Covid ) . Contacts at work , at school , in leisure activities , and at home with visitors showed the greatest changes through the study period . Before the pandemic , adults aged 18 - 65 years , individual with a university degree , those living in households with 3 or more individuals and / or in households with 0 - 17 - year - olds , and native French or English speakers reported the greatest number of social contacts . Contacts decreased significantly among all socio - demographic subgroups during the spring 2020 lockdown and remained lower than the pre - pandemic period through the study period . Our results indicating a 60 % reduction of social contacts during the spring 2020 lockdown in Quebec ( from 7 . 8 to 3 . 1 ) are generally consistent with the results from similar studies . The CoMix survey , an ongoing empirical study of social contacts conducted in several European countries ( 11 - 13 ) , estimated a 70 - 80 % reduction in the number of social contacts during the spring 2020 lockdown compared to similar studies conducted in 2006 ( POLYMOD ) and 2010 ( 4 , 14 ) . For example , contacts decreased from 10 . 8 in 2006 ( 4 ) to 2 . 8 contacts per day during the lockdown in United Kingdom ( 11 ) . A Canadian study also estimated a 56 - 80 % reduction in social contacts in May , July , September and December 2020 ( 15 ) compared to POLYMOD data collected in United Kingdom in 2006 ( 4 ) . However , it is difficult to determine , from these studies , which part of the decrease is related to socio - demographic changes between 2006 / 2010 and 2020 and to the Covid - 19 pandemic . Furthermore , the authors of the Canadian study recognized that social contacts collected in the United Kingdom in 2006 may not be representative of Canadian contacts before the pandemic ( 15 ) . Other studies from different countries ( e . g . Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Netherlands , Spain , United Kingdom , United States , Luxembourg , China ) have also estimated a mean of around 3 contacts per day during the spring 2020 lockdown period ( 12 , 16 - 19 ) and similar increasing trends in social contacts after the first lockdown when physical distancing measures were relaxed ( 12 , 18 , 20 ) . Our results are also consistent with Google phone mobility data for Quebec showing substantial decreases in visits of about 80 % in retail & recreation , work , and transit transportation stations during the spring 2020 lockdown compared to .

Mobility increased thereafter but remained lower than the pre - Covid levels for these locations ( mean decreases of 20 % , 25 % and 45 % for visits in retail & recreation , work , and transit transportation stations , respectively , from September to Mid - December 2020 ) ( 21 ) . To our knowledge this is one of the few population - based studies of social contacts worldwide to compare social contacts during the pandemic to those documented shortly before the pandemic using the same methodology . Only one other study conducted in the Netherland included social contacts documented shortly before the pandemic ( in 2016 - 2017 ) and during the pandemic using the same methodology ( 18 ) . However , CONNECT has some limitations . Firstly , previous data suggested that social contacts measured with survey methodology could underestimate the number of social contacts compared with a sensors methodology , particularly for contacts of short duration ( 22 , 23 ) . More specifically , parents participating in CONNECT reported difficulties in reporting contacts at school on behalf of their child . Secondly , although CONNECT is population - based with a random recruitment of the general population , volunteer participants may differ from those refusing to participate in the study and may be those adhering the most to the public health measures . However , we have collected a wealth of information regarding the participant’s characteristics and we are confident that the recruitment process was successful in providing a sample of participants generally representative of the Quebec general population ( in terms of region , participation rate to education and employment , race , country of origin and mother tongue ) , and samples are comparable across the different phases of the study . Thirdly , given that public health measures undertaken aimed at limiting social contacts , social desirability may have contributed to an underestimation of contacts . Some participants may not have reported all their contacts , particularly contacts forbidden by public health measures . These three main limitations would likely bias our results towards an underestimation of social contacts . Nonetheless , changes in social contacts measured in our study closely followed the epidemiology and physical distancing measures in Quebec ( Appendix Figure S2 ) . For example , the beginning of the second wave coincided with an increasing number of social contacts related to school and work return in September . The number of cases stabilisation / decrease of the second wave coincided with a decreasing number of contacts related to the intensification of public health measures in January and February 2020 . Our results have important implications for Covid - 19 control and policy decisions in Quebec and elsewhere . First , continuous monitoring of social contacts represents a measure of the effectiveness of public health measures aiming at reducing social contacts to contain and prevent Covid - 19 transmission . Our results suggest that Quebecers have been generally adherent to public health .

For example , restriction of household contacts with visitors was an important public health measure during the spring lockdown and since October 2020 in Quebec ; this is clearly reflected by the small number of household contacts with visitors during the spring and fall 2020 . Second , data on age - and location - specific changes in social contacts are proxies for contact events that can lead to transmission when made between susceptible and infectious individuals and are an essential input for transmission - dynamic mathematical models considering different types of contacts . Our social contacts data have been integrated and were regularly updated into our Covid - 19 mathematical model for projections of the potential evolution of the pandemic in Quebec to help inform policy decisions ( 24 ) . Finally , social contact data can generate hypothesis to improve our understanding of the Covid - 19 transmission dynamics . For example , an important increase in the number of cases while the number of contacts remains relatively stable could suggest that the virus became more transmissible per contact . Hypothesis such as the introduction of a new variant more transmissible in a region , new transmission modes , or a higher transmissibility of the virus for specific meteorological conditions could then be explored . In conclusion , physical distancing measures in Quebec were effective at significantly decreasing social contacts , which most likely helped prevent Covid - 19 spread and generalized overflow of hospital capacity . It is important to continue monitoring contacts as vaccines are rolled out . .
