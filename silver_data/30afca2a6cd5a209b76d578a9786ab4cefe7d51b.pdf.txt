Gfinthert CD44 variant isoforms are preferentially expressed in basal epithelia of non - malignant human fetal and adult tissues Accepted : 21 December 1993 Abstract CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein , which can exist in a multitude of isoforms due to alter - native splicing of the pre - mRNA . We have generated monoclonal antibodies to several of these variant re - gions , which are encoded by 10 additional exons in the extracellular part of the molecule . CD44 variant iso - forms have been reported to be involved in the malig - nant progression of rat and human tumours . The pre - cise localization of CD44 variant isoforms in normal developmental and morphogenetic processes is essential for diagnostic studies of human tumorigenesis . There - fore , we have analysed a large number of different hu - man tissues by immunohistochemistry for the expres - sion of CD44 isoforms containing either exons 4v , 6v or 9v . Expression of exon 9v - isoforms was detected in al - most all epithelia analysed , with a few exceptions . Exon 6v isoforms are expressed only in squamous and glan - dular epithelia , e . g . skin epidermis , sweat and sebaceous glands , oesophagus , ducts of the mammary gland , sali - vary and prostate glands . Detection of exon 4v - encoded isoforms was restricted to the epidermis and the oesoph - agus . Similar tissue distributions of CD44 variant iso - forms were observed in 10 - week - old fetal tissues . Since one of the ligands of CD44 is hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , we also analysed the tissue distribution of HA synthetase . HA synthetase was detected in all tissues analysed , showing good correlation with the expression of the standard form of CD44 , CD44s . H . - J . Terpe - H .

While the so - called standard or haematopoietic form of CD44 ( CD44s / CD44H ) is widely distributed in lymphoid and non - lymphoid tissues ( Haynes et al . 1991 ; Picker et al . 1989 ; Underhill 1992 ) , the variant isoforms seem to be highly restricted in their tissue dis - tribution . CD44s is known as the principal receptor for hyaluronic acid ( HA ) ; fibronectin and collagen are fur - ther extracellular matrix molecules which may bind to CD44s ( Jalkanen and Jalkanen 1992 ; Underhill 1992 ) . This molecule has been implicated to play an essential role in several physiological processes , such as lymphocyte homing , T - cell activation , lymphohaemo - poiesis , cell migration and wound healing ( Haynes et al . 1989 , 1991 ; Underhill 1992 ) . Twenty exons encode the human , rat and murine CD44 genes , of which at least 10 participate in the pro - cess of alternative RNA splicing ( Screaton et al . 1992 ) . Exon lv is , however , not expressed in humans because of a stop codon ( Screaton et al . 1993 ) . In the human extracellular region at amino acid position 223 the addi - tional sequences are inserted ( Hofmann et al . 1991 ) . In - terest in CD44 isoforms arose when a functional corre - lation between the expression of variant exon 6 ( exon 6v ) and metastasis formation in rat was observed ( Gtin - thert etal . 1991 ; Reber etal . 1990 ; Rudy etal . 1993 ; Seiter et al . 1993 ) . Exon 6v isoform ( CD44 - 6v ) expres - sion was similarly correlated to human tumour progres - sion ( Heider et al . 1993a ; Koopman et al . 1993 ; Mat - sumura and Tarin 1992 ; Tanabe et al . 1993 ) . Due to an earlier lack of variant specific monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) until recently ( Fox et al . 1993 ; Koopman et al . 1993 ; Mackay et al . 1994 ) , a profound analysis of the distribution of CD44 variant isoforms in non - malignant tissues was still missing . HA , the major ligand of CD44 , is ubiquitous in con - nective tissues and epithelia ( Green et al . 1988 ; Wang 80 et al . 1992 ) . The eukaryotic HA synthetase complex , consisting of two subunits of 52 - and 60 kDa , has re - cently been isolated ( Klewes et al . 1993 ) . In the present study we have utilized mAbs recently produced against CD44 variant isoforms ( Mackay et al . 1994 ) and to HA synthetase ( Klewes et al . 1993 ) , in order to screen fetal and adult human non - malignant tissues . In contrast to the wide tissue distribution of CD44s , CD44v isoforms exhibit a highly limited and specific pattern of expres - sion , being mainly localized in basal layers of epithelia ; HA synthetase generally occurs in parallel to the pres - ence of CD44s . Materials and methods Tissues Normal human tissues were obtained immediately post - mortem , or from biopsies or resected tissues after surgery from the clinics of the Justus - Liebig - University in Giessen . Fetal tissues were re - ceived from the Department of Gynaecology at the Justus - Liebig - University in Giessen . Tissues for immunohistological staining were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at - 70°C until use . Immunohistochemistry The generation and specificity of the mAbs used was described previously ( Klewes et al . 1993 ; Mackay et al . 1994 ) . Briefly , mAb 11 . 24 recognizes an epitope in the exon 9v - encoded region of CD44v ; mAbs 11 . 31 and 11 . 9 recognize epitopes in the exon 6v - encoded region of CD44v ; mAb 11 . 10 recognizes an epitope in the exon 4v - encoded region of CD44v ( Mackay et al . 1994 ) . mAb 25 . 32 is directed against an epitope in exon 5s of CD44 from sheep and cross - reacts with human antigens ( Mackay et al . 1988 ) . cz - 56 recognizes eukaryotic HA synthetase ( Klewes et al . 1993 ) . Frozen sections of 5 gm in thickness were prepared and specific detection was performed by the alkaline - phosphatase - anti - alkaline - phos - phatase ( APAAP ) technique ( Cordell et al . 1984 ) using modifica - tions which had been described earlier ( see Mackay et al . 1994 ) . Evaluation of the stainings was performed with an Olympus mi - croscope ( BH - 2 ) and an adjusted Olympus camera . Semi - quanti - tative analyses of staining intensities were classified as follows : + + + , strong expression in all cells ; + + , strong expression in 2 / 3 of the cells ; + , strong expression in 1 / 3 of the cells ; ( ) , weak expression ; - , no detectable expression . Results Expression of CD44 variant isoforms and HA synthetase in epithelial tissues The immunohistochemical analyses obtained for the ex - pression of CD44s and CD44v in adult epithelial tissues are summarized in Table 1 . In general , detection of CD44 exon 9v - containing isoforms , as determined by immunoreactivity with mAb 11 . 24 ( Mackay et al . 1994 ) , paralleled the reaction with mAb 25 . 32 ( Figs . le , f and 2c , d ) , recognizing an epitope in the standard region of CD44 ( Mackay et al . 1988 ) . Most of the epithelia were strongly positive for CD44 - 9v as in the epidermis ( Fig . lf ) , the sweat and sebaceous glands , the ducts of the mammary glands , the salivary gland ( Fig . 3a ) , the thy - roid gland , the lungs ( Fig . 2d ) , the trachea ( Fig . 3c ) , the oesophagus ( Fig . 3b ) , the pancreas , the urinary bladder ( Fig . 3t ) , the uterus ( Fig . 3e ) , bile ducts , the prostate gland ( Fig . 3g ) and the epididymis ( Fig . 3h ) ( Table 1 ) . Less intense staining was observed in the stomach and in the small ( Fig . 3d ) and the large intestine . No expres - sion of CD44 - 9v could be detected in the brain , islets of Langerhans , the kidney ( or very weakly ) , the acinus cells of the pancreas , hepatocytes , adrenal glands and the ovaries ( Table 1 ) . Expression was often restricted to the basal layer of the epithelium or the base of the crypts ( stomach and intestine ) . Exon 6v - specific isoforms have been detected pre - dominantly in squamous epithelia , as in the skin [ epi - dermis ( Fig . lg ) , sweat and sebaceous glands ] , ducts of the mammary gland , ducts of the salivary gland , in the Table 1 Immunohistochemical staining of CD44 ( standard and variant isoforms ) and hyaluronate ( HA ) synthetase in human epithelial tissues . + + + , Strong staining in all cells ; + + , strong staining in about 2 / 3 of the cells ; + , strong staining in about 1 / 3 of the cells ; 0 , weak staining ; - , no staining ; n . d . not determined Tissue CD44s CD44 - 9v CD44 - 6v CD44 - 4v HA - synthetase ( 25 . 32 ) ( 11 . 24 ) ( 11 . 9 + 11 . 31 ) ( 11 . 10 ) ( ~ - 56 ) Skin : Epidermis Basal cell layer + + + + + + + + + Spinous cell layer + + + + + + + + + Other cell layers - - Sweat gland Acinus cells + + + + + + + + + Ducts + + + + + Sebaceous glands Acinus cells + + + a + + + ~ + + + a Mammary gland : Ducts Epithelial cells + + + + + + + Myoepithelial cells + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + - + + + - + + + - + + + - + + + + + + Table 1 ( Continued ) Tissue CD44s CD44 - 9v CD44 - 6v CD44 - 4v HA - synthetase ( 25 . 32 ) ( ll . 24 ) ( 11 . 9411 . 31 ) ( 11 . 10 ) ( ~ - 56 ) Brain : Ependymal cells - - - Epithelium of choroid plexus - - - Cells of arachnoid + Salivary gland : Acinus cells + + 4 + + + - Intercalated portion + + + + + + - Ducts + + 4a 4 + + a + a Thyroid gland : Follicular cells + + + + + - Lung : Respiratory epithelium + + 4 a 4 4 4 a ( 4 ) Pneumocytes + + + + + + ( + 4 ) Oesophagus : Squamous epithelium + + + a + + + a + + + a Trachea + + + + + + a _ Stomach : Epithelial cells + 4 a 4 a - - Surface epithelium - - - Small intestine : Epithelial cells + + a 4 a - Surface epithelium - - - Large intestine : Epithelial cells + + a + ~ _ Surface epithelium - Liver : Hepatocytes - - - Bile ducts 4 + + 4 + + - Pancreas : Acinar cells - - - Centroacinar cells + + + + + + - Intercalated ducts 4 4 4 4 4 4 - Ducts 4 + + - Islets of Langerhans - - - Adrenal gland - - Kidney : Proximal tubules - - - Distal tubules ( + ) ( + ) Collecting tubules - - - Urinary bladder : Transitional epithelium + + + + + + ( 4 ) Uterus : Glands of endometrium + + + + + - Ovary : Follicular epithelium + + + - - Germinal epithelium - - - Prostate gland : Glands + 4 + + + + + Ducts + + + + + + ( + ) Epididymis : Ductuli efferentes + + + a + + + a _ a Staining of the basal layer n . d . n . d . n . d , + 44 + + 4 4 + 4 4 + 4 81 + + + + 4 + + 4 + a + + 4 - 4 + + + + 4 4 + + 4 + + ( + ) 4 + 4 ( + ) + + 4 + + 4 + + 4 + + + 4 + + 44 + 4 + + + 4 + 444 + + 4 + + 4 + + + + 4 + + + + 4 + 4 4 + 4 + 4 + + 4 + ~ T ~ , : ~ i ~ ¸ i ! i ~ ! i ~ : ? a ~ L b E ; kl C ; Yk d o ~ i ¸ ~ h 83 Fig . la - k Expression of CD44s , CD44v and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) synthetase in fetal and adult human skin .

Even more restricted than exon 6v was the expres - sion of exon 4v - containing isoforms , which were only detected in the epidermal layer of the skin ( Fig . lh ) and the oesophageal epithelium ( Table 1 ) . In both tissues expression was limited to the basal layer ( Fig . 1 ) . HA synthetase was strongly expressed in all epithelia tested and resembled the staining pattern obtained for CD44s ( Fig . li and 2e ) , with the following exceptions . In the mammary gland , expression of CD44s and CD44 - gv Fig . 3a - h Expression of CD44 - gv in adult epithelial tissues .

The origin of the tissues is described in the text . a - f , h x 200 ; g × 400 was much stronger compared to HA synthetase expres - sion , whereas the surface epithelium of the stomach , hepatocytes , acinar cells of the pancreas , the islets of Langerhans , the adrenal gland , the proximal and the collecting tubules of the kidney , and the germinal epi - thelium of the ovaries strongly express HA synthetase , but are virtually negative for CD44s and CD44 - gv ( Table 1 ) . Expression of CD44 variant isoforms in fetal epithelial tissues Ten - to eleven - week - old fetal tissues were examined for CD44 expression ( Table 2 ) . The distribution of CD44 - gv isoforms resembled that of CD44s , as observed for adult tissues , but fewer tissues were positive ( cf . Table 1 ) .

Exon 6v - contain - ing isoforms were also detected in the fetal skin ( Fig . lc ) , but we were unable to detect exon 4v isoforms in fetal tissues ( Table 2 ) . In general , the expression levels of CD44v isoforms detected in fetal tissues were lower compared to adult tissues . Expression of CD44 variant isoforms and HA synthetase in non - epithelial tissues Non - epithelial tissues were generally negative for the expression of CD44 variant isoforms , with the exception of some weak staining with the exon 6v - specific mAbs in microglia ( Table 3 ) . CD44s was expressed also strongly in several non - epithelial tissues , such as the nervous sys - tem ( astrocytes , microglia and stratum granulosum cerebellum ) , lymphatic tissue , fibroblasts , unstriated muscles , endothelium , Kupffer ' s cells , stromal cells of the ovary and the endometrium and Leydig ' s cells ( Table 3 ) . In contrast to unstriated muscle , other types of muscle , such as striated and heart muscle were virtually Table 4 Immunohistochemical staining of CD44 ( standard and variant isoforms ) in human fetal tissues .

All non - epithelial tissues tested were strongly positive for HA synthetase , except for the heart muscle , the kidney glomerulus and Bowman ' s capsule ( Table 3 ) . Expression of CD44 variant isoforms in non - epithelial fetal tissues With the exception of the Hassall ' s corpuscles in the thymus , which stained positively for all variant iso - forms , none of the non - epithelial tissues were positive for the variant - specific CD44 antibodies tested ( Table 4 ) . However , strong staining was observed for mAb 25 . 32 , detecting CD44s , in the nervous system , the lymphatic tissue , connective tissue , muscle , endothelium and very weakly in the kidney glomerulus and the germinal cells ( Table 4 ) . When comparing CD44 expression in fetal and adult tissue , the most prominent difference was the strong expression of CD44s in embryonic striated mus - cle , in contrast to the negative result obtained for adult striated muscle ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . Discussion CD44s has been known for several years as a transmem - brahe molecule , which is expressed on cells of raesoder - mal and neuroectodermal origin , generally showing co - localization with its predominant ligand , hyaluronic acid ( HA ; Picker et al . 1989 ; Underhill t992 ) . The aim of the present work is to present an extensive study on the location of the recently described CD44 variant iso - forms and of HA synthetase ( Lesley et al . 1993 ; Giin - thert 1993 ; Prehm 1989 ) . For a better comparison be - tween the expression of CD44s and CD44v , adult and fetal human non - malignant tissues have been analysed with mAbs recognizing CD44v , as well as CD44s . This compilation of protein expression data wilt prove valu - able for studies on human malignant tissues when possi - ble alterations of CD44v levels become evident . Previous studies on the expression of CD44s were less extensive and are generally confirmed by our data , with a few exceptions ( Picker et at . 1989 ; Alho and Un - derhill 1989 ; Wang et al . 1992 ; Heider etal . 1993a ) . While bile ducts , bronchial epithelium , endothelium , small and large intestine have been described as nega - tive or only weakly positive for CD44s ( Picker et al . 1989 ; Heider et al . 1993a ) , we have observed clearly pos - itive reactivity with mAb 25 . 32 , recognizing an epitope in exon 5 from the standard region ( Mackay et al . 1988 , t994 ) . Hyaluronate ( HA ) , the major ligand for CD44 ( Un - derhill 1992 ) is widely distributed in connective tissues and epithelia and thus parallels to a high degree the localization of CD44s ( Green et aI . 1988 ; Alho and Un - derhill 1989 ; Wang et al . 1992 ) . While generally a cell - matrix interaction is implied based on the co - localiza - tion of HA and its receptor , a few exceptions indicate 87 other possible ligands for CD44 ( v ) . For example , the epithelial cells of the oviduct and of the sebaceous and sweat glands are strongly positive for CD44s , but are negative or only weakly positive for HA ( Alho and Un - derhill 1989 ; Wang et al . 1992 ) . Since antibodies direct - ed against the standard form of CD44 detect all iso - forms , and because CD44 - 9v and - 6v isoforms are strongly expressed in sebaceous and sweat glands it is highly probable that predominantly variant isoform . s are expressed in these tissues . This would furthermore infer the existence of other ligand ( s ) specific for the vari - ant regions of CD44v . These co - expression studies and the availability of a specific mAb prompted us to analyse the expression of HA synthetase ( Prehm 1989 ; Klewes et al . t993 ) for cor - relation to CD44s . As for HA , the HA synthetase was mostly co - expressed with CD44s . There are a few excep - tions when CD44s could not be detected , or detected only . marginally , but HA synthetase was strongly present : granular epithelial layers of the skin , the sur - face epithelia of stomach , small and large intestine , hepatocytes , acinar and Langerhans ' cells of the pan - creas , the proximal and the collecting tubules of the kid - neys and the germinal epithelium of the ovaries . In non - epithelial tissues the most prominent differences are : nerve cells , germinal cells of the testis and Sertoli cells , expressing high levels of HA synthetase , but no CD44s . Thus as for the distribution of HA , HA synthetase is usually located close to the regions in which CD44s is expressed , confirming the data of other workers ( Under - hill 1992 ) , and implying a functional role for CD44s expressing cells and their binding abilities to the extra - cellular matrix . Since CD44 is not the only receptor for HA , it is likely that in those regions containing high levels of HA but almost no CD44 , receptors like RHAMM ( receptor for HA mediated motility ; Turley et al . 1993 ) and HABP ( HA binding protein ; Banerjee and Toole 1992 ) exclusively mediate cell - HA contacts , Much fewer data are available so far on the expres - sion of CD44 variants in non - malignant human tissues , since specific mAb were generated only recently ( Koop - man et al . 1993 ; Mackay et al . 1994 ; Fox et al . 1993 ) , Additionally , many of the mAb epitopes have not been determined exactly ( Koopman et al . 1993 ; Fox et al . 1993 ) thereby hampering comparisons of the data . Fur - thermore , Koopman and collaborators ( 1993 ) did not include data on the reactivity of their antibodies in nor - mal tissues . Their data can only be compared with the staining of polyclonal antibodies ( Heider et al . 1993a ) and with the recently generated mAbs from Fox and collaborators ( 1993 ) . mAb 2F10 , specific for exon 6v isoforms , strongly stains the thyroid and prostate gland , the transitional and respiratory epithelium ( Fox et aI . 1993 ) , whereas our 6v - specific mAbs , t . 1 . 31 and 11 . 9 , either do not react ( thyroid gland ) or react only weakly ( prostate gland , transitional and respiratory epitheli - um ) . This finding may be explained by different binding affinities of the mAbs and requires further substantia - tion . 88 mAb 2G9 , specific for exons 4 / 5 , reacts strongly with thyroid , prostate , breast , transitional and respiratory epithelium ( Fox et al . 1993 ) , whereas our 4v - specific mAb 11 . 10 is totally negative on these tissues . Although data on protein and RNA expression may not be fully comparable , reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain re - action ( RT PCR ) analyses of breast tissue revealed no presence of exon 4v - and 5v - specific RNA ( data not shown ) . The same discrepancy holds true for expression of exon 3v , for which we do not have any evidence of expression in breast tissue based on RT PCR analyses . Since mAbs for CD44 - 3v are now available , it will be feasible to perform detailed immunohistochemistry ( Fox et al . 1993 ) . mAb 1E8 , specific for exons 8 / 9v , only reacts to a very limited extent ( Fox et al . 1993 ) , in con - trast to our exon 9v - specific mAb 11 . 24 , which reacts virtually with all epithelial tissues . This may not be explained satisfactorily by undetermined epitope specificities , since detailed RT PCR analyses revealed that in epithelia usually exons 8v , 9v and 10v are co - ex - pressed , encoding the so - called epithelial form of CD44 , CD44E ( Stamenkovic et al . 1991 ; Gfinthert 1993 ) . In conclusion , we have analysed the distribution of CD44 - 4v , - 6v and - 9v variant isoforms in non - malig - nant human tissues and compared it to the expression of the standard molecule CD44s and to HA synthetase , which generates the most abundant ligand for CD44 ( Prehm 1989 ; Underhill 1992 ) . Based on our studies , it is tempting to speculate on the involvement of certain CD44 isoforms in malignant processes ( Gfinthert et al . t991 ) . Correlations are more likely to be found between exon 6v - specific isoforms and the progression state of the tumour or the probablity to develop metastases , when exon 6v cannot be detected in the non - malignant state , e . g . in the stomach ( Mayer et al . 1993 ; Heider et al . 1993b ) , the intestine ( Heider et al . 1993a ; Wielenga et al . 1993 ) , the liver , the pancreas , the kidneys , the uterus and ovaries . On the other hand , tissues like the mammary and the bronchial epithelium as well as the prostate gland , which do already express exon 6v - containing iso - forms , seem not to be good candidates for the analysis of 6v involvement in tumour progression .
