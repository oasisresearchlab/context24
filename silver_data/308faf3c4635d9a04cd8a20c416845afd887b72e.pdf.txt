Louis , MO 63110 , USA Summary The protein actin forms filaments that provide cells with mechanical support and driving forces for movement . Actin contributes to biological processes such as sensing environmental forces , internalizing membrane vesicles , moving over surfaces and dividing the cell in two . These cellular activities are complex ; they depend on interactions of actin monomers and filaments with numerous other proteins . Here , we present a summary of the key questions in the field and suggest how those questions might be answered . Understanding actin - based biological phenomena will depend on identifying the participating molecules and defining their molecular mechanisms . Comparisons of quantitative measurements of reactions in live cells with computer simulations of mathematical models will also help generate meaningful insights . Life on earth arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor that lived ~ 3 billion years ago . Among its ~ 400 genes was the ancestral gene encoding actin ( 1 ) . Actin and its bacterial counterparts polymerize into filaments ( Fig . 1 ) that offer myriad advantages to cells . High cellular concentrations of actin make the protein one of the most abundant on earth . Actin is essential for the survival of most cells : filaments provide internal mechanical support , tracks for movements of intracellular materials and force to drive cell movements . Many modern species of prokaryotes use actin relatives to maintain asymmetrical shapes and to move DNA through the cytoplasm . Essentially all eukaryotes have genes for actin , and most have genes for myosin motor proteins that generate forces on actin filaments ( 2 ) . In animals actin filaments complement two other cytoskeletal polymers , microtubules and intermediate filaments ( Fig . 1B ) . Actin and myosin were discovered during the 1940s in muscle , where the two proteins comprise highly regular arrays of filaments that make up more than half of the total protein . Pioneering research on muscle established general principles that apply to actin assembly and function in all cells , including the mechanism used by myosin to produce force and movement from ATP hydrolysis ( 3 ) . Two decades later , actin and myosin were discovered in other cells ( 4 ) ( 5 ) , revealing that muscle filaments are a specialized example of a common cellular system . Subsequent research identified numerous proteins that regulate actin , analyzed their mechanisms of action and linked the proteins to cellular processes . Under physiological conditions , actin monomers ( Fig . 2A ) spontaneously polymerizes into long stable filaments ( Fig . 2B ) with a helical arrangement of subunits ( for review see ( 6 ) ) . Polymerization starts slowly , because small oligomers are very unstable , but once filaments * To whom correspondence should be addressed : thomas . pollard @ yale . edu .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t have been created , then actin polymerizes rapidly and almost completely . Actin filaments are polar , because the subunits in the filament all point in the same direction . One end of the filament grows much faster than the other end . Actin binds an adenine nucleotide ( ATP or ADP ) , and soon after assembly into filaments , actin hydrolyzes the terminal phosphate from the bound ATP and slowly dissociates the phosphate . Subtle changes in the structure of the actin subunits associated with these chemical reactions prepare ADP - actin filaments for disassembly by regulatory proteins . Eukaryotic cells use > 100 accessory proteins to maintain a pool of actin monomers , initiate polymerization , restrict the length of actin filaments , regulate the assembly and turnover of actin filaments and crosslink filaments into networks or bundles ( Fig . 2C - F ) . The mechanisms forming new filaments include growing a branch on the side of an existing filament , severing a filament to create two new ends or starting up a filament from monomers . Genes for most of these accessory proteins were in place about 1 billion years ago when the top branches formed on the phylogenetic tree , so amoebas , fungi and animals share many molecular mechanisms that run their actin systems ( 2 ) . Some species , such as the intestinal parasite Giardia , lack genes for myosin and many actin - binding proteins . These organisms may have diverged before these genes emerged ( 7 ) , or they may have lost these genes , just as plants lost more than 200 genes required for the assembly of cilia and flagella ( 8 ) . Polymerization of actin filaments drives the crawling locomotion of eukaryotic cells , a characteristic feature of amoebae and animal cells ( Fig . 3G ) . Actin polymerization also contributes to the internalization of membrane vesicles to control the composition of the cell membrane and the interface of the cell with the environment . Interactions of myosin motor proteins with actin filaments ( Fig . 2G ) produce two types of movements . First , myosin generates force between actin filaments , producing contractions that pull up the rear of moving cells ( Fig . 3G ) , pinch dividing cells in two ( Fig . 3D , E ) and change cellular shapes to form tissues . A similar mechanism contracts muscle cells . Second , myosins associated with subcellular organelles and macromolecular complexes of proteins and RNA move these cargos along actin filaments over short distances ( Fig . 3C ) . In budding yeast cells , which are small , actin filament tracks are responsible for distributing nearly all of the organelles and secretory vesicles to daughter cells before cell division . Movement of cargo over longer distances in many other cell types involves microtubules and their motors . Questions to ask First , researchers need a complete list of parts to understand how the actin system or any biological system works . Do we know all the parts of the actin system ? We know many , but the list is far from complete . Second , which parts interact with other parts ? Third , how does this system of connected parts work as a whole ? Most biological systems are so complicated that their operations are not intuitively obvious , so mathematical models and simulations are needed to connect hypotheses with experimental observations ( 9 ) . Examples of Biological Processes that Depend on Actin Making connections between molecules and biology can be challenging . On one hand , any cellular process depends on many different proteins . On the other hand , a given molecule will contribute many processes , as shown by doing a PubMed search on any protein mentioned in this article . For example , recent publications provide evidence that cofilin participates in cancer , embryonic development , HIV infection , path finding by nerve cell axons , learning and memory , programmed cell death , Alzheimer’s disease , traffic of intracellular membranes , mitosis , cytokinesis , tight junctions and immune reactions of T - Pollard and Cooper Page 2 Science .

In each of the following examples , the inventories of participating molecules are more advanced than our understanding of the molecular mechanisms or the operations of these processes at the system level . Actin filaments as part of the cytoskeleton The protein polymers forming the cytoskeleton are responsible for the mechanical properties and shapes of cells , which are often critical to their functions . If the membranes of an human cell are dissolved away to release soluble components , a ghost - like meshwork of cytoskeletal polymers remains ( Fig . 1B ) ( 10 ) . The polymers include actin filaments , microtubules and intermediate filaments in various proportions and geometries . Actin filaments provide mechanical structure and motility for amoeboid and animal cells . Microtubules are responsible for separating chromosomes and long - range transport of large particles in all eukaryotes . Intermediate filaments in vertebrates function as intracellular ligaments and tendons to resist mechanical forces . Interactions among the three cytoskeletal polymers reinforce the cytoskeleton , although some crosslinking proteins exchange rapidly and the polymers themselves turn over on time scales of seconds to minutes . These features give the cytoplasm useful properties , such as being stiff when deformed rapidly and malleable when deformed slowly . Even the cells of plants and fungi , despite being encased in a cell wall , use cytoskeletal polymers to direct the shape of their compartments ( 11 ) . In addition , the cytoskeleton is part of a system that senses external forces applied to the cell along with the mechanical properties of the cell’s environment . This system can influence diverse aspects of cell function including gene expression and differentiation ( 12 ) . Actin Patches and Endocytosis Actin filaments assemble occurs at sites of plasma membrane internalization in budding and fission yeast ( 13 ) ( 14 ) . In these “actin patches” filaments assemble de novo , provide force to form and internalize an endocytic vesicle from the plasma membrane and then disassemble in a process that is self - limited in space and time ( Fig . 3A ) . While powerful molecular and genetic tools have identified ~ 30 to 50 participating proteins , the parts list still appears to be incomplete . Actin is associated with endocytosis in many cells besides yeast , with an apparently similar set of molecular players ( 15 ) . The process of endocytosis begins at multiple independent sites with the spontaneous assembly of membrane proteins along with clathrin and adaptor proteins . Next to be recruited are proteins including WASp family proteins and certain class - I myosins that bind to and / or activate Arp 2 / 3 complex , which creates new filaments as branches on older filaments ( Fig . 2E ) . The source of the very first filaments remains unclear . Capping protein limits the growth of actin filaments , and filaments are linked together along their sides by fimbrin , among other proteins . While assembly of such a network of filaments alone can create force sufficient to deform a membrane , specialized proteins associate with membrane to induce curvature . The density of actin filaments decreases rapidly as the endocytic vesicle moves into the cytoplasm , a process that depends on the filament severing protein cofilin , perhaps aided by proteins Aip1 and coronin ( 16 ) . Although actin patches are one of the best characterized actin systems , our understanding of these reactions is limited , and some apparently contradictory observations exist , illustrating just how little we know about the process . Bacterial comet tails After invading a eukaryotic cell , some bacteria usurp cellular proteins to assemble a comet tail of actin filaments for propulsion through the cytoplasm ( Figs . 1A , 3B , F ) . Nucleation - Pollard and Cooper Page 3 Science . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 June 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t promoting proteins on the surface of the bacterium recruit Arp2 / 3 complex to polymerize actin filaments . Growth of those filaments pushes the bacterium forward . The whole process can be reconstituted with the bacterial nucleation - promoting protein on the surface of a bead or lipid vesicle in a solution with purified actin , profilin , Arp2 / 3 complex , a capping protein and the severing protein cofilin ( 17 ) and simulated with a computer model ( 18 ) . Cytokinesis The physical separation of two daughter cells is the last step in the cell cycle ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Amoebae , fungi and animals use a contractile ring of actin filaments and myosin - II to pinch themselves in two . Myosin - II polymerizes into bipolar filaments , which can produce a contraction by pulling actin filaments together . Multi - cellular animals adapted the contractile ring machinery in specialized cells that evolved into muscle . Organisms on the other branch of the tree ( including algae , plants and ciliates ) lack myosin - II , so cytokinesis depends primarily on membrane fusion ( plants ) or on mechanisms that are not understood . Remarkably , prokayotes use a protein related to the microtubule subunit tubulin to assemble a ring of filaments that pinches these cells in two , much like a contractile ring but without the obvious participation of a motor protein ( 19 ) . Having started with a common genetic toolbox for cytokinesis , one expects amoebas , fungi and animals to use similar mechanisms for cytokinesis ( 20 ) . Nevertheless , the general principles are still cloudy for two reasons . First , the process is very complicated , involving the products of > 130 genes in fission yeast , a molecular inventory shared at least in part by other less well - characterized organisms . Second , some cells emphasize certain features more than other cells , because certain cytokinesis genes were added or lost from various lineages over the past billion years . Successful cytokinesis depends on ( i ) placing the cleavage furrow in the right place between the separated chromosomes , ( ii ) assembling , constricting and disassembling the contractile ring and ( iii ) fusing the plasma membrane between the daughter cells . In animal cells the information to place the cleavage furrow comes from the mitotic spindle , part from the poles of the spindle and part from the center of the spindle , where the chromosomes initially congregate . The cleavage site around the equator is marked with active signaling proteins called Rho - GTPases ( 21 ) . The mechanisms linking these GTPases to the assembly of the contractile ring are still being investigated . In fission yeast negative signals from the ends of the cell and positive signals from the centrally placed nucleus localize contractile ring precursors called nodes to the middle of the cell ( 20 ) . Nodes accumulate myosin - II along with a formin protein that nucleates the growth of actin filaments . Computer simulations established the feasibility of one hypothesis for the assembly of the ring : myosin molecules capture actin filaments growing randomly from adjacent nodes and pull the nodes together into a ring over 10 minutes ( 22 ) . Contractile ring assembly is less well understood in other cells ( 23 ) . After the mitotic apparatus separates the two daughter nuclei , the contractile ring constricts , pulling the cell membrane into a cleavage furrow . Remarkably , the proteins of the contractile ring disperse as it constricts . Membrane fusion resolves the membranes of the two daughter cells ( 24 ) . Actin Cables and Organelle Transport Many , perhaps all , eukaryotic cells , use myosin motors to transport organelles along actin filaments ( Fig . 3C ) . Budding yeast replicate by directing secretion of cell - wall materials to grow a bud from a particular location on the plasma membrane of a mother cell . At a pre - determined bud site , molecular polarity cues activate formins to nucleate actin filaments . A Pollard and Cooper Page 4 Science . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 June 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t formin remains associated with each fast - growing barbed end to promote elongation ( at 200 subunits per second ) and prevent capping . The uniformly polarized filaments form bundles that serve as tracks for the movement of organelles ( 25 ) . Class - V myosin walks toward the barbed ends of these filaments ( Fig . 2G ) and moves secretory vesicles and intracellular organelles to the bud ( 26 ) . Tropomyosin lies along the actin filaments to stabilize the bundles ; it may also influence the action of the myosin motor . Myosin - V also moves certain mRNAs on cables into the daughter , to influence cell fate and fitness . Fission yeast ( 27 ) and plant cells ( 28 ) also depend on formins to assemble uniformly polarized actin filament cables as tracks for transport of materials for polarized growth . In animal cells and in elongated fungal hyphae , long - range movements depend largely on microtubules , and actin filaments do not appear to be organized into cables of uniform polarity . However , myosins coordinate with microtubule motors to move organelles over short distances along the actin filaments ( 29 ) . Cellular motility Actin filaments are essential for cell locomotion , a defining feature of animal cells ( 30 ) . For example , cells of the immune system migrate to search and destroy pathogens or cancer cells . During development of animal embryos , some cells move from one location in the body to another , by crawling between neighboring cells and through the extracellular matrix . Cancer cells use similar mechanisms to spread through the body . Nerve cells provide spectacular examples of both cell migration and cell process extension . Neurons destined to control the intestine migrate large distances as neural crest cells during development ( 31 ) , nerve cells grow processes up to 1 meter long to find their targets and the human brain has 1 . 5 million km of such cellular processes . Assembly of actin filaments from their monomeric subunits can suffice to change the shape of the cell and produce a protrusion , which is often the first step in cell locomotion . Arp2 / 3 complex assembles a dense network of short , branched actin filaments ( Figs . 1C , 3B ) that grow in successive generations like the twigs of a bush ( 32 ) . Each filament can produce picoNewton forces ( 33 ) , allowing the front end of cells to move at rates up to about 1 μ m per second ( 34 ) . Most filaments are capped before growing longer than 0 . 5 μ m ; longer filaments would presumably buckle under force . Computer simulations reveal that the components have the capacity for self - organization into networks ( 35 ) . A short distance behind the leading edge , the network of branched filaments turns over within a few seconds , replaced by one composed of longer unbranched filaments ( 34 ) . Formins are logical candidates to help remodel the network in this manner , because formins are known to create long unbranched actin filaments in thin protrusions called filopodia ( 36 ) . The relative contributions of formins and Arp2 / 3 complex to motility have been difficult to sort out , in part because Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for viability and active at very low concentrations ( making depletion experiments difficult ) . Specific pharmacologic inhibitors for Arp2 / 3 complex only recently became available ( 37 ) . During cell locomotion , myosin interacts with actin filaments to pull up the rear of the cell , working as structural elements with myosin motor proteins . Conclusions The big questions for the actin system are not so much about “what happens” , but rather “how these systems work” at the molecular level . Given the common origin of the genes for the actin system , evolution should be able to help sort out the complicated mechanisms . Continuing focus on tractable model systems should help to establish the molecular basis for each actin - based function and general principles that apply more broadly .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t systems - level genomics approaches based on genetic and physical interactions in model organisms continues to grow the parts list and to reveal new interactions . The missing rate and equilibrium constants required to trace pathways and explain how molecules work together still need to be defined . The regulation of actin by signaling mechanisms and the interaction of actin with other cellular systems , such as membranes requires further attention . Technical advances should prove critical . For example , we can now image the behavior of single molecules over time , in vitro and in cells , and we can reconstitute complex processes using mixtures of purified components . Furthermore , advances in light and electron microscopy allow for nanometer - level localization of protein components and for measurement of global and local concentrations of molecules inside living cells . These advances should prove critical to advance our understanding of these actin systems , especially how and where filaments are created and assembled into networks of varying geometry . The field has only recently started to create mathematical models , at the microscopic , mesoscopic and macroscopic scales . Still , great progress has been made in several areas , such as understanding how the actin filaments in a protrusion assemble and create force on the plasma membrane ( 9 ) ( 18 ) ( 35 ) . Quantitative measurements in live cells aided by genetics , specific drugs and depletion strategies should provide the data required to test hypotheses embodied in mathematical models .
