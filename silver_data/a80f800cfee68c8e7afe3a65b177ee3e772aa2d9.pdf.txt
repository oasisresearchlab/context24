Introduction One of the tenets of combinatorial optimization is that given a choice , linear representations are pre - ferred to nonlinear model forms . This preference for linearity is well entrenched in the conventional wisdom of both the theory and practice of combina - torial optimization and in fact has served the optimi - zation community well over the years . Modern solution approaches like branch and cut and other methods designed to take full advantage of linearity have proven to be successful in practice , further underscoring the wisdom of the ‘‘linear choice’’ . Lin - ear representations also facilitate theoretical work aimed at understanding polyhedral ( and other ) properties of certain problems . Opting for linearity may not , however , be the best choice from a computational point of view in all cases . This is particularly true for certain combinato - rial problems that appear in their most natural form as nonlinear models but are ‘‘linearized’’ to enable the use of well - known solution methods designed for linear models . Successes with recent advances in metaheuristics and other solution approaches applicable to nonlinear models are calling the uni - versality of the tenet of linearity into question . In this paper , we illustrate this notion by examining 0377 - 2217 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2006 Elsevier B . V .

European Journal of Operational Research 181 ( 2007 ) 592 – 597 www . elsevier . com / locate / ejor the maximum edge - weighted clique problem , a well - known NP - hard problem . As detailed in several recent articles , this problem is typically solved in its linear form even though its most natural formula - tion is nonlinear . In the sections below we give the natural , nonlin - ear formulation for the maximum edge - weighted clique problem followed by the linear version com - monly appearing in the literature . We then comment on the metaheuristic procedure we use to solve the problem followed by some computational experi - ence comparing our approach with recently pub - lished results . We conclude with a brief summary and some ﬁnal remarks . 2 . Problem deﬁnition The maximum edge - weighted clique problem ( MEWCP ) can be deﬁned as follows : Given a com - plete graph G = ( V , E ) with n nodes and unrestricted edge weights c ij , ﬁnd a subclique of G with b or fewer nodes such that the sum of the weights in the subc - lique is maximized . Since a given edge weight is included in the sum only if the associated pair of nodes is in the subclique , a natural , nonlinear formu - lation of this problem is Quadratic model : max X n (cid:2) 1 i ¼ 1 X n j ¼ i þ 1 c ij x i x j s : t : X n j ¼ 1 x j 6 b ; x i 2 f 0 ; 1 g ; where x j equals 1 if node j is in the subclique ; else x j equals 0 . This formulation is equivalent to that con - sidered by Mehrotra ( 1997 ) . We note that this mod - el is of the form of the unconstrained quadratic binary program ( UQP ) UQP : max xQx x binary with the addition of a single cardinality constraint . This observation motivates the use of eﬃcient meta - heuristic methods for solving UQP to be applied to the problem considered here . The attractiveness of this approach is illustrated in Section 4 of this paper . While the above model appears to be a natural representation of the problem , several solution methods proposed in the literature for solving MEWCP are based not on the quadratic model but instead on an equivalent linearization of the form ( see for instance ( Macambira and de Souza , 2000 ) ) : Linear model : max X i ; j ; i < j c ij y ij s : t : y ij 6 x i 8ð i ; j Þ 2 E ; i < j y ij 6 x j 8ð i ; j Þ 2 E ; i < j x i þ x j (cid:2) y ij 6 1 8ð i ; j Þ 2 E ; i < j X j 2 V (cid:2)f i g y ij (cid:2)ð b (cid:2) 1 Þ x i 6 0 8 i 2 V y ij ; x i 2 f 0 ; 1 g ; where x j is deﬁned as in quadratic model above and y ij equals 1 if edge ( i , j ) is in the subclique ; else y ij equals zero . Note that the quadratic model is strictly a node - based model consisting of n variables and a single constraint . The linear model , which is obtained from the quadratic model via standard procedures for linearizing a quadratic function in binary vari - ables , is both node and edge - based , consisting of n + n ( n (cid:2) 1 ) / 2 variables and n + 3 n ( n (cid:2) 1 ) / 2 con - straints . Thus , the linear model , while amenable to solution strategies designed for linear models , is much larger than the quadratic model . The diﬀer - ences in size and structure between the two equiva - lent models make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the ease with which they can be solved . We illustrate this in the sections below . 3 . Solving MEWCP While MEWCP is NP - hard , considerable pro - gress has been made in recent years in designing and testing exact methods intended to solve the lin - ear model . Three recent articles standout as repre - sentative of these advances . Macambira and de Souza ( 2000 ) report on a branch and cut algorithm based on extensions of earlier work by Boros and Hammer ( 1993 ) and the work by Mehrotra ( 1997 ) . They report computational experience with a set of test problems that have become a standard test bed for other researchers in the area . Hunting et al . ( 2001 ) report on a Lagrangian Relaxation approach that combines standard Lagrangian meth - ods with cutting planes yielding a new approach to MEWCP . Finally , Sorensen ( 2004 ) reports on a new branch and cut method based on new classes of facet deﬁning inequalities for the associated b - clique polytope . The later two papers report B . Alidaee et al . / European Journal of Operational Research 181 ( 2007 ) 592 – 597 593 computational experience with the same problems introduced by Macambira and de Souza . 3 . 1 . Tabu search heuristic for quadratic model We solve instances of MEWCP directly in the nonlinear form of the quadratic model by applying a tabu search ( TS ) heuristic designed for the general , unconstrained binary quadratic programs ( UQP ) . This approach , as indicated below , implicitly enforces the cardinality constraint and thus can be directly applied to MEWCP . 1 An overview of our method , which proved to be very successful on stan - dard MEWCP test problems , is given below : Our TS method for UQP is centered around the use of strategic oscillation , which constitutes one of the primary strategies of tabu search . The method alternates between constructive phases that progres - sively set variables to 1 ( whose steps we call ‘‘add moves’’ ) and destructive phases that progressively set variables to 0 ( whose steps we call ‘‘drops moves’’ ) . To control the underlying search process , we use a memory structure that is updated at critical events , identiﬁed by conditions that represent locally optimal solutions that restrict the number of vari - ables currently set to 1 to satisfy the cardinality con - dition P nj ¼ 1 x j 6 b (cid:2) (cid:3) . Solutions corresponding to critical events are called critical solutions . Addi - tional moves on either side of a critical event , which degrade the critical solution and which may violate the cardinality constraint , are executed as part of the strategic oscillation employed . A parameter span is used to indicate the ampli - tude of oscillation about a critical event . We begin with span equal to 1 and gradually increase it to some limiting value . For each value of span , a series of alternating constructive and destructive phases is executed before progressing to the next value . At the limiting point , span is gradually decreased , allowing again for a series of alternating constructive and destructive phases . When span reaches a value of 1 , a complete span cycle has been completed and the next cycle is launched . The search process is typ - ically allowed to run for a pre - set number of span cycles and the best solution found during this search process is then reported . Information stored at critical events is used to inﬂuence the search process by penalizing poten - tially attractive add moves ( during a constructive phase ) and inducing drop moves ( during a destruc - tive phase ) associated with assignments of values to variables in recent critical solutions . Cumulative critical event information is used to introduce a sub - tle long term bias into the search process by means of additional penalties and inducements similar to those discussed above . Other standard elements of tabu search such as short and long term memory structures are also included . A detailed explanation of this method us given in Glover et al . ( 1998 ) and Glover et al . ( 1999 ) . This basic implementation has been employed to solve a wide variety of combinatorial problems , some appearing naturally in the form of UQP and many others re - cast into the uniﬁed framework of UQP via the use of quadratic infeasibility penalties ( see , for instance , Kochenberger et al . , 2004a , b ) . We note that other heuristic approaches have recently been reported in the literature for a restricted version of MEWCP where all edge weights are required to be positive . ( See Macambira , 2003 and Macambira and de Meneses , 1998 . ) These methods are not applicable to the general case of MEWCP considered here nor have comparisons been given by their authors with the methods consid - ered here for solving the linear version of MEWCP . For these reasons , they are not considered further in this paper . 4 . Computational experience Our basic tabu search heuristic was used to solve a set of standard test problems originally appearing the paper by Macambira and de Souza ( 2000 ) . Spe - ciﬁcally , we solved the 30 test problems having both positive and negative edge weights . The results of our algorithm ( denoted by TS / UQP ) and those of Macambira and de Souza ( M & d ) , Hunting , Faigle and Kern ( HFK ) and Sorensen are given in Table 1 . The ﬁrst two columns of the table give the prob - lem identiﬁcation and the known optimal solution for each problem . The next four columns give the computational times required for the four methods being considered . The times ( seconds ) given for M & d , HFK and Sorensen are taken directly from their respective papers . The times reported for our UQP approach were obtained by running our heu - 1 Note , however , that the cardinality constraint found in the quadratic model could be brought into the Q matrix by replacing the constraint by a quadratic infeasibility penalty , yielding an equivalent unconstrained version of the quadratic model . In turn , this unconstrained version of the quadratic model could be solved by any solution method designed for the unconstrained binary quadratic program . 594 B .

Note that all methods found optimal solutions for all problems . 2 A comparison of the computational times for the various methods must be done with all the usual caveats because the authors have used diﬀerent machines . Additional care must also be exercised because our TS / UQP approach is heuristic in nature while the ﬁrst three approaches are exact methods . Sorensen , making adjustments for the relative speed of the computers used , concludes that the time per - formance of M & d and HFK are roughly equivalent and that his method ( on a 350 MHz PC ) shows improvement over that of M & d by a factor of 10 . M & d and Sorensen did not report their proces - sor type , and thus it is impossible to make precise timing comparisons with their results . However , by using the standard SPEC benchmark ( http : / / www . specbench . org / osg / cpu20000 ) we can con - clude that the computer we used to produce our results is approximately three times faster than the computer used by HFK . Whatever reasonable adjustments that might be made regarding comparable speeds of various com - puters , it is clear from Table 1 that the computation times for our approach to these test problems is very attractive . Our TS / UQP approach easily identiﬁed the optimal solution for each of the 30 problems Table 1 Test problems with unrestricted edge weights from Macambira and de Souza ID Optimal X 0 M & d time ( seconds ) a HFK time ( seconds ) b Sorensen time ( seconds ) c TS / UQP time ( seconds ) d Grafo 40 . 1 70 , 348 12 , 481 14 , 079 223 < 1 40 . 2 45 , 404 2219 1857 68 < 1 40 . 3 34 , 091 1298 1129 64 < 1 40 . 4 27 , 758 4759 2548 84 < 1 40 . 5 27 , 967 477 2785 44 < 1 Grafo 42 . 1 81 , 633 18 , 754 14 , 841 269 < 1 42 . 2 46 , 828 5569 4159 193 < 1 42 . 3 36 , 689 1119 2130 84 < 1 42 . 4 35 , 987 66 534 58 < 1 42 . 5 35 , 460 707 1800 59 < 1 Grafo 44 . 1 90 , 620 20 , 388 27 , 445 347 < 1 44 . 2 56 , 960 4201 3329 195 < 1 44 . 3 40 , 697 1277 2142 151 < 1 44 . 4 32 , 601 14 , 388 4208 169 < 1 44 . 5 29 , 407 2633 1502 129 < 1 Grafo 45 . 1 102 , 295 16 , 111 NA 252 < 1 45 . 2 55 , 103 11 , 021 NA 353 < 1 45 . 3 43 , 914 637 NA 84 < 1 45 . 4 33 , 990 7549 NA 140 < 1 45 . 5 30 , 974 9397 NA 237 < 1 Grafo 46 . 1 99 , 550 19 , 276 10 , 348 383 < 1 46 . 2 58 , 361 5988 4579 358 < 1 46 . 3 43 , 915 7323 5418 242 < 1 46 . 4 32 , 698 20 , 632 10 , 185 344 < 1 46 . 5 31 , 000 1693 2350 144 < 1 Grafo 48 . 1 113 , 478 63 , 603 55 , 917 800 < 1 48 . 2 61 , 768 33 , 527 36 , 963 840 < 1 48 . 3 45 , 941 6625 3277 290 < 1 48 . 4 36 , 903 2781 2257 206 < 1 48 . 5 31 , 351 24 , 048 4505 307 < 1 a SUN SPARC 1000 ( Speciﬁc processor type not speciﬁed by authors ) . b HP9000 / 735 ( 125 MHz ) . c Win95 on 350 MHz PC ( Speciﬁc processor type not speciﬁed by authors ) . d Intel Pentium 4 1 . 96 GHz . 2 Hunting , Faigle and Kern did not report results for the 45 node problems . B . Alidaee et al . / European Journal of Operational Research 181 ( 2007 ) 592 – 597 595 by a search process conducted over an arbitrary limit of 50 SPAN cycles . The test problems consid - ered here , corresponding to graphs with fewer than 50 nodes , are considered to be very small by UQP standards and the 50 SPAN cycles were executed in less than 1 second for each problem . It is interesting to note that most of the time con - sumed by the LP - based methods applied to the linear model was spent on solving the initial LP relax - ations . In fact for the two branch and cut methods ( M & d and Sorensen ) , each of the 30 problems were optimally solved at the root node and no branching was required . Moreover , the Lagrangian / Cut method of HFK required very few branches to solve these problems . As noted in Section 1 , the linear model has many variables and constraints compared to the quadratic model and even for small instances like those considered here , the linear model gener - ates large LPs that are time consuming to solve . The approach by Sorensen appears to give the best performance of the three exact methods consid - ered here . It is expected , however , that this approach ( and indeed all the methods applied to the linear model ) would degrade sharply in perfor - mance due to LP ( and other ) diﬃculties for larger problem instances . In contrast to this , the quadratic model scales nicely enabling much larger instances to be eﬃciently solved . For example , we have solved instances of MEWCP for graphs with n = 2000 nodes in just a few minutes with our UQP heuristic . Problems of this size yield instances of the linear model with roughly 6 , 000 , 000 constraints , ruling out the use of this representation while posing no problem at all for the quadratic model and our heu - ristic approach . 5 . Summary and conclusions In this paper , we have focused on the attractive - ness of solving MEWCP directly in its nonlinear form rather than the more common approach of constructing and solving the equivalent but larger linear model . Modern metaheuristic methods , like critical event tabu search , enable the nonlinear ver - sion of MEWCP to be quickly solved . Even for small graphs as found in the available test bed , the computational advantage of the nonlinear model over the linear model is apparent . For instances of MEWCP deﬁned on larger graphs , the attractive - ness of the nonlinear model is even more pro - nounced . In fact , the linear representation of MEWCP may simply be unsolvable for even modest sized graphs ( few hundred nodes ) while the nonlin - ear model , approached by metaheuristic methods , can readily be applied to problems with several thousand nodes . Adopting the nonlinear representation enables the state of the art in solving MEWCP to leap from problems with less than 100 nodes ( according to the current literature ) to those with several thousand nodes . As noted in recent papers ( see for instance ( Alidaee et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Kochenberger et al . , 2005a , 2004a , b , 2005b ) , the model UQP has proven to function eﬃciently and eﬀectively as a uniﬁed framework for modeling and solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems . In the con - text of other problem classes , we have solved instances of UQP with more than 50 , 000 variables , which means we could conceivably solve the nonlin - ear version of MEWCP for graphs with more than 50 , 000 nodes . As part of our future work , we plan to report on larger instances of MEWCP as well as a more detailed comparison with other heuristic methods . Our main objective here was to present the UQP approach for modeling and solving MEWCP and to illustrate its attractiveness by solv - ing publicly available test problems .
