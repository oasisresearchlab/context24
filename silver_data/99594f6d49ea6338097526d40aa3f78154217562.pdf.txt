Unbiased quantitative proteomics of lipid rafts reveals high specificity for signaling factors Leonard J . Foster , Carmen L . de Hoog , and Matthias Mann * Center for Experimental BioInformatics , Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Southern Denmark , Campusvej 55 , DK - 5230 Odense M , Denmark Communicated by Kai Simons , Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden , Germany , March 20 , 2003 ( received for review January 15 , 2003 ) Membrane lipids were once thought to be homogenously distrib - uted in the 2D surface of a membrane , but the lipid raft theory suggests that cholesterol and sphingolipids partition away from other membrane lipids . Lipid raft theory further implicates these cholesterol - rich domains in many processes such as signaling and vesicle trafﬁc . However , direct characterization of rafts has been difﬁcult , because they cannot be isolated in pure form . In the ﬁrst functional proteomic analysis of rafts , we use quantitative high - resolution MS to speciﬁcally detect proteins depleted from rafts by cholesterol - disrupting drugs , resulting in a set of 241 authentic lipid raft components . We detect a large proportion of signaling molecules , highly enriched versus total membranes and detergent - resistant fractions , which thus far biochemically deﬁned rafts . Our results provide the ﬁrst large - scale and unbiased evidence , to our knowledge , for the connection of rafts with signaling and place limits on the fraction of plasma membrane composed by rafts . M embrane lipid rafts ( 1 – 3 ) , despite years of study , remain elusive and controversial entities . Many biophysical , bio - chemical , and microscopy studies suggest that lipid rafts are real and not artifacts of detergent extractions ( 4 – 7 ) . The general lipid composition of rafts is understood to such a degree that rafts can be regenerated in synthetic vesicles containing only lipids ( 8 ) , but the protein composition of rafts remains contentious . Lipid rafts are functionally defined by their dependence on cholesterol , but this definition cannot be translated to a generally agreed on purification scheme . Two common methods have been used to isolate rafts , resistance to either high pH or nonionic detergents , and in both methods rafts are separated from other proteins by density gradient centrifugation . Detergent resistance is the much more widely used of the two but , as with any biochemical fractionation , both methods are plagued by issues of contami - nation from nonraft proteins . Here we overcome this problem by applying a recently described method in quantitative proteomics [ stable isotope - labeling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) ( 9 ) ] to directly determine the subset of cholesterol - dependent proteins in the biochemical preparation . Methods SILAC . Two populations of HeLa cells were grown in leucine - deficient DMEM (cid:1) 10 % dialyzed FBS . One population was sup - plemented with normal isotopic abundance L - leucine ( Leu , 105 mg (cid:1) liter , Sigma ) and the other with 99 % isotopic abundance L - leucine - 3 , 3 , 3 - D3 ( LeuD3 , 107 . 4 mg (cid:1) liter , Aldrich ) , as de - scribed ( 9 ) . Each population was grown for at least three passages encompassing a minimum of seven population dou - blings . Four 14 - cm plates each of Leu and LeuD3 cells were serum - starved for 18 h before treatment with cholesterol - disrupting agents and preparation of detergent - and pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fractions . Detergent - and pH (cid:1) Carbonate - Resistant Fractions . After serum starvation , one population of cells was treated with a choles - terol - disrupting drug [ nystatin , 60 min at 50 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml ; filipin , 30 min at 25 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml ; or methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ( M (cid:2) CD ) , 60 min at 5 mM , all at 37°C ] , and the other was treated with an appropriate carrier control . In most cases , the Leu population of cells received the drug to more easily differentiate contam - inating proteins from authentic proteins being altered by the treatment ( see Results and Discussion ) . When reverse labeling was performed in some experiments , similar results were observed . A low - density detergent - resistant fraction was pre - pared as described ( 10 ) . Basically Leu - and LeuD3 - encoded cells were lysed for 1 h at 4°C in 1 % Triton X - 100 ( in 25 mM Mes , pH 6 . 5 ) , clarified , and the protein content of each lysate measured by Coomassie ( Pierce ) . Equal amounts of protein from the Leu ( treated ) and LeuD3 ( untreated ) lysates were combined and mixed with an equal volume of 90 % sucrose in Mes - buffered saline ( MBS ) ( 150 mM NaCl (cid:1) 25 mM Mes , pH 6 . 5 ) for a final sucrose concentration of 45 % . This solution was then placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube as the base of a discontinuous sucrose gradient . Additional layers consist - ing of 35 % and 5 % sucrose in MBS were gently placed on top , and the whole gradient was centrifuged at 166 , 000 (cid:1) g for 18 h at 4°C . The resulting low - density light - scattering band ( (cid:2) 18 % sucrose ) was extracted , diluted 4 (cid:1) in MBS , and centrifuged an additional 2 h ( 166 , 000 (cid:1) g , 4°C ) to pellet the detergent - resistant material . The pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fraction was prepared in a similar way , with the exception that the cells were lysed in 100 mM Na 2 CO 3 , pH 11 . 0 , and mechanically disrupted by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and three 20 - s bursts of a probe sonicator , as described ( 11 ) .

In most experiments , the pellet from the second centrifugation was solubilized in a small volume of 6 M urea (cid:1) 2 M thiourea ( in 10 mM Hepes , pH 8 . 0 ) , from which the proteins were precipitated by diluting 5 (cid:1) with absolute ethanol and adjusted to 50 mM NaCH 3 COO with a 2 . 5 M stock solution , pH 5 . 0 . After the solution was allowed to stand for 2 h , the precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 12 , 000 (cid:1) g at room temperature ( r . t . ) . The pellet from this step was then resolubilized in urea (cid:1) thiourea , reduced ( 1 (cid:1) g of DTT per 50 - (cid:1) g estimated sample protein for 30 min at r . t . ) ( 12 ) , alkylated ( 5 (cid:1) g of iodoacetamide per 50 - (cid:1) g sample protein for 30 min at r . t . ) , digested with LysC ( 1 (cid:1) g (cid:1) 50 (cid:1) g sample protein for 3 h at r . t . ) , diluted 4 (cid:1) with 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , and digested with trypsin ( 1 (cid:1) g (cid:1) 50 (cid:1) g sample protein for 12 h at r . t . ) . For M (cid:2) CD - treated detergent - resistant fractions , samples were prepared as above or by first partially resolving the proteins by SDS (cid:1) PAGE and then in - gel digesting ( 12 ) the entire lane after cutting it into six fractions . Peptide mixtures were then desalted by using stop and go extraction ( STAGE ) tips ( 13 ) and bomb - loaded onto Abbreviations : SILAC , stableisotopelabelingwithaminoacidsincellculture ; M (cid:2) CD , methyl (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ; LeuD3 , L - leucine - 5 , 5 , 5 - d3 ; LC (cid:1) MS , high - performance liquid chromatogra - phy (cid:1) MS ; MS (cid:1) MS , tandem MS ; r . t . , room temperature . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Peptides were eluted from the analytical columns by three - step linear 2 . 5 - h gradients running from 5 . 6 % to 64 % acetonitrile and sprayed directly into the orifice of a QSTAR - Pulsar quadrupole time - of - flight ( TOF ) hybrid MS ( PE - Sciex , Thornhill , Ontario , Can - ada ) ( 14 ) . Proteins were identified by LC (cid:1) MS (cid:1) MS ( 15 ) by information - dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra for multiply charged peptides that were then searched against the Human International Protein Index database ( ftp : (cid:1)(cid:1) ftp . ebi . ac . uk (cid:1) pub (cid:1) databases (cid:1) IPI (cid:1) old (cid:1) HUMAN ) by using MASCOT ( Matrix Science , London ) . The following search parameters were used in all MASCOT searches : maximum of one missed trypsin cleavage , cysteine carbamidomethylation , methionine oxidation , leucine with three extra deuterium atoms , and a maximum 0 . 2 - Da error tolerance in both the MS and MS (cid:1) MS data . Protein hits with one ions score (cid:3) 45 or two (cid:3) 30 were considered identified with no manual inspection . All other hits were manually verified by using accepted rules for peptide frag - mentation in a quadrupole – TOF hybrid MS . Possible redundancy arising from combining datasets was minimized by BLAST ing ( ftp : (cid:1)(cid:1) ftp . ncbi . nih . gov (cid:1) blast (cid:1) executables ) , a FASTA library of all of the amino acid sequences against itself . Any two sequences with 100 % overlap of one sequence with the other were considered redundant . MASCOT outputs were parsed to obtain peptide - pair lists , and extracted ion chromatograms ( XICs ) were generated from survey scan data by using SPINX ( SILAC Peptide INte - gration by XIC ) , an in - house script . Where one peptide in a pair had not been selected for sequencing , its mass was calculated , and its elution time window was predicted . Measurement of Cholesterol Content . Serum - starved HeLa cells were treated with M (cid:2) CD , nystatin , or filipin as described , washed three times with PBS , and scraped into PBS . Total cellular lipid content was extracted from 10 - (cid:1) g ( total protein , determined by the Coomassie method ) aliquots of each treat - ment as described ( 16 ) , scaling all volumes down by 10 3 . Cho - lesterol content of each sample was measured by using the Fig . 1 . Isolation scheme . Leu - labeled HeLa cells ( depicted by red proteins (cid:1) peptides ) were treated with a cholesterol - disrupting agent , lysed , combined with lysates of LeuD3 - labeled untreated HeLa cells ( depicted by blue proteins (cid:1) peptides ) , and used to prepare a detergent - resistant fraction . Because rafts in the drug - treated cells have lost their structural integrity they no longer are puriﬁed in the detergent - resistant fraction , whereas nonraft contaminants originating from treated and untreated samples will copurify . Tryptic peptides were then prepared from isolated detergent - or pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fractions , as described in Methods . 5814 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0631608100 Foster et al .

Serum - starved HeLa cells were scraped into homogenization buffer [ 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 (cid:1) 255 mM sucrose (cid:1) 1 mM EDTA with Complete Protease Inhibitors ( Roche Diagnostics ) ] and homogenized by 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer ( 17 ) . Nuclei , mitochondria , and large cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 10 , 000 (cid:1) g for 10 min . The postnuclear supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 h at 245 , 000 (cid:1) g to pellet remaining membranes . These proteins were then prepared for LC (cid:1) MS (cid:1) MS as described . Results and Discussion We encode all of the proteins in one of two cell populations by metabolically labeling with deuterium - substituted leucine ( 9 ) . One of these populations is treated with a cholesterol - disrupting drug to break up lipid rafts in those cells . The treated and untreated cells are then combined and fraction - ated biochemically . No rafts originating from the treated cells will be isolated , because the drug treatment will have signif - icantly disrupted their structural integrity ( Fig . 1 ) . The prior isotope - encoding will then reveal specific quantitative changes of only the cholesterol - dependent proteins in the resistant fraction ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . We used two raft isolation schemes ( detergent and pH (cid:1) carbonate resistance ) and three cholesterol - disrupting drugs ( nystatin , filipin , and M (cid:2) CD ) to generate six treated (cid:1) untreated pairs for quantitative proteomic analysis . Equal amounts of lysate protein from the treated ( normal leucine , Leu ) and untreated ( triply deuterated leucine , LeuD3 ) cells were com - bined and used to prepare a single detergent - resistant fraction . Combining the lysates before isolation of the resistant fractions eliminates any potential variability from differences in individual Fig . 3 . Control (cid:1) drug - treated ratios .

Ion chromatograms ( intensity vs . time ) of Leu - and LeuD3 - containing peptides identiﬁed by MS (cid:1) MS were extracted from the series of MS scans and integrated by using SPINX ( see Methods ) .

Subsequent quantitative analysis by MS revealed cholesterol - depleted proteins through the lower peak heights of Leu versus LeuD3 peptides ( Fig . 2 ) . The complete list of identified proteins , including measured ratios and accession numbers , is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , www . pnas . org . In pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant rafts , all three drugs worked as expected , decreasing the levels of a large group of proteins in the preparation , including several known raft proteins . However , although changes were seen with each drug , the magnitude of the effects was unremarkable , typically reaching no more than 2 . 5 - fold . Furthermore , when plotted in order of decreasing ratio , no distinct group of values was discernible that might represent raft - specific proteins ( Fig . 3 ) . Even though the drug effects in this preparation were largely specific for known or plausible raft proteins ( i . e . , higher depletion ratios seen for integral - membrane proteins , hydrophobically modified proteins , etc . ) , the size of the effects made it difficult to determine a threshold over which proteins could confidently be considered as true raft components . The pH (cid:1) carbonate preparation also contained a higher than expected number of proteins from cellular locations such as the mitochondria that , while membranous , are unlikely to contain rafts ( 1 ) . Nystatin and filipin were even less efficient at depleting proteins in detergent - resistant fractions , resulting in only very small differences between untreated - and drug - treated samples ( Fig . 3 ) . We attribute this weak effect to the propensity of these drugs to sequester cholesterol but not fully remove it from the membrane , an action that may not be disruptive enough to deplete raft proteins from the detergent - resistant fraction . In contrast to nystatin and filipin , the cholesterol - chelating drug M (cid:2) CD had a striking effect on a specific subset of proteins in the detergent - resistant raft preparation . In fact , many proteins were so effectively excluded by M (cid:2) CD from the biochemically isolated rafts that often Leu - containing pep - tides from those proteins were undetectable , whereas the corresponding LeuD3 - labeled peptide was easily detected ( assigned ratios’ (cid:3) 10 (cid:4) ) . Sharp drops in the solid curve in Fig . 3 ( indicated by arrows ) suggest that the proteins can be classified into three distinct categories : those with a ratio (cid:3) 7 . 5 , between 7 . 5 and 3 , and those (cid:5) 3 . There were 145 proteins with ratios (cid:5) 3 , most of which were cytoplasmic proteins , nuclear factors , or mitochondrial enzymes ( Table 1 , bottom ) . The ratios for these proteins indicate they are not drastically affected by cholesterol depletion , and so the presence of most of them in the detergent - resistant fraction is a result of their high cellular expression levels , making them inherently difficult to completely separate from the proteins of interest ( Fig . 1 ) . Contaminating proteins , mostly epidermal keratins and serum proteins , were detected only in their unla - beled form and therefore have ratios close to zero . M (cid:2) CD was much more effective at disrupting cholesterol than either nystatin or filipin , because treatment with it depletes the cells of virtually all cholesterol relative to un - treated cells ( Table 2 ) . The heavy dependence of raft integrity on cholesterol ( 2 , 3 , 18 ) means that such efficient removal of cholesterol from cells should profoundly alter raft structure and lead to very large ratios in the SILAC assay ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Therefore , the two groups with high ratios in Fig . 3 ( 241 proteins in total ) should represent authentic raft components . If this is true , known raft markers should fall into either of these categories , which is indeed what we observed . Remark - ably , every generally accepted raft protein expected to be expressed in epithelium - derived HeLa cells ( 2 , 3 ) and identi - fied in this study had ratios placing them in either the medium or high ratio groups ( Table 1 ) . In addition to being separable by ratio , these proteins also group similarly based on their known relationships with mem - branes . The group with the highest ratios consists mostly of Table 1 .

The group with medium ratios consists mostly of proteins that are not themselves embedded in the membrane but that are known or thought to bind to such proteins ( Table 1 ) . We have termed these groups ‘‘raft proteins’’ and ‘‘raft - associated proteins , ’’ respectively . That these proteins can be grouped similarly based on two properties , their suscep - tibility to M (cid:2) CD treatment and their association with mem - branes , is additional strong evidence that the groupings are real and not a statistical artifact . One oddity in this classification is the raft marker caveolin . The measured ratio for caveolin places it in the ‘‘raft - associated’’ category when it would be expected to be in the ‘‘raft’’ category , suggesting that there may be unknown structural properties of caveolin that affect its interactions with cholesterol and thus its susceptibility to disruption by M (cid:2) CD . The importance of using a functional property ( such as response to cholesterol disruption ) to increase the specificity of proteomic characterization of biochemical fractions is ap - parent from examination of our own data and comparison with those of others . In the M (cid:2) CD experiment described above , 352 noncontaminant proteins were quantified from detergent - resistant fractions , but almost one - third of these turned out to be nonspecific copurifying proteins . Conversely , a small number of proteins that would otherwise be expected to be nonspecific appear in the raft and raft - associated protein groups . Although we cannot be certain , the appearance of intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin and keratins proteins may be a result of secondary interactions with true raft proteins . When raft proteins are depleted by M (cid:2) CD , the proteins bound to them are also depleted ( 20 ) . We have no explanation for the presence of nucleolin and certain ribo - somal proteins . There are few proteomics studies of raft proteins , and none of them is quantitative . Bini et al . ( 21 ) reported the identifi - cation of 19 proteins in a detergent - resistant fraction from Jurkat T cells , but less than half of these fall into the raft classifications described here ( Fig . 3 and supporting informa - tion on the PNAS web site ) . von Haller et al . ( 22 ) identified (cid:2) 70 proteins in a detergent - resistant fraction also from Jurkat T cells Of these , only two - thirds are found to be authentic raft proteins ( Fig . 3 and supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and our data suggest that the remaining one - third are false positives . Without the functional specificity of cholesterol depletion , as used in the experiment reported here , these proportions are exactly what would be expected from bio - chemical purification alone . In addition , our data also indicate that the pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant preparation is less specific in isolating raft proteins and more difficult to interpret than the detergent - resistant method . In total , 703 proteins were identified in detergent - resistant fractions and 585 in pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fractions . Of the 703 detergent - resistant proteins , 392 were quantifiable and revealed 241 authentic raft proteins . Identification of a set of true raft proteins directly illuminates questions of interest in the raft and signaling fields . Lipid rafts are often linked to signal transduction pathways , in particular as coordinators of the initial events in the cascades ( 3 ) . Most of the signaling pathways studied in the context of rafts are tyrosine kinase cascades , and the data presented here provide unbiased support for this association ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , among the raft and raft - associated proteins identified here are a significant number of serine (cid:1) threonine kinases (cid:1) phosphatases as well as numerous heterotri - meric G protein subunits ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that rafts may be more general signaling coordinators . Certain signaling mole - cules were previously known to be enriched in rafts , but this is the first demonstration , to our knowledge , of such an enrichment on a large scale . Original models suggested rafts are relatively rare in mem - branes [ ‘‘rafts in an ocean’’ ( 23 , 24 ) ] , but based on molar lipid abundances some estimates now predict rafts may constitute up to 30 % or more of plasma membrane area in certain cells ( 25 ) . If rafts did cover one - third of the cell surface , their purification versus the whole membrane could result in only a 3 - fold enrichment as an upper limit . To directly address the question of raft abundance , we analyzed a postnuclear (cid:1) postmitochondria total membrane fraction by LC (cid:1) MS , iden - tifying 162 of the most abundant proteins . We then used these and the other data discussed above to compare the number of protein kinases (cid:1) phosphatases , small GTP - binding proteins ( excluding those involved in membrane transport ) , and het - erotrimeric G proteins in each fraction . Fig . 4 shows the proportion of these three classes of signaling molecules in total membrane fractions , detergent - resistant fractions , and the set of cholesterol - dependent raft proteins identified here . The Fig . 4 . Enrichment of signaling molecules . Protein kinases (cid:1) phosphatases , heterotrimeric G protein subunits (cid:1) effectors , small molecular weight G proteins (cid:1) exchange factors , and unknown proteins identiﬁed as raft proteins as a fraction of the total proteins in total membranes , detergent - resistant membranes , and raft proteins . Foster et al . PNAS (cid:2) May 13 , 2003 (cid:2) vol . 100 (cid:2) no . 10 (cid:2) 5817 C E LL B I O L O G Y proportion increases to much more than 10 - fold from total membranes to cholesterol - dependent raft proteins . Fig . 4 also indicates there is a large percentage of unknown proteins in rafts that are also enriched , suggesting that the proportion of signaling molecules may be even higher , and that many inter - esting raft proteins remain to be characterized . Even allowing for a small diluting effect by ER membranes in the total membrane fraction , the (cid:3) 10 - fold enrichment of many signal - ing protein families in rafts versus total membranes means that the percentage of the membrane occupied by rafts has to be much lower than 10 % . However , this does not imply that rafts are of a uniform or static size and composition . On the basis of previous biochemical isolations , rafts are also proposed to reside in membrane compartments other than the plasma membrane ( 10 , 26 ) . Clearly , both raft lipids and raft proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (cid:1) Golgi before transport to the plasma membrane and , indeed , many protein synthesis proteins and vesicle trafficking proteins are among the proteins identified here . However , this does not demonstrate that rafts per se exist in those compartments , only that those proteins are in a detergent - resistant , cholesterol - dependent state while residing there . Mitochondria too have been proposed to contain rafts ( 21 ) , but the data presented here strongly argue against this possibility . On the other hand , we do find that most of the subunits of the lysosomal proton pump as well as other degradative pathway components are sensitive to M (cid:2) CD , supporting previous studies that found raft markers in these organelles ( 27 ) . The data further dem - onstrate the considerable differences between detergent - and pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fractions . Typically , at least one - third of the proteins in detergent - resistant fractions are nonraft proteins ( see above and refs . 21 and 22 ) , but pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fractions likely contain at least 75 % nonraft proteins . Due to the very high levels of proteins unreceptive to choles - terol disruption in the pH (cid:1) carbonate - resistant fraction , we conclude that this preparation is a poor model for studying lipid rafts . Clearly , biochemical fractionation alone is not sufficiently specific to unequivocally assign localizations , but use of stable isotope encoding to add a functional dimension greatly increases specificity . By requiring simultaneous matching of the two most widely accepted criteria for raft proteins , the study presented here provides , to our knowledge , the first large - scale character - ization of raft protein components .
