Solvents were purchased from Biosolve ( Valkenswaard , The Netherlands ) . All the other solvents were dried over molecular sieves 4 Å or 3 Å . TLC was performed on Merck precoated Silica 60 plates . Spots were visualized by UV light and 10 % H 2 SO 4 in MeOH . Microwave reactions were carried out in a Biotage microwave Initiator ( Uppsala , Sweden ) . The microwave power was limited by temperature control once the desired temperature was reached . Sealed vessels of 2 - 5 mL and 10 - 20 mL were used . 1H NMR , HSQC , COSY ( 400 MHz , 500 MHz ) and 13C ( 100 MHz , 162 MHz ) were performed on a Varian G - 300 spectrometer . Electrospray Mass experiments were performed in a Shimadzu LCMS QP - 8000 . High resolution mass spectrometry ( HRMS ) analysis was performed using an ESI - QTOF II spectrometer ( Bruker , Billerica , USA ) and Applied Biosystems 4700 MALDI TOF / TOF instrument . Infrared ( IR ) spectroscopy was performed using Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance ( UATR ) accessory of Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two FT - IR . Polyacrylamide ( 749222 Aldrich , Avg Mn : : 150000 ) and Dextran ( D - 4876 Sigma , Avg Mn : : 150000 ) was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . CTB5 inhibition assay ( GM1 ELISA ) A 96 - well plat e was coated with a solution of GM1 ( 100 μL , 2 μg / mL ) in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) overnight . Unattached ganglioside was removed by washing with PBS and the remaining binding sites of the surface were blocked with BSA ( 1 % ) which was followed by washing with PBS . Samples of toxin - peroxidase conjugate ( CTB5 - HRP ; Sigma , 40ng / ml ) and inhibitor in PBS with BSA ( 0 . 1 % ) and Tween - 20 ( 0 . 05 % ) were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and were then transferred to the GM1 - coated plate . After 30 min of incubation the solution was removed and the wells were washed with BSA ( 0 . 1 % ) / Tween - 20 ( 0 . 05 % ) in PBS . To identify toxin binding to surface - bound GM1 , the wells were treated with a freshly prepared solution of o - phenylenediamine / H 2 O 2 in citrate buffer ( 100 μL ) for 15 min . After being quenched with H 2 SO 4 , the absorbance in each well was measured at 490 nm . Inhibition data from at least two independent experiments were averaged and fitted in GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 3 Inhibition Graphs Galactose - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 - 50 0 50 100 150 log concentration [ M ] % B i nd i ng log ( inhibitor ) vs . response - - Variable slope ( met IC50 errors ) Best - fit values BOTTOM TOP LOGIC50 HILLSLOPE IC50 Span Std .

Generating and Culturing Organoids The generation and biobanking of the intestinal organoids differed slightly from previously described protocols 12 . After washing rectal biopsies with PBS , crypts were isolated by 60 - 90 min incubation in 10 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) solution at 4°C on a rocking platform . Crypts were collected , centrifuged at 130 g for 5 min at 4 ºC , and supernatant was removed . The pellet containing the crypts was resuspended in 50 % matrigel ( Corning , diluted in complete culture medium , see below ) , and matrigel droplets harbouring crypts were plated in pre - warmed 24 - well plates . After polymerization of the matrigel ( ±15 min at 37°C / 5 % CO 2 ) , droplets were immersed in complete culture medium ( advanced DMEM / F12 supplemented with HEPES , GlutaMAX , penicillin and streptomycin , B - 27 ( 2 % ) , mEGF ( 50 ng / ml , Life Technologies ) , N - acetylcysteine ( 1 , 25 mM ) , nicotinamide ( 10 mM ) , SB202190 ( 10 μM , Sigma ) , A83 - 01 ( 500 nM , Tocris ) , , prymocin ( 100 μg / ml , Invivogen ) , and 50 % Wnt3a - , 20 % Rspo - 1 - , and 10 % Noggin - conditioned media ) . In 5 - 9 days , crypts grew out into fully grown organoids , which were subsequently passaged 1 : 4 via mechanical disruption of the organoids . Culture medium was refreshed every 2−3 days , and organoids were passaged at least two times before assays were performed . Organoid Swelling Assay CFTR function measurements in intestinal organoids was performed slightly different when compared to previously described procedures . 123 Organoid cultures of 6 - 8 days old were mechanically disrupted , seeded into flat - bottom 96 - well plates in 50 % matrigel and incubated overnight at 37°C / 5 % CO 2 . The next day , cholera toxin ( 3 μg / mL ) was incubated together with cholera toxin inhibitors ( titration range ) for 4 h at room temperature , followed by staining of the organoids with 3 μM calcein AM ( Invitrogen ) for 15 - 30 min prior to organoid stimulation . Swelling of organoids was monitored over time using the Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope ( images were taken every 15 min during cholera / inhibitor stimulation and every 10 min during forskolin stimulation ) while the organoids were kept at 37°C / 5 % CO 2 . Organoid area increase ( 2D ) was analyzed using 12 Zen Blue 2 . 0 analysis software , and area under the curve ( AUC ) calculations ( of the total area increase measured in 4h ) were conducted with GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 . Cholera Toxin and Inhibitors Cholera toxin from Vibrio cholerae ( Sigma C8052 ) was used to stimulate organoid fluid secretion . Cholera toxin inhibitors were preincubated for 4 h with cholera toxin prior to organoid stimulation . The multivalent structures of the inhibitors are based on polyacrylamide , dextran and hPG . The monovalent inhibitors are MNPG - based and free galactose serves as a reference compound . 13 Inhibition Graphs Galactose - 2 - 1 0 - 50 0 50 100 150 log concentration [ M ] O r g a no i d s w e lli ng no r m a li se d log ( inhibitor ) vs . response - - Variable slope ( met IC50 errors ) Best - fit values BOTTOM TOP LOGIC50 HILLSLOPE IC50 Span Std .
