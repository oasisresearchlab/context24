Müller 4 , Miri K . Van Hoven 2 & Bo Huang 6 , 7 , 8 Self - associating split ﬂ uorescent proteins ( FPs ) are split FPs whose two fragments sponta - neously associate to form a functional FP . They have been widely used for labeling proteins , scaffolding protein assembly and detecting cell - cell contacts . Recently developments have expanded the palette of self - associating split FPs beyond the original split GFP 1 - 10 / 11 . How - ever , these new ones have suffered from suboptimal ﬂ uorescence signal after com - plementation . Here , by investigating the complementation process , we have demonstrated two approaches to improve split FPs : assistance through SpyTag / SpyCatcher interaction and directed evolution . The latter has yielded two split sfCherry3 variants with substantially enhanced overall brightness , facilitating the tagging of endogenous proteins by gene editing . Based on sfCherry3 , we have further developed a new red - colored trans - synaptic marker called Neuroligin - 1 sfCherry3 Linker Across Synaptic Partners ( NLG - 1 CLASP ) for multiplexed visualization of neuronal synapses in living C . elegans , demonstrating its broad applications . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 019 - 0589 - x OPEN 1 The UC Berkeley - UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 2 Department of Biological Sciences , San Jose State University , San Jose , CA 95192 , USA . 3 Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences , University of California in San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 4 School of Physics and Astronomy , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN 55455 , USA . 5 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China . 6 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry , University of California in San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 7 Department Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 8 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub , San Francisco , CA 94158 , USA .

In this system , the eleventh β - strand of FP ( FP 11 , 16 amino acids ) is separated out from the remainder of FP ( FP 1 – 10 ) and is genetically fused to the protein of interest ( POI ) . Speci ﬁ c ﬂ uor - escence signal is detected when FP 1 – 10 reconstitutes with the on - target FP 11 to generate a functional ﬂ uorescent protein . Since the initial development of self - associating split GFP 1 – 10 / 11 1 , this technology has been modi ﬁ ed and adapted for an extensive range of applications including protein labeling and visualization 2 – 4 , scaffolding protein assembly 3 , protein solubility and aggregation assays 5 , 6 , and monitoring the membrane fusion process 7 . One prominent application is generating a library of human cells with ﬂ uorescently tagged endogenous proteins via CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated homology - directed repair 4 . The small size of the GFP 11 tag markedly improves the knock - in ef ﬁ ciency and simpli ﬁ es the donor DNA preparation . In another application , the split GFP 1 – 10 / 11 system has also been utilized to visualize synapses in living nervous systems by Neuroligin - 1 GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners ( NLG - 1 GRASP ) 8 . While all these applications have focused on a single , green - colored channel , expanding the color palette will greatly bene ﬁ t the investigation of more complex biological systems by enabling multicolor imaging . For this purpose , we have recently developed a red - colored split sfCherry 1 – 10 / 11 3 and then a brighter split sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 9 , enabling dual - color endogenous labeling in human cells using orthogonal FP 11 tags 9 and visualization of Listeria protein secretion in infection 10 . However , unlike split GFP 1 – 10 / 11 , which is as bright as its full - length , split sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 produces substantially lower overall ﬂ uorescence signal than its full - length counterpart . Here , we have characterized the complementation mechanism of split FP systems by examining their overall and single - molecule ﬂ uorescence brightness . The results suggest a two - step com - plementation model in which the af ﬁ nity between the FP 1 – 10 and FP 11 fragment is the major limitation to the overall ﬂ uorescence signal . Based on this model , we have devised a SpyTag / Spy - Catcher - assisted approach to improve the complementation ef ﬁ - ciency of sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 . Furthermore , we have engineered two split sfCherry3 variants with much - enhanced complementation ef ﬁ ciency through a combination of cycles of directed evolution and structure - based site - directed mutagenesis . For tagging endo - genous proteins by gene editing , sfCherry3 improves the sorting ef ﬁ ciency for successfully knocked - in cells by 5 – 10 - fold in six tested targets , as compared to sfCherry2 . Moreover , we have also developed a new red - colored trans - synaptic marker called Neuroligin - 1 sfCherry3 Linker Across Synaptic Partners ( NLG - 1 CLASP ) . We established that like NLG - 1 GRASP , NLG - 1 CLASP labels connections between correct synaptic partners and has a spatial pattern similar to that predicted by electron micrograph reconstruction 11 , 12 . As a validation , NLG - 1 CLASP labeling is disrupted by loss of the clr - 1 gene , which is required for synaptic partner recognition 13 . To demonstrate the utility of this new biomarker , we utilize it in combination with the NLG - 1 GRASP marker to differentially label subsets of synapses made between the same interneurons and different neuronal partners . We also demonstrate that in this system the ﬂ uorescence of both bio - markers are severely reduced in clr - 1 mutants , as clr - 1 is required for both sets of synapses 13 . These experiments indicate that background ﬂ uorescence is minimal , and that these markers cor - rectly visualize synaptic connections . Results The complementation process of SAsFPs . Previously , we have shown that split GFP 1 – 10 / 11 has nearly identical overall brightness as its full - length counterpart , whereas both split mNeonGreen2 1 – 10 / 11 ( mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 ) and split sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 are substantially dimmer 9 . This suboptimal performance of mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 and sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 could be attributed to either ( a ) the lower molecular brightness of complemented split FPs or ( b ) incomplete complementation between the FP 1 – 10 and FP 11 fragments . To test ( a ) , we measured the single - molecule brightness of these three split FPs and their full - length counterparts in living cells using ﬂ uorescence ﬂ uctuation spectroscopy 14 . We observed no signi ﬁ cant difference in single - molecule brightness between the split and the full - length FPs in all three cases ( Fig . 1a ) . Therefore , incomplete complementation should be the cause of the reduced overall ﬂ uorescence signal . The ratio of overall ﬂ uorescence between split and full - length FPs then re ﬂ ects the complementation ef ﬁ ciency . For mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 and sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 , to determine their complementation ef ﬁ ciency and compare them to GFP 1 – 10 / 11 , we took a similar approach as previously done 9 . We transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells the full - length FP or the two fragments : FP 1 – 10 and FP 11 on a well - folded carrier protein . We quanti ﬁ ed whole - cell ﬂ uorescence by ﬂ ow cytometry while using a co - expressed infrared ﬂ uorescent protein mIFP to measure the expression level . mIFP was linked to the full - length FP or the FP 11 fragment through a P2A self - cleavage site to ensure equimolar expression . Fluorescence intensities in infrared and green / red channels of each single cell events were displayed in log – log - scale scatter plots ( Fig . 1b – d ) . In the cases of full - length FPs , as expected , single cell ﬂ uorescence intensities followed the trend line with a slope of 1 because mIFP was expressed equimolarly ( Fig . 1e ) . In the split cases , split GFP 1 – 10 / 11 almost completely followed the same diagonal line as its full - length counterpart ( except for a subtle deviation at the lower - expression end ) ( Fig . 1b ) , suggesting a complementation ef ﬁ ciency of almost 100 % across a wide range of expression levels . In contrast , both split mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 and split sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 deviated from the trend lines of their full - length counterparts ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Considering that the complementation process is ultimately irreversible , as we have shown by both ﬂ uorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and photo - activation measurements ( Supplementary Figs . 1 and 2 ) , this observation prompted us to consider a two - step complementation process for self - associating split FPs : the two fragments undergo a reversible association / dissociation equilibrium before entering an irreversible process of folding and / or chromophore maturation : FP 1 (cid:1) 10 þ FP 11 " FP (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) 10 = 11 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) ! folding = maturation FP 1 (cid:1) 10 = 11 ! degradation : We have veri ﬁ ed that in our co - transfection scheme , the expression levels ( concentrations ) of FP 1 – 10 and FP 11 fragments are proportional through an independent experiment in cells co - expressing mIFP - P2A - sfCherry2 11 - Carrier and TagBFP - P2A - sfCherry2 1 – 10 ( Fig . 1e ) . Then , at a steady state , this two - step model predicts the following relationship between the two channels of ﬂ ow cytometry ( see Supplementary Notes ) : mIFP ½ (cid:4) / ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ K ′ D ½ FP 1 (cid:1) 10 = 11 (cid:4) q þ ½ FP 1 (cid:1) 10 = 11 (cid:4) ; where mIFP ½ (cid:4) represents the sum of concentrations of uncom - plemented and complemented FP 11 , ½ FP 1 (cid:1) 10 = 11 (cid:4) is the concentra - tion of matured FP 1 – 10 / 11 , and K ′ D is the effective dissociation constant of the overall complementation / maturation process . When K ′ D is much lower than the expression level of FP 11 ( the case of GFP 1 – 10 / 11 ) , the second term dominates , leading to a near proportional relationship between the two ﬂ ow cytometry channels ( slope of 1 in log – log plot , Fig . 1b ) . In the opposite case of high K ′ D ( the cases of mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 and sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 ) , the ﬁ rst term dominates , resulting in log – log scatter plots ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 019 - 0589 - x 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2019 ) 2 : 344 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 019 - 0589 - x | www . nature . com / commsbio following more closely to slope - 2 trend lines , matching our observations ( Fig . 1c , d ) . SpyTag / SpyCatcher - assisted complementation of split sfCherry2 . Our model indicates that the complementation ef ﬁ - ciency of split mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 and sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 improves with raised local concentration of fragments , leading to enhanced overall ﬂ uorescence signal . Therefore , we sought to utilize a pair of high - af ﬁ nity binding partners to bring the two fragments into spatial proximity . Because a major advantage of the split FP 1 – 10 / 11 is to label endogenous proteins through knocking - in the short FP 11 peptide , it is preferable to have a small binding partner for the FP 11 fragment . For this purpose , we chose the SpyTag / Spy - Catcher 15 system , a peptide – protein pair that undergoes irre - versible binding through formation of an isopeptide bond . The 13 - amino - acid ( aa ) SpyTag is suf ﬁ ciently short that even when concatenated with GFP 11 , the resulting sequence remains small enough for knock - in using synthetic oligo donor DNAs 16 . We examined SpyTag / SpyCatcher - assisted complementation on sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 using the recently improved Spy002 pair 17 ( Fig . 2a ) . We fused SpyCatcher to the N - terminus of sfCherry2 1 – 10 ( the C - terminus is the split site ) through a ﬂ exible linker in either 6 aa or 15 aa length ( Fig . 2a ) . We generated concatenated tags with SpyTag on either the N - or C - terminus of sfCherry2 11 with a double - glycine linker . We performed similar ﬂ ow cytometry experiments as described earlier except that mIFP was replaced by TagBFP . Among the four possible combinations of binders / tags ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , SpyCatcher - 6aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 with SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - TagBFP demonstrated the most pronounced shift towards a trend line with a slope of 1 in the scatter plot ( Fig . 2b ) . We have further veri ﬁ ed that a shorter SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 fusion without the double - gylcine spacer behaved as ef ﬁ ciently ( data not shown ) . We validated the improvement in overall brightness for cellular microscopy by labeling the N - terminus of histone 2B ( H2B ) with SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - TagBFP and co - expressing it with either sfCherry2 1 – 10 or SpyCatcher - 6aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 fusion in HEK 293T cells . We observed the Spy - assisted system ( Fig . 2c ) could mark the nuclei with much stronger ﬂ uorescence signal with the same expression vectors . We further demonstrated that the sfCherry2 11 - SpyTag can also be fused the C - terminus of the protein of interest ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) .

Pre - viously , we engineered sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 using a spacer - insertion strategy 9 . This strategy was based on inserting a 32 - aa spacer between the sfCherry 1 – 10 and sfCherry 11 coding regions . Beyond allowing mutagenesis of both fragments in a single PCR ampli - con , the spatial constraints imposed by the linker were hypo - thesized to assist in the detection of the original mutations by raising the local concentrations of complementary fragments . To increase the screening stringency for complementation - enhancing mutations , we chose to express the fragments of sfCherry2 separately from two promoters using a pETDuet vector ( Fig . 3a ) . Considering short peptides are prone to degradation in Escherichia coli , we fused the sfCherry2 11 sequence to the N - terminus of a well - folded carrier protein ( SpyCatcher in our case ) . We subjected the sfCherry2 1 – 10 fragment to four rounds of error - prone PCR mutagenesis and screening . In every round , a mixture of ~ 20 brightest variants were selected for the next round . The ﬁ nal isolated mutants were then subjected to one round of DNA shuf ﬂ ing . We have not mutated sfCherry2 11 so that all variants still bind the identical sfCherry2 11 peptide . In the end , sfCherry3C with ﬁ ve substitutions , K45R , G52D , T106A , K182R , N194D ( numbering starts from the ﬁ rst Glu after the starting codon Met ) was identi ﬁ ed as the best variant after the directed evolution ( Fig . 3b ) . All mutations were mapped to either surface orientated residues ( T106A , K182R ) or locations potentially interacting with the sfCherry2 11 peptide ( K45R , G52D , and N194D ) . To further improve the complementation ef ﬁ ciency of sfCherry3C , we introduced rational mutations inspired by a mCherry mutant named cp193g7 that is tolerant of circular permutations near our split site 18 , because this mutant contains multiple similar mutations as in sfCherry 19 and sfCherry2 ( ref . 9 ) . We combinatorially introduced the remaining mutations of cp193g7 ( I7F , F65L , and L83W ) into sfCherry3C through site - directed mutagenesis . Only the variant containing a single L83W mutation gave brighter signal than sfCherry3C , which we designated as sfCherry3V ( Fig . 3c ) . Complemented sfCherry3C 1 – 10 / 11 has an identical emission spectrum as that of sfCherry2 ( both split and full - length ) , whereas the emission spectrum of complemented sfCherry3V 1 – 10 / 11 is blue - shifted by 5 nm ( Fig . 3d ) . Fluorescence ﬂ uctuation spectroscopy indicates that sfCherry3C 1 – 10 / 11 has the same single - molecule brightness as sfCherry2 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . On the other hand , sfCherry3V 1 – 10 / 11 is dimmer at the single - molecule level ( Sup - plementary Fig . 5 ) , which might be attributed to a difference in two - photon excitation of the blue - shifted chromophore at 1000 nm in the ﬂ uorescence ﬂ uctuation spectroscopy measurement . Next , we performed the ﬂ ow cytometry analysis ( Fig . 3e ) on HEK 293T cells co - transfected with mIFP - P2A - sfCherry2 11 - Carrier and sfCherryX 1 – 10 ( X being 2 , 3C , or 3V ) . By ﬁ tting the data points ( excluding those below a threshold above the scattering background ) to a line with a ﬁ xed slope of 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ; see Supplementary Notes ) , we found a substantial up - shift of the ﬁ tted lines from sfCherry2 to sfCherry3C and sfCherry3V . The shifts corresponded to an increase of complemented signal by 2 . 5 - fold and 8 . 2 - fold , respectively . Assuming the same single - molecule brightness under one - photon excitation for ﬂ ow cytometry , this signal enhancement also means the same fold of increase in the effective af ﬁ nity between FP fragments . We have further characterized other properties of the new split sfCherry3 variants that are important in practical applications . Split sfCherry3V demonstrated similar photobleaching rate as mCherry , whereas split sfCherry3C has a slightly slower photobleaching rate ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . pH stability is another factor can affect FP performance in speci ﬁ c situations . Split sfCherry3C showed a relative low p K a ( 5 . 0 ) , close to that of mCherry ( p K a ~ 4 . 8 ) which is known to be acid tolerant 20 , whereas split sfCherry3V presented a higher p K a ( 5 . 9 ) , making it still fully ﬂ uorescent at neutral pH but more sensitive to the acidic split sfCherry2 without SpyCatcher Blue split sfCherry2 with SpyCatcher b a c Binder : Tag : SpyCatcher - 6aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - POI sfCherry2 11 - SpyTag - POI SpyCatcher - 15aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 SpyCatcher N C N SpyTag C N N sfCherry2 1 – 10 N C C sfCherry2 11 N C C Protein of interest ( POI ) SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - H2B without SpyCatcher SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - H2B with SpyCatcher 10 5 10 5 10 4 10 4 10 3 10 3 10 2 10 2 10 1 10 1 10 0 10 0 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 Red 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 Fig . 2 SpyTag / SpyCatcher - assisted complementation of split sfCherry2 1 – 10 / 11 . a Schematic diagram of SpyTag / SpyCatcher - assisted complementation and construct design . b Flow cytometry analysis of whole - cell ﬂ uorescence in HEK 293T cells expressing SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - TagBFP with either sfCherry2 1 – 10 alone or with SpyCatcher - 6aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 .

This pH sensitivity is actually bene ﬁ cial in tagging proteins in secretory pathways , which can suffer from ﬂ uorescence accumulation in lysosomes due to the inability for lysosomal protease to digest mCherry - derived ﬂ uorescent pro - teins 9 . Finally , we compared the temperature dependence of ﬂ uorescence in full length and split versions of sfCherry2 , as well as split sfCherry3C , in E . coli cultures under either 37 or 25 °C ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Although full - length sfCherry2 demon - strated similar ﬂ uorescence under different temperatures , the split sfCherry2 had lower intensity under the 37 °C . However , split sfCherry3C was able to recover the ﬂ uorescence in the physiological temperature 37 °C , which makes it advantageous for live - cell imaging applications . Endogenous protein labeling in human cells using sfCherry3 . One unique application of FP 11 tag is to generate library - scale ﬂ uorescently labeled endogenous proteins through genetic knock - in by homology - directed DNA repair . The small 16 - aa size of FP 11 allows us to ﬁ t its DNA sequence and short homology arms ( ~ 70 nt on either side ) into commercially available 200 nt single - strand oligo - DNA ( ssDNA ) . By electroporating Cas9 / sgRNA ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) and donor ssDNA into cells con - stitutively expressing the corresponding FP 1 – 10 fragment , robust generation of FP - labeled human cell lines becomes fast and cost - effective 4 . Multicolor knock - in has also been demonstrated by using orthogonal split FP systems to visualize differential dis - tribution and interaction of multiple endoplasmic reticulum proteins 9 . The overall increased brightness of complemented sfCherry3 variants make them superior to sfCherry2 in the application of labeling endogenous proteins through knock - in . Because sfCherry3 and sfCherry2 share the same FP 11 fragment , we adopted a reversed strategy as our previously reported one : knock - in of sfCherry2 11 into HEK 293T wild - type cells through electroporation , followed by lentivirus infection for the three sfCherry 1 – 10 variants ( schematics in Fig . 4a ) . A total of six sfCherry2 11 cell lines were created , with knock - ins at : lamin A / C ( LMNA , inner nuclear membrane ) , clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ) , RAB11A , heterochromatin protein 1 β ( HP1b ) , endoplasmic reticulum proteins SEC61b ( translocon complex ) , and ARL6IP1 ( tubular ER ) . We compared ﬂ uorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) enrichment ef ﬁ ciency for each cell line after infection with lentivirus ( Fig . 4b – g ) . In all examined targets , the sfCherry3C 1 – 10 and sfCherry3V 1 – 10 groups displayed remarkable population enhancement in the red - ﬂ uorescence - positive gate compared to sfCherry2 1 – 10 , rendering the sorting process substantially faster . Practically , for targets like CLTA , SEC61b , or ARL6IP1 , we were able to gate the ﬂ uorescent population around the clear peak and have 5 – 10 - fold higher yield of isolating cells with successful knock - in . We further con ﬁ rmed our knock - ins were on - target through confocal microscopy imaging ( Fig . 4b – g ) . Consistent with its higher p K a , sfCherry3V 1 – 10 groups have a reduced tendency to show ﬂ uorescent puncta from lysosomes ( Fig . 4g ) which is reported in our previous work 9 . This makes the sfCherry3V 1 – 10 the preferred protein fragment when labeling endogenous proteins involved in the endomembrane system . 580 600 620 640 660 680 700 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y ( no r m a li z e d t o m a x i m u m ) Wavelength ( nm ) Emission spectrum of sfCherry variants Full length sfCherry2 Split sfCherry2 Split sfCherry3C Split sfCherry3V sfCherry2 11 - SpyCatcher sfCherry2 1 – 10 a d b c Infrared e split sfCherry3C split sfCherry3V split sfCherry2 Split sfCherry2 Split sfCherry3C pETDuetexpressionvector pBR322ORI lacIpromotor RBS & T7 promotors Terminator 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 Red 40 , 000 30 , 000 20 , 000 10 , 000 0 Fig . 3 Engineering and characterization of split sfCherry3 . a Schematics of pETDuet - based engineering platform . b Fluorescence images of E . coli colonies expressing split sfCherry2 or sfCherry3C from the pETDuet constructs . c Protein sequence alignment of mCherry , sfCherry , sfCherry2 , sfCherry3C , and sfCherry3V .

To visualize synapses between speci ﬁ c sets of pre - and postsynaptic neurons in live animals , the trans - synaptic marker NLG - 1 GRASP was designed using split GFP fragments 8 . Com - plementary split GFP 1 – 10 / 11 fragments were linked via a ﬂ exible linker to the transmembrane synaptic protein Neuroligin , which localizes to both pre - and postsynaptic sites in Caenorhabditis elegans 8 . When the two neurons in which the complementary pre - and postsynaptic markers are expressed form synapses , the split GFP fragments come into contact , reconstitute , and ﬂ uoresce ( Fig . 5a ) . Using NLG - 1 GRASP , we discovered that the recogni - tion between two synaptic partners , the PHB sensory neurons and the AVA interneurons , is mediated the secreted ligand UNC - 6 / Netrin , its canonical receptor UNC - 40 / Deleted in Colorectal Cancer 21 , and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ( RPTP ) CLR - 1 13 . NLG - 1 GRASP has also been adapted to many other systems , indicating that this technology is transferable 22 . The addition of a red ﬂ uorescent trans - synaptic marker would greatly expand this system , allowing us to differentially label different subsets of synapses within the same animals , and potentially even within the same neuron . Leveraging the split - sfCherry3 tagging system , we have developed the split sfCherry3 - based NLG - 1 CLASP . The left and right PHB sensory neurons , located in the posterior of C . elegans , form the majority of their synapses with the left and right AVA and PVC interneurons 11 , 12 . In this study , we focused on synapses formed between the two PHB neurons with the two AVA interneurons . To visualize PHB - AVA synapses with this newly developed split sfCherry3C , constructs were generated in which the sequence encoding the large fragment sfCherry3C 1 – 10 was linked to the N - terminus of the neuroligin - 1 ( nlg - 1 ) cDNA after the nlg - 1 signal sequence via a ﬂ exible 12GS linker . This half of the marker was expressed in PHB neurons using a promoter that within the posterior half of the worm is speci ﬁ c for these presynaptic neurons ( p gpa - 6 ) 23 . The complementary small fragment sfCherry3C 11 was similarly linked to nlg - 1 and expressed in AVA neurons using a promoter that within the posterior half of the worm is speci ﬁ c for these postsynaptic neurons ( p ﬂ p - 18 ) 24 . Transgenic lines carrying both p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry3C 1 – 10 and p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry3C 11 were generated . In wild - type animals , the distribution of red ﬂ uorescent puncta was similar to those observed in animals labeled with PHB - AVA NLG - 1 GRASP ( Fig . 5 ) , and to that described by serial electron microscopy reconstruction 11 , 12 . To determine if these puncta were indeed synaptic , we introduced NLG - 1 CLASP into clr - 1 / RPTP synaptogenesis mutants . In clr - 1 / RPTP mutants , PHB - AVA NLG - 1 GRASP ﬂ uorescence intensity is dramatically reduced , and a PHB circuit - speci ﬁ c behavior is disrupted , indicating a reduction in synaptogenesis between the two neurons 13 . However , contact between the PHB and AVA neurons remains intact 13 . We found that NLG - 1 CLASP ﬂ uorescence intensity was also dramatically reduced in clr - 1 / RPTP mutants ( Fig . 5 ) , further indicating that NLG - 1 CLASP puncta are synaptic , and that NLG - 1 CLASP has very little , if any background ﬂ uorescence . We further set out to determine if NLG - 1 CLASP could be used in combination with NLG - 1 GRASP to differentially label synapses within the same neuron that were made with different neuronal partners . We focused on AVA command interneurons , with the goal of labeling synapses between PHB and AVA neurons with NLG - 1 CLASP , and synapses between AVA neurons and their postsynaptic partner , the VA and DA motorneurons , which are spaced throughout the ventral nerve cord . We generated PHB - AVA NLG - 1 CLASP constructs with sfCherry3V and generated transgenic animals carrying these as well as AVA - VA / DA NLG - 1 GRASP 8 , 13 . Previous work demonstrates that increasing the number of synapses between PHB and AVA neurons results in potentiating the response to the PHB circuit - sensed chemical sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) 13 , 21 . However , PHB circuit function in animals carrying PHB - AVA NLG - 1 CLASP as well as AVA - VA / DA NLG - 1 GRASP was normal , indicating that NLG - 1 CLASP did not induce additional synaptogenesis between PHB and AVA neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Animals carrying PHB - AVA NLG - 1 CLASP and AVA - VA / DA NLG - 1 GRASP had synaptic patterns consistent with previous electron microscopy and ﬂ uorescent labeling ( Fig . 6 ) 8 , 11 – 13 , 21 . While NLG - 1 CLASP - labeled synapses between PHB and AVA were present where PHB axons extend ( in the preanal ganglion ) , synapses between AVA and VA and DA interneurons stretched from this region anteriorly along the ventral nerve cord where VA and DA neurites are found . clr - 1 / RPTP is required for both of these sets of synapses 13 . Therefore , to test if these two markers correctly labeled synapses , we introduced sfCherry3C sfCherry3V b a c d LMNA 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 CLTA RAB11A sfCherry3C 1 – 10 sfCherry3V 1 – 10 sfCherry2 1 – 10 Negative Ctrl 2 . 91 % 2 . 88 % 0 . 27 % 0 . 03 % 13 . 1 % 13 . 5 % 4 . 63 % 0 . 03 % 16 . 7 % 18 . 3 % 1 . 56 % 0 . 03 % e f g HP1b SEC61b ARL6IP1 25 . 8 % 27 . 8 % 3 . 09 % 0 . 03 % 29 . 6 % 32 . 8 % 5 . 64 % 0 . 03 % 30 . 8 % 31 . 5 % 6 . 56 % 0 . 03 % sfCherry3C sfCherry3V Cas9 RNP sfCherry2 11 donor Electroporation 293TWT FP 1 – 10 virus infection 293T with sfCherry2 11 knock - in FACS for sfCherry + cells Fig . 4 Endogenous protein labeling in HEK 293T cells using sfCherry3 variants . a Schematic diagram of knock - in followed by virus infection and FACS enrichment . b – g Analysis of FACS sorting ef ﬁ ciency in six targets , b lamin A / C , c clathrin light chain A , d RAB11A , e heterochromatin protein 1 β , f ER translocon complex SEC61b , and g ER tubule protein ARL6IP1 , and visualization of sorted knock - in cells through confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy .

We found that ﬂ uorescence of both markers was severely reduced , consistent with these markers being synaptic . Discussion In this study , we have developed bright sfCherry3C 1 – 10 / 11 ( and its variant sfCherry3V 1 – 10 / 11 ) with enhanced complementation ef ﬁ - ciency , enabling the high - ef ﬁ cient generation of human cell lines with endogenously sfCherry - labeled proteins . Moreover , we have transformed the split sfCherry3 into a trans - synaptic marker called NLG - 1 CLASP and have demonstrated the visualization of speci ﬁ c synapses in living nervous systems .

For BiFC analysis , this af ﬁ nity is one of the major determinant of the sensitivity . If it is too low , the split FP will fail to produce suf ﬁ cient complementation signal even when the probed molecular interaction does occur . On the other hand , the opposite extreme leads to high background complementation as observed in certain split constructs 6 . While this K ′ D is not straightforward to measure biochemically in vitro due to the overall irreversible nature of complementation , our steady - state ﬂ ow cytometry analysis provides a reliable way to characterize it in cells . Our model also shows that the overall complemented signal is determined not only thermodynamically by the initial binding af ﬁ nity and local fragment concentrations , but also kinetically by the rates of folding , chromophore maturation and protein degradation . The assisted complementation demonstrated by SpyTag / Spy - Catcher presents a simple way to improve complementation ef ﬁ ciency between FP fragments . This strategy can be expanded to multicolor imaging using FP 11 tagging using orthogonal bin - der / tag pairs such as SnoopTag / SnoopCatcher ( engineered by splitting an adhesin from Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 ) or SsrA / SspB ( a degradation tag and its adaptor protein from bacterial ClpX ATPase 28 , 29 ) .

A highly ef ﬁ cient complementation process not only guarantees an enhanced overall brightness , but also enables us to tune down the expres - sion level of FP 1 – 10 fragments which might otherwise exhaust the cellular machinery that maintaining the protein homeostasis ( biogenesis , folding , traf ﬁ cking , and degradation of proteins ) . This bene ﬁ t is essential in scenarios that are sensitive to the expression of exogenous proteins , such as tagging endogenous proteins in embryos . Moreover , our engineering platform based on pETDuet vector can be utilized to optimize other self - associating split FPs with insuf ﬁ cient complementation ef ﬁ ciency , such as mNG2 1 – 10 / 11 . Utilizing the split sfCherry3 1 – 10 / 11 construct , we have estab - lished a completely orthogonal , red - colored trans - synaptic mar - ker called NLG - 1 - CLASP . We demonstrate that this marker can be used in combination with the original green ﬂ uorescent trans - synaptic marker NLG - 1 GRASP to label subsets of synapses made between a neuron and different synaptic partners . Similar cyan and yellow trans - synaptic markers ( called dual - eGRASP ) have recently been generated in vertebrates 30 . The use of NLG - 1 CLASP with these cyan and yellow trans - synaptic markers has the potential to allow simultaneous and differential labeling of synapses between a single neuron and three synaptic partners in live animals . Since many synaptic connections within the nema - tode have overlapping localizations within the nerve ring and other nerve bundles 11 , 12 , this tool will allow accurate visualization of multiple subsets of a single neuron ’ s connections . These tools may similarly be of use in densely innervated regions of the vertebrate nervous system , such as the hippocampus and cortex . Thus , we propose that NLG - 1 CLASP will be a powerful tool with which to probe the development and plasticity of neural circuits within live animals . Taken together , our work greatly expands the SAsFP toolbox , not only by providing a new , red SAsFP with improved com - plementation signal , but also by mechanistic elucidation of the complementation process to laid down rational engineering routes . These advancements have led to a drastic ef ﬁ ciency improvement in red - tagging of endogenous proteins via gene editing to systematically visualize protein – protein colocalization and interactions . Moreover , they also create a completely ortho - gonal color channel for the detection of neuronal synapses , allowing simultaneous and differential labeling of synapses between multiple synaptic partners in live animals , paving the way for mapping complex neuronal connectivity networks , and understanding the genes and environmental factors that shape and in ﬂ uence neuronal connectivity . Methods Molecular cloning . The DNA sequence of SpyCatcher 002 and SpyTag 002 ( based on the reported sequence from ref . 17 ) were directly synthesized ( Integrated DNA Technologies , IDT ) . The DNAs of histone H2B , TOMM20 , TagBFP , and mIFP were subcloned from mEmerald , TagBFP , or mIFP fusion plasmids ( cDNA source : the Michael Davidson Fluorescent Protein Collection at the UCSF Nikon Imaging Center ) using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . The P2A sequence are GCTACTAACTTCAGCCTGCTGAAGCAGGCTGGA - GACGTGGAGGAGAACCCTGGACCT . The lentiviral plasmids pSFFV - GFP 1 – 10 , pSFFV - mNG2 1 – 10 , and pSFFV - sfCherry2 1 – 10 were generated in our previous research 9 . To build three pSFFV - mIFP - P2A - FP 11 - SpyCatcher constructs ( used in Fig . 1a – c ) , three DNA fragments encoding mIFP , P2A - FP 11 , and SpyCatcher were ligated into linearized pSFFV vector ( Bam HI / Not I ) using In - Fusion HD Cloning kit ( Clontech ) within one reaction . To construct pSFFV - TagBFP - P2A - sfCherry2 1 – 10 plasmid ( used in Fig . 1d ) , two DNA fragments encoding TagBFP or P2A were ligated in to linearized pSFFV - sfCherry2 1 – 10 vector using In - Fusion . To generate pcDNA - SpyCatcher - 6aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 and pcDNA - SpyCatcher - 15aa - sfCherry2 1 – 10 plasmids ( used in Fig . 2a , b ) , PCR amplicons encoding SpyCatcher or sfCherry2 1 – 10 were cloned into digested pcDNA3 . 1 vectors ( Hin dIII / Bam HI ) , and the different linkers were achieved through designing overlapping primers with various linker lengths . To make pSFFV - SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - TagBFP , pSFFV - SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 - TagBFP - H2B ( used in Fig . 2b , c ) , pmEmerald - TOMM20 - sfCherry2 11 - SpyTag , DNA fragments encoding SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 , TagBFP and H2B , or sfCherry2 11 - SpyTag were ligated in to either linearized pSFFV vector ( Bam HI / Not I ) or linearized pmEmerald ( Age I / Not I ) through In - Fusion . The pETDuet - 1 vector was kindly donated by Dr . Alexander Kintzer from Dr . Robert Stroud ’ s laboratory at UCSF . We generated the initial plasmid for mutagenesis screening by two rounds of In - Fusion ligation reaction : inserting the PCR amplicon encoding sfCherry2 1 – 10 into the ﬁ rst multiple cloning site ( MCS ) of pETDuet - 1 digested by Nco I , followed by inserting the DNA sequence encoding sfCherry2 11 - SpyCatcher into the second MCS of pETDuet - 1 digested by Nde I . The Nco I restriction site preserved in the ﬁ nal product , but the Nde I restriction site was destroyed . For the mammalian expression and lentiviral production , DNAs of sfCherry3C 1 – 10 were directly PCR ampli ﬁ ed from identi ﬁ ed pETDuet - 1 construct ( ﬁ nal mutant ) and cloned into the lentiviral pSFFV vector ( Bam HI / Not I ) . To generate the sfCherry3V 1 – 10 variant , we introduced the point mutation L83W into pSFFV - sfCherry3C 1 – 10 plasmid using QuikChange II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . For the complete nucleotide sequence of sfCherry3C 1 – 10 , sfCherry3V 1 – 10 , SpyCatcher 002 , and SpyTag 002 , see Supplementary Table 1 . Constructs used in the NLG - 1 CLASP application were generated using standard molecular techniques . To generate p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry3C 1 – 10 construct ( MVC227 ) , sfCherry3C 1 – 10 was ampli ﬁ ed from pSFFV - sfCherry3C 1 – 10 using the following primers : MVP846 ( AGCTGCTAGCATGGAACGCATTTATCTTCTT CTCCTTCTTTTTCTGCCCAGGATACGATCCATGGAGGAGGACAACATGG ) and MVP847 ( TCCGGAGCTCGTCCTCGTTGTGGCTGGT ) . The fragment was subcloned into p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : GFP 1 – 10 ( MVC6 ) 21 , replacing GFP 1 – 10 , using the Nhe I and Sac I sites . To generate the p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry2 11 ( MVC228 ) construct , sfCherry2 11 was ampli ﬁ ed from H 2 B - sfCherry2 11 using the following primers : MVP848 ( AGCTGCTAGCATGGAACGCATTTATCTTCTTCTCCTTCTTTT TCTGCCCAGGATACGATCCTACACCATCGTGGAGCAGT ) and MVP849 ( TCCGGAGCTCGGTGCTGTGTCTGGCCTC ) . The fragment was subcloned into p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : GFP 11 ( MVC12 ) 21 , replacing GFP 11 , using the Nhe I and Sac I sites . To generate p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : SFCherry 3V1 – 10 ( MVC233 ) construct , site - directed mutagenesis ( SDM ) was performed using the QuikChange II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit on p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry3C 1 – 10 ( MVC227 ) using following primers : MVP861 ( GGGGAAGCTCAGCTTCCAGTAGTCGGGGATGTCG ) and MVP862 ( CGACATCCCCGACTACTGGAAGCTGAGCTTCCCC ) .

U2OS cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) were cultured in DMEM media , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidi ﬁ ed incubator . For the lentiviral production , 1× 10 6 HEK 293T cells were plated into T25 one day prior to transfection . Four hundred and thirty nanograms of pMD2 .

The virus containing supernatant is har - vested 48 h after transfection and were centrifuged to pellet any packaging cells . Virus containing medium is used immediately or stored in − 80 °C freezer for future use . For single - molecule brightness measurement sample preparation , U2OS cells were grown in 24 - well plates with # 1 . 5 glass coverslip bottoms ( In Vitro Scienti ﬁ c ) and transfected ~ 24h before measurement using GenJet transfection reagent ( SignaGen Laboratories ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Immediately before measurement , the growth media was exchanged with PBS buffer with calcium and magnesium ( Gibco ) . Sample preparation and data analysis in ﬂ ow cytometry .

To validate the increased complementation of split sfCherry3 variants versus split sfCherry2 , we made pSFFV - sfCherry3C 1 – 10 and pSFFV - sfCherry3V 1 – 10 constructs .

Analytical ﬂ ow cytometry was carried out on a LSR II instrument ( BD Biosciences ) and cell sorting on a FACSAria II ( BD Biosciences ) in Laboratory for Cell Analysis at UCSF . Flow cytometry data analysis ( gating by the scattering channel and plotting ) was conducted using the FlowJo software ( FlowJo LLC ) . Single - molecule brightness measurement and data analysis . Fluorescence brightness measurements were carried out on a homebuilt two - photon microscope , which has been previously described 31 . Pulsed laser light ( 100fs pulses with a repetition frequency of 80MHz ) from a mode - locked Ti - Sapphire laser ( Mai - Tai , Spectra Physics ) was focused by a ×63 C - Apochromat water immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 2 , Zeiss ) to create two - photon excitation . The emitted ﬂ uorescence was collected by the same objective and separated from the excitation light by a dichroic mirror ( 675DCSXR , Chroma Technology ) . The ﬂ uorescence emission was sepa - rated into two detection channels by a 580 nm dichroic mirror ( 585DCXR , Chroma Technology ) , and the green channel was further ﬁ ltered by an 84nm - wide bandpass ﬁ lter centered at 510 nm ( FF01 - 510 / 84 - 25 , Semrock ) . Avalanche photodiodes ( SPCM - AQ - 14 , Perkin - Elmer ) detected the ﬂ uorescence signal , and photon counts were recorded by a data acquisition card ( FLEX02 , Correlator . com ) for ~ 60s with a sampling frequency of 200 kHz . All measurements were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 1000 nm and a measured power after the objective of ~ 0 . 46 mW . The photon count record was analyzed to recover Mandel ’ s Q parameter as pre - viously described 32 using programs written for IDL 8 . 7 ( Research Systems , Inc . ) . The Q value is converted into brightness λ , which represents the average ﬂ uores - cence intensity per molecule , using the relation Q = γ 2 λ T , where T represents the sampling time and γ 2 is a shape - dependent factor whose value has been determined as described previously 33 . Mutagenesis and screening . The amino - acid sequence of sfCherry2 and the split site were from our previous published literature 9 . The sfCherry2 1 – 10 sequence was subjected to random mutagenic PCR ( forward primer : AGGAGATATACCATG GAGGAGGACAAC , reverse primer : CTGCTGCCCATGTCAGTCCTCGTTGTG ) using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . A high mutation rate protocol suggested in the instruction manual was adapted , with an initial target DNA amount of 0 . 2µg and 30 - cycle ampli ﬁ cation . The cDNA library pool was gel - puri ﬁ ed and ligated into a PCR - linearized pETDuet vector ( forward primer : TGACATGGGCAGCAGCCA , reverse primer : CATGGTATATCTCCTT CTTAAAGTTAAACAAAATTATTTCTAGAGG . The product only contains the sfCherry2 11 - SpyCatcher coding sequence in the second MCS but not the sfCherry2 1 – 10 in the 1 ﬁ rstMCS . ) using In - Fusion . The plasmid pool was then transformed into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) electrocompetent cells ( Lucigen ) by electro - poration using the Gene Pulser Xcell ™ Electroporation Systems ( Bio - Rad ) . The expression library was evenly plated on nitrocellulose membrane ( Whatman , 0 . 45 µm pore size ) , which was sitting on an LB - agar plate with 30mg ml − 1 kanamycin . After overnight growth at 37°C , the nitrocellulose membrane was carefully transferred onto a new LB - agar plate containing 1mM isopropyl - β - D - thioga - lactoside ( IPTG ) and 30 mgml – 1 kanamycin and cultured for another 3 – 6h at 37 ° C to induce the protein production . We performed the clone screening by imaging the IPTG - containing LB - agar plate using a BioSpectrum Imaging System ( UVP ) . The brightest candidates in each library were pooled ( typically ~ 20 from approximately 10 , 000 colonies ) and served as templates for the next round of directed evolution . The DNA sequences of selected constructs were con ﬁ rmed by sequencing ( Quintara Biosciences ) . For DNA shuf ﬂ ing , we adopted the protocol described in Yu et al . 34 . Speci ﬁ cally , we PCR ampli ﬁ ed the brightest six sfCherry3 1 – 10 variants ( forward primer : AGGAGATATACCATGGAGGAGGAC AAC , reverse primer : CTGCTGCCCATGTCAGTCCTCGTTGTG ) from the last round of random mutagenesis screening . PCR products of 651 bp were puri ﬁ ed from 1 % agarose gels using zymoclean gel DNA gel recovery kit ( Zymo Research ) . The DNA concentrations were measured in Nanodrop and the fragments were mixed at equal amounts for a total of ~ 2 µg . The mixture was then digested with 0 . 5 unit DNase I ( New England Biolabs ) for 13 min and terminated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min . The DNase I digests were run on a 2 % agarose gel , and the band with a size of 50 – 100bp was selected and puri ﬁ ed . Ten microliters of puri ﬁ ed fragments was added to 10 µl of Phusion High - Fidelity PCR Master Mix and reassembled with a PCR program of 30 cycles , with each cycle consisting of 95°C for 60 s , 50 °C for 60s , and 72 °C for 30 s . After reassembly , 1µl of this reaction was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR . The shuf ﬂ ed library was then transformed , expressed , and screened as described above . After the directed evolution was saturated ( no apparent ﬂ uorescence increase in the induced colonies ) , the brightest clone was selected and the DNA sequences of the constructs were con ﬁ rmed by sequencing ( Quintara Biosciences ) . The emission spectra of split sfCherry variants ( in E . coli solution culture expressing FPs ) were measurement on a Synergy ™ H4 Hybrid Multi - Mode Microplate Reader from UCSF Center for Advanced Technology . CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated gene editing . We purchased synthetic single - strand DNA oligos from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) . We prepared sgRNAs and Cas9 / sgRNA RNP complexes following our published methods 4 . Speci ﬁ cally , sgRNAs were obtained by in vitro - transcribing DNA templates containing a T7 promoter ( TAATACGACTCACTATAG ) , an sgRNA scaffold region , and the gene - speci ﬁ c 20 nt sgRNA sequence . DNA templates were produced by overlapping PCR using a set of four primers : three common primers ( forward primer T25 : 5 ′ - TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG - 3 ′ ; reverse primer BS7 : 5 ′ - AAA AAA AGC ACC GAC TCG GTG C - 3 ′ ; and reverse primer ML611 : 5 ′ - AAA AAA AGC ACC GAC TCG GTG CCA CTT TTT CAA GTT GAT AAC GGA CTA GCC TTA TTT AAA CTT GCT ATG CTG TTT CCA GCA TAG CTC TTA AAC - 3 ′ ) and one gene - speci ﬁ c primer ( forward primer 5 ′ - TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG NNN NNN NNN NNN NNN NNN NNG TTT AAG AGC TAT GCT GGA A - 3 ′ ) . For each template , a 50 μ L PCR was performed with Phusion ® High - Fidelity PCR Master Mix ( New England Biolabs ) reagents with the addition of 1 μ M T25 , 1 μ M BS7 , 20nM ML611 , and 20 nM gene - speci ﬁ c primer . The PCR product was puri ﬁ ed and eluted in 12 μ L of RNAse - free DNA buffer . Next , a 100 - μ L in vitro transcription reaction was performed with ~ 300 ng DNA template from PCR product and 1000 U of T7 RNA polymerase in buffer containing 40mM Tris pH 7 . 9 , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT , 2 mM spermidine and 2mM of each NTP ( New England BioLabs ) . Following a 4h incubation at 37°C , the sgRNA product was puri ﬁ ed and eluted in 15 μ L of RNAse - free RNA buffer . The sgRNA was quality - checked by running 5 pg of the product on Mini - PROTEAN TBE Precast Gels ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) at 200 V for 60 – 80 min . For the knock - in of sfCherry2 11 into HEK 293T wild - type ( WT ) cells , 200 nt homology - directed recombination ( HDR ) templates were ordered in single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) from IDT . For the complete set of DNA sequence used for sgRNA in vitro transcription or HDR templates , see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 . Cas9 protein ( pMJ915 construct , containing two nuclear localization sequences ) was expressed in E . coli and puri ﬁ ed by the University of California Berkeley Macrolab . HEK 293T WT cells were treated with 200ng ml – 1 nocodazole ( Sigma ) for ~ 17h before electroporation to increase HDR ef ﬁ ciency . One hundred picomoles Cas9 protein and 130 pmol sgRNA were assembled into Cas9 / sgRNA RNP complexes just before nucleofection and combined with 150pmol HDR template in a ﬁ nal volume of 10 μ L . Electroporation was performed in an Amaxa 96 - well shuttle Nuleofector device ( Lonza ) using SF - cell line reagents ( Lonza ) . Nocodazole - treated cells were resuspended to 10 4 cells μ L – 1 in SF solution immediately prior to electroporation . For each sample , 20 μ L of cells was added to the 10 μ L RNP / template mixture . Cells were immediately electroporated using the CM130 program and transferred to a 48 - well plate with pre - warmed medium . Electroporated cells were cultured and expanded for 7 – 10 days prior to lentiviral transduction . One day before lentiviral transduction , knocked - in cells well split and seeded in a 12 - well plate at 6 – 8× 10 4 per well for four wells . The con ﬂ uency should reach 70 – 80 % on the day of transduction . The lentivirus titer of sfCherry2 1 – 10 , sfCherry3C 1 – 10 , or sfCherry3V 1 – 10 was quanti ﬁ ed independently by Lenti - X GoStix Plus kit ( Takara , Cat # 631280 ) immediately before infection . And the supernatant was diluted ( around 1 : 5 dilution ) with fresh medium to make sure the ﬁ nal virus concentrations are the same across groups . The experimental groups were treated with 1ml diluted sfCherry2 1 – 10 , sfCherry3C 1 – 10 , or sfCherry3V 1 – 10 viral supernatant supplemented with 10 μ g polybrene ( MilliporeSigma ) , respectively . The negative control was treated with fresh medium supplemented with the same concentration of polybrene . Twenty - four after infection , the viral supernatant was swapped with fresh medium . After another 48 – 72hours , the infected cells were harvested for ﬂ ow cytometry analysis and cell sorting . Fluorescence microscopy . In preparation of cell samples for the imaging purpose , to achieve better cell attachment , the eight - well glass bottom chamber ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) was coated with Fibronectin ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 45min , washed three times by PBS , and subjected to air - dry before seeding cells . To validate the performance of Spy - assisted complementation in enhancing the overall brightness of protein labeling ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , we transfected either HEK 293T cells or HeLa cells ( 0 . 8 – 1 . 5× 10 4 per well ) grown on an eight - well chamber using FuGene HD according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Promega ) . Total plasmid amount of 180 ng per well with the FP 11 to FP 1 – 10 ratio in 1 : 2 was used to achieve optimal expression and labeling . For SpyTag - sfCherry2 11 linked to the N - terminal of H2B , HEK 293T cells were ﬁ xed 48 h after transfection with 4 % par - aformaldehyde and then imaged on a Nikon Ti - E inverted wide - ﬁ eld ﬂ uorescence microscope equipped with an LED light source ( Excelitas X - Cite XLED1 ) , a ×40 0 . 55 NA air objective ( Nikon ) , a motorized stage ( ASI ) , and an sCMOS camera ( Tucsen ) . For sfCherry2 11 - SpyTag linked to the C - terminal of TOMM20 , 48 h after transfection , HeLa cells were imaged live on an inverted Nikon Ti - E microscope ( UCSF Nikon Imaging Center ) , a Yokogawa CSU - W1 confocal scanner unit , a Plan Apo VC ×100 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective , a stage incubator , an Andor Zyla ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 019 - 0589 - x 10 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2019 ) 2 : 344 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 019 - 0589 - x | www . nature . com / commsbio 4 . 2 sCMOS camera , and MicroManager2 . 0 software . Live - cell imaging ( Fig . 4b – g ) of sorted successful knock - in HEK 293T cells ( with either sfCherry3C 1 – 10 or sfCherry3V 1 – 10 infection ) was acquired under the same condition . Photoactivation of HEK 293T cells co - transfected with sfCherry2 11 - H2B and PAsfCherry2 1 – 10 was acquired from the above - mentioned confocal microscope with the same setting . Photoactivation process was completed by 405 nm laser exposure . Mean ﬂ uorescence intensity ( MFI ) of each nucleus was quanti ﬁ ed in ImageJ using an identical mask at three different time points : before activation , right after activation , and 10 min after activation ( samples were kept still on the stage during this period ) . The absolute MFI of each nucleus at three time points was normalized to the intensity right after activation . Ten cells were analyzed to generate the bar graph in GraphPad Prism . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and photoactivation experiments ( Supplementary Figs . 1 and 2 ) were performed on the same microscopy with a Vortran 473 nm laser ( power = 9 . 0 mW ) for photobleaching and a Rapp Optoelectronic UGA - 40 photobleaching system ( COM5 ) . The frame interval of the movie is 2 . 5 s and the total length is 10 min . The photobleaching was conducted by scanning the 473 nm ( 50 mW ) laser over the region of interest ( marked by the yellow rectangular ) . A background image ( taken at the same imaging condition without putting on any sample ) was subtracted from the live - cell microscopy images using the ImageJ software . Analysis of ﬂ uorescence microscopy images were performed in ImageJ . Photobleaching analysis . We measured the photobleaching properties of mCherry , split sfCherry3C , and split sfCherry3V in HEK 293T cells expressing these ﬂ uorescent proteins labeling the Lamin B structure , under the above - mentioned confocal microscope using a Plan Apo VC ×100 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective . To trace the ﬂ uorescent intensities for live imaging of Lamins , we used Plot z - axis Pro ﬁ le function in ImageJ . For each photobleaching experiment , we calculated the MFI in a small ROI of lamin in one cell over the duration of the experiment ( 300s ) , subtracted the background using a background image taken without samples under the same condition , and normalized the trajectory to the value of the ﬁ rst frame . Supplementary Fig . 7 reported the normalized photo - bleaching trajectories from ﬁ ve experiments for each construct ( mCherry , split sfCherry3C , and split sfCherry3V ) . The half - life of each ﬂ uorescent proteins were calculated by ﬁ tting every trajectory to a single exponential decay model using GraphPad Prism . pH stability measurement . To characterize the pH stability of split sfCherry3C and split sfCherry3V and compare them with full - length mCherry , we measured their ﬂ uorescent intensity in labeling the H2B structure of mammalian cells after ﬁ xation under physiological ( pH = 7 . 4 ) and acidic ( pH = 6 and 5 ) conditions . We used comercial phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , pH = 7 . 4 , 1× , Gibco ) as the phy - siological buffer . Acidic PBS ( pH = 6 ) was prepared from PBS ( pH = 7 . 4 ) and hydrochloric acid ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) ; acetate buffer ( pH = 5 ) was prepared from acetate sodium ( Sigma Aldrich ) and acetic acid ( Acros Organics ) . pH value was measured by pH Meter ( pH700 , Oakton ) . HeLa cells were transfected with split sfCherry3C , split sfCherry3V , full - length mCherry in eight - well chamber ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . After 45 h expression , cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 – 15 min and kept in PBS ( pH = 7 . 4 ) till imaging . All images were acquired on a Nikon Ti Microscope , a Plan Fluor ×10 0 . 3 objective and 561 nm laser . For each sample , image of pH = 7 . 4 was ﬁ rstly taken , then we gently changed buffer to acidic PBS ( pH = 6 ) without disturbing the samples . After acquiring the image of pH = 6 , the buffer was changed to acetate buffer ( pH = 5 ) carefully and the image of pH = 5 was taken . During the whole process of taking three images , the ﬁ eld of view was kept identical . Background images of microscope were acquired without samples . Images were analyzed in ImageJ . The background value was subtracted from every image by an Image calculator . For every sample , masks of cells were generated under pH = 7 . 4 and applied to all three pHs to get MFI of each cell under different pHs . The relative intensity ratio was normalized to pH = 7 . 4 . Average of intensities of different samples were compared and plotted in GraphPad Prism . These intensities are directly proportional to the amount of chromophores in the deprotonated state . Therefore , we obtained the chromophore p K a value by ﬁ tting the intensity dependence on pH to a titration curve . The measured p K a for mCherry ( 4 . 8 ) is consistent with literature values , demonstrating the accuracy of our approach . Temperature stability measurement . To characterize the temperature stability of split sfCherry2 and sfCherry3C , and compare them to the full - length sfCherry2 , we measured their relative ﬂ uorescence intensity under physiological temperature ( 37 °C ) and room temperature ( 25°C ) in living E . coli cultures . E . coli cells transformed with pETDuet - sfCherry2 ( full length ) , pETDuet - sfCherry2 1 – 10 - RBS - sfCherry2 11 - SpyCatcher , or pETDuet - sfCherry3C 1 – 10 - RBS - sfCherry2 11 - SpyCatcher were ﬁ rst cultured overnight to saturation , then diluted back in 1mM IPTG - containing medium to induce the protein expression . After 5 h protein induction under 37 °C or 25 °C , the ﬂ uorescence intensity ( excitation at 561 nm , emission at 610 nm ) and cell density ( OD600 ) were acquired a Synergy ™ H4 Hybrid Multi - Mode Microplate Reader at 37 or 25°C . The ﬂ uorescence intensity of each con - struct was ﬁ rst normalized by the cell density and then normalized to the intensity at 37 °C . Data analysis and plotting were conducted using GradPad Prism . Generation of NLG - 1 CLASP in C . elegans . All C . elegans strains were maintained using standard protocols 35 and were raised on 60 mm Nematode Growth Media plates seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli at 20°C . Wild - type strains were C . elegans variety Bristol , strain N2 , and the mutant strain used for this study was clr - 1 ( e1745 ) II . Transgenic strains include wyEx1982 ( ref . 21 ) , wyEx1982 ; clr - 1 , iyEx368 , iyEx368 ; clr - 1 , iyEx403 and iyEx403 , clr - 1 . wyEx1982 contains the extra - chromosomal PHB - AVA NLG - 1 GRASP marker ( p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : GFP 1 – 10 ( 60ng μ L – 1 ) , p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : GFP 11 ( 30 ng μ L – 1 ) , p nlp - 1 : : mCherry ( 10 ng μ L – 1 ) , p ﬂ p - 18 : : mCherry ( 5 ng μ L – 1 ) , and p odr - 1 : : DsRedII ( 20 ng μ L – 1 ) ) . iyEx368 contains the extra - chromosomal PHB - AVA NLG - 1 CLASP marker ( p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry3C 1 – 10 ( 68 ng μ L – 1 ) , p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry2 11 ( 38 . 6 ng μ L – 1 ) , p nlp - 1 : : GFP ( 4 . 5 ng μ L – 1 ) , and p odr - 1 : : DsRedII ( 39 ng μ L – 1 ) ) . iyEx403 contains the extra - chromosomal PHB - AVA NLG - 1 CLASP marker ( p gpa - 6 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry3V 1 – 10 ( 73 ng μ L – 1 ) , p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : sfCherry2 11 ( 38 . 5 ng μ L – 1 ) ) , and the AVA - VA / DA NLG - 1 GRASP ( p unc - 4 : : nlg - 1 : : GFP 1 – 10 ( 20 ng μ L – 1 ) 8 , p ﬂ p - 18 : : nlg - 1 : : GFP 11 ( 30 ng μ L – 1 ) ) 8 , and p odr - 1 : : DsRedII ( 39 ng μ L – 1 ) ) . A Zeiss Axio Imager . A1 compound ﬂ uorescent microscope was used to capture images of live C . elegans under ×63 magni ﬁ cation . Worms were paralyzed on 2 % agarose pads using a 2 : 1 ratio of 0 . 3M 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) and 10 mM levamisole in M9 buffer . All micrographs taken of PHB - AVA NLG - 1 GRASP and NLG - 1 CLASP markers were of larval stage 4 animals . All data from micrographs were quanti ﬁ ed using NIH ImageJ software . Intensity of PHB - AVA NLG - 1 GRASP and PHB - AVA NLG - 1 CLASP was measured as previously described 13 , 21 . Brie ﬂ y , the intensity at each pixel within each synaptic puncta was measured using NIH ImageJ . To account for differences in background ﬂ uorescence , background intensity was estimated by calculating the minimum intensity value in a region immediately adjacent to the puncta . This minimum intensity value was then subtracted from the intensity for each pixel , and the sum of the adjusted values was calculated . For control , pictures of wild - type animals were also taken on the same day using the same settings . SDS behavior assay . The SDS behavioral assay was used to test the function of the PHB circuit in Supplementary Fig . 10 , and has been previously described 13 , 21 . Brie ﬂ y , animals are placed on partially dried plates , and induced to move backwards by touching their nose with a hair - pick . A drop of M13 control buffer or 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) diluted in M13 buffer is placed behind the animal , and quickly absorbs into the dry plate . The time the animal backs into the dry drop before stopping is then measured . It is important that the drop is dry so that it does not wick along the animal and activate sensory neurons outside the PHB circuit . Wild - type animals usually back up into M13 buffer for well over a second , but stop backing into 0 . 1 % SDS in less than a second . Eighty wild - type and 80 marker - carrying animals were tested in this study . Forty animals from each genotype were tested with control M13 buffer , and 40 animals from each genotype were tested with 0 . 1 % SDS in M13 buffer . The relative response index is calculated by dividing the response time to 0 . 1 % SDS by the average response time to M13 buffer for the same genotype . The response index for marker - carrying animals was normalized to the response index for wild - type animals tested on the same day . Statistics and reproducibility . For all characterizations of FP and split FP con - structs by ﬂ ow cytometry , ﬂ uorescence ﬂ uctuation spectroscopy and microscopy , we have repeated the experiments with at least two biological replicates which have yielded consistent results .
