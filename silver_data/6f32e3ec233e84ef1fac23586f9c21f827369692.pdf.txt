Hematopoiesis is the process that generates blood cells of all lineages . However , platelets are the smallest blood component produced from the very large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes and they play a fundamental role in thrombosis and hemostasis . Platelets contribute their hemostatic capacity via adhesion , activation and aggregation , which are triggered upon tissue injury , and these actions stimulate the coagulation factors and other mediators to achieve hemostasis . In addition , these coordinated series of events are the vital biological processes for wound healing phases . The aim of this review is to summarize and highlight the important pathways involved in achieving hemostasis that are ruled by platelets . In addition , this review also describes the mechanism action of platelets , including adhesion , activation , aggregation , and coagulation , as well as the factors that aid in hemostasis and wound healing . Keywords : Platelets , Hemostasis , Coagulation pathways , Coagulation factors , Wound healing INTRODUCTION When platelets decrease in number or become malfunction , the risk of hemorrhage is very high . Platelets , which circulate within the blood , are the essential mediators that trigger the mechanical pathway of the coagulation cascade upon encountering any damage to the blood vessels . Platelets encourage primary hemostasis via three major processes : activation , adhesion and aggregation . When the integrity of the vascular endothelium is interrupted , various macromolecular elements of the vascular subendothelium become exposed and readily accessible to platelets ( Table 1 ) 1 - 2 . Hemostasis Hemostasis is a process to prevent hemorrhage by arresting and keeping the blood within the damaged vessel walls . Hemostasis is a complex process that is contingent on the complex interaction of platelets , plasma coagulation cascades , fibrinolytic proteins , blood vasculatures and cytokine mediators . Upon tissue injury , the hemostatic mechanism employs a plethora of vascular and extravascular receptors , in accordance with the blood components , to seal off the impairments to the vasculature and closing it off from the encircling tissues . Normal hemostatic responses can be organized into six different Mercy Halleluyah Periayah , et al . IJHOSCR , 1 October .

Platelets release their granules upon activation to interact with other platelet cells . Supply the energy source for platelet interactions . Act as the metabolic or cytoplasmic pool . They mainly contain Fibrinogen ( Fib ) , thrombospodin , factor V , von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , beta - thromboglobuline ( β - TG ) , and factor IV . Upon activation , platelets release their granules to interact with other platelets . The actin and myosin cytoskeleton organizes a network to sustain the platelet’s discoid shape . Upon activation , membrane receptors interlink through this network to allow platelets to change shapes into pseudopodia forms and eventually release their granule contents .

Primary function To stop hemorrhage following vascular injury Other functions Fight microbial infections , trigger inflammation to promote tumor angiogenesis and metastasis process , secrete inflammatory mediators and aid in wound therapy Mechanism Under normal circumstances , platelets do not adhere to the vessel wall . However , upon tissue injury , platelets adhere to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) by exchanging signals with many receptors and mediators to coordinate rolling of platelets to adhere at the sites of vascular injury .

Vasoconstriction phase . Primary hemostasis is characterized by vasoconstriction , which is the initial phase for stopping the blood flow 10 . Vascular spasm occurs whenever there is an injury or damage to the blood vessels . This will trigger a vasoconstriction , which could eventually stop the blood flow . This reaction can be responded within 30 minutes , and is localized to the injured area . At this stage , exposed collagen fibers will release ATP and other inflammatory mediators to recruit macrophages . In addition , the ECM becomes highly thrombogenicity , promoting platelet adhesion and aggregation 10 - 12 . Platelet plug formation Figure 3 . Platelet plug formation . Injuries on the endothelial cells highly exposes to thrombogenic , subendothelial ECM to ease platelet adherences and activation . Platelet activation triggers platelet shape changes by releasing secretory granules . Released secretary granules will recruit additional platelets to form the platelet plug , which is referred to as primary hemostasis 10 . Following vasoconstriction , exposed collagen from the damaged surface will encourage platelets to adhere , activate and aggregate to form a platelet plug , sealing off the injured area . Platelet adhesion The platelet adhesion mechanism is generally supported by the particular interactions between the membrane receptors and absorbed plasma tyrosine kinases and G - protein coupled receptors , which supports platelet activation , resulting in granule release and increasing the number of platelets . Platelet adherence and activation initiate platelet aggregation to provide a procoagulant surface engaged in the formation of a fibrin - rich hemostatic plug at the injured area . Activated platelets stimulate endothelial cells to synthesize and secrete molecules that control and limit the formation of a thrombus .

The platelet membrane receptors are enriched with Gp receptors embedded in the phospholipid bilayer , including tyrosine kinase receptors , integrins , leucine rich receptors ; G - protein coupled transmembrane receptors , selectins and immunoglobulin domain receptors . These are the important proteins involved to facilitate hemostatic function by mediating the interactions within cell - platelet and platelet - substrates 13 - 15 . The initial event that occurs upon hemostasis is the rolling and adherence of the platelets to the exposed subendothelium . Platelet adhesion is mediated by von Willebrand Factor ( vWF ) that binds to Gp Ib - IX in the platelet membrane . vWF is a blood Gp that serves as an adhesive protein , which could bind to other proteins , especially factor VIII at the wound sites 10 , 16 - 17 , 19 . Platelet activation Figure 4 . Platelet activation process . The schematic diagram portrays the internal organelles with prominent crucial storage contents that are involved in platelet activations and aid in platelet aggregation 20 . A variety of stimuli can activate platelets . Platelet cells can also be activated upon biomaterial surface stimulation . Adhered platelets undergo degranulation and release cytoplasmic granules that contain serotonin , platelet activating factors and ADP . ADP is an important physiological agonist stored in the dense bodies of platelets that play an essential function in normal hemostasis and thrombosis . Platelets are activated to change shapes into a pseudopodal form upon the adhesion to the injured area which will activate the collagen receptors on their surface membrane , named GpIIbIIIa , to undergo release reactions . The GpIIbIIIa complex , organized through calcium - dependent association of GpIIb and GpIIIa that is a necessary step in platelet aggregation and endothelial adherence 21 - 23 . At the same time , platelets tend to synthesize and discharge thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) , aiding in vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation . In addition , GpIIbIIIa integrins and P - selectin move from the α - granule membrane to the platelet membrane to support platelet aggregation . Additionally , these are the receptors that could act as the catalytic surface and facilitate the hemostasis process 21 - 24 . Platelet aggregation Figure 5 . Platelet aggregation phase . Tissue factor ( TF ) also known as factor III and thromboplastin , is a membrane - bound procoagulant . TF acts with factor VII as the major in vivo initiator of the coagulation cascade to generate thrombin . Thrombin adheres with circulating Fib and convert into insoluble fibrin by forming a fibrin network . This fibrin network strengthens the initial platelet plug 10 . Platelet aggregation begins once platelets become activated , triggering the GpIIbIIIa receptor ( 50 - 100 / platelets ) , which attach to vWF or Fib . Each activated platelet extends pseudopods , clumping and becoming aggregated . These activations are further heightened by the generation of thrombin via the hemostasis mechanism . Platelet aggregation promotes a primary platelet plug . The ADP receptor interconnects with a family of ADP receptors ( P2Y1 and P2Y12 ) , which could be detected on platelets as helping with aggregation . P2Y1 receptors assist in stimulating the initial platelet shape changes and platelet aggregation . At the same time , P2Y12 is an important mediator for blood clotting . It increases significantly , responding to ADP to complete the aggregation process . Eventually , the formed platelet plug ought to be stabilized by the formation of fibrin 10 , 25 - 28 .

Coagulation mechanism ; Thrombin plays a vital role in generating cross - linked fibrin by cleaving Fib to fibrin and activating several other coagulation factors . Thrombin also modulates other important cellular activities via protease - activated receptors . Simultaneously , it will directly increase the platelet aggregation and the production of TXA2 to express adhesion molecules 29 . Approximately fifty significant substances affect the blood coagulation mechanisms . The blood coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis mainly consists of two main pathways : ( i ) intrinsic ( contact activation pathway ) ( ii ) extrinsic ( TF pathway ) . The blood clotting process can be classified into three important steady steps as follows : ( i ) involvement of a complex cascade , triggering the chemical reactions that are mediated by the coagulation factors that respond to form fibrin strands for consolidating the platelet plugs ; ( ii ) the conversion of prothrombin ( PT ) into thrombin , which is catalyzed by the PT activator ; and ( iii ) conversion of Fib into fibrin , which eventually enmeshes the plasma , platelets and blood cells to build a firmer clot ( Figure 6 ; Table 3 ) 29 - 31 . Extrinsic pathway The newer blood coagulation cascade model was well elaborated in a Jerry B . Lefkowitz . Thrombin was portrayed as the center of the coagulation universe . All the coagulation factors involved in the hemostasis process feed into the regulation and control of thrombin generation , which then forms clots at the sites of vascular injury . Thrombin is a proteolytic enzyme derived from PT , which aids in the process of forming blood clots by catalyzing the conversion of Fib to fibrin . The modified intrinsic coagulation cascade , which displayed in Figure 6 , is different from the older one and lacks the significance of factor XII and prekallikren . Apparently , these proteins are not considered to play a crucial role in the coagulation process in vivo . There are two major processes that could initiate the blood clotting mechanism . They are extrinsic and intrinsic pathways . First , TF binds to factor VII or activated FVIII ( FVIIIa ) in 1 : 1 ratio complex . A limited proteolysis process extends to the TF / FVIIIa complex , which activates factor X or factor IX , further activating factor X / FIX and activating serine proteases via cleaving an activation peptide . Proteolysis is the hydrolysis process that involves the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides . Once the extrinsic pathway is triggered , the activation of factor X / IX in the TF / FVIIa complex is instantly inhibited by the TF pathway inhibitor ( TFPI ) , which is generated from endothelial cells . Freshly activated factor IXa subsequently adheres to its cofactor , factor VIIIa , upon the phospholipid surface to stimulate the tenase complex which results in the activation of factor X to factor Xa . Finally , the common pathway for thrombin activation is initiated via the activation of factor Xa . The activated factor Xa merges with the cofactor , activated factor V ( FVa ) and calcium on the phospholipid surfaces to construct the prothrombinase complex . This complex eventually helps to convert PT to thrombin by cleaving the PT , which is the activation peptide . Thrombin activation will be generated to a very minor extent by the extrinsic pathway , which is adequate and crucial to initiate the coagulation cascade which subsequently Mercy Halleluyah Periayah , et al . IJHOSCR , 1 October . Volume 11 , Number 4 324 International Journal of Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Research ijhoscr . tums . ac . ir triggers and expands thrombin generation via the intrinsic pathway 29 - 30 , 32 . Intrinsic pathway The activation of factor XI to factor XIa , and more thrombin generated via factor IXa and factor VIIIa leads to the activation of factor X , which is involved in the intrinsic pathway . Factors V and VIII , which are partially proteolyzed or activated , are known to be involved in and facilitate the hemostasis process . Subsequently , the activation of factors V and VIII by thrombin triggers more mechanical action of the coagulation pathway by enhancing the bioactivity of tenase and prothrombinase complexes . As described in Table 3 , factor I ( Fib ) plays a crucial role in forming a fibrin clot to seal the injured area with fibrin meshes . Fib typically consists of 3 globular domains , which is the central E domain attached or flanked by two identical D domains . At this stage , thrombin sticks to fibrinopeptides A and B , which are derived from the Aα and Bβ chains , to build a fibrin monomer . These monomers gather into protofibrils in a half - distributed manner , which is stabilized by the non - covalent interactions among fibrin molecules . Eventually , the protofibrils are obliquely organized into dense fibrin networks to form a temporary fibrin clot that is not covalently crosslinked . Nevertheless , to form a stable blood clot , thrombin needs to activate factor XIII to the transglutaminase enzyme activated factor XIIIa . Factor XIIIa will stimulate the glutamic acid and lysine side chains , producing a stable clot . Factor XIIIa is the fibrin stabilizing factor of the blood coagulation system that crosslinks with fibrin . Furthermore , factor XIIIa also plays a significant role towards tissue repair and the angiogenesis process ( Figure 6 ) 29 - 30 , 32 , 35 . Tertiary hemostasis Once the fibrin clot has been formed , the activated platelets will be well organized and take position to contract their intracellular actin or myosin cytoskeleton . The intracellular actin network will directly connect to the integrin GpIIbIIIa and Fib receptor internally . Subsequently , the external component of GpIIbIIIa will adhere to the fibrin network of the blood clot , making the clot compact and decreasing the clot volume slowly , which is called clot retraction . A plasminogen activator is a serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin to promote fibrinolysis by cutting and degrading the fibrin networks . Plasmin slashes off the fibrin meshes formed around the wounded area , resulting in the formation of other circulating fragments that are cleared by other proteases or by the kidney and liver . The clot resolution mechanism helps in clearing the injured and obstructed vessels , regenerating blood flow that is directed to the normal blood flow pathway . GpIIbIIIa disrupts the fibrin binding capacity with platelets and complete the clot resolution process 29 - 30 , 36 - 37 . Wound healing Figure 7 . Wound healing phase . This figure shows one of the important modified paradigm of the wound healing phase , that involves two important mediators ( TGF - β1 and PDGF - AB ) upon the formation of a platelet plug to seal the wound with the aid of a fibrin clot . These signaling molecules are released to initiate the proliferative phase of the wound healing process 39 - 40 . Wound healing is an innate revitalizing response in tissue injuries , and the interaction of the cellular mechanical pathway events results in resurfacing , reconstitution and refurbishment of cells on the injured surface area . The healing process can be explained in three different phases followed by hemostasis , including inflammation , proliferation and maturation 40 . While platelet play its crucial role in clot formation as part of the hemostasis process , the inflammatory cells aid in the inflammatory phase , which is followed by the proliferative phase , consisting of epithelialization , fibroplasia and angiogenesis . In addition , wound healing is also IJHOSCR , 1 October 2017 .

Cytokine is a protein mediator that is released from various cells . They can adhere to the cell surface receptors to trigger cell reactions and play a significant role in the wound healing phase . There are many cytokines responsible for wound healing , but Transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - β1 ) and platelet derived growth factor - AB ( PDGF - AB ) are the main cytokines acting on cell proliferation and maturation . TGF - β1 helps to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and the production of proteoglycans , collagen and fibrin . It is also noted that TGF - β1 assists in decreasing scar formation and preventing inhibition of healing by glucocorticoids . On top of that , TGF - β1 supports the expression of specific cytokines in T cells to promote cell proliferation , especially while the cells still undergo the immature phase 42 - 44 . Meanwhile , PDGF - AB plays a specific role in blood vessel formation , which is addressed as an angiogenesis process . The angiogenesis process involves the growth of blood vessels from the existing blood vessel tissue . This is followed by the proliferation phase . The subsequent maturation phase replaces and remodels the structure of collagen type 3 to type 1 . This maturation phase could last for a year or more than a year , depending on the severity of the wound type ( Figure 7 ) 40 , 43 - 45 , 47 . Mercy Halleluyah Periayah , et al .

Initial platelet adhesion , activation and aggregation upon tissue injury , stimulates coagulation factors and other mediators to achieve hemostasis . In addition , these coordinated events are the vital biological processes towards wound healing upon the tissue damage . The history on the investigation of platelet function began 100 years ago , and has recently become increasingly important for monitoring hemorrhage , antiplatelet activity , platelet dysfunctions and coagulation factors . Understanding the platelet thrombogenicity cascade is very beneficial to reducing the hematological complications . As platelets are remarkable cells that arrest bleeding and circulate within the human body , the search for artificial platelet substitutes should be part of the next attempt or search to decrease platelet - related morbidities and mortalities .
