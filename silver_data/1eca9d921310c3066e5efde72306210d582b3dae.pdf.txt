( Dated : December 30 , 2022 ) Single - molecule localization microscopy can decipher ﬁne details that are otherwise not possible using diﬀraction - limited microscopy . Often the reconstructed super - resolved image contains unwanted noise , random background and is prone to false detections . This cause spurious data that necessitates several trials , multiple experimentations , and repeated preparation of specimens . Moreover , this is not suitable for experiments that require time - lapse imaging and real - time microscopy . To overcome these limitations , we propose a technique ( corrSMLM ) that can recognize and detect fortunate molecules ( molecules with long ﬂuorescence cycles ) from the recorded data . The technique uses correlation between two or more consecutive frames to extract fortunate molecules that blink for longer than the standard blinking time . Accordingly , strongly - correlated spots ( single molecule signatures ) are compared in consecutive frames , followed by data integration ( mean centroid position and the total number of photons ) and estimation of critical parameters ( position and localization precision ) . The technique addresses two major problems that plague SMLM : ( 1 ) random noise due to false detection that contributes to strong background , and ( 2 ) poor localization precision oﬀered by standard SMLM techniques . On the brighter side , corrSMLM allows only fortunate molecules contribute to the super - resolved image , thereby suppressing the background and improving localization precision by a factor of 2 - 4 times as compared to standard SMLM . To substantiate , corrSMLM is used for imaging ﬁxed cell samples ( Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - Tubulin transfected NIH3T3 cells ) . Results show multi - fold reduction in noise and localization precision with a marked improvement in overall resolution and SBR . We anticipate corrSMLM to improve overall image quality and oﬀer a better understanding of single molecule dynamics in cell biology . I . INTRODUCTION In biology , molecules often assemble and arrange in a speciﬁc pattern to perform biological processes . Visualizing these patterns and understanding its arrangement is of utmost importance in fundamental biology and has ramiﬁcations ranging from cell to disease biology . In this respect , single molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) and related microscopy techniques has proven to be a useful tool for unravelling the nanoscopic world of biomolecular complexes . These powerful family of super - resolution techniques have implications in disease biology and clinical health - care [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . Since the classical work of Moerner in the year 1989 and inception of super - resolution microscopy in the subsequent years with the advent of STED , SI and SMLM techniques ( PALM , fPALM and STORM ) , super - resolution imaging has taken a giant step towards unveiling many biological processes at single molecule level [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . Over the years , many variants have emerged that have advanced our understanding of biological processes in a cellular environment . For example , SMLM has revealed the nanoscopic world of macromolecular complexes and its functioning in a cellular environment including , apoptopic pores [ 11 ] , nuclear pore complex [ 12 ] , endocytic machinery [ 13 ] , cytoskeletal structure [ 14 ] and many more . Thereafter , a family of powerful techniques have emerged that has enabled detailed study of molecular complexes in live cells and organs . Recent advances in SMLM such as , POSSIBLE , STED , MINFLUX , dSTORM , SIMPLE and ROSE have shown sub - 10 nm resolution [ 15 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 24 ] . In this regard , the integration of light sheet and super - resolution have shown ∗ Corresponding author : partha @ iisc . ernet . in great promise [ 16 ] . Speciﬁcally , the last decade has seen many variants that have immense potential to advance biology at sub - cellular level including , ground - state depletion microscopy ( GSDIM ) [ 25 ] , super - resolution optical ﬂuctuation imaging ( SOFI ) [ 26 ] , points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography ( PAINT ) [ 27 ] [ 28 ] , simultaneous multiplane imaging - based localization encoded ( SMILE ) [ 29 ] [ 30 ] , individual molecule localization – selective plane illumination microscopy ( IML - SPIM ) [ 16 ] , MINFLUX [ 24 ] , POSSIBLE microscopy [ 15 ] and others [ 31 – 38 ] . LIVE - PAINT has demonstrated imaging a number of diﬀerent peptide binding protein pairs ( TRAP4 - MEEVF and SYNZIP18 - SYNZIP17 ) inside live S . cerevisiae [ 43 ] . IML - SPIM has enabled super - resolution imaging of human mammary MCF10A cell spheroids expressing H2B - PAmCherry [ 16 ] . Multicolor variant such as multicolor STORM imaging of large volumes has enabled ultrathin sectioning of ganglion cells to understand the nanoscale co - organization of AMPA receptors and their spatial correlation [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] . A recent technique primarily based on RESOLFT microscopy have shown 3D imaging of single molecules organization in a cell [ 42 ] . The technique has reported volumetric imaging of exosomes labelled with CD63 - rsEGFP2 in live U2OS cells . Other techniques predominately based on evanescent light such as SMILE has demonstrated volume imaging capabilities in a single cell [ 30 ] . SMLM techniques are in their early stages and the emerging potential variants are expected to reveal fundamental aspects of life in the coming decade . The last few years have seen integration of SPIM techniques with other imaging techniques for enabling studies which ere earlier thought out of reach . IML - SPIM has enabled super - resolution imaging at large ﬁeld - of - view ( FOV ) . Multiphoton super - resolution microscopy . SMILE technique combines the strengths of SMLM and TIRF which facilitated 3D imaging of viral ( Hemaglutinin ) transfected NIH3T3 cells [ 29 ] [ 30 ] . Recently , DNA - PAINT and ﬂuorescence lifetime PAINT ( FL - 2 PAINT ) has demonstrated the capability to image multiple targets simultaneously in a HeLa cell [ 44 ] . Bessel beam STED has shown deep penetration capability that can be used for tissue / organ imaging [ 45 ] . In another application , SMLM is realized using a Bessel beam for illumination towards 3D imaging of nucleoporin Nup153 expressed in HeLa cell nucleus [ 46 ] . Recently developed MINFLUX and MINSTED techniques which is a combination of SMLM and STED has demonstrated imaging of nuclear - pore complex with high spatio - temporal resolution [ 49 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] . But seldom , single molecule techniques have demonstrated the ability to produce high quality images which is primarily due to strong background , sub - optimal sample preparation and large localization precision . Therefore techniques that can overcome these hurdles are highly beneﬁcial to cell biology . Moreover , such techniques are expected to expand the reach of super - resolution technique beyond the capabilities of standard super - resolution microscopy . In this article , we propose a correlation SMLM ( corr − SMLM ) technique that uses correlation of single molecule events to identify fortunate molecules ( bright molecules with large emission cycles ) from consecutive frames of the recorded data . The informations ( emitted photons from correlated single molecules , degree of correlation and number of correlated frames ) are then integrated to determine localization precision , position of the single molecule and other parameters . Results show a multi - fold improvement in the localization precision , and high signal - to - background ratio ( SBR ) which facilitates imaging approaching sub - 10nm regime . II . RESULTS The immense potential of single molecule based super - resolution microscopy can be harnessed only if the quality of reconstructed image improves substantially . Among others , localization precision and signal - to - background ratio ( SBR ) are key properties that are essential for high quality imaging , which becomes the basis for studying biological processes in great detail , thereby helping in deciphering the underlying mechanism . This calls for techniques / methods that are promising and does not require substantial change in system hardware . corrSMLM is one such general technique that can be readily integrated with most of the existing family of super - resolution microscopy techniques . The schematic diagram of the corrSMLM technique / method is shown in FIg . 1 . The optical system used of a standard SMLM microscopy is employed for recording several raw images . Then , the images are processed to isolate the single molecule ( bright spots ) which are then ﬁtted using a 2D Gaussian function ( G ( µ , σ ) = A exp { ( x − µ ) 2 / 2 σ 2 } ) where , µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation , respectively . This is followed by determining the position ( centroid ) and the number of photons . The centroid of extracted single molecules in each frame ( say , n ) are then compared with the single - molecule signatures in the preceding ( frame # n − 1 ) and next frame ( i . e , frame # n + 1 ) . If the centroids are found to lie within the theoretically estimated diﬀraction - limited spot ( r ∼ 1 . 2 λ / 2 NA ) , then the respective Gaussians are correlated . Depending upon the degree of correlation , the single molecule in the consecutive frames are identiﬁed as pair and sorted as shown in the adjoining table ( see , Fig . 1 ) . Subsequently , the parameters are computed for the paired molecules . Since fortunate molecule emit for longer duration i . e , detectable in more than one consecutive frames they can be identiﬁed as a single molecule [ 50 ] . These elusive molecules has a PAR - shift towards single molecule limit , and thus have a better localization . The other beneﬁt is the elimination of false detections ( recognized as noise ) which pops - in due to other reasons ( detector read noise , intensity ﬂuctuations , thermal noise etc . ) . Finally , the informations related to position and total number of detected photons are then used for reconstructing the single molecule map / super - resolved image . To access the potential of corrSMLM , two diﬀerent specimens are used . We have used NIH3T3 cells and super - resolved two diﬀerent organelles : Actin ﬁlaments and Tubulin skeletal system in a cell . To image actin ﬁlaments , cells with a passage number of 14 were thawn and supplemented with cell medium . The cells were then cultured for two more passages to ascertain its healthy growth . Finally , the cells were prepared for transfection following standard protocol and ﬁxed . The details related to cell culture and materials used are discussed in Ref . [ 3 ] . In the ﬁrst experiment , Dendra2 - Actin plasmid DNAs was used to transfect NIH3T3 cells . Subsequently , data / images are recorded by the camera at an exposure time of 33 ms and EM gain of 274 . An estimated 49 , 020 images are recorded for reconstructing standard SMLM image as shown in Fig . 2 . Subsequently , the images are correlated for 2 , 3 and 4 successive frames . This is necessary to recognize fortunate molecules with long blinking time . The super - resolved image for corrSMLM is then reconstructed as shown in Fig . 2 . In addition , another super - resolved image is reconstructed for 2 - 4 frames that combine all the single molecules detected for 2 , 3 , and 4 frames . It becomes immediately evident that , correlated images are free from background noise , and there is a marked improvement in single molecule localization ( decreased values of average localization precision as shown in Fig . 2B ) . This is possible due to the detection of fortunate molecules that have a better blinking period . The eﬀect is clearly evident from the resolved actin ﬁlaments , and suppression of background noise . Another important aspect of single molecule imaging is the number of molecule that contribute to the ﬁnal super - resolved image . The down - side of corrSMLM is probably the small number of fortunate molecules that represent the ﬁnal image . Fig . 2C clearly indicates that there is a decrease in fortunate molecules that blink for longer time . This of - course reduces background and improves single molecule localization , but substantially reduces the number statistics ( the number of single molecules ) for acceptable super - resolved image . The other aspect of corrSMLM is the degree of correlation with which two molecules can be recognized as a single - molecule blinking for longer duration ( referred as pair - molecule / fortunate molecule ) . To ascertain , super - resolved images are reconstructed using fortunate molecules recognized by correlation factor ( χ ) of > 0 . 7 , > 0 . 8 and > 0 . 9 as shown in Fig . 3A . Alongside standard SMLM image is also shown for comparison . Although the number of molecules for reconstructed image with χ > 0 . 9 is less than χ > 0 . 7 and 3 Fig 1 – Schematic Diagram D M M 1 EMCCDcamera Recorded Data and parameter estimation CorrSMLM Protocol d ! ! , # , ! ! , # $ % < # ! , # for all consecutive frames compute , find , corr ! ! , # , ! ! , # $ % > ! & identify pairs , say , ! ! , # , ! ! , # $ % combine pair parameters , $ % = ∑ % , $ ! = ! reconstruct image ( use , $ % , $ ! ) 405 nm 561 nm Recording Data Spot Detection & Parameter Estimation Loc .

A graphical representation of corrSMLM and related key steps ( optical and computation ) . The steps involve , spot detection , recognizing and sorting fortunate molecules , correlating Gaussians ( single molecule signatures ) in consecutive frames , computing updated parameters ( localization precision , position and number of emitted photons ) , and ﬁnally , reconstructing the corrSMLM image . χ > 0 . 8 , key features are well preserved . The corresponding mean localization precision for all χ - values are also plotted in Fig . 3B . This consistently show better localization of single molecules with large blinking time and the fact that localization precision is not strongly dependent on the degree of correlation . This overall suggests that the proposed technique’s ability to accurately recognize single molecules with long blinking period . To strengthen our technique and additional validation , we considered another specimen where the cells are transfected with Dendra2 - Tubulin plasmid DNA . A protocol similar to that of ﬁrst sample ( Dendra2 - Actin transfected cell ) is followed and the cell is ﬁxed for imaging . Fig . 3 shows reconstructed images at varying blinking times and correlation factors , along with the localization precision . We observed a similar trend to that of ﬁrst sample . It is clear that quality super - resolved image can be reconstructions with all molecules that blink for 2 - 4 frames . Alongside , mean localization precision with # frames / blinking time is also shown . It is evident that corrSMLM has the advantage of better number statistics , higher localization and an overall better SBR when compared to standard SMLM . A separate experiment is carried out for comparing corrSMLM and standard SMLM . Fig . 5 ( A , B ) shows 4 Fig . 3 - Actin – Scheme ( corrSMLM ) M e a n L o c . P r e c .

The corresponding region - of - interest is marked ( red and yellow boxes ) . Alongside , standard SMLM and corrSMLM ( χ = 0 . 7 ) ( combined , 2 - 4 frames ) super - resolved images for the ROIs are also shown in Fig . 5 . It is evident that , corrSMLM images are far superior than standard SMLM both in terms of background and resolution . To substantiate the resolving power of corrSMLM , we have carried out line intensity plots across actin - ﬁlaments which shows a reduction in the FWHM of actin - ﬁlaments by a factor of ∼ 2 . In addition , we have counted the number of molecules that represent the actin ﬁlaments and background molecules in between the ﬁlaments . It is evident from the signal - to - background ratio ( measured in terms of number of molecules ) between two actin - ﬁilaments have reduced substantially when compared to standard SMLM ( see , Fig . 5 ) . This suggests overall better resolution and signal - to - background ratio for corrSMLM . All the ﬁndings related to corrSMLM are incorporated in tabular form as shown in Fig . 6 . The performance of corrSMLM depends on few key factors such as , correlation factor , the number of correlated frames and the total number of molecules . These parameters determine the position , # photons per molecule , localization precision , and signal to background molecules . Two organelles are probed using Dendra2 photo - activable protein . It is observed that , localization of single molecules have improved by a factor of ∼ 2 i . e , mean localization precision is nearly - halved as compared to standard SMLM . This is closely linked to the number of emitted photons associated with the number of molecules . On the other hand , the signal - to - background ratio ( measured in terms of # molecules ) increased nearly 1 . 5 times . Also the number of molecules necessary to represent an organelle structure ( here , actin ﬁlament and tubulin network ) have decreased by an order . This is predominantly due to the fact that number of molecules representing background / noise / false detections have reduced by corrSMLM . Overall , the beneﬁts oﬀers by corrSMLM over standard SMLM are note - worthy and useful for quality imaging . 5 Fig . 4 - TUBULIN - Centroid Based Correlation n rendered = 15249 n rendered = 2404 n rendered = 685 n rendered = 290 n rendered = 3379 n rendered = 3193 n rendered = 2288 n rendered = 15972 n rendered = 637 n rendered = 268 n rendered = 17846 n rendered = 2011 n rendered = 522 n rendered = 185 n rendered = 2718 M e a n L o c .

Alongside localization precisions are also shown . Scale bar = 1 µm . Discussions A correlation - based single molecule super - resolution microscopy ( corrSMLM ) is demonstrated . The technique relies on the fact that fortunate molecules ( molecules with long blinking period ) stay - on for more than single data acquisition frame in SMLM , and if these elusive ﬂuorescence events ( related to fortunate molecules ) are recorded , then the localization precision and signal - to - background ratio can be substantially improved . It appears that most of the genuine signal molecules are organelle speciﬁc and a fraction of these can blink for longer periods . This is unlike the background molecules or false detections that most likely get captured in single frame and are not likely to repeat in consecutive frames . Thereby , elimination of these spurious events and retaining the genuine events result in better image quality . Single molecule experiments are performed in cellular systems following biological protocols ( cell culture , transfection and ﬁxing ) to access the beneﬁts of corrSMLM . We noted that plasmid DNA transfected cells express photoactivable protein ( Dendra2 - Actin / Dendra2 - Tubulin ) that are most likely located to the speciﬁc organelle ( such as , actin ﬁlaments and tubulin network ) . Any other events ( representing single molecules ) are most likely due to noise ( intensity ﬂuctuation or false detections ) , background and detector ineﬃciencies ( read / thermal noise ) . When two or more consecutive frames are correlated these noises are ﬁltered out , thereby retaining only the genuine molecules . Hence , the resultant reconstructed images are free from background . This is quite evident from Fig . 2 and Fig . 4 . Another important aspect of corrSMLM is the correlation factor ( taken between 0 . 7 to 0 . 9 ) for which the corresponding reconstructed super - resolved image appears to represent the 6 Fig 5 – Comparison – 1 , 2 , 3 & SMLM n rendered = 10261 Corr - SMLM ( = 0 . 7 ( 2 - 4 frames ) 10 µm 5 µm SMLM NIH 3 T 3 cells Actin # m o l e c u l e s I n t e n s i t y ( a u ) L1 10 µm 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 50 100 150 200 250 L1 Corr - SMLM SMLM Corr - SMLM SMLM 10 µm 5 µm n rendered = 25130 Corr - SMLM SMLM n rendered = 3379 Tubulin NIH 3 T 3 cells 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 100 200 300 400 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 0 100 200 300 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 # m o l e c u l e s I n t e n s i t y ( a u ) L2 ( = 0 . 7 ( 2 - 4 frames ) L2 L1 L2 L2 L1 L1 L2 L2 L1 ( A ) ( B ) FIG . 5 : Comparison of corrSMLM and standard SMLM reconstructed images The wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence image of Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - Tubulin transfected cells are also shown .

This is encouraging since this emboldens the fact that there is a strong correlation of few single molecule events in successive recorded frames . Finally , the proposed corrSMLM technique is compared with the standard SMLM . Analysis show improvement in resolution and signal to background molecules when investigated using line intensity plots across actin ﬁlament and tubulin structures ( see , Fig . 5 ) . This directly impacts resolution and overall image quality . Speciﬁc analysis of key aspects suggests the beneﬁts of corrSMLM over SMLM in terms of mean localization precision , signal - to - background ratio ( # Mol ) among others . With all the beneﬁts and non - requirement of additional hardware , corrSMLM is expected to advance localization based super - resolution microscopy .
