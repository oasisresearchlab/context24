Although the abundance of certain three - node motifs , such as the feed - forward loop , is positively correlated with a networks’ ability to tolerate moderate disruptions to gene expression , little is known regarding the connectivity of individual genes participating in multiple motifs . Using the transcriptional network of the bacterium Escherichia coli , we investigate this feature by reconstructing the distribution of genes par - ticipating in feed - forward loop motifs from its largest connected network component . We contrast these motif participation distributions with those obtained from model networks built using the preferential attachment mechanism employed by many biological and man - made networks . We report that , although some of these model networks support a motif participation distribution that appears qualitatively similar to that obtained from the bac - terium E . coli , the probability for a node to support a feed - forward loop motif may instead be strongly inﬂuenced by only a few master transcriptional regulators within the network . From these analyses we conclude that such master regulators may be a crucial ingredient to describe coupling among feed - forward loop motifs in transcriptional regulatory networks . Keywords : generegulatorynetworks , feed - forwardloopmotif , complexnetworks , preferentialattachmentnetwork models , motif centrality INTRODUCTION Many natural and engineered systems can be expressed as net - works of nodes connected by links , such as interacting genes or communicatingsensormotes . Forbiologicalsystems , autonomous processes drive formation and maintenance of these networks , such as evolutionary pressures on genetic networks ( Crombach and Hogeweg , 2008 ) . Genetic networks are particularly interest - ing , because they are known to tolerate noise in gene expression ( Prill et al . , 2005 ) , an ability termed robustness ( e . g . , see , Kitano , 2004 and references therein ) . Moreover , it was discovered that genetic networks host repeating patterns of smaller subnetworks , termed motifs ( Shen - Orr et al . , 2002 ) , that occur far more fre - quently than would be expected in randomized networks with the same degree sequence . These patterns are thought to be the basic building blocks of complex networks ( Milo et al . , 2002 ) . While much attention has been directed toward the study of their indi - vidual functions , both experimentally ( e . g . , autoregulatory motifs Wu and Rao , 2010 ) and theoretically ( Magnan and Alon , 2003 ) , much less is known relating their coupling and positions within the network to its robustness . Feed - forward loops are one of the most common motifs in genetic networks and are well studied in a variety of biological contexts . In a genetic network , if one gene is linked to another , then it may either enhance or repress the expression level of the target gene , respectively termed up - and down - regulation . A feed - forward loop consists of three genes or nodes , the ﬁrst of which regulates a second , and both of these co - regulate a third ( Figure 1 ) . Recently , Alon and collaborators ( Magnan and Alon , 2003 ) discovered that individual feed - forward loops possess interesting dynamical properties , such as signal delay and pulse generation . Although it is not generally clear how coupling among these motifs affects the overall network function , several groups are beginning to move in this direction . For example , exhaus - tive experiments with the bacterium Escherichia coli ( herein E . coli ) , in which 598 gene promoters were altered to “rewire” its genetic network , showed that most of these new connections are tolerated by the bacteria ( Isalan et al . , 2008 ) . Mathematical mod - eling of gene transcription and translation has also been used to investigate the relationship between coupling and function among differing motif conﬁgurations ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Kwon and Cho , 2008 ; Wu and Rao , 2010 ) . However , a requisite for using these results to understand complex features at the network level , such as robustness , is a more basic understanding of how motifs are coupled together and distributed throughout such transcriptional networks . Here we begin to address this problem by measuring the par - ticipation of individual genes in each feed - forward loop of the genetic network of the bacterium E . coli . We use computational methods to count the number of unique motifs in which a single gene participates , for all genes in the network . To aid in the inter - pretation of these motif participation distributions , we contrast them with those arising from model networks built using a prefer - ential attachment scheme , employing both linear and non - linear attachment kernels ( Krapivsky et al . , 2000 ) .

Motif participation in E . coli networks i j k l m FIGURE 1 | Genes of feed - forward loops ( open circles ) may be connected by the participation of common genes . motif participation distributions contains valuable information that allows us to quantify the extent to which feed - forward loops couple to the whole - network . MATERIALS AND METHODS PARTICIPATION OF GENES IN MOTIFS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT A NETWORK Here we consider the transcriptional regulatory network of the bacterium E . coli as a prototypical genetic network , by which we mean that genes interact with one another when transcription products affect the transactivation of other“target”genes by inter - acting with their promoter regions . Not only are all connections among genes in E . coli ’s genetic network well validated by exper - iments ( e . g . , see . Shen - Orr et al . , 2002 ) , but these data are also easily sampled using the software tool GeneNetWeaver ( Schaffter et al . , 2011 ) , ﬁrst introduced to aid the development of more accu - rate gene regulatory network inference algorithms . E . coli ’s genetic network supports 23 disjoint subnetworks that together form a network of 1565 genes and 3758 links , and it is not completely connected . Based on this observation we restrict our analyses to its largest connected component ( LCC ) , which is sparse , supporting 1477 genes and 3671 directed links . For each gene in the LCC of this genetic network , we count how many feed - forward loop motifs a gene participates in as one of its three elements , illustrated as nodes i , j , or k in Figure 1 . The software tool mFINDER ( Milo et al . , 2002 ) was used here to iden - tify feed - forward patterns in the network , independent of whether one gene up - or down - regulates another . So we did not distinguish between , for example , coherentand incoherent feed - forwardloops in the counting procedure . Motifs were compared to one another to ensure that they were only counted once for each gene . These steps were repeated for the model networks built from procedures described below . DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR GROWING NETWORKS Because E . coli ’s LCC is a directed network , it supports two distinct distributions that together describe the total - degree distribution . For a network of n nodes , these are ( i ) the fraction of the network hosting K - many outgoing links , p ( K , R , n ) , termed the out - degree distribution , and ( ii ) the fraction of the network hosting R - many incoming links , q ( K , R , n ) , termed the in - degree distribution . The growth of several man - made or technological networks , such as citation , internet , actor , and scientiﬁc co - authorship net - works has been measured before ( Jeong et al . , 2003 ) , and their growth was modeled by a scheme that adds links to new nodes in a way that depends on the degree of a candidate node of the existing network – a mechanism for network evolution termed prefer - ential attachment ( Barabási and Albert , 1999 ) . Although these man - made networks have been observed to “grow” according to preferential attachment , gene networks in E . coli and other organ - isms may instead evolve in response to environmental stressors realized as horizontal gene transfers ( Pál et al . , 2005 ) or gene dupli - cation events ( Lagomarsino et al . , 2007 ) . While these and other mechanisms may indeed drive transcriptional network growth , it remains unclear what role they play in the creation and persis - tence of genetic motifs . Because preferential attachment offers a simpliﬁed view of network growth and has been relatively well studied , we employ it here to develop formulas for the creation of directed networks , wherein the network evolution is determined by an attachment kernel taking one of several forms explained below , either linear , power - law , or sigmoid types . Consider a network of n nodes , wherein each of its nodes labeled by the subscript i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n hosts K i outgoing links and R i incoming links . A randomized network is grown by adding nodes one at a time , increasing its size by exactly one node during each round of attachment ( also termed a simulation step ) . These “new” nodes are attached to the existing network by an average of m directed links to“candidate”nodes of the network , chosen with equal probability among all existing network nodes . The probabil - ity for an edge to link a candidate node i with the new one directed from the candidate to the new one is generally given by A ( K i , R i ) , wherein K i and R i label the out - and in - degrees of the candidate node , respectively . The probability for a link to be drawn from the new node to a candidate node i is similarly given by B ( K i , R i ) . These probabilities are normalized against all nodes of the exist - ing network , and are termed attachment kernels ( Krapivsky et al . , 2000 ) . The number of nodes in the existing network with degree K can be written as np ( K , n ) mA ( K ) , wherein p and A are assumed to be independent of the nodes’ in - degree R . Using this expression , a master equation may be written that describes the evolution of this out - degree distribution : ( n + 1 ) p ( K , n + 1 ) − np ( K , n ) = np ( K − 1 , n ) mA ( K − 1 ) − np ( K , n ) mA ( K ) , ( 1 ) Frontiers in Physiology | Fractal Physiology September 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 357 | 2 Mayo et al . Motif participation in E . coli networks Equation 1 holds for all cases except K = m , which describes the links extending from the new node to the existing network . For this case we have ( n + 1 ) p ( m , n + 1 ) − np ( m , n ) = 1 − np ( m , n ) mA ( m ) . ( 2 ) Equations 1 and 2 are difﬁcult to solve exactly . In light of this difﬁculty we instead simulated the growth algorithm directly using computational means using attachment kernels listed in Table 1 , and described by the algorithm given below . Nevertheless , by using suitable approximations for Eqs 1 and 2 we can infer a general form for the degree distribution ; however , the exact relationship reﬂecting the frequency of degrees observed for network nodes depends strongly on the speciﬁc form of the attachment kernel , as demonstrated here . By taking an approximation valid for very large networks , n →∞ , we can solve for the degree distribution near this lim - iting value . Here we label p ( K , ∞ ) = p ( K ) , so that ( n + 1 ) p ( K , n + 1 ) − np ( K , n ) ∼ p ( K ) . Then , Eqs 1 and 2 become ( Newman , 2010 ) p ( K ) = np ( K − 1 ) mA ( K − 1 ) − np ( K ) mA ( K ) , and ( 3 ) p ( m ) = 1 − np ( m ) mA ( m ) . ( 4 ) As shown in the appendix , Eqs 3 and 4 can be solved to give p ( K ) = 1 nmA ( K ) e − K (cid:80) i = m 1 / nmA ( i ) , ( 5 ) wherein the attachment kernel is “small , ” i . e . , for A ( K ) > 1 / nm . Equation 5 can be further reduced when the actual dependence of A ( or B ) on the out - or in - degrees is known ( for an example , refer to the Appendix ) . ALGORITHM TO GENERATE MODEL NETWORKS Synthetic networks are grown step - wise according to the following protocol . First , a candidate node , denoted by subscript i here , is chosen randomly with equi - probability from the existing network of size n . Next , a link directed from the candidate node to the new one is drawn if a number selected at random from an equi - probable distribution on the interval d ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) generally satisﬁes d ≤ A ( K i , R i ) . This process is then repeated for a link to be drawn from the new node to the candidate , wherein a newly drawn ran - domnumberfromthissamedistributioninsteadgenerallysatisﬁes d ≤ B ( K i , R i ) These steps were repeated m i − 1 times , wherein m i Table 1 | Normalized attachment kernels used to create the model networks .

( 6 ) Parameters here are chosen so that ρ ( m i = m 0 ) / ρ ( m i = 1 ) = f , with the values f = 1 / 4 and m 0 varied for creation of the model networks between 2 , 3 , and 4 , which skews the distribution toward larger values of average m i . The average number of links chosen per growth step , m , is given in terms of these parameters as m = ∞ (cid:88) m i = 1 m i ρ ( m i ) = 1 1 − f 1 / ( m 0 − 1 ) . So , in view of this expression the average number of links supported by model networks built using m i = 2 , 3 , and 4 is approximately m = 1 . 33 , 2 , and 2 . 7 , respectively . The form of this distribution of link enumerations , Eq . 6 , was chosen partly because the majority of E . coli ’s genes support only 1 or 2 links , rather than many more . Computer experiments using other link distributions , such as m i = constant , generated motif participation distributions in greater variance with the E . coli dis - tributions than generated using Eq . 6 ( data not shown here ) . We note that model networks were built over a“seed”network of eight nodes fully connected supporting 42 links . This ensures that early in the growth process , when the network is “small , ” it is much less likely for values of m i to force the creation of duplicate links . That is , more than one link of the same direction connecting two nodes is not permitted . CHOICE OF THE ATTACHMENT KERNELS As evidenced by Eq . 5 , the dependence of the attachment ker - nel on the degree determines the ultimate shape of the in - or out - degree distribution . In a celebrated publication ( Barabási and Albert , 1999 ) , Barabási and Albert demonstrated how a variation of the “Matthew effect” – the idea that already - famous individu - als are awarded credit disproportionately ( Merton , 1968 ) – can be employed to generate model networks presenting power - law tails in their degree distributions . In the attachment kernel formal - ism of evolving networks ( Krapivsky et al . , 2000 , 2003 ; Krapivsky and Redner , 2001 ) , the Barabási – Albert model is equivalent to an attachment kernel that is linear in the node degree . Because it is well known that E . coli supports degree distributions presenting similar power - law type distributions ( Shen - Orr et al . , 2002 ) we employ it here to generate model networks . Until recently , network evolution was investigated primarily by studying the growth of model networks possessing qualities sim - ilar to biological and technological ( i . e . , man - made ) networks . While direct study of growth regarding some networks , such as the internet ( e . g . , Pastor - Satorras et al . , 2001 ) , has been conducted on a limited scale by measuring properties at discrete time points , only recently has a direct measurement of the attachment kernel been made as the network continues to grow . Building on previous works ( Newman , 2001 ; Barabási et al . , 2002 ) , Jeong et al . ( 2003 ) inferred the form of these kernels by employing a best ﬁt statistical method to the network of co - authorship among scientists working www . frontiersin . org September 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 357 | 3 Mayo et al . Motif participation in E . coli networks in neuroscience ( between the years 1991 and 1998 ) ; the citation network between published papers in the journal Physical Review Letters beginning from the year 1998 ; a collaboration network among actors appearing in the same movie and debuting between 1920 and 1940 and continuing through to 1993 ; ﬁnally , to the internet beginning with the year 1997 . While it is clear that these networks do not all grow identically , e . g . , actors die or retire while citation records remain immutable , all of these networks were found to grow according to preferential attachment . In particu - lar , attachment kernels for these networks are well described with a power - law of exponent ∼ 1 ( internet and citation networks ) or ∼ 0 . 8 ( actor and collaboration networks ) . While we consider net - work models using the former kernel by using the Barabási – Albert model of ( directed ) linear preferential attachment as described above , we additionally use here model networks built using power - law kernels with exponent 0 . 8 to contrast the motif participation networks derived from E . coli . Data supporting these results has been recently reported to arise in networks of Wikipedia pages ( Capocci et al . , 2006 ) . It is possible for evolved networks to have been created dynam - ically according to preferential attachment under evolutionary conditions – a conclusion based on data obtained from protein - interaction networks of yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) evolving under gene duplication events ( Eisenberg and Levanon , 2003 ; Wagner , 2003 ; Berg et al . , 2004 ) . So , preferential attachment lead - ingtopower - lawtypenetworksmayprovideareasonablemodelof network growth over such long time scales . We explore the impli - cations of a strongly non - linear attachment kernel on network growth , which we consider to be proportional to the ratio of either the out - degree or the in - degree to a nodes’total - degree : K / ( K + R ) or R / ( K + R ) , respectively . Under this hypothesis , nodes have a tendency to support incoming or outgoing edges relative to its total - degree , which is a manifestly local feature of these nodes . As an example , we note that sigmoid type growth kinetics are ubiqui - tous throughout biochemical networks , commonly used to model the yield of enzyme - mediated reactions that create or degrade biomolecules . PROBABILITY FOR A NODE TO PARTICIPATE IN A FEED - FORWARD LOOP Asshownintheappendix , thenumberof feed - forwardloopmotifs that a node with K outgoing links and R incoming links supports is proportional to the probability that a node participates in a feed - forward loop motif , p motif ( K , R ) , which is given by the following formula ( Eq . A13 of the Appendix ) : p motif ( K , R ) = p ( K ) q ( R ) n 2 L 3 (cid:2) K 2 (cid:10) R 2 (cid:11) (cid:104) KR (cid:105) + R 2 (cid:10) K 2 (cid:11) (cid:104) KR (cid:105) + KR (cid:10) K 2 (cid:11) (cid:10) R 2 (cid:11)(cid:3) . ( 7 ) Note that Eq . 7 is a function of K and R , and cannot be directly compared to the result of the motif counting procedure directly , which relates how many nodes host a particular number of motifs . MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS Many features of interest in biology when subjected to repeated measurement show a cumulative probability distribution that fol - lows power - law type mathematical relationship ( Clauset et al . , 2009 ) . For reasons discussed above , the in - , out - , or total - degree distributions of a network may support a power - law type tail depending on the form of the attachment kernel used to build it ( e . g . , Eq . 5 ) . However if there are no a priori theoretical consid - erations to predict whether experimental data should best ﬁt to a particular distribution , then curve - ﬁtting methodologies are com - monly used to justify empirical relationships among features in these data . It is known , for example , that using a least squares based optimizationalgorithmdoesnotaccuratelydeterminewhetherthedataarepower - law distributed ( Hoogenboom et al . , 2006 ; Clauset et al . , 2009 ) . Addressing this problem , Hoogenboom et al . ( 2006 ) presented a maximum likelihood estimation based approach that determines whether data are power - law distributed or not . For illustration , let p ( K ; γ ) be an out - degree distribution function that depends on a parameter γ , such as p ( K ; γ ) ∼ K − γ . A likelihood function is then deﬁned from this distribution so that L ( γ ) = (cid:81) K p ( K ; γ ) . To ﬁnd the parameter γ that best ﬁts the experimental data , this likelihood function is maximized with respect to it . To carry out these analy - ses on the motif participation and degree distributions extracted from the experimental and synthetic networks described above , we employed MATLAB implementations of the maximum likelihood estimation method of Hoogenboom et al . as described by Clauset et al . ( 2009 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION CUMULATIVE DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative degree distributions of one rep - resentative network generated computationally using the attach - ment kernels listed in Table 1 for varying distributions of the link enumeration as given by Eq . 6 , contrasted against the associ - ated distributions arising from the E . coli network ( black circles ) . Straight lines are the result of the maximum likelihood estimation of the validity of a power - law ﬁt to these cumulative distributions , p ( degree ≥ K ) , which measures , for example , the probability that observation of the out - degree for any network node is greater than K . Thecumulativedistributionisrelatedtothedegreedistribution , p ( K ) , by the equation p (cid:0) degree ≥ K (cid:1) = ∞ (cid:88) i = K p ( i ) . ( 8 ) Similar equations exist relating in and total - degree distributions to their associated cumulative distributions . In , out , and total cumulative degree distributions arising from the linear attachment kernel are displayed here in Figures 2A – C . Notably , scaling exponents for power - law type equations ﬁt to these distributions , such as p ( degree ≥ K ) ∼ K α , do not differ greatly between m 0 = 2 , 3 , or 4 ; exponents are collected for m 0 = 2 networks ( cyan in Figure 2 ) into Table 2 . A point - wise inspection of the cumulative total - degree distribution over its whole domain K + R , however , closelyresemblesthatfor E . coli ( Figure2C ) , while the cumulative in - and out - degree distributions do not match qualitatively with E . coli very well . This observation is consistent with power - law ( Figures 2D – F ) and sigmoidal ( Figures 2G – I ) attachment kernel constructed networks .

As expected , when more links are added ( e . g . , m 0 = 4 ) the dis - tributions illustrated in Figure 2 are shifted more toward the right , demonstrating that nodes of such networks support larger degrees merelybecausethedensityof linkshasincreased . Theformof these distributions remains similar , however , appearing to be mostly independent of the choice of m 0 . For example , in networks built using the linear ( Figures 2A – C ) and power - law ( Figures 2D – F ) attachment kernels , a plateau arises in the cumulative distribution that persists across a decade or so in each degree type . This plateau describes a region in the degree ( i . e . , x - axes of Figure 2 ) for which there is constant probability that a measurement of a node’s degree gives a greater value than the considered one . Given the deﬁnition of the cumulative distribution , Eq . 8 , the existence of the plateaus mean the degree distributions for the model power - law networks are bimodal , with a longer plateau indicative of a longer span in the degree between maxima of the degree distribution . The cumulative total - degree distribution for E . coli , illustrated by black circles Figures 2C , F , I , begins to moderately vary from the power - law ﬁt obtained from the maximum likelihood estimation method ( black line ) at approximately K + R = 20 , lasting until approximately K + R = 200 . This variance is not strictly indica - tive of a plateau , but does hint that power - law - type factors may be ingredients in the evolutionary pressures leading to the shape of the ﬁnal transcriptional network distribution . Interestingly , pref - erential attachment mechanisms have indeed been suggested for this purpose yielding scale - free protein - interaction networks ( see , www . frontiersin . org September 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 357 | 5 Mayo et al .

It was also shown that highly connected genes evolve more slowly ( and are therefore older ) than their loosely connected peers and that co - expressed genes evolve at similar rates ( Jordan et al . , 2004 ) . ( There are , however , exceptions to this conclusion in the case of protein - interaction networks , e . g . , Kunin et al . , 2004 . ) These data suggest preferential attachment contributes to transcriptional network evolution , lending weight to our conclusion that a moderate departure from scale - free topol - ogyobservedinthe E . coli ( Figures2C , F , I ) cumulativetotal - degree distribution data is consistent with a power - law - type preferential attachment growth mechanism . However , the reason even minor bimodality should present in the E . coli transcriptional network topology remains unknown . PARTICIPATION OF E . COLI GENES IN FEED - FORWARD LOOP MOTIFS Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative motif participation distribu - tions for networks constructed using each of the three attachment kernels : linear ( Figure 3A ) , power - law ( Figure 3B ) , and sigmoid ( Figure 3C ) . As with the distributions of Figure 2 , scaling expo - nents for these motif participation distributions are also collected into Table 2 . Asthenumberof motifsassociatedwithanode , µ , increases , the probability that a node will host a greater number of such motifs decreasesforallnetworks ( Figures3A – C ) – aresultconsistentwith the E . coli data ( depicted with black circles ) . As expected , when more links are added on average per growth step ( i . e . , increasing m 0 ) , or more generally as the network density increases , feed - forwardloopmotifsaremorelikelytobecreatedbytheattachmentprocedure . This is the reason these cumulative motif participation distributions mostly shift toward the right in Figures 3A – C with increasing m 0 . While differences between the cumulative distri - bution scaling exponents for these representative networks built using m 0 = 2 and E . coli ’s motif participation distribution are the largest of any m 0 values considered here , these m 0 = 2 networks nevertheless more closely resemble the overall E . coli motif distri - bution . Of these , the m 0 = 2 network of Figure 3A provides the closest match to the E . coli data for the kernels considered here .

This quantity can be computed directly from the degree distributions of the net - works we have considered here , which is given by Eq . 7 above . So , for any given pair of in - and out - degrees , Eq . 7 returns the prob - ability that a node will not only possess those values , but will also participate in a feed - forward loop motif , playing the part of any of its three nodes i , j , or k ( as depicted in Figure 1 ) .

Distributions so scaled are denoted by ˜ p motif ( K , R ) . Measured in this way , it is clear that the motif structure of E . coli ( Figure 4A ) is qualitatively very different from that of the model networks ( Figures 4B – D ) , in direct contrast to the similarity observed between the motif participation distributions illustrated in Figure 3 . For E . coli , the probability to ﬁnd a motif in the network is greatest for larger values of R ( but smaller val - ues of K ) . This feature may arise because nodes possessing larger degrees will be more strongly coupled with the rest of the net - work . In this view , a higher density network is favorable because it is more abundant in motifs . However , this explanation cannot be the whole story , because the maximum probability occurs also when K is minimal . This asymmetry between the inﬂuence of the out - and in - degrees on the motif probability suggests that biological mech - anisms driving the evolution of the degree distributions are them - selves asymmetric , favoring one over the other . One way for this to occur is if genes are more frequently regulated than are actively regulating other genes . Such“master regulators”are known to exist in the E . coli network ( Babu and Teichmann , 2002 ) . In view of this evidence , in - degrees should be more frequent within the network ; however , if most genes are not actively regulating other ones , then there are many more combinations of genes with high in - degree but low out - degree . A consequence of this regulatory strategy is that genes with higher in - degree but lower out - degree are more likely to participate in a feed - forward loop motif – a result that may be responsible for the global maximum at small K but large R in Figure 4A . This “regulatory asymmetry” is not an ingredient in the model networks , which treat the building of the in - and out - degrees equally because the form of the attachment kernels is the same for both in - and out - degree distributions . This fact manifests as the symmetry observed in the motif probability distributions shown in Figures 4B – D . Especially interesting is the existence of a global minimum at values intermediate to the minimum and maximum out - and in - degrees of model networks built using linear and power - law type attachment kernels ( Figures 4B , C ) . The global minimum observed at intermediate values of K and R in Figures 4B , C results from the bimodality of the power - law type cumulative in - and out - degree distributions ( Figures 2A – F ) , because these plateaus describe a local minima in the degree distributions . However , networks built using sigmoid type attach - ment kernels ( Figure 4D ) exhibit no such distinctive plateaus ( Figures 2G – I ) . Indeed the global minimum of the motif proba - bility distribution for the sigmoid based preferential attachment network ( Figure 4D ) occurs at maximum K and R , which might result directly from the attachment kernel : nodes with many in - degrees ( larger R ) , which are already rare ( Figure 2G ) , may be less likely to also support many out - degrees ( larger K ) , and therefore be unlikely to support the links necessary to form a www . frontiersin . org September 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 357 | 7 Mayo et al .

In this case , the more loosely connected nodes stand the best chance of participating in a feed - forward loop motif merely because they are more likely to acquire both in - and out - degrees during the preferential attachment process . MOTIF PARTICIPATION CENTRALITY AND MODULARITY The idea that a gene of a transcriptional network can be ordered according to its motif participation suggests that we may also use these distributions as a way to deﬁne a measure of their network centrality . Following ideas introduced by Koschützki et al . ( 2007 ) , Koschützki and Schreiber ( 2008 ) , we deﬁne here motif centrality as the number of motifs associated with a gene . The motif partic - ipation distributions are then used to obtain a sequential ranking for each gene in the LCC of E . coli ’s transcriptional network . Ranking genes according to their feed - forward loop motif par - ticipation reveals that ﬁve E . coli genes support greater than 300 feed - forward loop motifs , while the majority of genes are mostly insulated from the network by participating in just a few feed - forward loop motifs . The top ﬁve genes are listed in Table 3 , and we ﬁnd they are all transcription factors , with the single exception of one receptor . This result supports the idea that only a few mas - ter regulators are in feed - forward loop motifs within the E . coli transcriptional network . We note that the 6th gene in this motif - participation hierarchy , arcA , participates in approximately 50 % of the number of motifs of the 5th gene , ﬁs : 163 , and serves as a natural cutoff between the top - ranked genes and the rest of the network . Whilewehavenotexaminedtheclusteringrelationshipsamong the motifs themselves , it is already known that feed - forward loops do not exist in isolation in the E . coli transcriptional network , but rather exist within modules of higher motif density and connec - tivity through overlapping genes composing these motifs ( Dobrin et al . , 2004 ) . Because Figure 3 demonstrates that only a few genes disproportionately support many motifs , while many genes sup - port only a few motifs , we hypothesize that these few genes are more likely to reside in motif modules of higher density . There - fore , such genes may prove to be sensitive genes for metrics relying on an optimal connectivity among them , possibly such as network robustness . CONCLUSION Motifs are thought to be the elementary building blocks of com - plex biological networks , because they are attributed special func - tions not present in the nodes themselves . For example , feed - forward loop motifs can delay signal transmissions or assist with pulsing behavior when isolated ( Magnan and Alon , 2003 ) . Frus - trating attempts to understand the role of coupled motifs in E . coli and other transcriptional networks is that some feed - forward loops may be more or less important than others ; speciﬁcally , it has been shown before that not all feed - forward loop motifs are equally unexpected when compared against certain randomized networks ( Camas and Poyatos , 2008 ) . Because feed - forward loop motifs within transcriptional networks do not reside in isolation ( Dobrin et al . , 2004 ) , they may be organized into compartments of high density . Although we did not directly measure such an organization of motifs in the networks we considered , genes participating in many motifs ( Table 3 ) are more likely to reside in such compartments . Additionally , the power - law motif participation distribution we report above ( Figure 3 ) demonstrates that only a few genes are integrated throughout the motif network structure ; perturbing the expression patterns of these genes should therefore inﬂuence network metrics that rely on the large - scale connectivity among motifs . Thisshouldbecontrastedwiththemajorityof genes , which are insulated from most other motifs by low participation . Because it is known that the abundance of feed - forward loop motifs is pos - itively correlated with network robustness as measured by noise reduction in gene expression ( Prill et al . , 2005 ) , genes contributing to a larger number of motifs may provide natural targets of future studies investigating this connection . Finally , measuring the motif probability ( Eq . 7 ) of E . coli sug - gests that a small number of master transcriptional regulators are important elements in the distribution of feed - forward loops . Such regulators are not normally considered when building ran - domized networks ; we have shown that such networks support feed - forward loop distributions that poorly reﬂect the biological foundations of the E . coli transcriptional network . Because the connectivity between these master regulators and the rest of the network may strongly contribute to the motif probability distri - bution ( Figure 4A ) , the effect that such regulators contribute to network functionality should be added as an ingredient in future models that hope to realistically describe the coupling among and distribution of feed - forward loop motifs .

Motif participation in E . coli networks APPENDIX THE IN - AND OUT - DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS Here we ﬁnd a solution for the out - degree distribution as given by Eqs 3 and 4 . The derivation to obtain a formula for the in - degree distribution is exactly the same , assuming that the in - degree attachment kernel is independent of a nodes’ out - degree . Therefore , we restrict ourselves to solving only Eqs 3 and 4 . Note that this derivation follows one provided in detail by Newman ( 2010 ) . Master equations are given for the out - degree distribution approximated for very large networks ( Eqs 3 and 4 ) : p ( K ) = np ( K − 1 ) mA ( K − 1 ) − np ( K ) mA ( K ) , and ( A1 ) p ( m ) = 1 − np ( m ) mA ( m ) . ( A2 ) Equation A1 can be written as a recursion between out - degrees K and K − 1 : p ( K ) = nmA ( K − 1 ) 1 + nmA ( K ) p ( K − 1 ) . Iterating this recursive relationship , and including Eq . A2 , gives p ( K ) = 1 nmA ( K ) K (cid:89) i = m (cid:20) 1 + 1 nmA ( i ) (cid:21) − 1 . ( A3 ) Now , using the fact that x = e ln x , Eq . A3 can be rewritten as p ( K ) = 1 nmA ( K ) e − K (cid:80) i = m ln [ 1 + 1 / nmA ( i ) ] . ( A4 ) Equation A4 may be further reduced . By assuming the quantity 1 / nmA ( i ) is “small” ( i . e . , A ( K ) > 1 / nm ) , we may expand ln [ 1 + 1 / nmA ( i ) ] about 1 / nmA ( i ) = 0 in a Taylor series : ln [ 1 + 1 / nmA ( i ) ] = 1 / nmA ( i ) − [ 1 / nmA ( i ) ] 2 / 2 + · · · . Keeping the leading order term and putting this back into ( Eq . A4 ) gives : p ( K ) = 1 nmA ( K ) e − K (cid:80) i = m 1 / nmA ( i ) . ( A5 ) Depending on the relationship between A and K , the summation in Eq . A5 may either be exact or further approximated . Because Jeong et al . ( 2003 ) measured γ = 0 . 8 for many real - world networks , we have used this distribution as a choice of synthetic network in the main text . This special case of nA ( K ) = K γ / z for 1 / 2 < γ < 1 [ with normalization condition z = (cid:80) K γ p ( K ) ] was solved along with other cases in Krapivsky et al . ( 2000 ) ; see also Newman ( 2010 ) : p ( K ) ∼ K − γ e − zK 1 − γ / m ( 1 − γ ) . ( A6 ) THE PROBABILITY THAT A FEED - FORWARD LOOP IS ASSOCIATED WITH A NODE Here we calculate the probability that a network node participates in a feed - forward loop motif in a directed network with arbitrary in - and out - degree sequences . Suppose we choose a node with out - degree K i and in - degree R i . The probability , p i → j , to ﬁnd a link directed from node i to a node j can be estimated following an argument presented in Itzkovitz et al . ( 2003 ) , which we summarize here . First , the probability to ﬁnd no edge from node i to j is given by p no edge i → j = K i (cid:89) l = 1   1 − R j L − R i − l (cid:80) m = 1 R σ m   , ( A7 ) Frontiers in Physiology | Fractal Physiology September 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 357 | 10 Mayo et al . Motif participation in E . coli networks wherein the target for each outgoing link of node i may be contained in a particular set of nodes { σ i : i = 1 , . . . , k } that does not include the target j . The total probability to ﬁnd an edge from i to j , p i → j , is therefore the complement of a sum over all possible ordered sets { σ i } : p i → j = 1 − 1 K i ! (cid:18) N − 2 K i (cid:19) (cid:88) { σ } K i (cid:89) l = 1   1 − R j L − R i − l (cid:80) m = 1 R σ m   . ( A8 ) This expression , ( A8 ) , can be simpliﬁed by assuming that Σ R σ + R i (cid:28) L ( Itzkovitz et al . , 2003 ) , under which Eq . A7 gives p i → j = 1 − (cid:18) 1 − R j L (cid:19) K i = 1 − e − K i R j / L ∼ K i R j L . ( A9 ) The ﬁnal approximation made above assumes that the network is sparse : K i R j (cid:28) L , a feature that is generally true of biological networks ( Leclerc , 2008 ; Del Genio et al . , 2011 ) . The result ( Eq . A9 ) has a very natural interpretation : a link between nodes i and j might be established after K i - many independent attempts to hit a target j of size R j / L . To compute the number of feed - forward loops motifs associated with each , we refer to Figure 1 . When counting feed - forward loops we do not distinguish between up - or down - regulated edges . A network node may participate in a feed - forward loop as any of the three nodes i , j , or k illustrated by Figure 1 . Given that a node hosts out - degree K and in - degree R , the probability that a node plays the role of i in Figure 1 , p i motif , is given by p i motif = n (cid:88) j = 1 n (cid:88) k = 1 p i → j p i → k p j → k . Using Eq . A9 , this calculation can be carried out to ﬁnd p i motif ( K ) = n 2 L 3 K 2 (cid:10) R 2 (cid:11) (cid:104) KR (cid:105) , ( A10 ) wherein we have used 1 n (cid:80) ni = 1 K i = (cid:80) Li = 1 Kp ( K , n ) = (cid:104) K (cid:105) or its equivalent . Similar calculations for the other two nodes yield p j motif ( K , R ) = n 2 L 3 KR (cid:10) K 2 (cid:11) (cid:10) R 2 (cid:11) , and ( A11 ) p k motif ( R ) = n 2 L 3 R 2 (cid:10) K 2 (cid:11) (cid:104) KR (cid:105) . ( A12 ) The probability that a node plays the part of any of the three motif nodes , p motif ( K , R ) , is given by the sum of ( Eqs A10 – A12 ) multiplied by the probability that the node carries the values K and R , p ( K ) and q ( R ) , respectively . Carrying this out yields p motif ( K , R ) = p ( K ) q ( R ) n 2 L 3 (cid:2) K 2 (cid:10) R 2 (cid:11) (cid:104) KR (cid:105) + R 2 (cid:10) K 2 (cid:11) (cid:104) KR (cid:105) + KR (cid:10) K 2 (cid:11) (cid:10) R 2 (cid:11)(cid:3) . ( A13 ) Note the number of expected motifs for a node with K and R out - and in - degrees , µ , is proportional to Eq . A13 . This proportionality constant is different from the abundance of motifs in the entire network , which is the sum number of all unique motifs distributed across it . For example , Itzkovitz et al . ( 2003 ) approximate this abundance for the feed - forward loop in a sparse network : (cid:104) K ( K − 1 ) (cid:105) (cid:104) RK (cid:105) (cid:104) R ( R − 1 ) (cid:105) (cid:104) K (cid:105) 3 .
