Multiple Hippo 2 signaling components are regulated via proteolytic degradation . However , how these degradation 3 mechanisms are themselves modulated remains unexplored . Kibra is a key upstream pathway 4 activator that promotes its own ubiquitin - mediated degradation upon assembling a Hippo 5 signaling complex . Here , we demonstrate that Hippo complex - dependent Kibra degradation is 6 modulated by cortical tension . Using classical genetic , osmotic , and pharmacological 7 manipulations of myosin activity and cortical tension , we show that increasing cortical tension 8 leads to Kibra degradation , whereas decreasing cortical tension increases Kibra abundance . Our 9 study also implicates Par - 1 in regulating Kib abundance downstream of cortical tension . We 10 demonstrate that Par - 1 promotes ubiquitin - mediated Kib degradation in a Hippo complex - 11 dependent manner and is required for tension - induced Kib degradation . Collectively , our results 12 reveal a previously unknown molecular mechanism by which cortical tension affects Hippo 13 signaling and provide novel insights into the role of mechanical forces in growth control . 14 2 Introduction 15 Elucidating the mechanisms that ensure robustness and reproducibility of organ size is a 16 fundamental problem in cell and developmental biology . A key regulator of tissue growth in 17 animals is the Hippo pathway . At its core , the Hippo pathway consists of a kinase cascade , 18 composed of Ser / Thr kinases Hippo ( Hpo ) and Warts ( Wts ) and scaffold proteins Salvador ( Sav ) 19 and Mats , that inhibits nuclear translocation of a pro - growth transcriptional co - activator , Yorkie 20 ( Yki ) . The activity of the kinase cascade is regulated by multiple upstream components , 21 including a multivalent scaffold protein , Kibra ( Kib ) . Kib localizes at the apical cell cortex of 22 epithelial cells , where together with its binding partner , Merlin ( Mer ) , it plays a key role in 23 assembling and activating the Hippo kinase cascade to repress Yki activity . In the absence of a 24 conventional receptor / ligand pair , however , little is known about how Kib activity is regulated . 25 A conserved feature of the Hippo pathway is its regulation via forces generated by F - actin 26 and non - muscle myosin II ( actomyosin ) . Actomyosin forces are regulated by the small GTPase 27 RhoA ( Rho1 in Drosophila ) , which can be activated or deactivated by guanine exchange factors 28 ( GEFs ) or GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) , respectively ( Piekny et al . , 2005 ) . Rho1 potently 29 stimulates actomyosin contractility by simultaneously activating Diaphanous , a formin that 30 promotes linear F - actin bundle assembly , and Rho kinase ( Rok ) , which phosphorylates and 31 activates the myosin regulatory light chain ( Lecuit et al . , 2011 ) . Studies over the years have 32 shown that both F - actin polymerization and myosin activation stimulate the activity of Yki and 33 its mammalian homologs , YAP / TAZ ( Sansores - Garcia et al . , 2011 ; Fernandez et al . , 2011 ; 34 Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Wada et al . , 2011 ; Aragona et al . , 2013 ; Rauskolb et al . , 2014 ; Ibar et al . , 35 2018 ) . Mechanistically , cytoskeletal tension was shown to promote Yki / YAP activity via LIM 36 domain Ajuba family proteins , such as Ajuba ( Jub ) , which accumulate at cell - cell junctions in 37 response to tension and sequester Wts ( Rauskolb et al . , 2014 ; Pan et al . , 2016 ; Ibar et al . , 2018 ) . 38 However , this mechanism acts directly on the core kinase cascade , and it remains unclear 39 whether or how tension could regulate the upstream Hippo signaling components , such as Kib . 40 A key determinant of signaling ouput downstream of Kib is its protein level . Loss of Kib 41 results in tissue overgrowth via Yki activation , while the opposite occurs under ectopic Kib 42 expression ( Yu et al . , 2010a ; Genevet et al . , 2010 ; Baumgartner et al . , 2010 ; Su et al . , 2017 ; 43 Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , upstream regulators , including Mer , Expanded and Kib , are 44 transcriptionally upregulated by Yki , making their abundance a key component of a conserved 45 negative feedback loop ( Hamaratoglu et al . , 2006 ; Genevet et al . , 2010 ; Yee et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , 46 control of Kib abundance provides an important point for modulating Kib - mediated Hippo 47 pathway activation . In addition to transcriptional regulation , Kib abundance is regulated via 48 ubiquitin - mediated proteolytic turnover ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . Upon assembly of the Hippo 49 complex , Kib is ubiquitinated via the SCF Slimb E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequently degraded . 50 This mechanism simultaneously requires a consensus recognition motif in Kib that recruits 51 SCF Slimb , as well as the two N - terminal WW domains in Kib that mediate Hippo complex 52 formation . Notably , Kib levels are elevated in cells with lower cortical tension , suggesting that 53 actomyosin - generated forces could regulate Kib abundance ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . How Kib 54 levels are modulated by mechanical forces and whether this mechanism involves additional 55 mechanosensitive components remains unknown . 56 In this study , using genetic , osmotic , and pharmacological manipulations of myosin 57 activity , we report that actomyosin - generated cortical tension modulates Kib abundance . We find 58 that increasing myosin activity and cortical tension lowers Kib abundance , while acutely 59 inhibiting myosin activity elevates Kib levels . Importantly , we find that tension - mediated Kib 60 3 degradation occurs independently of the previously identified Jub - Wts mechanism . Instead , our 61 results suggest that the serine / threonine kinase Par - 1 promotes Kib degradation in a tension 62 dependent manner . Together , our findings provide evidence that tension regulates upstream 63 Hippo signaling and advance our understanding of how mechanical forces can influence the 64 activity of a signaling pathway . 65 Results 66 Cortical tension promotes Kib degradation 67 Previously , we showed that Kib’s role in assembling the Hippo signaling complex promotes its 68 own degradation , thereby forming a post - translational negative feedback loop ( Tokamov et al . , 69 2021 ) . Additionally , our results suggested that this feedback mechanism is modulated by cortical 70 tension because cell clones under compression display higher levels of Kib than their neighbors . 71 To better understand how Kib abundance is regulated , we sought to genetically manipulate non - 72 muscle myosin II ( myosin ) contractility as a means to affect cortical tension . To visualize Kib , 73 we used Kib tagged with the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) and expressed under the ubiquitin 74 promoter ( Ubi > Kib - GFP ) , a transgene that we previously showed to be an effective reporter of 75 post - translational changes in Kib abundance ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . We first transiently 76 ectopically expressed RhoGEF2 to activate Rho1 upstream of myosin in the posterior 77 compartment of the wing imaginal disc using the hh > Gal4 driver combined with ubiquitously 78 expressed Gal80 ts ( tub > Gal80 ts ) . Strikingly , expression of RhoGEF2 for 24h resulted in a 79 significant decrease in Kib levels ( Fig . 1A - B ) . Using phospho - specific antibody against the 80 phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain ( pMRLC , Zhang and Ward , 2011 ) , we confirmed 81 that myosin activity was upregulated under these conditions ( Fig . S1A - A’’ ) . Additionally , 82 consistent with the function of Kib in repressing Yki and the role of tension in promoting Yki 83 transcriptional activity ( Genevet et al . , 2010 ; Yu et al . , 2010b ; Baumgartner et al . , 2010 ; 84 Rauskolb et al . , 2014 ) , we saw increased nuclear Yki accumulation upon RhoGEF2 expression 85 ( Fig . S1B - B’’ ) . In contrast , the abundance of Ubi > Kib D WW1 - GFP , a variant of Kib that is 86 insensitive to Hippo complex - mediated degradation ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) , was not affected by 87 RhoGEF2 expression ( Fig . 1C - D ) . These results are consistent with our previous observation that 88 the abundance of wild - type Kib , but not Kib D WW1 , was elevated in mosaic clones with decreased 89 cortical tension ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) and suggest that cortical tension regulates Kib abundance 90 via complex - mediated degradation . 91 We also previously showed that cortically localized Yki promotes myosin activation via a 92 myosin light chain kinase called Stretchin ( Strn - MLCK , Xu et al . , 2018 ) . Specifically , ectopic 93 expression of myristoylated Yki ( myr - Yki ) leads to a significant increase in myosin activation . 94 Therefore , we asked if myr - Yki expression also affected Kib levels . As with RhoGEF2 95 expression , ectopic myr - Yki expression substantially diminished Kib levels ( Fig . 1E & F ) . 96 Depletion of Strn - MLCK strongly suppressed the effect of myr - Yki , suggesting that this effect 97 was mediated via myosin activity ( Fig . 1E’ , F ) . However , Strn - MLCK depletion alone did not 98 increase Kib levels ( Fig . 1E’’ , F ) , so the physiological significance of this effect is unclear . 99 Changes in osmotic conditions alter myosin activity and cortical tension 100 Our genetic manipulations of cortical tension support the model that tension promotes Kib 101 turnover . We sought to further test this model by acutely manipulating myosin activity and 102 4 cortical tension . Changes in osmotic pressure have been used extensively to alter cortical 103 cytoskeletal organization and tension ( Di Ciano et al . , 2002 ; Guilak et al . , 2002 ; Sinha et al . , 104 2011 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Stewart et al . , 2011 ; Pietuch et al . , 2013 ; Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2016 ; 105 Roffay et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , we decided to subject wing imaginal discs to different osmotic 106 conditions ( see Methods ) and examine the effect on myosin activity and cortical tension . We 107 aimed to alter osmolarity gently enough to avoid cell death or tissue rupture and ensure 108 reversibility of the effected changes . 109 We first examined the effect of different osmotic conditions on myosin activity using the 110 anti - pMRLC antibody . Compared to isotonic controls , we saw a slight decrease in pMRLC 111 staining under hypertonic conditions , although this effect was not statistically significant , likely 112 due to the background associated with the antibody ( Fig . 2A - B’ , D ) . Under hypotonic conditions , 113 however , we observed a substantial increase in pMRLC ( Fig . 2C - D ) , indicating that osmotic 114 manipulations can acutely alter myosin activation . To ask if the observed changes in myosin 115 activity affected cortical tension , we performed laser - cutting experiments on individual bicellular 116 junctions and measured their initial recoil velocity . Because of the inherent heterogeneity of cell 117 junctional lengths and apical areas across the wing imaginal epithelium , we restricted all laser 118 cuts to the ventral - anterior region of the presumptive wing blade , which normally contains cells 119 with larger apical areas and longer junctions . Additionally , we were careful to avoid proximity to 120 mitotic cells ( Fig . S2A ) . Consistent with the observed differences in pMRLC staining , we saw a 121 significant decrease in recoil velocities under hypertonic conditions and an even more significant 122 increase in recoil upon hypotonic shift ( Fig . 2E - F , Movie 1 ) . We observed no correlation between 123 junctional length and recoil velocities ( Fig . S2B ) . Collectively , these results show that osmotic 124 manipulations can be used to acutely modulate myosin activity and cortical tension in the 125 imaginal epithelium . 126 To further validate that osmotically - altered cortical tension can induce biologically 127 relevant consequences , we once again examined the localization of Yki - YFP . Because tension is 128 known to promote nuclear Yki accumulation , we hypothesized that hypertonic conditions ( lower 129 tension ) should lead to less nuclear Yki , while hypotonic conditions should result in more 130 nuclear Yki . For these experiments , in order to see a definitive effect on Yki localization , we 131 increased the incubation time to 30 min . Consistent with our hypothesis , shifting tissues from an 132 isotonic to a hypertonic solution resulted in a decrease in nuclear Yki ( Fig . S3A - B’’ , D ) . 133 Conversely , shifting to a hypotonic solution led to a dramatic increase in nuclear Yki ( Fig . S3C - 134 D ) . To further demonstrate the significance of this effect , we decided to first concentrate Yki in 135 the nuclei under hypotonic conditions and then shift to a hypertonic environment . Hypotonically - 136 induced nuclear Yki accumulation was completely reversed after incubation in a hypertonic 137 solution ( Fig . S3E - H ) . Together , these results show that osmotic manipulations can be used to 138 acutely modulate myosin activity and cortical tension in an epithelial monolayer with 139 biologically relevant consequences . 140 Osmotic shifts affect Kib abundance 141 Given our result that changes in the medium osmolarity can influence cortical tension , we asked 142 if the osmotic manipulations also affected Kib abundance . Compared to isotonic conditions , 143 incubating tissues in a hypertonic solution resulted in an increased Kib abundance at the apical 144 cortex ( Fig . 3A , B , & D ) . Moreover , Kib fluorescence also increased in more basal tissue 145 sections , suggesting that the apical increase in Kib was not due to apical recruitment from the 146 cytoplasmic pool ( Fig . 3E ) . Conversely , in tissues incubated in a hypotonic solution , Kib 147 5 abundance decreased dramatically both at the apical cortex and in more basal tissue sections 148 compared to isotonic controls ( Fig . 3C - E ) . In contrast , fluorescence intensity of Ubi > Kib D WW1 - 149 GFP did not change significantly under osmotic shifts ( Fig . S4A - C ) , suggesting that osmotically - 150 induced Kib degradation is mediated via the previously described Hippo complex - dependent 151 mechanism ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . These results demonstrate that cortical tension can rapidly 152 modulate Kib abundance . 153 We also considered the possibility that changes in apical area could alter Kib distribution 154 and fluorescence intensity by concentrating or diluting the protein at the cortex . To address this 155 point , we first measured fluorescent intensity of a junctional marker , Ecad - mKate2 , and saw no 156 significant changes under osmotic shifts ( Fig . 3F ) . Next , we measured apical cell areas upon 157 shifting wing imaginal tissues from isotonic to hypotonic or hypertonic conditions . Immediately 158 after the addition of the hypotonic solution , apical areas increased rapidly during the first ~ 3 min 159 of incubation ( Fig . 3G ) . However , this initial increase was followed by a steady decrease of areas 160 in the next 12 min , until on average the areas returned roughly to their initial values ( Fig . 3G , 161 Movie 2 ) . Similarly , addition of the hypertonic solution resulted in a transient reduction in apical 162 areas during the first ~ 3 min , followed by a steady return to their starting values by 15 min of 163 incubation ( Fig . 3H , Movie 3 ) . Because we measured Kib fluorescence after 15 min of 164 incubation ( Fig . 3A - C ) , changes in apical area are unlikely to explain the observed changes in 165 cortical Kib abundance under osmotic shifts . Collectively , these results suggest that changes in 166 myosin activity may be responsible for changes in Kib abundance under osmotic shifts . 167 Inhibition of myosin activity blocks Kib degradation under hypotonic conditions 168 If myosin - generated cortical tension is responsible for the observed decrease in Kib abundance 169 under hypotonic shift , then inhibiting myosin activity under these conditions should block Kib 170 degradation . To test this idea , we used Y - 27632 , a pharmacological inhibitor of Rho kinase ( Rok ) 171 activity ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . Under isotonic conditions , we observed a slight reduction in 172 pMRLC staining when tissues were treated with Y - 27632 ( Fig . 4A - B’ ) , though this effect was 173 not statistically significant ( Fig . 4I ; again , possibly obscured by high antibody background 174 staining ) . However , Y - 27632 potently inhibited myosin hyperactivation induced by hypotonic 175 conditions ( Fig . 4C - D’ , I ) . 176 We next asked if Y - 27632 treatment would affect Kib abundance . Strikingly , we observed 177 a substantial increase in Kib abundance after 15 min of Y - 27632 treatment under isotonic 178 conditions ( Fig . 4E , F , & J ) , supporting the idea that myosin activity promotes Kib degradation . 179 To test if Rok inhibition could block the effect of hypotonic conditions , we incubated tissues in a 180 hypotonic solution containing Y - 27632 . Addition of Y - 27632 strongly blocked the effect of the 181 hypotonic medium on Kib abundance ( Fig . 4G , H , & J ) , suggesting that the effect of osmotic 182 shifts on Kib abundance is caused by myosin activity . 183 We also considered the possibility that the effect of Y - 27632 could be mediated via 184 inhibition of another known target of this inhibitor , the atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) . To test 185 this possibility , we took advantage of a conditional allele of aPKC , aPKC as4 that can be acutely 186 inhibited using 1NA - PP1 , an allele - specific analog of a potent kinase inhibitor ( Hannaford et al . , 187 2019a ) . As expected , under normal conditions , aPKC as4 was enriched at the apical cortex in the 188 wing imaginal epithelium ( Fig . S5A - A’ ) . In contrast , treatment with 1NA - PP1 severely inhibited 189 aPKC cortical localization ( Fig . S5B - B’ ) . On the other hand , treatment with Y - 27632 did not 190 significantly affect aPKC cortical localization in wild type imaginal discs ( Fig . S5C - D ' ) . 191 Additionally , we treated wing discs homozygous for aPKC as4 allele with 1NA - PP1 and did not 192 6 observe any changes in Kib abundance upon aPKC inhibition ( Fig . S5E - G ) . These results show 193 that the effect of Y - 27632 on Kib abundance is not due to aPKC inhibition and instead suggest 194 that Kib degradation under hypotonic conditions is mediated via cortical tension . 195 Par - 1 regulates Kib abundance 196 How can tension influence abundance of a signaling protein such as Kib ? Previous work 197 identified a mechanism whereby tension inhibits Hippo signaling via Jub - mediated sequestration 198 and inactivation of Wts / LATS at the cell - cell junctions ( Rauskolb et al . , 2014 ; Ibar et al . , 2018 ) . 199 Surprisingly , although we observed a significant increase in myosin activity under hypotonic 200 conditions ( Fig . 2C ) , we did not detect significant changes in cortical Jub ( Fig . S6A - D ) . 201 Additionally , loss of Jub does not affect Kib levels ( Fig . S6E ) . These observations suggest that 202 cortical tension regulates Kib abundance independently of Jub . 203 Recently , cortical tension was shown to promote cortical localization of Par - 1 in the 204 Drosophila oocyte ( Doerflinger et al . , 2021 ) . Interestingly , Par - 1 mediates proteolytic 205 degradation of an SCF Slimb / βTrCP substrate Oskar ( Morais - de - Sá et al . , 2013 ) and is known to 206 physically associate with Hippo signaling components and regulate tissue growth ( Huang et al . , 207 2013 , p . 1 ) . We therefore hypothesized that cortical tension could promote Kib degradation via 208 Par - 1 . To test this idea , we first asked if Par - 1 regulates Kib abundance using Ubi > Kib - GFP as a 209 reporter . Kib levels increased significantly upon Par - 1 depletion ( Figs . 5A & C , S7A ) , whereas 210 ectopic Par - 1 expression resulted in a significant reduction in Kib levels ( Fig . 5B & C ) . In 211 contrast , loss of Par - 1 did not affect the abundance of Kib D WW1 ( Fig . 5D & E ) , suggesting that 212 Par - 1 regulates Kib levels via Kib - mediated Hippo complex assembly ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . 213 Par - 1 was previously shown to promote Hpo phosphorylation on Ser30 , which inhibits 214 Hpo activity ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we considered the possibility that the increase in 215 Kib abundance under loss of Par - 1 was indirectly caused by the lack of Hpo phosphorylation on 216 Ser30 . If this were the case , we reasoned that ectopic expression of Hpo construct that is 217 refractory to Par - 1 phosphorylation ( Hpo S30A ) , would also lead to increased Kib abundance . To 218 this end , we first transiently expressed wild - type Hpo in the posterior compartment of the wing 219 imaginal disc and examined the effect on Kib levels . Consistent with our previous finding that 220 Hpo promotes Kib ubiquitination and degradation ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) , Kib levels decreased 221 significantly under ectopic Hpo expression ( Fig . S7B ) . Importantly , ectopic expression of 222 Hpo S30A also induced a decrease in Kib abundance ( Fig . S7C ) , suggesting that the effect of Par - 1 223 on Kib abundance is not mediated through Hpo phosphorylation . 224 We have previously shown that Kib is ubiquitinated via SCF Slimb / βTrCP in cultured 225 Schneider’s 2 ( S2 ) cells . Because Par - 1 is a kinase and is known to function with SCF Slimb / βTrCP , 226 we asked if Par - 1 affects Kib ubiquitination or phosphorylation in S2 cells . We observed that 227 while Kib was ubiquitinated in control cells , Par - 1 depletion led to a strong decrease in Kib 228 ubiquitination ( Fig . 5F ) . To test if Par - 1 promotes Kib phosphorylation , we performed gel - shift 229 assays in the presence of wild type or kinase - dead Par - 1 ( Par - 1 KD ) . Kib is normally 230 phosphorylated in S2 cells , as it appears as a smeary , slow migrating band that collapses into a 231 single , faster migrating band with phosphatase treatment ( Fig . 5G , Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . 232 Addition of active Par - 1 , but not Par - 1 KD , resulted in an upward shift of Kib band and 233 disappearance of the lower , non - phosphorylated pool , suggesting that Par - 1 promotes Kib 234 phosphorylation ( Fig . 5G ) . Together , these results suggest that Par - 1 regulates ubiquitin - mediated 235 Kib degradation , possibly in a phosphorylation - dependent manner , and that tension could 236 modulate Kib abundance via Par - 1 . 237 7 Cortical tension promotes Par - 1 association with the cortex 238 Given the previous report that myosin activity promotes cortical Par - 1 localization in the 239 Drosophila oocyte ( Doerflinger et al . , 2021 ) , we wondered if a similar effect could be observed 240 in the wing imaginal epithelium . To this end , we first examined Par - 1 localization in control cells 241 or in cells overexpressing RhoGEF2 . Although known as a basolateral component , in the 242 Drosophila blastoderm Par - 1 also localizes at the apicolateral cortex ( Bayraktar et al . , 2006 ) . In 243 the wing imaginal disc , Par - 1 displayed apical and basolateral localization , though its 244 localization appeared diffuse in both places ( Fig . 6A & A’ ) . Transient overexpression of 245 RhoGEF2 resulted in sharper Par - 1 localization at the cell cortex both apically and basolaterally 246 ( Fig . 6B & B’ ) , suggesting that tension can affect Par - 1 cortical association . As an alternative 247 approach , we also examined Par - 1 localization using Airyscan confocal microscopy under 248 hypotonic conditions . Similar to ectopic RhoGEF2 expression , Par - 1 was more tightly associated 249 with the apical and basolateral cortex under hypotonic compared to isotonic conditions ( Fig . 6C - 250 D’ ) . These results suggest that tension promotes Par - 1 association with the cell cortex . 251 Par - 1 is required for tension - dependent degradation of Kib 252 We reasoned that if tension regulates in Kib abundance via Par - 1 , then in the absence of Par - 1 253 tension would have no effect on Kib levels . To test this idea , we depleted Par - 1 in the posterior 254 compartment of the wing imaginal disc using the hh > Gal4 driver and quantified changes in Kib 255 levels when tissues were shifted from isotonic to hypotonic conditions . While we observed a 256 significant decrease in Kib intensity in the anterior ( control ) compartment , there was no 257 significant change in the posterior ( Par - 1 depleted ) compartment ( Fig . 6E - G ) . Collectively , these 258 results are consistent with the idea that tension modulates Kib abundance by controlling Par - 1 259 cortical association . 260 Discussion 261 Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control the abundance of individual signaling 262 components has been central to our understanding how the Hippo pathway is regulated ( Ribeiro 263 et al . , 2014 ; Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Rodrigues - Campos and Thompson , 2014 ; Aerne et al . , 2015 ; Ma 264 et al . , 2018 ; Fulford et al . , 2019 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ; Misra and Irvine , 2019 ; Tokamov et al . , 265 2021 ) . However , how these different mechanisms themselves are regulated has been a poorly 266 understood and intriguing area of investigation . Our work reveals a previously unrecognized role 267 of cortical tension in modulating the abundance of a key upstream Hippo pathway component , 268 Kib . Using a combination of genetic , osmotic , and pharmacological approaches , we demonstrate 269 that cortical tension promotes Kib degradation . Our study also implicates Par - 1 in mediating Kib 270 degradation downstream of cortical tension . This work advances our understanding of how 271 tension regulates Hippo signaling and provides novel insights into the role of mechanical forces 272 in tissue growth and patterning . 273 We provide several lines of evidence that Kib is degraded as a result of myosin - generated 274 tension . First , we show that activation of myosin via two different myosin light chain kinases , 275 Rok ( in the case of ectopic RhoGEF2 expression and Y - 27632 treatment ) and Strn - MLCK ( in the 276 case of ectopic myr - Yki expression ) decreases Kib abundance ( Figs . 1 & 4 ) , suggesting that Kib 277 degradation occurs irrespective of the upstream mechanisms of myosin activation . Second , 278 although RhoGEF2 is known to promote both myosin activity and formin - mediated F - actin 279 assembly , we did not observe a detectible effect on F - actin under transient RhoGEF2 expression , 280 8 whereas myosin activity was substantially upregulated ( Fig . S1 ) . Third , we develop a simple , 281 non - genetic and acute approach to dramatically increase myosin activity using hypotonic 282 conditions and demonstrate that myosin activation using this method results in Kib degradation 283 ( Figs . 2 - 4 ) . Thus , we propose that Kib degradation is modulated by cortical tension downstream 284 of myosin activity . 285 Our results also suggest that Kib degradation downstream of cortical tension is mediated 286 via Hippo complex formation . We have shown previously that Kib targets itself for ubiquitin - 287 mediated degradation upon Hippo complex assembly , and this process requires Kib’s WW1 288 domain and a consensus degron motif recognized by SCF Slimb / βTrCP ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . In this 289 study , we observe that the abundance of wild - type Kib , but not Kib 𝚫 WW1 , is modulated via 290 myosin activity , raising the question of how tension can promote complex - dependent Kib 291 turnover . In the simplest scenario , cortical tension could promote the association of existing Kib 292 complexes with a tension - sensitive component capable of modulating Kib levels . We identify 293 Par - 1 as a potential link in this process . Cortical tension was previously reported to promote 294 cortical Par - 1 localization in the Drosophila oocyte ( Doerflinger et al . , 2021 ) . Here , we show that 295 Par - 1 promotes turnover of wild - type Kib , but not Kib 𝚫 WW1 , in vivo and regulates Kib 296 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in cultured cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Importantly , cortical tension fails to 297 induce Kib turnover in cells depleted of Par - 1 ( Fig . 6 ) . Based on these results , and our 298 observations that Par - 1 becomes more tightly associated with the cell cortex under increased 299 cortical tension ( Fig . 6 ) , we propose that cortical tension could regulate Kib levels at least in part 300 by modulating the association of Par - 1 with Kib signaling complexes . Interestingly , a recent 301 study in human cells also suggested that tension generated at the ECM promotes degradation of a 302 Hpo homolog , MST2 , by modulating the physical interaction between MST2 and SCF Slimb / βTrCP 303 complex ( Fiore et al . , 2022 ) . Thus , in a more complex scenario , cortical tension could also 304 regulate Kib association with multiple components of the degradation machinery , including 305 SCF Slimb / βTrCP . 306 This study also highlights the recurring role of Par - 1 in the regulation of Hippo signaling . 307 Previous work suggested that Par - 1 phosphorylates Hpo , which prevents Hpo association with 308 Sav ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we find that Par - 1 regulates Kib abundance independently of Hpo 309 phosphorylation . Our observation that Par - 1 regulates the abundance of wild - type Kib but not 310 Kib D WW1 suggests that Par - 1 regulates Kib via the Hippo complex - mediated degradation 311 mechanism involving SCF Slimb / βTrCP ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . This idea is supported by a previous 312 report that Par - 1 functions with SCF Slimb / βTrCP in promoting turnover of Oscar during Drosophila 313 oocyte development ( Morais - de - Sá et al . , 2013 ) . Notably , active Par - 1 was also found to be a 314 target of SCF Slimb / βTrCP - mediated degradation ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) , further highlighting the tight 315 association between Par - 1 , SCF Slimb / βTrCP , and Kib . It is still unclear what happens to the rest of 316 the Hippo signaling complex after Kib is degraded , but the multifaceted function of Par - 1 in 317 inhibiting Hpo activity , Hpo - Sav interaction , and promoting Kib degradation could provide the 318 means of dissociating the entire signaling complex upon Kib turnover . 319 One of the surprising observations in our study is that while cortical tension induced by 320 hypotonic conditions triggers Kib degradation , it does not affect junctional Jub accumulation . 321 Previous work has shown that increasing myosin activity via genetic manipulations enhances Jub 322 recruitment to the adherens junctions , where Jub sequesters Wts ( Rauskolb et al . , 2014 ) . This 323 recruitment is thought to be mediated via tension - induced opening of α - catenin conformation , 324 which exposes a region in α - catenin that binds Jub ( Rauskolb et al . , 2014 ; Alégot et al . , 2019 ; 325 Sarpal et al . , 2019 ) . Combined with these reports , our observations suggest that hypotonically - 326 9 induced myosin activation may differ from that achieved via common genetic manipulations . 327 Most obviously , this difference could be temporal – hypotonic treatment of wing imaginal discs 328 induces dramatic myosin activation and Kib degradation within 15 minutes ( Fig . 2 ) , whereas 329 genetic manipulations are done in the order of hours or days . Thus , α - catenin - mediated 330 recruitment of Jub could occur at a longer timescale compared to the more dynamic Kib 331 turnover . Counter to this argument , a recent study observed rapid junctional accumulation of Jub - 332 Wts clusters at sites of high tension in the Drosophila developing notum ( López - Gay et al . , 333 2020 ) . An alternative explanation is that hypotonically - induced myosin activation does not result 334 in α - catenin conformational changes . The opening of α - catenin conformation at bicellular 335 junctions is thought to be triggered via actomyosin forces applied orthogonally to the junctions 336 ( Rauskolb et al . , 2019 ; López - Gay et al . , 2020 ) . This is unlikely to be the case under hypotonic 337 conditions , where actomyosin generated forces would be generated parallel to the lateral 338 membrane to counteract the mechanical stretching induced by hydrostatic pressure . 339 Finally , our study raises the question of the biological importance of tension - dependent 340 Kib degradation . In the growing wing imaginal epithelium , cortical tension was shown to be 341 higher at the tissue periphery than at the tissue center ( LeGoff et al . , 2013 ; Mao et al . , 2013 ) . 342 Greater tension at the periphery was proposed to drive growth , possibly via Yki activity , to 343 compensate for the lower concentration of growth - stimulating morphogens , which diffuse from 344 narrow stripes of cells at the center of the tissue ( Aegerter - Wilmsen et al . , 2007 , 2012 ; 345 Hariharan , 2015 ; Pan et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally , we have previously reported that Kib 346 degradation occurs more prominently at the tissue periphery , where cortical tension is higher 347 ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . Based on these studies , we propose that tension - mediated Kib 348 degradation could serve to pattern Hippo signaling activity , and therefore growth , across a 349 growing epithelium such as the wing imaginal disc . How Kib degradation and other tension - 350 regulated mechanisms , such as the Jub - Wts mechanism , are coordinated to control the Hippo 351 pathway and growth remains unanswered . However , we believe this study provides valuable 352 insights for future investigation of the molecular mechanisms by which mechanical forces affect 353 tissue growth . 354 10 Methods 355 Table 1 : Reagents 356 Reagent type ( species ) or resource Designation Source or reference Identifiers Additional information genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) Ubi > Kib - GFP - FLAG ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) Ubi - Kib D WW1 - GFP - FLAG ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) UASp - T7 - RhoGEF2 Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center BL9387 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) UASt - myr - Yki 10 . 1016 / j . devcel . 2018 . 06 . 017 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) UAS - Strn RNAi Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center BL26736 Validated in 10 . 1016 / j . de vcel . 2018 . 0 6 . 017 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) UAS - Par - 1 RNAi Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center BL32410 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) UAS - jub RNAi Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center BL30806 Validated in 10 . 1016 / j . cu b . 2010 . 02 . 0 35 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) Ecad - 3XmKate2 ( Pinheiro et al . , 2017 ) 11 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) Par - 1 : GFP ( protein trap ) Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center BL64452 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) Jub : GFP Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center BL56806 genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) w 1118 ; yki B5 { yki - YFP } VK37 ( Xu et al . , 2018 ) genetic reagent ( D . melanogaster ) aPKC as4 ( Hannaford et al . , 2019b ) Antibody anti - pSqh ( Guinea pig , polyclonal ) ( Zhang and Ward , 2011 ) Tissue staining ( 1 : 300 ) Antibody anti - DEcad ( Rat , polyclonal ) Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank Cat # AB _ 5 28120 ; RRID : AB _ 528120 Tissue staining ( 1 : 1000 ) Antibody anti - PKC , rabbit polyclonal Santa Cruz Biotechnology Lot # : G2304 tissue staining ( 1 : 1000 ) Antibody anti - GFP , guinea pig , polyclonal ( Yee et al . , 2019 ) IP ( 1 : 1250 ) Antibody anti - GFP , rabbit , polyclonal Michael Glotzer , ( University of Chicago ) IB ( 1 : 5000 ) Chemical Y - 27632 Fisher Scientific Cat . # 12541 Rho kinase inhibitor 12 Chemical 1 - NA - PP1 Cayman Cat . # CAYM - 10954 - 1 ATP analog Drosophila husbandry 357 Drosophila melanogaster was cultured using standard techniques at 25°C ( unless otherwise 358 noted ) . For Gal80 ts experiments , crosses were maintained at 18°C until larvae reached late 359 second or early third instar stages and shifted to 29°C for the duration specified in each 360 experiment . Immediately after incubation at 29°C , wing imaginal tissues were dissected from 361 wandering third instar larvae and imaged live . 362 Live imaging 363 Throughout the study ( except in Figs . 2A - C’ , 4A - D’ , S1A - A’ , S5A - D’ ) , wing imaginal discs 364 were imaged live . Imaging of live tissues was performed as previously described ( Xu et al . , 365 2019 ) . Briefly , freshly dissected wing imaginal discs from third instar larvae were pipetted into a 366 ~ 40 ml droplet of Schneider’s Drosophila Medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum 367 and mounted on a glass slide . To support the tissue , spherical glass beads ( Cospheric , Product 368 ID : SLGMS - 2 . 5 ) of ~ 50 mm in diameter were placed under the cover slip . The mounted samples 369 were immediately imaged . 370 For osmotic shifts , Y - 27632 treatment , and laser ablation experiments , live imaging 371 method was adapted from Restrepo et al . ( 2016 ) . Briefly , wing imaginal tissues were first 372 dissected in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine 373 Serum ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The tissues were then transferred with a pipette in 5 - 10μl of 374 medium to a glass bottom microwell dish ( MatTek , 35mm petri dish , 14mm microwell ) with No . 375 1 . 5 coverglass . The discs were oriented so that the apical side of the disc proper faced the 376 coverglass . A Millicell culture insert ( Sigma , 12mm diameter , 8μm membrane pore size ) was 377 prepared in advance by cutting off the bottom legs with a razor blade and removing any excess 378 membrane material around the rim of the insert . The insert was carefully placed into the 14mm 379 microwell space , directly on top of the drop containing properly oriented tissues . To prevent the 380 tissue from moving , the space between the insert and the microwell was sealed with ~ 10μl of 381 mineral oil . Media with indicated osmolarity and / or chemical inhibitor was then added into the 382 chamber of the insert ( 200μl in all experiments ) . An inverted Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning 383 confocal microscope equipped with a GaAsP spectral detector and the Airyscan module was used 384 for all imaging ( except for laser ablation experiments , see below ) . 385 Osmotic shift experiments 386 Schneider’s Drosophila Medium ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( Thermo 387 Fisher Scientific ) was used as isotonic medium ( ~ 360mOsm ) . To make a hypertonic solution , the 388 osmolarity of the isotonic solution was increased to ~ 460mOsm using 1M NaCl . To make a 389 hypotonic solution , the isotonic medium was diluted with deionized water to ~ 216mOsm . All 390 osmotic solutions were prepared fresh immediately before the experiments . In most experiments , 391 tissues were incubated for 15 min in a humid chamber before mounting ( see above ) . For practical 392 reasons , in laser ablation experiments tissues were incubated for 8 min to allow for 393 measurements to be taken at an average of 15 min under osmotic incubations . 394 13 To observe changes in Yki - YFP localization , flies expressing BAC recombineered Yki - 395 YFP in the background of yki B5 null allele were used . Ubi > RFP nls was also expressed in the 396 background to mark the nuclei . Tissues were dissected and mounted as described above . Each 397 wing disc was first imaged under isotonic conditions , with 4 - 5 optical sections taken in the basal 398 plane where the nuclei were clearly identifiable . The isotonic medium was then replaced with an 399 indicated osmotic solution , and after 30 min of incubation , each tissue was reacquired in the 400 same order and roughly the same optical plane . The steps were repeated for the third osmotic 401 condition . 402 pMRLC staining experiments 403 Wandering third instar larvae were dissected in an isotonic solution and the wing imaginal discs 404 were transferred into a 150μl drop of freshly prepared osmotic medium . For experiments with Y - 405 27632 , osmotic media with 50μM of Y - 27632 were prepared . The tissues were incubated for 15 406 min . After incubation , the discs were washed with 1X Ringer’s buffer with correspondingly 407 adjusted osmolarity ( i . e . for hypertonic experiments , a hypertonic wash was prepared the same 408 way as described above , except 1X Ringer’s was used instead of the Schneider’s medium ) and 409 fixed for 20 min in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 1X Ringer’s solution also with properly adjusted 410 osmolarity ( for Y - 27632 experiments , 50μM of Y - 27632 was also added in the wash and the fix 411 solutions ) . Tissues were then stained with the primary antibody against the Drosophila phospho - 412 MRLC ( anti - pSqh , see Table 1 ) and secondary antibodies as previously described ( McCartney 413 and Fehon , 1996 ) . 414 Laser ablation of bi - cellular junctions 415 Laser cuts were conducted using a pulsed Micropoint nitrogen laser ( Andor Technology ) tuned to 416 365 nm and mounted on an Andor Revolution XD spinning disk confocal microscope . Individual 417 junctions were ablated by delivering 3 pulses at a single point with a duration of 67 ms / pulse . 418 Each tissue was imaged 2x before and 20x immediately after ablation , with a time interval of 4 s . 419 Images were acquired using a 100X oil - immersion lens ( Olympus , NA 1 . 40 ) , an iXon Ultra 897 420 camera ( Andor ) , and Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) as the image acquisition software . 421 Sixteen - bit Z - stacks were collected at each time point consisting of 7 slices with 0 . 5 μm interval . 422 To measure initial recoil velocity , the positions of the two tricellular vertices connected 423 by the ablated junction were manually tracked using the SIESTA image analysis platform 424 ( Fernandez - Gonzalez and Zallen , 2011 ) , and the initial retraction velocities were calculated using 425 custom MATLAB scripts . 426 Image analysis , quantification of fluorescence intensities and apical areas 427 All images were processed in ImageJ . For apical Kib - GFP , Kib 𝚫 WW1 - GFP , Jub - GFP , and Ecad - 428 mKate2 mean fluorescence intensity measurements were taken from maximum intensity 429 projections ( ~ 0 . 75 μm / section , four to six sections from apical surface ) . For basal Kib - GFP mean 430 fluorescence intensity measurements , single basal optical sections were used ( ~ 7 . 5 - 10μm below 431 the apical surface ) . To quantify changes in pMRLC intensity , mean fluorescence measurements 432 were obtained from single most apical sections . Plots and statistical analyses of mean 433 fluorescence intensities were generated using GraphPad Prism software . 434 To measure changes in apical cell areas under osmotic shifts , cells from Ecad - GFP 435 labeled epithelia were segmented using the Cellpose v1 pre - trained " cytoplasm " model 436 ( Stringer et al . , 2021 ) and tracked via a previously - described tracking algorithm ( Williams 437 14 et al . , 2022 ) . Errors in segmentation and tracking were corrected manually . Only cells that 438 remained in the field of view for the entire timelapse duration were used for quantification . 439 The mean and standard error in cell areas were measured per epithelium . Fold - change in 440 area relative to the start of osmotic shift was plotted using the Matplotlib library in Python . 441 To quantify nuclear / cytoplasmic Yki - YFP , single optical sections were used . Ubi > RFP 442 channel was used to segment the nuclei using Cellpose and a standard Scikit watershed algorithm 443 ( van der Walt et al . , 2014 ) to generate a nuclear mask . The nuclear mask was then applied to Yki - 444 YFP images to extract nuclear Yki - YFP intensities , and the signal outside the nuclear mask was 445 treated as cytoplasmic . The ratios of nuclear to cytoplasmic intensity was then calculated and 446 plotted . 447 Detection of Kibra ubiquitination in S2 cells 448 Kib ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously ( Tokamov et al . , 2021 ) . Briefly , 449 3 . 5 x 10 6 S2 cells ( S2 - DGRC ) were transfected with a total of 500 ng of indicated DNA using 450 dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide ( Sigma ; Han , 1996 ) at 250 mg / ml in six - well plates . 451 pMT - Kib - GFP was co - transfected with pMT - HA - Ub ( Zhang et al . , 2006 ) where indicated to 452 provide labeled ubiquitin . To induce expression of the pMT constructs , 700 mM CuSO4 was 453 added to the wells 24 hr prior to cell lysis ( 2 days after transfection ) . To inhibit proteasomal 454 degradation , 50 mM MG132 ( Cayman Chemical ) and 50 mM calpain inhibitor I ( Sigma Aldrich ) 455 was added 4 hr prior to cell lysis . Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 456 0 . 5 % Na deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , and 25 mM Tris [ 50 mM , pH 7 . 4 ] ) , supplemented with 5 mM 457 N - ethylmaleimide and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , one tablet / 10 ml of buffer ) . 458 HA - tagged ubiquitin was purified using Pierce anti - HA magnetic beads ( clone 2 – 2 . 2 . 14 ) . Lysates 459 and IP samples were run on 8 % polyacrylamide gel and ubiquitinated Kib in the IP samples was 460 detected by Western Blot using anti - GFP antibody ( rabbit , see Table 1 ) . 461 Detection of Kibra phosphorylation in S2 cells 462 pMT - Kib - GFP and pAHW - Par - 1 or pAHW - Par - 1 KD ( gift from Bingwei Lu , Stanford University ) 463 were transfected and expression was induced as described above . Immunoprecipitation ( IP ) was 464 performed 3 days after transfection . To induce expression of pMT - Kib - GFP , 700 mM CuSO4 465 was added to the wells 24 hr prior to cell lysis ( 2 days after transfection ) . 466 Cells were harvested and lysed on ice in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM 467 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid , 0 . 5 mM ethylene glycol - bis ( b - aminoethyl ether ) - N , N , N0 , N0 - 468 tetraacetic acid , 0 . 9 M glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 mM Dithiothreitol , and Complete 469 protease inhibitor ( Roche ) and PhosSTOP ( Sigma Aldrich ) phosphatase inhibitor cocktails at 470 one tablet / 10 ml concentration each . Cell lysates were then incubated with anti - GFP antibody 471 ( guinea pig , see Table 1 ) for 30min . Antibody - bound Kib - GFP was pulled down using Pierce 472 Protein A magnetic beads ( Thermo Scientific ) for 1 . 5h . A control immunoprecipiated sample was 473 treated with λ - phosphatase . Samples were run on 8 % polyacrylamide gel , with 118 : 1 474 acrylamide / bisacrylamide ( Scheid et al . , 1999 ) , to better resolve phosphorylated Kib species . Kib 475 was detected by Western Blot using anti - GFP antibody ( rabbit , see Table 1 ) . 476 15 References 477 Aegerter - Wilmsen , T . , Aegerter , C . M . , Hafen , E . , Basler , K . , 2007 .
