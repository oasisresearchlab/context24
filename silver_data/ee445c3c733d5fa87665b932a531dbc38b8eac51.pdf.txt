Inadditiontolocalactivation , microgliaremotefromtheprimary lesion site are stimulated . Because this so - called secondary activation of microglia is instrumental for long - term changes after neuronal injury , it is important to understand how microglia activity is controlled . The remote activation of microglia implies that the activating signalsaretransportedalongneuronalprojections . However , theidentityofthesesignalshasnotyetbeenidentified . Itisshownherethat glutamate - treatedneuronsrapidlyexpressandreleasethechemokineCCL21 . WealsoprovideevidencethatneuronalCCL21ispackedin vesicles and transported throughout neuronal processes to reach presynaptic structures . Chemotaxis assays show that functional CCL21 is released from endangered neurons and activate microglia via the chemokine receptor CXCR3 . Based on these findings , we suggest that neuronal CCL21 is important in directed neuron – microglia signaling and that this communication could account for the remote activa - tion of microglia , far distant from a primary lesion . Key words : neuron – microglia signaling ; chemokines ; CCL21 ; vesicle release ; apoptosis ; neuroinflammation Introduction Brain lesions can lead to profound changes in the neuronal archi - tecture and influence plasticity phenomena in neurons . Recent results show a significant impact of activated microglia on these lesion - induced long - term changes ( Banati , 2002a ; Beattie et al . , 2002 ; Parish et al . , 2002 ; Monje et al . , 2003 ) . Activated microglia can either inhibit neurogenesis ( Monje et al . , 2003 ) or support neuronal sprouting ( Parish et al . , 2002 ) , showing that microglia activation is a double - edged sword . It is thus of particular interest to understand how microglia activity is controlled . Whenever neurons are injured , microglia are among the first cells in the CNS that become activated ( Kreutzberg , 1996 ) . Microglia activa - tion frequently occurs not only at the primary lesion site but also remote from the primary damage in sites in which the damaged neurons project to ( secondary activation of microglia ) ( Banati , 2002a ) . Thus , microglial activity is likely to be controlled by en - dangered neurons , and the secondary activation of microglia re - quires the transport of microglia activating signals . However , the identity of the molecules involved in this neuron – microglia sig - naling is not yet known . Chemokines and their receptors constitute an elaborate sig - naling system that plays an important role in cell – cell communi - cation not only in the peripheral immune system ( Murphy et al . , 2000 ; Rossi and Zlotnik , 2000 ; Mackay , 2001 ; Moser et al . , 2004 ; Rot and von Andrian , 2004 ) but also in the CNS ( for review , see Ransohoff and Tani , 1998 ; Bacon and Harrison , 2000 ; Bajetto et al . , 2002 ; Biber et al . , 2002a ; Ambrosini and Aloisi , 2004 ) . The expression of most chemokines in the CNS is induced by inflam - matory and neurodegenerative events in which they mediate leu - kocyte infiltration ( Fife et al . , 2000 ; Izikson et al . , 2000 ; Siebert et al . , 2000 ; Huang et al . , 2001 ) . Conversely , the presence of che - mokine receptors in neurons and glia moreover suggests that chemokines also participate in local signaling during CNS in - flammation ( Hesselgesser and Horuk , 1999 ; Biber et al . , 2002b ; Ambrosini and Aloisi , 2004 ) . We have recently provided evidence that damaged neurons upregulate the expression of CCL21 mRNA . Furthermore , we were able to show that CCL21 activates microglia via the chemo - kine receptor CXCR3 ( Biber et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Rappert et al . , 2002 ; Dijkstra et al . , 2004 ) . Subsequent studies showed that mice deficient for CXCR3 displayed no secondary activation of micro - glia in response to enthorinal cortex lesion . Importantly , this lack of secondary microglia activation had profound effects on the neuronal reorganization after the lesion , illustrating the impact of chemokine signaling in the brain ( Rappert et al . , 2004 ) . We here further elucidated the mechanism of neuron – micro - glia signaling with respect to neuronal synthesis and release of CCL21 protein . It is shown here that CCL21 is specifically in - duced and released from neurons that were treated with high concentrations of glutamate ( excitotoxicity ) . Several lines of ev - idence furthermore indicate that CCL21 in neurons is sorted into ReceivedAug . 20 , 2004 ; revisedJuly5 , 2005 ; acceptedJuly7 , 2005 .

NG108 - 15 ( mouse glioma - rat neuroblas - toma ) ( NG108 ) cells and HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM con - taining 10 % fetal calf serum with 0 . 01 % penicillin and 0 . 01 % streptomy - cin in a humidified atmosphere ( 5 % CO 2 ) at 37°C . The differentiation of NG108 cells was induced by changing the medium to DMEM containing 1 % fetal calf serum supplemented with 50 (cid:2) M IBMX . Cultured cortical neurons . Cultures of cortical neurons were estab - lished as described previously ( Biber et al . , 2001 ) . In brief , pregnant mice ( NMRI ) were anesthetized with halothane and killed by cervical disloca - tion , and embryonic day 17 embryos were removed . Cortices were dis - sected in ice - cold HBSS supplemented with 30 % glucose . Meninges were removed , and brain tissues were gently dissociated by trituration in Neu - robasal / B27 medium ( supplemented with 0 . 4 % glucose , 2 m M L - glutamine , 0 . 01 % penicillin , and 0 . 01 % streptomycin ) and filtered through a cell strainer ( 70 (cid:2) m pore size ; Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . After one washing step ( 100 (cid:1) g for 10 min ) , cells were seeded on poly - D - lysine ( 10 (cid:2) g / ml ) - coated glass cover slides and maintained in Neuro - basal / B27 medium for at least 7 d in a humidified atmosphere ( 5 % CO 2 ) at 37°C . To induce CCL21 expression , cells were treated with glutamate ( 100 (cid:2) M , 30 min ) as described previously ( Biber et al . , 2001 ) . To increase CCL21 immune reactivity , cells were treated in some experiments with 10 (cid:2) g / ml BFA 1 h before fixation . Cultured microglia . Microglia cultures from wild - type animals and CXCR3 - deficient mice were established as described previously ( Biber et al . , 2001 ; Rappert et al . , 2002 ) . In brief , mouse cortex was dissected from newborn mouse pups ( (cid:2) 1 d ) . Brain tissue was gently dissociated by trituration in PBS and filtered through a cell strainer ( 70 (cid:2) m pore size ; Falcon ) into DMEM . After two washing steps ( 200 (cid:1) g for 10 min ) , cells were seeded in culture dishes ( 10 cm diameter ; Nunc , Roskilde , Den - mark ) ( 8 (cid:1) 10 6 cells per dish ) . Cultures were maintained 6 weeks in DMEMcontaining10 % fetalcalfserumwith0 . 01 % penicillinand0 . 01 % streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere ( 5 % CO 2 ) at 37°C . Culture medium was changed the second day after preparation and every 6 d thereafter . Floating microglia were harvested from confluent mixed as - trocyte cultures , counted , and used for chemotaxis assays . CXCR3 - deficient mice were obtained from Bao Lu and Craig Gerard ( Children’s Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . Preparation of organotypic slice cultures Organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared from brains of 1 - to 3 - d - old mouse pups under sterile conditions . After decapitation , brains were quickly removed and further dissected in ice - cold HBSS . Hippocampi from both hemispheres were dissected and sectioned perpendicular to their septotemporal axis at 400 (cid:2) m thickness by a tissue chopper ( McIl - wain ) . Slices were separated and transferred onto humidified mem - branes of cell culture inserts ( Millicell - CM ; Millipore , Bedford , MA ) . Slicesfromleftandrighthemispheresofoneanimalwereputonseparatemembranes . These membranes , containing four to six slices , were placed in a six - well plate containing 1 ml of culture medium ( 0 . 5 (cid:1) MEM , 25 % basal medium Eagle without glutamine , 25 % heat - inactivated horse se - rum , 2 m M glutamax , 0 . 65 % glucose , 0 . 01 % penicillin , and 0 . 01 % strep - tomycin ) perwell . Sliceswereincubatedinahumidifiedatmosphere ( 5 % CO 2 ) at 35°C . Medium was refreshed the next day after preparation and subsequently every 2 d . After 8 d in vitro , one cell culture insert contain - ing slices from one hemisphere of an animal was placed in medium containing 100 (cid:2) M glutamate , whereas the other insert remained in nor - mal culture medium . After 30 min of glutamate exposure , medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh culture medium . Slices were kept in culture for another 8 h and subsequently fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde before immunohistochemistry . Transfection of cells NG108 and HEK293 cells . A total of 1 (cid:2) g of the plasmid was transfected with 3 (cid:2) l of Fugene ( Roche ) in NG108 or HEK293 cells according to the instructions of the manufacturer . The expression plasmid for mCXCR3 ( pcDNA3 . 1 - mCXCR3 ) wasdescribedrecently ( Dijkstraetal . , 2004 ) , and the expression plasmid for mCCR7 ( pRC / CMV - mCCR7 ) was a kind gift from Dr . U . Hoekpen and Dr . M . Lipp ( Max - Delbru¨ck - Centrumfu¨r Molekulare Medizin , Berlin , Germany ) . Mock transfections were per - formed with empty pEGFP - N2 vector . Cortical neurons . Primary cortical neurons were transfected using the nucleofector technology ( Amaxa , Cologne , Germany ) . The 5 (cid:1) 10 6 cells were diluted directly after preparation in 100 (cid:2) l of mouse neuronal stem cell nucleofector solution supplemented with 5 (cid:2) g of plasmid DNA ( CCL21 - EGFPorcontrol ) andtransfectedwithprogramO - 05according to the instructions of the supplier . Cells were immediately transferred to prewarmedculturemediumaftertransfectionandseededoncoatedcov - erslips . Nonattached cells were washed away 2 h after transfection , and neurons were further cultivated as described above . This transfection procedure yielded efficiency up to 40 % , and transfected neurons re - mainedhealthyanddevelopedcomparablytonontransfectedcells . Mock transfections were performed with empty pEGFP - N2 vector . Real - time PCR analysis of CCL21 mRNA levels in cultured neurons Cells and brain material were Lysol in guanidinium isothiocyanate / mer - captoethanol buffer , and total RNA was extracted and transcribed into cDNA as described previously ( Biber et al . , 2001 ) . Primers were designed using Primer Designer version 3 . 0 . CCL21 primer sequences were as follows : forward , 5 (cid:3) - CAGGACTGCTGCCTTAAGTA - 3 ; reverse , 5 (cid:3) - GCACATAGCTCAGGCTTAGA - 3 (cid:3) . Hydroxymethylbilane synthase ( HBMS ) primer sequences were as follows : forward , 5 (cid:3) - CCGAGC - CAAGGACCAGGATA - 3 (cid:3) ; reverse , 5 (cid:3) - CTCCTTCCAGGTGCCTCAGA - 3 (cid:3) . HMBS was used as a normalizing gene because its expression re - mained stable under various experimental conditions . Experiments were done in 25 (cid:2) l , using iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and primer concentrations of 250 nmol in 96 - well plates in an i - cycler ( Bio - Rad ) . The reaction conditions were as follows : 3 min at 95°C , fol - lowed by 50 cycles of 10 s at 95°C and 45 s at 58°C , followed by 1 min at 95°Candby1minat55°C . Thecomparativecyclethreshold ( Ct ) method [ amount of target amplicon X in sample S , normalized to a reference R and related to a control sample C , calculated by 2 - { ( CtX , S - CtR , S ) - ( CtX , C - CtR , C ) } was used to determine the relative CCL21 mRNA ex - pression levels between cultured neurons under control conditions and treated with glutamate for various time points ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) ] . Construction of the CCL21 - EGFP fusion protein CCL21 was coupled to EGFP by cloning into pEGFP - N2 ( Clontech ) . Full - length CCL21 was amplified using cDNA from mouse spleen with the following primers : forward , 5 (cid:3) - ATA CTC GAG ATG GCT CAG ATG ATG ACT CTG AGC CTC ; reverse , 5 (cid:3) - ATA GGA TCC ATC CTC TTG AGG GCT GTG TCT GTT C . These primers introduced a Xho I restric - tion site at the 5 (cid:3) end and a Bam HI restriction site at the 3 (cid:3) end of CCL21 deJongetal . • CCL21ExpressioninEndangeredNeurons J .

The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCRII ( Clontech ) by TA cloning , and the insert was verified by sequencing . A total of 5 (cid:2) g of the resulting vector , pCRII ( CCL21 - stop ) , was restricted with Bam HI ( Promega ) and Xho I ( Promega ) , and the excised band was purified using gel electrophoresis and gel purification ( MinElute Gel Extraction kit ; Qiagen , Hilden , Ger - many ) andsubsequentlyclonedintothe Bam HI / Xho IsitesofpEGFP - N2 ( Clontech ) . Again , sequence and the orientation of the insert were veri - fied by sequencing . Transfection of HEK293 cells was performed as de - scribed above . Mock transfections were performed with empty pEFGP - N2 . A Zeiss ( Oberkochen , Germany ) Axioscope 2 or a Leica ( Nussloch , Germany ) confocal laser microscope were used to analyze the expression of the CCL21 - EGFP construct in transfected cells . Immunocytochemistry Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously ( Biber et al . , 2001 ) . In brief , before immunocytochemical processing , cells or cul - tured brain slices were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed in 0 . 9 % saline dissolved in 0 . 05 M Tris , pH 7 . 4 ( TBS ) . All antisera were diluted in TBS containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , and heparin ( 5 mg / ml ) . Cells were preincubated in 5 % BSA in TBS for 30 min and incubated overnight with CCL21 , caspase - 3 , NeuN , or MAP - 2 antibodies . Antibody – antigen reactions were either detected using the biotin – streptavidin method and the complex was vi - sualized with diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) / H 2 O 2 or visualized with a Cy3 - or Cy5 - labeled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody for fluorescence mi - croscopy . Control experiments for all immunocytochemical stainings were done by incubating cells or cultured brain slices with an isotype - matched primary antibody against GFAP ( Chemicon ) or in the absence of primary antibodies . Western blot analysis Western blot was performed as described previously ( Baron et al . , 2000 ) . Briefly , neuronal cultures were harvested in PBS , solubilized in sample buffer , and subjected to SDS - PAGE . Equal amounts of proteins ( 40 (cid:2) g ) were loaded onto 12 . 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond - ECL nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham Biosciences , Arling - tonHeights , IL ) . Themembraneswereblockedwith10 % nonfatdrymilk in PBS and incubated with the primary antibody ( CCL21 at 1 : 2000 ; (cid:1) - actin at 1 : 2000 ) overnight , followed by 2 h incubation with the appro - priate horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) . Specific bands were visualized by ECL for (cid:1) - actin or ECLplus Western blotting Detection System for CCL21 . A total of 125 pg of re - combinant CCL21 was used as a positive control . Gold – silver - substituted peroxidase intensification and electron microscopy EM immunocytochemistry for the ultrastructural detection of CCL21 was performed on cultured cortical neurons using a biotinylated second - ary antibody and the Vectastain ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlin - game , CA ) with DAB as the chromogen . Subsequently , intensification of the DAB reaction product was effec - tuated using the gold – silver - substituted peroxidase ( GSSP ) method ( Liem et al . , 2001 ) . In brief , after completing the DAB reaction , the cells wererinsedtwicein2 % sodiumacetatesolution . Afterdestainingin10 % thioglycolic acid , the cells were immersed for 8 min in a freshly prepared physical developer containing 2 . 5 % sodium carbonate , 0 . 1 % ammo - nium nitrate , 0 . 1 % silver nitrate , 0 . 5 % phosphosilico - tungstic acid , and 0 . 9 % paraformaldehyde . After a brief wash with 1 % acetic acid , the de - posited silver particles were replaced by gold by immersing the cells in 0 . 02 % gold chloride for 8 min at room temperature . Subsequently , they were fixed for two times at 10 min with 3 % sodium thiosulphate , rinsed briefly in 0 . 1 M sodium acetate cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 6 , and were then osmicated in 1 % OsO 4 ( w / v ) and 1 . 5 % potassium hexacyanoferrate in thesamebuffer , dehydratedinagradedseriesofethanols , andembedded in Epon . Semithin sections ( 1 (cid:2) m ) were cut on a Reichert Ultratome and stained with toluidine blue to check the presence of relevant areas . Ultra - thin sections ( 60 nm ) were then cut , counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined using a Philips ( Aachen , Germany ) CM - 100 transmission electron microscope . Chemotaxis assay Cell migration in response to neuronal supernatants or chemokines was assessedusinga48 - wellchemotaxismicrochamber ( NeuroProbe , Gaith - ersburg , MD ) as described previously ( Dijkstra et al . , 2004 ) . Chemokine stock solutions were prepared in PBS and further diluted in neuronal medium for use in the assay . Culture medium without chemokines served as a control in the assay . A total of 28 (cid:2) l of neuronal supernatants , the chemoattractant solution , or control mediumwas added to the lower wells , lower and upper wells were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone - free polycarbonate filter ( 8 (cid:2) m pore size ) , and 1 . 5 (cid:1) 10 4 microglial cells or 3 (cid:1) 10 4 transfected HEK293 cells ( mock , mCXCR3 or mCCR7 ) were appliedperwell ( 50 (cid:2) l ) intheupperchamber . Determinationsweredone six times . The chamber was incubated at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere for 120 min in case of microglia and 240 min in case of HEK293 cells . At the end of incubation , the filter was washed , fixed in methanol , and stained with toluidine blue . Migrated cells were counted with a scored eyepiece , and data are presented as percentages of control migration . To prevent bias , chemotaxis filters were occasionally counted by blinded investigators . Analysis of CCL21 - positive axons in organotypic brain cultures Only slices that showed an intact hippocampal structure [ recognizable dentategyrus ( DG ) andCAregion ] wereanalyzed . Thus , 14controlslices and 17 slices from six animals were evaluated . CCL21 - positive processes were counted in the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus and the CA regions in three microscopic fields ( 10 (cid:1) 20 ) . For each animal , the amount of CCL21 - positive axons after glutamate treatment was calcu - latedasthepercentageofCCL21 - positiveprocessesinthenonstimulated slices obtained from the same animal . Statistical analysis StatisticalanalysisandcomparisonofthedifferentgroupswasperformedusingwithStudents’ t test for CCL21 mRNA expression and CCL21 - positive axons in organotypic brain cultures and with the Tukey’s ANOVA test for multiple comparisons for the chemotaxis data ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) . A significance level of 0 . 05 was used . Results Time - and concentration - dependent induction of CCL21 expression in neurons after treatment with glutamate Previous studies have shown that glutamate treatment rapidly induces expression of CCL21 mRNA in cultured cortical neurons ( Biber et al . , 2001 ) . Here we analyzed the expression of CCL21 protein in neurons exposed to glutamate . Glutamate treatment is a well known inducer of excitotoxicity and subsequent neuronal death ( Chapman et al . , 2000 ) . This was also found in our cultures as investigated by nuclear stainings , vital stainings , and caspase - 3 immunocytochemistry . These data indicated that glutamate treatment caused gradual neuronal death , leading to 80 % neuro - nal death after 24 h in response to 30 min glutamate treatment ( 100 (cid:2) M ) ( data not shown ) . Using immunocytochemistry , CCL21 protein expression was undetectable in neurons under control culture conditions ( Fig . 1 A ) . Weak CCL21 immunoreactivity ( visualized by DAB stain - ing ) was induced in cortical neurons 16 h after treatment with glutamate ( 100 (cid:2) M , 30 min ) ( Fig . 1 B , arrows ) . Similar results were obtained using fluorescent labeling ( data not shown ) . How - ever , compared with spleen tissue , used as a positive control to validate the CCL21 antibody ( data not shown ) , the staining in - tensity in cultured neurons was rather weak . Previous studies in dendritic cells showed an increase in chemokine staining inten - sity that was achieved by BFA treatment . BFA leads to intracellu - lar accumulation of proteins that are released through the Golgi endoplasmatic route ( Dinter and Berger , 1998 ; Lore et al . , 2001 ) . Similar effects were observed for accumulation of CCL21 in glutamate - treated neurons . Brief BFA treatment ( 30 min ) was already sufficient to increase CCL21 staining , and a maximal ef - 7550 • J . Neurosci . , August17 , 2005 • 25 ( 33 ) : 7548 – 7557 deJongetal . • CCL21ExpressioninEndangeredNeurons fect was found after 1 h of BFA treatment ( Fig . 1 C ) . Longer treat - ment with BFA ( up to 3 h ) did not further increase neuronal CCL21 staining ( data not shown ) . Another option to increase the sensitivity of immunostaining is GSSP intensification . Because of the intensification of the signal , CCL21 expression was now de - tectable by light microscopy in semithin sections ( 1 (cid:2) m ) without BFA incubation and was already evident in untreated healthy neurons ( Fig . 1 D ) . Again , it was found that glutamate treatment strongly increased the expression of neuronal CCL21 ( Fig . 1 E , F ) . At lower magnification , CCL21 expression was visible in the ma - jority of the cells , in which CCL21 immunoreactivity was located in the soma and the processes ( Fig . 1 F ) . Thus , CCL21 expression was detectable in untreated neurons ( albeit in very low expres - sion levels ) and is induced by treatment with glutamate . To further investigate the effect of glutamate treatment in detail , subsequent experiments have been performed in the pres - ence of BFA ( 30 min ) , and CCL21 expression has been deter - mined by immunofluorescence ( Figs . 2 , 3 B ) . A low level of CCL21 staining was detectable in untreated cortical neurons ( Fig . 2 A , B ) . A time - dependent increase in neuronal CCL21 expres - sion was induced by 30 min treatment with 100 (cid:2) M glutamate ( Fig . 2 C – F ) . Low levels of CCL21 were detected already 3 h after glutamate treatment ( Fig . 2 C ) , and the level of CCL21 increased upto12h ( Fig . 2 D , E ) . Atlatertimepoints , noadditionalincrease of neuronal CCL21 expression was detected ( Fig . 2 F ) . The ex - pression of CCL21 in glutamate - treated neurons was further in - vestigated by Western blotting . Again , BFA treatment was used to increase the intracellular concentration of CCL21 in glutamate - treated neurons . Thus , using BFA , we detected a band for CCL21 in neurons 12 h after the treatment with glutamate ( Fig . 2 G ) . At earlier time points , we never obtained a band for CCL21 on the Western blot even with BFA treatment ( data not shown ) . As a positive control for the Western blot , recombinant CCL21 was used ( Fig . 2 G ) . Subsequent real - time PCR analysis revealed an induction of CCL21 mRNA 2 – 6 h after glutamate treatment ( Fig . 2 H ) , which was not detectable at later time points ( data not shown ) . Real - time PCR occasionally revealed the expression of CCL21 mRNA even in untreated cultures , which was found in three of seven independent experiments ( data not shown ) . The level of CCL21 expression was dependent on the concen - tration of glutamate . No or little CCL21 induction was observed after exposure to 1 or 10 (cid:2) M glutamate ( data not shown ) , but a pronounced CCL21 induction was found using 100 (cid:2) M gluta - mate ( Fig . 2 ) . Higher glutamate concentrations ( up to 1 m M ) did not further increase neuronal CCL21 expression ( data not shown ) . Glutamate treatment induced expression of CCL21 in (cid:4) 80 % of the neurons [ Fig . 3 , compare nuclear staining ( A , blue ) and CCL21 immunoreactivity ( B , green ) ] . Most cells were posi - tive for CC21 ( exemplified by arrowheads ) , whereas only few cells did not show CCL21 expression ( exemplified by small ar - row ) . As can be estimated from Figure 2 , glutamate treatment did not induce a significant increase in the number of CCL21 - positive cells ; thus , at 2 h after the treatment , (cid:4) 70 – 80 % of the neurons showed CCL21 immunoreactivity ( Fig . 2 ) . CCL21 im - munoreactivity was often observed at the axonal hillock ( Fig . 3 B , arrowheads ) . To investigate whether this observation might be attributable to an artifact induced by BFA , CCL21 immunoreac - tivity was analyzed in more detail using confocal microscopy without BFA incubation . Here , numerous CCL21 - positive vesicle - like structures at the axonal hillock and in axon - like pro - cesses of glutamate - treated neurons were observed ( Fig . 3 C ) . CCL21 in neurons is sorted in vesicle - like structures Our observations indicated that CCL21 in neurons might be sorted into vesicles and transported into axons : first , treatment with BFA enhanced the staining for CCL21 , indicating that this chemokine is released via the Golgi and trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) route ( Fig . 1 ) . Second , expression of CCL21 in cultured neurons was frequently detected in axon - like structures ( Fig . 1 ) . Third , accumulation of CCL21 immunoreactivity was often ob - served at the axonal hillock , which is the site at which axonal transport starts ( Fig . 3 , arrowheads ) . Finally , confocal analysis revealed the presence of CCL21 - positive vesicle - like structures in the soma and the processes of neurons ( Fig . 3 ) . These data prompted us to further investigate the sorting of CCL21 using an expression vector for a CCL21 - EGFP fusion pro - tein . Cytoplasmic expression was observed when EGFP alone was transfected into HEK293 cells ( data not shown ) . Expression of Figure 1 . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the expression of CCL21 protein in cul - turedcorticalneurons .

Thestainingintensity for CCL21 in glutamate - treated neurons was increased after pretreatment with BFA ( 10 (cid:2) g / ml ) , acompoundthatblocksthereleaseofproteinsfromtheGolgi – TGN ( C ) . Anothermethodto increase the staining sensitivity is GSSP intensification . Semithin sections ( 1 (cid:2) m ) of cultured neuronswereanalyzedforCCL21expressionafterGSSPintensificationbylightmicroscopy . In contrast to our standard method , CCL21 expression was now detectable in untreated cultures ( arrowheads , D ) . Again , treatmentwithglutamate ( 100 (cid:2) M , 30min ) pronouncedlyinducedthe expression of CCL21 in these cells ( arrowheads , E ) .

Similar results were obtained in the mouse neuroblastoma - rat glioma cell line NG - 108 - 15 . Again , staining of the Golgi and TGN was observed when CCL21 - EGPF was expressed in undifferentiated NG - 108 - 15 cells ( Fig . 4 B , arrowheads ) . This pattern , however , changed when the cells were differentiated into neuron - like cells . In these cells , CCL21 - EGFP fluorescence was still observed in the Golgi and TGN ( small arrow ) but could furthermore be visualizedinthedevelopingprocesses ( Fig . 4 C , arrowheads ) . At later time points of differentiation , CCL21 - EGFP - positive vesicle - like structures were found at the most distant sites of the cellular processes ( Fig . 4 D ) . Experiments with primary cultured neurons confirmed these findings . Con - trol transfections with an EGFP - containing plasmid showed that (cid:4) 40 % of the MAP - 2 - positive neurons ( red fluores - cence ) were transfected ( green fluores - cence ) ( Fig . 4 E ) . These control transfec - tions showed a general , cytoplasmic expression of EFGP in the soma and pro - cesses of primary neurons ( Fig . 4 E ) . Ex - pression of the CCL21 - EGFP fusion pro - tein resulted in a different pattern . Numerous small CCL21 - EGFP - positive vesicle - like structures ( green fluorescence ; arrowheads ) were observed in the soma andintheprocessesoftheMAP - 2 - positive neurons ( Fig . 4 F , red fluorescence ) . The CCL21 - EGFP - positive vesicle - like struc - tures were also detected in long axon - like processes far away from the soma of the neurons ( Fig . 4 G , arrowheads ) . Ultrastructural evidence for neuronal CCL21 - positive vesicles The use of an expression plasmid might create artifacts because of the overexpression of the protein of interest . Itwasthereforedecidedtofurtherinvestigatethecellular localization of endogenous CCL21 in neurons by electron mi - croscopy and GSSP intensification . At the ultrastructural level , CCL21 was detected in small vesicles in the Golgi and TGN ( ar - rowheads ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . CCL21 - positive vesicles were moreover found in axon - like processes of the cells ( data not shown ) and in presynaptic structures ( Fig . 5 B , arrowheads ) . CCL21 immunore - activity was also detected in the synaptic cleft ( Fig . 5 C , arrowheads ) . Neuronal expression of CCL21 in organotypic slice cultures The pattern of neuronal CCL21 expression was further investi - gated in organotypic slices of the hippocampus that maintain their natural structure and neuronal circuitry ( Gaehwiler et al . , 1997 ) . To verify the organotypic structure , hippocampal cultures were stained after 8 d in culture for nuclei ( Hoechst dye , blue signal ) and axons ( MAP - 2 antibody , green signal ) ( Fig . 6 A ) . The overlay of both stainings clearly demonstrated that the typical hippocampal formation with CA1 , CA3 , and DG was still present in the slice ( Fig . 6 A ) . After 8 d in culture under control condi - tions , some CCL21 - positive cells were present in the slices ( data not shown ) . Like in cultured neurons , treatment with glutamate ( 100 (cid:2) M , 30 min ) significantly increased the number of CCL21 - positive cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . Counting of the number of CCL21 - positive cells ( as described in Materials and Methods ) revealed an induction by 170 (cid:5) 13 % in glutamate - treated slices ( n (cid:6) 17 ) compared with untreated slices ( n (cid:6) 14 ) . Strikingly , CCL21 ex - pression was mainly observed in long processes ( Fig . 6 B , arrow - head ) . Double - labeling experiments and confocal microscopy corroborated these data . Costaining for NeuN ( green fluores - cence ) and CCL21 ( red fluorescence ) revealed that numerous neuronal cell bodies were also positive for CCL21 ( Fig . 6 C , yellow signal , thin arrows ) .

Serial pic - tures taken in the Z - direction clearly showed that these CCL21 - positive processes always belonged to NeuN - positive neurons ( data not shown ) . Conversely , when neurons were stained for the axonal marker MAP - 2 ( green fluorescence ) together with CCL21 ( red fluorescence ) , it was found that most axons showed double labeling ( Fig . 6 D , thin arrows , yellow signal ) . Only few axons were found solely positive for MAP - 2 ( Fig . 6 D , arrowheads , green staining ) . Thus , CCL21 expression in organotypic brain slicecultureswasclearlylocatedinneuronalcellbodiesandaxon - like processes . Microglia and recombinant cells expressing CXCR3 or CCR7 migrate in response to supernatant from glutamate - treated neuronal cultures In previous publications , it was shown that microglia respond to recombinant CCL21 via the chemokine receptor CXCR3 ( Biber et al . , 2001 ; Rappert et al . , 2002 ) . Because our data indicate that CCL21 is expressed in glutamate - treated neurons and most likely released , we investigated whether microglia would respond to supernatant of glutamate - treated neurons . Chemotaxis experi - ments confirmed previous data that microglia significantly mi - grated in response to CCL21 ( 1 n M ) ( Fig . 7 A ) . Significant migra - tion of microglia was also observed with supernatant ( harvested 16 h after the treatment ) from neurons that were treated with 1 , 10 , and 100 (cid:2) M glutamate ( Fig . 7 A ) . The most pronounced effect was observed with supernatant from neurons that were treated with 100 (cid:2) M glutamate ( Fig . 7 A ) . Thus , 100 (cid:2) M glutamate was used in additional experiments . Microglia already migrated sig - nificantly toward supernatants from cultured neurons that were harvested 2 h after the treatment ( Fig . 7 B ) . Supernatants taken from neuronal cultures at longer time points after the glutamate treatment induced even higher microglial migration ( Fig . 7 B ) . Importantly , a significant reduction of the migration toward neuronal supernatants was observed in microglia cultured from CXCR3 - deficient mice , indicating the importance of CCL21 - CXCR3 signaling for this microglial behavior ( Fig . 7 B ) . Be - cause CXCR3 - deficient microglia still showed migration , it is indicated that glutamate treatment induced also the release of Figure3 .

It was furthermore shown by Chapman et al . ( 2000 ) that pretreatment with MK - 801 [ ( (cid:7) ) - 5 - methyl - 10 , 11 - dihydro - 5 H - dibenzo [ a , d ] cyclohepten - 5 , 10 - imine maleate ] in - hibited the glutamate - induced CX3CL1 cleavage , andtheyconcludedthattherelease of CX3CL1 was attributable to glutamate - induced neurotoxicity . We describe here similar effects for CCL21 because our find - ingsshowedthatblockingtheeffectofgluta - mate by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK - 801completelyabolishedthemigration of cultured microglia toward neuronal su - pernatants ( Fig . 7 C ) . Thus , inhibiting neu - rotoxicity abolished the release of microglia attractants by neurons . ELISA analyses were performed to fur - ther verify the presence of CCL21 in the supernatants of glutamate - treated neu - rons . Low concentrations of CCL21 have been obtained in neuronal supernatants 24 h after the treatment with glutamate . The measured values , however , were not significantly above the detection limit ( 0 . 1 n M ) of the used ELISA assay and were therefore not reliable ( data not shown ) . Thus , to further verify the specific activity of CCL21 in neuronal supernatant , a pharmacological approach was per - formed using HEK293 cells expressing the two currently known chemokine re - ceptors for CCL21 , CXCR3 , and CCR7 . We demonstrated previously that CXCR3 - transfected HEK293 cells migrate in re - sponse to recombinant CCL21 , making CCL21theonlyyetknownchemokinethatactivatesCXCR3andCCR7 ( Dijkstra et al . , 2004 ) . A significant and comparable migration of both CXCR3 - and CCR7 - expressing HEK293 cells was observed in response to supernatants from glutamate - treated neurons , whereas mock - transfected HEK293 cells did not show any migratory response ( Fig . 7 D ) . Expression of the other CCR7 ligand CCL19 in neuronal cultures was never detected ( reverse transcription - PCR experiments , data not shown ) . To - gether , from these data , it is strongly sug - gested that the migration of microglia and chemokine receptor - transfected HEK293 cells is evoked by the presence of CCL21 in neuronal supernatants . Discussion Although the CNS has long been considered an immune - privileged site , it is very clear today that the brain is capable of mounting an inflammatory response . There is furthermore sub - stantial evidence that brain inflammation is a double - edged sword . Controlled and well balanced , it significantly contributes to protection and repair strategies . Excessive or chronic inflam - mation , conversely , can lead to additional damage of the sur - rounding tissue and is now considered to be a hallmark in all neurodegenerative diseases ( Morganti - Kossmann et al . , 2002 ; Olsson et al . , 2003 ) . Microglia , the sentinels of the CNS , are key players in brain in - flammation because these cells are activated in response to any type of neuronal damage ( Kreutzberg , 1996 ; Raivich et al . , 1999 ) . It is known that activation of these cells may lead to either a neuropro - Figure 5 .

Furthermore , activated micro - glia have been shown to be instrumental for long - term changes in responsetobrainlesions ( Banati , 2002a , b ; Beattieetal . , 2002 ; Parish et al . , 2002 ; Monje et al . , 2003 ) . Healthy neurons most likely suppress microglia activity In turn , microglia activity is most likely controlled by neurons ( Bruce - Keller , 1999 ; Streit et al . , 1999 ; Neumann , 2001 ; Streit , 2002 ) . It has been demonstrated that myosin heavy chain II ex - pression in microglia is suppressed by neuronal activity ( Neu - mann et al . , 1996 ) or by stimulation with the neurotrophins NGF or neurotrophin 4 ( Neumann et al . , 1998 ) . Molecules that are constitutively expressed in the membranes of healthy neurons , such as CD200 or CX3CL1 , are moreover known to inhibit mi - croglia activity ( Hoek et al . , 2000 ; Zujovic et al . , 2000 ) , and , re - cently , asolubleneuronalprotein ( CD22 ) hasbeendescribedthat inhibits cytokine release in microglia ( Mott et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , these findings suggest that healthy , normal functioning neurons suppress microglia activation . CCL21 , a signal from endangered neurons to activate microglia In contrast to the neuronal signals that keep microglia quiescent , currently not much is known about how endangered neurons activate surrounding microglia . We have recently described that various neurotoxic treatments lead to rapid induction of CCL21 mRNA in damaged neurons in vitro and in vivo ( Biber et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , we were able to demonstrate that CXCR3 is the primary receptor for CCL21 in microglia ( Biber et al . , 2001 ; Rappert et al . , 2002 ; Dijkstra et al . , 2004 ) . Accordingly , a function of CCL21 in the signaling between endangered neurons and mi - croglia was proposed ( Biber et al . , 2002a ) . Our new findings on CCL21 expression and processing in neurons corroborate this assumption . Weak CCL21 expression in neuronal cultures under control conditions was most likely attributable to the rather stressful culture environment that can - not be compared with the situation in healthy brain . Even higher expression of neuronal CCL21 protein was rapidly inducible by glutamate treatment , a well known neurotoxic condition ( Chap - man et al . , 2000 ) . It is therefore assumed that the expression of CCL21 is a marker for neuronal stress . If CCL21 acts as a signaling molecule between damaged neu - rons and microglia , one has to assume that it is released from neurons . CCL21 was found in the Golgi and TGN when ex - pressed in HEK293 or NG108 cells . In neurons , BFA treatment increased the intensity of CCL21 staining , and CCL21 - positive vesicles were observed in the Golgi apparatus of these cells , sup - porting the involvement of the Golgi and TGN in the release of neuronal CCL21 . Whereas in hematopoietic cells chemokines are most likely released via the specialized secretory lysosome ( Grif - fith , 1996 ; Lacy et al . , 1999 ; Andrews , 2000 ) , this is not likely to occur in neuronal cells . Furthermore , our observation of Golgi and TGN involvement shows that CCL21 does not belong to the family of leaderless secretory cytokines , such as interleukin - 1 (cid:1) , that do not use the classical release pathway ( Rubartelli et al . , 1990 ) . In neurons , two different release pathways , the constitu - tive and the regulated secretory pathways , have been described ( Gerber and Sudhof , 2002 ) . The TGN is discussed to be the or - ganelle in which it is decided through which pathway a protein is released ( for review , see Tekirian , 2002 ; Ponnambalam and Bald - win , 2003 ) . However , it is not known yet which of the two release pathways is used for the secretion of CCL21 from neurons . Still , our results clearly show that the supernatants of glutamate - treated neurons attracted cultured microglia and that this re - sponse is primarily dependent on the expression of CXCR3 in these cells . Moreover , HEK293 cells expressing either CXCR3 or CCR7 responded to neuronal supernatants with migration . Be - cause CCL21 is the only yet known chemokine that can activate these two receptors , it is indicated that CCL21 released from stressed neurons is functional and can induce significant cellular responses . However , it is not clear yet why we did not find reliable concentrations of CCL21 by ELISA analysis , although neuronal supernatants induced a comparable migration because it was found with 1 n M recombinant CCL21 . One explanation might be that CCL21 released from neurons is processed in a way that it is not longer recognized by the antibodies in the ELISA assay . Al - ternatively , neuronal CCL21 might act in synergism with other factors , thereby increasing its potency and enabling cellular re - sponses at very low concentrations . Both processing of chemo - kines and heterodimerization has already been described for chemokines ( for review , see Fernandez and Lolis , 2002 ) . Experi - ments to investigate the structure of neuronal CCL21 by mass spectrometry are therefore in preparation in our laboratory . A role of CCL21 for neuroinflammatory signaling distant from a neuronal lesion CCL21 - positive vesicle - like structures were detected in neuronal processes , and they were also found at the endings of these pro - Figure7 .

Ultrastructural evidence furthermore indicated that CCL21 - positive vesicles were transported into presynaptic struc - tures , and we even detected CCL21 immunoreactivity in the syn - aptic cleft . These findings are interesting in view of the fact that microglia activation can be observed at distant sites from a pri - mary neuronal lesion ( Kreutzberg , 1996 ; Bechmann and Nitsch , 2000 ; Cagnin et al . , 2001 ; Banati , 2002a , b ) . Injury of the substan - tia nigra pars compacta ( SNpc ) , for example , leads to secondary activation of microglia in the dorsal striatum ( caudate - putamen ) , in places in which the neurons coming from the SNpc project to . Recent results clearly show that this glial activity is beneficial and promotes sprouting and regeneration in response to the lesion ( Parish et al . , 2002 ) . Although it has long been known that secondary microglia activity can be observed remote from the primary lesion site , it could not be explained how the signal that activates microglia reaches the distant site . Our obser - vations concerning the expression , distribution , and release by endangered neurons of CCL21 would offer an explanation for this yet unsolved problem . Is CCL21 specific for neuron – microglia communication ? We and others have never been able to demonstrate expression of CCL21 in any glial cell type in vitro or in vivo ( Biber et al . , 2001 ; Alt et al . , 2002 ; Columba - Cabezas et al . , 2003 ) . This is rather astonishing because glial cells are a major cellular source of che - mokine release in brain . Thus , CCL21 is the only chemokine detected , so far , that is specifically expressed in endangered neurons . Microglia are not the only cells in brain that express the CCL21 receptor CXCR3 . It has been shown recently that CXCR3 is also expressed in astrocytes and neurons ( Xia et al . , 2000 ; Biber et al . , 2002 ; Sui et al . , 2004 ; Vlkolinsky et al . , 2004 ) . However , functional responses in these studies have only been elicited with CXCL10 , the originally identified CXCR3 ligand . In none of these studies was CCL21 demonstrated to be a functional ligand for astrocytic or neuronal CXCR3 . Furthermore , we have shown re - cently that activation of human CXCR3 by CCL21 is predomi - nately achievable when this receptor is expressed in microglia but notinothercelltypes ( Dijkstraetal . , 2004 ) . Nexttothis , wecould demonstrate that , in the absence of CXCR3 , microglial activation was prevented after brain damage , whereas astrogliosis was indis - tinguishable from the wild - type situation . This suggests that the lack of CXCR3 has a greater impact on the activation of microglia than on other cell types ( Rappert et al . , 2004 ) . It is thus tempting to speculate that CCL21 released from neurons would only be detected by microglia , thus yielding a highly specific and effective neuron to microglia signaling . In summary , the chemokine CCL21 is synthesized specifically in endangered , glutamate - treated neurons and is transported along axons and subsequently released . Clearly , CCL21 is in - volved in the signaling between endangered neurons and micro - glia cells , supporting the concept that neurons actively contribute to the onset of inflammation in the brain . We suggest that the activity of CCL21 serves to activate microglia at distance from the primary lesion .
