Vega * Department of Translational Science and Molecular Medicine , College of Human Medicine , Michigan State University , Grand Rapids , MI , USA EFhd2 is a conserved calcium binding protein linked to different neurological disorders and types of cancer . Although , EFhd2 is more abundant in neurons , it is also found in other cell types . The physiological function of this novel protein is still unclear , but it has been shown in vitro to play a role in calcium signaling , apoptosis , actin cytoskeleton , and regulation of synapse formation . Recently , EFhd2 was shown to promote cell motility by modulating the activity of Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA . Although , EFhd2’s role in promoting cell invasion and metastasis is of great interest in cancer biology , this review focusses on the evidence that links EFhd2 to Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) and other neurological disorders . Altered expression of EFhd2 has been documented in AD , Parkinson’s disease , Huntington’s disease , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , and schizophrenia , indicating that Efhd2 gene expression is regulated in response to neuropathological processes . However , the speciﬁc role that EFhd2 plays in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders is still poorly understood . Recent studies demonstrated that EFhd2 has structural characteristics similar to amyloid proteins found in neurological disorders . Moreover , EFhd2 co - aggregates and interacts with known neuropathological proteins , such as tau , C9orf72 , and Lrrk2 . These results suggest that EFhd2 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases . Therefore , the understanding of EFhd2’s role in health and disease could lead to decipher molecular mechanisms that become activated in response to neuronal stress and degeneration . Keywords : EFhd2 , tau , neurodegenerative disease , neurological disorders , Alzheimer’s disease INTRODUCTION Efhd2 gene codes for a 26 . 8 kDa highly conserved protein , from nematodes to human , located in chromosome 4 ( 4E1 ; 4 74 . 75 cM ) in mice and chromosome 1 ( 1p36 . 21 ) in humans . EFhd2 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a proteomics screen designed to discriminate CD8 from CD4 and CD19 lymphocytes . The abundance of this novel protein was found to be reduced in CD4 and C19 in comparison to CD8 lymphocytes ( Vuadens et al . , 2004 ; Dütting et al . , 2011 ) . In this original study , the novel protein was named Swiprosin 1 , in reference to the Swiss - Prot database used for the tandem mass spectrometry data analysis ( Vuadens et al . , 2004 ) . Subsequently , the name of this novel protein was changed to EF - hand domain family , member D2 ( EFhd2 ) due to the presence of two EF - hand calcium binding motifs . Characterization of EFhd2 demonstrated that it Vega EFhd2 , a Neurodegenerative or Neuroprotective Protein ? is an ubiquitous calcium binding protein , preferentially expressed in the central nervous system ( Avramidou et al . , 2007 ; Vega et al . , 2008 ; Hagen et al . , 2012 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . Further sequence analyses indicated that EFhd2 has a coiled - coil domain at the C - terminus , which is a conserved domain among ﬁbrillar proteins and required for protein – protein interaction ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013a ) . At the N - terminus , EFhd2 has a distinctive polyalanine motif that varies in size ( between 6 and 9 alanines ) and it is only present in mammals ( Dütting et al . , 2011 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013a ) . The function of EFhd2’s polyalanine motif is still unknown , but proteins containing polyalanine expansions have been shown to be linked to diﬀerent neurological disorders ( Albrecht and Mundlos , 2005 ) . However , the physiological and pathological roles of EFhd2 are still poorly understood . EFhd2 may function as a signaling or cytoskeleton regulatory protein . In WEHI231 cells , it was shown that EFhd2 is required for the regulation of the canonical NFkB pathway upon activation of the B - cell receptor ( BCR ; Avramidou et al . , 2007 ; Hagen et al . , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . ShRNA - mediated EFhd2 knockdown led to increase IkB phosphorylation , which is a prerequisite for translocation of NFkB to the nucleus , upon BCR activation ( Avramidou et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Based on this result , the authors suggested that EFhd2 may play a role as negative regulator of NFkB in the BCR signaling pathway ( Avramidou et al . , 2007 ) . Alternatively , another study found EFhd2 at the plasma membrane , where it facilitates the assembly of the BCR and appears to work as a scaﬀold protein required for the function of Syk , SLP - 65 , and PLC γ 2 during BCR - induced calcium ﬂux ( Kroczek et al . , 2010 ) . The functional interaction of EFhd2 with BCR signaling pathway and modulation of IkB phosphorylation indicates a potential regulatory role in cell survival or fate . Interestingly , EFhd2 was identiﬁed as a novel pro - caspase - 9 - interacting protein in H460 cells ( Ch˛eci´nska et al . , 2009 ) . EFhd2 association with ( inactive ) pro - caspase - 9 protein suggests that it may regulate the activation of apoptosis ( Ch˛eci´nska et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , other reports indicated that EFhd2 mediates actin bundling and regulates cell spreading and migration ( Huh et al . , 2013 ; Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , recent studies indicated that EFhd2 was upregulated by epidermal growth factor signaling and mediates cell migration through the modulation of Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA activity ( Huh et al . , 2015 ) . Although , the direct role of EFhd2 in regulating cellular survival and apoptosis is still unclear , these results indicate that this novel protein plays an important role in modulating cellular responses elicited by diﬀerent environmental cues , such as trophic factors or stimulating antibodies ( Avramidou et al . , 2007 ; Huh et al . , 2015 ) . EFhd2 has also been associated with diﬀerent pathological processes , from cancer to neurological disorders ( Table 1 ) . In cancer , EFhd2 was found to be overexpressed in the majority of carcinomas , colon cancer , and melanoma ( Huh et al . , 2015 ) . The results indicated that EFhd2 may mediate invasion and metastasis of cancerous cells , suggesting it plays an important role in the biology of cancer . EFhd2 gene expression and protein abundance have been also shown to be altered in AD and other neurological disorders . Thus , even though the role that EFhd2 plays in cancer biology is of great interest , this review focusses on EFhd2’s role in the central nervous system , speciﬁcally its association with AD and other neurological disorders . IS EFHD2 A MODULATOR OF FUNCTIONAL SYNAPSE FORMATION ? EFhd2 is highly expressed in neurons compared to other cell types of the central nervous system , where may play an important role in synapse formation ( Reynolds et al . , 2008 ; Vega et al . , 2008 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ; Borger et al . , 2014 ) . EFhd2 proteins were found in the cytosol and proximal to the membrane in neurons of most brain regions , including higher expression in the deeper layers of the cortex and hippocampus ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ; Borger et al . , 2014 ) . EFhd2 co - localized with neurite markers such as tau , MAP2 , synapsin , and PSD95 , suggesting that its neuronal function could be associated with vesicle transport and synapse homeostasis ( Borger et al . , 2014 ; Purohit et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with this putative function , a recent study showed in vitro that knockdown of EFhd2 increased synpasin 1a / b puncta labeling in neurites , suggesting that modulation of EFhd2 aﬀects the development of functional synapses , but it had no eﬀect on converting them to mature synapses as determined by the co - localization of synapsin and PSD95 ( Borger et al . , 2014 ) . These results imply that EFhd2 may modulate the formation of new synapses , a process that it is relevant for diﬀerent brain functions , such as learning and memory . Characterization of an Efhd2 knockout mouse provided further insights about its function in the central nervous system . Purohit et al . ( 2014 ) showed that deletion of Efhd2 gene has no detectable eﬀect on brain anatomy or function . Interestingly , they showed that vesicle transport velocity was enhanced in Efhd2 ( − / − ) knockout primary hippocampal neurons and that EFhd2 protein inhibited kinesin mediated microtubule gliding in vitro ( Purohit et al . , 2014 ) . The authors proposed that EFhd2 may interfere with the interaction between kinesin and microtubules ( Purohit et al . , 2014 ) . In this regard , EFhd2 has been showed to co - purify with tubulin in the synaptosome fraction as well as to mediate actin bundling ( Huh et al . , 2013 ; Kwon et al . , 2013 ; Purohit et al . , 2014 ) . Although , there is no evidence that Efhd2 gene knockout aﬀects brain function , these results suggest that EFhd2 may serve as a modulator of synapse formation by regulating the velocity of vesicle transport and cytoskeleton rearrangement . EFHD2 IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE EFhd2 protein abundance was found altered in AD , suggesting that Efhd2 gene expression may be regulated in response to neurodegeneration ( Vega et al . , 2008 ; Borger et al . , 2014 ; Table 1 ) . Two diﬀerent studies showed that the chromosome region encompassing the Efhd2 gene locus is linked to ( and a third study showed that it is associated with ) late - onset Alzheimer’s disease ( LOAD ; Hiltunen et al . , 2001 ; Myers et al . , 2002 ; Holmans et al . , 2005 ) . The linkage between Efhd2 gene and LOAD is yet to be determined ; however , we and others have shown that EFhd2 expression and protein abundance is altered in AD and Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 March 2016 | Volume 10 | Article 150 Vega EFhd2 , a Neurodegenerative or Neuroprotective Protein ?

Previously , we showed that EFhd2 protein is increased in the tauopathy mouse model JNPL3 , which expresses the human P301L mutant tau protein ( Vega et al . , 2008 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . We showed that EFhd2 protein abundance increased as the accumulation of pathological tau and progression of the motor impairment phenotype augmented in JNPL3 mice ( Vega et al . , 2008 ) . In an independent expression proﬁling study , using a diﬀerent AD mouse model , APP23 , EFhd2 was also found to be overexpressed ( Tseveleki et al . , 2010 ) . It is important to mention that the APP23 AD mouse model overexpresses human Amyloid Precursor Protein with double Swedish mutation ( K670M / N671L ) and it has been shown that tau mediates the toxicity observed in this mouse model ( Sturchler - Pierrat et al . , 1997 ; Ittner et al . , 2010 ) . These results suggest that EFhd2 is up - regulated in response to pathological processes associated with tau - mediated neurodegeneration . EFhd2 protein increased abundance in mouse models of neurodegeneration was validated in postmortem AD brain ( Vega et al . , 2008 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . Using quantitative immunoblotting , we demonstrated that EFhd2 Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2016 | Volume 10 | Article 150 Vega EFhd2 , a Neurodegenerative or Neuroprotective Protein ? protein abundance is increased in postmortem frontal cortices in AD cases ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . In contrast , Borger et al . ( 2014 ) showed that EFhd2 protein abundance is reduced in AD cases and other dementias , including frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP43 pathology . Moreover , they showed that EFhd2 mRNA was also signiﬁcantly lower in AD , when compare to normal aging controls . The discrepancy between these two reports could be due to diﬀerences in postmortem brain sample selection , agonal stage , activated glial cells , and / or diﬀerential immune cell inﬁltration . For example , in our study , we included only AD postmortem brain with Braak stage IV or higher ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . In Borger et al . ( 2014 ) , Braak stage is reported for only a few of the cases used . It is important to mention that in those reported cases with Braak stage VI , EFhd2 protein level is higher than in the other AD cases that the Braak stage was not indicated . Other technical reasons , such as anti - EFhd2 antibodies used , protein extraction method and diﬀerential subcellular localization , could contribute to the discrepancy . Interestingly , Twine et al . ( 2011 ) identiﬁed EFhd2 as one of the genes with increased alternative splicing in frontal cortices of AD patients . This is consistent with previous results that identiﬁed two protein bands corresponding to EFhd2 , which might contribute to the detection of diﬀerent EFhd2 isoforms depending on the antibody used ( Avramidou et al . , 2007 ; Vega et al . , 2008 ) . Nevertheless , what is consistent among these studies is that EFhd2 expression was found altered in AD . Further studies are required to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the Efhd2 gene and protein under pathological or cellular stress conditions . Further biochemical characterization of EFhd2 protein demonstrated that this novel protein has the molecular and structural features of amyloid proteins ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . In vitro studies showed that Thioﬂavin S ( a dye that selectively binds to amyloid structures ) binds recombinant EFhd2 protein , indicating that EFhd2 transition from a mostly helical and random coil structure to cross - beta - sheet ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013a , b ) . Amyloid proteins tend to form oligomers and ﬁlamentous structures . Electron microscopy analyses conﬁrmed that EFhd2 forms ﬁlaments in vitro without the requirement of a nucleation factor ( Congdon et al . , 2008 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . Furthermore , the presence of calcium reduces EFhd2’s ability to form ﬁlaments , and the coiled - coil domain was shown to be required for the formation of EFhd2 homodimers ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . These results indicated that formation of EFhd2 ﬁlaments could promote the association with pathological tau ﬁlaments . To test this hypothesis , immunohistological analyses of AD brain slices were performed . The results showed that EFhd2 co - localized with PHF1 ( an antibody that recognized tau ﬁlaments ) in the somatodendritic compartment , validating the association of EFhd2 with ﬁlamentous tau structures ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . Moreover , immune - gold electron microscopy showed that EFhd2 and tau , puriﬁed from AD brain , formed co - ﬁlaments ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . Moreover , in vitro protein – protein interaction assays demonstrated that EFhd2’s coiled - coil domain is necessary for its association with tau proteins puriﬁed from brain extract derived from JNPL3 mice ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013b ) . Thus , it is plausible to hypothesize that formation of EFhd2 oligomers may serve as nucleation factor for tau oligomerization and , consequently , NFTs in AD and other tauopathies ( Figure 1 ) . Nevertheless , further studies are required to determine EFhd2’s capability to enhance protein aggregation in tauopathy and other neurodegenerative disorders . EFHD2 IS ASSOCIATED WITH PARKINSON’S DISEASE AND OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS EFhd2 has been also found associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . Liscovitch and French ( 2014 ) showed that EFhd2 expression is increased in substantia nigra in PD . In this study , they found that EFhd2 overexpression correlated with the positive co - expression of α - synuclein and IFN - γ , establishing a molecular relationship between PD and inﬂammation ( Liscovitch and French , 2014 ; Table 1 ) . In contrast , EFhd2 protein abundance was found reduced in the substantia nigra of a mouse model where PTEN - induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) has been knockout ( Diedrich et al . , 2011 ) . PINK1 is a mitochondrial protein , the loss - of - function mutation of which induces early - onset PD . These conﬂicting reports could be due to the diﬀerence between mechanisms associated with sporadic PD cases and those underlying the phenotype of the PINK1 knockout mice . However , in vitro studies identiﬁed EFhd2 as a protein secreted / released by microglia cells upon incubation with nitrated α - synuclein ( Reynolds et al . , 2008 ) . This is the ﬁrst study that shows expression of EFhd2 in microglia cells , but , more importantly , it also indicates that EFhd2 , a cytosolic protein , could be released from cells in response to a pathological signal . Taken together , EFhd2 altered protein abundance in PD provides strong evidence that it is involved in molecular mechanisms associated with neurodegeneration . EFhd2 associates with known proteins linked to the pathophysiology of PD ( Table 1 ) . In a proteomics approach , EFhd2 was identiﬁed associated with leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ( Lrrk2 ) , the most common causative gene of inherited PD ( Meixner et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , this study demonstrated that Lrrk2 decreased actin polymerization , promoting the accumulation of monomeric actin ( G - actin ; Meixner et al . , 2011 ) . Knockdown of Lrrk2 aﬀects actin cytoskeleton and cellular morphology , indicating that Lrrk2 plays a direct role on actin ( Meixner et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , EFhd2 promotes actin bundling ( Huh et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , these results suggest that Lrrk2 and EFhd2 may compete for the interaction with F - actin , as regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Moreover , Lrrk2 has been shown to phosphorylate tau and promote tau aggregation , as observed in postmortem brain tissue from PD cases with Lrrk2 mutations ( Guerreiro et al . , 2015 ) . On the basis of their link to neurodegeneration , it is reasonable to speculate that there could be a pathological connection between Lrrk2 and tau through EFhd2 . EFhd2 altered protein abundance and its association with pathological proteins have also been found in other neurological disorders . EFhd2 protein was identiﬁed as a co - aggregating Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 March 2016 | Volume 10 | Article 150 Vega EFhd2 , a Neurodegenerative or Neuroprotective Protein ? FIGURE 1 | Working hypothesis : EFhd2 role in neurodegeneration . ( 1 ) Activation : Pathological signals , such accumulation of A β oligomers , calcium inﬂux , and neuroinﬂammation , lead to the activation of speciﬁc kinases , such as GSK3 β and Cdk5 / p25 , and upregulation of gene expression . These kinases mediate the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins and promote its release from the microtubules ( MTs ) . Altered expression of Efhd2 gene leads to increase abundance of EFhd2 protein . ( 2 ) Oligomerization : The accumulation of EFhd2 proteins and its self - oligomerization properties could serve as a nucleation factor for hyperphosphorylated tau proteins , enhancing the kinetics of the formation of tau oligomers and / or neuroﬁbrillary tangles at the somatodendritic compartment . Additionally , the accumulation of EFhd2 proteins affects kinesin - mediated fast axonal transport and promotes actin - bundling . ( 3 ) Toxicity : The accumulation of EFhd2 and tau oligomers leads to neuronal death and its release to the interstitial ﬂuid , where are up - taken by neighboring neurons . Alternatively , EFhd2 could accelerate the transition from tau oligomers to neuroﬁbrillary tangles ( NFTs ) as a neuroprotective mechanism , reducing the capacity of toxic tau transmission . Further studies are required to deﬁne the pathological role of EFhd2 in AD and other neurological disorders . protein with poly - GA C9orf72 , a common pathogenic protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ; May et al . , 2014 ) . This result suggests that EFhd2 may be involved in the molecular mechanisms that lead to aggregation of pathological proteins , other than tau , in proteinopathies such as ALS . Consistently , EFhd2 was one of the uniquely identiﬁed proteins found in lipid rafts isolated from a mouse model that expresses the G93A SOD1 mutant ; a mutation found in inherited ALS cases ( Zhai et al . , 2009 ) . This result indicates that EFhd2 subcellular localization could also be altered in neurodegeneration . In addition to its association with neurodegenerative diseases , Efhd2 gene expression has also been found altered in psychiatric disorders . Two independent studies demonstrated that EFhd2 is up - regulated in schizophrenia ( Martins - de - Souza et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) . Postmortem analysis of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus , two brain regions associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia , revealed a signiﬁcant increase in EFhd2 protein level in comparison to normal control cases ( Martins - de - Souza et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) . In contrast , EFhd2 was found down - regulated in prefrontal cortex and up - regulated in amygdala of individuals that committed suicide ( Kékesi et al . , 2012 ) . These results suggest that altered levels of EFhd2 are directly associated with brain pathology . CONCLUSION In summary , EFhd2 harbors similarities to known and well - studied neuropathological proteins . For instance , EFhd2 is a structural disorder protein mainly composed of random coils and alpha helices , forms ﬁlamentous structures , associates with vesicle traﬃcking and cytoskeleton rearrangement , co - aggregate , and co - purify with pathological proteins , its expression and protein abundance is altered in neurodegenerative diseases . Based on these similarities and the published results discussed Frontiers in Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 5 March 2016 | Volume 10 | Article 150 Vega EFhd2 , a Neurodegenerative or Neuroprotective Protein ? above , it is plausible to hypothesize that neuronal stress due to environmental cues ( such as cytokines ) or pathological protein aggregation induces changes in Efhd2 gene expression ( Figure 1 ) . In this context , activation of signaling proteins , such as Cdk5 ( Vázquez - Rosa et al . , 2014 ) , induces posttranslational modiﬁcations on EFhd2 that aﬀect its calcium binding activity and promotes self - oligomerization ( Figure 1 ) . The accumulation of EFhd2 oligomers could serve as a nucleation factor of tau proteins facilitating its accumulation at the somatodendritic compartment , which also aﬀects kinesin - mediated fast axonal transport ( Figure 1 ; Kanaan et al . , 2013 ) . Consequently , the accumulation of EFhd2 proteins and tau aggregates would lead to activation of apoptosis ( Figure 1 ) . Interestingly , up - regulation of EFhd2 could also promote aberrant actin bundling , leading to the formation of Hirano bodies in AD ( Figure 1 , Sonoda et al . , 2015 ) . Alternatively , EFhd2 altered expression in neurological disorders could be related to neuroprotection . The identiﬁcation of EFhd2 co - localization with neuroﬁbrillary tangles ( NFTs ) in the somatodendric compartment and its ﬁlament formation capability suggest that EFhd2 may aﬀect the kinetic of tau ﬁlament formation , promoting the generation of stable ultrastructures ( Figure 1 ) . The generation of NFTs may sequester tau oligomers , preventing the spread of toxic tau to the interstitial ﬂuid . Concomitantly , EFhd2’s accumulation in NFTs induces a loss - of - function eﬀect that promotes the generation of new functional synapses through increase vesicle transport velocity similar to that observed in Efhd2 knockout mice . This may explain why NFT bearing neurons are still synaptically active and functionally integrated in neuronal circuits ( Kuchibhotla et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , further studies are crucial to determine the role that EFhd2 plays in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders .
