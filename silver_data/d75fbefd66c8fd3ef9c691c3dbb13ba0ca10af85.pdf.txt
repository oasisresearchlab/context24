AML with inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) is associated with aberrant expression of the stem - cell regulator EVI1 . Applying functional genomics and genome - engineering , we demonstrate that both 3q rearrangements reposition a distal GATA2 enhancer to ectopically activate EVI1 and simultaneously confer GATA2 functional haploin - sufﬁciency , previously identiﬁed as the cause of sporadic familial AML / MDS and MonoMac / Emberger syndromes . Genomic excision of the ectopic enhancer restored EVI1 silencing and led to growth inhibition and differentiation of AML cells , which could be replicated by pharmacologic BET in - hibition . Our data show that structural rearrange - ments involving the chromosomal repositioning of a single enhancer can cause deregulation of two unre - lated distal genes , with cancer as the outcome . INTRODUCTION Chromosomal inversions and translocations play a central role in the pathogenesis of almost all types of cancers , frequently by formation of oncogenic fusion genes via rearrangement of coding sequences of the involved partner genes ( Fro¨hling and Do¨hner , 2008 ; Mitelman et al . , 2004 , 2013 ) . Mechanisms of transformation remain largely unknown in malignancies arising from chromosomal inversions / translocations that do not cause fusion products , although it is thought that destabilization of cryptic regulatory elements affects genes in the vicinity of the structural rearrangement , as has been shown in Burkitt’s ( Polack et al . , 1993 ) or follicular lymphoma ( Bakhshi et al . , 1985 ; Tsuji - moto et al . , 1985 ) . In the World Health Organization ( WHO ) category of myeloid malignancies with inv ( 3 ) ( q21q26 . 2 ) or t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 . 2 ) deregu - lation of the proto - oncogene EVI1 ( also termed MECOM or PRDM3 ) at 3q26 . 2 is speculated to occur via juxtaposition of a cryptic enhancer of the housekeeping gene RPN1 from 3q21 ( Suzukawa et al . , 1994 ) . However , this hypothesis has not been experimentally validated and the molecular basis of this prognostically unfavorable subtype of malignancies remains obscured . EVI1 expression and function is indispensable for proper regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and genomic integrity ( Goyama et al . , 2008 ; Kataoka et al . , 2011 ; Pinheiro et al . , 2012 ) . The gene was originally described as a hotspot for proviral integration in retrovirally induced murine myeloid leukemias ( Morishita et al . , 1988 ) and also represents an important insertional mutagenesis site in humans following gene therapy for X - linked granulomatous disease ( Stein et al . , 2010 ) . We tested the hypothesis that rearrangements causing the transcriptional activation of EVI1 involve the reallocation of an enhancer element to the ectopic 3q26 . 2 / EVI1 target site , which may possibly coincide with a loss of enhancer activity at its endogenous location . We applied an integrated functional genomics and genome - engineering approach to identify a distal enhancer of the GATA2 gene that , upon chromosomal 3q rearrangements , ectopically activates EVI1 expression . Simulta - neously , the removal of this enhancer from its natural genomic context causes functional GATA2 haploinsufﬁciency , i . e . , reduced GATA2 expression only from the remaining normal allele .

The samples included 38 primary bone marrow samples from patients , i . e . , AML ( n = 33 ) , CML - BC ( n = 2 ) , and MDS cases ( n = 3 ) , as well as three cell lines ( MUTZ - 3 , MOLM - 1 , and UCSD - AML1 ) ( Table S1 available online ) . Chro - mosomal breakpoint positions and novel junction sequences of each case were determined by a breakpoint detection algorithm in conjunction with a de novo assembly tool and validated by Sanger sequencing . Characteristic breakpoint patterns emerged at both 3q21 and 3q26 . 2 breakpoint cluster regions ( Figure 1A ) . At the 3q26 . 2 site , samples harboring an inv ( 3 ) exclusively exhibited breakpoints in the last intron or downstream of EVI1 . Breakpoints in t ( 3 ; 3 ) cases distinctly map - ped upstream of EVI1 , i . e . , within the gene locus of the longer splice variant that includes MDS1 - EVI1 ( Figure 1A ) . At the 3q21 site , breakpoints occurred in a 130 kb region between GATA2 ( centromeric ) and RPN1 ( telomeric ) . A minimal 18 kb noncoding region 3 0 of RPN1 demarcated by chromosomal breakpoints was identiﬁed as a commonly translocated segment ( hereafter referred to as CTS ) ( Figure 1B ) , which in all cases underwent transpositioning to the vicinity of EVI1 due to the inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) rearrangement . This converging tell - tale pattern of 3q21 breakpoints toward an unaffected 18 kb genomic segment led us to predict the presence of potent regulatory elements within the CTS , essential for aberrant activation of EVI1 upon rearrangement . The EVI1 Promoter and the 18 kb CTS Physically Interact A hallmark of distal enhancer elements is their engagement in chromatin loops physically contacting with promoters to induce transcription factor assembly and polymerase II recruitment ( Deng et al . , 2012 ; Sanyal et al . , 2012 ; Thurman et al . , 2012 ; Tol - huis et al . , 2002 ) . To test whether the CTS harbored elements physically interacting with the EVI1 promoter , we performed high - resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing ( 4C - seq ) experiments ( van de Werken et al . , 2012 ) . Using view - points placed on the EVI1 promoter in viable inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AML samples and cell lines , we identiﬁed a genomic segment of approximately 9 kb size within the 18 kb CTS contacting with the EVI1 promoter ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Other contact regions located centromeric of this 9 kb contact hotspot in closer dis - tance to the EVI1 promoter after the rearrangement , as observed in individual samples with different breakpoint positions , were considered less likely enhancer candidates . These regions were nonoverlapping across different samples and thus repre - sented less speciﬁc contacts , which became more evident after integrative analysis of all 3q - rearranged AML samples ( Fig - ure 1D ) . Reciprocal 4C - seq experiments with the putative 9kb region as viewpoint showed that the interaction with the EVI1 promoter area was also evident ( Figure S1 ) . As expected , no substantial chromatin interactions with the distant EVI1 promoter could be detected in 4C - seq experiments with non - 3q - rear - ranged control ( U937 ) , suggesting an inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) disease - speciﬁc feature ( Figures 1C and S1 ) . A p300 - Bound Genomic Element in the 18kb CTS Is Essential for EVI1 Activation In order to identify a more deﬁned , targetable key enhancer element within the 9 kb EVI1 - promoter - contact part of the 18 kb CTS , we integrated data from 4C - seq with ChIP - seq data obtained from inv ( 3 ) cell lines MOLM - 1 and MUTZ - 3 ( Figures 2A and S2 ) . Prominent deposition of H3K27ac , H3K4me3 , and H3K4me1 was observed within the 18 kb CTS , as well as strong binding of p300 to two regions of approximately 1 kb size in MOLM - 1 ( Figure 2A ) . In MUTZ - 3 cells only one p300 - interacting region was identiﬁed ( Figure S2 ) , which is the p300 peak located in the 9 kb EVI1 - promoter - contact part of the CTS as determined by 4C - seq . Comparison with ENCODE ChIP - seq data of various nonmyeloid cell lines and transcription factor motif analysis pointed to a 1 kb myeloid hematopoiesis - speciﬁc enhancer ( Figures 2A and S2 ) . This p300 - binding site was chosen as the most likely candidate enhancer element responsible for ectopic EVI1 activation after the rearrangement event . We placed the two candidate enhancers ( ﬁrst and second p300 site ) into an EVI1 - promoter luciferase reporter construct to study their potential enhancer activity ( Figure 2B ) . A strong induction of reporter gene activity could be observed speciﬁcally in inv ( 3 ) myeloid cell lines MUTZ - 3 and MOLM - 1 using the ﬁrst candidate enhancer element , whereas the second candidate enhancer element ( second p300 site ) located within the 18 kb CTS , but outside of the 9 kb EVI1 - promoter - contact region , showed no enhancer ac - tivity . No activity was found for two distinct CTCF - interacting CpG islands colocalizing to the CTS . Moreover , EVI1 - promoter reporter assays demonstrated no substantial enhancing effect of the candidate 1 kb enhancer in nonmyeloid HEK293T or Jurkat cells , pointing to a myeloid - speciﬁc tran - scription factor repertoire required for successful enhancer - EVI1 - promoter engagement . Genome Editing of the Translocated p300 - Interaction Domain Leads to EVI1 Silencing and Growth Inhibition of inv ( 3 ) AML Cells We next undertook a TALE nuclease genome - editing approach to target the ectopic EVI1 enhancer locus in the MUTZ - 3 cell line and to examine whether EVI1 transcriptional activity in inv ( 3 ) AML cells is dependent on the presence of the rearranged candidate enhancer ( ﬁrst p300 peak ) . TALE nucleases were assembled as previously published ( Sanjana et al . , 2012 ) , and targeting of the minimal ectopic enhancer site was performed in a 2 3 2 design ( details in Experimental Procedures ) , directing TALEN heterodimers to enhancer - ﬂanking recognition se - quences to induce a segmental deletion by double - strand breaks ( DSB ) ( Figure 3A ) . Mutation - speciﬁc primers allowed for allelic detection of the deletion event ( Figure 3B ) and for screening of clones using an informative SNV in the candidate enhancer locus of MUTZ - 3 ( Figures 3B , S3A , and S3B ) . Overall targeting efﬁciency was 1 % with 4 / 384 single - cell derived clones harboring a monoallelic enhancer deletion on the inv ( 3 ) allele 370 Cell 157 , 369 – 381 , April 10 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc .

RPN1 and GATA2 mRNA expression re - mained unchanged in inv ( 3 ) - targeted clones . Notably , all four TALEN - modiﬁed MUTZ - 3 clones showed severely impaired colony - forming and replating capacity compared to nontargeted clones ( Figure 3D ) . Figure 1 .

To better characterize the cellular phenotype and fate after enhancer deletion , we designed an alternative targeting approach using the CRISPR / Cas9 genome - editing system with a site - speciﬁc homology - directed repair ( HDR ) donor for direct labeling and tracking of success - fully targeted cells ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . In brief , enhancer deletions were induced by two short guide - RNAs ( gRNA ) direct - ing hSpCas9 to two enhancer - ﬂanking recognition sequences for DSB formation and HDR of the induced segmental deletion by means of a cotransfected HDR donor construct containing a conditional ( loxP - ) GFP selection cassette directed against the enhancer ( details in Experimental Procedures ) . The genomic CMV - GFP insertion was subsequently removed by using exoge - nous cell - permeant Cre recombinase ( TAT - Cre ) . This approach enabled us to isolate sufﬁcient cell numbers for phenotypic characterization . Deletion events and transcriptional changes were conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing and qPCR ( Figures 4C and S3D ) . Compared to untargeted control MUTZ - 3 cells , targeted cells exhibited a markedly reduced proliferative rate as assessed by viable cell count using trypan blue staining ( Figure 4D ) . Cell cycle analysis showed depletion of S phase and G2 / M phase combined with higher rates of cell death A B Figure 2 . Combined ChIP - Seq and 4C - Seq Discloses Putative Enhancer Elements in the EVI1 Promoter - Interacting Rearrangement Site ( A ) Binding of p300 ( red track ) in the 9 kb EVI1 - interaction domain of the 18 kb CTS ( divided blue box ) is detectable in inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) samples . ChIP - seq proﬁles of p300 and active chromatin marks H3K27ac , H3K4me3 , and H3K4me1 of the inv ( 3 ) cell line MOLM - 1 indicate an inv ( 3 ) cell - type - speciﬁc enrichment in the CTS , notfoundinnon - 3q - rearranged celllinesofvarioustissueorigin ( ENCODE : GM12878 , H1 - hESC , HeLa - S3 , HepG2 , HSMM , HUVEC , K562 , NHEK , NHLF ) . Based on ChIP - seq enhancer proﬁles and CpG island prediction , two candidate enhancer regions were selected both inside ( denoted ﬁrst p300 and CpG1 ; blue and green bars ) and outside ( denoted second p300 and CpG2 ; blue and green bars ) of the 9 kb EVI1 - interaction domain of the CTS , respectively , for subsequent reporter assays .

Remarkably , ﬂow cytometric immunophenotyping of en - gineered cells using a panel of informative myeloid differentiation markers ( see Extended Experimental Procedures for detailed list ) according to published guidelines ( van Dongen et al . , 2012 ) revealed a substantial skew toward a more mature , mye - lomonocytic stage as per cMPO and CD14 expression levels 3 weeks after genome editing ( Figure 4F ) . Cytologic evaluation of enhancer - targeted MUTZ - 3 cells in week 3 after genomic modiﬁcation conﬁrmed morphologic changes from the predom - inantly immature , myelomonocytic appearance of untargeted cells toward a more differentiated , monocyte / macrophage - like shape ( Figure 4G ) . This also translated into a higher apoptotic rate of CRISPR - targeted MUTZ - 3 cells 3 weeks after enhancer deletion ( Figure 4H ) . Off - target mutagenesis at alternative in silico predicted sites was excluded by Sanger sequencing ( Figure S3E ) . The pheno - type observed upon enhancer deletion by genome - editing tools was highly comparable to what was found with small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - mediated EVI1 knockdown in the MUTZ - 3 cell line ( Figures S4A – S4H ) , emphasizing that MUTZ - 3 cells are addicted to EVI1 and blocked in their differentiation . We did not observe outgrowth of biallelic enhancer deletion or monoallelic mutants of the nonrearranged chromosome 3 allele , hinting toward negative selection of these mutants upon disruption of the enhancer at its natural genomic location . The Candidate Enhancer Translocated to EVI1 Is an Original Upstream Enhancer of GATA2 The most likely candidate for off - target mutagenesis at the original enhancer - associated domain on the normal chro - mosome 3 allele appeared to be RPN1 due to its immediate proximity to the candidate enhancer . Concordantly , RPN1 has therefore generally been the assumed origin of ectopic EVI1 regulatory elements , since it is located in the proximity of the chromosome 3 breakpoint cluster ( Suzukawa et al . , 1994 ; Wieser et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , disturbance of the housekeeping function of RPN1 on the remaining normal allele would most likely be deleterious . However , analysis of our 4C - seq proﬁling data instead revealed substantial interactions between the candidate enhancer and the promoter of GATA2 rather than with the promoter of RPN1 ( Figures 5A , 5B , and S5A ) . GATA2 is a crucial hematopoietic stem cell regulator , located on the contralateral side of the 3q21 breakpoint cluster . This suggests that the candidate enhancer is an original upstream regulatory element for GATA2 , rather than RPN1 . Hi - C data conﬁrm that the candidate enhancer is together with the GATA2 locus in a topological domain , physically segregated from the more proximal RPN1 promoter ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure S5B ) . Consequently , we ﬁrst aimed to examine the effect of loss of the candidate enhancer in a human cell line without 3q rear - rangements and the functional impact on either RPN1 or GATA2 expression . We generated custom CRISPR / Cas9 nucleases against the candidate enhancer locus in the GATA2 - expressing erythroleukemia cell line K562 ( Figure 6A ) . We effec - tively deleted the candidate enhancer in K562 cells and observed profoundly reduced levels ( 10 . 8 - fold ) of GATA2 mRNA in targeted K562 pools ( Figure 6B ) , whereas RPN1 expression levels remained unchanged . Luciferase GATA2 - promoter reporter studies conﬁrmed strong GATA2 - speciﬁc enhancer activity of the candidate locus in a myeloid context ( Figure 6C ) . Thus , the candidate ectopic enhancer , which upon translocation is repositioned to the EVI1 locus , is a strong enhancer of GATA2 in its original chromosomal context . Rearrangement of the GATA2 Enhancer to EVI1 Causes Functional Haploinsufﬁciency of GATA2 To study the effects of the enhancer translocation on GATA2 expression in inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AML samples , we analyzed allele fre - quencies of informative SNPs in the GATA2 locus by combining 3q - seq and RNA - seq data . This integrative analysis revealed a monoallelic expression pattern of GATA2 in all 36 inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) cases studied ( Figures 6D and S6 ) . Non - 3q - rearranged AML patient samples and cell lines , as well as variant 3q - rearranged AML cases ( e . g . , inv ( 3 ) ( q21q25 ) ; t ( 3 ; 7 ) ( q26 ; p15 ) ) displayed a normal , biallelic GATA2 expression pattern ( data not shown ) . To ascertain monoallelic GATA2 expression originating from the normal chromosome 3 allele , we performed an allele - speciﬁc chromosome conformation capture sequencing approach ( see Experimental Procedures for details ) , in which captured informa - tive SNPs of the GATA2 locus can only be ampliﬁed by allele - speciﬁc primers on the nonrearranged , linear chromosome 3 template . Results were validated by long - range , breakpoint - spanning PCR and Sanger sequencing . By integration of results from these NGS platforms ( 3q - seq , RNA - seq , and allele - speciﬁc 4C ; Figure 6D ) , we found monoallelic GATA2 expression as a consequence of GATA2 inactivation on the rearranged allele in cases harboring inv ( 3 ) or t ( 3 ; 3 ) . Notably , GATA2 expression levels in primary inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AML cases and cell lines ( n = 78 ) were found to be signiﬁcantly reduced as compared to controls ( 213 AML patients ) ( Figure 6E ) . Thus , our data indicate that the inversion / translocation eventininv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) malignancies reorga - nizes an originally upstream regulatory element of the GATA2 domain , causing reduced and monoallelic expression of GATA2 . The 18 kb CTS and p300 - Interaction Domain Are Part of a Translocation - Derived Superenhancer We have shown that targeting of the candidate enhancer site in inv ( 3 ) AML cells by genome - editing techniques is feasible , based on the premises that the enhancer element interacts with the EVI1 promoter , binds the transcriptional coactivator p300 , and is embedded in a region of open , potentially regulatory chro - matin , and thereby also accessible for endonucleases . However , ChIP - seq data obtained from the inv ( 3 ) cell line MOLM - 1 mani - fested a large segment of H3K27ac deposition that extends beyond the entire 18 kb CTS and p300 - interaction domain , covering a region of approximately 40 kb ( Figures 2A and 7A ) . These exceptionally large enhancer domains with high levels of H3K27ac and the chromatin regulator BRD4 have recently been characterized as superenhancers ( Love´n et al . , 2013 ; Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Using the bioinformatic analysis tool ROSE ( Love´n et al . , 2013 ) , the 40 kb H3K27ac - deposition region was identiﬁed as a superenhancer , ranking second among 291 superenhancers in the MOLM - 1 genome ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . RNA - seq analysis revealed the presence of intense read - through Cell 157 , 369 – 381 , April 10 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 373 A B C D ( legend on next page ) 374 Cell 157 , 369 – 381 , April 10 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) spanning the entire superenhancer area including the 18 kb CTS in MOLM - 1 ( Figure 7A ) . Of note , read - through transcription commenced precisely at the breakpoint positions , representing the fusion point of 3q21 with 3q26 / EVI1 segments . RNA - seq carried out in all available inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) leuke - mia samples disclosed identical patterns of large read - through areas of eRNAs ( Figure 7A ) . Consistently , BRD4 - occupancy was found at the superenhancer site in 3q - rearranged samples , particularly in the p300 - interaction domain ( Figure S7A ) . Non - 3q - rearranged samples entirely lacked traces of transcriptional read - through ( Figure 7A ) and exhibited no H3K27ac deposition , or , if any at all , only in a conﬁned 3 – 4 kb region immediately downstream of the RPN1 gene , as shown by comparison with ENCODE ChIP - seq data of various non - 3q - rearranged cell lines ( Figures 2A and S2 ) . Furthermore , combining 3q - capture DNA - seq with ChIP - seq data of MOLM - 1 showed the presence of informative heterozygous SNPs in the putative 3q21 superen - hancer locus on genomic DNA level , whereas the chromatin after H3K27ac pull - down revealed a skew in the allelic ratio of these SNPs in the same locus ( Figure 7C ) . These observations suggest the presence of an active , rearranged superenhancer in inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) leukemia samples , as was previously observed for MYC - rearrangements in multiple myeloma ( Love´n et al . , 2013 ) . BET Inhibition Leads to EVI1 Silencing and Growth Arrest of inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AML Cells Our genome - editing results underline that EVI1 is the key oncogenic driver in inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AML and vulnerable to interfer - ence with its ectopic enhancer . As reported previously , BET - bromodomain inhibition of superenhancers represents a novel therapeutic avenue to target genes particularly regulated by superenhancers ( Love´n et al . , 2013 ; Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . The observation that the p300 - binding ectopic EVI1 enhancer is embedded in a large 3q21 superenhancer complex ( Figures 7A and 7B ) prompted us to investigate whether EVI1 transcription in inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AMLs is sensitive to enhancer interference by treatment with a BET - bromodomain inhibitor ( JQ1 ) . Exposure of MUTZ - 3 and MOLM - 1 cells , as well as primary inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) AML samples to JQ1 profoundly inhibited proliferation with con - centrations > 50 nM ( Figures 7D and S7C ) . EVI1 - expressing K562 cells ( no 3q rearrangement ) , however , were not responsive to JQ1 , as was previously shown ( Zuber et al . , 2011 ) . EVI1 mRNA levels in MUTZ - 3 and MOLM - 1 cells signiﬁcantly decreased after JQ1 treatment contrary to K562 cells , in which BRD4 density at the enhancer locus is lower by comparison ( Figures 7E , S7A , S7D , and S7E ) . Furthermore , GATA2 mRNA levels did not change upon JQ1 treatment , substantiating the notion that the ectopic superenhancer / core p300 element is indeed a fusion result regulating EVI1 on the rearranged allele rather than GATA2 on the remaining normal allele . BRD4 load as well as read - through transcription at the ectopic EVI1 superenhancer site were substantially decreased after JQ1 treatment ( Figures 7F and S7B ) , whereas displacement of BRD4 in typical enhancer regions was less profound , as has previously been reported ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Similar to the observed effects upon enhancer excision , we observed a profound S phase reduction along with a G0 / G1 cell - cycle arrest , higher rates of maturation , and apoptotic events upon BRD4 - inhibition ( Figures 7G , S7F , S7G , and S7H ) . Reintroduction of EVI1 by nucleofection of MUTZ - 3 cells prior to JQ1 treatment , allowing for transient EVI1 expression , partly rescued MUTZ - 3 from JQ1 cytotoxicity , arguing for relative selectivity of JQ1 for the EVI1 superenhancer as opposed to globally inhibiting other putative oncogenic drivers ( Figure 7H ) . DISCUSSION In summary , inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) chromosomal rearrangements cause dysregulation of two speciﬁc AML predisposition genes by aberrant activity of a single enhancer element in its ectopic chromatin environment : ( 1 ) Overexpression of EVI1 is caused by inappropriate transcriptional control of the ectopic GATA2 regulatory element , while ( 2 ) GATA2 transcriptional impairment results from the removal of that same enhancer from its genomic origin . These dual events mediated by a single enhancer rearrangement , without formation of an oncogenic fusion product , highlight the vulnerability of genome organiza - tion into long - range regulatory interaction domains in case of a chromosomal break . The enhancer we identiﬁed appears to originally control transcription of the 110 kb distant GATA2 gene at 3q21 , and not the nearby gene RPN1 . Our ﬁnding is in accordance with reports demonstrating a highly homo - logous (cid:2) 77 kb enhancer element to constitute a component of the murine Gata2 master regulatory complex ( Grass et al . , 2006 ) and that this element is indeed leukemogenic via EVI1 activation in transgenic mice harboring the human 3q21q26 - rearranged allele ( Yamazaki et al . , 2014 ) . In case of an inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) , the rearranged enhancer engaged in chromatin loops with the EVI1 promoter , in certain samples over a distance of more than 200 kb . Our data emphasize that the function of an enhancer is not only determined by its location , but in particular by its ability to physically bind to an appropriate promoter , Figure 3 .

Our ﬁndings show that not RPN1 , as reported in the nomenclature of the WHO2008 classiﬁcation ( inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) / RPN1 - EVI1 ) , but rather the GATA2 locus is the source of the ectopic enhancer acti - vating EVI1 in this type of leukemia . Besides aberrant EVI1 activation , rewiring of parts of the GATA2 and EVI1 domains led to a reduction of GATA2 expres - sion levels . EVI1 activation in this subtype of AML argues for a primitive HSC defect ( de Pater et al . , 2013 ; Goyama et al . , 2008 ; Kataoka et al . , 2011 ; Ling et al . , 2004 ; Orlic et al . , 1995 ; Spinner et al . , 2013 ; Tsai and Orkin , 1997 ) . Since GATA2 is a critical hematopoietic stemness factor , primitive he - matopoietic precursors will be particularly susceptible to distur - bances of GATA2 homeostasis . Thus , GATA2 deﬁciency may provide the right spatiotemporal context for EVI1 oncogene activation , i . e . , in the right cell at the right stage of differentia - tion for subsequent malignant transformation . Functional hap - loinsufﬁciency arising from inactivating mutations in GATA2 DNA - binding domains or in GATA2 regulatory sequences rep - resents a well - established underlying cause of MDS / AML and Emberger / MonoMAC syndromes ( Hahn et al . , 2011 ; Hsu et al . , 2013 ; Hsu et al . , 2011 ; Ostergaard et al . , 2011 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2005 ) , of which the latter are characterized by monocy - topenia , immune deﬁciency , and predisposition to myeloid leu - kemia with frequent monosomy 7 . AML with inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) most commonly associates with monosomy 7 and trilineage dysplasia , and , as demonstrated here , it is accompanied by impaired GATA2 expression as well . It will be of particular inter - est to investigate whether in Emberger and MonoMAC patients 3q26 defects and consequently aberrant EVI1 expression are also drivers of disease progression toward AML / MDS . Of note , the enhancer - containing 3q21 locus is rarely , but consis - tently involved in other chromosomal rearrangements with PRDM homologs of the EVI1 gene ( e . g . , BLIMP1 / PRDM1 or MEL1 / PRDM16 ) and their aberrant activation ( Lugthart et al . , 2010 ) . Both disease categories ( inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) and other t ( 3q21 ) AMLs ) resemble each other by their high white blood cell and exceptionally high platelet counts at diagnosis . Further studies using in vivo models are warranted to investigate how the com - bined effects of GATA2 haploinsufﬁciency and overexpression of EVI1 or its homologs cooperate in malignant transformation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors . The ectopic EVI1 enhancer was embedded in a genomic region exhibiting large deposition of active chromatin marks ( F ) Immunophenotyping of control and enhancer - targeted MUTZ - 3 cells .

This class of DNA elements has recently been recognized as so - called superen - hancers ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) , which represent large open chro - matin regions of > 10 kb in size with key regulatory function for cellular identity and oncogene regulation in cancer . The obser - vation that the GATA2 enhancer region upon translocation had acquired characteristics of a superenhancer , dominantly ranking in the MOLM - 1 genome , provided the rationale for treatment with bromodomain / BET inhibitors ( Love´n et al . , 2013 ) . The presence of a 3q21 superenhancer might also explain why JQ1 is effective in inv ( 3 ) / t ( 3 ; 3 ) cell lines as opposed to various non 3q - rearranged AML cell lines with EVI1 overexpression ( Zuber et al . , 2011 ) . The effects seen after JQ1 treatment recapitulated the observations obtained by genome - editing experiments involving the translocated p300 - interaction domain .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Subjects Patient recruitment and sample processing were performed according to protocols from the German - Austrian Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group ( AMLSG trials 06 - 04 , 07 - 04 , HD93A , HD98A / B ) and the Dutch - Belgian Hematology / Oncology Cooperative Group ( HOVON trials 04 / A , 29 , 42 , 43 , 81 , 92 ) . All studies were approved through institutional human ethics review board , and all patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . Generation of TALEN Constructs Constructionof TALEDNA - binding domains directed toselected genomic loci was performed as described previously ( Sanjana et al . , 2012 ) . Genomic target coordinates were selected and ﬁltered for off - target sites using the TAL Effector Nucleotide Targeter 2 . 0 tool ( https : / / tale - nt . cac . cornell . edu / node / add / talen ) . Spacer length was deﬁned within a range of 16 – 20 bp , and repeat array lengthwas setto20bp . TheNNrepeat variabledomain targeting base G was chosen in the assembly . In brief , hexamer modules were assembled from a PCR - ampliﬁed monomer library using a hierarchical digestion - ligation reac - tion and subsequently cloned into a full - length TALEN construct . Plasmids wereveriﬁedbySangersequencingandtestedforfunctionalityupontransfec - tion in HEK293T cells . To induce a genomic deletion , two TALEN pairs were transfected owing to dimerization requirement of the FokI nuclease for dou - ble - strand break formation . Repair of chromatin cleavage at the left / upstream andright / downstreamboundariesofthetargetlocusreliesonnonhomologous endjoining ( NHEJ ) intheabsenceofarepairdonorandresultsinthedeletionof a TALEN - targeted DNA segment . Generation of CRISPR Constructs In this study , the RNA - guided endonuclease genome - editing system was employed in experiments involving the cell lines MUTZ - 3 and K562 owing to its cell - line - speciﬁc superior targeting efﬁciency compared with TALENs genome - editing approaches ( Mali et al . , 2013 ) . Publicly available plasmids expressing the CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) / Cas9 system were used for cloning of targeting constructs following recently published protocols ( Cong et al . , 2013 ; Mali et al . , 2013 ) . In brief , custom target - speciﬁc oligonucleotides were cloned into a chimeric guide RNA array of an hSpCas9 - expressing targeting vector . Oligonucleotides for site - speciﬁc chromatin cleavage of genomic target regions were designed following described guidelines and selected for uniqueness using a bioinformatic ﬁltering tool ( http : / / www . genome - engineering . org / crispr / ) . To induce segmental deletions of candidate regulatory DNA regions , two CRISPR plasmids were transfected into cells . Each construct was directed to ﬂanking target site positions of the intervening DNA segment for induction of NHEJ - mediated repair upon DSB formation . Cells were screened for deletion events 48 or 72 hr later by mutation - speciﬁc PCR analogous to TALENs experiments . Clone Screening and Sequencing Upon expansion of TALEN - or CRISPR - targeted clones , genomic DNA was isolated with the QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution ( Epicenter ) and screened for deletion events by mutation - speciﬁc PCR using primers spanningthebreakpointjunction . Ashiftinampliconsizevisualizedbyappear - ance of a lower running band on gel electrophoresis indicated successful targeting , and candidate clones were subsequently checked for mono - clonality . The native amplicon and novel fusion fragment of candidate clones were separately puriﬁed , and sequences of informative , heterozygous SNVs in the target region were determined by Sanger sequencing . Monoallelic targeting was conﬁrmed by loss of heterozygosity at the SNV - speciﬁc nucle - otide site . Monoclonal biallelic deletion mutants were detected by loss of the native amplicon and presence of a single , novel fusion fragment represented by the lower running band .
