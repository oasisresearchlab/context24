Andrews Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery , Chelmsford , United Kingdom Abstract Background : Gram negative infection is a major determinant of morbidity and survival . Traditional teaching suggests that burn wound infections in different centres are caused by differing sets of causative organisms . This study established whether Gram - negative burn wound isolates associated to clinical wound infection differ between burn centres . Methods : Studies investigating adult hospitalised patients ( 2000 – 2010 ) were critically appraised and qualified to a levels of evidence hierarchy . The contribution of bacterial pathogen type , and burn centre to the variance in standardised incidence of Gram - negative burn wound infection was analysed using two - way analysis of variance . PrimaryFindings : Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumanni , Enterobacter spp . , Proteus spp . and Escherichia coli emerged as the commonest Gram - negative burn wound pathogens . Individual pathogens’ incidence did not differ significantly between burn centres ( F ( 4 , 20 ) = 1 . 1 , p = 0 . 3797 ; r2 = 9 . 84 ) . Interpretation : Gram - negative infections predominate in burn surgery . This study is the first to establish that burn wound infections do not differ significantly between burn centres . It is the first study to report the pathogens responsible for the majority of Gram - negative infections in these patients . Whilst burn wound infection is not exclusive to these bacteria , it is hoped that reporting the presence of this group of common Gram - negative ‘‘target organisms’’ facilitate clinical practice and target research towards a defined clinical demand .

Several advances have been registered in the field of intensive care , ventilatory support , skin substitution and fluid balance [ 2 ] . However , infection has emerged as a major , often unmitigated complication in burn injury , which incurs significant morbidity , mortality and healthcare cost [ 3 ] . Management of acute infection in thermal injury presents unique challenges in terms of clinical diagnosis and rapid institution of effective antimicrobial chemo - therapy . Clinical diagnosis is hampered by thermal injury - induced hyperpyrexia , immune suppression , and systemic inflammatory response syndrome [ 3 , 4 ] . These factors make clinical diagnosis difficult and promote infection [ 5 ] . It is , however , well - established that Gram - negative pathogens predominate beyond the early post - burn period [ 5 ] . Centres for Disease Control ( USA ) , the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy , and its European and Asian Counterparts provide extensive documentation regarding aetiological profiles and incidences of the major protagonists in other disease , such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection [ 6 , 7 ] . This data , in turn , provides aetiological targets for rationalised expedited , targeted antimicrobial prescribing , infection control , and antimicrobial development [ 8 ] . Traditional teaching is based on incidence data that is non - standardised and difficult to compare ; it maintains that Gram negative burn wound isolates differ between burn centres [ 9 – 11 ] . Objective The purpose of this study is to establish whether the isolates associated with clinical Gram negative burn wound infection differ between burn centres . This study also sought to establish standardised incidence rates for the organisms identified . PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95042 Methods 3 . 1 Aim Construct The terms of reference in relation to this systematic review and meta - analysis ( File S1 ) in Patient Intervention Comparator and Outcome ( PICO ) format , are reported in File S2 , in conformance to pre - validated criteria [ 12 ] . 3 . 2 Literature Search A combination of National Library of Medicine ( NLM ) Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) Descriptor Data Browser terms were used to increase search sensitivity [ 13 ] . These were used in a first generation electronic search whose results were manually screened for relevance ( File S3 ) . The first generation search was performed using the OVID - SP and PUBMED platforms ( File S4 ) . The second generation search involved manual back - referencing and Web of Knowledge . Results of the electronic literature search are reported extensively in File S5 . 3 . 3 Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria This study specifically adhered to the PICO - specified terms of reference as inclusion criteria ( File S2 ) . In order to enable data pooling and anlalysis , only primary literature investigating adult hospitalised burn patients only was analysed , and studies including patients with delayed transfer were excluded from this analysis . Primary literature published between 2000 and 2010 , in English , studying adult locally - injured hospitalised humans only was included . The limitations of this approach are fully acknowledged , and applicability of the study to other populations is debated in the discussion section . 3 . 4 Reporting of the Systematic Review and Evidence - based Process PRISMA guidelines were applied to report the systematic review and evidence - based process . The retrieval process reported heterogeneous methodologies in the primary literature but no randomised controlled trials ( RCT’s ) , requiring these guidelines to be adapted . Systematic review of studies other than RCTs is not new [ 14 ] . To ensure comparability and adequate data selection rigorous critical appraisal [ 15 , 16 ] was applied to determine the quality of the primary studies retrieved , and ensure inclusion of comparable , current , valid and relevant evidence [ 17 ] . Pre - validated critical appraisal tools were employed on the primary research to achieve significant depth of appraisal [ 12 , 18 ] . Two researchers , arbitrated by a third , independently performed critical appraisal . The Oxford Centres for Evidence Based Medicine ‘‘levels of evidence’’ framework was used to provide a framework to reflect the robustness of individual studies [ 19 ] . The literature retrieval process is reported in detail ( Files S5 , S6 ) . 3 . 5 Operational Definitions and Summary Measures Primary literature reported various measures of incidence , therefore incidence rates were standardised as number of new cases per 1000 patient - years [ 20 ] . As a working definition , an organism was defined as causative if it could be discerned from the study that the organism was isolated from wound in the presence of clinical infection . ‘‘New’’ was defined as the first documentation of an organism , thereby excluding relapse or re - infection . Clinical diagnosis of infection was based on reconciliation of primary literature to the definitions of Greenhalgh et al . [ 21 ] . For the purposes of this study , studies reporting on patients whose transfer to the definitive treatment centre was delayed ( non - immediate ) were excluded . 3 . 6 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism v5 for windows ( CA , USA ) . The contribution of the two independent variables under consideration ( bacteria , burn centre ) to the variance in standardised incidence of Gram - negative burn wound pathogens was analysed using two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . Statistical significance was assumed when p , 0 . 05 . Figure 1 .

Results 4 . 1 Literature Retrieval and Critical Appraisal Thirty four studies were retrieved by the initial literature search ( Figure 1 ) . Narrative critical appraisal is provided in extensive detail in File S7 . Of these studies , 20 did not conform to the inclusion criteria and were excluded ( File S6 ) . Fourteen studies were included for critical appraisal ( Table 1 ) . A further 5 studies did not conform to operational definitions ( section 3 . 3 ) . ‘‘Strength of the evidence’’ underpinning the remaining studies was evaluated by critical appraisal and is reported in Table 2 . Two further studies [ 22 , 23 ] investigated primary incidence over week 1 post - burn only . Because of this methodological heterogeneity , their results could not be pooled or confidently compared to the rest of the literature . Standardised incidence data from the remaining 7 studies ( Table 2 ) was extracted and pooled ( Figure 2 ) . The geographic location of the burn centres from which the data was pooled is reported in Figure 3 . 4 . 2 Data Extraction Data from clinically and statistically comparable studies was transformed to a standardised incidence rate ( n new Gram negative BWI per 1000 patient - years , Table 2 ) .

Descriptively , all these studies reported a similar set of bacteria consisting of P . aerugionsa , K . pneumoniae , E . coli , Enterobacter spp . and Proteus spp . as the commonest Gram - negative pathogens to be isolated from clinically infected burn wounds in the burn centres studied . Standardised incidences reported in this study report Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the commonest BWI pathogen , but the incidence varied widely and differs significantly from the preceding literature [ 24 ] . 4 . 3 Statistical Analyses The majority of infections , 60 . 2 % 6 12 . 5 % ( mean 6 1 SD ) were Gram - negative . A mean incidence rate of 156 new Gram - negative BWI per 1000 patient - years was calculated . Mixed infection accounted for 10 . 3 6 3 . 7 % ( mean 6 1 SD ) of infection . Two - way ANOVA reported that identity of the bacterial species ( indepen - dent variable ) was responsible for 47 . 8 % of the total variance ( F ( 5 , 20 ) = 4 . 13 ) . This was highly statistically significant ( p = 0 . 0098 ) . The same statistical method also reported that Burn Centre accounted for 9 . 84 % of the total variance ( F ( 4 , 20 ) = 5 . 11 ) , but this effect was not statistically significant ( p = 0 . 3797 ) . Discussion This study studied primary literature to establish whether the isolates associated with clinical Gram negative burn wound infection differ between burn centres . Burn wound infection has traditionally been a difficult area for the clinician , and one of the primary reasons is the difficulty in knowing which organisms to target . This study established that organisms causing Gram - negative burn wound infection do not differ significantly between burn centres . Analysis of the standardised data confirm , within this study’s limitations , the principal hypothesis that the organisms causing Gram - negative burn wound infection are similar , regard - less of geographic location of the treating centre ( p , 0 . 05 ) . This finding presents a significant departure from traditional teaching regarding the behaviour of infected burn wounds ( section 1 ) . The lack of standardised data reporting may be one possible explanation for this discord [ 25 ] . In contrast , aetiological profiles and incidences of the major protagonists in other disease such as urinary tract infection have long been established , and are constantly reviewed [ 6 , 7 ] . Establishing the organisms that commonly cause Gram - negative infection in burn wounds may confer to acute burns patients the long - term benefits enjoyed by these other common diseases , such as rationalised , expedited , targeted antimicrobial development , prescribing , infection control , and surveillance of resistance patterns . These findings , integrated with local data regarding susceptibility patters , may facilitate the formulation of ‘‘first line’’ antibiotic treatment strategies , and increase probabilities of therapeutic efficacy . For example , worldwide resistance to commonly used broad spectrum antibiot - ics such as ceftriaxone is common ( from 16 . 3 % E . coli to 64 % of Acinetobacter strains studied ) [ 26 ] . Identifying this set of bacteria may also have implications on defining research strategies in drug redevelopment . Only up to 1 . 4 % of isolates from across the species identified are resistant to colistin , emphasising the usefulness of this antibiotic as a drug of last resort [ 26 ] . These observations lend further credence to the strong interest of this venerable class’s redevelopment via semi - synthetic chemistry approaches . The approach to identifying a common set of bacteria responsible for burn wound infection has already borne translational fruit . Recently , an in - depth analysis for commonalities of biochemical and virulence mechanisms involved in the aetiology of infection with these organisms identified that T a b l e 2 .

Based on this principle , we recently published evidence of a novel , size - based paradigm for drug targeting in infection [ 27 ] ; statistically optimised a bior - esponsive polymeric payload carrier to achieve this goal [ 28 ] ; proposed a novel class of macromolecular antimicrobial agents capable of locally triggered enzymatic activation at the infected site , retaining antimicrobial potency to match the conventional clinical equivalent whilst significantly reducing in vivo toxicity [ 29 , 30 ] . Ample evidence exists to support the notion that morbidity , mortality and quality of life outcomes in burn patients is associated to the organisms identified in this study . For example , wound infection with P . aeruginosa , E . coli , and K . pneumoniae wound is an independent predictor of mortality [ 3 , 31 ] . These bacteria also promote failure of healing [ 32 ] which is of major consequence to the management of extensive burn wounds by serial excision where time to healing is essential and donor sites for grafting come at a premium . Moreover , specific risk factors associated to burn wound infection with these organisms have been identified [ 33 – 35 ] , and modification of management practices may lower infection rates resulting in improved outcomes . The importance of identifying this set of organisms as the prime perpetrators of Gram - negative burn wound infection , regardless of the treating centre , is therefore apparent . P . aeruginosa ( Figure 2 ) exhibits an interesting , wider dispersion of dispersion of data compared to the other organisms . A possible explanation lies in the presence of an outlier data set [ 11 ] ( Table 2 ) , hence the long superior whisker for the P . aeruginosa plot in Figure 2 . However ANOVA , is remarkably robust to moderate departures from normality caused by outlier data sets . One possible explanation for this outlier may lie in the susceptibility of the standardised incidence of P . aeruginosa to the overall infection rate reported from the relative burn centre . In fact , the overall infection rate reported from this centre is also high [ 11 ] . Such a study presented unique difficulties . Mere presence of organisms on a wound does not imply infection . Histological documentation of infection into viable tissue may secure the diagnosis . However , in practice , few if any centres worldwide have the substantial resources required to fulfil laboratory diagnostic criteria such as routine microbiological tissue histology and electron microscopy on a daily basis . Moreover , definitions of burn wound infection underpinned by these ( tissue biopsy and electron microscopy ) laboratory investigations are largely consid - ered dated [ 36 , 37 ] . As a working definition , an organism was defined as causative if it could be discerned from the primary literature that the organism / s was isolated from the wound in the presence of clinical infection . Clinical diagnosis of infection was based on reconciliation of primary literature data to the definitions of Greenhalgh et al . [ 21 ] . Studies including re - infection or relapse in their incidence rates were excluded . Whilst the clinical surrogates presented in these definitions may be less specific then exhaustive ( but rarely performed ) laboratory investigations , the approach presented herein would reduce the potential bias presented by the resources available to the researchers producing the primary literature . As no RCTs were identified , the conduct of this review was adapted to consider the pooling of data from primary studies with heterogeneous methodologies . Systematic review of studies other than RCTs is well - established in the literature [ 21 ] . Therefore , a rigorous critical appraisal process qualified the ‘‘strength of the evidence’’ underpinning the primary data included in the statistical analysis . The critical appraisal process also facilitated the reconciliation of the primary literature to the operational definitions , ensuring comparability of the studies . Such an evidence - based approach is not new [ 12 ] . Quality of the evidence provided by the primary literature was limited ( Table 2 ) , justifying the use of an evidence - based methodology combined to the systematic review process . Since the burn centres in the primary literature were geographically separate and did not have overlapping catchment areas , it was reasonable to assume that ‘‘no interaction’’ occurred between the two independent variables studied . The selection of adequate inclusion and exclusion criteria was challenging . A rigorous approach in data retrieval was observed and catalogued to prevent retrieval bias . In order to minimise the possibility data contamination with lurking variables , stringent criteria were applied . Evidence exists that delayed transfer may influence the bacteriological flora burned patients [ 38 ] . Studies concur that delayed presentation may alter the pathological flora on a burn wound [ 3 , 39 ] . Military patients may pass through multiple facilities to the definitive site of treatment , and this delay presented a plausible lurking variable [ 38 , 40 ] . This data was therefore excluded purely as a necessity to safeguard methodo - logical rigour rather than implying a difference between military and civilian populations . In fact , data from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom suggests that similar bacterial flora is present in such patients , [ 38 , 40 , 41 ] . Indeed Figure 3 . Geographic distribution of the centres from which studies were critically appraised . The study design and sample size are provided in figure 2 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0095042 . g003 Gram Negative Burn Wound Infection PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95042 primary studies describing civilian injuries [ 22 , 42 ] were also excluded for similar reasons . A five to ten year cut - off for the retrieval of primary data is well - established in evidence - based methodology [ 12 , 43 ] . Such time - limits for the inclusion of primary data in evidence - based medicine harks back to the main works of Archie Cochrane and DL Sackett [ 44 , 45 ] , affirmed in the Sicily statement for evidence - based research [ 17 ] and cited in multiple works since then [ 46 – 48 ] . Moreover until the 1980’s burn wounds were treated by the exposure method , with application of topical antimicrobials to the burn wound surface and gradual debridement with immersion hydrotherapy [ 24 ] . Thereafter , early burn wound excision and wound closure became the focal point of burn wound manage - ment , accompanied by a change from immersion hydrotherapy to showering hydrotherapy , and a consequent decrease in the rate of burn wound infection [ 24 ] . It is also well - established that early excision has reduced the incidence of invasive infection , as underscored by key publications immediately preceding our cut - off point for retrieval of primary literature . Pruitt et al . in particular , assert that the change to early excision and grafting significantly changed , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the incidence and identity of organisms causing these infections and their timing [ 38 , 49 ] . It was assumed that by the year 2000 , this method of treatment would have been well - established , coinciding with the cut - off point determined by the evidence - based methodology . However , it is acknowledged that such arbitrary cut - off points may have led to retrieval bias in selection of primary literature . Conclusion This study is the first to report that organisms causing clinical Gram - negative burn wound infection do not differ significantly between burn centres . Therefore , these findings establish a ‘‘target set’’ of Gram - negative pathogens for antimicrobial development and timely , effective treatment . P . aerugionsa , K . pneumoniae , E . coli , Enterobacter spp . and Proteus spp . were identified as the commonest Gram - negative pathogens to be isolated from clinically infected burn wounds regardless of the treating centre . It is of course acknowledged that other bacteria may infect the burn wound and it is especially important to monitor emerging infections [ 51 ] . However , we hope that finding a ‘‘target’’ set of pathogens may contribute to timely clinical treatment , effective , and clinically oriented antibiotic development . The threat posed by multi - drug resistant pathogens continues to increase , however research and clinical management in this specialist field remain poorly funded , fragmented and oftentimes reported in isolation . The paucity of relevant literature highlighted in this study illustrates the dire necessity for further epidemiological multi - disciplinary collabora - tion . We augur that the identification of a common aetiological Gram - negative burn wound profile will be a first step in this direction . Supporting Information File S1 PRISMA Checklist .
