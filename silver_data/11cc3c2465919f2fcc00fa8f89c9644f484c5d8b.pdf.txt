Nature GeNetics VOLUME 42 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2010 489 Using microarrays , we identified de novo copy number variations in the SHANK2 synaptic scaffolding gene in two unrelated individuals with autism - spectrum disorder ( ASD ) and mental retardation . DNA sequencing of SHANK2 in 396 individuals with ASD , 184 individuals with mental retardation and 659 unaffected individuals ( controls ) revealed additional variants that were specific to ASD and mental retardation cases , including a de novo nonsense mutation and seven rare inherited changes . Our findings further link common genes between ASD and intellectual disability . Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) and mental retardation are two clin - ically distinct neurodevelopmental disorders with a complex genetic etiology . Both show a high degree of heritability , occur either as single entities or as combined entities , and are sometimes associated with genetic syndromes such as fragile X and Rett syndrome 1 . Mental retardation is defined as a substantially sub - average intellectual func - tion with limitations in communication , self - care , academic , social and interpersonal skills , often with cognitive deficits as measured by intelligence testing . Autistic disorder is the prototypic form of a group of conditions called the autism - spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) that share two main phenotypic dimensions , namely impairment in social communication and a pattern of repetitive restrictive behaviors ; these disorders have an onset before the age of three . Adding to the pheno - typic complexity in ASD is an ~ 40 % prevalence of developmental delay and / or intellectual disability ( broadly grouped as mental retar - dation ) , with intelligence as perhaps the most heritable component of the ASD phenotype 2 . Although the genetic and pathological basis of mental retarda - tion and ASD still remains largely unexplained , there has been some progress identifying disease - associated genes . In mental retardation , six autosomal and ~ 90 X - linked disease genes are now known 3 . In ASD , rare mutations have been found in the synaptic genes , such as NLGN3 , NLGN4 ( ref . 4 ) and SHANK3 ( ref . 5 , 6 ) . Moreover , de novo and rare inheri - ted copy number variation ( CNV ) of NRXN1 ( ref . 7 ) and the 16p11 . 2 locus , amongst others , have been found to associate with ASD 8 , 9 . Notably , some of the ASD susceptibility genes ( such as NLGN4 ) and CNVs ( such as 16p11 . 2 ) are also being found to be associated with mental retardation 10 , 11 . Initially , we performed a genome - wide microarray scan for CNVs using the Affymetrix 6 . 0 SNP platform in a German cohort of 184 unrelated individuals with mental retardation ( 111 males and 73 females ) . In a parallel study , we tested a series of 396 Canadian ASD cases ( 318 males and 78 females ) using the Affymetrix 6 . 0 and / or Illumina Infinium 1M - single SNP platform . All ASD cases were diagnosed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview – revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule measures ( Supplementary Methods ) . We identified de novo deletions of 120 kb and 69 kb affecting SHANK2 in single unrelated cases of European ancestry of the mental retardation cohort ( loss of exon 7 in MO1812A011 ) or ASD cohort ( loss of exons 6 and 7 in SK0217 - 003 ) ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . CNVs of SHANK2 were not observed in 5 , 023 ancestrally matched controls ( P = 0 . 011 ; see Supplementary Methods ) , and no exonic CNVs could be found in the Database of Genomic Variants . Both dele - tions disrupt the highly conserved PDZ domain of SHANK2 ( ref . 12 ) , leading to a frameshift mutation and presumably causing functional loss of one allele ( haploinsufficiency ) . The deletion in MO1812A011 was also verified in the subject’s fibroblast RNA ( Fig . 1c – d ) . SHANK2 is a member of a family of scaffold proteins ( comprising SHANK1 , SHANK2 and SHANK3 ) that all localize to postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses in the brain . Due to the discovery of rare de novo CNVs in SHANK2 , the protein’s postsynaptic localization and the fact that SHANK3 has already been associated with ASD , we considered SHANK2 as a candidate susceptibility gene for both ASD and mental retardation 5 , 13 . We sequenced the exons of the neuronal isoform of SHANK2 ( SHANK2 _ 1 , which lacks the ankyrin repeat ; see Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) using native DNA of the same 184 mental retardation cases and 396 ASD probands tested by microarrays . We completely sequenced 659 controls of European ancestry for the same exons as had been sequenced for the cases . We discovered one de novo nonsense mutation ( R462X ) , six different inherited missense variants ( R26W , P208S , S231Y , R1048W , T1127M and A1350T ) and a micro - duplication of six nucleotides ( L1008 _ P1009dup ) , all in individuals Mutations in the SHANK2 synaptic scaffolding gene in autism spectrum disorder and mental retardation Simone Berkel 1 , Christian R Marshall 2 , Birgit Weiss 1 , Jennifer Howe 2 , Ralph Roeth 1 , Ute Moog 3 , Volker Endris 1 , Wendy Roberts 4 , Peter Szatmari 5 , Dalila Pinto 2 , Michael Bonin 6 , Angelika Riess 6 , Hartmut Engels 7 , Rolf Sprengel 8 , Stephen W Scherer 2 , 9 & Gudrun A Rappold 1 1 Department of Molecular Human Genetics , Ruprecht - Karls - University , Heidelberg , Germany . 2 The Centre for Applied Genomics , The Hospital for Sick Children , University of Toronto , Ontario , Canada . 3 Department of Human Genetics , Ruprecht - Karls - University , Heidelberg , Germany . 4 Autism Research Unit , The Hospital for Sick Children , University of Toronto , Toronto , Ontario , Canada . 5 Offord Centre for Child Studies , Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences , McMaster University , Hamilton , Ontario , Canada . 6 Department of Medical Genetics , Institute of Human Genetics , Tübingen University , Tübingen , Germany . 7 Institute of Human Genetics , Rheinische Friedrich - Wilhelms - University , Bonn University , Bonn , Germany . 8 Max Planck Institute for Medical Research ( MPI ) , Ruprecht - Karls - University , Heidelberg , Germany . 9 Department of Molecular Genetics , University of Toronto , Ontario , Canada .

As the C - terminal region of SHANK2 , which includes the SAM domain , is crucial for correct localization at functional synapses 14 , the R462X variant may have lost this localization ability . One substi - tution , P208S , was detected twice , in the ASD case SK0332 - 003 and the mental retardation cases BO3 / 03 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . All other substitutions were found only once . None of these variants were detected in the controls ( 378 males and 281 females ) or in the NCBI dbSNP database ( build 130 ) . All new nucleotide variants detected in cases and controls are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . One SHANK2 mutation ( P208S ) resided within the SH3 domain , and the T1127M missense mutation was located within the highly con - served dynamin - 2 binding site ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The two deletions and the R462X nonsense mutation occurred de novo , whereas all missense mutations were familial and were transmitted through an unaffected parent . Co - segregation analysis in ASD families with multiple affected children ( comprising 33 % of the families in this study ; Supplementary Fig . 3 ) revealed that the C622T mutation at the highly conserved position P208S in indi - vidual SK0332 - 003 was passed from an unaffected mother to two male children with ASD and one other male sibling diagnosed with language delay ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Another amino acid change at a highly conserved position , A1350T , was transmitted from an unaffected mother to all three sons , who had variable phenotypic presentation ( respectively : autism , anxiety with autistic - like traits , and language delay ) . Notably , although both transmitting mothers were undiagnosed for an ASD , they both showed depression and / or anxiety ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . The clinical phenotypes of the analyzed subjects with SHANK2 muta - tions were variable . Whereas , for example , the two individuals with CNV deletions disrupting the PDZ domain both have ASD of com - parative severity and mild to moderate mental retardation , two other individuals with the P208S substitution showed either isolated severe mental retardation ( intelligence quotient ~ 35 ) or ASD with borderline intelligence ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Of the studied ASD cases hav - ing SHANK2 mutations , 63 % had an intelligence quotient of < 70 . Two of the four individuals with SHANK2 mutations ( MO1812A011 and TULB081863 ) , recruited due to their presentation of mental retardation , were subsequently also diagnosed as autistic using the ADOS measures . These data , together with previous literature , demonstrate a clinical overlap between these disorders , which may sometimes be explained at least in part by a common genetic etiology . Conservatively , we estimate that at least the two de novo deletions and the one de novo nonsense mutation seen here are penetrant mutations in SHANK2 . In addition , seven further variants at highly conserved positions were found only in affected individuals and not [ … ] [ … ] G G G G C C A A A G C T G A C A C A G T T A A C A A T A A C A A T G A G A A T G G G G G C C A A A G G T T T G A T T G A G a b Chromosome 11 Chr 11q13 c 242 bp 116 bp Upper band Lower band Deletion of 126 bp SHANK2 - CNVs Exon 6 Exon 6 Exon 7 Exon 8 SHANK2E ( NM _ 012309 . 3 ) CTD - 2591D19 CTD - 3244D21 CTD - 3053G20 SHANK2 _ 1 ( neuro ) ( AB208026 . 1 ) SHANK2 _ 2 ( neuro ) ( NM _ 133266 . 3 ) 3 ′ 3 ′ 3 ′ 5 ′ 5 ′ 5 ′ 3 ′ 5 ′ DHCR7 CTTN PPFIA1 FISH probes CTD - 3244D21 CTD - 2591D19 CTD - 3053G20 MO1812A011 SK0217 - 003 120 kb del 69 kb del Ex6 Ex7 d e H C SAM PDZ SH3 CNV R 26 W P 208 S S 231 Y R 462 X R 1048 W T 1127 M A 1350 T D Proline rich L1008 _ P 1009dup Exon 8 D N A H 2 O b r a i n N H D F M O 1812 A 011 5 ′ 3 ′ figure 1 Microdeletions and mutations of SHANK2 in mental retardation and ASD .

These rare transmitted variants display incomplete penet - rance , whose significance is uncertain at this time . Further analysis of those individuals harboring sequence variants at SHANK2 ( both inherited and de novo ) yielded additional rare CNVs that potentially contribute to disease ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . This finding , together with the observation that some individuals carrying rare inherited SHANK2 sequence variants do not express an ASD phenotype ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Table 2 ) , is consistent with a multigenic threshold model for autism 1 , 10 . We know little about the molecular mechanisms that initiate or stabilize synaptic growth and the molecules that lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements during synapse formation or remodeling . SHANKs are among the most abundant scaffolding proteins in the postsynaptic density . Together with HOMER , they were recently shown to form a mesh - like matrix structure that is required for the structural integrity of the dendritic spines and serves as an ‘assembly platform’ for other proteins residing within the postsynaptic density 15 . It is therefore conceivable that the SHANK proteins play an important role as central organizers of the postsynaptic density . The isolation of SHANK2 and the subsequent functional characteri - zation of SHANK2 mutants derived from individuals with ASD and mental retardation now paves the way for a deeper understanding of the biological processes affecting cognitive function involved in these disorders . SHANK2 loss - of - function mutations found in individuals with ASD and mental retardation are assumed to affect synaptic func - tion ( suggesting that CNV gain - of - function alterations may also be found in related or other disorders ) . These results , together with previous observations in genes involved in ASD , like SHANK3 and NLGN3 and NLGN4 ( also known as Neuroligin 3 and 4 ) , highlight the importance of intact postsynaptic structures for the development of typical cognitive function , language and social abilities .
