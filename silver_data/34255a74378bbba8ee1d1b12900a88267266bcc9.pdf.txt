POLARITY AND ENDOCYTIC TRAFFIC IN THE MAMMALIAN CELL Francis Kyei Bugyei A Thesis Submitted to the Graduate College of Bowling Green State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MASTER OF SCIENCE August 2014 Committee : Carol Heckman , Advisor Hans Wildschutte John Wade ii ABSTRACT Carol Heckman , Advisor Endocytosis involves selective packaging of substances in endosomes for traffic into cells . The cell traffic pathway can be grouped into two functional compartments : Compartment I which represents the early stages of sorting and Compartment II representing the final stage of trafficking and degradation . The sorting events and fate of molecules following uptake is dependent on a variety of cell signaling pathways . The tumor promoter , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) is known to cause transient loss of filopodia and increased pinocytosis in cells . Filopodia are finger - like plasma membrane protrusions of a number of animal cells containing receptors involved in cell sensing . In neurons where filopodia have been extensively studied , there is some evidence of increased endocytosis during filopodia retraction following encounters with repulsive cues . We hypothesized that , mammalian cells increase endocytic uptake during tumor promotion ( with loss of filopodia ) , and polarity may be connected to vesicle trafficking . PMA effects its action through activation of the enzyme protein kinase C ( PKC ) . To classify the traffic events in mammalian cells in tumor promotion , we selected conditions that enabled us to visualize the contents of Compartment II and compare them to the contents of Compartment I . To investigate the effects of PMA on trafficking three fluorescent markers were applied to rat liver cells of the IAR20 line . Using pixel - by - pixel analysis and image processing , we found an increased accumulation of fluorescent marker in compartments I and II in PMA - treated over the untreated cells . We also found that functional compartments I and II are trafficked in different directions inside cells . In another study on epithelial cells from the rat trachea , 1000W , we found iii an insignificant difference in fluorescent marker accumulated by endocytosis on the two halves of cells plated on a haptotactic gradient . iv To my late father , Kofi Boateng , whose encouragement made me believe I could accomplish anything , and my mother , Afua Nyame , for the wonderful support to my continuous education . v ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am very grateful to God for giving me the opportunity and wisdom to explore the wonders of his creation .

LITERATURE REVIEW 1 . 1 INTRODUCTION Endocytosis is the general term employed to describe the internalization of extracellular fluid or particles by invagination and pinching off of the plasma membrane . Endocytosis plays a variety of important roles in eukaryotic systems including nutrient uptake , scavenging of extracellular material , and internalization of receptor - bound ligands such as hormones , growth factors , lipoproteins and antibodies . These roles are essential for organismal homeostasis , helping to control a number of activities important in maintaining the integrity of a functional multicellular system . All eukaryotic cells exhibit one or more forms of endocytosis , with the diversity resulting from the individual cell functions ( 1 ) . One important property of endocytosis was first described by Elie Metchnikoff when he recognized that , materials taken up by endocytosis were degraded after encountering an acidic internal environment ( 2 ) . With the advances in molecular genetics , cell biology and high resolution imaging techniques , the basic organization of the endocytic pathway has been elucidated ( 1 , 3 - 5 ) . This knowledge has provided a fundamental agreement on the integral features of the pathway across different eukaryotic systems as illustrated in the figure below ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . 2 Figure 1 . 1 Illustration of the fundamental features of the endocytic pathway in a eukaryotic cell . This figure shows the connnections that exist endocytic traffic in eukaryotic cells . EE = early endosome , RE = recycling endosome , LE = late endosome , MP = macropinosome , PHS = phagosome , and LYS = lysosome . 3 A large number of receptor - ligand complexes start off at the clathrin - coated pits of the plasma membrane , which eventually pinch off to yield clathrin - coated vesicles . The released vesicles after losing their coats fusion with early endosomes ( EEs ) , a dynamic array of tubules and vesicles distributed throughout the peripheral and perinuclear cytoplasm . Ligands are dissociated from their respective receptors in the EEs due to their slightly acidic pH of about 6 . 0 - 6 . 8 ( 6 ) . This slight acidity is maintained by an ATP - driven proton pump ( 7 , 8 ) . Free receptors selectively accumulate in the early endosome’s tubular extensions , following which they bud off to form recycling vesicles ( RVs ) that transport receptors back to the plasma membrane to be reused . The dissociated ligands collect in the vesicular portions due to a difference in volume from the endosome’s tubular extensions collect in the vesicular portions of the EEs . The contents of these vesicles depending properties such as molecular weight , may be trafficked to the perinuclear cytoplasm on microtubule tracks , and fuse with late endosomes ( LEs ) and lysosomes ( 1 , 9 ) . Some vesicles , however , are left behind and share the fate of the RVs being exported out of the cell . In the LEs and lysosomes , ligands may be subject to degradation by a lower pH of 5 and the high concentration of lysosomal enzymes . Molecules such as dextran are accumulated in the lysosome . Although dextran is degraded by α - D - glucoside glucohydrolase , this occurs slowly in comparison to its rate of trafficking to the organelle . This property has made it a preferred label in studies of endocytosis , where they are usually tagged various fluorescent molecules ( 10 ) . Once in the lysosomes , ligand recycling is relatively slow or nonexistent . Thus , cells are capable of accumulating large amounts of internalized material once transported through the LEs and lysosomes . The endocytic pathway therefore can be thought of as having functionally and physically distinct compartments ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Early endosomes are responsible for sorting receptors and ligands , helping distinguish and preserve selected receptors from ligands to be internalized and 4 utilized by cells . Late endosomes are responsible for sorting components , and lysosomes are mainly responsible for digesting exogenous and endogenous macromolecules . With this knowledge however , it is quite challenging to distinguish these compartments by morphology due to the pleomorphic nature of endocytic organelles . An additional challenge of distinguishing compositional difference between compartments comes from the large quantities of membrane processed by the endocytic pathway ( 5 ) . However with the advent of biochemical , functional , and genetic probes for monitoring and manipulating the endocytic pathway and its organelles , a lot of information has been generated on the different types of endocytosis in cells . This body of knowledge has also provided an understanding of the variations responsible for generating specializations of the endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells . 1 . 2 TYPES OF ENDOCYTOSIS Endocytosis can be grouped into two classes , phagocytosis and pinocytosis , based on the nature and size of the particles internalized by cells as well as the morphology of the vesicle formed during internalization ( 5 , 11 , 12 ) . Phagocytosis describes the internalization of large particles , usually greater than 0 . 5 µm in diameter , which bind to specific plasma membrane receptors . These receptors are capable of causing their own uptake , usually by the formation of F - actin - driven pseudopods that envelope the bound particle during internalization . In contrast , pinocytosis involves internalization of fluids and smaller particles usually less than 0 . 2 µm in diameter . In pinocytosis , smaller vesicles carrying extracellular fluid and smaller macromolecules are internalized . The macromolecules may be specifically bound to the plasma membrane before internalization , but such binding can vary from strong to negligible interaction depending on the nature of the molecules . These vesicles are usually initiated at 5 clathrin - coated pits though other processes involving calveolae and / or an actin - based mechanism may be involved ( 1 , 11 ) . Figure 1 . 2 Classification of endocytosis based on morphology of portals . Transmission and scanning electron micrographs , and fluorescent micrographs illustrate structures known to be involved in endocytic events . Adapted with permission from ( 12 ) 1 . 2 . 1 Phagocytosis Phagocytosis , which involves the internalization of large particles ( > 0 . 5 µm ) , was thought to be associated only with specialized cells known as phagocytes until proven otherwise . 6 Phagocytic cells include protozoa such as Dictyostelium acanthamoeba , and leukocytes of the mammalian immune system such as macrophages and neutrophils . Phagocytosis is contact - activated , with uptake triggered by binding of opsonized particles to cell surface receptors capable of transducing a phagocytic stimulus to the cytoplasm ( 1 ) . This stimulus results in polymerization of actin at the sites of particle attachment and subsequent of an extension , called a pseudopod , that engulfs the bound particle into a cytoplasmic phagosome ( 1 , 13 , 14 ) . Phagosomes may rapidly fuse with endosomes and / or lysosomes so that the contents are degraded by their lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes ( 15 - 18 ) . Phagocytosis serves a principal first line defense mechanism against microorganisms in mammalian systems . It also provides an essential component of the humoral immune response by allowing the processing and presentation of bacteria - derived peptides to antigen - specific T lymphocytes ( 19 , 20 ) . In protozoa however , phagocytosis serve a nutritional function , as demonstrated in Dictyostelium discoideum mutants defective for phagocytosis ( 21 ) . The mutants eventually died of starvation due to the inability to feed on suspensions of bacteria . Studies on phagocytosis have showed that membrane receptors play an important role . Greenberg , et al . have shown that , in macrophages , Fc receptor - mediated phagocytosis of IgG - coated particles is associated with localized tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of cytoplasmic proteins ( 22 , 23 ) . This demonstrates the active recruitment of cytosolic src - family kinases to the Fc receptor cytoplasmic domain through its ITAM immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibition motif , a consensus motif ( 24 , 25 ) . Though it was previously believed that phagocytosis was restricted to specialized cells , transfection of Fc receptor cDNAs into normally non - phagocytic cells resulted in phagocytosis ( 26 ) . Furthermore , fibroblasts can be made to ingest IgG - coated particles as efficiently as macrophages by ensuring the appropriate src - family kinases are co - expressed , either as soluble proteins or as cytoplasmic domain 7 fusions to the expressed Fc receptors ( 27 ) . Thus in the presence of the appropriate receptor coupled to its corresponding signaling molecule , phagocytic mechanisms can be elicited and can be assumed common to many or all cell types . Phagocytosis can also be stimulated by external factors , such as bacteria surface proteins , that permit bacterial attachment and stimulation of one or more plasma membrane receptors , which stimulate membrane ruffling and subsequent engulfment of the bound agent , even by epithelial cells ( 28 - 30 ) . This kind of phagocytosis differs somewhat from that mediated by Fc receptors in leucocytes , in that pseudopod extension is not directed . Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have also developed mechanisms to evade by being destroyed by oxidative mechanisms or lysosomal digestion . Some pathogens evade destruction by immune phagocytic cells after internalization . They can escape from newly formed phagosomes by utilizing the acidic internal pH of the phagosome to activate lytic enzymes that rupture the vacuole membrane ( 31 ) . Others are capable of modifying the phagocytic process , resulting in the formation of modified vacuoles incapable of fusing with host cell endosomes and lysosomes ( 27 ) . This mechanism helps avoid triggering the cytotoxic respiratory burst which normally would destroy the pathogen . The respiratory burst , also known as oxidative burst , describes the rapid release of reactive oxygen species usually from mammalian immune cells , in response to encounters with bacteria or fungi . 1 . 2 . 2 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) have been found to be associated with the uptake of receptor - bound ligands and extracellular fluids in most animal cell types . The primary role of clathrin - coated pits ( refer to Figure 1 . 2 ) in ligand endocytosis was demonstrated by the correlation between the selective localization of receptor - ligand at coated pits and rapid ligand uptake ( 32 ) . It was shown that mutant receptors defective in endocytosis 8 were also lacking in coated pit localization ( 32 ) . Additional evidence has shown that , deletion of the single gene for the 180 - kDa clathrin heavy chain in Dictyostelium greatly suppressed pinocytosis , as well as inhibiting the internalization of at least one potential plasma membrane receptor ( 33 ) . CCVs were first identified in brain tissue of pigs , where they were found to be associated with the endocytosis of presynaptic membrane following synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( 34 ) . The clathrin assembly unit is called a triskelion , and consists of three 180 - kDa heavy clathrin heavy chains each complexed with a 30 - 35 kDa light chain ( 35 ) . When triskelions assemble into a coat , the legs interdigitate to create a lattice of open hexagonal and pentagonal faces ( 35 ) . Even though isolated triskelions can self - assemble into empty cages in vitro in the absence of energy sources , formation of invaginated coated pits on the plasma membrane has been found to require energy ( 36 , 37 ) . This suggests that , however favorable the energetics for clathrin self - assembly , it is not sufficient to mediate the entire process of endocytosis in cells . Clathrin also recruits coated - vesicle cargo through interactions with intermediary proteins known as adaptors ( refer to Figure 1 . 3 ) . 9 Figure 1 . 3 Mechanism of clathrin coat assembly and internalization during the endocytic process . A number of adaptors mediate processes such as such as coat assembly , excision , and membrane curvature dring the transport process . Adpated with permission from ( 12 ) . 10 The adaptors determine the selective inclusion of membrane anchored proteins into coated vesicles , and further form an interface between the proximal , cargo - bearing , membrane bilayer and the outer clathrin coat ( 38 - 40 ) . Adaptors are known to play a critical role in the attachment of clathrin to membranes ( 41 - 44 ) . Some adaptors are the first to be recruited to membranes in order to provide the binding site of clathrin coat assembly . Others have been conceived to induce membrane curvature thereby facilitating clathrin - mediated formation of invaginated coated pits ( 1 , 45 ) . Adaptors are also known to be involved in recruiting membrane proteins that selectively localize to clathrin - coated regions ( 46 ) . Known adaptors involved in this process include Adaptor ptotein complex 1 and 2 ( AP1 / 2 ) , Eps15 , espin , Fer / Cip4 homology domain only proteins 1 and 2 ( FCHo1 / 2 ) and , and intersectin ( 47 - 51 ) . Three central participants known to be involved in initiation of CCVs include AP2 , Phosphatidyl inositide - 4 , 5 , bisphosphate ( PI - 4 , 5 , P2 ) , and clathrin ( 52 ) . The essential role played by PI - 4 , 5 - P2 was demonstrated by experiments that showed the prevention of new coated pits formation from plasma membranes after acute treatment of cells with inhibitors of PI - 4 , 5 - P2 ( 52 ) . Other experiments have shown the absence of coated pits in cells depleted of PI - 4 , 5 - P2 ( 53 , 54 ) . While AP2 is mainly localized to plasma membrane coated pits , AP1 complexes are largely restricted to clathrin - coated buds of the TGN , responsible for interactions with proteins in the TGN ( trans golgi network ) that exit the Golgi complex via CCVs . AP - 2 recruits clathrin to membranes by binding weakly but specifically to lipid bilayers that contain PI - 4 , 5 - P2 as clathrin has no direct membrane contacts . A membrane - associated AP - 2 following a clathrin triskelion binding reaction brings with it an additional AP - 2 , which can associate with a second PI - 4 , 5 , - P2 in the membrane . The three - component cluster ( one triskelion and two AP2 complexes ) then shows a much longer membrane residence time ( 52 ) . Coated pit formation 11 proceeds by the sequential addition of clathrin triskellions and adaptors , generating a sharply curved invagination . Adaptor - mediated interactions with membrane - bound proteins and lipids deform the underlying membrane . FCHo1 / 2 are part of the complex that stabilizes the nascent coated pit and facilitates continued growth ( 52 ) . Dynamin mediates scission when the deformation has created a suitably narrow neck , and auxilin , which arrives immediately following scission , recruits Hsc70 to direct uncoating ( 55 , 56 ) . A number of accessory proteins associate with coated pits at specific stages of assembly and disassembly but their functions are less certain . Adaptor complexes also work together with accessory membrane proteins that function in the actual targeting of the CCVs to endosomes . Some of these proteins have been extensively studied , and include members of the v - or t - SNARE families involved in vesicle docking and / or fusion ( 57 ) . Cellubrevin , a v - SNARE identified in the endocytic pathway , does not function at the level of CCV fusion with EEs but rather at a later step in recycling ( 58 , 59 ) . The cytoplasmic domains of several receptors , as well as other membrane proteins that selectively accumulate at plasma membrane coated pits , contain specific sequence information that facilitates coated pit localization . Though these signals are somewhat degenerate , certain motifs are strongly represented in many of these localized proteins . Coated pit localization signals usually involve tyrosine residues placed in a context of one or more amino acids with large hydrophobic side chains ( 60 ) . There is another class of signals characterized by leucine residues as its most critical feature , with di - leucine based motifs being a common occurrence ( 61 , 62 ) . It can therefore be inferred that both tyrosine and di - leucine motifs clearly specify coat localization . Coated pit localization signals are not restricted to plasma membrane receptors alone , but have also been shown to reside on membrane proteins found in intracellular membranes . Most notable are the major membrane glycoproteins of the LEs and 12 lysosomes , lysosomal glycoproteins ( lgps ) , that have short cytoplasmic tails containing a conserved glycine - tyrosine sequence followed by a hydrophobic amino acid two residues toward their COOH - termini ( 63 ) . In a large number of cells , lgps reach their destination by transport directly from the TGN to the endocytic pathway via CCVs through recognition by AP1 and AP2 adaptor complexes ( 63 ) . The glycine residues play an important role in specifying interactions with AP - 1 and AP - 2 as alteration of the conserved glycine residues reduces sorting of newly synthesized Igp / lamps . These processes indicate that direct and specific protein - protein interactions drive receptor localization at clathrin - coated pits and by extension , in other sorting events . 1 . 2 . 3 Clathrin - independent endocytosis Other mechanisms of endocytosis are known to be independent of clathrin ( see Figure 1 . 2 ) ( 64 , 65 ) . This has been demonstrated by experiments where CCV formation was inhibited by genetics or specific chemical reactions . It has been observed that , under normal conditions , some plant or bacteria toxins are internalized in structures devoid of clathrin coats , and some of these uncoated vesicles deliver their contents to endosomes and lysosomes ( 66 ) . Also despite various treatments that effectively blocked the proper assembly of clathrin coats , cells still showed a certain degree of endocytosis of extracellular fluid ( 67 ) . Direct genetic evidence of clathrin - independent endocytosis first came from experiments in the yeast specie , Saccharomyces cerevisae . Several experiments convincingly demonstrated that yeast exhibit a process reminiscent of endocytosis in animal cells with the isolation and characterization of yeast mutants with conditional defects in α - factor uptake ( 68 - 72 ) . It was shown that , as in eukaryotic systems , receptor bound α - factor is internalized , appears in a population of non - lysosomal vesicles ( endosomes ) , and is finally delivered and degraded in the 13 vacuole ( lysosomes ) . Complete deletion of the gene for clathrin heavy chain was found to decrease but not to block the uptake of receptor - bound α - factor or the marker of fluid phase endocytosis , Lucifer yellow ( 68 ) . Also , the intracellular steps of the pathway involve ras - like GTPases that are directly homologous to the rab proteins that control fusion activities of early and LEs in mammalian cells ( 73 ) . Experiments involving mammalian cells have also demonstrated that elimination of clathrin function does not always block endocytosis . Dynamin , a GTPase known from genetic , morphological , and biochemical evidence is known to provide a critical accessory function in clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( 74 ) . It is proposed to provide the mechanochemical force to accomplish the final step in the budding process by complexing around the necks of invaginated coated pits ( 75 ) . Mutation of dynamin in mammalian cells has been shown to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 76 ) . This mutation however did not totally stop the endocytic process , but rather resulted in the rapid reduction of both receptor - mediated and fluid phase endocytosis with fluid uptake restored to normal within 30 - 60 minutes . These results expand on the hypothesis that , animal cells have a clathrin - independent pathway of endocytosis even though the exact mechanism is unknown ( 76 , 77 ) . There have also been studies on caveolae , another plasma membrane pit involved in endocytosis independent of clathrin coats . Caveolae were initially studied in endothelial cells and adipocytes . They were recognizable by their characteristic striations , which were thought to be formed by an accumulation of the integral membrane protein caveolin ( 78 - 80 ) . In the endothelium , caveolae are associated with endocytic transport of solutes across the cell , not necessarily via the route of endosomes to lysosomes ( 81 ) . They are also known to be associated with folate uptake through budding and immediate calveolae , a process referred to as potocytosis ( 82 ) . That , however , does not resolve the role played by caveolae in clathrin - 14 independent endocytosis as concrete evidence is lacking on whether it is an essential component of the trafficking machinery in many or most mammalian cells . 1 . 3 ENDOCYTOSIS , CELL POLARITY AND TUMOR PROMOTION 1 . 3 . 1 Cell polarity A large number of cells have mechanisms that enable them to detect extracellular gradients and move toward or away from higher concentrations . There are different types of stimuli that cells respond to , which have been discovered through experimental testing . Among those which have been studied by a number of in vitro cell biology , biochemistry , and genetic techniques are chemotaxis , haptotaxis and durotaxis . Chemotaxis describes the process by which cells respond to extracellular chemical gradients , and may alter physiological states depending on specific chemical signals and gradients . In durotaxis and haptotaxis , cells respond to rather ill - defined mechanochemical gradients but clearly these effect changes in physiology based on the physical substrates on which they are plated . Haptotactic gradients are produced by vapor deposition of inert metal atoms onto solid substrates such as glass coverslips . It was demonstrated that on a substrate sputtered with a heavy metal , the deposition of serum proteins was dependent on the type of metal used for coating ( 83 ) . This differential deposition produces a more attractive substrate where there is a dense deposition of metal atoms , and therefore more attractive to cultured cells . Durotaxis is associated directly with the mechanical softness or hardness , measured by Young’s modulus , of the gradient on which cells are cultured . Although it is thought that cultured cells respond to mechanical cues , through mechanosensitive channels that relay signals ( 84 ) , it can also be argued that protein deposition on the substrate is responsive to these same mechanical properties . Although the external signals differ in nature , they all contribute to similar intrinsic chemical changes in cells that produce specific reactions . These intrinsic chemical changes may contribute to alterations 15 in differentiation , proliferation , migration and other developmental processes . During embryogenesis , polarity is important for individual and group cell migrations events , organ formation , and wiring of the nervous system ( 85 ) . Cell polarity continues to play important roles in the adult , and is particularly crucial to processes such as immune cell trafficking during inflammation , regenerative processes such as wound healing , and maintenance of tissue architecture . Cell polarity mechanisms , mainly chemotaxis , have been thoroughly studied in Dictyostelium , neutrophils , and a number of transformed mammalian cells . In these cells , it has been postulated that chemoattractants activate G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( refer to Figure 1 . 4 ) , resulting in localized accumulation of signaling molecules , such as phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) , toward the high side of the gradient ( 85 ) . This accumulation of PIP3 leads to extension at the leading edge of cells , which is thought to be driven by localized Rac - mediated actin polymerization . The lipid phosphatase activity of Phosohatase and tensin homolog protein ( PTEN ) mediates localization of PIP3 to the specific sides of the cell ( 86 ) . PTEN is a cytosolic protein recruited to the membrane via several membrane anchored proteins including Par3 , microtubule - associated serine / threonine kinase ( MAST ) , membrane associated guanylate kinase ( MAGI ) , syntrophin - associated serine / threonine kinase ( SAST ) , etc . In primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) however , even though polarity is mediated by GPCRs , cells maintain uniform PIP3 levels throughout the membrane and migrate by extending actin - free protrusions ( 87 , 88 ) . These ‘non - actin’ protrusions may be generated by myosin - based contractions , which mediates migration at the lagging edge of neutrophils and Dictyostelium . The combination of forces at the leading and lagging edges , together with the balance of 16 extrinsic attractants , control rapid cellular movement . This can be visualized as a push - pull mechanism where a ‘push’ or a ‘pull’ is dependent on both intrinsic and extrinsic signals . Figure 1 . 4 Illustration of G - protein coupled regulation of cellular activities . Adapted with permission from ( 12 ) . Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) have also been found be involved in polarity through PIP3 accumulation and Rac - mediated actin polymerization at the leading edge ( 89 - 91 ) . 17 Fibroblasts and breast carcinoma cells can be stimulated with growth factors that mediate polarization by binding to RTKs . Actin - mediated events of fibroblasts and carcinoma cells are coordinated with myosin - based contractions at the lagging edge , which is regulated by Rho and calcium signaling . These combined regulatory factors contribute to a migratory response that occurs more slowly than that of amoeboid cells . In spite of the differences that exist in the migratory behaviors and signaling components of different cell types , the overall pathways that regulate chemical attraction are similar . Thus , the maintenance of spatial symmetry is an evolutionary conserved property from yeast to humans ( 85 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 Mammalian cell polarity regulation Mammalian cells are all involved in some form of directional sensing and polarity . Motile cells on a suitable substrate , in the absence of a stimulus , can crawl or they may sit still . If a chemoattractant is present , they move in a random way called chemokinesis . In chemotaxis , this motility is biased toward or away from a chemoattractant or chemorepellent respectively . The attraction or repulsion is controlled by molecular mechanisms that are responsive to the environmental cues . The molecular mechanisms that read and interpret the gradient are referred to as directional sensing and form an integral component of the cell’s internal compass . It is however essential to note that , motility and directional sensing are separable , since molecules within immobilized cells can move toward an external stimulus and mediate changes within the cell without necessarily altering cell positions on the substrates . Cell polarity is normally associated with cell - surface protrusions that are essential for motility , chemotaxis and haptotaxis . These pseudopodia - like protrusions are classified by differences in size and shape , together with other physiological characteristics . Different protrusions have been named differently by different investigators because of the difficulty in 18 developing criteria that can be used as a basis for classifying them . The problem of classification has however been addressed using a method based on 3D imaging combined with quantitative data ( 92 ) . The protrusion classes are summarized in Table 1 . 1 . This method of sampling shape geometrics has been used to generate values for several variables , including : 1 ) measures of contour length and curvature , 2 ) relationship of contour to derived model figures , 3 ) dimensions of each protrusion modeled as a triangle , and 4 ) measures of the areas covered by protrusions . The raw variables are then used to extract latent factors , which are theoretical variables corresponding to cell features ( refer to Figure 1 . 5 ) . This is a robust method for classifying protrusions in cultured cells . Well - studied protrusions include filopodia , lamellipodia and nascent neurites formed by cultured cells in different conditions . Lamellipodia are broad protrusions , typically found at the leading edge of the cell ( 93 ) . They are typically extended in the direction of travel during locomotion . During the process of wound healing , retracted cells at the wound edge extend filopodia and lamellipodia into the open space . These leading egde cells have been shown to develop a distinct polarized morphology , with lamellipodia and membrane ruffling localized only at the leading edge and not at the sides or the rear edge of cells ( 94 ) . Neurites are often defined as protrusions whose lengths exceed twice the cell diameter . In developing nervous systems , neurons first sprout budding structures called neurites , which eventually develop into axons . These nascent neurites arise from sites at the neuronal perimeter that are intitially marked by filopodia . Filopodia are small membrane protrusions found in numerous cell types in culture . Several studies have been focused on filopodia because of their proposed role as sensory appendages in cells . 19 Table 1 . 1 Relations of factor values for protrusions to morphology of the cell edge Classification Value increases with increases in Factor # 4 Factor # 5 Factor # 7 Factor # 16 Prevalence of filopodia Centripetal mass distribution Prevalence of nascent neurites Features more massive than filopodia but pointed Table taken from reference ( 93 ) , used by permission of Elsevier Figure 1 . 5 Illustration of edge features as obtained using 3D imaging and quantitation .

A ) High factor # 4 , B ) high factor # 5 , C ) high factor # 7 , and table showing factor values for the contours pictured . It should be noted that variables used to construct factor # 4 values are entirely confined to the cell edge , and its values are based on the outline of the cell edge . Values of factors # 5 and # 7 are based in part on information 20 from higher portions of the cell , but the edge contour supplies enough information to estimate these values . Illustration adapted with permission from ( 93 ) . Filopodia , like microvilli , consist of parallel actin filaments which generate these protrusions through interactions with a group of molecules at the plasma membrane . Actin filaments have intrinsic polarity , with one end favoring subunit addition ( ‘barbed’ end ) and the opposite ( ‘pointed’ end ) favoring subunit subtraction . The actin filaments are organized in parallel bundles with their barbed ends facing toward the plasma membrane . The fundamental process of seeding filament growth on the membrane is mediated by a variety of regulatory factors including the Rho GTPase , Cdc42 . Cdc42 is known to activate Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , which mediates filament assembly through interactions with Arp2 / 3 ( 95 ) . Arp 2 / 3 , a heterodimeric complex of Arp2 and Arp 3 , when activated , forms a structure resembling the triplet of actin monomers involved in the seeding of actin monomers . Also , a formin at the membrane facilitates fast addition of subunits , working with Ena / VASP . Filament bundling in filopodia is also mediated by a number of cross - linking proteins including espin , fascin , and plastin , which provide stability ( 96 ) . Fascin , a 58 kDa monomeric protein , is known to play an important role in actin bundling during filopodia formation . The arrangement of actin subunits in filaments may provide a suitable surface area for the active transport of cargo to the tips of these slender protrusions . Active transport is carried out by motor proteins which act in concert with other stabilizing proteins . Filopodia tips are known to contain a number of proteins , including integrin which is an essential component of focal adhesions ( 96 ) . Focal adhesions serve as signaling platforms that mediate communication between cells and their microenvironments . The classical view has been that cells use filopodia to probe the environment for cues and they function in the leading edge as pioneers 21 ( 97 ) . This may explain the importance of filopodia in physiological processes such as wound healing , angiogenesis , chemotaxis , morphogenesis and adhesion ( 93 ) . There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the filopodia pointing is a directional signal , and it maintains the persistence of locomotion in motile cells ( 93 , 96 - 101 ) . Integrins , which are essential components of focal adhesions , are heterodimeric cell surface adhesion receptors , which link the cellular cytoskeleton and signaling machinery to molecules of the extacellular matrix ( ECM ) . Members of the integrin family act as receptors for ECM proteins such as fibronectin , laminin , or collagen . The integrin family consists of 24 heterodimers formed from non - covalently associated α - and β - subunits . Each subunit has a large extracellular domain , a single membrane spanning region , and a short cytoplasmic domain , with the exception of the β4 subunit , which has a long cytoplasmic domain . The integrin family of vertebrates includes at least 18 distinct α - and 8 β - subunits . Integrins are known to be expressed at high levels on the surface of all anchorage - dependent cell types ( 102 ) . Many signaling molecules activated by integrins are implicated in the regulation of cell motility and survival . In regular focal adhesions , integrins are associated with a number of adaptor molecules including vinculin , talin , paxillin , FAK , p130Cas , and others through short cytoplasmic domains . Both α - and β - subunits of integrins contain conserved amino acid motifs involved in specific adaptor binding . The β - subunit contains two conserved NPxY - motifs known to bind a large number of proteins , many of which are integral in focal adhesions and signaling ( 102 ) . One such essential interaction is with myosin - X , a motor protein involved in the regulation of filopodia . There have been several proposed mechanisms involved in transmission of signals 22 from cell surface to intracellular signaling adaptors to effect changes . It is however unresolved how signals are transmitted through filopodia - integrin interactions . 1 . 3 . 3 Filopodia as mediators of cell polarity Filopodia have generally been described as ‘sensory protrusions’ or ‘antennae’ used by cells to probe their microenvironment ( 93 , 100 ) . Filopodia mediate guidance at the tips of developing neurites in growth cones capable of distinguishing different chemical cues in both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems . They have also been found to be concentrated at the growing tips of endothelium in developing blood vessels of adult animals , and at the dorsal closure in embryonic development ( 103 ) . Neuronal growth cones are motile actin - rich and microtubule - rich structures at the end of neurites that guide axons and dendrites to their proper targets . The correct reading and integration of the environmental cues is essential for precisely connecting and assembling the different parts of the peripheral and central nervous systems . Guidance is not only controlled by external cues , but through a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic cues . Growth cone and filopodia guidance to their targets is mediated through chemorepulsion , chemoattraction , contact - dependent repulsion , and contact - dependent attraction . 23 Figure 1 . 6 Illustration of molecules and their roles in filopodia formation . Adpated with permission from ( 93 ) Filopodia contain a variety of receptors involved in communication with a number of signaling and extracellular matrix molecules . Integrins and cadherins , which are important cell adhesion molecules , are often found at the tips of filopodia ( 104 , 105 ) . The integrins , have been found in the activated state , and thus primed to probe the extracellular matrix for signals ( 104 ) . Integrins subsequently recruit other focal adhesion complex components , as mentioned above , leading to the formation of mature focal adhesion plaques . The focal adhesions and associated F - actin structures finally reorganize resulting in the formation of focal adhesion anchored stress fibers ( 105 ) . 24 In a study on fibroblasts on micro patterned surface , it was revealed that inhibition of filopodia formation by the expression of a dominant - negative form of the small GTPase Cdc42 impaired cell spreading ( 106 ) . Filopodia sensing is associated with pathogen tracking and engulfing by macrophages . During this process , several filopodia after tracking and identifying a pathogen , bind to it and then retract toward the macrophage cell body ( 98 ) . Also inhibition of filopodia by formation by myosin VII in Dictyostelium discoideum caused a decrease in phagocytosis rates as well as inhibition of migration ( 107 ) . Filopodia have additional roles during the formation of adherens junction between epithelial cells , as well as a role during wound healing , dorsal closure and epithelial - sheet sealing in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos ( 108 , 109 ) . In all these processes , protruding filopodia from opposite cells probe the microenvironment and help sheets of cells to align and adhere together in a precise manner . Errors of misalignment of cells and tissues result in a variety of developmental problems in organisms . 1 . 3 . 4 Endocytosis and cell polarity regulation A number of studies have identified connections between endocytosis and cell polarity ( 103 ) . These studies related the balance of vesicle trafficking on opposite sides of cells to polarity and migration . Neurons during development go through a series of morphological changes that require alterations in the surface area by means of exocytosis and endocytosis ( 110 - 113 ) . This has been observed to occur through integrin signaling which controls the cytoskeletal machinery ( 110 ) . These studies have Tojima and coworkers to the hypothesis that axon guidance involves asymmetric vesicle trafficking through differentially regulating endocytosis and exocytosis across the growth cone . 25 Regulated membrane trafficking could eventually mediate processes such as receptor - mediated signal transduction , and downstream mechanical processes of cell reorientation . The growth cone can adjust its sensitivity to guidance cues by a process of adaptation , which depends on endocytosis - mediated desensitization and protein synthesis - dependent resensitization which is aided by exocytic traffic ( 114 , 115 ) . This coordinated vesicle trafficking mechanism has been proposed by a number of groups as essential for cell polarity and migration . Evidence of the connections between cell traffic and polarity has not only been found in neurons but also in eukaryotic cells of other tissues . A study at California Institute of Technology found a high expression of dynamin , a protein that mediates endocytosis , in human placenta as well as neurons ( 116 ) . This study further showed that , the speed of endocytic traffic is dependent on dynamin expression , and this may reflect its higher expression in cells where the speed of polarization is an absolutely essential property for function . Another study on mice fibroblasts also reported that , focal adhesion disassembly is regulated by microtubules through an unknown mechanism that involves dynamin ( 117 ) . This study , by means of fluorescent microscopy , showed that clathrin rapidly accumulated on focal adhesions during microtubule - stimulated disassembly and departed from focal adhesions with integrin upon their disassembly . Interfering with clathrin function prevented microtubule - induced focal adhesion disassembly . Delivery of new components to the membrane appears to be required for steering the cell . Silencing of VAMP2 , a SNARE protein that mediates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane , has been known to cause a significant reduction in cell surface integrin expression , with a resulting disruption of cell adhesion and chemotactic migration ( 118 ) . The tumor promoter , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , is also known to affect the pinocytosis in cultured cells ( 119 , 120 ) . 26 PMA has been reported to stimulate membrane ruffling activity in cultured cells within a few hours of exposure ( 121 , 122 ) . Ruffling involves the assembly and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton along the cell’s periphery . This reaction occurs through activation of the enzyme protein kinase C ( PKC ) , which adds a charged constituent to amino acid residues of various protein substrates . This cascade of reactions elicited by PMA treatment further leads to transient loss of filopodia from the surface of cells accompanied by an increase in endocytosis ( 122 ) . It has however been difficult to trace the causes of tumor promotion to any of the physiological processes regulated by PKC . PKC comprises a family of kinases which , when activated by diacylglycerol or its surrogate , PMA , phosphorylate a great number of substrates . The above summary of PMA - mediated effects suggests limitations in the biochemical approach to such effects , due in part to the difficulty of dissecting dynamic changes that occurs while altering the balance of endocytic and exocytic activity . Another way of approaching the problem is to design tests for the physiological functions affected by PMA treatment . It is possible that identifying physiological gateways or bottlenecks may lead to exclusion of certain mechanisms , e . g . the endocytic / exocytic balance , as explanations . To this end , the Heckman group showed an increased endocytic uptake of horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) in PMA - treated cells as compared to the controls ( 120 , 122 , 123 ) . They applied a model first described by Besterman et al . ( 124 ) and Steinman et al . ( 125 ) to classify this uptake . Two functional compartments were described to define the endocytic trafficking of fluid - phase markers in terms of functional compartments ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . 27 Figure 1 . 7 Experimental model of the functional endocytic compartments . Compartment I represents the early endosomal stages where rates ã and represent initial uptake and recycling ( efflux ) respectively . Compartment II represents the late endosomal / lysosomal stages where there is little to no exchange with compartment I . Rate represents maturation into compartment II while rate represents turnover of the contents of compartment II . M represents total volume of the cell . Adapted with permission from ( 119 ) . Compartment I describes the early endosomal stage where substances trafficked into cells by endocytosis are sorted , and either processed for efflux back into the ECF through recycling endosomes or trafficked further to the late endosomal / lysosomal stage . Compartment II describes the late endosomal / lysosomal stage , marking the final destination of traffic , where there is insignificant efflux back to compartment I . Kinetic measurements in PMA - treated cells showed not only an increased endocytosis but also a constant accumulation of marker in compartment II consistent with the rate of endocytosis ( 119 ) . Limitations of the previous work did not allow for the studies of the dynamics of compartment I during PMA treatment . Also the variability in accumulated HRP among different cells contributed a problem in the 28 analysis of results . With the evidence presented , using fluorescent microscopy and stringent image analysis , snapshots in time of both compartments were obtained and classified using pixel - by - pixel analysis of endocytic marker accumulation . It was hypothesized that , the balance between endocytosis and exocytosis in mammalian cells is associated with directional sensing . This hypothesis has been explored by Tojima and group concerning directional sensing in the nervous system during the development of neurons ( 103 ) . This is however not well characterized in other mammalian cells such as epithelial cells . The difficulty in studying polarity in a number of mammalian cells is compounded by their lack of structural changes during polarization . Changes in endocytic traffic patterns inside cells , by fluorescent visualization , could help characterize another method of studying intrinsic polarity . Furthermore , transient disappearance of filopodia has been observed in cells treated with PMA ( 122 ) . Our prediction , in line with the Tojima hypothesis , was that transient disappearenace of filopodia following PMA treatment is accompanied by increased endocytosis . Another prediction was that , cells plated on a gradient substrate will increase endocytosis on the non - attractive side with a resulting increased fluorescent marker accumulation ( Figure 1 . 8 ) . Thus cells the balance between influx and will efflux will favor influx on the non - attractive side and efflux on the attractive side . 29 Figure 1 . 8 Experimental model of a motile cell on a haptotactic gradient . Some mammalian cells tend to increase filopodia formation towards the side of the gradient substrate with increased metal deposition . The attraction is as a result of the increased concentration of serum proteins ( from growth medium ) supplanted on the metal atoms . The method for preparing the gradient substrate is explained in detail in the materials and methods section . 1 . 4 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL Studies have shown that , retention of molecules following endocytic uptake is dependent on time as well as molecular weight ( 126 ) . High molecular weight substances have a higher retention rate , during sorting in the early endosome and trans - Golgi network , than their lower molecular weight counterparts . By using 30 different fluorescent markers with varying molecular weights at different exposure times , snapshots were obtained of the same cells containing different fluorescent markers . With previous knowledge of the influx and efflux dynamics of IAR20 cells , we aim to develop a better model of endocytic trafficking in these cells . ( A ) 31 Figure 1 . 9 Stair step model of the endocytic traffic through functional compartments I and II . The stair step model shown in ( B ) describes our hypothesis of endocytic traffic through compartments I and II of our previously described model ( A ) . Blue ( Blue - dextran ) , red ( CY3 - dextran ) , and green ( FITC - dextran ) describe the emission colors of the different fluorescent endocytic markers used in the experiment . The bottom of the stair step ( compartment I ) is characterized by either recycling back to the ECF or traffic through the transitional compartment to compartment II . At the peak ( compartment II ) however , molecules tend to accumulate in the lysosomes where there is little to no recycling to compartment I or the ECF . These reactions are dependent on time and , to a small extent , molecular weight of the substance being transported . ( B ) 32 CHAPTER 2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 CELL CULTURE AND CHEMICALS The IAR20 cell line was derived from liver cells of inbred BD - VI rats and was maintained at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 in 60 - mm tissue culture dishes ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) with Williams Medium E ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) . The 1000W cell line was generated by treatment of a heterotopic tracheal transplant from a Fisher rat with 7 , 12 - dimethylbenz ( a ) anthracene . The line was maintained under routine conditions in 60 - mm tissue culture dishes with Waymouth ' s medium ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum supplemented with 0 . 1 μg / ml insulin and 0 . 1 μg / ml hydrocortisone . A calcium - and magnesium - free Hanks balanced salt solution ( CMF - HBSS ) with trypsin and EDTA was prepared for removing confluent / subconfluent cells from the culture dishes . For the preparation of CMF - HBSS EDTA solution , 50 ml of 10X CMF - HBSS ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) and 0 . 875 g Na - EDTA were dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water . The pH indicator , 10 mg phenol red ( Matheson , Cincinnati , OH ) , and 175 mg NaHCO 3 ( Matheson , Norwood , OH ) were dissolved in deionized water to a final volume of 400 ml and combined with the CMF - HBSS EDTA solution . To adjust the pH , 1N NaOH was added until the liquid turned a cherry red color . Deionized water then was added to a final volume of 437 . 5 ml , and the solution was autoclaved . The trypsin working solution was prepared by adding 20 ml of 0 . 5 % trypsin - EDTA ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) to 80 ml of CMF - HBSS EDTA solution . It was tested for sterility by addition of 50 % sterile Williams medium E with 10 % fetal bovine serum , followed by incubated at 37 o C , 5 % CO 2 for 48 hours . The dish was observed microscopically for contaminants . 33 Cytoskeletal buffer was prepared at a pH of 6 . 2 using 150 mM potassium chloride , 5 nM magnesium chloride , 5 mM EGTA , and 5 mM 4 - morpholineethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) sodium salt using deionized water as diluent . CY3 - Dextran ( 70 , 000 MW ) was purchased from Nanocs , Inc ( New York , NY ) . Lysosensor yellow / blue - Dextran ( 10 , 000 MW ) was purchased from Life Technologies ( Grand Island , NY ) . Goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 acetate ( PMA ) was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . The stock solution was stored at - 70° C until added to cultured cells . N - Ethyl - N ′ - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDAC ) was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich and made up at 4 % by dissolving 12 g of powder in 300 ml of cytoskeletal buffer at a pH of 7 . 2 . PMA was added directly to the tissue culture medium as a 1 : 500 aliquot ( 2 nM final concentration ) . The goat anti - mouse FITC marker was delivered for 22 minutes in the absence of PMA for both experimental and control samples . Subsequent treatment times for PMA were 8 min with CY3 - Dextran and 2 minutes with Lysosensor - Dextran in the experimental samples . The control samples received only the markers during this time . 2 . 2 SUBSTRATE PREPARATION No . 1 . 5 uncoated round glass coverslips of 25 - mm diameter ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) were cleaned for 1 hour with 1 M HCl followed by rinses in deionized water and absolute ethanol . The cover glasses were sterilized 1 hour under UV light before cells were put on them . Uncoated coverslips were used for the IAR20 cell culture experiment . For attaching 1000W cells , the coverslips were coated with a platinum gradient in a high vacuum coater ( Denton , NJ ) to produce a haptotactic gradient before cell culture . 34 Nine coverslips were mounted on a stationary table in the coater and a 2 - cm length of platinum wire ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) was evaporated at a resistive current of 12 amps for 5 min . The platinum was secured in a tungsten basket positioned at a distance of 4 cm and a height of 1 . 5 cm from the coverslips being coated . The wire was found to be completely evaporated from the source , a tungsten basket , by 5 min . Coating was performed in a vacuum of 2 x 10 - 5 torr . 2 . 3 PREPARATION OF IAR20 CELLS FOR IMAGING Cells from the IAR20 line were grown to confluency under the same conditions as above ( see Cell Culture and Chemicals ) . Confluent cells were removed from the surface of the dish using trypsin - EDTA , and the trypsin reaction was stopped using Williams medium E with 10 % fetal bovine serum . The cells were centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 2 minutes and transferred into dishes containing glass coverslips at a density of 200 , 000 cells per 25 - mm dish . The cells were incubated for 12 hours at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 to allow the cells to attach and spread on the substrate before treatment with endocytic markers . The culture dishes were labelled as experimental and control groups before treatment . All endocytic markers - 1 mg / ml GAM - FITC , 1 mg / ml Dextran - Cy3 , and 1 mg / ml Lysosensor , were made up in Williams medium E with 10 % fetal bovine serum and preincubated for 30 min at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 , before treating cultured cells . The GAM - FITC marker was used at a concentration of 1 mg / ml to label the lysosomal compartment . GAM - FITC was delivered for 20 min in the absence of PMA for both experimental and control samples . This medium was aspirated , followed by a quick rinse with pre - incubated Williams medium E at 37 o C to remove excess GAM - FITC and then addition of 1 mg / ml of CY3 - Dextran . Subsequent treatment times were 8 min with CY3 - Dextran and 2 min with Lysosensor - Dextran in the experimental samples . 35 2 nM PMA was added to the pre - incubated solutions of Dextran - CY3 and Lysosensor - Dextran for the experimental treatments only . The CY3 - Dextran solution was replaced with 1 mg / ml Lysosensor - Dextran solution for a period of 2 min followed immediately by fixation in 3 % EDAC in cytoskeletal buffer . Samples were mounted in Immunofluor mountant ( ICN Pharmaceuticals ) . The coverglass edges were sealed with clear nail polish to prevent drying , and the samples were stored at 4 o C for 24 hours before imaging . 2 . 4 PREPARATION OF 1000W CELLS FOR IMAGING The cells were grown to confluency in a 60 - mm tissue culture dish . Confluent cells were then removed from the surface of the surface of the dish using trypsin - EDTA , centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 minutes , and transferred to a 25 - mm tissue culture dish containing glass coverslips . The density was 200 , 000 cells per dish . The trypsin reaction was stopped using Williams medium E with 10 % fetal bovine serum . The cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 to allow for attachement of cells to the substrate before treatment with endocytic markers . The culture dishes were randomly separated into experimental and control groups , and labelled as such before treatment . The endocytic labelling markers - 1mg / ml GAM - FITC , was made up in Williams medium E with 10 % fetal bovine serum , and preincubated for 30 minutes at 37C and 5 % Co2 before treating cultured cells . The cultured cells were treated with endocytic marker for approximately 2 minutes , and fixed immediately using 3 % EDAC in cytoskeletal buffer for 15 minutes . Excess fluorescent label was rinsed three times with PBS and the slides mounted on a glass slide using Immuno fluor ( ICN Pharmaceuticals ) as mountant . The sample edges were sealed with clear nail polish to prevent drying , and stored at 4 o C for 24 hours before imaging . 36 2 . 5 IMAGING Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence light microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc ) using the Plan - Neofluar 100x / 1 . 30 oil objective lens ( Carl Zeiss , Inc ) . Digital images ( 12 bit ) were obtained using a Micromax 1300 YHS CCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Trenton , NJ ) with 1300 x 1030 imaging array , and spatial resolution of 6 . 7 x 6 . 7um pixels . Images were acquired with exposure times of 3 seconds using a FluoArc mercury lamp ( Carl Zeiss , Inc ) . A Zeiss Axioline slider ( Carl Zeiss , Inc ) with three filter sets ( Chroma , VT ) was used to excite FITC , Cy3 , and Yellow / Blue at 495nm , 550nm , and 345nm respectively ( Life Technologies , NY ) respectively . Fluorescent signals were collected at emission wavelengths of 519 nm , 570 nm , and 455 nm for FITC , Cy3 , and Lysosensor Yellow / Blue respectively . 2 . 6 IMAGE PROCESSING For the IAR20 cell analysis , the 3 channels ( corresponding to GAM - FITC , Dextran - Cy3 , and Dextran - Lysosensor ) of the fluorescent images were first corrected for microscope misalignment and uneven illumination . Image alignment was performed by using Cell Profiler ( Broad Institute , Boston , MA ) to create a mask on the misaligned areas , followed by manual cropping in Metamorph ( Molecular devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . The uneven illumination was corrected in Metamorph by performing an inclusive threshold to determine the upper and lower threshold limit of the background . The upper threshold limit of the background of each image was then subtracted from the image . Since negative intensity values were not allowed , this procedure resulted in zero background intensities . The images were then cropped to single cells for each channel , and pixel - by - pixel intensity values were obtained from each cell using MatLab R2014a ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . These values were stored in Microsoft Excel worksheets . 37 For the 1000W cells , following background subtraction as above , each cell was divided into two equal halves using the region selection tool . This was done to enable the separate analysis of the left and right halves , which corresponded to the attractive and repulsive directions on the haptotactic gradient . The integrated intensity and integrated optical density ( OD ) were determined for each half using the integrated morphometric analysis menu , and the data were stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for further analysis . 2 . 7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF ENDOCYTIC ACTIVITY For the IAR20 cells , the pixel - by pixel intensity data for each cell and endocytic marker were compiled and computed using SAS / STAT ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Because of their low intensity values , the Lysosensor Yellow / Blue signal images were not used in the analysis . Then , the corresponding pixels from the cell that contained a value of zero in both channels ( CY3 / FITC ) were eliminated from the analysis . Graphical representations of the data computed in SAS / STAT were produced in Minitab 17 ( Minitab , Inc , State College , PA ) . The sum of the intensities ( integrated intensity ) for each cell and the corresponding histogram for each channel was computed and displayed with MatLab R2014a . The image color maps for each channel per cell were also obtained with MatLab R2014a . The ratio images were obtained with Metamorph . For the 1000W cells , the integrated intensity and integrated OD data for each half of the cell were computed and plotted in Microsoft Excel software . 38 CHAPTER 3 . RESULTS 3 . 1 KINETICS OF COMPARTMENT II MARKER TRAFFIC Previous studies on endocytosis in several cell types have demonstrated that , internalized materials that are sorted at the early endosomal stage are either recycled back to the membrane and ECF , or trafficked into the late endosomal and lysosomal compartment . Trafficking is time - dependent with an exponentially increased accumulation of endocytic marker in the lysosomes with time . Previous studies by many other laboratories showed that uptake and accumulation were enhanced in cells treated with PMA ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . Fluid flow rates ã and represent influx and efflux of compartment I respectively , whereas rates and represent influx and efflux of compartment II respectively . The amount of substances carried by rates ã , , , are a , b , c , and d respectively . Filling of compartment II is dependent on rate , and the pool of endocytosed contents drawn on for compartment II depends on the balance between rates ã and . This balance between recycling and maturation into compartment II ultimately decides the accumulation . Attempts to determine the rates and in the treated cells , compared to controls , were unsuccessful to date . As compartment I is loaded at a higher rate , the concentration of marker in the cell is expected to be greater at all experimental times . The expectation would be violated only if the volume of compartment I expanded to exactly compensate for the increased uptake rate . Otherwise , the amount of marker trafficked to the extracellular fluid and to compartment II is necessarily greater . Thus , the determination requires distinguishing whether these enhanced rates of marker trafficking also depend on a change in either the rates or , or both . Also , the variability in the cell populations assayed by biochemical means compounds the difficulty in making this experimental determination ( 123 ) . 39 Plots of the average values obtained from four instantaneous uptake experiments by Christopher Runyeon suggested that the influx was remarkably linear over short periods of time ( 119 , 120 ) . PMA - treated samples already showed greater uptake at the shortest time that was feasible to assay , however , and the standard deviations of the data values were large ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . Figure 3 . 1 Relative amount of fluid - phase marker influx over time in PMA - treated cells versus controls . The marker , HRP , was added at a final concentration of 1 mg / ml to cells in replicate dishes , which were then incubated for the indicated times . In control dishes , the solvent vehicle was added simultaneously with HRP . In experimental dishes , PMA was added to a final concentration of 2 nM . Each point on the curve represents the average amount of HRP in the cells as determined by assaying the HRP enzymatic activity . Details of the experimental methods can be found in reference ( 120 ) . Error bars represent the standard deviation . 40 The linear time course shown is superimposed on the actual time course of accumulation in Appendix A , in order to visualize the effect of trafficking into Compartment II . In previous work with the HRP marker , we measured the efflux from the physiological compartment I . The data , shown in appendix A ( 120 ) suggests that efflux is essentially complete by 12 minutes . Similar conditions were chosen here , so that the predictions from the original work could be tested experimentally . The time permitted for efflux in the current work is designated by an arrow on the experiment with HRP flux ( shown in Appendix A ) . Quantification of accumulation by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis showed the amount of FITC retained was greater after sequential influx and efflux in a few of the PMA - treated cells than controls . Whereas most of the cells showed integrated intensity between 5 x 10 6 and 1 . 75 x 10 7 , a fraction of ~ 10 % of the PMA - treated cells showed very high intensity values . This increase was demonstrated in histograms of integrated intensity ( summed gray levels ) per cell ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . It is important to note that integrated intensities of FITC reflect the marker in compartment II , which was loaded in the absence of PMA . However , values of > 2 . 6 x10 7 intensity were only found when PMA was present , as shown in Figure 3 . 2 . This was an unexpected result . Not only were both cell populations loaded with FITC marker under the same conditions for 20 minutes , but the amounts effluxed in the presence of PMA were known to be greater than in control untreated cells ( see Appendix A ) . Although the number of cells showing an increased integrated intensity was small , they did represent 4 out of 45 cells or around 9 % of the total PMA - treated cells . Trivial explanations for the difference were ruled out , as explained in Figure 3 . 2 . 41 Figure 3 . 2 Histograms of FITC integrated intensity ( sum of gray levels ) for two cell populations . ( A ) Distribution of intensity values for 45 PMA - treated cells , ( B ) Distribution of intensity values for 32 untreated cells . The average background intensity subtracted from the Number of cells ( A ) Number of cells ( B ) Integrated intensity Integrated intensity 42 images was 302 and 318 for the 45 PMA - treated and 32 untreated cells , respectively . This represented a small increment but did allow higher integrated gray levels to be observed in the PMA - treated cells . This increase was compensated for by the difference in cell size ( pixels ) between the PMA - treated and control cells . The 45 PMA - treated and 32 untreated cells had an average size of 46722 and 47993 pixels respectively . Comparison of the gray level values on a pixel - by - pixel basis was performed for both cell populations in the experiment to determine the range of pixel intensities across cell populations . Control cells showed a greater number of dim pixels , i . e . those with values from zero to around 200 , when compared to PMA - treated cells ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . This result could have arisen from several effects . Although PMA is known to cause some cultured cells to round up ( 121 , 122 ) , this effect was ruled out with the results of average size of cells in each population using pixel count . Information on the size of the respective cell populations was performed by counting the pixels contained in each whole cell . After cropping , the PMA - treated cells were enclosed in a smaller frame , but the difference was very slight ( see Figure 3 . 2 legend ) . The data on the cell sizes is shown in Appendix B . 43 1785 1530 1275 1020 765 510 255 0 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 FITC P e r c e n t Histogram of FITC 1785 1530 1275 1020 765 510 255 0 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 FITC P e r c e n t Histogram of FITC ( B ) ( A ) 44 Figure 3 . 3 Histogram showing the percentage distribution of FITC gray levels of pixels for the control and PMA - treated cell populations . ( A ) and ( B ) show the percentage distribution of FITC in the PMA - treated and control cells respectively . ( C ) shows the overlay of the histograms and demonstrates the comparative distributions for treated ( black ) and control ( grey ) cell populations . PMA - treated cells , overlaid in gray , include many pixels with values above 1070 . Moreover , the pixels with ranges 535 to 1070 are somewhat overrepresented in cells from the PMA - treated population . These data clearly show that the difference in marker retention is a real finding and not a result of a trivial difference in the conditions used for acquiring or processing the images . This however represents a slight difference between the treated and ( C ) 45 control cells which was an expected finding , since they were both treated without PMA during FITC incubation . The main aim of treating both cell populations at this stage without PMA was to establish a standard for comparison with FITC . Though there was a slight difference between them , it was not quite as pronounced as in the subsequent fluorescent dye treatment . 3 . 2 MARKER FOR COMPARTMENT I AND TRAFFICKING INTO COMPARTMENT II CY3 marker was delivered in order to represent the dynamic loading of compartment I and transition of the marker to compartment II in experimental and control cells . These processes can be visualized as going up the stair steps ( as modeled in Figure 1 . 9 ) . Quantification of accumulation by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis showed an increase in CY3 accumulation in the PMA - treated cells as compared to the controls after an incubation period of 10 minutes ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . In previous experiments , Christopher Runyeon found that PMA - treated cells took up more HRP than controls . By 10 minutes , the treated and control cells contained 0 . 577 and 0 . 297 ng / 10 5 cells , respectively ( 120 ) . The treated cells had 1 . 9x the amount of HRP . This difference in CY3 - dextran accumulation was reflected in the comparison of histograms of integrated intensity ( summed gray levels ) per cell ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . The histograms show that , above the level of 7 . 8 x 10 7 , there were only 3 control cells as compared to 7 PMA - treated cells . These represent 9 . 4 % and 16 % of the cells sampled in the experimental population . Moreover , values > 9 . 2 x10 7 intensity were only found in the treated cells and the cells with the highest accumulation showed values of 1 . 5 x 10 8 , as shown in Figure 3 . 4 ( A ) . The enhanced accumulation in treated cells certainly reflects an increase in rate ã , as mentioned above . It is unknown whether there is an increase in rate with PMA treatment . 46 Figure 3 . 4 Histograms of CY3integrated intensity ( sum of gray levels ) for two cell populations . A ) Distribution of intensity values for 45 PMA - treated cells , B ) Distribution of intensity values for 32 untreated cells . The latter distribution shows only 3 cells in the categories above the level 7 . 8 x 10 7 . Comparison of the pixel - by - pixel gray levels for both cell populations in the experiment was undertaken for the CY3marker . The control cells showed a greater number of dim pixels when compared to the PMA - treated cells ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Number of cells Integrated intensity ( A ) Number of cells ( B ) Integrated intensity 47 A fraction of the pixels represented at values ~ 400 and below were missing in the experimental cell population , which showed instead an increase in values of ~ 900 and greater . Moreover , at all gray - level values above 1500 , the percentage of pixels represented in the collective PMA - treated population exceeds that in the control cells . A comparison of the histograms shows that PMA - treated cells have many pixels with values above 2800 ( see Figure 3 . 5 ( C ) ) . Conversely , values between 1000 and 1350 are more represented in untreated cells ( shown in white ) , suggesting that this intensity range represents compartments with less marker . From the results above it can be concluded that , the treated cells contain a greater number of areas contining concentrated CY3 vesicles which represent the transition between compartment I and II . These results suggest that , the increase in pinocytic accumulation caused by PMA treatment may occur through increased influx of materials into both compartment I and II . ( A ) 48 Figure 3 . 5 Histograms showing the distribution of CY3 gray levels of pixels for treated ( A ) and control cell populations ( B ) . ( C ) Overlay of the histograms showing comparative distributions for treated ( black ) and control ( white ) cell populations . ( B ) ( C ) 49 3 . 3 PMA - DEPENDENT DIFFERENCES IN ENDOCYTIC MARKER INFLUX AND COMPARTMENTALIZATION Quantification of the FITC and CY3markers accumulated in the cells showed greater amounts of CY3 than FITC in both PMA - treated and control cells . This was consistent with expectations ( see Introduction ) . The relationship was reflected in the histogram of the difference ( CY3 - FITC ) between gray level intensities of markers in each pixel . The data mainly represent areas inside the cells , because nearly all of the pixels in the background were converted to zero by the background subtraction procedure . The difference in CY3 over FITC is represented by the areas greater than zero on the horizontal axis in Figure 3 . 6 . The vertical axis shows the percentage of pixels by each difference value . As predicted , the intensity of CY3 is greater in PMA - treated cells . The difference in CY3 over FITC in these cells is represented by a range 0 to 2850 whereas the difference in the control cells ranges from 0 to 2350 . In a few pixels the FITC intensity is greater than CY3 ( less than zero on the horizontal axis ) , and there is still a greater range ( 0 to - 480 ) in the PMA - treated cells as compared to the controls ( 0 to - 300 ) . Comparing this distribution with the integrated intensity for the whole cells ( Figure 3 . 3 ) , it appears that the intensity in certain PMA - treated cells is higher than the control . In some locations , it exceeds the intensity of the CY3 marker . It can be concluded from the above results that , an number of areas of the PMA - treatment causes an increased traffic into both functional compartment I and II . 50 ( A ) ( B ) 51 Figure 3 . 6 Histograms of difference between CY3 and FITC pixel - by - pixel gray level intensities for treated ( A ) and control cell populations ( B ) . ( C ) Overlay of the histograms showing comparative distributions for treated ( black ) and control ( white ) cell populations . The possibility that areas with extremely high and low intensity of markers represent structural compartments was further investigated by imaging techniques . Since markers are carried inside small vesicles that resemble bubbles in the cytoplasm , their localization might reveal features related to those described in the experimental model ( see Figure 1 . 5 ) . The intensity of each marker was represented in color map images , called heat maps , to illustrate the compartmentalization of the markers . FITC is a label of functional compartment II . In contrast , CY3 marker represents influx into portions of Compartment I and transition between compartment I and II . As expected based on the fact that CY3 was a more intense marker , the intensity color maps showed a difference in the areas occupied by CY3 and FITC markers inside the cells . The comparison of the FITC and CY3 distribution for a treated cell is imaged in Figure 3 . 7 . ( C ) 52 Whereas the FITC marker was typically localized on one side of the cell , the CY3 marker appeared to be more distributed through the majority of the cell area . Of the PMA - treated cells , 93 % showed an eccentric localization of the FITC marker while this localization pattern was represented in 97 % of the control cell population . The eccentric localization describes the distribution of marker in the poles of the cell ( away from the center ) . The typical appearance of the markers in a control cell is shown in Figure 3 . 8 . In some cases , the concentration of the two markers occurred on the opposite sides of the cell . The following results demonstrate the functional compartmentalization exhibited by cells . Though the traffic pattern cannot be explained , it can be concluded that , markers incubated with cells for longer periods tends to accumulate in smaller areas than those incubated for shorter periods . The smaller areas representing compartment II could be explained by the accumulation in lysosomes following influx and sorting in compartment II . For additional color map images , refer to Appendix C . Figure 3 . 7 Color map of fluorescent marker intensity in FITC ( A ) and CY3 ( B ) in a PMA - treated cell . ( A ) and ( B ) show the different distribution of fluorescent markers in the same cell . The FITC image color map of the cell ( A ) shows an intensity range between 0 ( deep blue ) and 600 ( dark red ) , with 250 - 300 ( green ) representing the middle range of fluorescent intensities . ( A ) ( B ) 53 The CY3 image color map ( B ) shows an intensity range between 0 ( deep blue ) and 1600 ( dark red ) , with 750 - 800 ( green ) representing the middle range of fluorescent intensities Figure 3 . 8 Color map of fluorescent marker intensity in FITC ( A ) and CY3 ( B ) in a untreated cell showing distribution of two fluorescent markers . The FITC image color map of the cell ( A ) shows an intensity range between 0 ( deep blue ) and 500 ( dark red ) , with 250 - 300 ( green ) representing the middle range of fluorescent intensities . The CY3 image color map ( B ) shows an intensity range between 0 ( deep blue ) and 1400 ( dark red ) , with 600 - 800 ( green ) representing the middle range of fluorescent intensities . The ratio of CY3 as a fraction of the two markers ( FITC and CY3 ) was plotted as a histogram ( Figure 3 . 9 ) . This ratio represented showed the distribution of the amount of CY3 over FITC within the same cell in overlaid images . In the histogram , a value of 1 . 0 would be observed only where CY3 accounted for all of the fluorescence intensity . The control cells’ plot is shown in black while the PMA - treated cells’ plot is shown in grey . Values greater 0 . 5 on the horizontal axis represent areas in cells where the amount of CY3 is greater than FITC , and vice versa for values less than 0 . 5 . For values between 0 . 60 and 0 . 91 , the relative amounts of CY3 compared to FITC are greater ( C ) ( D ) 54 in the PMA - treated cells than in control cells . The area between 0 . 39 and 0 . 52 on the horizontal axis show the areas in PMA - treated cells ( grey ) where the intensity of the FITC marker is greater than CY3 . In these data , the pixel - by - pixel comparison reveals that there are many areas where CY3 is more intense than FITC in the PMA - treated cell populations . Whereas there are still many such areas in the control cells , the excess number in the treated cells is clearly indicated by the bins in the histogram where the gray display ( PMA - treated ) exceeds the black ( control ) . Thus , these results expand on those recorded earlier in Figures 3 . 3 and 3 . 5 . Figure 3 . 9 Ratio of CY3 as a fraction of the two fluorescent markers ( CY3 and FITC ) on a pixel - by - pixel basis in PMA - treated versus control cells . The control cells’ plot is shown in black while the PMA - treated cells’ plot is shown in grey . Values greater 0 . 5 on the horizontal axis represent areas in cells where the amount of CY3 is 55 greater FITC , and vice versa for values less than 0 . 5 . The area between 0 . 39 and 0 . 52 on the horizontal axis show the areas in PMA - treated cells ( grey ) where the amount is FITC is greater than CY3 . 3 . 4 SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE LOCALIZATION OF COMPARTMENT I AND II Metamorph software was used to make a ratio image and display the ratios of FITC and CY3 relative to one another on a pixel - by - pixel basis . Therefore , ratio data similar to that displayed in Figure 3 . 10 could be visualized in a color map image . Although the exact conditions for each display had to be matched to the range of intensities in the two channels , the ratio images of FITC over CY3 generally displayed the difference in distribution of the two fluorescent markers inside cells . These images reinforced the observation above ( Figure 3 . 9 ) , that the FITC distribution was eccentric in most cells . This could not be an artifact of image shifts during the image processing steps , because , when two cells were observed in the same image , the appearance of Compartment II was generally localized in different quarters of the cells . One qualitative difference was observed for PMA - treated cells ( A ) , compared to controls ( B ) , namely that some treated cells showed an increased concentration of FITC on the periphery of cells in a ring - like pattern ( Figure 3 . 10 ) . This pattern could reinforce our prediction of different traffic patterns in PMA treated cells over control cells , which could have consequences on polarity . However , as this pattern was observed in a total of 4 of 45 PMA - treated cells , it is difficult to make assertive conclusions to this effect . Nevertheless , none of the control cells showed this pattern in the ratio images . Both treated and untreated cell populations , however , could show a different directional orientation of compartment I and II within a single cell , as shown in Figure 3 . 10 . 56 Whereas FITC marker showed a typical striated or spotty pattern on one side of the cell or mixed with CY3 , CY3 shows a more uniform and concentrated localization on one side of the cell . For additional ratio images , refer to Appendix D . ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) ( D ) 57 Figure 3 . 10 Ratio ( FITC / CY3 ) images of ( A - D ) PMA - treated and ( E - H ) control cells . Each image shows color map of ratio intensity of cells obtained by overlaying FITC on CY3 intensities in the same cells . Green represents the mid ratio showing areas where FITC and CY3 intensities are the same . Colors above green in the scale ( yellow - red ) represent areas where FITC is greater than CY3 , and vice versa for the range below green ( deep green to dark blue ) . ( E ) ( F ) ( G ) ( H ) 58 3 . 5 COMPARISON OF FLUORESCENT MARKER ACCUMULATION IN 1000W CELLS ON HAPTOTACTIC GRADIENT One objective of my work was to test the Tojima hypothesis by measuring the amount of total fluorescent marker ( FITC ) accumulated on opposite halves of the cells on a haptotactic gradient . Cells accumulated FITC marker over an incubation period of 2 min and the intensity on the high side ( facing the attractive end of the gradient ) against the low side ( facing the repulsive end of the gradient ) for each cell was determined . From Tojima’s hypothesis , we expected the low side of the cell to do more endocytosis , and therefore accumulate a greater concentration of FITC than the high side over the short exposure period . There was no significant difference between the markers accumulated FITC on the low and high side of the cell . In Figure 3 . 12 , the high side is represented on the left side of each image . A comparison of the normalized integrated gray level with other measures , however , however , showed a consistent difference between the high side and low side . The same difference was reflected in the other measures of intensity , i . e . optical density ( OD ) and integrated OD . This suggested that the balance of endocytosis was slightly skewed in favor of the low side of the cell , although it was not significant . The raw data obtained in Metamorph used in for making histograms in Figure 3 . 11 is shown in appendix E . Sample of cell images used in this analysis is shown in Figure 3 . 12 . 59 Figure 3 . 11 Comparison of FITC integrated intensity and optical density ( OD ) of the right ( high side ) against left ( low ) side of 1000W cells . It was also observed in the 1000W cells that , the FITC marker contained in vesicles only accumulated along the edges ( rim ) of the cells after a short incubation period of 2 minutes ( Figure 3 . 12 ) . Additional images of this phenomenon can be found in appendix E . Figure 3 . 12 Image of two cells showing accumulation of FITC vesicles at the rim of 1000W after an incubation period of 2 minutes . 60 CHAPTER 4 . DISCUSSION Since the kinetics of marker trafficking are well known for the IAR20 rat liver cell line ( 119 , 120 ) , this enabled the selection of proper conditions for visualizing accumulation in Compartment II in relation to accumulation in Compartment I . The images , along with the analysis of the intensity levels , which are equivalent to marker concentration , allowed the characterization of the spatial compartments corresponding to previous models for pinocytic traffic . Particular attention was paid to the relationship of marker accumulation to signaling pathways activated after PMA treatment . PMA activates a regulatory molecule known as protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and is a chemical surrogate for diacylglycerol , the endogenous activator of PKC . After activation by either of these molecules , PKC adds a charged constituent to amino acid residues of a number of protein substrates . The PKC family of proteins comprises a number of serine / threonine kinases , some of which bind to phorbol esters to modulate signal transduction pathways and cellular functions . This family is composed of at least 12 different isoforms that play roles in cellular functions including cell cycle control , proliferation , differentiation , metastasis , and apoptosis ( 127 ) . The difficulty of dissecting the roles of the PKC family derives from the different combinations and roles of individual isoenzymes within cells and across tumor types , along with the complexity of regulatory mechanisms invoked in the cell . A number of studies have shown a strong connection between protein kinase and Rho GTPases in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal organization ( 128 - 130 ) , and indeed , PKC binds Rho directly ( 131 ) . Although the GTPase most closely linked with filopodia dynamics was Cdc42 , there is evidence of its binding affinity for only one isoform , PKC - alpha ( 131 ) . As mentioned in the Introduction ( section 1 . 3 . 4 ) , the complexity of effects downstream of PKCactivation has made it difficult to identify the physiological processes essential for tumor promotion . 61 PMA has been reported to cause an enhancement of membrane ruffling activity in many cell types within a few hours of exposure , its effect on ruffling in IAR20 cells has not been tested . The cell ruffling activity in 1000W cells , stimulated by PMA treatment , is accompanied by an increase in fluid traffic into cells by nonspecific pinocytosis as previously shown ( 122 ) . Despite the fact that ruffling is a rearrangement of actin - based cytoskeleton and is often abolished by the actin - depolymerizing cytochalasins , there is little evidence of Rho GTPase - mediated regulation of ruffling . Macropinocytosis , like phagocytosis , is an actin - dependent process regulated by one or more members of the Ras - related Rho GTPase family ( 132 , 133 ) . Rho GTPases comprise a number of signaling proteins that work together with various effector molecules to transmit signals within cells and mediate changes in the actin cytoskeleton at specific sites . In humans , about 22 Rho GTPases exist of which isoforms of Rho and Rac and Cdc42 have been best studied ( 134 ) . About 1 % of the genome consists of Rho - family GTPase or its regulatory proteins , guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) or GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , however . Upon activation Rho GTPases bind to a number of effectors , including protein kinases and some actin binding proteins ( 135 ) . The rate of macropinocytosis in mammalian cells can either be increased or decreased through a number of reactions under the control of the Rho family of GTPases . While immature dendritic cells actively carry out macropinocytosis and phagocytosis , mature cells cease endocytic activity , becoming more specialized for antigen presentation to T cells ( 136 ) . Studies have shown that endocytic downregulation in mature dendritic cells is controlled by Rho family of GTPases , especially Cdc42 ( 136 ) . A number of pathogens , including Salmonella typhimirium and Shigella flexnerri , drive their own internalization by activating Rho GTPases , by employing a type III secretion mechanism to inject specific GEFs into the cytoplasm of their intended host cell ( 133 , 137 ) . 62 Inactivation of Rho GTPases with Toxin B caused a dramatic decrease in macropinocytosis in immature dendritic cells ( 136 ) . Toxin B is a bacteria pathogenesis effector toxin produced by Clostridium difficile , which acts to inactivate many Rho GTPases by blocking their capacity for nucleotide exchange . Runyeon showed an increased rate of nonspecific pinocytosis of HRP in PMA - treated over the control rat liver cells ( 120 ) . The results of my work strongly support the increased pinoctyic rate shown by the increased accumulation of both FITC - GAM and CY3 - dextran in PMA - treated cells over the controls ( see Figures 3 . 3 and 3 . 9 ) . It also suggests that the model previously used to interpret the flow of traffic in cells is incomplete . Despite the fact that , in both cell populations in my experiment , FITC was accumulated without PMA treatment , there was an increased FITC accumulation in the treated cells over the controls . This suggests that FITC marker may continue to leave from the control cells but accumulate specifically in treated cells during the period of PMA exposure , which was 10 minutes . Since a 2 - minute rinse period was inserted between the loading of FITC marker and the efflux period , the result suggests differences in continuous traffic of remnant FITC molecules . This was unexpected and indicates that a reduction in rate and / or an enhancement of rate with PMA treatment . Further work must be done in order to test the possibility that marker concentration in localized organelles is responsible for the finding , rather than the gross amount of FITC marker retained . Typically , in experimental analysis , we look for the simplest explanation that can account for the observations . According to the previous model of Heckman , et al . , PMA , through PKC activation , could stimulate macropinocytosis through activation of certain Rho GTPases , and the effect may be confined to rate ã ( 119 ) . A graphical model for physiological trafficking is shown in the Introduction ( Section 1 . 4 ) . The rapid influx of substances begins with an increased rate of traffic to compartment I , followed by continuous traffic to compartment II . 63 Since there is more CY3 marker loaded in treated cells during the 10 - min interval allowed for partially filling compartment I , my results are consistent with this interpretation . It cannot be determined from my results , whether the treated and control cells differ in rates of efflux and trafficking between Compartment I and Compartment II . The results suggest the possibility of developing a method to measure the rates and . Data relevant to the volume of the functional compartment I in the presence and absence of PMA treatment were also subjected to preliminary evaluation by estimating the relative size of the CY3 - containing compartment . Even though the specific isoform of PKC or the Rho GTPase involved was not determined , it opens the door for future studies by applying this model . Evidence from the ratio images suggested a compartmentalization of the endocytic markers . Materials taken up by cells are first sorted in the compartment I which represents a larger area inside the cells . Following sorting , materials that are not recycled are sent into compartment II . The results ( Figures 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 ) show that compartment I occupies larger areas inside the cells than compartment II . Furthermore the distribution of fluorescent marker is general for compartment I , as the CY3 marker rarely shows a strong directional localization in the cell . In contrast , the marker for Compartment II is strongly localized within a crescent - shaped area of the cell . This localization shows that uptake is generally nondirectional , because marker distribution is not polarized . This supports , with spatial evidence , the functional compartmentalization model of endocytosis , which had already been developed by others based on physiological data . The displacement is a little weaker for PMA - treated cells , as mentioned above ( see Results ) . The ratio images suggest traffic in different directions of compartment I and II substances . In non - migratory mammalian cells that lack visible cell surface protrusions , it is difficult to develop a cue to their polarization . The ruffling activity of IAR20 cells was studied in earlier work ( 122 ) , and ruffles appeared in more than one quadrant on the perimeter of the cell . 64 Whereas ruffling was relatively delocalized , the above results show that lysosomes ( compartment II ) are stored at one side of the cell . Using the endocytic marker for the lysosome now provides valuable information on the position of the Compartment II organelles . Localization of the FITC marker corresponds to a known phenomenon inside the cells , in which the lysosomes surround the area of the microtubule - organizing center or centrosome ( 138 ) . Thus a cue was discovered that will be useful in assessing polarity , which is otherwise difficult to assess because , in epithelial cells , the leading and trailing edges do not show a visible difference in shape . In the experiment designed specifically to measure marker uptake relative to polarity , using the 1000W cell line , derived from rat tracheal epithelium , there was no significant difference in integrated intensity between the high and low side of cells on a gradient . There was however a higher optical density ( OD ) on the high side than the low side of the cells . The optical OD , which represents a measure of the opacity of the image , is a similar measure when applied to a bright object on a black background . Even though there was no significant difference in integrated intensity between the two cell halves , the consistent direction of the difference may still suggest differences which may have not been statistically significant . The results ( Figures 3 . 11 and 3 . 12 ) suggest that the balance between endocytosis and endocytosis proposed as a model for the neuronal development may be similar in association with polarity and migration in epithelial cells . Future research will be directed at determining the corresponding fluorescent marker concentration for the fluorescent intensity measurements for each marker . With the aid of these measurements and the model developed by Runyeon et al ( 119 ) , we aim to determine the volume changes that occur in compartment I during endocytic traffic . Also it would be prudent to target and deactivate specific Rho GTPases in subsequent experiments to determine whether endocytic traffic will be affected by PMA treatment . 65 REFERENCES ( 1 ) Mellman I .

Influx describes the uptake of materials into a cellular comparments while efflux describes emptying of the cell by exocytosis . Accumulation curves in red ( diamond markers ) and black ( square markers ) represent PMA - treated and control cells respectively . The time used for FITC accumulation in the current work , i . e . , 20 min and efflux for a period of 12 min , is marked with an arrow . The amount of HRP taken up by untreated cells was 0 . 694 ng / 100 , 000 cells , and the amount of HRP remaining in the cells was 0 . 278 ng . In theory , these amounts would be less than those determined from the intensity of FITC marker as endocytic marker rentention is enhanced with increased molecular weight . Since the marker is sorted in a fashion that depends on molecular weight , more of the FITC molecules are passed to compartment II and fewer are effluxed . The FITC marker is expected to be equally bright in the treated and untreated cells , however . Theoretical curves were calculated to represent the accumulation time course that would have been observed if initial uptake rates had continued for 120 min . These values are plotted in thin red lines ( PMA ) and thin black lines ( control ) . 76 77 APPENDIX B The table depicted below shows the cell sizes of both PMA - treated and control cells . Pixel count of the total area covered by cells was used as this provides a more sensitive index of cell measurement in pre - processed images for fluorescent analysis . Pixel count does not change with image processing proceeses , especially in cases where images have to be enlarged to complete the analysis .
