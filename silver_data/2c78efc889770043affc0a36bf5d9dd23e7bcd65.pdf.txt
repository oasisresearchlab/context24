REVI E W Open Access Imaging extracellular vesicles : current and emerging methods Steven Ting - Yu Chuo 1 † , Jasper Che - Yung Chien 1 † and Charles Pin - Kuang Lai 1 , 2 , 3 * Abstract Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are lipid bilayer - enclosed nanoparticles released by cells . They range from 30 nm to several micrometers in diameter , and ferry biological cargos such as proteins , lipids , RNAs and DNAs for local and distant intercellular communications . EVs have since been found to play a role in development , as well as in diseases including cancers . To elucidate the roles of EVs , researchers have established different methods to visualize and study their spatiotemporal properties . However , since EV are nanometer - sized , imaging them demands a full understanding of each labeling strategy to ensure accurate monitoring . This review covers current and emerging strategies for EV imaging for prospective studies . Keywords : Extracellular vesicles exosomes , Microvesicles , Imaging , Biodistribution , Fluorescence , Bioluminescence , MRI , SPECT , Dyes Background Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are heterogeneous nanoparticles released by cells . They were once considered as cellular wastes until studies revealed that EV serves as a means of cell - to - cell communication by shuttling DNAs , RNAs , pro - teins and lipids to neighboring and distant sites [ 1 , 2 ] . Since then , EVs have been actively investigated under ( patho ) - physiological settings , as well as for therapeutic develop - ment . To aid in these studies , many methods have been developed to label and characterize the spatiotemporal property of EVs . As each imaging strategy carries its advan - tages and disadvantages , this review aims to cover current and emerging methods , thereby facilitating choice for EV imaging in prospective studies . Extracellular vesicles Valadi et al . identified that EVs from human and mouse mast cell carry mRNAs and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) named “ exosomal shuttle RNAs ” , which could be deliv - ered into recipient cells via EV uptake for translation [ 3 ] . Soon thereafter , Al - Nedawi et al . found EVs derived from gliomas could deliver an oncogenic form of EGFR ( epider - mal growth factor receptor ) , EGFRvIII [ 4 ] , and further showed that EVs released by A431 , A549 and DLD1 cancer cell lines could transfer EGFR to induce angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) [ 5 ] . Moreover , Ratajczak et al . discovered that EVs from embry - onic stem cell ( ES ) could deliver mRNAs related to pluripo - tent transcription factors and Wnt - 3 protein to murine hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) to enhance survival and expansion [ 6 ] . Since EVs could transport bioactive car - gos between cells , EVs are recognized as important carriers to modulate phenotype and function of EV recipient cells [ 7 ] . While there are different EV subtypes based to their size , biogenesis and shape ( Fig . 1 ) , the collective term “ EVs ” is used in the current review unless otherwise specified . Exosomes are nanosized vesicles ( 30 – 100 nm ) generated by the release of intraluminal vesicles following the fusion of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) with the plasma mem - brane . Cells first generate early endosomes by endocytosis [ 8 – 10 ] . During their maturation to late endosomes , some endosomes shed intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) within itself to become MVBs , which then migrate to the cell membrane [ 11 ] . Once fused with the plasma membrane , the MVBs release the vesicles within to the extracellular milieu as exosomes [ 12 ] . Since exosomes are generated from the MVBs , exosomes contain biomarkers such as * Correspondence : laicharles @ sinica . edu . tw † Steven Ting - Yu Chuo and Jasper Che - Yung Chien contributed equally to this work . 1 Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences , Academia Sinica , No . 1 , Roosevelt Rd . , Sec . 4 , Taipei 10617 , Taiwan 2 Chemical Biology and Molecular Biophysics Program , Taiwan International Graduate Program , Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author ( s ) . 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons license , and indicate if changes were made .

Chuo et al . Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2018 ) 25 : 91 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12929 - 018 - 0494 - 5 Alix and tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( Tsg101 ) which relate to ILV formation in endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) [ 13 ] . Exosomes from dendritic cells , HeLa cells , human embryonic kidney cells 293 T ( HEK293T ) and retinal pigmented epithelial cells ( RPE - 1 ) were discovered to have tetraspanins like CD9 , CD81 and CD63 which relate to endosomal vesicle trafficking [ 14 , 15 ] . Therefore , these tetraspanins are also considered as common exosomal markers . Zhang et al . identified two kind of subpopulations of exosomes : large exosomes ( Exo - L , 90 – 120 nm ) and small exosomes ( Exo - S , 60 – 80 nm ) by asymmetric flow field - flow fraction ( AF4 ) [ 16 ] . Using transmission electron mi - croscopy ( TEM ) and mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis , Exo - S / L were confirmed as encapsulated particles [ 15 ] . While both Exo - S / L exhibited similar biomarkers as exo - somes including tetraspanins ( CD9 , CD63 , CD81 ) , Exo - S contained canonical exosomal proteins relating to ILVs , phagocytic vesicles , MVB and vacuoles like flotillin 1 , flotillin 2 , tweety family member 3 , tetraspanin 14 and ESCRT - I subunit VPS37B . By contrast , Exo - L carried non - canonical proteins associated with membrane budding , late - endosome and trans - Golgi network such as annexin A1 / A4 / A5 , charged multivesicular body protein 1A / 2A / 4B / 5 , vacuolar protein sorting 4 homologue B , heat shock protein family ( Hsp40 ) member A1 and my - osin IC . Furthermore , Zhang et al . identified a smaller , non - membranous nanoparticle named “ exomere ” ( < 50 nm ) , which lacks the lipid bilayer of other EV subtypes [ 15 ] . Exomeres are enriched with proteins involved in me - tabolism including glycolysis and mTORC1 metabolic pathway [ 15 ] , and its biological role remains to be eluci - dated in upcoming investigations . Microvesicles ( 100 – 1000 nm ) are shed from the surface of cells which are generally larger than exosomes . The outward budding is related to the interaction of TSG101 with arrestin domain - containing protein 1 ( ARRDC1 ) . After binding with ARRDC1 , TSG101 relocates from endosomes to the plasma membrane and facilitate MV release through Gag - mediated budding [ 17 , 18 ] . MVs share some of the biomarkers with exosomes like CD63 [ 19 ] , and both MVs and exosomes are known to trans - port bioactive cargos between cells [ 6 ] . Oncosomes or large oncosomes are large EVs released by cancer cells ( 1000 – 10 , 000 nm ) . They could be released like microvesicles by vesicle budding and membrane scission [ 20 , 21 ] Oncosomes are frequently found in highly aggres - sive cancer cells as non - apoptotic plasma membrane blebs during amoeboid mode of cancer invasion [ 22 ] . Wolf et al . discovered that amoeboid - like tumor cells continuously expand and retract oncosomes around cell surface when tumor cells go through 3D collagen matrix [ 22 ] . Clancy et al . found the release of oncosomes from amoeboid - like in - vasive tumor cell , which is facilitated by soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive - factor attachment protein re - ceptor ( SNARE ) protein and vesicle - associated membrane Fig . 1 Schematic of different EV subpopulations . Different EV subtypes have different sizes and secretion pathways . Exosomes are generated from MVBs , and can carry protein and mRNAs cargo for cell - cell communication . Based on their sizes , exosomes can further characterized to small exosomes and large exosomes . Exomeres are nanoparticles with size smaller than 50 nm and carrying proteins involving metabolism ; their biological role remains unknown . Microvesicles shed from the cell surface are generally larger than exosomes , and can also ferry cargos between cells . Oncosomes are larger EVs that were generated from cancer cells by budding or membrane scission , and can deliver cancer metastasis - related cargo to facilitate tumor cell invasion . Migrasomes are generated after cells migration with its function yet to be identified Chuo et al . Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2018 ) 25 : 91 Page 2 of 10 protein ( VAMP ) with cargo delivery of membrane - type 1 matrix metalloprotease ( MT1 - MMP ) [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . Since MT1 - MMP is a facilitator of tumor cell invasion and extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) proteolysis [ 25 , 26 ] , oncosomes are suggested to play an important role in tumor cell invasion . Migrasomes ( up to 3000 nm ) are oval shaped microvesi - cles containing small vesicles formed during cell migration . Liang et al . discovered that cells secrete migrasomes from tips of their retraction fibers , which the authors described as pomegranate - like structures ( PLS ) [ 27 ] . PLS were found to express tetraspanin - 4 ( TSPAN4 ) as a PLS marker [ 27 ] . With time - lapse fluorescence imaging of TSPAN4 - green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - expressing normal rat kidney ( NRK ) cells , the authors found migrasome release was migration - dependent [ 27 ] . Yet , migrasome function remains to be elucidated . Although EV subtypes have different routes of biogen - esis , biomarkers and sizes , their respective biological roles remain to be fully characterized . With the recent advances in EV labeling and imaging technologies , a more comprehensive understanding on the properties of EV subtypes may be made possible . EV imaging EV imaging plays an important role in revealing spatio - temporal property of EVs to further our understandings in the molecular biology , as well as therapeutic potential of EVs . In vitro EV imaging helps researchers to under - stand the physical property of EVs such as the mechan - ism of EV release [ 28 ] and uptake [ 1 , 29 ] , or biomarkers expressed on the EV surface [ 30 , 31 ] . In vivo EV imaging aids in unveiling the biodistribution of EVs , which can be used to characterize pharmacokinetic property of EVs as a drug and / or theranostics vehicle . However , imaging and tracking EVs can be challenging due to their small sizes , often requiring labeling prior to their subsequent visualization ( Fig . 2 ) . Many imaging tools and labeling methods have since been developed to assist researchers in monitoring EVs both in vitro and in vivo ( Fig . 3 ) . In this review , we will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used methods for EV visualization for basic and preclinical studies . EV imaging with Electron microscopy Electron microscopy has been considered as a standard im - aging method for observing nanosized samples , including EVs [ 32 – 34 ] . Since electron microscopy typically has a resolution around 0 . 5 nm which is smaller than exosomes , it may provide detailed structural information of EVs . It is important to note that electron microscopy cannot image EVs in their native state because the samples need to be fixed and processed prior to imaging . Here we will discuss the common electron microscopy methods used for EV imaging : Transmission Electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) is the most common type of electron microscopies for EV imaging , such as exosomes [ 35 ] , microvesicles [ 36 ] , oncosomes [ 37 ] and migrasomes [ 27 ] . The samples prepared for Fig . 2 Different microscopic resolution limits and sizes of EV subpopulations . Each imaging method has its resolution limit . Different strategy can be applied for EV imaging based on EV subtypes and target ( s ) of interest ( e . g . cells , tissues , organs ) Chuo et al . Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2018 ) 25 : 91 Page 3 of 10 TEM imaging are first fixed and later dehydrated . Fol - lowing dehydration , the samples need to be embedded , sliced into nanometered thin sections , and mounted on a carbon coating grid for imaging . TEM uses electron beams to illuminate through prepared specimens , and the electron can either transmit or be diffracted by the specimens . A fluorescent screen or charge - couple device ( CCD ) will collect the transmitted electron for bright - field images , which is normally used for structure verifi - cation . Meanwhile , scattered electrons are collected to generate dark - field images , revealing the structure with a higher contrast . Notably , EVs observed by TEM often appear as cup shaped as a result of dehydration during sample preparation [ 38 ] but can effectively reveal inner structure of EVs . Using immunogold - labeling , TEM can further reveal EV proteins . Dickens et al . used correlative light - electron microscopy ( CLEM ) to visualize EVs released from GFP - expressing astrocytes , thereby demonstrating that the labeled EVs can be taken up by brain microvascular endothelial cells , the lung , liver and spleen , and subse - quently induce leukocytes migration to brain lesion tis - sues [ 39 ] . The immunogold - labeled method can also be used to quantitate cancer - associated marker from plasma EVs [ 40 ] , as well as to study disease mechanism involving EVs . For instance , Szempruch et al . recently found EVs secreted from a parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , causes host erythrocyte remodeling and subsequent anemia [ 41 ] . Scanning Electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) uses electron beam to scan the surface of specimen to generate topography information . For SEM , samples are first chemically or cryo - genically fixed followed by dehydration . The immobilized samples are then sputter - coated with a thin layer of con - ductive material such as gold or carbon for imaging . While some reports suggest EVs under SEM as round shaped [ 42 – 44 ] , others report them as saucer shaped [ 45 ] . The latter observation may reflect EV collapse as a result of the dehydration process during sample preparation [ 45 ] . Although SEM sample preparation is relatively simple when compared to that of TEM , which requires samples to be embedded and sectioned , several caveats need to considered . During sample preparation for SEM , a thin conductive layer around 2 to 10 nm is sputtered on the surface of sample to avoid accumulation of electron and to increase secondary electron generation . This thin layer of gold does not usually affect the imaging result . However , due to the small size of EVs , the thin layer of gold may affect the surface structure of EVs . A low - voltage SEM can avoid accumulation of charge and reduce radiation damage to the samples , thus bypassing the sputter coating process [ 44 ] . Chernyshev et al . also reported that “ coffee ring effect ” may occur as a result of the capillary flow during sample dehydration , thus creat - ing bias in the result of EV size and amount [ 46 ] . To prevent such bias , the entire surface of specimen must be imaged and investigated [ 46 ] . Fig . 3 Strategies for EV labeling and imaging . Labeling EV with fluorescent dye or fluorescent protein can be imaged by fluorescent microscopy . EVs expressing bioluminescence proteins can be imaged by ultra - sensitive CCD . EVs incorporated with USPIO can be used for MRI imaging . EVs label with isotopes can be used for nuclear imaging . CFDA - SE : carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ; calcein AM : calcein acetoxymethyl ; USPIO : ultra - small super paramagnetic iron oxide ; 99mTc - HMPAO : 99mTc - hexamethylpropylene - amineoxime ; CCD : charge - coupled device Chuo et al . Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2018 ) 25 : 91 Page 4 of 10 Cryo - electron microscopy In cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) , samples will be fixed by cryo - immobilization where waters are vitrified instead of ice crystal formation in the sample by liquid ethane cooling . Cryo - immobilizing allows samples to be preserved in their native hydrated state , thus avoiding arti - facts commonly caused by conventional fixation method such as cup shaped EVs [ 46 , 47 ] . Combined with immuno - gold labeling , cryo - TEM can image EVs containing proteins and track EV uptake by recipient cells [ 48 ] , as well as distinguishing EV subgroups by their size [ 49 , 50 ] . Under cryo - EM , the specimens are imaged under extremely low temperature ( below − 175 °C ) as EVs are maintained in its original spherical shape [ 51 ] . Therefore the average size of EVs will appear to be bigger when compared to other EM methods [ 46 ] . After cryo - immobilization , samples can also undergo freezing substitution with fixing and embedding reagents for the specimens to be imaged under traditional TEM in room temperature . Since cryo - EM yields superior sample quality and morphology preservation over trad - itional EM methods [ 47 ] , it is increasingly being applied to study EVs . EV imaging with atomic force microscopy Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) uses a probe often made by silicon or silicon nitride to scan through the surface of specimens . When the probe contacts with the surface of specimens , the probe position changes and is measured by a laser beam . By recording the probe position during the scan , AFM generates topographic images of the samples . AFM has a resolution limit around 1 nm [ 52 ] , which allows quantification and imaging of most EVs [ 53 , 54 ] . In air - mode , the sample preparation for EVs imaging only re - quires EVs immobilized on freshly cleaved mica for subse - quent scanning with a probe . In liquid - mode , EV samples can be measured directly and will result in detection of lar - ger sized EVs than that of the air - mode because EVs remain hydrated and maintain their morphology [ 55 ] . The mica can also be coated with antibodies so that EVs with specific antigen can be captured for imaging [ 54 ] . The imaging mode can be classified into contact and tapping mode . In contact mode , a probe scans across the surface of a sample , thus can damage both the probe and the sample . Whereas in tapping mode , probe oscillates across the sample surface and only touches the sample at the lowest position of oscil - lation . The oscillation reduces the contact time between the sample and the probe , thereby protecting the sample struc - ture . When combining silicon probes with antibodies , AFM can further be used to quantify and image EVs with specific protein on its surface at single EV resolution [ 56 ] . Tracking EV by optical microscopy Bioluminescence imaging ( BLI ) and fluorescence im - aging ( FLI ) are two major methods used in detecting EVs within the visible light spectrum ( 390 – 700 nm ) . Bio - luminescence is a type of chemiluminescence produced from the oxidation of substrates by their respective lucifer - ases . The bioluminescent signal requires ultra - sensitive CCD camera for detection [ 57 ] . An advantage of BLI lies in its high signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) since the signals are generated without any light source . FLI uses fluorescent proteins or organic dyes to emit signals under excitation with an external light source . When compared to BLI , FLI signal could be more easily detected by a CCD camera . Both BLI and FLI can be applied for real - time observation of EVs [ 58 , 59 ] . Bioluminescence EV labeling BLI labeling of EVs are protein - based labeling . The EV - reporter luciferases are typically expressed in cells through plasmid transfection or lentivirus transduction , and their EVs can then be imaged via BLI . Takahashi et al . demonstrated that Gaussia luciferase ( Gluc ) fused between a secretion signal peptide and C1C2 domain of lactadherin could be labeled onto EV membrane [ 59 ] . B16 - BL6 murine melanoma cells were transfected with Gluc - lactadherin plasmid for 24 h and EVs were collected by differential ultracentrifuge ( UC ) . After intravenous ( IV ) bolus injection of the labeled EVs , the signal showed that the EVs were quickly distributed to different organs within five hours [ 59 ] . We combined Gluc , biotin acceptor protein and the transmembrane domain of platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) to create a multimodal EV imaging re - porter ( GlucB ) [ 60 ] . Human embryonic kidney 293 T cells were stably transduced with a lentiviral vector containing GlucB for subsequent EV collection by differential UC . A bolus IV - administration of the labeled EVs into athymic nude mice followed by in vivo imaging system ( IVIS ) and fluorescence - mediated tomography demonstrated that EVs are mostly processed by the liver and lung over a period of six hours in two phases : a distribution phase where the EVs are quickly distributed to the different organs , and followed by an elimination phase where the EVs are processed by the organs [ 60 ] . Gangadaran et al . used Renilla luciferase ( Rluc ) as a BLI reporter for EV imaging . Lentivirus encoding Rluc was transduced into human anaplastic thyroid cancer ( CAL - 62 cells ) and human breast cancer ( MDA - MB - 231 ) cells for EV isolation [ 61 ] . The labeled EVs showed biodistribution of EV - CAL - 62 / Rluc at the lung followed by the liver , spleen and kidney . On the other hand , EV - MDA - 231 / Rluc showed a strong signal at the liver followed by the lung , spleen and kidney [ 61 ] . Gluc and Rluc hence can serve as powerful reporters for in vivo EV biodistribution and imaging analyses . However , the toxicity of the substrates ( e . g . coelentera - zine ) and half - life of bioluminescence should also be Chuo et al . Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2018 ) 25 : 91 Page 5 of 10 taken into consideration for BLI - based , real - time EV tracking [ 62 – 64 ] . Fluorescence EV labeling Fluorescent protein - and organic dye - based labeling are used to enable FLI EV imaging with excellent spatial resolution under optical microscopy and IVIS . Recombinant protein labeling Fluorescent proteins like GFP and RFP are fused with EV proteins as reporters for EV imaging . Mittelbrunn et al . first fused CD63 with GFP to analyze cellular uptake of EVs [ 31 ] . They generated stable CD63 - GFP - expressing Raji B cell and J77 T cells to collect fluorescently labeled EVs . After 16 h EV treatment with CD63 - GFP EVs to wildtype J77 T cells or Raji B cells , fluorescent signal was detected on recipient cell surface , indicating that EVs were attaching onto the cell membrane [ 31 ] . Suetsugu et al . used a similar strategy and showed that breast cancer cells secrete EVs to lung and induced cancer cell migration [ 65 ] . Another study used RFP tagged CD63 to image EV transfer between triple - negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) and macrophages RAW264 . 7 [ 66 ] . The communication between TNBC and macrophage through EVs causes M2 - macrophage polarization and enhances tumor growth and axillary lymph node metastasis in orthotopic tumor models [ 66 ] . Yet , labeling EVs with specific EV proteins may limit the tracking to only a few subtypes of EVs expressing the respective markers . To create a general labeling strategy of EVs with fluores - cent proteins , we fused a palmitoylation signal to enhanced green fluorescence protein ( PalmGFP ) and tandem dimer Tomato ( PalmtdTomato ) to label the inner membrane leaf - let of cells and EVs [ 67 ] . By using live - cell confocal micros - copy , glioblastoma cells ( GBM ) and 293 T cells expressing the reporters showed multi - directional EV exchange [ 67 ] . Moreover , the reporters enabled in vivo observation of en - dogenously released EVs of implanted EL4 thymoma in C57BL / 6 mice by multiphoton intravital microscopy ( MP - IVM ) [ 58 ] . Although fluorescent protein labeling methods could serve as versatile EV reporters , the fluorescence intensity depends on protein expression level , the efficiency of EV membrane domain labeling , and the strength of excita - tion light source . The expression of fluorescent proteins on EV membrane may also affect EV cargo content and uptake due to sterical hindrance , which require further investigations and consideration prior to their use . Organic fluorescent dyes There are many organic fluorescent dyes used for EV labeling . Most of the dyes were initially used to label cell membrane for imaging of cells . The organic dyes generally combine fluorophores with different functional groups to label the lipid bilayer or proteins of interest on EVs . DiR and DiD are lipophilic dyes and exhibit a strong fluorescent signal when incorporated into the cytosol [ 68 ] . Wiklander et al . used DiR to study EVs by labeling condi - tioned media from different cell types followed by differ - ential UC , and reported different EV biodistribution pattern based on cell and routes of administration in mice via IVIS [ 69 ] . Grange et al . also demonstrated that distri - butions of mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) - derived EVs were detectable through DiD labeling 24 h post - injection in mice [ 70 ] . PKH67 and PKH26 are also fluorophores with lipophilic carbocyanine . These dyes use aliphatic tails to anchor into lipid bilayer for fluorescence imaging [ 71 , 72 ] . The lipophilic PKH dyes have also been used to label EVs to study in vivo properties [ 73 , 74 ] . Octadecyl rhodamine B chloride ( R18 ) is a lipid labeling dye that incorporates into lipid bilayer with its alkyl tails [ 75 ] . When first incorporated into the plasma membrane in quenched form , the intensity of R18 fluorescence signal increases as the labeled membrane fuses with unlabeled membrane to dequench R18 [ 76 ] . The percentage of dequenching can hence report EV fusion with cells [ 76 ] . Tian et al . used R18 to study fusogenic properties of EVs in PC12 cells and found fusion events in 24 h following EV treatment . Montecalvo et al . also used the same dye to detect bone marrow dendritic cell ( BMDC ) derived EVs fusing with BMDC within eight minutes following treatment [ 76 ] . Other water - soluble fluorophore combined with different functional groups are also applied to label EVs . Alexa Fluor NHS , a fluorescent dye bound with N - hydroxy succinimidyl ( NHS ) ester , can form covalent bond with amine groups in proteins [ 77 ] . Proteins present on EV lipid membrane can be labeled by Alexa Fluor NHS ester and detected by fluor - escence imaging [ 78 ] . Kooijmans et al . used Alexa Fluor 488 to detect uptake of red blood cell - derived EVs by hu - man epidermoid carcinoma cells , and found EVs decorated with EGFR sensitive nanobodies ( EGa1 - C1C2 ) could increase its uptake by flow cytometry analysis [ 79 ] . We showed that biotin acceptor protein in GlucB reporter can be further tagged with streptavidin - conjugated Alexa680 to enable fluorescence - mediated tomography ( FMT ) in mice to study biodistribution of 293 T - derived EVs [ 60 ] . Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( CFDA - SE ; Ex / Em 492 / 517 ) is cell permeable and binds to intracel - lular amine group as it is retained in cells following removal of the acetate groups by intracellular esterases [ 80 ] . Escre - vente et al . used CFDA - SE to observe energy - dependent endocytosis of EV uptake by SKOV3 cell ( ovarian cancer cells ) via flow cytometry [ 81 ] . CellTracker deep red ( CTDR ) has a similar function as CFDA - SE but with red light exci - tation ( max . 630 nm ) and far - red emission ( max . 650 nm ) . When studying the cell uptake mechanism , CTDR labeled Chuo et al . Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2018 ) 25 : 91 Page 6 of 10 239 T - derived EVs can be detected in green fluorescent dye labeled cells by fluorescence microscopic and flow cytome - try analyses [ 82 ] . Calcein acetoxymethyl ( AM ) consists of fluorescent calcein combined with acetoxymethyl group . Calcein AM first penetrates into EVs with AM and is digested by cytosolic esterase to leave calcein as water - soluble fluorophore for FLI . Mantel et al . found calcein - AM could release calcein into RBC - derived EVs for observation using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytom - etry [ 83 ] . Fluorescent dyes can provide stable and strong signal for EV imaging . However , popular EV labeling dyes like PKH dyes has been reported to have an in vivo half - life ranging from 5 to > 100 days [ 84 – 86 ] , and dialkylcarbo - cyanine dyes such as DiR could last for 4 weeks [ 87 ] . The persistence of the dyes may mislead the in vivo distribu - tion in longitudinal studies of EVs where the dyes outlast EVs from degradation . Moreover , aggregation and micelle formation of lipophilic dyes may yield false signal of EVs [ 67 ] . Nevertheless , the dyes may be useful serving as a tracer to show where the EVs have traversed . Clinical imaging tools for EVs imaging As researchers increasingly focus on EVs as an endogen - ous therapeutic delivery vehicle for clinical applications , one must be able to track and understand the pharmaco - kinetics of EVs . Two widely used clinical imaging tools are single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) and positron emission tomography ( PET ) . SPECT creates images by measuring gamma rays generated from gamma - emitting radioisotopes . By contrast , PET detects gamma ray pairs in an opposite direction when indirectly generated by positron - emitting radionuclide as it under - goes annihilation event with electrons in tissues . A major advantage of radioactive probes lies in its superior tissue penetration depth over visible light reporters . Hwang et al . used lipophilic 99m Tc - hexamethylpropylene - amineoxime ( 99m Tc - HMPAO ) to label EVs where the contrast agent was first trapped inside the macrophages as glutathione converts 99m Tc - HMPAO to hydrophilic form , subsequently generating 99m Tc - HMPAO exosome - mimetic nanovesicles through extrusion [ 88 ] . The 99m Tc - HMPAO - - labeled nanovesicles showed a similar morphology and bio - distribution pattern in mice as that of natural EVs , which are similarly labeled and collected by differential UC [ 88 ] . Similar method using 99m Tc - tricarbonyl complex , which binds to histidine [ 89 ] , cysteine and methionine on surface proteins of EVs , enabled SPECT / CT imaging of erythrocy - te - derived exosomes [ 90 ] . Another radiolabeling method involves the use of indium - 111 - oxine , which incorporates into exosome membrane with the lipophilic property of oxine [ 91 ] . Morishita et al . also developed an outer - membrane - labeling method using a fusion protein of streptavidin and lactadherin , a protein known to locate to the outer surface of exosomes . The labeled EVs are then treated with ( 3 - 125 I - iodobenzoyl ) norbiotinamide ( 125 I - IBB ) to label EVs via the biotin - streptavidin interaction [ 92 ] . Other common radioactive iodine , such as 124 I , which is a common probe of PET [ 93 ] , or 131 I , which can kill and image cancer cells simultaneously [ 94 ] , may also be used to radiolabel EVs in the future . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is another major molecular imaging technology used for clinical diagnosis . MRI contrast agent such as superparamagnetic iron oxide , which can reduce T2 signal in tissue , are com - monly applied to improve signal - to - noise and lesion de - tectability [ 95 ] . In fact , Hood et al . used electroporation to load 5 nm superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle into EVs , and demonstrated that the labeling did not affect their size and biodistribution in lymph nodes when compared to that of Dil labeled EVs in mice [ 96 , 97 ] . Of note , since the electroporation method was also being used for cell or liposome fusion [ 98 , 99 ] , it may also cause EV fusion and affect their morphology . To avoid this caveat , an alternative EV labeling method employs cellular endocytosis of contrast agent . Hu et al . used ultra - small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanopar - ticles ( USPIO , 4 – 6 nm ) to label adipose stem cell through pinocytosis [ 100 ] . The internalized USPIO were then accumulated in MVB and released as USPIO - la - beled EVs [ 101 ] . This method thus avoids EV fusion caused by electroporation , and tracks EVs release from implanted USPIO - labeled cells . Although using SPECT , PET , MRI imaging system may provide good imaging depth , it is important to note that these labeling compounds have longer half - life than EVs and thus may generate signal even after EVs are degraded [ 88 , 96 ] . Conclusions EVs imaging plays a pivotal role in studying biological phenomena such as cancers [ 102 ] and neuronal diseases [ 103 ] . As researchers utilize various reporters to monitor EVs , it is paramount to consider each reporter ’ s property in relation to that of EVs . It is also important to mitigate false positive EV signal from EV labeling , as well as to characterize true spatiotemporal property of EV but not the imaging agents .
