In this paper , we present five design interventions with the aim to rethink current strategies for remote communication by using and repurposing ana - logue , non - digital and bodily means . In an autoethnographic study , we implement and explore those interventions with our family members and friends . We present and discuss the collected insights and individual experiences from the interventions in depth to ar - ticulate reflections on communication over a distance that intend to inspire playful , material - driven , bodily ways of remote connect - edness . Finally , we emphasize the value of reducing complexity to strengthen ( remote ) connectedness , creating bodily connections over physical distance that reduce pressure on users , and allowing participants to challenge the boundaries of not using digital means .

These conventional ways can enable remote conversations , but they lack , among others , options to ex - change physical touch and connect bodily [ 8 ] . Even though people sometimes creatively incorporate physical objects into their remote communication , such as in in video calls [ 27 ] , a deliberate integra - tion of everyday objects is not yet part of publicly available digital communication means .

Besides ex - perimenting with interactive prototypes and design concepts , we have also continuously reflected on our design explorations and are in an ongoing conversation with the target group . Thereby , a recurring topic is the desired extent of technological mediation , for instance , when our study participants emphasize that they ‘do not need much to stay in touch’ and that they often prefer very simple , yet , meaningful ways of communication and interactions to maintain relationships over a distance , instead of complex interac - tive systems to make sense of and appropriate . This resonates with literature on remote communication , which highlights , for example , how older adults value material social communications that afford expression of thoughtfulness and concern [ 37 ] , that even minimal communication can result in intimacy [ 46 ] , or that technology is not wanted every time and everywhere [ 27 ] . In order to explore the boundaries of digital means of communication , and thereby prevent walking into a ‘solutionist trap’ , we defined the following research questions : How do we experience remote communication that is limited in interactivity , materials , extent , or scope ? What bodily and material qualities are meaningful in remote communication ? In this research , we set out to challenge our own research path by focusing on existing strategies and means for communication , on established methods that people already use . Our aim was not to design new technologies or products as a solution to remoteness , rather we wanted to experiment with ways of staying in touch that take a step back from advanced complex prototypes or interactions , but build on familiar routines . Therefore , we present in this paper an exploration of how to enrich , reinvent , and disrupt remote com - munication between families and friends by deliberately involving the body and ( physical ) materials . We focus on the body to address the lack of physical closeness in remote relationships [ 8 ] ; and on ( physical ) materials , as they are currently rarely integrated within well - established communication means in a meaningful way [ 27 ] . To do that , we created five design interventions , which is a provocative approach to intervening in the “world as it is” [ 69 p . 13 ] . They build upon existing remote communication strategies , which we leveraged in unconventional and innovative ways . For implementation , we utilized autoethnographic approaches [ 23 ] by conducting the interventions during our own remote conversations with family members and friends . Some of them were living in another city or country , some in the same city , yet , due to Covid - 19 - related restrictions being in place when the study was conducted , we were unable to meet in person . Our autoethnographic reflections were captured in written narratives during and after each inter - vention . Additionally , the experiences of the participating family 1 https : / / hci . sbg . ac . at / sites / retangent / NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Janne Mascha Beuthel et al . members and friends were collected through reflective questions posed after the interventions had ended . In the following , we outline the design space of remote commu - nication and related work on enabling physical and bodily connect - edness over distance . We will then describe our methodological approach , followed by descriptions of the interventions . For each intervention , we detail the concept and rationales driving the de - sign , along with reflections from family members and friends who participated as well as descriptions of our own experiences . Finally , we discuss insights from the intervention in relation to related work to articulate reflections that we understand as inspirational starting points and prompts for design researchers and practitioners that aim to explore playful , material - driven , embodied ways of tangible communication across physical distances . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Remote Communication Communication across physical distance between family members and friends , and the associated maintenance of emotional relation - ships , can be challenging . There are various attempts in HCI that aim to improve remote communication and connectedness , e . g . , through shared family calendars [ 26 ] , a domestic media space in the form of an always - on video [ 42 ] , a physical proxy for video communication [ 78 ] , play and ( digital ) games [ 16 , 19 , 47 , 56 , 62 ] , through storytelling [ 66 ] , enabling rituals to be shared over distance [ 4 , 14 , 48 , 85 ] , the exchange of photos [ 20 , 67 ] , or of daily stories through physical artifacts and photos [ 84 ] . Moreover , Hutchinsons and colleagues explored “technology probes” , e . g . , in the form of a “Message Probe” , an application that enables communication through digital , synchronous Post - it notes [ 41 p . 19 ] . Lottridge et al . [ 51 ] created the technology probe “MissU” , which enables the exchange of music playlist and ambient sound , and can provide comfort in the “empty moments” , meaning mundane situations of the daily life of long - distance couples . Connecting people at a geographical distance has been explored through connected artefacts , such as furniture [ 64 ] , cups for drink - ing together over distance [ 18 ] , and the “Mole Messenger” [ 72 ] : two connected creatures that connect remote families . The “Messaging Kettle” [ 2 , 12 ] intends to foster remote communication “during the routine of boiling a kettle” [ 12 p . 1 ] . Two connected Messaging Ket - tles can sense temperature , such as when one user is boiling water , and send messages between them [ 2 ] . In a long - term study of using the Messaging Kettle , Ambe et al . identified the phenomenon of “ collaborative habituation ” , meaning “each party creatively made the technology work for them both through a combination of the grad - ual transformation of their everyday practices , arrangements , and living . ” [ 2 p . 3 : 1 ] . These practices led to the experience of “ everyday togetherness ” that enriches the feeling of connectedness over dis - tance . Tollmar et al . explored possibilities for establishing “intimacy at a distance” [ 80 , 81 ] , e . g . , through connected , interactive light sculptures that respond to the “amount of body movement close to the lamp [ s ] ” [ 81 p . 44 ] . Further , Strong and Gaver [ 76 ] created three experiments for designing minimal , yet , intimate means of remote communication . One is “Feather” , a system consisting of a picture frame that is connected to a furniture item , which includes an electric fan and a feather . “When triggered by the absent partner holding the picture frame , the fan starts , wafting the feather into the air . ” ( ibid . , p . 2 ) . Intimate connections have also been explored through “Lovers’ box , a digital artefact designed to engage romantic couples in re - flections on their relationship” [ 79 p . 283 ] and as “intimate objects : technology devices for maintaining intimacy at a distance” [ 45 p . 341 ] that intend to connect long - distance partners through a single bit [ 43 , 71 ] . Relatedly , emojis have been investigated as a minimal form of communication to express emotions and enhance feelings of connectedness over distance [ 88 ] . Despite all these efforts , there are still challenges in remote communication , such as in the maintenance of intergenerational relationships due to differing needs in - between age groups ( e . g . , [ 56 ] ) and lacking strategies for better inclusion of physical objects and tangibles during remote communication ( e . g . , [ 27 ] ) . Building upon findings that , for instance , letters can be preferred over any digital way to stay in touch ( e . g . , [ 37 ] ) , we found it worthwhile to experiment with established media of remote communication , such as video calls , letter writing , or digital messaging , through extending and reinventing them in creative , bodily , and tangible ways - in the form of design interventions . 2 . 2 Bodies at a Distance When living far away from family or friends , it is almost impossible to create physical closeness , which is manifested through a lack of touch , physical affection or bodily involvement in remote commu - nication , e . g . , [ 8 , 61 ] . This issue has been addressed , for example , by proposals for technology that enables hugs [ 57 , 82 ] , hand holding [ 30 , 60 , 73 ] and kissing [ 13 , 34 , 68 ] over distance . Enabling remote , bodily closeness was explored by transmitting biofeedback of a distant other , such as the pulse [ 50 ] . Werner et al . [ 87 ] introduced “United - pulse” , two connected rings that can measure the heartbeat of the person wearing them and send it to the distant other’s ring . Slovák et al . [ 74 ] conducted a study to understand the impact of heart rate as a form of communication . They found , for example , that seeing the heart rate of a partner was experienced as a “ direct connection ” , when the person is at a larger physical distance or throughout a regular working day [ 74 p . 864 ] . Heiss explored “digitally enhanced apparel” that aims to create a link between physically distant people through the “real time transference of heartbeats” [ 33 p . 15 ] . To create the experience of bodily connectedness and presence while being at a distance , Park and colleagues [ 63 ] created “Cheek - Touch” , which enables the exchange of tactile feedback on the cheek with multi - finger input for affective touch , while speaking on the phone . Scherini et al . [ 70 ] developed “Somnia” , which con - sists of two connected pillows and necklaces and allows remote partners to “go to bed together” . Through temperature feedback , the pillows simulate the bodily closeness that couples would expe - rience when sleeping co - located . Further , “inTouch” aims “to create a physical link for expressing the movements or gestures of that person” [ 9 p . 363 ] without being an exact physical replication of the distant other . The remote users interact with a shared physical object through touch , which are then transmitted over distance and represent the remote bodily movement and gestures . “The Com - Slipper” [ 15 ] are two connected pairs of slippers that warm up Exploring Remote Communication through Design Interventions : Material and Bodily Considerations NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark when the distant other person is wearing them , and by doing that , transmitting a sensation of bodily presence . Li and colleagues [ 49 ] conducted a participatory design workshop with participants in long - distance relationships to explore wearables as a medium for connecting bodily when being far apart . Findings point , for exam - ple , to the value of supporting a secret form of communication and embedding “effortless interactions” into “everyday garments or ac - cessories” ( ibid . , p . 2093 ) . Beuthel et al . [ 8 ] designed “BREATH and WARMTH” , two pairs of wearables that simulate the experience of bodily distance and absence of touch in remote relationships through fading temperature and vanishing movement in textiles . Experiencing bodily closeness can be linked to shared activi - ties and moving together . This has been addressed , e . g . , through enabling remote , “shared bicycling” [ 17 , 58 ] . And through “Beam - Geocaching” [ 58 ] , “a telepresence robot” that provides “a physical form or ‘embodiment’ for a remote family member that can aid the shared experience of walking , site seeing , and searching for ‘hidden treasures”’ ( ibid . , p . 157 ) . Sharing whole - body movement over distance was the conceptual starting point for “Undula” [ 11 ] : two connected rocking chairs allow “connectedness [ to ] arise from a jointly attentive dynamic body movement coordination” ( p . 655 ) while sitting in the chairs and moving at a self - paced rhythm . In our design interventions , we engage ( with ) the body through different means , e . g . , through sharing movements over distance , similarly to [ 58 ] , to create a feeling a bodily connectedness . Instead of creating a link between bodies through digital means , such as transferring a heartbeat [ 33 , 50 , 74 , 87 ] , we experiment with the value of a material reminder of the distant other that functions as a constant prompt by being worn on the body in daily life . Through the interventions , we aim to explore the experience of remote bodily connectedness enabled through diverse design interventions and ( physical ) materials 3 METHODOLOGY 3 . 1 Designing Interventions Sanders and Stappers describe design interventions as intending “to provoke or stir people” , conducted in the “world as it is” [ 69 p . 13 ] . They have been used , e . g . , in dementia care in the form of an interactive sound cushion [ 38 ] , for promoting physical activities of adolescents [ 54 ] , and for self - control on Facebook [ 53 p . 543 ] . Genc [ 28 ] designed interventions for supporting more sustainable recipe planning for chefs and Viña [ 83 ] created ANIMATO , a design intervention for people engaging in public spaces . Our aim was to explore extensions , additions and reconsidera - tions of ( means of ) remote communication that allow for innovative relationship building . Therefore , we designed five interventions that use communication media in unconventional ways . Each in - tervention included various physical and non - physical materials , a defined duration time , a description of the activity . To conduct the interventions , we turned towards an autoethnographic approach . The design process of the interventions was exploratory . Among us three researchers , we first aimed to get an overview of the com - munication practices that we already experience with ( remote liv - ing ) family and friends . Additionally , we extended our own experi - ences through the knowledge we had acquired through reviewing related work . Based on that , we reconsidered existing practices to inform interventions that play with existing practices and devices ( e . g . , by reducing to one of their characteristics , translating them for remote situations , etc . ) , as shown in table 1 . All interventions are described in full detail in chapter 4 , including examples of related work and our own experiences . We recruited participants within our families and friends . If it were only us researchers participating or we would have partici - pated with strangers , we would not be able to fully experience how the interventions play out in emotional relationships , which led us to implementing an autoethnographic approach . The situations that we explored the interventions within varied : on one hand , we engaged family members that were in a physical distance , on the other hand , due to Covid - 19 restrictions that were in place during the study , we engaged family members that were not physically distant , yet , out of reach for in person meetings . For example , in the intervention Get Creative the granddaughter was able to craft with her grandparents , who live nearby but whom she was unable to meet in person . In the descriptions of the interven - tions below , we will give more details on our personal relationships and usual communication with participants . The materials that were necessary to conduct the interventions , such as instructions , envelopes , stickers , were carefully chosen and designed in a cohesive color scheme ( shades of red ) and in an under - standable way . All participants , ourselves and our family members or friends , received identical materials and instructions when start - ing the interventions . This established a sense of connectedness over distance even before the intervention started . The instructions encouraged a creative and personalized use of materials , matching the own daily life , personal relation to the participating author and creative ideas . 3 . 2 Autoethnography Autoethnography is “an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze personal experience“ [ 23 p . 273 ] . Through autoethnography , we intended to “use personal experience to illustrate facets of cultural experience , and , in so doing , make characteristics of a culture familiar for insiders and outsiders . ” ( ibid . , p . 276 ) . It allowed us to explore the interventions ourselves and with our own families and friends . In HCI , autoethnographic approaches have been utilized , e . g . , in the form of reflective diaries written during the engagement with participants [ 55 , 75 ] ; autoethnographic observations [ 89 ] ; narra - tives written to reflect on the emotional labor of researchers [ 25 ] or participants [ 39 ] ; to capture experiences of living without a mobile phone [ 52 ] ; in the form of autoethnographic bodystorming used to create “Nautica” , a soft robotic prototype [ 7 ] . Also acknowledging the role , perspective , and experience of the researcher , but with a focus on design , autobiographical design has been articulates and is defined as “design research drawing on ex - tensive , genuine usage by those creating or building a system . ” [ 59 p . 514 ] . It aims for “understanding not only how interactive systems are lived with but also how they are designed , built , repaired , and it - eratively appropriated” , “to study intimate , long - term , and personal relations between computers and humans“ [ 22 p . 753 ] . Further , it is characterized by complexity and tensions that are particularly relevant in writing up findings , be it ( a lack of ) sincerity , invisible NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Janne Mascha Beuthel et al .

To overcome those issues , Des - jardins and Ball suggest , among others , to report both on the design and usage , the lived - with experiences , and to describe decision mak - ing and all involved actors in detail ( ibid . ) . Our study is inspired by considerations from autoethnography and autobiographical design . It builds upon autoethnography in the way that experiences are collected and interpreted , and on autobiographical design , as we designed the interventions ourselves based on our own experiences and informed by our long - term engagement with remote communi - cation . However , we did not design the interventions with the aim in mind to be implemented later , but as exploratory probes , which is rarely the case in autobiographical design research . We had diverse reasons for building on the described methods : We designed the interventions and experienced them ourselves together with ( a ) person ( s ) that was / were either genetically and / or emotionally related to us . We intentionally wanted to be part of a study ourselves to test the interventions and their impact on ( our own ) personal and intimate remote relationships . By doing that , we felt more confident to be explorative and ( possibly ) fail . 3 . 3 Data Collection and Analysis For collecting the data during the interventions , we were building on different approaches : ( i ) visual materials : photographs taken by us and participants ; objects and drawings created during the interventions , e . g . , bracelet , letters , ( ii ) autoethnographic narratives describing our experiences , ( iii ) we asked the participants to re - spond to three reflective questions after the intervention ended in a written form : How did the intervention influence the relationship and communication ( between author and participant ) ? What did you enjoy and what didn’t you enjoy about the intervention ? Did you experience any long - term effects that superseded the duration of the intervention ( please describe them , if you did ) ? After collecting all the data , we reviewed them collectively and , through relating ( i . e . , comparing , contrasting , interpreting ) our own experiences with the others’ data , we jointly identified reoccurring themes that deemed relevant for designing remote communication in the future and go beyond the existing related work . The two resulting themes will be presented in chapter 5 in detail . 4 THE INTERVENTIONS Conducting this study with another ( remote living ) person that we felt close with allowed us to draw insights not only from our own experiences , but also from participants , who were not part of designing the interventions . At the same time , we knew that we would reveal personal experiences , reflections , pictures , possible challenges , and vulnerabilities . The interventions provoked us to disrupt strategies we have established with our loved ones prior to this study through providing tangible and embodied ways to be in touch . The resulting visual documentation of the interventions and the reflections represent the individuality of each participant and of each remote relationship , and also emphasize the variety in how materials were used in unexpected ways . 4 . 1 Study Set - up Each intervention included an instruction card with the description of the intervention , planned duration , activities , a remark on docu - menting the intervention through taking photos , and an informed consent ( an information sheet detailing the study and its goals , the procedures , data collection and storage , and informing them about their rights ; and a form to be signed by the participants , if they agreed with the data collection ) . In two interventions , children participated . Here , their parents signed the informed consent . All necessary physical materials were provided and sent to participants . For each intervention , both participating parties received identical materials . The interventions were either sent to participants per post or e - mail , depending on whether they included any physical materials . Due to the variety of activities and participants , the du - ration and execution of the interventions differed highly . Table 2 provides an overview . We developed the interventions together , then conducted them in parallel with no discussions about them during the course of the interventions . During and after the interventions , we wrote autoethnographic , “personal narratives” [ 23 , 24 ] , which are “sto - ries about authors who view themselves as the phenomenon and write evocative narratives specifically focused on their academic , research , and personal lives” [ 23 p . 279 ] . After finishing the interventions , we got together again . The personal narratives functioned as a form of documentation ; we en - gaged with them in depth and related , contrasted , and summarized our experiences . In the following , we present each intervention in detail , includ - ing involved materials , activities , the participants and our relation and usual communication with them , excerpts from autoethno - graphic narratives and of the responses to the questions posed to participants , and links to related work on remote communication . 4 . 2 Letters without Writing Digital messaging is widely used in remote communication , yet , is often perceived as less personal and intimate , e . g . , [ 21 ] and some claim that handwritten media are preferred , e . g . , [ 29 ] . In this in - tervention , we explored how physical letters without text would establish a connection and visual form of remote communication , Exploring Remote Communication through Design Interventions : Material and Bodily Considerations NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Table 2 : Overview of interventions , participants and participating author , duration , provided physical materials and the setting Interventions Participants , Age Author Relation Duration Physical Materials Setting Letters without Writing ( a ) P1 , 31 years A1 Friends Two months Envelopes , blanc paper , stickers , a balloon , feathers Non - digital , creating and sending letters Letters without Writing ( b ) P2 , 3 years P3 , 29 years A1 Friends ; P3 is P2’s mother Two months Envelopes , blanc paper , stickers , a balloon , feathers Non - digital , creating and sending letters Send a Point P4 , 32 years A2 Friends One month One postcard Through digital and non - digital messages Get Creative P5 , 2 years P6 , 38 years P7 , 56 years P8 , 59 years A3 DaughterHusbandMother - in - law Father - in - law One - time activity , impact for several weeks Stickers , feathers , blanc paper During video call Exchange a Bracelet ( a ) P 11 , 33 years A1 Siblings One months Yarn , plastic beads , envelope Non - digital , creating and wearing bracelet Exchange a Bracelet ( b ) P 12 , 2 years P13 , 56 years P14 , 59 years A3 DaughterMother - in - law Father - in - law Four weeks , ( with bracelets still existing ) Yarn , wooden beads , stickers , envelope Non - digital , creating and wearing bracelet Exercise Together ( a ) P 15 , 31 years A1 Friends Daily during one week Cards with exercises and amounts of repetitions During video call Exercise Together ( b ) P16 , 32 years A2 Siblings Three times during two weeks Cards with exercises and amounts of repetitions During video call and , informed by related work on remote sketching , e . g . , [ 31 , 77 , 86 ] , how sketches and other non - textual forms of expression would cre - ate a feeling of connectedness over distance . In the intervention , two participants were asked to send two letters to each other without being allowed to write text . The partic - ipants were provided with envelopes , blanc paper , various stickers , a balloon and feathers to be used in the letters , if desired . The in - tervention was conducted twice : ( a ) P1 ( 31 years old , friend ) and A1 . The participant and author are lifelong friends that live in two different countries , meaning they can only meet rarely . They are usually communicating through digital messages and video calls . ( b ) P2 ( 3 years old son of P3 ) and P3 ( 29 years old friend ) and A1 . P2 is the son of a childhood friend of A1 ( P3 ) . P2 and A1 usually do not have any form of remote communication and only interact during visits of A1 , which happen one or two times a year . With this intervention , we wanted to explore communication that unfolds in a physical medium , i . e . , a letter , but provokes an unconventional use , i . e . , no text . In this way , participants had to express themselves differently , compared to their usual communi - cation . The provided materials , e . g . , stickers , functioned as creative prompts and invited for an exploratory use of the format . 4 . 2 . 1 Experiences P1 and A1 . The first letter was sent by A1 , it con - tained drawings . The responding second letter by P1 was a collage ( see fig . 1 ) , where she tried to visualize the positive and negative aspects of the current Covid - 19 related lockdown regulations . In response , A1 also created a collage that showed the activities she engaged in during the lockdown . Through the letters , they were able to develop a form of conversation that was expressed and man - ifested in images and sketches . They played with text in that both used cut - outs from magazines in their collages . Even though the letters did not include any written text , both participants were able to interpret and understand the other one’s message . P1 indicated that at first it was unusual for her to not be allowed to write , especially when she wanted to ask things like “How are you ? ” . But then she adapted to the task , and expressed her thoughts creatively : “ After looking at the letters , I had to think of them often , especially about what I was able to express in my letters to [ A1 ] . I think , those things , I could have not expressed with a conventional letter . ” A1 described : “ By being asked to not write , I felt enabled to express myself creatively and visually in ways , we would usually not communicate , or even express emotions we do not speak or write about in our usual communication . “ Through this intervention , the communication partners , who had maintained their personal rela - tionship mainly through digitally written words , were challenged to express themselves through a physical medium and with the help of additional , non - verbal material . 4 . 2 . 2 Experiences P2 , P3 and A1 . In contrast to Letters without Writing ( a ) , P2 and A1 usually do not have any form of remote com - munication . They only interact when they are co - located . Through NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Janne Mascha Beuthel et al . Figure 1 : ( from left to right ) P1 looking at A1’s letter ; her response to A1 ; P2 opening a letter from A1 ; P2 drawing a letter . this intervention , they explored how to establish a form of con - nection that allowed P2 to express himself ( see fig . 1 ) , and A1 to communicate with him visually . P2 was enabled to participate through P3 , his mother . P3 ex - plained the task to him , gave him the letters and supported him in answering . She said : “ I let him do the crafting for the most part and only occasionally intervened , so that it was at all recognizable to [ A1 ] , what he was trying to communicate . “ A1 described : “ With P3’s son , I had no form of communication . The letters enabled us to connect and communicate for the first time over distance . I was trying to make the letters interesting and fun for him , and also included some clues for P3 . ” After the intervention ended , P2 was asking his mother about the letters and if they could send and receive more of them . He liked especially the act of opening them and looking at everything inside the envelope , for example , one letter included a photo of P3 and A1 and a leaf that had been cut out from cardboard ( see fig . 1 ) . The physical letters functioned as a shared , tangible memory ; a form of communication that had not existed between the par - ticipants before . The task of not writing text was not a challenge for P2 , as he is used to express himself through drawings . It was more challenging to interpret his drawings , in comparison to Let - ters without Writing ( a ) , still , the letters established a sensation of connecting and enabling to build a relationship over distance . 4 . 3 Send a Point Digital , remote communication channels can be both : too much and overwhelming , but also not enough to share all emotions [ 35 ] . In - spired by related work on using minimal means of communication , e . g . , through emojis [ 32 , 88 ] or a single bit [ 43 – 45 ] , we explored the impact of only sending one symbol : a point . This idea was inspired by A2 , who had established this ritual with a distant friend . After they had a falling - out , their communication had reduced to sending only a point , as they had nothing else to say to each other . In this intervention , we wanted to explore the same routine , but connect it to positive emotions , i . e . , ask participants to send a point when thinking of each other to establish a minimal form of remote inti - macy . We aimed to provoke participants to use digital messages in an unconventional way , and by doing that , understand if exchang - ing less text , videos and photos could still be enough to maintain an emotional bond over distance . The intervention was conducted by P4 ( 32 years old ) and A2 . P4 is a good friend of A2 for ten years . In the past they met almost weekly and had a close connection . When A2 moved to a different city , and additionally due to the Covid - 19 related restriction , their communication changed and they only called each once a month . In the intervention , each participant was asked to only send a point via digital message when thinking about the other person . Additionally , one postcard was available to the participants , which they could use to send one physical point . We were curious to expand the possibilities that arise from a direct , digital connection [ 35 ] . The intervention intended to critique the flooding of digital messages , as it forces participants to minimize their communication to one symbol . 4 . 3 . 1 Experiences . P4 reflected : “Often , I am too tired or I don’t feel like talking and being social , or sometimes I don’t know what I could talk about , but I still want to be part of [ A2‘s ] everyday life . ” By sending the points , it became possible for her to communicate , even when feeling too exhausted for a long conversation or exchange of messages ( see fig . 2 ) . The points made the conversation between the participants ap - pear more calmly , compared to their usual communication . A2 : ” When I was thinking of P4 , I sent her a point and it was nice to know that she received it at that exact moment . I also enjoyed to receive an asynchronous point , a later response . ” Through the postcard , the digital points expanded into a physical form ( see fig . 2 ) and P4 de - scribed her reasons for sending the point , i . e . , why she had thought of A2 : “The ‘sending of points’ very soon took on a ritual character for me , which gave me a certain security , both in my everyday life ( e . g . , when I had a breakdown ) , but also in dealing with the fact that no physical meetings can take place between us because of the lockdown . ” P4 adapted the sending of points to match her needs by drawing a Exploring Remote Communication through Design Interventions : Material and Bodily Considerations NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Figure 2 : ( from left to right ) : Send a Point : Messages between P4 and A2 ; postcard with point from P4 ; P4 drew a point around a wound to communicate it to A2 . Get Creative : P5 and P6 during video call with P7 and P8 ; P5 with stickers on her hand point around a wound on her hand that she wanted to communicate to A2 ( see fig . 2 ) . The intervention even expanded beyond the two participants when other friends that had heard about it started to send points to A2 as well . Through this intervention a minimal approach to digital messaging was explored . The act of sending only one symbol did indeed not reveal a lot of information , yet , it created an instant reminder of the other person from a physical distance . 4 . 4 Get Creative When digital communication channels like video calls are used with children , they often turn away from the video and pursue a more physical , active and engaging action [ 3 , 5 ] . Through this intervention , we aimed to foster creative engagement of children during video calls , which is inspired by scholars who explored , for instance , remote sketching interfaces [ 1 , 86 ] , or a remote , creative play environment for families [ 40 ] . Our own experiences aligned with the reported findings and prompted us to translate creative activities such as drawing , which we often perform co - located , into a remote setting . In Get Creative , A3 participated with her child ( P5 , 2 years old ) , the child’s father ( P6 , 38 years old ) , and P5’s grandparents ( grand - mother P7 , 57 years and grandfather P8 , 60 years old ) , who were in a physical distance . The grandparents usually visit their grandchild once a week ( requiring them to travel approximately an hour ) . In between meetings , and in particular when not being able to meet for a while ( e . g . , when COVID - 19 restrictions were in place or in case of someone being ill ) , frequent video calls were conducted . For the intervention , all participants received physical materials consisting of stickers , feathers and paper to be used in creating a drawing during a video call . We speculated that the call would become more engaging and active for all participants . The result , a co - created drawing , could enrich the experience of a tangible con - nection in - between the participants and become a shared memory that extends beyond the intervention . 4 . 4 . 1 Experiences . The intervention was conducted during one video call and all participants were motivated and engaged to create something together ( see fig . 2 ) . A3 described : “ There was very little experience or sensation of physical distance in the moment of ‘working together’ on the drawing . If both sides are working intensively , the distance is not affecting anyone . ” Participating in a shared task and using the exact same materials during a video call resulted in both sides feeling the physical distance less , but feeling closer to each other , emotionally and spatially . The intervention expanded beyond its duration . A3 described : “ The picture is still looked at often and evokes the same ‘feelings of attachment’ than when it was created . My daughter wants to make more pictures , she enjoyed being creative with the grandparents . Then the grandparents liked it , too . ” Besides the drawing , P5 particularly enjoyed the stickers that were part of the handed - out materials . She placed them in various places in the house and A3 found them even two months after the intervention ended on walls , on P5’s hands , and face ( see fig . 2 ) . They kept on functioning as tangible reminders of the shared activity and the physically distant grandparents . 4 . 5 Exchange a Bracelet In this intervention , we aimed to create a non - digital , bodily con - nection . Others explored connecting remote bodies through , for example , exchanging pulse [ 33 , 50 , 74 , 87 ] , hugs [ 57 , 82 ] , hand holding [ 30 , 60 , 73 ] and kissing over distance [ 13 , 34 , 68 ] . These examples inspired us to explore tangible means of feeling connected to a remote person . Building on a familiar practice from our child - hood , making friendship bracelets , we asked participants to create a bracelet for each other during the intervention , which would function as a wearable , bodily reminder of the distant other . Two people received materials to make a bracelet , send it to each other by post and wear it for a week . The overarching aim was to explore how a self - made item would create an intimate , tangi - ble , and bodily connection over distance . We focused on fostering physical sensations on the skin through wearing a bracelet , which could become a bodily reminder of the remote person . Moreover , the bracelet would be moving around with the participant every day , and in this way , we speculated , could lead to a conscious or unconscious feeling of connectedness throughout various activities . We were interested in the experiences of wearing the bracelet , what thoughts or memories it could trigger , and how it could connect NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Janne Mascha Beuthel et al . Figure 3 : ( from left to right ) A1 wears the bracelet while cooking ; P11 wears the bracelet ; A1 send a photo to P11 after cutting off the bracelet ; the bracelet P12 created for the stuffed animal . bodies over distance . The intervention was conducted two - times in slightly different ways : ( a ) A1 participated with her sister ( P11 , 34 years old ) . They usu - ally meet irregularly a few times a year as they live in two different countries . Their main means of communication are video calls , dig - ital messages , and sending postcards . For the intervention , they received blue yarn and red , plastic beads , but were encouraged to use also other , available materials , if desired . Further , they received an envelope to send the bracelet to the other participant . For ( b ) A3 participated with her daughter P12 ( 2 years old ) , who exchanged a bracelet with P13 ( P12’s grandmother , 56 years old ) , and P14 ( P12’s grandfather , 59 years old ) . The grandparents and child usually meet regularly and have established several shared routines , such having particular stuffed animals to play with to - gether in each place . In the intervention we decided to provide larger , wooden beads , due to P12’s age and safety concerns , and additional stickers to decorate the bracelet . Further , the participants were not asked to wear the bracelet themselves , but create one for a stuffed animal to wear . 4 . 5 . 1 Experience P11 and A1 . While making the bracelet , both participants described that they aimed to create an aesthetically pleasing item . P11 made a pearl herself that showed the letter “M” , the first letter of both , P11’s and A1’s first names . Wearing the bracelet created an instant reminder of the other person throughout the day , but led also to reduced additional contact , e . g . , in the form of messages ( compared to their usual communication frequency ) . P11 said , “ It felt as if [ A1 ] were with me on my travels . ‘What would she do now’ , I was wondering sometimes , if I saw the bracelet in a specific situation or I thought that I would have liked to have you with me . ” Further she described how the materiality reminded her of A1 : “ I could feel the pearls in some situations and directly thought of you , when my arm was lying on something or pressure was applied . That varied from soft pressure to actual pain . ” After the intervention , A1 reflected : “ Taking it off was a challenge . We had set a one - week time frame for wearing the bracelets , but ended up wearing them much longer , three weeks . Before cutting them off , I felt particularly attached to it and was wondering for a long time whether I should keep it on . The cutting appeared harsh , as the bracelet had become a constant reminder of my sister . ” ( see fig . 3 ) . Through the intervention , the participants had developed a connection , which was linked to a physical item they had created for each other . Interestingly , their usual communication , in the form of digital messages , had decreased throughout the time and only unfolded in photos sent of the bracelet in daily life ( see fig . 3 ) . 4 . 5 . 2 Experience P12 , P13 , P14 and A3 . The participants created a necklace to wear by stuffed animals at P12’s home and her grandpar - ents’ place ( see fig . 3 ) . The grandparents , P13 and P14 , reflected that through the intervention , their remote communication changed : “ It is easier for P12 to stay concentrated during a video call , as we talk about something concrete ” , i . e . , the bracelet . A3 described : “ The intervention has a real long - term impact : P12 can directly engage with the grandparents , usually she needs a few minutes to warm up . Through the memories of the intervention , P12 can directly connect emotionally . ” P12 said , she would like to create more bracelets for other stuffed animals , adapting the intervention already as a regular routine . All participants claimed that they think about each other more often , when they see and think about the necklaces . They created a connection between the remote family members and function as a physical reminder of each other beyond the duration of the intervention ; even several months after creating them , they are revisited from time to time and not only remind of the each other , but also of the remote making . 4 . 6 Exercise Together Communication and doing sports together can both be seen as a dynamic , co - regulated and embodied activity that leads to physical connectedness [ 10 ] . Sharing movement - based activities when be - ing physically dislocated has been invested in the form of shared biking and geocaching [ 17 , 58 ] , and swaying in two connected rocking chairs [ 11 ] . We were inspired to explore means of shar - ing movement over distance . Through our own experiences , we had identified a sense of connectedness when going to the gym together , an activity that was hardly possible when living remotely . Exploring Remote Communication through Design Interventions : Material and Bodily Considerations NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark We wanted to explore a form of remote workout with the partici - pants , which is why we asked two participants in this intervention to exercise together during a video call . The intervention included two sets of cards : one with different exercises , one with repetition information ( such as push - ups ; 6 times ) . Each participant received one of the set of cards , which had to be picked and combined while exercising together . The participants were asked to do these exercises every other day for one to two weeks during a video call . The intervention was conducted twice by ( a ) P15 ( 31 years old , friend ) and A1 ; and ( b ) P16 ( 33 years , sister ) and A2 . P15 and A1 are close friends that work together , usually meet daily and used to go to the gym together several times a week , yet , due to Covid 19 - related restrictions were unable to meet in person . P16 and A2 do not live in the same city and , therefore , maintain their regular contact through calls and text messages . P16 is not a sportive person and A2 wanted to motivate her sister to move more through the intervention . The overarching idea was to include the whole body into the communication and to move together at a distance to increase well - being and a sense of playfulness . Figure 4 : ( from left to right ) : A1’s set up for the intervention , P16 and A2 working out during a video call 4 . 6 . 1 Experiences . The intervention allowed the participants to move together and experience a bodily connection over distance ( see fig . 4 ) . P16 described , “ We were closer , it was like [ A2 ] was right next to me , like we had met . Planning the activity also quickly became part of our daily life . We laughed more than when you just talk on the phone , because we were doing something together . We had a common success and a common goal in mind . ” P15 : “ I liked that the intervention motivated daily movement . Alone , I would have often not been motivated to do a workout at home . Yet , doing sports on camera was sometimes a bit awkward and led to some strange views on the body . ” A1 reflected : “ When we were not in the mood or did not like one exercise , we did not do it – we were in a way cheating on the intervention activity . I felt that created another level of connection , as we both decided it as a team , to not do one exercise . Not doing something over distance can also create a feeling of connectedness . ” Through this intervention , we were able to extend a conventional video call through physical exercises . Those replaced conversations in the call , as the participants were focused on fulfilling the repeti - tion of movements . The act of moving together , but also the act of cheating together , can create a bond and feeling of connectedness over physical distance . 5 DISCUSSION By experimenting with existing communication strategies , which were in this autobiographical design research study a set of design interventions based on video calls , digital messages and letters , we were able to collect various individual experiences and personal reflections . In the following , we discuss these experiences in re - lation to existing scholarly work to articulate the major insights that can be inspirational for designers and researchers of remote communication . 5 . 1 Reducing Complexity To disrupt and redesign existing communication strategies does not necessarily require the introduction of complex interactive artifacts or interfaces . Through the interventions , we were able to show , for instance , how the use of a few sparkling stickers in Get Creative enabled an enriched remote communication between grandparents and grandchild , which even continued long after the intervention ended . In Exercise Together , the act of cheating on a task strengthened the bond between participants . Through Send a Point , we were able to explore a reduced , minimal form of remote communication that Kaye [ 44 ] described as : “By itself , without context , a single bit of communication ( . . . ) has no value . However , when received by an individual within a certain context ( . . . ) that single bit of communication can leverage an enormous amount of social , cultural and emotional capital , giving it a significance far greater than its bandwidth would seem to suggest . ” ( p . 367 ) . In our interventions , the context created the value . If one would just send a point , it could be interpreted as an accident or even be ignored . But , knowing that the point is repurposed as a shared signal that means ‘something’ enables the remote connection to emerge . We expanded on the earlier mentioned approaches of using emojis as a minimal form of expressing emotions [ 88 ] , and connecting over distance through a single bit [ 43 , 44 , 71 ] , as we allowed the minimal form of communication to emerge beyond a pure digital space . Concretely , we encouraged participants to send a physical postcard with a point . Further , we found that the limited form of communication challenged creative interpretations by participants , for example , when P4 was drawing a point around an injury caused by a physical activity that she wanted to share with A2 . By taking a photo of the point drawn on her skin and sending it digitally to A2 , she adapted the point - sending to a hybrid form . Connecting over distance does not necessarily require the design of interactive , digital or hybrid means . There is not always the need to design ‘something’ , as discussed , for example , by Homewood [ 36 ] , who formulated “reflections on inaction” , emphasizing value of deliberately not designing . Inaction has also been addressed in Pierce’s [ 65 ] concept of “undesigning” , i . e . , “ the intentional and explicit negation of technology” ( p . 960 ) , and by Baumer and Silber - mann [ 6 ] , who described implications to not design technology . We NordiCHI ’22 , October 08 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Janne Mascha Beuthel et al . realize through the interventions that there is a constant tension between action and inaction , designing and not designing , introduc - ing complex interactions and minimal communication means . The interventions emphasize the value of exploring small changes in existing communication strategies before designing , which can be inspirational starting points for remote design concepts . Ultimately , designing ‘something new’ does not necessarily require to design ‘everything that’s possible’ ; and the reduction of complexity can also result in a strengthening of ( remote ) connectedness . 5 . 2 Connecting Remote Bodies ( Digitally ) The interventions aimed to explore existing forms of remote com - munication , yet enrich them through , for example , bodily notions . In Exercise Together , we translated the activity of going to the gym together to a remote setting , i . e . , working out during a video call ; and in Exchange a Bracelet , we aimed to create a material bond between two remote sisters through a well - established practice of making a friendship bracelet . Related work , as detailed above , often builds on creating an instant feedback , an instant exchange of biological data , such as pulse [ 50 , 87 ] , heart beat [ 33 , 74 ] , touch [ 63 ] , or body heat [ 15 ] - resulting in a “ direct connection ” [ 74 p . 864 ] between remote bodies . In Exchange a Bracelet , we intended par - ticularly to move beyond the existing approaches by exploring a non - digital form of enabling bodily connectedness while being at a distance . . We were inspired by Hassenzahl et al . [ 32 ] , who reviewed existing strategies that designers and researchers use to enable relatedness ; such as “physicalness” referring to “artifacts that medi - ate a feeling of physical intimacy” by simulating “either secondary effects of physical proximity ( e . g . , body heat , heartbeat ) or mean - ingful gestures ( e . g . , hugs , strokes ) . ” ( p . 50 : 5 ) . They described that “communication devices exclusively built to exchange emotions with the partner might evoke a ( counterproductive ) pressure to express one’s feelings . ” ( p . 30 : 15 ) , such as when both users have to engage in an experience simultaneously or when an input feedback is required that the other person might be waiting for . For this intervention , we took their insights on possible pressure related to providing instant feedback as an inspirational starting point for exploring a non - digital form of connecting remote bodies . In the intervention Exchange a Bracelet , the experience of con - nectedness was established through several aspects : making the bracelet for the other person , wearing it during daily life , feeling the bracelet on the skin and sending photos of wearing it back and forth . Despite the lack of an instant feedback , the participants described that they did feel a bodily connection , an experience of bodily presence of the remote other that resulted in an emotional bond towards each other . For example , the imprint of the beads that occurred while wearing the bracelet became a material reminder of the remote other and the act of cutting off the bracelet was de - scribed as painful , as it appeared like a termination of their bodily , remote connection . Referring to Hassenzahl et al . ’s [ 32 ] findings , the bracelets enabled to strengthen the feeling of relatedness without applying pressure to provide instant responses . In Exchange a Bracelet , we also asked participants to deliber - ately not use digital communication and they did anyway . They adapted the interventions to their personal needs and desires of remote connection . P11 and A1 were asked to take photos of them - selves wearing the bracelet for documentation purposes only , and even though it was not intended , they began to send the photos to each other . They used this format to reassure and confirm that they were both wearing the bracelet and were thereby connected to each other . It appears as if connecting bodies over a physical distance through physical means ultimately includes ‘something digital’ . We , therefore , conclude that experiencing remote , bodily connectedness through a non - digital activity or thing , might actu - ally evolve by naturally integrating digital means . Designing for remote communication , then , means to allow digital components to expand non - digital communication over distance , while preserving an emphasis on physical contact . 6 CONCLUSION In this paper , we set out to explore : How do we experience remote communication that is limited in interactivity , materials , extent , or scope ? What bodily and material qualities are meaningful in remote communication ? We responded to these research questions through design interventions that translated co - located activities to a re - mote space , reduced communication practices to a specific action , mediated remote activities through concrete activities and used material replacements as reminders of distant others . The inter - ventions allowed us to explore possibilities for enhancing existing strategies for staying in touch and feeling connected . By means of an autobiographical design approach , we created , experienced , and analyzed remote interactions from a perspective that builds upon related work and our own life worlds alike , in order to add a multifaceted understanding of how to stay in touch when being geographically distant . These insights contribute a perspec - tive that combines bodily , playful , creative , and sometimes minimal means . Through discussing the interventions , we formulate reflec - tions , which aim to inspire the design of rich , meaningful , tangible and bodily ways of communicating and connecting with people over physical distance . We encourage others that intend to design new ways of connecting people to firstly disrupt current routines . Our main insights are that such disruptions can be small changes that aim to reduce complexity to strengthen ( remote ) connected - ness , and can manifest in exploring ( non - digital ) bodily connections without adding pressure on users . We further found that inviting participants to not use digital means can enable insights on how they challenge the boundaries of that request . Intervening , rein - venting , disrupting and redesigning the existing will ultimately challenge and enrich the way we communicate and connect across distances in the future .
