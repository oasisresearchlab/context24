Goldmacher 1 , Thomas Chittenden 8 , and John M . Lambert 8 Abstract A majority of ovarian and non – small cell lung adenocarcino - ma cancers overexpress folate receptor a ( FR a ) . Here , we report the development of an anti - FR a antibody – drug conjugate ( ADC ) , consisting of a FR a - binding antibody attached to a highly potent maytansinoid that induces cell - cycle arrest and cell death by targeting microtubules . From screening a large panel of anti - FR a monoclonal antibodies , we selected the humanized antibody M9346A as the best antibody for targeted delivery of a maytansinoid payload into FR a - positive cells . We compared M9346A conjugates with various linker / maytansinoid combinations , and found that a conjugate , now denoted as IMGN853 , with the N - succinimidyl 4 - ( 2 - pyridyldithio ) - 2 - sulfo - butanoate ( sulfo - SPDB ) linker and N 2 0 - deacetyl - N 2 0 - ( 4 - mer - capto - 4 - methyl - 1 - oxopentyl ) - maytansine ( DM4 ) exhibited the most potent antitumor activity in several FR a - expressing xeno - graft tumor models . The level of expression of FR a on the surface of cells was a major determinant in the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effect of the conjugate . Ef ﬁ cacy studies of IMGN853 in xenografts of ovarian cancer and non – small cell lung cancer cell lines and of a patient tumor - derived xenograft model demonstrated that the ADC was highly active against tumors that expressed FR a at levels similar to those found on a large fraction of ovarian and non - small cell lung cancer patient tumors , as assessed by immunohistochemistry . IMGN853 dis - played cytotoxic activity against FR a - negative cells situated near FR a - positive cells ( bystander cytotoxic activity ) , indicating its ability to eradicate tumors with heterogeneous expression of FR a . Together , these ﬁ ndings support the clinical development of IMGN853 as a novel targeted therapy for patients with FR a - expressing tumors . Mol Cancer Ther ; 14 ( 7 ) ; 1605 – 13 . (cid:2) 2015 AACR . Introduction The folate receptor - a ( FR a ) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol - linked cell - surface glycoprotein that has high af ﬁ nity for folates ( 1 ) . Its physiologic role in normal and cancerous tissues has not yet been fully elucidated . Most normal tissues do not express FR a , and transport of physiologic folates into most cells is thought to be mediated by several other proteins , most notably , reduced folate carrier ( 2 ) . High levels of FR a have been found in serous and endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer , endometrial adeno - carcinoma , and non – small cell lung cancer of the adenocarcino - ma subtype ( 3 – 8 ) . Importantly , FR a expression is maintained in metastatic foci and recurrent carcinomas in ovarian cancer patients ( 9 ) , and after chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers ( 10 ) . These properties , together with the highly restricted expression of FR a on normal tissues , make FR a ahighly promising targetfor cancertherapy , and haveprompted a variety of experimental approaches for developing FR a - targeted therapies ( 11 – 13 ) . Two FR - targeting agents with distinct mechanisms of action , vintafolide ( EC145 ) , which targets both FR a and FR b , and farle - tuzumab , whichisFR a - speci ﬁ c , havebeenevaluatedinadvanced - stage clinical trials . Vintafolide is a small - molecule conjugate of folate with a cytotoxic vinca alkaloid , which is selectively inter - nalized into cells through binding and uptake by FRs ( 14 , 15 ) . Vintafolide showed promising clinical activity in a randomized phase II study in combination with pegylated liposomal doxo - rubicin for treatment of FR þ , platinum - resistant , ovarian cancer ( 16 ) , but a phase III study failed to con ﬁ rm the clinical bene ﬁ t of vintafolide in this setting . The agent is under investigation as a therapy for other FR þ tumors . EC1456 , a conjugate of folic acid with a more potent than vinca alkaloid cytotoxic effector , tubu - lysin ( 17 ) , demonstrated strong antitumor activity in human 1 Department of Cell Biology , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachu - setts . 2 Department of Pharmacology Toxicology , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts . 3 Departmentof Biochemistry , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts . 4 Department of Antibody Engineering , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts . 5 Department of Biomar - kers , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts . 6 Department of Bioanalytical Science , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts . 7 Department of Translational Research and Development , Immuno - Gen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts . 8 Research and Development , ImmunoGen , Inc . , Waltham , Massachusetts .

MCT - 14 - 1095 xenograft models ( 18 ) , and recently entered a phase I study . Farletuzumab ( MORAb - 003 ) , a humanized anti - FR a monoclo - nal antibody thatwas reported to exert antitumor activity through antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement - dependent cytotoxicity ( 19 ) , has been evaluated in ovarian cancer patients as a single agent , and in combination with chemother - apy . A phase III study that tested farletuzumab in combination with carboplatin and a taxane did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression - free survival in platinum - sensitive ovar - ian cancer patients ( 20 ) . A second phase III trial evaluated farle - tuzumab in platinum - resistant ovarian cancer patients in combi - nation with paclitaxel , but was stopped early after failing an interim futility analysis . Therapy with this FR a - targeting noncon - jugated antibody was generally well tolerated , but to date has not been proven to be ef ﬁ cacious . Thus , emerging clinical data indi - cate that there is a need for FR a - targeted agents with improved antitumor activity . Antibody – drugconjugates ( ADC ) composedofhighlycytotoxic agents conjugated to antibodies that bind to tumor - associated antigens represent a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the potency of tumor - targeting antibodies . ADCs offer the potential to combine the favorable pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , and tumor - targetingpropertiesofantibodieswiththepotentcellkilling mechanism provided by the attached small molecule , or payload . Clinical validation of this concept has been achieved with the regulatory approval of two ADCs , brentuximab vedotin for relapsed / refractory Hodgkin disease and anaplastic large cell lym - phoma and ado - trastuzumab emtansine for recurrent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) – positive breast cancer ( 21 – 24 ) . The latter conjugate consists of the HER2 - targeting anti - body , trastuzumab , conjugated by the thioether linker , SMCC , to the maytansinoid , DM1 . Maytansinoids are microtubule - targeting heterocyclic compounds that inducemitotic arrestandsubsequent cell death ( 25 , 26 ) . Promising results have been reported with a number of additional antibody – maytansinoid conjugates in ear - lier stages of clinical development ( 27 – 30 ) . Here , we describe the preclinical development of a FR a - target - ing antibody – maytansinoid conjugate , IMGN853 . The design of this FR a - targeting ADC , including selection of its antibody and linker components , was based on optimization of its antitumor activity . IMGN853 exhibited potent anticancer activity that was dependent on the expression of FR a . Moreover , IMGN853 was highly active in tumor models having levels of FR a expression representative of those in tumor samples from patients with ovarian and non - small cell lung cancer , supporting the develop - ment of this ADC as a novel FR a - targeted therapy . Materials and Methods Cell lines KB ( human cervical adenocarcinoma ) , Jeg - 3 ( human choriocar - cinoma ) , Skov - 3 , Ovcar - 3 and Ov - 90 ( human ovarian adenocar - cinomas ) , and HCC827 and H2110 ( human lung adenocarcino - mas ) were purchased from the ATCC . Igrov - 1 human ovarian carcinoma was purchased from the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnostics , the National Cancer Institute , Frederick , Mary - land . Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma was pur - chased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures . The cell lines were obtained within the period of 2000 – 2015 . The cell lines were characterized by the manufacturers ; no further cell line authentication was conducted . Upon receiving from a manufac - turer , each cell line was expanded by passaging two to three times , aliquoted , and frozen . For use in experiments , cell lines were culturedinmediarecommendedbythemanufacturersinahumid - i ﬁ ed incubator at 37 (cid:2) C , 6 % CO 2 for no longer than 2 months . Immunoconjugates Anti - FR a ADCs were prepared with either N 2 0 - deacetyl - N 2 0 - ( 3 - mercapto - 1 - oxopropyl ) - maytansine ( DM1 ) or N 2 0 - deacetyl - N 2 0 - ( 4 - mercapto - 4 - methyl - 1 - oxopentyl ) - maytansine ( DM4 ) via the succinimidyl - 4 - ( N - maleimidomethyl ) cyclohexane - 1 - carboxylate ( SMCC ) , the N - succinimidyl 4 - ( 2 - pyridyldithio ) pentanoate ( SPP ) , the N - succinimidyl 4 - ( 2 - pyridyldithio ) butanoate ( SPDB ) , or the N - succinimidyl 4 - ( 2 - pyridyldithio ) - 2 - sulfobutanoate ( sulfo - SPDB ) linkers according to the protocols developed at ImmunoGen , Inc . and described previously ( 31 – 33 ) . The may - tansinoid per antibody ratio varied from 3 . 3 to 5 . 0 . Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining ofFR a informalin - ﬁ xed paraf ﬁ n - embedded cell lines , normal and tumor tissues , and human xenografttissues were performed usinganti - FR a antibody clone BN3 . 2 and the Leica Bond RX Automated Stainer ( both purchased from Leica Microsystems ) . Slides were baked at 60 (cid:2) C and dewaxed using Bond Dewax Solution ( Leica Biosystems ) and absolute ethanol . Following a 20 - minute heat - induced epitope retrieval using Bond Epitope Retrieval 2 ( ethylenediaminetetraa - cetic acid – based solution , pH 9 . 0 ; Leica Biosystems ) and a 5 - minute treatment with 3 % hydrogen peroxide to inactivate endogenous peroxidase , slides were incubated with either the anti - FR a murine monoclonal antibody BN3 . 2 , or an isotype - control antibody ( muIgG1 ; Beckman Coulter ) at 1 . 9 m g / mL for 15 minutes , developed using Bond Re ﬁ ne detection system ( Leica Biosystems ) and counterstained with hematoxylin . All tissue slides were evaluated and scored by a board - certi ﬁ ed pathologist . FR a staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 ( 0 ¼ no speci ﬁ c staining similar to that of the isotype control , 1 ¼ weak , 2 ¼ moderate , and 3 ¼ strong staining ) . Uniformity of the staining was scored as negative ( no cells exhibited positive staining ) , focal ( < 25 % of cells stained ) , heterogeneous ( 25 % – 75 % of cells stained ) , and homogeneous ( > 75 % of cells stained ) . Generation of anti - FR a monoclonal antibodies Balb / c mice were immunized with either FR a - positive KB cells , or the murine syngeneic B cell line 300 - 19 stably transfected with human FR a . The hybridoma clones were produced as described previously ( 34 ) andscreenedby ﬂ owcytometrywithFR a - positive and - negative cell lines for secretion of anti - FR a antibodies . Antibodies were puri ﬁ ed using MabSelect SuRe ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) in accordance with the manufacturer ' s protocol . Binding assay Binding of anti - FR a antibodies and their maytansinoid con - jugates to cells was evaluated ﬂ ow - cytometrically by indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence .

Indirect ( " piggyback " ) cytotoxicity assay Fab - fragment of polyclonal anti - murine antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) conjugated to DM4 via a non - reducible linker was used . In initial sets of experiments , cells were exposed to a range of Fab - DM4 concentrations , and the maximal nontoxic concentration of the conjugate was chosen . The concen - tration varied from 0 . 1 to 1 nmol / L depending on the cell line . Serial dilutions of anti - FR a antibodies in culture medium that contained the maximal nontoxic concentration of Fab - DM4 were added to cells ( 1 (cid:3) 10 3 / well to reach a total volume of 200 m L / well ) . The plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 (cid:2) C , 6 % CO 2 . Cell viabilitywasdeterminedbytheWST - 8assay ( DonjindoMolecular Technologies , Inc . ) in accordance with the manufacturer ' s proto - col . Later , we con ﬁ rmed that the ranking of the cytotoxic activities of the available anti - FR a antibody – maytansinoid conjugates in vitro was reliablypredictedbytherankingofthecytotoxicactivities of the respective antibodies in the indirect assay . Cytotoxicity assay Dilutions of conjugates or unconjugated maytansinoid in the appropriate culture medium were added to wells of 96 - well ﬂ at - bottomed plates containing 1 (cid:3) 10 3 cells per well . The plates were incubatedat37 (cid:2) C , 6 % CO 2 foreither5days ( continuosexposure ) or for 4 hours followed by 5 - day incubation in conjugate - free medium ( short exposure ) . Cell viability was determined by the WST - 8 assay ( Donjindo Molecular Technologies , Inc . ) in accor - dance with the manufacturer ' s protocol , and IC 50 were generated using a sigmoidal dose – response ( variable slope ) nonlinear regression curve ﬁ t ( GraphPad Software Inc . ) . IMGN853 processing To identify maytansinoid catabolites of IMGN853 formed within FR a - positive cancer cells , KB cells were treated with 3 [ H ] - IMGN853 for 30 minutes , and 3 [ H ] - labeled metabolites were analyzed after 22 - hour incubation in 3 [ H ] - IMGN853 - free medium by HPLC and liquid scintillation counting . The detailed protocol was reported previously ( 35 ) . To analyze IMGN853 processing by various FR a - positive cell lines , cells were exposed to 25 nmol / L ( a saturating concentration ) of 3 [ H ] - IMGN853 or 3 [ H ] - M9346A for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:2) C , washed in PBS to remove any unbound antibody or conjugate , resuspended in fresh culture medium , and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C in a humidi ﬁ ed 6 % CO 2 atmo - sphere for 22 hours . The amount of protein - free radioactivity ( processed antibody ) and protein - associated radioactivity ( unprocessed antibody ) was assessed following acetone extrac - tion and liquid scintillation counting , and the data were used to calculate the antibody - binding sites per cell ( ABC ) , % processed antibody , and pmol processed antibody ( see the detailed descrip - tion in Supplementary Methods ) . Bystander cytotoxic activity A mixed culture of FR a - positive cells 300 - 19 transfected with human FR a ( FR a - 300 - 19 ) and FR a - negative cells 300 - 19 was exposed to IMGN853 at a concentration that is nontoxic for the FR a - negative cells but highly toxic for the receptor - positive cells ( killing 100 % of the cells ) . Cells were incubated for 4 days , and the inhibition of cell proliferation was determined by WST - 8 - based assay ( Dojindo Molecular Technologies ) . In vivo ef ﬁ cacy Five - week - old female CB - 17 severe combined immunode - ﬁ cient ( SCID ) mice were obtained from Charles River Laborato - riesandquarantinedfor7dayspriortostudyinitiation . Micewere inoculated subcutaneously with cells ( 1 (cid:3) 10 7 cells per mouse ) resuspended in serum - free culture media ( KB , Igrov - 1 cells ) or 50 % Matrigelinserum - freeculturemedia ( Ovcar - 3 , Skov - 3 , Ov - 9 , and H2110 cells ) . When tumor volume reached about 130 mm 3 , mice were randomized and received a single intravenous bolus injection of PBS ( control ) or maytansinoid conjugates . Tumor dimensions were measured two or three times per week and volume was calculated as 1 / 2 ( L (cid:3) W (cid:3) H ) , where L is the length , W is the width , and H is the height of the tumor . All procedures were carried out in accordance with the " Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals " ( National Research Council ) . Ef ﬁ cacy studies on a patient - derived non - small cell lung cancer xenograft model LXFA - 737 were performed at Oncotest GmbH . Female NMRI nu / nu mice , 6 - weeks old , were obtained from Harlan Laboratories . LXFA - 737 tumor xenografts were serially passaged in nude mice . After removal from donor mice , tumors werecutintofragments ( 4 – 5mmdiameter ) andtransplantedinto recipient mice . After tumor size reached about 110 mm 3 , mice received a single intravenous injection of a maytansinoid conju - gate or PBS . Tumor dimensions were measured twice weekly and volume was calculated as ( A (cid:3) B 2 ) (cid:3) 0 . 5 , where A represents the largest and B the perpendicular tumor diameter . All experiments wereconductedaccordingtotheguidelinesoftheGermanAnimal Welfare Act ( Tierschutzgesetz ) . Typically , 6 mice per group were used . A partial tumor regres - sion was de ﬁ ned as a reduction in tumor volume by 50 % or greater . A complete tumor regression was scored when no palpa - ble tumor could be detected . A two - tailed Student t test was used to test the null hypotheses that there are no statistical signi ﬁ cance differences in tumor volumes of mice that underwent various treatments . No adjust - ments for multiplicity were attempted and all tests were carried out at the 0 . 05 a level . Results Selection of a FR a - binding antibody for a maytansinoid ADC The overexpression of FR a in various malignancies makes it an attractive target for ADC development . Because no clear function - al role has been established for FR a in tumor cell growth or survival ( 36 ) , we sought to identify the optimal antibody com - ponent for a FR a - targeting ADC based on its ability to deliver a maytansinoid payload to FR a - expressing tumors in vitro and in vivo . An additional antibody selection criterion was equivalent binding to both human and monkey FR a , in order to enable relevant preclinical toxicology studies . A panel of murine monoclonal FR a - binding antibodies was generated by standard hybridoma procedures and screened for bindingby ﬂ owcytometrytocelllinesexpressingeither humanor monkey FR a . Antibodies were screened for their capacity to deliver a maytansinoid payload into FR a - positive cells using a high - throughput indirect " piggyback " cytotoxicity assay .

MCT - 14 - 1095 assay , cellswereexposed toamixtureofananti - FR a antibodyand a goat anti - murine - IgG polyclonal antibody Fab fragment conju - gated to the maytansinoid DM4 . Fab format was used for the secondary ADC rather than whole IgG to avoid possible cross - linking of FR a by the secondary ADC , which might affect the cytotoxicity of the complex . More than a hundred anti - FR a antibodies were tested and found to widely differ in their piggy - back cytotoxic potencies ( summarized in Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . A subset of the most active murine antibodies identi ﬁ ed by this indirect ADC cytotoxicity assay were evaluated as direct maytan - sinoid conjugates in vitro and ﬁ ve of these were then selected for humanization . In addition , a humanized derivative of the previ - ously described anti - FR a antibody Mov19 ( 4 , 37 , 38 ) , denoted M9346A , waspreparedandaddedtothegroupofantibodiestobe evaluated . The antibodies were humanized by variable domain resurfacing ( 39 ) . To compare the ability of the selected antibodies to deliver a cytotoxic payload , a noncleavable linker was chosen over a cleavable linker . This was done to avoid bystander cytotoxic activity of cleavable conjugates that could contribute to their in vitro and in vivo activity . Inside the cell , reducible maytansinoid conjugates are processed and release cytotoxic metabolites that cross cellular membranes and kill neighboring cells ( bystander cytotoxic activity ) , while the metabolites released after processing of nonreducible conjugates do not easily penetrate cellular mem - branes ( 40 ) . Results of representative comparative studies for ﬁ ve of the conjugates using the FR a - positive KB cell line are shown in Table 1 for in vitro binding and cytotoxicity , and in Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table S1 for in vivo ef ﬁ cacy . Although these con - jugates were similar in their af ﬁ nity toward FR a and in their cytotoxic potency in vitro , the conjugate of the M9346A antibody was signi ﬁ cantly more active in vivo , as supported by the results of the Student t test , Supplementary Tables S2A and S2B . In similar comparative invivo experiments , theM9346Aantibodyinvariably yielded the most active conjugate and therefore was chosen as the most promising antibody candidate for a maytansinoid ADC . To test whether the superior activity of the M9346A conjugate in vivo was related to an activity of its antibody moiety , we examined unconjugated M9346A antibody . In vitro , M9346A exhibited some antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity against FR a - positive Igrov - 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) , while no detectable complement - dependent cytotoxicity or anti - prolifer - ative activity against target - positive cells was observed . In vivo , the M9346A antibody did not exhibit any antitumor activity against KB xenograft tumors ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Although the basis for the superior in vivo ef ﬁ cacy of the M9346A conjugate has not been identi ﬁ ed , varying in vivo ef ﬁ cacies of anti - CD22 – SMCC – DM1 conjugates with similar af ﬁ nity and in vitro potency has also been reported ( 41 ) . Optimization of the ADC linker / maytansinoid combination Following selection of M9346A as the antibody component , further studies were conducted to optimize the design of an FR a - targeted ADC . Conjugates of M9346A with four linker / maytansi - noid combinations , SPP - DM1 ( hindered disul ﬁ de linker ) , SPDB - DM4 ( highlyhindereddisul ﬁ delinker ) , sulfo - SPDB - DM4 ( highly hindered disul ﬁ de hydrophilic linker ) , and a thioether - based SMCC - DM1wereprepared ( depictedinFig . 2A ) . Theseconjugates were tested for their cytotoxicity against three cell lines , KB , Igrov - 1 , and Jeg - 3 ( Table 2 ) , which differed in the expression levels of FR a ( Table 3 ) . The conjugates were equally cytotoxic against KB cells , which had the highest FR a expression , while the disul ﬁ de - linked conjugates were more active than the thioether conjugate against the two cell lines with lower expression , Igrov - 1 and Jeg - 3 . The cytotoxic activity of the conjugates was demonstrated to be FR a - selective because it decreased by at least 10 - fold in the presence of a saturating excess of the M9346A antibody . Having established that the four M9346A conjugates showed potent antigen - selective cytotoxicity in vitro , their ef ﬁ cacy against tumor xenograft models in immunode ﬁ cient mice was evaluated . M9346A – SMCC – DM1 conjugate was highly ef ﬁ cacious against the KB xenograft model at a dose of 11 mg / kg ( Fig . 1 ) , but only marginally active at a lower dose of 2 . 5 mg / kg ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , the DM4 - containing disul ﬁ de - linked conjugates were highly active at the 2 . 5 mg / kg dose level , with M9346A - sulfo - SPDB - DM4 being equally or more active than the other conju - gatesinall tested models ( Fig . 2C – E ) , assupported bythe Student t test analysis ( Supplementary Tables S3 – S5 ) . The less hindered disul ﬁ de - containing SPP – DM1 conjugate was less active than the DM4 - containing conjugates . A nontargeting isotype - matched antibody – SPDB – DM4 conjugate was inactive against KB model even at a 2 - fold higher dose ( 5 mg / kg ) demonstrating that the Table 1 .

IMGN853 exhibits bystander cytotoxic activity Disul ﬁ de - linked maytansinoid ADCs have been shown to elicit bystander cytotoxic activity due to the formation of active may - tansinoid metabolites that are able to diffuse from antigen - pos - itive cancer cells into the neighboring cells ( 40 ) . The bystander cytotoxic activity of IMGN853 was assessed using mixed cell culture assays of FR a - negative murine B cell line 300 - 19 and its subline transfected with human FR a .

MCT - 14 - 1095 The number of FR a molecules on the surface of a cell is a key determinant of its sensitivity toward IMGN853 The cytotoxic activity of IMGN853 ( continuous exposure ) was evaluated on several FR a - positive cell lines that differed in FR a expression levels , while being similarly sensitive to the noncon - jugated cell - permeable maytansinoid S - methyl - DM4 ( Table 3 ) . Three cell lines that expressed on the average 3 (cid:3) 10 5 FR a per cell orhigherweresensitivetoIMGN853inaFR a - selectivemanner , as indicated by the ability of an excess of unconjugated M9346A antibody to decrease the cytotoxic effect of the conjugate . The cytotoxicity of IMGN853 to four cell lines with FR a expression below 1 (cid:3) 10 5 copies per cell was not decreased in the presence of an excess of M9346A . InthepresenceofM9346A , thecytotoxicityofIMGN853forthe KB cell line after a continuous exposure was reduced 14 - fold ( the IC 50 value increased from 0 . 1 nmol / L to 1 . 4 nmol / L ) , while the cytotoxicity of IMGN853 after a 4 - hour exposure followed by 5 - day culturing in conjugate - free medium was reduced 180 - fold ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . The cytotoxicity of a maytansinoid conjugate with a nonreducible linker , M9346A - SMCC - DM1 , was similartothatofIMGN853 , andthecytotoxicity ofanontargeting human IgG1 – SMCC – DM1 conjugate was similar to that of IMGN853 under blocking conditions ( continuous exposure ; Supplementary Fig . S6 ) , suggesting that the nonspeci ﬁ c cytotox - icity of IMGN853 for KB cells was not a result of its reduction with the release of free maytansinoid in the medium , but possibly stemming from pinocytotic uptake of a conjugate by the cells . The seven cell lines reported in Table 3 differed in their sensitivity to IMGN853 under blocking conditions that may re ﬂ ect different capacities for nonspeci ﬁ c uptake or metabolism of the conjugate . The ability of the cell lines to process IMGN853 was also assessed as a possible determinant of their sensitivity to the conjugate . The intracellular processing of 3 [ H ] - IMGN853 , in which tritium was incorporated into the C - 20 methoxy group of the DM4 , led to formation of three major catabolites , lysine - N e - sulfo - SPDB - DM4 , DM4 , and S - methyl - DM4 in KB cells ( Supple - mentary Fig . S7 ) . This result was similar to that previously reported for SPDB - linked DM4 conjugates ( 35 ) . The extent of intracellular processing of 3 [ H ] - M9346A , where the antibody was labeled with the radioactive tracer N - succinimidyl - 2 , 3 - 3 [ H ] pro - pionate , was similar to that of 3 [ H ] - IMGN853 ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) , suggesting that intracellular processing of the antibody and the conjugate both occur primarily through the lysosomal processing pathway , and that 3 [ H ] - M9346A could be used as a surrogate for IMGN853 processing . Assessment of the 3 [ H ] - M9346Aprocessing inthesevencelllinesevaluated forIMGN853 cytotoxicity demonstrated that the extent of antibody processing was similar in these cell lines ( Table 3 ) , suggesting that the total amountofactivemetabolitegeneratedbyprocessingIMGN853inthecellswasdirectlyproportionaltotheantigennumberonthe cell surface , rather than to differences in the extent of conjugate processing . IMGN853 is active in xenograft tumor models that express FR a at clinically relevant levels Having observed a correlation between the level of cell - surface expression of FR a and speci ﬁ c sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of IMGN853 in vitro , it was important to assess the activity of IMGN853 in tumor xenograft models in mice that express FR a at levels representative of that in patients ' tumors . Therefore , an IHC assay was developed with a dynamic range able to discern differinglevelsof FR a on patienttumor samples , inordertoallow comparison with tumor xenograft samples . Analysis of ovarian and non - small cell lung tumor samples with this new assay revealed a wide variation in expression levels and incidence of FR a - positivity . Serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas and adenocarcinoma of the lung had the highest percentage of FR a positive tumors , consistent with previously reported data ( 6 , 8 ) . Most tumors of these subtypes were strongly positive , with 71 % , 51 % , and 59 % having a score of (cid:5) 2 heterogeneous and homo - geneous , respectively ( Supplementary Table S6 ) . Levels of FR a expression on a panel of ovarian and non - small cell lung cancer cell line – derived xenografts grown in mice were also analyzed by the IHC method and compared with the levels detected in patient tumor tissues . FR a expression in Igrov - 1 , Ovcar - 3 , and OV - 90 ovarian xenograft tumors was scored as 3 homogeneous , 3 heterogeneous , and 2 heterogeneous , respec - tively . These scores were similar to those of a majority of ovarian clinicaltumorsamples ( SupplementaryTableS6 ) . FR a expression innon - smallcelllungcancerxenograftsofthecelllineH2110and of the LXFA737 patient - derived primary tumor xenograft scored as 3 homogeneous and 2 homogeneous , respectively , similar to the expression of FR a in a majority of non - small cell lung cancer samples tested ( Supplementary Table S6 ) . Xenograft samples from Skov - 3 cells ( which have low FR a level in vitro ; see Table 3 ) scored negative for FR a expression by this IHC assay . Antitumor activity of IMGN853 was assessed in mice bearing these xenografts ( Fig . 3 ) . The conjugate was found to be highly active in all FR a - positive xenograft models tested causing either complete or partial regressions ( Ovcar - 3 , Igrov - 1 , H2110 , and LXFA - 737 ) , or tumor growth delay ( Ov - 90 ) , at the highest dose tested ( a single administration of approximately 5 mg / kg ) . In the Ovcar - 3 and Igrov - 1 models , the conjugate was also active at a Table 3 .

MCT - 14 - 1095 lower single dose of 2 . 4 mg / kg . Multiple injections of the conju - gate ( 2 . 8 mg / kg , weekly (cid:3) 3 ) increased activity of IMGN853 causing more durable complete regression than that induced by a single injection ( KB model ; Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . The con - jugate was inactive against the FR a IHC – negative Skov - 3 tumors , and a control conjugate of a nontargeting isotype - matched anti - body was also inactive where tested ( Fig . 3 ) , demonstrating that IMGN853 activity is FR a - targeted . Thus , IMGN853 was highly active in ovarian and non - small cell lung cancer xenograft models that express FR a at clinically relevant levels . The conjugate was well tolerated at all tested doses . No toxicity was observed after IMGN853 treatment , as assessed by monitoring of clinical signs and body weight . In a separate experiment , the maximum - toler - ated dose of IMGN853 in CD - 1 mice was determined to be approximately 80 mg / kg . Discussion Ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer are the two most common gynecologic cancers , accounting in the United States for a combined 62 , 000 new cases and 23 , 000 deaths , and world - wide rates of 14 . 5 ( incidence ) and 5 . 8 ( mortality ) per 100 , 000 ( 42 ) . Lung cancer , with more than 80 % of it being non - small cell lung cancer , is the main cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide , mainly because of tobacco smoking and relatively poor ef ﬁ cacy of existing therapeutic approaches ( 43 ) . Despite continuing advances in treating these cancers , there are still a large number ofpatientswhoprogresstoadvancedmetastaticdisease , forwhich no curative treatment exists . Thus , there is an unmet medical need for these patients , and the effort is ongoing to develop novel therapeutic strategies , including the development of ADCs . FR a is an attractive therapeutic target for an ADC treatment for these cancers because , as the previous reports ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) and this study show , it is highly and widely expressed on many types of ovarian and non - small cell lung cancer , while being absent or expressed only at low levels on most normal tissues . IMGN853 is aconjugateof the M9346A antibody andthe DM4 maytansinoid , which are joined via the disul ﬁ de - containing hydrophilic linker sulfo - SPDB . As reported here , the design of this conjugate , including selection of its antibody , linker , and maytansinoid components , was based on an experimental approach to optimize the antitumor activity of the ADC against FR a - expressingtumors . IMGN853bindstoFR a onthecellsurface with high af ﬁ nity , and then is internalized , degraded in the lysosomes , and active DM4 metabolites are released . These DM4 metabolites induce cell - cycle arrest and subsequent cell death . These metabolites are capable of diffusing into proximal tumor cells andkilling themdue to bystandercytotoxic activity ( 40 ) . The bystander killing activity of a conjugate may be bene ﬁ cial where its penetration into a solid tumor is limited and / or target expres - sion among the tumor cells is heterogeneous . A similar thioether conjugatethatwasequallypotent invitro , butlackedthebystander cytotoxic activity , was much less ef ﬁ cient in eradicating xenograft tumors in mice , suggesting that bystander activity is an important Figure 3 .

Mice bearing tumors derived from cell lines ( Igrov - 1 , Ovcar - 3 , Ov - 90 , Skov - 3 , or H2110 ) or from a patient tumor ( LXFA - 737 ) received single intravenous injection of IMGN853 , vehicle control PBS , or nontargeting huIgG1 - sulfo - SPDB – DM4 conjugate . The conjugates were injected on day 7 ( Igrov - 1 and NCI - H2110 ) , day 14 ( Ov - 90 ) , day 20 ( Ovcar - 3 , LXFA - 737 ) , or day 25 ( Skov - 3 ) aftercellinoculationwhenthetumorvolumereachedabout130mm 3 .

MCT - 14 - 1095 component of IMGN853 ef ﬁ cacy in vivo . The ef ﬁ ciency of proces - sing of IMGN853 and generation of active DM4 metabolites was found to be similar in all tested FR a - positive cell lines , suggesting that the differences in their sensitivity to IMGN853 were not related to the conjugate processing . Among the anti - FR a conju - gates tested with disul ﬁ de - containing linkers , the sulfo - SPDB - linked conjugate IMGN853 was the most active in vivo , while the SPP - linked conjugate was the least active . Our understanding of the factors that determine the antitumor activity of maytansinoid conjugates is not yet complete . At present , we can only speculate thatthisrankingofantitumoractivityforthethreeconjugatesmay stem from the higher exposure of the intact sulfo - SPDB and SPDB conjugates compared with the SPP conjugate in tumor - bearing miceduetotheirmorestablehighlyhindereddisul ﬁ debond , and , also , due to increased tumor retention of the conjugate with the more hydrophilic sulfo - SPDB linker compared with the less hydrophilic SPDB . Previously , we reported that huC242 — SPDB – DM4 conjugate was retained longer in circulation of mice and had a greater antitumor activity on human tumor cell line xenografts in mice than huC242 – SPP – DM1 ( 44 ) . In addition , we found that sulfo - SPDB - linked conjugates were capable of eradi - cating P - glycoprotein – expressing multidrug resistant cells ( 45 ) , which might be bene ﬁ cial because some ovarian and non - small cell lung cancers express this protein ( 46 ) . Our data indicate that the expression of FR a on the cell surface is a key determinant of sensitivity of tumor cells to IMGN853 , providing the rationale to further explore FR a expression in patient tumors as a candidate biomarker for IMGN853 activity . Tothisend , aclinicalassayforsemi - quantitativedeterminationof FR a expression levels is currently under development , wherein FR a expressionlevelswillbescoredbythepercentageofpositively stained tumor cells at each of three staining intensities . Using an IHC assay capable of detecting differences in the levels of FR a expression in tumors , we identi ﬁ ed xenograft tumor models that express FR a at levels similar to those found in ovarian and non - small cell lung cancer patient samples . IMGN853 was remarkably active in these models , with minimally effective doses on a mg / kg basis among the lowest reported for maytansinoid ADCs in preclinical studies . Our ﬁ ndings indicate that IMGN853 is a promising therapeutic candidate and support its clinical evalua - tion , currently under way , for treatment of FR a - expressing cancers ( 47 ) .
