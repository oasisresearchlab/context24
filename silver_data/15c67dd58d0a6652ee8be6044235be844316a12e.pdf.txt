By entering into distinct macromolecular complexes , they act as convergent nodes of different signalling pathways . The role of WAVE in generating lamellipodial protrusion during cell migration is well established . Conversely , the precise cellular functions of N - WASP have remained elusive . Here , we report that Abi1 , an essential component of the WAVE protein complex , also has a critical role in regulating N - WASP - dependent function . Consistently , Abi1 binds to N - WASP with nanomolar affinity and , cooperating with Cdc42 , potently induces N - WASP activity in vitro . Molecular genetic approaches demonstrate that Abi1 and WAVE , but not N - WASP , are essential for Rac - dependent membrane protrusion and macropinocytosis . Conversely , Abi1 and N - WASP , but not WAVE , regulate actin - based vesicular transport , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) endocytosis , and EGFR and transferrin receptor ( TfR ) cell - surface distribution . Thus , Abi1 is a dual regulator of WAVE and N - WASP activities in specific processes that are dependent on actin dynamics . Dynamic assembly of actin filaments generates the forces that support motile behaviour , which is critical for a variety of cellular processes , including cell shape changes , cell migration and cytokinesis 1 , 2 . The actin cytoskeleton is also implicated in endocytosis and vesicular transport 3 . In vivo , actin is assembled at a steady state . New filaments are ini - tiated at the membrane in a site - directed fashion , by autocatalytic filament branching 1 , 2 . This reaction is catalysed by the N - WASP – or WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex machinery , whose activation is induced by the small G proteins Cdc42 and Rac , respectively 4 . The modalities through which these proteins are regulated reveal unexpected levels of complex - ity . For instance , N - WASP is locked in an auto - inhibited state .

Conversely , binding of WIP ( WASP interacting protein ) or its related protein CR16 , to N - WASP results in the formation of an inhib - ited WIP / CR16 – N - WASP complex , which exerts a critical role in integrat - ing signalling cascades , leading to actin polymerization 5 . Additionally , a number of SH3 - containing proteins , such as Nck and Grb2 , have been reported to bind and activate WASP / N - WASP , often acting synergistically with either Cdc42 or PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ref . 3 ) . Among these proteins , endo - philin A , intersectin , syndapin / pacsin and more recently cortactin , have been previously characterized as endocytic proteins , consistent with the involvement of N - WASP in transport / internalization processes 3 . Unlike N - WASP , WAVEs are endowed with constitutive activity , but their regulation is achieved via the formation of macromolecular com - plexes 6 . The majority of both WAVE1 and - 2 in cells is in a complex with : Nap1 , an Nck - associated protein 7 ; PIR121 / Sra - 1 , identified as a Rac effector 8 ; HSPC300 , a small protein ( with relative molecular mass 9 , 000 ; M r 9K ) 9 ; and Abi1 , an Abl - binding partner 10 . Whether WAVE is active or maintained inactive within this complex is still a matter for debate 9 , 11 . Whatever the case , Abi1 is an essential component of this complex , posi - tively regulating WAVE activity in vitro , and connecting WAVE to Rac through the assembly of a WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex 11 – 13 . Thus , a model is emerging whereby N - WASP / WAVE family mem - bers , by assembling into multi - molecular units , act as convergent nodes of different signalling inputs regulating actin dynamics in a variety of different processes . Functionally , however , whereas WAVEs have been demonstrated to be essential for Rac - dependent actin remodelling 11 , 14 , 15 , the cellular role ( s ) of WASP / N - WASP has remained largely elusive . Here , starting with the unexpected discovery that Abi1 — a key compo - nent of the WAVE complex — also binds and potently activates N - WASP , we utilized a combined biochemical , cell biological , and molecular genetic approach to define the modalities through which functional specification of WAVE and N - WASP activity , via Abi1 , is achieved . print ncb1304 . indd 969 print ncb1304 . indd 969 15 / 9 / 05 3 : 50 : 06 pm 15 / 9 / 05 3 : 50 : 06 pm Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 970 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2005 L E T T E R S Abi1 is a scaffolding protein that permits the assembly of different multi - molecular complexes 6 , 16 , 17 including the WAVE – Abi1 – NAP1 – PIR121 / Sra1 complex , which is essential for the formation of membrane protrusions where it specifically localizes 11 , 15 . Notably , the other major member of the WASP / WAVE family , N - WASP , has also been reported to exist in an activated state in lamellipodia 18 . Moreover , at least in Drosophila , the homologue of Abi1 binds WASP , predicting a role in N - WASP / WASP - dependent actin dynamics 19 . To explore this possibility , we tested whether Abi1 and N - WASP interact in vitro and in vivo . Recombinantly produced and purified Abi1 and N - WASP formed a complex in vitro , indicating that their interaction is direct ( Fig . 1a ) . Mapping of the interaction surfaces revealed that the SH3 domain of Abi1 mediates the binding to N - WASP ( Fig . 1a ) . Actin polymeriza - tion assays showed that N - WASP was activated by Abi1 to stimulate actin polymerization ( Fig . 1b ) . Abi1 was effective at concentrations in the nanomolar range , and exhibited a saturation behaviour . Maximum stimulation was observed at Abi1 concentrations similar to N - WASP ( 10 −8 M ) , consistent with a M r value in the nanomolar range for the Abi1 – N - WASP complex ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . The activation of N - WASP by Abi1 was relieved by the Sos - 1 - derived peptide , which inhibits the activation of N - WASP by the SH3 domain of Grb2 ( ref . 20 ) , and the SH3 - mediated interactions of Abi1 ( ref . 21 ) , indicating that the binding of the SH3 domain of Abi1 to N - WASP is required for activation . Accordingly , the isolated SH3 domain of Abi1 activated N - WASP ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) with a half - effect ( the concentration at which half - maximal stimulation is seen ) similar to that of the N - terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Notably , the half - effect of full - length Abi1 was at a concentration 45 - fold lower than that of the isolated SH3 domain ( 680 nM ) ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , suggesting that additional residues of Abi1 are needed for full activity . Direct comparison between Abi1 and Grb2 indicated that the concentration of full - length Abi1 leading to half - maximal stimulation of N - WASP ( 15 nM ) was sevenfold lower than that of Grb2 ( 115 nM ) ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , supporting the notion that Abi is one of the most potent SH3 - containing activators 22 of N - WASP . Notably , Abi1 is much more effective in N - WASP than in WAVE activation , for which a half - effect of about 0 . 2 µM was recorded 11 . Moreover , the acti - vation of N - WASP by one molar equivalent of Abi1 was not affected by addition of Nap1 – PIR121 complex ( data not shown ) . Finally , Abi1 synergized with Cdc42 ( Fig . 1c ) , but not with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( data not shown ) , in activating N - WASP when both proteins were used at satu - rating concentrations . Because the binding affinity between Cdc42 and N - WASP ( K d = 0 . 45 µM ) was not affected by Abi1 ( data not shown ) , the cooperative effect on N - WASP - dependent actin polymerization reflects the ability of Cdc42 and Abi1 to simultaneously bind N - WASP at distinct sites in a ternary complex that shows maximal activity , supporting the view that Cdc42 and Abi1 regulate N - WASP in a coordinated fashion . a b SH3 Abi1 GST I His − N - WASP Lysate IP Ctr Abi1 ID lysates Ctr Abi1 Abi1 N - WASP WAVE WB Abi1 HA − Abi1 Myc − N - WASP N - WASP Lysate Lysate IP IP Ctr Ctr HA Myc WB tfx d e Time ( s ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 WAVE Abi1 N - WASP F l a g − N - W ASP F l a g − N - W ASP IP Flag Lysate 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 300 900 1 , 500 Time ( s ) Actin + Arp2 / 3 NW NW + A , 18 nM NW + A , 9 nM NW + A , 36 nM NW + A + P NW − VCA NW + SH3 A r b i t r a r y un i t s A r b i t r a r y un i t s Cdc42Abi1Abi1 + Cdc42 N - WASP + Arp2 / 3 f c − / − − / − WB − + − + + + + + Figure 1 Abi1 binds to and activates N - WASP .

Notably , Abi1 immunoprecipitates also contained WAVE , as previously shown 11 , 12 , 15 , suggesting that Abi1 may regulate / integrate the activities of the two major nucleation pro - moting factors ( NPFs ) , N - WASP and WAVE . Only a small fraction of total N - WASP , compared with the majority of WAVE ( more than 90 % ) , was found bound to Abi1 ( Fig . 1e ) , supporting the existence of two distinct Abi1 - based , NPF - containing complexes . Consistently , no N - WASP could be detected in WAVE immunoprecipitates , which con - tained Abi1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . Additionally , Abi1 , but not WAVE , was present in N - WASP immunoprecipitates obtained from N - WASP knockout cells stably re - expressing Flag - tagged N - WASP ( Fig . 1f ) . Finally , in gel filtration experiments , Abi1 perfectly co - eluted with WAVE , whereas it only partially cofractionated with N - WASP , indicating that Abi1 and N - WASP form a complex of relatively low abundance , distinct from that containing WAVE or other known Abi1 interactors , such as Sos - 1 or Eps8 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . Thus , Abi1 is a physiological and direct interactor of N - WASP and a potent inducer of its activity . The finding that Abi1 can interact with WAVE through its N - termi - nal region , and with N - WASP through its SH3 domain , indicates that this adaptor may use its different domains to integrate or function - ally specify the activity of the major NPFs in cells . To explore these possibilities , a molecular genetic approach that exploits RNAi - based technology was used to generate cells in which the expression of either the entire WAVE - based complex or N - WASP was ablated . To this end , Abi1 and N - WASP were individually or simultaneously knocked down in HeLa cells ( Fig . 2a ) . As an additional control , we also generated cells in which Nap1 was silenced . As previously reported , RNAi - medi - ated removal of Abi1 or Nap1 also led to the degradation of all the other subunits of the WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex , leaving the expression levels of N - WASP unaltered ( Fig . 2a ) . Conversely , N - WASP interference by RNAi did not affect the protein levels of Abi1 , WAVE , Nap1 and PIR121 ( Fig . 2a ) . Notably , the simultaneous interference of Abi1 and N - WASP led to the silencing or degradation of both N - WASP and the WAVE - based complex ( Fig . 2a ) . Active N - WASP has been localized to membrane protrusions by live fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) analysis 18 . Additionally , the WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex was shown to be essential for initiating Arp2 / 3 - dependent , site - directed polymerization at the leading edge of lamellipodia . This suggests that at this site Abi1 may integrate the activity of both WAVE and N - WASP . To test this , membrane ruffling in response to EGF stimulation was monitored in the various knockdown cells . Removal of the WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex by knock - ing down either Abi1 or Nap1 strongly diminished EGF - induced ruffles ( Fig . 2b and data not shown ) . Conversely , no inhibition could be observed upon removal of N - WASP ( Fig . 2b ) , in agreement with the observation GFP EGFR GFP Abi1 wt Abi1 DAWN 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 GFPAbi1 wt Abi1 DAWN P e r ce n t a g e o f t f x ce ll s w i t h r e d u ce d E G F R s t a i n i n g EGFR Vinculin Ctr + Nap1 KD Ctr + N - WASP KD Ctr + Abi1 KD Ctr + Abi1 / N - WASP KD EGFR GFP Ctr − GFP KD − GFP a b c * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * C t r N - W ASP K D A b i 1 K D A b i 1 / N - W ASP K D Figure 3 Removal of Abi1 or N - WASP increases EGFR at the cell surface . ( a ) Ablation of Nap1 , Abi1 , N - WASP , or Abi1 and N - WASP increases cell - surface EGFR . Control HeLa cells , expressing lentivirus - driven GFP ( ctr – GFP ) , were mixed with Nap1 - ( ctr + Nap1 KD ) or Abi1 - ( ctr + Abi1 KD ) ablated cells obtained as described in the Methods . Alternatively , control HeLa cells , infected with empty pSuper - based vectors , were mixed with N - WASP - ( ctr + N - WASP KD ) or N - WASP - and Abi1 - ablated ( ctr + Abi1 / N - WASP KD ) cells expressing GFP ( KD – GFP ) . Cells were then fixed , and anti - EGFR antibodies that recognize an extracellular epitope were used prior to permeabilization to detect cell - surface EGFR . The GFP epifluorescence enabled control ( ctr – GFP positive ) to be distinguished from knockdown cells in the Abi1 and Nap1 cases ( upper panels ) . Conversely , N - WASP knockdown and Abi1 / N - WASP knockdown , but not wild - type cells , were GFP positives ( lower panels ) .

Further support for the notion that the activities of WAVE and N - WASP are independent came from the observation that EGF - induced macropinocytosis , which has been functionally coupled to Rac activity , actin remodelling and WAVE functions 14 , was reduced upon removal of the WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex ( Abi1 and Nap1 knockdown cells ) , but unaffected by N - WASP ablation ( Fig . 2c ) . N - WASP is essential for actin - based motility of different pathogens , such as Shigella flexneri or Vaccinia virus 23 , 24 . Upon invasion , these pathogens hijack the host machinery that is used for actin polymeriza - tion , inducing the formation of actin comet tails to drive their move - ments . This process mimics the naturally occurring N - WASP - mediated rocketing of endomembrane - derived vesicles 25 , which is enhanced in mammalian cells by the expression of the lipid kinase phosphatidyli - nositol - 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase ( PIP ( 5 ) K ) , leading to the generation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich endomembranes 26 . Analysis of the cellular localiza - tion of Abi1 revealed that it is specifically recruited to the surface of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced rocketing vesicles in HeLa cells and a variety of different cell lines , displaying a pattern that overlaps with that of N - WASP ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a – c and Movie S1a ) . Notably , no WAVE proteins were detected in these structures ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) , suggesting that localization at specific intracellular sites of different Abi1 – NPF pools may dictate their functional roles . Consistently , individual removal of N - WASP or Abi1 significantly impaired the formation of actin tails induced by PIP ( 5 ) K ( Fig . 2d ) . A similar impairment could also be observed upon Nap1 removal ( Fig . 2d ) , which leads to degradation of Abi1 , in addition to WAVE and PIR121 ( Fig . 2a ) . However , ectopic re - expression of Abi1 in these cells was sufficient to restore PIP ( 5 ) K - induced comet tail forma - tion ( Fig . 2e ) , but not EGF - induced ruffling ( data not shown ) . Thus , the Abi1 – N - WASP , but not the WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex , whose stability could not be rescued by Abi1 expression , is sufficient for optimum vesicle motility . Notably , this WAVE - independent activity of Abi1 is conserved throughout evolution ; in Drosophila , bristle formation is independent of WAVE , but dependent on Abi1 / WASP ( Bogdan et al . 27 , accompanying manuscript ) . In addition to vesicular transport , WASP and N - WASP , and their yeast homologue Las17 , have been implicated in endocytosis of membrane receptors 28 , 29 . In mammals , endocytosis of membrane receptors , such as EGF and transferrin receptors , proceeds mainly through the forma - tion of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and vesicles 30 . Direct visualization of the recruitment of actin and N - WASP accompanying the internali - zation of single CCPs can only be obtained by using two - colour total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy 31 – 33 . Using a similar approach , we found that Abi1 , but not WAVE2 ( ref . 33 ) , could be specifi - cally recruited to these sites ( see Supplementary Information , Fig .

More importantly , ectopically expressed Abi1 and N - WASP extensively colocalized at the cell surface in spots whose lateral mobility — which has been shown to frequently accompany the pinching off of vesicles 31 , 34 , 35 — was significantly increased ( see Supplementary Information , Movie S2 ) . Remarkably , the lateral motility of Abi1 - and N - WASP - containing spots on the plasma membrane was strictly depend - ent on actin dynamics , because no such movements were detected in the presence of the G - actin - sequestering drug , Latrunculin A ( see Supplementary Information , Movie S3 ) . Collectively , these observations suggest a site - specific functional role exerted by Abi1 and N - WASP in mediating actin - dependent endocytic events . Accordingly , individual removal of either Abi1 or N - WASP caused a comparable reduction in the initial rate of internalization of EGFR ( Fig . 2f ) , which relies on clathrin - mediated uptake 30 . Moreover , concomitant silencing of Abi1 and N - WASP did not cause any worsening of the phenotype , providing genetic evidence that these proteins act in the same signalling cascade ( Fig . 2f ) . Thus Abi1 critically modulates N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - stimulated actin polymerization in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . The expression of membrane receptors , such as EGFR and TfR , at the cell surface depends on the rates of protein synthesis and protein degra - dation , and on endocytic transport 36 . The involvement of Abi1 and N - WASP in endocytosis and vesicular transport prompted us to look at the distribution of cell - surface EGFR and TfR . EGFR and TfR are considered to be the prototypes of ligand - induced and constitutive internalization , respectively 30 . Individual removal of N - WASP , Abi1 , or Nap1 signifi - cantly increased the amount of EGFR at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3a ) , as revealed by staining , prior to permeabilization , of cell - surface recep - tors with an antibody that recognizes the extracellular portion of the EGFR . Notably , the total steady - state levels of EGFR were not affected in the various knockdown cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Most importantly , the expres - sion of Abi1 , but not of a mutant impaired in the SH3 domain 21 nor of WAVE2 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) , significantly lowered the amounts of cell - surface EGFR in Nap1 - knockdown cells ( Fig . 3c ) . Moreover , the transient transfection of Abi1 in Nap1 knockdown cells was not sufficient to restore WAVE expression ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b ) . Finally , no effect on cell - surface levels of EGFR ( or TfR ; see below ) were observed following the expression of a mutant of WAVE2 that lacked the verprolin homology domain ( ∆VPH - WAVE2 ) and was shown to act as a dominant negative 37 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a , b ) . Together , these results emphasize the relevance and specificity of the Abi1 – N - WASP complex , but not of the WAVE complex in regulating EGFR cellular distribution . Additional evidence was obtained by ectopically expressing Abi1 or N - WASP in wild - type HeLa cells . Under these conditions , the levels of cell - surface EGFR were significantly reduced ( the opposite is observed following RNAi - mediated ablation of the same proteins ) , indicating that Abi1 and N - WASP are limiting factors in this process ( Fig . 4a ) . The effect of Abi1 was entirely dependent on N - WASP , but not on WAVE , because ectopic expression of Abi1 failed to decrease EGFR at the surface of N - WASP - knockdown cells , but not of WAVE2 - knockdown cells ( Fig . 4b ) . Moreover , a mutant of Abi1 no longer able to associate with WAVE2 , but retaining the N - WASP - binding capability , was as efficient as wild - type Abi1 in decreasing cell - surface EGFR ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4c ) . Similarly , individual ablation of either N - WASP or Abi1 increased the intensity of the rhodamine - conjugated transferrin signal . Notably , most of the signal derived from the cell surface , as it could be removed by acidic washes prior to fixation ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Hence , the levels of cell - surface TfR , but not the total TfR ( Fig . 5c ) , were significantly affected by interference with either Abi1 and / or N - WASP . Often , concomitant signalling events are needed to optimally regulate , in vivo and in vitro , N - WASP - mediated actin dynamics .

Additionally , Cdc42 and Abi1 synergistically activated N - WASP in vitro ( Fig . 1c ) . Thus , multiple signalling events probably contribute to specifying the functional role of the Abi1 – N - WASP complex . In summary , we showed that Abi1 is a critical N - WASP modulator dur - ing endocytosis and vesicular transport . Notably , Abi1 is also an essential component and regulator of the WAVE - based complex acting downstream of Rac . Interestingly , this dual regulation of N - WASP and WAVE by Abi1 appears to be conserved throughout evolution , being documented also in Drosophila 19 , 38 . Thus , Abi1 seems to sit at the heart of a multilayered system of regulation for the actin cytoskeleton , raising the interesting possibil - ity that by entering N - WASP - and / or WAVE - based protein complexes , it may functionally orchestrate the activities of these two major nucleation promoting factors within cells . As a result , it may contribute to specify - ing WAVE and N - WASP functions in actin - dynamics - based membrane protrusion and intracellular transport , respectively . METHODS Expression vectors . HA - tagged Abi1 , wild - type EGFP – Abi1 , EGFP – Abi1 – DAWN ( a mutant impaired in the SH3 domain ) , and EYFP - Abi1 or EYFP - ∆N - Abi1 plas - mids were previously described 21 . Bovine Myc - tagged N - WASP was provided by M . Kirschner . Myc - tagged PIP ( 5 ) K was a gift from L . Machesky . EGFP - tagged wild - type N - WASP , N - WASP H208D and N - WASP ∆pro vectors were described in ref . 24 . Human Flag - tagged ∆VPH WAVE2 was a gift from T . Takenawa . Antibodies . Anti - HA - 11 , anti - Myc 9E10 , anti - His , anti - Abi1 , anti - WAVE , anti - Nap1 and anti - PIR121 antibodies were described in ref . 11 . Anti - N - WASP was kindly provided by T . Takenawa . Monoclonal anti - vinculin and anti - VASP were from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) . Anti - EGFR ( Ab - 1 ) was from Oncogene Research Products ( Cambridge , MA ) . Polyclonal anti - HA was from Santa Cruz ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Monoclonal anti - Flag and anti - Tubulin β were from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) . TfR antibodies were from Zymed ( San Francisco , CA ) . Rhodamine - conjugated EGF and transferrin were from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Recombinant proteins . Full - length Abi1 , the isolated SH3 domain of Abi1 , Cdc42 and Rac1 were produced as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli as described 11 . Full - length Grb2 and its SH3 domain were produced as described 20 . Actin was isolated from rabbit muscles and purified in the Ca - ATP – G - actin form by Sephadex G - 200 chromatography in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris – HCl at pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) 39 . Actin was fluorescently labelled with pyrenyl - iodoacetamide 39 . Human His – N - WASP was expressed in Sf9 cells 40 . The C - terminal domain ( VCA ) of human N - WASP was expressed as a recombinant GST fusion protein and separated from GST by pro - teolytic cleavage 41 . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine brain 39 . The proline - rich peptide used to inhibit the interaction between Abi1 and N - WASP was previously described 20 , 21 . Generation of HeLa - knockdown cells . Abi1 - and WAVE2 - knockdown cells were generated as described in ref . 11 . Nap1 - knockdown cells were obtained by infection with pSuper - Retro - puro - Nap1 ( ref . 15 ) , and single clones were isolated . Three selected clones were further characterized for their expression of Nap1 and the components of the WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex , and for their lack of ruffling in response to EGF . Similar results were obtained with all the clones analysed . All the subsequent experiments were then performed with one of the isolated clones . N - WASP knockdown was obtained by infecting Abi1 knock - down or control HeLa cells twice with an shRNA - expressing pLL3 . 7 lentivirus 42 . This enabled 100 % efficiency of infection . Attempts to isolate single clones with complete N - WASP protein depletion failed repeatedly . All the experiments were thus performed on the resulting mass population . N - WASP downregulation was determined by immunoblot analysis ( Fig . 2a ) . Actin polymerization assays . Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 10 % pyrenyl - labelled actin . Polymerization was induced by addition of KCl ( 0 . 1 M ) , MgCl 2 ( 1 mM ) and EGTA ( 0 . 2 mM ) to a solution of Ca - ATP – G - actin containing Arp2 / 3 and the different proteins as described in Fig . 1 . Fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in a Safax flx spec - trofluorometer in which polymerization time courses of up to 10 samples can be monitored simultaneously 11 . Addition of Abi1 to pyrenyl – actin and Arp2 / 3 had no effect on actin polymerization ( data not shown and ref . 11 ) . The affinities of Abi1 , Cdc42 or SH3 domain were derived from analysis of the dependence of the maximal rate of actin polymerization on ligand concentration as described 20 . Transfection , immunofluorescence microscopy and cell biological assays . Cells seeded on gelatin were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using FuGene ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 24 h , cells were processed for epifluorescence or indirect immunofluores - cence microscopy . Briefly , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 2 % BSA for 10 min , and then incubated with the primary antibody for 45 min , followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 30 min . F - actin was detected by staining with phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) at a concentration of 6 . 7 U ml −1 . The formation of EGF - induced ruffling was monitored as described 11 . The initial rate of EGFR endocytosis was determined as described 43 . PIP ( 5 ) K - induced comets were determined as described 17 . In vitro binding , co - immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments were as described 11 . BIND identifiers .

NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY 5 Movie S1a - b Three - D reconstructions from confocal Z - section series of Abi1 - and N - WASP - containing comet tails . HeLa cells were co - transfected with GFP - Abi1 ( Abi1 ) or GFP - N - WASP ( N - WASP ) and myc - tagged PIP5K , fixed and processed for epifluorescence to visualize GFP - proteins ( green ) , and stained with phalloidin or anti - myc to detect F - actin ( red ) or PIP5K ( not shown ) , respectively . Still images are shown in Fig . 2a . Confocal sections ( 60 ) were taken every 300 nm along the Z - axis , and three - D reconstruction was obtained using ImageJ software . Movie S2 GFP - Abi1 rocketing by actin - based motility at the surface of PI5K - induced vesicles . Fibroblast cells were co - transfected with GFP - Abi1 and myc - tagged PIP5K , and processed for epifluorescence video microscopy . Display rate is 144x . Movie S3 Enhancement of the motility of N - WASP - containing pit - like structures by co - overexpression of Abi1 . N - WASP null fibroblasts 3 co - overexpressing GFP - N - WASP and mRFP - Abi1 were examined by dual - color time lapse TIRF microscopy . Note the virtually complete co - localisation of the ectopically expressed proteins in structures reminiscent of pit - like accumulations as observed at low expression levels for both proteins ( see Figure S3 ) . The enhanced lateral mobility of these pit - like structures , moderate levels of which were reported to frequently precede or accompany the disappearance from the plane of illumination and hence pit internalization 4 , 5 is indicative of increased N - WASP activity effected by Abi1 overexpression , since this phenotype was not observed in cells with low expression levels of the latter protein as exemplified in Figure S3 ) . Display rate is 40x . Movie S4 Latrunculin A treatment blocks the motility of N - WASP and Abi - 1 - containing pit - like structures . N - WASP null fibroblasts 3 co - expressing GFP - N - WASP and mRFP - Abi1 were examined by dual - color time lapse TIRF microscopy . The observed motility of N - WASP and Abi1 - containing structures required actin polymerization , since it was abruptly arrested by addition of Latrunculin A ( 0 . 5µM ) and restored upon washout of the drug as indicated . SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS . The mRFP - clathrin construct and the experimental setup employed for dual - colour through the objective TIRF microscopy will be described elsewhere ( Benesch et al . , in press 1 ) . mRFP - Abi1 was generated by exchanging EGFP for mRFP ( kindly provided by Roger Y . Tsien ) in EGFP - Abi1 . For video microscopy of cells ectopically expressing PI5K or for examination by TIRF illumination , fibroblasts were routinely grown on glass - coverslips coated with 50µg / ml fibronectin ( Roche ) . Single - or dual - color epifluorescence video microscopy was performed essentially as described ( Steffen et al . , 2004 ) employing a 100x , 1 . 4NA objective with or without 1 . 6 intermediate optovar magnification . For counterstaining of the actin cytoskeleton of the PI5K / Abi / N - WASP expressing cell in Figure S2c , the coverslip was fixed on the microscope stage with 4 % formaldehyde ( 20 minutes ) and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( 30 seconds ) , followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 350 coupled phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . Images were acquired in PBS containing 100mM dithioerythritol to avoid photobleaching . Latrunculin A was purchased from SIGMA . 1 . Benesch , S . et al .
