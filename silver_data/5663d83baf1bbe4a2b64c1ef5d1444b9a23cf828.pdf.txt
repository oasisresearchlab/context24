Brief Communication 257 Importance of the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis Yvonne Vallis , Patrick Wigge * , Bruno Marks * , Philip R . Evans and Harvey T . McMahon The GTPase dynamin plays an essential role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 1 – 3 ] . Substantial evidence suggests that dynamin oligomerisation around the necks of endocytosing vesicles and subsequent dynamin - catalysed GTP hydrolysis is responsible for membrane fission [ 4 , 5 ] . The pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of dynamin has previously been shown to interact with phosphoinositides , but it has not been determined whether this interaction is essential for dynamin’s function in endocytosis [ 6 – 9 ] . In this study , we address the in vivo function of the PH domain of dynamin by assaying the effects of deletions and point mutations in this region on transferrin uptake in COS - 7 fibroblasts . Overexpression of a dynamin construct lacking its entire PH domain potently blocked transferrin uptake , as did overexpression of a dynamin construct containing a mutation in the first variable loop of the PH domain . Structural modelling of this latter mutant suggested that the lysine residue at position 535 ( Lys535 ) may be critical in the coordination of phosphoinositides , and indeed , the purified mutant no longer interacted with lipid nanotubes . Interestingly , the inhibitory phenotype of cells expressing this dynamin mutant was partially relieved by a second mutation in the carboxy - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) , one that prevents dynamin from binding to the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of amphiphysin . These data demonstrate that dynamin’s interaction with phosphoinositides through its PH domain is essential for endocytosis . These findings also support our hypothesis that PRD – SH3 domain interactions are important in the recruitment of dynamin to sites of endocytosis .

There is general agreement that the PH domain can interact with phospho - inositides including phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 14 ] . But , there is a lack of correlation between the phosphoinositide binding of PH - domain mutants and their ability to inhibit rapid endocytosis when injected into chromaffin cells [ 14 , 15 ] . Dynamin mutants ( Figure 1a ) were screened for their ability to inhibit trans - ferrin uptake in a well established endocytosis assay [ 16 – 18 ] . Expression of a dynamin mutant containing a dele - tion of the entire PH domain ( dynamin D PH ) blocked trans - ferrin uptake in 88 ± 5 % of cells ( Figure 1b , lower panels ) . It is striking that even weakly expressing cells , such as the one on the left - hand side of the lower panels in Figure 1b , showed reduced endocytosis . Cells overexpressing wild - type dynamin did not show any reduction in transferrin uptake ( Figure 1b , upper panels ) . Lys535 is a crucial residue for the in vivo function of dynamin The deletion of the entire PH domain from its internal position in dynamin has multiple effects on dynamin func - tion ( see Figure 1c and Supplementary material published with this paper on the internet ) . More specific PH - domain mutations that would affect only phosphoinositide binding were therefore designed on the basis of structure . The dynamin PH - domain structure ( Figure 1d ) consists of an electrostatically polarised , seven - stranded b sandwich , with three variable loops opposite a carboxy - terminal a helix [ 12 ] . By superimposing this structure upon the struc - ture of the phospholipase C d ( PLC d ) PH domain com - plexed with its inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) ligand [ 19 ] — and making the assumption that the IP 3 ligand would adopt the same binding conformation in the dynamin PH domain as it does in PLC d — we were able to identify candidate residues for point mutagenesis . As shown in Figure 1d , Lys535 comes into close proximity to the 5 ¢ phosphate of the inositol ring . An adjacent residue , Gly532 , previously implicated in dynamin - 1 PH - domain function [ 15 ] , was mutated to serine , and the Lys535 residue mutated to alanine , creating a double mutant ( G532S , K535A ) called Mut1 . These residues were also mutated singly and the mutants called Mut2 and Mut3 , respectively ( Figure 1a ) . Two additional lysines in the second variable loop were also mutated singly ( Mut4 and Mut5 ) ; these residues are situated further away from the modelled IP 3 ligand ( Figure 1d ) . Mut1 , unlike dyna - min D PH , interacted normally with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin ( Figure 1c ) . Each of these five point mutants was tested for its ability to inhibit transferrin uptake ( Figure 2a , b ) . Mut1 potently inhibited endocytosis with 78 ± 3 % of cells showing undetectable levels of transferrin staining ( Figure 2b ) . The Lys535 single mutant , Mut3 , produced a similar block , suggesting that the Gly532 residue that was also mutated in Mut1 is not important for endocytosis . This was confirmed by the finding that cells expressing Mut2 showed normal transferrin uptake ( Figure 2b ) . The lysine mutations in Mut4 and Mut5 , and also two tyro - sine mutations ( Y596F and Y599F ) in the third variable loop , had no effect on transferrin uptake ( Figure 2a and Supplementary material ) . Mut1 dynamin cannot interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lipid nanotubes and has no lipid - activated GTPase activity To verify whether the inhibitory effect of Mut1 is due to an alteration in phospholipid binding , wild - type and Mut1 dynamins were expressed in COS cells and purified from COS cell lysates using the amphiphysin - 2 SH3 domain as an affinity ligand [ 20 ] . Each dynamin was then incubated with lipid nanotubes containing 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 21 ] . The ability of dynamin to cosediment with lipid nanotubes was then assayed by ultracentrifugation followed by SDS – PAGE and Coomassie staining ( Figure 2c ) , and , in parallel , its ability to hydrolyse GTP , an activity that is strongly activated by lipid binding [ 6 , 21 , 22 ] , was measured by thin - layer chromatography ( Figure 2d ) . These results show that Mut1 dynamin , in contrast to wild type , did not bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and , con - sistent with this , its GTPase activity ( measured under conditions of physiological salt concentration ) was inhib - ited to background levels ( Figure 2d ) . Mutating Lys535 alone ( Mut3 ) produced the same effect , whereas the single Gly532 substitution ( Mut2 ) showed normal lipid binding and GTPase activity ( Figures 2c , d ) . Sedimenta - tion experiments in which dynamin multimerisation was assayed in low ionic strength buffer demonstrated normal oligomerisation of Mut1 dynamin ( data not shown ) ; there - fore , the inability of this mutant to support activated GTP hydrolysis reflects its greatly reduced phospholipid - binding properties . The inability of Mut1 dynamin to interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 confirms the modelling predictions that key basic residues in the first variable loop ( notably Lys535 ) are essential for binding to the phosphates of the inositol head group . This is consistent with previous mutagenesis studies on the isolated PH domain [ 9 ] . Although the mutagenesis experiments argue that phosphoinositides constitute important ligands for dynamin in vivo , the data do not exclude the possibility that additional ligands for this PH domain ( such as G protein bg subunits [ 23 – 25 ] ) may exist . 258 Current Biology , Vol 9 No 5 Figure 1 PH - domain mutants .

The IP 3 ligand is shown in a position taken from the structure of its complex with the PH domain of PLC d - 1 ( PDB code 1MAI [ 19 ] ) , after superimposing the b - sheet strands of the two structures . Note that the position is very approximate , because the binding loops have very different conformations in the two structures .

To further test this hypothesis , the amphiphysin - binding site in dynamin , PSRPNR [ 20 , 28 ] ( in the single - letter amino - acid code ) was mutated to PSRPNE . The resulting point mutant , Mut6 , was expressed in COS cells , and binding studies with various SH3 domains revealed that the interac - tion with amphiphysin is selectively abolished ( Figure 2e ) . No detectable reduction in transferrin uptake was observed in cells expressing Mut6 , however ( Figure 2a ) . This lack of a dominant - negative effect is consistent with previous experiments in which truncation of the dynamin carboxyl terminus had no effect on endocytosis [ 16 , 29 ] . We specu - late that Mut6 dynamin either is recruited by virtue of its dimerisation with endogenous dynamin and functions nor - mally or is not recruited to endocytosis zones , remaining inactive in the cytosol . A further mutant of dynamin , Mut7 , that contains the PH - domain mutations of Mut1 and the amphiphysin - binding - site mutation of Mut6 , was made . In contrast to Mut1 , transferrin uptake occurred in the majority of cells ( 65 ± 4 % ) expressing Mut7 ( Figure 2b ) , although uptake per cell was reduced and the perinuclear staining observed was less pronounced than in control cells ( Figure 2a ) . The rescue of the Mut1 phenotype by the addition of the PRD mutation may be due to prevention of targeting of mutant dynamin to sites where it exerts its dominant - negative effect . This proposal is in agreement with the hypothesis that amphiphysin recruits dynamin to sites of endocytosis in vivo . To summarise , mutagenesis of Lys535 in the first variable loop of dynamin is sufficient to abolish phosphoinositide binding and to exert a dominant - negative effect on endocy - tosis . Our data provide direct evidence for the physiological role of the dynamin PH domain in binding to membrane lipids . We suggest that amphiphysin targets dynamin to the clathrin - coated pit through SH3 domain – PRD interactions ; dynamin then binds to phosphoinositides through Lys535 , an interaction that is essential for its subsequent collaring of nascent clathrin - coated vesicles . While this manuscript was under review , another paper describing the importance of dynamin’s PH domain in receptor - mediated endocytosis was published by Achiriloaie et al . [ 30 ] .

[ 31 ] , in which the dimethyl formamide ( DMF ) has been omitted and instead the lipids have been extruded through a filter of pore size 0 . 2 m m . The lipid composition was 40 % phosphatidylcholine , 40 % non - hydroxy fatty acid galactocerebrosides ( NFA - GalCer ) , 10 % cholesterol , 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . These gave nanotubes of average diameter 28 nm and average length 500 nm . Purification of dynamin mutants Five dishes ( 90 mm ) of COS cells transfected with plasmids express - ing each of the mutant versions of dynamin were harvested after 3 days by scraping into buffer A ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail ) containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 60 , 000 rpm for 20 min . A glu - tathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein of the amphiphysin2 SH3 domain , purified on glutathione – agarose beads , was incubated for 1 h with the clarified extract . After washing the beads extensively three times in buffer A , purified dynamin was eluted with elution buffer ( 1 . 2 M NaCl , 20 mM PIPES pH 6 . 2 , 1 mM DTT ) . For sedimentation and GTPase assays , this eluate was diluted eightfold into 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and prespun at 60 , 000 rpm , to give a final dynamin concentra - tion in the range of 0 . 5 – 1 m M .

Evans and Harvey T . McMahon Current Biology 1 March 1999 , 9 : 257 – 260 S1 Supplementary results Studies of the dynamin PH - domain deletion construct The dominant - negative effect of relatively low levels of dynamin D PH expression on endocytosis is probably due to its increased tendency to participate in dynamin – dynamin interactions ( thus effectively sequestering endogenous dynamin more efficiently than any of the point mutants ) . It is clear that this protein cannot bind lipid nanotubes , an interaction that requires the PH domain . But two lines of evidence indicate that it has an increased ability to form multimeric complexes with other dynamin molecules : first , sedimentation assays of this mutant in the absence of a lipid template ( that is , in a necessarily low ionic strength ) show an increased proportion of dynamin D PH appearing in the pellet fraction ( Figure S1 ) ; and second , GTPase assays under identical conditions revealed this greater sed - imentation to be due to the formation of at least a propor - tion of functional multimers that can hydrolyse GTP ( data not shown ) . Although dynamin’s GTPase activity is much lower in the absence of lipid nanotubes , this experiment showed a higher rate of hydrolysis for dynamin D PH than for wild - type , Mut2 or Mut3 constructs . These data raise the possibility that the deletion of dynamin’s PH domain in some way improves the accessi - bility of its GED region ( and / or other domains responsi - ble for dynamin – dynamin interactions ) such that dynamin’s oligomerisation state is shifted in favour of multimeric forms , be they higher - order ring structures , or possibly tetramers . This hypothesis would explain why amphiphysin binding to dynamin D PH is selectively reduced ( Figure 1c ) . Although SH3 domains of spectrin and Grb2 do not affect dynamin’s monomer – multimer equilibrium ( that is , they bind equally well to either form of the dynamin mole - cule ) , there is good evidence that SH3 domains of amphiphysin cannot bind to the multimeric form [ S1 ] . The data also predict that transfection of such a dynamin D PH construct into COS cells will be even better at sequestering endogenous dynamin into inactive multi - mers than any of the point mutants . Thus , dynamin D PH potently inhibits endocytosis , more so than the double - point mutant Mut1 . Whatever the exact reason for the potent dominant - negative effect of dynamin D PH , we pursued a more refined analysis of the function of dynam - in’s PH domain by point mutagenesis . Morphology of cells expressing dynamin DD PH One feature of the cells transfected with constructs that inhibit binding to phosphoinositides was that they tended to form clusters on the coverslip , reminiscent of clonal colonies , and displayed a loss of contact inhibition com - pared with control cells . We speculate that this may be due to failure to endocytose activated growth factor recep - tors , leading to constituitive signalling and a loss of control of proliferation . Studies of tyrosine mutants Immunofluorescence images of COS cells transfected with point mutants Y596F and Y599F are shown in Figure S2 . These mutants serve as negative controls and are poten - tially important residues in the third variable loop ; the lack of an inhibitory effect ( Figure S2 ) argues that the tyrosines mutated are not crucial for endocytosis in vivo . Supplementary materials and methods Site - directed mutagenesis Bovine dynamin I ( pCMV96 - 1a , from T . C . Südhof , Dallas ) was used as a template for reverse and forward 20mer PCR primers incorporating Supplementary material Figure S1 Oligomerisation assay for mutant dynamins . Wild - type and mutant versions of dynamin were purified from COS cells and assembly was tested in low ionic strength buffer in the absence of a lipid template .

After 10 cycles the product was digested for 1 h with Dpn I and transformed into bacteria for plasmid preparation . Plasmids were checked by sequencing using the Big Dye terminator kit ( ABI ) . The various mutants made are illustrated in Figure 1a . Transient transfection of COS - 7 cells COS - 7 cells plated onto 10 cm dishes were transfected using DEAE – dextran and chloroquine , followed by glycerol shock , according to the following brief description . Cells were plated 24 h prior to trans - fection ( day 0 ) at a density of 1 . 4 · 10 5 cells / ml ( 10 6 cells in 7 ml normal DMEM medium ) . On day 1 , plasmid DNA to be transfected ( 2 . 2 m g per dish ) was mixed gently for 5 min with DEAE – dextran ( 80 m l of a 5 mg / ml stock freshly prepared in sterile water ) . The DNA – dextran complexes formed were then diluted by the addition of 550 m l 2 · Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) and 418 m l water per dish to be transfected . All 1 ml was then applied to the dish of cells seeded the previous day , washed twice beforehand in 1 · TBS . Dishes were incubated for 30 min in a 37°C incubator containing 5 % CO 2 . DNA - containing solution was aspirated , and 10 ml DMEM containing 0 . 1 mM chloroquine added ( 100 · stock freshly made up from 7 mg solid and 1 . 5 ml medium ) . After incubation for 3 h at 37°C , cells were washed twice in 1 · TBS and glycerol - shocked by incubating with 20 % glycerol in DMEM for 4 min at room tempera - ture . After gently aspirating and gently washing twice in 1 · TBS , cells were left to recover in 7 ml DMEM at 37°C . In experiments involving bio - chemical analysis , cells were left for 48 – 60 h before harvesting in lysis buffer ( buffer A ; 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail plus 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . For immunofluores - cence analysis of transfected cells , however , they were left for only 18 h before replating onto poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips . Transferrin uptake assays and immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were incubated 18 h after replating onto poly - L - lysine - coated cov - erslips ( 36 h post - transfection ) at 37°C in serum - free DMEM for 1 h , then at 37°C in DMEM containing 25 m g / ml biotinylated human transfer - rin ( Sigma ) . After washing three times in phosphate - buffered saline at room temperature ( to reduce surface and non - specific labelling ) , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilised with 0 . 2 % saponin , and blocked in 10 % goat serum . Transferrin uptake was visualised with FITC - conjugated streptavidin and dynamin with the polyclonal antibody D632 . Secondary antibodies were Texas Red - conjugated goat anti - rabbit for dynamin . Coverslips were mounted under AIRWOL plus 1 % DABCO and cells imaged on an MRC 1024 scanning confocal micro - scope . For bar chart quantitation , ‘blocked cells’ were defined as all transfected cells in which transferrin uptake was < 20 % of normal . These cells were counted and divided by the total number of trans - fected cells ( in multiple fields ) , and extent of inhibition thus expressed as a percentage . Similarly , cells ‘rescued’ in endocytosis were defined as all those cells in which transferrin was internalised to levels of at least 30 % of normal . SEMs were calculated from the results of at least three independent experiments . Dynamin GTPase assays All GTPase assays were performed at room temperature . Nanotubes ( 0 . 1 mM lipid ) and dynamin ( typically 0 . 02 m M ) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in buffer B ( 135 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) and then reactions ( in 20 m l ) were initi - ated by the addition of GTP ( to 25 m M ) and 10 m Ci / ml [ a - 32 P ] GTP . Hydrolysis of GTP was analysed by thin - layer chromatography on PEI cellulose ( Sigma ) and the results were quantitated using a phosphoim - ager and ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Dynamin sedimentation assays Purified dynamin ( 0 . 02 m M ) was self - assembled in vitro by incubation for 20 min in either low ionic strength buffer ( for the formation of ring structures in the absence of a lipid template ) or in 135 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 20 mM HEPES and 1 mM MgCl 2 ; to each mixture 1 mM lipid nan - otubes plus 0 . 1 mM nucleotide ( for the formation of ring structures in more physiological conditions , around a membrane template ) was added . Multimerised dynamin was then sedimented by ultracentrifuga - tion at 80 , 000 · g for 20 min . The extent of self - assembly was assayed S2 Supplementary material Figure S2 Tyrosine mutations in the third variable loop of the PH domain of dynamin do not affect transferrin uptake . Y596 and Y599 were mutated singly and in combination . Dynamin is stained red ; transferrin is stained green . The absence of an effect on transferrin uptake argues against an important role for these mutants in lipid binding .
