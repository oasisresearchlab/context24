Fibroblasts , a product of EMT , can be reset into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) via exog - enous transcription factors but the underlying mech - anism is unclear . Here we show that the generation of iPSCs from mouse ﬁbroblasts requires a mesen - chymal - to - epithelial transition ( MET ) orchestrated by suppressing pro - EMT signals from the culture medium and activating an epithelial program inside the cells . At the transcriptional level , Sox2 / Oct4 suppress the EMT mediator Snail , c - Myc downregu - lates TGF - b 1 and TGF - b receptor 2 , and Klf4 induces epithelial genes including E - cadherin . Blocking MET impairs the reprogramming of ﬁbroblasts whereas preventing EMT in epithelial cells cultured with serum can produce iPSCs without Klf4 and c - Myc . Our work not only establishes MET as a key cellular mecha - nism toward induced pluripotency , but also demon - strates iPSC generation as a cooperative process between the deﬁned factors and the extracellular milieu . INTRODUCTION The direct reprogramming of somatic cells to an embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) - like state by deﬁned factors is an approach commonly known as iPS ( Takahashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ) . This technology is devoid of ethical concerns and can produce pluripotent stem cells from an individual that are compatible with his / her own immune system . Compared to somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) ( Wilmut et al . , 1997 ) , iPS not only has solved a technical hurdle but also offers a unique experimental system to investi - gate key questions regarding cell fate determination and epige - netic regulation . iPSC generation is viewed as a multiple - step course of action mediated by transcription factors that progres - sively induce the expression of ESC - like genes and suppress the somatic cell genetic program ( Brambrink et al . , 2008 ) . Because the appearance of iPSCs takes at least 12 – 24 days and is very inefﬁcient , nuclear reprogramming is considered a stochastic process in which successive barriers must be overcome to reach a state toward pluripotency ( Hanna et al . , 2009b ; Yamanaka , 2009 ) , but the nature of these barriers is poorly understood . Remarkably , a series of compounds including TGF - b ( transform - ing growth factor b ) inhibitors have been identiﬁed that accel - erate or improve the reprogramming ( Esteban et al . , 2010 ; Huangfu et al . , 2008 ; Ichida et al . , 2009 ; Maherali and Hochedlin - ger , 2009 ; Mikkelsen et al . , 2008 ) , and this may shed light into the putative reprogramming roadblocks . One of the ﬁrst noticeable changes during the reprogramming of ﬁbroblasts is their transformation into tightly packed clusters of rounded cells in a process that resembles a MET ( Qin et al . , 2007 ; Takahashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ) , the opposite of EMT . During development , EMT events occur as early as gastrulation and are frequent afterwards , for example in the delamination of the neural crest ( Thiery et al . , 2009 ) . EMT consists of coordinated changes in cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions that lead to loss of epithelial features and acquisition of mesenchymal character - istics . A previous analysis has estimated that EMT changes the expression of about 4000 genes ( (cid:2) 10 % of the human genome ) ( Zavadil et al . , 2001 ) , with two genes reproducibly changed in all forms of EMT : E - cadherin ( downregulated ) and Snail ( upregu - lated ) . Snail is a basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor that binds to speciﬁc cognate sequences termed E - boxes and represses the transcription of E - cadherin and other key epithelial regulators ( Batlle et al . , 2000 ; Cano et al . , 2000 ; Nieto , 2002 ) . E - cadherin is a transmembrane constituent of intercellular adhe - rens junctions responsible for maintaining epithelial cohesion ( Cavallaro and Christofori , 2004 ) and has also been linked to the control of ESC pluripotency ( Chou et al . , 2008 ; Soncin et al . , 2009 ) . Here we demonstrate that the exogenous reprog - ramming factors activate an epithelial program and shut down key mesenchymal genes to overcome the EMT epigenetic barrier of ﬁbroblasts and allow their successful reprogramming into pluripotent stem cells . RESULTS The Reprogramming of Fibroblasts Starts with a MET Morphological differences between elongated ﬁbroblasts and mouse ESCs are profound ( Figure 1A ) .

Cell Stem Cell A MET Is Needed for Somatic Cell Reprogramming 52 Cell Stem Cell 7 , 51 – 63 , July 2 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . we observed that mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) undergo epithelial - like morphological changes around day 5 . This promp - ted us to characterize at the molecular level the early events that accompany the generation of iPSCs from mouse ﬁbroblasts , aiming to demonstrate the existence of a MET ( Figure S1A avail - able online ) . MEFs containing a transgenic Oct4 promoter that expresses GFP ( green ﬂuorescent protein ) ( Silva et al . , 2008 ) were transduced with combined retroviruses producing SKOM ( Sox2 , Klf4 , Oct4 , and c - Myc ) or SKO ( same without c - Myc ) tran - scription factors . We took phase - contrast photographs at days 5 and 8 postinfection ( Figure 1B ) and performed immunoﬂuores - cence microscopy for E - cadherin , b - catenin , pan - cytokeratin ( cytokeratins are highly expressed in epithelia ) , and actin ( Fig - ure 1C ) . For comparisons , immunoﬂuorescence of uninfected mammary epithelial cells ( MECs ) and MEFs , iPSCs , and R1 mouse ESCs is provided in Figure S1B . MEFs undergoing reprogramming became rounded and aggregated with quicker kinetics in SKOM than SKO ( Figure 1B ) . They also formed well - deﬁned epithelial - like intercellular junctions and displayed increased cytokeratin starting at day 5 postinfection ( Figure 1C ) . These epithelial - like clusters appeared before the ESC antigen SSEA - 1 could be detected , as shown by the comparison between SKOM and SKO ( Figure 1C ) . Western blot analysis vali - dated the increase in E - cadherin and showed a concomitant reduction of the mesenchymal - like marker ﬁbronectin ( Fn ) and the transcriptional repressor Snail ( Figure 1D ) . Real - time RT - PCR analysis ( qPCR ) of three independent SKOM time - course experiments showed increased mRNA for multiple cell - cell adhesion proteins ( E - cadherin , epithelial - cell adhesion molecule or Ep - CAM , and diverse desmosomal and tight junction constit - uents ) and cytokeratins , and reduced mRNA for mesenchymal markers ( Fn and N - cadherin ) , a panel of transcriptional repres - sors including Snail and Slug , and cell - matrix adhesion genes ( Figure 1E ; Figure S1C ) . SKOM factors also induced rapid down - regulation of the microRNAs miR - 155 and miR - 10b , which have been associated with EMT ( Kong et al . , 2008 ; Ma et al . , 2007 ) , and upregulation ( albeit more delayed ) of miR - 205 and - 429 ( Figure 1F ; Gregory et al . , 2008 ; Park et al . , 2008 ) , which have the opposite role . These microRNAs were studied on the basis of high levels of expression in MECs , iPSCs , and mouse ESCs , compared to MEFs ( Figure S1D ) . These comprehensive pheno - typic changes in MEFs undergoing reprogramming had func - tional repercussions as well , as demonstrated by incomplete gap closure after wound healing and reduced invasion of Matri - gel - coated transwell ﬁlters ( Figures S1E and S1F ) . Comparable changes in cell morphology and in the expression of selected EMT / MET target genes were observed after transduction of adult mammary ﬁbroblasts ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the reprogramming of mouse ﬁbroblasts initiates with a bona ﬁde process of MET that occurs before the acquisition of ESC - like characteristics . TGF - b Prevents MET and Blunts the Reprogramming We next studied whether the observed MET is a consequence or is required for the formation of iPSCs . TGF - b was recently described to block nuclear reprogramming ( Maherali and Hochedlinger , 2009 ) and is a well - known EMT inducer that acts at least in part through activation of Snail ( Peinado et al . , 2003 ) . We added TGF - b 1 to MEFs undergoing reprogramming and observed that it inhibited the upregulation of epithelial markers and the downregulation of Snail ( but not Slug ) as measured by qPCR at day 6 postinfection ( Figure 2A ) ; another TGF - b family constituent , Activin A , did not have any effect . TGF - b 1 and overexpression of Snail also prevented the assem - bly of intercellular junctions as analyzed at day 6 ( Figure 2B ; data not shown ) and inhibited the formation of alkaline phosphatase - positive ( AP + ) colonies by (cid:2) 40 % to 70 % measured at days 14 ( SKOM ) and 25 ( SKO ) ( Figure 2C , upper panel ) . Besides , the remaining AP + colonies were ﬁbroblastic rather than ESC - like ( Figure 2D ) . TGF - b 2 ( Maherali and Hochedlinger , 2009 ) and TGF - b 3 blunted AP + colony formation as well , but overexpres - sion of Slug did not have any effect ( Figure 2C ) . The latter indi - cates speciﬁcity and is consistent with Snail and Slug sharing functions in some settings but not in others ( Coˆme et al . , 2006 ) . Although AP staining is a not - stringent - enough criterion to indicate pluripotency ( Brambrink et al . , 2008 ; Silva et al . , 2008 ) , these experiments show that TGF - b and Snail mostly abort the reprogramming at an early stage . In SKO - infected MEFs , we also observed that on average 6 – 12 colonies became GFP + ( indicative of full reprogramming ) by day 25 compared to few or none in cells treated with TGF - b cytokines or overexpress - ing Snail ( Figure 2C , lower panel and Figure 3F ) . Appearance of GFP + colonies in SKOM - infected MEFs required overgrowth of cells beyond day 20 , or secondary splitting , and the frequency was similar to other studies ( 0 . 1 % of the original population [ Nakagawa et al . , 2008 ] ) . However , colonies produced with SKOM plus TGF - b or Snail remained mostly GFP (cid:3) after multiple passages ( data not shown ) . We observed reduced cell number in SKOM - ( at day 6 ) or SKO - ( at day 9 ) infected MEFs treated with TGF - b cytokines , and it is now known that proliferation is needed for the acquisition of stochastic epigenetic changes during reprogramming ( Hanna et al . , 2009b ) . But reduced proliferation in the presence of TGF - b may , if anything , only partially explain the effect on iPSC colony formation , as for example Snail increased rather than decreased the cell number ( Figure S2 ) . We also performed DNA microarray analysis of reprogramming MEFs ( at day 10 ) cultured with TGF - b 1 or coexpressing Snail compared to the control , which showed profound transcriptomic changes ( Table S1 ) . The set of genes differentially modulated by TGF - b 1 and Snail mostly distributed into KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) pathways related to cell - cell adhesion and the interaction with the extracellular matrix ( Table S1 ) . Taken together our experiments suggest that MET is needed for the reprogramming of ﬁbroblasts into iPSCs . The Yamanaka Factors Suppress EMT by Blocking TGF - b Signaling One of the main concerns over iPSC technology is that the reprogramming efﬁciency is very low ( Silva et al . , 2008 ) . We speculated that high levels of pro - EMT cytokines such as TGF - b contained in serum or secreted by ﬁbroblasts might impair the reprogramming by counteracting MET . To assess this , we quan - tiﬁed TGF - b cytokines in our iPSC culture system by using ELISA and found that two different batches of ESC - deﬁned fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) contained signiﬁcant amounts of TGF - b 1 and 2 ( Figure 3A ) but no TGF - b 3 ( data not shown ) . We also noticed that the starting MEFs and the feeder cells produced abundant TGF - b 1 , very low TGF - b 2 ( Figure 3A ) , and no TGF - b 3 ( data not Cell Stem Cell A MET Is Needed for Somatic Cell Reprogramming Cell Stem Cell 7 , 51 – 63 , July 2 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 53 shown ) . Interestingly , the reprogramming factors progressively reduced the secretion of TGF - b 1 in the conditioned medium of SKOM - transduced MEFs , and TGF - b 2 increased but levels were extremely low ( Figure 3B ) . Supporting the ELISA data , TGF - b 1 mRNA ( and TGF - b 3 ) diminished in SKOM since early time points postinfection , while TGF - b 2 mRNA was increased ( Figure 3C ) . TGF - b cytokines bind to TGF - b receptor 2 ( TGF - b R2 ) , which then recruits TGF - b R1 and this triggers autophos - phorylation ( Shi and Massague´ , 2003 ) and a signaling cascade that ultimately activates Snail ; TGF - b receptor 3 ( TGF - b R3 ) acts as a coreceptor . TGF - b R2 and TGF - b R3 mRNAs were quickly reduced by the exogenous factors but TGF - b R1 remained rela - tively unchanged ( Figure 3C ) . TGF - b 1 , TGF - b 3 , TGF - b R2 , and TGF - b R3 were very low in R1 ESCs and iPSCs compared to MEFs , possibly explaining whyprolonged culture in the presence of serum or added TGF - b 1 cannot induce their differentiation ( Figures S3A – S3C ) . Next , we analyzed the contribution of each reprogramming factor to the above - mentioned transcriptional alterations of TGF - b signaling constituents and EMT / MET - related genes , for which we expressed the four Yamanaka factors individually and compared their effect with the SKOM and SKO cocktails . Sox2 and Oct4 suppressed TGF - b R3 , Oct4 and Klf4 suppressed TGF - b 3 , and c - Myc suppressed TGF - b 1 and TGF - b R2 ( Fig - ure 3D ) , TGF - b 2 mRNA was modestly upregulated by Sox2 and Klf4 , and none of the factors could independently downre - gulate TGF - b R1 ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that SKO factors are less effective in producing iPSCs than SKOM because without c - Myc the TGF - b pathway is not efﬁciently shut down . Supporting this , coexpression of TGF - b receptors 1 - 3 in SKOM - infected MEFs reduced the number of AP + colo - nies as efﬁciently as a constitutively active form of TGF - b R1 ( T204D ) ( Figure 3E ) and picked colonies did not turn GFP + after multiple passages compared to the control ( data not shown ) . This is consistent with whole - genome ChIP - on - Chip analysis in the study by Sridharan et al . ( 2009 ) that shows a pattern of histone modiﬁcations for the TGF - b R2 promoter indicative of sustained active transcription in pre - iPSCs compared to iPSCs .

We also detected that incompletely reprogrammed GFP (cid:3) pre - iPSC clones retain high mRNA levels of TGF - b 1 and TGF - b R2 , high levels of Snail and low of E - cadherin , compared to iPSCs ( Figure S3D ) . On the other hand , use of exogenous ( TGF - b receptor inhibitors or Alk5i ) or endogenous ( Smad7 ) ( Nakao et al . , 1997 ) inhibitors of TGF - b signaling improved reprogram - ming efﬁciency ( based on the number of GFP + colonies ) with SKO factors to (cid:2) 2 % of the original population ( Figure 3F ) . The effect of Alk5i was less remarkable in SKOM ( data not shown ) , in agreement with the role of c - Myc in suppressing TGF - b signaling . Alk5i or Smad7 only moderately increased cell number at day 9 ( Figure S3E ) , which points to a direct effect on the reprogramming rather than an indirect effect caused by stochastic events during cell proliferation . As described in recent reports ( Ichida et al . , 2009 ; Maherali and Hochedlinger , 2009 ) , we could generate chimera - competent iPSCs from MEFs by using Alk5i and otherwise nonproductive KOM or KO cocktails ( data not shown ) , and we saw the same coexpressing Smad7 ( Figures 3G and 3H ) . No colonies were produced when Klf4 was excluded from the retroviral cocktail . In summary , the combined action of Sox2 , Oct4 , Klf4 , and c - Myc in the recipient ﬁbroblasts downregulates TGF - b 1 secretion and signaling to prevent the self - perpetuation of EMT , and this is important for the reprogramming . E - cadherin Is Required for Reprogramming Overexpressing the exogenous factors individually , we also observed that Sox2 and Oct4 downregulate Snail mRNA but not Slug ( Figure 4A ) , thereby providing an additional way to shut down EMT during reprogramming . Interestingly , Klf4 potently induced E - cadherin mRNA ( more than 200 - fold on average ) and other epithelial markers as well ( Figure 4B ) . Upre - gulation of E - cadherin by Klf4 was veriﬁed with western blot , and Sox2 , Oct4 , and Klf4 reduced Snail with the same assay ( Figure 4C ) . This latter effect of Klf4 possibly reﬂects modulation of Snail protein stability ( Zhou et al . , 2004 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy further conﬁrmed the increase in E - cadherin trig - gered by Klf4 ( Figure 4D ) , while bona ﬁde Klf4 binding sites in the E - cadherin promoter were demonstrated with chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) and semiquantitative RT - PCR ( Fig - ure 4E ) . Given that E - cadherin is an important regulator of epithe - lial homeostasis ( Cavallaro and Christofori , 2004 ) and has been linked to mouse ESC pluripotency ( Chou et al . , 2008 ; Soncin et al . , 2009 ) , we next studied whether knocking down E - cadherin expression would blunt iPS by preventing MET . For this we used three different sets of retroviruses producing speciﬁc shRNA hairpins ( Figure 5A ) . The reprogramming was performed in the presence of vitamin C in order to increase the number of GFP + colonies and hence magnify differences ( Esteban et al . , 2010 ) . The formation of AP + colonies did not change after knocking down E - cadherin , but the resulting clones were mostly GFP (cid:3) and ﬁbroblastic ( Figures 5B and 5C ) and resembled those produced with TGF - b 1 or Snail ( see Figure 2 ) . The few remaining GFP + colonies ( hereafter named shECAD colonies ) displayed a more loose 2D morphology than the control , and three colonies of each group were picked and expanded for further character - ization ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . shECAD colonies were SSEA - 1 posi - tive , expressed similar levels of endogenous Oct4 and Nanog as the controls ( Figures 5E and 5F ) , and had silenced the transgenes ( data not shown ) . Moreover , they displayed increased levels of N - cadherin and reduced expression of the pluripotent genes Lefty1 , Sox2 , and Klf4 ( Figure 5F ) . The differ - entiation markers Cer1 , Sox17 , and Fgf5 , which are expressed in epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) and the more recently described FAB - SCs ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) , were also increased in shECAD cells compared to the controls ( Figure 5F ) . FAB - SCs were derived from mouse blastocysts via bFGF , Activin A , and the GSK3 b inhibitor BIO , and share many characteristics of EpiSCs but are not the same entity . Notably , their phenotype is at least in part due to reduced E - cadherin expression . The ability of shECAD cell lines 4 and 8 to form chimeras was strikingly reduced compared to the controls ( Figure 5G ) . shECAD 9 cells expressed higher residual levels of E - cadherin ( mRNA and protein ) ( Figure 5D ; Table S2C ) and could still produce chimeras with high frequency but without germline contribution ( Fig - ure 5G ) . Differences in E - cadherin expression between shECAD cell lines are probably reﬂection of different number of shRNA retroviral insertions into the genome and / or their speciﬁc location . Nevertheless , DNA microarrays showed signiﬁcant changes in gene expression in all three shECAD cell lines relative to the controls , including reduced expression of germline - related genes like Dazl ( Figure S4 and Tables S2A and S2B ; Lin et al . , 2008 ) . Stella ( Dppa3 ) , a germline - related gene used to differen - tiate mouse ESCs from EpiSCs ( Bao et al . , 2009 ) , was not changed ( Figure 5F ) . Differentially expressed genes between shECAD cell lines and the controls also displayed an enriched distribution in pathways related to focal adhesions , actin cyto - skeleton , the extracellular matrix , and the TGF - b pathway ( Table S2C ) . The latter suggests that shECAD cell lines may retain the ability to respond to pro - EMT signals triggered by TGF - b in the culture medium . In summary , Klf4 induces an epithelial program during the reprogramming of mouse ﬁbro - blasts , and in the absence of adequate levels of E - cadherin , a stable ground condition of ‘‘near pluripotency’’ is established that differs from EpiSCs and is more similar to FAB - SC cells . Inducing MET Enhances Reprogramming Next , we hypothesized that using epithelial cells as a starting population would improve iPSC generation by circumventing the need to switch off the EMT state characteristic of ﬁbroblasts . Indeed , it has been reported that human epithelial cells such as keratinocytes or hair follicle cells reprogram with higher efﬁciency than ﬁbroblasts ( Aasen et al . , 2008 ) , for which the authors used a low - serum protocol in order to prevent cell differ - entiation . We used epithelial cells from the mammary gland ( MECs ) , a widely used model for studying EMT ( Mani et al . , 2008 ) . MECs had to be cultured in low serum to prevent EMT ( Figure 6A ; Eirew et al . , 2008 ) , and this culture condition produced signiﬁcantly more GFP + colonies than using ﬁbro - blasts and a full serum protocol ( Figure 6B ) . Addition of Alk5i to MECs cultured with serum also prevented EMT and generated GFP + iPSC colonies with high efﬁciency ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . Interestingly , we observed that MECs express high endogenous levels of the complementary factor Klf4 , which quickly dimin - ished in the presence of serum unless the cells were treated with Alk5i ( Figure 6C ) . Consistent with a major role of Klf4 during the reprogramming being the induction of MET , and because epithelial cells don’t need such transition , we could successfully Cell Stem Cell A MET Is Needed for Somatic Cell Reprogramming Cell Stem Cell 7 , 51 – 63 , July 2 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 55 128 38 27 140 0 50 100 150 200 15 % FBS Lot 1 15 % FBS Lot 2 MEF Feeder Tg f b 2 pg / m l A 2400 15 % FBS Lot 1 15 % FBS Lot 2 MEF 1600 1900 600 400 400 800120018002000 0 Tg f b 1 pg / m l Tgfb1 Tgfb2 Feeder B Control SKOM pg / Tg f b 1 μ g p r o t e i n D3 D9 D7 D5 0 4 8 12 16 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 SKOM pg / Tg f b 2 g p r o t e i n D3 D9 D7 D5 μ Tgfb1 Tgfb2 Day 5 Day 8 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 Tgfb1 Tgfb2 Tgfb3 TgfbR1 TgfbR2 TgfbR3 m RNA l eve l i n S K O M r e l a t i ve t o c on t r o l 3 . 0 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * C 1 . 0 2 . 1 0 . 5 0 . 7 2 . 2 1 . 9 1 . 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 * * * * * * MOKS OKS cyM 4tcO 4flK 2xoS Control 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 m RNA l eve l 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 6 1 . 1 5 . 4 02 4 6 8 * * * * * * 0 2 4 6 8 MOKS OKS c y M 4tcO 4flK 2xoS Control m RNA l eve l 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 7 0 . 4 1 . 0 2 . 5 0 . 5 0 1 23 45 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 7 0 . 4 1 . 0 2 . 5 0 . 5 1 23 45 m RNA l eve l MOKS OKS cyM 4tcO 4flK 2xoS Control 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 6 0 . 3 0 . 3 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 6 0 . 3 0 . 3 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 6 0 . 3 0 . 3 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 m RNA l eve l MOKS OKS cyM 4tcO 4flK 2xoS Control D * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * E SKOM Tg f b R 2 Tg f b R 1 C on t r o l Tg f b R 3 T 204 D * * * * * * * * * * * * * 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % 100 % 83 % 70 % 68 % 37 % 43 % A P + c o l on i es r e l a t i ve t o c on t r o l Tg f b R 1 + 2 + 3 F Control ALK5i N u m b e r o f c o l on i es SKO APOct4 - GFP Smad7 Tgfb1 0 40 80 120 160 60 26 104 129 5 0 64 52 Tgfb1 Tgfb3 TgfbR2 TgfbR3 G 1 . 6 1 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 4 0 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 E S C s m RNA l eve l r e l a t i ve t o m ES C s T r a n s g e n e ex p r ess i on KO + Smad7 KO + Alk5i Endo - Oct4 Endo - Sox2 Rex1Nanog Exo - Klf4 Exo - Oct4 C o n t r o l K O M + S m a d 7 K O + S m a d 7 K O + A l k 5 i KOM + Smad7 H * KO + Smad7 CM CM CM CM Control Figure 3 .

Semiquantitative RT - PCR of genomic DNA was used to detect speciﬁc transgene integration and exclude the possibility of plasmid contamination ( Figure 6D ) . These iPSC clones , and also those produced as in Figure 6B , exhibited ESC characteris - tics and were pluripotent ( Figures 6E – 6J ; Figure S5 ) . Therefore , the maintenance of an epithelial phenotype facilitates reprog - ramming and Klf4 can be omitted from the reprogramming cock - tail when epithelial cells are used as donor cells . DISCUSSION We have identiﬁed a key cellular process , MET , as an early requi - site event during the reprogramming of mouse ﬁbroblasts into iPSCs by exogenous factors . Our work also shows that somatic cell reprogramming is not merely a nuclear event but rather that it is determined by the ﬁne crosstalk between nuclear engines and the extracellular milieu .

EMT and MET are subject to regu - lation not only at the transcriptional level but also by the extracel - lular environment ( Peinado et al . , 2003 ) . Hence , pro - EMT cyto - kines in the culture medium can create an EMT - compatible situation that sustains the ﬁbroblast - like identity , prevents MET , and results in abortive reprogramming despite maintained expression of the exogenous factors inside the nuclei of infected cells . To bypass this , the exogenous factors must suppress an intrinsic barrier represented by ﬁbroblast - enriched transcription factors ( e . g . , Snail ) that preserve the mesenchymal phenotype , and another one extrinsic typiﬁed by TGF - b 1 ( and possibly other cytokines as well ) contained in the culture medium . While the nuclear engines try to eliminate the ﬁrst hurdle ( e . g . , suppressing Snail and inducing E - cadherin ) , the extracellular milieu can still derail the process by providing positive feedback on Snail , unless a TGF - b inhibitor is added . In this regard , it was reported recently that Alk5i can help maintain rat iPSCs dedifferentiated ( Li et al . , 2009 ) and improves mouse ( Ichida et al . , 2009 ; Maherali and Hochedlinger , 2009 ) and human ( Lin et al . , 2009 ) iPSC generation . These articles suggested that blockade of EMT is important for reprogramming , but no experimental proof or mechanistic insight ( apart from the involvement of Nanog [ Ichida et al . , 2009 ] ) was provided . Here we have shown that Sox2 / Oct4 and c - Myc suppress Snail and TGF - b 1 / TGF - b R2 , respectively , and Klf4 upregulates E - cadherin and other epithelial genes ( Figure 7 ) . In this context it is straightforwardly understood that Alk5i or Smad7 can substitute Sox2 and c - Myc when iPSCs are generated from ﬁbroblasts , and that Klf4 is rescindable from the reprogramming cocktail in epithelial cells .

Cell Stem Cell A MET Is Needed for Somatic Cell Reprogramming 58 Cell Stem Cell 7 , 51 – 63 , July 2 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . understanding iPSC in a cell - speciﬁc and tissue culture - speciﬁc context may lead to better practice . Additional exploration of these pathways may as well provide novel ways to improve the quality of iPSCs and / or the generation efﬁciency and perhaps facilitate the use of nonintegrating approaches . Regarding how TGF - b and Snail ultimately exerts their effects , this may involve several targets but a critical step is downregula - tion of E - cadherin . Snail is needed for EMT during gastrulation ( Carver et al . , 2001 ; Murray and Gridley , 2006 ) and its overex - pression induces ESC differentiation ( Ivanova et al . , 2006 ) . On the other hand , E - cadherin knockout mice do not proceed beyond the epiblast stage ( Larue et al . , 1994 ) and a number of reports have linked this molecule to pluripotency ( Chou et al . , 2008 ; Soncin et al . , 2009 ) . For example , FAB - SCs ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) and E - cadherin (cid:3) / (cid:3) mouse ESCs ( Soncin et al . , 2009 ) are trapped in a semipluripotent state that shares similarities with EpiSCs ( Bao et al . , 2009 ) including the failure to form chimeric mice . It is therefore not surprising that mouse ESC differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming converge in the same cross - road represented by E - cadherin . As for how E - cadherin knock - down blocks reprogramming , this does not seem to involve b - catenin signaling ( Clevers , 2006 ) because this molecule is well conﬁned to intercellular junctions in shECAD iPSC clones ( see Figure 5E ) possibly through interaction with N - cadherin . Moreover , we did not see any effect when b - catenin was coex - pressed with SKO or SKOM in MEFs ( data not shown ) , and in the original description by Yamanaka ( Takahashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ) , b - catenin moderately enhanced iPSC generation . Instead , E - cadherin may regulate pluripotency by ensuring that fully compacted cells have access to putative critical autocrine signals or by promoting cell - cell exchange of signals perhaps through gap junctions ( Houghton , 2005 ) . Because E - cadherin has also been linked to pluripotency in human ESCs ( Li et al . , 2010 ) , it is likely that its knockdown will inﬂuence as well human somatic cell reprogramming . But human ESCs rely on TGF - b signaling to maintain their characteristics ( James et al . , 2005 ) and it remains to be seen whether the epigenetic remodeling of human iPSCs generated with or without Alk5i are equivalent . Importantly , E - cadherin is not the only mechanism by which Klf4 induces reprogramming , as shown by the fact that substitu - tion of this transcription factor by E - cadherin could not produce iPSC clones in MEFs ( data not shown ) . Coexpression of E - cad - herin did not increase either the reprogramming efﬁciency of SKOM - or SKO - infected MEFs ( data not shown ) , though this could be due to quick E - cadherin upregulation after transduction with the exogenous factors . It is possible that other Klf4 - regu - lated adhesion molecules play as well a role during reprogram - ming , but redundancy may exist and for example knockout mice for tight junction molecules like Occludin or the Claudins show a milder phenotype ( Furuse , 2009 ) compared to E - cad - herin . Likewise , shRNA for Snail did not increase the efﬁciency of reprogramming in SKOM - or SKO - infected MEFs ( data not shown ) , which could imply that other transcriptional repressors ( see Figure 1C ) participate too or that rapid Snail downregulation during reprogramming does not allow further improvement . Our DNA arrays also suggest that the effects of TGF - b 1 and Snail involve the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix , but this could be a consequence and not the cause ( see Table S1 ) . Further study of how E - cadherin knockdown blocks iPSCs and a more detailed comparison between shECAD cell line EpiSCs and FAB - SCs will be relevant to understand the reprogramming process and the metastable character of ESCs ( Guo et al . , 2009 ; Hanna et al . , 2009a ) . Interestingly , EMT has been shown to induce stem cell proper - ties in mammary epithelial cells ( Mani et al . , 2008 ) , which contrasts with our results presented here but probably reﬂects that pluripotency and stemness are not the same . In any case , knowledge diverted from EMT in this or other contexts may allow better understanding of reprogramming , and the reverse situa - tion can be envisaged too . For example , TGF - b R2 is reduced in liver tumors overexpressing c - Myc ( Amicone et al . , 2002 ; Factor et al . , 1997 ) , and it is well known that epithelial cells express high levels of Klf4 ( De Craene et al . , 2005 ) . Yet , a direct link between TGF - b R2 and c - Myc or a dominant role for Klf4 in controlling epithelial characteristics had not yet been described . Interestingly , Klf4 is repressed by Snail during EMT of MECs ( De Craene et al . , 2005 ) and it is tempting to speculate that TGF - b / Snail may block nuclear reprogramming by directly preventing the activation of endogenous Klf4 and perhaps other pluripo - tency regulators as well . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture MEFs and MECs from OG2mice ( Silva etal . , 2008 ) were isolated asdescribed ( Mani et al . , 2008 ) . ESCs from OG2 mice were also isolated as described ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) and where indicated we used R1 mouse ESCs ( purchased from ATCC ) . MEFs and MECs were transduced at passage 2 or 3 with pMX - based retroviruses in 6 - well culture dishes as in previous reports ( Esteban et al . , 2010 ) . For SKOM , 2 , 000 cells were split on feeders at day 6 , for SO 20 , 000 at day 9 , and for other factor combinations 5 , 000 cells at day 9 .

TGF - b 1 - 3 and Activin A were from R & D Systems and used at 2 ng / ml and 10 ng / ml , respectively . A - 83 - 01 ( 0 . 5 m M ) was purchased from Tocris and added from day 3 to the end of the experiment except for MECs ( added since moment of derivation ) . Vitamin C was purchased from Sigma and used at 50 mg / ml from day 3 until the end of the indicated experiments . Established iPSCs used throughout as controls were produced from MEFs via SKO factors and proved to be chimera competent . Plasmids and ChIP pMX - Snail and pMX - E - cadherin were subcloned from plasmids provided by Dr . Antonio Garcia de Herreros and Dr . Masatoshi Takeichi , respectively ; pMX - Slug , TGF - b R1 - 3 , T204D ( Wieseretal . , 1995 ) , andSmad7wereprepared by ourselves with cDNA from MEFs as a template and site - directed muta - genesis ( T204D ) . All cDNAs correspond to mouse and were veriﬁed by sequencing . ELISA kits for TGF - b 1 - 3 were from R & D Systems . pRetroSuper vectors containing shRNA sequences for E - cadherin or the control ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene were also made by us ; after infection , cells were selected in puromycin for 3 days . The target sequences for Ecad - shRNA3 were GGAG ATGCAGAATAATTAT ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) , Ecad - shRNA5 GCTGGAATCTTTG TCCATGTA , and Ecad - shRNA11 GCAGGAAGAGAACATTCTA .

A Leica TCS SP2 Spectral confocal microscope was used for all immunoﬂorescence studies . qPCR was per - formed with SYBR green ( Takara ) , and samples were analyzed in triplicate and normalized on the basis of b - actin values . Sequences for these and other primers are available upon request . MicroRNAs were measured by qPCR with SYBR green as reported by others ( Chen et al . , 2005 ) . Western blotting detection was performed with ECL + ( Amersham ) . Transwell cham - bers were purchased from Millipore and stained according to the instructions by the manufacturer . Karyotyping , bisulfate sequencing , semiquantitative RT - PCR for detecting transgene integration , AP staining , teratomas , and injection of iPSCs into chimeric mice were performed like in our previous reports ( Esteban et al . , 2010 ) . DNA microarrays were performed with Gene - Chip Mouse Genome 430 2 . 0 Array ( for Figure S3B ) and MoGene 1 . 0 ST chip ( the others ) from Affymetrix . A Zeiss SteREO Lumar V12 ﬂuorescence micro - scope was used to observe GFP + germ cells in the genital ridge of embryos extracted at 13 and a half days . Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated where convenient with Student’s t test . All experiments involving animals were approved by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health review board . ACCESSION NUMBERS GEO database accession numbers are GSE15267 , GSE21062 , GSE21064 , and GSE21067 .
