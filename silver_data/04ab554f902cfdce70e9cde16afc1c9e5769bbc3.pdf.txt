Sustained motility requires rapid filament turnover and subunit recycling . The essential regulatory protein cofilin acceler - ates network remodeling by severing actin filaments and increas - ing the concentration of ends available for elongation and subunit exchange . Although cofilin effects on actin filament assembly dynamics have been extensively studied , the molecular mechanism of cofilin - induced filament severing is not understood . Here we demonstrate that actin filament severing by vertebrate cofilin is driven by the linked dissociation of a single cation that controls filament structure and mechanical properties . Vertebrate cofilin only weakly severs Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin filaments lacking this “ stiffness cation ” unless a stiffness cation - binding site is engi - neered into the actin molecule . Moreover , vertebrate cofilin rescues the viability of a S . cerevisiae cofilin deletion mutant only when the stiffness cation site is simultaneously introduced into actin , demon - strating that filament severing is the essential function of cofilin in cells . This work reveals that site - specific interactions with cations serve a key regulatory function in actin filament fragmentation and dynamics . cytoskeleton | persistence length | mechanics | electron cryomicroscopy A ctin polymerization powers the directed motility of eukary - otic cells and some pathogenic bacteria ( 1 – 3 ) . Actin assembly also plays critical roles in endocytosis , cytokinesis , and establish - ment of cell polarity . Sustained motility requires filament disas - sembly and subunit recycling . The essential regulatory protein cofilin severs actin filaments ( 4 – 6 ) , which accelerates actin net - work reorganization by increasing the concentration of filament ends available for subunit exchange ( 7 ) . Cofilin binding alters the structure and mechanical properties of filaments , which effectively introduces local “ defects ” that compromise filament integrity and promote severing ( 5 ) . Fila - ments with bound cofilin have altered twist ( 8 , 9 ) and are more compliant in both bending and twisting than bare filaments ( 10 – 13 ) . It has been suggested that deformations in filament shape promote fragmentation at or near regions of topological and mechanical discontinuities , such as boundaries between bare and cofilin - decorated segments along partially decorated filaments ( 5 , 12 , 14 – 18 ) . Cations modulate actin filament structure and mechanical properties ( 19 ) and cofilin dissociates filament - associated cations ( 20 ) , leading us to hypothesize that cation - binding interactions regulate filament severing by cofilin . Cations bind filaments at two discrete and specific sites positioned between adjacent sub - units along the long - pitch helix of the filament ( 19 , 21 ) . These cation binding sites are referred to as “ polymerization ” and “ stiffness ” sites based on their roles in filament assembly and mechanics , respectively . These discrete sites bind both mono - valent and divalent cations with a range of affinities ( low milli - molar for divalent and tens of millimolar for monovalent cations ) ( 19 , 21 ) but are predominantly occupied by Mg 2 + and K + under physiological conditions . Here we demonstrate that cation release from the stiffness site plays a central role in filament severing by vertebrate cofilin , both in vitro and in cells . Results and Discussion We tested whether cation occupancy and linked release are re - quired for vertebrate cofilin to alter the structural and mechanical properties of filaments . Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( herein referred to as yeast ) actin lacks an acidic residue ( Glu167 in subdomain 3 ) required to form the stiffness site and filaments display mechan - ical properties that are not influenced by cations ( 19 ) . In contrast , cations have a strong effect on the stiffness of yeast actin filaments engineered with Glu167 at the stiffness site ( A167E ) ( 19 , 22 ) . To investigate the structural basis of the filament stiffness change introduced by the A167E substitution , we solved structures of A167E yeast actin filaments in low and high [ Mg 2 + ] conditions by electron cryomicroscopy . Although the subunit conformational heterogeneity in filaments is evidently high ( 23 ) , comparison of the density maps reveals cation - dependent structural differences that may reflect a shift toward a more rigid conformation at high Mg 2 + concentrations ( Fig . 1 ) . In low [ Mg 2 + ] , the predominant contact between the D - loop and the adjacent subunit is evidently proximal to the filament axis at a low filament radius ( Fig . 1 D and G ) . In Significance Cofilin is an essential actin regulatory protein that severs fila - ments , which accelerates network remodeling by increasing the concentration of filament ends available for elongation and subunit exchange . The molecular basis of how cofilin binding interactions fragment filaments , which have stiffness comparable to commercial laboratory plastics , remains a cen - tral and unresolved mystery of cellular actin cytoskeleton re - organization . In this study we demonstrate that actin filament severing by vertebrate cofilin is driven by the linked dissocia - tion of a single , site - specific cation that controls filament structure and mechanical properties , and that filament sever - ing is an essential function of cofilin in cells . This work estab - lishes that discrete interactions with cations serve a central regulatory function in mediating actin filament fragmentation by certain classes of severing proteins .

These two contact types correspond to D - loop confor - mational modes “ 2 ” and “ 3 , ” respectively , inferred from hetero - geneity analysis of vertebrate actin filaments ( 23 ) . These observa - tions suggest that stiffness cation occupancy is coupled to the D - loop conformation and radial distribution of long - axis contacts between adjacent filament subunits ( Fig . 1 D , E , G , and H ) , con - sistent with a role for the D - loop conformation in controlling filament mechanical properties ( 10 , 24 – 26 ) . We also solved a cryo - EM structure of A167E yeast actin fila - ments with bound vertebrate cofilin . The stiffness cation and cofilin binding sites overlap ( Fig . 1 F and ref . 21 ) , such that steric interactions preclude simultaneous occupancy by both ligands . Consistent with a prior cryo - EM study ( 8 ) , cofilin induces a large ( ∼ 30° ) rotation of the actin outer domain ( subdomains 1 and 2 ; Fig . 1 F ) , which repositions the D - loop away from the upper half of the stiffness site in the adjacent subunit . Thus , cofilin occupancy compromises the geometry and cation coordination of the pre - dicted stiffness site . The overlapping binding sites and allosteric interactions give rise to strong thermodynamic coupling between cofilin binding and cation release ( 20 ) . The bending flexibilities of actin filaments with and without bound cofilin were quantitated from a correlation analysis of thermally driven shape fluctuations ( 27 ) . Vertebrate cofilin binding increases the flexibility ( i . e . , lowers the bending persistence length , L p ) of vertebrate and A167E yeast actin filaments but has no de - tectable effect on the bending mechanics of WT yeast actin fila - ments ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S1 ) despite binding with tight affinity ( K d < 100 nM ) ( 12 ) , comparable to the affinity of vertebrate cofilin binding to A167E yeast actin filaments ( Fig . S2 ) . Thus , occupancy of the stiffness site is essential for vertebrate cofilin to alter the mechanical properties of actin filaments . Therefore , we evaluated whether cation interactions at the stiffness site and subsequent alterations in filament properties contribute to vertebrate cofilin severing activity , which we visu - alized in real time by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Fig . S1 ) . Vertebrate cofilin efficiently severs vertebrate actin filaments as well as A167E yeast actin filaments , as indicated by a dramatic reduction in average filament length ( Fig . 2B ) , whereas we detected no severing of WT yeast actin filaments over the time range of observation ( representative time course shown in Fig . 2 B ; severing rates shown in Fig . S1 ) ( 12 ) . The average steady - state filament length ( Fig . 2 C and D ) con - firms that WT yeast actin filaments are weakly severed by ver - tebrate cofilin , whereas A167E yeast actin filaments partially decorated with cofilin are severed more efficiently than bare or saturated filaments , similar to vertebrate actin filaments ( 12 , 16 ) . Addition of phalloidin , which stiffens bare actin segments ( 28 ) and thus introduces a mechanical gradient at boundaries , pro - motes vertebrate cofilin - mediated severing of WT yeast actin filaments ( Fig . S3 ) . Furthermore , severing of A167E yeast actin Fig . 1 .

Severing seems to be more effi - cient in real - time assays , presumably owing to inhibition of filament rean - nealing by flow . 17822 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1413397111 Kang et al . filaments scales with the difference in stiffness between flexible cofilin - decorated segments and bare actin segments , whose rigidity and structure depends on stiffness site cation occupancy ( Fig . S4 ) , suggesting that the steepness of the mechanical gradient and structural change at boundaries determines filament severing ef - ficiency . The gradient steepness is determined by the rigidity and conformational flexibility of bare segments with stiffness cation binding sites , because cofilactin segment rigidity is similar at all [ Mg 2 + ] . Both mechanical and topological discontinuities are likely to be required for efficient severing by cofilin , because regulatory proteins ( e . g . , tropomyosin and myosin ) and ligands that stiffen filaments ( 29 – 31 ) without dramatically altering filament structure ( 32 ) do not sever filaments , even at partial occupancy ( Fig . S3 and ref . 31 ) . The two variants of yeast actin with different stiffness sites , WT and A167E mutant , provide an experimental tool to directly evaluate the role of cofilin severing activity in cells . Cofilin is essential for S . cerevisiae viability ( 33 ) . Vertebrate cofilin does not sever yeast actin filaments ( Fig . 2 ) and does not rescue the lethal phenotype associated with yeast cofilin deletion ( Fig . 3 A , sector 3 ) ( 22 ) . With the yeast cofilin gene intact , the A167E yeast actin mutant is viable and displays little or no defect in growth ( Fig . 3 A , sectors 1 and 2 ) or actin patch and cable dynamics ( Fig . 3 B and C , Table 1 , and Movies S1 and S2 ) compared with WT cells . Strikingly , vertebrate cofilin in the A167E yeast actin background rescues the viability of yeast cofilin deletion ( Fig . 3 A , sector 4 ) , indicating that the actin filament severing activity of cofilin is essential for its function in cells . Yeast cells with A167E actin and vertebrate cofilin assemble actin patches and actin cables ( Fig . 3 B – G and Movies S3 – S6 ) with patch internalization efficiencies comparable to those of WT and A167E cells ( Table 1 ) . Patches of yeast cells with A167E and vertebrate cofilin seem to be slightly more stable than those of WT cells , as indicated by the patch lifetimes ( Table 1 ) . These results favor a model in which each bound cofilin dis - sociates a stiffness cation at an actin subunit interface , which compromises longitudinal and lateral contacts between adjacent filament subunits ( Fig . 1 ) . Loss of these contacts introduces a local change in compliance and mechanical phase boundary of differential stiffness within the filament that is susceptible to fragmentation by shape deformations ( 12 ) . The absence of a stiffness site renders WT yeast actin filaments resistant to frag - mentation by vertebrate cofilin because mechanical gradients and corresponding conformational changes and fluctuations at junctions between bare and cofilin - decorated segments are small or nonexistent without stiffness - site cations . An alternative explanation is that the A167E substitution manifests its effect through a cation - independent mechanism . E167 forms a noncovalent ionic bridge with K61 of an adjacent subunit in high - resolution actin filament models derived from electron cryomicroscopy ( 34 , 35 ) , raising the possibility that the observed effects of the A - to - E substitution are simply a conse - quence of introducing a stabilizing ionic bridge . Several obser - vations argue against this interpretation . Salts and electrolytes weaken ionic bridges between charged protein residues ( 36 , 37 ) , which would compromise intersubunit contacts and lower the filament stiffness ( 10 , 38 ) . In contrast , Mg 2 + enhances inter - subunit contacts ( Fig . 1 ) and stiffens A167E yeast actin filaments ( 19 ) . If A167E yeast actin filament severing were driven by cofilin - mediated rupture of intrinsic K61 – E167 ionic bridges , filament severing would occur at any salt conditions , as long as cofilin was bound . In marked contrast , vertebrate cofilin severs weakly , if at all , in low [ Mg 2 + ] and displays a severing efficiency that scales with the Mg 2 + concentration and the stiffness of bare filament segments ( Fig . S4 ) . These results indicate that both A167E mutation and stiffness cations are required for vertebrate cofilin to sever yeast actin filaments , thereby eliminating cation - independent severing pathways . We emphasize that E167 need not directly coordinate the stiffness cation as predicted from structural bioinformatics and mutagenesis ( 19 ) , nor does the cation have to be positioned at regions of enhanced intersubunit contacts to adhere to a site - specific cation - dependent mechanism . Cation effects on actin structure and mechanics could arise from allosteric interactions originating at a distal site , rather than through direct coordination with E167 or the D - loop . A mechanism in which cation binding alters the filament subunit conformation and promotes formation of an ionic bridge between K61 and E167 or other stabilizing , longitudinal and / or lateral intersubunit interaction would also account for the observed salt requirements of filament stiffening and severing . Vertebrate cofilin adopts two distinct conformational states , or binding modes , that exist in a reversible equilibrium on actin fila - ments ( 12 , 13 , 39 ) . One of these binding modes may be associated with enhanced filament elasticity , severing , and / or acceleration of terminal filament subunit release ( see ref . 40 for relevance of binding mode to Plasmodium cofilin ) . The observed cation effects on vertebrate cofilin severing activity could potentially originate from a salt - dependent shift in the equilibrium of these con - formations . We do not favor this mechanism given existing data because A167E yeast actin filaments with bound cofilin are struc - turally indistinguishable in low - and high - Mg 2 + conditions at the current resolution ( Fig . 1 ) , A167E cofilactin filaments ( ν = 0 . 9 ) Fig . 3 . Actin filament - severing activity of cofilin is essential for viability and actin dynamics in yeast . ( A ) A single - point mutation in yeast actin allows human cofilin to function in yeast . Yeast strain MHY8403 ( act1 Δ cof1 Δ / YCp50ACT1 , pRS316COF1 ) was transformed with pairs of plasmids bearing the indicated alleles and spread on selection plates lacking leucine and histidine . Single colonies were then streaked onto FOA plates and incubated at 30 °C for 4 d . The act1 - A167E hCOF strain ( sector 4 ) grows slightly more slowly than the other two viable strains .

PNAS | December 16 , 2014 | vol . 111 | no . 50 | 17823 B I O C H E M I S T RY sever weakly in both low and high Mg 2 + ( Fig . S4 ) , and vertebrate cofilin severs WT yeast actin filaments weakly at all salt concen - trations tested . Actin filament severing by vertebrate cofilin requires stiffness cations to create a mechanical and topological gradient , explaining why it weakly severs WT yeast actin filaments lacking a stiffness cation site ( 12 ) . Yeast cofilin , however , alters the mechanics of both WT yeast and vertebrate actin filaments and efficiently severs them ( 12 ) . The molecular mechanism and pathway of severing must therefore vary , in some contexts , between yeast and verte - brate cofilins . Alteration of WT yeast actin filament flexibility and severing by yeast cofilin must originate from E167 - and stiffness cation - independent perturbations . However , the severing activities of both yeast and vertebrate cofilins correlate with the ability to alter filament mechanical properties ( 12 ) , favoring a shared me - chanical mechanism for severing ( 5 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 19 , 41 ) . These differences among cofilin orthologs are presumably explained by their relatively low sequence identity ( ∼ 40 % ) , which may afford yeast cofilin with additional or distinct ( yeast ) actin interactions from vertebrate cofilin ( 42 ) . Gelsolin severs actin filaments by a different mechanism than vertebrate cofilin , involving insertion of gelsolin subdomains between adjacent filament subunits ( 43 , 44 ) , and efficiently fragments both WT and A167E yeast actin filaments ( Fig . S5 ) . This indicates that a stiffness cation - linked mechanism is not a general feature of filament severing proteins , although other cofilin isoforms and orthologs may operate by a cation - dependent mechanism similar to vertebrate cofilin . Other filament binding proteins ( e . g . , tropomyosin and myosin ) that bind at or near the stiffness site could potentially disrupt site geometry and cation occupancy ( 21 ) . This may seem at variance with the observed stiffening effects of these proteins ( 29 – 31 ) . However , this could be realized if cation - dependent interactions are replaced with more stabilizing protein – protein interactions ( e . g . , directly binding adjacent filament subunits ) . The work presented here establishes that discrete and specific cation interactions play a fundamental role in regulating the structure and mechanical properties of actin filaments and the severing activity of vertebrate cofilin . Thus , filament - associated cations act as regulatory cofactors of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Materials and Methods Protein and Sample Preparations . Yeast actin ( WT and A167E ) was purified using DNase I affinity chromatography with the previously described mod - ifications ( 45 ) and labeled with pyrene for equilibrium binding experiments or Alexa 488 - succimidyl ester ( 12 , 19 ) as described for TIRF microscopy im - aging . Vertebrate actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder , gel - filtered over Sephacryl S - 300 equilibrated in buffer A ( 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , and 2 mM Tris · HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , and labeled with pyrene and Alexa - 488 - succimidyl ester as described above . Ca - ATP - G - actin was converted into Mg - ATP - G - actin with 200 μ M EGTA and MgCl 2 equal to the [ G - actin ] plus 10 μ M . Mg - ATP - G - actin was polymerized by adding 0 . 1 volume of 10 × polymerization KMI 6 . 8 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 6 . 8 ) . Recombinant human cofilin - 1 was purified ( 12 , 14 ) and concentration determined as de - scribed ( 46 ) . Purified rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1 was provided as a generous gift from David D . Thomas , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , and labeled with N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) as described ( 47 ) . Human plasma gelsolin was purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc . Equilibrium Binding Assay . Equilibrum binding of human cofilin to yeast actin filaments was monitored by pyrene fluorescence ( λ ex 366 nm ; the fluores - cence emission at 90° was scanned from 390 nm to 420 nm ) with a Photon Technologies International QuantaMaster40 fluorimeter at 22 °C in MI 6 . 8 buffer . The binding affinity of human cofilin to vertebrate and A167E mutant yeast actin filaments was determined from the best fits of the data to a quadratic form of a two - state equilibrium binding equation ( 16 ) or a cooperative binding model with nearest - neighbor interactions ( 14 ) . Cofilin binding densities were calculated from the measured binding con - stants ( 14 , 20 ) . Actin Filament Bending Persistence Length ( L p ) Analysis . Images of thermally fluctuating or surface - adsorbed Alexa - labeled yeast actin filaments were ac - quired at room temperature ( ∼ 22 °C ) using an iMic digital objective - based TIRF microscope ( Till Photonics ) equipped with a 100 × oil objective ( Olympus ) , an iXon 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology ) , and LiveAcquisition image software ( Till Photonics ) . Microscope slides were cleaned with absolute eth - anol then 0 . 1 M KOH , followed by extensive rinsing with MilliQ water . The actin filament L p values were determined from an angular correlation anal - ysis of digitized filament images ( > 20 images , n = 200 – 500 individual fila - ments ) using a custom MATLAB script as described in detail ( 11 , 12 , 19 , 27 ) . Filament Severing Assays . Filament severing activity was assayed in real time and under steady - state conditions . For the real - time severing assay , direct visualization of Alexa - 488 – labeled actin filament severing was performed using TIRF microscopy ( 12 , 16 ) . Filaments were immobilized on the NEM - inactiated muscle myosin - coated ( with 150 – 200 nM for 5 min ; ref . 16 ) cov - erslip and human cofilin was added to the flow cell at the indicated concentration in KMI 6 . 8 buffer supplemented with 0 . 1 mg / mL glucose oxi - dase , 15 mM glucose , and 20 μ g / mL catalase . The severing activities were quantified by counting cumulative severing events per each frame , dividing those by total length of actin filaments and elapsed time for each frame . In the equilibrium length severing assay , samples of 3 μ M Alexa - 488 – la - beled actin filaments and human cofilin - 1 concentrations yielding a range of binding densities were equilibrated for 60 min at room temperature then serially diluted in KMI 6 . 8 buffer containing cofilin at concentrations to not alter the binding density ( 12 ) . In the phalloidin competition experiment , 2 μ M Alexa - 488 – labeled actin filaments equilibrated with cofilin and phalloi - din were diluted in KMI 6 . 8 buffer containing cofilin , yielding a range of binding densities and phalloidin ( 31 ) . In the gelsolin severing experiment , preformed Alexa - 488 – labeled yeast actin filaments were equilibrated with gelsolin ( at a molar ratio of 1 : 370 ) in buffer B [ 10 mM Tris · Cl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ] at room temperature for 5 – 10 min , followed by dilution in buffer B for imaging ( 45 ) . Filaments were immobilized to poly - L - lysine treated slides and imaged as done for the determination of filament flexural rigidity . The average fila - ment length ( L avg ) was determined from the population mean because the length distributions deviate from an exponential function , presumably be - cause of contributions from filament annealing , severing , and elongation from both filament ends ( 48 ) . The L avg value at steady state is inversely proportional to the severing rate according to L avg = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ nk anneal = k sev p , where n is the total number of actin filament subunits and k anneal and k sev are the annealing ( unaffected by cofilin occupancy ; Fig . S6 ) and severing rates , re - spectively . The full derivation of this relationship is included in SI Text . Sample Preparation for Electron Cryomicroscopy . Unlabeled A167E mutant yeast actin was polymerized in MI 6 . 8 buffer ( 0 . 4 mM for low - salt condition or 5 mM MgCl 2 for high - salt condition , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 6 . 8 ) , and preformed A167E actin filaments were equilibrated with or without human cofilin - 1 ( ν = 0 . 9 ) with a final actin concentration of ∼ 5 – 10 μ M . Samples ( 4 – 5 μ L ) were applied onto Quantifoil holey carbon grids ( R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 ; no glow discharge was applied ) , incubated for 1 – 2 min in a hu - midified chamber , and plunge - frozen into liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark II automated system . Samples were imaged at 27 , 000 × magnification in Table 1 .

A total of 60 – 69 frames were obtained for each sample area , with a frame collection rate of three per second and a net dose over all frames of ∼ 45 electrons per square angstrom of sample area . Movie frames were aligned and summed using the dosef _ driftcorr motion correction soft - ware package ( 49 ) , with minor modifications to permit central processing unit - only computations in the absence of a suitable graphics card . Defocuses and astigmatism parameters for the micrographs were esti - mated using the CTFFIND3 program ( 50 ) and were subsequently used to phase - flip the micrographs before initial extraction of filament images . Short overlapping box segments of selected filaments were then extrac - ted from the resulting micrographs and rotated to an approximately vertical orientation using the user - specified path of the filaments . The rotation was accomplished with a fast sinc - interpolation algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform , implemented as a set of MATLAB codes ( http : / / www . elisanet . fi / antti . happonen / fastint / ) and executed in the Oc - tave open - source numerical analysis package ( www . gnu . org / software / octave / doc / interpreter ) . Segment dimension was 400 pixels , and box centers were spaced ∼ 13 pixels apart corresponding to one actin repeat per segment . SPARX Alignment Step . Initial alignment parameters and a corresponding 3D reconstruction were obtained with the SPARX implementation ( 51 ) of the IHRSR method ( 52 ) , using an atomic model of the actin filament ( 34 ) as an initial reference volume after low - pass filtering to 50 Å . Box seg - ments were binned four times for the SPARX refinement , which was done in three passes with successively finer sampling for Euler angles and shift parameters ( sampling of Euler angles was 10 , 4 , and 1 . 5° for the first , second , and third pass , respectively ; corresponding sampling spacing in the shift parameters was 2 , 1 , and 0 . 5 pixels , respectively ) . The resulting alignment parameters were assessed to check for consistency in the rel - ative axial rotation from one subunit to the next in contiguous regions of the same filament ( axial rotation for consecutive subunits is expected to change by 167 . 1° and 162° in the absence and presence of cofilin , re - spectively ) . Filaments with more than 10 discontinuities in the axial ro - tation angle were discarded from consideration in subsequent phases of the analysis . FREALIGN Refinement Step . The SPARX alignment parameters were mapped back onto the original micrographs and used to reextract and rotate new instances of unbinned and non - phase - flipped box segments , resulting in a raw image stack for which the expected image shifts and in - plane rotation Euler angles were approximately zero . This second image stack , along with associatedalignmentparametersderivedfrom SPARX , wastheninput tothe FREALIGN package ( 53 ) for further cycles of refinement and reconstruction . To minimize the possibility of overrefinement , a resolution cutoff was ap - plied such that information beyond a conservative threshold was excluded from the refinement target . This threshold was gradually lowered from 30 Å to 15 Å over five or six successive rounds of refinement . Subsequent to the first round of FREALIGN refinement , the resulting 3D reconstruction was low - pass - filtered to 40 Å and used to generate a cosine - edged soft mask ( fall - off width of 20 Å ) that encompassed ∼ 200 % of the expected molecular volume of the filaments . This mask was then applied to the reference volume before each subsequent round of refinement , to mini - mize alignment errors due to noise in the solvent region . The resolution of the reconstructions was estimated by a gold - standard procedure ( 54 ) in which the filaments were separated into two groups , and all SPARX and FREALIGN refinement steps were performed separately on both groups . The resulting pair of fully independent reconstructions was aligned by ro - tation and translation along the z axis to maximize the correlation co - efficient , before computation of the Fourier shell correlation within the masked region . The resolution of all three final reconstructions was 10 – 11 Å as indicated by the 0 . 143 criterion . A B - factor of − 600 was applied to the reconstructions before rendering for display . Atomic coordinates of actin or cofilactin were fit into density maps using the Fit in Map function of UCSF Chimera package from the Computer Graphics Laboratory , Uni - versity of California , San Francisco . All molecular graphics images were rendered by UCSF Chimera . Yeast Cell Analyses . All S . cerevisiae strains were congenic with the BY4741 ( a his3 Δ 1 leu2 Δ 0 met15 Δ 0 ura3 Δ 0 ) strain used to make the yeast gene deletion collection ( Open Biosystems ) . Standard methods were used to manipulate yeast cells ( 55 ) . MHY8282 ( a cof1 Δ : : kanMX / pRS316COF1 ) was used to test complementation by different cofilin genes by a plasmid - shuffle assay , and MHY8403 ( α act1 Δ : : natMX cof1 Δ : : kanMX / pRS316COF1 , YCp50ACT1 ) was used for testing various pairs of actin and cofilin genes . To make MHY8282 , the diploid cof1 Δ : : kanMX / COF1 heterozygous strain 202C8 ( Open Bio - systems ) was transformed with pRS316COF1 and sporulated , and viable haploid cof1 Δ [ pRS316COF1 ] progeny were isolated by tetrad dissection . To make MHY8403 , MHY8282 was first crossed to SVY12 ( α act1 Δ : : natMX MET15 / YCp50ACT1 ) ( 56 ) , a gift from David Amberg , State University of New York Upstate Medical University , Syracuse , NY . The resulting diploid strain was sporulated , and tetrads were dissected . MHY8403 was a Met + non - parental ditype segregant . Plasmids were constructed by standard methods . A 2 . 0 kb EcoRI frag - ment containing yeast COF1 was isolated from pDD59 , a gift from David Drubin , University of California , Berkeley , and subcloned into pRS316 ( URA3 , CEN ) and YCplac111 ( LEU2 , CEN ) ( 57 , 58 ) . A 3 . 0 - kb BamHI – EcoRI ACT1 fragment was excised from a pRS314ACT1 plasmid kindly provided by Peter Rubenstein , University of Iowa , Iowa City , and ligated into pRS313 ( HIS3 , CEN ) . The act1 - A167E mutant was identical to the above ACT1 gene except for the desired codon change ( 22 ) . Peter Rubenstein provided a yeast strain carrying pRS314act1 - A167E ; this plasmid was re - covered , and the BamHI – EcoRI insert was subcloned into pRS313 . The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing . The ACT1 and act1 - A167E inserts were subsequently excised from the pRS313 backbone by BamHI and SalI digestion and subcloned into pRS41H ( hphNT1 ) ( 59 ) . For expression of human cofilin ( hCOF ) in yeast , the 501 - bp hCOF open - reading frame was inserted between the yeast COF1 promoter ( corre - sponding to the 251 - bp upstream of the translational start site ) and termi - nator ( corresponding to the 200 - bp downstream of the stop codon ) sequences in the vector pBMH . BamHI and NotI restriction sites at the re - spective ends of the 952 - bp chimeric DNA insert were cleaved , and the fragment was ligated into pRS315 ( LEU2 , CEN ) . The hCOF sequence in the resulting pRS315hCOF plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing . To create yeast strains for imaging of actin patches and cables , the ABP1 - GFP : : HIS3 and ABP140 - 3GFP : : HIS3 alleles were amplified by high - fidelity PCR from genomic DNA of yeast strains MAY013 and MAY045 , respectively . The amplified DNA fragments were integrated into MHY8403 cells , and His + colonies were screened by fluorescence microscopy for the expected staining patterns . The resulting strains , MHY8728 and MHY8731 , respectively , were then transformed with pRS41H - ACT1 or pRS41H - act1 - A167E together with either YCplac111COF1 or pRS315hCOF . Leu + hygromycin B - resistant colonies were then streaked onto 5 - FOA medium to identify cells that had lost the original URA3 plasmids carrying WT ACT1 and COF1 . Cell Imaging . Yeast strains were cultured overnight in imaging media [ 1 . 7 g / L yeast nitrogen base , 0 . 1 g / L ammonium sulfate , 5 g / L casaminoic acids , 0 . 1 g / L uracil , 0 . 1 g / L adenin , and 2 % ( wt / vol ) dextrose ] and resuspended in the morning at an OD 600 of 0 . 1 2 – 3 h before imaging . Cells were immobilized on coverslips coated with 0 . 1 g / L Con A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and imaged in their medial focal plane on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a 100 × , 1 . 4 numerical aperture Plan - Apochromat objective lens . Images corresponding to the fluorescence signal of Abp1 - GFP or Abp140 - 3GFP were collected with a Hamamatsu ORCA CCD camera and analyzed with Metavue version 6 . 2r6 ( Universal Imaging ) . Actin patch dynamics were analyzed as described ( 60 , 61 ) . The patch start and end times were determined as the first and last frames in which the patch could be distinguished from the background . The total patch lifetime was determined as the time difference between the end frame and the first frame plus the duration of a single frame . Kymographs were plotted along a line perpendicular to the membrane of the cell and passing through the center of the patch when it reached its maximum intensity . We defined the criteria for patch internalization when the maximum intensity of the patch was displaced of at least two pixels ( corresponding to a distance of 129 nm ) from its original point at the end of its lifetime .

(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k anneal nk sever N + dN ; [ S1 ] where n is the total number of actin filament subunits , k sever is the microscopic severing rate constant , and k anneal is the rate con - stant for annealing of filament fragments . Severing is assumed to occur locally from perturbations within filaments and not to de - pend on the total filament number . Therefore , the overall ob - served severing rate constant ( nk sever ) is determined by the mi - croscopic severing rate constant ( k sever ) and scales with the total number ( n ) of actin filament subunits where severing can occur . Filament annealing is a two - body reaction , so k anneal represents a second - order rate constant for annealing of two filament frag - ments that we assume , for simplicity , is independent of filament length . The ratio of fragmentation and annealing rate constants represents the macroscopic fragmentation – annealing equilib - rium constant ( K sev - ann = nk sever / k anneal ) . The differential equation describing the change in filament number ( dN ) as defined by Scheme S1 is given by dN dt = nk sever − k anneal N 2 : [ S2 ] At thermodynamic equilibrium of the fragmentation – annealing process ( t → ∞ ) dN = dt = 0 , the severing and annealing process - ing are balanced and from Eq . S2 the total filament number at equilibrium is N = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ nk sever k anneal s [ S3 ] and the average filament length is given by ref . 1 : L avg = n N = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ nk anneal k sever s : [ S4 ] Regulatory proteins that participate in this reaction ( i . e . , modulate severing and / or annealing ) can alter the rate constants and / or the equilibrium constant . Because filament annealing results from filament end interactions , we assume it is independent of regulatory protein occupancy along filament sides . However , severing proteins act on subunits within filaments and alter the site - specific microscopic severing rate constant . In the case of cofilin - linked actin filament fragmentation , the filament severing rate constant k sever depends on cofilin occupancy ( i . e . , binding density , ν ) , such that partially decorated filaments sever more readily than fully occupied or bare filaments ( 1 , 2 ) . Under conditions where annealing is independent of cofilin in - teractions ( Fig . S6 ) , k anneal is constant and alterations in filament length are accounted for by cofilin - dependent modulation of k sever . To develop a general , quantitative model of regulatory protein - linked filament severing , we consider filaments as a linear lattice of subunits with regulatory protein binding sites . Fragmenation occurs at the interface between filament subunits . In the case of cofilin , binding sites are positioned between adjacent filament subunits ( 3 ) . Therefore , cofilin binding sites represent potential fragmentation sites . Filament severing in the presence of cofilin can occur at any of four distinct filament sites : sites where cofilin binds noncontiguously ( i . e . , isolated ) , within a bare or cofilin - decorated segment , or at the junctions ( i . e . , boundaries ) between occupied and vacant sites . The corresponding rate constants for severing at the distinct cofilin binding configurations ( i . e . , isolated , singly contiguous at a boundary , doubly contiguous within a cluster ) are defined here as k iso for severing at an isolated bound cofilin , k dc for severing within a cofilin - decorated cluster , k sc for severing at a boundary between a bare and cofilin - decorated segment , and k free for severing within a bare fila - ment region devoid of bound cofilin . Therefore , the severing rate constant k sever in the presence of cofilin represents a composite of microscopic rate constants , which can be written as k sever = k dc × fractional double contiguously bound protein + k sc × fractional single contiguously bound protein + k iso × fractional isolately bound protein + k free × fractional protein free sites = k free (cid:4) k dc k free s dc + k sc k free s sc + k iso k free s iso + s free (cid:5) = k free (cid:6) k ′ dc s dc + k ′ sc s sc + k ′ iso s iso + s free (cid:7) ; [ S5 ] where s represents the average fractional occupancies of either double contiguously bound cofilin ( s dc ) , single contiguously bound cofilin ( s sc ) , isolated bound cofilin ( s iso ) , or unoccupied filament sites ( s free ) . The terms k ′ dc , k ′ sc , and k ′ iso represent rate constants relative to that at free sites ( i . e . , k ′ = k / k free ) . The average filament length ( Eq . S4 ) can be integrated with the severing rate constant ( Eq . S5 ) and rewritten as follows : L avg = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ nk anneal k free (cid:6) k ′ dc s dc + k ′ sc s sc + k ′ iso s iso + s free (cid:7) s = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ nk anneal k free s ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k ′ dc s dc + k ′ sc s sc + k ′ iso s iso + s free p = L avg ; intrinsic ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k ′ dc s dc + k ′ sc s sc + k ′ iso s iso + s free p ; [ S6 ] where L avg ; intrinsic = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ nk anneal k free s [ S7 ] yields the average filament length of native actin in the absence of regulatory proteins ( i . e . , intrinsic severing and annealing ) . To derive s dc ; s sc ; and s iso , the probability ( P ) of finding a bound regulatory protein cluster of length c along a filament ( P c ) was derived following the method developed by McGhee and von Hippel ( 4 ) for determining the probability of finding a contiguous gap of vacant lattice sites ( P g ) : Kang et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1413397111 1 of 8 P c = ð fb 1 Þð b n b 1 Þ c − 1 ð b n f Þ ; c ≥ 1 P 0 = ð ff Þ : [ S8 ] The terms ( ff ) , ( fb 1 ) , ( b n b 1 ) , and ( b n f ) are defined as probabilities of finding a free site with either a free site ( ff ) or bound regula - tory protein ( fb ) at right , and a bound regulatory protein with either a bound regulatory protein ( bb ) or a free site ( bf ) at right ( 4 ) . The summation of all cluster probabilities equals unity : X ∞ c = 0 P c = 1 : [ S9 ] A site to the right of a bound regulatory protein must be either vacant or occupied .
