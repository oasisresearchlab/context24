In many scientiﬁc disciplines , the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal eﬀects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally aﬀects the outcome . Causal mediation analysis is fre - quently used to assess potential causal mechanisms . The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis . The package is organized into two distinct approaches . Using the model - based approach , researchers can estimate causal mediation eﬀects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design . Furthermore , the design - based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under diﬀerent experimental designs . This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model - based approach . We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple ( causally dependent ) mediators , which are often encountered in practice . Finally , the package also oﬀers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance , a common problem in randomized trials . Keywords : causal mechanisms , mediation analysis , mediation , R . 1 . Introduction Scholars across a wide range of disciplines are increasingly interested in identifying causal mechanisms , going beyond the estimation of causal eﬀects . Once they ascertain that cer - tain variables causally aﬀect the outcome , the next natural step is to understand how these variables exert their inﬂuence . The standard procedure for analyzing causal mechanisms in applied research is called mediation analysis , where a set of linear regression models are ﬁt - 2 Causal Mediation Analysis ted and then the estimates of “mediation eﬀects” are computed from the ﬁtted models ( e . g . , Haavelmo 1943 ; Baron and Kenny 1986 ; Shadish , Cook , and Campbell 2001 ; MacKinnon 2008 ) . In recent years , however , causal mechanisms have been studied within the modern framework of causal inference with an emphasis on the assumptions required for identiﬁ - cation . This approach has highlighted limitations of earlier methods and pointed the way towards a more ﬂexible estimation strategy . In addition , new research designs have been proposed for identifying causal mechanisms . In this paper , we introduce a full featured R package , mediation ( Tingley , Yamamoto , Hirose , Keele , and Imai 2013 ) , for studying causal mechanisms . The mediation package allows users to ( 1 ) investigate the role of causal mechanisms using diﬀerent types of data and statistical models , ( 2 ) explore how results change as identiﬁcation assumptions are relaxed , and ( 3 ) calculate quantities of interest under alternative research designs . We focus on the demon - stration of the functionalities available through the mediation package . The statistical theory that underlies the procedures implemented in the mediation package is presented elsewhere along with various empirical examples ( Imai , Keele , and Yamamoto 2010c ; Imai , Keele , Tin - gley , and Yamamoto 2011 ; Imai , Keele , and Tingley 2010a ; Imai , Tingley , and Yamamoto 2013 ; Yamamoto 2013 ) . The mediation package is freely available for download via the Comprehensive R Archive Net - work ( CRAN ) at http : / / CRAN . R - project . org / package = mediation and runs on a variety of computing platforms ( R Core Team 2014 ) . In addition , a Stata ( StataCorp . 2013 ) version of the package is available but has a more limited functionality ( Hicks and Tingley 2011 ) . The ﬁrst version of the mediation package appeared at CRAN in 2009 , and Imai , Keele , Tingley , and Yamamoto ( 2010b ) discuss an earlier version of the package . Since then , however , we have dramatically improved the package with a signiﬁcant number of new functionalities and improvements . The current paper thus provides an up - to - date description of the analyses that can be conducted via the mediation package . To install the mediation package , use the following standard syntax for installing an R package , R > install . packages ( " mediation " ) where users may be prompted to select a CRAN mirror from which the package will be downloaded . This step needs to be done only once ( unless one wishes to update the mediation package to the new version ) . In the next section , we present an overview of the mediation package . We then describe the functionalities of the package for the model - based causal mediation analysis ( Section 3 ) , mul - tilevel mediation analysis ( Section 4 ) , the design - based causal mediation analysis ( Section 5 ) , the analysis of causally dependent multiple mediators ( Section 6 ) , and causal mediation anal - ysis with treatment noncompliance ( Section 7 ) . Finally , Section 8 concludes . 2 . Overview of the mediation package The mediation package consists of several main functions as well as various methods for summarizing output from these functions ( e . g . , plot and summary ) . The package requires little programming knowledge on the user’s side . Figure 1 illustrates the core structure of the mediation package , which distinguishes between model - based and design - based inference . Model - based inference has been standard practice in the mediation analysis to date . In the Journal of Statistical Software 3 Figure 1 : Core structure of the mediation package as of version 4 . 0 . experimental setting , the treatment variable is randomized and the mediating and outcome variables are observed without any intervention by researchers . Imai et al . ( 2010a ) show that a range of parametric and semi - parametric models may then be used to estimate the average causal mediation eﬀect , deﬁned below , and other quantities of interest . This modeling ap - proach relies on the sequential ignorability assumption for point identiﬁcation , which as Imai et al . ( 2010a ) show , provides a general purpose algorithm for estimating quantities of interest . In contrast , design - based inference primarily employs the features of the experimental design and does not require the sequential ignorability assumption . The formal identiﬁcation prop - erties of these designs are studied by Imai et al . ( 2013 ) and the examples from experimental and observational studies are contained in Imai et al . ( 2011 , 2013 ) . We refer readers to these papers for the details about the statistical methods implemented via the mediation package . Before describing the functions available in mediation , we brieﬂy deﬁne the quantities of inter - est that our software is designed to estimate . Here , we use the potential outcomes framework to deﬁne these quantities . Let M i ( t ) denote the potential value of a mediator of interest for unit i under the treatment status T i = t . Let Y i ( t , m ) denote the potential outcome that would result if the treatment and mediating variables equal t and m , respectively . Consider a standard experimental design where only the treatment variable is randomized . We observe only one of the potential outcomes , and the observed outcome , Y i , equals Y i ( T i , M i ( T i ) ) where M i ( T i ) represents the observed value of the mediator M i . With this notation , the total unit treatment eﬀect can be written as , τ i ≡ Y i ( 1 , M i ( 1 ) ) − Y i ( 0 , M i ( 0 ) ) . ( 1 ) We can decompose this total eﬀect into the two components . First , the causal mediation eﬀects are represented by ( Robins and Greenland 1992 ; Pearl 2001 ) , δ i ( t ) ≡ Y i ( t , M i ( 1 ) ) − Y i ( t , M i ( 0 ) ) , ( 2 ) for each treatment status t = 0 , 1 . All other causal mechanisms can be represented by the direct eﬀects of the treatment as , ζ i ( t ) ≡ Y i ( 1 , M i ( t ) ) − Y i ( 0 , M i ( t ) ) , ( 3 ) 4 Causal Mediation Analysis for each unit i and each treatment status t = 0 , 1 . Together , we see that they sum up to the total eﬀect , τ i = δ i ( t ) + ζ i ( 1 − t ) ( 4 ) for t = 0 , 1 . The case of multiple candidate mediating variables requires additional notation and is discussed in Section 6 . The average causal mediation eﬀects ( ACME ) ¯ δ ( t ) and the average direct eﬀects ( ADE ) ¯ ζ ( t ) , represent the population averages of these causal mediation and direct eﬀects . Identiﬁcation of the ACME requires an additional assumption beyond the strong ignorability of the treatment , which is suﬃcient for identifying the average total eﬀect of the treatment . Let X i be a vector of the observed pre - treatment confounders for unit i . The key identifying assumption is called sequential ignorability and can be written as , Assumption 1 ( Sequential Ignorability ; Imai et al . 2010c ) { Y i ( t (cid:48) , m ) , M i ( t ) } ⊥⊥ T i | X i = x , ( 5 ) Y i ( t (cid:48) , m ) ⊥⊥ M i ( t ) | T i = t , X i = x , ( 6 ) where 0 < P ( T i = t | X i = x ) and 0 < p ( M i = m | T i = t , X i = x ) for t = 0 , 1 , and all x and m in the support of X i and M i , respectively . Equation 5 is the standard strong ignorability of the treatment assignment and is satisﬁed , for example , if the treatment is randomized ( possibly conditional on X i ) . However , Equation 6 requires that the mediator is also ignorable given the observed treatment and pre - treatment confounders . This additional assumption is quite strong because it excludes the existence of ( measured or unmeasured ) post - treatment confounders as well as that of unmeasured pre - treatment confounders . This assumption , therefore , rules out the possibility of multiple me - diators that are causally related to each other ( see Section 6 for the method that is designed to deal with such a scenario ) . 3 . Model - based causal mediation analysis In this section , we discuss the functionalities of the mediation package for model - based causal mediation analysis under the assumption of sequential ignorability . Many of these function - alities are described in detail in Imai et al . ( 2010b ) , but the current version of the package accommodates a larger class of statistical models . The model - based causal mediation analysis proceeds in two steps . First , the researcher speci - ﬁes two statistical models , the mediator model for the conditional distribution of the mediator M i given the treatment T i and a set of the observed pre - treatment covariates X i and the out - come model for the conditional distribution of the outcome Y i given T i , M i , and X i . These models are ﬁtted separately and then their ﬁtted objects comprise the main inputs to the mediate function , which computes the estimated ACME and other quantities of interest un - der these models and the sequential ignorability assumption . Since the sequential ignorability assumption is untestable , we recommend that the researchers conduct a sensitivity analy - sis via the medsens function , which can be applied to certain statistical models . We now illustrate these functionalities with an empirical example .

Aster - isks , ∗ , indicate the model combinations that can only be estimated using the nonparametric bootstrap ( i . e . , with the argument boot = TRUE for the mediate function ) . 3 . 1 . Estimation of the average causal mediation eﬀects The mediate function takes various standard model objects ( such as obtained with lm and glm ) , which correspond to mediator and outcome models , and returns the estimates of the average causal mediation eﬀects along with other causal quantities of interest . The output of the mediate function can be passed to the plot and summary functions in order to obtain graphical and numerical summaries , respectively . The mediate function automatically detects the type of models used for the mediator and outcome models and calculates the estimates of the ACME and other quantities of interest via the general algorithms described in Imai et al . ( 2010a ) . Our estimation strategy overcomes the limitation of the standard methods based on the product or diﬀerence of coeﬃcients , which are only appropriate for the analysis of causal mediation eﬀects when both the mediator and outcome models are linear regressions where T i and M i enter the models additively ( e . g . , without interaction ) . In contrast , the algorithms used in the mediation package nest this as a special case and accommodate a greater range of statistical models as shown in Table 1 . We now illustrate the use of the mediate function with an empirical example based on the framing data of Brader , Valentino , and Suhat ( 2008 ) . This data set is a part of the mediation package and can be loaded via the following syntax , R > library ( " mediation " ) R > set . seed ( 2014 ) R > data ( " framing " , package = " mediation " ) A brief description of each variable in the data can be obtained through a help ﬁle , R > ? framing Brader et al . ( 2008 ) conducted a randomized experiment where subjects are exposed to diﬀer - ent media stories about immigration and the authors investigated how their framing inﬂuences attitudes and political behavior regarding immigration policy . They posit anxiety as the me - diating variable for the causal eﬀect of framing on public opinion . We ﬁrst ﬁt the mediator model where the measure of anxiety ( emo ) is modeled as a function of the framing treatment 6 Causal Mediation Analysis ( treat ) and pre - treatment covariates ( age , educ , gender , and income ) . Next , we model the outcome variable , which is a binary variable indicating whether or not the participant agreed to send a letter about immigration policy to his or her member of Congress ( cong _ mesg ) . The explanatory variables of the outcome model include the mediator , treatment status , and the same set of pre - treatment variables as those used in the mediator model . 1 In this example , the treatment is expected to increase the level of respondents’ emotional response , which in turn is hypothesized to make subjects more likely to send a letter to his or her member of Congress . We use the linear regression ﬁt with least squares and the probit regression for the mediator and outcome models , respectively . R > med . fit < - lm ( emo ~ treat + age + educ + gender + income , data = framing ) R > out . fit < - glm ( cong _ mesg ~ emo + treat + age + educ + gender + income , + data = framing , family = binomial ( " probit " ) ) We now use the mediate function to estimate the ACME and ADE . As the inputs to this function , we must specify the model ﬁts ( in this case med . fit and out . fit ) as well as the names of the treatment and mediating variables , which are represented as the arguments treat and mediator , respectively . Here and throughout the rest of this paper , we use a small number of simulations ( sims = 100 ) for the purpose of illustration to calculate the uncertainty estimates , but one may wish to use the default ( 1000 ) or even larger number if the estimates vary too much from one simulation to another . The default simulation type is the quasi - Bayesian Monte Carlo method based on normal approximation ( Imai et al . 2010a ) . We use White’s heteroskedasticity - consistent estimator for the covariance matrix from the sandwich package ( vcovHC ; Zeileis 2006 ) by setting the robustSE argument to TRUE . This argument can be omitted if standard uncertainty estimates are desired . Finally , like most functions in R , the results of the mediate function can be summarized numerically by the summary function , which calculates point estimates , conﬁdence intervals , and the p - values , for the average direct , indirect , and total eﬀects . 2 The syntax is now given as , R > med . out < - mediate ( med . fit , out . fit , treat = " treat " , mediator = " emo " , + robustSE = TRUE , sims = 100 ) R > summary ( med . out ) Causal Mediation Analysis Quasi - Bayesian Confidence Intervals Estimate 95 % CI Lower 95 % CI Upper p - value ACME ( control ) 0 . 0791 0 . 0351 0 . 1501 0 . 00 ACME ( treated ) 0 . 0804 0 . 0367 0 . 1557 0 . 00 ADE ( control ) 0 . 0206 - 0 . 0976 0 . 1158 0 . 70 ADE ( treated ) 0 . 0218 - 0 . 1053 0 . 1226 0 . 70 1 Using diﬀerent sets of pre - treatment covariates for the mediator and outcome models may be justiﬁed depending on the causal relationships assumed for those covariates . See Pearl ( 2014 ) and Imai , Keele , Tingley , and Yamamoto ( 2014 ) . 2 Note that the results will be slightly diﬀerent in each run of mediate because of Monte Carlo errors , especially when sims is set to a small number . If exact reproduction of results is desired , users can set a speciﬁc randomness seed ( set . seed ) before calling the mediate function .

In this example , the estimated ACMEs are statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero but the estimated average direct and total eﬀects are not . The results suggest that the treatment in the framing experiment may have increased emotional response , which in turn made subjects more likely to send a message to his or her member of Congress . Here , since the outcome is binary all estimated eﬀects are expressed as the increase in probability that the subject sent a message to his or her Congress person .

As expected , the results are largely the same . In general , as long as computing power is not an issue , analysts should 8 Causal Mediation Analysis −0 . 1 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 l l l l l TotalEffect ADE ACME Figure 2 : Graphical display of results from the mediate function . estimate conﬁdence intervals via the bootstrap with more than 1000 resamples , which is the default number of simulations . Two types of methods for calculating bootstrap - based conﬁdence intervals are available via the boot . ci . type argument . The basic percentile intervals are calculated by default or setting the argument to " perc " . The bias - corrected and accelerated ( BCa ) intervals are computed if the argument is set to " bca " ( see DiCiccio and Efron 1996 , for the deﬁnition of the method ) . The latter has better asymptotic properties and is often recommended for the estimation of mediation eﬀects ( Preacher and Hayes 2008 ) . As an alternative to the numerical summary , using the output from the mediate function as the input to the plot command provides a graphical summary of the three parameters ( indirect , direct , and total eﬀects ) along with their conﬁdence intervals . Figure 2 shows the result of plotting the med . out object . 3 Treatment and mediator interaction It is possible that the ACME takes diﬀerent values depending on the baseline treatment status . In such a situation , the researcher can add an interaction term between the treatment and mediator to the outcome model . Then , the mediate function automatically detects the change in the speciﬁcation and explicitly estimates the ACME conditional on treatment status . 4 In the output given below , the estimated ACME now varies with treatment status . R > med . fit < - lm ( emo ~ treat + age + educ + gender + income , data = framing ) 3 Users may make further modiﬁcations to the plot via standard plot options , including changes to the labels . 4 When the outcome model is nonlinear , the ACME and direct eﬀect estimates will diﬀer between the treatment and control conditions even when the model does not include an interaction term . The summary output in such cases includes average values of these two estimates to ease interpretation of the results .

Each is stored as part of the model’s output . This includes vectors of the simulation output for all quantities of interests ( see ? mediate for details ) , which can be used for a variety of tasks , such as more intensive plotting . Missing data Our simulation - based approach to the estimation of mediation eﬀects enables users to deal with missing data via standard multiple imputation procedures in a straightforward fashion . 10 Causal Mediation Analysis The mediation package includes a pair of utility functions – mediations and amelidiate – to facilitate such analysis . First , users simulate multiple data sets using their preferred imputation software . Next , run mediate on each data set by simply passing the data sets through mediations . Next , pass the output of mediations to the amelidiate function , which combines the components of the output from mediations into a format that can be analyzed with the standard summary and plot commands . 5 Alternatively , users can manually run mediate on their imputed data sets and simply stack the vectors of quantities they are interested in , and use basic functions like quantile to calculate conﬁdence intervals . 3 . 2 . Moderated mediation One new important feature of the mediate function is the ability to study moderated me - diation . Often analysts hypothesize that the magnitude of the ACME depends on ( or is moderated by ) a pre - treatment covariate . Such a pre - treatment covariate is called a moder - ator . In the framing example , the ACME may be much stronger among older respondents than younger ones . In other words , the ACME may be moderated by age . There are two alternative routes to the analysis of moderated mediation with the mediation package . The ﬁrst method involves alteration of both the statistical models as well as the syntax for the mediate function . First , the mediator and outcome models should contain the moderator and its interaction terms with respect to the treatment and mediating variables that are theoretically justiﬁed . For example , we may modify the previous models as follows , R > med . fit < - lm ( emo ~ treat * age + educ + gender + income , data = framing ) R > out . fit < - glm ( cong _ mesg ~ emo + treat * age + emo * age + educ + gender + + income , data = framing , family = binomial ( " probit " ) ) Once the two models are ﬁtted , the researcher must specify the levels of the moderator at which eﬀects will be calculated by the mediate function . 6 In the current example , this can be done by setting the age covariate to a speciﬁc value . To allow the mediation eﬀects to be moderated by age , we set the value of age to be 20 in one model and 60 in another model . More complicated moderated mediation involving multiple moderators could be speciﬁed by expanding the list of the covariates . R > med . age20 < - mediate ( med . fit , out . fit , treat = " treat " , + mediator = " emo " , covariates = list ( age = 20 ) , sims = 100 ) R > med . age60 < - mediate ( med . fit , out . fit , treat = " treat " , + mediator = " emo " , covariates = list ( age = 60 ) , sims = 100 ) R > summary ( med . age20 ) Causal Mediation Analysis Quasi - Bayesian Confidence Intervals 5 Note that amelidiate does not support some models and features yet ; see ? amelidiate for details . 6 If the models include moderator - treatment interactions and yet this option is not speciﬁed , then the resulting ACME and direct eﬀect estimates will simply be averages over the empirical distribution of the covariates .

In the ﬁrst output , the average mediation eﬀect is estimated for those who are 20 years old . In contrast , the second output applies to those who are 60 years old . The second approach to moderated mediation consists of directly testing the statistical sig - niﬁcance of the diﬀerence in the ACME and ADE between two chosen levels of pre - treatment 12 Causal Mediation Analysis covariates . This analysis is conducted via the test . modmed function . For example , the fol - lowing syntax can be used to test whether the ACME and ADE signiﬁcantly diﬀer between the subjects who are 20 years old and those who are 60 years old .

Note that the initial mediate call does not require a large number of simulation draws , for the actual calculation of uncertainty for the test happens within the test . modmed function . 3 . 3 . Non - binary treatment variables Experimental manipulations are often complex and go beyond simple treatment and control conditions . In the framing experiment , for example , the researchers actually used a 2 × 2 factorial design . That is , each subject was exposed to two diﬀerent binary treatments , yielding four diﬀerent experimental manipulations . In the analysis presented above , we have focused on a comparison of one of these conditions relative to the other three conditions . The mediate function , however , has the capability to handle more complex experimental contrasts , which can be represented by a non - binary treatment variable . Here , instead of using the binary treat variable , we use a variable named cond , which records which of the four conditions the subject was randomly exposed to . Using the control . value and treat . value options , the user can calculate the speciﬁc contrast of interest . For example , the comparison between the second and third conditions can be done with the following code .

In the case of a continuous treatment variable , the researcher would specify two values of the treatment to make the contrast ( Imai et al . 2010a ) . For example , the causal mediation eﬀects can be deﬁned for any two levels of the treatment , δ i ( t ; t 1 , t 0 ) ≡ Y i ( t , M i ( t 1 ) ) − Y i ( t , M i ( t 0 ) ) , ( 7 ) where t 1 (cid:54) = t 0 . The corresponding average causal mediation eﬀect is deﬁned as ¯ δ ( t ; t 1 , t 0 ) ≡ E ( δ i ( t ; t 1 , t 0 ) ) . Thus , the researcher can set control . value to t 0 and treat . value to t 1 . The researcher may also vary the value of t 1 , while ﬁxing the base line value of t 0 , to examine how the ACME changes as the function of t 1 . 3 . 4 . Sensitivity analysis for sequential ignorability Sequential ignorability is a strong assumption , and therefore a sensitivity analysis is recom - mended . The mediation package allows the researcher to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the possible existence of unobserved pre - treatment covariates . Speciﬁcally , the output of the mediate function can be passed to the medsens function , which then computes the values of causal quantities as a function of sensitivity parameters . Both summary and plot functions are available for sensitivity analysis , and they display the results in a tabular and graphical form , respectively . Since derivation of sensitivity formulas must be done on a case - by - case basis , the range of options for conducting sensitivity analyses is somewhat limited . Table 2 gives the model combinations currently supported by the medsens function . In our running example , after computing the ACME , we conduct a sensitivity analysis by passing the object from mediate to the medsens function . We ﬁrst choose as the sensitivity parameter the correlation ρ between the residuals of the mediator and outcome regressions 14 Causal Mediation Analysis ( Imai et al . 2010a , c ) . If there exist unobserved pre - treatment confounders which aﬀect both the mediator and the outcome , we expect that the sequential ignorability assumption is vio - lated and ρ is no longer zero . The sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the value of ρ and examining how the estimated ACME changes . The following syntax can be used to conduct this analysis , R > med . fit < - lm ( emo ~ treat + age + educ + gender + income , data = framing ) R > out . fit < - glm ( cong _ mesg ~ emo + treat + age + educ + gender + income , + data = framing , family = binomial ( " probit " ) ) R > med . out < - mediate ( med . fit , out . fit , treat = " treat " , mediator = " emo " , + robustSE = TRUE , sims = 100 ) R > sens . out < - medsens ( med . out , rho . by = 0 . 1 , effect . type = " indirect " , + sims = 100 ) R > summary ( sens . out ) Mediation Sensitivity Analysis : Average Mediation Effect Sensitivity Region : ACME for Control Group Rho ACME ( control ) 95 % CI Lower 95 % CI Upper R ^ 2 _ M * R ^ 2 _ Y * R ^ 2 _ M ~ R ^ 2 _ Y ~ [ 1 , ] 0 . 3 0 . 0058 - 0 . 0055 0 . 0206 0 . 09 0 . 0493 [ 2 , ] 0 . 4 - 0 . 0095 - 0 . 0285 0 . 0024 0 . 16 0 . 0877 Rho at which ACME for Control Group = 0 : 0 . 3 R ^ 2 _ M * R ^ 2 _ Y * at which ACME for Control Group = 0 : 0 . 09 R ^ 2 _ M ~ R ^ 2 _ Y ~ at which ACME for Control Group = 0 : 0 . 0493 Sensitivity Region : ACME for Treatment Group Rho ACME ( treated ) 95 % CI Lower 95 % CI Upper R ^ 2 _ M * R ^ 2 _ Y * R ^ 2 _ M ~ R ^ 2 _ Y ~ [ 1 , ] 0 . 3 0 . 0066 - 0 . 0069 0 . 0222 0 . 09 0 . 0493 [ 2 , ] 0 . 4 - 0 . 0118 - 0 . 0351 0 . 0026 0 . 16 0 . 0877 Rho at which ACME for Treatment Group = 0 : 0 . 3 R ^ 2 _ M * R ^ 2 _ Y * at which ACME for Treatment Group = 0 : 0 . 09 R ^ 2 _ M ~ R ^ 2 _ Y ~ at which ACME for Treatment Group = 0 : 0 . 0493 where rho . by = 0 . 1 speciﬁes that ρ will vary from − 0 . 9 to 0 . 9 by 0 . 1 increments , and effect . type = " indirect " means that sensitivity analysis is conducted for the ACME . Al - ternatively , specifying effect . type = " direct " performs sensitivity analysis for the ADE and " both " returns sensitivity analysis for the ACME and ADE . The tabular output from the summary function displays the values of ρ at which the conﬁdence intervals contain zero for the ACME . For both the control and treatment conditions , the conﬁdence intervals for the ACME contain zero when ρ equals 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 . An alternative but mathematically equivalent way to conduct sensitivity is in terms of the product of R 2 ( or coeﬃcients of determination ) statistics from the mediator and outcome models .

Results as a function of ρ . in more detail elsewhere ( Imai et al . 2010c , 2011 , 2010a ) , the ﬁrst row captures the point at which the ACME is 0 as a function of the proportions of residual variance in the mediator and outcome explained by the hypothesized unobserved confounder . The second line uses the total variance instead of residual variance . We use R ∗ 2 for residual variance and ˜ R 2 for total variance . For example , when the product of the original variance explained by the omitted confounding is . 049 the point estimate for ACME would be 0 . A graphical display is often more intuitive and useful for the sensitivity analysis , especially for the R 2 interpretations . This can be done , as before , by passing the object from the medsens function to the plot function . The plot function allows the researcher to graphically summarize the results of sensitivity analysis either in terms of ρ ( sens . par = " rho " ) or R 2 statistics ( sens . par = " R2 " ) . R > plot ( sens . out , sens . par = " rho " , main = " Anxiety " , ylim = c ( - 0 . 2 , 0 . 2 ) ) When using the R 2 statistic version of sensitivity analysis the user must specify whether the hypothesized confounder aﬀects the mediator and outcome variables in the same direction or in diﬀerent directions . This matters because the sensitivity analysis is in terms of the product of R 2 statistics . In the current example , we assume that the confounder inﬂuences both variables in the same direction by setting sign . prod = " positive " ( rather than sign . prod = " negative " ) . Here , we plot the total variance version of the sensitivity analysis . The bold line represents the various combinations of the R 2 statistics where the ACME would be 0 ( in this case the product equals . 049 ) . The graphical display also presents the corresponding contour plots for other products of the R 2 statistics .

Causal mediation analysis of multilevel data As of version 4 . 2 , the mediation package supports causal mediation analysis of multilevel data via the lmer and glmer functions in the lme4 package ( Bates , Maechler , Bolker , and Walker 2014 ) . Researchers are often interested in analyzing data where individual observations such as students , patients , and employees are clustered within groups such as schools , hospitals , and companies . Data on individuals may be correlated within groups , but also diﬀerent groups may have diﬀerent data generating processes . Multilevel models take into account such heterogeneity within and between groups simultaneously . Mediation analysis of multilevel data can be categorized into various types depending on whether the treatment , mediator and outcome variables are each measured at the individual or group level ( see Krull and MacKinnon 2001 ; Zhang , Zyphur , and Preacher 2009 ) . Regard - less of these types , researchers can use the mediate function to analyze multilevel data by choosing appropriate statistical models for the mediator and outcome variables . In this sec - tion , we illustrate the use of our package for multilevel data by focusing on two types of data structure : ( 1 ) the treatment is assigned at the group level whereas the mediator and outcome are measured at the individual level , and ( 2 ) both the treatment and mediator are group - level variables while the outcome is recorded at the individual level . Other combinations of data levels can be handled via straightforward modiﬁcations to the syntax used in these examples . 7 To illustrate the usage , we analyze data from the Education Longitudinal Study ( 2002 ) 8 where 7 We note that as of the writing of this article the lme4 package is known to generate slightly diﬀerent random number draws across computing platforms ( Windows , Mac , etc . ) for a given seed which given the simulation method used can generate small numerical diﬀerences in some cases . 8 To protect the anonymity of the individuals involved in the study , we generated hypothetical individual - level variables via multiple imputation . The results reported below do not take into account any statistical uncertainty due to the imputation procedure and should thus be regarded only as illustration . The original data can be obtained from Education Longitudinal Study ( ELS ) , 2002 : Base Year ( ICPSR 4275 ) by the United States Department of Education , National Center of Education Statistics . http : / / www . icpsr . umich . edu / icpsrweb / ICPSR / studies / 4275 . Journal of Statistical Software 17 students are clustered within schools . The mediation package contains two related data sets . The student data set contains both student - and school - level variables organized at the student level . The school data set only contains school - level variables , such that the number of observations in this data set equals the number of unique levels of the school identiﬁer variable ( SCH _ ID ) in the student data set . As explained below in detail , the group - level data set ( school ) is required only when we analyze the data where both the treatment and the mediator are group - level variables . 4 . 1 . Group - level treatment and individual - level mediator First , consider the case where the treatment is a group - level variable but the mediator and outcome variables are measured at the individual level . In this case , we only need the student - level data set , R > data ( " student " , package = " mediation " ) Here , we analyze as an example whether a school is Catholic or not ( catholic ) aﬀects a student’s likelihood of ﬁghting ( fight ) at the school , and hypothesize that a student’s emo - tional attachment to the school ( attachment ) functions as the causal mechanism . That is , we postulate that students in a Catholic school may have an increased sense of attachment to their school , which may in turn decrease their likelihood of getting involved in a ﬁght . We model these causal processes using the following hierarchical logistic - normal regression model for the ( binary ) mediator , P ( M ij = 1 ) = logit − 1 (cid:16) α j + γ (cid:62) X ij (cid:17) , α j = α + βT j + ε j , where i and j are student and school indicators , respectively , ε j is a normally distributed group - level stochastic error with mean zero , and X ij represents the vector of student - level pre - treatment covariates ( gender , income and pared ) . Likewise , we use the following model for the ( binary ) outcome , P ( Y ij = 1 ) = logit − 1 (cid:16) λ j + φ j M ij + ζ (cid:62) X ij (cid:17) , λ j = λ + ψT j + υ j , φ j = φ + θT j + ν j , where υ j and ν j are group - level errors jointly bivariate normally distributed with mean zero . If desired , more complex data generating processes can be assumed ( with appropriate changes in the syntax for the models below ) , such as allowing for group - varying slopes on the treatment variable or incorporating group - level pre - treatment covariates . Now , note that these two models can be equivalently written as follows , P ( M ij = 1 ) = logit − 1 (cid:16) ( α + ε j ) + βT j + γ (cid:62) X ij (cid:17) , and P ( Y ij = 1 ) = logit − 1 (cid:16) ( λ + υ j ) + ψT j + ( φ + ν j ) M ij + θT j M ij + ζ (cid:62) X ij (cid:17) , which can both be estimated via the glmer function , 18 Causal Mediation Analysis R > library ( " lme4 " ) R > med . fit < - glmer ( attachment ~ catholic + gender + income + pared + + ( 1 | SCH _ ID ) , family = binomial ( link = " logit " ) , data = student ) R > out . fit < - glmer ( fight ~ catholic * attachment + gender + income + + pared + ( 1 + attachment | SCH _ ID ) , family = binomial ( link = " logit " ) , + data = student ) These ﬁtted objects can then be fed into the mediate function in the usual manner .

The results suggest that the school - level treatment ( catholic ) increases the value of the individual - level mediator ( attachment ) , which in turn decreases the value of the outcome ( fight ) , and also that the treatment decreases the value of the outcome directly or in diﬀerent causal paths . 4 . 2 . Group - level treatment and mediator Next , consider the case where both the treatment and mediator are group - level variables while Journal of Statistical Software 19 the outcome is measured at the individual level . In this case , we need the second data set containing only the group - level variables , R > data ( " school " , package = " mediation " ) Note that the group - level data set must also contain the group indicator used in the individual - level data set under the same variable name ( SCH _ ID in our running example ) . The current version of mediate also requires that the model frames of the mediator and outcome models contain the exact same set of groups , which becomes important when each model contains diﬀerent covariates and some groups drop out of the model frames due to missingness . As an illustration , we investigate the eﬀects of school - level economic condition ( free ; pro - portion of students who receive free lunch ) on students’ tardiness ( late ; days per semester they are late for school ) . As a causal path , we postulate that school - level poverty negatively impacts school - level morale ( smorale ) , which in turn increases tardiness among students . We use the following hierarchical regressions to model the hypothesized causal mechanism , M j = α + βT j + γ (cid:62) V j + ε j , Y ij = λ j + ζ (cid:62) X ij + υ ij , λ j = λ + θT j + φM j + κ (cid:62) V j + ν j , where V j is the vector of school - level covariates ( catholic and coed ) , X ij is the vector of student - level covariates ( gender , income and pared ) , and ε j , υ ij and ν j are each normally distributed stochastic errors with mean zero . Again , more complex models can be used ( e . g . , adding a treatment - mediator interaction term to the outcome model ) if desired . In this case , the mediator model is solely composed of the school - level variables and ﬁxed coeﬃcients . Hence the mediator model can be ﬁt via the lm function using the school - level data set , R > med . fit < - lm ( smorale ~ free + catholic + coed , data = school ) and the outcome model , which can be equivalently written as , Y ij = ( λ + υ j ) + θT j + φM j + ( γ (cid:62) + κ (cid:62) ) V j + ζ (cid:62) X ij + υ ij , can be estimated with the lmer function and the student - level data set , R > out . fit < - lmer ( late ~ free + smorale + catholic + coed + gender + + income + pared + ( 1 | SCH _ ID ) , data = student ) These ﬁtted model objects can then be passed to the mediate function . Since the treatment variable is a continuous variable , we use the values of 3 and 4 as the control and treatment values , respectively , and estimate the quantities of interest in terms of these values .

We conclude this section by providing more details about the current version of our package for multilevel mediation analysis . First , the summary function can produce estimates of group - speciﬁc eﬀects by adding the output argument , which can be set to either " bygroup " or " byeffect " . In the above example , summary ( med . out , output = " bygroup " ) produces the output organized by schools , and summary ( med . out , output = " byeffect " ) produces the output organized into quantities of interest . Group - speciﬁc eﬀects can also be graphically displayed by plot ( med . out , group . plots = TRUE ) . Second , the mediate function allows researchers to specify diﬀerent groups in the mediator and outcome models ( nested or non - nested ) . For example , it may be reasonable to assume that the mediator variable is correlated within schools but the outcome variable is clustered at the district level . In such a case , the group . out argument for the mediate function allows researchers to choose the group into which the estimated group - speciﬁc eﬀects are aggregated . The current version of the package also has some limitations for multilevel mediation analysis . First , it only allows for one group type for each model . For example , it is not possible to let coeﬃcients of the mediator ( or outcome ) model vary not only for schools but also for districts . Second , the bootstrap - based uncertainty estimates for the mediation eﬀects are not yet available . Third , the medsens function for sensitivity analysis cannot be applied to the mediate outputs based on multilevel regression models . Future updates may add these missing functionalities . Finally , it is important to reiterate that the validity of the estimates crucially rests on Assumption 1 , regardless of whether hierarchical models are ﬁtted to the data or not . Journal of Statistical Software 21 5 . Design - based causal mediation analysis An alternative approach to model - based inference is to use diﬀerent research designs that are speciﬁcally designed for identifying causal mechanisms . Imai et al . ( 2013 ) propose several such designs and describe the assumptions required for the identiﬁcation of causal mediation eﬀects under each of the designs . In this section we brieﬂy illustrate how to use our software to calculate the estimates of the quantities of interest under each design . 5 . 1 . Single experiment design The single experiment design randomizes the treatment variable and measures the mediating and outcome variables . In Section 3 , we discussed estimation functions that can be used with parametric and semi - parametric models . If the researchers wish to pursue a completely non - parametric approach the mediation package oﬀers two options via the mediate . sed function . First , the researchers can continue to make the sequential ignorability assumption and non - parametrically estimate the ACME . This approach works only when the mediator variable is discrete . Second , the sharp bounds on the ACME can be computed under the assumption that only the treatment is randomized . Imai et al . ( 2013 ) derive the bounds in the case with all binary variables ( treatment , mediator , and outcome ) and show that , unfortunately , the bounds are never informative about the sign of the ACME ( i . e . , they always include 0 ) . Most mediation analysis proceeds under the sequential ignorability assumption . Those anal - yses also tend to be model - based , but they need not be . Imai et al . ( 2010c ) outline a design - based estimator for the ACME for when the mediator is discrete . This estimator for the ACME is fully nonparametric . One drawback to this estimator is that one can encounter mediator - treatment combinations for which there are no subjects because of data sparsity . Standard error calculation for this estimator is based on either the Delta method or the nonparametric bootstrap . The mediate . sed function requires the names of the outcome , mediator , and treatment vari - ables , along with the name of the data frame that contains these variables . When SI = TRUE , the function will return the point estimates under the sequential ignorability assumption , and otherwise the results will be a set of sharp bounds for the ACME . The method for inference also diﬀers slightly from the mediate function . When boot = TRUE the bootstrap is used , but when boot = FALSE , the Delta method is used to compute standard errors . Below , we present an example using the framing data from Brader et al . ( 2008 ) . The treatment variable is the same as before , i . e . , treat , and the mediator is anx , which refers to a subject’s reported level of anxiety . This four level measure is one component of the emo variable that was previously used as the mediator and in the data all treatment - mediator combinations are present ( a requirement for the estimator ) . The outcome variable in this example is english and measures on a four point scale how much someone supports English only laws , from strongly support to strongly oppose . Note that the mediate . sed function only takes numeric variables as arguments . Variables that are stored as factors must be converted to numeric variables as we show below .

In this example both ¯ δ ( 0 ) and ¯ δ ( 1 ) are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0 . 5 . 2 . Parallel design An alternative to the single experiment design is the “parallel design” proposed by Imai et al . ( 2013 ) . In this design there are two separate experiments that are run in parallel with subjects randomly assigned to one of the two experiments . The ﬁrst experiment follows the single experiment design . In the second experiment , subjects are randomly assigned to treatment or control . Then , a randomly selected set of subjects in each condition is assigned a value of the mediating variable . A key assumption of this design is that the manipulation of the mediating variable is possible and has no direct eﬀect on the outcome variable . Under the parallel design , the ACME is not point identiﬁed without an additional assumption . The mediation package oﬀers two options via the mediate . pd function . First , the researchers can assume no interaction between the treatment and mediating variables by setting NINT = TRUE . In this case , the mediate . pd function will calculate the ACME along with its boot - strap conﬁdence intervals . Second , the assumption of no - interaction between treatment and mediator can be dropped via NINT = FALSE , and then the sharp bounds can be calculated for the ACME . These bounds may be informative about the sign ( i . e . , do not cover 0 ) and are always narrower compared to the bounds under the single experiment design where the only assumption is randomization of the treatment . For illustration , we simulated data based on the media framing experiment by Brader et al . ( 2008 ) by creating a population distribution of potential mediators and outcomes ( see Imai et al . ( 2013 ) for more details ) . We then sampled 1000 cases from this distribution . In this example , out represents the outcome variable ( immigration attitudes ) , med represents the mediator ( anxiety ) , and ttt represents the treatment . All variables are binary . The vari - able manip represents whether the subject had the mediator manipulated ( − 1 if mediator is manipulated down , 0 if no manipulation , and 1 if manipulated up ) . First , the no - interaction assumption is made and options for the number of bootstrap simulations and conﬁdence inter - vals are speciﬁed . In this case , the mediation eﬀect is estimated at − 0 . 12 with 95 % conﬁdence intervals spanning [ − 0 . 21 , − 0 . 03 ] . In the second example , the no interaction assumption is Journal of Statistical Software 23 dropped and the sharp bounds are calculated to span [ − 0 . 3 , 0 . 3 ] for the control condition and [ 0 . 2 , 0 . 77 ] for the treatment condition .

Parallel encouragement design In many situations , perfect manipulation of the mediating variable may be diﬃcult . In the parallel encouragement design , subjects are split into two separate experiments . The ﬁrst experiment is based on the single experiment design . In the second experiment subjects are randomly assigned to the treatment and control conditions and then , within each condition , a subset of subjects are randomly encouraged to have a high or low value of the mediator . Both the mediator and outcome variable are then measured . The mediate . ped function reports the sharp bounds on two estimands . First is the ACME and second is the ACME for the “compliers” who respond to the encouragement . The calculation of these bounds is accomplished via a standard linear programming approach as discussed in Imai et al . ( 2013 ) . The parallel encouragement design requires the analyst to speciﬁcally design some form of encouragement . The functionality of the mediate . ped closely mirrors that of mediate . sed . The key diﬀerence is that the analyst must also include an indicator for encouragement . For illustration , we simulated data based on the media framing experiment by Brader et al . ( 2008 ) . 24 Causal Mediation Analysis We did this by creating a population distribution of potential mediators and outcomes , and compliance types . We then randomly draw the joint probabilities of the causal types and assign an encouragement status for those in the encouragement condition ( see Imai et al . ( 2013 ) for more details ) . Based on the encouragement condition and encouragement status ( enc , − 1 if mediator is encouraged down , 0 if no encouragement , and 1 if encouraged up ) , the observed binary values of the mediator ( med . enc ) and outcome ( out . enc ) are determined . Using this simulated data we can then pass it to the mediate . ped function for the parallel encouragement design .

We see that for the compliers , the sharp bounds on ACME under the treatment condition are informative as they do not cross 0 . 5 . 4 . Crossover encouragement design The fourth experimental design included in the mediation package is the crossover encour - agement design . Under this design , subjects are exposed to two experiments , with each subject participating in each experiment . In the ﬁrst experiment , the treatment variable is randomized and the mediator and outcome variables observed . In the second experiment , the treatment condition is set to the opposite value from the ﬁrst period , but an encouragement is given to a randomly selected set of subjects so that the mediator variable will take on the value observed in the ﬁrst experiment . Under this design , the ACME is point identiﬁed for the set of subjects that are able to have their mediator value manipulated ( known as “pliable units” ) . A crucial identiﬁcation assumption is that the ﬁrst experiment does not inﬂuence behavior in the second experiment . For this experimental design the mediate . ced function calculates point estimates and the bootstrap is used for estimates of uncertainty . For illustration , we simulated data based on the identiﬁcation assumptions necessary for this design . Y2 is the value of the outcome variable in the second experiment , M1 and M2 are the mediator values for the ﬁrst and second experiment , T1 is the value of the treatment in the ﬁrst experiment , and Z indicates whether the subject’s mediator value in the second experiment is encouraged to take on the value opposite to that observed in the ﬁrst experiment . All variables are binary .

These estimates apply only to the pliable units . In this example , both values of the ACME are positive but the 95 % conﬁdence intervals overlap with zero . 6 . Analysis of causally dependent multiple mechanisms Our discussion so far has focused on a single mediator , M . Frequently , however , researchers take measurements for more than one mediating variable . Accounting for alternative mecha - nisms is indeed crucial for the identiﬁcation of the mechanism of primary interest , especially when such mechanisms are causally not independent . This is because the alternative depen - dent mediators aﬀect both the mediator of primary interest and the outcome variable , which , by deﬁnition , violates the sequential ignorability assumption ( Assumption 1 ) . 6 . 1 . The methodology Imai and Yamamoto ( 2013 ) develop methods for dealing with multiple mediators based on the current framework . We brieﬂy review this framework . First , in the case of causally unrelated multiple mediators , it turns out that there is no need to fundamentally modify the current framework or estimation procedure . To see this , suppose that there are multiple causally unrelated mediators , and one is interested in estimating the causal mediation eﬀects with respect to each of them . In this scenario , note that for each mediator , the other mediators are neither pre - treatment nor post - treatment confounders ( since by construction they have no causal eﬀect on the mediator of interest ) . Therefore , one can consistently estimate the desired eﬀects by simply applying the mediate function successively for the mediators as explained in Section 3 , ignoring the existence of the other , causally unrelated , mediators each time . Likewise , sensitivity analysis via the medsens function can be conducted for the mediators of interest in the usual fashion . The mediations function can be useful for such analysis . Second , when the multiple mediators are causally related ( or equivalently , when one mediator acts as a post - treatment confounder for the other mediator on the outcome ) , we need to expand the notational framework , and the analysis requires new assumptions . Let W i ( t ) denote the vector of the potential values of those alternative mediators given treatment status 26 Causal Mediation Analysis t . To allow the causal dependence of both the primary mediator and outcome on W , we write the potential mediator and outcome as M i ( t , w ) and Y i ( t , m , w ) , respectively . The observed values of these potential response variables can then be expressed as W i = W i ( T i ) , M i = M i ( T i , W i ( T i ) ) , and Y i = Y i ( T i , M i ( T i , W i ( T i ) ) , W i ( T i ) ) . The causal mediation eﬀects can now be re - expressed using this notation as , δ i ( t ) = Y i ( t , M i ( 1 , W i ( 1 ) ) , W i ( t ) ) − Y i ( t , M i ( 0 , W i ( 0 ) ) , W i ( t ) ) , for t = 0 , 1 . Note that this quantity represents the treatment eﬀects that are transmitted through the mediator of primary interest M i , irrespective of whether they also come through the alternative mediators W i or not . Therefore , the quantity of interest remains unchanged from the previous sections , except that the existence of the other mediators are now explicitly taken into consideration . The framework of Imai and Yamamoto ( 2013 ) is based on the following varying coeﬃcient linear structural equations model , M i ( t , w ) = α 2 + β 2 i t + ξ (cid:62) 2 i w + µ (cid:62) 2 i tw + λ (cid:62) 2 i x + ε 2 i , ( 8 ) Y i ( t , m , w ) = α 3 + β 3 i t + γ i m + κ i tm + ξ (cid:62) 3 i w + µ (cid:62) 3 i tw + λ (cid:62) 3 i x i + ε 3 i , ( 9 ) where E ( ε 2 i ) = E ( ε 3 i ) = 0 without loss of generality . Although these equations may resemble a traditional linear structural equations model at a ﬁrst glance , they are considerably more ﬂexible because the coeﬃcients are all allowed to vary arbitrarily across individual units . Imai and Yamamoto ( 2013 ) propose two strategies for the analysis of the average causal medi - ation eﬀects , ¯ δ ( t ) ≡ E ( δ i ( t ) ) . First , it can be shown that the ACME is point identiﬁed under the above model and sequential ignorability ( a weaker version allowing for post - treatment confounding ; see Imai and Yamamoto ) if the homogeneous interaction assumption is satisﬁed . This additional assumption is formally written as , Y i ( 1 , m , W i ( 1 ) ) − Y i ( 0 , m , W i ( 0 ) ) = B i + Cm for any m . The assumption states that the degree of interaction between the treatment and the primary mediator is constant across individual units , which may or may not be plausible depending on the empirical context . Second , when this assumption is violated , one can express the sharp bounds on the ACME as functions of a parameter representing the degree of the violation , and conduct a sensitivity analysis . The sensitivity parameter here is the standard deviation of the coeﬃcient on the treatment - mediator interaction term , i . e . , σ ≡ (cid:112) VAR ( κ i ) , and the expression for the sharp bounds are given in Imai and Yamamoto ( 2013 , Footnote 6 ) . Researchers can then analyze robustness to the potential violation of the homogeneous interaction assumption by examining how the location and width of the bounds vary as σ changes . The sensitivity analysis can also be formulated in terms of two alternative sensitivity parame - ters , both based on coeﬃcients of determination as in the single mediator case ( see Section 3 . 4 ) . Speciﬁcally , we use the proportion of the residual or total variance of the outcome variable Journal of Statistical Software 27 that would be explained by allowing the heterogeneity in the treatment - mediator interaction in the outcome model . These parameters are formally deﬁned as R 2 ∗ = VAR ( ˜ κ i T i M i ) VAR ( η 3 i ( T i , M i , W i ) ) and (cid:101) R 2 = VAR ( ˜ κ i T i M i ) VAR ( Y i ) , ( 10 ) where ˜ κ i = κ i − E ( κ i ) . Researchers may ﬁnd these parameters to be easier to interpret in substantive terms , as they represent how important it would be to incorporate the interaction heterogeneity in order to explain the variation in the outcome model . Imai and Yamamoto ( 2013 ) show that these parameters have a one - to - one relationship with σ , implying that the ACME can also be written as a function of R 2 ∗ or (cid:101) R 2 . 6 . 2 . Single experiment design The above framework has been implemented in the mediation package as the multimed func - tion . The function takes a data frame containing the necessary variables ( outcome , primary mediator , alternative mediator , treatment , and pre - treatment covariates if any ) and outputs an object of class ‘ multimed ’ , a list consisting of estimated bounds along with uncertainty es - timates . In the current version , only a single post - treatment confounder is allowed , although the theoretical framework accommodates more than one such confounder . The functionality of multimed diﬀers in important ways from mediate . First , there is not a separate function for sensitivity analysis . Instead , a sensitivity analysis is conducted within the function along with the estimates of the mediation eﬀects . Second , the arguments for the multimed function are rather diﬀerent . Here , the names of the outcome ( outcome ) , ﬁrst mediator ( med . main ) , second mediator ( med . alt ) and treatment ( treat ) variables are passed to the function along with a vector of the names of the pre - treatment covariates to condition on ( covariates ) . In the multimed function , inference can only be done with the nonparametric bootstrap . To illustrate the use of the function we revisit the media framing example in Section 3 . Here , we use a diﬀerent outcome variable immigr , which is a ﬁve category measure of whether immigration should be increased or decreased ( treated as a continuous measure for the purpose of illustration ) . The main mediator is the same composite measure of anxiety , emo , and the treatment and pre - treatment covariates are deﬁned as before . We now introduce an alternative mediator p _ harm , which is an eight category measure of the perceived economic harm of immigrants . The reasoning behind the inclusion of this variable is that the media framing treatment may also aﬀect participants’ opinion about immigrants by changing their factual belief about the economic impact of increased immigration , which may also aﬀect the level of anxiety and therefore confound the mediator - outcome relationship .

The ﬁrst table shows the estimated ACME and total treatment eﬀect and their conﬁdence intervals ( default at 95 % ) under the homogeneous interaction assumption . Three variants of the ACME are shown : the ACME conditional on the treatment group , the control group , and the weighted average of the two with the weights being equal to the proportions of the treatment and control groups . The second table shows key summary results from the sensitivity analysis with respect to possible heterogeneity in treatment - mediator interactions . Speciﬁcally , the table presents the values of σ ( column 1 ) , R 2 ∗ ( column 3 ) , and (cid:101) R 2 ( column 5 ) at which the estimated ACMEs equal zero . The remaining columns ( 2 , 4 and 6 ) show those values for the conﬁdence bands of the three ACMEs . The results from the multimed function can also be analyzed graphically using the plot function . One can produce two types of plots , corresponding to the two tables in the summary output . First , one can plot the point estimates under the homogeneous interaction assumption by setting the type argument to " point " , as shown below . The output is in Figure 5 . R > plot ( m . med , type = " point " ) Second , the results from the sensitivity analysis with respect to σ , R 2 ∗ or (cid:101) R 2 can be plotted . In this case , the type argument can be used to specify which parameter ( s ) the estimated ACME should be plotted against . The possible values are " sigma " , " R2 - residual " , or " R2 - total " . One can also choose the types of the ACME from " treated " , " control " and " average " via the tgroup argument . In the example below , we plot the estimated ACME for both treatment and control conditions as a function of σ and (cid:101) R 2 . The output is in Figure 6 . R > plot ( m . med , type = c ( " sigma " , " R2 - total " ) , + tgroup = c ( " treated " , " control " ) ) 6 . 3 . Parallel design Imai and Yamamoto ( 2013 , Section 7 ) show that the above framework can also be applied to the data collected under the parallel design . As discussed in Section 5 . 2 , the parallel design consists of two separate experiments to which subjects are randomly selected . In one experiment , only the treatment is randomized and the researcher observes the mediator and Journal of Statistical Software 29 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 Point Estimate Average Causal Mediation Effects l l l l T o t a l ( t ) C on t r o l ( d 0 ) T r ea t ed ( d 1 ) A v e r age ( d ) Figure 5 : Graphical summary of the results from the multimed function under the homoge - neous interaction assumption . outcome variables , whereas in the other experiment both the treatment and mediator are randomly manipulated and the outcome variable is measured and recorded . Unlike the single experiment design , one need not assume any kind of sequential ignorability under the parallel design . This is due to the existence of the second experimental group where both the treatment and mediator are randomly assigned . This implies that there is no need to explicitly incorporate an alternative mediator in the analysis , for any kind of post - treatment confounding ( observed or unobserved ) is allowed to exist in the natural causal process to identify the ACME under the parallel design using the proposed framework . To apply the framework for the parallel design , one can use the multimed function with slightly modiﬁed inputs . First , the med . alt is no longer needed because the estimation framework is agnostic about what particular alternative mechanisms are confounding the mediator - outcome relationship . Second , one need to supply an additional variable ( experiment ) indicating whether units are assigned to the experiment with ( 1 ) or without ( 0 ) mediator manipulations . Finally , the design argument must be set to " parallel " , as opposed to the default value of " single " . For illustration , we again use the simulated data introduced in Section 5 . 2 and apply the varying coeﬃcient linear structural equations framework .

The key diﬀerences between the above analysis and Section 5 . 2 are threefold . First , the point estimates in the ﬁrst summary table here only rely on the homogeneous interaction assumption , not the stronger assumption of no interaction . Second , however , the estimates here depend on the additional assumption of additivity , which is embodied in the varying coeﬃcient structural equations model in Equations 8 and 9 . The additivity assumption may not be plausible in some applications and needs to be carefully examined . Finally , the second summary table shows the result of the sensitivity analysis where the homogeneous interac - tion assumption is gradually relaxed until an arbitrary interaction heterogeneity is allowed . This may be preferred to the nonparametric bounds approach in Section 5 . 2 , which oﬀers less nuanced information about how robust the point estimates are to the violation of the identiﬁcation assumption . 7 . Causal mediation analysis with treatment noncompliance A common complication in randomized controlled trials is treatment noncompliance . That is , experimental subjects may not follow the assigned treatment and instead choose to take another treatment . This poses a serious challenge to causal analysis in randomized exper - iments because , even though the assigned treatment is randomized by the researcher , the actual treatment is selected by the subjects themselves , quite possibly depending on certain characteristics unobserved to the researcher . In this section , we provide an overview of the method developed by Yamamoto ( 2013 ) to cope with the challenge of treatment noncompli - ance in the context of causal mediation analysis . The estimation method is implemented by the ivmediate function in our package , as discussed below . 7 . 1 . The methodology Analysis of causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance requires additional notation and assumptions . Let Z i ∈ { 0 , 1 } denote the binary indicator of treatment assign - ment , or encouragement , for unit i . Then , we use T i ( z ) ∈ { 0 , 1 } to denote the potential treatment which unit i would actually receive when the unit were assigned to the treatment ( z = 1 ) or control ( z = 0 ) condition . The observed treatment for unit i can then be written as T i = T i ( Z i ) . Following the standard practice in the analysis of treatment noncompliance ( see Angrist , Imbens , and Rubin 1996 ) , we assume that the treatment assignment itself does not directly aﬀect either the mediator or the outcome . Under these exclusion restrictions , we can write the potential mediator and outcome as , respectively , M i ( t ) and Y i ( t , m ) . Like - wise , the observed mediator and outcome can respectively be expressed as M i = M i ( T i ) and Y i ( T i , M i ( T i ) ) . Another standard assumption we make is the monotonicity of treatment re - ception . That is , we assume that there is no unit in the population who would only take the treatment if assigned to the control condition . This assumption is thus often called the “no deﬁer” assumption and can be written in our notation as T i ( 0 ) ≤ T i ( 1 ) for any i . 32 Causal Mediation Analysis The ﬁnal and key assumption is local sequential ignorability , which can be formally written as follows . Assumption 2 ( Local Sequential Ignorability ; Yamamoto 2013 ) { Y i ( t (cid:48) , m ) , M i ( t ) , T i ( z ) } ⊥⊥ Z i | X i = x , ( 11 ) Y i ( t (cid:48) , m ) ⊥⊥ M i ( t ) | T i = t , T i ( 0 ) = 0 , T i ( 1 ) = 1 , X i = x , ( 12 ) for t = 0 , 1 , z = 0 , 1 , and all x and m in the support of X i and M i , respectively . This assumption is closely related to but slightly weaker than the global sequential ignorability introduced earlier ( Assumption 1 ) . Equation 11 implies that the treatment assignment , Z i , must be either randomized or can be regarded to be “as - if randomized” after conditioning on a set of observed pre - encouragement covariates , X i . Equation 12 , on the other hand , requires that the observed mediator in each treatment condition be as - if randomized among the compliers , i . e . , those units whose actual treatment would always agree with their assigned treatment ( T i ( 0 ) = 0 and T i ( 1 ) = 1 ) . In other words , Assumption 2 implies that sequential ignorability must hold locally among the compliers . In the context of treatment noncompliance , researchers typically focus on the estimation of the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) eﬀect and the local average treatment eﬀect ( LATE ) among the compliers . The former quantity refers to the average causal eﬀect of the treatment assignment itself ( regardless of the actual treatment ) on the outcome , whereas the latter represents the average eﬀect of the actual treatment on the outcome among the compliers . Here , we consider the problem of decomposing each of these eﬀects into the direct and indirect portions with respect to the mediator of interest . First , the ITT eﬀect can be written as the sum of these two quantities . Mediated intent - to - treat ( ITT ) eﬀect : ¯ λ ( z ) ≡ E [ Y i ( T i ( z ) , M i ( T i ( 1 ) ) ) − Y i ( T i ( z ) , M i ( T i ( 0 ) ) ) ] . ( 13 ) Unmediated ITT eﬀect : ¯ µ ( z ) ≡ E [ Y i ( T i ( 1 ) , M i ( T i ( z ) ) ) − Y i ( T i ( 0 ) , M i ( T i ( z ) ) ) ] . ( 14 ) Second , the LATE can be decomposed into the following two quantities . Local average causal mediation eﬀect ( LACME ) : ¯ φ ( t ) ≡ E [ Y i ( t , M i ( 1 ) ) − Y i ( t , M i ( 0 ) ) | T i ( 0 ) = 0 , T i ( 1 ) = 1 ] . ( 15 ) Local average natural direct eﬀect ( LANDE ) : ¯ ψ ( t ) ≡ E [ Y i ( 1 , M i ( t ) ) − Y i ( 0 , M i ( t ) ) | T i ( 0 ) = 0 , T i ( 1 ) = 1 ] . ( 16 ) Yamamoto ( 2013 ) shows that the above four quantities ( each deﬁned for z = 0 , 1 or t = 0 , 1 ) can be nonparametrically identiﬁed under the set of assumptions introduced thus far in this section . More speciﬁcally , each of ¯ λ ( z ) , ¯ µ ( z ) , ¯ φ ( t ) and ¯ ψ ( t ) can be expressed in terms of the conditional expectations and distributions of the observed outcome , mediator and treatment Journal of Statistical Software 33 variables . These eﬀects of interest can therefore be estimated by ﬁtting regression models to each of those conditionals ( i . e . , a model for Y i given M i , T i , Z i and X i , a model for M i given T i , Z i and X i , and a model for T i given Z i and X i ) and calculating the sample analogues of the identiﬁed quantities . Uncertainty estimates can then be obtained via simulation - based methods . The ivmediate function in our package implements this procedure for a selection of models , as we illustrate with an empirical example in the next section . 7 . 2 . Illustration We illustrate the use of the ivmediate function through an analysis of data from the Job Search Intervention Study ( JOBS II ; see Vinokur , Price , and Schul 1995 , for more information about the study ) . JOBS II was a randomized job training intervention for unemployed work - ers which aimed at increasing the prospect of reemployment and improving mental health of the job seekers involved in the study . A random subsample of the participants were of - fered to receive the treatment of job - skills workshops which covered skills for job search and coping with stress , while the remaining participants were assigned to the control group and sent a booklet containing job - search tips . Despite the random assignment of the treatment conditions , some participants failed to comply with their assigned treatment status . Namely , 39 % of those who were oﬀered to participate in job - skills workshops actually did not enroll . None of the workers in the control group , on the other hand , participated in workshops , so noncompliance in this study was strictly one - sided . Several outcome measures were taken after the completion of the program via a survey . Here , we focus on the question of whether participation in the workshops improved the mental health of the unemployed workers ( mea - sured with a continuous scale based on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist ) by increasing their self - conﬁdence in job search ability ( measured by a dichotomous indicator ) . The relevant portion of the JOBS II data is included as part of the mediation package . R > data ( " jobs " , package = " mediation " ) We begin by estimating three regression models . First , we model the actual treatment status ( comply ) conditional on the assigned treatment ( treat ) and observed pre - encouragement covariates ( sex , age , marital , nonwhite , educ , and income ) . Here we postulate a linear probability model for the probability of actually participating in the job - skills workshops . R > a < - lm ( comply ~ treat + sex + age + marital + nonwhite + educ + income , + data = jobs ) Next , we model the mediator ( job _ dich ) and outcome ( depress2 ) as functions of causally precedent variables . That is , we ﬁt a logit model for the dichotomous mediator conditional on the actual treatment , assigned treatment , and observed pre - encouragement covariates , and a linear regression model for the outcome as a function of the mediator , actual treatment , assigned treatment , and pre - encouragement covariates . R > b < - glm ( job _ dich ~ comply + treat + sex + age + marital + nonwhite + + educ + income , data = jobs , family = binomial ) R > c < - lm ( depress2 ~ job _ dich * ( comply + treat ) + sex + age + marital + + nonwhite + educ + income , data = jobs ) 34 Causal Mediation Analysis Generally , it is wise to include an interaction term between the actual and assigned treatment in these models in order to allow for the regression functions to vary across treatment con - ditions . Here , however , the interaction term is not needed because noncompliance is strictly one - sided ( i . e . , there is no observation for which comply equals 1 and treat equals 0 ) . These three models can in theory be of any form , as in the case of estimating the ACME via the mediate function . However , the current version of the ivmediate function only supports binary outcome models ( ﬁtted via glm with family = binomial ) and linear models ( ﬁtted via lm ) . After ﬁtting the three models , the LACME and LANDE can be easily estimated via the ivmediate function , which takes those three ﬁtted model objects as main inputs . 9 R > out < - ivmediate ( a , b , c , sims = 100 , boot = FALSE , enc = " treat " , + treat = " comply " , mediator = " job _ dich " ) In the ivmediate function , the analyst must specify the names of the assigned treatment , actual treatment , and mediator ( as they appear in the data frames used to ﬁt the three models ) via the enc , treat , and mediator arguments , respectively . The analyst can also set the number of simulations used for the construction of conﬁdence intervals ( sims ) as well as whether the nonparametric bootstrap should be used for the conﬁdence intervals ( boot ; if FALSE , the quasi - Bayesian Monte Carlo method will be used ) . Regardless of this choice , only the intervals for the conﬁdence levels speciﬁed by the conf . level argument ( defaults to . 95 ) will be calculated and retained in the output object ( unless the long option is set to TRUE , in which case the entire set of simulation draws will be available ) . An important remark is required on the computational demand of the ivmediate function . The estimation method of Yamamoto ( 2013 ) involves numerical integration over the support of the mediator for each observation in each simulation iteration . This implies that , if the mediator is continuous ( i . e . , if model . m is an ‘ lm ; object ) and the model contains any pre - encouragement covariate , the calculation of conﬁdence intervals via ivmediate is extremely time - consuming . To ameliorate the situation , we have implemented a parallel execution of the simulation routine across multiple CPU cores . To utilize this function , the analyst should set the multicore option to TRUE and mc . cores to the desired number of cores available on his or her machine . Using N cores will approximately decrease the total computation time by the factor of N . This option , unfortunately , is implemented via mclapply and therefore not currently available on Windows machines . The output of ivmediate can be summarized using the usual summary function . R > summary ( out ) Causal Mediation Analysis with Treatment Noncompliance Confidence Intervals Based on Quasi - Bayesian Monte Carlo Estimate 95 % CI Lower 95 % CI Upper LACME ( control ) - 0 . 036963 - 0 . 089771 - 0 . 0035 9 Currently , ivmediate only estimates the complier average eﬀects and is not capable of estimating the mediated and unmediated ITT eﬀects . This limitation will be addressed in a future update .

The conﬁdence level is by default set at the ﬁrst level used in the original ivmediate run , but can be changed to any level used via the conf . level option . Here , we observe that the indirect eﬀect of job - skills workshop on depressive symptoms via increase in job - search self - eﬃcacy is on average negative and barely statistically signiﬁcant among the compliers , although the overall negative eﬀect of treatment on depression among the compliers misses the conventional level of statistical signiﬁcance . The results can also be represented graphically via the plot function . R > plot ( out ) Again , the plotted conﬁdence level can be changed via the conf . level option to any of the levels used in the original ivmediate call . The effect . type option can be used to specify which of the estimated quantities will be plotted ( the default plots everything ) . Most of the standard graphical parameters can be set in the usual manner . 36 Causal Mediation Analysis 8 . Concluding remarks In this paper , we described the functionalities of the mediation package , which allows applied researchers to conduct causal mediation analysis in a variety of settings . The package imple - ments a general algorithm for estimating causal mediation eﬀects with a variety of statistical models . Since the causal mediation analysis under the standard research design requires a strong and untestable assumption , we recommend sensitivity analysis which is also im - plemented in our package . Finally , this strong identiﬁcation assumption can be relaxed by adopting alternative research designs and we show how to use our package to conduct causal mediation analysis under those new designs . The literature on causal mediation analysis is fast growing , and we expect new methods to be developed in the coming years . We hope that the mediation package can serve as a platform to which other researchers can add new methods .
