This critical relationship is of particular importance in immune cells , where both the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane work in concert to organize and potentiate immune signaling events . Despite their importance , there remains a critical gap in understanding how these respective dynamics are coupled , and how this coupling in turn may in ﬂ uence immune cell function from the bottom up . In this review , we highlight recent optical technologies that could provide strategies to investigate the simultaneous dynamics of both the cytoskeleton and membrane as well as their interplay , focusing on current and future applications in immune cells .

Cellular components are in constant motion bridging various time - and length - scales . This includes the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton , which form a dynamic interface between the cell and its environment , working together to control cellular signaling and morphology as well as to maintain the mechanical integrity of the cell . It is becoming increasingly clear that the dynamics of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane are intimately linked to immune cell function , playing a critical role in , for instance , the regulation of receptor organization , granule section , and speci ﬁ c cytoskeletal protrusions ( 1 – 4 ) . Despite their individual importance , how both the membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton dynamics are coupled , and how feedback between the two structures shapes their interplay in immune cells remains unknown .

Actin - Membrane Interactions at a Glance The interactions between the membrane and the actin cortex are numerous and complex and have been the subject of intense research ( 5 , 6 ) ( Figure 1A ) . Underlying the plasma membrane the actin cortex exists as a densely cross - linked meshwork of ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) formed by the polymerization of globular actin ( G - actin ) monomers undergoing constant turnover on the second time - scale ( 7 ) . The dynamic architecture of the actin cortex is governed by two primary modes of F - actin polymerization driven by either Arp2 / 3 or formin nucleation leading to constantly varying actin mesh - sizes from tens of nanometers to microns ( 8 ) . The dynamic nature of the cortex as well as its mechanical plasticity is largely mediated by a variety of myosin motors that cross - link individual ﬁ laments and induce active mechanical stress within the network ( 8 ) . Biochemically linking the actin cortex and the plasma membrane are a series of speci ﬁ c protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions ( 9 ) . One of the most important membrane A B D E F C FIGURE 1 | Plasma membrane organization andactin cytoskeletal dynamics are intrinsicallylinked to immune cellorganization and function over manylength - and time - scales ( A – C ) . Techniques with the ability to quantify simultaneous dynamics present an exciting route to understandthe interplay of cortical actin and plasma membrane in immune cells ( D – F ) . ( A ) Onthe nano - scale actin ﬁ laments are turning over and binding the plasma membrane in ﬂ uencing its organization which in turn impacts on actin organization andthe distribution of receptors , lipidsand other membrane constituents . ( B ) De ﬁ ned actin and membrane ﬂ ows , organization and their integrity are crucial for cell - cellcontacts such as duringimmunologicalsynapse formation on the meso - scale .

( D ) Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) and FCCS measure ﬂ uctuation of ﬂ uorescently labeled molecules diffusing throughthe focusof a confocal microscope .

Auto - correlation ( AC ) of the intensity traces ( in two spectralchannels CH1 and CH2 ) allows to calculate diffusion coef ﬁ cients and interactions ( cross - correlation , CC ) . ( E ) Fluorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) allows to monitor changes in ﬂ uorescence lifetime . Acquiring FLIM images typically takes secondsto minutes . Functional probes can change their lifetimein accordance to theirenvironment sensing , for example , viscosity .

Schneider et al . Quantitative Bio - Imaging Tools for Immunology Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 612542 2 components mediating this interaction is the glycolipid phosphatidylinositol - bisphosphate , PIP2 . By binding the ERM ( ezrin , radixin , and moesin ) proteins , an actin binding family of proteins , PIP2 provides a linkage between cytoskeleton and membrane ( Figure 1A ) . In addition to the ERM proteins , WASP and WAVE , key regulators of Arp2 / 3 driven actin polymerization , are also able to bind PIP2 in the membrane , leading to active polymerization of F - actin at the plasma membrane ( 6 ) . Notably , the conserved diversity of speci ﬁ c linkages between cortex and membrane is indicative of the importance of the tight coupling of these structures for their function within the cell . In addition to the speci ﬁ c molecular interactions between the plasma membrane and actin cortex , there are a number of more generalbiophysicalinteractionsthathavebeenwellcharacterized in vitro ( 10 ) , for example , the local charge of the membrane has been shown to in ﬂ uence actin binding ( 11 ) . Furthermore , curvature introduced by the polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton during theformationofspeci ﬁ cprotrusionscanin ﬂ uencethediffusionand distributionofmembraneproteins ( 12 , 13 ) . Conversely , membrane curvature induced by the physical membrane microenvironment can lead to actin polymerization ( 14 ) . Local changes in actin polymerization can also induce changes in the rate and diffusion mode of lipid and protein components as well as the membrane tension ( 15 – 18 ) . Crucially , membrane composition , dynamics , and organization in ﬂ uence the underlying actin cytoskeleton . Similarly , the dynamics and architecture of the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to in ﬂ uence the plasma membrane ( 19 ) . Therefore , the complex interplay between membrane and cortical cytoskeleton makes assessing causal links challenging , highlighting the unmet need for techniques that allow the dynamicsof bothcomponents to be quanti ﬁ ed simultaneously in space and time . Actin - Membrane Interactions in Immune Cells Many stages of the immune response , for example , antigen recognition , rely on the integration of information by immune cells from their environment , often involving the formation of highly specialized cell - cell contacts , such as the immunological synapse ( IS ) that forms between T - cells , B - cells , and antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) ( Figure 1B ) . At these contacts , immunological signaling is initiated and propagated via the interactions of a wide array of molecules , occurring on and in the proximity of the plasma membrane . Owing to this , the dynamics of both the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton have a profound impact on the organization and dynamics of crucial signaling molecules . The process of immune cell activation spans a range of time - and length - scales starting with nano - scale reorganization and receptor engagement ( sub - second ) , actin polymerization driven retrograde ﬂ ow ( seconds ) , to micron - scale cellular activation , spreading , and cytokine secretion ( up to hours ) ( 20 – 22 ) . DuringT - cellactivationandISformation , oneofthekeystepsin theadaptiveimmuneresponse , therehasbeenincreasinginterestin the role of speci ﬁ c cytoskeletal protrusions in the initiation and orchestrationofearlyT - cellsignalingattheplasmamembrane ( 23 – 25 ) . Microvilli at the T - cell surface have been shown to provide an ef ﬁ cient means of environment scanning , while association of ERM proteins to the plasma membrane interface has been shown to lead totheaccumulationofsignaling moleculesatmicrovilli ( 23 , 24 , 26 ) . Following T - cell receptor ( TCR ) triggering , the T - cell undergoes a dramaticmorphological changedrivenbythe rapid polymerization ofF - actin . This results inthe formationof an increasedcontact area between the two cells , which is characterized by the retrograde ﬂ ow of actin ﬁ laments within a lamellipodial structure at its periphery as well as a rami ﬁ ed actin network at its center ( 27 ) . Crucially , TCRs are traf ﬁ cked in coordination with the F - actin ﬂ ow toward the centeroftheISandthecontinued ﬂ owofactinhasbeenshowntobe necessaryforcontinuedactivation , sustainingPLC g 1signaling ( 28 – 30 ) . Notably , once the IS has formed , recent evidence suggests that tensiongeneratedbyspeci ﬁ cdynamicactinstructuresin ﬂ uencethe symmetry and lifetime of the IS ( 31 ) . In contrast to its polymerization , the depletion of actin has also been shown to play a role in immune cell function . Targeted killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires the precise spatio - temporal control of actin depletion with recent studies pointing to a complex and intricate mechanism , whereby the density of the cortical actin underlying the membrane is tuned by the interaction of the kinase PIP5K and the loss of the charged PIP2 lipid ( 32 , 33 ) . Like the cortical actin cytoskeleton the plasma membrane is a dynamic structure , constantly in motion and continuously reorganizing ( 34 , 35 ) . The presence of de ﬁ ned domains or rafts ( tens of nanometer in diameter ) has been evoked to explain a number of phenomena , including lateral heterogeneity of the plasma membrane and , for example , the non - random distribution of membrane proteins on the cell surface ( 35 – 38 ) . Along these lines , the reorganization of immune receptors by speci ﬁ c incorporation into such structures has been described ( 39 – 41 ) . This is based on a biophysical property of the membrane and the proteins themselves : proteins can exhibit a preference for different lipid environments preferring , for instance , a densely packed lipid environment ( liquid ordered phase , highly viscous ) enriched in saturated lipids and cholesterol ( 42 , 43 ) . In contrast , other proteins can prefer the liquid disordered membrane environment , rather associating with loosely packed , unsaturated lipids resulting in a low viscosity environment . This could act as means of increasing interaction likelihood and forming signaling platforms ( 44 , 45 ) . The degree of order and the viscosity of the membrane are primarily tuned by the cholesterol content and in addition likely by its speci ﬁ c interactions with proteins and lipids ( 46 – 48 ) . Intriguingly , the attachment of actin ﬁ laments to the membrane has been seen to in ﬂ uence membrane organization , resulting in the formation of ordered domains ( 49 , 50 ) , providing a potential mechanism for actin to indirectly in ﬂ uence membrane protein organization . As is evident , studies of the dynamics of the cytoskeleton and membrane have led to important insights into the function of immunecells ( 51 – 53 ) . Despite this , there are onlya limitednumber of studies that have attempted to address the correlated biophysical and biochemical dynamic mechanisms whereby membrane and actin work together inimmune cells . Recent advancesin correlative imaging such as the combination of super - resolution microscopy and electron microscopy have allowed for detailed insights into Schneider et al . Quantitative Bio - Imaging Tools for Immunology Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 612542 3 structural links between plasma membrane and cortical actin organization ( 54 – 56 ) . However , these approaches only allow snapshots of a constantly evolving structure and thus do not allow the dynamic interplay to be followed live , and therefore make assessing causality challenging . Furthermore , little is known about how these interactionsin ﬂ uence the behavior of cells in more complex tissue environments or in their full physiological setting , with our knowledge often restricted to in vitro single cell studies ( Figure 1C ) . This has primarily been due to a lack of accessible technologies with suf ﬁ cient temporal ( < ms binding and transport events ) and spatial resolution ( single proteins on the order of nanometres can effect changes on cellular level beyond tenth of micrometers ) to assess the correlated dynamics of the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton without perturbing the system . In addition to this , such lack of technology has been confounded by a lack of membrane and actin probes that can operate at physiological conditions and offer reliable performance within the cellular environment . Here , we review recent advances in both dynamic measurement techniques and actin / membrane probes that have not yet been widely applied to study immune cells . In our view , these methods present a signi ﬁ cant opportunity to address the complex interplay between these two systems crucial to the immune response by simultaneous quanti ﬁ cation of both membrane and actin dynamics . FROM FLUORESCENCE IMAGING TO QUANTIFICATION OF DYNAMICS Live - cell ﬂ uorescence imaging is the method of choice to understand the behavior of dynamic biological processes owing to the speci ﬁ city of labeling structures of interest and the minimal invasiveness of the approach . Observing events crucial to the immune response occurring in live cells has long been performed by employing ﬂ uorescence microscopy with confocal and total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) time - lapse imaging due to their optical sectioning capabilities yielding key insights into the dynamic nature of these processes ( 57 , 58 ) . This approach has revealed , for example , the formation and traf ﬁ cking of T - cell receptor clusters ( 21 , 59 ) , which is crucial for initiation and continuation of signaling and has been shown to be strongly regulated by the dynamic interplay of the membrane and cortical actin cytoskeleton ﬂ ows ( 60 , 61 ) . Despite their success , imaging alone restricts the level of quantitative information that can be extracted from the biological system of interest , for instance , due to the limited time resolution of time - lapse imaging acquisitions ( tens of ms to s ) . Analternativequantitativeroutetoassessingtransientprocesses such as cellular reorganization driven by molecular diffusion , binding - kinetics , or ﬂ ow has been the use of dynamic techniques such as single particle tracking ( SPT ) , ﬂ uorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) , or ﬂ uorescence ﬂ uctuation spectroscopy ( FFS ) approaches . For a detailed technical description , we refer the readerto ( 62 – 64 ) . Inimmunology , these traditional techniquesand their advancements have , for instance , been used to investigate the diffusion properties of key signaling molecules such as BCR , CD1d , TCR , CD45 , or Lck in live cells ( 65 – 74 ) . Fluorescence Fluctuation Based Approaches to Assess Simultaneous Dynamics The spatial heterogeneity across microns along with fast molecular interactions within the cell membrane represent a challenge to all dynamic techniques which rely on maintaining single molecule sensitivity in the crowded cellular environment . Similar to ﬂ uorescence time - lapse imaging FRAP and SPT are conventionally limited to resolving processes in the ms time regime . Using ﬂ uctuation based techniques such as ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) offers unmatched temporal resolution ( down to ns ) to cover the range from very fast molecular binding dynamics ( µs ) to motion of large protein complexes in the membrane ( hundreds of ms ) . Unfortunately , the spatial resolution remains diffraction limited ( ~ 200 nm ) . Thus , inherently one will average many molecular interactions missing precise details on dynamics and potential sub 100 nm spatial heterogeneity which could be functionally important , for instance , during receptor - ligand engagement . The combination of stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) super - resolution microscopy with FCS has proven itself as a valuable remedy and a tool to assess nano - scale diffusion directly at the relevant spatio - temporal scales ( 75 , 76 ) . It has revealed a vast heterogeneity in diffusion behaviors of membrane constituents caused by interactions with lipid domains , transmembrane proteins , or the corticalactin cytoskeleton ( 16 , 17 , 77 ) . While STED - FCS offers very high spatial resolution in living specimens ( < 50 nm ) , it is limited by comparatively high light exposure , requires dedicated equipment ( depletion beam ) , and necessitates special dyes ( 75 ) . Bysamplingnotonlyasinglepoint , butratheralinearorcircular region , scanning ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( sFCS ) studies offer not only increased statistical power over conventional FCS but also limited phototoxicity ( 78 , 79 ) , and allow spatial heterogeneities in molecular diffusion dynamics to be accounted for ( Figure 1D ) . The increased statistical power of sFCS can be exploited to decipher the diffusion mode of the molecule of interest ( determining if a molecule undergoes free Brownian or hindered diffusion ( 80 ) due to nano - scale interactions ) . On the one hand , changes in diffusion behavior can initiate signaling pathways and on the other hand can be indicative of a cellular state such as activation ( 81 , 82 ) . Similar to STED - FCS , the statistical analysis of sFCS data can yield details of dynamic molecular organization but notably does not rely on any special equipment or dyes and can be performed on any turn - key confocal laser scanning microscope ( 79 , 80 ) . Critically , two - color scanning ﬂ uorescence cross - correlation spectroscopy ( sFCCS ) data can be used to characterize the dynamics of two species of interest , exploring their interplay in detail ( 83 – 86 ) ( Figure 1D ) . Super - resolved ( STED ) cross - correlation studies have not yet been achieved , but in combination with beam scanning bare potential to uncover short - lived interactions ( 87 , 88 ) . Together with harnessing the statistical power of scanning approaches , we anticipate that the advances in fast photon - counting acquisitions , Schneider et al . Quantitative Bio - Imaging Tools for Immunology Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 612542 4 high - countrateFCSandthusfastphoton ﬁ lteringmaypavetheway to the realization of such techniques ( 89 , 90 ) . Cross - correlation studies offer a unique opportunity to quantify cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics simultaneously , for example , probing the dynamic interactions between signaling molecules at the plasma membrane and the ﬂ ow of the actin cytoskeleton during synapse formation , allowing cross - correlation on short ( µs to ms ) time - scales . Such correlated , simultaneous acquisitions represent a promising way to dissect causation and may decipher when the actin cytoskeleton is driving the membrane organization and vice versa . Imaging larger regions allows for the mapping of diffusion across space and delivers increased spatial information at the expense of temporal resolution ( > ms ) . Both TIRF and single - plane illumination ( SPIM ) schemes have been combined with camera based FCS acquisitions yielding similar and even larger statistics compared to sFCS ( 91 – 93 ) . Crucially , these techniques provide subcellular or cellular imaging , contextualizing the dynamic measurements and allowing routine correlation with speci ﬁ c compartments of the cell . Expanding such approaches using image mean squared displacement ( iMSD ) analysis can even yield insights into the diffusion modes with a statistical power similar to STED - FCS and sFCS ( 94 , 95 ) . For camera based acquisitions the frame time ( of about 1 ms minimum ) represents the most common bottleneck for resolving fast diffusion ( 96 ) . Given recent advances in camera technology this will likely not pose a limitation for much longer . For example , interferometric scattering ( iSCAT ) microscopy , which relies on collecting scattered light from the sample rather than ﬂ uorescence emission , allows frame rates of multiple kilo Hertz covering most of the range of dynamic processes in biology ( 97 – 99 ) . Exploiting Fluorescence Lifetime to Measure Dynamics and Topology The time a ﬂ uorophore spends in the excited state is termed ﬂ uorescence lifetime and can be used as an additional means for introducing contrast in ﬂ uorescence microscopy with the ﬂ uorescence lifetime strongly depending on the environmental conditions and ﬂ uorophore properties ( 62 ) . The unrivaled temporal resolution of ﬂ uorescence ﬂ uctuation approaches offer a promising route to decipher lateral membrane organization . Yet , biology operates in all three spatial dimensions , for example , actin polymerization causing plasma membrane deformations , and the aforementioned methods are largely blind to changes in axial organization . In the following , we discuss a possible remedy exploiting ﬂ uorescence lifetime modulation . The recent advances in commercially available ﬂ uorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) platforms enable fast acquisitions ( few seconds per frame ) and easy access to this microscopy modality ( 100 ) . Typically , ﬂ uorescence lifetime information is used as an intrinsic method to generate contrast in unlabeled samples ( using auto - ﬂ uorescence ) or in conjunction with Foerster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) , where the lifetime shortening of the ﬂ uorescence donor is used to calculate the distance between two ﬂ uorochromes ( donor and acceptor ) revealing molecular interactions or conformational changes ( 101 ) ( Figure 1E ) . A versatile variation of FRET makes use of the lifetime and ﬂ uorescence quenching abilities of thin metal ﬁ lms on the glass coverslip . Inmetal inducedenergytransfer ( MIET ) , thelifetime can be used to calculate the height ( distance from the quenching surface ) of a ﬂ uorophore with nanometer precision across a range of0 - 150nm ( 102 ) ( Figure 1E ) . The dynamicrange and localisation precision can be tuned by the coating material ( most commonly goldandmorerecentlygraphene ) ( 103 – 105 ) . MIETdisplaysagreat opportunitytoexploremembranetopologyandcurvature ( 106 ) , for example , incommonTcellsurfaceinteractionstudiesusingplasma membrane markers , as has been applied to study the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells ( 107 ) . Thisbecomes even more powerful when combined with two - color labeling ( 108 , 109 ) , allowing the simultaneous spatio - temporal quanti ﬁ cation of the actin cortex and plasma membrane topology , which may elucidate microvilli structures and allow axial mapping of segregation and IS organization ( 109 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , it could be used to differentiate actual protein clusters from axially stacked molecules ( as in microvilli ) . MIET can be combined with FCS ( or rather its cousin ﬂ uorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy ) allowing for height dependant dynamic measurements , giving the opportunity to separate receptor dynamics proximal and distal from the surface withinonemeasurementinafewseconds , allowingkeyinsightsinto the mobility of receptors in the vicinity of speci ﬁ c actin structures ( 110 ) . As a further extension , the combination of ﬂ uorescence lifetime imaging with functional probes paves the way for some exciting applications , whereby membrane topology can be correlated with other readouts , such as membrane tension , curvature , or order ( see below ) . Fast Volumetric Imaging and Its Combination With Dynamic Techniques Theaforementionedapproachesgivehighlydetailedinsightsonfast time - and short length - scales . Nevertheless , the actin cortex plasma membrane interplay also affects larger - scale cellular dynamics such aspushing / pullingofthemembrane , cellmigrationandsamplingof the immediate surroundings ( see introduction ) ( Figure 1C ) . The investigation of these processes necessitate tools that are able to operate in in all three dimension ( 3D ) , capturing the complex geometries and topologies of cellular and multicellular samples . In biology , 3D ( volumetric ) imaging has typically been achieved using axialscanningconfocalmicroscopy , andmorerecentlyusingsuper - resolution techniques such as 3D - SIM . Unfortunately , such techniques are often restricted to relatively long ( several seconds to minutes ) scan times , limiting their application to slowly evolving biological systems . To investigate transient processes in a more physiological setting ( compared to a planar coverslip ) , great advances in volumetric and in vivo imaging have been made , primarily based on the use of light sheet technologies , allowing for rapid 3D acquisition ( 111 – 116 ) ( Figure 1F ) . These volumetric imaging approaches present an opportunity to overcome a long - standing issue for the investigation of plasma membrane and actin cortex interactions in lymphocytes such as T - cells . Typically , due to restrictions imposed by conventional imaging methods , speci ﬁ c activation is achieved by replacing the antigen presenting cell by a coverslip coated with an activing molecule or a supported lipid Schneider et al . Quantitative Bio - Imaging Tools for Immunology Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 612542 5 bilayer presenting target molecules ( 117 , 118 ) . This approach has led to a great number of important insights into immune cell biology , yet it omits a large proportion of the biological complexity and three - dimensional geometry present within the physiological interactions between immune cells and target cells . Consequently , theopportunitytoinvestigatingplasmamembraneandactincortexinteractionsinphysiologicalgeometryusingvolumetricimagingis likely to yield great insights ( 33 , 119 , 120 ) . Crucially , instead of acquiring time - lapse imaging alone , combing the aforementioned dynamic techniques such as FCS , FRAP , or SPT with light - sheet imaging has the great advantage of providing spatial context for the observations ( 121 ) . Notably , in contrast to FCS , the FRAP method can not only extract the dynamics of one species of interest , but can also quantify reaction processes , such as the binding of actin monomers within the actin cortex ( 122 ) . The combination of FRAP with volumetric imaging therefore represents an exciting opportunity to correlate diffusive processes , for example , at the plasma membrane with the reaction driven turnover of the actin cortex beneath . Such technologies will likely be key in providing insights into the correlated dynamics of immune cell membrane and actin cytoskeleton within physiologically relevant environments ( 123 ) . All these techniques and ideas , of course , rely on appropriate and non - perturbing labeling strategies . Excitingly , a large variety of actin and membrane labels are now available . Labels and Probes for Quanti ﬁ cation of Plasma Membrane Dynamics A variety of approaches can be chosen to label the plasma membrane . Broadly speaking , labels can be divided in speci ﬁ c labels , binding to or mimicking a certain lipid , and non - speci ﬁ c labels , displaying usually hydrophobic compounds , which insert into the membrane . The former can be used to study a speci ﬁ c lipid or pathway , the latter as a general membrane label . Non - speci ﬁ c labels such as DiO or DiI have been around for decades and have even beenusedfor invivo celltracking ( 124 , 125 ) . They conveniently incorporate quickly into the membrane by incubation alone which works well with model membranes but can require optimisation for live - cell membrane staining ( 126 ) . Homogeneous membrane labeling can also be achieved using various other commercial compounds such as the CellMask ™ dyes ( Life Technologies ) . More recently , the MemBright dyes were developed allowing for higher photo - stability , lower working concentration and super - resolution microscopy applications ( 127 ) . Alternatively , speci ﬁ c labels can be used to mimic the structure of a lipid ormembrane constituent . Thiscan bea lipidmodi ﬁ edwithan organic dye , a protein domain speci ﬁ cally binding to a lipid or even an antibody ( 126 , 128 ) . Labeled lipid analogs have enabled insightful studies of the dynamic nano - scale organization of the membrane ( 76 , 77 , 87 ) . Nevertheless , due to the comparable size of dye and lipid it cannot be excluded that the analog does not exactly represent the native lipid . An important constituent of the plasma membranewithanabundanceofabout30 % – 40 % ischolesterol ( 35 , 46 ) . A variety of probes and cholesterol binding proteins are available ( 47 , 129 ) , however how cholesterol is distributed laterally and axially in the plasma membrane remains under heated debate . It should be noted that ﬂ uorescent WGA conjugates are commonly used to stain the plasma membrane . This protein displays a lectin and rather binds the membrane adjacent glycocalyx thus spatial variations can occur within one cell and de ﬁ nitely when comparing different cell types ( 127 ) . Some proteins have speci ﬁ c domains to interact with lipids . Such proteins can be tagged with a ﬂ uorescent protein and in this way be engineered to become a lipid reporter . These are convenient probes as the cells do not require any further labeling , but overexpression of such reporters may sequester the native lipid species , infer with endogenous signaling and membrane binding and lipid species speci ﬁ city is often modulated by multiple components . Lipid binding domains include C1 - domain ( DAG ) , C2 - domain ( phospholipids ) , FYVE - and PX - domain ( PI3P ) , PH - domain ( phosphoinositide polyphosphates ) , and Annexin V ( PS ) ( 128 , 130 , 131 ) . A variety of compounds existsthat not only label the membrane but also report on its properties ( environment - sensitive dyes ) , known as functional probes . Polarity - sensitive dyes , for example , change their ﬂ uorescence properties depending on the local order ( molecular packing , accessibility of the hydrophobic core to water from the exterior medium ) of the surrounding membrane ( 132 , 133 ) . This results in quanti ﬁ able changes in ﬂ uorescence spectra or lifetimes and can be combined with super - resolution microscopy ( 134 , 135 ) . Other probes sense different membrane properties such as tension or viscosity ( 136 , 137 ) . Work with probes that change their spectrum upon changes in the local environment is experimentally convenient as it only requires acquisition in two optimized spectral channels ( even though spectral detection is preferred ) ( 138 ) . Unfortunately , these dyes typically have a very broad emission spectrum that makes it dif ﬁ cult to simultaneously quantitatively image another structure such as actin in addition . Therefore , we anticipate again that lifetime - based probes and acquisitions may show better sensitivity ( 139 , 140 ) . Approaches for Quantifying F - and G - Actin Dynamics Visualizing the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in living cells remains challenging , largely owing to the rapid turn - over of the molecular components of the cytoskeleton . Two main strategies exists for the visualization of actin within living cells : either genetic approaches modifying G - actin monomers directly with a ﬂ uorescent protein or a self - labeling tag ( SNAP / Halo ) , or by using a variety of indirect ﬁ lamentous F - actin binding labels , for example , the short peptides Lifeact or F - tractin , which are additionally modi ﬁ ed with a ﬂ uorescent protein ( 141 – 143 ) . As with lipid labeling , care must be taken to use the appropriate strategy for the desired dynamic output , for instance , FRAP or FCS studies assessing actin diffusion must utilize a direct G - actin approach to ensure that the measured diffusion is that of G - actin and not the indirect actin probe e . g . Lifeact - ﬁ lament binding . A recentversatileapproachisthevisualizationofmembraneproximal F - actin by a membrane - bound F - tractin reporter ( MPAct ) as this directly reports on plasma membrane cortex interactions ( 144 ) . Schneider et al . Quantitative Bio - Imaging Tools for Immunology Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 612542 6 This enables to investigate actin cortex remodeling in proximity of the membrane , which could yield novel insights into actin - rich protrusions and their dynamic reorganization during T - cell activation . Labeling F - actin in live cells can also be performed with a small organic molecule , SiR - actin ( 143 ) . This is derived from a toxin and has the advantage that it can simply be added to the cell of interest , is cell permeable and can readily be used with super - resolution STED microscopy ( 145 ) . Because of its mode of binding to actin ﬁ laments , it may perturb native actin dynamics . A rather recent approach displays the use of anti - actin nanobodies ( Chromotek ) ( 146 – 148 ) or direct delivery of mRNA encoding for labeled Lifeact with certain advantages for primary cells ( IBIDI ) . In immunology bothLifeact and F - tractin have been widely applied to visualize F - actin dynamics ( 141 , 149 ) . More recently , Lifeact has alsobeenimplicatedinchangingendogenousactindynamics ( 150 – 152 ) . As with any secondary labeling , careful optimisation and controls are necessary . When investigating F - actin a comparison with a ( ﬁ xed ) phalloidin stain can serve as a control . Common to all labeling strategies applied to ﬂ uorescence microscopy in living cells should be the use of probes that do not disturb the native behavior of the tagged molecule and do not in ﬂ uence the biological system . As mentioned above , lipids and the attached ﬂ uorescent dyes are of a comparable size , and thus measures should be taken to ensure that the lipid behaves as its native counterpart . Often a variety of chemical structures need to be screened in order to optimize labeling of a target molecule ( i . e . signaling function , cellular localisation , molecular interactions and so forth need to be preserved and checked ) ( 77 , 129 ) . Similar issues arise with the use of ﬂ uorescent proteins which can sterically hinder their target protein or arti ﬁ cially cause oligomerisation ( 153 ) . Therefore , it is advisable to use ﬂ exible linkers and trial multiple labeling strategies , for example , C - and N - terminal tagging ( 154 , 155 ) . Overall , we would like to emphasize that controls ensuring the preserved function are of the utmost importance . Perturbation Studies Using Biochemical - and Photo - Manipulation Speci ﬁ c labeling of molecules allows the membrane or the cytoskeleton to be studied in different physiological settings . A common additional step of the analysis is to perform perturbations , disturbing the steady - state of the actin assembly or membrane structure or even the actin - membrane interplay . By systematically perturbing different components of the system independently , the impact of each on the signaling and function within the living cell can be inferred and key - components , for example , as drug targets be identi ﬁ ed . Perturbations at the plasma membrane are commonly performed by altering the lipid composition . For transient changes , lipid species can simply be fed but recent evidence shows that the cells quickly counteract this to preserve the biophysical properties of the membrane ( 156 ) . More commonly , certain membrane constituents are depleted . For instance , cholesterol which is a major component of the plasma membrane , playing an important role in signaling , and is proposed to be the major organizer of nanodomains aka rafts and has a profound effect on the overall biophysical properties such as viscosity and rigidity of the plasma membrane is a common target ( 46 , 157 ) . Treatments with cholesterol oxidase or methyl - b - cyclodextrin are routinely used to deplete cholesterol directly at the plasma membrane ( 158 ) for studying fast time scales such as seconds to minutes . Alternatively , drugs such as statins which interfere with cholesterol synthesis in the cell enable investigations of longer time scales up to hours and days ( 35 ) . In that way , changes in cellular function , membrane organization or signaling upon variations in cholesterol content can be probed ( 77 , 159 ) . Analogously the role of sphingomyelin can be studied by treating the cell with sphingomyelinase or drugs such as fumonisin B1 or myriocin , respectively ( 35 , 47 , 77 , 160 ) . Similarly , the actin cytoskeleton and its turnovercan be targeted with various drugs or genetically modi ﬁ ed ( 161 , 162 ) . For instance , Latruncullin B along withCytochlasinsorPhalloidincan beusedto rapidly block F - actin polymerization ( 163 ) , speci ﬁ cally inhibiting the addition of new actin monomers to the barbed end of F - actin ( 27 , 28 , 163 ) . Incontrast , Jasplakinolidecanbeusedtostabilizeactin ﬁ laments and promote polymerization ( 2 , 164 ) . Other drugs can be used to tune the cortex structure by in ﬂ uencing the nucleation of F - actin . Forexample , CK666caninhibitactinbranchingbybindingto Arp2 / 3whichcaninturnbeusedtostudythein ﬂ uenceofthecortex organization and ultra - structure on the nano - scale diffusion behavior within the membrane ( 16 , 165 , 166 ) . Furthermore , the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 can be used to remodel actin ﬁ laments and cortex structure ( 167 , 168 ) . In addition , a number of drugs can be used to target myosin molecular motors that drive stress generation within cortex . Speci ﬁ cally , both blebbistatin ( 169 ) , an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase activity , and the rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 ( 170 ) , arecommonlyusedtoperturbtheabilityofmyosinII to actively generate stress within the cortex . While these studies provided profound insights , for example , into actin reorganization during T - cell activation ( 27 , 168 ) , such perturbations using small molecules and enzymes affect the cellas a whole and can have unwanted side effects : For example , SMIFH2 has recently been indicated to inhibit myosins in addition to formins ( 171 ) . Because of this , care needs to be taken when interpreting their effect on the structure or process of interest . A remedy to looking at global changes may come with the introduction of more photo - caged compounds or photo - activatable proteins , offering the potential for spatio - temporal control of perturbations ( 172 – 174 ) . In addition , model systems such as cell - derived vesicles offer more control but do not allow to measure a living system ( 17 , 35 , 175 ) . DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES The communication of immune cells with their environment , other immune cells and target cells involves a diversity of complex receptor - ligand interactions . These interactions all take place within the context of the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cortex . Consequently , their dynamics are intimately linked to the biophysical properties of both the membrane and the actin cytoskeleton and are constantly in ﬂ uencing one another . In this review , we have sought to highlight tools and technologies that present exciting opportunities to uncover the correlated dynamics Schneider et al . Quantitative Bio - Imaging Tools for Immunology Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 612542 7 of the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton at the immune cell interface for the ﬁ rst time , harnessing the power of simultaneous acquisitions . In particular , the presented methodologies provide a route to pick apart the key determinants of actin - membrane dynamics , unraveling the causal mechanistic relationships between the two systems . Crucially , these technologies operate across a wide range of length - and time - scales , allowing the investigation of nanoscale interactions on the sub - millisecond time scale up to large scale whole - cell measurements using volumetric imaging . Armed with these new technologies , immunologists can address key questions regarding the interactions of molecules on or in the proximity of the plasma membrane . The ubiquity of membrane interactions in immune cell functions means these techniques have the potential to provide insight into a wide range of immunological cell types , in both the adaptive and innate immune response . As detailed , these new technologies together with novel functional probes allow the assessment of important biophysical parameters such as lipid order , charge , viscosity , and membrane tension . Manyoftheseparametershavebeenimplicatedinimmune cell function , thus their systematic probing using these newly available tools is timely ( 176 – 178 ) . Coupled with established immunological methods , such as ﬂ uorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) , these techniques provide a powerful route to better understand the function of a wide range of immune cells . Tomaximizethegainsfromthepresentedtechniques , theymust be applied at the appropriate time - and length - scales . FCS , for instance , operates at the m s to ms time scales and sub - micron spatial - scales , and FRAP rather on ms to s and on micron scales . MIET offers high sensitivity in the axial direction , but remains diffraction limited laterally , and temporal resolution is limited by the samplesignal and lifetime acquisition ( ~ s ) . Volumetric imaging can be extremely rapid , but in most cases cannot surpass the diffraction limit in spatial resolution . 3D - SIM is promising in the regardofisotropicsub - diffractionresolutionbutsacri ﬁ cestemporal resolution ( 179 , 180 ) . Therefore , care needs to be taken to answer the right questions with the right tools . In addition to this , as discussed , probes and labels should be chosen such that they maximize the potential of the applied technique , for example , in FCS , dyeswithahighmolecularbrightnessandhighphoto - stability are desirable , whereas dyes utilized for FRAP should allow for ef ﬁ cient photobleaching . For MIET , ﬂ uorescent dyes showing a single exponential lifetime decay curve are desirable to allow for more straightforward reconstruction of the topological features from the quenched lifetimes . In addition , the labeling density should be considered : SPT , for example , can only be applied in the case that single molecules ( single emitters ) can be tracked , whereas FRAP and FCS can operate over a much wider range of molecular densities . Lastly , as for any multi - color microscopy experiments , the emission spectra and the possible overlap of the utilized dyes should be taken into account . Especially for dynamic techniquesspectral bleed - throughcan resultinthe measurement of false positive interactions . While these techniques present exciting opportunities for single cells and subcellular context , future work should focus on extending the capabilities of these methods to operate in more complex , more relevant multi - cellular environments including tissues and living organisms . Indeed , work in this direction is well underway with the introduction of rapid volumetric imaging systems like those presented here . We believe that great potential lies in the combination and integration of large scale volumetric imaging with technologies such as FC ( C ) S , FRAP and SPT , providing quanti ﬁ cation of key biophysical parameters throughout the functionally diverse life cycles of immune cells .
