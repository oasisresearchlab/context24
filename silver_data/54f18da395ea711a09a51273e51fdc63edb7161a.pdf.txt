Optical spectroscopy is a method that employs the interaction of light in detecting virus on samples . It is a promising method that might help in detecting the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in samples . Four optical spectroscopy methods are discussed in this paper : ultraviolet ( UV ) , infrared ( IR ) , Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy . UV and IR spectroscopy differ in wavelength range ( less than 400 nm for UV , more than 700 nm for IR ) . Raman spectroscopy involves shift in wavelength due to scattering of light . Fluorescence spectroscopy involves difference in wavelength between absorbed and emitted light due to vibrational relaxation . These four methods had been proven to differentiate healthy samples from virus - infected samples . UV spectroscopy is useful in determining presence of virus based on 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio . However , its usefulness is limited due to its destructive properties on virus at sufficiently high intensity . Meanwhile , IR spectroscopy has becoming popular in studies involving virus samples . Mid - infrared ( MIR ) spectroscopy is most commonly used among IR spectroscopy as it usually provides useful information directly from spectral data . Near infrared ( NIR ) spectroscopy is also used in studying virus samples , but additional methods such as principal component analysis ( PCA ) and partial least squares ( PLS ) are required to process raw spectral data and to identify molecules based on spectral peaks . On the other hand , Raman spectroscopy is useful because spectral data can be analyzed directly in identifying vibrational modes of specific molecules in virus samples . Fluorescence spectroscopy relies on interaction between viral particles and fluorescent tags for the detection of virus based on improvement or quenching of fluorescent signal . Due to non - invasive properties of virus samples , IR , Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy will be used more often in future studies involving virus detection in infected samples .

Introduction Coronavirus ( CoV ) is a virus characterized by spike - like projections on its surface that can be viewed under an electron microscope to give a crown - like appearance ( Singhal , 2020 ) . CoVs have long genomes of up to 32 kilobases , and expansion of genomes is believed to be partially regulated by an increase in replication fidelity ( Forni et al . , 2017 ) . All CoVs share a similar genome organization , with two large overlapping reading frames : ORF1a / b and ORFS . ORF1a / b encodes 16 nonstructural proteins , while ORFS has four major structural proteins : spike ( S ) , envelope ( E ) , membrane ( M ) and nucleocapsid ( N ) ( Zhou et al . , 2020 ) . Spike protein in CoVs is vital in receptor binding and determination of host tropism and transmission capacity . It is functionally divided into two domains , S1 and S2 , both responsible for receptor binding and fusion of cell membrane respectively ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) . CoVs are divided into four genera , according to genome characteristics : α - CoV , β - CoV , γ - CoV and δ - CoV ( Ciotti et al . , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . Seven human coronaviruses ( HCoV ) were identified and fall within α - CoV and β - CoV . Two α - CoV ( HCoV - NL63 and HCoV - 229E ) and two β - CoV ( HCoV - OC43 and HCoV - HKU1 ) usually trigger common cold , but they may also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections , especially among children and elderly ( Ciotti et al . , 2020 ; De Sabato et al . , 2019 ) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) are HCoV categorized under β - CoV . SARS - CoV is an aetiological agent that triggered severe respiratory disease and has caused an outbreak in China in 2002 ( Su et al . , 2016 ) . Meanwhile , MERS - CoV has caused another outbreak of severe respiratory disease centred at Middle East in 2012 ( Raj et al . , 2014 ) . A novel coronavirus , namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was identified in 2019 and has caused an ongoing pandemic worldwide . SARS - CoV - 2 isolated from lower respiratory tract samples of a patient was revealed to be β - CoV according to deep sequencing ( Zhou et al . , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . Coronavirus disease - 19 ( COVID - 19 ) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . The disease emerged in Wuhan , China at the end of 2019 , before affecting at least 100 countries globally ( Haynes et al . , 2020 ) . The transmission rate can be quantified using basic reproduction number ( R - naught , or R o ) , adapted from mathematical models . A study showed that the average R o value of COVID - 19 is 3 . 28 ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . Although R o value is expected to fall within a range similar to SARS due to similarities in pathogen and region of exposure , several studies have reported different R o values for COVID - 19 , often much higher than SARS or MERS ( Z . Cao et al . , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ; Shen et al . , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2020 ; Viceconte & Petrosillo , 2020 ) . Three commonly accepted modes of COVID - 19 transmission are via small airborne microdroplets , larger respiratory droplets , and direct contact with contaminated surfaces ( Morawska et al . , 2020 ) . Transmission mode via small airborne microdroplets is more contagious as small droplets carrying viral content are more affected by air current than gravitation , effectively transmitting droplets up to tens of meters away ( Morawska & Cao , 2020 ) . Transmission of COVID - 19 becomes more likely in the case of confined space and poor quarantine environment . A study revealed that SARS - CoV - 2 has a general secondary attack rate of 16 . 3 % , which is higher than other coronavirus species such as SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV ( Li et al . , 2020 ) . The reported symptoms of COVID - 19 varies from mild to severe , with some cases resulting in death ( Dzieciatkowski et al . , 2020 ) . A study showed that the most common symptoms of COVID - 19 include fever , cough , fatigue , shortness of breath , sore throat , sputum and myalgia ( Guan et al . , 2020 ) . COVID - 19 becomes more severe in patients with chronic diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , cancer , obesity , chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Hacker et al . , 2021 ) . However , there have been cases where infected individuals do not experience any of these symptoms , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 which are well known as asymptomatic carriers . These individuals can spread COVID - 19 towards highly vulnerable individuals such as elderly , young children , pregnant ladies , smokers and immunocompromised patients ( Elengoe , 2020 ) . Because of this , social distancing has become one of the solutions preferred by government in mitigating transmission of COVID - 19 . One study predicted that social distancing prevents hospitals ' overflow by reducing the number of patients requiring ICU care per day , implying that social distancing reduces the transmission rate of COVID - 19 ( Greenstone & Nigam , 2020 ) . Other methods include travel ban and restrictions , temporary closure of frequently visited places , avoiding 3Cs ( Crowded places , Confined spaces , Close conversation ) and practising 3Ws ( Wash hands , Wear masks , Warn against risks ) ( Ganasegeran et al . , 2020 ) . Detecting SARS - CoV - 2 in patients helps isolate only infected patients and avoid false positives , resulting in unnecessary treatment of uninfected individuals . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is the most commonly used method in detecting SARS - CoV - 2 in samples ( Orooji et al . , 2021 ) . PCR has the ability to determine the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 with high accuracy . However , obtaining the results usually requires as long as 48 hours and multiple steps with varying temperature and chemicals . Rapid Test Kit Antigen ( RTK - Ag ) is another commonly used method in detecting presence of SARS - CoV - 2 based on specific protein virus or antigen . A study by Kalil et al . ( 2021 ) showed that RTK - Ag has high specificity . However , this method is prone to false negative , as it was observed that the negative predicted value ( NPV ) , or probability of correctly identifying negative sample , is only 66 . 7 % ( Kalil et al . , 2021 ) . Optical spectroscopy is a non - invasive method that employs interaction of light on samples . Spectroscopy is sometimes accompanied by pattern recognition model to improve performance in virus detection . Based on previous research studies , spectroscopy has shown promising results in rapidly detecting presence of virus with high accuracy ( Bilal et al . , 2017 ; Fernandes et al . , 2018 ; Khan et al . , 2018 ; Roy et al . , 2019 ; Sakudo et al . , 2012 ) . Research involving spectroscopy in detecting SARS - CoV - 2 is of the utmost importance with the demand for rapid and robust detection . This paper presents review mainly on methods of virus detection in infected samples by means of spectroscopy . This paper will highlight four spectroscopy methods : ultraviolet ( UV ) , infrared ( IR ) , Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy . These methods will be discussed in terms of theory , techniques in past studies and evidence on the techniques . 2 . Ultraviolet ( UV ) Spectroscopy 2 . 1 Theory of UV Spectroscopy Ultraviolet ( UV ) is a type of radiation with wavelength ranging between 10 nm and 400 nm ( S . Chen & Xu , 2021 ) . It consists of radiation having higher energy compared to visible light . UV spectrum is divided based on two standards . The most commonly used standard involves dividing UV spectrum into UVA ( 320 - 400 nm ) , UVB ( 280 - 320 nm ) and UVC ( 200 - 280 nm ) ( Surjadinata et al . , 2017 ) . Major portions of UVA and small portions of UVB enter Earth’s atmosphere via sunlight . This is because Earth’s atmosphere absorbs most UVB radiation in sunlight and the ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs all UVC radiation ( Seyer & Sanlidag , 2020 ) . UV spectrum can also be divided according to another standard : near UV ( NUV ) ( 300 – 400 nm ) , middle UV ( 200 – 300 nm ) and far UV ( 122 – 200 nm ) ( S . Chen & Xu , 2021 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 2 . 2 Past Research Applying UV Spectroscopy Techniques UV spectroscopy involves the absorption of visible light and ultraviolet radiation associated with the excitation of electrons from lower to higher energy levels , in both atoms and molecules ( Atole & Rajput , 2018 ) . In a study by Potterfield and Zlotnick ( 2010 ) , nucleic acid and protein spectra can be differentiated quantitatively using 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio . Nucleic acid tends to have an absorption peak of around 260 nm , which leads to higher 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio . In contrast , protein maximally absorbs UV radiation with a wavelength close to 280 nm , which leads to lower 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio . This guideline has been used in past studies in determining the type of viral particles in samples ( Minamikawa et al . , 2021 ; Piva et al . , 2020 ; Porterfield & Zlotnick , 2010 ) . For example , a study by Minamikawa et al . ( 2021 ) used SARS - CoV - 2 sample contained in several different media such as Eagle’s minimal essential medium ( EMEM ) , fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) . It was shown that all media except PBS without FBS exhibit absorbance peak of 280 nm , suggesting that UV absorption of virus is dominated by protein . Furthermore , it was also shown that viruses inside EMEM ( 10 % FBS ) exhibit a higher absorption peak at 280 nm than viruses in other media . In another study by Piva et al . ( 2020 ) , a sample containing pure hRSV M2 - 1 protein is verified by ensuring lower 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio . Measurement of UV absorbance spectra in a sample is primarily affected by Rayleigh scattering . This occurs because the scattering of light in spherical solutes is proportional to 𝜆 −4 ( Porterfield & Zlotnick , 2010 ; Rüdt et al . , 2019 ) . Due to Rayleigh scattering , UV with shorter wavelength is much more prone to be scattered . Furthermore , Rayleigh scattering becomes more apparent when the diameter of spherical solute is smaller . In a study by Porterfield and Zlotnick ( 2010 ) , the uncorrected readings of 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio in protein vary from 0 . 59 to 0 . 71 . By applying correction for Rayleigh scattering , the reading for 260nm / 280nm absorbance ratio is consistent at about 0 . 6 , which is similar to findings from previous studies ( Glasel , 1995 ; Goldfarb et al . , 1951 ) . UV absorbance spectra is not extensively studied for viral samples , especially in recent studies . Depending on the intensity , UV may have destructive effects on the virus . UV spectrum is generally used as disinfectant because it has well - known antiviral effect ( Heßling et al . , 2020 ) . The disinfectant mechanism involves the use absorption of UV radiation by RNA which forms pyrimidine dimers , as depicted in Figure 1 ( Budowsky et al . , 1981 ; Heßling et al . , 2020 ) . The most commonly used light source for disinfection is the mercury - vapor lamp , which emits UV radiation at 254 nm . This peak falls under UVC and is very close to maximum absorption peak of RNA at 260 nm ( Heßling et al . , 2020 ) . Another study by Minamikawa et al . ( 2021 ) further explained that UV radiation at 265 nm and 280 nm requires less radiation dose to inactivate the virus than UV radiation at 300 nm . This is also because RNA and protein in a virus absorb more radiation at absorbance peak of 260 nm and 280 nm respectively ( Heßling et al . , 2020 ; Porterfield & Zlotnick , 2010 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Figure 1 : Formation of pyrimidine dimers in RNA 3 . Infrared ( IR ) Spectroscopy 3 . 1 Theory of IR Spectroscopy Infrared ( IR ) is a type of radiation with wavelength above 750 nm . IR typically has lower photon energy compared to visible light . IR is mainly divided into three types : near infrared ( NIR ) , mid - infrared ( MIR ) and far infrared ( FIR ) . Radiation is categorized as NIR if its wavelength ranges between 750 nm and 2500 nm ( wavenumber from 13333 cm - 1 to 4000 cm - 1 ) ( Pasquini , 2018 ) . NIR consists of high - energetic photons invisible to the naked eye , but is energetic enough to cause an electronic transition in molecules ( Ozaki , 2012 ; Pasquini , 2018 ) . NIR is sensitive to overtones and a combination of vibrations in a molecule ( Hasbi et al . , 2022 ; Veerasingam et al . , 2021 ) . Meanwhile , MIR consists of radiation whose wavelength ranges from 2500 nm to 50000 nm ( wavenumber of 4000 cm - 1 to 200 cm - 1 ) ( Barth , 2007 ) . MIR is used to study the fundamental vibrations of a molecule ( Veerasingam et al . , 2021 ) . In addition , FIR consists of radiation with a wavelength between 50 μ m and 1000 μ m ( wavenumber of 200 cm - 1 and 4 cm - 1 ) and is also known as terahertz frequency regime ( Barth , 2007 ) . It is used to study the rotation of a molecule ( Mukherjee & Gowen , 2015 ; Veerasingam et al . , 2021 ) . Figure 2 illustrates the infrared spectrum ' s infrared range and its application in studying the molecules . Figure 2 : Range of infrared radiation and application in studying molecules J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 IR spectroscopy involves using radiation in the infrared region to study the composition of samples . NIR and MIR are commonly used in recent studies involving IR spectroscopy of the virus . NIR and MIR are more commonly used compared to UV as they are non - invasive to virus samples . However , MIR is more commonly used in spectroscopic studies than NIR because it can recognize the change in dipole moment of a molecule ( Wiercigroch et al . , 2017 ) . Sometimes , MIR is accompanied by Fourier transform ( FT ) to convert detection signal into actual spectra , hence , the name Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) emerged . 3 . 2 The Past Studies Applying IR Spectroscopy Technique Table 1 shows previous studies employing NIR and MIR spectroscopy in virus samples . Certain studies employed additional methods to make the observed peaks in spectra clearer . Table 1 : List of previous studies employing NIR and MIR on virus samples Author Virus samples Type of infrared Wavelength ( nm ) / Wavenumber ( cm - 1 ) Additional methods Main findings Erukhimovitch et al . ( 2011 ) HSV - 1 , HSV - 2 and VZV MIR ( FTIR Absorbance ) 4000 – 800 cm - 1 Principal component analysis ( PCA ) • During the early stages of development , infected samples exhibit higher spectral intensity in the 1220 - 1260 cm - 1 region . The intensity at this region significantly decreased at the late stage of development . • Samples during the early stages of development have little to no peak at 1023 cm - 1 ( attributed to carbohydrates ) , but this peak significantly increased during late stages of development . Sakudo et al . ( 2012 ) Influenza virus NIR ( Absorbance ) 600 – 1100 nm Principal component analysis ( PCA ) • The sharp peaks of 850 , 950 and 1030 nm , as well as broad peaks between 660 - 740 nm are essential in discriminating influenza - infected sample from healthy samples .

Dou et al .

Barauna et al . ( 2021 ) SARS - CoV - 2 MIR ( FTIR - Absorbance ) 650 – 4000 cm - 1 - • An increase in absorbance of infected sample at 1429 cm - 1 is associated with the virus itself . • Decrease in absorbance of infected samples at 1220 , 1084 , 1069 and 1041 cm - 1 is associated with host organism response against infection . Wood et al . ( 2021 ) SARS - CoV - 2 MIR ( FTIR - Absorbance ) 800 – 4000 cm - 1 Second derivative transformed spectra plot , principal component analysis ( PCA ) • Positive samples exhibit more intense peaks at 3288 , 1658 and 1549 cm - 1 , indicating high protein levels due to viral proteins or antibody • More intense peaks at 1078 and 1249 cm - 1 are observed in positive samples , both are associated with nucleic acid coming from viral RNA . 3 . 3 Evidence of IR Techniques A study by Erukhimovitch et al . ( 2011 ) measured FTIR absorbance spectra to differentiate infected samples at different stages of herpes virus development from healthy samples . Regions at 1000 – 1140 cm - 1 and 1200 – 1300 cm - 1 were focused due to significant changes of infected cells at different stages of development . Based on Figure 3 , the absorbance peak at 1240 cm - 1 , representing the specific vibrational mode of phosphate , significantly increases at 1 - 2 days after infection of the viruses . The specific vibrational mode of phosphate at this peak is related to the nucleic acid ( Wong et al . , 1993 ) . The increase of absorption peak at 1240 cm - 1 is most probably caused by the accumulation of free viral nucleic acid at the host cell ' s nucleus ( Erukhimovitch et al . , 2011 ) . However , the decrease in peak is observed at 3 days after infection . This is the result of apoptosis and death of cells , where all viral mRNA and most of DNA from host cell degrade ( Holman et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , the absorption peak of 1023 . 3 cm - 1 from Figure 3 ( attributed to carbohydrates ) is not visible during early stage of development compared to an uninfected cell . The disappearance of this peak results from the cell undergoing apoptosis during the early stage of development ( Chalmers & Griffiths , 2002 ; Holman et al . , 2000 ) . This peak reappears during the late stage of development most probably due to severe possible damage of cell membrane which highly exposes cytoplasmic components to IR radiation ( Erukhimovitch et al . , 2011 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Figure 3 : MIR absorbance spectra of control ( healthy ) sample and infected samples at different stages ( Erukhimovitch et al . , 2011 ) Another study conducted by Roy et al . ( 2019 ) used attenuated total reflectance FTIR ( ATR - FTIR ) to diagnose samples infected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . The light source used in the study is in MIR region , with wavenumber ranging from 600 cm - 1 to 4200 cm - 1 . Based on the raw spectra obtained , the second derivative normalized spectra for HBV and HCV are plotted , as in Figure 4 . Out of several peaks in second derivative normalized spectra , three peaks ( 1646 , 1631 and 985 cm - 1 ) differentiate healthy samples from HBV - infected samples . Meanwhile , four peaks ( 1646 , 1631 , 1078 , 989 cm - 1 ) differentiate healthy samples from HCV - infected samples . These peaks are marked with arrows in Figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) . Figure 4 : Second derivative normalized spectra plot of ( a ) HBV - infected sample and healthy sample , and ( b ) HCV - infected sample and healthy sample ( Roy et al . , 2019 ) The minima band at 1646 cm - 1 is present in healthy samples while the minima band at 1631 cm - 1 is present in both infected samples . The more intense minima band of 1631 cm - 1 in infected samples is the characteristics of a β - pleated sheet which is assigned to inflammation marker immunoglobin ( IgG ) ( Spalding et al . , 2018 ) . It is found that IgG level increases when the patient is infected with either J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Hepatitis - B or Hepatitis - C disease ( Roy et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , the band of 991 cm - 1 is observed to be red - shifted in HBV ( 985 cm - 1 ) and HCV ( 989 cm - 1 ) infected samples . This band is also associated with IgG ( Petibois , Cazorla , Cassaigne , & Déléris , 2001 ) , but this band is more intense in HCV - infected samples compared to other samples . In addition , the band of 1078 cm - 1 may be caused by symmetric phosphodiester stretch of viral nucleic acids , but the spectrum of 1074 cm - 1 also appears quite strongly in IgG sample ( Roy et al . , 2019 ) . In a study conducted by Dou et al . ( 2020 ) , MIR absorbance spectra and imaging of MS2 bacteriophage and Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) samples are obtained using atomic force microscopy infrared ( AFM - IR ) . Although the authors did not explicitly stated that MIR absorbance is obtained , AFM - IR works by measuring MIR absorbance of the sample based on cantilever vibration in contact with the sample ( Dazzi & Prater , 2017 ) . Figure 5 illustrates the absorbance spectra in MIR region for MS2 and HSV - 1 samples . HSV - 1 contains proteins whose vibrational bands can be assigned to 1660 cm - 1 ( amide I ) and 1517 cm - 1 ( amide II ) . HSV - 1 also contains DNA whose nucleic acid exhibits vibrational bands at 1020 – 1057 cm - 1 ( C - O stretching of deoxyribose residue ) and 1258 cm - 1 ( P - O vibration ) ( Wood , 2016 ; Zucchiatti et al . , 2016 ) . On the other hand , MS2 exhibits very different spectra as observed in Figure 5 . Its nucleic acid causes vibrational bands that are more intense ( compared to HSV - 1 ) at 808 and 860 cm - 1 ( nucleic acid sugars ) , 1258 cm - 1 ( P - O vibration ) and 1450 cm - 1 ( CH 2 vibration ) . Figure 5 : Absorbance of MIR in MS2 ( red ) and HSV - 1 ( blue ) samples as implied by IR intensity of cantilever oscillation ( Dou et al . , 2020 ) A study conducted by Barauna et al . ( 2021 ) used FTIR spectroscopy on SARS - CoV - 2 samples with MIR of wavenumber ranging from 4000 cm - 1 to 650 cm - 1 . The difference between absorbance spectra of saliva samples ( with and without SARS - CoV - 2 ) are primarily associated with the nucleic acid . Based on Figure 6 , higher absorbance peak of 1429 cm - 1 in the infected sample is probably due to the virus itself . Meanwhile , the decrease in absorbance peaks located at 1220 , 1084 , 1069 and 1041 cm - 1 is probably associated with the response of the host organism against the virus ( Barauna et al . , 2021 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 Figure 6 : MIR absorbance spectra of saliva on swab ( blue ) and saliva with SARS - CoV - 2 virus on swab ( red ) ( Barauna et al . , 2021 ) Wood et al . ( 2021 ) utilised FTIR spectroscopy to differentiate salivary samples from healthy patients from those infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Absorbance spectra and corresponding second derivative transformed spectra for both positive and negative samples are revealed in Figure 7 . Strong bands from proteins at peaks of 3288 , 1658 and 1549 cm - 1 appeared more intense in positive samples . It must be noted that saliva has low levels of proteins compared to other biofluids ( Schultz et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , the significant difference in peaks associated with protein is most likely due to viral proteins or antibodies . Furthermore , positive samples exhibit more intense peaks at 1240 and 1078 cm - 1 , which are associated with nucleic acids ( Wood , 2016 ) . These indicate that viral RNA in positive samples contributes to these peaks . Figure 7 : FTIR absorbance spectra and corresponding second derivative transformed plot for positive and negative samples ( Wood et al . , 2021 ) J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 NIR study on virus mostly involves absorption of NIR radiation by virus samples . It is expected that the absorption peaks at NIR region are due to either electronic transition or overtones of certain molecules . However , previous studies involving NIR absorbance found that the difference in NIR absorbance spectra in healthy and infected samples requires additional methods to signify the difference in spectra between both samples ( Fernandes et al . , 2018 ; Sakudo et al . , 2012 ) . Differences in spectra as observed from processed data can be used to determine the overtones or vibration of specific samples . In a study conducted by Sakudo et al . ( 2012 ) , Vis - NIR absorbance spectra are measured on healthy and influenza - infected samples . The spectra are further processed using principal component analysis ( PCA ) and soft independent modelling of class analogy ( SIMCA ) to identify predominant absorbance peaks . Sharp peaks ( 850 , 950 and 1030 nm ) and broad peaks ( 660 - 740 nm ) in SIMCA model are predominant to differentiate healthy samples from infected samples . The broad peak between 660 and 740 nm are related to alcohol and C - H aromatic groups ( Workman & Weyer , 2007 ) . The alcohol and C - H aromatic group also causes sharp peaks observed at 1030 nm and 850 nm respectively ( Williams & Norris , 2001 ) . Meanwhile , another sharp peak at 950 nm is close to the water band ( Osborne , 2000 ) . The difference in peaks as expressed by SIMCA model may be caused by various changes such as modulation of protein expression and movement of surrounding cells , which may be caused by the influenza virus and may be similar to effects caused by a respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) ( Welliver , 2003 ) . The influenza virus induces cytokines and chemokines , which cause activation of lymphocytes and subsequently causes these changes ( Eccles , 2005 ) . Another study by Fernandes et al . ( 2018 ) studied on Vis - NIR absorbance spectra of Zika - infected A . aegypti mosquitoes . Figure 8 ( a ) illustrates a noticeable difference in absorbance spectra of uninfected and infected mosquitoes . Meanwhile , Figure 8 ( b ) shows plot of partial least squares ( PLS ) models where more noticeable peaks at eight wavelengths ( 1000 , 1413 , 1515 , 1711 , 1801 , 1893 , 2109 , 2246 nm ) are observed . It must be noted that the spectrometer used in the study by Fernandes et al . ( 2018 ) consists of three sensors , namely a silicon sensor ( 350 nm to 1000 nm ) and two InGaAs sensors ( 1000 – 1800 nm , 1801 – 2500 nm ) . The authors explained that the two peaks in Figure 8 ( b ) ( 1000 and 1800 nm ) may either be due to molecular components of Zika virus or instrumental error due to transition between the sensors ( Fernandes et al . , 2018 ) . Meanwhile , the spectral region between 1413 and 1515 nm is associated with O - H and N - H overtones , which might come from glycoproteins on viral envelopes or antimicrobial peptides from the mosquito immune system ( Burns & Ciurczak , 2008 ; Dai et al . , 2016 ; Xi et al . , 2008 ) . Information on other bands is limited during the study as NIR was just introduced in virology ( Fernandes et al . , 2018 ; Sakudo et al . , 2006 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Figure 8 : ( a ) Raw Vis - NIR absorbance spectra of uninfected and Zika - infected samples , and ( b ) regression coefficient of PLS model based on NIR absorbance spectra from 700 nm to 2350 nm ( Fernandes et al . , 2018 ) 4 . Raman Spectroscopy 4 . 1 Theory of Raman Spectroscopy Scattering occurs when the light of insufficient energy is incident on a molecule and is directed in different directions . When scattered light has the same frequency as the incident light , the scattering is considered elastic ( Auner et al . , 2018 ) . While most light hits a molecule and is scattered elastically in the case of Rayleigh or Mie scattering , some light can be scattered at different frequencies , imparting energy to the molecule . Raman scattering is an example of inelastic scattering because the frequency of scattered light differs from that of incident light ( Auner et al . , 2018 ) . Raman scattering can be divided into two types . Stokes Raman scattering occurs when the light has a longer wavelength upon scattering . In contrast , anti - Stokes Raman scattering occurs when the scattering light has a shorter wavelength than the incident light . Figure 9 illustrates the effects of scattering that occurs on the incident light . Figure 9 : Effect of different types of scattering on the wavelength of scattered light Raman spectroscopy is a non - invasive method that employs Raman scattering . A laser with excitation wavelength of 532 nm is most commonly used in Raman spectroscopy ( Bilal et al . , 2017 ; Desai et al . , 2020 ; Hermann et al . , 2011 ) . However , some studies used other wavelengths of laser such as 633 nm and 785 nm ( Dou et al . , 2020 ; Khan et al . , 2018 ) . It must be noted that different excitation wavelength causes a sample to exhibit different Raman shift . Furthermore , biomolecules such as DNA , RNA and J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 protein in a virus have their own structural heterogeneity , thus , exhibiting different Raman spectra vibrations ( Ruokola et al . , 2014 ) . 4 . 2 Techniques of Raman Spectroscopy in Past Studies Table 2 reveals the list of previous studies employing Raman spectroscopy . Spectra involving Raman spectroscopy is typically reported in terms of Raman shift , defined by the difference in wavenumber of the incident and scattered light . Table 2 : List of previous studies employing Raman spectroscopy on virus samples Author Virus samples Excitation wavelength ( nm ) Raman shift ( cm - 1 ) Findings Hermann et al . ( 2011 ) avipoxvirus ( APV ) , adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) 532 nm 500 cm - 1 to 3000 cm - 1 • Several bands were visible in one of the spectra due to different contributions such as the interaction of the molecules with the Ag coating of the TERS tip . • Clear spectral variations between bands for each spectrum is observed in TERS spectra of AAV . Bilal et al . ( 2017 ) Dengue virus 532 nm 600 – 1800 cm − 1 • The intense Raman bands at 1003 , 1156 and 1516 cm - 1 in healthy serum is suppressed when lactic acid solution is added . • The new peaks appeared around 750 , 830 , 925 , 950 , 1123 , 1333 , 1450 , 1580 and 1730 cm − 1 . Khan et al . ( 2018 ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) 785 nm 500 – 1700 cm − 1 • There is increase in Raman peaks ( 625 , 678 , 748 , 810 , 820 , 950 , 1003 , 1018 and 1275 cm - 1 ) for infected samples . • There is a decrease in Raman peaks ( 128 , 1220 , 1250 and 1650 cm - 1 ) for infected samples compared to healthy samples . Dou et al . ( 2020 ) MS2 / HSV - 2 633 nm 900 – 1700 cm - 1 • The vibrational bands can be assigned to aliphatic group ( 1185 - 1195 , 1340 - 1350 , 1390 and 1479 cm - 1 ) , as well as amino and imino groups ( 1051 - 1068 , 1120 - 1150 and 1168 cm - 1 ) . • There is less β - sheet in MS2 compared to α - helix / unordered protein secondary structure , reflected by smaller Raman peak at 1235 cm - 1 and higher Raman peak at 1260 cm - 1 . Desai et al . ( 2020 ) RNA virus 532 nm 600 to 1800 cm − 1 • Most of the bands in this range of Raman shift are caused by RNA moieties , particularly ribose sugars ( 900 - 1045 cm - 1 ) and phosphate groups ( 1080 - 1100 cm - 1 ) . • Wilcoxon rank - sum test is used for each RNA specific constituent , such as the nitrogenous uracil base , ribose - phosphate , and A / G ring at 780 , 1044 , and 1480 cm - 1 , to determine whether these constituents reflect presence of RNA virus in samples . Carlomagno et al . ( 2021 ) SARS - CoV - 2 785 nm 400 to 1600 cm - 1 • Peaks located at 748 , 922 , 1048 , 1126 and 1249 cm - 1 differentiate salivary samples of healthy patients from that of infected and recovered patients . • Peaks at 1048 and 1126 cm - 1 , which are attributed to environment rich in aromatic amino acids , have significant difference between healthy samples and other samples . Huang et al . ( 2021 ) SARS - CoV - 2 532 nm 400 to 1750 cm - 1 • Based on amide I ( 1600 – 1690 cm - 1 ) and amide III ( 1230 – 1300 cm - 1 ) bands , spike protein in SARS - CoV - 2 exhibits β - sheets / coils , in contrast to that of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV exhibiting α - helix . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 • Raman spectra for spike protein in SARS - CoV - 2 do not change before and after heat treatment , as primary and few secondary structures ( responsible for Raman spectra ) are not destroyed by heat treatment . 4 . 3 Evidence of Raman Spectroscopy Techniques Hermann et al . ( 2011 ) studied avipoxvirus ( APV ) and adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) by conducting tip - enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( TERS ) with Raman shift ranging from 500 cm - 1 to 3000 cm - 1 . The authors obtained Raman spectra of APV and AAV which are illustrated in Figure 10 . A few bands such as in 1417 cm - 1 and 1485 cm - 1 in three single spectra for APV might be due to different contributions such as interactions of molecules with Ag coating of the TERS tip and gradient field effect ( Ayars et al . , 2000 ; Kneipp & Kneipp , 2013 ) . On the other hand , several bands can be recognized and assigned to molecules such as amide I , amide III , and CH 2 stretching ( Hermann et al . , 2011 ) . As for AAV , clear spectral variations such as relative intensities of intensive bands between 1300 cm - 1 and 1425 cm - 1 and splitting of the band at about 1590 cm - 1 are observed . Figure 10 : Raman spectra of ( a ) different particles of APV , and ( b ) different particles of AAV . Far - field is obtained from retracted tip ( Hermann et al . , 2011 ) Bilal et al . ( 2017 ) conducted Raman spectroscopy for screening dengue virus infection in human sera . Raman spectra of healthy and infected sera ranging from 600 cm - 1 to 1800 cm - 1 are illustrated in Figure 11 . There are three Raman peaks with high intensity found in human sera , located at Raman shift of 1003 cm - 1 ( symmetric ring breathing mode of phenylalanine and β - carotene ) , 1156 and 1516 cm - 1 ( β - carotene ) ( Bilal et al . , 2015 ; Movasaghi et al . , 2007 ) . These peaks are suppressed in infected sera , with new additional peaks ( 750 , 830 , 925 , 950 , 1123 , 1333 , 1450 , 1580 , 1680 and 1730 cm - 1 ) formed at different Raman shifts , most probably due to high concentrations of lactate in the infected sera . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 Figure 11 : Raman spectra of normal sera ( green ) and dengue - infected sera ( red ) . The difference in Raman intensity ( blue ) is also plotted on the same axis ( Bilal et al . , 2017 ) In another study conducted by Desai et al . ( 2020 ) , preliminary result showed that most bands in Raman shift between 600 cm - 1 and 1800 cm - 1 are caused by RNA moieties , particularly in the ranges 900 – 1045 cm - 1 ( ribose sugars ) and 1080 – 1100 cm - 1 ( phosphate groups ) . To find out whether these RNA moieties could determine the presence of RNA viruses , Wilcoxon rank - sum test is performed for RNA specific constituent , such as for nitrogenous uracil base ( 780 cm - 1 ) , ribose - phosphate ( 1044 cm - 1 ) and A / G ring ( 1480 cm - 1 ) ( J . H . Chen et al . , 2009 ; De Golder et al . , 2007 ) . It is found that all of these peaks could differentiate healthy samples from infected samples with high statistical confidence ( Desai et al . , 2020 ) . Another study by Huang et al . ( 2021 ) on Raman spectra for spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 compared the spectra of activated spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 with other types of coronaviruses and inactivated spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 . The characteristic Raman bands for amide I ( 1600 – 1690 cm - 1 ) and amide III ( 1230 – 1300 cm - 1 ) are highlighted in Figure 12 ( a ) . This reveals that Raman spectra for amide I / III bands in spike proteins of SARS - CoV - 2 show more obvious β - sheets / coils , while spike proteins for SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV exhibits distinct α - helical components ( J . Huang et al . , 2021 ) . The difference in amide I / III bands in SARS - CoV - 2 compared to other coronaviruses contributes to specificity of Raman spectroscopy in detecting a particular virus . Furthermore , Figure 12 ( b ) reveals that spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 shows an insignificant difference before and after heat treatment . This is because Raman spectra of spike protein in SARS - CoV - 2 is attributed to vibration modes of primary structures and a few secondary structures , most of which are not destroyed by heat treatment ( Tuma , 2005 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 Figure 12 : ( a ) Raman spectra of spike protein in different coronaviruses , and ( b ) Raman spectra of spike protein in SARS - CoV - 2 before and after heat treatment ( Wood et al . , 2021 ) Previous Raman spectroscopy studies used a laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm ( Bilal et al . , 2017 ; Desai et al . , 2020 ; Hermann et al . , 2011 ; J . Huang et al . , 2021 ) . Previous studies that utilized laser with different excitation wavelength observed that peaks assigned to specific functional groups may be different ( Dou et al . , 2020 ; Khan et al . , 2018 ; Wood et al . , 2021 ) . For example , amide III in α - helix protein secondary structure exhibits Raman peak of 1260 cm - 1 with excitation wavelength of 633 nm , but different Raman peak ( 1275 cm - 1 ) is assigned when excitation wavelength of 785 nm is used ( Dou et al . , 2020 ; Khan et al . , 2018 ) . Another study by Khan et al . ( 2018 ) studied Raman spectra of HBV infected sera and healthy samples using laser with excitation wavelength of 785 nm . The Raman spectra of both samples are illustrated in Figure 13 . It is observed that there is an increase ( 625 , 678 , 748 , 810 , 820 , 950 , 1003 , 1018 and 1275 cm - 1 ) and a decrease ( 128 , 1220 , 1250 and 1650 cm - 1 ) in Raman peaks when the samples are infected with HBV . In the infected sera , increased glucose concentration , as indicated by higher Raman peak at 625 cm - 1 ( glucid ) is mainly due to dysfunction of liver ( Baker et al . , 2016 ; Mustoi et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , there is an increase in albumin concentration in blood of infected person , as implied by increased Raman peaks of 1003 cm - 1 with shoulder at 1018 cm - 1 ( phenylalanine ) ( Baker et al . , 2016 ; Movasaghi et al . , 2007 ; Rygula et al . , 2013 ) . The increased concentration of albumin is also implied by increased level of α - helix contents , assigned as increased Raman peak of 1275 cm - 1 ( amide III ) . The decreased Raman peaks of 1220 and 1250 cm - 1 ( coupling of C - N stretching and N - H bending ) are assigned for amide III ( β - sheet ) . This shows that β - sheet concentration is decreased in HBV infected samples , subsequently indicating that interferon secretion by lymphocytes occurs as immune response against HBV infection ( De Gelder et al . , 2007 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 Figure 13 : Raman spectra of healthy and HBV infected sera ( Khan et al . , 2018 ) In a study by Dou et al . ( 2020 ) , Raman spectroscopy with excitation wavelength of 633 nm is also performed on MS2 bacteriophage , apart from AFM - IR . Raman spectra of different MS2 particles exhibits different pattern from MIR absorbance spectra of MS2 . The vibrational bands can be assigned to aliphatic group ( 1185 - 1195 , 1340 - 1350 , 1390 and 1479 cm - 1 ) , as well as amino and imino groups ( 1051 - 1068 , 1120 - 1150 and 1168 cm - 1 ) ( Deckert - Gaudig et al . , 2012 ; Deckert - Gaudig et al . , 2016 ) . The position of amide III bands located at 1235 – 1260 cm - 1 can be used to determine secondary structure of protein as β - sheet at amide III and α - helix / unordered protein secondary structure exhibit Raman peaks of 1235 cm - 1 and 1260 cm - 1 respectively ( Deckert - Gaudig et al . , 2016 ; Kurouski , Van Duyne , & Lednev , 2015 ) . Smaller Raman peak at 1235 cm - 1 reflects less β - sheet in MS2 compared to α - helix / unordered protein secondary structure . A study carried out by Carlomagno et al . ( 2021 ) discriminates salivary sample from patients infected with COVID - 19 ( COV + ) , patients recovered from COVID - 19 ( COV - ) and healthy patients ( CTRL ) . The study was carried out using laser with an excitation wavelength of 785 nm . Figure 14 reveals that peaks located at 748 , 922 , 1048 , 1126 and 1249 cm - 1 , as highlighted by the dark bands , differentiate Raman spectra of different groups . Peaks at 1048 cm - 1 and 1126 cm - 1 are the most significant in differentiating Raman spectra of the healthy patient from those of infected and recovered patients respectively . The significant difference at 1048 cm - 1 and 1126 cm - 1 are associated with an environment rich in aromatic amino acids , particularly tryptophan and phenylalanine . The presence of aromatic amino acids in virus spike glycoproteins caused regions rich in tryptophan , which are involved in the interaction between SARS - CoV - 2 and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme type 2 ( ACE2 ) ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 Figure 14 : Raman spectra of salivary sample from healthy patients ( CTRL ) , COVID - 19 infected patients ( COV + ) , and patients recovered from COVID - 19 ( COV - ) . The difference in spectra is highlighted by dark bands ( Carlomagno et al . , 2021 ) 5 . Fluorescence spectroscopy 5 . 1 Theory of Fluorescence Spectroscopy Fluorescence is the phenomenon where fluorophore in the sample absorbs light at a shorter wavelength and emits light at a longer wavelength , usually in visible spectrum . Fluorophore usually contains aromatic rings such as fluorescein , tyrosine and tryptophan ( Bose et al . , 2018 ) . Fluorescence occurs when an electron transitions from singlet ground state to singlet excited state during light absorption , and jumps to an allowable vibrational level before returning to ground state ( Bose et al . , 2018 ) . These processes are illustrated in Figure 15 . Both fluorescence and Raman scattering involve absorption and emission of light at different wavelengths . However , fluorescence occurs when the electron jumps from the ground state to the excited state , while Raman scattering involves the electron transitioning between the ground state and virtual state ( Auner et al . , 2018 ; Bose et al . , 2018 ) . Fluorescence spectroscopy on the detection of virus is usually supplemented with fluorescent tags such as aptamers , nanoparticles , and quantum dots to aid fluorescence quenching or improve fluorescence signal from viral particles ( Lukose et al . , 2021 ; Pramanik et al . , 2021 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 Figure 15 : Electronic transition and vibrational relaxation in fluorescence and Raman scattering 5 . 2 Techniques of Fluorescence Spectroscopy in Past Studies Table 3 reveals the list of previous studies employing fluorescence spectroscopy in detecting virus in samples . The description includes excitation wavelength of laser used in the study and other relevant information related to molecules used in addition to virus samples . Table 3 : List of previous studies employing fluorescence spectroscopy on virus samples Author Virus samples Description Findings Huang et al . ( 2016 ) Hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) • Laser with excitation wavelength of 485 nm is used . Emission wavelength is fixed at 528 nm • Aptamer linked with gold nanoparticle is used as aptasensor in detecting HBeAg . The reaction time is 2 mins • Fluorescence intensity of aptasensor at 528 nm increases at higher concentration of HBeAg • The increase does not occur when other proteins such as HBcAg and trypsin are tested Yang et al . ( 2020 ) Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) • Laser with excitation wavelength of 290 nm is used • Molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP ) acts as fluorophore in detecting JEV • The reaction time for fluorescence is 20 min • JEV enhanced peak of fluorescence intensity of MIP at 340 nm . • The peak of fluorescence intensity of MIP is higher with increasing concentration of JEV . • Significantly higher fluorescence intensity of MIP is observed in presence of JEV , compared to other viruses . Piva et al . ( 2020 ) Human respiratory syncytial virus ( hRSV ) • Laser with excitation wavelength of 290 nm is used • Interaction between M 2 - 1 and flavonoids ( HST and HSD ) are studied based on fluorescence specta • Both flavonoids effectively quenches fluorescence signal from M 2 - 1 protein . • HST has higher binding affinity towards M 2 - 1 protein compared to HSD , indicated by lower fluorescence intensity for HST at similar concentrations . Santos et al . ( 2020 ) Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) , • Laser with excitation wavelength ranging from 250 – 320 nm is used , with steps of 10 nm • Peak fluorescence intensity between 300 – 415 nm is due to fluorophore . Infected samples ( CHIKV and DENV ) exhibit lower peaks at this range . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 dengue virus ( DENV ) • Additional model such as PARAFAC and PLSDA are employed • PARAFAC - QDA is proved to be the most effective model in differentiating all three types of samples ( uninfected , CHIKV , DENV ) Pramanik et al .

The reaction time is set as 10 min • In the absence of SARS - CoV - 2 antigen or virus particles , gold nanostar effectively quenches the fluorescence signal from the dye . • SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein binds with DNA aptamer , increasing the distance between gold nanostar and the dye . Consequently , the fluorescence signal increases . This does not occur when spike protein of flu virus or rotavirus is used . 5 . 3 Evidence of Fluorescence Spectroscopy Techniques A study by Huang et al . ( 2016 ) developed aptasensor , consisting of aptamer linked gold nanoparticles in detecting hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) in a sample . The study used laser with excitation wavelength of 485 nm and detected fluorescence from sample at emission wavelength of 528 nm . The aptasensor is proven to detect HBeAg with high sensitivity and specificity . The result showed that fluorescence intensity at 528 nm increases with higher concentration of HBeAg . This is because the aptasensor labelled with fluorescent dye hybridizes with Dabcyl modified probe Q to form DNA duplex in the absence of HBeAg ( R . Huang et al . , 2016 ) . This leads to quenching of fluorescence signal from the aptasensor , which explains low fluorescence intensity in the absence of HBeAg . The increase in fluorescence intensity does not occur when other proteins such as HBcAg and trypsin are tested at higher concentration , indicating high specificity of the aptasensor . Yang et al . ( 2020 ) studied on detection of Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) by synthesizing viral molecularly imprinted polymers ( MIP ) based on metal organic framework . The study used a laser with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and the reaction time is 20 minutes . The study showed that the presence of JEV improved the fluorescence signal from MIP due to energy transferred from JEV to MIP ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Figure 16 showed that the fluorescence intensity peak of MIP at 340 nm is higher with increasing concentration of JEV , which enhances sensitivity in detecting JEV . It is also found that MIP has high specificity in detecting JEV , as its fluorescence intensity is significantly higher in the presence of JEV , compared to other viruses such as hepatitis A , rabies and leprosy . Figure 16 : Fluorescence spectra of MIP at different concentrations of JEV ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) A study conducted by Piva et al . ( 2020 ) utilized fluorescence in studying the interaction between M 2 - 1 protein in human respiratory syncytical virus ( hRSV ) with hesperetin ( HST ) and hesperidin ( HSD ) as J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 21 flavonoids . The study used laser with excitation wavelength of 290 nm . Figure 17 ( a ) and 17 ( b ) show that peak fluorescence intensity due to M 2 - 1 protein decreases with higher concentration of respective flavonoids . This is because both flavonoids affect molecular nanoenvironment of fluorophores in the protein , effectively quenching the fluorescence intensity ( Piva et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , lower fluorescence intensity is observed when HST at concentration of 26 μ M is present in the sample , compared to HSD at similar concentrations . This indicates that HST is more effective in quenching fluorescence from M 2 - 1 protein . This is because glycosylation in HST decreases the binding affinity of protein , consequently reducing the interaction of HST with M 2 - 1 protein ( H . Cao et al . , 2009 ; Piva et al . , 2020 ) . Figure 17 : Fluorescence spectra of hRSV MS 2 - 1 protein in absence and prescence of ( a ) hesperetin ( HST ) , and ( b ) hesperidin ( HSD ) at different concentrations ( Piva et al . , 2020 ) Santos et al . ( 2020 ) conducted a study on differentiating healthy serum samples from infected serum samples caused by chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) and dengue virus ( DENV ) . The laser used in the study has excitation wavelength ranging from 250 nm to 320 nm , with 10 nm increment . Fluorescence spectra for both uninfected and infected serum samples revealed that the high peak is present at emission wavelength , ranging from 300 nm to 415 nm . This occurs due to endogenous fluorophores in the samples ( Conklin et al . , 2009 ) . However , the infected samples exhibit lower peak , which may be due to chemical virus - cell interactions ( Santos et al . , 2020 ) . The study further employed several models to differentiate all three types of samples , and concluded that parallel factor analysis with quadratic discriminant analysis ( PARAFAC - QDA ) is the most efficient model . In a recent study conducted by Pramanik et al . ( 2021 ) , fluorescence is used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 antigen or virus particles . Gold nanostar ( GNS ) is attached with Rhodamine 6G ( Rh - 6G ) dye conjugated DNA aptamer . This is because GNS can effectively quench fluorescence signal from the dye via nanoparticle surface energy transfer ( NSET ) ( Carnevale et al . , 2018 ) . Based on Figure 18 , the aptamer - attached GNS exhibits high peak fluorescence intensity at around 550 nm when SARS - CoV - 2 antigen is present . This is because the aptamer binds with spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 , increasing the distance between GNS and the dye . Consequently , the GNS cannot quench fluorescence signal from the dye , and high peak fluorescence intensity is observed ( Pramanik et al . , 2021 ) . GNS is shown to be specific with SARS - CoV - 2 antigen or virus particles as high peak fluorescence intensity is observed when SARS - CoV - 2 antigen at concentration of 10 pg / mL is present . This is not observed for other antigens such as flu virus or rotavirus , both of which are present at concentrations of 100 pg / mL respectively . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 Figure 18 : Fluorescence spectra of Rh - 6G conjugated DNA aptamer - attached GNS in absence and presence of SARS - CoV - 2 antigen ( 10 pg / mL ) , flu virus ( 100 pg / mL ) and rotavirus ( 100 pg / mL ) ( Pramanik et al . , 2021 ) 6 . Conclusion It has been shown that UV spectroscopy research is not very much conducted in recent previous studies involving virus infected samples . At sufficiently high intensities of UV , RNA of the virus may degrade via dimer formation mechanism as shown in Figure 1 . In fact , UV spectroscopy of virus samples have been related to studies involving irradiation of the virus . Meanwhile , several studies have focused on virus samples that employ IR and Raman spectroscopy to determine the molecules present via vibration and overtones of the molecules . Out of all three types of IR radiation , NIR and MIR are most commonly used in studies involving virus samples . MIR ' s spectral data can be easily processed because data acquisition involving MIR has been equipped with either Fourier transform or atomic force microscopy . NIR usually requires simpler instrumentation than MIR , but spectral data acquired from NIR does not directly provide peaks that indicate vibrational modes of certain molecule . Thus , analysis of NIR spectral data usually involves additional step , which includes PCA and PLS plot . Raman spectroscopy is also commonly used in the study involving virus samples . Instrumentation involving Raman spectroscopy is more complicated , but the spectral data obtained is very easy to analyse and does not usually require additional steps . Raman peaks from spectral data can be directly analysed for the determination of molecules via their own unique vibrational modes . Fluorescence spectroscopy has been proven to detect certain virus with high specificity . Unlike IR and Raman spectroscopy which relies on assignment of peaks in spectra , fluorescence spectroscopy relies on the interaction between viral particles and fluorescent tags either for improvement or quenching of fluorescence signal from virus . Due to destructive properties of UV , future studies may not use UV spectroscopy to study virus samples . However , it is possible to still conduct UV spectroscopy on virus , provided that the intensity of UV is not sufficiently high to cause degradation of virus samples . In contrast , IR and Raman spectroscopy will be continuously used for future studies , especially with the recently emerged COVID - 19 pandemic . Both spectroscopy methods are non - invasive and provide useful information about the virus molecules . Meanwhile , fluorescence spectroscopy methods are also expected to be used continuously for future studies as they have been proven to detect viral particles with high specificity , despite additional fluorescent tags and required reaction time .
