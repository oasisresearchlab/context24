In yeast , the critical 16 attachment components are the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes ( Ndc80c and DASH / Dam1c , 17 respectively ) . Ndc80c is an 600 - Å long heterotetramer that binds microtubules through a globular 18 " head " at one end and centromere - proximal kinetochore components through a globular knob at the 19 other end . Dam1c is a heterodecamer that forms a ring of 16 - 17 protomers around the shaft of the 20 single kinetochore microtubule in point - centromere yeast . The ring coordinates the approximately 21 eight Ndc80c rods per kinetochore . In published work , we showed that a site on the globular " head " 22 of Ndc80c , including residues from both Ndc80 and Nuf2 , binds a bipartite segment in the long , C - 23 terminal extension of Dam1 . Results reported here show , both by in vitro binding experiments and by 24 crystal structure determination , that the same site binds a conserved segment in the long N - terminal 25 extension of Mps1 and a similarly conserved segment in the N - terminal extension of Ipl1 ( yeast 26 Aurora B ) . Together with results from experiments in yeast cells and from biochemical assays 27 reported in two accompanying papers , the structures and graded affinities identify a communication 28 hub for ensuring uniform bipolar attachment and for signaling anaphase onset . 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 2 Introduction 36 Faithful chromosome segregation in cell division requires bipolar spindle attachment of all sister 37 chromatid pairs . Tension between two sister kinetochores signals biorientation , as the chromosome 38 arms are still cohesin - linked [ 1 - 3 ] . Multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events , in which 39 the protein kinases Mps1 and Aurora B ( Ipl1 in S . cerevisiae ) are instrumental [ 4 - 18 ] transduce the 40 signals reporting attachment / detachment or tension / no - tension , deferring anaphase onset until all 41 kinetochore pairs have attached to opposite spindle poles ( the " spindle assembly checkpoint " : SAC , 42 reviewed in [ 19 ] ) . These kinases have interrelated and apparently redundant roles in the error 43 correction needed to achieve uniform biorientation ; that is , they participate actively in generating 44 correct attachments , by modifying various kinetochore components , rather than simply reporting 45 attached and unattached states [ 1 , 9 , 17 , 20 , 21 ] . Their activities are also important at stages of cell 46 division other than the assembly of an anaphase - competent mitotic apparatus , adding further 47 complexity to analysis of their specific functions . 48 The components of the spindle microtubule attachment machinery in yeast are the Ndc80 and Dam1 49 complexes ( Ndc80c and DASH / Dam1c , respectively ) . Ndc80c , a heterotetramer of Ndc80 , Nuf2 , 50 Spc24 , and Spc25 , is a 600 Å long rod , largely two - chain coiled - coil , with an Ndc80 / Nuf2 globular 51 " head " at one end and an Spc24 / Spc25 globular knob at the other [ 22 , 23 ] . The Ndc80 and Nuf2 52 globular regions are both calponin - homology ( CH ) domains [ 24 , 25 ] . Together with an approximately 53 100 - residue , N - terminal extension , the Ndc80 CH domain forms the principal microtubule contact [ 26 , 54 27 ] . DASH / Dam1c is a heterodecamer , about 17 copies of which form a ring around the microtubule 55 shaft at the kinetochore ( plus ) end [ 28 - 31 ] . Through contacts from C - terminal extensions of four 56 Dam1c components , Dam1 , Ask1 , and Spc19 / Spc34 , the ring organizes the multiple Ndc80 rods 57 ( estimated to be about eight : [ 32 ] ) surrounding the single kinetochore microtubule [ 31 , 33 ] . 58 Major targets of Mps1 are a set of so - called MELT repeats on Spc105 / Knl1 , components of an 59 intermediate , " adaptor " complex that links Ndc80c with centromere - proximal assemblies , which in turn 60 recruit the SAC signaling components [ 34 , 35 ] . Loss of Mps1 activity leads to prompt 61 dephosphorylation of Spc105 / Knl1 and therefore loss of a contribution to the SAC from the 62 kinetochore in question [ 4 , 36 ] . Mps1 associates with the globular , Ndc80 : Nuf2 head of Ndc80c , the 63 main microtubule ( MT ) attachment component of kinetochores in nearly all eukaryotes [ 37 , 38 ] . 64 Studies of the metazoan kinase have suggested that MTs and Mps1 compete for Ndc80c binding , 65 leading to the view that binding of Mps1 reports an unattached Ndc80c and that attachment ejects it 66 [ 37 , 38 ] . Experiments with isolated yeast kinetochores indicate that autophosphorylation of Mps1 may 67 be sufficient to release it from Ndc80c [ 39 ] , and an accompanying paper [ 40 ] shows directly that yeast 68 Mps1 occpancy is fully compatible with microtubule binding , while also suggesting that 69 3 autophosphorylation alone may not fully explain the dynamics of Mps1 in cells . The difference 70 between the two sets of observations could reflect a difference between metazoan and yeast Mps1 , 71 as additional contacts with Ndc80 may be present in the former [ 38 ] involving an Mps1 N - terminal 72 segment that has no homologous representation in the latter ( see Discussion ) . 73 Substrates of Ipl1 in yeast include the Ndc80c ( in particular , the N - terminal extension of Ndc80 ) and 74 the DASH / Dam1 complex ( Dam1c ) [ 8 , 10 , 17 , 41 , 42 ] . Phosphorylation of certain Ser / Thr residues in 75 these complexes weakens microtubule attachment . Absence of tension presumably favors Ipl1 76 access to these sites , thereby promoting error correction . In the case of syntely , for example , in which 77 both sister chromatids are attached to the same pole , phosphorylation would weaken the contact , 78 ultimately freeing one or both of the sister kinetochores to " try again " and reconnect correctly . 79 Ipl1 / AuroraB is the catalytic component of the heterotetrameric chromosome passenger complex 80 ( CPC ) [ 43 ] . A long , potentially extended connector , Sli15 / INCENP , links Ipl1 at one end with two 81 regulatory subunits , Bir1 / Survivin and Nbl1 / Borealin , at the other end . Bir1 dependent association of 82 the CPC with centromeres during the onset of mitosis has led to the suggestion that the length of the 83 INCENP " tether " could determine the likelihood of Ndc80 phosphorylation and that an increase under 84 tension of the distance between centromeric chromatin and the Ipl1 sites on the Ndc80 N - terminal 85 extension could be part of the tension - sensing mechanism [ 44 ] . Some studies in yeast have 86 questioned this picture of a distance gradient , however , and an alternative model postulates local , 87 tension - induced changes at the Ndc80 - MT interface that sequester the Ipl1 target sites or reduce the 88 frequency of their dissociation [ 45 , 46 ] . 89 Sorting out the interrelated functions of Mps1 and Ipl1 clearly requires direct structural pictures of their 90 association with kinetochore components . We show here , biochemically and structurally , that both 91 Mps1 and Ipl1 bind the site on the Ndc80 / Nuf2 head of Ndc80c that we have shown previously to bind 92 an Ipl1 - phosphoregulated peptide segment near the C - terminus of Dam1 [ 47 ] . The segment of Mps1 93 that associates with Ndc80c is in the middle of the ~ 430 - residue N - terminal extension of the kinase 94 domain ; the associating segment of Ipl1 is in a much shorter N - terminal extension of the kinase 95 domain . The binding motifs are conserved in their key features across point - centromere yeast . 96 In related work , Pleuger et al [ 40 ] and Parnell et al [ 48 ] have characterized Mps1 : Ndc80c interactions 97 both in vivo and in vitro ; their analyses of mutant phenotypes together show the functional relevance 98 of contacts in the Mps1 : Ndc80c structure reported here . The common binding surface for Dam1 , 99 Mps1 , and Ipl1 on the Ndc80c head is thus a central communication point for establishing the SAC , 100 for triggering error correction and ultimately silencing the SAC , and for generating robust , bipolar 101 attachments as the outcome . 102 4 Results 103 Mps1 interaction with Ndc80c 104 The long , N - terminal extension ( residues 1 - 430 ) of yeast Mps1 has no immediately evident homology 105 with sequences in metazoan Mps1 shown to interact with Ndc80c . Genetic analysis has suggested 106 that residues 151 - 200 function in kinetochore biorientation , while residues 201 - 300 function in spindle - 107 pole body duplication [ 49 ] . We examined conservation among the yeast orthologs by iterative 108 searches with Jackhmmer [ 50 ] . Using the N - terminal 430 residues of S . cerevisiae Mps1 as query , we 109 identified five segments conserved to one degree or another among point - centromere yeasts ( Fig . 110 1A ) . We carried out a set of pulldown experiments , expressing them as GST - fusions and incubating 111 them with the " dwarf " Ndc80c construct ( Ndc80c dwarf ) [ 51 ] immobilized on Ni - NTA agarose ( Fig . 1B ) . In 112 this format , we expected avidity from GST dimerization and multivalent display of Ndc80c to enhance 113 the assay sensitivity . Ndc80c captured only the GST fusion of a peptide containing residues 151 - 171 114 ( Fig . 1B , lane 12 ) , which included the most conserved region with a consensus sequence 115 ( 151 ) RRxRRF ( I / L / F ) ( 3 - 4x ) RxxxLGPAxR ( 170 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Lysine appears occasionally in place of 116 arginine , except for the invariant R at the end of the motif . The consensus is an essentially bipartite 117 motif , with a set of basic residues and two hydrophobic residues at one end connected somewhat 118 variably to GPAxR at the other . A multi - chain Alphafold2 ( AF2 ) prediction [ 52 ] in which the input was 119 Mps1 residues 150 - 200 , Ndc80 residues 114 - 335 , and Nuf2 residues 1 - 173 showed an interaction 120 that included the consensus motif ( Fig . S1A ) . We used this prediction to restrict the length of the 121 peptide used for binding experiments , as described in the next section , and to design the construct 122 that yielded a crystal structure . 123 124 Binding of Mps1 and Mps1 mutant peptides to Ndc80c 125 We measured by fluorescence polarization the affinity of Mps1 for a peptide comprising residues 137 - 126 171 . We labeled the peptide at its N - terminus with the Bodipy fluorophore and titrated Ndc80c dwarf 127 ( Fig . 2A ) . We then used unlabeled peptide and peptide mutants in a competition format , at a fixed 128 dwarf Ndc80c concentration ( Figs . 2B , C ) . The mutants correspond to mutations characterized in one 129 of the accompanying papers [ 40 ] . The Mps1 peptide displaced the fluorescent Mps1 peptide , at a 130 concentration consistent with the affinity measured by direct titration . Mutating either the basic 131 residues or the hydrophobic residues in the first part of the consensus motif or the conserved arginine 132 at the end of the second part lowered affinity ( raised the Ki ) by roughly two logs ; mutating both the 133 final arginine and the hydrophobic residues eliminated any detectable competition altogether . 134 135 We also determined the binding of the Mps1 peptide with two Ndc80c dwarf constructs bearing 136 mutations characterized in one of the accompanying papers - - N128A and F8A P9A [ 48 ] . In both 137 cases , the Mps1 peptide affinity was about 2 logs weaker than for the wild - type protein ( Fig . 2D ) . 138 5 139 Structure of Ndc80c chimera with Mps1 binding motif 140 We validated conclusions from the competition binding experiments and AF2 predictions by 141 determining x - ray crystal structures of Ndc80c dwarf associated with the corresponding peptide 142 segments from Mps1 and Ipl1 . We applied the strategy we used to determine the Dam1 - Ndc80c 143 interaction [ 47 ] , by generating chimeras with the C - terminus of the Mps1 or Ipl1 peptide joined to the 144 N - terminus of Nuf2 as a continuous polypeptide chain . Because Ndc80c dwarf , designed originally to 145 show the structure of the four - chain junction between the Ndc80 : Nuf2 and Spc24 : Spc25 146 heterodimeric components , crystallizes readily [ 51 ] , it is a useful scaffold for constructing these 147 chimeric proteins . 148 149 The Mps1 : Ndc80c dwarf chimera crystallized in space group C2221 ( a = 72 . 5 Å , b = 168 . 5 Å , c = 229 . 6 150 Å ) . We recorded diffraction data to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2 . 9 Å and determined the structure 151 as described in Methods ( Fig . 3A ; Table S1 ) . Conservation of residues in the aligned Mps1 152 sequences for point - centromere yeasts indicates a bipartite motif ( Fig . 1C ) : two conserved six - residue 153 segments separated by 7 or 8 more variable residues . Contacts in the structure are consistent with 154 these conservations and with the conservation of residues in Ndc80 : Nuf2 with which the two six - 155 residue segments interact . Fig . S1B shows a comparison of the AF2 prediction and the crystal 156 structure . 157 158 The N - terminal six residues of the motif ( RRSKRF ) form a short helix , which has a set of contacts with 159 conserved glutamate residues in a H of Ndc80 and with conserved features of Nuf2 ( Fig . 3B ) . In the 160 crystal structure , the guanidinium groups of R152 and R154 both bridge to the carboxylate of Ndc80 161 E166 , and the side - chain NH3 + of K153 projects to the carboxylate of Ndc80 E162 . The conserved 162 phenylalanine , Mps1 F156 , inserts into a hydrophobic pocket lined by Ndc80 L169 , L170 and F172 , 163 and Nuf2 M154 , with a further contribution from Mps1 L157 ( Fig . 3B ) . 164 165 The C - terminal six residues ( LGPAKR ) of the Mps1 motif extend across Nuf2 a G , with contacts from 166 residues 128 and 130 - 132 ( conserved in point - centromere yeast ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Asn 128 , conserved not 167 only in yeasts but also in metazoans , anchors the end of the motif with hydrogen bonds between its 168 side - chain amide and the main - chain amide and carbonyl of K169 ( the penultimate residue in the 169 motif ) , thus mimicking the hydrogen bonds in an antiparallel b - sheet . This interaction positions the 170 invariant arginine of the motif to salt bridge with Ndc80 Asp295 , likewise conserved in both metazoans 171 and yeast . 172 173 6 The structure rationalizes the phenotypes of mutants studied in the two accompanying papers , 174 several of which we have incorporated into the binding measurements reported above . Our 175 description of contacts with the N - terminal part of the bipartite motif can account for the effects of 176 Mps1 mutations of basic and hydrophobic residues described in Pleuger et al [ 40 ] ( designated there 177 as br and hm mutants , respectively ) . They have also examined phosphomimetic and alanine 178 mutations at S159 , T162 , and T163 , all of which are at the Mps1 : Nuf2 interface , in the loop between 179 the two parts of the full motif . We expect that phosphorylation of T162 in particular , which faces a 180 hydrophobic surface on Nuf2 , at the junction between helices G and H , would displace that part of the 181 bound peptide and presumably reduce affinity , but a displaced conformation would probably still allow 182 the key residues in the binding motif to dock correctly . 183 184 Particular strong phenotypes among the Nuf2 mutations studies by Parnell et al [ 48 ] are at conserved 185 residues F8P9 ( mutated together ) , S124 , and N128 . We have described above the role of N128 in 186 buttressing the bound peptide ; it has the same key role in binding Dam1 [ 47 ] . Residues F8 and P9 187 together bury the hydrogen - bonding interactions of N128 with the main chain of the penultimate 188 residue in the Mps1 and Dam1 binding motifs and probably contribute both to the strength of those 189 interactions and to correct positioning of the invariant arginine to salt bridge with Ndc80 D295 . 190 Phosphorylation of Nuf2 Ser124 would displace F8 and generally reposition the Nuf2 N - terminal loop . 191 192 Ipl1 interaction with Ndc80c 193 Ipl1 and Mps1 both phosphorylate residues in the N - terminal extension of Ndc80 [ 7 , 8 , 34 , 53 ] . 194 Documented Ipl1 kinetochore contacts are between its CPC partners , Sli15 / INCENP and 195 Bir1 / survivin , and the inner - kinetochore COMA complex and the CBF3 component Ndc10 , 196 respectively [ 54 - 56 ] . In the CPC , a long , largely flexible segment ( ~ 600 residues ) of Sli15 / INCENP 197 intervenes between the N - terminal region that interacts with Bir1 and Nbl1 and the segment that 198 interacts with the Ipl1 kinase domain . There is also an approximately 100 - residue , N - terminal 199 extension of the Ipl1 kinase domain itself ( Fig . 4A ) . We examined whether Ipl1 might attach directly to 200 Ndc80 : Nuf2 through contacts in this region by carrying out an AF2 prediction similar to the ones we 201 had run for Mps1 . Although the per - residue confidence level was much lower than for the Mps1 202 sequence ( Fig . S1C ) , the interactions of the Ipl1 peptide were consistent from structure to structure 203 among the 25 " top " predictions ouput by the program . Moreover , the key motif , SKIPSP ( V / I ) R , is 204 present with slight variation , in Ipl1 / AuroraB from other point - centromere yeast ( Fig . 4B ) . The 205 prediction suggested close overlap with the Mps1 interaction , with the final arginine of the motif 206 conserved among point centromere yeast in both proteins . S . cerevisiae Ipl1 has two copies of the 207 motif , while many other point - centromere yeasts have just one . The AF2 predictions split relatively 208 evenly between the two alternatives in the S . cerevisiae sequence . 209 7 210 We measured the Ipl1 peptide affinity , both directly and comparatively , with competition results that 211 strongly supported site - overlap for all three ( Fig . 2 ) . The Ipl1 peptide bound more weakly than the 212 other two , but avidity contributed by the two copies of the conserved motif would likely enhance 213 binding of the intact protein . 214 215 Structure of Ndc80c chimera with Ipl1 binding motif 216 We generated a chimeric construct that fused Ipl1 residues 45 - 59 to the N - terminus of Ndc80c dwarf 217 Nuf2 . The chimera crystallized in space group P43212 ( a = b = 115Å , c = 424Å ) , with two complexes in 218 the asymmetric unit related by a non - crystallographic dyad . We recorded anisotropic diffraction data 219 to a minimum Bragg spacing of 3 . 9Å , but intensities of reflections in the a * and b * directions fell below 220 significance at Bragg spacings of ~ 6 Å . Despite the poorly ordered crystals , we determined phases 221 by molecular replacement and calculated an electron density map at a nominal resolution of 6 Å ( see 222 Methods ) . When phased only on the molecular - replacement model , a difference map showed strong 223 density for ordered parts of the Ipl1 segment and a structure overall that was consistent with the AF2 224 prediction between Ipl1 residues 48 and 56 ( Fig . 4 , Fig . S1D ) . The density for this segment was 225 continuous with that for the Nuf2 subunit of the non - crystallographic - symmetry related complex ( Fig . 226 S2 ) . Thus , the asymmetric unit is a " domain - swapped " dimer , and the interactions may have been 227 essential for the crystals to form . Formation of the dimer by contacts in trans shows that binding of 228 the Ipl1 segment in the location detected was not an artificial consequence of having fused it to the N - 229 terminus of Nuf2 . 230 231 Comparison of Mps1 , Ipl1 and Dam1 interactions with Ndc80c 232 Dam1 and Mps1 interact with the head of Ndc80c through segments in extended regions of their 233 polypeptide chains . The competition experiment with the Dam1 peptide indicates that the Mps1 and 234 Dam1 segments have very similar affinities for Ndc80c ( Fig . 2B ) . The consensus sequence motif in 235 both cases has two distinct parts , with a linker of variable length between them . The first part of the 236 motif includes two or more basic residues followed by two hydrophobic residues ; the second part , a 237 tetrapeptide terminating in an invariant arginine . The contacts on Ndc80c are likewise conserved . 238 The basic residues at the N - terminal end of the bipartite motif pair with conserved glutamic - acid 239 residues on Ndc80 ( Glu 269 , 272 , 276 , S . cerevisiae numbering ) ; the specific pairing may vary from 240 ortholog to ortholog , as both arginine and glutamic - acid side chains can adopt multiple configurations . 241 The pair of hydrophobic residues fits into a pocket between Nuf2 helices A and G . The invariant 242 arginine at the end of the motif pairs though a salt bridge with Asp295 ( S . cerevisiae numbering ) , 243 likewise invariant ( or in a few cases , glutamic acid ) among point - centromere yeast . In so doing , it 244 reaches across and caps the C - terminus of Ndc80 helix H . The interaction of Asn128 ( S . cerevisiae 245 8 numbering ) with the main - chain hydrogen - bonding groups of the residues preceding the arginine is 246 likewise universal , even in metazoans [ 38 ] . The conformations of the Mps1 and Dam1 peptides three 247 residues to either side of the invariant arginine are the same , within the likely accuracy of the structure 248 in that region and the presence of nearby crystal lattice contacts . 249 250 The Ipl1 consensus includes the essential features of the second part of the bipartite motif , but not 251 those of the first . Moreover , the map , even though restricted to Bragg spacings greater than 6 Å , did 252 not show clear density for polypeptide chain N - terminal to Ile 48 ( or Ile 74 , if fit with the other copy of 253 the motif ) . The conformation of the peptide between residues 50 and 56 ( or 76 and 82 ) appears to be 254 very similar to that of the Mps1 motif , and hence also to the Dam1 peptide , even though the starting 255 point for fitting the peptide was independent of the Mps1 structure . 256 257 The equilibrium dissociation constants of peptides for dwarf Ndc80c , as measured by direct titration 258 with the relevant fluorescent peptide for Mps1 and Ipl1 , are 280 nM and 18 . 8 µ M , respectively ( Fig . 259 2A ) . Their ratio is similar to the ratio ( to wild - type ) of the affinities of the Mps1 peptides in which 260 residues in the first part of the bipartite motif have been mutated ( Fig . 2C ) , consistent with the 261 absence of the first part of the motif in Ipl1 and with the similarity of its motif with the second part of 262 the bipartite Mps1 and Dam1 motifs . 263 264 Discussion 265 The results presented above show that peptide segments in the flexible , N - terminal extensions of both 266 Mps1 and Ipl1 bind a site on the head of Ndc80c that is essentially the same as the site bound by a 267 segment in the C - terminal extension of Dam1 . Ndc80c connects the centromere - proximal 268 components of a kinetochore with the MTs of the mitotic spindle , and the DASH / Dam1c coordinates 269 multiple Ndc80 complexes , thereby enabling end - on kinetochore - MT attachment . The Ndc80c head 270 is thus a communication hub for ensuring a robust linkage between centromere and spindle and for 271 integrating the SAC with tension sensing and error correction . 272 273 Mps1 is the sole co - purifying kinase on isolated , unattached kinetochores [ 34 ] [ 17 ] . We can infer that 274 it is probably bound with Ndc80c through the contact described here , although there could be 275 additional , so far undetected , interactions with segments elsewhere in the long N - terminal extension . 276 Side - on attachment need not displace Mps1 , and even end - on attachment , which requires the 277 Dam1c / DASH , need not do so , as it includes contacts between Ndc80 and both Ask1 and 278 Spc19 / Spc34 . Moreover , there are approximately 8 copies of Ndc80c in prometaphase / metaphase 279 [ 32 ] , and 16 - 17 copies of Dam1 in a single Dam1c / DASH ring [ 31 ] . Thus , even for the single 280 9 kinetochore - microtubule attachment found in point - centromere yeast , mixed states are likely , in which 281 Mps1 continues to be present ( at decreasing levels ) and hence continues to activate the SAC , until 282 fully displaced by ( dephosphorylated ) Dam1 . Autophosphorylation of Mps1 appears to result in its 283 release ( in vitro ) from kinetochore association [ 39 ] , but the relevant sites have not been determined . 284 There are no serines or threonines in conserved positions within the bipartite motif , ruling out a direct 285 regulation by phosphorylation of the Ndc80c interacting segment analyzed here . 286 287 In human Mps1 , two distinct regions have been implicated in kinetochore interaction : a short N - 288 terminal segment preceding a three - repeat TPR domain ( features absent in yeast Mps1 ) and a 289 conserved segment in the long " middle region " that links the TPR motifs with the kinase domain at the 290 C - terminus [ 38 ] . Mutation of residues on the surface of the Ndc80 CH domain appear to affect 291 binding of the former ; mutation of N126 ( corresponding to N128 in S . cerevisiae ) to alanine interferes 292 with binding of the latter . The sequence of the conserved , Mps1 middle - region segment includes a 293 QSCPFGR motif , with invariant arginine in various vertebrate species ; AF2 yields very high 294 confidence binding of that segment ( and several residues C - terminal to it ) at the site in the human 295 Ndc80c head corresponding precisely to the communication hub site we have characterized in yeast 296 ( Fig . S4A ) . The Nuf2 interaction thus appears to be present in metazoans as well as in yeast . 297 298 Several lines of evidence suggest that Mps1 may under some circumstances recruit DASH / Dam1c to 299 kinetochores , by modification of residues on Dam1 or on another component of the heterodecameric 300 complex [ 48 , 57 ] . Principal candidates are Dam1 residues Ser218 and Ser 221 , which are part of a 301 conserved motif in point - centromere yeast Dam1 ( 218 - S / TxASFVxNP - 226 , S . cerevisiae numbering , 302 preceded by several negatively charged residues ) [ 58 ] . Available structural information does not 303 provide hypotheses about possible binding partners or about autoinhibition mechanisms for ring 304 formation that might involve this short , conserved motif , although conservation suggests a defined 305 function . The other reported Mps1 site in Dam1 , Thr15 , is part of the N - terminal " staple " that connects 306 one DASH protomer with another ; phosphorylation of Thr15 by Mps1 , like that of Ser20 by Ipl1 , might 307 therefore disfavor ring formation , rather than stabilize it [ 59 ] . 308 309 Ipl1 / Aurora B has at least two distinct roles in regulating kinetochore assembly and attachment . 310 Phosphorylation of Dsn1 activates the MIND / Mis12 complex by relieving autoinhibition and allowing 311 binding of Mif2 / CENP - C and Ame1 to sites on the Mtw1 - Nnf1 globular " head [ 60 , 61 ] [ 62 , 63 ] . 312 Subsequently , the kinase mediates error correction and reverses end - on attachment in the absence of 313 tension by phosphorylating both the Ndc80 N - terminal extension and at least three components of 314 DASH / Dam1c - - Dam1 itself , Ask1 , and Spc34 [ 33 ] - - or the Ska complex in metazoans [ 64 ] . In yeast , 315 binding of Bir1 with Ndc10 can recruit Ipl1 early in kinetochore assembly , which begins immediately 316 10 after replication of yeast centromeres in early S phase , and the Ndc10 - Bir1 interaction might facilitate 317 access to Dsn1 . Binding of Sli15 with COMA appears to provide a further anchor point , once the Ctf19 318 complex ( Ctf19c ) has assembled on the Cse4 nucleosome [ 54 , 55 ] . The interaction with the Ndc80c 319 head could in principle then localize the kinase domain close to its targets . About 600 Si15 residues 320 intervene between its attachments to Bir1 and Ipl1 ; these could readily stretch between CDEIII , to 321 which Ndc10 binds , and the head of Ndc80 , or to Dam1 after end - on attachment , but whether Ndc80c 322 head binding by the N - terminal extension of Ipl1 can occur concomitantly with the Sli15 - COMA 323 interaction will depend on the position , not yet determed , of the relevant residues on Sli15 . The 324 proximity of the Ipl1 kinase domain afforded by interaction between the Ndc80c head and the N - 325 terminal extension might be important for capturing target sites on the Ndc80 N - terminal extension 326 when some or all of those residues dissociate , in the absence of tension , from binding with a 327 microtubule . Likewise , when tension is absent after end - on attachment , the same tethering might 328 enhance phosphorylation of the motif close to the C - terminus of Dam1 . 329 330 The Ipl1 motif that binds Ndc80c is also the target of phosphorylation by Cdk1 , which preferentially 331 modifies serine or threonine at sites with the sequence ( S / T ) Px ( R / K ) [ 65 ] . The current models 332 ( crystallographic or AF2 predicted ) do not clearly suggest whether phosphorylation of the targeted 333 serines ( S50 and S76 ) would strengthen or weaken Ipl1 binding , as the serines lie between conserved 334 arginine and glutamic acid residues on Nuf2 . A Bim1 binding motif SxIP [ 66 ] immediately precedes 335 the SP ( V / I ) R Ndc80c - binding sequences in S . cerevisiae Ipl1 ( Fig . 4B ) , and phosphorylation of S50 336 and S76 appears to suppress Ipl1 association with Bim1 until activity of the Cdk1 kinase Cdc28 337 declines in anaphase [ 65 ] . Although the Bim1 - binding consensus is absent in many other point - 338 centromere yeast , the Cdk1 consensus is almost always present . 339 340 Human Aurora B also has a candidate Ndc80c binding motif ( TLPQR ) in the 70 - residue N - terminal 341 extension that precedes the kinase domain in the polypeptide chain . AF2 predicts with high 342 confidence an association very similar to the predicted Mps1 association , including interaction of 343 several residues C - terminal to the key arginine ( Fig . S4B ) . Thus , as with Mps1 , the Ndc80c head is 344 probably also an important communication hub in metazoans . 345 346 Detection of a segment in the Ipl1 N - terminal extension that interacts with the same site on the 347 Ndc80c head that binds Dam1 and Mps1 and observations that Ipl1 and Mps1 have partly overlapping 348 roles in error correction raise the question of when , in the interval from S - phase to late prometaphase , 349 does each of these kinases have its most important function and what are its critical targets . Ipl1 350 appears to be required for error correction throughout prometaphase , even after formation of two 351 distinct kinetochore clusters , which can still contain syntelic attachments [ 21 ] . Mps1 must likewise be 352 11 present , at least on any pair not under tension , to keep the SAC engaged . Future experiments will 353 need to determine the trade - off among Mps1 , Ipl1 , and Dam1 at the Ndc80c communication hub , the 354 respective phosphorylation targets when Mps1 or Ipl1 binds there , and the importance of mixed 355 states , with some of the Ndc80 complexes on any kinetochore bearing one of the kinases , some 356 bearing the other , and even some bound with Dam1 . 357 358 Methods 359 Protein purification 360 The constructs used to express Ndc80c dwarf and its variants are identical to those used previously [ 51 ] , 361 except for the exclusion of a non - native sequence N - terminal to Nuf2 that promoted crystallization in 362 the earlier study and the addition of Mps1 and Ipl1 N - terminal extensions as described below . The 363 purification scheme was identical for all variants , except for the final gel - filtration step , for which the 364 buffer composition varied depending on the subsequent application . Briefly , shortened versions of 365 Ndc80 / Nuf2 and Spc24 / Spc25 were cloned into the orthogonal expression vectors pETduet1 and 366 pRSFduet , respectively . Proteins were co - expressed in Bl21 ( DE3 ) E . coli ( New England Biolabs ) . 367 Cells were grown at 37°C in 2XYT media to an OD600 of 0 . 8 , induced with 500 µM IPTG , and 368 incubated overnight with shaking at 225 rpm at 18°C . Cell pellets from 6 L of culture were 369 resuspended in 100 mL of buffer containing 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole pH 370 8 . 0 , 2 mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) , 1 mM PMSF , 2 “Complete” protease inhibitor tablets 371 ( Roche ) , 25 µ g / mL lysozyme ( Gold Biochem ) and 5 µ g / mL DnaseI ( Gold Biochem ) . Cells were lysed 372 by sonication and the lysate clarified by centrifugation and applied to Ni - NTA agarose equilibrated 373 with 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM TCEP ( equilibration buffer ) . 374 Bound material was washed with equilibration buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and 500 mM NaCl 375 and then with equilibration buffer . Proteins were eluted with equilibration buffer containing 400 mM 376 imidazole pH 8 . 0 and 100 mM NaCl . Eluates were treated overnight with TEV protease to remove the 377 6 - His tag from the N - terminus of Ndc80 ( except for protein to be immobilized for pulldown 378 experiments ) and subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Hi - trap Q HP ( Cytiva ) , 379 followed by size - exclusion chromatography using a Hi - load Superdex 200 16 / 60 column ( Cytiva ) . For 380 protein crystallization the column was equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM NaCl , and 2 381 mM TCEP . For fluorescence polarization binding and pulldown experiments , the buffer was 10 mM 382 HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM TCEP . 383 384 The Mps1 fragments used for pulldown experiments were ordered from Genscript and cloned into 385 pGEX6P1 ( Novagen ) to express them as GST fusions . Cells were grown at 37°C in 2XYT media to 386 an OD600 of 0 . 8 , induced with 500 µM IPTG , and incubated overnight with shaking at 225 rpm at 387 12 18°C . Cell pellets from 2 L of culture were resuspended in 30 mL of buffer containing 100 mM Tris pH 388 8 . 0 , 250 mM NaCl , 2 mM TCEP , 1 mM PMSF , 25 µ g / mL lysozyme ( Gold Biochem ) , 5 µ g / mL DNaseI 389 ( Gold Biochem ) and a single “Complete” protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) . Cells were lysed by 390 sonication and the lysate clarified by centrifugation and applied to glutathione agarose ( 1 mL bed 391 volume ) ( Pierce ) . The resin was washed with 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 250 mM NaCl , and 2 mM TCEP 392 ( wash buffer ) . Protein was eluted from the resin by applying 6 mL of wash buffer supplemented with 393 20 mM reduced glutathione ( Sigma ) . 394 395 Pulldown Experiment s 396 For the pulldown experiments in Figure 1 , Ndc80c dwarf with a 6 - His affinity tag on the N - terminus of 397 Ndc80 was immobilized to saturation on Ni - NTA agarose by incubation with gentle agitation at 4°C . 398 Beads were pelleted by centrifugation , washed three times in 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 399 mM imidazole pH 7 . 2 , 2 mM TCEP . Next , the beads were incubated with the Mps1 - GST fusion eluted 400 from the glutathione agarose for 30 min . Beads were again pelleted , washed three times with wash 401 buffer , pelleted a final time , and the wash buffer aspirated from the tube . To elute bound proteins , 50 402 µL of wash buffer supplemented with 500 mM imidazole pH 7 . 2 was added to ~ 25 µL of beads . After 403 an additional spin , the eluted proteins were visualized by SDS - PAGE . 404 405 Peptide binding experiments 406 Mps1 ( 137 - 171 ) , Ipl1 ( 26 - 59 ) , and Dam1 ( 254 - 305 ) peptides with C - terminal cysteines , were 407 synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility . The Mps1 peptide was labelled with Bodipy FL 408 maleimide ( Thermo Fisher ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The labeled peptide was 409 separated from unreacted dye by cation exchange chromatography with Source 15S resin ( Cytiva ) . 410 Fluorescence polarization was measured at 25 ° C with an Envision plate reader ( Perkin Elmer ) 411 equipped with a filter set optimized for fluorescence polarization of FITC , which has the same 412 absorption and emission spectra as those of Bodipy FL . For direct binding experiments , an 860 µ M 413 solution of Ndc80c dwarf in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM TCEP was 414 subject to 2 - fold serial dilutions and subsequently supplemented with an equal volume of a buffer - 415 matched solution of 40 nM Bodipy - FL labelled Mps1 peptide . Fluorescence polarization was 416 measured in triplicate . For competition binding experiments , 2 mM solutions of each peptide , 417 dissolved in 20 mM tris pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM TCEP , was subject to serial 2 - fold dilutions . An 418 equal volume of a buffer - matched solution containing 40 nM Bodipy - FL and 1 µ M Ndc80c dwarf was 419 added to each of the dilutions , and fluorescence polarization was measured in triplicate . 420 421 Ndc80c dwarf - Mps1 fusion crystallization and structure determination 422 13 Ndc80c dwarf , with residues 124 - 176 of S . cerevisiae Mps1 appended to the N - terminus of Nuf2 , was 423 concentrated to 25 mg / mL in 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM TCEP . Crystals were grown 424 by vapor diffusion in hanging drop format in 24 - well plates ( Hampton Research ) . Crystals used for 425 diffraction data collection grew from drops in which 1 µ L of protein solution was mixed with 1 µ L of a 426 well solution containing 13 % polyethylene glycol 8000 , 1M sodium chloride , 100 mM PIPES pH 6 . 1 . 427 Crystals were harvested , soaked for 1 - 2 minutes in a well solution supplemented with 25 % glycerol , 428 and immersed immediately in liquid nitrogen . The complex crystallized in space group 429 C222 1 ( a = 72 . 52 Å , b = 168 . 45 Å , c = 229 . 57 Å ) . Data to a minimum Bragg spacing of 3 . 29 Å were 430 recorded on beamline 201 at the Advanced Light Source , indexed , integrated , using DIALS , as 431 implemented in xia2 [ 67 ] . The data were scaled and merged using the STARANISO server [ 68 ] . The 432 structure was determined by molecular replacement in Phenix [ 69 ] , using three non - overlapping 433 segments of Ndc80c dwarf ( PDB 5TCS ) as search models . The molecular - replacement maps showed 434 clear density for the Mps1 - derived peptide . Model building was carried out in Coot [ 70 ] and 435 refinement , in Phenix [ 69 ] . Data statistics are in Table S1 . 436 437 Dwarf Ipl1 fusion crystallization and structure determination 438 Ndc80c dwarf , with residues 45 - 59 of S . cerevisiae Ipl1 appended to the N - terminus of Nuf2 was 439 concentrated to 40 mg / mL in 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM sodium chloride , 2 mM TCEP . 440 Crystallization screens were set up in sitting drop format using a Mosquito liquid handling robot . The 441 400 nL drops contained equal volumes of protein and well solution . Crystals grew from drops 442 equilibrated with 15 % polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether , 500 mM sodium chloride , 50 mM 443 Tris pH 7 . 5 . Crystals were harvested directly from the screening drop , soaked for 1 - 2 minutes in a 444 well solution supplemented with 25 % glycerol , and immersed immediately in liquid nitrogen . The 445 complex crystallized in space group P4 3 2 1 2 ( a = 114 . 81 Å , b = 114 . 81 Å , c = 424 . 17 Å ) . Data were 446 recorded on beamline 201 at the Advanced Light Source and integrated with XDS [ 71 ] . Because of 447 substantial anisotropy in the diffraction , data were scaled and merged using the STARANISO server 448 [ 68 ] . The minimum Bragg spacing following anisotropic scaling was 3 . 93 Å in the " best " direction and 449 6 . 76 Å in the " worst " . We determined the structure by molecular replacement in Phenix [ 69 ] , using 450 three search models derived from Ndc80c dwarf ( PDB 5TCS ) . There were two complexes in the 451 asymmetric unit . The 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc molecular replacement maps had clear density for the 452 appended Ipl1 peptide in both non - crystallographic symmetry ( ncs ) related copies . The density also 453 showed that the peptide appended to one ncs copy of Ndc80c dwarf was bound to the ncs - related copy - 454 - i . e . , that the two ncs - related complexes are a " domain - swapped " pair ( Fig . S2 ) . We used O [ 72 ] to fit 455 a peptide comprising residues 48 - 56 of Ipl1 into the Fo - Fc density , truncated to 6 Å in all directions , 456 14 using the AF2 model as a starting point . Refinement was carried out in Phenix [ 69 ] . Statistics are in 457 Table S1 . 458 459 Data availability 460 Coordinates and structure factors for the two structures reported here have been deposited in the 461 Protein Databank with accession numbers 8V10 and 8V11 . 462 463 Acknowledgments 464 We are grateful to Matthew Miller and Emily Parnell for careful reading and commenting on the 465 manuscript , and to Stefan Westermann , Richard Pleuger , Matthew Miller , Emily Parnell and Erin 466 Jensen for discussions and for communicating results before submission of their papers .
