Tamoxifen Therapy in a Murine Model of Myotubular Myopathy by Nika Maani A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Department of Molecular Genetics University of Toronto © Copyright by Nika Maani 2018 ii Tamoxifen Therapy in a Murine Model of Myotubular Myopathy Nika Maani Department of Molecular Genetics University of Toronto 2018 Abstract X - linked myotubular myopathy ( XLMTM ) , also known as myotubular myopathy ( MTM ) , is a fatal pediatric congenital myopathy caused by loss - of - function mutations in MTM1 that is without existing therapy . MTM1 is a phosphoinositide 3 - phosphatase that antagonizes class II and III phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) to modulate levels of endosome - specific phosphoinositides . MTM1 regulates endosomal trafficking , and proper formation of the skeletal muscle triad . Using a murine model of MTM , our lab has identified tamoxifen as a novel therapeutic candidate . Using several in vitro and in vivo studies and RNA sequencing , I demonstrate the aforementioned effects of tamoxifen to be mediated primarily through estrogen receptor signaling , and the post - transcriptional regulation of dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) , a known MTM1 modifier . The preclinical evidence presented herein identifies and uncovers the FDA approved drug tamoxifen as the first small molecule therapeutic with pre - clinical efficiency and clinical translatability for use in MTM patients . iii Dedication To my loving parents and dedicated husband For this journey would never have come to fruition without you .

linked Myotubular Myopathy and Other Congenital Myopathies Congenital myopathies encompass a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of neuromuscular conditions characterized by distinctive structural and functional abnormalities in skeletal muscle 1 , 2 . Despite sharing a number of common clinical features such as : childhood - onset hypotonia , progressive muscular weakness and atrophy 3 , the conditions grouped under this diagnostic umbrella have been further subdivided into morphologically distinct groups . Centronuclear myopathies ( CNMs ) encompass a group of rare , and genetically diverse congenital myopathies that have been aptly named by way of their presentation of skeletal myofibers with significantly prevalent centralized nuclei on muscle biopsy 2 , 3 . Since their first description in 1966 by Spiro et al . , CNMs have been further classified into three subgroups ( X - linked , autosomal dominant , and autosomal recessive ) as a consequence of distinct genetic and clinical features that underlie their spectrum of clinical severity that ranges from neonatal lethal to adolescent / adult onset and slowly progressive . Most importantly , all CNMs are associated with severe and lifelong disabilities and are uniformly without therapies at present 1 – 3 . To date , mutations in six different genes have been associated with CNMs ; with mutations in myotubularin ( MTM1 ) , being the most commonly occurring and extensively studied 4 – 7 . The other four classical CNM genes include dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) 8 – 10 , amphyphysin 2 ( BIN1 ) 11 – 13 , ryanodine receptor 1 ( RYR1 ) , titin ( TTN ) and SPEG 1 , 14 . Whilst being less common than MTM1 , mutations in the latter genes have been associated with the rarer and oftentimes milder autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disease , respectively 1 – 3 . To date , functional abnormalities in MTM1 , DNM2 and BIN1 have been repeatedly implicated in CNM pathology and have been hypothesized to play important molecular roles at the transverse ( T ) tubule : a muscular substructure specialized for calcium handling 8 , 9 , 12 , 15 – 17 . Moreover , these genes all possess functions in membrane remodelling , endocytosis and vesicular trafficking 9 , 17 – 19 . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical and pathological similarities between MTM1 , DNM2 and BIN1 - related CNMs to those caused by mutations in RYR1 and TTN are unclear 19 . Caused by in utero loss of function mutations in MTM1 , X - linked MTM ( XLMTM ) ( commonly known as myotubular myopathy ( MTM ) ) , has an estimated prevalence of 1 - 9 in 100 , 000 male births , and is 2 also the most severe form of CNM 3 , 4 , 6 . Patients often present with profound muscular weakness or hypotonia at birth , accompanied by the acquisition of progressive and severe disabilities ( including wheelchair and ventilator dependence ) . Opthalmoparesis , cryptorchidism and the elongation of facial features are additional distinguishing abnormalities 2 , 20 . Although the majority of patients do not survive past infancy as a consequence of respiratory failure , those surviving into late childhood or early adolescence , often require invasive ambulatory , respiratory and gastrointestinal support . Of those surviving few , many will die before reaching adulthood 14 . Patients affected with autosomal dominant ( ADCNM ) and autosomal recessive ( ARCNM ) forms of CNM also present with moderate to severe muscle weakness and delayed motor milestones along with facial and / or ocular abnormalities 2 , 19 . Oftentimes male patients affected with either X - linked or autosomal forms of the disease may be indistinguishable by clinical observation and muscle biopsy alone and require confirmatory gene testing to reach a conclusive diagnosis 2 . Moreover , by virtue of such diagnostic advances in whole - genome , - exome and RNA sequencing technologies , additional neonatal and more severe forms of ADCNM have been identified as a result of their association with de novo DNM2 mutations 2 , 10 , 21 . Occasionally however , autosomal CNMs can be distinguished from MTM by virtue of their additional incidence in females , most - often later period of onset , and supplementary clinical manifestations such as ptosis , scoliosis and limb - girdle patterns of muscle weakness 2 , 19 , 21 . Both autosomal and X - linked forms of CNM present with similar features on muscle biopsy ; the hallmark identifier being the presence of centralized nuclei in over 25 % of muscle fibers . Furthermore , the majority of affected fibers are significantly smaller , rounder and resemble an immature muscular phenotype 2 , 14 , 19 . The predominance of hypotrophic type 1 muscle fibers however , is a histological feature of MTM , whilst the appearance of radial sarcoplasmic strands observed by oxidative enzyme staining represent a histopathological feature of ADCNM 2 . Despite oftentimes complicating genotype - phenotype correlations amongst CNMs , the extensive clinical and histological overlap does raise the interesting question of pathological interrelatedness . At present , the specific reason ( s ) as to why mutations in different genes result in similar muscle - specific abnormalities remains to be clearly defined . Furthermore , whether the gene - products of MTM1 , DNM2 and BIN1 all function within a single pathway or co - localize within a specific muscular region to exert their interdependent molecular function ( s ) remains an open and extensively investigated question . 3 Figure 1 . Speculated molecular and functional links between BIN1 , MTM1 and DNM2 in skeletal muscle . T - tubules are muscle - specific organelles that are critical for calcium signalling and excitation - contraction coupling . They also link the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the cytoplasm ( sarcoplasm ) of skeletal muscle at the triad by way of molecular interactions between dihydropyridine receptors ( DHPR ) and ryanodine receptors ( RYR1 ) . MTM1 ( red circles ) functions to regulate vesicular trafficking , ensuring the proper transport of muscle - specific proteins . BIN1 is involved in membrane remodelling and membrane tubulation , in concert with Caveolin - 3 ( Cav3 ) / Caveloae at invaginating regions of the plasma membrane . DNM2 is speculated to function in parallel to BIN1 as a regulator of membrane fission , to modulate T - tubule formation and maintenance , however the exact molecular function and / or role of DNM2 at the T - tubule is poorly understood . To exert its specialized function , skeletal muscle requires specialized structures known as the triad and neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) 22 . Both the triad and NMJ function as key regulators of EC coupling , the process whereby nerve signals are translated into contractile force via the intracellular release of Ca 2 + . 22 Briefly , following motor neuron - induced excitation at the NMJ , a wave of depolarization is propagated along the cellular membrane and through a specialized sarcolemmal invagination known as the Transverse ( T ) - tubule . Surrounded on each end by terminal ends of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) , this T - tubule - SR complex is known as the triad and is responsible for translating membrane depolarization into muscle contraction by promoting the mechanical release of Ca 2 + into the cell 19 , 22 . Intriguingly , MTM1 , DNM2 and BIN1 have all been directly or indirectly implicated in the formation and / or maintenance of the triad 8 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 22 ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , one pathologic mechanism that unifies autosomal and X - linked forms of CNM is in fact the disruption of myofiber architecture and specifically , structural disorganization of the triad and NMJ 2 , 14 . Undoubtedly , structural changes of the triad hold significant functional 4 relevance in MTM muscle and have been shown to underlie the clinical manifestations of muscle weakness and impaired muscle contraction seen in patients 2 , 14 , 19 . It is therefore possible that muscle - specific abnormalities arise in CNMs by virtue of the dysfunctional interplay of these genes at the triad . Despite the strong pathological and clinical classifications discussed above , the long - term prognosis of MTM remains very poor , with a disease burden that is potentiated by the lack of an effective therapy or cure . By virtue of its high rate of infantile mortality , MTM is regarded as the most severe and devastating form of CNM 2 , 14 , 19 . Predicting the clinical outcomes of MTM patients is especially difficult without a comprehensive understanding of the natural history of the disease and the discovery of well - defined prognostic indicators . In light of this , a prospective , non - interventional clinical assessment study ( INCEPTUS ; NCT02704273 ) is currently underway to characterize the disease course , identify therapeutic windows and establish outcome measures that can be used to assess the effectiveness of novel therapies . In a similar vein , three natural history studies 20 , 23 , 24 have been conducted in the past and provided some insight into actionable and / or measurable disease outcomes in MTM . Earlier studies from 1999 23 and 2002 24 showed significantly high rates of mortality in MTM patients and ascertained that survival beyond one year of life is often a reflection of the extensive provision of medical and respiratory support that is necessary to fight against severe non - muscle morbidities 23 , 24 . Furthermore , one group determined that gene mutation analyses in MTM are unreliable for generating genotype - phenotype correlations 24 . In the most recent study however , Amburgey et al . , showed an increase in patient survival to an average of 6 years and 10 months ( 83 % of patients died before age 9 ) , despite similar disease severities and morbidities as those observed in previous studies 20 . Amburgey and colleagues identified respiratory status as the most promising disease outcome measure , given that use of motor scales , frequency of hospital visits and overall survival was found to be limited as a prognostic indicator 20 . Despite these advances however , no proven therapy or disease modifying therapy exists . In light of its devastating severity , many groups have set the stage for a novel therapeutic era by exploring whether the phenotypic overlaps amongst CNMs are a consequence of a unifying genetic pathomechanism . Indeed , DNM2 has recently been identified as a novel genetic modifier of MTM1 25 , 26 , and therefore not only sets the precedent for a novel therapeutic approach , but also helps to further our understanding of MTM pathology . Consequently , the information presented hereafter will focus preferentially on the structure , function and molecular interrelation of MTM1 and DNM2 within the context of MTM . 5 2 Function , Structure , and Localization of MTM1 and DNM2 MTM1 protein , also known as myotubularin , is a lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates specialized membrane lipids known as phosphoinositides ( PIPs ) at the 3’ position . Specifically , MTM1 antagonizes the action of PIK3C2B , a phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) kinase , to convert PI3P to PIP and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) to PI5P 7 ( Figure 2 ) . PIPs are lipid second messengers that are important mediators of cellular signalling and membrane transport . Phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphates ( PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) are enriched at plasma membranes , secretory organelles and lysosomes , whilst PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 function as regulators of membrane trafficking , intracellular sorting and organelle maturation at the endosome 7 , 27 , 28 . In this way , MTM1 functions to regulate the proper sorting and recycling of endosomal proteins by maintaining balanced levels of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated PIPs on membranes of the endolysosomal system 28 . The significance of this regulation is highlighted by the fact that mutations in many PIP - modifying enzymes , including MTM1 , have been implicated in several neuromuscular and multi - factorial diseases 19 . Interestingly however , MTM1 has yet to be detected at the nucleus or triad . A study conducted in C2C12 mytoubes and myoblasts found MTM1 to be localized preferentially at the cytoplasm and plasma membrane 29 , whereas two studies in MTM fibroblasts and skeletal muscle , found MTM1 at sorting and recycling endosomes 27 as well as regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum 18 , respectively . Not surprisingly , an important question in the field remains : how does the in vitro function of MTM1 as a regulator of endosomal dynamics and PIP metabolism associate with muscle - specific and in vivo pathologies of triad dysregulation and nuclear centralization ? There is a growing hypothesis that defects in the exit of protein cargoes from endosomes may underlie the accumulation or sequestering of proteins required for muscular maintenance and overall function . In support of this , Ketel et al demonstrated that MTM patient fibroblasts harbour abnormalities in the endosomal recycling of b 1 - integrin and transferrin receptor ( TfR ) 27 . Furthermore , in a more recent study , they identified PI4K2 a and Sec6 as interactors of MTM1 by immunoprecipitation 27 . PI4K2 a is a phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase that phosphorylates PIP to PI ( 4 ) P 30 , and Sec6 is a component of the exocyst complex that enables fusion of exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane 31 . Briefly , MTM1 and PI4K2 a were shown to initiate the conversion of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 4 ) P at the recycling endosome to assign the correct membrane identity required for its proper fusion with the plasma membrane 27 . Whether MTM functions in a similar manner to promote the exocytic regulation of muscle - specific proteins from 6 endosomal compartments to their correct subcellular locations however , remains to be determined . Moreover , whether the accumulation of exocytosis - deficient endosomes is a primary driver of the muscle - specific pathologies observed in patient and murine models of MTM requires further investigation . Figure 3 . MTM1 is a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) , antagonizing the function of class II and class III phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3K ) . MTM1 is involved in regulating endolysosomal trafficking , membrane remodeling , and autophagy . MTM1 is a member of a family of 14 highly conserved active and dead phosphatases . A notable characteristic of the myotubularin family is homo - and hetero - dimerization of active phosphatases with their catalytically inactive homologs ( i . e . MTM1 / MTMR12 ) , through the PH - GRAM and CC protein domains , to promote the localization , stability and allosteric activation of MTMs at PIP - enriched membranes 7 . Lastly , PTP ( catalytic ) and Rac - 1 induced localization ( RID ) domains are both subject to pathogenic mutations in MTM patients 7 , 19 . Interestingly , each domain is responsible for promoting phosphatase activity , or targeting MTM1 to specific membrane regions , respectively 7 . It is therefore likely that further investigation into the biological consequences of specific mutations in these domains will shed insight into how dysregulation of the endocytic machinery may promote development of muscle - specific pathologies . In a similar vein , DNM2 is one of three members of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases that shape and remodel membranes throughout diverse cellular processes . Unlike DNM1 which is mainly expressed in the brain , and DNM3 in the brain and testes , DNM2 is expressed and functions more ubiquitously 10 , 19 . The most extensively studied function of DNM2 however , is its role as a key regulator of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) 8 . In C2C12 cells and fibroblasts , DNM2 is localized to the cytoplasm and clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane 8 . CME is the principal mechanism by which cells internalize protein cargo ( i . e . transferrin , growth factors , etc . ) that are bound to specific membrane receptors , and therefore integral to proper synaptic vesicle recycling 32 , cell signaling and growth 33 . CME is a multi - step process mediated by a modular and transient 7 complex of over fifty different endocytic proteins recruited to plasma membrane regions enriched for specific PIPs ( i . e . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) 11 , 17 . The discovery of PIP binding domains within certain endocytic proteins suggests that PIP regulation may play an important role in the assembly and targeting of endocytic protein complexes . The PH domain of DNM2 is speculated to bind directly to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , mediating its recruitment to endocytic membranes in preparation for membrane scission 34 . Briefly , cytosolic tetramers of DNM2 have been shown to oligomerize at the neck of clathrin - coated vesicles following recruitment to PIP - rich membrane regions 34 . Subsequent constriction and scission of the plasma membrane however , is speculated to be driven by mechanical forces transmitted throughout the protein following GTP hydrolysis 33 , 34 . Consequently , the GTP hydrolysis - dependent membrane remodeling activity of DNM2 is understood to depend on proper oligomerization 34 . DNM2 is composed of five domains : an N - terminal GTPase domain , the stalk and bundle signalling element ( BSE ) domains regulating dynamin self - assembly , a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain responsible for binding membrane - bound lipids ( i . e . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ) , and a C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) that mediates interactions with - BAR and - SH3 domain - containing scaffolding proteins 12 , 34 . Despite extensive studies investigating the molecular architecture of DNM2 , most have failed to clarify the exact mechanical mechanism ( s ) that govern dynamin assembly , function and regulation . Recently however , a biochemical study of the crystal structure of DNM2 by Reubold et al suggests that DNM2 oligomerization occurs following release of an intramolecular auto inhibitory mechanism 34 . Intriguingly , this group hypothesized that mutations in domains involved in oligomerization and auto inhibition ( i . e . PH and BSE domains ) may have direct implications for DNM2 function in membrane constriction and scission . Not surprisingly , they speculate that defects in this mechanism contribute to the development of CNM pathophysiology 34 . A growing body of evidence suggests that DNM2 may also play a role in membrane tubulation by virtue of its speculated interaction with BIN1 , another CNM gene and endocytic protein localized to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2— enriched membranes 11 – 13 . In light of its well - established role as a sensor and inducer of membrane curvature , recent studies suggest that BIN1 mediates T - tubule biogenesis and is capable of recruiting DNM2 to endocytic sites via its C - terminal SH3 domain 11 , 17 . Indeed , in the absence of MTM1 , BIN1 is no longer found at the t - tubule ; suggesting that defective membrane tubulation may underlie the structural disorganization of the triad in myopathic muscle 25 . Although DNM2 partially co - localizes with BIN1 labelled tubular structures in C2C12 myotubes , and caveolin - 3 labelled t - tubule - adjacent structures 8 , whether DNM2 and BIN1 directly interact is not clear ; nor is it completely understood whether either protein functions to regulate the other within skeletal muscle . This is in contrast to MTM1 , which co - localizes with 8 BIN1 at the T - tubule and when bound , enhances BIN1 - mediated membrane tubulation in vitro 35 . Whether the involvement of MTM1 and / or speculated role for DNM2 in T - tubule formation contributes towards triad dysregulation in murine models of CNM however , merits further investigation . Further evidence has implicated DNM2 in actin - dependent trafficking , cytoskeletal assembly and centrosome cohesion , all of which are of potential relevance to mechanisms underlying abnormal nuclear positioning in CNM 36 , 37 . This is supported by a recent case study in which the subcellular localization of DNM2 was disrupted in an ADCNM patient with a novel mutation in the C - terminal region of the PH domain 15 . In skeletal muscle biopsies , DNM2 localized at the surface of centralized nuclei as puncta aggregates ; this was in contrast to control biopsies in which DNM2 localized to the periphery of muscle fibers . Not surprisingly , this was accompanied by profound changes in muscle fiber morphology 15 . Taken together , this data supports the idea that MTM1 and DNM2 play important roles in intracellular trafficking and membrane remodelling . In this way , they both function to promote protein sorting into correct intracellular compartments . However , the relationship between the molecular functions of MTM1 and DNM2 with that of the structural and functional abnormalities in myopathic muscle is unknown . 3 Genetic Landscape of MTM1 and DNM2 MTM1 is located on the X chromosome ( Xq28 . 1 ) and is as such , causative of an X - linked recessive disorder , with a penetrance of 100 % in all males that carry a pathogenic variant 6 , 14 , 19 . Upwards of 300 MTM1 mutations have been reported in the literature , with 529 variants submitted to the Leiden Open - source Variation Database ( LOVD ) 38 . Mutations are distributed indiscriminately along the entire gene , with no preferential clustering to loci encoding known functional domains . Furthermore , the majority of mutations have been found to be exonic , with a minor subset found within introns and intron - exon boundaries 6 , 19 . Consequently , functional relevance and clear genotype - phenotype correlations for MTM1 mutations have yet to be established . Unsurprisingly however , most truncating mutations ( deletions or nonsense ) and missense mutations of the PTP domain have been associated with more severe phenotypes , whilst non - truncating mutations and those outside the PTP domain have been identified in less affected individuals 6 , 19 , 20 , 24 . DNM2 maps to chromosome 19 ( 19p13 . 2 - p12 ) and contains 22 exons . Mutations in DNM2 are heterozygous and dominant ; pathogenic mutations are often missense or in - frame indels , with the 9 majority clustering to the PH domain and interface of PH and stalk domains 2 , 19 . At present , 60 variants have been reported in the LOVD , six of which ( R465W , S619L , A618T , E386K , V625 and R369W ) have been extensively studied and characterized 38 . The recurrent p . R465W mutation is the most common , and accounts for approximately 25 % of affected families , whereas the p . E368K , p . R369W mutations along with those in residues 618 and 619 are found in approximately 20 % , 10 % and 15 % of families , respectively 19 . ADCNM affects both males and females with an overall decreased disease severity than that of MTM . Despite this however , more severe and neonatal onset forms of ADCNM have been associated with heterozygous de novo mutations within the PH domain 2 , 14 , 19 . Intriguingly , Reubold et al . , have recently proposed a novel structural mechanism of DNM2 assembly and regulation through which the effects of disease - related mutations may be explained . They propose an intramolecular mechanism of auto - inhibition in which the PH domain remains bound to the stalk to prevent unnecessary oligomerization . Following the recruitment of DNM2 dimers to pre - endocytic sites by accessory and scaffolding proteins , this inhibitory molecular “switch” is turned “off” by virtue of PH domain binding to membrane - specific PIPs ( i . e . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ; thus , modulating the stepwise assembly of tetrameric helices around invaginating membranes 34 . Interestingly , when expressed in mammalian cells , DNM2 lacking the PH domain preferentially forms cytosolic aggregates , and fails to localize to clathrin - coated membranes and modulate transferrin uptake 34 . Reubold and colleagues propose that CNM - causing mutations within , or at the interface of the PH and stalk domain interfere with the modulation of this auto - inhibitory mechanism , and downstream GTPase activity of DNM2 . By virtue of its location it is speculated that the R465W mutation disrupts the intramolecular interactions required for DNM2 assembly and regulation , and thus promotes excessive DNM2 oligomerization 834 . Furthermore , the fact that Liu et al speculate ADCNM - associated mutations in Dnm2 to be “gain - of - function” or hypermorphic , further supports the prevalent hypothesis that DNM2 over activity is a primary pathological mechanism in ADCNM . Although not immediately obvious , these findings provide important insight into pathomechanisms of MTM , a concept which will be further elaborated in subsequent sections . 4 Known Pathogenic Mechanisms in XLMTM and ADNCM As a consequence of the extensive work carried out in well - established mammalian models of MTM , several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain why several structural and physiologic abnormalities of the disease may arise . At present , three murine models that faithfully recapitulate the pathology of the human disease have been developed 39 – 41 . Although triad and NMJ 10 dysfunction represent structural abnormalities of the disease , the molecular reason ( s ) for which they arise is unclear 14 . Notably , all three murine models share hallmark pathological features of accumulated PI ( 3 ) P , abundant centralized nuclei , decreased fiber size , predominance of type I fibers , and structural dysregulation of the triad 39 – 41 . Not surprisingly , all three models exhibit severely reduced muscle strength , with two of the three recapitulating more severe and mild forms of MTM 39 , 40 . Notwithstanding their pathogenic similarities , the use of each model has provided important insights into different pathomechanisms that may underlie the hallmark structural and molecular abnormalities of the disease . The first and most extensively studied murine model was described and developed in 2002 by Buj - Bello et al . and is commonly referred to as the 129pas strain . Buj - Bello and colleagues used Cre - Lox mediated homologous recombination to knock - out exon 4 in Mtm1 , generating a truncating mutation that caused the complete loss of MTM1 39 . Not surprisingly Mtm1 KO mice have greatly reduced lifespan ( median survival = 35 days ) compared to wild - type littermates , and faithfully represent severe disease phenotypes . In addition to its extensive characterization in the literature , the Mtm1 KO ( MTM ) mouse model was most notably used by our lab and Cowling et al and has provided important insights into two attractive pathogenic mechanisms of the disease 25 , 26 , 42 . By virtue of myotubularin’s role as a PI ( 3 ) P phosphatase , it is possible that many structural abnormalities in the muscle arise as a consequence of PI ( 3 ) P accumulation following the loss of MTM1 1 , 4 . In support of this , our lab showed that genetic depletion of Pik3c2b in Mtm1 KO mice was sufficient to reduce PI ( 3 ) P levels , and rescue the lethality of the Mtm1 KO mouse model . Importantly , our findings introduced Pik3c2b as one of the first genetic modifiers of MTM and demonstrated that PIK3C2B inhibition represents a novel and excellent therapeutic strategy for the disease 42 . Moreover , the therapeutic benefit of reducing PI ( 3 ) P levels in the Mtm1 KO mouse demonstrates that nuances in PIP metabolism may contribute towards development of hallmark muscular pathologies in MTM . This hypothesis is in line with findings from Amoasii and colleagues , where both PI ( 3 ) P and MTM1 were localized to sarcoplasmic cisternae in skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice 18 . Moreover , when the phosphatase activity of MTM1 was altered in skeletal muscle , they observed abnormal remodeling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum 18 , 43 . Coupled with the understanding that MTM1 binds to , and acts in conjunction with BIN1 to promote membrane tubulation in vivo 16 , it is possible that MTM1 activity and the consequent regulation of PI ( 3 ) P plays a key role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum at the triad . Although triad abnormalities are among the first changes identified in MTM and likely 11 explain the profound weakness seen in MTM patients 2 , 14 , the association between MTM1 , alerted PIP metabolism and triad dysfunction has yet to be translated into corresponding therapies for MTM patients and requires further investigation . Clarifying the pathogenic consequences of PI ( 3 ) P accumulation in MTM will shed insight into MTM pathogenesis and the etiology of muscle - specific abnormalities ( i . e triad dysregulation and nuclear centralization ) . This knowledge can then be applied towards understanding the pathology of other neuromuscular diseases and CNMs that arise as a consequence of altered PIP metabolism . Another discovery of relevance to MTM pathogenesis comes from Cowling et al . who recently identified Dnm2 as another novel genetic modifier of Mtm1 25 , 26 . Using the Mtm1 KO mouse model , Cowling and colleagues demonstrated that DNM2 protein expression was significantly elevated in human MTM fibroblasts and skeletal muscle of the Mtm1 KO mouse . Taking advantage of the fact that heterozygous Dnm2 - / + mice are phenotypically normal , Cowling and colleagues reduced DNM2 protein levels by approximately half in Mtm1 KO mice by generating Mtm1 KO mice that were heterozygous for Dnm2 ( Dnm2 - / + Mtm1 - / - ) . Remarkably , Dnm2 reduction was sufficient to rescue the survival , muscle function and triad structure of Mtm1 KO mice 9 , 25 , 26 . Following this discovery , Tasfaout et al successfully downregulated DNM2 in Mtm1 KO mice using anti - sense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) and intramuscular injection of AAV - shRNA against Dnm2 44 , 45 ( short hairpin RNA sequences against DNM2 mRNA ) ; both methods successfully rescued MTM pathology and represent clinically relevant strategies of DNM2 reduction . In wild - type murine muscle , overexpression of CNM - associated Dnm2 mutations ( i . e . R465W ) has been shown to induce nuclear centralization , muscular atrophy and triad dysregulation . Similarly , similar pathologic features are observed when wild - type Dnm2 is overexpressed in cellular and murine models 8 , 9 . These models along with established murine models of ADCNM recapitulate the pathological abnormalities often observed in ADCNM patients , and elegantly demonstrate that DNM2 overexpression is an independent inducer of pathogenicity . This is consistent with the hypothesis that DNM2 hyperactivity is a likely pathogenic mechanism in both diseases and suggests that the mechanism ( s ) underlying DNM2 dysregulation in ADCNM and MTM are similar 8 . It is therefore possible that DNM2 overexpression drives the development of muscular abnormalities observed in both diseases . Given that DNM2 has been implicated in CME , the regulation of actin and cytoskeletal dynamics , and indirectly associated with the biogenesis of the T - tubule , it is unclear as to which function of DNM2 contributes to MTM pathogenesis . This is further evidenced by the lack of any interaction between MTM1 and DNM2 , to date . What is clear 12 from these findings however , is that DNM2 and MTM1 function together in a common , but incompletely understood pathway to maintain specialized structures in skeletal muscle . This is evident given the significant phenotypic overlap amongst all CNMs 2 . Most importantly however , this indicates that muscle pathology in MTM is reversible and likely amenable to therapeutic intervention . In like manner to PIK3C2B , DNM2 downregulation holds immense promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for MTM and potentially , all CNMs . In 2011 Pierson et al . generated a murine model of the human c . 205C > T point mutation ( p . R69C ) in exon 4 of Mtm1 that has been consistently associated with milder forms of MTM 40 . Given the short lifespan of Mtm1 KO mice , the existence of a milder model with a greater median survival would be of benefit to the study of preclinical therapies , and the discovery of diagnostic windows . Knock - in ( KI ) of the p . R69C missense mutation induced exon 4 skipping and the subsequent generation of an out - of - frame transcript and premature stop codon in Mtm1 . Notwithstanding the complete loss of MTM1 in this model , Pierson and colleagues attributed the milder phenotypes and increased lifespan ( median survival = 66 weeks ) of this model to the presence of several full - length alternatively spliced forms of MTM1 in murine quadriceps 40 . This KI model has been used in conjunction with the Mtm1 KO model described above to demonstrate that loss of Mtm1 is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the NMJ 39 , 40 . Lastly , in 2013 Fetalvero et al generated the third Mtm1 KO model using a gene trapped Mtm1 allele 41 . Using this model , Fetalvero and colleagues speculated that loss of Mtm1 is associated with impaired skeletal muscle autophagy , as evidenced by the presence of cellular abnormalities such as ubiquitin aggregates , abnormal mitochondria and mTORC hyperactivation 41 . Interestingly , Al - Qusairi et al found these aforementioned mechanisms to be impaired in the 129pas strain ( Mtm1 KO ) 46 . Interestingly , these findings are inconsistent with elevated PI ( 3 ) P levels , which should over activate and / or promote excessive autophagy . Both Fetalvero et al and Al - Qusairi et al speculate that loss of Mtm1 leads to an imbalance between mTOR and autophagy and therefore , prevents the proper execution of autophagy and formation of autophagolysosomes 41 , 46 . Anecdotally , our lab has been unable to identify any aberrant autophagic mechanisms in the Mtm1 KO mouse model . Not surprisingly , the in vivo study of autophagy is often complicated by the fact the pathway is inherently complex and can be activated and / or inactivated as a consequence of a myriad of intracellular and / or extracellular conditions . For this reason , further investigation and 13 increased scientific rigor is required to determine whether autophagic mechanisms are contributing to , or responsible for MTM pathogenesis 47 , 48 . 5 Therapeutic Landscape of XLMTM At present , no clinically effective genetic and / or pharmacological therapies exist for MTM patients . Nevertheless , the current approach to care and management relies heavily on a series of multidisciplinary interventions aimed at improving survival and overall quality of life 20 . Most novel therapeutic strategies undertaken to date have focused exclusively on the muscular re - introduction of MTM1 by way of viral delivery or direct enzyme replacement therapy in MTM murine models 49 , 50 . Pioneering of gene and enzyme replacement therapies is at present , an active avenue of therapeutic development in MTM 20 . Recently , Childers et al . successfully delivered a working copy of Mtm1 into both canine and murine models of MTM single injection of a muscle trophic AAV8 vector 49 . In like manner , Lawlor et al . achieved short - term replacement of MTM in murine models by intramuscular injection of a recombinant 3E10Fv - MTM1 protein replacement agent . After two weeks of treatment this approach results in significant structural and functional improvements in myopathic muscle 50 . Indeed , both groups have demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted gene and enzyme replacement therapy in long - term improvements of MTM pathology ; specifically , in muscle strength and survival 49 , 50 . Nevertheless , the high cost of development and administration that is associated with these novel yet promising approaches , coupled with the present lack of clinical validation are reasons for which a strong rationale for identifying novel therapeutic drugs persists . In light of this , our lab has recently undertaken various innovative approaches to identify drug - targetable pathways in MTM . Given that PI3P accumulation is a hallmark pathology of MTM skeletal muscle , we hypothesized that genetic ablation of Pik3c2b , the PI3P generating muscle - specific class II PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) , would reduce the expression of PI3P and consequently , improve the pathology of the disease 42 . We accomplished this by ablating Pik3c2b in Mtm1 KO mice , using both muscle - specific ( Ckmm - Cre ) , and tamoxifen - inducible Cre transgenic lines . The success of this study lead to our discovery of Pik3c2b as a novel genetic modifier of Mtm1 , given that Pik3c2b - / - Mtm1 - / y double knock - out mice displayed a complete phenotypic rescue and were remarkably indistinguishable from their wildtype littermates 42 . The landmark success of this study set the stage for PI3K kinase inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for MTM and other diseases of PIP metabolism . Despite being the first study to provide promising preclinical evidence for PIK3C2B inhibition as a novel therapy 14 for MTM , no class II PI3K inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical validation . Therefore , our lab has pioneered several screens in silico and in vitro , as well as in zebrafish to further evaluate the efficacy of available FDA - approved drugs and inhibitors specific to PIK3C2B to validate this treatment strategy for clinical translation . In a similar vein , following the identification of Dnm2 as another genetic modifier of Mtm1 25 , 26 , two groups have successfully reduced DNM2 using clinically relevant strategies 44 . Similarly , Trochet et al . successfully reduced DNM2 protein and mRNA levels in murine and patient fibroblast models of ADCNM using allele - specific silencing RNA ( siRNA ) against the ADCNM - associated p . R465W mutation . This reduction was sufficient to achieve functional restoration in both models of ADCNM 51 . These studies suggest that targeting DNM2 is an alternative and potentially complementary therapeutic approach for MTM , and when taken in conjunction with the therapeutic strategies mentioned above , support the existence of multiple disease mechanisms in MTM that are amenable to therapeutic intervention . Another approach involves the re - purposing of drugs that are currently in use for the treatment of other conditions . Our lab has also undertaken this approach to identify novel therapies for MTM that have established clinical translatability . Pyridostigmine is an FDA - approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is often used to treat congenital myasthenic syndrome 52 . By virtue of similar clinical features between CNM patients and those affected with congenital myasthenia , one case study aimed to identify whether fatigability and abnormalities in neuromuscular transmission in patients with CNM are responsive to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy 52 . Of the four children examined in this study , only one was genetically diagnosed with MTM and harboured a missense mutation ( c . 695A > G ( p . His232Arg ) ) in exon 9 of MTM1 . Not surprisingly , this patient was affected with limited motor ability in childhood and became wheelchair dependent by early adolescence . With pyridostigmine , the patient regained the ability to stand and swim for uninterrupted and longer distances 52 . Further validation of pyridostigmine in preclinical models was subsequently provided by our lab , using NMJ function and muscular endurance as therapeutic outcome measures . Remarkably , both Mtm1 KO and Mtm1 KI mice displayed significant improvements in grip strength and reduction in fatigability , as evidenced by improved performance on the treadmill test following treatment with pyridostigmine 22 . These findings correspond nicely with similar motor improvements in a morpholino knock - down zebrafish model of MTM , which was also responsive to a - bungarotoxin , another 15 acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 22 . Although these preclinical and clinical studies were the first to identify a clinically established drug that may benefit MTM patients , pyridostigmine has since showed only modest therapeutic benefit . Of most notable importance towards the premise of my graduate work is our lab’s most recent discovery of tamoxifen ( TAM ) as a potent mitigator of the hallmark pathologies of MTM . Briefly , our findings unearth the first small molecule modifier of MTM that already possesses an excellent clinical profile . Because TAM has already been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive ( ER + ) breast cancer 53 , it is inexpensive and can be translated more rapidly into the clinical arena . When compared to other novel therapeutic strategies , namely ASO - mediated DNM2 knockdown and PIK3C2B inhibition , TAM is much less expensive to administer and does not require extensive preclinical validation and refinement for safe use in humans . Re - purposed drugs often do not face the significant hurdles encountered by other novel therapeutic strategies before they can reach the patient population . Moreover , because TAM has a good safety profile and is well - tolerated as a common adjuvant chemotherapeutic 54 , should clinical trials confirm its effectiveness in MTM patients , it is possible that it could be used in conjunction with various gene or enzyme replacement therapies to potentiate their effects . Furthermore , it is possible that a novel drug therapy such as this would be potent enough to improve the quality of life and survival of patients such that other , more expensive therapeutics are not required . Taken together , recent advancements in the identification of novel therapies and their molecular targets in MTM highlight the importance of identifying novel disease modifiers as a means to not only develop more targeted therapeutic approaches , but to also broaden our understanding of the pathomechanisms that drive this devastating disease . Consequently , the identification of pathways underlying TAM’s therapeutic effect in MTM forms the basis of my graduate work and provides the preclinical evidence necessary to accelerate its introduction into the clinical arena . 6 Pathophysiological Characterization of Mtm1 KO Mice and Mtm1 KO Mice Treated with Tamoxifen As previously mentioned , the MTM mouse model used in this study was generated by the removal of exon 4 using homologous recombination resulting in the complete loss of Mtm 1 ( Mtm1 KO ) 39 . At approximately 21 days ( 3 weeks ) of age , Mtm1 KO mice begin to display progressively severe muscle weakness and weight loss . Most importantly , Mtm1 KO mice possess a remarkably reduced lifespan of approximately 36 days . By virtue of its faithful recapitulation of both the severity of 16 the phenotypic and histopathological changes observed in the human disease , this particular model has become one of the most extensively characterized murine models of MTM in the literature 19 . Our discovery of TAM as a potential therapeutic for MTM occurred serendipitously during our study exploring Pik3c2b ablation as a novel therapeutic strategy in MTM 42 . As an experimental control for Cre - lox mediated Pik3c2b - / - Mtm1 - / - double knockout mice , untreated Mtm1 KO mice ( non - Cre , non - floxed ) were fed 40mg / kg of TAM daily , for one week . Interestingly , TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice displayed a moderate shift in their baseline survival from 35 days to 42 days 42 . To validate this observation , we begun continuously treating Mtm1 KO mice at 21 days of age with two different doses of TAM ( 3mg / kg / day ( low ) and 40mg / kg / day ( high ) ) formulated in their food chow , or standard chow ( placebo ) . Remarkably , we observed that long - term TAM treatment resulted in significant improvements in median survival to 57 days at high dose and 48 days at low dose . At the pathophysiological level , both doses of TAM increased the grip strength of Mtm1 KO mice to levels equivalent to those of wild - type ( WT ) littermate controls . Most notably , this observation was coupled with significant improvements in sacrotubular and membrane structures . Interestingly however , major histopathological improvements were seen exclusively with high dose TAM , namely a significant reduction in the abundance of centralized nuclei and increase of myofiber size . Remarkable improvements in triad number , structure and function were also exclusive to the effect of high dose TAM . Overall , our data elegantly demonstrates that TAM provides an exceptional therapeutic benefit to Mtm1 KO mice and acts in a dose - dependent manner to rescue the structural and functional integrity of skeletal muscle . Understanding the nature of this dose - dependent modulation is important for identifying whether different pathomechanisms underlie the structural and functional abnormalities we observe in myopathic muscle . Given that 3mg / kg / day is reminiscent of doses used in pediatric settings , further experimentation and dosing strategies will promote the clinical translatability of TAM and introduce the possibility of combinatorial therapeutics as a feasible approach to modulate different aspects of the disease . This dose - dependent effect is further reinforced through clinical trials reporting that “high” doses ( 80mg / day to 720mg / day ) of TAM are well - tolerated in humans and are effective for the treatment of non - breast cancers such as glioma , melanoma and lung cancer 54 . Most notably , these doses are considerably higher than the dose required to inhibit estrogen receptors ( 20mg / day ) 54 , and consequently suggests that TAM exhibits a therapeutic suitability beyond that of the treatment of ER + breast cancer . This supports our rationale for identifying the molecular sequence of events underlying TAMs therapeutic benefit in myopathic muscle as a means to uncover the etiology of 17 hallmark muscular abnormalities in MTM and in doing so , identify novel disease contributors that may in part explain the pathogenesis of MTM . 7 Estrogen Signalling as a Modulator of Skeletal Muscle Structure and Function Estrogens function to regulate cellular growth and differentiation within all tissues , and more specifically within those of the reproductive system 55 . The systemic effects of estrogens occur through the activation of estrogen receptor alpha ( ER a ) and estrogen receptor beta ( ER b ) . Once bound , 17 b - estradiol promotes the recruitment of receptor - specific transcriptional factors and coactivators that regulate the expression of several downstream ER - related genes , many of which are involved in cellular growth , development and metabolism 56 . In addition to the well - documented effect of estrogen - dependent signalling in the development of bone and reproductive tissues , the biological significance of this signalling pathway within other tissues and organ systems has become increasingly understood 55 , 57 , 58 . Mice lacking ubiquitous expression of ER a ( Esr1 KO ) display pathologies reminiscent to that of a metabolic syndrome with functional defects in a variety of tissues , namely : impaired oxidative metabolism , insulin resistance , inflammation , impaired glucose tolerance increased body fat and body mass , to name a few 59 – 62 . Consequently , modulating the actions of ER a and ER b constitutes a popular therapeutic approach for various estrogen - related diseases and most notably , cancer . TAM is the most common nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) that is used in the treatment of ER + breast cancer and other estrogen - related diseases 63 . As a structural analogue of 17 b - estradiol , TAM competes with ER ligands ( mainly 17 b - estradiol ) for binding to ER a or ER b . Depending on the tissue and cellular context within which this interaction occurs , TAM regulates the expression of different genes as either an antagonist or agonist of either receptor 63 , 64 . TAM functions to recruit tissue and cell - specific transcriptional factors and coactivators to induce downstream transcriptional signatures that are receptor - specific and moreover , correspond to the particular tissue type and cellular environment within which TAM is acting . In this way , TAM modulates vital cellular processes such as cell growth , development , differentiation and overall homeostasis 63 , 64 . This differential activity of TAM permits its dual use as both an anti - estrogenic adjuvant chemotherapeutic for ER + breast cancer , and estrogenic therapeutic for osteoporosis 54 . This is in contrast to fulvestrant , a structurally dissimilar estrogen receptor antagonist that once bound to ER a , accelerates its complete degradation 63 . In this way , 18 fulvestrant acts to completely inhibit ER a signalling and downstream transcriptional signatures . Not surprisingly , fulvestrant is commonly used as an alternative therapeutic for TAM - resistant and recurrent forms of ER + breast cancer 65 . Intriguingly , ER signaling has been recently implicated in the modulation of skeletal muscle structure and function 57 . Most notably , females with reduced circulating levels of estrogen exhibit a significant reduction in muscle strength and increased incidence of muscular atrophy 66 . Similarly , mice lacking the muscle - specific expression of ER a share similar phenotypes 59 , 62 , 67 . Not surprisingly , estrogen signalling is advantageous for maintaining the biological integrity of skeletal muscle , through protection against oxidative stress and contraction - induced injury 62 , 68 – 71 . In line with this observation , hormone replacement therapy has been shown to reintroduce estrogenic benefits in post - menopausal women ; resulting in improved force generation and structural integrity 62 , 66 . Of most relevance to the premise of my graduate work , is recent evidence implicating 17 b - estradiol and TAM as transcriptional modulators of ER - dependent genes in skeletal muscle 64 . In keeping with the fact that mechanisms of ER signaling are inherently complex , the exact manner by which this modulation occurs in the context of skeletal muscle and particularly male skeletal muscle , remains to be fully understood . This however , presents a unique opportunity for therapeutic discovery . In support of this , a recent study by Dorchies et al , was the first to demonstrate the ability of TAM to improve muscular pathology in a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) 72 . Moreover , our lab’s serendipitous but landmark discovery of TAM’s therapeutic benefit in MTM further reinforces the possibility that the dysregulation of estrogen - related genetic and / or molecular signatures may underlie distinct muscular pathologies in MTM and other muscle disorders . Identifying the mechanism of TAM’s therapeutic effect in MTM will not only help clarify our understanding of ER signaling in skeletal muscle , but also whether the existence of any estrogen - related pathologies connect the hallmark molecular pathologies of MTM ( i . e . the accumulation of PtdIns ( 3 ) P and DNM2 ) to structural abnormalities in muscle . It is also possible that abnormalities in the accumulation of PtdIns ( 3 ) P and DNM2 occur secondarily to , or as a consequence of the dysregulation of a more global pathway that modulates the overall biology of skeletal muscle . 8 Proteostasis as a Mechanism of Skeletal Muscle Maintenance In conjunction with ER signaling , the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) is another molecular mechanism that functions to maintain the overall structure and function of skeletal muscle 73 . As a 19 primary mechanism of protein turnover in mammalian cells , the UPS functions to exclusively remove misfolded and / or damaged intracellular proteins , whereas autophagic mechanisms promote the turnover of larger cytosolic aggregates 74 . Not surprisingly , the UPS regulates a variety of cellular processes such as the cell cycle and stress response . Given that muscle cells harbour a heightened sensitivity to proteotoxic stress , the UPS is particularly important for the maintenance of structural integrity within muscle fibers 73 , 75 . The dysfunction of this system is causative of a class of neuromuscular diseases known as proteinopathies , in which vital cytoskeletal proteins are misfolded and aggregated within affected muscle cells 73 . Interestingly , ER a and DNM2 are both regulated by the UPS ; where in the specific case of ER a , the proteasome mediates estradiol - induced negative feedback mechanisms to regulate ER a levels in keeping with the extracellular supply of estrogen 74 , 76 , 77 . Most notably , both 17 b - estradiol and TAM have been recently implicated as modulators of the proteasome , the activity of which significantly impacts the expression and biological function of many proteins 73 , 74 , 77 . In support of this , Kuo et al . demonstrated that TAM decreased the DNA repair activity of O ( 6 ) - methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) in HT - 29 carcinoma cells by accelerating its proteasomal degradation . Interestingly , this effect occurred independently of transcriptional changes and the intracellular expression of ER a 78 . Even more striking , are findings from Gavriilidis et al . that implicate MTM1 as a modulator of protein homeostasis for the first time . Briefly , MTM1 and ubiquilin - 2 ( UBQLN2 ) were discovered to function as a complex that triggers the cytosolic degradation of intermediate filament proteins desmin and vimentin 75 . This suggests that the degradation of cytoskeletal proteins in muscle cells prior to misfolding or aggregation is subject to tight regulation . Moving forward , this novel and possibly PtdIns ( 3 ) P - independent role of MTM1 as a mitigator of proteotoxic aggregate formation in skeletal muscle is of great relevance to uncovering the mechanism of action of TAM in MTM . It is possible that TAM functions in MTM by way of a mechanism that is independent of its traditional transcriptional role as a breast cancer therapeutic . Moreover , should TAM be found to modulate a global pathway like the UPS , it would correspond nicely with correction of molecular pathologies in Mtm1 KO mice that are both related and unrelated to the function of ERs . It is also possible that TAM modulates autophagy in MTM . Interestingly , both Al - Qusairi et al . and Fetalvero et al . show that loss of Mtm1 is associated with impaired autophagy and proteasomal 20 degradation in two different MTM mouse models 41 , 46 . However , determining whether autophagic defects underlie the primary cause of MTM , and moreover whether the therapeutic effects of TAM are a consequence of autophagic modulation warrants further investigation . Despite recent advances in our understanding of the molecular aspects of autophagy , the ability to effectively study it in vivo however , is subjective and further complicated by nature of its broad roles in health and disease . Furthermore , drugs that either inhibit or activate autophagy ( i . e . mTOR inhibitors ) also have effects in unrelated pathways ( i . e . protein , and lipid synthesis ) 47 . Consequently , it not only becomes difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these drugs in vivo , but also to ascertain whether autophagy is necessary for protection against disease , or whether its defects are responsible for the improvement in disease pathogenicity . It is for this reason that many studies present conflicting evidence . Evidently , autophagy is highly dependent on intracellular and extracellular conditions , therefore effectively turning it on and off whilst controlling for cofounding pathways requires further experimental refinement and investigation 47 , 48 . It is for this reason , that investigation into the autophagic contributions to MTM and more specifically , the role of TAM as a modulator of this pathway lay beyond the time constraints of my graduate work . 9 Summary Based on the information presented above , the specific aims of my Master’s Thesis were : 1 ) to identify whether TAM was acting dependent or independent of the ER in Mtm1 KO mice , 2 ) to validate the clinical feasibility of TAM as a novel therapeutic for MTM by identifying changes in the expression of genetic and / or molecular signatures that associate with improved phenotypes observed Mtm1 KO mice following TAM treatment . Towards the completion of my first aim , my collaborator Nesrin Sabha , focused exclusively on the pathophysiological characterization of Mtm1 KO mice , as well as the identification of the unique histopathological improvements in Mtm1 KO mice following TAM treatment . Using a variety of phenotypic and histological assessments she established hallmark structural and functional abnormalities within skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice and in doing so , defined prognostic features of the murine disease . She then characterized the remarkable ability of TAM to rescue the aforementioned pathologic abnormalities in MTM muscle . Most notably , she observed significant improvement in the activity , overall strength and median survival of Mtm1 KO mice following treatment . Furthermore , our collaborator Robert Dirksen at the University of Rochester , performed all the functional studies on triad pathology ( twitch and tetanic stimulation ) , by measuring electrically evoked Ca 2 + release in 21 single flexor digitorum brevis muscles following individual isolation from Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated Mtm1 KOs . As a well - documented modulator of ER activity , TAM is known to modulate estrogen receptor signalling by directly binding to either ER a or ER b within different tissues and cellular contexts 63 . In light of this , I first explored whether TAM’s primary mechanism of action in MTM is by way of ER modulation , and / or modulation of well - established effectors of known ER pathways . Given that ER signalling is inherently complex , and not well characterized within the context of male skeletal muscle , this study is the first of its kind to establish whether TAM exploits this pathway to improve the pathophysiology of a MTM . Moreover , should TAM function by way of a novel mechanism , be it specific or non - specific to skeletal muscle , it would have several important implications , namely the exploitation of its therapeutic potential beyond ER + breast cancer . My second aim is based on the reasonable expectation that the therapeutic effects of TAM in MTM are a consequence of discrete genetic and / or molecular changes . Furthermore , these signatures may be novel , or downstream of known ER pathways . Indeed , TAM has been reported to function independently of the ER as a modulator of several cellular pathways . In support of this , Daurio et al demonstrated that TAM acts to regulate tumor metabolism through AMPK activation , independently of ER . Moreover , TAM was able to induce cell death in both ER + and ER - breast cancer cells , and triple - negative breast cancer cells 54 . In order to characterize the nature and sequence of molecular events that occur following TAM treatment in Mtm1 KO mice , I have performed a series of drug screens in various mammalian cell lines . Through this approach , I have identified a pathway through which TAM is likely to induce the hallmark molecular improvements observed in Mtm1 KO mice . A parallel in vitro study was done by another member of our lab to further investigate the estrogen - receptor dependence of TAM , the results of which will be discussed in Chapter 4 . Consequently , the characterization of the molecular mechanism of this drug and validating its use for clinical translation in MTM patients forms the basis of my graduate work . To my knowledge , these experiments comprise the first pre - clinical validation of an FDA approved drug with potential for clinical translation as a small - molecule modifier of MTM . Taken together , it is clear from the information presented above that it is important to understand the molecular sequence of events that underlie the development of this devastating disease , and particularly whether disease - driving pathomechanisms are the same those that are preferentially 22 modulated by TAM . In this way , I aim to validate the therapeutic potential of TAM for the treatment of MTM . Perhaps one of the most impactful consequences of this work is the support it lends towards drug repurposing . This approach has immense potential to shed insight into novel implications of basic and well - established cellular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diseases that have yet to be fully understood . 23 Chapter 2 In - Vivo Analyses of the Expression and Localization of Estrogen Receptors in Mtm1 KO mice and Tamoxifen - treated Mtm1 KO mice Towards the completion of this chapter , my colleague , Nesrin Sabha , has successfully established the characteristic pathology of the Mtm1 KO mouse model and identified the most notable histopathological changes in Mtm1 KO mice treated with TAM , 17 b - estradiol and fulvestrant . Unless otherwise stated , the data presented hereafter will focus exclusively on my investigation into the unique molecular signatures underlying the Mtm1 KO phenotype , as well as on those associated with the therapeutic effects of TAM . For the pathophysiological characterization of Mtm1 KO mice treated with 17 b - estradiol and fulvestrant , Nesrin Sabha and I worked collaboratively to complete the indicated experimentation . 10 Expression of Estrogen Receptors The classic mechanism of ER signalling occurs when 17 b - estradiol binds to either ER a or ER b in the nucleus , after which receptor dimerization initiates and promotes binding of the receptor to estrogen - response elements ( EREs ) in the regulatory regions of ER - response genes 79 . Although this is the most well - known mechanism of estradiol - induced gene regulation , ERs can also regulate gene expression by two other indirect mechanisms , one of which involves recruitment of transcription factors in the nucleus and the other , activation of a series of non - genomic signalling pathways as a plasma membrane - bound receptor 79 , 80 . These latter two mechanisms , along with specialized domain structures of each ER subtype , are what enable ERs to regulate a variety of ER - response genes in an ERE - independent , genomic or non - genomic manner . For example , ERs often recruit AP - 1 transcription factor complexes in the nucleus through their AF - 2 domain to regulate the expression of cyclin D1 and IGF - I , among others 79 . Moreover , ERs ( amongst other nuclear hormone receptors ) may function as membrane - bound receptors to activate extra - nuclear , non - genomic activity of several protein - kinase signalling cascades ( i . e . MAPK , PI3K - AKT ) ; these interactions are thought to be mediated by ligand - binding domain ( LBD ) of ERs 81 , 82 , however the exact nature of this non - genomic modulation is unknown and under extensive investigation . It is evident that ER - mediated regulation of gene expression is complex as it includes three distinct signalling modalities that are either genomic or non - genomic . It is also important to note that the 24 final transcriptional signature that is induced following estradiol - mediated activation of ER a or ER b , may depend on conditions . The relative tissue expression of ER a or ER b is one such condition that can determine how a tissue or cell responds to estrogens 56 . Contrary to the proliferative role of ER a , ER b is believed to exert anti - proliferative effects in bone and reproductive tissues 79 , 83 . Other conditions include the nature of the ligand ( i . e . 17 b - estradiol , SERMs , SERDs ) , the combination of transcription factors that are recruited , and the abundance and type of downstream coregulatory proteins and components of intracellular signalling pathways 63 . These factors moreover , are highly dependent on the cell type and / or tissue within which ER subtypes are expressed . Once bound to a particular ligand , ER a and ER b possess the molecular flexibility to evoke unique transcriptional signatures as homodimers or heterodimers by way of genomic or non - genomic signalling modalities in a variety of cellular contexts 56 . This is further complicated by the fact that both ER a and ER b are subject to alternative splicing to produce protein - coding receptor isoforms that lack certain domains and consequently regulate genes by way of different mechanisms 81 , 84 . Two classic examples are the well - characterized splice variants of ER α , ER α 46 and ER α 36 , in which both or one of the transcriptional activator functions ( AF domains ) are lacking 80 – 82 . For this reason , mechanisms by which either isoform functions to regulate transcription differ from that of the full - length receptor . ER - responsive genes and genes downstream of ER - regulated signalling pathways can greatly influence the overall physiology of tissues beyond those involved in the development of reproductive cancers . Many studies have pinpointed the biological importance of estrogens and their downstream targets in non - reproductive tissues such as skeletal muscle 62 , 64 , 68 . This is particularly important given that the exact mechanism ( s ) by which ER - induced gene regulation occurs within the context of skeletal muscle , specifically in males , is poorly understood . Understanding mechanisms governing ER signalling in skeletal muscle will help to advance our understanding on the contribution of this pathway towards the development of neuromuscular diseases . This is an important strategy that may advance the development of therapies against specific receptors and / or receptor targets in complex diseases such as MTM . 25 In light of the well - established role of TAM as a transcriptional modulator of the ER , I first sought to determine the expression profile of ER α and / or ER β in skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice . By Western blot , I was able to detect the expression of two distinct isoforms of ER α , the well - characterized “wild - type” 66kDa isoform ( ER α 66 ) and a shorter 55kDa ( ER α 55 ) isoform , in Mtm1 KO mice ( Figure 4A , D ) . Furthermore , I detected a significant increase in the expression of ER α 55 in Mtm1 KO mice compared to wild - type controls ( p = 0 . 002 ) ( Figure 4C ) . and ( p = 0 . 0049 ) ( Figure 4F ) , whilst expression levels for ER α 66 remain unchanged ( Figure 4B , E ) . Given that the expression of ERs in human and murine skeletal muscle has been shown to be lower in comparison to other tissue types , it is particularly surprising to see significant enrichment of a specific ER α isoform in the skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice and most strikingly , in male skeletal muscle . Remarkably , following exposure to high and low dose TAM treatment , I was able to demonstrate that both doses induced a significant reduction in ER α 55 expression compared to untreated Mtm1 KO mice ( p = 0 . 0112 ) and ( p = 0 . 0097 ) , albeit remaining moderately high in comparison to wild - types . ( Figure 4C , F ) . This is in contrast to the expression levels of ER β , which were minimal and remained unchanged across all experimental conditions ( Figure 5 ) . This suggests that there is a specific biological consequence of ER a upregulation in MTM muscle , and moreover that the phenotypic improvements we observe following TAM treatment may be due to the specific modulation of ER a , rather than that of ERs in general . Figure 4 . High and low - dose TAM treatment reduces ER α expression in vivo . ( a , d ) Representative Western blots for ER α with b - actin loading control , for WT , WT + TAM , Mtm1 KO , and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice . Molecular weight markers indicated in kDa . Samples for each drug trial derive from the same experiment and all blots were run in parallel for each trial .

All statistical analyses were conducted 26 by two - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . Given that ER α can be expressed as many functional splice forms 81 , I sought to determine whether this 55kDa protein isoform of ER α has been previously characterized and if so , what functional information may shed light into the biological significance of its upregulation in Mtm1 KO mice . Following an extensive search of the literature search for reports and / or characterization of this isoform in previous studies , I was unable to confirm the identity of this band despite extensive literature on the different splice forms of ER a and their predicted molecular weights 81 , 85 , 86 . The antibody I used to detect ER a by Western blot is rabbit polyclonal and was manufactured by Santa Cruz ( SC - 542 , Clone MC - 20 ) ; it is therefore highly likely that this 55kDa band is in fact an isoform of ER a and not simply an unspecific endogenous murine protein . This particular clone ( MC - 20 ) has been extensively used in over 300 publications and is said to be raised against an unspecified peptide region in the c - terminus of murine ER a . This antibody , in addition to all other Santa Cruz antibodies that have been used in this project , have since been discontinued by the company . In fact , the company has recently discontinued the majority of its antibodies and replaced them with newly synthesized alternatives . Unfortunately , the only ER a alternative ( SC - 8002 , Clone F - 10 ) that is currently available from Santa - Cruz can only detect protein of human origin . When I assayed this antibody against ER a in murine muscle , I was unable to visualize any bands . Given that murine ER a spans 595 amino acids , it is possible that this unidentified 55kDa isoform is comprised of a novel peptide sequence that has yet to be characterized . As a future direction , at the protein level , a logical next step would be to conduct a series of Western blots using various ER a antibodies that have been raised against different peptide regions . For example , Western blots of quadriceps of wild - type and MTM mice should be run in parallel and visualized using the MC - 20 clone and other antibodies that have been raised against either the N - terminal region , or ER α peptides comprised of amino acids closer to the N - terminal region of the protein . Moreover , an antibody can be used that is only specific to detect the 66kDa isoform to the exclusion of others ( i . e . ER α 36 and ER α 46 ) . This would be a feasible technique with which to determine the isoform size or region that is missing in ER α 55 using a process of elimination . Although this strategy may not directly indicate the sequence composition of ER α 55 , it would be a good way to determine whether ER α 55 is in fact an ER α isoform and a general idea of which domains / amino acid regions are lacking in this particular isoform . These findings could then 27 provide a guideline within which a more comprehensive study can be designed to determine the peptide and / or cDNA sequence of the 55kDa band . Moreover , by looking into the expression of ER α in other tissues and muscle types can help determine whether the 55kDa band is muscle specific and moreover , whether the expression of this isoform is inherently increased in all ER α - expressing tissue types of MTM mice . Figure 5 . The effect of high - dose TAM on the expression of ERß . Representative Western blot for ER ß ( a ) , with b - actin as a loading control ; position of the molecular weight markers indicated ( in kDa ) . Both protein isoforms can be seen at approximately 66kDa and 55kDa . Protein levels of both the 66kDa ( b ) and 55kDa ( c ) isoform were determined by densitometry and standardized to b - actin . Graphs represent five biological replicates and the fold difference from the average of the WT ± SEM . ( n = 5 mice per group ) . Unlike ER a , there is no significant differences in the expression of either isoform of ERß between treatment groups . All statistical comparisons were conducted by two - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . Only one 55kDa isoform of ER α is reported in Ensembl ( ENSMUST00000105588 . 7 ) and UniProt ( D3Z6V3 ) with a 3’ sequence unique from that of the well - characterized 66kDa isoform ( ENSMUST00000105590 . 7 ; P19875 ) . All other regions of this annotated 55kDa isoform are identical in sequence to that of the 66kDa isoform . According to UniProt , the protein sequence of the 55kDa isoform spans from amino acid 10 to 490 . To determine whether the isoform that is enriched in Mtm1 KO muscle is identical to the annotated one , I designed 3 sets of primers for each isoform that were complementary to the 3’ sequence of the 66kDa isoform and the unique 3’ sequence of the annotated 55kDa isoform . I then investigated whether I could detect the ER α mRNA in the quadriceps of Mtm1 KO mice by reverse transcriptase - PCR ( RT - PCR ) . Despite being able to successfully detect the 66kDa isoform of ER α , I was unable to successfully isolate this 55kDa isoform based on the reported sequence ( Figure 6 ) . Although it is possible that my 28 primer sets were not specific enough or required further optimization , it is also likely that this isoform has not been well - characterized . Consequently , I carefully excised the bands corresponding to both the 66kDa and 55kDa ER α isoforms from a well separated SDS - PAGE gel and sent both bands from WT and Mtm1 KO mice to the SPARC BioCentre at the Hospital for Sick Children for identification by mass spectrometry . Unfortunately , results gleaned from this experimental strategy were non - specific in that neither ER α 66 or ER α 55 were identified as abundant proteins in quadriceps samples from either WT or Mtm1 KO mice . This inconsistent result may have occurred for a variety of reasons . For example , more abundant proteins ( i . e . globulins ) have the same molecular weight ( 50 - 70 kDa ) as both isoforms and may therefore masked the expression of other less abundant peptides . The success of this experiment highly depends on my ability to effectively conduct the crude isolation of both bands of interest from an SDS - PAGE gel by eye , to the exclusion of any surrounding proteins . This therefore represents a likely disadvantage of this strategy , and it may in part explain why I was unable to accurately detect or determine the peptide sequence of either isoform by mass spectrometry . Figure 6 . RT - PCR mediated isolation of ER α 66 and ER α 55 mRNAs . Two of the three sets of primers against the 3’ sequence of ER α 66 were successful in isolating a 180bp amplicon . Neither primer set designed specifically against the unique 3’ cDNA sequence of the annotated 55kDa ER α isoform were successful in isolating the predicted 171 base - pair amplicon . This suggests that the 55kDa isoform of ER α that I have observed by Western blot is not the same as the 55kDa protein coding isoform of ER α annotated in Ensembl and Uniprot . In order to determine whether ER α upregulation in Mtm1 KO mice was a consequence of isoform - specific transcriptional dysregulation , and whether TAM was acting as a transcriptional modulator of ER α , I investigated the expression levels of ER α mRNA in all four experimental conditions by real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) . I designed primers for ER α that spanned genetic regions that were unaffected by alternative splicing using Primer 3 Input ( Version 0 . 4 . 0 ) . For comparison , I also conducted the same analysis for ER b . Contrary to protein expression , ER a mRNA levels were 29 significantly decreased in Mtm1 KO mice ( p = 0 . 0048 ) compared to controls ( Figure 9A ) . This conflicting result likely suggests that ER a transcription is decreased to offset the increased expression of the receptor in Mtm1 KO mice . The reason for this overabundance however , is not known . Interestingly however , ER a mRNA expression remained unchanged between TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice and untreated Mtm1 KO mice ( Figure 9A ) . This suggests that TAM is likely acting to modulate ER a protein expression by way of an unknown post - transcriptional mechanism in the context of MTM . Note , I was unable to accurately detect ER b mRNA levels in murine quadriceps by RT - PCR or qPCR within all experimental conditions . Moreover , I was unsuccessful in detecting ER b mRNA in other types of skeletal muscle ( hamstring , and gastrocnemius ) . 11 Localization of Estrogen Receptor Alpha ( ER a ) While most investigations into the transcriptional signatures of ER α signalling focus primarily on those that are characteristic to its role as a nuclear receptor , a growing body of evidence has begun to highlight the biological importance of extra - nuclear functions mediated by ER α 79 , 80 , 82 . For this reason , I sought to determine whether the localization of ER a in Mtm1 KO mice was predominantly extra - nuclear . In this way , I hoped to provide an explanation for discrepancies in the protein and mRNA expression levels of ER a , and the post - transcriptional modulation of TAM . To accomplish this , I examined the localization of ER a in the tibialis anterior ( TA ) of Mtm1 KO mice by immunofluorescence . Note , I was unable to conduct this analysis in quadriceps muscle because the TA was the only muscle group that was extracted and cryopreserved specifically for histopathological analysis . Moreover , ER α localization studies were only conducted in TA from mice treated with high - dose TAM given that TA from low - dose TAM treated animals was not readily available at the time as it was prioritized for use in other histopathological analyses . Traditionally , ER α is expressed in the nucleus where it acts to modulate the expression of target genes in a tissue and cell - specific manner 79 . However , recent studies have demonstrated that ER α can also exist as a functional receptor at the plasma membrane 79 , 80 , 82 . ER α does not exist as an inherent transmembrane membrane protein , and therefore only associates with the cell membrane following palmitoylation 82 . Furthermore , membrane - associated ER α has been associated with extra - nuclear transcriptional signatures that are distinct from those that are observed following nuclear ER α signalling 82 , 87 . In like manner to reproductive tissues where ER α is highly expressed , 30 ER α is also expressed in the nucleus in both human and murine muscle tissues ( male and female ) 88 . In light of my observations that ER α exhibits a unique transcriptional and protein signature in MTM mice , I was interested in determining whether this dysregulation arose by consequence of the abnormal cellular distribution and / or localization of ER α . Figure 7 . Mtm1 KO mice harbour the expression of a perinuclear , membrane associated ER a . Immunofluorescence against ER α ( red ; indicated by a white arrow ) in sections of tibialis anterior ( TA ) from WT , WT + TAM , Mtm1 KO and Mtm1 KO + TAM mice ( blue = DAPI ) ( n = 3 mice per group for WT and WT + TAM , n = 4 mice per group for KO and KO + TAM ) . It is important to note that ER α exhibits an abnormal membrane - associated expression pattern in Mtm1 KO mice ( white arrow ) , in comparison to WT mice , where ER α is expressed primarily in the nucleus ( ER α and DAPI co - localization is indicated in pink ) . Interestingly , this membrane - associated expression is reduced in the presence of TAM . Interestingly , I was able to show for the first time that ER α exhibits an abnormal pattern of localization in the skeletal muscle of MTM mice . Instead of being highly enriched in the nucleus ( as demonstrated in WT mice ) , I found that ER α is primarily localized and highly expressed at perinuclear membrane regions ( Figure 7 ) . Moreover , by visual inspection , this membranous expression appears to be reduced , though not completely , in MTM mice treated with high - dose TAM ( Figure 7 ) . These findings suggest that the overall function and signalling mechanism of ER α in Mtm1 KO mice is distinct from that of nuclear ER α and that TAM is acting to promote the nuclear association of this receptor through an unknown mechanism . It is possible that downstream effectors of classic extra - nuclear signalling mechanisms ( i . e . PI3K / AKT ) 79 are prevalent or active in Mtm1 KO mice and may act to contribute towards certain pathogenic features of the disease . The likelihood of this phenomena highlights the need to identify whether a particular ER α isoform 31 underlies this differential localization , or whether the translocation of ER α 66 to the membrane constitutes a novel pathogenic characteristic of MTM skeletal muscle . Note that the ER α antibody used for immunofluorescence was also supplied from Santa Cruz ( SC - 7207 , Clone H - 184 ) and has also since been discontinued . Contrary to MC - 20 , this antibody is raised against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 2 - 185 in the N - terminal region of the protein . For this reason , a logical next step would be to determine whether this membrane - bound ER α represents the 55kDa isoform of ER α observed by Western blot . One approach would consist of visualizing protein expression using the H - 184 ER α antibody . I attempted this but was unable to detect any specific signals by Western blot . I would consider using other ER α antibodies raised to the same epitope as an alternative . It may also be possible that the 55kDa isoform shares a similar N and C - terminal sequence to that of ER α 66 but has undergone some form of post - translational modification that enables its preferential targeting to the cell membrane . Lastly , subcellular fractionation experiments may help to determine whether ER α 55 is primarily localized to cytoplasmic ( membranous ) or nuclear regions and moreover , the subcellular compartment within which ER α 55 is expressed . The relative distribution of ER α at the cell membrane in Mtm1 KO mice may be an important indicator of the physiological response to ER - mediated transcriptional activity and may also in part explain the responsivity of MTM mice to TAM and 17 b - estradiol . Moreover , this membrane - bound ER α may be acting to modulate the biological effects of estrogens and / or TAM to a different extent in myopathic muscle . Given the novel nature of these localization studies , it is only appropriate to speculate upon the physiological role of this membrane - bound ER α within the context of MTM pathogenesis and the overall physiology of male murine skeletal muscle . Taken together , these in vivo findings indicate that ER α expression is extra - nuclear and dysregulated within the context of MTM skeletal muscle . 12 Analysis of Whole - RNA sequencing in Mtm1 KO and Tamoxifen - treated Mtm1 KO Murine Models . In light of the well - established role of TAM as a modulator of ER signalling 63 , should we observe any significant changes in the transcriptional expression of known ER - dependent genes , it is possible that this modulatory action underlies TAM’s therapeutic mechanism of action in MTM . This is not only supported by my discovery that TAM modulates the expression and localization 32 of ER a in MTM mice , but also a growing body of evidence implicating both estrogens and TAM as activators of downstream ER signalling pathways in skeletal muscle , and modulators of muscle strength and integrity 57 , 59 , 61 , 62 , 64 , 70 , 71 . The exact mechanism through which estrogens promote this functional benefit however , is incompletely understood . Similarly , whether TAM exerts a primarily estrogenic or anti - estrogenic effect in skeletal muscle is also unknown . Given that the mechanisms underlying ER - signalling in skeletal muscle are poorly understood 57 , 62 , 68 , our understanding of the regulatory networks of ER - dependent genes and / or cellular pathways in skeletal muscle is limited . In an effort to address this , I conducted a total RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) study in collaboration with the Toronto Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children . This undertaking is the first transcriptome - wide RNA seq study of its kind to be conducted in a murine model of MTM , and the first to generate a comparative transcriptome between Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice . With the help of our bioinformatics team lead Dr . Arun Ramani and Dr Michael Brudno , I examined the expression profiles of all genes expressed in the quadriceps muscle of Mtm1 KO mice , and determined whether the phenotypic corrections promoted by TAM are a consequence of ER - dependent transcriptional modulation . I also conducted a comparative analysis between transcriptome data from our RNA - seq study , and gene expression data from a study by Noguchi et al : a cDNA microarray gene profiling assay in human skeletal muscle biopsies of eight genetically confirmed cases of MTM . This analysis allowed us to identify whether transcriptional signatures were conserved between species and consequently , expand the repertoire of transcriptional changes that may underlie the presently unknown etiology of muscular abnormalities in MTM . The existence of any shared transcriptional signatures between species would assert the relevance of our murine model to the human disease . This characterization of the transcriptional landscape of Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice has the potential to advance the field in many ways . These data sets can be used in the further investigation of mechanisms of ER signalling in male skeletal muscle and also shed insight into whether the function and / or molecular consequences of this signalling network are sexually dimorphic . Consequently , we are able to determine whether TAM’s therapeutic benefit in MTM mice is a consequence of transcriptional modulation . An immediate implication of this , would involve identifying a potentially novel mechanism of action for TAM in skeletal muscle . Lastly , our analyses have introduced a novel data set from which further study into MTM pathogenesis can be done . By simply analyzing differentially expressed transcripts between Mtm1 KO mice and 33 wild - type controls , we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic bases of skeletal muscle development and maintenance . Lastly , should we identify specific genes and / or transcriptional changes that are amenable to therapeutic intervention , we will have further demonstrated a novel translational implication of this data set . Not surprisingly , RNA - seq has become a powerful tool for the study of disease mechanisms , given that it can be used to generate a series of unbiased and genome - wide associations between different pathophysiological characteristics of a disease and the existence of underlying transcriptional alterations . Indeed , this approach has important implications towards our understanding of MTM pathogenesis in that it not only uncovers novel genetic contributors of disease in MTM , but also the transcriptional consequences of a novel - small molecule therapeutic with a poorly characterized mechanism of action in skeletal muscle . Based on conclusions drawn from the molecular changes observed in ER a expression and localization in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice , I sought to determine whether the primary action of TAM in MTM mice was by way of ER a modulation and the transcriptional regulation of ER - related genes , or a novel mechanism of action . 13 Transcriptional Landscape of Mtm1 KO mice Total RNA was extracted from a total of 16 samples across all four experimental conditions ( WT , WT + TAM , KO , KO + TAM , n = 4 mice per group ) , and were prepared in accordance with TCAGs sample requirements ( see Materials and Methods ) . Samples were subsequently submitted for total RNA - seq at the TCAG using the Illumina HiSeq platform . Raw read counts were generated , and differential gene expression analyses were conducted by Dr . Arun Ramani and carried out using both DESeq and edgeR ( see Material and Methods ) . Note , RNA - seq was performed on animals treated with high - dose ( 40mg / kg / day ) TAM only , given that low - dose ( 3mg / kg / day ) TAM experiments had not yet begun at the time of this experiment . My rationale for choosing to conduct RNA - seq in place of a custom qPCR array arose primarily from my desire to conduct a comprehensive investigation into all possible transcriptional changes within each experimental condition . Furthermore , given that no other total transcriptome analyses have been conducted in murine models of MTM to date , performing total RNA - seq presented the attractive possibility of finding novel transcriptional signatures in Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated animals to potentially explain the unique clinical and pathologic features in MTM . 34 Moving forward , I sought to first examine whether genes of interest were dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice alone , in order to generate a rationale for their subsequent correction with TAM . For example , should gene X be upregulated in Mtm1 KO mice in comparison to controls , and following TAM - treatment be reduced to wild - type levels , it would strongly suggest that TAM was acting to modulate the transcription of gene X within the context of MTM . Moreover , upon further investigation , it may also be determined that this transcriptional modulation underlies TAMs therapeutic mechanism of action in MTM . For this reason , I sought to first examine the expression of disease - related genes of interest , followed by known ER - dependent genes and genes involved in muscular integrity and function in Mtm1 KO mice alone , and then in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice . In this way , I aim to determine whether the therapeutic benefit of TAM in MTM is a consequence of transcriptional regulation , and moreover whether this regulation is independent or dependent of ERs . Figure 8 . Rationale for relative transcriptional comparison . Illustrative example of the exploratory analysis conducted to determine whether TAM modulates the transcription of specific genes in Mtm1 KO mice . TAM is understood to act transcriptionally should TAM restore the expression of a specific gene back to wild - type levels . In either scenario , TAM may act to either increase the expression of significantly downregulated genes or conversely , decrease the expression of significantly upregulated genes in Mtm1 KO mice . This relative comparison however , was not found to be true for any gene in our RNA sequencing study , and strongly suggests that TAM is not acting via a transcriptional mechanism in skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice . I observed 849 differentially expressed transcripts in untreated Mtm1 KO mice ( p £ 0 . 01 ) in comparison to wild - type controls ( Figure 10B ) . Not surprisingly , the most highly enriched GO term groupings in Mtm1 KO mice included genes involved in the maintenance of overall muscular integrity , contractile function and organellar dynamics ( Table 1 ) . As my primary line of analysis , I first examined the transcriptional profiles of disease - specific genes of interest . Unsurprisingly , Mtm1 was significantly downregulated in Mtm1 KO mice ( p = 5 . 70E - 08 ) and TAM - treated Mtm1 35 KO mice ( p = 4 . 70E - 22 ) , compared to TAM - treated controls ( Figure 11B ) , ( Table 4 ) . Ryr1 was also significantly downregulated in Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls ( p = 0 . 0013 ) ( Table 4 ) ; this is interesting given that Ryr1 is another CNM - gene that encodes a calcium release channel that plays a key role in the initiation of muscle contraction following T - tubule depolarization 14 ; structural dysregulation of the triad structure in Mtm1 KO mice may therefore in part be due to abnormal RYR1 expression . Conversely , Pik3c2b was not transcriptionally modulated in any experimental condition ( Table 4 ) ; this is in accordance with the lack of change in PIK3C2B protein expression across all experimental conditions ( Figure 14 ) , ( Figure 18 ) and lends further support towards the likelihood that TAM is not acting to improve MTM pathophysiology by way of Pik3c2b modulation . In light of my observations that both ER a and DNM2 are abnormally expressed at the protein level in Mtm1 KO mice , it was particularly striking to observe transcriptional signatures for both Esr1 and Dnm2 that were not in accordance with protein expression . Esr1 was significantly downregulated in Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls ( p = 0 . 012 ) ( Figure 11B ) ( Table 4 ) , a finding which I further validated by real - time qPCR ( p = 0 . 0048 ) ( Figure 9A ) . Although this is in contrast to abnormally high expression of an ER a isoform in Mtm1 KO mice ; it is unlikely that this transcriptional downregulation is a consequence of a particular splice form of Esr1 given that no splice variants were shown to be enriched by RNA - seq and moreover , the qPCR primers I had designed for Esr1 were against gene regions that were not affected by alternative splicing , according to the sequences published under the NCBI Ascension number NM _ 007956 . 4 ( murine Esr1 ) . Given that ER a is tightly regulated through a well - established negative feedback system , it is possible that Esr1 transcription is downregulated in Mtm1 to circumvent abnormally high ER a expression . It is also interesting to note that TAM treatment in MTM muscle does not appear to transcriptionally regulate Esr1 ( Figure 9A ) ( Table 4 ) , a finding that does not intuitively correspond with a significant decrease in ER a at the protein level in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice ( Figure 4 ) . 36 Figure 9 . Effect of TAM on mRNA expression of ER a and DNM2 . ( a ) Graph depicting mRNA levels of ER a and ( b ) DNM2 in WT and Mtm1 KO mice , and TAM - treated WT and Mtm1 KO mice . Expression levels of ER a and DNM2 were determined by real - time qPCR and analyzed using the 2 DD CT method . Values were normalized to TBP for ER a , actin for DNM2 and represent the fold difference from the average of the WT ( n = 6 mice per group ; graph represents 9 technical replicates for each mouse and ± SEM ) . Of note , is that these results are superimposable to expression levels determined by RNA - seq . All statistical analyses were conducted using two - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P £ 0 . 05 , * * P £ 0 . 01 , * * * P £ 0 . 001 , * * * * P £ 0 . 0001 . Although the transcriptional modulation of Esr1 does not appear to provide an appropriate rationale for exploring whether TAM may be working through an ER - dependent mechanism to improve MTM pathogenesis , it is possible that TAM may alternatively function to modulate the signalling activity of ER a in MTM . It is reasonable to speculate that ER - signalling activity is increased and / or abnormal in Mtm1 KO mice by virtue of the abnormal expression of ER a . Interestingly , only two ER - dependent genes , Junb and Fosl1 , were found to be significantly upregulated in Mtm1 KO mice in comparison to controls ( p = 0 . 00013 and p = 1 . 7E - 02 , respectively ) . The dimerization of these two gene - products forms the AP - 1 transcription factor complex , which is often recruited by ER a - bound estrogens and SERMs to regulate the transcription of genes that promote cellular proliferation and differentiation 56 . It is therefore possible that the abnormal expression these genes , coupled with the upregulation of ER a in Mtm1 KO mice leads to abnormalities in ER signalling and may in part explain some of the hallmark structural and functional pathologies of myopathic muscle . I speculate however , that downstream effectors of the AP - 1 transcription factor complex are different within the context of skeletal muscle . This is because I did not observe any other significant transcriptional changes in any other ER - dependent genes ( i . e . intracellular signalling molecules , enzymes and secreted proteins ) that are known to directly mediate estrogen action in reproductive and cancerous tissues 79 . It is therefore possible that ER signalling occurs by way of novel downstream effectors in skeletal 37 muscle . In support of this , Ribas et al recently demonstrated that ER a regulates mitochondrial metabolism and autophagic flux in murine skeletal muscle through the modulation of PKA - Rcan1 - calcineurin signalling 62 . They were able to demonstrate this in vivo by establishing that muscle - specific depletion of ER a resulted in muscle - specific metabolic abnormalities and overall mitochondrial dysfunction 62 . For this reason , the biological consequences of aberrant ER a expression and activity in Mtm1 KO mice merits further investigation and may provide novel insight into the molecular abnormalities that underlie some of the structural and functional defects of MTM skeletal muscle . The overall growth and maintenance of biological integrity within skeletal muscle is comprised of a complex cascade of regulatory and signalling pathways that function to promote differentiation , maturation and proliferation 89 . These mechanisms are under the strict control of several well - established genes , which when dysregulated have been associated with developmental abnormalities in skeletal muscle . In light of the severe morphological , structural and functional defects observed in MTM , I sought to determine whether myogenic and / or structural regulatory genes were dysregulated in muscle of Mtm1 KO mice ; in doing so , I hoped to also identify genes that may be novel transcriptional targets of TAM in my subsequent analyses . Surprisingly , I found only a small subset of genes to be significantly dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice in comparison to wild - type littermates . Pax7 , a transcription factor that promotes post - natal muscle growth through regulating the activation and proliferation of satellite cells 89 , was significantly downregulated ( p = 0 . 003 ) in Mtm1 KO mice and conversely its regulatory factor myogenin ( MyoG ) , was significantly upregulated ( p = 1 . 20E - 09 ) . A growing body of evidence suggests that a cross - inhibitory interaction exists between Pax7 and certain myogenic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) ( i . e . myogenin ) 90 , 91 . These results therefore , demonstrate the possibility that the hallmark morphological abnormalities of myopathic muscle may in part be explained by the dysregulation of novel regulatory mechanisms in skeletal muscle maintenance and repair . Several genes encoding structural components of skeletal muscle were also significantly dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice . This included the upregulation of myomesin 3 ( Myom3 ) along with genes encoding myosin heavy chains ( Myh3 , Myh8 ) ( p = 9 . 70E - 25 and p = 1 . 40E - 19 ) , actinin - alpha - 2 ( Actn2 ) ( p = 0 . 0057 ) , and the downregulation of genes encoding myosin light chains ( Myl1 ) ( p = 0 . 0055 ) , their kinases ( Mylk2 , Mylk4 ) ( p = 2 . 20E - 05 ) and actinin - alpha - 3 ( Actn3 ) ( p = 0 . 00029 ) . Indeed , these transcriptional signatures may in part explain the significant dysregulation we have 38 observed in the sarcomeric ultrastructure of Mtm1 KO mice . Moreover , further investigation into the abnormal expression of actin and myosin proteins may shed insight into the origin of muscle contraction defects . Of note , I did not observe any significant transcriptional differences for two other important sarcomeric genes ( i . e . Neb , and Ttn ) . Given that this RNA - seq study was conducted exclusively in the quadriceps of Mtm1 KO mice , this represents a particular limitation that may in part explain why I was unable to observe any significant changes in the transcription of all other regulatory genes involved in the development and maintenance of skeletal muscle . The quadriceps is not the most severely affected muscle - type in Mtm1 KO mice and is less severely affected than the tibialis anterior ( TA ) which was used for all histopathological analyses . My rationale for conducting all molecular analyses in the quadriceps was a consequence of sample availability . It is therefore possible that a comparative RNA - seq study conducted across all affected muscle types in Mtm1 KO mice would provide us with a more comprehensive idea of the genetic dysregulation that occurs in MTM and whether specific transcriptional signatures associate with disease severity . It is possible that the dysregulated expression of specific MRFs and other regulatory genes occurs preferentially within severely affected muscle types . Muscular atrophy represents another pathological hallmark of skeletal muscle in MTM and other neuromuscular diseases 19 . Consequently , several studies have sought to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying this abnormality in an effort to identify novel therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases . Myostatin is a myokine that is exclusively produced and released by muscles cells to inhibit the growth and differentiation of skeletal muscle 92 . For this reason , many have sought to inhibit myostatin expression as a means to treat atrophying neuromuscular diseases . Counterintuitively , however , both our transcriptional findings and those of Mariot et al , demonstrate that both myostatin ( Mstn ) and another gene of the myostatin signalling pathway ( i . e . follistatin Fst ) are intrinsically dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice 93 . Moreover , Mariot et al also demonstrated that human muscle biopsies from six other neuromuscular disorders display a similar transcriptional signature , with Mstn downregulation corresponding to disease severity 93 . By showing that only AAV - mediated gene replacement of Mtm1 was able to significantly restore myostatin levels in Mtm1 KO mice , Marion and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that Mstn downregulation occurs in atrophying muscle to counterbalance the wasting process . This is in agreement our observations of a significant decrease in Mstn ( p = 0 . 0011 ) and corresponding 39 increase in Fst ( p = 6 . 90E - 05 ) in Mtm1 KO mice . This demonstrates that reduced myostatin is not entirely a reflection of muscle loss but rather of the inherent dysregulation of this pathway in atrophying muscle . Further investigation into the reason for this may uncover a novel role of Mtm1 as a modulator of the myostatin pathway and moreover , how we come to understand mechanisms of muscle atrophy in neuromuscular disease . Similarly , Noguchi et al conducted the first cDNA microarray study on human muscle biopsies of eight genetically confirmed cases of MTM in order to investigate whether alterations in the expression of genes encoding cytoskeletal and sarcolemmal proteins can cause dysregulations in the intracellular architecture to then cause severe structural abnormalities in MTM muscle 94 . Given that this is the only other comprehensive analysis into the expression of approximately 4 , 200 genes in skeletal muscle of MTM patients , I sought to determine whether there was significant overlap between the findings on the murine and human transcriptome . Should any transcriptional signatures be found to be conserved between species , it may be that these genes play an important role in MTM pathogenesis . Noguchi et al observed approximately 181 significantly changed genes in their analyses 94 . Interestingly , our RNA - seq results overlapped for 135 of these genes , with only 39 showing significant differences between Mtm1 KO mice and wild - type controls ( Table 5 ) . This discrepancy may in part be attributed to expression of species - specific genes , and the fact that their cDNA microarray approach was biased to 4 , 200 genes of skeletal muscle and did not cover all of the human transcriptome . Moreover , Noguchi et al analyzed a variety of unspecified skeletal muscle biopsies in human MTM patients and subject each muscle type to the same cDNA microarray , whereas I only conducted RNA - seq on quadriceps . Of particular importance is the fact that neither the expression of E3 - ubiquitin ligases Fbxo32 ( MURF1 ) , Trim63 ( Atrogin1 ) nor the expression of their transcription factors ( Foxo genes ) were found to be upregulated in either study between MTM samples and wild - type controls . This indicates that the muscular atrophy that is observed in both our specific MTM mouse model , and MTM patient biopsies is unlikely a consequence of the activation of these two E3 ubiquitin ligases that are well - established promoters of skeletal muscle atrophy . This is in contrast to another study in Mtm1 KO mice where both Fbxo32 and Trim63 were found to be upregulated 41 . This discrepancy may be attributed variability of strain , and a variety of environmental and / or experimental conditions that may affect the expression of these genes . Evidence from a recent study suggests that modifiable factors such as nutrition and exercise can influence expression of these genes , and subsequent activation of various catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle 95 . Taken together , findings from this initial stage of 40 transcriptional analysis identifies several dysregulated genes upon which TAM may act to improve the pathophysiology of Mtm1 KO mice . Moreover , TAM may modulate abnormal ER signalling in MTM by way of a novel mechanism of action . Further examination of the transcriptional signatures in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice will shed further insight into the likelihood of these phenomena . 14 Effect of Tamoxifen on the Transcriptional Landscape of Mtm1 KO mice Surprisingly , despite the phenotypic improvements promoted by TAM , I observed very little change in the transcriptome of Mtm1 KO mice . Indeed , I was able to only identify 29 differentially expressed genes ( p £ 0 . 01 ) between Mtm1 KO mice and their TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice ( Figure 10B ) ( Table 6 ) . It is particularly important to note that the transcriptional profiles of Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice cluster together and are distinct from wild - type controls ( Figure 10A ) . This strongly indicates that , contrary to its well - established function as a transcriptional modulator 63 , TAM is not acting to modulate of the transcriptome in Mtm1 KO mice . Figure 10 . Tamoxifen treatment does not appear to alter the transcriptome of Mtm1 KO mice . ( a ) Heat map indicating overall mRNA expression profiles of the four experimental groups ( n = 4 mice per group ) . It can be appreciated that the expression profiles of Mtm1 KO and Mtm1 KO + TAM cluster together and are distinct from WT and WT + TAM . This strongly suggests that TAM does not affect the transcriptome of Mtm1 KO mice . ( b ) Comprehensive table of the total number of differentially expressed transcripts in each comparison with p values of £ 0 . 05 and £ 0 . 01 , respectively . Note that only 29 genes are differentially expressed ( p £ 0 . 01 ) in Mtm1 KO vs . Mtm1 KO + TAM . Not surprisingly , one of the most significantly enriched GO term groupings between TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated controls was “response to estradiol” ( GO ID : 0032355 ) ( Table 41 2 ) . However , after examining the overall expression of ER - response genes within this category across all experimental conditions , expression of all these genes showed no significant differences under any condition . Most importantly , I observed that none of these genes were transcriptionally changed following TAM exposure ( Figure 11A ) . Although Esr1 expression was significantly downregulated in Mtm1 KO mice , TAM treatment did not modulate expression of this transcript ( Figure 11B ) ; a finding which I validated using qPCR ( Figure 9A ) . Interestingly , progesterone receptor ( Pgr ) is the only ER - response gene that appears to be transcriptionally modulated by TAM in both WT ( p = 1 . 70E - 11 ) and Mtm1 KO mice ( p = 7 . 60E - 05 ) , exhibiting significantly increased expression in comparison to untreated wild - type and Mtm1 KO controls , respectively ( Figure 11B ) ( Table 4 ) . Evidence from a recent study by Mohammed et al demonstrates that the progesterone receptor ( PR ) acts to modulate ER a signalling and in human ER a + breast cancer 96 . In the presence of an agonist ligand , Mohammed and colleagues were able to demonstrate that PR associates with ER a to modulate its activity and induce positive clinical outcomes 96 . Similarly , another study by Nola et al showed that TAM exposure was able to increase PR expression whilst lowering ER a expression in endometrial cancer and promotes a favorable prognosis . This functional interrelatedness corresponds nicely with studies implicating both ER a and PR as regulators of oxidative metabolism of rat skeletal muscle 53 . It is therefore possible that in the context of MTM , TAM may act to increase the expression of Pgr in order to induce a regulatory effect on ER a and promote phenotypic improvement in Mtm1 KO mice by way of a novel mechanism . However , in the context of myopathic muscle TAM appears to be modulating the transcription of Pgr independently of disease context , given that TAM - treated wild - type mice also harbour increased PR mRNA expression ( Figure 11B ) . I would need to further examine the protein expression of PR and its downstream effector proteins in order to determine whether receptor activity is correspondingly upregulated in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice . To answer this question , I attempted to detect the levels of PR by Western blot in all four experimental conditions . However , due to the limited success of mouse antibodies against PR , I was unable to accurately detect receptor expression . In future experimentation , I plan to further optimize these studies in an effort to clarify whether PR and ER a are functionally linked in MTM . If successful , this conclusion would be novel within the context of myopathic skeletal muscle . 42 Figure 11 . Average expression of ER - response genes in the MTM transcriptome . ( a ) Box plot of the average expression of estrogen receptor - responsive genes within each experimental group . Genes illustrated within this box plot correspond to the subset of transcripts that were enriched in KO + TAM compared to WT under the GO term “response to estradiol” ( GO ID : 0032355 ) . It can be appreciated that there are no significant differences in the expression of classic ER responsive genes overall , and more specifically , in TAM - treated animals . ( b ) Individual expression box plots of the only significantly changed ER - response genes : Esr1 and Pgr1 , and of Mtm1 . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . In an effort to further investigate whether TAM was acting to modulate the expression of ER - dependent genes , I conducted an extensive search of the literature to identify any studies that have in like manner to our RNA - seq project , conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of genes that are regulated by the ER , and furthermore , which transcriptional signatures are associated with each receptor subtype . In my review of the literature , I found a study conducted by Roforth et al , where they performed global RNA - seq on osteoblastic cell lines with specific mutations in ER a that restrict the mode of receptor signalling 97 . This is important given that 17 b - estradiol signalling occurs primarily through nuclear estrogen receptors in osteoblasts . Roforth and colleagues classified downstream transcriptional signatures in accordance with ER subtype and signalling modality : ERE - dependent ( nuclear ERE ) , ERE - independent ( nuclear , non - ERE ) and extra - nuclear ( membrane - bound , non - ERE ) 97 . This is relevant given that this data set provides a comprehensive list of genes and pathways that are associated with each ER a signalling modality . For this reason , I chose to use this data set as a tool to classify gene expression in our RNA - seq data set according to ER dependence and in doing so , contributed to an enhanced understanding of ER signalling in skeletal muscle and whether TAMs action in MTM exhibits transcriptional signatures that are novel or distinct . 43 Interestingly , I found that TAM treatment did not affect the transcription of any genes that were mentioned in this study . I observed no significant changes in the expression of any disease - related genes . This is particularly interesting given that it suggests TAM is likely functioning at the post - transcriptional level to improve the pathology of MTM mice . Furthermore , our relative comparison approach ( Figure 8 ) was not found to be true , because overall no dysregulated gene in Mtm1 KO mice was found to be normalized following TAM treatment . TAM - treated wild - type mice also did not exhibit any significant differences in the expression of ER - related genes , with the exception of Pgr which was upregulated by 8 . 4 - fold ( p = 1 . 70E - 11 ) in comparison to untreated wild - type controls ( Table 4 ) . This suggests that TAM is not acting to modulate ER - dependent genes within the context of murine skeletal muscle , in general . The only exception was the significant increase in the expression of Fbxo32 ( p = 0 . 0098 ) and Trim63 ( p = 0 . 021 ) in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice when compared to untreated wild - type controls . Despite the well - characterized role of these two genes as regulators of skeletal muscle atrophy 95 , it is possible that TAM promotes the transcription of these genes in order to promote the degradation of accumulated proteins , such as DNM2 and ER a . The likelihood of this phenomena is further substantiated by my observation that neither gene is intrinsically dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice , suggesting that neither gene function as an atrophic promoter within this disease model . Furthermore , contradictory protein and mRNA expression levels in Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice suggests that TAM is acting by way of a mechanism that increases protein turnaround without altering mRNA expression . By virtue of their role as atrophic genes , Fbxo32 and Trim63 promote protein degradation as E3 - ligases of the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) . It is thus possible that TAM is acting post - transcriptionally through the activation and / or modulation of the UPS by way of its functional enzymes ( E3 - ubiquitin ligases ) in order to improve MTM pathology . Further experimentation to verify this would require an investigation into the expression of these ligases at the protein level to corroborate increased mRNA levels . When analyzed in conjunction with levels of proteasomal activity in both Mtm1 KO mice and TAM - treated animals , this approach may provide us with suitable readout of functional activity . It is important however , to acknowledge a final caveat of this RNA - seq study , which is the possibility that TAMs transcriptional activity may be dictated by muscle type . In order to address this , it would be useful for us to conduct a similar RNA - seq study to examine the genetic signatures 44 of other muscle types of TAM - treated mice—with particular emphasis on muscles that are more severely affected and undergo striking morphological changes following TAM treatment ( i . e . the TA ) . The likelihood of this possibility is evidenced by the ability of TAM to promote distinct transcriptional signatures in different tissues . Taken together , these results indicate a new and unanticipated non - transcriptional mechanism of action of TAM in MTM , and the overall biological context of male skeletal muscle . 45 Chapter 3 In - Vivo Analyses of the Expression of PIK3C2B and DNM2 in Mtm1 KO mice and Tamoxifen - treated Mtm1 KO mice 15 Expression and Activity of PIK3C2B Based on my observation that TAM does not appear to be modulating protein levels of ER α through a transcriptional mechanism , I sought to investigate whether TAM’s speculated post - transcriptional activity was mediated by way of other disease - relevant , and non - transcriptional targets . Recently , both Pik3c2b and Dnm2 have been identified as novel genetic modifiers of MTM 26 , 42 . Genetic knockdown or molecular inhibition of either of these genes has shown to significantly improve the pathophysiology of the Mtm1 KO mouse model . For this reason , I first examined whether TAM was acting to modulate the expression of these two gene - products and moreover , whether ER α modulation occurred downstream or in parallel to these changes . To accomplish this , I began by investigating protein expression of PIK3C2B in both high and low - dose TAM treated mice . PIK3C2B has become a therapeutic target in a variety of cancers by virtue of its overexpression at the protein and mRNA level in malignant states . Moreover , siRNA - mediated inhibition strategies have shown promise in the reduction of cancerous proliferation and metastases . Interestingly however , I found that PIK3C2B expression remained unchanged by either dose of TAM ( Figure 12 ) and remained consistent across all experimental conditions . This is not surprising however , given that the Dowling lab has previously shown that PIK3C2B levels were not dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice . 46 Figure 12 . High and low - dose TAM treatment does not reduce PIK3C2B expression in vivo . ( a . c ) Representative Western blots for PIK32B with HSP90 loading control , for WT , WT + TAM , Mtm1 KO , and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice . Molecular weight markers indicated in kDa .

All statistical analyses were conducted by two - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . It is still possible that TAM may act to modulate or inhibit the kinase activity of PIK3C2B . To investigate this , we measured PI3P expression levels by both immunohistochemistry and mass ELISA . PI3P is a major phospholipid product of PIK3C2B that our lab has previously shown to be accumulated in animal models of MTM 39 – 41 . Moreover , in light of MTM1’s regulatory function on PI3P as a phosphatase , the modulation of PI3P levels through genetic and / or pharmacological intervention has yielded pathophysiological improvement in Mtm1 KO mice 42 . Surprisingly , PI3P expression was visibly high in Mtm1 KO mice by IHC and remained unchanged in the presence of high dose TAM ( Figure 13A ) . This suggests that TAM’s therapeutic mechanism in MTM does not involve the reduction of PI3P . By mass ELISA , however , PI3P expression was unchanged across all experimental conditions ( Figure 13B ) The great deal of variability between each sample may be rectified by increasing sample numbers for Mtm1 KO mice and their TAM - treated littermates . 47 Figure 13 . High - dose TAM treatment does not alter PI3P expression in vivo . ( a ) Immunohistochemistry against PI3P in WT and Mtm1 KO mice , and TAM - treated littermates shows no overall difference in PI3P expression following treatment with high - dose TAM ( n = 3 mice per group ) . Contrary to recent evidence presented in our recent paper demonstrating the therapeutic benefit of PI3P reduction in Mtm1 KO mice by way of PIK3C2B ablation , it is likely that that TAM acts to improve MTM pathology through a mechanism of action that is independent of PIK3C2B modulation . This illustrates the complexity of MTM pathogenesis and presents the likelihood that the disease can be modulated by way of multiple mechanisms . ( b ) Mass ELISA against PI3P further indicates that expression levels remain unchanged across all experimental conditions ( n = 3 - 6 mice per group ) . Work by myself and Nesrin Sabha . Lastly , we sought to determine whether TAM acts to directly inhibit PIK3C2B kinase activity . To accomplish this , we conducted the Adapta â Kinase Assay in collaboration with ThermoFisher Scientific in order to directly examine the kinase activity of PIK3C2B . Briefly , this assay uses ADP formation as a measure of kinase activity . After the kinase reaction is allowed to take place for 60 minutes ( in the presence of substrate and ATP ) , a Europium - labelled ADP antibody and fluorescent ( Alexa - Fluor â 647 ) labelled ADP tracer is added to the reaction well and ADP formed by the kinase assay is then determined by TR - FRET . In the presence of an inhibitor , a high TR - FRET signal is observed by virtue of a higher proportion of intact interactions between the antibody and tracer since less ADP is present to promote the displacement of the fluorescently labelled ADP tracer from the antibody . Interestingly , we found that TAM was unable to inhibit the kinase activity of PIK3C2B 42 in vitro ( Figure 14 B ) . This is further evidenced by Wortmannin , a known inhibitor of PIK3C2B , that was used as a positive experimental control ( Figure 14 A ) . It is important to note that the IC 50 of TAM is 40µM that not only exceeds the dose we use in our in vivo studies but is also higher than the IC 50 of Wortmannin , which was 500nM . 48 Figure 14 . High - dose TAM treatment does not inhibit PIK3C2B activity in vitro . Graphs generated by ThermoFisher Scientific of PIK3C2B kinase activity . The effect of TAM on PIK3C2B kinase activity was investigated by way of an in vitro kinase activity assay using purified PIK3C2B enzyme . Both the in vitro assay and graphs were generated by ThermoFisher Scientific and depict the percent inhibition of PIK3C2B by Wortmannin ( positive control ; IC 50 = 500nM ) and TAM ( IC 50 = 40µM ) . This demonstrates that at significantly high concentrations , TAM is unable to effectively inhibit PIK3C2B . This therefore suggests that TAMs therapeutic benefit in Mtm1 KO mice is not a consequence of PIK3C2B inhibition . Assay completed by myself and by Kamran Rezai . Taken together , we conclude that TAM’s therapeutic mechanism in MTM does not involve the modulation of the expression or activity of PIK3C2B . This suggests that TAM acts to modulate a different pathological mechanism in Mtm1 KO mice to result in a similar but not permanent rescue of disease phenotypes that our lab had observed following the genetic ablation of PIK3C3B in Mtm1 KO mice . These findings elegantly demonstrate that the pathophysiology of MTM is inherently complex and results from the dysregulation of multiple factors . Moreover , our observations that TAM is able to promote muscle - specific improvements without altering the expression of PI3P and kinase activity of PIK3C2B , suggests that the modulation of other pathomechanisms involved in MTM has similar therapeutic benefit . This therefore allows us to explore the existence of other pathological factors that are amenable to therapeutic modulation . In this way , we are not only able to learn more about the complex molecular , structural and functional abnormalities that underlie MTM pathogenesis , but also how to best target these pathomechanisms with other novel , effective and well - tolerated therapeutic strategies . 16 Expression and Modulation of DNM2 Aside from its well - established role as the genetic cause of ADCNM , Cowling et al further established that DNM2 undergoes negative regulation by MTM1 9 , 25 , 26 . After having first identified a 1 . 5 to 2 - fold increase in DNM2 protein expression in both human and murine MTM1 deficient muscle , Cowling and colleagues determined that a 50 % reduction in Dnm2 at the genetic level in Mtm1 KO mice was sufficient to rescue most pathogenic features of the disease . Around the same 49 time , Chin et al conducted an extensive molecular study in C2C12 myotubes using tet - regulatable adenoviral vectors to demonstrate that three ADCNM - associated Dmm2 mutations ( R465W , A618T and S619L ) are gain - of - function or hypermorphic 8 . Similarly , when wild - type DNM2 was overexpressed in C2C12 myoblasts , a similar “hyperactive” signature was observed . Hypermorphic forms of DNM2 promote excessive membrane fission and tubulation , ultimately resulting in T - tubule fragmentation and triad disorganization in vitro 9 . Although the exact sequence of molecular events through which DNM2 accomplishes this effect is not known , recent biochemical studies have indicated that CNM - associated mutations in Dnm2 promote oligomer stability and increase GTPase activity by interfering with an intramolecular auto - inhibitory mechanism 34 . Taken together , these findings suggest that in the absence of MTM1 , DNM2 levels are elevated . It is therefore possible that specific aspects of the MTM phenotype arise as a consequence of DNM2 hyperactivity 8 . The implications of this phenomenon would be novel given that to date , no functional relation between MTM1 and DNM2 has been established ( despite their indirect connection by way of Bin1 11 – 13 , 35 ) . Indeed , the study conducted by Cowling et al was the first to establish a functional link between MTM1 and DNM2 and provide sufficient evidence in support of their action within a common pathway , in conjunction with BIN1 25 . Although the exact mechanism governing the negative regulation of DNM2 by MTM1 is not known , one group has provided evidence in support of its existence in their efforts to validate the therapeutic potential of DNM2 downregulation in MTM . Two recent studies conducted by Tasfaout et al successfully reduced DNM2 at the protein level by ASO or single injection of AAV - sh Dnm 2 in Mtm1 KO mice 44 , 45 . Importantly , both strategies restored muscle function , histology and ultrastructure . This demonstrates that DNM2 downregulation represents an attractive therapeutic approach for MTM , and that it can be achieved using clinically relevant strategies . Lastly , these studies shed insight into the biological importance of DNM2 within the context of MTM pathogenesis and demonstrate that muscle pathology in MTM is likely amenable to therapeutic reversal Although it is clear from this data that MTM1 and DNM2 function together in a common pathway that regulates the biological and functional integrity of skeletal muscle , it is still unclear as to how dysregulation of this pathway contributes to MTM pathology . In light of this , I sought to determine whether DNM2 levels are subject to regulation by TAM , given that the phenotypic improvements we saw in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice strongly resemble those seen following DNM2 50 downregulation alone . In light of the evidenced therapeutic benefit of DNM2 modulation in MTM , identifying whether it is regulated by TAM would help to not only clarify its role in MTM pathogenesis but also as a functional partner of MTM1 in the overall development and maintenance of skeletal muscle . In line with findings reported by Cowling et al 26 , I was able to show that DNM2 protein levels were significantly increased in Mtm1 KO mice compared to wild - type controls ( p = 0 . 0025 ) ( Figure ) and ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 15A , C ) Importantly , I also observed that this increased protein expression was not a consequence of increased transcription : by qPCR I was able to demonstrate that DNM2 transcript levels were not significantly increased in Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls ( Figure 9B ) . My findings correspond nicely with that of Cowling et al , where they attribute the significant increase in DNM2 protein to increased protein stability and / or decreased turnover in MTM muscle 26 ; whether either mechanism was at play in Mtm1 KO mice however , was not explored . By Western blot I was able to demonstrate that DNM2 protein levels are significantly downregulated by both high and low dose TAM ( Figure 15A , C ) This is particularly important given that this is the first study to demonstrate that DNM2 levels can be modulated by a small - molecule with therapeutic potential in MTM . In the quadriceps of Mtm1 KO mice treated with either high dose or low dose TAM , DNM2 protein levels were significantly downregulated to levels similar to that of wild - type animals ( p = 0 . 0025 ) ( Figure 15B , p < 0 . 0001 ) and ( Figure 15D ) . It is particularly important to note that both high and low doses of TAM appear to be downregulating DNM2 in wild - type animals . It can be appreciated that the standard error of the mean of the average expression of DNM2 in TAM - treated wild - type animals is approximately half of that of untreated wild - types ( Figure 15B , D ) . Although this difference was also only statistically significantly by two - tailed student t - test ( p = 0 . 051 for high dose ) and ( p = 0 . 025 for low dose ) , it suggests that both doses of TAM have a generalized effect on DNM2 levels in skeletal muscle . In keeping with this , we also observed a non - significant change in myofiber size in wild - type mice treated with both high and low dose TAM . The relationship between DNM2 expression and myofiber size however , is unknown . 51 Figure 15 . High and low - dose TAM treatment reduces DNM2 expression in vivo .

Protein levels of DNM2 as determined by densitometry for ( b ) high - dose TAM and ( d ) low - dose TAM , standardized to b - actin and represented as fold difference from the average of WT ± SEM ( n = 4 mice per group for each drug ) . Note that in both high and low - dose TAM treatments , DNM2 protein levels are reduced in TAM - treated WT animals to approximately half of that of the untreated wild - types . Moreover , the SEM of high and low dose TAM - treated mice is also approximately half of that of untreated wild - types . This difference is only statistically significant by unpaired student t - test ( p = 0 . 051 and 0 . 025 ) . All statistical analyses were conducted by two - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . Importantly , by qPCR I found that high - dose TAM did not affect DNM2 transcript levels ( Figure 9B ) . This strongly suggests that increased DNM2 protein expression in MTM muscle occurs through an unknown post - transcriptional mechanism that may function to promote protein stability and / or prevent degradation . Interestingly , both ER and DNM2 are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) 74 , 76 , 77 ; it is therefore possible that the dysfunction and / or modulation of this mechanism contributes to disparities in protein and mRNA levels for both of these genes . It is important to note that as a consequence of sample availability , I was unable to examine DNM2 mRNA levels in low dose treated animals . However , based on my observation that transcriptional differences do not explain the changes in protein expression , I do not expect to see any difference in DNM2 transcript levels in Mtm1 KO mice treated with low dose TAM . Taken together , my findings present DNM2 modulation as an attractive therapeutic mechanism of TAM . This is further evidenced by the fact that the phenotypic improvements seen with TAM treatment are superimposable to those seen with the genetic reduction of DNM2 alone 26 , 44 , 45 , 51 . 52 My findings provide further evidence in support of the association between DNM2 accumulation in MTM pathogenesis . Moreover , I have successfully shown TAM’s therapeutic benefit is likely mediated in part through the post - transcriptional regulation of DNM2 , although further investigation is necessary to clarify the molecular mechanism through which this regulation occurs . Whether this post - transcriptional regulatory mechanism is specific to DNM2 or also applies to ER a requires further investigation . Interestingly , Totta et al recently demonstrated that DNM2 is required for ER a signalling and the degradation of ER a through the endolysosomal system 98 . It is therefore possible that DNM2 and ER a undergo simultaneous downregulation by TAM , or perhaps function to regulate one another . 17 Protein signatures in Mtm1 KO Mice Following Treatment with 17 b - estradiol and Fulvestrant Given that the therapeutic benefits of TAM in Mtm1 KO mice are reminiscent of the protective effects of estrogens within skeletal muscle 57 , we sought to determine whether the histopathological influence of TAM was a consequence of ER agonism . To do this , we treated Mtm1 KO mice with either 17 b - estradiol , an ER agonist 63 , 64 , or fulvestrant , an ER antagonist 65 . We treated Mtm1 KO mice by subcutaneous injection on a daily basis with either 17 b estradiol ( 1 . 0 µ g / day ) or fulvestrant ( 1mg / kg / day ) , starting at 21 days of age . Intriguingly , we observed that only treatment with 17 b - estradiol resulted in a significant increase in survival ( median age of 56 days ) . Although 17 b - estradiol treated Mtm1 KO mice displayed a subjectively greater level of physical activity than untreated Mtm1 KO littermates , treatment with 17 b - estradiol did not result in any structural and / or functional improvements in skeletal muscle . Following an extensive series of histopathological and functional analyses , we observed no significant changes in the structure or function of the skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice treated with 17 b - estradiol . Interestingly , Mtm1 KO mice treated with fulvestrant did not display any improvements in overall pathophysiology or survival and in some cases ( by anecdotal observation ) , fared worse than their untreated Mtm1 KO littermates . Taken together , this initial pathophysiological characterization favors ER agonism as a mechanism for TAMs improvement of survival . Whether the structural and functional improvements observed in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice are mediated by a similar mechanism of ER agonism requires further investigation . One way to investigate this would require treating mice with different doses of 17 b - estradiol to determine whether the absence of histopathological improvements in Mtm1 53 KO mice treated with 17 b - estradiol arose by consequence of improper dosing . It is possible however , that this approach also yields no further effect of 17 b - estradiol in the context of MTM . This would suggest that TAM is acting to improve the pathology of MTM by way of a novel and potentially ER - independent mechanism . It is particularly important to note that the latter scenario does not necessarily mean that ER expression is not required for the proper functioning of this mechanism . In the meantime , I sought to investigate the molecular signatures of 17 b - estradiol and fulvestrant - treated Mtm1 KO mice in order to determine whether they are similar to those of Mtm1 KO mice treated with high and low dose TAM . This is a secondary approach that may in part help to explain why 17 b - estradiol treatment does not promote a similar phenotypic improvement . Figure 16 . 17 b - estradiol reduces ER a expression in vivo . ( a ) Representative Western blot for ER a with b - actin loading control , for WT , WT + EST , Mtm1 KO , and EST - treated Mtm1 KO mice . Molecular weight markers indicated in kDa . Samples derive from the same experiment and multiple blots were run in parallel . Protein levels of the ( b ) 66kDa and ( c ) 55kDa isoforms of ER a as determined by densitometry , standardized to b - actin and represented as fold difference from the average of WT ± SEM ( n = 4 mice per group ) . All statistical analyses were conducted by two - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . Surprisingly , by Western blot I was able to show that 17 b - estradiol induced a significant downregulation of ER α 55 expression in quadriceps of Mtm1 KO mice . Although this modulation is similar to that of both high and low doses of TAM , it is important to note that protein expression of ER α 55 was decreased by approximately 5 fold ( p = 0 . 0280 ) in Mtm1 KO mice treated with 17 b - estradiol ( Figure 16A , B ) which is approximately half in comparison to the 10 fold decrease seen in high and low dose TAM treated animals ( Figure 4 ) . Moreover , ER α 55 levels in 17 b - estradiol - treated animals remained high in comparison to untreated controls , although this difference was not significant . Although the biological significance of ER α downregulation in myopathic muscle is incompletely understood , it can be speculated that by virtue of its known protective effects in skeletal muscle , this molecular change may in part explain the lack of any significant 54 histopathological improvement in skeletal muscle of 17 b - estradiol treated mice . Similarly , I observed a significant 0 . 5 - fold decrease in DNM2 expression ( p = 0 . 0181 ) in skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice treated with 17 b - estradiol ( Figure 17A , B ) . It is particularly important to note that this modulation was less than the 2 - 3 - fold downregulation of DNM2 in Mtm1 KO mice treated with high and lose dose TAM ( Figure 15 ) . DNM2 levels remained higher in estradiol treated animals when compared to untreated controls ( Figure 17B ) . By virtue of the role of DNM2 as a genetic modifier of MTM1 26 , and its speculated involvement in T - tubule biogenesis 12 , 13 , it can also be hypothesized that sufficient downregulation ( to that of wild - type levels ) is required in order to promote significant phenotypic improvements in skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice . Figure 17 . 17 b - estradiol and fulvestrant exert contrasting regulatory effects on DNM2 expression in vivo . Representative Western blots for DNM2 with b - actin loading control , for WT and Mtm1 KO mice treated with ( a ) 17 b - estradiol and ( b ) fulvestrant . Molecular weight markers indicated in kDa .

Protein levels of DNM2 as determined by densitometry for ( b ) 17 b - estradiol and ( d ) fulvestrant , standardized to b - actin and represented as fold difference from the average of WT ± SEM ( n = 3mice per group for each drug ) . All statistical analyses were conducted by two - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . In like manner to high and low dose TAM treated animals , I was able to demonstrate that 17 b - estradiol was unable to modulate the protein expression of PIK3C2B in Mtm1 KO mice ( Figure 18 ) . In light of this observation , and the corresponding lack of change seen with high and low dose TAM , I chose not to further examine the expression level of PI3P or the kinase activity of PIK3C2B in estradiol - treated mice . Note , I was unable to examine the expression of ER α and PIK3C2B in fulvestrant treated animals due to limited sample availability ( n = 3 mice per group ) and the significant difficulties that were encountered when extracting protein lysates from these animals . Given that fulvestrant was dissolved in miglyol prior to administration , all protein lysates 55 from fulvestrant - treated animals harboured increased amounts of miglyol that had accumulated at the sample surface following the boiling step . Prior to resolving samples by Western blot , I took care to remove this oily and cloudy layer without disturbing the underlying protein lysate . For these aforementioned reasons , I prioritized investigating the expression levels of DNM2 in fulvestrant animals . Moreover , given that the exclusive downregulation of DNM2 has been shown rescue MTM pathology , should DNM2 levels remain significantly increased in fulvestrant - treated animals , it would lend further support towards the mechanistic importance of DNM2 downregulation by TAM , and promote the existence of a novel and likely specific molecular relation between DNM2 and TAM . Figure 18 . 17 b - estradiol does not alter PIK3C2B expression in vivo . ( a ) Representative Western blot for PIK32B with HSP90 loading control , for WT and Mtm1 KO mice treated with 17 b - estradiol . Molecular weight markers indicated in kDa .

I was able to demonstrate that DNM2 protein expression levels represent an appropriate molecular indicator of therapeutic efficiency in Mtm1 KO mice , as I was able to show that fulvestrant is unable to decrease the expression of DNM2 by Western blot ( Figure 17C , D ) . This finding corresponds nicely to the lack of phenotypic improvement and poor prognoses of these mice . Taken together , my findings suggest that the effect and mechanism through which TAM acts to improve MTM pathology is reflective of the administered dose and occurs in part through DNM2 downregulation . The fact that high - dose TAM improves specific structural and functional abnormalities in MTM mice that low dose TAM and 17 b - estradiol do not is consistent with this assertion . Lastly , our ability to improve the median survival of Mtm1 KO mice with 17 b - estradiol strongly suggests that TAM works by ER agonism to improve survival in MTM . Whether other structural and functional improvements seen in high and low dose TAM animals requires further 56 investigation . Moreover , it appears as though the structural and functional benefits of TAM - induced DNM2 downregulation in MTM occurs by way of a PI3P - independent mechanism . The exact nature of this mechanism however , and whether it functions as a primary driver of pathology in MTM remains unclear . The likely mechanism ( s ) and its modulation in relation to TAM dosage is currently under investigation . 57 Chapter 4 In - vitro Analyses in Murine and Human Cellular Models to Identify Tamoxifen’s Therapeutic Mechanism of Action in XLMTM In spite of the extensive use of TAM as an adjuvant chemotherapeutic in the treatment of ER + breast cancer , a growing body of evidence suggests that TAM is also a modulator of many non - genomic and ER - independent signalling pathways 54 , 99 , 100 . Interestingly , this novel role has been most extensively studied and reported within the context of cancer . As an activator of AMPK signalling and mTOR inhibition in vitro and in vivo , TAM has been shown to effectively induce cytotoxicity and cell death 54 . Moreover , as an evidenced modulator of oxygen consumption in both ER - and ER + tumors , TAMs ER - independent induction of bioenergetics stress holds a great deal of promise as a novel regulatory tool of tumor metabolism 54 , 101 . In a similar vein , TAM , has been recently shown to regulate the expression and function of many proteins as a modulator of the UPS 78 , 102 , 103 . Briefly , TAM has been shown to reduce the expression and function of two oncogenic proteins ( MGMT and Clusterin ) 78 , 102 , and one metastasis driving transcription factor ( Twist1 ) 103 by accelerating their proteasomal degradation in a concentration dependent manner and more importantly , without affecting mRNA levels . Interestingly in each study , TAM - induced degradation occurred independently of genomic estrogen signalling and could be blocked following the administration of a proteasomal inhibitor . Not surprisingly , this unanticipated function of TAM lends support towards its clinical use not only within a broad range of cancers , but also other diseases that are characterized by abnormalities in specific signalling and / or metabolic pathways . For this reason , the role of TAM as a modulator of the UPS is an exciting avenue to pursue within the context of MTM pathogenesis , given that UPS activation is the means by which 17 b - estradiol induces the degradation of ER a in order to maintain receptor homeostasis and consequently ensure adequate estrogen - dependent ER signalling events within the cell 77 . In the presence of MG - 132 , a potent proteasomal inhibitor , the ability of estradiol to bind to ER a and subsequently induce ERE - dependent transcription in MCF7 cells was compromised 76 . Interestingly , TAM did not enhance the inhibitory action of MG - 132 , and therefore strongly suggests that TAMs modulatory function on ER a cannot be accomplished when the proteasome is blocked . 58 This suggests that proper ER signalling relies heavily on ER a homeostasis . Given that I have shown the upregulation of a specific ER a isoform in Mtm1 KO murine muscle , it is therefore possible that this receptor accumulation explains why we observe phenotypic abnormalities that are reminiscent of those seen in mice lacking muscle - specific expression of ER a 62 . Moreover , this suggests that the mechanisms regulating the expression of this specific ER a isoform are perturbed in MTM and may provide an explanation for why mRNA levels of ER a are significantly decreased in Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls . The specific nature of this regulatory mechanism in Mtm1 KO mice however , is unknown . In light of this , and the recently demonstrated role of DNM2 as a regulator of ER a degradation and estrogen - dependent ER a signalling pathways in MCF7 cells 98 , it is possible that TAM acts by way of the proteasome to regulate the expression of DNM2 and ER a . Moreover , the modulation of this pathway in MTM may provide an explanation for why we see changes in protein expression while mRNA levels remain unaffected . Finally , my rationale for investigating proteasomal regulation as a governing mechanism for TAMs therapeutic benefit in MTM is further supported by the fact that Ridaifen - B ( RID - B ) ( a novel TAM derivative ) inhibits the function of the catalytic core of the 20S proteasome in vitro as a noncovalent and nonpeptidic inhibitor 104 . Furthermore , Hasegawa et al were able to determine the exact proteasomal substrates to which RID - B was bound in order to execute its inhibitory function . Moreover , RID - B has also been shown to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in ER - negative tumors through the same pathway as TAM , however with greater potency 104 . It is therefore possible that should TAM be identified as a modulator of the proteasome in MTM , comprehensive docking studies and simulations of TAM can be done in conjunction with RID - B and other derivatives in order to elucidate the binding mode of TAM and furthermore , which modes are conducive to inhibition and / or activation . Briefly , the UPS is the primary mediator of protein degradation in mammalian cells where following ubiquitination , marked proteins are shuttled to the proteasomal complex and subsequently degraded within the hollow , cylindrical core particle ( 20S ) 105 . Consequently , this pathway has become a popular drug - targetable factor throughout the therapeutic landscape of various cancers and common diseases that arise as a consequence of an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation . Bortezomib ( BZ ) and MG - 132 are two of the most extensively studied and clinically used inhibitors of the proteasome ; both drugs were found to act primarily on the two 59 of the three proteolytic sites within the b subunits of the 20S core ( chymotrypsin - like and caspase - like subunits ) 105 . Not surprisingly , both drugs have been used extensively to study a variety of cellular mechanisms . Given the fact that my findings demonstrate that TAM functions as a modulator of DNM2 and not PIK3C2B , my goal was to identify whether this specific regulation was accomplished through the UPS and whether this mechanism was dependent or independent of ER a . Both these insights and my in vivo and transcriptional findings highlight the need for a manipulable model in which to test the effects of TAM in the presence and absence of further genetic and chemical interventions . For example , an established cellular model of MTM with a consistent molecular readout would be highly beneficial for pathway studies . Establishing a reliable in vitro model would allow me to perform specific drug screens , for example using both BZ and MG - 132 , to then establish a molecular sequence of events that substantiate the molecular basis of the physiological improvements we observe in TAM - treated MTM mice and build a strong preclinical argument for the use of TAM as a novel therapeutic for this devastating disease . 18 Estrogen Receptor Dependence of Tamoxifen in XLCNM In order to further explore the ER dependence of TAMs mechanism of action in MTM , I began by first investigating this phenomenon in a manipulable cellular model . In this way , I am able to conduct a more in - depth study of the molecular sequence of events that occur within a cell following TAM treatment , and given that DNM2 is ubiquitously expressed , I am able to observe this process within a variety of cellular models . I began to first establish whether TAMs modulation of DNM2 can be reproduced in vitro , and if this process depends on the presence or absence of ER a . To accomplish this , I investigated the effect of TAM on human fibroblasts from MTM patients and controls . This was my first line of investigation given that it is the most physiologically relevant cell model available to me and because it allowed me to also assess the relevance of this modulation to the human disease . All control ( n = 3 ) and MTM ( n = 3 ) fibroblast lines were purchased from Coriell Biorepositories , with the exception of one ( MTM1D ) which was derived from a 27 - year - old XLMTM patient ( REB # 1000009004 ) . This patient was moderately affected and harboured a novel intronic 4 base pair deletion ( c . 232 - 26 _ 232 - 23delGACT ) in MTM1 that was detected by sanger sequencing of genomic 60 DNA . According to the phenotypic information provided by Coriell , MTM1A and MTM1B were isolated from clinically affected boys at approximately one month of age . The first patient ( MTM1A ) possessed two nucleotide changes , a single nucleotide deletion at amino acid 646 ( 646delT ) and a single nucleotide substitution ( C > A ) at 648 , resulting in a frameshift in exon 8 of Mtm1 ; the second patient ( MTM1B ) possessed a missense variant ( c . 1180G > C ) resulting in a substitution at amino acid 394 . Both patients were severely affected and deceased by one year of age . Figure 19 . ( a ) Representative Western blot for MTM1 , with b - actin loading control in untreated control and Mtm human fibroblasts . Molecular weight indicated ( in kDa ) . Arrow indicates the absence of the 60kDa MTM1 protein in all three MTM cell lines ( p = 0 . 0005 ) by unpaired student t - test .

Molecular weight indicated ( in kDa ) . Both the 66kDa and 55kDa isoforms of ER a are negligibly expressed in these lines . Control line f7 was not available at the time this experiment was conducted , and due to limited antibody availability , I was unable to verify whether this line also expressed ER a . However , given that all control fibroblast lines were purchased from Corriel , and were all of similar origin , I do anticipate that f7 will also express ER a when verified in the future . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . Prior to performing any experiments , I verified that all three MTM lines ( passage 10 ) did not express MTM1 by Western blot ( p = 0 . 0005 ) ( Figure 19 ) but did however , express both isoforms of ER a ( Figure 20 ) . In my primary analysis , I sought to determine whether DNM2 expression was also significantly increased in MTM fibroblasts compared to controls . With the intention of performing a drug trial following this analysis , I cultured all control and MTM fibroblast lines under the same conditions as the drug screen , in order to ensure that culture conditions did not affect the underlying molecular signatures . Briefly , all 6 lines were harvested at equal passage ( passage 10 ) and subsequently seeded at a density of 1 . 5x10 5 cells / well ( 10 % fetal bovine serum media ) in a 6 - well plate , with care taken to ensure an approximately even cellular distribution within each well ; three 6 - well plates were used ( each line was assayed in triplicate ) . After 24 hours , I extracted total protein from each plate and ran a Western blot against DNM2 . Note that protein 61 lysates from each plate were not combined so that I could run three different protein blots ( 6 lines / blot ) , each corresponding to the lines harvested from a single 6 - well plate . I was able to demonstrate that DNM2 was significantly increased in all three MTM lines compared to controls ( p = 0 . 0170 ) ( Figure 21A , C ) . Although this finding is consistent with Cowling et al , where they also demonstrated increased DNM2 levels in human fibroblasts 26 , I was able to establish this signature with two other MTM patient lines that have yet to be reported in the literature . This finding also illustrates that DNM2 accumulation in MTM is not muscle - specific . Finally , by demonstrating that increased levels of DNM2 is a molecular signature that is shared between the murine in vivo model and human in vitro model , my findings set a strong precedent for the biological relevance of subsequent molecular investigations towards the pathology of the human disease . Figure 20 . ( a ) Expression level of estrogen receptor alpha in human fibroblasts . ( a ) Representative Western blot for ER a with b - actin loading control in untreated human fibroblasts . Molecular weight indicated ( in kDa ) . Both the 66kDa and 55kDa isoforms of ER a are negligibly expressed in these lines . Next , I sought to determine whether TAM functions to modulate DNM2 levels in vitro . To accomplish this , I administered increasing doses of TAM ( 500nM , 10 µ M , 15 µ M and 20 µ M ) to all control and MTM fibroblast lines for a period of 24 hours . All 6 lines were harvested and seeded as described above . Three plates were used for 10 µ M TAM ( samples assayed in triplicate ) and two plates for all other concentrations ( samples assayed in duplicate ) . A particularly important caveat was the limited availability of MTM1D by virtue of its slower rate of growth . In light of previous evidence from in vitro studies in which TAM was administered to breast carcinoma cultures , a concentration of 10 µ M was sufficient to induce a cellular response 106 . For this reason , I anticipated that this concentration would induce a change in DNM2 levels and therefore , designated available cultures of MTM1D for in vitro studies of 10 µ M TAM . 62 Figure 21 . 10 µM TAM is sufficient to significantly reduce DNM2 in human fibroblasts .

( c ) Relative protein levels of DNM2 in untreated and 10 µM treated fibroblasts determined by densitometry , standardized to b - actin and represented as the fold difference from the average of the control ± SEM ; graph represents 3 technical replicates . It can be appreciated that DNM2 expression is significantly increased in untreated MTM fibroblasts compared to controls ( p = 0 . 0170 ) and that 10 µM TAM significantly reduces DNM2 levels in MTM fibroblasts in comparison to untreated MTM controls ( p = 0 . 004 ) . DNM2 levels in wild - type fibroblasts are unchanged in the presence of TAM . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 After 24 hours , I prepared 250 µ L of a 4mM working solution of TAM ( 10 µ L of 50nM TAM to 240 µ L of DMSO ) , of which an appropriate amount was added to each well to reach the desired drug concentration . For example , a 10 µ M concentration was achieved by pipetting 2 µ L of the 4nM solution directly to each well ( 2mL of media ) . Two plates of control and MTM lines treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO were used as an experimental control . Once the drug was added , I evenly distributed the drug by gently pipetting the media up and down the side of each well to ensure that no cells were lifted . Cells were treated with TAM for a period of 24 hours after which , total protein was harvested . Anecdotally , after 24 hours I observed a moderate degree of death in wells treated with 15 µ M TAM , and to a greater extent with 20 µ M TAM . 63 Finally , I performed a series of Western blots against DNM2 for each dose in order to determine whether TAM was able to reduce DNM2 levels in vitro . Remarkably , for the first time I was able to demonstrate that exposure of human MTM cells to 10 µ M TAM produced a significant decrease in DNM2 ( p = 0 . 004 ) ( Figure 21B , C ) , with a dose - dependent reduction observed at15 µ M and 20 µ M ( Figure 22 ) . In line with my previous findings , this suggests that TAM’s modulatory action on DNM2 is not muscle - specific and may be due to the fact that DNM2 is ubiquitously expressed . Moreover , to my knowledge , this is the first time any small - molecule therapeutic has been shown to modulate DNM2 levels within the context of the human disease , and therefore has significant implications for future pathomechanistic studies and more comprehensive investigations into TAMs mechanism of action . Figure 22 . TAM significantly decreases the levels of DNM2 in human MTM fibroblasts in a dose - dependent manner .

All samples derive from the same experiment , with two separate blots run in parallel for each concentration ( n = 3 biological replicates for controls ( f4 - f7 ) , n = 2 biological replicates for MTM ) . ( d ) Relative protein levels of DNM2 in each treatment determined by densitometry , standardized to b - actin or HSP90 , and represented as the fold difference from the average of the corresponding treated control ± SEM ; graph represents 2 technical replicates for 500nM , 15 µM and 20 µM TAM ) . DNM2 levels are significantly increased in untreated MTM fibroblasts compared to untreated controls ( p = 0 . 0170 ) . Statistical comparisons were not conducted for 500nM , 15 µM or 20 µM given the small n number ( limited by sample availability of MTM1D ) . It can be appreciated however , that DNM2 levels appear to be decreasing with increasing doses of TAM . It is important to note that I was unable to perform these experiments in fibroblasts from Mtm1 KO mice and age - matched littermate controls . Once established , these lines can be further differentiated into myotubes and investigated in conjunction with human MTM lines in order to 64 conduct a comprehensive in vitro study of MTM pathogenesis , develop novel therapeutic strategies and most importantly , provide substantial preclinical validation for any potential therapeutic candidates . In a similar vein , our lab has developed a protocol for the direct culturing of murine myotubes directly from muscle . Although this process is particularly time consuming and rigorous , I have begun to work to establish myoblast cultures form Mtm1 KO mice and littermate controls . Should these lines be successfully established , myoblast lines from the muscle of TAM - treated animals may also be isolated and used for further in vitro investigation . Taken together , my findings elegantly suggest that an increase in DNM2 is not secondary to other improvements of muscle histology and function in MTM and occurs in the presence of ER a in a human in vitro model . Consequently , DNM2 reduction appears to be the primary means by which TAM functions to improve MTM pathophysiology . Moreover , by showing that TAM functions to modulate DNM2 in the presence of ER a both in vivo and in vitro , my findings strongly suggest that TAM may act through the same molecular mechanism in both mice and humans , within the context of MTM . Consequently , insights gleaned from any subsequent pathway analyses are both relevant and applicable to the human disease . In this way , my findings build a foundation upon which to further investigate TAM’s mechanism of action and that of other candidate therapeutic drugs within the context of the human disease , which can subsequently act as a direct indication of clinical feasibility . In light of the supposed non - muscle specific action of TAMs modulation of DNM2 , I sought to further examine whether this effect was present only within the context of Mtm1 deficiency , and moreover whether ER a is required . To accomplish this , I first examined C2C12 myoblasts as this line was the most relevant in vitro murine model available to me at the time . Moreover , C2C12 lines have been shown to primarily express extra - nuclear ER a . We ( myself and another student in the laboratory ) administered increasing doses of TAM to undifferentiated myoblasts in accordance with the same experimental workflow as mentioned above . Given that I had found 10 µ M of TAM to be sufficient to induce a significant reduction in DNM2 in human fibroblast lines , we only tested 5 µ M and 10 µ M of TAM in C2C12 myotubes . In this case , given that we were working with only one cell line , each concentration of TAM was tested in triplicate , and therefore one 6 - well plate was used for both 5 µ M and 10 µ M TAM , followed by one 6 - well plate as an experimental control . This experiment was then replicated to validate our findings . 65 Figure 23 . Dose - dependent effects of in vitro tamoxifen treatment on C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes . Representative Western blot for DNM2 in ( a ) C2C12 myoblasts and ( b ) C2C12 myotubes treated with 5 µ M and 10 µ M of TAM , with b - actin loading control ; position of the molecular weight markers indicated ( in kDa ) . ( c , d ) Relative protein levels of DNM2 were determined by densitometry and standardized to b - actin . Graphs represent two experimental replicates and three technical replicates for each concentration and the fold difference from the average of the untreated control ( 0 µ M TAM ) ± SEM . All samples derive from the same experiment . 10 µ M TAM significantly reduced DNM2 levels to 0 . 785 + / - 0 . 061 ( * p = 0 . 0283 ) in myoblasts , and 0 . 52 + / - 0 . 13 ( p = 0 . 0125 ) in myotubes relative to the untreated control . All statistical comparisons were conducted by one - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 Remarkably , we were able to show a similar dose - dependent reduction , with 10 µ M TAM inducing a significant reduction in DNM2 compared to untreated controls ( p = 0 . 0283 ) , and 5 µ M TAM ( p = 0 . 0067 ) ( Figure 23 A , C ) . We then sought to differentiate these lines into myotubes to determine whether this effect can be reproduced . Briefly , C2C12 myoblasts were seeded into 6 - well plates with a confluence of 5x10 5 cells / well and switched to growth media ( DMEM and L - glutamine supplemented with 2 % horse serum ) after reaching 90 % confluence . Fresh growth media was added on a daily basis and differentiated myotubes were harvested at 5 days . C212 myotubes were then treated with both 5 µ M and 10 µ M of TAM for a period of 24 hours using the same methodology as described above . Not surprisingly , 10 µ M of TAM induced a similar , significant reduction in DNM2 ( as seen previously in C2C12 myoblasts ) when compared to untreated controls ( p = 0 . 0125 ) , and 5 µ M TAM ( p = 0 . 0393 ) ( Figure 23 B , D ) . Contrary to myoblasts , myotubes represent a more physiologically relevant in vitro model within which to address our mechanistic questions , given that myotubes are the multinucleated cells that constitute muscle fibersSimilar to human fibroblasts , we also demonstrated that C2C12 myotubes express both the 66kDa and 55kDa 66 isoforms of ER a ( Figure 24A ) , however the particular isoform that is responsible for the extra - nuclear ER a in C2C12 cells remains unknown . In a study conducted by Milanesi and colleagues , several low molecular weight isoforms ( < 66kDa ) of ER a , in addition to the 55kDa isoform were detected in extra - nuclear protein fractions of C2C12 myotubes 107 . Despite this however , they were unable to determine which isoform corresponded to the perinuclear localization of ER a in C2C12 cells that has been identified by immunofluorescence . In an effort to address this , cell fractionation studies can be performed in both human fibroblast lines and C2C12 myotubes in order to first verify whether these lines also express extra - nuclear ER a ; indeed , this is one in vitro study in which a reliable murine MTM cell line would be beneficial . Figure 24 . ER a expression in C2C12 myoblasts and HEK293T cells . Representative Western blot for ER a in ( a ) C2C12 myotubes and ( b ) HEK294T cells that were untreated and treated with ( 0 . 1 % ) DMSO . The 55kDa isoform of ER a is highly expressed in C2C12 cells , whereas both the 66kDa and 55kDa isoform of ER a are negligibly expressed in HEK293T cells . Furthermore , the expression of either isoform of ER a is unaffected by the presence of DMSO . To circumvent this limitation , our lab has begun generating a C2C12 Mtm1 KO line using CRISPR / Cas9 whilst primary cultures from Mtm1 KO mice are also being established ; the only caveat however , is that C2C12 cells are of female genotype . In spite of this , should these C2C12 Mtm 1 KO lines faithfully recapitulate the molecular signatures of in vivo MTM models , they can be used for further study in conjunction with primary MTM murine lines once they become available . Should we ultimately identify that this membrane - bound or extra nuclear ER a is also expressed in vitro , cell fractionation studies can then be performed in both fibroblast and C2C12 lines in order to identify the subcellular localization of the 55kDa isoform , and whether this isoform corroborates with extra nuclear ER a localization . Moreover , it would be of utmost importance to ensure that this 55kDa isoform is the same as the one observed in vivo given that any discrepancies may reflect different characteristics of muscle development in vivo and in vitro , and any abnormalities in muscle development that arise as a consequence of MTM . 67 Lastly , in order to determine whether TAM - induced DNM2 reduction required ER a , we treated HEK293T cells with 5 µ M and 10 µ M of TAM in the same experimental manner as indicated above . HEK293T cells are isolated from human embryonic kidneys and most importantly , do not express estrogen receptors 108 . Interestingly , we demonstrated that neither concentration of TAM was capable of inducing a change in DNM2 levels ( Figure 25 A , B ) . Moreover , we were also able to confirm that HEK29T cells do not express ER a ( Figure 24B ) . In order to further illustrate this dependence on ER a , it would be prudent to both knock - down ER a in C2C12 cells and transfect HEK293T cells with ER a , treating both with TAM . Should we observe the absence of DNm2 reduction in KD C2C12 cells and conversely , a dose - dependent reduction of DNM2 in transfected HEK293T cells following TAM treatment , these experiments would be an elegant proof of principle that convincingly demonstrate that TAM requires the expression of ER a in order to reduce DNM2 in vitro . Figure 25 . Dose - dependent effects of in vitro tamoxifen treatment on HEK293T cells . ( a ) Representative Western blot for DNM2 in HEK294T cells treated with 1 µ M to 10 µ M of TAM , with b - actin loading control ; position of the molecular weight markers indicated ( in kDa ) . ( b ) Relative protein levels of DNM2 were determined by densitometry and standardized to b - actin . Graph represents three replicates and the fold difference from the average of the control ( DMSO ) ± SEM . All samples derive from the same experiment . It is important to note that neither concentration of TAM was able to reduce the levels of DNM2 below the levels of the control . The absence of any effect may be attributed to the fact that HEK293T cells do not endogenously express estrogen receptors . Statistical comparisons were conducted by one - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . Taken together , our findings strongly suggest that TAMs modulatory effect on DNM2 can occur independently of Mtm1 deficiency and outside the context of skeletal muscle . Moreover , this effect does not occur preferentially in one sex , as evidenced by significant DNM2 downregulation in female murine C2C12 lines . By successfully reproducing TAM - induced DNM2 downregulation in vitro , my findings have laid the groundwork for future studies into MTM pathogenesis . Moreover , these studies have propelled the development of a reliable murine MTM cell model to be used in conjunction with human MTM lines to identify the etiology of muscle specific abnormalities that may arise from dysregulation at the cellular level ( i . e . centralized nuclei , triad 68 disorganization ) . Lastly , we are now able to examine novel therapeutic strategies and candidates for MTM in a rapid and high throughput manner . DNM2 modulation can be used as a reliable in vitro outcome measure , and consequently allows us to pilot different therapeutic strategies within a variety of cellular settings before applying them to other in vitro models of MTM . 19 Investigating the mechanism of action of Tamoxifen I sought to examine whether the proteasome is involved in the modulation of DNM2 by TAM by investigating this phenomenon in a well - established human breast carcinoma cell line ( MCF7 ) . My rationale for selecting this line as an appropriate model included the following : 1 ) The molecular interdependence of DNM2 and ER a was recently suggested using MCF7 cells 98 . This line therefore , is appropriate for further investigation of this relation . 2 ) Both MG - 132 and BZ have been extensively tested in MCF7 cells and have been shown to work effectively in specific concentrations 109 . 3 ) Proteasomal modulation has been implicated as an underlying regulator of ER a degradation in MCF7 cells 109 . 4 ) In addition to expressing ER a , MCF7 cells proliferate much faster than both fibroblasts and C2C12 cells and are therefore amenable to a rapid and effective screen . 5 ) If successful , this screen would provide a strong rational for the direct testing of proteasomal inhibitors in human lines . Prior to administering proteasomal inhibitors to this line , I sought to first establish whether MCF7 cells also display a dose - dependent response to TAM treatment . MCF7 cells were generously gifted from our collaborator Dr . Sean Egan at the Hospital for Sick Children . In like manner to the methods described above , I maintained MCF7 cells in culture for approximately 3 to 4 passages following their acquisition and established frozen stocks for further use . Given that their original passage number was not tracked , I harvested this line for use at my fourth passage . Briefly , MCF7 cells were subsequently seeded and plated in 6 - well plates as described above and treated with increasing doses of 500nM , 2uM and 10uM TAM , with each concentration assayed in triplicate . A 6 - well plate of non - treated and DMSO - treated MCF7 cells was used as an experimental control . After a period of 24 hours , I was able to demonstrate that TAM is able to reduce DNM2 in MCF7 cells in a dose - dependent manner , with 10 µ M demonstrating a significant reduction in comparison to 500nM TAM ( p = 0 . 0008 ) and both controls : p = 0 . 016 for DMSO and p = 0 . 0004 for untreated MCF7s ( Figure 26 ) . DNM2 levels were unaffected by DMSO ( Figure 27 ) . In like manner to MTM fibroblasts , I anecdotally observed moderate levels of cell death after 24 hours of TAM treatment . 69 I did not examine the effect of TAM treatment on the growth rate of MCF7 cells , therefore it is not possible to assert whether TAM was acting to repress cell growth , or whether the observed cell death was a by - product of drug toxicity . Figure 26 . Dose - dependent effect of TAM on DNM2 expression in MCF7 cells .

All samples on each blot derive from the same experiment with multiple blots run in parallel . ( c ) Relative protein levels of DNM2 , determined by densitometry , standardized to b - actin and represented as the fold difference from the average of DMSO - treated control . Graph represents two separate experiments and 5 - 14 technical replicates ± SEM . DNM2 levels are significantly decreased following treatment with 10 µM TAM when compared to 500 nM TAM ( p = 0 . 0008 ) and DMSO - treated controls ( p = 0 . 016 ) . It is important to note that DNM2 expression is significantly downregulated in 10 µM compared to untreated controls ( p = 0 . 0004 ) . Statistical analyses were conducted by one - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 Following the success of this initial screen , I treated MCF7 cells ( at an equivalent passage ) with proteasomal inhibitors in the presence and absence of 10 µM TAM . In a study conducted by Powers et al , it was determined that in vitro administration of 10 µM MG - 132 and 30nM BZ is sufficient to inhibit 95 % of the activity of the proteasome in MCF7 cells . This inhibition was further evidenced by the near complete proteasomal inhibition and significant accumulation of ER a in lysates of MCF7 cells treated with 10 µM MG - 132 or 30nM BZ , in comparison to untreated controls 109 . These concentrations further correspond with the fact that BZ ( IC 50 = 6 . 8nM in MCF7 ) is more specific than MG - 132 in its inhibitory activity of b - subunits within the 20S proteolytic core 105 , 109 . For this reason , I chose to treat MCF7 cells with both MG - 132 and BZ at their respective concentrations . Briefly , MCF7 cells were harvested and seeded in 6 - well plates with a density of 1 . 5x10 5 cells / well in 2mL of media . After 24 hours in culture , I added 2µL of a 4mM working 70 solution of MG - 132 and 2µL of a 30mM working solution of BZ directly to each well in order to reach a final concentration of 10µM and 30nM , respectively . Cells were pre - treated with either inhibitor for a period of 30 minutes at 37 ° C before treatment with 10µM TAM . My rationale for pre - treating these cells arose from the same study conducted by Powers et al , where 30 minutes of incubation with 10 µM MG - 132 or 30nM BZ was sufficient to induce near complete inhibition of the proteasome 109 . After 30 minutes , I directly added 2µL of my 4mM working solution of TAM ( made as previously described ) to the appropriate wells . Each inhibitor was tested in triplicate in both the presence and absence of TAM . One 6 - well plate of untreated MCF7 cells and MCF7 - cells treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO was used as an experimental control . Figure 27 . DNM2 expression in MCF7 cells remains unchanged in the presence of DMSO . Representative western blot for DNM2 in untreated and MCF7 cells treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO . Molecular weight indicated in kDa ; all samples derive from the same experiment . It is important to note that DMSO treatment alone does not affect protein levels of DNM2 . It can therefore be asserted that changes in DNM2 expression following TAM - treatment are genuine and are not a consequence of DMSO administration . Interestingly , I observed that when administered alone , both 10 µM MG - 132 and 30nM BZ was sufficient to induce a significant accumulation of DNM2 in comparison to DMSO - treated controls ( p = 0 . 026 ) ( Figure 28 A , B ) . Remarkably however , 10 µM TAM was not able to reduce DNM2 levels when administered in the presence of either proteasomal inhibitor . Consequently , DNM2 levels remained significantly increased in lysates treated with 10 µM TAM + 10 µM MG - 132 and 10 µM TAM + 30nM BZ when compared to cells treated with 10 µM TAM alone ( p = 0 . 01 and p = 0 . 001 , respectively ) ( Figure 28 A , B ) . This suggests that TAMs modulatory effect of DNM2 depends on the proper function of the proteasome , given that a reduction in DNM2 is not observed when the proteasome is inhibited . For the first time , my findings provide support towards the existence of a potential molecular interplay between the UPS and TAM - dependent DNM2 reduction within the context of MTM . It is unknown however , whether this mechanism of regulation is specific to DNM2 , or whether it is also responsible for the in vivo TAM - dependent reduction of ER a that I have also observed . 71 Figure 28 .

DNM2 levels are significantly decreased following treatment with 10 µM TAM ( p = 0 . 026 ) . 30nM of BZ ( p = 0 . 0001 ) and 10 µM of MG132 ( p = 0 . 0001 ) significantly increased DNM2 levels in comparison to MCF7 cells treated with 10 µM TAM . Interestingly , 10 µM TAM was no longer able to reduce DNM2 levels when administered in conjunction with either proteasomal inhibitor . Statistical analyses were conducted by one - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post - test . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . Estradiol and ER a - mediated activation of the UPS is a primary means through which ER a levels are regulated in accordance with extracellular levels of estrogen . This negative regulatory feedback mechanism occurs regularly within the cell and is required for proper ER a signalling 76 , 77 , 110 . In light of my previous observations that both TAM and 17 b - estradiol significantly reduce ER a protein levels in vivo without altering its mRNA levels in Mtm1 KO mice and their TAM - treated littermates , it is therefore possible that TAM functions to regulate both ER a and DNM2 through modulation of the UPS . By performing this same in vitro experiment to then examine the levels of ER a would help to clarify whether this is true . This approach is further supported by my observation that MCF7 cells also express both the 66kDa and 55kDa isoform of ER a ( Figure 29 ) . In this way , I would be able to investigate whether TAM and / or each proteasomal inhibitors are functioning to modulate specific isoforms of ER a and specifically , the 55kDa isoform that I have shown to be significantly enriched in the skeletal muscle of Mtm1 KO mice . 72 Figure 29 . Expression of ER a in MCF7 and NmUMG cell lines . Representative western blot for ER a in untreated MCF7 cell and NmUMG cells . NmUMG cells are murine breast carcinoma cells . Molecular weight indicated in kDa ; all samples derive from the same experiment . It is important to note that both human and murine breast carcinoma lines express the 66kDa and 55kDa isoforms of ER a ( indicated by two arrows ) , in addition to several other splice forms . In a similar vein , a fellow graduate student also treated C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes with 10µM TAM in the presence of either MG - 132 or BZ to determine whether my findings in MCF7 cells could be replicated in an in vitro murine model . Unfortunately , these studies resulted in an inconsistent response for C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes in which MG - 132 and BZ were administered alone , and in combination with 10 µM TAM . Anecdotally , another graduate colleague and I observed that DNM2 levels were not changed in one human MTM fibroblast line ( MTM1A ) when treated with only 10 µM MG - 132 or 30nM BZ . Although this preliminary result strongly supports the possibility that proteasomal dysfunction is not necessarily responsible for the DNM2 accumulation we observe in both in vivo and in vitro MTM models , a more insightful experiment would require treating all human MTM fibroblast lines with both proteasomal inhibitor and 10µM TAM . Should we similarly observe that TAM is unable to downregulate DNM2 when the proteasome is inhibited , it would provide another strong line of evidence for TAM as a modulator of the UPS . Moreover , given that baseline levels of DNM2 are significantly increased in untreated MTM fibroblasts , it is particularly important to note that should treatment with proteasomal inhibitor alone further increase the expression of DNM2 , it does not necessarily imply that the proteasome is dysfunctional in MTM , nor that TAM is acting to restore its function as a therapeutic mechanism . The exact mechanism by which TAM functions to modulate the UPS would require further experimentation and targeted approaches that help to elucidate the exact binding partners of TAM within the context of MTM in vivo and in vitro . For example , drug 73 affinity responsive stability ( DARTS ) 111 , is one such technique that would help to identify novel binding partners of TAM within the context of MTM . This technique takes advantage of the proteolytic protection conferred onto proteins that are bound to their small - molecule target . Should TAM preferentially bind to components of the proteasome and / or ubiquitin ligases , these complexes would be protected from proteolytic degradation and can subsequently be resolved by SDS - PAGE and further identified using mass - spectrometry . When analyzed in conjunction with the level of proteasomal activity within skeletal muscle of both Mtm1 KO mice and their TAM - treated littermates , insights gleaned from these studies can clarify whether TAM promotes protein turnover by modulating the activity of the proteasome , or by regulating ubiquitination to effectively shuttle misfolded and / or aggregated proteins to the UPS . 74 Chapter 5 Discussion The overarching premise of my graduate work was to generate preclinical evidence in support of the use of TAM as a novel and effective therapy for MTM . Despite the devastating consequences of this pediatric disorder , no clinically approved therapies are currently available 2 , 14 , 19 . Furthermore , despite several gene and enzyme replacement strategies currently at the forefront of therapeutic development 49 , 50 , TAM is the only FDA - approved drug undergoing preclinical investigation . Coupled with the severe and rapidly progressive nature of this disorder , the significant cost and investment of time associated with both the development and administration of novel therapeutic approaches , necessitates the discovery of alternative therapies that are both cost - effective and am enable to immediate clinical translation . Therefore , the goals of my research project represent an attempt to address an unmet therapeutic demand within the field of rare disease . TAM was identified as a potential therapeutic for MTM during our investigation of PIK3C2B modulation as a novel and clinically effective drug - targetable pathway . As an experimental control for the Cre - lox mediated temporal and muscle - specific KO of Pik3c2b in Mtm1 KO mice , Mtm1 KO mice underwent short - term administration of TAM 42 . Unexpectedly , we observed a modest shift in the baseline survival of TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice . Further investigation resulted in remarkable improvements in the survival and hallmark histopathological and functional abnormalities of the murine model . Given the serendipitous nature of this discovery , the primary focus of my research project was to identify the mechanisms through which TAM was functioning to ameliorate the hallmark pathologies of the disease . In light of a similar study conducted by Dorchies et al , TAM was shown to induce remarkable muscular improvements in the mdx model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) 72 . It is therefore possible that TAM is functioning to modulate a global mechanism that is involved in maintaining the overall structure and function of skeletal muscle . In support of this , Dorchies and colleagues suggest that TAM mimics estrogens in dystrophic muscle . TAM has the potential to act estrogenically in a variety of tissues and can consequently induce molecular signatures that are reminiscent of the positive and protective effects of estrogens . Consequently , I conducted a series of molecular and genomic investigations to address whether TAM was functioning in line with its well - established function as a selective modulator of the ER in a murine model of MTM . Most notably , I have shown that TAM works to 75 ameliorate the phenotype of Mtm1 KO mice through a primarily ER - dependent pathway , as evidenced an improvement in muscular pathology in the presence of 17 b - estradiol , and the antagonism of these effects by fulvestrant . Furthermore , I have demonstrated that this ER - dependent action is likely a consequence of an extra - nuclear ER a signalling pathway . In support of this , my observations of our RNA sequencing data indicate that TAM does not act transcriptionally to ameliorate MTM pathology . To my knowledge , this is the first study of its kind to demonstrate a non - transcriptional function of TAM in skeletal muscle . Lastly , I identified a membrane - associated form of ER a that is significantly enriched in the tibialis anterior of Mtm1 KO mice , and was subsequently downregulated with TAM . This discovery is particularly important given that Dorchies and colleagues were unsuccessful in the immunofluorescent labelling of ER a murine muscle tissue 72 . Consequently , my findings build a framework within which more work can be done to identify the exact subcellular localization of this extra - nuclear ER a , and determine whether its enrichment in MTM is a consequence of unique molecular domains or post - translational modifications . ER a palmitoylation has been shown to enhance its targeting to the plasma membrane and implicate the receptor in the activation of several non - genomic signalling pathways 80 , 82 , 87 . This is of important functional relevance to my graduate work given that I hypothesize that TAM exerts its therapeutic benefit in MTM through a ER - dependent mechanism that is independent of its well - established transcriptional function . Moreover , clarifying the identity of this membrane - bound ER a , and whether TAM binds preferentially to this isoform in MTM , has immense potential to uncover the factors underlying the development of the hallmark muscular pathologies of this devastating disease , and other CNMs . My initial stage of molecular characterization has advanced the field in many ways . For the first time I have shown the enrichment of both a membrane - bound ER a and protein isoform of the receptor in male myopathic muscle . Moreover , I was able to demonstrate that TAM normalizes both of these anomalies . This significant discovery therefore , could possibly explain the unexpected sensitivity of Mtm1 KO mice to TAM . Given that this short isoform is poorly addressed within the literature , should additional investigation be made to distinguish its molecular structure , my findings lend further support towards uncovering its potential biological significance , specifically within male skeletal muscle and more compellingly , in the pathophysiology of MTM . There are two well characterized truncated splice variants of ER a , ER a 46 and ER a 36 , that are aptly named by virtue of their molecular weights . Both ER a 46 and ER a 36 lack domains that are 76 found in the normal 66kDa protein ( ER a 66 ) 81 , 112 , 113 . ER a 46 lacks the AF - 1 transactivation domain , which despite having minimal influence on non - genomic signalling , does allow ER a 46 to activate eNOS more efficiently than ER a 66 113 . Similarly , lacking both the AF - 1 and AF - 2 transactivation domains , ER a 36 more effectively activates the MAPK pathway and mobilizes intracellular calcium in the presence of 17 b - estradiol 112 . Interestingly , both splice variants also preferentially undergo palmitoylation , and are therefore more frequently localized to the plasma membrane 112 , 113 . It is therefore possible that this short protein isoform of ER a lacks a particular domain that can in a similar way , influence its subcellular localization and not surprisingly , the pathway ( s ) through which it signals . An immediate functional consequence of this is an effect on downstream molecular effectors that may or may not be involved in the maintenance of skeletal muscle . Furthermore , should TAM act through the preferential binding of this isoform in MTM , the observed downstream molecular signature ( s ) would also be different . A further extension of this , is my analysis of our RNA sequencing study . To my knowledge , this is the first comprehensive RNA sequencing study conducted in Mtm1 KO mice to date and consequently , has several important implications . Foremost , this data provides the first complete repertoire of genes that are differentially expressed in the Mtm1 KO mouse compared to controls . Once made available to the public , it will become a reliable data set to which other large or sequencing data sets can be compared , and from which important genetic insights can be gleaned . Secondly , it was through the success of this study that I was able to substantiate TAMs non - transcriptional mechanism of action in MTM . Moreover , the success of this pilot RNA sequencing study has prompted a larger sequencing initiative by our lab that explores all affected muscles in Mtm1 KO mice . In an effort to identify whether unique genetic signatures underlie the degree of histopathological severity in different muscle groups , this study has immense potential to help answer important pathomechanistic questions , namely why muscle groups are affected with varying severity in MTM . Doing so can help uncover more genetic factors that upon further molecular investigation , can be found to potentiate or work in concert with MTM1 to drive the muscle - specific pathologies we observe . This information can then be translated in vitro and in vivo through a series of genetic and proteomic approaches to ultimately paint a better picture of how CNM - associated genes and their interactors drive the pathology of the disease . In like manner , a comparative RNA sequencing study can shed insight into the genetic factors that underlie poorly understood muscle pathologies , namely the mechanisms driving nuclear centralization in MTM . Should this comparative sequencing approach be taken in TAM treated mice , it would provide 77 useful insight into whether TAM is working through the modulation of different genes in specific muscles , or by way of a non - transcriptional mechanism overall . Similarly , our lab has also conducted a pilot epigenetic study of genome - wide methylation in Mtm1 KO mice . When analyzed in conjunction with the RNA sequencing data , findings from this study can help to inform us 1 ) whether genes of interest ( i . e . BIN1 , DNM2 , ESR1 ) are differentially methylated in Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls , and 2 ) whether this methylation status corresponds with expression data from the RNA sequencing study . Should association be true , it could provide a possible explanation for why drugs like TAM do not transcriptionally affect genes of interest in CNM . On the contrary , it is possible that TAM is transcriptionally modulating genes that are not of obvious interest to us . Our RNA sequencing study revealed 29 genes that are changed with TAM treatment . Should these genes possess a differential methylation pattern in Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls , this could be informative of whether TAM is working to modulate their expression through epigenetic modification , or by way of a mechanism that is irrespective of methylation status . In this way , the epigenome of Mtm1 KO mice can unravel novel contributors of disease . Lastly , should differential methylation patterns underlie the expression of CNM - associated genes and their interactors , it holds promise for further investigation into epigenetic modification as a novel therapeutic strategy for MTM . Given that MTM is a muscle disorder , it is not immediately obvious that estrogens can play a role in the pathology of the disease , or moreover act as a drug - targetable factor with significant therapeutic benefit in such a devastating disease . In keeping with the fact that the study of ER signalling in skeletal muscle is limited , my findings both break new ground and fill gaps in the literature , whilst building a foundation upon which further , more comprehensive mechanistic questions can be asked . In light of the novel insights gained from the transcriptome analyses , I next investigated the likelihood that TAM acts by way of the non - transcriptional modulation of novel molecular factors , or proteins of interest . I was open to this possibility given that TAM has been implicated in both the modulation of the proteasome and activation of non - genomic signalling pathways . Given that both Dnm2 and Pik3c2b have been identified as novel genetic modifiers of Mtm1 26 , 42 , I sought to investigate whether TAM modulates the expression and / or function of these two proteins . Remarkably , my preliminary characterizations revealed for the first time , that both high and low 78 doses of TAM significantly reduced the protein expression of DNM2 in Mtm1 KO mice back to wild - type levels , with no effect on transcription . Likewise , I successfully showed that TAM downregulates DNM2 in a dose dependent manner in control and MTM human fibroblasts . Not only did this elegantly show that DNM2 modulation by TAM occurs outside the context of skeletal muscle , but also further validates the clinical feasibility and translatability of this drug . Demonstrating that TAM is able to downregulate DNM2 in a human model provides tremendous support towards the feasibility of a clinical trial for MTM patients . Furthermore , in conjunction with a series of other in vitro experiments in three other mammalian cell lines , I was able to demonstrate that the effect of TAM on DNM2 levels occurred irrespectively of Mtm1 deficiency and was dependent on the expression of ER a , an observation that was further substantiated by the downregulation of DNM2 by 17 b - estradiol in vivo . Interestingly , DNM2 has been shown to be required for ER a signalling and degradation . The molecular interplay between DNM2 and ER a will require further investigation within the context of MTM and will become an attractive avenue to pursue as we further explore the role of estrogens as a modulator of MTM pathology . Moreover , determining whether ER a accumulation in MTM occurs secondarily to the dysregulation and accumulation of DNM2 , or whether the two proteins are downregulated simultaneously , will help us further understand the stages of disease development . Given that TAM appears to be changing the expression of several proteins to the exclusion of a transcriptional signature , I hypothesized that TAM was acting to modulate protein stability and / or degradation by way of a global pathway that is involved in the regulation of many proteins . By performing a preliminary in vitro drug screen with two common proteasome inhibitors , I was able to demonstrate that TAM was unable to downregulate DNM2 when the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) was inhibited . Although this is not the first time that protein aggregation has been implicated in the pathology of MTM 9 , 25 , it is for the first time that a potential therapeutic has been shown to potentially work may work by accelerating proteasomal degradation . Moreover , this mechanism is in keeping with the role of TAM as a modulator of the proteasome 78 , 102 , 103 , and parsimonious with its effect on protein expression to the exclusion of a transcriptional signature . Whether this proteasomal effect also underlies TAMs downregulation of ER a requires further investigation . Furthermore , whether the proteasomal degradation of DNM2 is solely responsible for the phenotypic improvements we observe , also merits further evaluation . 79 Of significant importance was my demonstration that DNM2 downregulation was accomplished through a mechanism that was independent of PIK3C2B inhibition , as evidenced by the fact that TAM did not alter the levels of PIK3C2B and PI3P in vivo . Moreover , PIK3C2B kinase activity and signalling was also unchanged . Consequently , my novel findings assert that DNM2 downregulation is the primary mechanism through which TAM improves the pathology of MTM , as the pathological improvements I have observed are superimposable to those arising from DNM2 downregulation through genetic strategies 26 , 44 , 45 , 51 . Given that DNM2 upregulation is a primary pathogenic mechanism in ADCNM , my findings present the attractive possibility that TAM can be explored as a therapeutic for ADCNM , and other CNMs with similar molecular signatures . Moreover , the identification of a small - molecule that modulates protein degradation presents us with the opportunity to learn more about how MTM1 , DNM2 and other CNM - associated proteins function together in the development MTM in vivo and in vitro . Taken together , these novel findings support a post - translational mechanism for TAMs therapeutic benefit in MTM and have significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie triad biogenesis and maintenance in skeletal muscle . Further exploration into the use of TAM in the treatment of diseases other than ER + breast cancer , and more specifically other muscle disorders , constitutes another promising outcome that is worth substantiating . While the preclinical data presented herein supports a novel ER - dependent and non - transcriptional function of TAM in MTM , it is possible that TAM may also work independently of the ER as a consequence of its physiological dose . For this reason , future work should focus on investigating why triad structure and function is only improved with high dose TAM , despite the fact that both low - dose TAM and 17 b - estradiol were able to downregulate DNM2 and ER a . One way to test this would be adopt a dosing strategy for 17 b - estradiol to determine whether a higher dose would improve triad structures . Should this be unsuccessful , it would indicate that some muscular abnormalities in MTM may be driven by multiple mechanisms and therefore necessitates the need to develop a combinatorial therapeutic approach . Moreover , in light of the known role of TAMs dose - dependent function in a variety of biological contexts , it is possible that the effectors to which TAM binds also differ based on dose . Therefore , identifying the binding partners of TAM in both low and high dose treated muscle can uncover the molecular steps that underlie DNM2 downregulation , and most importantly , whether these steps differ between each dose and drug . Additionally , identifying the characteristics of this dose - dependent effect can provide insight into 80 the cause versus effect relationship between several muscle pathologies , namely central nuclei and muscle weakness in MTM . Fortunately , our discovery of TAM as a novel therapeutic candidate for MTM , coupled with a novel and promising mechanism of action has propelled forward the therapeutic arena of MTM , and has successfully addressed a therapeutic need within the rare diseases community . I have identified the first small - molecule therapeutic for MTM and provided sufficient preclinical evidence for its immediate transition into clinical trials for MTM patients . Given that TAM is at present , the only FDA approved compound that is under preclinical investigation , my findings hold immense potential to propel its advancement within the clinical arena . Second , my molecular analyses suggest a novel molecular role for TAM in skeletal muscle and presents the potential for its therapeutic use in other muscle diseases with similar molecular profiles . Lastly , the success of my graduate work has built a foundation upon which further investigation can be done to better understand the mechanisms of ER signalling in skeletal muscle and most importantly , its novel role in the pathophysiology of MTM , and other devastating muscle disorders . 81 Chapter 6 Future Directions Despite the significant advances that have been made in our understanding of MTM , there are still many important pathomechanistic questions that remain to be answered . This therefore , often complicates our identification of novel therapies and effective therapeutic targets . Fortunately , our serendipitous discovery of TAM as a novel therapeutic candidate for MTM has shed tremendous insight into the post - translational regulation of DNM2 as a mitigator of disease pathology . Despite this however , there has yet to be a systematic investigation into how defects in MTM1 , DNM2 and the other CNM - associated gene products result in such deleterious and muscle - specific abnormalities . A further extension of the work presented herein would be to discern the exact molecular mechanisms that underlie TAMs post - translational modulation of DNM2 . Although we have strong reason to believe that TAM is acting as a modulator of the proteasome in MTM , the exact manner by which it accomplishes this task is unknown . For this reason , I propose to substantiate TAMs functional association with the proteasome through the identification of novel binding partners of TAM and DNM2 in MTM , followed by a comprehensive analysis of DNM2s repertoire of post - translational modifications . In this way , we can assert whether TAM interacts directly with the proteasome to potentiate its function or does so by way of a primary association with DNM2 . Consequently , this will also provide us with a better understanding of how DNM2 dysregulation leads to pathology within the context of MTM and uncover any novel interactions with MTM1 and BIN1 within the context of its cellular role in skeletal muscle , which is incompletely understood at present . Finally , I propose to take advantage of TAMs therapeutic benefit in MTM to further explore how Mtm1 and other CNM - associated genes function in muscle and when dysregulated , result in deleterious muscle - specific phenotypes . This provides an excellent preclinical model in which to uncover novel molecular players that can not only help to explain the exact mechanisms underlying DNM2 modulation within the context of MTM , but also act as biomarkers that provide an alternative solution for the obstacles most often encountered when trying to make genotype - phenotype correlations in CNM and moreover , the limitations of differentiating CNM subtypes at the time of diagnosis . Most notably , should these factors be disease - specific , easily quantifiable 82 and minimally invasive , our findings would provide sufficient evidence to warrant their use for the diagnosis of CNM patients who exhibit significant clinical overlap and / or mutations that are difficult to discern with traditional sequencing approaches . Moreover , should any of these biomarkers be amenable to therapeutic intervention , be it by TAM or another therapeutic strategy in development , our findings have uncovered yet another targetable factor that can be of benefit to MTM patients as an effective indicator of disease prognosis and therapeutic efficiency . 20 Aim 1 : Further Explore the Role of Tamoxifen as a Post - Translational Modulator of DNM2 . Based on the information presented above , I hypothesize that the regulation of DNM2 is a primary function of MTM and that DNM2 expression is a key to the MTM pathogenesis and the therapeutic function of TAM . For this reason , I am particularly interested in determining the precise mechanisms of action that underlie TAMs post - translational modulation of DNM2 as a secondary line of investigation . Although I have shown that this modulation is associated with the proper functioning of the proteasome , the exact sequence of events by which TAM is acting in order to instigate this action is unknown . It is possible that TAM is functioning through direct binding of proteasomal components to then modulate the levels of DNM2 and other molecular regulators , or by way of direct binding to DNM2 and / or its post - translational modifications , which could then scaffold TAM to the proteasome . Moreover , TAMs interaction with the proteasomal components may also be mediated by way of novel interactions between DNM2 and other effectors . Uncovering the existence of novel protein - protein interactions in MTM can help us determine how DNM2 accumulation and dysfunction leads to a muscle specific phenotype . This information is particularly important to the field because there has been no known interaction reported between DNM2 and MTM1 to date ; the supposed interaction of DNM2 and BIN1 remains speculative . To identify novel potential muscle - specific targets of TAM , I will perform Drug - Affinity Responsive Therapy ( DARTS ) 111 , an unbiased technique that takes advantage of the principle that drug - protein complexes are protected from proteolytic digestion . The success of this technique highly depends on the identification of an effective small - molecule . I will perform this technique in vivo using protein extracts from WT and Mtm1 KO mice and in vitro using MTM human fibroblasts and Mtm1 KO C212 cells ( under development ) , with appropriate controls . Briefly , protein extracts will be incubated with TAM and subject to digestion with a protease . Treated 83 lysates will then be resolved by SDS - PAGE . “Protected” bands appearing in only TAM - treated samples will be excised and submitted for mass spectrometric analysis for identification . In the event that band isolation is non - specific , I plan to try resolving treated lysates by Western blot and probing with antibodies against proteins of interest ( i . e . DNM2 ) . In light of the increased popularity of this approach and its recent success in identifying IQGAP1 and myosin heavy - chain 9 as novel protein targets of Disulfiram 111 , I expect that this technique can be employed effectively in vivo and in vitro to identify novel targets of TAM within the context of MTM . In controls I expect to see ER a as a target of TAM . Furthermore , should ER a be identified as a target in MTM samples , we will be able to determine whether this is in fact the shorter protein isoform of the receptor . Should ER a not be identified in either circumstance , it would lend further support towards a non - genomic and non - transcriptional of TAM within the context of skeletal muscle and MTM . Protein interactors identified using DARTS will then be verified by direct interaction studies . Moreover , should we find DNM2 as a novel protein target of TAM , similar interaction studies ( i . e . DNM2 immunoprecipitation ) can be done to identify any secondary or downstream interactors . Should an interaction between TAM and compartments of the proteasome exist , I will further characterize the functional consequences of this interaction by first measuring proteasomal activity in vivo and in vitro . It is possible however , that proteasomal activity is not necessarily dysregulated in Mtm1 KO mice or cell lines compared to controls . Should this be true , it may be that TAM is functioning to increase basal proteasomal activity in MTM or moreover , functioning to promote the targeting and / or shuttling of proteins to the proteasome by increasing ubiquitination . This outcome would also be likely should no proteasomal proteins be found as targets of TAM via DARTS . In this case , it may be that TAM modulates protein degradation by binding to E3 ubiquitin ligases or influencing their transcription . Interestingly , the expression of two common E3 ubiquitin ligases Fbxo32 and Trim63 is significantly increased in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice compared to KOs alone . Moreover , it can be appreciated that we do not observe any changes in the expression of either ligase in Mtm1 KOs compared to controls ( Figure 30 ) . This finding is particularly important because it indicates that TAM may be having a specific effect on these genes . It would be prudent to also look at the expression levels of their gene products in order to substantiate this claim . Despite both of these genes being implicated in muscular atrophy , it is possible that they are upregulated in the presence of TAM in order to accelerate the degradation of specific proteins . This specialized recruitment may also be mediated in part , through the MTM1 - UBQLN2 complex 84 that has been recently implicated as a mediator of protein degradation within skeletal muscle . I plan to address this by measuring the levels of ubiquitinated DNM2 and other proteins of interest . Figure 30 . Skeletal muscle specific expression of Fbxo32 and Trim63 . Graphs depicting the relative mRNA levels of Fbxo32 and Trim63 of in animals treated with high - dose TAM . Box plots represent n = 4 mice per group and the average expression relative to WT . Fbxo32 and Trim63 are both significantly increased in TAM - treated Mtm1 KO mice compared to controls , p = 0 . 0098 and p = 0 . 021 , respectively . Moreover , there expression remains unchanged between Mtm1 KO mice and controls . Error bars indicate ± SEM . It is also possible that DNM2 is not ubiquitinated , but instead is subject to other post - translational modifications such as : acetylation , phosphorylation and / or SUMOylation . In this case , I will also look at the effects of TAM on mediating these post - translational modifications and whether their existence is associated with increased degradation or turnover of DNM2 . Using cyclohexamide - chase analyses , I plan to additionally investigate whether the stability of DNM2 is perturbed in the presence of TAM and is consequently preferentially targeted for proteasomal degradation . This assay will allow me to discriminate between the relative effects of translation and proteolysis on protein levels and moreover , the specific effects of TAM on DNM2 stability and degradation kinetics . Taken together , the strategies presented herein constitute a comprehensive investigation into the mechanisms underlying both the mechanism of action of TAM and those underlying MTM pathogenesis . For example , these studies will provide novel insight into the role of MTM1 as a regulator of protein trafficking within the cell and moreover , how the dysregulation of such a ubiquitously functioning protein and its interactors ( i . e . DNM2 ) can result in devastating muscle - specific phenotypes . If successful , these strategies will ultimately have the potential to advance the 85 diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of MTM and moreover , to influence the way in which we approach the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the field of neuromuscular disease . 86 References 1 .

The Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics ( TCP ) Animal Care Committee reviewed and approved all procedures conducted on animals at TCP . Mice were maintained under proper environmental regulations : temperature and light cycles , unlimited access to water , appropriate food supply , and clean enclosures . Pups were weaned from their mothers according to standard protocols , and tails were clipped for genotyping . All experimentation done using this mouse line , as well as all mouse husbandry , routine care , and euthanasia , is performed through international guidelines and IACUC approved protocols held at the University of Toronto and TCP . Generation and Genotyping of MTM mouse strains Mtm1 knockout mice with targeted deletion of exon 4 of Mtm1 by homologous recombination were a generous gift from Dr . Anna Buj - Bello and generated as previously described 39 . Mice were maintained on the C57 / BL6J background and were backcrossed every 3 - 4 generations to prevent genetic drift . Genotyping of mice - tail biopsies was performed by PCR on DNA isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy DNA isolation kit ( Qiagen , Germany ) , as per manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , tails were digested overnight at 55°C in digestion buffer . DNA was then precipitated using 100 % ethanol and purified through a series of wash steps as per kit instructions . Exon 4 deletion in Mtm1 was subsequently detected by genomic PCR using the following primers P4 : 5’ - AATGTGTGCATGTTTGGAC - 3’ and P5 : 5’ - ACAGTGATGCACAGAGAGGA - 3’ . Genomic PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 25 ml , using 10 pmol of each primer , 5 ml of buffer ( 7 . 5 mM MgCl2 / 50 mM KCl / 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 3 / 200 mM dNTPs ) , and 1 unit of Taq polymerase ( Qiagen ) . The cycling conditions for genomic PCR were as follows : 94°C , 5 min ; 35 cycles at 94°C , 10 s , 54°C , 30 s , and 72°C , 2 min ; 72°C , 7 min using the Veriti Thermal Cycler PCR machine ( Applied Biosystems ) . Drug Treatments All drug treatments in this study were conducted from 21 days of age until 36 days of age or until animals reached end point ( defined as lack of movement , significant weight loss , or hindlimb paralysis ) . Body weight and food consumption were monitored three times weekly . Tamoxifen - citrate mixture at 40 mg / kg ( high - dose ) or 3 mg / kg ( low - dose ) was incorporated to the standard rodent diet premixed with ~ 5 % sucrose as a palatability enhancer ( Harlan Laboratories Teklad Diets ) . 17 - β Estradiol ( E2 , Sigma Aldrich ) was given at 1 . 0 μ g / mouse / day dissolved in 0 . 1 % DMSO administered by subcutaneous injections , once daily excluding weekends . Fulvestrant ( ICI 182 780 , SigmaAldrich ) was given at 1 mg / kg dissolved in Miglyol 812 ( OmyaPeralta GmbH ) administered by subcutaneous injection , once daily excluding weekends . Age - matched litter control WT and Mtm1 KO males were injected with a corresponding solution of 0 . 1 % DMSO or Miglyol . Drug and placebo administration was performed in a genotype - blind fashion based on the animal ID number . Immunofluorescence Muscle tissue from tibialis anterior ( TA ) was dissected and mounted into small balsawood pieces previously frozen with drops of optimal cutting temperature compound ( Tissue - Tek ; ThermoFisher ) . Mounted muscle tissues were then flash frozen in isopentane at – 55°C . 8 - μ m 93 cross sections of flash frozen TA muscle were cut and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides ( ThermoFisher ) using a Leica cryostat ( Leica Microsystems ) at - 20°C . For immunofluorescence , mounted TA sections were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature and blocked for 30 minutes in blocking buffer ( 1 % Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) solution , 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin , 10 % goat serum , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( pH 7 . 9 ) . Slides were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies against estrogen receptor alpha ( ER a , 1 : 100 ; SC - 7207 , Santa Cruz ) in blocking buffer . Secondary antibody ( anti - rabbit Alexa Flour ® 555 1 : 1000 , Life Technologies ) was applied for 1 hour at room temperature the following day . Slides were washed several times with wash buffer ( 1 % TBS solution , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) to remove excess secondary antibody and then mounted with VECTASHIELD with 4 ʹ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Vectorlabs ) . Micrographs were captured with an Infinity1 camera ( Lumenera Corporation ) at 60X magnification with eponymous software visualized through an Olympus BX43 light microscope ( Olympus ) . Tissue Extraction Total protein lysates were extracted from quadriceps ( skeletal ) muscle of Mtm1 KO and TAM treated mice , in addition to their age - matched littermate controls at 36 days of age . Quadriceps muscle was snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 ° C until processing . The muscle was minced and homogenized for 3 minutes using the TissueLyserII ( Qiagen , Germany ) in 1X cell lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Lysates were chilled at 4 ° C for 10 minutes , then centrifuged at 12 , 000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 ° C . Supernatants were collected , and protein concentration determined using the Pierce™ BCA protein assay kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Extracts were diluted with 4X reducing Laemmli buffer before immunoblotting . Immunoblotting Quadriceps protein lysates ( 60ug / lane ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE , and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes , according to standard procedures . Equal loading and transfer efficiency were verified by Ponceau S Red ( Sigma ) staining . Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 1X TBST ( 20 mmol / L Tris - base , 150 mmol / L NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 7 . 5 ) containing 5 % skim milk powder and 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , and incubated overnight with primary antibody . Primary antibodies used were : ER a ( 1 : 500 , MC - 20 , Santa Cruz ; 1 : 1000 [ E115 ] Abcam ab32063 ) , ER b ( 1 : 750 , Abcam ) , PIK3C2B ( 1 : 1000 , BD Biosciences ) , DNM2 ( 1 : 500 Clone 2862 , Dr . Jocelyn Laporte , IGBMC France ) , DNM2 ( 1 : 1000 G - 4 , Santa Cruz ) , b - actin ( 1 : 5000 , Cell Signaling ; Abcam ab8226 ) and HSP90 ( Clone OTI4C10 , Origene ) . After extensive washing in 1X TBST , membranes were incubated for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse IgG secondary antibody ( 1 : 5000 , BioRad ) in 1X TBST containing 5 % skim milk powder and 3 % BSA . Densitometry analysis Blots were imaged by chemiluminescence ( Clarity Max™ ECL , BioRad ) using the Gel Doc™ XR + Gel Documentation System ( BioRad ) , and band signal intensities determined using ImageLab software ( BioRad ) . All densitometry values are individually standardized to corresponding values of total b - actin or HSP90 for each probe and expressed as the fold difference from the average of the WT group of each blot . For each murine drug trial , all samples derived from the same experiment and Western blots for each probe were processed in parallel . For tamoxifen cellular drug trials , all samples derived from the same experiment and the samples were run in triplicate , with the exception of the HEK293T , human fibroblast lines where two to three 94 separate blots were run in parallel . For the MG - 132 and Bortezomib cellular drug trials , all samples derived from the same experiment and multiple blots were run in parallel . Quantitative Real Time PCR Total RNA was isolated from quadriceps muscle using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol , and 500 ng ( concentration determined by nanodrop ) was reverse - transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit ( BioRad ) . Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) for DNM2 was performed using TaqMan Ô Probe assay kits ( ABI ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol , and mRNA levels were normalized to actin as the invariant housekeeping gene . qRT - PCR for ER a was performed using SYBR Green ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , and mRNA levels were normalized to levels of the TATA box - binding protein ( TBP ) as the invariant housekeeping gene . All reactions were conducted using the Applied Biosystems StepOne Real - Time PCR System ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Primers used were : 5 ʹ - TGCGCAAGTGTTACGAAGTG - 3 ʹ ( ER a forward ) , 5 ʹ - TTTCGGCCTTCCAAGTCATC - 3 ʹ ( ER a reverse ) , 5’ - TGCTGCAGTCATCATGAG - 3’ ( TBP forward ) , 5’ - CTTGCTGCTAGTCTGGATTG - 3’ ( TBP reverse ) . The primers used for qRT - PCR were designed in regions that are not affected by alternative splicing from the sequences published under the NCBI Accession numbers NM _ 007956 . 4 ( mouse ER a ) , and NM _ 013684 . 3 ( mouse TATA box - binding protein ) . mRNA levels were analyzed using the 2 ∆∆ CT method as previously described ( Schmittgen , T . , Livak . , K . , Nature Protocols 2008 ) . In order to validate miRNA expression levels in quadriceps of Mtm1 KO and TAM - treated Mtm1 KO animals , the mir Vana Ô miRNA isolation kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) was used ( in accordance with the manufactuer’s protocol ) to isolate miRNAs from 500ng total RNA isolated as mentioned above . miRNAs were isolated in a step - by - step PCR procedure using the mir Vana Ô miRNA isolation kit according to protocol . qRT - PCR for miR - 133a and miR - 486 was performed using Taqman Ô Advanced miRNA Assays ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , and levels were normalized to for miR - 191 ( housekeeping miRNA ) . Gene Mapping and differential expression analysis Read sets from each of the 14 samples across the four conditions were aligned to the reference genome ( GRCm38 / MM10 version of the Mus musculus genome ) and transcriptome using STAR ( Dobin et al . Bioinformatics 2013 PMID : 23104886 ) two - step alignment to generate a Binary Alignment Map file ( BAM file ) . Coordinate sorted BAM files were used to quantify transcript abundance ( count data ) using HTSeq ( Anders et al . Bioinformatics 2014 , PMID : 25260700 ) . Raw read counts generated were used as input for differential gene expression analysis , carried out using both DESeq ( Anders and Huber 2010 ) and edgeR ( Robinson , McCarthy , and Smyth 2010 ) R / Bioconductor packages . This was carried out in a pair - wise manner between any two conditions that were considered . FDR adjusted p - values from both edgeR and DESeq was used to determine genes that are significantly differentially expressed between the conditions tested . Finally , we used the GoSeq R / Bioconductor package ( Young MD , et al Genome Biology , 11 , pp . R14 ) to identify pathways that were significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes between any two conditions . 95 Use of Human Cell Cultures Human fibroblast lines were obtained from Coriell or " in house " via our Research Ethics Board ( REB ) approved protocol ( REB # 1000009004 ) . Cell samples were anonymized after generation ( with protected code held by PI ) and given the label of WT or MTM . Cell culture and in - vitro drug experiments MCF - 7 cells ( gift from Dr . Sean Egan , Hospital for Sick Children ) were cultured and maintained in media containing DMEM and L - glutamine supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 100units / mL of penicillin and 100 μ g / mL of streptomycin . Human fibroblast lines were maintained in media containing DMEM and L - glutamine supplemented with 20 % FBS . C2C12 myoblasts and HEK293T cells ( ATCC , Virginia , USA ) were maintained in media containing DMEM and L - glutamine supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 100units / mL of penicillin and 100 μ g / mL of streptomycin . For differentiation to C2C12 myotubes , C2C12 myoblasts at were seeded into 6 - well plates with a confluence of 5x10 5 cells / ml . Cells were allowed to reach 90 % confluence with 10 % FBS before switching to growth media of DMEM and L - glutamine supplemented with 2 % horse serum . Fresh media was added daily for 5 days . Cell culture reagents were from Gibco / Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated . 24 hours prior to the tamoxifen experiments , cells were transferred to 6 well plates at a confluence of 1 . 5x10 5 cells / ml . After 24 hours , cells were treated with vehicle ( 0 . 1 % DMSO ) or increasing doses of 4H - Tamoxifen ( Cayman Chemicals ) ranging from 500nM to 20µM for 24 hours . C2C12 cells and HEK293T were seeded into 6 well plates at 2 . 5 X 10 6 cells / ml and 5 X 10 6 cells / well respectively , 24 hours prior to tamoxifen treatment . Similarly , one day prior to proteasome inhibitor treatments , MCF - 7 cells were seeded into 6 well plates at a confluence of 1 . 5x10 5 cells / well . After 24 hours , cells were pre - treated for 30 minutes with proteasome inhibitors 10µM MG132 ( Cayman Chemicals ) or 30nM Bortezomib ( Cayman Chemicals ) , followed by vehicle ( 0 . 1 % DMSO ) or 10 µM 4H - Tamoxifen for 24 hours . Human fibroblast lines ( f4 , f5 , f7 and mtm1d ) were acquired at the Hospital for Sick Children ; mtm1a and mtm1b were purchased from the Corriel Institute ( Camden , New Jersey ) .
