Introduction Most forms of life require iron for growth and survival , because it is involved in many cellular metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions ( oxygen transport , electron transport , DNA synthesis , etc . ) . Iron does not normally exist in a free form in animals , but excess iron can catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into free radicals , via the Fenton reaction [ 1 , 2 ] . This can damage the cellular structure and finally kill the cell [ 3 , 4 ] . The toxic effect of iron is avoided under normal circumstances through mechanisms that minimize free iron in the body . Any iron not incorporated as a functional moiety of proteins is bound to transport or storage proteins in a nontoxic ferric ( Fe 3 + ) form [ 5 ] . The iron - complexing agents serve to solubilize iron in the media surrounding the living organism , transport it within the animal and deliver it to the cells . Iron exists as a heme complex in heme proteins ( hemoglobin , myoglobin , cytochromes ) or as a nonheme protein compounds ( transferrin , ferritin and hemosiderin ) to be transported as a redox - inactive form [ 1 ] . The nonheme ferritin and hemosiderin are mostly involved in iron storage , whereas transferrin is an iron transport protein that binds to iron atom , thus making it unavailable for catalysis of superoxide radical formation . Transferrin is a single monomeric glycoprotein of molecular weight of 80 kDa , approximately 700 amino acids in length that transports iron involved in many metabolic processes amongst the sites of absorption [ 6 ] , storage and utilization , hence considered as the major iron binding protein in the plasma of vertebrate species . It is an iron - binding protein which reversibly binds iron and can create low - iron conditions and which restricts the growth of some pathogenic bacteria [ 7 ] . Members of transferrin group of proteins are evolutionarily related and include transferrin from serum ( serotransferrin ) , ovotransferrin ( conalbumin ) from egg white , lactoferrin from milk , tears and leucocytes , and the membrane - bond , tumour - associated melanotransferrin [ 8 ] . 2 . Transferrin structure Trasnferrin consists of a single polypeptide chain of about 700 amino acid residues organized into the C and N lobes , each consisting of two domains to which iron is coordinated [ 9 - 11 ] . The globular lobes are connected by a short helical section . Iron - free transferrin , or apotransferrin , reacts with iron to produce a complex . Each molecule of transferrin with its two specific iron binding sites is capable of binding two atoms of iron and two bicarbonate ions . The bicarbonate ions facilitate a stable interaction between Fe 3 + ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT Transferrin is a single monomeric glycoprotein of molecular weight of 80 kDa that transports iron involved in many metabolic processes amongst the sites of absorption , storage and utilization , hence considered as the major iron binding protein in the plasma of vertebrate species . In this study , transferrin structure , synthesis , receptor and the mechanism of cellular uptake of iron from transferrin have been reviewed . Besides , the major biological functions of transferrin and the different forms of it ( polymorphisms ) have been indicated .

According to Welch [ 13 ] , 42 % of the amino acids in the N - terminal domain have identical counterparts in the C - terminal domain . 3 . Transferrin synthesis Transferrin is mainly synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma [ 8 ] . Significant expression of transferrin gene has also been found in other tissues including the brain , testes , ovary , spleen , mammary gland and kidney [ 14 - 16 ] . The synthesis of transferrin by some of these non - hepatic tissues may be important in those situations where cells are separated by blood barriers from the transferrin in plasma [ 13 ] . Under normal conditions , most of the iron in the blood plasma is bound to transferrin . 4 . Transferrin receptor ( transferrin R ) Cells take up iron bound to transferrin using transferrin R , thus , the biological function of the specific receptors is to bind transferrin on the cell surface and ingests it [ 11 ] . The transferrin R , which is expressed in all nucleated cells in the body , assists iron uptake into vertebrate cells through a cycle of endo and exocytosis of transferrin [ 17 ] . The transferrin R has been found in red blood cells , thyroid cells , hepatocytes , intestinal cells , monocytes , brain , the blood - brain barrier and also some insects and certain bacteria [ 18 , 19 ] , and has a higher affinity to diferric transferrin than apotransferrin , and different transferrin R may have very different affinities to transferrin [ 20 ] . Two types of transferrin R , transferrin R1 and transferrin R2 , are known with Transferrin 1 being the widely expressed and the best - characterized of the two receptors . Transferrin R1 is a homodimeric membrane glycoprotein of molecular mass ~ 190 000 Da that binds two molecules of transferrin in a pH dependent manner and allows delivery of iron into cells [ 21 ] . According to Chen et al . [ 22 ] , the zinc - transferrin complex interacts with the transferrin R and stimulates the proliferation of immature red blood cells in the head kidney of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) . In malignant cells , there are elevated levels of transferrin R expression attributed to the requirement of high level of iron for their growth [ 23 ] . Besides , transferrin R is also reported to be involved in immune response against bacterial infection [ 24 ] . 5 . Cellular uptake of iron from transferrin The cellular uptake of transferrin - bound iron occurs by means of transferrin - specific cell membrane receptor protein . Iron - loaded transferrin binds to the transferrin R on the cell surface , and via coated pits and coated vesicles , the transferrin - TR complex becomes trapped within endosomes . Through the action of a proton - pumping ATPase of the endosomal membrane , the vesicle lumen is rapidly acidified ( pH 5 – 5 . 5 ) . Low pH of the endosome facilitates iron mobilization from transferrin , and the iron is transported across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol . At the pH of the endosomal lumen , the apotransferrin formed binds tightly to the transferrin R . The apotransferrin - transferrin R complex is sorted into exocytic vesicles , hence escaping lysosomal degradation . The exocytic vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane , and the apotransferrin - transferrin R complex is exposed to the extracellular PH . At this pH , the apotransferrin has a very low affinity for the transferrin R , hence apotransferrin dissociates from the receptor leaving it ready for another cycle of transferrin binding and endo - / exo - cytosis [ 8 , 25 ] . Generally , almost all serum iron are bound to transferrin . Iron - loaded transferrin ( diferric transferrin ) binds to the transferrin R on cell surface and the complexes are endocytosed through clathrin - dependent pathway . When pH decreases during the endosome maturation , the ferric iron dissociates from the Transferrin and the rest of the complex returns to plasma membrane . Once exposed to the neutral pH at cell surface , apotransferrin and transferrin R dissociate and are ready for another round of iron uptake [ 26 ] . In studying the functional plasticity of transferrins from four air - breathing channids ( Genus , Channa : Channidae ) and its relevance to their survival , Jabeen et al . concluded that transferrinin retains iron in exceptionally high amounts at acidic pH [ 27 ] . Securing free iron at low pH should be imperative if respiratory acidosis occurs , since under low oxygen free iron ( as Fe 3 + ) precipitates even at physiological pH . 6 . Biological functions of transferrin 6 . 1 . Transferrin as transporter of iron and metal ions The level of free iron in body fluids is controlled by transferrin , which can bind , sequester and transport Fe 3 + ions in maintaining the availability of iron and preventing the deposition of insoluble ferric hydroxide aggregates . The main function of transferrin is to transport iron from the liver , intestine and reticuloendothelial cells to tissues requiring iron for normal growth and development . It is also involved in immune defense mainly via its ability to bind to iron ( III ) ions [ 28 , 29 ] . According to Sun et al . [ 20 ] , transferrin is likely to be involved in transportation of a wide range of metal ions other than iron , such as therapeutic metal ions , radio diagnostic metal ions and some toxic metal ions . Since the metal binding sites of transferrin are occupied by iron only for approximately 30 % , other metals can be bound without requiring the displacement of the more tightly bound iron in the absence of high concentrations of serum albumin . Transferrin has been postulated to play a significant role in transporting Ti 4 + , VO 2 + ( V 4 + ) , Cr 3 + , Ru 3 + and Bi 3 + , all metal ions of potential therapeutic significance . Transferrin may possess a physiological role in the transport of manganese , as the trivalent ion . However , the protein may also play a role in carrying potentially toxic Al 3 + and actinide ions , including Pu 4 + , to the tissues [ 30 ] . De Smet et al . reported that transferrin of common carp has been recognized as the major protein for the transport of metals other than iron , such as cadmium [ 31 ] . In the same way , the increase of serum transferrin levels in Nile tilapia [ Oreochromis niloticus ( O . niloticus ) ] as a result of exposure periods to cadmium / zinc suggest the use of transferrin as biomarker parameter of heavy metal toxicity in fish [ 32 ] . In demonstrating the ability of a major carp seminal plasma protein - transferrin to bind cadmium ions and to neutralize the toxic effect of cadmium on carp sperm motility , Dietrich et al . reported that transferrin from carp seminal plasma can protect sperm motility from cadmium toxicity [ 33 ] . 6 . 2 . Transferrin as antimicrobial agent By acting as a high affinity iron binding protein , transferrin has the potential of being an effective antimicrobial agent . The association of transferrin with the immune system derives from its ability to restrict serum free - iron levels , creating low - iron environments where Berhan Asmamaw / Journal of Coastal Life Medicine 2016 ; 4 ( 3 ) : 176 - 180 178 the infection capacity of pathogenic microorganisms is limited [ 34 , 35 ] . Humoral innate immunity is mediated by soluble factors that inhibit microorganism growth [ 36 ] . However , in inflammation conditions , transferrin is known to act mostly as a negative acute phase protein [ 37 ] . Ovotransferrin and lactoferrin may also have antimicrobial activity , which apparently depends on actual contact with the bacteria rather than simple iron deprivation [ 38 ] . Transferrin is a multi - function protein with a central role in iron metabolism and it is the function that is associated with a role in the innate immune system response . The clear link between transferrin and immune defense mechanism leads to propose transferrin as a candidate gene for disease resistance [ 39 ] . Liu et al . reported significantly up - regulated transferrin expression in cat fish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) after infection with Edwardsiella ictaluri , the causative agent of enteric septicemia [ 40 ] . Kovacevic et al . studied the expression of genes encoding the acute phase proteins during the course of Trypanosoma carassii infection in the goldfish ( Carassius auratus L . ) using quantitative PCR and concluded that transferrin was up - regulated throughout the acute course of infection in the liver , and in the kidney during the chronic phase of the infection [ 41 ] . Poochai et al . indicated that transferrin expression in tilapia experimentally infected with Streptococcus agalactiae was significantly upregulated and iron - deficiency in serum of bacterially infected fish was detected clearly indicating the function of transferrin in innate immunity [ 42 ] . Increased levels of transferrin expression were observed following bacterial infections in rainbow trout [ 37 ] . An increase in transferrin gene expression was seen in blood and spleen leukocytes of cod following an intra - peritoneal injection of heat - killed bacteria [ 43 , 44 ] . After infection with Vibrio harveyi , serum transferrin gene expression of the Chinese black sleeper ( Bostrichthys sinensis ) was found to increase mainly in the liver and stomach , acting as a positive acute protein , suggesting that serum transferrin is involved in the immune response [ 45 ] . In studying the transferrin gene expression in response to lipopolysaccharide challenge and heavy metal exposure in roughskin sculpin ( Trachidermus fasciatus ) , Liu et al . reported that in the main immune organs ( skin , blood and spleen ) , transferrin m RNA expression was up - regulated significantly suggesting that transferrin is involved in the innate immune response of roughskin sculpin [ 46 ] . Transferrin expression was up - regulated in the gill of orange - spotted grouper during exposure to Cryptocaryon irritans which suggested most of the expressed transferrin to be used by the host to produce a greater NO response that plays a major role in host resistance to parasite infection [ 47 ] . After a constitutive expression of transferrin in head kidney and spleen , an up - regulation following acute phase induction was demonstrated [ 48 ] . Ercan et al . investigated the transferrin gene expression of sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) during an experimental infection with Vibrio anguillarum and reported an increased transferrin gene expression during the first 2 days [ 49 ] . An up - regulation of transferrin gene expression has also been demonstrated in channel catfish and sea bass following bacterial infection [ 2 , 50 ] . Specific functional regions of the transferrin protein seem to be undergone positive natural selection in salmonids and goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) , showing a possible relationship between transferrin and resistance to pathogens in fish [ 51 , 52 ] . 6 . 3 . Transferrin as fish macrophages activator Macrophages are found across all vertebrate species , reside in virtually all animal tissues , and play critical roles in host protection and homeostasis . As resident cells in virtually all tissues , macrophages aid in maintaining homeostatic environments , and upon infection , are typically one of the first cell types to encounter intruding pathogens , where they orchestrate appropriate immune responses [ 53 ] . Transferrin plays a role as a primary activator of fish macrophages . The activation of fish macrophages by transferrin cleavage products may represent a primitive but highly conserved pathway for the induction of NO in lower vertebrates [ 54 ] . According to Stafford and Belosevic [ 55 ] , in goldfish , transferrin cleavage products could act as a macrophage activator factor by stimulating macrophages to produce large amounts of NO . The same result was reported in carp blood transferrin , whereby immunostimulatory fragments of carp transferrin induce a NO response in carp macrophage . Activated macrophages were also indicated to be the source of necessary enzymes required for cleavage transferrin into immunostimulatory fragments [ 56 ] . Cysteine proteinases of Trypanoplasma borreli can also produce immunostimulatory fragments of carp transferrin [ 57 ] . Transferrin - derived synthetic peptide induces highly conserved pro - inflammatory responses of macrophages [ 58 ] . In coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) with the C allele of transferrin , increasing resistance against bacterial kidney disease has been reported [ 34 ] . Generally , as an acute - phase protein in fish , the concentration of transferrin indicates the condition of infection or stress , though its rise or fall varies with the infective microorganisms or injury in different tissues [ 2 , 40 ] . Transferrin is also involved in many biological functions , such as DNA synthesis , oxygen and electron transport , growth , differentiation and cytoprotection processes [ 8 , 13 , 55 , 59 - 61 ] . Relatively recent data uncovered an additional role of transferrin as an upstream regulator of hepcidin , a liver - derived peptide hormone that controls systemic iron traffic [ 62 ] . 7 . Transferrin polymorphisms Transferrin has a high degree of genetic poly¬morphism in all species [ 63 ] . A number of transferrin variants have been identified and characterized in many different species . Gene duplication , gene loss and horizontal transfer contributed to the diversification of transferrin family members [ 29 ] . Transferrin variants have been reported in different fish species . Yang et al . studied transferrin polymorphisms in goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) and identified three transferrin variants ( A1 , A2 and B1 ) in which substantial amount of amino acid variation was observed between variant A1 and B1 [ 64 ] . By studying the resistance characteristic and c DNA sequence conservation of transferrin from crucian carp , Carassius auratus , Long and Yu demonstrated a polymorphism in which silver carps shared 1 / 3 transferrin alleles with crucian carps [ 65 ] . The transferrin of crucian carps had stronger Fe 3 + - binding ability and transportation ability in plasma than that of sliver carps . Borges et al . studied plasma polymorphisms in scad ( Trachurus trachurus L . ) population of North East Atlantic and identified four allelic variants ( transferrin 10 , transferrin 105 , transferrin 97 and transferrin 94 ) [ 66 ] . Four transferrin polymorphisms ( alleles ) have been identified in coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) and used to discriminate regional groupings of populations [ 67 ] . Natural populations of haddock ( Melanogrammus aeglefinus L . ) had been discriminated by the variation at the blood plasma transferrin molecule that revealed a series of 21 co - dominant alleles [ 68 ] . Using transferrin polymorphs as a biochemical marker , Nabi et al . screened the fresh water fish ( Channa punctatus ) in India and identified six transferrin variants ( AA , BB , CC , AB , AC and BC ) with the corresponding alleles of isoforms designated as transferrin Acp , transferrin Bcp and transferrin Ccp [ 69 ] . According to Jurecka et al . [ 56 ] , 21 polymorphic sites were detected by comparing the c DNA of four different transferrin alleles ( C , D , F and G ) of European common carp ( Cyprinus carpio carpio L . ) [ 70 ] , analysed sequence of transferrin gene in Nile tilapia ( O . niloticus ) and reported a single nucleotide polymorphism that are associated with salt water tolerance in Nile tilapia . Seven ( A , B , D , E , F , H , G ) different transferrin alleles were detected in Hungarian , European and Asian carp populations [ 71 ] . Transferrin c DNA sequence was used as the main tool for the study of the evolutionary relationship Berhan Asmamaw / Journal of Coastal Life Medicine 2016 ; 4 ( 3 ) : 176 - 180 179 and construction of phylogenetic trees in salmonids , where the transferrin c DNA sequence showed a duplicated structure and conserved anion - binding residues , iron - binding residues , and cystein residues for disulfide bridges [ 72 ] . In the same manner , phylogenetic trees based on the genetic distances between deduced amino acid sequences of transferrin from a variety of species have been constructed [ 2 ] . Two distinct Atlantic cod stocks at Faroe Plateau and Faroe Bank were reported based on the frequencies of five cod transferrin alleles [ 73 ] . Jaayid et al . investigated the existence of polymorphisms at transferrin locus in carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) and concluded that there existed seven transferrin genotypes consisting of 4 homozygote types ( CC , DD , FF and GG ) and two heterozygote types ( CD , DG and FG ) [ 74 ] . A relationship between sperm motility parameters and transferrin polymorphism of carp seminal plasma , which may affect sperm competitive ability , has been reported by Wojtczak et al . [ 75 ] . Jurecka et al . indicated the influence of transferrin polymorphism in the resistance of common carp to the blood parasite ( Trypanoplasma borreli ) [ 56 ] . According to Rengmark and Lingaas [ 70 ] , a haplotype of Nile tilapia ( O . niloticus ) that is associated with salt water tolerance was identified in the complete genomic sequence of transferrin and functional studies .
