The inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP and noncompetitive to a phosphate acceptor , histone H2B . By contrast , genistein scarcely inhibited the enzyme activities of serine - and threonine - specific protein kinases such as CAMP - dependent protein ki - nase , phosphorylase kinase , and the Ca2 + / phospholipid - dependent enzyme protein kinase C . When the effect of genistein on the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was examined in cultured A43 1 cells , EGF - stimulated serine , threonine , and tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased . Phosphoamino acid analysis of total cell proteins revealed that genistein inhibited the EGF - stimulated increase in phosphotyrosine level in A431 cells . Tyrosine - specific protein kinase activity is known to be associated with oncogene products of the retroviral src gene family ( 1 - 3 ) . This kinase activity is strongly correlated with the ability of retroviruses to transform cells , since mutants with reduced kinase activity have lower transforming effi - ciency , and mutants which lack tyrosine kinase activity are transformation - defective ( 4 ) . Similar kinase activity is also associated with the cellular receptors for several growth fac - tors such as EGF ' ( 5 ) , platelet - derived growth factor ( 6 , 7 ) , insulin ( 8 , 9 ) , and insulin - like growth factor I ( 10 , 11 ) . There - fore , it is possible that tyrosine pohosphorylation plays an important role for cell proliferation and cell transformation . According to this hypothesis , a specific inhibitor for tyro - sine kinases could be an antitumor agent as well as a tool for * This work is supported by a Grant - in - Aid for Cancer Research from the Ministry of Education , Science , and Culture of Japan .

Although not so specific for tyrosine kinases , several compounds have been reported to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity . A protease inhibitor No - tosyl - L - lysyl chloromethyl ketone was demonstrated to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity associated with pp60 ' . " " and revert the effects of avian sar - coma virus transformation on cell morphology , adhesion , and glucose transport ( 12 ) . A flavone quercetin was reported to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of pp60 " " " ( 13 , 14 ) as well as the activities of CAMP - independent protein kinase ( E ) , the Ca " / phospholipid - dependent enzyme protein kinase C ( 16 ) , phosphorylase kinase ( 17 ) , Na + , K + - ATPase ( 18 ) , and Ca * + , MP - ATPase ( 19 ) . More recently , amiloride , which is well known as an inhibitor for Na + , K + antiporter ( 20 - 22 ) , was shown to directly inhibit growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity ( 23 ) . In the search for specific inhibitors for tyrosine kinases , we have recently isolated an isoflavone compound genistein from fermentation broth of Pseudomonas sp . ( 24 ) . In this study , we show that genistein is a highly specific inhibitor for tyrosine kinases but scarcely inhibits the activity of serine and threo - nine kinases and other ATP analogue - related enzymes in vitro . Furthermore , genistein was revealed to inhibit EGF - stimulated phosphorylation in cultured A431 cells . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND RESULTS ~ DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrated that genistein inhibits the activities of tyrosine - specific protein kinases . Kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition of the EGF receptor kinase activity was competitive with ATP and that genistein leads to the formation of nonproductive enzyme - substrate complexes . Therefore , since Erneux et al . ( 39 ) have proposed that the reaction mechanism of the EGF receptor kinase is a sequential Ordered Bi Bi reaction with a peptide as the first substrate and ATP as the second , genistein could be expected to act uncompetitively with respect to a phosphate acceptor , histone H2B , i . e . genistein could bind to the enzyme only after histone combined ( 40 ) . However , our results indicated that genistein was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to histone H2B . Since genistein bears no structural relationship to ATP , in - hibition of the EGF receptor kinase activity by genistein may * Portions of this paper ( including " Experimental Procedures , " " Results , " Figs . 1 - 4 , and Tables I - V ) are presented in miniprint at the end of this paper .

Thus , it would be possible that genistein binds in multiple places in the reaction pathway and , conse - quently , appears noncompetitive with respect to a phosphate acceptor . In this regard , it is intriguing that quercetin , which has a structure closely related to genistein , has also been reported to be competitive with ATP and noncompetitive with respect to histone ( 14 ) , whereas amiloride , which resem - bles the structures of purines and pyrimidines , is competitive with ATP and uncompetitive with histone ( 23 ) . Genistein exhibited specific inhibitory activity against ty - rosine kinases , that is , the EGF receptor kinase and pp60 " " " and pplloBn ~ " e " kinases , but scarcely inhibited the activity of serine - and threonine - specific kinases such as CAMP - depend - ent protein kinase , protein kinase C , and phosphorylase ki - nase . These results are consistent with the fact that primary amino acid sequences of tyrosine kinases are closely related to each other but weakly homologous with the sequence of the catalytic subunit of CAMP - dependent protein kinase ( 1 ) . Thus , genistein is not a mere ATP analogue , and can discrim - inate the differences in the catalytic site for ATP of these protein kinases . In addition , the activities of 5 ' - nucleotidase and phosphodiesterase were also poorly inhibited by genistein . The property of genistein to specifically inhibit tyrosine ki - nase activity is clearly different from that of a flavone quer - cetin , which has been reported to inhibit not only the tyrosine kinase activity associated with pp60 " " " ( 13 , 14 ) but also the activities of protein kinase C ( 16 ) , phosphorylase kinase ( 17 ) , Na + , K + - ATPase ( 18 ) , and 5 ' - nucleotidase ( Table I , Mini - print ) . High specificity of genistein will be advantageous for utilizing this compound as a tool for elucidating the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells . When the effect of genistein on the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was examined in cultured A431 cells , EGF - stimulated increase of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed to decrease . EGF - induced increase in the level of cellular phosphotyrosine was also inhibited by the treatment of A431 cells with genistein . These results indicate that genistein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor in intact A431 cells . Furthermore , genistein was found to inhibit EGF - stimulated serine and threonine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor . This may result from in uiuo direct inhibition of serine and threonine kinase activity which is responsible for phosphorylation of the EGF receptor . Alternatively , inhi - bition of the EGF receptor - associated tyrosine kinase activity may block a putative cellular pathway regulating serine and threonine kinase activity that phosphorylates the EGF recep - tor . Precise mechanism of this effect is , however , not known at the present time and remains to be determined . Acknowledgments - We are grateful to Dr . T .
