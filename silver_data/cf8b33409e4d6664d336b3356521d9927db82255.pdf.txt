Abstract Background : The Omicron variant has caused a new wave of SARS - CoV - 2 infections worldwide . We explore crucial epidemiological parameters driving seasonal patterns of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in secondary schools and assess various infection control interventions over a 2 . 5 - year time frame . Methods : We developed an agent - based model parameterised with data from secondary schools in the Netherlands . We modelled the circulation of Omicron assuming a stable introduction rate of infections and accounted for uncertainty in epidemiological parameters describing virus transmissibility , susceptibility to reinfection , vaccine immune escape , and waning of sterilising immunity . We quantified the SARS - CoV - 2 health burden defined as number of symptomatic student days . We further evaluated the cost - benefit ( number of prevented infected students per absent student ) for reactive quarantine interventions , regular screening using antigen tests , and annual booster vaccinations . Findings : Durability of sterilising immunity is a key parameter that governs temporal SARS - CoV - 2 transmission patterns in secondary schools . Our model predicts pronounced within - school seasonal patterns with dominant autumn outbreaks and smaller winter outbreaks and a maximum prevalence of 2 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 % - 6 . 6 % ) symptomatic students during infection peaks . Regular screening and annual booster vaccination may reduce the health burden up to 15 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 % - 27 . 8 % ) and have a higher cost - benefit ratio than reactive quarantine interventions ( reduction : 4 . 3 % ; 95 % CI : - 10 . 1 % to 17 . 6 % ) . Interpretation : Immunity waning will determine the intensity and pattern of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in secondary schools in the medium - term future . If mitigation strategies are needed , screening and annual booster vaccination have the highest cost - benefit by reducing viral transmission with little educational disruption . .

However , the emergence of the SARS - CoV - 2 variant Omicron in November 2021 has significantly hampered the progress in controlling the pandemic . The future epidemic trajectory of SARS - CoV - 2 and the need for additional vaccination or temporary re - instalment of mitigation measures remain uncertain . 3 Mathematical modelling studies have proven very useful in exploring possible scenarios for the medium and long - term trajectory of SARS - CoV - 2 and transitioning to an endemic phase at the population level . 4 – 6 Already early in the pandemic , a modelling study informed by data on seasonality , immunity and cross - immunity of human coronaviruses suggested that recurrent wintertime outbreaks would probably occur after the initial pandemic wave . 4 Another study concluded that if SARS - CoV - 2 immunological protection is comparable to that of other seasonal human coronaviruses , SARS - CoV - 2 will cause no more than a common cold - like disease once the endemic phase is reached . 6 Keeling and colleagues simulated the potential impact of the Omicron variant in the UK over three months from January to April 2022 under the assumption of lifting control measures . 7 The authors showed that due to its growth advantage , Omicron can generate high levels of infection that could put a high burden on the healthcare system . While these studies capture potential future dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 at the population level , longer - term dynamics in specific settings such as secondary schools and the associated burden of infections in school children have not been assessed . Modelling studies in school populations thus far mainly focused on estimating within - school reproduction numbers and on short - term predictions of the potential impact of school - based mitigation measures ( e . g . , school closure , regular testing , mask - wearing , room ventilation , cohorting ) during single waves of the pandemic . 8 – 10 Regular screening using rapid antigen tests was found to be efficient in preventing infections while reducing absent student days . 8 , 10 Its effectiveness , however , highly depends on testing adherence and turn - around time . 8 , 9 A modelling study calibrated to Austrian data found that large infection clusters are effectively prevented by a combination of school - based measures only . 9 Many of these within - school mitigation interventions take a substantial toll on students’ well - being and education , while infections rarely result in severe morbidity and mortality . 11 , 12 It , thus , remains crucial to investigate the expected magnitude of future SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools , the accompanying burden of infections on students’ health as well as the impact of school - based interventions on virus circulation and school absence . These projections need to account for .

Our model was parameterised using data from secondary schools in the Netherlands . Starting with the dominance of Omicron in the community at the beginning of 2022 , we investigated how uncertainties in important epidemiological characteristics such as intrinsic transmissibility , susceptibility to reinfection , degree of vaccine immune escape , and immunity waning affect the temporal transmission patterns in a secondary school . We further studied the effectiveness and cost - benefit of reactive quarantine interventions , regular screening using rapid antigen tests , and of an annual booster vaccination campaign . Our analyses highlight the key epidemiological parameters for understanding school transmission dynamics and school - based measures that could be effective in a medium - term future . .

In brief , between January and April 2021 , a representative selection of 45 secondary schools in the Netherlands providing education to 12 - 18 years - old students in grades 1 - 6 adopted a risk - based testing policy . Upon report of an index case , school officials identified all school - based contacts of the index case during the presumed infectious period for at least one teaching hour . These students were offered antigen testing on the same day and a repeat test 3 - 5 days later . Testing was conducted on school premises and performed by a certified test supplier . The invited student and teachers were asked to complete a short questionnaire about COVID - 19 symptoms , recent contacts with known infected subjects and details on the number and type of their school contacts . These data , supplemented with data from literature , served as the main input for our model . A detailed description of the pilot is given in Appendix A . Agent - based model We developed an agent - based model to simulate SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a secondary school informed by data previously described . We provide a model overview and most important model parameters in Figure 1 and Table 1 , and a brief description below . A more detailed description of the model is given in Appendix B . The code for the model can be found on Github . 15 We distinguished two types of individuals : ( 1 ) students , characterised by the grade and class they belong to ; ( 2 ) teachers , characterised by the classes they educate . Based on average values reported in the pilot ( Appendix A ) , the secondary school in our model comprises six grades and 944 students in total . Students attend five subjects per day and teachers educate two to three classes per day , resulting in 72 teachers in our model . Contact network We defined contacts relevant for transmission based on data from the pilot ( Appendix A . 2 ) . Students reported the number of contacts ( defined as conversations at less than 1 . 5 m and for at least 15 min , or physical touch ) with fellow students within the same class and outside their class during and after school hours . Results were summarized into contact matrices in the school environment . We distinguished weekdays ( Monday to Friday ) and weekends ( Saturday and Sunday ) , and divided the day into three periods of eight hours each , distinguished by the types of contacts : 1 . School hours : Students and teachers have within - school contacts described by the respective contact matrices ( Appendix B ) . .

Outside school hours : Students are assumed to have two school - related contacts during their leisure time activities . These contacts are randomly sampled from their within - school contacts . Teachers are assumed to have no contacts with other teachers after school hours . Transmission risks caused by school - unrelated contacts are modelled by a constant introduction rate of infected students and teachers ( Appendix B ) . 3 . Night hours : Neither students nor teachers are assumed to have any contacts during this time . Transmission characteristics Individuals may be either susceptible , vaccinated , symptomatically infected , asymptomatically infected , or recovered . The baseline infectivity is distributed according a Gamma distribution ( mean = 2 . 2 days ) based on results specific for Omicron 16 and the assumed basic reproduction number . Symptomatically infected individuals are assumed to develop symptoms according to a Weibull - distributed incubation period ( mean = 2 . 7 days ) . The infectivity per contact is assumed to be on average 50 % lower for asymptomatic than for symptomatic individuals , 17 and additionally 15 % lower for students when compared to teachers . 18 Susceptible individuals may become infected upon direct contact according to the contact network described above but also indirectly through aerosol transmission in a classroom ( Appendix B ) . We assumed age - specific susceptibility to infection based on estimates from studies on the wild - type virus ( Table 1 ) . 19 Prior infection We assumed that 35 % of students and 30 % of teachers were infected prior to the study period . 20 Each of those infected individuals is assigned an infection time according to SARS - CoV - 2 incidence data from the Netherlands . 21 Vaccination We used a vaccination coverage of 60 % for students and 80 % for teachers , and assigned vaccination times according to data from the Netherlands . 22 Vaccinated teachers are assumed to have received one booster dose while no booster doses were assumed for students . Vaccine efficacies in reducing susceptibility to infection are based on estimates reported for the Delta variant scaled by a factor , representing a lower efficacy for the Omicron variant ( Table 1 in Keeling and colleagues ) . 7 , 23 We assumed no direct effect of vaccination on infectivity but rather that it reduces the probability of developing a symptomatic infection , thereby indirectly lowering infectivity . .

Sterilising immunity wanes exponentially with an average waning time of nine months as estimated by Townsend and colleagues . 24 In our baseline scenario , we assumed that individuals return to 75 % of their original susceptibility value , representing residual protection from previous infection or vaccination . At each reinfection , the probability of a symptomatic infection is assumed to be reduced by 20 % in line with reported decrease of COVID - related symptoms after reinfection . 25 Simulation scenarios Simulations were performed over a course of 30 months assuming a start date of 3 rd January 2022 . We explored the effect of variation of several parameters on the transmission dynamics and on the percentage of students who are ( symptomatically ) infected , susceptible , and absent due to isolation and ( if applicable ) quarantine for each week of the study period . We show the mean and 95 % uncertainty intervals ( 95 % CI ) . We defined the health burden on students as the number of symptomatic student days . Since annual booster vaccinations only starts after 1 st September 2022 , we computed the health burden for the intervention scenarios from that date . As a cost - benefit measure for intervention scenarios , we computed the number of prevented infections per absent student . Fixed parameters including those for the baseline scenario are given in Table 1 . Parameters that are varied in other scenarios are given in Table 2 . Baseline scenario The baseline scenario assumes a school - related basic reproduction number for Omicron of 2 . 0 during the winter period ( October to March ) and of 1 . 5 during the summer period ( 25 % decrease compared to winter , April to September ) , assuming a 40 % - 60 % increase to estimates from the Delta variant . 8 , 10 We assumed compliance to isolation guidelines for symptomatically infected students of 33 % , 26 i . e . home isolation for seven days upon a positive PCR test , but no other mitigation measures in schools . Reproduction number We distinguished two scenarios to account for the uncertainty in the school - related reproduction number : ( a ) 50 % lower reproduction number in winter ( ! ! " # $ % & = 1 . 0 , ! ' ( ) ) % & = 0 . 75 ) , ( b ) 100 % higher reproduction number in winter ( ! ! " # $ % & = 4 . 0 , ! ' ( ) ) % & = 3 . 0 ) . Susceptibility to reinfection .

Vaccine immune escape We assumed ( a ) 25 % lower and ( b ) 25 % higher average vaccine efficacy in reducing susceptibility to reinfection , reflecting higher and lower immune escape in vaccinated individuals , respectively . Waning of immunity We investigated two alternative average durations of sterilising immunity : ( a ) 3 months and ( b ) 18 months , as opposed to 9 months for the baseline scenario . Intervention : Quarantine of close contacts and classmates Upon a positive test result of a compliant symptomatically infected student , all close contacts and classmates quarantine for ten days . Individuals who have a negative antigen test result on day five after the start of quarantine , may exit quarantine . Assuming an increased case detection in comparison with the baseline scenario , we distinguished ( a ) 50 % and ( b ) 75 % symptomatic case isolation . Intervention : Regular screening A proportion of students will perform an antigen test twice weekly with ( a ) 50 % and ( b ) 75 % adherence to this screening intervention . Intervention : Booster vaccination All fully vaccinated students and teachers are assumed to receive one booster dose annually during summer holidays . The efficacy of booster vaccination in reducing the susceptibility to infection is assumed to be increased by 20 % with respect to the initial efficacy .

A total of 32 secondary schools ( 71 % of participating schools ) reported detailed data on 151 SARS - CoV - 2 index cases , resulting in testing of 3652 contacts . The number of index cases reported per school varied between 0 and 9 per week with corresponding community incidence rates varying between 180 and 300 per 100 , 000 person weeks . Upon the report of each index case , a round of risk - based testing of school contacts was instigated , with one case reported on average per week per school ( varying between 0 and 5 per week ) . Among index cases , 79 . 5 % ( n = 120 ) were students and 20 . 5 % ( n = 31 ) were teachers . The results are summarized in Table 3 . Simulation results Baseline scenario Under our baseline assumptions , we reproduced a large school epidemic after the Christmas holidays at the beginning of 2022 ( Appendix Figure 2 ) , 27 followed by low virus circulation from April till July 2022 . Subsequently , large “autumn waves” ( September till December 2022 / 2023 ) are followed by smaller “winter waves” ( January till April 2023 / 2024 ) and low virus circulation in spring and summer ( April till August 2023 / 2024 , Figure 2A ) . Due to higher reproduction numbers in winter , we observe higher peaks in autumn than in spring and summer . In our model , a maximum of 26 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 14 . 0 % - 35 . 5 % ) of students are infected during the first peak in January 2022 , and 8 % ( 95 % CI : 3 % - 15 % ) of students at the peak of the last autumn wave in 2023 . We expect few symptomatic infections and absenteeism after the initial wave in January 2022 with a peak of 2 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 % - 6 . 6 % ) of students symptomatically infected and 0 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 1 % - 1 . 9 % ) of students absent from school in mid - October 2022 ( Figure 2B - C ) . Reproduction number governs the magnitude and timing of epidemic peaks An increase in the reproduction number expectedly results in higher peaks of the epidemic waves ( Figure 3A ) , with autumn waves reaching their peaks about a month earlier when compared to the baseline scenario . For lower reproduction numbers , there is only one pronounced initial peak and rather low virus circulation subsequently with only about 2 to 3 % of infected students per week . Small impact of susceptibility to reinfection .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 25 , 2022 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2022 . 04 . 21 . 22273952 doi : medRxiv preprint Generally , the impact of susceptibility to reinfection seems to be small . If individuals are fully susceptible to reinfection , the peaks of the outbreaks are not only higher but also the wave occurs earlier in comparison to the baseline scenario ( Figure 3B ) . Similarly , if individuals have a lower susceptibility to reinfection , the peaks of the epidemic waves are lower and also slightly delayed ( Figure 3B ) . Varying vaccine immune escape mainly affects the initial peak A higher virus escape from vaccine - induced immunity leads to a higher initial peak in January 2022 and slightly lower autumn peaks in the next two years . Lower vaccine immune escape causes a smaller initial outbreak but higher peaks in subsequent autumn waves due to the accumulation of susceptible individuals . Durability of sterilising immunity significantly changes infection patterns If immunity to infection wanes very quickly ( on average after three months , Figure 3D ) , one additional pronounced wave can be expected pre - Christmas from the end of November till mid - December in 2022 and 2023 . On the contrary , if immunity wanes slower ( on average after eighteen months , Figure 3D ) , only few infections may be observed after a large initial peak post - Christmas 2021 . Among all simulation scenarios waning of immunity has the largest impact on the transmission dynamics and on the health burden ( Appendix Figure 4 ) . Impact of interventions Quarantining classmates and close contacts in reaction to isolation of symptomatically infected students would have had the highest impact in January 2022 ( Figure 4A ) . Its impact is predicted to be small on subsequent outbreaks with larger effects during autumn waves . However , due to lower population immunity , the winter outbreaks are of similar extent when compared to the baseline scenario . Overall , the reduction in health burden of symptomatic student days is small with a mean reduction of 4 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : - 10 . 1 % to 17 . 6 % ) . The proportion of absent students is hugely increased . The cost - benefit of this intervention is low ( Figure 5B ) throughout the study period with a maximum of 0 . 32 prevented infected students per absent student . Twice weekly screening with 50 % and 75 % adherence , respectively , prevents at most 5 % of infected students ( Figure 4C ) . While the maximum effect is achieved during the initial wave in January 2022 for 75 % adherence , screening is more effective than quarantine interventions in preventing infections in subsequent waves . The mean reduction in health burden is 15 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 % to 27 . 8 % ) . Screening .

Its mean value is stable over time but its variation strongly depends on the time period . Screening with 50 % adherence achieves a maximum of 3 . 4 ( 95 % CI : - 2 . 0 to 9 . 9 ) prevented infected students per absent student in September 2022 . Similarly , annual booster vaccinations are mainly effective in mitigating autumn waves ( Figure 4E ) . Its cost - benefit depends strongly on the time period of the year ( Figure 5B ) , with the highest mean cost - benefit of 2 . 3 ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 8 , 5 . 3 ) in winter 2022 / 23 . Due to waning of immunity , the cost - benefit is low in summer periods . Annual booster vaccinations reduce the health burden for students to a similar extent as screening interventions . Discussion Our analyses show that in the baseline scenario where variant characteristics are kept constant during the whole time period of 2 . 5 years , we expect two distinct epidemic waves during a secondary school year . The highest peaks are expected in autumn due to the accumulation of susceptibles in summer . Peaks are lower in winter than in autumn . This is different to seasonal influenza that usually peaks annually between November and April in the Northern Hemisphere . 28 Our modelling results suggest that future transmission trajectories in secondary schools are governed by the durability of sterilising immunity . If immunity wanes fast , i . e . , on average three months , autumn and winter waves are more pronounced and another wave in spring / summer and one additional peak before the Christmas may be observed . If immunity wanes slow , the number of school - related infections remains low throughout the year . Our results also show that screening has a higher cost - benefit in terms of number of prevented infections per absent student than reactive quarantine interventions . These results agree with previous results by Colosi and colleagues that assessed the impact of interventions in primary and secondary schools over three months . 8 Our analyses further show that the cost - benefit of annual booster vaccinations is similar to screening during winter periods . Due to waning of immunity , their cost - benefit is low in summer . Assuming a similar incidence as in October 2021 in the Netherlands , we would expect few symptomatic infections among students even in winter . Hence , interventions might not be needed to reduce the health burden in secondary schools . However , surges in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the general population may require school - based interventions to mitigate the spread . Our analyses imply that regular screening and annual booster campaigns can help slowing transmissions in schools with little disruption of the education of students . Qualitatively , our results concur with data from the Netherlands where a large outbreak after the Christmas holidays was reported in adolescents aged 10 to 19 years in 2022 . 27 Our results also agree .

We parameterised our model using data on school characteristics and contact structure in secondary schools in the Netherlands , and accounted for uncertainty in important epidemiological characteristics of the Omicron variant . Nevertheless , we made several simplifying assumptions in our model . The interpretation of our results has , therefore , limitations . We assumed no further introduction of new variants with substantially different epidemiological characteristics . The timing of such introductions and respective epidemiological characteristics are highly uncertain . Projections on how new variants of concern would impact ongoing transmission dynamics are , therefore , more relevant and feasible on a shorter time scale . Since community incidence on a longer time horizon is difficult to predict , we , further , assumed a constant infection risk for students and teachers from the community throughout the study period . The extent of outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in schools will depend on the infection risk students and teachers are exposed to outside the school setting . In our model , 33 % of symptomatically infected individuals would adhere to self - isolation . These values might vary across different schools and countries , and may impact the predictions on absenteeism and infection prevalence . Finally , in our main analysis , we assumed that vaccine efficacy reducing susceptibility to infection increased by 20 % for booster vaccinations . While previous studies have shown an increase in vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease after booster vaccinations against Omicron , 7 there is no similar data on efficacy against infection , yet . We performed various sensitivity analyses and showed that our general conclusions remained unaffected . In conclusion , our results highlight that future transmission trajectories in secondary schools highly depend on the epidemiological characteristics of the circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variant . We expect that annual school outbreaks will be dominant in autumn , followed by a smaller winter outbreak . Knowledge about how long immunity against reinfection of SARS - CoV - 2 will last in school populations will be decisive for the need of mitigation measures in secondary schools . Of the studied interventions , regular screening or annual booster vaccinations have the most favourable cost - benefit ratio . .
