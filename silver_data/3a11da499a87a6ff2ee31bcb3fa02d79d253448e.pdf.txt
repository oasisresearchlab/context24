Signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of actin - based motility at a macroscopic level by using biomimetic systems in vitro [ 4 – 6 ] . Here , we com - bined such a system with evanescent wave microscopy to visualize Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin network formation at single - actin - ﬁlament resolution . We found that actin ﬁla - ments that we call ‘‘primers’’ determine the origin of the auto - catalytic and propagative formation of the actin network . In the presence of capping protein , multiple ‘‘primers’’ gen - erate independent networks that merge around the object to form an outer ‘‘shell’’ made of entangled and capped ﬁla - ments . Simultaneously , newly created ﬁlaments on the surface of the particle initiate mechanical stress , which develops until symmetry breaking . Our results and exten - sive modeling support that the stress , which releases into propulsive forces [ 7 ] , is controlled not by any speciﬁc orien - tation of actin ﬁlaments toward the nucleation sites but only by new monomers added near the load surface . Results and Discussion Experimental Design We used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) to study the dynamic formation of Arp2 / 3 complex branched actin networks in real time at single - actin - ﬁlament resolution . We followed actin assembly around 10 – 40 m m glass rods coated with pWA , the C - terminal region of WASP / Scar protein [ 8 ] that initiates actin polymerization in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex and G - actin . The initial steps of actin assembly and the network extension around the particles were characterized with Alexa 488 - labeled G - actin [ 9 ] . Addi - tionally , the use of photosensitive Alexa 532 - labeled actin allowed us to track individual actin ﬁlaments during the poly - merization within such a dense and branched actin network . Therefore , we were able to monitor in real time the sustained and autocatalytic branch formation , which continuously prop - agates along the particle surface . Actin Filament ‘‘Primers’’ Are Necessary to Initiate Arp2 / 3 Complex - Mediated Actin Polymerization around the NPF - Coated Particle As a ﬁrst step , and because nonmuscle cells maintain unpoly - merized actin at concentrations as high as 100 – 300 m M , we used a proﬁlin - G - actin buffered medium containing a minimal set of puriﬁed actin - binding proteins to reconstitute sustained actin - based motility of nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) - coated beads and glass rods . The recorded velocities were 8 – 33 nm / s ( Figures 1A and 1B ; see also Movies S1A and S1B available online ) . In these conditions where the actin monomer pool is bound to proﬁlin , actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex elongate strictly at free barbed ends . Although this macroscopic reconstitution under physiological conditions was an important step toward identifying the nature of the minimal set of puriﬁed proteins essential to generate actin - based motility , most of the molecular mechanisms involved in building the actin ﬁlament meshwork remain to be established . Using evanescent wave microscopy , we observed speciﬁ - cally the elementary molecular reactions that control actin dynamics leading to symmetry breaking and motility at a microscopic level and addressed the central role of heterodi - meric capping protein ( CP ; the muscle isoform is also called CapZ ) in these processes . We ﬁrst investigated how assembly of actin ﬁlaments at the surface of NPF - coated particles is initi - ated . We discovered that NPF - coated particles only induced autocatalytic actin assembly after an initial contact with a drift - ing actin ﬁlament in the medium ( Figure 1C , red and green arrowheads ; Movie S1C ) or with an actin ﬁlament emanating from an adjacent branched network ( Figure S1A ; Movie S1D ) , which is consistent with biochemical measurements [ 8 ] . Accordingly , the time to ﬁrst contact between the NPF - coated particles and a drifting actin ﬁlament decreases as a function of the density of ‘‘primers’’ in solution ( Figure 1D ) . The obser - vation of this activation by a drifting ‘‘primer’’ responsible for the initiation of protruding actin networks was buried because of the high concentration of actin ﬁlaments present in the media of reconstituted systems used previously [ 2 – 5 ] . More - over , the long functionalized rods allowed us to observe that several actin ﬁlament ‘‘primers’’ were required to achieve the rapid and overall spread of an actin - branched network around the particle ( Figure 1C ) . We found that the actin - branched network often drifted around the NPF - coated glass ﬁber , con - tacted the rod , initiated branches , and ﬁnally detached , so the interactions of ﬁlaments with the nucleation sites on the ﬁber were transient ( Figure 1E ; Movie S2A ) ; this was consistent with biochemical measurements of rapid dissociation of VCA from Arp2 / 3 complex [ 10 ] .

Whereas previous stud - ies described actin incorporation sites around motile particles by static labeling of the branched actin network or by speckle micros - copy [ 12 , 13 ] , here we monitored actin ﬁlament network formation in real time at single - actin - ﬁlament resolution and obtained a chronological description of the elementary events that lead to actin - based motility . We found that the actin - branched network elongated with all barbed ends growing away from the NPF - coated glass rod ( Figure 1F ; Movie S2B ; see also Figure S1B for modeling ) , subsequent to the stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex branching activity on actin ﬁlaments growing along the NPF - coated rod ( Figure 1G ; Movie S2C ) . Current Biology Vol 20 No 5 424 Capping Protein Shortens the Growth of Actin Filament ‘‘Primers’’ and Creates Independent Networks around the NPF - Coated Particle We investigated the role of CP in the architecture of a growing Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin network prior to symmetry breaking . CP was identiﬁed as one of three actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) that precisely choreograph actin polymeriza - tion and organization to generate ‘‘comet tail’’ motility in vitro [ 3 ] . Heterodimeric CP binds with high afﬁnity ( 0 . 1 nM ) to ﬁla - ment barbed ends and prevents subunit loss or addition . First , we followed Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branch formation in solution ( Figure 2A ) to quantify the kinetic formation of a dendritic ﬁlament network ( Figure 2B ; Figure S1C ) .

Error bars represent the standard deviation of the radii measured for each CP concentration . Scale bars in ( A ) and ( D ) represent 5 m m . ( See also Figure S1 . ) average ﬁlament length ( Figure S1C ) . As a con - sequence , the average distance between two branching points on a mother branch was nega - tively correlated with increasing CP concentration as a result of less available actin ﬁlament length to host the nucleation of new branches ( Figure 2C ) . Second , when NPFs were located on beads or glass rods , increasing the concentration of CP reduced the radius of the actin network assem - bled around the particle ( Figures 2D and 2E ) , in agreement with our kinetic model implemented with the capping activity ( Figure 2F ; Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . Capping actin ﬁlament barbed ends con - strained actin ﬁlament elongation near the NPF nucleatingsites ( Figure2D ; Figure3B ; FigureS2C ) , in agreement with previous studies [ 6 , 12 ] , but without necessarily affecting the orientation of branches in the network assembled around particles . To increase the spatial resolution , we followed Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin - branched network assembly around glass rods , instead of around beads , with Alexa 532 - actin monomers . The branched actin ﬁlaments grew away from the rod until being capped at their barbed end ( Fig - ure 3A ) . Using photobleaching of Alexa 532 - actin , we followed the elongation of new ﬂuorescent actin branches until they dis - appeared after a capping event ( Figure 3A ; Movie S3A ) . When the CP concentration was increased , the actin - branched net - work did not propagate efﬁciently along the rod ( Figure 3C ) . In order to obtain a homogenous spread of branched ﬁlament network along the functionalized rod , actin assembly must be initiated by multiple actin ﬁlament ‘‘primers’’ at several NPF coating sites ( Figure 3C ) . We simulated the kinetics of nucleation , branching , and capping of new ﬁlaments on glass rods ( Figure 3D ; Movie Mechanism of Branched Actin Network Formation 425 S3B ) or beads ( Figures 2D – 2F ) by using the different kinetic steps illustrated in Figure 3E ( see also the detailed description of the model in Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S2A and S2B ) .

Scale bars represent 10 m m . ( E ) Model of branched network formation around the motile particle . The molecular mechanism of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated network formation consists of an initial ‘‘primer’’ - based activation ( ‘‘primer’’ trigger step ) followed by the autocata - lytic and propagative spread of the network . Each ‘‘primer’’ creates an independent network . These networks merge to cover the particle . Each new branch can transiently be stalled against the load ( see Figure S2Ab and [ 17 ] ) or elongate away from it before being capped . Networks are viewed from the top . The encircled areaattopisazoomedsideviewofsomebranch - ing points . ( See also Figure S2 and Movie S3 . ) of new ﬁlament branches was a self - sus - tained process that depended on CP concentration ( Figure 3D ; Movie S3B ) . Barbed - end capping restricted the max - imal growth of the network , whereas it had little or no effect on the self - sus - tained nucleation process at low CP concentration ( Figure 3D ; Movie S3B ) . Additionally , capping modiﬁed the distri - bution of ﬁlament branch lengths , but barbed - end orientation remained isotro - pic . Because CP reduced the average ﬁlament length , both the network radius and the rate of network extension were smaller with than without CP . More - over , CP increased the density of actin ﬁlaments inside the network . The model shows that a single actin ﬁlament ‘‘primer’’ was sufﬁcient at low CP concentration to trigger an explosive generation of branches ( Figure 3D , top and middle panels ; Current Biology Vol 20 No 5 426 Movie S3B ) . Conversely , experimental data and numeri - cal simulations showed that above a CP concentration of w 10 nM ( in our experimental setup ) , the shortened actin ﬁla - ment ‘‘primers’’ and reduced duration of branch elongation were unable to sustain autocatalytic branching ( Figures 3C and 3D , bottom panel ; Movie S3B ) . For CP concentrations above 10 nM , the model predicts that up to 20 independent actin ﬁlament ‘‘primers’’ were necessary to generate a fully developed ﬁlament meshwork comparable to experimental data ( Figure 1 ; Figure 4 ) . a b c 300 seconds 230 160 10 Front Side Crosssection Network displacement A B 0 4 8 12 16 min 3 15 27 50 min 39 3 8 12 19 28 min Figure 4 . Network Rupture Occurs through a ‘‘Multiple Shell - Breaking’’ Process of Randomly Oriented Actin Filaments ( Aa – Ac ) An isotropic actin network assembles around 2 m M GST - pWA - coated beads mixed with 2 m M Alexa 488 - G - actin and 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( Aa ) . Addition of 25 nM CP triggers a ‘‘multiple shell - breaking’’ process ( Ac ) ; arrowheads indicate the successive shells . We changed the ratio of Arp2 / 3 complex to CP and still observed the multiple shell - breaking process for 4 m M GST - pWA - coated beads mixed with 4 m M Alexa 488 - G - actin , 12 m M proﬁlin , 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , and 25 nM CP . However , insufﬁcient capping leads to a ‘‘ﬁshbone’’ pattern in the actin ‘‘comet’’ ( Ab ) . Arrowheads highlight elongating ﬁlaments or bundles growing away from the bead . Scale bars represent 10 m m . ( B ) Undertheexperimentalconditionsin ( Ac ) , themodel ( seeSupple - mental Experimental Procedures ) shows that after an isotropic and homogeneous growth of ﬁlaments nucleated on the bead ( 10 – 170 s ) , the internal stress fractures the network ( 170 s ) before the ﬁlaments are displaced ( between 170 s and 230 s ) . Newly nucleated actin ﬁla - ments spread over the bead ‘‘empty zone’’ ( after 230 s ) , leading to the reconstruction of a fully developed network . The free barbed ends in the network that move away from the bead ( 170 – 230 s ) are rapidly capped and form the ‘‘comet tail . ’’ Scale bar represents 5 m m . ( See also Figures S2 and S3 and Movies S4 and S5 . ) Evidence for a ‘‘Multiple Shell - Breaking’’ Process during Actin - Based Motility To bridge the molecular events of actin ﬁlament mesh - work formation and actin - based motility of NPF - coated beads , we used evanescent wave microscopy to follow actinassemblyaroundparticlesuntilsymmetrybreaking . IntheabsenceofCP , functionalizedbeadsassembledan actinnetworkwithastar - likepattern , asArp2 / 3complex - nucleatedbranchesatthebeadsurfacewiththeirbarbed ends growing away from the bead ( Figure 4Aa ) . Surpris - ingly , in the presence of sufﬁcient CP , we found that sus - tained motility results from a ‘‘multiple shell - breaking’’ process ( Figure 4Ac ; Movie S4B ) during ‘‘continuous movement’’ observed by phase contrast or epiﬂuores - cence microscopy ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . Based on this observation , we propose the following model centered on the control of actin ﬁlament length by CP ( Figure S2C ) : ( 1 ) CP creates a ‘‘dead zone’’ at the outer actin ‘‘shell’’ by inhibiting all actin ﬁlament elongation beyond the shell radius ; ( 2 ) Arp2 / 3 nucleation occurs strictly at the bead surface because NPF is immobilized on the particle ; this will create an active polymerization zone embedded within the constrained dead zone ; ( 3 ) continuous actin nucleation in the vicinity of the bead will generate an internal stress that breaks the former dead zone ; and ( 4 ) CP will block elongation of actin ﬁlaments in the ‘‘active zone , ’’ creating a new dead zone , while Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates new actin ﬁlaments at the surface of the bead , building a new active zone . The dead zone breaking repeats , leading to the multiple shell - breaking process . The existence of cyclic versus continuous network breakage was assigned to different mechanisms controlled by either particle size [ 5 ] or the role of ﬂuctuations behind symmetry breaking [ 6 , 14 ] . Based on our observations , we propose that the actin network oscillates between expansion and rupture phases , but de - pending on the network thickness at rupture , this process may or may not be observable via conventional microscopy methods but is always observable via TIRFM . Moreover , when the ratio between Arp2 / 3 complex and CP is low , multiple shell breaking still occurs , but some actin Mechanism of Branched Actin Network Formation 427 ﬁlaments elongate beyond the dead shell radius ( Figure 4Ab ; Figure S2C ; Movie S4A ) , giving rise to the ‘‘ﬁshbone’’ pattern observed previously [ 15 ] . Symmetry Breaking : The Elastic Continuum Made of Elementary Merging Actin Meshworks Breaks upon Mechanical and Spatial Constraints We modeled dynamic organization of actin ﬁlaments during network formation and shell breakage ( Supplemental Experi - mental Procedures ) . Simulations presented in Figure 3 show thatwhentheCPconcentrationishigh ( w 25nM ; seeFigure4A ) , about 30 independent ‘‘primers’’ are required to generate full coverage of the bead by growing actin ﬁlaments . Extension and merging of these elementary networks ( Figure 3E ; Fig - ure S2E ) , each generated by a single ‘‘primer’’ ﬁlament , pro - vides a continuous tilingof thebead within w 30min ( Figure4B ; Movie S5 ) . Extension of this network is accompanied by a slow but constant displacement of the actin ﬁlaments away from the bead ( Figure 3E ; Figure 4B ; Movie S5 ) . However , because entanglements between networks tend to oppose the forces generated at the bead surface , the progression of the network slows down and it reaches equilibrium . At 170 s , thermalﬂuctuationsleadtotheuniformtilingrupturebymoving the ﬁlaments away from the bead and leaving an empty space ( Figure S2E ) . This rapid movement ( between 180 s and 230 s ) relieves the stress applied to the actin ﬁlaments , which in turn results in a marked increase in the generation of new ﬁlaments ( Figure S2Fa ) . However , the orientation of actin ﬁlaments remains isotropic ( Figure S2Fc ) . The occurrence of symmetry breaking of the actin ﬁlament network around a NPF - coated beadinthepresenceofahighconcentrationofArp2 / 3complex and in the absence of CP ( Figure S3 ) conﬁrms our model’s fundamental hypothesis of barbed - end steric constraint . Concluding Remarks We propose that Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated force generation is based on a simple but fundamental steric constraint wherein elongating barbed ends tend to escape when they are aimed directly at the load and simultaneously entangled into a broad actin meshwork . Thus , ﬁlaments either growing along the load or growing outwards create a steric hindrance and a stress , which releases into propulsive forces , consistent with the mechanics of symmetry breaking of actin gel [ 6 , 7 ] . Therefore , a challenge for future investigations will be to constrain our molecular model with previous observations on the symmetry breaking time [ 7 ] to predict at the molecular level the mechan - ical properties of the active gel around the motile particle . We have demonstrated that actin ﬁlaments that we call ‘‘primers’’ initiate the formation of the actin network . Physio - logical concentration of capping proteins shortens the growth of these ‘‘primers’’ and creates independent networks made of isotropically oriented actin ﬁlaments that merge around the motile particle . Moreover , the movement of NPF - coated parti - cles then results from a multiple shell - breaking process con - trolled by the tight tiling of these independent networks , each grown from a single actin ﬁlament ‘‘primer . ’’ Our observa - tions suggest that force production necessary to propel cyto - plasmic particles or to protrude the plasma membrane relies not necessarily on any preferential orientation of actin ﬁla - ments inside the network , but on simple and universal physics laws . The ‘‘primer’’ - based mechanism likely emerges as a general feature of branched network assembly involved in ‘‘comet tail’’ or lamellipodium formation during pathogen or cell motility . Based on this mechanism , actin ﬁlaments parallel to the nucleating surface constitute an efﬁcient and optimal way to initiate branched network formation upon signaling .
