A R T I C L E S A direct role for Met endocytosis in tumorigenesis Carine Joffre 1 , 4 , Rachel Barrow 1 , Ludovic Ménard 1 , Véronique Calleja 2 , Ian R . Hart 3 and Stéphanie Kermorgant 1 , 5 Compartmentalization of signals generated by receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) endocytosis has emerged as a major determinant of various cell functions . Here , using tumour - associated Met - activating mutations , we demonstrate a direct link between endocytosis and tumorigenicity . Met mutants exhibit increased endocytosis / recycling activity and decreased levels of degradation , leading to accumulation on endosomes , activation of the GTPase Rac1 , loss of actin stress ﬁbres and increased levels of cell migration . Blocking endocytosis inhibited mutants’ anchorage - independent growth , in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis while maintaining their activation . One mutant resistant to inhibition by a Met - speciﬁc tyrosine kinase inhibitor was sensitive to endocytosis inhibition . Thus , oncogenicity of Met mutants results not only from activation but also from their altered endocytic trafﬁcking , indicating that endosomal signalling may be a crucial mechanism regulating RTK - dependent tumorigenesis . Compartmentalization of signals generated by growth factor endo - cytosis is a key determinant of various cell functions and organ - ism development 1 – 3 . Receptors signal on endosomes before their degradation 4 – 7 . RTKinteractionswithadaptor / signallingmolecules , for example EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) and Grb2 ( growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 ) , were visualized on endosomes 8 , and functional endocytosis machinery is required for optimal activation of signals , such as ERK1 / 2 ( extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ; refs 5 , 9 , 10 ) and STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ; ref . 7 ) . In the ‘signalling endosome’ concept 11 , 12 , the endosome represents a platform integrating signalling pathways temporally and spatially , to determine response specificity 13 – 15 for characteristics such as cell migration 2 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 16 and cell survival 17 , maintaining activated receptors and signals in close juxtaposition while providing protection against phosphatases 18 . By controlling these functions and pathways , endocytosis may contribute to oncogenicity , although little direct evidence supports this possibility 19 , 20 . Overexpression of the clathrin - associated protein HIP1 ( Huntingtin interacting protein 1 ) occurs in cancers , which possibly alters EGFR trafficking while promoting tumour formation 21 . However , no causative role for RTK endocytosis in cancer development has yet been established . Here we address this issue using oncogenic Met mutants . Met , the receptor for HGF ( hepatocyte growth factor ) , is implicated in the growth , survival and spread of various human cancers 22 – 24 . Two mutations ( M1268T and D1246N ) in the kinase domain , identified originally in human papillary renal carcinomas 25 , are 1 Spatial Signalling Team , Centre for Tumour Biology , Barts Cancer Institute , Queen Mary University of London , John Vane Science Centre , Charterhouse Square , London EC1M 6BQ , UK . 2 Cell Biophysics Laboratory , Cancer Research UK , London Research Institute , 44 Lincoln’s Inn Fields , London WC2A 3PX , UK . 3 Centre for Tumour Biology , Barts Cancer Institute , Queen Mary University of London , John Vane Science Centre , Charterhouse Square , London EC1M 6BQ , UK . 4 Present address : Institut Curie , INSERM U - 830 , 26 rue d’Ulm , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 5 Correspondence should be addressed to S .

We show that these Met mutants are oncogenic not only because of their activation but also because of where they signal , such that blocking endocytosis inhibits transformation , tumour growth and metastasis while maintaining their activation . RESULTS Active Met mutants accumulate in intracellular compartments We used NIH3T3 cells , producing small amounts of HGF , stably transfected with murine wild - type Met or mutant Met D1246N or Met M1268T ( ref . 26 ) . Both the precursor ( p - 170 ) and mature β chain ( p - 145 ) forms were detected ( Fig . 1a ) ; the expression levels of wild - type Met and Met M1268T were comparable , and that of D1246N was elevated slightly ( 1 . 6 - fold ; Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . S1a ) . The phosphorylation levels of Tyr 1234 / 1235 ( kinase domain ) and 1349 ( docking site ) were high in mutants relative to the wild type , consistent with enhanced kinase activity 27 and total phosphorylation 26 ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . Normalization on Met expression excluded that this resulted from higher expression levels ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . Exogenous HGF significantly enhanced the levels of phosphorylation of wild type and mutant proteins ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . The Met - specific TKI ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) , PHA - 665752 ( PHA ) , reduced the mutant M1268T basal phosphorylation level , whereas D1246N seemed resistant to it ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . S1c ) . Wild - type Met was expressed at the plasma membrane in NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2011 827 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

In unstimulated cells , the two mutants were expressed at both the plasma membrane and in punctate cytoplasmic structures ( Fig . 1d ) . Marked phospho - tyrosine staining occurred in mutant - expressing cells with co - localizations indicative of Met mutant activation at the plasma membrane and in intracellular pools ( Fig . 1d ) . PHA abolished phospho - tyrosine staining of cells expressing the M1268T mutant ; thus , a high phospho - tyrosine cellular content reflects Met activity ( Supplementary Fig . S1d ) . Separation procedures ( see Methods ; ref . 29 ) demonstrated that around 52 % of the mutants were present in the intracellular fraction , compared with 18 % of the wild - type Met ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 1e , f ) .

Met mutants also accumulated in a perinuclear area ( Fig . 2a , b ) and co - localized more with cyanine - 3 - coupled transferrin ( Cy3 – transferrin ) and the small GTPases , Rab4 and Rab11 , than wild - type Met ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig .

S9 . or the lysosome marker , lysotracker ( Supplementary Fig . S2e ) . The level of Cy3 – transferrin uptake was similar in all cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2f ) . Thus , under basal conditions , D1246N and M1268T mutants localized on early and recycling endosomes . Together with localization of Met mutants at the plasma membrane and on endosomes ( Fig . 1d ) , this indicated that they internalize and recycle back to the cell surface constitutively . The rates of surface - biotinylated Met internalization and subse - quent recycling were measured by streptavidin - agarose pulldown of surface - biotinylated Met after different incubation periods ( bi - otin cleavage at the cell surface allowing determination of in - tracellular biotinylated Met ; see Methods ) . After 15min , around 20 % of the Met M1268T had internalized ( Fig . 2c ) , a level com - parable to wild - type Met stimulated with HGF ( Supplementay NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2011 829 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . A R T I C L E S Fig . S2g ) , whereas 10 % of non - stimulated wild - type Met had in - ternalized ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 2c ) . After 5min , 14 % of the Met D1246N had internalized , compared with 3 % of the wild - type Met ( Sup - plementary Fig . S2h ) . On re - incubation at 37 ◦ C for a further 15min ( see Methods ) , the proportion of internalized Met mutant M1268T was much lower when compared with wild - type Met ( Fig . 2c ) . Degradation was excluded ( Supplementary Fig . S2i ) . Ex - pression of the dominant - negative GFP – Rab11 S25N construct sig - nificantly reduced the level of Met M1268T at the cell surface ( mea - sured by flow cytometry ) , but had no effect on wild - type Met ( Fig . 2d ) , indicating that increased mutant recycling is promoted , at least partially by Rab11 . Cell - surface wild - type Met and Met M1268T levels were analysed over time using a biotinylation degradation assay ( see Methods ) . The level of M1268T mutant degradation was less than the wild type ( Supplementary Fig . S2i ) , indicating that increased constitutive internalization led not to increased levels of degradation but , rather , to a delay , consistent with recycling to the cell surface . HGF stimulation normally induces high levels of degradation of endogenous wild - type Met ( ref . 30 ) , indicating that differences in degradation rates between Met forms would be amplified following such treatment . Met protein levels were analysed by western blotting in cells pretreated with cycloheximide . Wild - type Met was degraded progressively , with only 20 % of the initial Met expression after 8h of HGF stimulation ( Fig . 2e ) . Conversely , the level of degradation of D1246N and M1268T Met mutants was reduced markedly , with Met levels non - significantly different between 0 and 8h of HGF stimulation ( Fig . 2e ) ; the results were confirmed with a biotin degradation assay ( Fig . 2f ) . This defect in degradation did not result from impaired endocytosis on HGF stimulation ( Supplementary Fig . S2g ) . Activated Met mutants therefore accumulate on endosomal compartments through constitutive shuttling between the plasma membrane and endosomes , and defective degradation . A PHA - induced decrease in the activation level of the M1268T mutant did not affect the endocytosis levels ( Fig . 2g ) . Endocytosis of Met mutants is dependent on clathrin , dynamin , c - Cbl and Grb2 Endogenous Met internalization is dependent on dynamin and clathrin 5 , 7 . The dynamin inhibitors dynasore 31 and dynole 34 - 2 ( ref . 32 ; Supplementary Fig . S3a ) , a dynamin dominant - negative construct ( dynamin - 2 K44A – GFP ; Supplementary Fig . S3b , c ) , clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) transient and stable knockdown by RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi Supplementary Fig . S3d , e ) and short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ; Supplementary Fig . S3f , g ) all inhibited HGF – Alexa 555 cellular uptake and , therefore , Met endocytosis 7 ( Supplementary Fig . S3h ) . All blockers inhibited the constitutive internalization of the mutants : Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . S3i show blocking of Met M1268T internalization by dynasore or CHC knockdown ; Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . S3j show increased levels of Met M1268T at the plasma membrane and its decreased level in intracellular pools in cells knocked down for CHC . The E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor protein c - Cbl plays a major role in promoting RTK endocytosis 33 , 34 . Knocking down c - Cbl markedly decreased the level of constitutive endocytosis of Met M1268T ( Fig . 3c , d ) . The cells do not express EGFR ( Supplementary Fig . S3k ) , excluding effects on this RTK , which is also regulated by c - Cbl ( ref . 35 ) . The adaptor protein Grb2 is a major determinant of clathrin - dependent RTK endocytosis on ligand stimulation 33 , 34 , and a possible constitutive association of the D1246N and M1268T mutants with Grb2 has been reported 27 , 36 . Knocking down Grb2 reduced ( threefold ) the level of constitutive endocytosis of Met M1268T ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 3c , d ) . Co - immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy con - firmed the association between Met M1268T and Grb2 at the plasma membrane and on endosomes ( Fig . 3e and Supplementary Fig . S3l , m ) . Transferrin uptake , monitored as a control , was inhibited with dynasore , or on CHC knockdown , but remained unchanged on c - Cbl or Grb2 knockdown ( Supplementary Fig . S3n ) . Met M1268T was further mutated on N1358H , in position + 2 of Tyr 1356 in the Met docking site , to abrogate the Grb2 consensus sequence without affecting other effectors 37 . For this , a human wild - type Met complementary DNA ( hWt ) was mutated on M1268T ( hM1268T ) or on both M1268T and N1358H ( hM1268T / N1358H ) . The M1268T mutation triggered an enhanced level of Met phosphorylation ( Sup - plementary Fig . S3o ) and co - localization with EEA1 ( Fig . 3f ) . The level of co - localization of the double mutant with EEA1 was less than that of the single mutant ( P < 0 . 05 ) and was similar to that of wild - type Met ( Fig . 3f ) . Met mutants require endocytosis to control actin cytoskeleton remodelling Using these endocytic blockers , we investigated whether endoso - mal accumulation of active Met mutants is responsible for cel - lular outcomes . Paxillin staining revealed that the numbers of cells with focal adhesions were reduced significantly for mutant - expressing cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) . Actin organization ( visu - alized by phalloidin – Cy3 staining ) was modified markedly , under basal conditions , in cells expressing Met mutants ( Fig . 4a ) ; their appearance resembling wild - type cells following HGF treatment ( Supplementary Fig . S4b ) . A total of 65 – 71 % of D1246N - and M1268T - expressing cells lacked stress fibres , whereas only 28 % of wild - type - expressing cells had a similar morphology ( Fig . 4b ) . In M1268T - expressing cells , PHA significantly restored paxillin patches ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) and stress fibres ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Cells expressing the D1246N mutant did not respond to this treatment ( Fig . 4a , b ) , consistent with there being no reduction in the level of Met phosphorylation ( Fig . 1c ) . However , Met knockdown restored stress fibres in both mutant - expressing cells and had no effect in wild - type cells ( Fig . 4a – c ) . Decreasing the level of Met mutant accumulation on endosomes , using dynasore ( Fig . 4d ) , dynamin - 2 K44A – GFP expression , CHC stable knockdown , c - Cblknockdown , Grb2knockdownorexpressionofGrb2 dominant - negative mutants in the SH2 ( Src homology 2 ; Grb2 - 89A ) or SH3 ( Grb2 - 49L / 203R ) domains 38 ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Fig . S4c – i ) , restored stress fibres . There was no effect on wild - type cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4f ) . In cell lines expressing the human constructs , the percentage of cells lacking stress fibres was significantly higher in Met mutant hM1268T , than in hWt cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; stress fibres were restored by PHA in cells expressing hM1268T ( Fig . 4f ) . Cells expressing Met hM1268T / N1358H had restored stress fibres and looked similar to wild - type cells ( Fig . 4f ) . 830 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

On treatment with PHA ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . S5d ) , or Met knockdown ( Fig . 5d and Supplementary Fig .

In cells expressing mutant Met , Rac1 was detected in punctate cytoplasmic structures , partially co - localizing with EEA1 ( Fig . 5c ) . The level of Rac1 localization at membrane protrusions was reduced by the recycling inhibitor primaquine ( data not shown ) . Activated Rac1 was visualized on endosomes ( co - localization of Rac1 and GST – PAK - PBD ; glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged p21 activated kinase 1 protein ( PAK ) Rac / Cdc42 ( p21 ) binding domain ( PBD ) ) co - localizing with Met M1268T ( Fig . 5f ) and Met D1246N ( not shown ) . The percentage of cells with Rac1 at membrane protrusions was significantly higher in cells expressing the hM1268T Met mutant than in hWt cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) and this was reduced by PHA in cells expressing hM1268T . Cells expressing hM1268T / N1358H Met had reduced levels of Rac1 localization at membrane protrusions , appearing similar to hWt cells ( Fig . 5g ) . Thus , Rac1 is activated by endosome - localised Met mutants ; such activation is responsible for the observed loss of stress fibres . Endocytosis is required for Met mutants to stimulate cell migration After 2h of incubation , more cells expressing D1246N and M1268T mutants ( > 3 - fold ) had migrated through Transwell membranes than cells expressing wild - type Met ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 6a and Supplementary Fig .

No change occurred in tumour size with either treatment . The efficacy of dynasore in reducing the level of mutant local - ization in EEA1 - positive endosomes and increasing it at the plasma membrane was verified by immunofluorescence mi - croscopy ( Fig . 8e ) . Unexpectedly , dynasore treatment or CHC knockdown did not decrease the levels of phosphorylation of the different Met mutants in tumours ( Fig . 8f , g ) , and in vitro CHC or c - Cbl or Grb2 knockdown also did not reduce the levels of Met M1268T phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figs . S7f – h ) . Thus , the high level of tumorigenicity in vivo of D1246N and M1268T mutants is linked directly to enhanced endosomal trafficking , leading to their accumulation and signalling on endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . S8 , model ) . DISCUSSION TwodistinctactivatingmutationsinthekinasedomainofMet , D1246N and M1268T , lead to increased levels of Met endocytosis / recycling and reduced levels of Met degradation . This perturbed trafficking of activated Met mutants induces neoplastic transformation , directly linking endocytosis and tumorigenicity . Generally , the global intensity of activation has been implicated in RTK oncogenicity , with little attention paid to the precise localization of the generated signals . Thus , it has been assumed that D1246N and M1268T mutants are oncogenic simply because they are highly activated 27 , 40 . Recent studies however have reported signalling of mutated activated RTKs , in an immature form , from intracellular compartments of the secretory pathway 41 – 44 , leading to tumorigenesis 41 , 45 . We suggest that Met mutants D1246N and M1268T are oncogenic not only because they are activated but also because they signal on endosomes . Thus , following inhibition of endocytosis , the mutants remain activated but are not oncogenic . Increased levels of endocytic trafficking of Met mutants influence their oncogenicity , with activation and altered endocytic trafficking together leading to transformation . Present models of tumorigenesis stimulated by oncogenic mature forms of RTK may need to be refined to encompass the potential contribution of endosomal signalling . Initially considered solely as the means whereby RTK desensitization was achieved , RTK endocytosis has recently been reported to promote signals 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 10 and functions 15 , 46 that play a role in tumour evolution . Some endocytic proteins , such as HIP1 or Rab25 , are overexpressed in human cancers 19 , 20 and mutant p53 drives cell invasion by promoting α 5 β 1 integrin and EGFR recycling and EGFR constitutive NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2011 835 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . A R T I C L E S activation 47 . Such studies report on modifications of molecules that impinge on RTK trafficking and signalling . Modification of RTK endocytic trafficking on its own , leading to enhanced levels of signalling and transformation , has not been reported ; however , several oncogenic RTKs have been shown to escape degradation 35 , 48 , 49 . Here we provide evidence of a direct link between RTK endocytosis and cancer development . The increased level of endocytosis activity of Met mutants is dependent on clathrin , dynamin , c - Cbl and Grb2 , but is independent of high activation status , because Met M1268T internalizes just as well when its activity is strongly reduced by a Met - specific TKI . Previous studies showed that the kinase - dead EGFR K721A internalizes 50 and that , if EGFR kinase activity is partially inhibited , ubiquitylation of the receptor can mediate its internalization 51 . Dimerization of RTKs has also been proposed to be required for their internalization , rather than their activation 52 . We detected no obvious differences in ubiquitylation levels in our cells ( data not shown ) . Endosomal signalling of RTK , by spatially and temporally restricting signalling , contributes to pathway specificity 5 , 7 , 13 , 14 . The basis of such selectivity has remained elusive because Met recruits almost all downstream signals through only two tyrosines ( Tyr 1349 and Tyr 1356 ; ref . 22 ) . We propose that continuous endocytosis / recycling , associated with an impaired degradation , contributes to the maintenance of activated receptor on endosomes and , therefore , to the persistence of endosomal signals . Thus , signal specificity ( generated through endosomal signalling ) and persistence together may constitute ‘transforming signals’ . The enhanced level of endocytosis / recycling of the two transforming mutants , associated with their impaired degradation , indicates that they undergo a persistent shuttling between the plasma membrane and endosomes . Such shuttling of ligand - stimulated RTKs , and integrins , has recently been shown to regulate the spatial restriction of signalling necessary for directed migration 16 , 53 , 54 . The transformation capacity of the D1246N and M1268T Met mutants was decreased through various manipulations of endocytosis inhibition , including the introduction of a second mutation . Strikingly , in vivo tumour growth and / or experimental metastasis were reduced significantly by pharmacological blockers of endocytosis or by stable clathrin knockdown , providing proof of principle that , in our model , endocytosis plays a role in transformation . Strategies to inhibit Met - dependent tumorigenesis based on interference with Met localization or ‘endosome - specific targeting’ may be considered 55 . Importantly , one mutant was resistant to inhibition by a Met - specific TKI but sensitive to endocytosis inhibition , in vitro and in vivo ( Figs 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ) ; thus , this approach may impact on TKI - inhibitor - resistant cancers .

M E T H O D S DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb2257 METHODS Cell lines . NIH3T3 cells expressing murine 26 or human cDNAs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % calf serum ( Gibco ) and G418 ( Sigma ) for the human Met cells . To generate hMet stable cell lines , NIH3T3 cells ( ATCC ) were transfected with hWt , hM1268T or hM1268T / N1358H and selected with 800 µ gml − 1 G418 . Site - directed mutagenesis . hM1268T and hM1268T / N1358H were produced from human Met Wt - V5 / histidine in pRK5neo ( ref . 56 ) with the Quick Change II XL mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) and checked by full sequencing . Reagents . Antibodies and constructs are listed in Supplementary Table S2 . HGF ( R & D ) was used at 50ngml − 1 . Alexa - 546 - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 / 250 ) and Cy3 – transferrin ( 1 / 500 ) were purchased from Molecular Probes . Cycloheximide ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) and dynasore ( 80 µ M ) were purchased from Sigma . Rac1 inhibitor ( 100 µ M ) waspurchasedfromCalbiochem . PHA - 665752 ( 100nM ) andDynole34 - 2 ( 30 µ M ) were gifts from J . Christensen ( Pfizer , San Francisco , California , USA ) and P . J . Robinson ( Children’s Medical Research Institute Australia ) , respectively . Transfections . Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 with Plus reagent ( Invitrogen ) or with Amaxa technology ( Kit R , Lonza ) . For functional assays on cells expressing dynamin - 2 K44A – GFP , GFP - positive cells were purified on a high - speed MoFlo cell sorter ( Beckman Coulter ) . Lentiviral transductions . Transductions were carried out using MISSION Lentiviral Transduction Particles ( Sigma ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Western blot and densitometric analysis . Western blot and densitometric analyses were carried out as described previously 30 . Immunoprecipitation . Cells plated in 15cm plates were lysed the next day with 25mM HEPES at pH7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 10 % glycerol , 1 . 25 % CHAPS ( 3 - [ ( 3 - cholamidopropyl ) dimethylammonio ] - 1 - propane sulphonate ; Sigma ) , protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I and II ( Cal - biochem ) . Lysates were centrifuged ( 17 , 000 g ) and subjected to immunoprecip - itation with the appropriate antibody coupled to protein - A Sepharose beads ( Invitrogen ) . Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in SDS - sample buffer . Anti - Grb2 and anti - Met antibodies were covalently coupled to protein - A Sepharose beads ( 1 µ g of antibody per microlitre of beads ) with 20mM of dimethylpimelimi - date in 0 . 2M borate for the Grb2 antibody and with 3M NaCl in 50mM borate for theMetantibody . Foreachimmunoprecipitationexperiment , asacontrol , immuno - precipitation with the isotype - matched partner of the corresponding antibody used for the immunoprecipitation was carried out . Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis . Cells ( 2 × 10 4 ) were plated onto coverslips coated with 0 . 01 % poly - l - lysine ( Sigma ) . Immunoflu - orescence and confocal microscopy analysis were carried out as described previously 7 . Each image represents a single section of 0 . 7 µ m thickness . For im - age quantifications , picture fields were chosen arbitrarily on the basis of DAPI ( 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) staining . Resultsarethemeanofthreeindependent experiments . For Met intracellular localization and co - localization experiments , seven pictures were taken per condition . The percentages of co - localizations were determined using MetaMorph software . The counting of cells lacking actin stress fibres , or Rac1 at sites of membrane protrusion , was carried out on at least 100 cells per experiment . Flow cytometry . To determine the level of Met expression at the plasma membrane , cells were plated in 24 - well plates and 24h or 48h later washed in cold fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) buffer ( PBS 2 % serum ) . Cells were incubated in cold FACS buffer containing 10 µ gml − 1 biotinylated antibody ( anti - Met or goat IgG ) . After incubation on ice , cells were washed and incubated on icewithstreptavidin – AlexaFluor647conjugates . Flowcytometrydatawereacquired on a FACS Calibur ( Becton Dickinson ) . Biotinylation surface removal A modified method 29 was established to measure the proportion of Met inside the cells . Cell surface proteins were labelled covalently using a membrane - impermeant biotinylation reagent ( N - hydroxysulphosuccinimide ( sulpho - NHS ) - SS - biotin ; Pierce ) . The following steps were carried out at 4 ◦ C to prevent any trafficking : cells were incubated with 0 . 15mgml − 1 biotinfor10minandtheexcessbiotinylationreagentwasquenchedby washingwith25mMTrisatpH8 , 137mMNaCl , 5mMKCl , 2 . 3mMCaCl 2 , 0 . 5mM MgCl 2 and 1mM Na 2 HPO 4 . Cells were lysed ( in radioimmunoprecipitation assay , RIPA , buffer ) andcentrifuged ( 17 , 000 g ) . Afractionofthesupernatant ( totalcellular Met = ‘total’ ) was collected . The residual supernatant received streptavidin - agarose beads ( Upstate ) and was agitated at 4 ◦ C for 2h . Beads were collected by centrifuga - tion ( 7 , 000 g ) andthesupernatant ( internalpoolofMet = ‘unbound’ ) wascollected . Beads were washed in lysis buffer at 4 ◦ C and proteins ( surface pool of Met = ‘bound’ ) were extracted by heating at 95 ◦ C with sample buffer . Equivalent volumes were analysed in a Met western blotting assay and densitometric analyses were carried out . The percentage of intracellular Met was calculated using the following formula : intracellular Met receptor = ( Met in unbound fraction ) / ( total Met ) × 100 . Biotinylation internalization and recycling assay . On ice , cell surface proteins were labelled with 0 . 2mgml − 1 sulpho - NHS - SS - biotin in PBS for 45min . Labelled cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated at 37 ◦ C in culture medium , to allow protein trafficking . At the indicated times , the medium was aspirated and the dishes were transferred to ice and washed with cold PBS . Biotin was removed from proteins remaining at the cell surface by reduction for 15min with 180mM of the membrane - impermeant reducing agent MesNa ( sodium 2 mercaptoethane sulphonate , Sigma ) in 50mM Tris and 100mM NaCl at pH8 . 6 . MesNa was quenched by the addition of 180mM iodoacetamide ( IAA , Sigma ) for 10min . To measure internalized Met , the assay was then terminated and cells were lysed . Lysates were passed three times through a 27 - gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation ( 17 , 000 g ) ; equal protein amounts received streptavidin - agarose beads and were agitated at 4 ◦ C for 2h ; beads were collected by centrifugation ( 7 , 000 g ) , washedinlysisbufferandproteinswereextractedbyheatingat95 ◦ Cwith sample buffer . To measure the proportion of the internalized Met that recycles back to the cell surface , the internalized fraction was chased from the cells by returning them to 37 ◦ C for 15min . Cells were then returned to ice and biotin was removed from recycled proteins by a second reduction with MesNa . Unreacted MesNa was quenched with IAA and cells were lysed and processed as for measurements of receptor internalization . In each internalization or recycling assay , two controls were carried out . To measure the total Met at the surface , biotinylated cells at 4 ◦ C were lysed without biotin reduction . To verify the efficiency of the surface biotin removal , the biotin reduction and MesNa quenching steps were carried out on cells that had remained on ice ( time 0 ) and lysis was carried out . Equivalent volumes were analysed in a Met western blotting assay and densit - ometric analyses were carried out . The percentages of internalized or recycled Met werecalculatedusingthefollowingformulae : internalizedreceptor = ( Metlevelafter first incubation at 37 ◦ C ) − ( Met level at time 0 ) / ( total surface Met ) × 100 ; recycled receptor = 100 − [ ( Met level after 15min of re - incubation at 37 ◦ C ) − ( Met level at time 0 ) / ( Met level after first incubation at 37 ◦ C ) − ( Met level at time 0 ) × 100 ] Biotinylation degradation assay . Cells were washed in PBS , incubated at 4 ◦ C with 0 . 2mgml − 1 biotin in PBS and further incubated for 45min at 37 ◦ C in culture medium , with or without HGF . At indicated time points , cells were washed on ice with cold PBS , lysed and analysed as in the biotinylation internalization assay . Rac1activationassays . The levels of Rac – GTP in cell lysates were measured using the Rac1 Activation Assay Biochem Kit ( Cytoskeleton ) . For analysis of active Rac localization by immunofluorescence microscopy 57 , GST – PAK - PBD was affinity purified from bacterial lysates with glutathione - Sepharose beads and eluted with 10mM glutathione in 100mM Tris - HCl at pH8 . 0 . Cells were prepared as described above for immunofluorescence microscopy and incubated with 2 µ g of the eluted GST – PAK - PBD for 1h , followed by rabbit anti - GST antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and secondary anti - rabbit antibody . Transwell migration assay . The Transwell ( Corning , 8 µ M pore size ) underside wascoatedwithfibronectin ( 1 : 100inPBS , Sigma ) . Atotalof20 , 000serum - deprived ( 1 % donor calf serum ) cells were added to the upper well in serum - free medium plus 0 . 1 % BSA , with drugs or DMSO . The lower well contained culture medium . After2hofculture , cellsremainingintheupperwellwereremoved . Theinsertswere fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained with haematoxylin .

Top left panel : In the absence of ligand ( HGF ) , Wt Met is inactive and is not or poorly internalised . Little or no signal generation occurs . Top right panel : Ligand binding induces Wt Met activation and internalisation followed by recruitment on endosomes . From here it remains active and signals ( “endosomal signalling” ) but Wt Met gets degraded progressively , leading to a restricted period of signal generation and the “signal ending” . Lower left panel : Oncogenic D1246N and M1268T mutations ( in the kinase domain of Met ) lead to constitutive activation on the one hand , and upregulated internalisation on the other hand . In addition , instead of being degraded , the mutants constitutively recycle back to the plasma membrane . These events result in an increased accumulation of Met mutants on endosomes , which leads to “persistent endosomal signalling” . We propose that signal specificity ( generated through endosomal signalling ) and signal persistence ( due to the net outcome which results from the mutants’ constitutive activation , shuttling between the plasma membrane and endosomes and their impaired degradation ) together constitute the “transforming signals” which lead to transformation . Lower right panel : The ligand ( HGF ) , by increasing the activation level of Met mutants while increasing their level of internalisation , further upregulates the level of endosomal signalling , thereby enhancing the “transforming signals” .
