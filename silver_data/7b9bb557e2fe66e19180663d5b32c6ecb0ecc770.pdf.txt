Weiss , Andreas Fink Department of Psychology , Biological Psychology Unit , University of Graz , Austria A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords : Figural creative ideation EEG Upper alpha power Elaboration Motor imagery A B S T R A C T This study investigated EEG activity in the upper alpha band during the well - known Picture Completion Task of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ) , a widely used creative ideation task in the ﬁ gural domain . The application of a sophisticated computerized version of the TTCT facilitating the online assessment and digita - lizing of participant ' s drawings allowed to separate two central stages of the creative ideation process ( i . e . , idea generation and idea elaboration ) . During idea generation , the participants ’ task was to generate an initial draft of an original and creative completion of the presented abstract lines and ﬁ gures of the TTCT . During idea ela - boration , the participants were required to mentally improve the originality of the initially generated idea / draft . Creative ideation in this ﬁ gural task was generally associated with comparatively strong desynchronization of upper alpha power over parietal and occipital sites , indicating high visual / ﬁ gural processing demands . Interestingly , the stage of idea elaboration was accompanied by a relative increase of upper alpha power at parietal and occipital sites compared to the stage of idea generation , indicating heightened top - down processing demands . Furthermore , task performance was associated with relative increases of upper alpha power at frontal sites and relative decreases at centro - temporal sites from the stage of idea generation to idea elaboration . This association suggests the importance of increased inhibitory control over stimulus - based bottom - up information and motor imagery in order to achieve more creative outputs . Taken together these ﬁ ndings add to the relevant literature in that they a ) extend research on the relationship between EEG alpha activity and creativity to the ﬁ gural domain , and b ) support a multistage view of creative ideation , involving cognitive control and mental imagery as important components of creativity . 1 . Introduction Creativity is without any doubt one of the most important and fascinating skills of mankind , leading to numerous scienti ﬁ c studies trying to discover the underlying brain activation patterns associated with creative ideation ( see , e . g . , Arden et al . , 2010 ; Jung and Vartanian , 2018 ) . In recent years , the comparatively young ﬁ eld of neuroscienti ﬁ c research on creativity has made considerable process in unveiling re - levant brain mechanisms associated with creative ideation by means of event - related ( de ) synchronization ( ERD / ERS ; Pfurtscheller , 1999 ) and task - related power changes ( TRP ; Gerlo ﬀ , 1998 ) in the EEG alpha band ( e . g . , Benedek et al . , 2011 , 2014 ; Fink et al . , 2007 , 2009b ; for an overview see Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . A frequently reported ﬁ nding is that creative ideation is associated with an increase of alpha power ( relative to a resting baseline ) at bi - lateral frontal and ( right ) posterior cortical sites , somewhat more pronounced in the upper alpha band ( ~ 10 – 12 Hz ) , which has been claimed as being more sensitive to speci ﬁ c task requirements ( e . g . , se - mantic memory processes , Klimesch , 1999 ; for an overview see Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . Interestingly , similar brain activation patterns were also reported for tasks that do not capture creative ideation in the narrower sense , like a word association task ( Jauk et al . , 2012 ) , an open problem based reasoning task ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ) , during imagining dancing ( Fink et al . , 2009b ) , insight - full problem solving ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ) , or creative cognitive reappraisal of a negative emotional event ( Fink et al . , 2017 ) . The reported overlaps of brain activation patterns between creative ideation in the verbal domain and other tasks suggest that the observed pattern of TRP changes are , at least partly , independent of the task at hand and associated with cognitive functions ( e . g . , inhibitory , top - down control ) implicated in many di ﬀ erent crea - tivity - related demands . Task - related increases in the upper alpha band might strongly https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neuropsychologia . 2018 . 02 . 013 Received 26 September 2017 ; Received in revised form 17 January 2018 ; Accepted 10 February 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author .

T represent active inhibition of external stimuli , internal attention , and the shielding of working memory processes from task - irrelevant in - formation ( see , e . g . , Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . The alpha power in - crease might re ﬂ ect a mechanism increasing the signal to noise ratio , by attentional gating of task - relevant and task - irrelevant brain areas ( Cooper et al . , 2003 ; Crespo - Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Foxe and Snyder , 2011 ; Jensen et al . , 2002 ; Klimesch et al . , 1999 ; Krause et al . , 1996 ; Payne et al . , 2013 ; Sauseng et al . , 2005 ; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 , for a short overview see Benedek , 2018 ) . Most of the electrophysiological knowledge about creative ideation / divergent thinking is based on verbal creative ideation tasks ( e . g . , the Alternate Uses Task , AUT ; for an overview see , e . g . , Arden et al . , 2010 ; Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . However , if the reported electrophysiological activation patterns represent general mental processes relevant for creative ideation ( e . g . , top - down control , internal attention ) , studying creative ideation in other domains ( e . g . , ﬁ gural , a ﬀ ective ) should be associated with similar brain activation patterns than those observed during creative ideation in the verbal domain ( for a similar approach see , e . g . , Fink et al . , 2017 ; Rominger et al . , 2017b ) . Former studies focusing on EEG correlates underlying ﬁ gural crea - tivity indicated a decrease of alpha power during creative ideation tasks compared to a reference period and to verbal creative ideation tasks ( Jausovec and Jausovec , 2000 ; Petsche et al . , 1997 ; Razumnikova et al . , 2009 ; for review see Pidgeon et al . , 2016 ) . Though these studies con - siderably di ﬀ er with respect to the applied methodological / analytical approaches and experimental settings from the studies focusing on verbal creative ideation , the reported pattern of task - related alpha power decreases during ﬁ gural tasks seems to run counter the com - monly found alpha power increases during verbal creative ideation ( Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . The ﬁ rst aim of this study was thus to pro - vide additional information regarding task - related alpha power changes during ﬁ gural creative ideation and to explore whether creative idea - tion in the ﬁ gural domain is associated with a similar pattern of ﬁ ndings reported in studies concerned with verbal creative ideation in applying a comparable experimental setting and analytical / methodological ap - proach ( see e . g . , Fink et al . , 2009a , Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . Fur - thermore , many authors proposed that creativity is a process with multiple stages ( e . g . , generative and exploratory , Finke et al . , 1996 ; Benedek and Jauk , in press ; Kleinmintz et al . , 2017 ; Rominger et al . , 2017a ; Sowden et al . , 2015 ) . The study of Schwab et al . ( 2014 ) revealed that the process of thinking about original and alternative uses of ob - jects went along with a characteristic time - course of TRP in the upper alpha band , re ﬂ ecting distinct stages of the creative thinking process ( see also Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ) . The second aim of the present study , therefore , was to examine neurocognitive processes involved in dif - ferent stages of creative ideation in the ﬁ gural domain ( i . e . idea gen - eration and idea elaboration ; for a similar approach see Ellamil et al . , 2012 ) . In order to address these study questions , the well - known Picture Completion Task of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ; Torrance , 1966 ) was used . The TTCT provides optimal prerequisites to study brain activation during creative ideation in the ﬁ gural domain . Firstly , by means of the TTCT it is possible to investigate di ﬀ erent stages of the creative process , such as the stage of generating an original and creative idea and the stage of elaborating and improving the ori - ginality of this particular idea . These two stages are already im - plemented in the scoring procedure of the TTCT , which discriminates between both central features of divergent thinking , originality and elaboration of an idea ( Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Torrance , 1966 ) . Secondly , the TTCT shows high ecological validity , since drawing an original picture ( or to complete a picture fragment creatively ) is very close to every day creative performances in the ﬁ gural domain ( little c ; Kaufman and Beghetto , 2009 ; see Runco et al . , 2010 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , in this study participants were instructed to complete the picture frag - ments as original and creative as possible during two separated stages . The participants ’ task was to generate an initial draft of an original and creative completion of the presented abstract lines and ﬁ gures of the TTCT ( stage of idea generation ) , which they had to further improve during the second stage of idea elaboration . In order to assess the electrophysiological activation during task performance adequately , both stages were divided into a phase of creative thinking / idea gen - eration and a phase of active drawing . We expected that the processes of idea generation and idea ela - boration were associated with distinct patterns of alpha activity , which in turn should be associated with the performance outcome of the creative process ( Fink et al . , 2009a ; Jausovec , 2000 ; Petsche et al . , 1997 ; Rominger et al . , 2017b ) . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Participants Fifty individuals ( 48 university students , 32 women ) participated in the study . The participants were recruited online via email and social media and o ﬄ ine via advertisements at the local institute . The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 42 ( M = 22 . 84 ; SD = 4 . 64 ) . All participants were right - handed ( assessed by the hand dominance test , HDT ; Steingrüber and Lienert , 1971 ; Papousek and Schulter , 1999 ) , non - medicated , and written informed consent was obtained . Partici - pants were requested to refrain from alcohol for twelve hours and from co ﬀ ee and other stimulating beverages for two hours prior to their lab appointment , and to come to the session well rested . The study was approved by the local ethics committee . 2 . 2 . TTCT The Picture Completion Task of the TTCT ( Torrance , 1966 ) is a well - known ﬁ gural creativity / divergent thinking test ( Kim , 2006 ) . The participants ’ task is to complete or extend abstract lines or ﬁ gures in a creative and original way . For the current study , the procedure of the TTCT was adjusted in order to be applicable during EEG recording and to allow to separate the stages of idea generation and idea elaboration . To this end , participants used a professional pen tablet ( Wacom Intuos Pro Large ) , placed on a small table in front of them , to complete the picture fragments by means of a stylus connected to the tablet ( see Fig . 1 ) . The whole procedure of the TTCT was computerized by means of the software PsychoPy ( Peirce , 2007 ; see Fig . 2 ) . Computerizing the TTCT allowed the recording of the exact time - course and the digitali - zation of ideas and , hence , the di ﬀ erentiation between creative thinking / elaboration , active drawing , and the on - line presentation of the individually produced creative ideas . Each trial started with a white cross ( 15 s ) , which served as re - ference period followed by the two di ﬀ erent stages , the generation of the idea and the elaboration of this particular idea . 2 . 3 . First stage – idea generation : Mental generation of an original and creative idea During the ﬁ rst stage of ﬁ gural idea generation , the participants were requested to mentally complete the picture fragments of the TTCT in an original and creative way . Therefore , each picture fragment was presented on the computer screen for 2 s ( after the reference period ) , followed by an interrogation mark ( idea generation , 10 s ) . Participants were instructed to carefully look at the picture fragment , and to start thinking creatively on it when the interrogation mark appeared . After the interrogation mark ( stage of idea generation ) participants were required to draw the mentally created idea and to complete the picture fragment , by means of a stylus connected to the professional pen tablet , during a ﬁ xed time window ( 20 s ) . Four seconds before the drawing period expired , a signal tone was presented . The digitalized drawing was saved automatically after completion and served as the visual input for the following second stage of idea elaboration . C . Rominger et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 13 – 19 14 2 . 4 . Second stage – idea elaboration : Mental elaboration and improvement of the originality of the previously generated idea / drawing The stage of idea elaboration started with a white cross ( 3 s ) , fol - lowed by the presentation of the participants ’ previously generated idea ( 2 s ) . Then an interrogation mark was presented ( 10 s ) , indicating the participants ’ task to mentally elaborate and improve the originality of the initially generated idea / drawing . Following the interrogation mark , the participants ’ task was to add the elaborated ideas to the initially generated idea / drawing by means of the stylus connected to the pro - fessional pen tablet . Four seconds before this drawing phase ended , an auditory signal was delivered . The completed drawing was saved and the next trial started with a reference cross ( schematic time - course see Fig . 2 ; similar procedure see , e . g . , Fink et al . , 2009a ) . In order to gain a reliable measure of brain activation during the creation of an original picture , 10 additional picture fragments , re - sembling the original TTCT items , were constructed resulting in 30 items in total ( Version A and B of the TTCT and 10 additionally con - structed items , which were tested in a pre - study ) . All items were ran - domly presented in two blocks ( 15 items with a self - paced break in - between ; minimum break of 3 min ; about 45 min in total ) . In order to get used to the procedure , every participant explored the functions of the Wacom professional pen tablet during the time the EEG electrodes were attached . Additionally , each session started with an extensive explanation of the experiment ' s time course followed by three sample items . 2 . 5 . Measures of creative performance in the TTCT The produced drawings of the ﬁ rst stage ( initially generated ideas ) and the second stage ( elaborated ideas ) were rated by four independent raters on a four - point Likert scale ranging from “ not original ” to “ very original ” . This procedure is a common approach in creativity research ( cf . Consensual Assessment Technique ; Amabile , 1982 ; in the ﬁ gural domain see , e . g . , Rominger et al . , 2017a ) . The originality ratings showed good interrater reliability for the initially generated ideas ( ICC = . 76 ) and for the elaborated ideas ( ICC = . 77 ) . Fig . 1 . Application of professional pen tablet during the EEG - recording . ( This ﬁ gure is included with permission of pictured person . ) Fig . 2 . Schematic time course of the computerized TTCT . A 13s time period out of the 15s ﬁ xation cross period served as the reference interval ( R ) . A time period of 8s out of 10s served as the activation interval for the two phases of creative ideation , respectively ( A 1 , idea generation ; A 2 , idea elaboration ) . All TTCT items were shown for 2s each . C . Rominger et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 13 – 19 15 2 . 6 . EEG recordings and analysis The EEG was recorded by 19 active electrodes , positioned according to the 10 – 20 system with a common EEG ampli ﬁ er ( Brainvision actiCHamp Research Ampli ﬁ er , Brain Products ™ ; 1000 Hz sampling rate , low cuto ﬀ DC , high cuto ﬀ 280 Hz ) in a separate and quiet room . The ground electrode was located on the forehead , the reference elec - trodes on the nose . Vertical and horizontal electrooculograms ( EOGs ) were measured with two bipolar channels for horizontal and vertical eye movements . Electrode impedances were kept below 30 k Ω for all electrodes . The EEG signals were re - referenced to an averaged ears reference ( Hagemann , 2004 ) , down sampled to 500 Hz , and pre - processed by removing drifts and low pass ﬁ ltering ( 50 Hz ) . The g . BSanalyze software ( g . tec ™ , Graz , Austria ) was used to manually check the resulting signal for artifacts ( e . g . , eye blinks or movements and muscle tension ) and to calculate the band power values ( μ V 2 ) by squaring the ﬁ ltered EEG signals . Only band power values of artifact free time - intervals were averaged ( horizontally ) by means of the median for each single trial and period . As in other studies concerning divergent thinking ( e . g . , Benedek et al . , 2011 ; Fink et al . , 2006 ) , TRP scores were quanti ﬁ ed for upper alpha power ( 10 – 12 Hz ) for an elec - trode i by subtracting the log - transformed power of the reference period ( Pow i , reference ) from the activation period ( Pow i , activation ) for each trial j separately , according to the formula : ⎜ ⎟ = ⎛ ⎝ − ⎞ ⎠ TRP Median log ( Pow ) log ( Pow ) i i activation j i reference j , , Negative values indicate a decrease of task - related alpha power from the reference to the activation period , while positive values ex - press a power increase ( Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva , 1999 ) . In addition to the classic analysis approach of task - related changes in alpha power ( relative to a baseline ) , we calculated alpha power changes between the ﬁ rst ( i . e . , generation ) and second stage ( i . e . , ela - boration ) of the creative thinking process . This trial - related approach might be especially sensitive to capture short - term process - related power changes ( PRP , the change of activation from generation to ela - boration within a trial , separately ) in the upper alpha band , which in turn might be also associated with performance outcome . Comparing the TRP scores ( median of power changes from baseline to activation ) between the two stages ( i . e . , generation , elaboration ) might possibly not adequately capture such ﬁ ne - grained process related di ﬀ erences . Speci ﬁ cally , PRP change scores were calculated by subtracting the log - transformed power of the activation period of the ﬁ rst stage of idea generation ( Pow i , ﬁ rst idea ) from the activation period of the second stage of idea elaboration ( Pow i , elaboration ) for each trial j separately . Negative values of the PRP score indicate a relative decrease of upper alpha power from idea generation to idea elaboration . For both analysis approaches , an 8 s interval from the 10 s activation periods for the ﬁ rst stage ( idea generation ) and the second stage ( idea elaboration ) served as activation intervals ( 1 s after the onset of the interrogation mark until 1 s before the o ﬀ set ) . For the TRP analysis , a 13 s interval from the 15 s reference period served as reference interval ( from 1 s after onset of the ﬁ xation cross until 1 s before the o ﬀ set ; see Fig . 2 ) . The power changes between the reference and the activation period ( TRP ) , as well as the power changes between both activation periods ( PRP ) , in the upper alpha band ( 10 – 12 Hz ) , were computed for each electrode position and participant . Only activation periods and reference periods with at least 2 s artifact free EEG - recording were used for the statistical analyses . This procedure resulted in M = 191 . 11 s ( SD = 29 . 57 s ) artifact free EEG information during idea generation and M = 192 . 73 s ( SD = 25 . 81 s ) available EEG information during idea elaboration ( reference : M = 317 . 91 s ; SD = 39 . 93 s ) . 2 . 7 . Statistical analysis In order to evaluate if the two stages of the creative process during solving the TTCT ( i . e . , idea generation and the idea elaboration ) di ﬀ er with respect to task performance ( originality ) , a paired samples t - test with the originality ratings of the two di ﬀ erent stages of the creative process was performed . Statistical analysis of EEG data was realized by an 8 × 2 × 2 ANOVA with the within - subjects factors AREA ( eight electrode posi - tions in each hemisphere ) , HEMISPHERE ( left , right ) , and STAGE ( idea generation , idea elaboration ) , and the TRP change scores as the de - pendent variable . The impact of task performance on the EEG results was investigated by additionally considering the continuous between - subjects variable originality of the elaborated ideas in the ANOVA de - sign . In order to explore more ﬁ ne - grained associations between process - related power changes from the stage of idea generation to idea ela - boration and task performance , an ANOVA with AREA and HEMISPH - ERE as within - subjects variables , the originality of the elaborated ideas as continuous between - subjects variable , and the PRP change scores as the dependent variable was run . For illustration of interaction e ﬀ ects between AREA and the continuous between - subjects variable , predicted PRP scores were calculated for one standard deviation below and one standard deviation above the sample mean of task performance ( ori - ginality of elaborated ideas ) using standard regression analysis . In case of violations of sphericity assumptions , the multivariate approach was used ( see Vasey and Thayer , 1987 ) . Post - hoc comparisons were performed using Tukey ' s Honestly Signi ﬁ cant Di ﬀ erences ( HSD ) tests . A signi ﬁ cance level of p < . 05 ( two - tailed ) was used for all analyses . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Behavioral results The paired samples t - test indicated that the elaborated pictures / drawings were rated as being more original ( M = 2 . 10 , SD = . 31 ) than the pictures participants generated during the ﬁ rst stage of the ex - periment ( M = 1 . 54 , SD = . 25 ; t ( 49 ) = − 25 . 88 , p < . 001 ) . 3 . 2 . EEG results 3 . 2 . 1 . Task - related changes in alpha power during ﬁ gural creative ideation The 8 × 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed a signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ect AREA ( F ( 7 , 43 ) = 3 . 36 , p = . 006 , η p2 = . 11 ) , indicating decreased alpha power during ﬁ gural creative ideation especially over posterior cortical sites ( P7 / 8 , see Fig . 3 ) . The main e ﬀ ect HEMISPHERE ( F ( 1 , 49 ) = 10 . 47 , p = . 002 , η p2 = . 18 ) indicated stronger alpha power decreases over left - Fig . 3 . General pattern of TRP and error bars ( SE ) in the upper alpha band during ﬁ gural creative ideation . C . Rominger et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 13 – 19 16 ( M = − . 021 , SE = . 009 ) than right - hemispheric sites ( M = − . 002 , SE = . 010 , see Fig . 3 ) . The interaction AREA x HEMISPHERE was not signi ﬁ cant ( F ( 7 , 43 ) = 1 . 19 , p = . 33 ) . As evident in the signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ect STAGE ( F ( 1 , 49 ) = 4 . 22 , p = . 045 , η p2 = . 08 ) , idea generation ( M = − . 020 , SE = . 012 ) was associated with stronger alpha power decreases than idea elaboration ( M = − . 003 , SE = . 008 ) . The interaction AREA × STAGE ( F ( 7 , 43 ) = 3 . 57 , p = . 004 , η p2 = . 10 ) revealed that the di ﬀ erence was driven by comparatively strong power decreases during idea generation ( vs . elaboration ) at parietal and occipital sites ( post - hoc comparisons revealed signi ﬁ cant STAGE related di ﬀ erences only at P3 / 4 , P7 / 8 , and O1 / 2 ; see Fig . 4 ) . No further e ﬀ ect involving the within - subjects factor STAGE was signi ﬁ cant . 3 . 2 . 2 . Alpha power changes during ﬁ gural creative ideation as a function of task performance ( originality of elaborated ideas ) The ANOVA with task - related power changes in the upper alpha band as dependent variable revealed no signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ect involving the factor task performance . In contrast , the ANOVA with the process - re - lated power changes in the upper alpha band ( generation vs . elabora - tion ) as dependent variable showed a signi ﬁ cant interaction between the originality factor and AREA ( F ( 7 , 42 ) = 2 . 57 , p = . 027 , η p2 = . 04 ) . As illustrated in Fig . 5 , originality in ﬁ gural creative ideation was as - sociated with relatively higher elaboration related increases of alpha power ( relative to idea generation ) over the frontal cortex ( Fp1 / 2 and F3 / 4 ) , and decreases over the central and temporal cortical sites ( C3 / 4 and T7 / 8 ) . No other e ﬀ ect involving the factor originality was sig - ni ﬁ cant . 4 . Discussion Figural creative ideation was generally associated with compara - tively strong decreases of alpha power at posterior cortical sites . These alpha power decreases were clearly more pronounced at the ﬁ rst stage of the creative thinking process while participants were required to generate a ﬁ rst draft of their ideas than at the second , elaboration stage . Elaborating on these initially drafted drawings resulted in a sig - ni ﬁ cantly lower decrease of alpha power ( corresponds to relatively more alpha power during elaboration compared to generation ) at pos - terior cortical sites . Individuals who generated more original drawings showed increased alpha power during elaboration relative to genera - tion at frontal cortical sites and at the same time , decreased alpha power at centro - temporal cortical sites . The overall pattern of ﬁ ndings clearly indicates that creative thinking in the ﬁ gural domain is associated with relatively strong de - creases in alpha power at parietal and occipital sites , re ﬂ ecting high visual processing demands during the mental generation and manip - ulation of original and creative drawings . Generally , this ﬁ nding is well in line with available EEG literature dealing with creative ideation in the ﬁ gural domain ( for review see Pidgeon et al . , 2016 ) . Petsche et al . ( 1997 ) , for instance , reported a decrease of upper alpha during mental picture creation in comparison to a resting period ( see also Razumnikova et al . , 2009 ; Volf et al . , 2010 ) . In a similar vein , Jausovec and Jausovec ( 2000 ) found increased desynchronization in the upper alpha band during a picture completion task in contrast to a verbal creative ideation task . Consistent with these studies , the current ﬁ nding of alpha power decreases at parieto - occipital sites supports the as - sumption that creative ideation in the ﬁ gural domain ( in this study predominantly during the stage of idea generation ) , is associated with various directly task - speci ﬁ c and sensory based visual mental opera - tions , like visual imagery ( Marks and Isaac , 1995 ; Petsche et al . , 1997 ) , mental rotation , spatial transformation , and imaginary manipulation of objects ( Pfurtscheller et al . , 1994 ; Riecanský and Katina , 2010 ; Sauseng et al . , 2005 ; Williams and Rippon , 1995 ) , as well as the imagination of movements ( Erlacher et al . , 2003 ; Pfurtscheller et al . , 2006 ) . In line with this , the originality of the drawings was associated with process related power decreases at centro - temporal sites from idea generation to idea elaboration ( and at the same time power increases at frontal positions ) , which might further indicate the importance of motor ima - gery ( i . e . , imagine drawing a picture ; Erlacher et al . , 2003 ; Pfurtscheller et al . , 2006 ) for creative ideation in the ﬁ gural domain , especially during the stage of idea elaboration . This interpretation is also sup - ported by recent fMRI studies , reporting the involvement of motor imagery ( i . e . , activation of premotor areas ) during ﬁ gural creativity ( Aziz - Zadeh et al . , 2013 ) as well as during music improvisation ( Bengtsson et al . , 2007 ) , which , taken as a whole , nicely corresponds to the notion that imagination is highly important during creative ideation in general ( Benedek , 2018 ; Finke et al . , 1996 ; Jung et al . , 2016 ) . However , verbal creative thinking ( e . g . , during the AUT ) was found to be associated mainly with increased alpha power at frontal and posterior cortical sites , re ﬂ ecting top - down control of sensory bottom - up stimulation and suppression of distracting information ﬂ ow from the visual system ( see , e . g . , Crespo - Garcia et al . , 2013 ; Fink and Benedek , 2014 ; Jensen et al . , 2002 ; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) . Figural creative ideation in contrast strongly relies on visual / ﬁ gural mental operations , which are associated with decreased parieto - occipital alpha power ( see , e . g . , Pfurtscheller et al . , 1994 ; Riecanský and Katina , 2010 ) . Similar to Jausovec and Jausovec ( 2000 ) , the divergence of neuro - physiological activation patterns between creative ideation in the verbal and ﬁ gural domain strongly suggests that the mental operations implicated in creative ideation are closely related to the speci ﬁ c con - tents ( i . e . , verbal vs . ﬁ gural ) and the speci ﬁ c targets ( i . e . , original as - sociation of alternative uses vs . original painting / drawing ) . Nevertheless , nicely in line with current EEG literature in the verbal creativity domain , the ﬁ ndings of this study also clearly indicate the Fig . 4 . TRP and error bars ( SE ) in the upper alpha band during the two di ﬀ erent stages of ﬁ gural creative ideation . Fig . 5 . PRP ( process - related power chances from generation to elaboration ) and error bars ( SE ) in the upper alpha band ( positive values indicate an increase of power from the phase of idea generation to the phase of idea elaboration ) . C . Rominger et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 13 – 19 17 importance of alpha power increases during creative ideation in the ﬁ gural domain . The increase of originality from idea generation to idea elaboration was paralleled by a relative increase of alpha power over parieto - occipital sites . In addition , the higher the originality of the generated drawings , the higher was the relative increase of alpha from idea generation to idea elaboration at prefrontal sites . In line with Jaarsveld et al . ( 2015 ) and Schwab et al . ( 2014 ) , who reported in - creased alpha power at later stages of the creative thinking process , these ﬁ ndings may indicate heightened internal processing demands and top - down control of external stimuli ( Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) during the later stage of idea elaboration / evaluation ( compared to idea generation ; see e . g . , Ellamil et al . , 2012 ) . This further supports the notion that di ﬀ erent stages of the creative thinking process are asso - ciated with di ﬀ erent patterns of brain activity ( see also Ellamil et al . , 2012 ) . Particularly the involvement of prefrontal areas in creative ideation is a well - known ﬁ nding in di ﬀ erent domains ( verbal : Abraham et al . , 2012 ; Fink et al . , 2009a , 2010 ; ﬁ gural : Aziz - Zadeh et al . , 2013 ; de Souza et al . , 2010 ; Ellamil et al . , 2012 ; Huang et al . , 2013 ; Kowatari et al . , 2009 ; Lustenberger et al . , 2015 ; Shamay - Tsoory et al . , 2011 ; musical : Lopata et al . , 2017 ) and di ﬀ erent contexts ( e . g . , a ﬀ ective : Fink et al . , 2017 ; Papousek et al . , 2017 ; Perchtold et al . , 2018a , 2018b ) , which strongly indicates the involvement of executive and cognitive control processes in various creativity related task demands . Especially at later stages of the creative thinking process , when individuals are evaluating and elaborating initially generated ideas , more intelligent related styles of thinking might be relevant ( Ellamil et al . , 2012 ; Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ) . Nevertheless , the current approach has also some important lim - itations . Firstly , this study did not directly compare EEG activation patterns during creative ideation in the ﬁ gural and the verbal domain . Future studies in this ﬁ eld are thus particularly challenged to examine the issue of domain speci ﬁ city vs . generality of creative ideation within one and the same experimental design . Another possible drawback of the applied methodological approach is that only two stages of the creative thinking process were examined . While idea generation and elaboration may certainly represent two important components of the creative thinking process , this somewhat arti ﬁ cial experimental setting only re ﬂ ects a limited picture of the manifold processes involved in creativity . Future research should hence also attempt to investigate creative behavior in more ecologically valid creativity tasks involving more real - life creativity demands . Taken together , the observed pattern of associations argues for a multistage view of creative ideation , where executive control ( e . g . , Benedek et al . , 2012 ; Fink et al . , 2018 ) and mental imagery ( e . g . , ela - boration and manipulation of objects ) are necessary to achieve a creative outcome ( e . g . , generative and explorative / evaluative phase of the geneplore model ; Finke et al . , 1996 ; see also Ellamil et al . , 2012 ) . The neurophysiological ﬁ ndings indicate that the process of drawing / imaging a creative and original picture might need a high degree of elaboration , composing , planning , and the imagery of concrete im - plementation of generated ideas and objects into an eventual creative composition .
