THE EFFECT OF MYOSIN ANTIBODY ON THE DIVISION OF STARFISH BLASTOMERES ISSEI MABUCHI and MAKOTO OKUNO From the Department of Biology , College of General Education , University of Tokyo , Tokyo 153 , Japan . ABSTRACT Antiserum against starfish egg myosin was produced in rabbits . Antibody specific - ity to myosin was demonstrated by Ouchterlony ' s immunodiffusion test and by immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate ( SDS ) . The latter technique showed that the antibody binds to both heavy and light chains of egg myosin . Furthermore , the antibody reacted with starfish sperm myosin and starfish adult muscle myosin at both the heavy and light chains . It did not react with bovine platelet myosin or rabbit skeletal muscle myosin in Ouchterlony ' s test ; however , a weak reaction was observed in the presence of SDS between the antibody and these myosin heavy chains . Ca - and Mg - ATPase activities of egg myosin were not affected by the antibody , but it did inhibit actin - activated ATPase activity of egg myosin . Microinjection of the antibody into blastomeres of starfish eggs at the two - cell stage was carried out . Anti - egg myosin y - globulin inhibited the subsequent cleavages at an amount of more than 0 . 3 ng when injected at interphase . The inhibition was reduced when the injection was carried out near the initiation of cleavage . At the onset of the second cleavage the antibody was not inhibitory ; however , an appropriate amount inhibited the third cleavage . Although the disappearance of the nuclear membrane was observed in the presence of the antibody , the formation of the mitotic apparatus was more or less disturbed . However , the formation of daughter nuclei seemed to be scarcely affected by the antibody except that the distance between the nuclei was signifi - cantly smaller than normal . The cortical gel contraction theory of cytokinesis first proposed by Marsland and Landau ( 22 ) has been confirmed experimentally by several workers ( 2 , 11 , 30 ) who demonstrated that measurable tension is exerted at the cleavage furrow . The discovery by Schroeder and by others that the " contractile ring " in the cleavage furrow of var - ious dividing cells is composed of numerous micro - filaments ( 1 , 4 , 38 - 40 , 42 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 48 ) strongly supported this idea . The force exerted by the cleavage furrow of various sea urchin and sand dollar eggs has been estimated to be 1 - 3 x 105 dyn / cm 2 , a value comparable to the tension devel - oped in skeletal muscle ( 14 , 30 ) . Actually , the microfilaments in the contractile ring have been identified as actin filaments in newt eggs ( 27 ) , in crane fly spermatocytes ( 6 ) , and in HeLa cells ( 41 ) by means of decoration with heavy mero - myosin ( 15 ) . The fluorescent heavy meromyosin technique has also demonstrated that actin is accu - mulated in the cleavage furrow during cell division of HeLa cells ( 35 ) . Although myosin filaments have not yet been found in the contractile ring , we have recently THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 74 , 1977 ' pages 251 - 263 251 isolated myosin from the isolated cortical layer of dividing sea urchin ( 18 ) and starfish eggs ( 19 ) . From these observations it would be reasonable to suspect that actin and myosin would interact to produce the force of constriction . To test this possibility , we produced antibodies against starfish egg myosin . These antibodies , when microinjected into starfish eggs , inhibit cleavage . MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of Myosins The starfish , Asterias amurensis L / itken , was obtained from both Akkeshi Bay and Tokyo Bay . The species was identified by Dr . R . Hayashi , Emeritus Professor of Toyama University . Eggs were collected and insemi - nated as described previously ( 19 ) . Starfish egg myosin and crude fractions of egg myosin , i . e . , 0 - 35 % and 35 - 55 % saturated ammonium sulfate fractions from the high - speed supernate of the egg extract and 0 . 2 M KCl - precipitates of the 35 - 55 % am - monium sulfate fractions , were prepared as described previously ( 20 ) . Starfish sperm myosin was prepared as described previously ( 21 ) . Bovine platelet myosin was prepared as described elsewhere ( 44 ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and actin were prepared as described by Perry ( 28 ) and by Mommaerts ( 25 ) , respectively . Muscle myosin from the tube feet of adult starfish was purified by the following method . Tube feet were de - tached from the starfish by raking off with a spatula ; they were washed once with chilled ordinary sea water and then washed once with 1 M glycerol , 10 mM NaHCOo ( pH 7 . 8 ) , and stored in 50 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol , 0 . 1 M KC1 , 2 mM MgClz , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 10 mM Sorensen ' s phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) at - 20 ~ After being stored for 1 mo , they were washed with 50 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM D ' IT , 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 0 ( buffer A ) , and homogenized in buffer A with a motor - driven Tef - lon - glass homogenizer for one to two strokes . Myofibrils were released from the tube foot ghosts by this proce - dure . The homogenates were centrifuged at 2 , 000g for 5 min . The sediment consisted of two layers ; the bottom layer containing the tube foot ghosts , the upper layer consisting mostly of myofibrils . The latter was isolated and washed twice with buffer A . To this suspension of myofibrils was added enough 3 M KCI , 50 mM phos - phate ( pH 7 . 0 ) to give a final KCl concentration of 0 . 6 M . The suspension was stirred for 1 h and then centri - fuged at 40 , 000 g for 10 min . 10 vol of chilled water were added to the supernate , and the flocculent precipi - tate formed was collected at 10 , 000 g for 10 rain , dis - solved in and dialyzed against 0 . 6 M KCI , 10 mM phos - phate , 0 . 2 mM DTT at pH 7 . 0 . This fraction was desig - nated as the tube foot actomyosin fraction . To the acto - myosin solution , enough 0 . 4 M ATP ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 M sodium pyrophosphate ( Na - PPi ) ( pH 7 . 0 ) and 0 . 1 M MgCh were added to give final concentrations of 10 mM , 2 mM , and 1 mM , respectively . The solution was then centrifuged at 260 , 000 g for 2 h to sediment the actin . The materials precipitated from the supemate at 35 - 55 % saturation with respect to ammonium sulfate were collected . This fractionation step removed both a paramyosin - like protein and the remaining actin . The ammonium sulfate fraction was subjected to gel filtration with a Sepharose 4B column ( 2 . 5 (cid:141) 90 cm ) eluting with 0 . 6 M KCI , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM MgC12 , 0 . 1 mM DTF , 10 mM Tris . HCI ( pH 7 . 4 ) as described previously ( 20 ) . ATPase activity of each fraction was measured , and the faster eluting half of the ATPase peak was pooled , concentrated by precipitation at 55 % saturation of ammonium sulfate , dissolved in 0 . 6 M KCI and fur - ther precipitated in 70 mM KCI , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 0 . This fraction was desig - nated as the tube foot myosin fraction . The slower elut - ing half of the myosin peak was contaminated by a high molecular weight protein ( see Results ) . Preparation of Antisera and y - Globulin Fraction 1 mg of egg myosin from Asterias amurensis obtained at Akkeshi Bay was dialyzed against 0 . 15 M NaCI , 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 0 , and emulsified with Freund ' s complete adjuvant . This solution was injected subcutaneously into the back of a male New Zealand white rabbit . After 2 wk , about 20 ml of blood was obtained by ear bleeding . The second injection was car - ded out as described above 4 wk after the first injec - tion . About 3 wk after the second injection , the second bleeding was carded out ( 50 ml each at intervals of several days ) . Serum was separated from plasma clots and treated at 56 ~ for 30 min . Antiserum from the first or the second bleeding was called the first or the second antiserum , respectively . Preimmune serum was taken before immunization and used in control experiments . The y - globulin fraction was obtained from the serum by an ammonium sulfate cut of 20 - 33 % saturation ; it was dissolved in 0 . 15 M KCI , 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 0 . Immunodi ffusio n and lmmunoelectrophoresis Ouchterlony ' s immunodiffusion tests were carried out in a 1 % agarose gel containing 0 . 6 M KCI and 10 mM Na - PPi ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The well volume was 30 tzl . Immunoelectrophoresis was carded out according to Obinata et al . ( 26 ) with some modifications : a 4 % aga - rose gel plate ( 7 . 4 x 8 . 5 cm ) containing 0 . 05 % SDS ; 0 . 1 M Tris , 0 . 4 M boric acid ( pH 7 . 3 ) was used . The applica - bility of immunoelectrophoresis with antiserum ( not fractionated antibody ) t in the presence of dilute SDS was ' After Masaki ( personal communication ) , fractionated y - globulin or IgG is not applicable to this technique . A possible " chelating effect " of albumin on SDS to protect antibodies from SDS is considered . 252 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 74 , 1977 first shown by Masaki ( 23 ) . Antigen fractions were pre - viously dialyzed against 8 M urea , 0 . 5 % SDS , 0 . 1 M / 3 - mercaptoethanol , 5 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris . HCI ( pH 8 . 5 ) overnight and then against 0 . 05 % SDS , 0 . 1 M Tris , 0 . 4 M boric acid , 5 mM DqT for 2 h . Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 v for about 2 h with bromphenol blue as a tracking dye . Duplicates were always run . After electrophoresis , one plate was immediately stained with 0 . 04 % Amido black dissolved in 10 % ( vol / vol ) acetic acid , 40 % ( vol / vol ) methanol to assure the position of migrated protein subunits . The other plate was used for immunodiffusion . Antisera were placed in narrow troughs ( 1 mm - wide ) made on the gel and the plate was left standing at 4 ~ Two days were sufficient to obtain complete immunoprecipitation . Analytical Methods Disc electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was car - ded out with a Tris - glycine system ( 18 ) in 4 % or 5 % acrylamide gels polymerized with ammonium persulfate . ATPase activities were assayed at 25 ~ as described previously ( 20 ) . In brief , Ca - ATPase activity was as - sayed in 0 . 6 M KCI , 5 mM CaClz , 1 mM ATP and 10 mM piperazine - N , N ' - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic add ) . NaOH buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) . Actin - activated ATPase activity was assayed in 75 mM KC1 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM ATP , and 20 mM Tris . maleate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) . Protein concentration was determined by the proce - dure of Lowry et al . ( 17 ) , using bovine serum albumin as a standard . Turbidity of a solution was measured at 660 nm , using a Hitachi 101 spectrophotometer . Microinjection of Antibody into the Living Egg Fertilized eggs ofAsterias amurensis were cultured for 1 . 5 h in a petri dish at 20 - 1 ~ At various stages before the onset of the second cleavage , one of the blastomeres was microinjected with anti - egg myosin y - globulin frac - tion from the second antiserum or the preimmune ~ / - globulin fraction , while the other blastomere served as a control . The method of microinjection was fundamen - tally the same as Hiramoto ' s ( 13 , 33 ) . The concentration of the 3 , - globulin fraction microinjected was 27 - 53 rag / ml . The volume of the solution injected was 0 . 4 - 3 . 0 x 10 - a ml which corresponds to 0 . 8 - 6 % of the cell volume . To determine the diffusibility of the injected protein in the cytoplasm ; fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled goat IgG ( FITC - IgG ) was injected into the cell and its diffu - sion was observed under a Nikon FL fluorescence micro - scope . Chemicals and Biochemicals The chemicals and their sources are as follows : ATP ( Kyowa Hakko Kogyo , Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) , agarose ( Agarose Pure , Koch - Light Laboratories , Ltd . , Colnbrook , Bucks , Eng . ) , Freund ' s complete adjuvant ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , Mich . ) , FITC - IgG ( Miles Laboratories , Inc . , Miles Research Products , Elkhart , Ind . ) , SDS ( Wako Pure Chemical Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) . Other reagents used were all of analytical grade . Water was deionized and glass - distilled . RESULTS Disc Gel Electrophoresis of Myosins from Several Sources The electrophoretic pattern of Asterias egg myosin is shown in Fig . la . As described previ - ously ( 20 ) , it consists of a 210 , 000 - dalton heavy chain and two classes of light chains of about 20 , 000 dalton . The Asterias sperm myosin frac - tion ( Fig . 1 b ) has similar bands but also contains impurities because the gel filtration step was omit - ted in the purification procedure ( 21 ) . Bovine platelet myosin ( Fig . I c ) and rabbit skeletal mus - cle myosin ( Fig . 1 d ) fractions revealed protein bands consistent with those of earlier reports ( 16 , 29 , 37 ) . An actomyosin fraction prepared from the tube feet of Asterias contains as major components ( Fig . 1 e ) two high molecular weight proteins ( one about 300 , 000 dalton ) , a myosin heavy chain , a paramyosin - like protein ( 110 , 000 dalton ) , a 55 , 000 - dalton protein , actin , and myosin light chains . After purification , the tube foot myosin fraction consists mainly of the heavy chain and two classes of light chains ( Fig . l f ) . The 300 , 000 - dalton high molecular weight protein runs slower than myosin in the agarose gel column and , there - fore , could be purified ( Fig . 1 g ) . ATPase activity was not detected in this fraction , and properties of the protein were not investigated further in this work . From the co - electrophoresis experiments on 4 % acrylamide gels , it was found that the heavy chains of Asterias egg myosin , sperm myosin , tube foot myosin , and bovine platelet myosin co - mi - grated with one another with a mobility slower than that of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin . Properties of Antibody against Asterias Egg Myosin Ouchterlony ' s immunodiffusion tests were car - ded out applying 0 . 6 , 0 . 8 , or 1 . 1 mg egg myosin per milliliter in the central well . A single precipitin line was observed in all cases and was detectable even if the antiserum from the second bleeding ( 3 wk after the second injection ; the second antise - rum ) was diluted to 1 / 32 and egg myosin applied in MABUCHI AND OKUNO Effect of Myosin Antibody on Starfish Blastomere Division 2S3 FmURE 1 SDS - gel electrophoresis of myosins .

Immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of SDS showed that the second antiserum contained anti - bodies against both the heavy and light chains ( Fig . 3 a ) . We could not estimate whether both the light chains or one of the two light chains reacted with the antibodies because the separation of the light chains in 4 % agarose gel was not dear . However , the first antiserum contained antibodies only to the heavy chain ( Fig . 3b ) . The second 254 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 74 , 1977 FmuR ~ 3 Immunoelectrophoresis experiments .

MABUCHI AND OKUNO Effect of Myosin Antibody on Starfish Blastomere Division 255 antiserum did not contain antibodies to proteins other than egg myosin . This was confirmed when immunoelectrophoresis was carried out with crude egg myosin fractions , i . e . , 0 - 35 % and 35 - 55 % saturated ammonium sulfate fractions and 0 . 2 M KCI precipitates ( Fig . 3a ) . In addition , myosin could not be detected in the 0 - 35 % saturated ammonium sulfate fraction by this method . The second antiserum did not contain antibodies to other muscle proteins which was revealed by im - munoelectrophoresis of the tube foot actomyosin fraction ( not shown ) . For the reasons mentioned above , the second antiserum was used in the experiments described below . Anti - egg myosin reacted with sperm myosin in a manner similar to egg myosin both by Ouchterlony ' s test ( Fig . 2c ) and by immunoelec - trophoresis ( Fig . 3 c ) . The precipitin lines in the Ouchterlony ' s test fused with each other when the antigen wells were placed closer ( not shown ) . The reaction between the anti - egg myosin and tube foot myosin was curious . The antibody against egg myosin of Akkeshi Bay Asterias reacted with the tube foot myosin of Tokyo Bay Asterias in Ouch - terlony ' s test ( Fig . 2 d ) and in immunoelectropho - resis ( Fig . 3d ) as it did in the case of sperm myosin . The latter experiment showed both the heavy and light chains to be reactive . However , no precipitin line was observed between the tube foot myosin of Akkeshi Bay Asterias and anti - egg myosin ( same starfish ) in the Ouchterlony ' s test ( Fig . 2e ) . In the presence of SDS , both chains became reactive but the precipitin lines that formed were weaker than those with tube foot myosin of Tokyo Bay Asterias ( Fig . 3 d ) . A ~ ome - what similar result was obtained with bovine plate - let myosin or rabbit skeletal muscle myosin . These myosins did not react with the antibody in the Ouchterlony ' s test ( Fig . 2f ) , but formed a weak precipitin line with the antibody only at the heavy chain position in the immunoelectrophoresis ( Figs . 3e and 3f ) . These precipitin lines were not of nonspecific precipitation since no line was ob - served between the heavy chains and preimmune serum ( Figs . 3 d and 3 e ) . Effect of Anti - Egg Myosin on the Egg Myosin A TPase Activity When the antiserum was added to the egg myosin solution in 0 . 6 M KCI , the turbidity of the solution increased with increasing amounts of added antiserum ( Fig . 4 ) .

The antibody against egg myosin did not seem to affect the Ca - ATPase activity . Even when all myosin molecules were covered by the antibodies to form precipitable complexes , more than 90 % of the activity re - mained ( Fig . 4 ) . The effect of the antibody on actin - myosin in - teractions was studied by examining whether or not anti - egg myosin y - globulin fraction inhibits actin - activated egg myosin ATPase activity . As shown in Table I , actin - activated egg myosin ATP - ase activity was inhibited with increasing y - globu - lin fraction of the antiserum and the inhibition was complete at a y - globulin : egg myosin weight ratio of 400 : 8 . The y - globulin fraction from preimmune serum did not inhibit the actin - activated ATPase activity significantly . The antibody had no effect on the Mg - ATPase activity of egg myosin in the absence of actin ( Table I ) .

As shown in Fig . 5 , the mi - croinjected FITC - IgG diffused into the entire cy - toplasm after about 1 rain . Therefore , it seems likely that there was no problem in the diffusion of the y - globulin injected . A detailed analysis on the diffusion of proteins in the cytoplasm of marine eggs will be presented elsewhere . Z Under the experimental conditions employed in this study , eggs completed the first cell division 2 h after fertilization . The blastomeres in which the interphase nuclei were clearly recognized were microinjected . The duration of the interphase be - tween the first and second divisions , where inter - phase nuclei were visible , was about 40 min . The second division took place 15 min after the disap - pearance of the nuclear membrane . The results of the microinjection experiments are summarized in Table II . Microinjection of preimmune y - globulin fraction had no effect on cell division at any stage tested and with any quan - tity of the injected proteins tested ( Fig . 6 ) , except that division was retarded by about 10 min as compared with the noninjected blastomere ( Fig . 6c ) . This delay seemed to be caused by the inju - rious effect of the microinjection because a similar delay was observed when 0 . 15 M KCI , 10 mM phosphate was injected . 20kuno , M . , in preparation . Microinjection of more than 0 . 3 ng of anti - egg myosin y - globulin at interphase inhibited the sec - ond cleavage furrow formation as well as subse - quent ones ( Fig . 7 ) . Only one out of 24 cells tested formed a furrow . In this cell the furrow soon regressed , however . The inhibitory effect of less than 0 . 2 ng of y - globulin was incomplete . After the disappearance of the nuclear membrane , the quantity of anti - egg myosin y - globulin that is nec - essary to inhibit cleavage in about half of the cells increased to around 0 . 4 - 0 . 5 ng . When it was in - jected just before furrowing or at the onset of cleavage , the cleavage furrow rapidly regressed in a small number of cells . In a majority of cells , however , the amount of antibody used in this experiment ( up to 0 . 5 ng ) did not prevent cleav - age . In these experiments , when the amount of injected y - globulin was below 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 ng , the third cleavage also occurred , but more y - globulin prevented the third cleavage even though it did not prevent the second cleavage ( data not shown ) . In cases where anti - egg myosin y - globulin failed to prevent cleavage , nuclear division was normal . Likewise , normal nuclear divisions were observed when a preimmune y - globulin fraction was in - jected . The effect of the antibody on nuclear divi - sion was investigated in 17 blastomeres which failed to cleave following antibody injection be - fore the dissolution of the nuclear membrane . In the presence of the antibody , dissolution of the nuclear membrane occurred in all the cells after a brief delay ( about 10 min ) . Five cells did not develop further and did not form asters . The 12 remaining cells formed a mitotic apparatus . This apparatus was smaller and more obscure than that of control cells , however . Formation of daughter nuclei was observed in 9 out of the 12 cells ( Fig . 8a ) . The center - to - center distance between the daughter nuclei was 20 - 30 txm . In control cells or cells arrested ( Fig . 8b ) by antibody injection after the disappearance of the nuclear membrane , the separation of the daughter nuclei was about 60 / zm . DISCUSSION Properties of the Antibody against Starfish Egg Myosin In Asterias amurensis from Akkeshi Bay the antibody against egg myosin did not react with the tube foot muscle myosin in 0 . 6 M KCI . This result may be interpreted as indicating that the cytoplas - mic myosin differs from muscle myosin in this MAauCnl AND OKUNO Effect of Myosin Antibody on Starfish Blastomere DiviMon 257 258 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY (cid:12)9 VOLUME 74 , 1977 species . Sperm myosin from the same starfish re - acted with the antibody either in 0 . 6 M KCI or in 0 . 05 % SDS . In the latter experiment , the anti - body reacted with both the heavy chain and the light chains of sperm myosin as in the case of egg myosin . Moreover , there was no difference in the serological properties between the Tokyo and the Akkeshi preparations of gamete myosin . How - ever , tube foot myosin from the Tokyo Bay Aster - / as had the same serological properties as egg myosin of the starfish from Akkeshi Bay . Such a difference between these tube foot myosins in different populations of the same species is diffi - cult to explain at present . The reactions between the antibody against egg myosin and the Akkeshi tube foot myosin , bovine platelet myosin or rabbit skeletal muscle myosin are intriguing as no reaction was observed in dou - ble diffusion on agarose containing 0 . 6 M KCI , yet in the presence of SDS the heavy chain reacted with the antibody . Since the heavy chain is a large polypeptide , there may be many antigenic sites . It is possible that the antigenic sites of the heavy chains of these myosins , which are similar to those of egg myosin , are not localized on the surface of these heavy chains but inside of them and are masked in 0 . 6 M KC1 and unmasked by SDS . The weakness of the precipitin line when compared with that formed by the egg myosin - antibody com - plex might be due to the fact that these antigenic sites , similar to those of egg myosin , are few in these myosin heavy chains . The Ca - and Mg - ATPase activities of egg myosin were not affected by the binding of the antibodies . This means that the enzymatically ac - tive regions of these molecules are not covered by the antibodies . However , since the actin - egg myosin interaction was prevented by the antibod - ies , these antibodies must attach to sites near the active centers , thereby sterically inhibiting the FI6URE 5 Diffusion of FITC - IgG within the cell .

F , cleavage furrow formed but regressed . N , cleavage furrow was not formed . binding of actin but not interfering with the associ - ation of small molecules such as ATP with the active centers . Effect of Antibody on Cell Division In Vivo More than 0 . 3 ng of anti - egg myosin y - globulin inhibited cleavage furrow formation when injected at interphase . After the disappearance of the nu - clear membrane , it was still capable of preventing cleavage although the inhibitory power was lessened . From these experiments , it is reasonable to conclude that myosin is involved in cytokinesis . The egg myosin content of an Asterias egg cor - tex at metaphase - anaphase of the first division has been estimated to be 0 . 58 x 108 molecules ( 19 ) , which corresponds to 0 . 05 ng . Assuming that the egg myosin is localized mainly in the cortical layer at this stage and that during division each daughter cell receives half the myosin molecules , the weight ratio of injected y - globulin ( 0 . 3 ng ) to egg myosin is about 10 : 1 . From Table I , about half of the actin - activated ATPase activity of egg myosin was suppressed by about 10 times the amount of anti - egg myosin y - globulin . This value seems to be in good agreement with the amount necessary to inhibit cleavage in vivo . In a recent report ( 8 ) , antibodies prepared against myosin were shown to be localized in the cleavage furrow as well as in the polar regions of the mitotic apparatus of human cells . The pres - ence of myosin in the furrow region is consist - ent with the concept that the mechanism of cytoki - nesis involves interactions between actin and myosin . Thus , antibodies against myosin mole - cules inhibit cleavage by interacting with a major component of the contractile ring . There are four different ways by which the myosin antibody could prevent cleavage . ( a ) It has been reported ( 31 ) that damage to the mitotic apparatus prevents formation of the cleavage fur - row ; or if the asters are reduced by chemical treatment of sea urchin eggs , these eggs are then unable to cleave . In our experiments we also ob - served that the mitotic apparatus was smaller than normal when the antibody was injected at inter - phase ( this will be discussed in detail later ) . Thus , the antibody may directly interfere with cleavage furrow formation by interacting with the mitotic apparatus . However , we also observed that the antibody prevented cleavage in about half of the cells although the mitotic apparatus was of normal size ( see Fig . 8 b ) when the antibody was injected after disappearance of the nuclear membrane . Thus , this possibility for the effect of the antibody on cleavage may be eliminated . ( b ) The antibody may prevent cleavage by interfering with the sig - nal ( cleavage stimulus ) which is transmitted from the mitotic apparatus to the equatorial cortical layer to induce cleavage furrow formation ( 10 , 32 ) . The signal may not be a diffusible substance since it must accumulate in the narrow equatorial region . If it were calcium ions ( 47 ) , they might be translocated in a membrane - bound or protein - bound form . If the signal is attacked by the anti - body , it may consist of myosin aggregates ( see below ) which are to be incorporated into the con - tractile ring . There is no evidence for or against such a possibility . ( c ) The antibody binds and inactivates myosin molecules when they are in the cytoplasm . In an 260 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 74 , 1977 earlier study ( 20 ) , egg myosin formed small fila - mentous aggregates ( 5 - 10 nm wide and 0 . 16 t ~ m long ) at an ionic strength of 0 . 4 and bipolar thick filaments ( 10 - 15 nm wide and about 0 . 25 ~ m long ) at an ionic strength of 0 . 35 . Therefore , even if the intracellular ionic strength of marine eggs were rather high , egg myosin might be in an aggre - gated state in vivo , although these filaments would be indistinguishable from actin filaments as seen by electron microscopy of thin sections . Fujiwara and Pollard ' s observation ( 8 ) that myosin is accu - mulated in the cleavage furrow suggests the possi - bility that these filaments might move from the deeper cytoplasm to the equatorial cortical layer during mitosis . The antibody may attack the myosin molecules before or during the accumula - tion . Even if these myosin filaments could subse - quently accumulate at the equatorial cortical layer , they could not function since the antibody attached to myosin molecules would inhibit the actin - myosin interaction . ( d ) The antibody attacks myosin molecules in the established contractile ring to stop their func - tion . However , this possibility may be excluded since the antibody was less or ineffective when injected just before cleavage or after initiation of furrow formation when , at least in the latter case , the contractile ring is already formed ( 40 ) . This result could , however , be explained by assuming that the structure of the contractile ring itself or the surrounding cytoplasmic gel layer protects myosin filaments from the invasion of the antibod - ies . It has recently been reported that actin ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 36 ) and myosin ( 8 , 24 ) are present in the mitotic or meiotic spindles . However , the function of these proteins in the spindle is not known . Our experiments showed that anti - egg myosin might affect nuclear division to some extent . Five cells out of 17 did not form asters , and the mitotic apparatus formed in the rest of the cells was small and obscure . This mean that the formation of the mitotic apparatus was more or less disturbed by the antibody . Once the mitotic apparatus was formed in the presence of the antibody , the maior - ity of the cells formed daughter nuclei . This result suggests that the antibody has little effect on chro - mosomal separation and nuclear membrane for - mation . The closeness of the daughter nuclei formed might be due to the fact that the mitotic apparatus formed was smaller than that in normal cells . The idea that myosin may not be involved in chromosomal separation is supported by the re - suits reported by Sakai et al . ( 34 ) who have shown that chromosome motion in vitro induced by Mg - ATP in the isolated mitotic apparatus of sea ur - chin or starfish eggs was not inhibited by egg myosin antibody but inhibited by sperm flagellar dynein antibody .
