The Gender Citation Gap in International Relations Daniel Maliniak , Ryan Powers , and Barbara F + Walter Abstract This article investigates the extent to which citation and publication patterns differ between men and women in the international relations ~ IR ! literature + Using data from the Teaching , Research , and International Policy project on peer - reviewed publications between 1980 and 2006 , we show that women are systemati - cally cited less than men after controlling for a large number of variables including year of publication , venue of publication , substantive focus , theoretical perspective , methodology , tenure status , and institutional afﬁliation + These results are robust to a variety of modeling choices + We then turn to network analysis to investigate the extent to which the gender of an article’s author affects that article’s relative centrality in the network of citations between papers in our sample + Articles authored by women are systematically less central than articles authored by men , all else equal + This is likely because ~ 1 ! women tend to cite themselves less than men , and ~ 2 ! men ~ who make up a disproportionate share of IR scholars ! tend to cite men more than women + This is the ﬁrst study in political science to reveal signiﬁcant gender differences in citation patterns and is especially meaningful because citation counts are increas - ingly used as a key measure of research’s quality and impact + To what extent—if any—are articles in international relations ~ IR ! cited differ - ently depending on the gender of the publication’s author ? 1 We address this ques - tion by analyzing citation patterns in the IR literature , using data from the Teaching , We thank Karen Alter , Tim Büthe , Peter Gourevitch , Zoltan Hajnal , Kelly Kadera , Bob Keohane , David Lake , Lisa Martin , Rose McDermott , Andrew Moravcsik , Sara Mitchell , Maya Oren , Maggie Peters , Jaime Settle , and two anonymous reviewers for invaluable comments + We also thank the Insti - tute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations at the College of William and Mary for providing research assistance + Powers acknowledges support from the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship under Grant No + DGE - 0718123 + Supplementary materials for this article are avail - able at http : 00 dx + doi + org 0 10 + 1017 0 S00208183000209 + 1 + In this article we use the term gender rather than sex to refer to our male 0 female variable + We realize that the two terms are not synonymous , nor is gender dichotomous + We prefer to use the term gender because the coding of the author of a publication is based heavily on the pronouns an author uses to identify him - or herself + The result , however , is that we are unable to include a category for transgendered scholars + We regret this + Still , because of the fact that transgendered individuals make up such a small proportion of the total population of IR scholars , any analysis of citation patterns of articles authored by transgendered individuals would be unreliable at best + International Organization 67 , Fall 2013 , pp + 889 – 922 © 2013 by The IO Foundation + doi : 10 + 1017 0 S0020818313000209 h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / S 00208183130 0 0209 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

Research , and International Policy ~ TRIP ! project + 2 We use the TRIP project’s journal article database , which catalogues articles published in the top twelve peer - reviewed IR journals over the period 1980 – 2006 + 3 The TRIP project has coded approximately 3 , 000 articles on twenty - six different substantive and demo - graphic variables + Using these data , we demonstrate the existence of a persis - tent gender gap in citation counts : articles written by women are consistently cited less than articles written by men + This is especially true of women who have not yet earned tenure + Observable differences between male and female IR scholars—including productivity , institutional afﬁliation , publication venue , or epistemology—cannot account for this gap + We explore the gender citation gap further through an analysis of men and women in the network formed by cita - tions between the articles in our sample + Using a dyadic citation data set built from the TRIP data and the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge ~ WOK ! data - base , we show that women are also more concentrated on the periphery of the IR network , where their work is cited less often by authors of the most heavily cited work + Taken together , these ﬁndings offer robust evidence for a gender gap in citation counts in IR + This is a cause for concern + If women in IR are systematically cited less than men in ways that do not appear to be associated with observable differ - ences in their scholarship , and if citation counts continue to be used as a key mea - sure of research impact , then women will be disadvantaged in tenure , promotion , and salary decisions + This article reveals this differential pattern of citation counts and offers two potential explanations for it + Our hope is that by identifying the gender gap in citations and then identifying potential reasons for it , we can begin to address and rectify it + Gender and the IR Literature The status of women in academia and political science has long been a topic of discussion and concern at colleges and universities across the United States + 4 Women continue to be underrepresented on political science faculty , at confer - ences , and in peer - reviewed publications + 5 Today , women are earning PhDs in polit - 2 + The TRIP Project is managed by the Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Rela - tions at the College of William and Mary + It gathers data to enable scholars to better understand the development and current state of the discipline of IR and to what extent IR research informs or is informed by the international policymaking process + For more information , see ^ http : 00 irtheoryandpractice + wm + edu 0 projects 0 trip 0 & , accessed 8 May 2013 + 3 + The TRIP project identiﬁed the “top” journals on the basis of their impact rating + The database itself contains bibliographic data on all articles up to 2010 , but articles have been systematically coded and arbitrated only through 2006 + 4 + See Schuck 1969 ; Finifter 1973 ; Gruberg and Sapiro 1979 ; and Charles and Grusky 2005 + 5 + See American Political Science Association ~ APSA ! 1992 ; and Gruberg and Sapiro 1979 + 890 International Organization h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / S 00208183130 0 0209 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

Analysis Using the data we described , we test the extent to which each of our independent variables affects citation counts + 39 Our estimates are based on a negative - binomial model because of clear overdispersion in the citation count variable + In all cases , we include our main independent variables of interest , an all female and a mixed gender variable , with all male as the reference category + 40 To account for poten - tial idiosyncrasies across publication years in the data , we include year ﬁxed - effects + Moreover , we exclude articles published later than 2006 so that each article has at least ﬁve years of exposure to possible citations by the time we gathered the counts + We also include the age of the article ~ in years ! and a quadratic of age to help control both for exposure but also the changing nature of citation patterns over time + In our baseline model in Table 2 , the all female variable is negative and sta - tistically signiﬁcant + Given that the coefﬁcient represents the natural log of the expected count of citations , we can interpret this as female - authored articles receiv - ing roughly 80 percent of the citations that a similar male - authored article would receive + Articles having at least one male and one female author show no statisti - cally signiﬁcant difference in citations from male - only authored articles + Adding controls for age , in Model 2 , we see unsurprisingly that older articles receive more citations than younger articles , but that this effect declines over time + The effect of article age slightly reduces the magnitude of our gender effect , but it does not affect its direction or statistical signiﬁcance + In Model 3 of Table 2 , we explore the extent to which accounting for career - related factors helps explain the gender gap in citation counts + As noted , women in the ﬁeld of IR are less likely to be employed by R1 institutions + We account for institutional afﬁliation by including a variable that captures whether any of the authors are employed at an R1 institution + 41 In this model , R1 afﬁliation has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on citation counts + Because we also noted how coauthorship differs across gender , we add a variable to account for whether a given article is coauthored + Coauthorship has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on 39 + A number of the explanations that we suggest may themselves be affected by similar gender biases to those that lead women to be cited less once their research is published + Women may choose to attend particular graduate programs , study particular topics , work at particular institutions , publish in particular journals , and get promoted at different rates as a result of subtle or overt gender - based pressures + If that is the case and these factors contribute to the citation gap , then controlling for these intermediate factors in an analysis of any potential gender bias in citations is not appropriate ~ King , Keohane , and Verba 1994 ! + Since we have a strong expectation about the direction of the bias thanks to other recent literature , we include these potentially posttreatment variables to illustrate the magni - tude of the gender bias more clearly + That is to say , we ﬁnd a gender effect even after controlling for a wide variety of potentially posttreatment variables + 40 + The results are qualitatively similar when we include only an all female dummy variable or a measure of the percent of authors who are female + 41 + Our results are similar if we control for being a member of a top - twenty institution as deﬁned by the most recent US News and World Report rankings of IR graduate programs + The Gender Citation Gap in International Relations 899 h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / S 00208183130 0 0209 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

To address this , we propose the use of network analysis as a better measure of the impact of female authors on the ﬁeld + This additional analysis measures impact much better than a simple citation count + Network analy - sis not only incorporates how many citations an article gets but also whether an article is cited by more inﬂuential articles + It is far more important to be cited in a seminal article than it is to be cited in an obscure one + To measure the relative inﬂuence of a given article we employ the widely used HITS algorithm developed by Kleinberg + 45 HITS calculates a hub score and author - ity score for each node in the network + Kleinberg’s method was developed to mea - sure the relative importance of nodes in the world’s largest “citation” network : the Internet + 46 A given node garners authority by being linked to by other nodes + More weight is placed on a link from a node that itself is linked to by many other nodes + To put it in the parlance of citation analysis , an article that is cited by many widely cited articles will have a higher authority score than an article cited by many arti - cles that themselves are only rarely cited + Using the network of citations produced by the twelve journals in the TRIP article - coding database , we calculate the “authority” score for all articles cited by at least one other article in the largest cluster of articles + 47 These values range from 0 to 1 , with 1 being the most highly authoritative article , and 0 having no authority + We take the largest value an article achieves in any year of its publica - tion + In this sense , we are looking to see if an article ever becomes highly inﬂu - ential over the entire period of our sample + Our results largely mimic those of the citation count models presented earlier + Articles written by female authors are not only being cited less , but authors of the most inﬂuential articles are citing them less often + Table 4 presents the results of similar models to those used in the citation analysis using ordinary least squares ~ OLS ! models + 48 In this sense , we should expect that the position of articles writ - ten by women is more to the periphery of the IR citation network + This ﬁnding can be seen in Figure 2 , which highlights authorship by gender across the network plotted in space + Each circle represents an article + The size of the circle is proportional to its authority score + Articles written by female author ~ s ! 45 + Kleinberg 1999 + The HITS algorithm is perhaps better than degree centrality and is a form of eigenvector centrality that makes use of both inward and outward links in the network + See Fowler , Grofman , and Masuoka 2007 ; Fowler and Aksnes 2007 ; and Lupu and Voeten 2012 + 46 + In 1998 , several researchers at Stanford developed an algorithm similar to Kleinberg’s for use in ranking search engine results + Their method would eventually be known as Google PageRank + 47 + The largest cluster is that group of articles within which one could get from any one article to any other via citations , and has the largest number of articles total + We use the largest cluster because our measure takes into account only those articles that have at least one tie to another , connected arti - cle + We cannot calculate a centrality value for those single articles or groups of articles that are uncon - nected to this largest cluster + By deﬁnition , the articles we lose are the most peripheral , since they are not cited by any articles in the largest cluster , and do not cite any of those within the largest cluster + 48 + The results are robust to a number of other modeling choices , including the use of a tobit model + The Gender Citation Gap in International Relations 907 h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / S 00208183130 0 0209 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

Simply making authors aware of this tendency and identifying it when it occurs could help nar - row the gap + Some of the factors we discuss may be relatively easy to ﬁx—such as the ten - dency for women in IR to cite themselves less + Some will be more difﬁcult to ﬁx—such as the tendency of individuals to cite members of their own gender + All require additional research to understand why these patterns exist and why indi - viduals behave this way + This article says nothing about other systematic ways in which women might be disadvantaged in IR and in academia more generally + A similar study , for example , has not yet been done on whether a gender bias exists in hiring and promotion , or whether a bias exists in rates of submission and accep - tance at top journals + Are articles written by women treated differently in the pub - lication review process ? Until we know the full range of bias that exists , it will be difﬁcult to fully reach gender parity on campuses across the country + Our ﬁrst hope is that this study serves as a catalyst for additional research into the subtle and not - so - subtle barriers that may stand in the way of women rising through the ranks in any ﬁeld historically dominated by men + We also hope that it helps pave the way for real changes in how universities mentor , support , and pro - mote women + We are not the ﬁrst to talk about bias in academia + The challenge has always been to prove that it exists + This study shows that it exists in at least one area related to women’s advancement in the ﬁeld : citations + If colleges and 62 + Some journals already do this + 920 International Organization h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / S 00208183130 0 0209 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .
