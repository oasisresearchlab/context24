Two endosome populations involved in recy - cling of membranes and receptors to the plasma mem - brane have been described , the early and the recycling endosome . However , this distinction is mainly based on the ﬂow of cargo molecules and the spatial distribution of these membranes within the cell . To get insights into the membrane organization of the recycling pathway , we have studied Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 , three regula - tory components of the transport machinery . Following transferrin as cargo molecule and GFP - tagged Rab pro - teins we could show that cargo moves through distinct domains on endosomes . These domains are occupied by different Rab proteins , revealing compartmentalization within the same continuous membrane . Endosomes are comprised of multiple combinations of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 domains that are dynamic but do not signiﬁ - cantly intermix over time . Three major populations were observed : one that contains only Rab5 , a second with Rab4 and Rab5 , and a third containing Rab4 and Rab11 . These membrane domains display differential pharmacological sensitivity , reﬂecting their biochemical and functional diversity . We propose that endosomes are organized as a mosaic of different Rab domains cre - ated through the recruitment of speciﬁc effector pro - teins , which cooperatively act to generate a restricted environment on the membrane . Key words : endocytosis • transferrin recycling • Rab proteins • EEA1 Introduction Eukaryotic cells internalize components from the extracel - lular medium via endocytosis ( Gruenberg and Maxfield , 1995 ; Mellman , 1996 ) . Organelles within the endosomal membrane system have been mainly defined following the flow of different cargo molecules . All internalized mole - cules are transported to early endosomes , also called sort - ing endosomes ( Dunn et al . , 1989 ) . These membranes , scattered throughout the cell periphery , are filled with cargo within two to five minutes after internalization ( Besterman et al . , 1981 ; Griffiths et al . , 1989 ) . Here most ligands dissociate from their cognate receptors and are , to - gether with fluid phase material , delivered to late endo - somes and lysosomes for degradation . Receptors , such as the transferrin receptor , are often recycled for a new round of internalization ( Hopkins , 1983 ; Dunn et al . , 1989 ) . The bulk of transferrin is returned to the surface with a half - time of three to five minutes ( Schmid et al . , 1988 ; Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . The remaining fraction accumulates in mem - branes that comprise of tubular vesicular structures lo - cated in the vicinity of the microtubule organizing center ( Hopkins , 1983 ; Yamashiro and Maxfield , 1984 ) . Since these membranes do not receive material destined for late endosomes and lysosomes ( Ghosh et al . , 1994 ) , and their pH is slightly higher than that of early endosomes ( Ya - mashiro and Maxfield , 1984 ; Sipe and Murphy , 1987 ) , they were defined as a distinct organelle , the pericentriolar re - cycling endosome . Considering the structural and functional properties of endosomes , several problems arise for the distinction of these two membrane pools by cargo accessibility and mor - phological criteria . First , the flow of cargo through endo - somes becomes increasingly asynchronous with time . Sec - ond , the spatial separation between early and recycling endosomes is not apparent in all cell types . For example , transferrin - accumulating membranes are more concen - trated around the microtubule organizing center in CHO cells than in A431 cells . Third , endosomal membranes are extremely pleomorphic ( Griffiths et al . , 1989 ) and their morphology varies between cell types ( Hopkins et al . , 1990 ; Yamashiro and Maxfield , 1984 ) .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 149 , 2000 902 recycling cargo have not been characterized . Conse - quently , by the so far applied criteria , tubules and vesicles of the recycling endosome cannot be distinguished from transport intermediates . A more accurate definition of endosomal organelles must therefore include their molecular machinery . Early and recycling endosomes are at the crossroad of several transport routes . They continuously exchange membrane with late endocytic compartments , the plasma membrane , and the TGN ( Ghosh et al . , 1998 ) , and , in addition , un - dergo homotypic fusion and fission reactions . All these trafficking events tend to average the biochemical compo - sition over time . How can endosomes then maintain their functional identity ? A group of regulatory molecules localized to distinct subsets of membranes along the secretory and endocytic pathway are members of the Rab family of small GTPases ( Pfeffer , 1994 ; Novick and Zerial , 1997 ) . In the GTP - bound state Rab proteins recruit specific effector proteins to the membrane . These have multiple functions , ranging from membrane budding ( McLauchlan et al . , 1998 ) or docking ( Christoforidis et al . , 1999a ; Guo et al . , 1999 ) to interactions with the cytoskeleton ( Echard et al . , 1998 ; Nielsen et al . , 1999 ) . Interference with their GTPase cycle provokes drastic morphological and functional changes in the target organelles , suggesting that Rab proteins contrib - ute to the organization of membranes . One of the best - studied Rab proteins on endosomes is Rab5 . It is required for the delivery of material from the plasma membrane to early endosomes as well as homotypic endosome fusion ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ; Bucci et al . , 1992 ; McLauchlan et al . , 1998 ) . We recently identified a surprisingly large number of cytosolic proteins binding specifically to the activated form of Rab5 ( Christoforidis et al . , 1999a ) . Rather than serving completely distinct functions , these Rab5 effectors appear to act cooperatively . Upon activation by the Ra - baptin - 5 / Rabex - 5 complex ( Horiuchi et al . , 1997 ) , Rab5 can recruit phosphoinositol - 3 kinases ( Christoforidis et al . , 1999b ) , including hVPS34 ( Schu et al . , 1993 ) , ensuring the local generation of phosphoinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) 1 . An environment of PI ( 3 ) P and active Rab5 is essential for the binding of the docking protein EEA1 ( early endosomal anti - gen 1 ) to the endosomal membrane ( Patki et al . , 1997 ; Mills et al . , 1998 ; Simonsen et al . , 1998 ; Christoforidis et al . , 1999a ) . EEA1 itself directly interacts with the SNARE syntaxin13 in a dynamic , oligomeric complex ( McBride et al . , 1999 ) . Rab5 can therefore be seen as a regulatory anchor for factors that create a restricted , fusion competent domain on the early endosome ( McBride et al . , 1999 ) . This work - ing model can explain how endosomes might be organized to sustain extensive membrane exchange without compro - mising their structural and functional integrity . If general - ized for other family members , the model would predict that Rab proteins with their specific set of effectors can contribute to a compartmentalization within a continuous membrane structure . A functional arrangement of ma - chineries controlling vesicle targeting , protein sorting or cytoskeletal interactions into domains would help to in - crease the efficiency and coordination of these processes . Apart from Rab5 , two other Rab proteins have been im - plicated in the recycling pathway , Rab4 and Rab11 . Rab4 was suggested to play a role in fast recycling from early en - dosomes back to the plasma membrane ( Van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 , Sheff et al . , 1999 ) . Rab11 has been localized to the recycling endosome , the TGN and specialized storage membranes of regulated secretory pathways ( Urbe et al . , 1993 ; Ullrich et al . , 1996 ; Jedd et al . , 1997 ; Calhoun et al . , 1998 ) . Mutants of Rab11 effect transferrin recycling ( Ull - rich et al . , 1996 ; Ren et al . , 1998 ) and transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein ( VSV - G ) to the plasma mem - brane ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) . Our model would predict that Rab4 and Rab11 should be enriched in membrane do - mains distinct from that of Rab5 , but that can reside on the same endosome . Could different arrangements of these domains account for morphologically and kinetically dis - tinct transferrin recycling structures ? To test this hypothesis we have visualized Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 in combination with endosomal cargo . Our re - sults provide evidence for the proposed domain organiza - tion of endosomes . Materials and Methods Cell Lines and Antibodies A431 cells were grown in DME supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FCS , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L - glutamine . Rab proteins were fused COOH - terminally to GFP using the pEGFP - C3 , pECFP - C3 , or pEYFP - C3 vectors provided by CLONTECH Laborato - ries , Inc . Stable cell lines were selected and maintained in medium con - taining 0 . 5 mg / ml G418 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against Rab11 were raised and affinity purified against recombinant pro - tein . mAbs against transferrin receptor ( H68 . 4 ) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories . Polyclonal rabbit TGN46 antiserum was kindly pro - vided by V . Ponnambalam ( University of Dundee , UK ) , human poly - clonal EEA1 antibodies by H . Stenmark ( University of Oslo , Norway ) , and affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP by N . Le Bot ( EMBL , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Biochemical Transferrin Recycling Assay Iron - saturated human transferrin and iron - saturated biotin - labeled trans - ferrin were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . A431 cells were serum starved for 2 h to deplete endogenous transfer - rin . Biotinylated transferrin was internalized at 10 m g / ml for 2 min at 37 8 C . Unbound and surface - bound transferrin was removed by washing the cells with ice - cold PBS containing 1 mg / ml unlabeled transferrin followed by low pH buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM acetic acid , pH 3 . 5 , and 1 mg / ml unlabeled transferrin ) . This procedure resulted in the removal of 95 – 98 % of surface - bound ligand . To measure recycling , cells were returned to 37 8 C in the presence of 1 mg / ml of unlabeled transferrin . At each time point the medium was collected , cells were washed with ice - cold PBS and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer ( PBS containing 2 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 4 % SDS ) . 5 m l of the supernatant ( recycled biotinylated transferrin ) , or 5 m l of the lysate ( cell - associated biotinylated transferrin ) were quantified as described previously ( Zacchi et al . , 1998 ) . Results were expressed as percent of the total signal . Internalization of Fluorescently Labeled Transferrin and Immunofluorescence A431 cells were grown on glass coverslips and serum starved for 1 h be - fore incubation with 60 m g / ml fluorescently labeled transferrin ( Molecular Probes ) . The probe was chased in the presence of a fivefold excess of non - labeled transferrin . Immunofluorescence labeling was performed according to standard procedures . Antibodies against transferrin receptor and TGN46 were di - luted 1 / 100 , EEA1 antiserum was used at 1 / 500 , Rab11 antibody at 1 / 200 dilution . Cells were mounted in ProLong™ Antifade ( Molecular Probes ) . 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : EEA1 , early endosomal antigen 1 ; PI ( 3 ) P , phosphoinositol - 3 - phosphate ; VSV - G , vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein . Sönnichsen et al . Membrane Compartmentalization by Rab GTPases 903 Incubations with 5 m g / ml brefeldin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or 50 – 100 nM wortmannin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were performed in serum - free medium . Microinjection Plasmid DNAs encoding the Rab proteins were injected into the cell nu - cleus using an Eppendorf micromanipulator and transjector . Compared with transient transfections , we found that this technique ensured a better control over expression levels in general and a constant ratio of the two fusion proteins in particular . Expression of the CFP was generally lower compared with the YFP fusion proteins . A mixture of 7 ng / m l YFP and 20 ng / m l CFP plasmid DNA when monitored 6 – 14 h after injection resulted in similar expression levels as seen in the stable cell lines . Live Cell Imaging Cells were grown on life cell imaging dishes ( MatTek Corp . ) . Imaging was performed in CO 2 - independent medium ( GIBCO BRL ) . Time - lapse se - ries were acquired at 37 8 C on an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope , equipped with a 100 3 oil immersion objective , NA 1 . 35 , and a 12 - bit Till Imago CCD camera ( Till Photonics ) . The temperature was controlled by a climate box covering the set up . Filters ( AHF Analysentechnik ) allowed for simultaneous detection of CFP and YFP or GFP and rhodamine , re - spectively . Switching between the excitation wavelengths with a Poly - chrome II multiwavelength illumination system was controlled by the TillvisION 3 . 3 software ( Till Photonics ) . Exposure times were 200 – 300 ms for each channel followed by a 60 - ms readout delay , resulting in time - lapse sequences of roughly two frames per second , which were merged as RGBs using TILLvisION . Series were exported as single TIFF files , pro - cessed in Adobe Photoshop 5 . 0 or converted into QuickTime movies us - ing IPLab 3 . 2 ( Scanalytics Inc . ) . Confocal Microscopy , Image Processing , and Quantitation of Signal Overlap on Fixed Cells Images were acquired on the Compact Confocal Camera ( CCC ) as de - scribed by White et al . , 1998 , using a 63 3 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apochromat III DIC objective ( Carl Zeiss ) . Fluorescent dyes were imaged sequentially in frame - interlace mode to eliminate cross talk between the channels . CFP was excited with a 430 - nm laser line ( Directly Doubled Diode / D3 ; Coher - ent ) and imaged through a combination of 440 – 505 - nm bandpass and 525 - nm longpass emission filters . YFP was exited with the 514 - nm Argon laser line and imaged through a 525 - nm longpass emission filter . Texas red was excited with the 594 - nm Helium Neon laser line and imaged through a 610 - nm longpass emission filter . Serial sections were acquired satisfying the Nyquist criteria for sam - pling and processed on a multiprocessor SGI Unix computer using the Huygens System 2 . 2 ( Scientific Volume Imaging BV ) . A maximum likeli - hood estimation ( MLE ) - based algorithm was used for image reconstruc - tion . Z - stacks of images were exported as TIFF files , and individual sec - tions were analyzed for fluorescent signal overlap by visual inspection . Using Adobe Photoshop 5 , a 5 3 5 - cm grid was projected onto the image of the reference channel , and in every second grid square all fluorescent structures were marked on a separate , superimposed layer . Signals were referred to as individual structures if they comprised of a continuous patch of intensity values . 50 ( in a range of 0 – 255 ) . This layer was then pro - jected onto the corresponding images for the other two channels , and the underlying image was analyzed for fluorescent signal at the marked posi - tion . At least two sections per cell were counted , ensuring that peripheral and perinuclear structures were equally taken into account . 5 – 10 cells were analyzed , counting 150 – 200 fluorescent structures per cell . Electron Microscopy A431 cells stably expressing Rab4 - or Rab5 - GFP were labeled with BSA - gold ( 5 nm ) at an OD ( 520 ) of 0 . 5 . Cells were washed extensively and har - vested with a cell scraper . After homogenization ( 3 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 250 mM sucrose , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) with a 22 . 5 - gauge needle , unbroken cells and nuclei were sedimented at 1 , 000 g for 10 min . The resulting PNS was supplemented with an ATP regenerating system ( 10 mM ATP , 80 mM creatine phosphate , 0 . 4 mM creatine kinase ) and 1 mM GTP and in - cubated with carbon - coated copper grids at room temperature for 15 min . After fixation with 2 % ( wt / vol ) paraformaldehyde for 10 min , unspecific binding sites and remaining fixative were blocked with 0 . 8 % ( wt / vol ) BSA , 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) fish skin gelatin , and 20 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min . Antibodies against EEA1 , GFP , and Rab11 were diluted in blocking solution at 1 : 50 , 1 : 200 , and 1 : 30 , respectively . Protein A conjugated to 10 - nm gold was diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Slot and Geuze , University of Utrecht ) . The first antibody / protein A complex was fixed with 1 % ( vol / vol ) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min . After quenching of the fixative with 20 mM glycine in PBS , the immunolabeling procedure was repeated with the second antibody and protein A conju - gated to 15 - nm gold . Finally , the material was stained with 2 % methyl cel - lulose and 3 % uranyl acetate in a mixture of 1 : 3 for 5 min at 4 8 C . Speci - men were observed on a Philips CM120 BioTwin transmission electron microscope . For quantitation , random images of membrane - containing fields were taken at 27 , 000 magnification . Endosomes were identified by the internal - ized BSA - gold . 50 – 100 endosomes on ten images were analyzed for im - munogold labeling , and the results were expressed as a percentage of the total identified endosomes .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 149 , 2000 904 Results GFP Fusion Proteins of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 Are Correctly Localized to Their Target Membranes To demonstrate that endosomal membrane organization visualized via GFP fusion proteins reflects the situation in normal cells , we had to establish that the expressed Rab proteins were correctly localized and did not alter the transferrin cycle . Using human A431 cells in which trans - ferrin recycling has been extensively characterized ( Hop - kins , 1983 ) , we generated stable cell lines expressing wild - type GFP - Rab4 , - Rab5 , or - Rab11 . Overexpression was moderate , about fivefold over the endogenous levels as es - timated by Western blotting ( not shown ) . All three fusion proteins became membrane bound ( Fig . 1 ) and could be extracted into the soluble pool by microinjected recombi - nant Rab GDI ( GDP dissociation inhibitor ) or by incuba - tion with Rab GDI after permeabilization with strepto - lysin O ( not shown ) . The GFP - Rab5 cell line has been described elsewhere ( Nielsen et al . , 1999 ) . GFP - Rab5 was colocalizing with its effector EEA1 , indicating that the GFP tag did not interfere with its correct membrane tar - geting ( Fig . 1 A ) . GFP - Rab4 localized to endosomes , as defined by the presence of transferrin receptor ( Fig . 1 C ) . Colocalization of GFP - Rab4 with EEA1 was often partial ( compare Fig . 1 , A with B ) . GFP - Rab11 labeling was found in the pericentriolar area as well as on small vesicu - lar structures throughout the cytoplasm . These vesicles were distinct , but often in close proximity to EEA1 - con - taining endosomes ( Fig . 1 D ) . As previously demonstrated by antibody staining ( Ullrich et al . , 1996 ) , the pericentri - olar membranes colocalized partially with transferrin re - ceptor ( Fig . 1 E ) and with a marker for the TGN , TGN46 ( Fig . 1 F ) . To measure transferrin recycling , biotinylated transfer - rin was internalized for 2 min at 37 8 C and chased in the presence of nonlabeled transferrin for up to 30 min ( Fig . 1 G ) . Comparing wild - type A431 cells to all three cell lines , we found no major differences in the amounts of transfer - rin recycled to the medium . As previously noted ( Van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ) , expression of Rab4 - GFP led to a slight increase in the early rates of recycling . After this initial characterization , we concluded that the GFP fusion pro - teins of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 could faithfully represent their endogenous counterparts in A431 cells . Transferrin Travels through Rab5 - , Rab4 - , and Rab11 - labeled Domains on Endosomes We then followed the passage of transferrin through endo - somes with respect to the machinery represented by Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 . In cells expressing GFP - Rab4 , Rab5 , or Rab11 , rhodamine transferrin was internalized for 2 min at 37 8 C and chased in the presence of nonlabeled transfer - rin ( Fig . 2 A ) . After fixation , images were acquired and overlap of fluorescent signal was quantified ( see Materials and Methods ) . Early after internalization , the major popu - lation of transferrin - labeled structures ( 70 % ) colabeled with Rab5 ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . This association was transient Figure 1 . Characterization of A431 cell lines expressing GFP - Rab4 , Rab5 or Rab11 . A431 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab5 ( A ) , GFP - Rab4 ( B and C ) or GFP - Rab11 ( D , E , and F ) were labeled with antibodies against EEA1 ( A , B and D ) , transferrin receptor ( C and E ) or TGN46 ( F ) followed by secondary antibodies coupled to rhodamine . Images represent individual confocal sections . ( G ) Wild - type A431 cells and stable cell lines were labeled with biotinylated transferrin for 2 min at 37 8 C , followed by incubation in the presence of an excess of nonlabeled transferrin for the indicated time periods . Me - dium and cells were collected , and analyzed for biotinylated transferrin . Recycled trans - ferrin was expressed as a percentage of the total . Bar , 2 m m . Sönnichsen et al . Membrane Compartmentalization by Rab GTPases 905 and decreased rapidly after the first minutes . The number of transferrin - labeled endosomes containing Rab11 in - creased slowly from z 20 to 55 % during a 30 - min chase ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , in line with an involvement of Rab11 in late stages of recycling ( Ullrich et al . , 1996 ; Ren et al . , 1998 ) . Rab4 has been implicated in the fast route of recy - cling ( Van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ; Sheff et al . , 1999 ) . Consis - tently , . 90 % of transferrin - labeled membranes contained Rab4 after a 5 - min chase ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Surprisingly , z 70 % remained positive for Rab4 at late time points ( 15 and 30 min after internalization ) when . 80 % of the trans - ferrin had been recycled ( compare with Fig . 1 G ) , suggest - ing that a requirement for Rab4 might not be limited to early stages . Early endosomes are comprised of globular and tubu - lovesicular membrane elements , which have been proposed to reflect different functional domains ( Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . We hypothesized that if Rab proteins generate distinct do - mains on the membrane , Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 might be differentially localized to these membrane elements . Strik - ingly , visualizing endosomes by time - lapse video micros - copy we could distinguish distinct subdomains of GFP - Rab protein on larger transferrin - filled structures ( Fig . 2 C and videos 1 – 3 , transferrin in red , Rab proteins in green ) . Rab5 was mostly restricted to globular domains , and largely ex - cluded from tubules and vesicles . Rapid segregation of transferrin from these Rab5 - positive domains could fre - quently be observed ( Fig . 2 C , arrows , and video 1 ) . Both , Rab4 and Rab11 were seen on tubules and small globular domains forming on larger transferrin - labeled structures ( Fig . 2 C , arrows , videos 2 and 3 ) . Whereas Rab11 struc - tures localized preferentially towards the cell center , those positive for Rab4 were more widely distributed . Tubules often fragmented into smaller , vesicular profiles ( Fig . 2 C and video 3 ) . In summary , these experiments suggested that Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 are localized to discrete do - mains on endosomes . Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 Label Distinct Domains on the Same Endosomes We next asked whether Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 were dif - ferentially localized to domains of the same endosome . In other words , were Rab5 negative tubules that emerged Figure 2 .

To address this question , combinations of CFP and YFP fusions of the three Rab proteins were coex - pressed in A431 cells . Texas red transferrin was internal - ized for 30 min to reach steady state labeling . After fixa - tion , confocal serial sections were obtained and processed with a deconvolution software before quantification of overlapping fluorescent signals . Single endosomes were defined as structures with continuous transferrin signal ( see Materials and Methods ) . Interestingly , although residing on the same structure , as defined by the continuous labeling for transferrin , the fluorescent signals for the individual Rab proteins were mostly segregated ( Fig . 3 , insets ) . This suggested that Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 could indeed occupy distinct do - mains on continuous membranes . Transferrin traverses through Rab5 - positive endosomes early after internaliza - tion ( Fig . 2 A ) . Consistently , at steady state the cargo was mainly found in Rab4 and Rab11 containing membranes ( Fig . 3 and Table I ) . Remarkably , the majority ( 63 6 5 % ) of these transferrin structures harbored both Rab4 and Rab11 . In contrast , only about a quarter of the transferrin positive endosomes contained Rab4 and Rab5 ( 23 . 5 6 7 % , Fig . 3 and Table I ) . The lowest overlap was seen for Rab5 and Rab11 ( 19 6 8 % ) . The time course suggested that after leaving Rab5 endosomes , transferrin rapidly reached Rab4 - positive membranes ( Fig . 2 A ) . We there - fore speculated that this transit might occur within the same endosomes containing both Rab4 and Rab5 . Consis - tently , when we analyzed cells shortly after internalization , more than twice as many transferrin - filled endosomes con - tained Rab4 and Rab5 , compared with the steady state sit - uation ( 51 6 8 % vs . 23 . 5 6 7 % , Table I ) . This suggests that the cargo could be sorted from a Rab5 into a Rab4 domain , residing on the same membrane . So far , we had confirmed that cargo - filled endosomes are structured in domains , represented by different Rab proteins . However , with this approach we could not deter - mine whether in respect to the Rab machinery the compo - sition of endosomes changes as transferrin flows through or whether cargo is transported between endosomes with a stable composition . If Rab proteins were subjected to a similar flow as cargo this should be reflected in a change of overlapping distribution between Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 at different stages of recycling . To visualize all three Rab proteins together we detected endogenous Rab11 by anti - body staining in cells coexpressing CFP - Rab5 and YFP - Rab4 ( Fig . 3 ) . All endosomes labeled for a particular Rab protein were counted and the extent of overlap with the other Rab proteins was determined at steady state and early after transferrin internalization . Under both condi - tions , half of the Rab4 - positive endosomes also contained Rab5 , suggesting a relatively stable pool of membranes with this composition ( Table II ) . Another pool , similar in size , contained Rab4 and Rab11 , and a quarter of the Rab4 endosomes was positive for all three Rab proteins . Interestingly , whereas most of the Rab4 structures colocal - ized either with Rab5 or Rab11 or both , about half the population of Rab5 - positive endosomes did not label for either of the other Rab proteins ( Table II ) . Taken together , the quantification suggests that trans - ferrin moves through endosomes that are structured in do - mains labeling for Rab5 , Rab4 , or Rab11 . Via membranes that are mainly Rab5 - positive , the cargo enters a pool of endosomes that contain both Rab5 and Rab4 . Transfer from this pool is fast , and at steady state transferrin is Table I .

Membrane Compartmentalization by Rab GTPases 907 mostly found in membranes containing Rab4 and Rab11 . However , it has to be noted that endosomes containing all three Rab proteins were observed , and likewise mem - branes containing only Rab4 , only Rab11 , or Rab5 and Rab11 ( Tables I – III ) . It will probably be necessary to con - sider all possible combinations of domain arrangements to get a complete view of the pathway . Electron Microscopy Confirms that Rab Proteins Localize to Distinct Membrane Domains on the Same Endosome The data presented so far support our model for a domain organization of endosomal membranes . However , the size of the observed structures is at the limit of resolution for light microscopy techniques . We therefore sought to sub - stantiate these findings by electron microscopy . To have the entire surface area available for immunolabeling , we decided to avoid sectioning of the membranes . Cells ex - pressing GFP - Rab4 ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) or GFP - Rab5 ( Fig . 4 D ) were incubated with 5 - nm gold - conjugated to BSA for 30 min at 37 8 C . Membranes from postnuclear supernatants of these cells were adsorbed to copper grids by incubation at room temperature in the presence of an ATP - regener - ating system and GTP . The material was labeled with anti - bodies to GFP and EEA1 or Rab11 . Remarkably , the gold labeling for individual Rab pro - teins was often localized in discrete patches ( Fig . 4 , A and Figure 3 . Confocal images of Rab4 - , Rab5 - and Rab11 - labeling on transferrin - filled endosomes . A431 cells ex - pressing CFP - Rab5 and YFP - Rab4 ( top and bottom row ) , CFP - Rab5 and YFP - Rab11 ( second row ) , CFP - Rab11 and YFP - Rab4 ( third row ) after internalization of Texas red transferrin for 30 min ( top three rows ) , or staining with antibodies for Rab11 followed by secondary anti - bodies conjugated to Texas red ( bottom row ) . Individual confocal sections are shown . Bar , 2 m m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 149 , 2000 908 B ) . These were only found on the membranes and were not observed when the material was adsorbed at 4 8 C ( Fig . 4 C ) , excluding artifacts generated by protein A aggre - gates or overexpression of the GFP fusion proteins . How - ever , we cannot rule out that in some instances these patches appeared particularly tight due to a collapsing of membrane elements during the staining procedure . Never - theless , labeling for GFP - Rab4 ( Fig . 4 A , arrowheads ) and the Rab5 effector EEA1 ( Fig . 4 A , arrows ) were clearly segregated on the same endosomal membrane , as defined by the internalized BSA - gold ( asterisks ) . Like - wise , patches of endogenous Rab11 , detected by an affin - ity - purified antibody ( Fig . 4 B , arrows ) , were distinct from GFP - Rab4 – labeled areas ( Fig . 4 B , arrowheads ) . In con - trast , both Rab5 and its effector EEA1 were localized to the same domains on endosomes from GFP - Rab5 – express - ing cells ( Fig . 4 D , arrows ) . 54 % of the BSA - gold – filled endosomes positive for Rab4 also labeled for Rab11 ( Ta - ble III ) . After short internalization for 5 min , 18 % of the BSA - gold – filled endosomes labeled for Rab4 and Rab11 , whereas 49 % contained EEA1 and Rab4 ( Table III ) . Table III .

Specimens were labeled with antibodies against EEA1 and GFP ( A , C , and D ) or Rab11 and GFP ( B ) . Sönnichsen et al . Membrane Compartmentalization by Rab GTPases 909 These numbers are consistent with the data obtained from the confocal images ( Tables I and II ) . In summary , the ul - trastructural analysis confirmed that Rab proteins and their effectors can form discrete domains on continuous membranes . Arrangements of Distinct Membrane Domains within the Same Endosome Can Be Visualized in Living Cells In a third approach , we studied the proposed domain orga - nization in living cells , following Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 , coexpressed as YFP and CFP fusion proteins , by time - lapse video microscopy . As expected , the labeled endo - somes were highly dynamic . Nevertheless , following indi - vidual structures over time , we frequently observed that more than one type of Rab protein occupied continuous membrane elements . More importantly , also in living cells , fluorescent signals were mostly segregated within the same structure ( Fig . 5 A and videos 4 – 6 ) . This was not a consequence of the imaging technique since in cells coex - pressing YFP - Rab11 and CFP - Rab11 , both signals were clearly overlapping ( not shown ) . As in fixed cells , we mainly found Rab4 and Rab5 , or Rab4 and Rab11 residing on the same endosome ( Fig . 5 A ) . Rab5 was restricted to globular domains , which in some instances could be ob - served to dock or fuse ( Fig . 5 A , middle panel , arrows , and video 5 ) . Parts of the Rab4 domain on Rab5 - positive en - dosomes were often seen to segregate into distinct tubular or vesicular structures ( arrows , top panel , and video 4 ) . Similar observations were made for endosomes containing Rab4 and Rab11 , both proteins entering separate tubules and vesicles ( Fig . 5 , bottom panel , arrows ) . Thus , Rab do - mains are not generated by fixation but can be observed in living cells . Domains on Rab4 and Rab11 Endosomes Are Sensitive to Brefeldin A We next asked whether structural alterations on the endo - somal membrane would perturb the segregation of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 . Transferrin and Rab4 have been shown to localize to an extensive tubular network in response to brefeldin A ( BFA ; Tooze and Hollinshead , 1992 ; Daro et al . , 1996 ) . Consistently , we found that transferrin rapidly entered long GFP - Rab4 – positive tubules after a short treatment with BFA ( Fig . 5 B and video 7 ) . In cells ex - pressing CFP - Rab11 and YFP - Rab4 both proteins local - ized to the same tubular network ( Fig . 5 B , arrows , and video 8 ) , but were no longer clearly segregated in distinct domains . Remarkably , a fraction of Rab4 - containing en - dosomes did not form tubules , but rather remained in dis - tinct globular structures . These membranes contained lit - tle or no Rab11 ( Fig . 5 B , arrowheads ) . Imaging cells expressing CFP - Rab5 and YFP - Rab4 under these condi - tions revealed that Rab5 - positive endosomes were resis - tant to BFA - induced tubulation . Likewise , Rab4 remained in the globular part when present on Rab5 endosomes ( Fig . 5 B and video 9 ) . The amount of Rab4 on Rab5 - posi - tive membranes was slightly decreased compared with control cells ( 30 6 8 % vs . 43 6 6 % ) , suggesting that some Rab4 entered the tubular network from Rab5 - positive en - dosomes . Consistent with this observation , transit of transferrin from Rab4 / Rab5 - positive endosomes to the Rab4 / Rab11 network proceeded when cells were pretreated with BFA to allow tubule formation . Rhodamine transferrin , inter - nalized for 2 min at 37 8 C , was followed by a chase in the presence of BFA ( Fig . 6 ) . The amount of Rab5 - positive transferrin structures was slightly higher than in control cells at early time points ( Fig . 6 A ) , however , we found no significant morphological difference to nontreated cells ( Fig . 6 B , Rab5 panel , compare with Fig . 2 B ) . Transfer of transferrin into Rab4 - labeled endosomes proceeded faster in the presence of BFA ( Fig . 6 A , 2 min ) , but at early stages the cargo remained restricted to globular Rab4 - pos - itive endosomes and was largely excluded from the tubular network ( Fig . 6 B ) . After 5 min , transferrin had left Rab5 positive and reached Rab4 - labeled membranes to similar levels as seen in control cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . At this point some cargo had entered the BFA - induced tubular network ( Fig . 6 B ) . This was accompanied by a slight increase for Rab11 labeling compared with nontreated cells , consistent with the observation that Rab4 and Rab11 were not clearly seg - regated in these tubules . At later time points most of the transferrin was found in a membrane network that did not permit quantitation of individual structures ( not shown ) . Given that recycling is only marginally effected by BFA ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1991 ; our unpublished data ) , the bulk of transferrin might be delivered back to the sur - face directly from the BFA resistant Rab5 / Rab4 endo - somes . However , segregation of Rab4 and Rab11 domains might not be strictly required , and recycling could occur after a fast transit into the tubular network . Wortmannin Treatment Delays Exit of Transferrin from Rab4 / Rab5 - Positive Endosomes Cells treated with the phosphatidylinositol - kinase inhibi - tor wortmannin show a delay in transferrin recycling ( Spiro et al . , 1996 ) . The activity of the PI - ( 3 ) - kinase hVPS34 is necessary for the membrane recruitment of the Rab5 effector EEA1 ( Mills et al . , 1998 ; Simonsen et al . , 1998 ; Christoforidis , et al . , 1999b ) , suggesting that a Rab5 domain requires a microenvironment of PI ( 3 ) P and active Rab5 with its effectors on the membrane . Therefore , de - pletion of PI ( 3 ) P by wortmannin treatment should perturb the Rab5 domain . To test whether this might interfere with the transfer of transferrin to Rab4 - positive domains , we quantitated the codistribution of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 with transferrin after 30 min internalization in the presence of 50 nm wortmannin ( Table I ) . Consistent with our hypothesis , we found that compared with control cells twice as many transferrin - labeled endosomes contained Rab4 and Rab5 ( 47 6 14 % vs . 23 6 7 % , Table I ) . Like - wise , the number of cargo - filled structures containing Rab4 and Rab11 was reduced to almost half compared with control cells ( 35 6 6 % vs . 63 . 5 6 5 % , Table I ) , in - dicating that transferrin was retained in Rab4 / Rab5 endo - somes upon wortmannin treatment . Moreover , also the domain arrangement was changed as judged by the num - ber of Rab4 - positive endosomes containing either Rab5 or Rab11 . More Rab4 endosomes were positive for Rab5 ( 65 . 5 6 4 % vs . 52 6 6 % ) and fewer labeled for Rab11 ( 34 . 5 6 9 % vs . 50 6 1 % , Table II ) . Sorting of membrane associated cargo has been suggested to occur by segrega - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 149 , 2000 910 tion from globular into tubular domains of the endosome ( Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . The observed delay of transferrin re - cycling in wortmannin - treated cells might be explained by the perturbation of this domain structure . Consistently , wortmannin treatment frequently resulted in structural changes of Rab5 endosomes ( video 10 ) , which were not observed on Rab11 membranes . Figure 5 .

Discussion Although endocytosis and receptor recycling have been extensively studied , the compartmental organization of endosomes is still poorly understood . The small GTPases Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 are well - accepted regulators of the endocytic / recycling pathway ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ; Van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ; Ullrich et al . , 1996 ; Ren et al . , 1998 ) . To test whether these Rab proteins can functionally ar - range membrane domains within the same organelle , we have visualized Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 on cargo - filled en - dosomes by video , confocal , and electron microscopy . Three principle conclusions can be drawn from this study . First , Rab proteins are localized in morphologically dis - tinct domains , which can reside on the same endosome . Second , these membrane domains are dynamic but do not significantly intermix over time . Furthermore , the overall distribution of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 domains on endo - somes does not significantly change at different stages of recycling . Third , endosomes comprised of different do - main arrangements display differential pharmacological sensitivity , reflecting their biochemical and possibly func - tional diversity . On the basis of these results , we propose a model that describes endosomes as a mosaic of functional membrane domains ( Fig . 7 ) . These domains would be or - ganized by Rab proteins and similar regulatory proteins through local recruitment of specific effector proteins . Therefore , it is the nature of the effector molecules that specifies the function ( s ) of a domain . To coordinate vari - ous functions , different domains would communicate , pos - sibly via effectors shared between neighboring Rab pro - teins . Sönnichsen et al . Membrane Compartmentalization by Rab GTPases 911 Targeting of the GFP fusion proteins , their accessibility to Rab GDI , and the kinetics of transferrin recycling indi - cate that the experimental strategy we have chosen allows the faithful visualization of endosomal organelles . Quanti - tation of the confocal images showed that transferrin en - ters via structures containing mainly Rab5 , consistent with the fact that Rab5 is found on clathrin - coated vesicles and required for docking and fusion of these with early endosomes ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ; Horiuchi et al . , 1995 ; McLauchlan et al . , 1998 ) . Fast recycling coincided with transferrin localization in Rab4 / Rab5 - positive endosomes , whereas at steady state transferrin accumulated in Rab4 / Rab11 containing membranes . Concerning the overall dis - tribution of the Rab proteins , our morphological quantifi - cations are in agreement with previous biochemical stud - ies . With an immunoisolation approach , Trischler et al . ( 1999 ) identified endosome populations with the same ex - tent of overlap between Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 . Sheff et al . ( 1999 ) obtained similar results using a gradient frac - tionation technique . More importantly , the morphological approach provided insights into the spatial organization of the Rab proteins . When visualized by video microscopy of living cells , confocal microscopy , and electron microscopy , different Rab proteins are segregated into distinct do - mains on the same membrane , presumably stabilized by their effectors . Since the overall distribution of Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 does not change with the flow of cargo , the data support the interpretation that Rab proteins be - long to the intrinsic structural and functional machinery of endosomes . This has important consequences for the defi - nition of organelles in the recycling pathway . With respect to Rab proteins , both early and recycling endosomes are Figure 6 . Transfer of transferrin from Rab4 / Rab5 to Rab4 / Rab11 - positive endosomes proceeds in BFA - treated cells . ( A ) A431 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab4 , - Rab5 , or - Rab11 were labeled with rhodamine transferrin for 2 min followed by a chase for the indicated time points . BFA treatment of the cells was started 5 min before and continued during internalization and chase times . For acquisition and quantitation of the fluorescent images see Fig . 2 and Materials and Methods . ( B ) Representative merged images for BFA - treated cells ( compare with Fig . 2 B ) . Bar , 2 m m . Figure 7 . Model , describing endocytic organelles as a mosaic of membrane domains . The domain distribution of the three Rab proteins presented in this study , Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 is de - picted in red , green , and blue , respectively . Compartmentaliza - tion is achieved by dynamic functional arrangements of these do - mains , combinations of Rab4 and Rab5 , and Rab4 and Rab11 being the most abundant . Arrows indicate direction of transferrin recycling . Cargo enters the cell via mainly Rab5 - containing struc - tures . Fast recycling is achieved by rapid sorting from Rab5 into Rab4 - positive domains on the same endosome . Recycling slows down once transferrin enters pericentriolar membranes domi - nated by Rab4 and Rab11 domains . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 149 , 2000 912 structured into Rab4 , Rab5 , and Rab11 domains , only the relative amounts of these domains differ . Early endo - somes in the cell periphery are primarily composed of Rab5 and Rab4 domains and contain few Rab11 domains . Conversely , recycling endosomes in the pericentriolar area mainly contain Rab4 and Rab11 domains ( Fig . 7 ) . Whether the same effector proteins bind to a particular Rab protein , regardless of where the domain is located , re - mains to be investigated . The idea that this domain organi - zation can create a biochemically distinct environment is supported by the differential effects of wortmannin and BFA . It should be noted , that several other Rab proteins are localized on endosomes ( Olkkonen et al . , 1993 ; Lütcke et al . , 1994 ) . Moreover , in all likelihood the Rab machiner - ies cooperate with other regulatory molecules ( e . g . , ARF and ARF effectors , see below ) to create platforms for membrane organization . Consequently , a variety of endo - somal subpopulations may arise from combinatorial ar - rangements of individual domains . How then is efficient receptor recycling achieved ? By mathematical modeling the transferrin route is best de - scribed assuming two recycling stations with different ki - netic properties ( Sheff et al . , 1999 ) . The first is filled maxi - mally within 5 min , subsequently more than two - thirds of the remaining transferrin will accumulate in the second station after 25 min . Our data would imply a role for Rab4 on both of these sorting stations . 90 % of the transferrin was associated with Rab4 - positive endosomes at early time points , and 64 % of the transferrin was found in Rab4 and Rab11 - positive endosomes after 30 min of internalization . Fast recycling seems to require a rapid sorting of transfer - rin from a Rab5 into a Rab4 domain on the same endo - some . This process is delayed when the Rab5 domain is perturbed by wortmannin treatment . One could envisage that neighboring domains would communicate via com - mon effector proteins . One such candidate protein would be rabaptin5 ( Vitale et al . , 1998 ) , which binds both Rab4 and Rab5 . Once transferrin has traversed Rab5 / Rab4 en - dosomes , it would accumulate in membranes enriched for Rab4 and Rab11 domains . These membranes would exert slower kinetics of recycling and exhibit different sorting capacity . Whereas the role for Rab5 in endosome fusion is well established , the exact functions of Rab4 and Rab11 are unknown . These two GTPases might be directly in - volved in the formation of recycling vesicles , possibly tar - geted to different sites of the plasma membrane . For ex - ample , Rab11 might have a role in polarized transport in epithelial or motile cells ( e . g . , facilitate transcytosis of cargo like the polymeric IgA receptor ; Sheff et al . , 1999 ) , whereas Rab4 would regulate a more general route of membrane recycling . The nature of the recycling vesicles is unclear . Coated buds have been observed on tubulovesic - ular endosomes ( Stoorvogel et al . , 1996 ) , and the tubula - tion of Rab4 / Rab11 membranes upon BFA treatment is most likely due to the inhibition of ARF - dependent pro - cesses ( Donaldson et al . , 1992 ; Helms and Rothman , 1992 ) . However , whether coated vesicles actively partici - pate in recycling remains to be established . If sorting is completed once transferrin has reached a Rab4 - positive domain , coat assembly might not be absolutely required . Alternatively , a BFA - insensitive exchange factor for ARF might exist on Rab4 / Rab5 endosomes . Either mechanism would explain why recycling is only marginally effected by BFA . In summary , envisaging endosomes as dynamic arrange - ments of membrane domains can give an integrative view on the complexity and robustness of the recycling path - way . This model not only agrees with the observed kinetics ( Sheff et al . , 1999 ) , but also explains how in some cell types a seemingly continuous membrane system can achieve com - partmentalization ( Hopkins et al . , 1990 ) . However , at the molecular level it is mainly based on the interactions of a single Rab protein , Rab5 , with its effectors . Besides the morphological evidence reported here , to show that these domains generally serve as a platform for membrane orga - nization , it will be necessary to characterize Rab4 and Rab11 effector proteins .
