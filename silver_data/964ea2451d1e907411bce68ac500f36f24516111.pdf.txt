Diacylglycerol - Stimulated Endocytosis of Transferrin in Trypanosomatids Is Dependent on Tyrosine Kinase Activity Sandesh Subramanya ¤ , Kojo Mensa - Wilmot * Department of Cellular Biology , University of Georgia , Athens , Georgia , United States of America Abstract Small molecule regulation of cell function is an understudied area of trypanosomatid biology . In Trypanosoma brucei diacylglycerol ( DAG ) stimulates endocytosis of transferrin ( Tf ) . However , it is not known whether other trypanosomatidae respond similarly to the lipid . Further , the biochemical pathways involved in DAG signaling to the endocytic system in T . brucei are unknown , as the parasite genome does not encode canonical DAG receptors ( e . g . C1 - domains ) . We established that DAG stimulates endocytosis of Tf in Leishmania major , and we evaluated possible effector enzymes in the pathway with multiple approaches . First , a heterologously expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C ( GPI - PLC ) activated endocytosis of Tf 300 % in L . major . Second , exogenous phorbol ester and DAGs promoted Tf endocytosis in L . major . In search of possible effectors of DAG signaling , we discovered a novel C1 - like domain ( i . e . C1 _ 5 ) in trypanosomatids , and we identified protein Tyr kinases ( PTKs ) linked with C1 _ 5 domains in T . brucei , T . cruzi , and L . major . Consequently , we hypothesized that trypanosome PTKs might be effector enzymes for DAG signaling . General uptake of Tf was reduced by inhibitors of either Ser / Thr or Tyr kinases . However , DAG - stimulated endocytosis of Tf was blocked only by an inhibitor of PTKs , in both T . brucei and L . major . We conclude that ( i ) DAG activates Tf endocytosis in L . major , and that ( ii ) PTKs are effectors of DAG - stimulated endocytosis of Tf in trypanosomatids . DAG - stimulated endocytosis of Tf may be a T . brucei adaptation to compete effectively with host cells for vertebrate Tf in blood , since DAG does not enhance endocytosis of Tf in human cells .

Foster School of Medicine , El Paso , Texas , United States of America Introduction Endocytosis in eukaryotes is important for uptake of nutrients ( e . g . iron , and cholesterol esters ) , maintenance of cell volume , and for modulation of cell signaling ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . Lipids regulate various steps of endocytosis . Diacylglycerol ( DAG ) is a second messenger for cell signaling . Receptors and effectors , the best known of which is protein kinase C ( PKC ) , mediate signaling by DAG . C1 - domain proteins bind DAG ( and phorbol ester ) [ 2 ] . Non - kinase receptors of DAG include chimaerins , CalDAG - GEF1 , and RasGRP . Glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C ( GPI - PLC ) is expressed in bloodstream T . brucei . Products of the enzyme’s digestion of GPI include diacylglycerols ( DAGs ) and inositolpho - sphoglycans [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . GPI - PLC can cleave intracellular GPIs at the endoplasmic reticulum [ 6 ] , and regulates endocytosis of transferrin ( Tf ) , the iron - binding protein , in bloodstream T . brucei [ 7 ] . In a mouse model of human African trypanosomiasis , the enzyme contributes to virulence of a pleomorphic strain of T . brucei [ 8 ] . DAG ( or phorbol ester ) stimulates endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei [ 7 ] . The enzyme is not important for release of GPI - anchored variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) from the plasma membrane [ 8 , 9 ] . However , DAG regulation of Tf endocytosis in other trypanosomatids has not been evaluated . Further , the signaling pathway used by DAG to stimulate endocytosis in T . brucei is not known . Leishmania are trypanosomatid protozoans that acquire host hemoglobin and transferrin by endocytosis [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] . Currently , no lipid regulators of endocytosis have been described in Leishmania . In this work , we used L . major as a model trypanosomatid to study DAG - stimulated Tf endocytosis . Heter - ologous ( stable ) expression of a GPI - PLC gene in L . major promoted endocytosis of Tf . In addition , preincubation of L . major with DAG or phorbol ester increased endocytosis of Tf . These data document DAG regulation of Tf endocytosis in L . major , and establish DAG as a signaling lipid in the parasite . To gain insight into signaling pathways used by DAG to activate Tf endocytosis in trypanosomatids we used a combination of bioinformatic and pharmacological approaches . We discovered a novel C1 - like domain linked to protein Tyr kinases in T . brucei : And , in both L . major and T . brucei an inhibitor of protein Tyr kinase ( PTK ) arrested DAG - stimulated endocytosis of Tf . These PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8538 data indicate that DAG signaling to the endocytic system in trypanosomatids is regulated by PTKs . Consistent with this model , the genomes of T . brucei and L . major do not encode Ser / Thr kinases with C1 - domains ( i . e . , protein kinases C ) that could be effectors of the actions of DAG in these deeply - diverged eukaryotes . Results Transferrin Endocytosis in L . major Is Stimulated by a GPI - Phospholipase C Leishmania acquire host transferrin ( and indirectly iron ) by endocytosis [ 15 , 16 ] . A 70 kD Tf - binding protein has been implicated in its uptake but mechanisms regulating acquisition of Tf by Leishmania spp have not been studied . GPI - phospholipase C ( GPI - PLC ) from T . brucei activates endocytosis of transferrin in that parasite [ 7 ] most likely by releasing DAG from cleavage of GPIs in the trypanosome . We tested a possibility that endocytosis of Tf in L . major would be affected by presence of GPI - GPI - PLC polypeptide ( GPI - PLCp ) . ( The L . major genome does not encode a GPI - PLC gene . ) For this objective , L . major stably harboring plasmid pUTK - GPIPLC ( pUTK - GPIPLC / L . major ) and a control strain transfected with the vector alone ( pUTK / L . major ) were used in Tf endocytosis assays . L . major expressing GPI - PLC accumulated 200 – 300 % more transferrin - Alexa Fluor 594 than control pUTK / L . major ( Fig . 1A ) . Hence a GPI - PLC can regulate Tf endocytosis in L . major . GPI - PLC expression had no effect on the growth rate of L . major ( Fig . 1B ) . When expressed in L . major , GPI - PLCp can be directed either to endosomes or to glycosomes ( peroxisomes ) . The unmutated enzyme associates with endosomes , whereas Cys - to - Ser mutations at positions 269 , 270 , and 273 in GPI - PLCp targets the protein to endosomes [ 17 ] . We tested whether different sub - cellular locations of enzymatically active Cys mutants of GPI - PLCp affected Tf endocytosis in L . major . Unmutated GPI - PLCp facilitated Tf uptake in L . major ( Fig . 1 ) . Similarly , in pUTK - GPIPLC - C269 , 273S / L . major and pUTK - GPIPLC - C269 , 270 , 273S / L . major uptake of Tf was increased in comparison to L . major expressing vector ( pUTK / L . major ) alone ( Fig . 2 ) . Tf accumulation in these Cys mutants was comparable to levels observed with L . major expressing unmutated GPI - PLC . We conclude that glycosome location of GPI - PLCp is equally effective as endosomal GPI - PLCp in stimulating uptake of Tf into L . major . Thus endosome localization of GPI - PLCp is not required for the enzyme’s stimulation of Tf endocytosis in L . major . Enzyme Activity Is Important for GPI - PLC Stimulation of Tf Endocytosis in L . major Since GPI - PLC promoted Tf endocytosis from either endo - somes or glycosomes , we considered a hypothesis that the enzyme produced a diffusible second messenger ( e . g . DAG ) that mediated its physiological effect . As a first step to evaluate this theory , we analyzed the effect of an enzymatically inactive Gln81Leu ( Q81L ) GPI - PLCp mutant [ 18 ] on Tf endocytosis in L . major . The enzymatically inactive GPI - PLCp mutant ( i . e . pUTK - Q81L _ GPIPLC ) did not augment Tf uptake in L . major , as the amount of Tf endocytosis in pUTK - Q81L _ GPIPLC / Lmajor was comparable to that obtained from cells expressing the vector ( pUTK ) alone ( Fig . 3 ) . These data suggest that a product of GPI - PLC enzyme activity ( i . e . either DAG or inositolpho - sphoglycan ) is probably needed for the enzyme’s effect on Tf endocytosis . Phorbol Ester or Diacylglycerols Stimulate Endocytosis of Tf in L . major Since enzyme activity is important for GPI - PLCp activation of endocytosis we tested if a lipid product of GPI cleavage ( i . e . DAG ) was a second messenger for the enzyme . Phorbol esters bind C1 - domains and are used to characterize DAG signaling pathways [ 19 ] . Therefore we tested whether phorbol ester or DAG would stimulate endocytosis of Tf in L . major . Pre - incubation of L . major harboring either pUTK or pUTK - GPIPLC with phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate ( PMA ) increased Tf endocytosis two to three - fold ( Fig . 4A ) in comparison to control cells that were treated with vehicle ( DMSO ) . In another control experiment , the alpha isomer of PMA ( i . e . 4 a - PMA ) did not stimulate endocytosis of Tf ( Fig . 4A ) , indicating that the effects of PMA are limited to the physiologically active 4 b - PMA isomer [ 20 ] . Figure 1 . Heterologously expressed GPI - PLCp activates endo - cytosis of Tf in Leishmania major . ( A ) Leishmania major CC1 promastigotes expressing GPI - PLC ( pUTK - GPIPLC ) or vector alone ( pUTK ) were cultured in a medium containing G418 ( 50 m g / ml ) . Cells ( 1 6 10 6 / ml ) were incubated with transferrin - Alexa Fluor 594 ( 25 m g / ml ) at 27 u C , and at specified time intervals cell - associated fluorescence was measured .

For this objective , either OAG ( 1 - oleoyl - 2 - acetyl - sn - glycerol ) or DMG ( 1 , 2 - dimyristoyl - sn - glycerol ) was pre - incubated with L . major for 30 min prior to endocytosis of Tf . OAG or DMG ( 250 nM ) stimulated Tf endocytosis three - fold in L . major ( as compared to untreated cells ( Fig . 4B ) ) . These data confirm that a ( i ) DAG regulates Tf endocytosis in L . major , and ( ii ) DAG is a second messenger in L . major . Protein Kinase C ( PKC ) Is Not Required for PMA - Stimulated Endocytosis PKC is a Ser / Thr kinase that mediates many physiological effects of DAG in vertebrates [ 21 ] . Therefore , we tested whether DAG - activated endocytosis in Leishmania or T . brucei required a PKC . Ro32 - 0432 , a cell - permeable active site - directed PKC inhibitor [ 22 , 23 ] was used for our study . We first tested whether general uptake of Tf in T . brucei was inhibited by Ro32 - 0432 . Towards this goal , cells were pre - incubated with the compound and endocytosis of Tf was measured afterwards . Ro32 - 0432 inhibited Tf endocytosis in T . brucei with an IC 50 ( concentration of the inhibitor needed to reduce Tf endocytosis by 50 % ) of 200 nM ( Fig . 5A ) . This result indicates that a Ser / Thr kinase is involved in some aspect of the uptake Tf in the trypanosome . We next investigated whether PMA - stimulated endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei depended on a Ser / Thr kinase . A C1 - domain of PKC binds PMA ( reviewed in [ 24 , 25 ] ) . Therefore , involvement of PKC in cellular events is obtained by sequential administration of an active - site directed inhibitor of PKC ( e . g . Ro32 - 0432 ) and a phorbol ester [ 26 , 27 ] . ( Ro32 - 0432 will inhibit a Ser / Thr kinase whose active site architecture is similar to that of PKC even if the Figure 2 . Endosome or glycosome - directed GPI - PLC stimulate endocytosis . Leishmania harboring pUTK - GPIPLCp , pUTK - GPIPLC - C269S / C273S , pUTK - GPIPLC - C269S / C270S / C273S , or pUTK - GPIPLC - Q81L were cultured in medium containing 50 m g / ml G418 and transferrin endocytosis was measured as described in Fig . 1 .

For our purposes , T . brucei was incubated with Ro32 - 0432 in a first stage . Afterwards , PMA was added to the cells in the second stage , and then endocytosis of Tf was measured at the final stage ( Fig . 5B ) . Added alone to T . brucei , Ro32 - 0432 inhibited whereas PMA activated endocytosis of Tf ( Fig . 5B ) . When T . brucei was pre - treated with Ro32 - 0432 , PMA activated Tf endocytosis 500 % , as compared to cells that were not treated with PMA after addition of the kinase inhibitor ( Fig . 5B ) . We conclude that Ro32 - 0432 cannot block PMA activation of Tf endocytosis . Therefore , the pathway for PMA - regulated endocytosis of Tf does not involve a PKC in T . brucei . However , a Ser / Thr kinase is important in a general pathway for endocytosis of Tf that is not dependent on DAG ( Fig . 5A ) . In L . major , similar results were obtained when the effect of Ro32 - 0432 on PMA - activated endocytosis of Tf were studied . Ro32 - 0432 inhibited Tf endocytosis ( IC 50 = 100 nM ) ( Fig . 5C ) . Strikingly , PMA still activated Tf endocytosis even when added after L . major had been preincubated Ro32 - 0432 ( Fig . 5D ) . Thus , PMA stimulation of Tf endocytosis in L . major does not depend a PKC - like Ser / Thr kinase . Identification of a Novel C1 - Like Domain in Trypanosomatids Having demonstrated that DAG regulates endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei , we expected to find C1 - domains that are used in vertebrates for recognition of the lipid encoded in the genome of the parasite . Surprisingly , no C1 - domains are annotated in T . brucei [ 28 ] . Thus , the bioinformatics predictions appear to be at odds with our experimental data . To resolve this conundrum , we hypothesized that C1 - domains in trypanosomes may not have been discovered because they have diverged significantly from the vertebrate C1 - domain to which they were compared during genome annotation . That is , the protein family ( Pfam ) ‘‘scores’’ of trypanosome C1 - domains failed to meet the ‘‘gathering cut - off’’ required for their annotation [ 29 ] . To test this theory we , in collaboration with Gaelle Blandin ( The Institute of Genomic Research ) , implemented a genome - wide search for C1 - like domains at low stringency . That effort produced 21 hits ( not presented ) of which those with E - values , 0 . 02 [ 30 ] were analyzed further with Pfam [ 29 ] . Top scoring trypanosome proteins from that analysis are presented in Table 1 . We hypothesized that C1 - like domains in T . brucei ( Table 1 ) might contain a unique peptide motif . To examine this theory , we tested whether the four highest scoring C1 - like domains from T . brucei ( Table 1 ) contained a recognizable pattern of amino acid residues , by extracting amino acid patterns in the T . brucei C1 - like domain with the algorithm PRATT [ 31 ] . The T . brucei C1 - like domains have six conserved cysteines ( in bold ) as part of the pattern L - x ( 9 , 12 ) - C - x ( 2 , 4 ) - C - x ( 3 , 9 ) - E - x ( 2 , 9 ) - F - x - C - x ( 2 ) - C - x ( 4 ) - C - Figure 5 . A Ser / Thr kinase Inhibitor does not block DAG - activated endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei or L . major . Bloodstream T . brucei ( 5 6 10 6 cells ) ( A ) or L . major promastigotes ( 1 6 10 6 cells ) ( C ) were incubated with DMSO ( vehicle ) or different amounts of Ro32 - 0432 for 10 min at 37 u C ( for T . brucei ) or 27 u C ( for L . major ) . Subsequently , endocytosis of Tf was measured as described earlier . T . brucei ( B ) or L . major ( D ) was incubated in medium containing Ro32 - 0432 ( 500 nM ) for 10 min ( i . e . , Stage I ) . Cells were then exposed to PMA ( 500 nM ) ( Stage II ) for another 10 min , and endocytosis of Tf was measured . A representative experiment is presented . Data plotted are means ( with standard deviations ) of triplicate determinations . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008538 . g005 Trypanosome Tf Endocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8538 x ( 2 ) - C ( PROSITE nomenclature [ 32 , 33 ] ) . An alignment of the T . brucei C1 - like domains is presented in Fig . 6A . Compared to a human C1 - domain , H - x - [ LIVMFYW ] - x ( 8 , 11 ) - C - x ( 2 ) - C - x ( 3 ) - [ LIVMFC ] - x ( 5 , 10 ) - C - x ( 2 ) - C - x ( 4 ) - [ HD ] - x ( 2 ) - C - x ( 5 , 9 ) - C , the T . brucei motif lacks a His residue at the N - terminus . In addition , the spacing between the six Cys residues is different in the two domains . For these reasons , we surmise that the T . brucei C1 - like domain that we term C1 _ 5 ( Fig . 6A ) has diverged significantly from the ( classic ) vertebrate C1 - domain . We extended our studies by checking whether C1 _ 5 domains were present in other trypanosomatids . Motif searches of the genomes of L . major and T . cruzi revealed that each organism contained a protein tyrosine ( Tyr ) kinase ( PTK ) with a C1 _ 5 domain , namely LmjF36 . 5350 in L . major , and Tc00 . 1047053510285 . 70 in T . cruzi . An alignment of the C1 _ 5 domains from PTKs of the trypanoso - matids is presented in Fig . 6B . Inhibition of Protein Tyrosine Kinase Blocks PMA - Stimulated Tf Endocytosis We speculated that effector proteins in T . brucei might use C1 _ 5 domains that binds DAG to activate proteins in the endocytic system for uptake of Tf . First , we postulated that C1 _ 5 proteins could interact directly with major polypeptides that are required for endocytosis , and influence activity of those proteins . Second , we envisioned that a C1 _ 5 protein might have a second domain with enzyme activity that might be activated by DAG to post - translationally modify proteins involved in endocytosis thereby enhancing Tf uptake . Our second hypothesis is based on a discovery that three C1 _ 5 proteins have domains with enzyme activity , namely , a PTK Tb11 . 01 . 2290 , and the ubiquitin ligases Tb09 . 211 . 4210 and Tb08 . 2909 . 320 ( Table 1 ) . In vertebrates , Tyr phosphorylation of some receptors modulates their endocytosis . And , ubiquitination of membrane proteins in yeasts and vertebrates accelerates their recruitment into endosomes . Therefore , we hypothesized that DAG might modulate endocytosis in T . brucei by influencing activity of PTKs . We used a pharmacological tools to evaluate ( i ) whether a T . brucei PTK ( TbPTK ) affects Tf endocytosis , and ( ii ) whether PMA - activated endocytosis of Tf requires TbPTK activity . Tyrphostin A47 ( TphA47 ) an inhibitor of PTKs in vertebrate cells [ 34 ] and in T . brucei [ 35 , 36 ] was used for these studies . Table 1 . C1 _ 5 ( C1 - like ) Domains in T . brucei .

We infer that the pathway for endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei involves activity of a TbPTK . Next , we determined whether PMA - activated Tf endocytosis required a TbPTK . T . brucei were pre - incubated with TphA47 before PMA was added , and Tf endocytosis quantitated . When TphA47 was added to cells prior to introduction of PMA , stimulation of Tf endocytosis by PMA was blocked ( Fig . 7B ) . From these data we conclude that a TbPTK is required for PMA - activated endocy - tosis of Tf in T . brucei . In sharp contrast , a Ser / Thr kinase ( e . g . PKC ) is not needed in the pathway for PMA - stimulated endocytosis of Tf in the trypanosome ( Fig . 5B ) . Similar studies were performed with L . major , since PMA and DAGs activated endocytosis of Tf in the parasite ( Fig . 4A and Fig . 4B ) . TphA47 inhibited Tf endocytosis in L . major ( IC 50 of 2 . 5 m M ) ( Fig . 7C ) . Preincubation of L . major with TphA47 before addition of PMA led to a 400 % reduction of phorbol ester - activated uptake of Tf , as compared to cell that were treated with PMA in absence of TphA47 ( Fig . 7D ) . Thus , PTKs in L . major act downstream of PMA activation of Tf endocytosis in the parasite , similar to our observations with T . brucei ( Fig . 7B ) . Discussion Transferrin Endocytosis in Trypanosomatids Is Stimulated by Diacylglycerol Iron is important for viability of T . brucei and Leishmania species [ 13 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ] . In both trypanosomatids the metal ion is acquired by endocytosis , following its binding to Tf which has a receptor ( or binding protein ) at the plasma membrane [ 14 , 41 , 42 ] . Some major components of the endocytic machinery ( e . g . , clathrin , Rabs and SNAREs ) affect endocytosis of Tf in trypanosomatids . However , small molecule and / or lipid regulators of Tf endocytosis have not been described . Thus , our demonstra - tion that DAG regulates Tf endocytosis in both T . brucei and L . major presents an opportunity to study the mechanisms by which the lipid influences the endocytic system in these deeply - diverged eukaryotes . In L . major , stable expression of a GPI - PLC activates endocytosis of Tf ( Fig . 1A and Fig . 3 ) . Interestingly , the intracellular location of the enzyme either on endosomes ( e . g . , unmutated GPI - PLC ) or glycosomes ( e . g . , Cys269 , 270 , 273Ser mutant of GPI - PLC ) [ 43 ] does not change the effect of the enzyme on Tf endocytosis ( Fig . 2 ) . These Figure 7 . A PTK inhibitor blocks phorbol ester - stimulated endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei and L . major .

Thereafter , cells were incubated with PMA ( 500 nM ; final conc . ) for 15 min , and endocytosis of Tf was measured as described the legend to Figure 1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008538 . g007 Trypanosome Tf Endocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8538 data are consistent with a proposal that GPI - PLC releases a diffusible product ( diacylglycerol ( DAG ) ) that mediates the effect of the enzyme on Tf endocytosis . In support of this claim , exogenous DAG ( or PMA , a DAG mimic ) stimulate uptake of Tf as predicted ( Fig . 4 ) . Tyrosine Kinases Are Effectors for DAG - Regulated Endocytosis in T . brucei and L . major Our data indicate that a PTK is involved in DAG signaling for endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei ( Fig . 7B ) and L . major ( Fig . 7C ) . Participation of Tyr kinase , instead of a Ser / Thr kinase ( Fig . 5B ) , in DAG signaling is supported by bioinformatic analysis of the parasite genome . Whereas the protein Tb11 . 01 . 2290 ( Table 1 ) contains both PTK and C1 _ 5 domains , no Ser / Thr kinase in the genomes of either Leishmania or T . brucei has a C1 _ 5 domain . Therefore neither T . brucei nor Leishmania has a classic PKC . We speculate that Tb11 . 01 . 2290 in T . brucei and LmjF36 . 5350 in L . major could be effector PTKs for DAG regulation of Tf endocytosis in the parasites . The enzymes may activate endocytosis by phosphorylating clathrin , actin , adaptins or other core compo - nents of the endocytosis machinery . In vertebrates , the cytoplasmic PTKs Src , Abl and Lyn modulate endocytosis by phosphorylating components of the endocytic machinery ( e . g . clathrin , AP2 , dynamin and WASP ) ( reviewed in [ 44 ] ) . Our working hypothesis for the role of PTKs and C1 _ 5 - domain proteins in DAG - regulated endocytosis in T . brucei or L . major is summarized in Fig . 8 . Diacylglycerol Signaling Pathways in Trypanosomatids and Vertebrates DAG is an intracellular second messenger for signaling in eukaryotes . In vertebrates , ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases and seven transmembrane receptors can activate phosphatidyli - nositol phospholipases C that cleave phosphoinositides . DAG released by the phospholipases C activates PKC to phosphorylate several substrates . Due to the multiplicity of its targets , PKC can regulate several pathways including apoptosis , cell proliferation , differentiation , and endocytosis ( reviewed in [ 45 ] ) . Receptor endocytosis in vertebrates can be controlled by phorbol esters without PKC participation . For example , Munc13 which lacks a kinase domain binds DAG and regulates exocytosis by interacting with Rab and SNARE [ 46 , 47 ] . Trypanosomatid genomes do not encode the most common eukaryote signaling systems ( e . g . receptor Tyr kinases , heterotrimeric G proteins , and G - protein coupled receptors ) . Consequently few signaling pathways have been characterized completely in trypano - somatids ( reviewed in [ 48 , 49 ] ) . Signaling with intracellular second messengers has four general components , namely , ( i ) ligands , ( ii ) receptors , ( iii ) effectors , and ( iv ) physiological targets . DAG is a signaling ligand in trypanosomatids ( Fig . 4 , Fig . 5 and Fig . 7 ) and in vertebrates ( [ 2 ] . However , apart from the ligand it appears that other components in the pathway have diverged from those in humans . First , DAG receptors in vertebrates contain a classic C1 - domain [ 50 ] . Surprisingly , the vertebrate C1 - domain is absent from the genomes of L . major and T . brucei . Instead we found a divergent C1 _ 5 domain that might be the receptor for DAG in trypanosomatids ( Fig . 6 ) . Second , in vertebrates a majority of DAG signaling pathways depend on Ser / Thr kinases ( PKCs ) [ 26 , 51 , 52 ] . In contrast , DAG - stimulated endocytosis of Tf in T . brucei and L . major depends on protein Tyr kinase ( Fig . 7B and Fig . 7D ) . Thus , effector enzymes for DAG signaling in L . major and T . brucei are Tyr kinases instead of Ser / Thr kinases . Finally , enhanced uptake of Tf in response to DAG ( or phorbol ester ) treatment is unique to trypanosomatids . In human cells , PMA treatment does not increase endocytosis of Tf [ 53 , 54 ] . During a trypanosome infection of vertebrates , the parasite competes with host cells for Tf in host blood . Therefore , DAG stimulation of Tf uptake may contribute to virulence of the parasite by helping T . brucei to acquire sufficient amounts of the ligand ( and indirectly iron ) to sustain its extracellular existence in host blood . In brief , L . major , T . brucei and vertebrates use DAG as a second messenger for intracellular signaling . However , the effector enzymes are not identical , and by extension the targets of the activated kinases could be different . Consequently , studies of DAG signaling pathways in trypanosomes are likely to yield new insights into the diversity of DAG signaling in eukaryotes . Materials and Methods Cell Culture Transfected Leishmania major CC1 expressing GPI - PLC ( pUTK - GPIPLC ) and vector alone ( pUTK ) [ 17 ] were grown at 27 u C to a maximum density of 5 6 10 6 / ml in M199 ( supplemented with 5 % FBS , 40 mM HEPES , 0 . 0005 % hemin , 0 . 0001 % biotin , 0 . 1 mM adenine , and 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic ) [ 55 ] in presence of 50 m g / ml G418 .

A Working Model for DAG Activation of Tf Endocytosis in Trypanosomatids . Based on our biochemical ( Figs . 1 through Fig . 6 ) , bioinformatic ( Fig . 6 , Table 1 ) , and pharmacological data ( Fig . 7 ) , we propose that DAG binds to a C1 _ 5 domain of a PTK in T . brucei ( or L . major ) . The trypanosomatid PTK is activated by DAG , and the enzyme phosphorylates components of the endosomal pathway to activate uptake of Tf . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008538 . g008 Trypanosome Tf Endocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8538 transfection , G418 ( dissolved in PBS and filter sterilized ) was added to a final concentration of 30 m g / ml . Stable transfectants were maintained in M199 medium containing 50 m g / ml G418 . Transferrin Endocytosis Assays Leishmania was cultured to a density of 5 6 10 6 ml 2 1 .

For T . brucei , endocytosis of transferrin - Alexa Fluor 594 was performed as described earlier ( [ 7 ] ) . Values obtained for a ‘‘blank’’ ( i . e . without Tf ) was subtracted from experimental readings , and relative fluorescence units were plotted . Each time point is a mean ( 6 std deviation ) of triplicate measurements . Phorbol ester and diacylglycerols were pre - incubated with L . major at 27 u C ( or T . brucei at 37 u C ) for 15 min at concentrations stated in the respective figures . Cells were washed with ice - cold serum - free IMDM medium before transferrin uptake was documented as described above . Author Contributions Conceived and designed the experiments : SS KMW .
