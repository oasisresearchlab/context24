In bovine embryos the formation of the hypoblast has been partially studied , and evidence shows that MEK signalling plays a limited role in the segregation of this lineage . Here we explored the role of different signalling pathways during lineage segregation in the bovine embryo using immunofluorescence analysis of NANOG and SOX17 as readouts of epiblast and hypoblast , respectively . Results : We show that SOX17 starts to be expressed in 16 – 32 - cell stage embryos , whereas NANOG is first detected from 8 - cell stage . SOX17 is first co - expressed with NANOG , but these markers become mutually exclusive by the late blastocyst stage . By assessing the expression kinetics of NANOG / SOX17 we show that inhibition of MEK signalling can eliminate SOX17 expression in bovine blastocysts , without altering NANOG expression . Modulation of WNT , PKC and LIF did not affect NANOG expression in the epiblast when used in combination with the ERK inhibitor . Conclusions : This study shows that SOX17 can be used as a reliable early marker of hypoblast in the bovine , and based on its expression profile we show that the hypoblast segregates in day 7 blastocysts . Furthermore , SOX17 expression is abolished using 1 μ M of PD0325901 , without affecting the NANOG population in the epiblast . Modulation of WNT , PKC and LIF are not sufficient to support enhanced NANOG expression in the epiblast when combined with ERK inhibitor , indicating that additional signalling pathways should be examined to determine their potential roles in epiblast expansion . Keywords : Hypoblast , Epiblast , SOX17 , NANOG , Bovine embryos , Lineage segregation , PD0325901 , LIF , t2iGö , WNT inhibitor Background The bovine embryo transits from the morula to the blasto - cyst stage between days 5 – 8 after fertilization . This period is characterized by the emergence of the pluripotent epi - blast ( EPI ) and the segregation of two extraembryonic lin - eages , the trophectoderm ( TE ) and the hypoblast ( Hypo ) . The molecular mechanisms of emergence of bovine pluri - potent cells and early lineage segregation are not well understood , in part because we have limited knowledge of the expression of key lineage markers in this species . The pluripotency genes OCT4 ( POU5F1 ) and SOX2 are expressed from the eight - cell stage , whereas NANOG is first detected in the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of bovine em - bryos [ 1 , 2 ] . GATA6 is one of the earliest hypoblast markers in mice , where it displays a mutually exclusive ex - pression profile with NANOG in the ICM . In bovine , as in human embryos [ 3 , 4 ] , GATA6 and NANOG are co - expressed in many ICM cells ( ~ 40 % ) , marking hypoblast precursor cells [ 5 ] . SOX17 is also expressed in ICM cells , however the expression profile of these cells indicates that this marker identifies cells committed to hypoblast in this species [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] . In bovine embryos SOX17 protein ex - pression has never been reported , however SOX17 mRNA was detected in presumptive hypoblast cells isolated from blastocysts that also expressed other well - known hypoblast © The Author ( s ) . 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons license , and indicate if changes were made .

Studies exploring the roles of signalling pathways during lineage segregation showed that ERK modulation affects hypoblast development in human , pig and cattle embryos , although the effects are less pronounced than in mouse embryos [ 3 , 5 , 9 – 11 ] . Moreover ERK inhibition in combination with WNT signalling stimulation was reported to prevent hypo - blast segregation in mouse embryos and facilitates embry - onic stem cell derivation [ 12 ] . However , this approach does not eliminate all hypoblast cells in bovine blastocysts , simi - lar to observations in human and pig embryos , suggesting that other signals may regulate hypoblast segregation [ 5 , 9 – 11 , 13 ] . In view of these differences among mammals , a bet - ter understanding of early gene expression is needed . A deeper understanding of the regulation of signalling path - ways in bovine will contribute to the development of better strategies for the isolation of pluripotent cells from bovine blastocysts . In this study , we investigated the pattern of SOX17 ex - pression during embryo development and used this marker to determine the effects of modulating signalling pathways in the segregation of the hypoblast in bovine blastocysts . Results Epiblast and hypoblast markers in bovine embryos The expression of NANOG , SOX2 and SOX17 was eval - uated between days 2 – 8 on in vitro produced embryos ( Fig . 1a and b ) . SOX2 expression was detected first in 4 - cell embryos , with both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization ( Fig . 1a ) . NANOG and SOX2 co - expression was first observed in 8 - cell embryos and was maintained until blastocysts at day 8 ( Fig . 1a and b ) . Strong NANOG and SOX2 co - expression was observed in most ICM cells ( Fig . 1b and c ) , however , weak expression was also observed in TE cells of some embryos ( see Add - itional file 1 : Figure S1A and S1B ) . In day 8 blastocysts SOX2 and GATA6 co - localized in most nuclei ( see Add - itional file 1 : Figure S2A and S2B ) . Analysis of immuno - fluorescence ( IF ) staining showed that 75 ± 5 % of SOX2 positive cells were also NANOG positive ( N = 10 ) and 91 ± 5 % GATA6 positive ( N = 3 ) ( Fig . 1c and Additional file 1 : Figure S2B ) . In day 8 hatched blastocysts GATA6 expression was restricted to ICM cells ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2A ) , although in some day 8 embryos weak GATA6 expression was also detected in the TE . The high co - expression of SOX2 with NANOG and GATA6 in the ICM indicates that these markers cannot be used to discriminate between epiblast and hypoblast in bovine blastocysts . As SOX17 has been previously used in mouse and human embryos to identify the emergence of the hypoblast [ 4 , 14 ] , we performed a time - course IF analysis from the 4 - cell to the blastocyst stage . SOX17 is initially detected in the nucleus of 16 – 32 cell embryos ( Fig . 1a ) , where it largely overlapped with NANOG . In day 8 blastocysts it became mutually exclusive within the ICM ( Fig . 1a and c ) . In contrast , GATA4 was de - tected in a very small number of cells in d8 blastocysts ( Additional file 1 : Figures S2C and S2D ) and increased only in d10 embryos ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2E ) . These results indicate that SOX17 is a reliable marker for identification of the emergent hypoblast lineage in the bovine embryo . In vitro development of bovine embryos in serum free conditions To study how specific signalling pathways affect lineage segregation , we tested a serum free culture medium that supports in vitro development to days 8 to 9 , as previously shown for pig embryos [ 9 ] . Bovine embryos were treated from day 5 to 8 , since culturing in N2B27 from the zygote stage had a negative impact on day 2 cleavage rates ( data not shown ) . Culture in SOF and N2B27 media resulted in similar blastocysts rates at days 7 and 8 ( Additional file 2 : Table S1 and S2 ) , how - ever , embryo quality based on visual criteria was appre - ciably better in N2B27 than in SOF medium ( Fig . 2a ) . Immunofluorescent staining showed greater number of NANOG and SOX17 positive cells in N2B27 cultured embryos compared to SOF , where SOX17 was almost absent ( Fig . 2b ) . Based on these results we cultured the embryos in N2B27 in subsequent experiments . MEK inhibition blocks hypoblast specification To determine the role of MEK signalling during bovine hypoblast specification a dose response to the MEK in - hibitor PD0325901 ( PD032 ) was performed ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . At low concentrations of PD032 ( 0 . 4 – 2 μ M ) , devel - opment to blastocyst was not affected ( Additional file 2 : Table S3 ) , however the total number of cells in - creased in all groups ( Table 1 ) . To discriminate be - tween ICM and TE we stained embryos with SOX17 and NANOG ( Fig . 3a ) , to label ICM cells , and counter - stained these with DAPI , which was used to determine the number of TE cells . The number of ICM cells was significantly reduced in treated embryos compared to controls ; however the number of TE cells significantly increased in all treated groups ( Table 1 ) . Analysis of the ICM cells showed that increasing concentrations of MEK inhibition ( between 1 and 2 μ M ) resulted in elim - ination of SOX17 cells , however the number of NANOG cells remained unchanged ( Fig . 3 ) . A further increase in dosage ( 2 . 5 – 10 μ M ) had no effect in blasto - cyst development , except for the 10 μ M group which showed a higher developmental rate ( Additional file 2 : Table S4 ) . However the number of TE and ICM cells was reduced in this group compared to lower Canizo et al . BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 2 of 13 concentrations ( Table 2 ) . The ratio of ICM : TE was re - duced in all PD0325901 treatments compared to con - trols . These results show that a low dose ( 0 . 4 μ M ) of MEK inhibition has a trophic effect on TE , whereas hypoblast segregation is inhibited at higher concentra - tions ( > 1 μ M ) ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . The number of NANOG positive cells within the ICM did not significantly in - crease when MEK inhibitor was added at 1 μ M com - pared to 0 . 4 μ M , suggesting that MEK inhibition does not promote epiblast fate , but rather prevents hypoblast segregation . Further increase of MEK inhibitor to 10 μ M had a negative effect on TE and ICM Fig . 1 Expression of NANOG , SOX2 and SOX17 in day 2 – 8 bovine embryos . a Immunofluorescence detection of NANOG , SOX2 and SOX17 in different stage embryos . b Line scan plot of relative intensity of NANOG , SOX2 and SOX17 in ICM cells of day 8 blastocysts .

BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 3 of 13 compartments ( Table 2 ) , although hatching rates reached > 80 % in 10 μ M treatment with PD0325901 . t2iGöLIF partially affects SOX17 expression in the bovine ICM We next studied the crosstalk between MEK signal - ling and other known pathways involved in pluripo - tency maintenance in vitro ( Fig . 5 ) . We cultured day 5 morulae in N2B27 medium supplemented with PD0325901 , CHIR99021 , Gö6983 , h - LIF and combina - tions ( t2iGöLIF ) thereof for 48 and 72 h . In all conditions analysed , most blastocysts hatched from the zona pellucida , and although the number of blastocyst was not significantly different between DMSO ( control ) , h - LIF and t2iGö + h - LIF , a signifi - cantly lower blastocyst rate was obtained in t2iGö - only group ( see Additional file 2 : Table S5 ) . All treatments resulted in noticeable increased ICM : TE ratio , however , the total cell number was significantly re - duced in t2iGöLIF ( Table 3 ) . This was due to a reduction in TE cells , suggesting that t2iGöLIF affects TE proliferation . Finally , the number of ICM cells in t2iGöLIF group was not different to control , however , it increased in t2iGö and LIF ( Table 3 ) . To correlate the changes in the number of ICM cells and hypoblast segregation we analysed NANOG and SOX17 expression by IF ( Fig . 5a ) . Embryos treated with t2iGö , and h - LIF had significantly more NANOG cells than controls ( Fig . 5b ) . However , the proportion of NANOG cells in the ICM was significantly greater in t2iGöLIF treatment compared to other groups ( Table 3 ) . Of all treatments , only supplementation with h - LIF re - sulted in increased number of SOX17 cells . In summary , t2iGöLIF had a partial effect in reducing the number of SOX17 positive cells in the bovine ICM , whereas h - LIF had a trophic effect on the hypoblast . MEK and WNT signalling inhibition reduce SOX17 expression but do not expand NANOG in the ICM We next assessed the effect of MEK ( PD032 ) and WNT inhibition ( IWP2 ) on SOX17 expression , since our previ - ous results showed that inhibition of ERK alone resulted in the absence of SOX17 cells without increase in the number of NANOG positive cells in the ICM ( Fig . 6 ) . None of the treatments interfered with the formation of morphologically normal blastocysts ( Fig . 6a and see Additional file 2 : Table S6 ) , however , 10 μ M PD032 re - sulted in the highest percentage of blastocysts and IWP2 treatment in the lowest ( see Additional file 2 : Table S6 ) . IWP2 treatment reduced by almost half the percentage of blastocyst at day 8 compared to control ( N2B27 with DMSO ) . IWP2 treatment increased total cell number in blastocysts , mainly due to an increase in TE cells ( Add - itional file 2 : Table S6 ) . In contrast , treatment with PD032 ( 10 μ M ) decreased the total cell number , which was due to a decrease in the number of ICM cells ( Table 4 ) . Although WNT inhibition alone did not affect the number of NANOG and SOX17 positive cells ( Fig . 6b ) , embryos treated with PD032 had almost no SOX17 expressing cells ( Fig . 6b ) . The combination of inhibitors also decreased by half the number of NANOG positive cells , compared to con - trol and WNT inhibition only . Finally , the combined use of ERK and WNT inhibitors did not result in an increase in the number of NANOG positive cells . Discussion SOX17 marks the emerging hypoblast in the bovine embryo To gain insight into the mechanism of lineage specifica - tion in bovine preimplantation development we assessed the expression of the key developmental regulators Fig . 2 Effect of serum free media in the development of day 7 blastocysts . a Representative bright field ( left ) and immunostaining ( right ) images of bovine IVF embryos cultured in SOF 0 . 8 % BSA and N2B27 . b Number of cells per embryo cultured under two conditions .

BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 4 of 13 NANOG , SOX2 and SOX17 , which have been shown to be functionally required for mouse early embryo devel - opment . Nanog and Gata6 are co - expressed at the 8 - cell stage in the mouse [ 15 ] , and their expression does not become mutually exclusive until the 32 - to 64 - cell stage [ 15 ] . In bovine embryos , NANOG protein was reported at day 7 ( E7 ) in the ICM although mRNA was detected from the 8 - cell stage [ 1 , 2 , 5 ] . RNAseq analysis of in vitro [ 16 – 18 ] and in vivo [ 19 ] derived bovine embryos also confirms the presence of NANOG transcripts at the 8 - cell stage . We also detected NANOG protein in bovine early embryos ( from 8 to 64 cells ) , and co - expression with SOX2 from 8 - cell stage until d8 blastocyst , when NANOG is downregulated earlier than SOX2 in putative hypoblast cells . Our findings are in contrast to previous reports in bovine showing NANOG and SOX2 expres - sion from the morula stage onwards [ 1 , 2 ] . However , a difference with these studies is that all our IFs were performed in ZP - free embryos . Preliminary IF tests with ZP - enclosed embryos failed to provide consistent staining for any of the markers tested , probably due to reduced permeability to the antibodies ( Additional file 1 : Figure S3 ) . NANOG staining showed very weak signal , whereas strong background accompanied SOX2 and SOX17 staining . It is therefore possible that the presence of ZP may interfere with the Fig . 3 Effect of low dose of MEK inhibitor on NANOG and SOX17 expression in day 8 IVF bovine embryos . a Immunostaining detection of NANOG and SOX17 in representative day 8 bovine IVF blastocysts .

As SOX2 and GATA6 were co - expressed in most bovine ICM cells at day 8 , we studied SOX17 and GATA4 expression , as alternative markers of hypo - blast . In mice , Sox17 expression starts at the 32 - cell stage and marks the nascent hypoblast . These cells then express Gata4 at the 64 - cell stage [ 14 ] . In human , SOX17 is initially detected in 32 - cell stage embryos and also precedes GATA4 expres - sion [ 4 ] . Here we show that in bovine embryos SOX17 is localized in the nucleus from 16 to 32 Fig . 5 Effect of t2iGö h - LIF on NANOG and SOX17 expression on day 8 bovine embryos . a Immunostaining detection of NANOG and SOX17 in representative day 8 bovine IVF blastocysts .

BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 8 of 13 cell stage and becomes mutually exclusive with NANOG in putative hypoblast cells on day 7 / 8 blastocysts . As in human and mouse embryos , GATA4 is restricted to hypoblast cells of day 8 or older bovine blastocysts , indicating that SOX17 precedes GATA4 activation . Together , our analysis shows that SOX17 marks the nascent hypoblast , and that these cells segregate from a NANOG positive population in the ICM . Effect of signalling modulation on bovine embryo development and hypoblast segregation The use of 2i accelerates bovine blastocyst development , promotes expression of epiblast markers NANOG and SOX2 and reduces expression of the hypoblast marker GATA4 [ 10 ] . Suppression of hypoblast segregation can also be achieved using a MEK inhibitor ( PD0325901 ) at high concentrations ( 10 μ M or more ) , which could be due to off target effects on unknown signalling pathways [ 11 ] . Our dose response experiment shows that low dose of MEK inhibition ( 0 . 4 – 2 μ M ) increases the number of TE cells , whilst expression of SOX17 was almost elimi - nated at 1 μ M and higher , indicating that in bovine em - bryos a modest increase ( ~ 2 . 5 - fold ) of PD0325901 from the concentration used in mouse , is sufficient to abro - gate hypoblast segregation . The mechanism underlying the elimination of SOX17 expression in bovine embryos is still unclear , and more studies are needed to clarify the ef - fect of MEK inhibition in the hypoblast and the potential effects of high concentration of MEK inhibitor on other intracellular signalling pathways . Notably , our study shows for the first time a trophic effect of MEK inhibition in the bovine TE , in contrasts to findings in mouse embryos [ 20 ] , highlighting potential species differences in the role of ERK signalling during TE development . To gain further understanding on what other signals may interfere with hypoblast segregation in bovine embryos we used more complex culture conditions previously reported for derivation of naïve h - ESC , consisting of N2B27 medium supplemented with titrated 2i + LIF and the PKC inhibitor Gö6983 . We found that t2iGö alone yielded lower blasto - cyst rates , despite the increased size of the ICM in these embryos . The ICM maintained similar proportion of hypo - blast cells , however when LIF was added , SOX17 expres - sion was significantly reduced . These observations are consistent with findings in mouse embryos showing that PKC inhibition delays the basal rate of cavitation [ 21 ] and participates in trophectoderm fate [ 22 ] . When LIF is added to this cocktail , blastocyst yields increase , probably as a re - sult proliferative and anti - apoptotic effects of JAK / STAT3 and PI3K / Akt , respectively [ 23 , 24 ] . LIF alone , however , promotes expansion of hypoblast in bovine embryos , as ob - served in mouse embryos [ 25 ] . We also detected higher number of NANOG positive cells under these conditions , suggesting that LIF has a trophic effect in the bovine ICM by increasing NANOG and SOX17 positive cells at day 8 . These observations are consistent with previous findings in bovine embryos showing that inhibition of JAK / STAT in - terferes with ICM formation , but trophectoderm commit - ment was not affected [ 26 ] . Additionally , in line with our results , JAK inhibition in bovine embryos leads to reduction in both epiblast ( NANOG and FGF4 ) and hypoblast ( SOX1 7 and PDGFR α ) transcripts , and other naïve pluripotency - related genes ( KLF4 , TFCP2L1 ) and STAT3 [ 26 ] . Together , these observations suggest that the com - bined use of an inhibitor of the TE pathway ( PKC ) and an agonist of TE inhibition ( WNT ) results in reduced blasto - cyst development and increased ICM : TE ratio , in part due to the reduced specification of TE lineage . When LIF is added to this cocktail ( t2iGö + LIF ) it promotes expansion of NANOG cells in the ICM , whilst SOX17 expression is reduced , possibly due to the inhibition of MAPK signalling . Finally , we analysed ERK and WNT inhibition during hypoblast segregation . In marmoset , hypoblast differenti - ation is reduced by ERK and WNT inhibition , whilst NANOG expression in the epiblast increases [ 27 ] . WNT inhibition combined with FGF supplementation is also used in primates , including human , for the establish - ment of both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) [ 28 ] . The WNT signalling pathway is active in bovine blastocysts , and canonical WNT stimulation inhibits TE formation , whereas WNT inhibition by DKK1 promotes TE and hypoblast proliferation [ 29 , 30 ] . Consistent with these results we show that WNT inhib - ition with IWP2 also promotes TE proliferation , however the number of SOX17 positive cells was unaffected and the number of NANOG positive cells increased . The dif - ferences with the previous studies could be due to the different efficacy of WNT inhibition by DKK1 and IWP2 over the course of the treatment . Conclusion This study shows that SOX17 can be used as a reliable early marker of hypoblast in the bovine , and based on its expression profile we show that the hypoblast segregates in day 7 blastocysts . Furthermore , SOX17 expression is abolished using 1 μ M of PD0325901 , without affecting the NANOG population in the epiblast . Modulation of WNT , PKC and LIF are not sufficient to support en - hanced NANOG expression in the epiblast when com - bined with ERK inhibitor ( Fig . 7 ) , indicating that additional signalling pathways should be examined to determine their potential roles in epiblast expansion . Methods Research protocols followed the guidelines stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching . Canizo et al . BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 9 of 13 Chemicals and reagents All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich unless otherwise stated . Oocyte collection Ovaries from cycling beef heifers ( Bos taurus ) were col - lected from local abattoirs and transported to the labora - tory at 25 – 30 °C . Cumulus oocyte complexes ( COCs ) were aspirated from follicles of 2 to 8 mm diameter using a 21 - gauge needle and collected into Hepes - buffered Tyr - ode ’ s albumin ( Hepes - TALP ) [ 31 ] . COCs with homoge - neous ooplasm and more than three complete layers of cumulus cells , corresponding to grades 1 and 2 according to de Loos et al . , [ 32 ] , were selected under a stereomicro - scope and washed 3 times in Hepes - TALP . In vitro maturation The selected COCs were in vitro matured in 100 μ l drop - lets of bicarbonate - buffered TCM - 199 ( 31100 – 035 ; Gibco ) , containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( 013 / 07 ; Inter - negocios S . A . ) , 10 mg / ml follicle - stimulating hormone ( NIH - FSH - P1 , Folltropin , Bioniche ) , 0 . 3 mM sodium pyruvate ( P2256 ) , 100 mM cysteamine ( M9768 ) , and 2 % antibiotic - antimycotic ( ATB , 15240 – 096 ; Gibco ) ; and cov - ered in mineral oil ( M8410 ) . The oocytes were incubated for 22 h at 39 °C under 6 . 5 % CO 2 in humidified air . IVF procedures and embryo culture Embryos used in Figs . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 were produced fol - lowing the protocol described by Hiriart et al . , [ 33 ] . For embryos used in Fig . 5 embryos were produced accord - ing to the protocol detailed in [ 34 ] . Experiments be - tween the two laboratories were not compared to each other . All treatments were carried out in N2B27 base medium from day 5 onwards . In vitro fertilization was performed following the proto - col by Hiriart et al . , ( 2013 ) . Frozen semen was thawed and washed twice by centrifugation in Brackett - Oliphant medium ( BO ) supplemented with 5 mM caffeine ( C4144 ) and 20 IU / mL heparin ( H3149 ) . Sperm dilution was ad - justed to 16 × 10 6 spermatozoa / ml adding BO containing 10 mg / mL bovine serum albumin ( A6003 ) . Sperm was then co - incubated with IVM COCs in 100 μ l droplets of the sperm suspension for 5 h at 39 °C under 6 . 5 % CO 2 in humidified air . Presumptive zygotes were washed three times in Hepes - TALP and cumulus cells were removed by vortexing for 2 min in hyaluronidase ( H4272 ) ( 1 mg / mL in Dulbecco ’ s PBS ) . Denuded presumptive zygotes were cul - tured in 50 μ l droplets of Synthetic Oviductal Fluid ( SOF ) supplemented with foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 2 . 5 % and covered with mineral oil , at 39 °C under 6 . 5 % CO 2 in hu - midified air . Cleavage was evaluated on day 2 and devel - opment to blastocyst on days 7 and 8 . Embryos from morula to blastocyst stage were cultured in 20 μ l droplets of N2B27 medium and in those experiments that included inhibitors or DMSO , medium was changed after 48 h . Embryos used to generate Fig . 5 were produced ac - cording to the protocol detailed in [ 34 ] . Briefly , COCs were repeatedly pipetted until 2 – 3 layers of granulosa cells were left around the oocyte . Groups of 40 – 50 COCs were then incubated in 0 . 5 ml of sperm at a con - centration of 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 × 10 6 sperm / ml of fertilization medium and cultured for 20 h at 39 °C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in 95 % N 2 . After 20 h ( day 1 ) , embryos were washed twice in HEPES buffered modified synthetic oviductal fluid ( H - SOF ) medium and presumptive zygotes were trans - ferred into droplets with BBH7 medium [ 35 ] until day Fig . 7 Summary of the signalling pathways operating during bovine embryo development . Diagrammatic representation of the signalling pathways investigated in our study . Small molecule inhibitors are indicated with red letters . Stimulatory pathways are indicated with arrows , and inhibitory pathways with blunt ends Canizo et al . BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 10 of 13 5 . Embryo culture was carried out at 39 °C , in a humidi - fied incubator with a gaseous atmosphere of 5 % CO2 , 5 % O2 and 90 % N 2 . Treatments were carried out from day 5 in droplets of N2B27 medium . DMSO was added to control group to the level used for the inhibitors . Serum free culture of bovine embryos Between days 5 – 7 / 8 embryos were cultured in two serum free media i ) Synthetic Oviductal Fluid medium , supple - mented with 0 . 8 % of BSA and ii ) N2B27 stem cell culture medium . For a final volume of 5 ml , N2B27 was made by adding 2 . 5 ml of DMEM / F12 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific catalogue number 12500 – 062 ) , 2 . 5 ml of Neurobasal medium ( GIBCO , Thermo Fisher Scientific , catalogue number 21103 – 049 ) , 25 μ l of N2 100X supplement ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , catalogue number 17502048 ) , 50 μ l of B27 50X supplement ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , catalogue number 112587010 ) , 5 μ l of insulin ( 10 mg / ml , Sigma Aldrich catalogue number I9278 ) , 0 . 8 % of BSA and 50 μ l of 100X penicillin / streptomycin solution . Medium was prepared , aliquoted and frozen at − 20 °C until use . We performed IVF runs in triplicate for immunostain - ing analysis ( fixing the hatched embryos at day 8 ) . Modulation of signalling pathways MEK inhibition dose response curve : from day 5 , em - bryos were cultured in N2B27 with DMSO ( control ) or in N2B27 with 0 . 4 – 10 μ M of PD0325901 ( TOCRIS , cata - logue number 4192 ) . Development was evaluated at day 7 and 8 and embryos were classified as BL : blastocyst , EB : expanded blastocyst , BHing : hatching blastocyst and BHed : hatched blastocyst . Hatched embryos were fixed with 4 % of PFA at day 8 prior to immunostaining ana - lysis . For MEK and Wnt inhibition experiments day 5 embryos were cultured in N2B27 with i ) 10 μ M of PD0325901 , ii ) 2 . 5 μ M of IWP2 ( Stemgent , catalogue number 04 – 0034 ) , and iii ) the combination of 10 μ M PD0325901 and 2 . 5 μ M IWP2 . For t2iGö + LIF , t2iGö and LIF , a modified concentration of 1 μ M CHIR ( TOCRIS , catalogue number 4423 ) , 1 μ M of PD0325901 , 2 μ M of PKC inhibitor Gö6983 ( AXON MEDCHEM , ) and 20 ng / ml of h - LIF ( Peprotech , catalogue number 300 – 05 ) were used . IF of whole embryos Immunostaining of bovine embryos without ZP was per - formed according to the protocol detailed in Nichols et al . , [ 20 ] . Primary antibodies used in this study were : rabbit anti - human NANOG ( dilution 1 : 200 , catalogue number 500 - P236 , Peprotech ) , goat anti - human SOX17 ( dilution 1 : 200 , catalogue number AF1924 , R & D com - pany ) , rabbit anti - human GATA6 ( dilution 1 : 100 , cata - logue number 22600 , ABCAM ) , goat anti - mouse C terminus Gata4 ( dilution 1 : 100 , catalogue number sc - 1237 , Santa Cruz ) and goat anti - human SOX2 ( dilution 1 : 200 , catalogue number sc - 17320 , Santa Cruz ) . Appro - priate secondary antibodies were used as reported before [ 36 ] . Embryos were mounted on slides with Fluoroshield with DAPI mounted reagent ( catalogue number F6057 , Sigma Aldrich ) . Images from immunostained embryos were taken under an epifluorescence microscope and were analysed using the FIJI software ( ImageJ ) . In all cases , background was subtracted and generally a Gaussian filter was applied . A representative negative control embryo , in which the level of the background was established , is shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S4 . The function multichannel plot profile from BAR ( Broadly Applicable Routines ) tools in FIJI was used to detect co - localization of fluorescent signals . For counting cells , we created masks for each channel and used the tool analyse particles . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using InfoStat software [ 37 ] . Fluorescence intensity expressed in Arbitrary Units ( A . U . ) was analysed through Student ’ s t test when two mean values were compared ( Additional file 1 : Figures S1B and S4B ) . Number of NANOG and SOX17 cells per embryo ( by definition , a response variable following a Poisson distribution ) was compared using a non - parametric ANOVA ( Kruskal Wallis , KW ) . A Generalized Linear Mixed Models assay ( GLMM ) with Poisson family and log link function was used for the total number of cells ( DAPI ) , ICM and TE number of cells per embryo analysis . GLMM were applied when median comparisons were around the significance level but higher , in order to resolve differences not detected previously in KW test due to high dispersion from random effects , this was the case of DAPI , ICM and TE counts per embryo . In GLMM the “ type of medium ” was analysed as fixed effect and the “ number of IVF run ” was used as random effect due to random variability between batches of ovaries , days and culture conditions . Appropriate link functions were ap - plied for the analyses ; results are presented on the ob - served scale after application of the inverse link function . Proportions ( percentage of cells , by definition a re - sponse variable following a Binomial distribution ) were also analysed by GLMM but with Binomial distribution and with logit as link function as indicated in the foot - notes of the tables . Differences between treatments were considered significant at p value < 0 . 05 and detected by DGC contrast [ 38 ] . InfoStat implements a friendly inter - face of the R platform for the estimation of the general - ized linear mixed models through the functions “ glm ” from the “ stats ” library and “ glmer ” from the “ lme4 ” library . Results from KW test were presented as Figures ( Scatter plot with median and IQR , Figs . 3b , 4b , 5b and 6b ) and Canizo et al . BMC Developmental Biology ( 2019 ) 19 : 13 Page 11 of 13 GLMM results , estimated averages + / − S . E . , were reported as tables ( Tables 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . When embryo developmental rates were analysed for two groups ( two type of medium ) , a Fisher ’ s exact test was applied ( Additional file 2 : Tables S1 and S2 ) . For more than two groups a GLMM were also used for the Poisson response variable “ number of embryo per treatment ” and for the Binomial response variable “ production ratio : number of embryo per number of presumptive zygotes ” . Here , “ type of embryo culture medium ” was used as fixed effects and “ IVF number of run ” as random effects ; log link function was used for Poisson distribution . Logit was used as link function for Binomial distributions and is in - dicated in each table footnote . Differences between treat - ments were considered significant at p value < 0 . 05 and detected by DGC contrast [ 41 ] . Estimated averages + / − S . E . are reported in Tables ( see Additional file 2 : Tables S3 , S4 , S5 and S6 ) . Additional files Additional file 1 : Figure S1 . Expression of NANOG and SOX2 in day 8 bovine embryos . Figure S2 .
