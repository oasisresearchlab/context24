Dynamin maintains the structure of foot processes in glomerular podocytes by directly and indirectly interacting with actin ﬁ laments . However , molecular mechanisms underlying dynamin - mediated actin regulation are largely unknown . Here , biochemical and cell biological experiments were conducted to uncover how dynamin modulates interactions between membranes and actin in human podocytes . Actin - bundling , membrane tubulating , and GTPase activities of dynamin were examined in vitro using recombinant dynamin 2 - wild - type ( WT ) or dynamin 2 - K562E , which is a mutant found in Charcot - Marie - Tooth patients . Dynamin 2 - WT and dynamin 2 - K562E led to the formation of prominent actin bundles with constant diameters . Whereas liposomes incubated with dynamin 2 - WT resulted in tubule formation , dynamin 2 - K562E reduced tubulation . Actin ﬁ laments and liposomes stimulated dynamin 2 - WT GTPase activity by 6 - and 20 - fold , respectively . Actin - ﬁ laments , but not liposomes , stimulated dynamin 2 - K562E GTPase activity by 4 - fold . Self - assembly - dependent GTPase activity of dynamin 2 - K562E was reduced to one - third compared to that of dynamin 2 - WT . Incubation of liposomes and actin with dynamin 2 - WT led to the formation of thick actin bundles , which often bound to liposomes . The interaction between lipid membranes and actin bundles by dynamin 2 - K562E was lower than that by dynamin 2 - WT . Dynamin 2 - WT partially colocalized with stress ﬁ bers and actin bundles based on double immuno ﬂ uorescence of human podocytes . Dynamin 2 - K562E expression resulted in decreased stress ﬁ ber density and the formation of aberrant actin clusters . Dynamin 2 - K562E colocalized with α - actinin - 4 in aberrant actin clusters .

Bis - T - 23 , a dynamin self - assembly enhancer , was unable to rescue the decreased focal adhesion numbers and reduced stress ﬁ ber density induced by dynamin 2 - K562E expression . These results suggest that the low af ﬁ nity of the K562E mutant for lipid membranes , and atypical self - assembling properties , lead to actin disorganization in HPCs . Moreover , lipid - binding and self - assembly of dynamin 2 along actin ﬁ laments are required for podocyte morphology and functions . Finally , dynamin 2 - mediated interactions between actin and membranes are critical for actin bundle formation in HPCs . Keywords : dynamin , podocyte , actin , bundle , GTPase , CMT INTRODUCTION Glomerular podocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells that line the urinary side of the glomerular basement membrane . They participate in ﬁ ltration of blood plasma to form primary urine . Podocytes have a complex architecture . They consist of major primary processes that branch to form secondary and tertiary foot processes . These secondary and tertiary branches interdigitate with those of neighboring podocytes to form and maintain the glomerular slit diaphragms ( Pavenstädt et al . , 2003 ) . Foot processes of podocytes are mainly supported by the actin cytoskeleton , including actin bundles and cortical actin mesh structures ( Sever and Schiffer , 2018 ) . Proper regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for maintaining the unique morphology and the ﬁ ltering function of podocytes . Dynamins are endocytic proteins that form vesicles by ﬁ ssion of invaginated plasma membranes ( Antonny et al . , 2016 ) . Dynamins are divided into three isoforms in mammals ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . Dynamin 1 is enriched in the brain , dynamin 2 is expressed in all cells , and dynamin 3 localizes to the brain , lung , and testis ( Nakata et al . , 1993 ) . All dynamin isoforms contain an N - terminal GTPase domain , a middle domain ( MD ) , phosphoinositide - binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , GTPase effector domain ( GED ) , and C - terminal proline and arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) which interacts with variety of proteins containing the Src - homology - 3 domain ( Figure 1A ; Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . Crystallographically , the three α - helix of MD and the single α - helix in GED form four - helix bundle structure termed the “ stalk ” , which provides interface required for dimerization and self - assembly ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . In unassembled dynamin , PH domain is at “ closed ” position , at which it is folded back onto the stalk preventing oligomerization of dynamin . Upon binding of dynamin to phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) - containing membrane , the PH domain is displaced to “ open ” dynamin conformation capable of self - assembly ( Srinivasan et al . , 2016 ; Kong et al . , 2018 ) . Mutations in dynamin 2 gene cause autosomal dominantly inherited diseases , Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease ( CMT ) ( Züchner et al . , 2005 ) , and centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) ( Bitoun et al . , 2005 ) , which are characterized by degenerative changes of peripheral nerves and muscles respectively . Although both CMT mutations and CNM mutations are mostly found in the PH domain , the two group of mutations are differentially located . While CNM mutations are present in PH domain - stalk interface , CMT mutations , including K562E used in this study , are located at the opposite side of PH domain implicated in membrane binding ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Tassin et al . , 2021 ) . All dynamins function in endocytosis by participating in membrane ﬁ ssion ( Antonny et al . , 2016 ) , and recognition of phosphoinositides by dynamin ’ s PH domain , especially , electrically polarised seven - stranded β - sandwich , is crucial for this function ( Vallis et al . , 1999 ) . Dynamins are also involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton . Dynamin directly or indirectly interacts with actin ( Sever et al . , 2013 ) , and thus regulates actin dynamics in lamellipodia and dorsal membrane ruf ﬂ es ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; McNiven et al . , 2000 ) , invadopodia ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) , podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , growth cones ( Torre et al . , 1994 ; Kurklinsky et al . , 2011 ; Yamada et al . , 2013 ) , phagocytic cups ( Gold et al . , 1999 ; Otsuka et al . , 2009 ) , and ﬁ lopodia of cancer cells ( Yamada et al . , 2016a ) . It is recently shown that dynamin helix bundles 12 - 16 actin ﬁ laments , and the dynamin - enriched actin bundle was present at the fusogenic synapse ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Dynamin maintains the integrity and structure of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier by regulating actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in addition to endocytosis . Podocyte - speci ﬁ c double knockouts of dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 in mice result in severe proteinuria and renal failure , which are caused by the disruption of glomerular slit diaphragms ( Soda et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , a reduction in cellular dynamin levels by cathepsin L expression causes proteinuria in mice ( Sever et al . , 2007 ) . Dynamin has been implicated in the turnover of nephrin on the surface of podocyte foot processes via endocytosis ( Soda et al . , 2012 ) . Dynamin 1 in podocyte is involved in cellular protrusion formation by regulating microtubule organization and stabilization ( La et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , dynamin participates in the maintenance of the structure of foot processes through direct and indirect interactions with actin ﬁ laments ( Gu et al . , 2010 ) . Bis - T - 23 was originally reported as a potent dynamin inhibitor of lipid - stimulated GTPase activity ( Hill et al . , 2005 ) . Subsequently , Gu et al . found that Bis - T - 23 promotes dynamin ’ s oligomerization in vitro ( Gu et al . , 2017 ) , and increases the formation of stress ﬁ bers and focal adhesions in mouse podocyte cells ( Gu et al . , 2014 ) . Because of these effects of Bis - T - 23 on dynamin and dynamin - regulated actin - rich structures , Bis - T - 23 is shown to improve proteinuria in several animal models ( Schiffer et al . , 2015 ) . However , a mode of action for actin regulation by dynamin 2 remains to be elucidated .

Dynamin 2 - Dependent Actin Filament Bundling Our previous studies show that the dynamin 2 CMT mutant K562E decreases the formation of stress ﬁ bers and triggers the assembly of aberrant actin clusters in U2OS cells ( Yamada et al . , 2016b ) . In the present study , biochemical and cell biological experiments were used to uncover the mode of action for actin regulation by dynamin 2 by comparing the effects of dynamin 2 - WT on actin ﬁ laments to those of K562E in conditionally immortalized human podocytes ( HPCs ) . Expression of dynamin 2 - K562E resulted in decreased formation of stress ﬁ bers and the appearance of aberrant actin clusters . Bis - T - 23 was less effective on the self - assembly of dynamin 2 - K562E in vitro , it was unable to reverse the aberrant actin structures in dynamin 2 - K562E expressing cells . Furthermore , in vitro experiments revealed defects in the interaction of actin bundles formed by dynamin 2 - K562E to lipid membranes . These results suggest that the self - assembly and membrane interaction properties of dynamin 2 are FIGURE 1 | Expression of the dynamin 2 ( Dyn2 ) - K562E mutant leads to the formation of aberrant actin bundles and a decrease in stress ﬁ ber density in human podocyte cells .

Bis - T - 23 ( 2 - cyano - N - { 3 - [ 2 - cyano - 3 - ( 3 , 4 , 5 - trihydroxyphenyl ) acryloylamino ] propyl } - 3 - ( 3 , 4 , 5 trihydroxyphenyl ) acrylamide ) ( ab146050 ) was purchased from Abcam , and stored frozen as a 50 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . Cell Culture The conditionally immortalized HPC line was cultured as described previously ( Saleem et al . , 2002 ) . Brie ﬂ y , the cells were cultured on type I collagen - coated plastic dishes ( 356450 , Corning Inc . ) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 medium ( 189 - 02025 , Fuji ﬁ lm Wako Pure Chemicals Co . Ltd . ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( 26140079 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 μ g / ml streptomycin ( 15140122 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , and ITS - G ( Insulin - Transferrin - Selenium mixture ) ( 100× , 41400045 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , and maintained at 33 ° C and 5 % CO 2 . To induce differentiation , podocytes were cultured at 37 ° C in medium lacking ITS - G for 7 – 14 days . Under these conditions , the cells stopped proliferating and were positive for synaptopodin . Puri ﬁ cation of Recombinant Proteins His - tagged dynamin 2b was expressed using the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and puri ﬁ ed as described previously ( Yamada et al . , 2016a ) . The puri ﬁ ed dynamin proteins were concentrated using Centriplus YM50 ( 4310 , Merck - Millipore ) . His - tagged rat dynamin 2 - WT or dynamin 2 - K562E was expressed using a wheat germ cell - free expression system ( CellFree Sciences ) . Dynamin 2 - WT or dynamin 2 - K562E was resolved in 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , 500 mM imidazole , pH8 . 0 , and stored at 4 ° C until use . We used dynamin 2 - WT and K562E produced by a wheat germ cell free expression system except Supplementary Figures S2E , F , and baculovirus protein expression system was used for Supplementary Figures S2E , F . Liposome Preparation Liposomes were prepared as previously described ( Takeda et al . , 2018 ) . 10 % ( mol / mol ) PIP 2 ( Cat . No 524644 , Calbiochem ) , 80 % phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ; 840022C , Avanti Polar Lipids ) , 10 % cholesterol ( 700000 , Avanti Polar Lipids ) were mixed in chloroform . Then chloroform was evaporated using slow - ﬂ ow nitrogen gas to produce lipid ﬁ lm on the glass and then completely dried under vacuum for at least 1 day . The dried lipid was rehydrated by water - saturated nitrogen gas followed by addition of 500 μ l of ﬁ ltered 100 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 for 2 h at 37 ° C . The resultant membrane vesicles were passed through 0 . 4 μ m - or 1 μ m - polycarbonate ﬁ lters respectively 11 times using Avanti Mini extruder . To visualize liposomes under ﬂ uorescent microscope , 1 % Rhodamine - labeled PE was added to liposomes . Complementary DNA Constructs and Transfection Rat dynamin 2 - WT , 555 Δ 3 , and K562E cloned into pcDNA4 V5 / His are described in Yamada et al . ( 2016b ) . Rat dynamin 2 - WT was subcloned into pIRES2 - DsRed2 as an EcoRI - SmaI fragment ( Clontech Laboratories ) . Mutations were introduced with QuikChange II XL ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions , and mutation accuracy was veri ﬁ ed by DNA sequencing . Vectors containing dynamin 2 - WT and the site - directed mutants were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine LTX reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . After transfection for 2 days , the cells were processed by double immuno ﬂ uorescence . Fluorescence Microscopy HPCs were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and processed for immuno ﬂ uorescence as described previously ( Yamada et al . , 2016a ) . For cytochalasin D washout experiments , HPCs were incubated in 5 μ M cytochalasin D at 37 ° C for 30 min . Cytochalasin D - containing medium was then replaced with fresh cytochalasin D - free medium . Cells were further incubated for 60 min after cytochalasin D washout , and then ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ; 145 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate buffer , pH7 . 4 ) . For Bis - T - 23 treatment , HPCs were incubated in 50 μ M Bis - T - 23 at 37 ° C for 30 min , and then ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . After ﬁ xation , cells were subjected to double - immuno ﬂ uorescence . Samples were examined with a spinning - disc confocal microscope system ( X - Light Confocal Imager ; CREST OPTICS S . P . A . , Rome , Italy ) , which consisted of an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 ; Olympus Optical Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) and an iXon + camera ( Oxford Instruments , Oxfordshire , United Kingdom ) . The confocal system was controlled by the MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , United States ) . When necessary , images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 or Illustrator CS3 software . The N - SIM system ( NIKON Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) was used for super - resolution microscopy . Determination of Phosphate Concentration Dynamin 2 - WT or K562E ( 1 . 5 μ M ) was incubated with actin ﬁ laments ( 1 μ M ) in buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 62 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) at 4 ° C for 16 h . The dynamin 2 - actin ﬁ lament mixture ( 160 μ l ) was then incubated in the presence of 1 mM GTP at 37 ° C for 15 min . GTP hydrolysis was measured using a colorimetric assay to detect inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) release as previously described ( Leonard et al . , 2005 ) .

Dynamin 2 - Dependent Actin Filament Bundling Quanti ﬁ cation of Actin Bundles by a Low - Speed Sedimentation Assay Non - muscle actin ( APHL99 , Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was polymerized in F - buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM ATP ) for 1 h . Dynamin 2 - WT or K562E ( 1 μ M ) was then incubated with actin ﬁ laments ( 3 μ M ) in F - buffer for 1 h . Actin bundles were sedimented by low - speed centrifugation at 14 , 000 × g for 1 h . The pellet and supernatant were separated by SDS - PAGE , stained with SYPRO Orange ( S6650 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , and quanti ﬁ ed by densitometry using Image J . All steps were carried out at room temperature . Transmission Electron Microscopy Negative staining was performed according to Yamada et al . ( Yamada et al . , 2013 ) . The dynamin 2 - WT - or K562E - induced actin - bundling assays were conducted by incubating 1 . 5 μ M of the dynamins with 1 μ M actin ﬁ laments in F - buffer containing 50 mM or 100 mM KCl at 4 ° C for 16 h . The samples were absorbed onto a Formvar - and carbon - coated copper grid . To observe the effect of GTP hydrolysis on actin bundle morphology , GTP or GMP - PNP at the indicated concentrations were added onto the grid and incubated for 1 min or 5 min , respectively . The grids were then stained with 3 % uranyl acetate in double deionized H 2 O for 2 min . Grids were imaged with a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) ( H - 7650 , Hitachi High - Tech Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) at a voltage of 120 kV . Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) The laboratory - built AFM observation was performed as follows ( Takeda et al . , 2018 ) . First , after incubation with a mixture of dynamin 2 - WT / K562E and actin ﬁ lament in F - buffer containing 50 mM KCl , a glass stage with a diameter of 2 mm was immersed in the solution , and the complex is ﬁ xed to the glass substrate by centrifugation ( 6 , 000 × g for 20 min ) . After that , the samples were washed by the F - buffer and ﬁ xed with the F - buffer with 0 . 01 % glutaraldehyde solution . Then AFM images were obtained in the F - buffer at room temperature . Morphometry Cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin , and analyzed by ﬂ uorescent confocal microscopy to determine stress ﬁ ber density . The number of stress ﬁ bers in three randomly selected areas ( 10 μ m × 10 μ m ) per cell was counted . Data were analyzed from three independent experiments . The extent of colocalization of dynamin 2 - WT or K562E with F - actin or α - actinin - 4 was assessed by imaging immunostained cells , and measuring the immunoreactivities in three randomlyselectedareas ( 5×5 μ m ) percell . Toquantifyfocaladhesions , cells immunostained with dynamin 2 - WT or K562E , and paxillin , were imaged . The number of clear dots per cell was counted . we performed morphological analysis again . For quanti ﬁ cation of liposomes bound to actin ﬁ laments , images of the mixture , including dynamin 2 - WT or K562E , and F - actin with rhodamine - labelled liposomes , were taken with a confocal microscope at a 1000× magni ﬁ cation . The corresponding pixels to liposomes colocalizing at F - actin were extracted using Metamorph software from double - ﬂ uorescent overlay image ( 1024 × 1024 pixel ) of liposome ( red ) and actin ﬁ lament ( green ) and then calculated the total amount of colocalizing liposomes with F - actin . We normalized the total amount of colocalizing liposomes with F - actin by the same amount of F - actin in each condition . We quanti ﬁ ed the pitch in dynamin - induced actin bundles by visually scanning negatively - stained samples at the electron microscope according to Takei et al . ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) . Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed for statistical signi ﬁ cance using KaleidaGraph software for Macintosh , version 4 . 1 ( Synergy Software Inc . , Essex Junction , VT , United States ) . Student ’ s t - tests were used to analyze statistical signi ﬁ cance between two groups . An analysis of variance and Tukey ’ s honest signi ﬁ cant difference post - hoc test were used to compare several groups . All data are displayed as means ± standard error of the means ( S . E . M . ) with p < 0 . 05 considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . RESULTS Expression of Dynamin 2 - K562E Results in Aberrant Actin Stress Fibers and Actin Clusters in Human Podocyte Cells Our previous studies show that dynamin 2 - K562E , a point mutation in dynamin 2 PH domain , induces aberrant actin ﬁ lament structures in U2OS cells ( Yamada et al . , 2016b ) . To investigate the mode of action fordynamin 2mutation - triggeredchangesinactin morphology in HPCs , we ﬁ rst examined actin ﬁ lament distribution in dynamin 2 - WT - or K562E - expressing cells by double - immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Dynamin 2 - WT and K562E were compared to dynamin 2 - 555 Δ 3 , which is a deletion mutant that affects microtubule organization ( Figures 1A , Bc ; Tanabe and Takei 2009 ) . DsRed2 was co - expressed with the dynamin 2 - WT and mutant constructs to identify cells expressing the exogenous proteins . Control HPCs , untransfected , formed the typical parallel arrangement of stress ﬁ bers and actin bundles ( Figure 1Ba ) . The organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells expressing dynamin 2 - WT was similar to that of control cells ( Figure 1Bb ) . Furthermore , actin ﬁ lament distribution in 555 Δ 3 - expressing cells was similar to that of control or dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells ( Figures 1Bc , C ) . By contrast , stress ﬁ ber density was approximately 50 % lower in K562E - expressing cells than that of control or dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells ( Figures 1Bd , C ) . Dynamin 2 - WT was observed as ﬁ ne dots distributed throughout the cell when imaged by super - resolution microscopy . The dot - like dynamin 2 - WT structures partially colocalized with stress ﬁ bers and actin bundles ( Figures 1D upper panels , E ) . By contrast , K562E - expressing cells showed numerous actin ﬁ lament clusters , and aberrant stress ﬁ bers accumulating with K562E - dynamin 2 ( Figures 1D bottom panels , E ) . The results indicate that K562E - dynamin 2 causes distinct effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in HPCs . Dynamin 2 is Involved in Stress Fiber Formation in Human Podocytes Given the appearance of aberrant stress ﬁ bers and actin clusters in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing HPCs , we next asked whether the dynamin mutant affects stress ﬁ ber formation .

Dynamin 2 - Dependent Actin Filament Bundling including stress ﬁ bers , are disrupted by the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D ( Brenner and Korn , 1979 ) . Reformation of stress ﬁ bers after removing cytochalasin D from the medium was examined . As shown in Figure 2A , cytochalasin D treatment for 30 min resulted in the disruption of stress ﬁ bers and actin bundles in dynamin 2 - WT - and dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing HPCs . Dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells reformed clear stress ﬁ bers 1 hour after removal of cytochalasin D . On the other hand , stress ﬁ ber reformation was lower in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing cells than that in dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , dynamin 2 is required in the early stages of stress ﬁ ber reformation . The dynamin polymerization enhancer , Bis - T - 23 , promotes the formation of stress ﬁ bers and focal adhesions in mouse podocyte cells ( Schiffer et al . , 2015 ; Gu et al . , 2017 ) . Here , Bis - T - 23 enhanced stress ﬁ ber formation in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing and dynamin 2 - WT - expressing HPCs ( Figures 3A , B ) . However , Bis - T - 23 - induced stress ﬁ ber formation in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing HPCs was lower than that in dynamin 2 - WT - expressing HPCs . Bis - T - 23 had the same effect on focal adhesion formation in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing and dynamin 2 - WT - expressing HPCs ( Figures 3C , D ) . The Dynamin 2 Ring - Like Structure Directly Bundles Actin Filaments To determine if dynamin 2 directly affects actin ﬁ laments , we examined in vitro the GTPase activities and membrane deformation activities of recombinant dynamin 2 - WT and dynamin 2 - K562E . Puri ﬁ ed dynamin 2 - WT showed high GTPase activity under low ionic strength buffer ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) or in the presence of lipid membranes ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . These ﬁ ndings were consistent with previous reports ( Warnock et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 2005 ) . By contrast , GTPase activity of dynamin 2 - K562E was approximately one - third that of dynamin 2 - WT under low ionic strength buffer ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . Furthermore , liposome - stimulated increase of GTPase activity was not observed in dynamin 2 - K562E ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . For membrane deformation activity assays , liposomes containing PIP 2 were incubated with dynamin 2 - WT or dynamin 2 - K562E , and examined by TEM . Dynamin 2 - WT formed typical membrane tubules decorated with dynamin spiral polymers as reported previously ( Chin et al . , 2015 ; Supplementary Figure S2C ) . On the other hand , dynamin 2 - K562E hardly tubulated the liposomes , although it slightly deformed spherical liposomes ( Supplementary Figure S2C ) . In absence of liposomes , both dynamin 2 - WT , dynamin 2 - K562E formed ring - shaped polymers under GDP - Pi conditions ( Supplementary Figure S2D ; Carr and Hinshaw , 1997 ) , which suggested that the ability of dynamin 2 to self - assemble into rings is retained in dynamin 2 - K562E . We next examined the direct effects of Bis - T - 23 on dynamin polymerization . In the presence of Bis - T - 23 , polymerization of recombinant dynamin 2 - WT increased by thirty times in comparison to that without Bis - T - 23 . On the other hand , polymerization of dynamin 2 - K562E slightly increased by three and half times ( Supplementary Figures S2E , F ) . These results suggested that self - assembly and membrane tubulating activity of dynamin 2 - K562E was defective , and the differential effects of Bis - T - 23 in cellulo on dynamin 2 - WT and dynamin 2 - K562E ( Figure 3 ) could be attributed to changes in the molecular characteristics of dynamin 2 - K562E . Given that dynamin directly bundles actin ﬁ laments ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) , we assessed whether dynamin 2 - WT or K562E bundles actin FIGURE 2 | Stress ﬁ ber formation decreases in dynamin 2 ( Dyn2 ) - K562E - expressing HPCs .

Preformed actin ﬁ laments were incubated in vitro with or without recombinant dynamin 2 - WT or K562E , and actin bundle formation was examined by low - speed sedimentation assays . In the absence of dynamin 2 proteins , actin in the pellet after centrifugation at 14 , 000 x g was around 20 % of total actin ( Figure 4A ) . In the presence of dynamin 2 - WT or dynamin 2 - K562E , actin in the pellets increased by 30 – 40 % ( Figure 4A ) . These results suggested that dynamin 2 - WT and K562E bundle actin ﬁ laments to similar extents . TEM revealed that actin ﬁ laments were often tightly bundled by dynamin 2 - WT or K562E ( Figure 4B ) . The diameter of actin ﬁ lament bundles in the presence of dynamin 2 - WT and dynamin 2 - K562E was 41 . 0 ± 0 . 6 nm ( n = 24 ) and 41 . 4 ± 0 . 5 nm ( n = 21 ) , respectively . Periodically arranged dynamins were often observed both in dynamin 2 - WT - and dynamin 2 - K562E - induced actin bundles ( Figure 4B inset ) . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was used to investigate dynamin and actin ﬁ lament con ﬁ gurations . AFM revealed that dynamin 2 - WT ring - like structures formed spirals , and actin ﬁ laments directly bound to the outer rim of the dynamin spirals ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Dynamin 2 - K562E bundled actin ﬁ laments in the same manner as that of dynamin 2 - WT ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Next , the effect of actin bundles on dynamin GTPase activity was determined . High ion strength buffer conditions containing 100 mM KCl were used to detect actin bundling - dependent GTPase activity because low ionic strength buffer containing 50 mM KCl causes a dynamin 2 self - assembly - dependent increase in GTPase activity ( Warnock et al . , 1997 ) . Low magni ﬁ cation TEM images showed that dynamin 2 - WT bundled actin ﬁ laments in the high ion strength buffer . By contrast , actin bundle formation by dynamin 2 - K562E was lower than that of dynamin 2 - WT ( Figure 4C ) . Under the same conditions , concentration of released free phosphate by dynamin 2 - WT or dynamin 2 - K562E increased 6 - fold or 4 - fold , respectively , relative to that without actin proteins ( Figure 4D ) . We next examined morphological changes of actin bundles upon GTP hydrolysis of dynamins . The addition of GTP caused the rapid depolymerization of dynamin spiral polymers , and the resulting dispersion of actin bundles ( Figure 4E middle panels ) consistent with recent report ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . This morphological change is likely to be largely dependent on GTP hydrolysis , although the reaction mixture also contains ATP for the purpose of stabilizing actin ﬁ laments . It is known that dynamin has much higher af ﬁ nity to GTP compared to that to ATP ( Maeda et al . , 1992 ) . Consistently , in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue , GMP - PNP , did not result in disassembly of dynamin spiral polymers on the actin bundles ( Figure 4E bottom panels ) . The clearance among adjacent dynamin 2 - WT polymers in the actin bundles changed from 14 . 2 ± 0 . 2 nm ( - GTP , n = 24 ) to 12 . 9 ± 0 . 3 nm ( + GMP - PNP , n = 27 ) . On the other hand , clearance among adjacent dynamin 2 - K562E polymer in the actin bundles changed from 13 . 9 ± 0 . 3 nm FIGURE 3 | Stress ﬁ bers and focal adhesions increase in Bis - T - 23 - treated HPCs .

Dynamin 2 - Dependent Actin Filament Bundling ( - GTP , n = 21 ) to 16 . 9 ± 0 . 5 nm ( + GMP - PNP , n = 35 ) ( Figures 4E bottom panels , F ) . Dynamin 2 Crosslinks Actin Bundles and Membranes , and Dynamin 2 - K562E Reduces the Association Between Membranes and Actin Bundles Dynamin binds to membrane phospho - lipids , such as PIP 2 via its PH domain , and this association is essential for membrane deformation ( Antonny et al . , 2016 ) . We therefore asked whether dynamin 2 - induced actin bundles could bind to lipid membranes . Actin ﬁ laments did not form bundles or associate with lipid vesicles in the absence of dynamins ( Figure 5A ) . In the presence of dynamin 2 - WT , almost all actin ﬁ laments incorporated into thick actin bundles that colocalized with liposomes ( Figure 5A ) . On the other hand , fewer actin bundles formed in the presence of dynamin 2 - K562E than that in dynamin 2 - WT ( Figure 5A ) . Liposomes colocalizing with actin ﬁ laments or bundles in the presence of dynamin 2 - K562E was approximately 30 % of that in the presence of dynamin 2 - WT ( Figure 5B ) . These results indicate that dynamin 2 has actin - bundling and lipid - binding properties , and that dynamin 2 - K562E has lower lipid - binding activity during actin bundling than that of dynamin 2 - WT . DISCUSSION Two dynamin isoforms , dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 , are expressed in podocytes ( Soda et al . , 2012 ) . Dynamin 2 in podocytes play a role in maintaining the glomerular slit diaphragms by directly regulating actin ( Gu et al . , 2010 ; Schiffer et al . , 2015 ) or by modulating endocytosis ( Soda et al . , 2012 ) . However , the mode of action of actin regulation by dynamin 2 in podocytes remains unsolved . We have investigated the actin regulation by using variety of dynamin 2 CMT mutants to clarify CMT pathogenesis . Among the mutants , we found that expression of K562E , a member of CMT mutant in dynamin 2 , resulted in the decrease of stress ﬁ bers and formation of actin clusters ( Yamada et al . , 2016b ) . We also examined two kinds of CMT mutants , G358R and 555 Δ 3 . These CMT mutations did not affect the actin cytoskeleton ( Yamada et al . , 2016b ) . In the present study , we used the K562E mutants to clarify the function of dynamin 2 on actin cytoskeleton by the comparison of dynamin 2 - WT and K562E in conditionally immortalized HPCs . Because the CMT mutations in dynamin 2 cause autosomal dominantly inherited FIGURE 5 | Decreased interaction of actin bundles formed by dynamin 2 - K562E with PIP 2 - containing lipid vesicles . ( A ) Actin ﬁ laments ( F - Actin ) and lipid vesicles were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin ( green ) and Rhodamine - phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) ( red ) , respectively . Preformed actin bundles by dynamin 2 - WT ( middle panels ) or dynamin 2 - K562E ( bottom panels ) were mixed with rhodamine - labeled lipid vesicles . Note that thick actin bundles formed by dynamin 2 - WT associated with several lipid membranes . In the presence of dynamin 2 - K562E , actin bundles were thinner and bound to few lipid vesicles .

Dynamin 2 - Dependent Actin Filament Bundling diseases ( Züchner et al . , 2005 ) , the expression of exogenous CMT mutant in cells would represent the pathological phenotype even though the presence of endogenous WT dynamin . In the study , we exogenously expressed dynamin CMT mutant in the presence of endogenous dynamin 2 to access the effect of actin ﬁ laments . Dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing HPCs had lower stress ﬁ bers and actin ﬁ laments than those of dynamin 2 - WT - expressing HPCs ( Figures 1 , 2 ) . In addition , dynamin 2 - K562E colocalized with aberrant actin clusters and bundles in areas , in which α - actinin - 4 was located ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Stress ﬁ ber reformation was lower in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing HPCs than that in dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells ( Figure 2 ) . These results suggest that dynamin 2 is involved in stress ﬁ ber formation in HPCs . Bis - T - 23 , a dynamin polymerization enhancer ( Schiffer et al . , 2015 ) , stimulated the formation of stress ﬁ bers and focal adhesions in dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells ( Figure 3 ) . On the other hand , Bis - T - 23 had less effects on stress ﬁ ber formation and focal adhesion in dynamin 2 - K562E - expressing cells than that in dynamin 2 - WT - expressing cells ( Figure 3 ) . Moreover , Bis - T - 23 was unable to stimulate dynamin 2 - K562E polymerization in vitro ( Supplementary Figure S2E ) . In vitro studies revealed lower dynamin 2 - K562E self - assembly and membrane tubulation with decreased GTPase activity than that in dynamin 2 - WT ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . WT and mutant dynamins formed ring - like structures and / or spirals in the presence of actin ﬁ laments ( Figure 4 ) , and bound to actin ﬁ laments outside of the dynamin rings ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Crosslinking between membranes and actin bundles triggered by dynamin 2 - K562E were lower than those of dynamin 2 - WT ( Figure 5 ) . These results indicate that proper self - assembly and association of dynamin 2 to membranes are crucial for actin regulation in HPCs . Dynamin K562E has its mutation site in the PH domain at the interface of polymerized dynamin and membranes , and the mutant is defective in lipid - binding ( Kenniston and Lemmon , 2010 ) . In this study , dynamin 2 - K562E hardly generated membrane tubules from liposomes , and therefore the mutant rarely polymerized into regularly arranged spirals on lipid membrane ( Supplementary Figure S2C ) . The dynamin 2 - K562E mutation in PH domain largely reduced membrane - binding ability , but not affected its actin binding capability ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , the defective lipid - induced oligomerization of dynamin 2 - K562E mutant might impact the proper formation of actin stress ﬁ bers in HPCs . Dynamin might have several putative actin binding sites . Gu and others determined several crucial amino acid residues for actin binding in the dynamin middle domain and upstream of the PH domain ( Gu et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , the proline - rich domain is essential for actin bundling ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . From the study , the K562E mutation seems to rarely affect its actin binding and bundling ability . AFM revealed that several actin ﬁ laments bound to the outer rim of dynamin rings or spirals . Furthermore , actin ﬁ laments were not observed inside the dynamin spirals ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . There are reports that the dynamin ring bundles actin ﬁ laments indirectly and directly ( Yamada et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Dynamin 1 binds to cortactin , which is an actin ﬁ lament binding protein ( Wu and Parsons 1993 ) , and forms a ring - shaped or spiral complex ( Yamada et al . , 2013 ) . The dynamin - cortactin ring bundles actin ﬁ laments inside of the ring . The three - dimensional structure of the dynamin - actin ﬁ lament complex needs to be determined at higher resolution such as by cryo - electron tomography reconstruction to better understand the nature of actin binding to dynamin . Differentiated podocytes have a complex architecture with a multitude of foot processes that interdigitate with those of neighbouring podocytes to form and maintain the glomerular slit diaphragms ( Pavenstädt et al . , 2003 ) . Actin serves as the main cytoskeletal structure in foot processes ( Perico et al . , 2016 ) . Podocyte - speci ﬁ c conditional double knockouts of dynamins 1 and 2 in mice result in severe proteinuria and renal failure because of disruptions to the glomerular slit diaphragms ( Soda et al . , 2012 ) . Dynamin 2 is thought to not only strengthen the actin cytoskeleton through its actin - bundling ability , but also promotes the formation of stress ﬁ bers and focal adhesions to maintain podocyte morphology and ﬁ ltration functions . The present study shows that the self - assembly , and the membrane binding are essential characteristics of dynamin for the formation of stress ﬁ bers and actin bundles in HPCs . Dynamin 2 binds to several actin - related proteins , and indirectly or directly regulates actin . Our previous studies report that another dynamin isoform , dynamin 1 , is crucial for proper distribution and stability of microtubules in podocytes ( La et al . , 2020 ) . Dynamin 2 - dependent regulatory functions of stress ﬁ bers and focal adhesions in coordination with dynamin 1 - dependent distribution and stabilization of microtubules , could be essential for normal podocyte function .
