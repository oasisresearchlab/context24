While the machinery is complex in modern day eukaryotes , where 39 it comprises dozens of proteins , the system has simpler and more ancient origins . Indeed , homologues 40 of ESCRT - III and the Vps4 ATPase , the proteins that execute the final membrane scission reaction , 41 play analogous roles in cytokinesis and potentially in extracellular vesicle formation in TACK archaea 42 where ESCRT - I and II homologues seem to be absent . Here , we explore the phylogeny , structure , and 43 biochemistry of homologues of the ESCRT machinery and the associated ubiquitylation system found 44 in genome assemblies of the recently discovered Asgard archaea . In these closest living prokaryotic 45 relatives of eukaryotes , we provide evidence for the ESCRT - I and II sub - complexes being involved in 46 the ubiquitin - directed recruitment of ESCRT - III , as it is in eukaryotes . This analysis suggests a pre - 47 eukaryotic origin for the Ub - coupled ESCRT system and a likely path of ESCRT evolution via a series 48 of gene duplication and diversification events . 49 50 INTRODUCTION 51 52 The ESCRT ( Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ) machinery is composed of several 53 protein complexes and associated accessory proteins , including the ESCRT - 0 , - I , - II , - III subcomplexes , 54 Vps4 , and ALIX / Bro1 1 - 18 ( Figure S1 ) . These proteins act in sequence to bind , deform and cut 55 membranes during membrane trafficking 2 - 5 , cell division 19 , 20 , viral egress 21 , 22 and in other important 56 topologically similar membrane remodelling events in eukaryotes 23 - 39 . When driving the formation of 57 multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , where the role of ESCRT in trafficking has been best characterised , the 58 ESCRT machinery is recruited to endosomal membranes by ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins that 59 are targeted to vesicles 40 . The ubiquitin ( Ub ) moiety is recognised by ESCRT - 0 and - I subcomplexes , 60 which bind the ubiquitin b - grasp fold 9 , 14 , 41 , 42 . ESCRT - I proteins together with the ESCRT - II sub - complex 61 then corral these ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins into membrane domains 9 , 11 . Finally , the 62 ESCRT - II sub - complex nucleates the local formation of ESCRT - III co - polymers which , through action 63 of the Vps4 ATPase , undergo structural changes to drive membrane invagination and scission to release 64 vesicles containing the Ub - marked transmembrane proteins 43 - 53 . 65 66 ESCRT - I , - II , - III components are found conserved across the eukaryotic lineages , pointing to this 67 machinery being present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( LECA ; Note ESCRT - 0 is only 68 encountered in Opisthokonta ) 54 . Homologues of ESCRT - III and Vps4 are coded by the genomes of 69 many archaeal species 55 - 60 , and shown to function in archaeal membrane remodelling during cytokinesis 70 and virus release . More recently , PspA and Vipp1 have been recognized as bacterial ESCRT - III related 71 proteins 61 - 63 . These observations suggest that a subset of ESCRT components have more ancient 72 evolutionary origins . Furthermore , the identification of a full complement of ubiquitin and its activating 73 enzymes ( E1 , E2 , and E3 ) in some archaeal species has provided evidence for ubiquitylation cascades 74 functioning in protein degradation in the archaeal ancestors of eukaryotes 58 , 64 , 65 . 75 76 This begs the question : when in evolution did ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II machineries arise , and when was 77 ubiquitylation co - opted to regulate ESCRT ? Metagenome assemblies of the recently discovered Asgard 78 archaea , the closest living relatives of eukaryotes , have revealed that homologues of the entire 79 ubiquitylation cascade , ESCRT - III ( and Vps4 ) , and components of the ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II 80 subcomplexes are all encoded by the genomes of these archaea 57 , 58 . However , validating this 81 conclusion in cells is currently very difficult , as only one Asgard member has been isolated and 82 cultured 66 ; and its growth rate , physiology and the lack of essential tools prevent its use as a cell 83 biological model . 84 85 To circumvent these challenges , here we apply a diverse set of experimental approaches to characterise 86 Asgard archaeal homologues of the eukaryotic Ub - ESCRT system , focusing on the ESCRT - I and 87 ESCRT - II subcomplexes . Our analysis shows that , like its eukaryotic counterparts , the Asgard ESCRT - 88 I subcomplex stably recognises ubiquitin . Furthermore , by carrying out a comprehensive two - hybrid 89 analysis , we have been able to identify protein - protein interactions within and between the different 90 ESCRT subcomplexes . Additionally , our data show that Asgard ESCRT subcomplexes have likely 91 arisen through a process of gene duplication and diversification , prior to the evolution of more complex 92 eukaryotic ESCRT assemblies . Taken together , this work reveals the presence of a genetically 93 streamlined ubiquitin - associated multi - component ESCRT pathway that predates the emergence of the 94 eukaryotic ESCRT machinery . 95 96 RESULTS 97 98 Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Asgard archaeal genomes encode homologues of most , but 99 not all components of the Ub - ESCRT machinery 100 101 Many of the recently discovered Asgard archaeal genomes encode a wide array of so - called ‘eukaryotic 102 signature proteins’ ( ESPs ) and appear unique amongst prokaryotes in possessing close homologues of 103 most of the proteins that make up the ESCRT - I and - II complexes , together with ESCRT - III and Vps4 104 and homologues of ubiquitin and the associated ubiquitin - modification enzymes 57 , 58 . While these data 105 suggest the possibility of some Asgard archaea possessing functional Ub - ESCRT membrane trafficking 106 machinery , it is noticeable that Asgard genomes appear to lack a number of genes encoding proteins 107 essential for ESCRT function in eukaryotes ( Figure 1A ) . Thus , to put this hypothesis to the test , we 108 began by generating a catalogue of proteins with homology to the components of the eukaryotic Ub - 109 ESCRT pathway in distinct Asgard phyla shown in Figure 1A and Figure S2 and Figure S3 . 110 111 We focused on Asgard archaea that have metagenomic assemblies that are near complete based on 112 them being assigned to small numbers of contigs and on estimates of genome coverage 57 , 58 . Within 113 such genomes , as previously described 57 , 58 , we were able to identify genes coding for close homologues 114 of ubiquitin , ubiquitin modifying enzymes , ESCRT - I components , ESCRT - II subunits , together with 115 homologues of ESCRT - III and Vps4 ( Figure 1A and Figure S3 ) 58 , 67 . These analyses strongly suggest 116 that many Asgard archaea possess a bona fide eukaryote - like ESCRT - system . 117 118 Since gene clustering in prokaryotes frequently brings together genes with common functions , we 119 sought to determine the extent to which ubiquitylation and ESCRT related genes are found co - located 120 within specific regions of Asgard genomes ( Figure 1B and C ) . As previously described 58 within a single 121 Odinarchaeota genome the full set of putative gene - products with homology to Ub - ESCRT were found 122 together within a single gene cluster ( Figure 1C ) . We extended this analysis by developing a simple 123 metric of gene clustering , which was applied to Heimdall - , Loki - , Thor , and the recently described Hel - 124 archaeotal genomes , all which harbour ESCRT genes 57 , 58 , 67 . This was achieved by measuring the 125 fraction of genomes within each phylum in which each pair of genes co - localises within less than 10 kb 126 ( Figure 1B ; white indicates no evidence of co - location and deep purple indicates full co - location ) 68 . This 127 analysis revealed cases where the entire set of genes was clustered together in genomes Hel and 128 Heimdall archaea genomes , and was found organised into two relatively discrete Ub and ESCRT 129 genomic regions in Lokiarchaeota ( Figure 1B ) . In addition , we observed a consistent pattern of 130 association across genomes in which the genes for ESCRT - III and Vps4 were found most tightly 131 associated with homologues of Vps25 ( Figure 1B - C , S3 ) . This is striking as Vps25 is the subunit of the 132 ESCRT - II complex in eukaryotes that recruits ESCRT - III to membranes , triggering vesicle budding 1 - 18 . 133 Vps22 / Vps36 homologues ( ESCRT - II components ) were found to have a similar but slightly less 134 consistent pattern of co - location with ESCRT - III and Vps4 , and the gene was usually closely associated 135 with Vps25 ( Figure 1B - C , S3 ) . 136 137 During this analysis , we also noted that , whereas eukaryotic Vps22 and Vps25 function as part of a 138 single hetero - tetrameric complex together with a divergent Vps22 homologue , Vps36 , Asgard archaeal 139 genomes possessed a single gene encoding a Vps22 / Vps36 - like protein ( Figure 1A and C ) . A 140 phylogenetic analysis was used to confirm that the Asgard Vps22 - like protein is a closer homologue of 141 Vps22 than it is of Vps36 ( Figure 1D , Figure S4 ) . This suggests that the eukaryotic - specific protein , 142 Vps36 , arose from a Vps22 / Vps36 homolog after the divergence of Vps22 and Vps25 in Asgard 143 archaea . 144 145 Asgard genomes also code for clear homologues of the eukaryotic ESCRT - I machinery , including 146 homologues of Vps23 ( which contain a Ubiquitin E2 - Variant or “UEV” domain ) and Vps28 , both 147 containing steadiness box ( SB ) domains . Interestingly , these genes were not tightly clustered in Asgard 148 genomes ( Figure 1B - C , Figure S5 ) . Furthermore , the organisation of this set of genes was variable 149 across lineages ; including genomes in which individual domains were brought together to form fusion 150 proteins ( Figure 1B - C , Figure S5 - 8 ) . In addition , Asgard archaea were found to lack a clear homologue 151 of the eukaryotic Vps37 . This ESCRT - I subunit is a homologue of Vps23 ( reference 68 and Figure S5 - 152 8 ) , implying that Vps37 may have arisen later in evolution in the branch leading to eukaryotes . In 153 summary , with the notable exception of the Thorarchaeota , which seemingly lack true ubiquitin 154 homologues ( Figure 1A - C and Figure S5 ) , most Asgard genomes have the potential to encode proteins 155 that together resembles large parts of the conserved eukaryotic Ub - ESCRT system . 156 157 Asgard archaeal ESCRT - I subcomplexes bind ubiquitin 158 159 In eukaryotes , a variant of the ubiquitin E2 ( UEV ) domain plays a key role in Ub recognition by ESCRT - 160 I 69 . The UEV domain is similar in structure to the E2 region of the ubiquitin conjugating E2 enzymes , but 161 lacks the key catalytic cysteine . We identified a number of similar proteins in Asgard archaea . The 162 Heimdallarchaeota AB125 genome codes for four E2 - like candidates : HeimAB125 _ 07740 , 163 HeimAB125 _ 09840 , HeimAB125 _ 11700 and HeimAB125 _ 14070 ( Figure S7A - B ) . Structural models of 164 these Heimdall proteins were generated using I - TASSER 70 - 72 ( Figure S7A ) and structural 165 superimposition used to confirm that , while two of the Heimdall proteins ( HeimAB125 _ 07740 and 166 HeimAB125 _ 09840 ) possess putative catalytic Cys residues ( characteristic of bona fide E2 ubiquitin - 167 conjugating proteins ) , two ( HeimAB125 _ 11700 and HeimAB125 _ 14070 ) did not contain cysteine 168 residues at the expected catalytic positions ( can we HIGHLIGHT this cysteine in Figure S6 ? – its hard 169 to find ! ) , raising the possibility that these may have UEV domains and function as ubiquitin - binding 170 proteins ( Figure S7A and B ) . One of these UEV domain - containing proteins represents a fusion of a 171 Vps28 domain to UEV - Vps23 ( containing ESCRT - I signatures : antiparallel coiled - coil stalk region and 172 a steadiness box ) . This organisation raises the possibility that this Heimdallarchaeota protein harbours 173 both Vps23 - like ubiquitin - binding activity ( via the UEV - domain ) and Vps28 - like functions , which are 174 central to ESCRT - II subcomplex recruitment ( Figure 2A - C and Figure S7 and S8 ) . A phylogenetic 175 analysis was used to confirm that both Asgard and eukaryotic UEV - like proteins cluster with eukaryotic 176 Vps23 homologues and away from bona fide Ubiquitin E2 enzymes – suggesting a divergence in the 177 structure and function of UEV and E2 domains that predates the Last Asgard and Eukaryotic Common 178 Ancestor ( LAsECA ) ( Figure 1E ) . Other Asgard species , most notably Odinarchaeota archaeon LCB _ 4 , 179 possess separable and distinct Vps23 - like ( containing the UEV domain ) and Vps28 proteins , as seen in 180 eukaryotes ( Figure S8 ) . Both these Odin proteins possess steadiness boxes , which in eukaryotes are 181 critical for the assembly of the ESCRT - I subcomplexes 9 , 73 , 74 . 182 183 184 To test for physical interactions between these putative ESCRT - I proteins , we recombinantly expressed 185 in E . coli and purified Heimdallarchaeota and Odinarchaeota ubiquitin together with their corresponding 186 putative UEV - containing proteins and performed in vitro binding experiments . In the case of the 187 Heimdallarchaeota proteins , the interaction between the purified full - length UEV - Vps23 - Vps28 fusion 188 protein and ubiquitin was analysed by chemical cross - linking followed by SDS - PAGE ( Figure 2D ) . This 189 revealed an increase in the apparent molecular weight of the protein upon ubiquitin binding and cross - 190 linking ( Figure 2D , top panel ) . In addition , we observed a ubiquitin - dependent increase in molecular 191 weight for the isolated Heimdall UEV ( Figure 2A , green ) , indicative of direct ubiquitin binding by this 192 domain , rather than a different part of the full - length Vps23 - Vps28 protein ( Figure 2D , bottom panel ) . In 193 eukaryotes , binding is mediated by an Ile - residue at position 44 ( I44 ) of Ubiquitin , which is part of a 194 hydrophobic patch 13 . A model of Heimdall ubiquitin was superimposed on an available crystal structure 195 of ubiquitin in a complex with UEV ( Figure 2B - C ) to identify the equivalent residues ( V45 in Heimdall 196 ubiquitin ) . When tested experimentally , the V45D mutation dramatically reduced the interaction between 197 ubiquitin and the UEV domain ( Figure 2D ) – implying that this interaction resembles the one seen in 198 eukaryotes . 199 200 The same was true of the equivalent Odinarchaeotal proteins . When Odin homologues of ubiquitin , 201 Vps23 and Vps28 were purified and mixed in vitro , we observed the formation of a stable complex by 202 size - exclusion chromatography ( Figure 2E ) ; mediated by an interaction between ubiquitin and the UEV 203 domain - containing Vps23 ( Figure 2E , S9 , and S10A ) . Furthermore , when analysed by size - exclusion 204 chromatography , Vps23 migrated through the column faster than expected for a monomer ( Figure S9 ) . 205 Follow up size - exclusion chromatography coupled with multi - angle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) 206 analyses ( Figure S10 A - C ) revealed that the Vps23 protein forms a stable dimeric assembly ( 60 . 37 207 kDa ) , while the calculated mass of the Vps23 - Vps28 complex was consistent with a single subunit of 208 Vps28 associating with the Vps23 dimer ( yielding a combined molecular weight of 88 . 27 kDa ) . In this , 209 the Odinarchaeotal Vps23 - Vps28 complex appears like the eukaryotic ESCRT - I subcomplex , which 210 assembles into a heterotrimeric core ‘headpiece’ comprised of Vps23 , Vps28 and Vps37 74 - 76 . As Asgard 211 genomes encode Vps23 - like proteins but lack their Vps37 homologues ( Figure 1A ) , it is likely that the 212 eukaryotic ESCRT - I ( Fig . S8 ) arose from a heterotrimeric archaeal ESCRT - I subcomplex composed of 213 a Vps23 homodimer and Vps28 . 214 215 Potential gene duplication and functional divergence of the eukaryotic ESCRT - II subcomplex 216 from putative Asgard archaeal precursors . 217 218 Turning to the ESCRT - II subcomplexes , our genomic analysis identified close homologues of Vps22 219 and Vps25 in Asgard archaeal genome assemblies , but not full - length Vps36 homologues . Since 220 eukaryotic Vps22 and Vps36 are structurally related 77 , 78 , and form a Vps22 - Vps36 heterodimer , we 221 investigated whether Asgard Vps22 homologues might homodimerize . To test this idea , we used size 222 exclusion chromatography ( Figure 3A ) and SEC - MALS ( Figure 3B ) to show that a Heimdall - Vps22 223 homologue ( HeimAB125 _ 14050 ) migrates with a size consistent with it forming a dimer . Moreover , after 224 chemical crosslinking to stabilize the Vps22 complex , through the addition of BS3 ( a homo - bifunctional 225 cross - linker ) or EDC ( hetero - bifunctional cross - linker that generates zero - length isopeptide bonds ) , the 226 Vps22 protein band detected using SDS - PAGE had a molecular weight of about 50 kDa , corresponding 227 to a dimer ( Figure 3C ) . Finally , using chemical cross - linking coupled with mass spectrometry ( XL - MS ) , 228 we identified two dimerization surfaces ( 41 - 47 and 160 - 167 amino acid regions ) in the 229 HeimAB125 _ 14050 Vps22 homodimer ( Figure 3D - E and Figure S11 ) . Taken together , these data 230 strongly suggest that Heimdallarcheota AB125 Vps22 forms a homodimer . Thus , it appears likely that 231 the eukaryotic Vps22 - Vps36 heterodimer arose during eukaryotic evolution following a gene duplication 232 and diversification event – just as seems to have been the case for the ESCRT - I complex . It is notable , 233 however , that when a SEC - MALS investigation was performed with the Odinarchaeota Vps22 , we did 234 not find evidence for its homodimerization . Since the Odin protein was observed to be monomeric 235 ( Figure S10D ) , it is currently unclear if it adopts a homodimeric architecture in the native host conditions 236 or might instead form a heterodimer by interacting with as - yet undiscovered proteins . 237 238 Structural models for the Odinarchaeotal and Hemidallarchaeotal ESCRT - II subcomplex proteins using 239 the I - TASSER 70 - 72 and tr - Rosetta 79 servers ( Figure S12 A - B ) suggested them having structural 240 similarities with their eukaryotic counterparts , Vps22 and Vps25 , based largely on the possession of 241 shared tandem winged - helix ( WH ) domains 77 , 78 , 80 . We examined the recombinant Odinarchaeota Vps22 242 and Vps25 by CD spectroscopy ( Figure S12 C - F ) . This confirmed that both proteins are folded and have 243 the predicted secondary structural elements . To further characterise Asgard ESCRT - II subunits , these 244 proteins were submitted to crystallisation trials . In the case of Odinarchaeota Vps25 , while we were 245 unable to crystalise the full - length soluble protein , high quality crystals could be generated using an N - 246 terminally truncated version ( deleting N - terminal residues 1 to 58 ) , which were then used to determine 247 the structure at a resolution of 1 . 80 Å ( Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 4A - C ) . Inspection of this 248 structure revealed that the Asgard Vps25 core is composed of a tandem WH domain repeat , consistent 249 with the predicted tr - Rosetta model , and is very similar in structure to the equivalent eukaryotic protein 250 ( Figure 4C ) . Taken together , these findings provide further support for the idea that all the ESCRT - II 251 subcomplex proteins in eukaryotes and Asgard archaea alike share a common molecular architecture 252 based on a core tandem WH domain 77 , 78 . These data reinforce the concept that the ESCRT - II complex 253 arose during archaeal and eukaryotic evolution through a series of gene duplication and specialization 254 events 81 , 82 . 255 256 Key ESCRT complex protein - protein interactions revealed by yeast - 2 - hybrid analyses of the 257 Asgard archaeal systems 258 259 Since the ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II systems characterised above function as potential protein bridges 260 that physically connect Ub - modified proteins with the ESCRT - III machinery , we wanted a systematic 261 way to sensitively test for interactions within and across different subcomplexes . To do so , we carried 262 out a comprehensive reciprocal yeast two hybrid analysis ( Y2H ) in budding yeast to identify pairwise 263 protein interactions for the full set of Ub - ESCRT homologues from Thor - , Odin - , Loki - and 264 Heimdallarchaeota ( Figure 5A ) . As a control for this analysis , we used the same approach to 265 systematically probe for interactions between proteins that are known to function as part of the ESCRT 266 system in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( Figure S13 and Figure S14 ) . Importantly , in 267 these control experiments we were able to identify many of the expected interactions between 268 components of the Ub - ESCRT system in fission yeast . This included the previously reported interactions 269 within the respective ESCRT complexes ; ESCRT - I ( Sst6 - Vps28 ) , ESCRT - II ( Vps22 - Vps25 , Vps36 - 270 Vps25 ) , ESCRT - III ( Vps20 - Vps32 , Vps24 - Did4 ) , as well as published interactions that bridge the 271 eukaryotic ESCRT - I and - II subcomplexes ( Vps28 - Vps36 ) and those that connect ESCRT - II and - III 272 ( Vps20 - Vps25 , Vps20 - Vps22 ) ( Figure S13A ) . 273 274 We then applied Y2H analyses to systematically search for protein - protein interactions between 275 ESCRT - related components encoded by Asgard archaeal genomes ( Figure 5A ) . As expected , these 276 assays revealed interactions between ESCRT - III components and the Vps4 ATPase . In line with the 277 biochemical data presented above , these Y2H analyses also identified interactions between ubiquitin 278 and UEV domain - containing proteins in Heimdallarchaeota , Odinarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota ( Figure 279 5A and S14 ) . Furthermore , the UEV domain - containing Vps23 homologues from Odinarchaeota and 280 Heimdallarchaeota displayed interactions with Vps28 , as expected if they formed an ESCRT - I 281 subcomplex , whereas the Heimdallarchaeota utilise the single Vps23 - Vps28 fusion protein homologue 282 discussed above . The Y2H assays also detected the interaction between ubiquitin and this Heimdall 283 ESCRT - I fusion ( Figure 5A and Figure S13B ) . Interestingly , this analysis also suggested an alternative 284 pattern of protein interactions for the corresponding ESCRT - I proteins from Loki and Thor . In these two 285 cases , the freestanding steadiness box protein , equivalent to the alpha - helical hairpin ‘headpiece’ 73 , 74 , 83 286 coded within the same genomic neighbourhood as the rest of the Loki ESCRT machinery ( Figure 1C ) , 287 may come into play by interacting with Vps28 – mirroring the role of its eukaryotic counterpart in 288 mediating interactions between Vps23 , Vps28 and Vps37 . 289 290 The Y2H analyses also identified multiple interactions between the Lokiarchaeota and 291 Heimdallarchaeota ESCRT - I ( Vps28 and / or Vps23 ) and ESCRT - II ( Vps22 ) complexes . In addition , the 292 Y2H experiments indicate that the ESCRT - II component Vps22 from Heimdall , Loki and Thor can 293 interact with themselves , in agreement with the biochemical assays shown above . Finally , we identified 294 numerous interactions linking the Asgard ESCRT - II and - III ( Vps25 - ESCRT - IIIB ) , Vps4 - ESCRT - III and 295 between the ESCRT - III homologues ( - IIIA and - IIIB ) ( Figure 5A and Figure S14 ) , and suggests the 296 possibility of additional interactions between ESCRT - I and II subcomplexes with ESCRT - III proteins that 297 bypass Vps25 in Loki and Thor archaeota . We note that although we were unable to detect many such 298 interactions between the Odinarchaeotal proteins using the Y2H approach , since Odin is a thermophile , 299 it seems likely that the temperature used for these experiments ( 25°C ) may have influenced our ability 300 to identify interactions between proteins that are optimised to fold and work at much higher physiological 301 temperatures 58 . 302 303 DISCUSSION : 304 305 Here we provide experimental and computational support for the idea that many Asgard archaea 306 possess a streamlined version of the Ub - ESCRT system present in eukaryotes ( Figure 5B ) . It is clear 307 from our analyses , however , that the precise composition differs between species and across phyla . 308 This is especially the case for ESCRT - I subunit architecture . However , except for Thorarchaeota ( in 309 which ubiquitin encoding genes are yet to be identified ) , we found ubiquitin - binding UEV - domain 310 containing proteins coded by the genomes analysed . While these domains were often harboured within 311 proteins homologous to Vps23 , which include a C - terminal alpha - helical headpiece region involved in 312 ESCRT - I complex assembly , in other systems this alpha - helical ‘steadiness box’ domain was encoded 313 by a freestanding protein . Alternative ESCRT - I domain arrangements were also observed , such as the 314 UEV - Vps23 - Vps28 fusion found in Heimdallarchaeota ( Figure S8 ) . Taken together , the clear synteny 315 between genes of ubiquitylation apparatus and the ESCRT machinery in the Loki - , Hel - , Odin - , and 316 Heimdallarchaeotal genomes , and the experimentally verified Y2H interactions between ubiquitin and 317 UEVs in all the Asgards investigated , support a model in which ubiquitylated substrates recruit the 318 ESCRT - I in Asgard archaea . 319 320 In line with this , we were able to demonstrate direct binding between ubiquitin and UEV - containing 321 proteins that was dependent on a conserved hydrophobic patch in ubiquitin . Although Asgard archaea 322 appear to lack homologues of the eukaryotic ESCRT - I subunit Vps37 ( which assembles into a trimer 323 with Vps23 and Vps28 ) , it is notable that Vps23 and Vps28 from Odinarchaeota assemble into a similar 324 trimer that contains two copies of Vps23 . It is therefore possible that all three proteins of the eukaryotic 325 ESCRT - I complex evolved from a common ancestor containing an alpha - helical hairpin region , with 326 Vps37 having arisen as a eukaryotic innovation 73 . 327 328 Similarly , the eukaryotic ESCRT - II subcomplex forms a ‘Y - shaped’ hetero - tetrameric structure 329 consisting of a Vps22 / Vps36 stalk which binds two Vps25 subunits 77 , 78 . Although Vps22 and Vps25 330 coding genes were readily identifiable in the Asgard genomes as reported previously , we were unable 331 to identify Vps36 homologues . However , our biochemical and Y2H interrogation suggest that Vps22 332 from several Asgard phyla likely forms homodimers . In the corresponding eukaryotic complex , all three 333 of these ESCRT - II proteins ( Vps22 , Vps36 and Vps25 ) contain an evolutionarily conserved globular 334 core consisting of tandem winged helix ( WH ) domains 77 , 78 , 80 . The same appears true for the Asgard 335 ESCRT - II machinery , based upon modelling of Vps22 and Vps25 proteins from Odinarchaeota , and the 336 crystallographic Odinarchaeotal Vps25 structure . This suggests that all ESCRT - II proteins were initially 337 derived from a single WH - domain protein progenitor , with Vps36 emerging during eukaryogenesis . 338 339 Do ESCRT - I , - II , and - III contribute to a single pathway ? The colocation and synteny analyses strongly 340 suggest this possibility . The colocation of ESCRT - III with Vps25 indicates that these proteins function in 341 a related biochemical process . Y2H experiments revealed consistent interactions between Vps25 and 342 ESCRT - IIIB . Furthermore , this analysis provided support for there being an interaction between ESCRT - 343 I and ESCRT - II . We also found an interaction between the Lokiarchaeota steadiness box protein and 344 Vps22 , supporting the existence of physical interactions between the ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II 345 subcomplexes . These Y2H data and the corresponding gene cluster analysis point to ESCRT - I , - II , and 346 - III functioning in concert in Asgard archaea – although confirmation of this will require a future cell 347 biological and / or biochemical analyses . While it is not yet clear how the Ub - ESCRT system evolved , we 348 note that while ESCRT - III type proteins can be traced back to the last universal common ancestor 349 ( LUCA ) 63 , the Vps4 and ESCRT - III pair can only be found in archaea , whereas Ub , ESCRT - I and 350 ESCRT - II components are only found together in Asgard ( with the exception of Thorarchaeota , which 351 seemingly lack true ubiquitin homologues ) . This suggests a plausible pathway for the stepwise evolution 352 of the eukaryotic ubiquitin - directed ESCRT - dependent membrane trafficking system as , from its simple 353 beginnings in an archaeal progenitor , the machinery grew in complexity through successive rounds of 354 domain concatenation , gene duplication and divergence ( Figure 5B ) . 355 356 MATERIALS AND METHODS 357 358 Genomic survey of protein homologues 359 All genomes from organisms classified as Asgard archaea were downloaded from NCBI on December 360 5 th , 2020 . These genomes were taxonomically reclassified through a phylogenetic analysis based on a 361 set of 15 ribosomal proteins encoded in co - locating genes 84 . To ensure annotation homogeneity , protein 362 sequences were predicted de novo using Prodigal v2 . 6 . 3 85 , and ribosomal protein genes were detected 363 using psiblast 86 using predetermined orthologous sequences 58 , aligned with Mafft - linsi v7 . 450 87 and 364 processed with trimAl v1 . 4 . rev22 88 to remove sites with over 50 % gaps . All genomes containing at least 365 5 of these proteins were concatenated and used to reconstruct a tree with IQ - Tree v2 . 0 - rc1 89 the 366 LG + C60 + R4 + F model , using 1000 pseudoreplicates for ultrafast bootstrap 90 and SH - approximate 367 likelihood ratio tests ( Figure S1 ) . 368 369 These reclassified genomes were then annotated using interproscan v5 . 48 - 83 . 0 91 . A set of interpro 370 domains were used as diagnostic for the inference of Vps23 / 37 ( IPR017916 ) , Vps28 ( IPR007143 , 371 IPR037206 ) , Vps23 / 37 / 28 ( IPR037202 ) , Vps22 / 36 ( IPR016689 , IPR040608 , IPR021648 ) , Vps25 372 ( IPR008570 , IPR014041 ) , ESCRT - III ( IPR005024 ) , Vps4 ( IPR007330 , IPR031255 , IPR015415 ) , 373 ubiquitin ( IPR029071 , IPR000626 ) , ubiquitin - activating enzyme E1 ( IPR000594 ) , ubiquitin - conjugating 374 enzyme E2 ( IPR000608 , IPR006575 , IPR016135 ) , ubiquitin - ligase enzyme E3 ( IPR018611 ) , and 375 deubiquitinating enzyme ( IPR000555 ) genes . 376 377 Co - location of these genes was investigated through custom perl scripts and visualised using R ( R Core 378 Team 2018 , R : A language and environment for statistical computing . R Foundation for Statistical 379 Computing , Vienna , Austria . https : / / www . R - project . org / ) and the packages ggplot2 92 , cowplot 380 ( https : / / CRAN . R - project . org / package = cowplot ) , and genoPlotR 93 . 381 382 Generation of model structures using I - TASSER server 383 The model structures used in this study were generated as described below : 384 ( 1 ) The model structure of Heimdall E2 - like proteins for Figure S7A were generated using I - TASSER 70 - 385 72 ( https : / / zhanglab . ccmb . med . umich . edu / I - TASSER / ) . No template structure was selected for this 386 modelling . The amino acid sequence used for structural modelling is as follows ; HeimAB125 _ 07740 387 ( 27th - 135th amino acid residues ) ; ( ii ) HeimAB125 _ 09840 ( 1st - 107th amino acid residues ) ; ( iii ) 388 HeimAB125 _ 14070 ( 51st - 108th amino acid residues ) ; ( iv ) HeimAB125 _ 11700 ( 25th - 122nd amino acid 389 residues ) . The amino acid residues for the structural modelling were selected based on InterPro 390 annotation of “UBIQUITIN _ CONJUGAT _ 2” . It is important to note that the c score of HeimAB125 _ 14070 391 truncation was NaN , due to lower reliability of the model structure . 392 ( 2 ) The model structure of Heimdall UEV domain in HeimAB125 _ 14070 ( 1st - 130th amino acid residues ) 393 in complex with ubiquitin ( used in Figure 3B and S7B ) was generated using I - TASSER with crystal 394 structure of yeast UEV in complex with ubiquitin ( PDB : 1UZXa ) . 395 ( 3 ) The model structure of Heimdall UEV domain in HeimAB125 _ 14070 ( 1st - 130th amino acid residues ) 396 for Figure S7A was generated by using I - TASSER with crystal structure of UEV ( PDB : 1KPQ ) . 397 ( 4 ) The model structure of Heimdall ubiquitin ( HeimAB125 _ 14240 ) and Heimdall Vps22 398 ( HeimAB125 _ 14050 ) were generated by I - TASSER without assigning template structures . 399 In most of the cases , I - TASSER provided several models . We always used the model which showed 400 the highest c scores . The score , templates and amino acid region were listed in Table S1 . 401 402 Asgard proteins used in this study 403 The Heimdall - , Loki - , Odin - , and Thorarchaeota amino acid sequences were obtained from Uniprot 404 ( https : / / www . uniprot . org / ) and the Uniprot Entry ID are listed in Table S2 . The corresponding genes 405 were synthesized for the expression in E . coli and yeast . The Odinarchaeota _ LCB4 ORFs ( accession 406 codes provided in Supplementary Table 2 ) were PCR amplified form MDA amplified environmental DNA 407 isolated from the Lower Culex Basin Yellowstone National Park , USA as described 94 and cloned into 408 either pET28a ( Vps23 and Vps28 ) or pET30 ( Vps22 and Vps25 ) ( Novagen ) , respectively . Amplified 409 genes were cloned into the plasmids using the restriction sites placing the ORFs in frame with the 410 plasmid - encoded hexa - histidine tags . 411 412 Plasmids used in this study 413 The Asgard genes obtained by gene synthesis were cloned into yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) vectors and E . 414 coli expression vector . The plasmids for Y2H are listed in Table S3 . The E . coli expression plasmids are 415 listed Table S6 . 416 417 Systematic , Reciprocal Yeast Two - Hybrid assays 418 Y2H assays were performed using the set of genes listed in Table S3 . The plasmids used in this study 419 are listed in Table S3 . Indicated genes of interest were cloned both in “bait - ProteinA” and “prey - ProteinB” 420 vectors or vice versa , which have DNA binding protein LexA and / or activation domain of Gal4p were 421 cloned into pMM5 and pMM6 plasmids respectively 95 , 96 . Plasmids carrying these constructs were 422 transformed into the yeast strains SGY37 ( MATa ) and YPH500 ( MAT a ) . Transformants with plasmids 423 plexADBD ( pMM5 ) and pGal4AD ( pMM6 ) were selected on plates lacking Histidine or Leucine , 424 respectively . After mating , the two strains carrying the desired plasmids were grown on YPD plates for 425 2 days at 30˚C and replica plated on selection plates ( without Histidine and Leucine ) for 2 days at 30˚C 426 before the overlay . The interaction between the protein products fused to the DNA binding and activation 427 domains were analyzed by the activity of β - galactosidase by the cleavage of X - Gal ( BIO - 37035 , Bioline , 428 UK ) . For detecting the β - galactosidase activity overlaying of low melting agarose with X - Gal ( over lay 429 mix was prepared freshly ) , overlay solution was added slowly on to the plates . Interaction of LexA - 430 Protein - A with Gal4 - Protein - B resulted in the activation of expression of the lacZ gene coding for β - 431 galactosidase , converting X - Gal to produce blue colour . Plates were monitored every 30 minutes to see 432 the appearance of blue colour . Plates were scanned after 16hr of incubation with the X - Gal overlay 433 mixture . 434 435 Phylogenetic reconstruction 436 [ A ] UEV and E2 437 Amino acid sequences of UEV domain - containing proteins , TSG101 / Vps23 and UBC domain - containing 438 proteins in H . sapiens , S . cerevisiae , D . discoideum , E . histolica , A . thaliana , C . marolae , T . brucei , T . 439 pseudonana and T . parva were obtained from Uniprot . Asgard E2L proteins from Odinarchaeota ( strain 440 LCB _ 4 ) , Heimdallarchaeota ( strains AB125 , LC2 and LC3 ) , and Lokiarchaeota ( strains GC14 _ 75 and 441 CR _ 4 ) were also obtained from Uniprot . These sequences were aligned with Mafft - linsi v7 . 450 , and the 442 resulting multiple - sequence alignment was used as query for a Psiblast ( v2 . 10 . 0 + ) against all Asgard 443 archaeal genomes ( see Genome survey of protein homologs ) . All hits with e - values lower than 1e - 5 444 were used together with query sequences and aligned using Mafft - linsi . The resulting alignment was 445 trimmed using trimAl v1 . 4 . rev22 , and sequences containing over 60 % gaps in the trimmed alignment 446 were removed . The obtained alignment was used for a phylogenetic reconstruction with IQ - Tree 2 . 0 - 447 rc2 89 , under the model Q . pfam + C20 + G4 + F , chosen by ModelFinder 97 between combinations of 448 empirical matrices ( LG , WAG , JTT , and Q . pfam ) with mixture models ( C20 , C40 , and C60 ) and various 449 rate heterogeneity ( none , G4 and R4 ) and frequency ( none , and F ) and using 1000 ultrafast bootstrap 450 pseudoreplicates . The resulting phylogeny was used as guide to reconstruct another tree under the 451 PMSF approximation of the chosen model and using 100 non - parametric bootstrap pseudoreplicates . 452 The resulting bootstrap trees were used both using the standard Felsenstein Bootstrap Proportion and 453 the more recent Transfer Bootstrap Expectation 98 interpretations . 454 455 [ B ] Vps22 and Vps36 456 Eukaryotic Vps22 , Vps36 and Vps25 and Asgard Vps22 / 36 and Vps25 homologs sequences were 457 downloaded from NCBI ( Supplementary Data X ) . These 187 sequences were aligned using Mafft - linsi 458 v7 . 450 and trimmed with trimAl with the parameter “ - gappyout” . A maximum - likelihood tree was then 459 reconstructed using IQ - Tree v2 . 0 - rc1 under the model LG + C60 + R4 + F , using 1000 ultrafast bootstrap 460 and SH - approximate likelihood ratio test pseudoreplicates . In parallel , potential outgroup sequences 461 ( eukaryotic Rpc35 / Rpc6 , Asgard archaeal UFM1 and bacterial ScpB ; Supplementary Data X ) were 462 downloaded and added to the previous sequences . Three additional Asgard archaeal sequences were 463 found to contain potential plekstrin domains and were used as query for a Blast - p search against the 464 Asgard proteomes to recruit homologs identified as hits with e - values lower than 1e - 10 . The resulting 465 set of 314 sequences was then aligned with Mafft - linsi v7 . 450 and trimmed with trimAl to remove all 466 sites with over 90 % gaps . The resulting trimmed alignment was used to reconstruct a maximum - 467 likelihood tree using IQ - Tree v2 . 0 - rc2 under the PMSF approximation 99 of the LG + C60 + R4 + F model 468 using 100 non - parametric bootstrap pseudoreplicates . The resulting bootstrap trees were used both 469 using the standard Felsenstein Bootstrap Proportion and the more recent Transfer Bootstrap 470 Expectation interpretations . To ensure we did not miss possible homologs of ESCRT - II sequences 471 outside of Asgards , we used the previous set of 187 Vps22 / Vps36 / Vps25 sequences as query for a 472 psiblast search against the NR database ( 1 iteration , e - value threshold of 1e - 10 ) , and parsed the 473 resulting 4745 hits to remove proteins originating from Asgard archaeal or eukaryotic genomes . After 474 parsing , only 9 sequences remained , belonging to various putative archaea and bacteria . A Blast - p 475 search of these sequences against NR confirmed that their best hits were Asgard archaea or eukaryotic 476 sequences . We added these sequences to the previous 227 Vps22 / Vps36 / Vps25 / Outgroup sequences , 477 aligned them with Mafft - linsi v7 . 450 and trimmed with trimAl to remove sites with over 50 % gaps . We 478 used this alignment to reconstruct a tree with IQ - Tree under the LG + C20 + G4 + F model , using 1000 479 ultrafast bootstrap and SH - approximate likelihood ratio test pseudoreplicates . The resulting tree 480 confirmed that these 9 homologs were well embedded in the clades of Asgard archaeal or eukaryotic 481 Vps22 , thus likely representing Asgard archaeal or eukaryotic Vps22 sequences that have been 482 misclassified in public databases . 483 484 485 bdSUMO tag vector and bdSUMO protease used in this study 486 The vector carrying a 6 - His residues ( His - tag ) followed by SUMO protein from Brachypodium distachyon 487 were generated as described before 100 , 101 with slight modification . The gene of B . distachyon SUMO 488 protein ( bdSUMO ) was synthesized ( IDT gBlock ) and cloned into pET28a in frame with sequence 489 encoding the N - terminal His - tag . The codon of the bdSUMO was optimized for the expression in E . coli 490 K12 strain . The resulting vector , pSUMO was used to clone Heimdall ESCRT genes for their expression 491 in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) . To express and purify SUMO protease in B . distachyo , we synthesized genes of 492 B . distachyo SENP1 whose codone were optimized for expression in E . coli ( IDT gBlock ) . The gene 493 fragment was cloned into pET28a vector in - frame with N - terminal His - tag . The protein , His - bdSENP1 494 was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified and used for SUMO - TAG cleavage . 495 496 Buffers used for protein purification 497 The composition of ESCRT lysis buffer was as follows : 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 150 498 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM ATP , and 15 mM Imidazole . The composition of ESCRT buffer was as 499 follows : 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM NaCl . The composition of XL buffer is as 500 follows ; 20 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl . 501 502 Protein purification 503 504 ( A ) Heimdall proteins 505 506 Purification of untagged proteins 507 The proteins were expressed as N - terminal His - SUMO fusions ( His - SUMO ) from a pSUMO vector . After 508 the affinity purification using His - Nickel interaction , the His - SUMO was cleaved by His - bdSENP1 and 509 both the N - terminal His - SUMO tag and His - bdSENP1 were absorbed on a Ni - NTA column . The 510 untagged recombinant protein was further purified by size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) . 511 512 Purification of ESCRT proteins 513 514 [ a ] Heimdall Vps22 and Full - length or UEV - domain of Heimdall UEV - Vps28 ( HeimAB125 _ 14070 ) 515 The E . coli cells expressing these fusion proteins were lysed using a pressure homogenizer ( Stanstead 516 # FPG12800 , the 20 - 30 psi for several times precooled at 5˚C ) instead of sonicator . Elution after the 517 SEC was concentrated followed by high - speed centrifugation at 4˚C ( 21000xg , 15 min ) to get rid of 518 aggregation . The samples were snap - frozen and stored at - 80˚C . 519 520 [ b ] Ubiquitin with N - terminal His tag 521 Cells were re - suspended in lysis buffer containing 2x concentration of PIC ( Roche complete , EDTA - free 522 # 05056489001 ) and 2 mM PMSF . Cells were lysed using a pressure homogenizer ( Stanstead 523 # FPG12800 , the 20 - 30 psi for several times ) precooled to 5˚C . After cell lysis , the total volume of the 524 sample was ~ 50 mL . The insoluble fraction was removed by high - speed centrifugation at 4˚C ( 25658 x 525 g for 1 hour , Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC # A23 - 6 x 100 rotor ) . The supernatant was incubated with 2 ml 526 Ni - NTA resin ( Thermo SCIENTIFIC # 88222 ) for 1 hour at 4˚C . The resin was washed with 200 mL ice - 527 cold lysis buffer , followed by 150 ml ESCRT - buffer . The bound protein was eluted with ESCRT - buffer 528 containing 300 mM imidazole . Elution fractions were combined and concentrated to a volume of 500 µl . 529 The sample was spun at 21000 x g for 15 min at 4˚C and the supernatant was applied to 16 / 60 sephacryl 530 S - 100 HR column equilibrated with ESCRT - buffer . The eluate was concentrated and spun at 4˚C 531 ( 21000xg , 15 min ) to get rid of aggregates . The samples were snap - frozen and stored at - 80˚C . 532 533 ( B ) Odinarchaeal proteins 534 535 Thermophilic Odinarchaeota proteins were expressed in Rosetta ( DE3 ) pLysS Escherichia coli cells 536 ( Novagen ) . Cultures were grown at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0 . 3 then cooled to 25°C and further grown to 537 an OD 600 of 0 . 6 and induced overnight with 0 . 33 mM IPTG . Cells expressing the recombinant 538 Odinarchaeota proteins were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 539 300 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 05 % β - mercaptoethanol . 1X EDTA - free protease inhibitors ( Complete 540 cocktail , Roche ) were added and cells were lysed by sonication and heat clarified at 60°C for 20 min 541 before centrifugation at ( 14 , 000 r . p . m . for 10 min ) to remove insoluble material . Supernatants were 542 filtered and then purified by IMAC by gravity flow to a column of Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) . The columns 543 were washed with resuspension buffer and then resuspension buffer plus 15 mM imidazole . Proteins 544 were then eluted in resuspension buffer plus 500 mM imidazole . Fractions containing the purified 545 proteins were pooled and concentrated before running a size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) step 546 over a Superdex 200 16 / 600 column ( GE Healthcare ) , in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 % 547 glycerol , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol . N - terminal His - tags were then removed from the Odinarchaeota 548 Vps23 ( TSG101 ) and Vps28 proteins by thrombin cleavage and further purification by SEC . Fractions 549 containing the purified proteins were pooled , concentrated , aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid N 2 . 550 Protein concentrations were quantified by UV spectrophotometry . 551 552 Analytics Size Exclusion Chromatography 553 Heimdallarchaeota Vps22 ( 27 . 9 kDa ) was subjected to analytical SEC using a Superdex 200 16 / 600 554 size exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) . The sample was loaded onto the column in a buffer comprised 555 of 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl and 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol at a flow rate of 0 . 5 mL / min . The 556 calibration curve was established under the same conditions using the following standard proteins 557 ( Sigma MWGF1000 ) : carbonic anhydrase ( CAN ; 29 kDa ) , bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; 66 kDa ) , alcohol 558 dehydrogenase ( ADH ; 150 kDa ) , beta - amylase ( BAM ; 200 kDa ) , apoferritin ( AFE ; 443 kDa ) and 559 thyroglobulin ( TGL ; 669 kDa ) . 560 Physical interaction between the Odinarchaeota ESCRT - I complex proteins ( Vps23 , Vps28 and 561 ubiquitin ) was examined by size - exclusion chromatography using an analytical Superdex S200 HR 562 10 / 300 column ( GE Healthcare ) . Prior to the gel filtration analyses , ESCRT - I complexes were formed at 563 60°C by mixing 250 μg of each protein in a final volume of 500 μl gel filtration buffer ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 564 8 . 0 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT ) . The complexes were subsequently spun at 16 , 000 g in a 565 benchtop centrifuge for 5 min to remove any precipitated material , before loading onto the size exclusion 566 chromatography column . 0 . 5 ml fractions were collected and resolved by SDS - PAGE , on 15 % 567 polyacrylamide gels . The proteins were then visualized with Coomassie stain . 568 569 Size exclusion chromatography – multi - angle laser light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) 570 The molecular mass and oligomeric state of Heimdall Vps22 was determined in solution using SEC - 571 MALS . Data were obtained with a Wyatt HeleosII18 angle light scattering machine connected to a Wyatt 572 Optilab rEX online refractive index detector ( Wyatt Technology ) . Samples were purified using a 573 Superdex 200 increase 10 / 300 analytical gel filtration column ( Cytiva ) coupled to an Agilent 1200 series 574 LC system at 0 . 5 ml / min in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl buffer before detecting the light 575 scattering and refractive index in a standard SEC - MALS format . Protein concentration was obtained 576 from the excess differential refractive index of 0 . 185 ∆RI for 1 g / ml or using the sequence UV extinction 577 coefficient of 0 . 964 at 280 nm for 1 mg / ml calculated by ProtParam . The determined protein 578 concentration and scattering intensities were used to estimate the molecular mass from the intercept of 579 a Debye plot using Zimm’s model and the Wyatt ASTRA software . The experimental configuration was 580 checked with a BSA standard , run in the same buffer and using the same sample injection volume of 581 100uL . The BSA monomer peak was utilised to examine the mass determination and to inspect the 582 inter - detector delay volumes and band broadening parameters that were used during analysis in Wyatt’s 583 ASTRA software . The SEC chromatogram , showing RI as concentration signal , is shown in Figure 3B 584 as blue and red lines for loaded sample concentration of 2 and 0 . 5 mg / ml , respectively . The mass 585 evaluated averaged over the central 75 % of peak area is 54 . 4 and 54 . 2 kDa for the two loadings 586 indicating stable formation of dimer at SEC concentrations . The mass evaluated using UV as 587 concentration source was 55 . 7 kDa for the 2 mg / ml sample . The Odinarchaeota samples were analysed 588 by SEC - MALS ( 100 μl protein complex at 2 mg / ml ) were passed over a Superdex 200 10 / 300 Increase 589 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) , in 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 300 mM NaCl . The column output was fed into a 590 miniDAWN TREOS MALS detector system with a 60mW laser source at 664 nm , and three fixed angle 591 detectors at 49 . 90 , and 131 degrees ( Wyatt Technology ) , followed by a Shimadzu RID - 20A Refractive 592 Index Detector at 30 . 5°C . 593 594 Circular Dichroism ( CD ) 595 Proteins were buffer exchanged into freshly prepared buffer ( 10 mM potassium phosphate , 50 mM 596 sodium sulphate , pH 7 . 2 ) using PD - 10 desalting prepacked columns ( Sephadex G - 25M , GE Healthcare ) 597 following manufactures instructions . 598 From the protein samples ( 5 μM ) CD spectra ( in triplicate ) were acquired using a Chirascan 599 Plus Benchtop CD spectrophotometer over 180 - 260 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm and a pathlength of 600 0 . 2 mm . The mean buffer subtracted CD spectra ( measured ellipticity : mdeg ) were 601 interpolated between 190 - 250 nm using Origin Pro 2018b and fitted to the BeStSel algorithm to 602 determine the secondary structural elements 102 . Structural models for each ESCRT protein were 603 generated using I - TASSER 70 - 72 ( or for full - length Vps25 , trRosetta 79 ) after which the STRIDE web 604 server 103 was used to estimate secondary structure elements for comparison with the CD derived 605 estimations . 606 607 D N _ Vps25 Crystallisation conditions 608 An N - terminally truncated Vps25 expression construct ( removing the first 58 amino acids ) was 609 generated using the primers and Od D N _ ESCIIV25forXhoI and OdESCIIV25revXhoI as described in 610 Supplementary Table 2 . The protein was purified as described above , except 5 . 25 mM TCEP was used 611 as the reducing agent in the final size exclusion chromatography step . 612 D N _ Vps25 crystals were grown by sitting - drop vapour diffusion using our in - house high - throughput 613 crystallisation platform 104 . Vps25 was used at a concentration of 21 . 4 mg / ml and the best crystals were 614 obtained in the condition E12 of the Morpheus screen 105 : [ 120 mM ethylene glycols , 100 mM buffer 3 615 ( 26 . 7 ml 1 M bicine plus 23 . 3 ml 1 M Trizma base ) , 12 . 5 % ( w / v ) PEG 3350 , 12 . 5 % ( w / v ) , 12 . 5 % ( w / v ) 616 PEG 1K , 12 . 5 % ( w / v ) MPD ] , pH 8 . 5 at 20°C with a protein : reservoir ratio of 1 : 4 and a total volume of 617 0 . 4 μl . The condition was already cryo - protected . Crystals were harvested by flash cooling in liquid 618 nitrogen . 619 620 X - ray diffraction data collection 621 Native diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source ( Harwell , UK ) at beamline I03 . Data 622 were collected over 360° with 0 . 1° oscillation ( Supplemental Table 1 ) , integrated with DIALS 623 ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1107 / S2059798317017235 ) and scaled / merged with Aimless 624 ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3689523 / ) from the CCP4 suite 106 . The crystals belong 625 to the space group P2 1 2 1 2 , with unit cell dimensions of a = 101 . 23 Å , b = 31 . 5 Å , c = 59 . 5 Å and one 626 molecule per asymmetric unit .

Systematic reciprocal Yeast two - hybrid assays between Asgard ESCRT proteins and 824 new insight gained from investigating ESCRT from Asgard . 825 826 ( A ) Summary of Y2H interactions . Molecules related to the Ub - ESCRT pathway found in 827 Lokiarchaeota ( Lokiarch ) , Heimdallarchaeota ( HeimAB125 ) , Thorarchaeota , and 828 Odinachaeota ( OdinLCB4 ) were examined comprehensively using Y2H , and the detected 829 interactions are illustrated ( see also Figure S6 for the individual results ) 830 831 ( B ) Schematic representation of the arrangement of the Asgard ESCRT pathway based on this 832 work . In the Heimdallarcheota and Lokiarchaeota ESCRT - II complexes the Vps22 subunit 833 forms a homodimer comparible to the eukaryotic Vps22 / Vps36 ESCRT - II heterodimeric stalk . 834 In Odinarcheota , however , the Vps22 homologue does not appear to dimerize and as yet 835 undetermined factor therefore likely bridges the interaction between the ESCRT - I and - II 836 subcomplexes . The Odinarcheota Vps23 homologue forms a dimer thereby presenting two 837 ubiquitin - binding UEV domains . The Vps23 dimer interacts with a single Vps28 protein thus 838 forming a tripartite complex , reminiscent of the eukaryotic Vps37 / Vps23 / Vps28 complex . In 839 Heimdallarcheota the Vps23 and Vps28 functions are fused in a single protein that also 840 dimerises . Compare with the eukaryotic arrangement as shown in Supplementary Figure S1 . 841 842 843 844 References 845 846 1 Henne , W . M . , Buchkovich , N . J . & Emr , S .
