Far from being a passive participant , the PM is now known to physically , as well as biochemically , inﬂu - ence cell processes ranging from vesicle trafﬁcking to actin assembly . Here we review current understanding of how changes in PM tension regulate cell shape and movement , as well as how cells sense PM tension . Introduction One way that cells interact with the world around them is biochemically . For example , binding of soluble extracellu - lar ligands to receptors on the cell membrane can trigger intracellular signaling cascades . More recently , it has become clear that physical interactions are also an impor - tant currency of information transfer in cells and tissues [ 1 , 2 ] ( reviewed in [ 3 ] ) . In particular , tension in the PM has been shown to regulate many cell behaviors , including vesicle trafﬁcking [ 4 ] and cell motility [ 5 , 6 ] . The PM is often described by the ﬂuid mosaic model [ 7 ] , which char - acterizes it as a 2D continuous ﬂuid bilayer of lipids with freely diffusing embedded proteins . In this paradigm , the bilayer is considered a uniform semipermeable barrier that serves as a passive matrix for membrane proteins . How - ever , this model is incomplete ; lipids are now known to have a much more active role in regulating membrane structure and biological function [ 8 – 10 ] ( reviewed in [ 11 ] ) and the mechanical properties of the PM need to be included for a complete picture . Mechanically , membranes have a low shear modulus ( a result of the ﬂuid nature of the lipid bilayer ; 4 – 10 (cid:2) 10 – 3 N / m [ 12 – 14 ] ) , a high elastic modulus ( due to the small stretch in bilayers ; 10 3 N / m 2 [ 15 , 16 ] ) , a variable viscosity ( which depends on membrane composition ; 0 . 36 – 2 . 1 (cid:2) 10 – 3 Pa s for an erythrocyte [ 16 ] ) , and a bending stiffness strongly inﬂu - enced by membrane proteins and cytoskeletal elements ( 10 – 19 N m [ 17 – 19 ] ) . Membrane tension is related to the force needed to deform a membrane . Historically , the term membrane tension has been applied to deﬁne different concepts , and this has lead to confusion in the literature . Initially , membrane tension was measured in lipid vesicles ( Box 1 ) in which the force needed to stretch the membrane is the in - plane membrane tension ( T m , N / m ) . In cells , the force needed to deform the PM is greater than that for a pure lipid vesicle due to contributions from membrane proteins and membrane - to - cortex attachments ( MCA ) ( g , N / m ) , which link the membrane to the underlying cortex and also resist membrane deformation . Thus , PM tension , also known as apparent membrane tension or effective membrane tension , is the sum of T m and g ( Box 2 ) . Research in recent decades has established the impor - tance of PM tension as a physical regulator of cell motility and morphology [ 6 , 20 – 23 ] , but the mechanism of tension sensation and how membrane tension is integrated in the cell’s mechanical properties are unknown . We will focus on how PM tension affects and is affected by other cellular processes and will outline possible mechanisms for mem - brane tension sensation . Feedback between PM tension and cellular processes Some studies point to PM tension being a constant param - eter within a given cell type [ 24 ] . However , it is unclear whether cells have a preferred ‘set point’ for PM tension and , if so , how cells measure their PM tension . Moreover , in cells , biological membranes are active in the sense that they are constantly maintained out of equilibrium by cellular processes that contribute to changes in PM area , composition , and MCA protein activity . This adds complex - ity but also gives the cell multiple routes of adjustment . Several cellular processes affect and are affected by PM tension ( Figure 1 ) . Exocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis PM tension regulates the balance between exocytosis and endocytosis in numerous systems ; exocytosis ( which is stimulated by high membrane tension ) acts to decrease PM tension , whereas endocytosis ( which is stimulated by low membrane tension ) increases it [ 25 ] ( reviewed in [ 4 , 24 , 26 , 27 ] ) . These opposing effects of vesicle trafﬁcking could enable cells to keep tension close to a set point [ 28 ] . When the PM reservoir is reduced following cell spreading , there is a twofold increase in PM tension followed by activation of exocytosis and myosin - based contraction [ 20 ] . The rate of spreading and the time point at which exocytosis and myosin contraction occur are highly depen - dent on PM tension . These data implicate tension in coordinating membrane trafﬁcking , actomyosin contrac - tion , and PM area change . More recently , MCA has been shown to determine the actin dependence of clathrin coat Review Corresponding authors : Fletcher , D . A . ( fletch @ berkeley . edu ) ; Weiner , O . D .

Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is indepen - dent of actin dynamics in many circumstances but requires actin polymerization in others . On the apical surface of polarized cells where MCA is higher [ 21 , 29 ] or following cell swelling , actin engagement is necessary to convert a coated pit into a vesicle [ 21 ] . Caveolae Caveolae , invaginations of the PM that are formed by caveolins , are physiological membrane reservoirs that have recently been shown to enable cells to accommodate sudden changes in PM tension [ 30 , 31 ] . Increases in tension through cell stretching or hypo - osmotic shock induce Box 1 . Techniques to measure and manipulate membrane tension Measuring membrane tension Experiments to determine mechanical properties of biological membranes began in the 1930s using sea urchin eggs and red blood cells [ 60 , 61 ] . Since then , new higher - resolution techniques have been developed . Here we list the most commonly used approaches for measuring membrane tension . Compression of the cell with two plates ( Figure I a ) and micropipette aspiration ( Figure I b ) . These techniques have been extensively used for studying the mechanical properties of mem - branes in lipid vesicles , urchin eggs , and red blood cells [ 15 , 18 , 60 – 63 ] . However , they are applicable only to lipid vesicles or suspension cells with simple morphologies and cannot be used for cells with complex morphologies such as neurons or neutrophils . Moreover , in cells , isolating the contribution of PM tension to these measurements is complicated by the fact that a significant portion of the measured forces can be due to deformations of the cytoskeleton , in particular the actin cortex that lies immediately under the PM . Tethers . Tethers ( which lack a continuous cytoskeleton ) have been studied to measure PM tension . Initially these experiments were performed using a micropipette to hold cells or lipid vesicles and a second pipette to extract a membrane tether ( Figure Ic ) [ 64 ] . More recently atomic force microscope ( AFM ) cantilevers , optical tweezers , and magnetic tweezers have enabled higher - resolution measure - ments of PM tension ( Figure Id ) [ 65 – 67 ] . See Box 2 for an in - depth description of how tethers can be used to measure membrane tension . Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based biosen - sors . These were recently developed for assaying tension in the cytoskeleton and at sites of adhesion [ 68 ] . Although the field currently lacks comparable imaging - based sensors for membrane tension , such a tool would enable less invasive analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of PM tension in living cells . Moreover , intracel - lular organelles are not accessible for tether experiments , and such technology would allow us to determine whether the PM is the only organelle that can act as a mechanical sensor . Manipulating membrane tension Vesicle fusion , lipid addition , and changes in osmolarity . These have been used to manipulate T m [ 6 , 69 ] , but none is quantitative unless combined with simultaneous measurements of tension such as tether pulling . Moreover , how much those techniques affect cytoskeletal components is unknown . Multiple tethers . Pulling multiple tethers with an AFM [ 70 ] is an alternative method that can be used to measure and manipulate membrane tension simultaneously .

Quantifying membrane tension . ( a ) The spherical cell or lipid vesicle is compressed with known force ( F ) between two parallel plates . R1 and R2 are the radii of the principal curvatures of the surface . The internal pressure P ( P = F / A ) is the applied force F divided by the contacted area ( A = p D 2 ) between the plate and the cell or vesicle . This pressure is in equilibrium with the surface tension T ( see Equation [ 1 ] in figure ) . ( b ) The membrane of a spherical cell or lipid vesicle is deformed by a micropipette . Pp is the pressure in the pipette , and Po is the pressure in the reservoir . Ro and Rp are the radii of the cell or vesicle and the pipette . The resulting isotropic stress in the membrane is the surface tension T and is determined by Equation [ 2 ] in figure . ( c ) Initially , tethers were formed using a micropipette to hold samples with suction pressure . A bead in a second pipette was used to extract a membrane tether with force F . Rp and Ro are the radii of the pipette and the cell or vesicle . The tether radius Rt can be calculated from the change in the length of membrane projection in the pipette ( D Lp ) caused by the tether length change ( D Lt ) as seen in Equation [ 3 ] in figure or can be derived from the membrane bending stiffness / static tether force relationship as seen in Equation [ 4 ] in figure [ 17 ] for cells with simple morphologies , such as red blood cells or lipid vesicles . ( d ) Atomic force microscopy cantilevers and optical tweezers provide higher - resolution measurements of plasma membrane ( PM ) tension [ 65 , 66 , 79 , 80 ] .

Review Trends in Cell Biology February 2013 , Vol . 23 , No . 2 48 disassembly of caveolae , whereas recovery of iso - osmolari - ty leads to complete caveolar reassembly [ 30 ] . How caveo - lae buffer PM tension is not yet fully understood , because the amount of area released on membrane tension surge is very small ( approximately 0 . 3 % ) [ 30 ] . Actin network assembly To generate lamellipodium - like protrusions during cell crawling , growing actin ﬁlaments must generate sufﬁcient local force to displace the PM [ 5 , 20 , 23 ] . Indeed , actin - based protrusion can lead to an increase in T m as the force of polymerization unfolds wrinkles in the membrane during cell spreading [ 20 ] . Moreover , an increase in PM tension constrains the spread of the existing leading edge and prevents the formation of secondary fronts in chemotactic cells such as neutrophils [ 6 ] . In these cells , increasing cell tension by micropipette aspiration is sufﬁcient to act as a long - range inhibitor of the signals that promote actin as - sembly at the leading edge . Conversely , the reduction of PM tension through hyperosmotic shock produces global activa - tion of leading edge signals [ 6 ] . Because the front is the likely source of tension , any ﬂuctuation in front size is immediately balanced by compensatory changes in tension levels , pro - viding a possible mechanism of homeostasis [ 5 , 6 ] . Models of the PM as a global mechanical regulator Several models suggest a role of PM tension as a global mechanical regulator that coordinates cell protrusion and retraction . PM tension has been suggested to optimize motility by streamlining ﬁlament polymerization in the direction of movement [ 22 ] . A model of actin network polymerization in an inextensible membrane bag can quantitatively predict both cell shape and speed and reca - pitulate the natural phenotypic variability in a large pop - ulation of motile epithelial ﬁsh keratocytes [ 23 ] . If PM tension is assumed to be spatially homogeneous at all points along the cell boundary , the force per ﬁlament is inversely proportional to the local ﬁlament density . There - fore , at the center of the leading edge , the membrane resistance per ﬁlament is small , allowing ﬁlaments to grow rapidly and generate protrusion . As ﬁlament density grad - ually decreases towards the cell sides and the cell rear , the forces per ﬁlament caused by PM tension increase until polymerization is stalled and the actin network disassem - bles [ 23 ] . More recently , Ofer et al . [ 32 ] hypothesized a simple disassembly clock mechanism in which the rear position of a lamellipodium is determined by where the actin network has disassembled enough for membrane tension to crush the actin network and haul it forward . Finally , PM tension could also limit bleb expansion [ 33 ] , but direct experimental evidence is still missing . Role of cytoskeletal tension versus PM tension Both cytoskeletal tension ( also referred to as contractility ) and membrane tension are capable of transmitting forces Box 2 . Quantifying membrane tension and MCAs from tethers The mathematical relationship between tether force ( F o ) and tension is known for lipid vesicles [ 15 , 63 , 71 ] . In cells , the tether force is generated by a combination of : ( i ) T m of the lipid - bilayer ; ( ii ) membrane bending stiffness ( B ) ; and ( iii ) MCA ( g ) [ 17 , 72 ] . The T m and cytoskeleton adhesion terms are difficult to separate and are therefore combined into a single term ( T ) that is known by multiple names : PM tension , apparent membrane tension , or effective membrane tension [ 17 ] : T ¼ T m þ g ¼ F 2o = 8B p 2 [ I ] ( i ) T m is the result of the membrane being an inelastic fluid that equilibrates stresses within milliseconds [ 40 , 73 ] : T m ¼ k ð D A = A Þ [ II ] where k is the elastic area stretch modulus , which depends on lipid composition , and A is the cell surface area . T m and k completely characterize the differential equation of state for planar surfaces . However , when the surface is not a plane ( e . g . , when it is rippled due to thermally driven fluctua - tions ) , measurements of these parameters include the entropic elasticity of the membrane . T m appears to be uniform throughout the whole cell , even across the junctions of epithelial cells [ 28 ] , and on cell blebs in which the membrane separates from the actomyosin cortex [ 29 , 74 ] . ( ii ) The membrane bending stiffness ( B ) relates to the force needed to bend the membrane for a given radius of curvature . It has been experimentally measured for tethers in lipid vesicles . It is approximately 10 – 19 N m for a typical lipid bilayer , red cell , or neutrophil membrane [ 17 – 19 ] . It can also be calculated from measurements of tether radius as a function of the static force : B ¼ F o R t = 2 p [ III ] ( iii ) The MCA force can be expressed as adhesion energy per unit area ( g ) . It results from various MCA proteins that connect the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane [ 75 ] and nonspecific binding of the membrane - to - cortex components . It was long believed that MCA was the result of only specific protein – protein interactions , but some experimental findings suggest otherwise . For instance , the fact that tether forces are rapidly reversible with no hysteresis has been used to favor a continuum model with nonspecific binding of the membrane - to - cortex components [ 17 , 24 ] . To separate MCA and T m , we can measure F b , the tether force in the absence of MCA contribution . This can be achieved experi - mentally by performing tether measurements on nascent blebs , which are locally devoid of cytoskeletal support , or on cells in which the cytoskeleton has been depolymerized . Under these conditions , the adhesion term ( g ) equals 0 [ 29 ] , and T m is given by : T m ¼ F 2b = 8B p 2 [ IV ] The adhesion energy can then be calculated using Equation [ I ] and [ IV ] if we assume that T m is constant over smooth regions of the cell surface : g ¼ T (cid:3) T m ¼ ð F 2o = 8B p 2 Þ (cid:3) ð F 2b = 8B p 2 Þ ¼ ð F 2o (cid:3) F 2b Þ = 8B p 2 [ V ] A recent model has related pulling force – velocity profiles to the density of crosslinkers and the lipid bilayer viscosity [ 76 ] , providing a possible means of discriminating the two PM tension components in a wider range of cellular contexts . Experimentally , the tether force in cytoskeletally unsupported regions is typically less than half of that in regions supported by the cytoskeleton ( F b < 0 . 5F o ) . Applying this inequality to Equation [ V ] , we see that over 75 % of the PM tension term is the result of MCA . T m can increase markedly with hypotonic swelling [ 30 , 77 ] . However , under normal conditions , large changes in PM tension are thought to primarily reflect changes in MCA [ 78 ] . Review Trends in Cell Biology February 2013 , Vol . 23 , No . 2 49 over long range to spatially and temporally regulate cell polarity and cell migration [ 23 , 29 , 34 ] . Membrane tension antagonizes actin - based protrusion by being the barrier that growing actin ﬁlaments ﬁght to protrude the mem - brane [ 23 ] and contractility opposes protrusion by pulling actin ﬁlaments away from the membrane [ 35 ] . The relative contribution of cytoskeletal versus membrane tension is likely to vary in different cell types . In Dictyostelium , contractility plays an important role in restricting signals to the leading edge . Upon deletion of myosin 2 , cytoskeletal tension is reduced dramatically [ 36 ] and there is an increase in lateral pseudopod number [ 37 ] and in Ras activation [ 38 ] . These data support a predominant role of contractility in Dictyostelium polarity , but whether PM tension also plays a signiﬁcant role remains unknown . In ﬁbroblasts , a combination of cytoskeletal and mem - brane tension limits cell protrusion . Increasing membrane tension by hypo - osmotic shock halts spreading , whereas decreasing it by adding lipids increases the rate of cell spreading , enhances lamellipodial extension , and tran - siently causes uniform spreading [ 5 ] . Decreasing contrac - tility through myosin inhibition causes faster spreading and a larger ﬁnal spread area [ 35 ] , and increasing it with biaxial cellular stretching downregulates Rac activity [ 39 ] . In ﬁsh keratocytes , decreasing contractility through myosin inhibition does not destroy keratocyte polarity and only slightly reduces migration speed , suggesting a predominant role for PM tension in this system [ 23 , 40 ] . In neutrophils , membrane tension also appears to be the dominant inhibitory mechanism for cell polarization . Membrane tension increases during neutrophil protrusion and decreasing membrane tension through hypo - osmotic shock results in the expansion of leading - edge signals and loss of polarity [ 6 ] . Decreasing cytoskeletal tension with myosin inhibition has no effect on leading - edge signals [ 6 ] . To what extent myosin inhibition , osmotic shock , or other tension perturbations affect both membrane tension and contractility remains unknown . Moreover , it is likely that cytoskeletal and membrane tension are interdepen - dent ; myosin 2 activity is required to reduce PM tension at the end of spreading [ 20 ] , and its inhibition increases PM tension in resting neutrophils [ 6 ] . Finally , it is important to note that these conclusions ( along with most other investigations of cytoskeletal ten - sion ) rely on myosin inhibition , but it is also possible that ﬁlament disassembly - based changes in cytoskeletal ten - sion could contribute to cell polarity and movement in the absence of myosin activity . Sensing PM tension The molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and re - spond to mechanical signals are not fully understood . Processes that lower membrane tension and occur when it is too high Exocytosis ( increasing ‘A’ and aﬀec(cid:3)ng ‘k’ ) Caveolae dissassembly ( increasing ‘A’ ) Stalling of the ac(cid:3)n network Increases in contrac(cid:3)lity ( decrease in ‘A’ ) Endocytosis ( decreasing ‘A’ and aﬀec(cid:3)ng ‘k’ ) Caveolae assembly ( decreasing ‘A’ ) Increase in ac(cid:3)n polimeriza(cid:3)on ( increasing ‘A’ ) Decreases in contrac(cid:3)lity ( increase in ‘A’ ) Processes that increase membrane tension and occur when it is too low Feedback between PM tension and cellular processes T = Tm + γ ; with Tm = k ( Δ A / A ) TRENDS in Cell Biology Figure 1 . Feedback between plasma membrane ( PM ) tension and cellular processes . Examples of cellular processes that occur when PM tension is too high and that lead to its reduction ( left ) or that occur when PM tension is too low and lead to its increase ( right ) – vesicle trafficking , caveola formation , actin polymerization , and changes in myosin . In brackets we comment on the parameters of Equations [ I ] and [ II ] in Box 2 that are predicted to change in each of these processes . Review Trends in Cell Biology February 2013 , Vol . 23 , No . 2 50 There are several mechanisms by which a cell could read PM tension ( Figure 2 ) . Mechanosensitive channels Stretch - activated ion channels are the best understood sensors of PM tension . For these channels , changes in PM tension affect the probability of channel opening . Some examples are found in prokaryotes ( the ion channel MscL ) [ 41 ] , primary osteoblasts [ 42 ] , and specialized sensory cells [ 43 ] . Mechanosensitive channels can sense membrane ten - sion over a wide dynamic range . The magnitude of tension sensing varies from signals barely above the thermal noise in hair cells [ 43 ] to a set point for activation near the lytic tension of the bilayer for MscL [ 41 ] . Perturbation of the ion gradients across the PM and the inﬂux / efﬂux of water can also dramatically increase / de - crease PM tension . Osmotic changes have been used to manipulate PM tension [ 6 , 20 , 21 , 30 ] , but whether cells use this mechanism to change membrane tension remains to be seen . Curvature - sensing proteins Numerous proteins have domains ( like BAR or ALPS domains ) that associate with curved membranes , either because they are sensitive to curvature or because they induce curvature ( or both ) ( reviewed in [ 44 ] ) . High PM tension could reduce the binding of I - BAR proteins by limiting the membrane bending that is necessary for their binding to the membrane [ 45 ] . In this manner , the many GEFs and GAPs with curvature - sensing domains could regulate GTPases in a tension - dependent manner [ 46 ] . Indeed , ArfGAP1 , which contains an ALPS domain , has a preference for positively curved membranes ( like those generated during vesicle formation ) or areas with dis - rupted packing of lipids . ArfGAP1 preferentially induces hydrolysis of the GTP of Arf in these regions [ 47 , 48 ] . High curvature could be both sensed and generated at the leading edge through the action of individual proteins such as amphiphysin I ( BAR domain - containing effector in cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis ) , whose density on the mem - brane determines whether it senses or induces curvature [ 49 ] . Additionally , the activation of N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization by proteins containing an F - BAR domain depends on membrane curvature [ 50 ] . This sug - gests the possibility of feedback between curvature and actin dynamics [ 51 ] : curvature - sensing / inducing proteins could stimulate actin polymerization in a curvature - depen - dent manner , and actin polymerization could decrease curvature to maintain homeostasis . MCA proteins MCA proteins , which provide links between the PM and the actin cytoskeleton , could also sense PM tension . External forces have been found to modulate the activity Res(cid:3)ng PM tension PM under tension ( migra(cid:3)on , spreading ) Sensing PM tension Curvature sensing proteins Mechanosensi(cid:3)ve channels Membrane to cortex a(cid:5)achment proteins TRENDS in Cell Biology Figure 2 . Sensing membrane tension . Plasma membrane ( PM ) in a resting cell ( left ) or following an increase in PM tension , as observed during cell protrusion or cell spreading ( right ) . PM tension could be sensed by the opening of stretch - activated ion channels ( top ) , the dissociation of curvature - sensitive membrane - binding proteins ( middle ) , or changes in the activity of membrane - to - cortex attachment ( MCA ) proteins ( bottom ) . Review Trends in Cell Biology February 2013 , Vol . 23 , No . 2 51 of some MCA proteins . Candidates include ﬁlamin [ 52 ] and the myosin 1 family of single - headed and membrane - associated myosins [ 53 ] , both of which can interact si - multaneously with the cytoskeleton and the PM . Filamin A is a central mechanotransduction element of the cyto - skeleton that interacts with FilGAP , a GTPase - activat - ing protein speciﬁc for Rac ; the loss of this interaction due to high stresses increases Rac activation and actin polymerization [ 54 ] . Myosin 1c is an MCA protein that dynamically provides tension to sensitize mechanosensi - tive ion channels responsible for hearing [ 55 ] . Myosin 1b dramatically alters its motile properties in response to external force ; the rate of myosin 1b detachment from actin decreases 75 - fold under forces of 2 pN or less [ 56 ] ) . This suggests a potential mechanism that remains to be tested : if sensation of PM tension decreases MCA protein activity , it could also generate a homeostatic feedback loop . Global versus local membrane tension Asymmetries in contractility are sufﬁcient to polarize both protrusion and adhesion . [ 57 ] . Are there also inhomoge - neities in membrane tension , and if so are they function - ally relevant ? Membrane lipids ﬂow like a liquid and can almost instantaneously equilibrate T m across the cell [ 40 ] . The lack of large - scale ﬂows has been interpreted as indicating uniform PM tension in several cell lines , includ - ing keratocytes [ 23 ] . However , lack of ﬂow could also be achieved by the presence of local barriers that limit lipid movement , which are known to exist , at least over short timescales [ 58 ] . Interestingly , PM tension is inhomoge - neous in epithelia and neurons [ 21 , 24 , 30 , 31 ] ( reviewed in [ 4 ] ) . For these cells , it was observed that T m is homoge - neous across a cell , and only the MCA component differs between different membrane compartments . Is this al - ways the case ? A septin ring has been observed in T lymphocyte migration [ 59 ] ; if the ring provides a lipid diffusion barrier , it could enable transient differences in PM tension in immune cells during movement . MCA and T m can be distinguished by different means ( Box 1 ) , and future studies should assess the sources and prevalence of PM tension inhomogeneity . It is important to note that even uniform membrane tension could orchestrate the initiation and maintenance of cell polarity if it opposes cytoskeletal protrusions that are locally regulated ( in which protrusions grow until they generate enough ten - sion that enables some protrusions to survive and all others to be extinguished ) . Future directions There are many open questions regarding membrane tension . Do cells have a set point for PM tension ? If so , how is it maintained ? Does membrane tension regulation differ for isolated cells versus cells in a tissue ? How do motile cells interpret changes in PM tension ? How do cytoskeletal tension and PM tension interrelate ? Further research will be necessary to determine which signaling currencies are altered by changes in PM tension and to clarify how membrane tension contributes to and is affect - ed by endocytosis , exocytosis , actin dynamics , and myosin activity .
