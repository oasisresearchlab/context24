Dustin , 2 , 3 Adam Mor 1 , 2 , 4 * The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G , an activator of Rap1 . Subsequently , Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA - 1 , which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) . The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and educa - tion . The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse . It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters ( c - SMACs ) and peripheral SMACs ( p - SMACs ) . Through total internalreflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopyand experiments with supported lipid bilayers , we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p - SMAC . C3G and the active ( dephosphorylated ) form of CrkII also localized to the same compart - ment . In contrast , inactive ( phosphorylated ) CrkII was confined to the c - SMAC . Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c - SMAC to the p - SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP - 1 , which acted downstream of the T cell receptor . In the p - SMAC , CrkII recruited C3G , which led to Rap1 activation and LFA - 1 – mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs . Functionally , SHP - 1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells . Together , these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP - 1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological synapse . INTRODUCTION T lymphocytes are central to the adaptive immune response in both beneficialandharmful settings ( 1 , 2 ) . Adhesionisanessentialaspectof T cell biology ; without proper adhesion , T cells can neither traffic to appropriatecompartmentsnor recognizeantigens presented onmajor histocompatibility complexes ( 3 ) . Effective T cell adhesion is also essen - tial for autoimmunity , suggesting that adhesive function may be a target for treating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , and psoriasis ( 3 ) . However , the potential for therapeutically ameliorating auto - immune conditions by modulating T cell adhesion has thus far been limitedbyadverseevents ( 3 ) . Toidentifymoreselectiveadhesioncontrol points , it is imperative to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating T cell adhesion ( 4 – 6 ) . The integrin LFA - 1 is a critical adhesion molecule for T cell inter - actionswithantigen - presentingcells ( APCs ) ( 7 ) . TheaffinityofLFA - 1for its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule – 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) varies with acti - vation state and is determined by the small guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) Ras - related protein 1 ( Rap1 ) ( 8 ) and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( 9 ) . The ability of Rap1 to control the affinity of LFA - 1 for ICAM - 1 , and thus T cell adhesion , is well established , although the pathway connecting the T cell receptor ( TCR ) and Rap1 is incompletely elucidated ( 10 ) . The adaptor protein CrkII ( chicken tumor virus regulator of kinase II ) is a key regulator of T cell adhesion through the recruitment of a Rap1 guanine nucleotide ex - change factor ( GEF ) , C3G [ Crk SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) domain binding guanine nucleotide – releasing factor ] . How CrkII is phosphorylated downstream of the TCR and the subcellular localization of C3G in the immunological synapse are not clear . The physiological relevance of Rap1 is evident in patients suffering from a congenital defect in Kindlin - 3 , which is required for proper Rap1 signaling ( 11 , 12 ) . Such patients manifest leukocyte adhesion de - ficiency type III syndrome , an immunodeficiency and blood clotting disorder ( 13 ) . Rap1 cycles between active [ guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) – bound ] and inactive [ guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) – bound ] conformations ( 8 , 14 ) . As for all small GTPases , Rap1 activation is regulated by GEFs that cause Rap1 to release GDP in favor of GTP and by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAP ) that enhance the slow intrin - sic GTPase reaction ( 8 , 15 ) . One important Rap1 GEF , C3G , is highly abundant in T lymphocytes ( 16 , 17 ) . The C terminus of C3G consists of the CDC25 homology domain , which is the catalytic domain of members of the Ras family . The N - terminal region of C3G inhibits its GEF activity . Secondary to TCR signaling , C3G translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane ( 18 ) and becomes phosphorylated on Tyr 504 ( 16 ) , and then , the inhibition mediated by its N - terminal region is repressed to increase GEF activity . The adaptor protein CrkII is essential for C3G function ( 16 ) . CrkII isinvolvedinthe early steps oflymphocyte activationthroughits SH2 - mediated interaction with TCR - proximal signaling proteins , such as Casitas B - lineage lymphoma proto - oncogene ( Cbl ) , z chain of TCR - associated protein kinase 70 ( Zap70 ) , Crk - associated substrate - related protein ( CasL ) , and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( STAT5 ) ( 19 ) . In addition , CrkII constitutively associates through its SH3 domain with C3G . Studies demonstrated that the conformation and function of CrkII are subjected to regulation by immunophilins ( 20 ) , which also affect CrkII - dependent T cell adhesion and migration ( 21 ) . Through experiments with conditional knockout mice , Huang et al . reported that T cells lacking CrkII exhibit reduced integrin - mediated adhesion and chemotaxis ( 22 ) . The authors also determined that CrkII coordinated C3G to activate Rap1 ( 22 ) .

The immunological synapse describes stable , antigen - specific ad - hesive junctions formed between T cells and APCs , which may include well - organized supramolecular activation clusters ( SMACs ) ( 23 ) . SMACs comprise concentric rings that contain segregated clusters of proteins driven by TCR signaling . The central SMAC ( c - SMAC ) is enriched in costimulatory receptors , such as CD28 ; the peripheral SMAC ( p - SMAC ) isenrichedinLFA - 1 – ICAM - 1 interactions ; andthe distal SMAC ( d - SMAC ) isenrichedinF - actinand the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 ( 24 ) . These structures are found at the interface between two cells ( such as an APC and a T cell ) and can be modeled with a supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) that contains proteins that diffuse within the bilayer to mimic the membrane of the APC . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy is ideal for high - contrast imaging of fluorescently tagged molecules involved in immunological synapse formation in the SLB system . In experiments with single ac - tivated T cells , our group and others have reported that the activated pool of Rap1 decorates both the plasma membrane and the vesicular compartments ( 18 , 25 , 26 ) . However , the distribution of Rap1 within different compartments of the immunological synapse , its interaction with TCR - proximal signaling components in this setting , and its functions and contribution to productive synapses are unknown . The main aim of this work was to uncover the biology of Rap1 in the immunological synapse . Using TIRF microscopy , we discovered that both Rap1 and the exchange factor C3G were localized to the p - SMAC . Moreover , we showedthat dephosphorylation of the adaptor protein CrkII downstream of stimulation of the TCR was required for C3G activity and subsequent Rap1 activation . Furthermore , de - phosphorylation of CrkII was mediated by the phosphatase SHP - 1 and contributed to multiple T cell functions , including adhesion , migra - tion , and cytokine secretion . RESULTS Activated Rap1 is recruited to the immunological synapse We and others ( 8 ) showed that stimulation of the TCR with an anti - CD3 antibody resulted in the activation of Rap1 at the plasma mem - brane ( 14 , 25 – 27 ) . One of the main characteristics of immunological synapse formation is polarization and recruitment of TCR - proximal signaling proteins toward the contact area . A studyby Cote etal . docu - mented the recruitment of Rap1 to the immunological synapse in fixed cells , but whether this pool of Rap1 is activated ( GTP - bound ) is not clear ( 26 ) . To find out where in the cell Rap1 is activated during immunological synapse formation , we used Jurkat cells expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – tagged RalGDS - RBD [ Ras - binding domain ( RBD ) of the protein Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator ( RalGDS ) ; a probe for activated Rap1 ] cocultured with Raji cells ( a B cell line that acts as APCs ) preloaded with Staphylococcus enterotoxin E ( SEE ) . Rap1 activation in live cells was limited to the contact area between the cells in 82 % of the stable conjugates ( Fig . 1A , bottom ) . Polarized Rap1 recruitment was specific to cells stimulated through the TCR because Rap1 was recruited to the contact area in the absence of SEE in only 16 % of cells that formed stable conjugates ( Fig . 1A , top , and fig . S1 ) . Because antibody - mediated stimulation of cells has limited physi - ological relevance , we confirmed the recruitment of GTP - loaded Rap1 to the immunological synapse in experiments in which we activated T cells with natural ligands found on APCs . Specifically , we cocultured OT - II T cells ( 26 ) expressing GFP - RalGDS - RBD with dendritic cells ( DCs ) loaded with ovalbumin ( OVA ) peptide . Activated Rap1 was enriched in the contact area of 65 % of the cells stimulated through the TCR ( Fig . 1B ) , suggesting that Rap1 activation occurs at the immunological synapse of primary murine T cells . To resolve the distribution of Rap1 in the immunological synapse , we used the SLB model and TIRF microscopy ( fig . S2 ) . When primary human T cells were added to a bilayer containing anti - CD3 antibody and recombinant ICAM - 1 , Rap1 was excluded from the c - SMAC in synapse at both early ( 5 min ) and late ( 20 min ) times ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . To show that this exclusion was not secondary to physical retraction , we used a modified version of GFP ( GFP - CAAX ) that was tethered to the plasma membrane and showed that it was present in both the c - SMACand thep - SMAC ( fig . S3 ) . The closelyrelated GTPase Ras ( 17 ) was not excluded from the c - SMAC ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . Furthermore , whereas the pool of activated ( GTP - loaded ) Rap1 was also excluded from the c - SMAC , GTP - loaded Ras showed marked accumulation in the c - SMAC ( Fig . 1 , C and E ) . Thus , activated Rap1 appeared to be polarized to the cell - cell contact area during synapse formation . The factors regulating Rap1 localization in the immunological synapse are analyzed The ability of Rap1 to interact with lipid membranes is by virtue of the attachment of a geranylgeranyl lipid to its hypervariable region as well as by the affinity of its adjacent positively charged sequence to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane ( 28 – 30 ) . When we expressed a variant of Rap1 in which the 20 - carbon geranylgeranyl lipid tail was replaced by the 15 - carbon prenyl group of Ras ( by changing the CAAX domain in the hypervariable region into CVVM ) ( fig . S4 ) , Rap1 lost its distinct distribution and was no longer excluded from the c - SMAC ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , suggesting that the 20 - carbon , but not the 15 - carbon , tail of Rap1 was required for its compartmentali - zation within the immunological synapse . Previously , we showed that Rap1 is localized to the plasma mem - brane ( 18 ) . Here , in experiments with the RalGDS - RBD probe , we demonstratedthatthispool ofRap1 was GTP - loaded ( Fig . 1 ) . Toiden - tify whether the activation status of Rap1 contributed to its localiza - tion in the immunological synapse , we overexpressed activated ( Rap1 G12V ) and inactivated ( Rap1 S17N ) variants of Rap1 in primary human T cells . We found that , despite the variants being present in similar amounts ( fig . S5 ) , the activated pool of Rap1 was excluded from the c - SMAC , whereas the inactivated pool of Rap1 failed to dec - orate any part of the immunological synapse ( Fig . 2 , A and C ) . This finding suggests that despite the presence of a plasma membrane pool of inactivated Rap1 ( GFP - Rap1 and GFP - RalGDS - RBD did not share the same subcellular distribution inactivated cells ) , the pool ofRap1 in the immunological synapse is exclusively GTP - loaded . It is appreciated that the subcellular localization of multiple small GTPases is determined by the distribution of their specific GEFs and GAPs ( 15 , 31 ) . We found that the major GEF for Rap1 in T cells , C3G [ either wild - type C3G or the activated variant ( C3G Y504D ) ] , was also excluded from the c - SMAC ( Fig . 2 , A and D ) . This property was particular to C3G because another Rap1 GEF , CalDAG - GEFIII ( 15 , 32 ) , failed to show a similar distribution ( Fig . 2 , A and D ) . Whereas it is not surprising that C3G was local - ized to the immunological synapse , why it ( unlike other GEFs ) was excluded from the c - SMAC is unclear . Thus , multiple processes , such as lipidation , activation , and the presence of specific GEFs , S C I E N C E S I G N A L I N G | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Azoulay - Alfaguter et al . , Sci .

CrkII phosphorylation is required for its proper localization in the immunological synapse CrkIIisanadaptorproteinthatbindstoseveraltyrosine - phosphorylated proteins and is required for proper localization of the GEF C3G ( 20 , 21 , 33 , 34 ) . Nath etal . foundthatbindingbetweentheseproteins and subsequent T cell adhesions were dependent on the peptidyl – prolyl isomerase immunophilins ( 20 ) . We validated the ability of dephosphorylated CrkII to interact with C3G ( fig . S6 , A and B ) . Upon phosphorylation , CrkII folds on itself to cover its SH2 - and SH3 - binding sites and thus becomes inactive ( Fig . 3A ) ( 21 , 35 ) . Whereas the phosphodeficient ( active ) variant of CrkII ( CrkII Y221A ) was found at the same location as C3G ( Figs . 2A and 3B ) and Rap1 ( Fig . 2C ) , the phosphomimetic ( inactive ) variant of CrkII ( CrkII Y221D ) was restricted to the c - SMAC in primary human T cells ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . To further support this finding and to validate that wild - type CrkII translocated between different compartments of the immunological synapse in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation state , we treated cells expressing CrkII with pervanadate , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( 36 ) , and analyzed the distribution of CrkII ( Fig . 3D ) . Despite the treatment with pervanadate leading to the phosphorylation of multiple proteins , we used a specific antibody to confirm that CrkII was among them and that its phosphorylation occurred at position 221 ( fig . S7 , A and B ) . We found that within 10 min of treating the cells with pervanadate , CrkII redeployed from the p - SMAC to the c - SMAC in most of the cells , presumably after it became phosphorylated at position 221 ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Together , these data suggest that dephosphorylated CrkII travels to the periphery of the immunological synapse , where it likely acts on its effector , C3G . CrkII dephosphorylation leads to T cell activation An important aim in our search to identify signaling molecules upstream of CrkII was to uncover the mechanism by which CrkII is dephosphorylated before its relocation to the p - SMAC . Given that CrkII is also a cytosolic protein , we first demonstrated that there was an increase in the amount of CrkII in the plasma membrane fraction upon TCR stimulation ( fig . S8 , A and B ) . The same treatment also resulted in a reduction in the amount of phosphorylated CrkII at two different times ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) .

This fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) – based construct was designed to report the folding status of CrkII ( 37 ) . We detected a reduc - tion in FRET efficiency upon stimulation of transiently transfected Jurkat cells through the TCR ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) , suggesting that engage - ment of the TCR resulted in the dephosphorylation of CrkII . To show that CrkII dephosphorylation was associated with increased adhesion , we expressed phosphodeficient or phosphomimetic variants of CrkII in T cells and demonstrated that only the former resulted in an increased amount of GTP - Rap1 and the increased adhesion of the cells to ICAM - 1 – coated surfaces ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . To confirm that CrkII Y221D was folded properly , we expressed phosphomimetic and phosphodefi - cientvariantsofthePICCHUxconstruct ( YFP - CrkII Y221D - CFP - CAAX and YFP - CrkII Y221A - CFP - CAAX , respectively ) in Jurkat cells and detected high FRET efficiency in cells expressing the latter construct ( fig . S9 , A to C ) . To demonstrate the contribution of phosphodeficient ( active ) CrkII to cellular functions , we expressed CrkII Y221A in T cells and stimulated them with anti - CD3 antibody in wells coated with ICAM - 1 ( to mimic the immunological synapse environment ) ( 38 ) and found that they had an increase in the amount of the cell surface activation marker CD69 ( Fig . 4G ) . CrkII Y221A also enhanced the amount of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) secreted by the cells stimulated in the same manner ( Fig . 4H ) ( 8 , 39 , 40 ) . These findings suggest that stimulation ofthe TCR leads to the dephosphorylation ofCrkII , which is associated with increased adhesion to ICAM - 1 , cellular activation , and IL - 2 secretion . SHP - 1 dephosphorylates CrkII in response to TCR stimulation To uncover the signaling events between stimulation of the TCR and CrkIIdephosphorylation , wetreated Jurkatcells with two phosphatase inhibitors , the nonspecific SHP - 1 / 2 inhibitor NSC - 87877 ( 41 ) and the PP2 inhibitor cantharidic acid ( 5 , 42 ) , and then measured the amount of phosphorylated CrkII in the cells upon treatment with anti - CD3 antibody . We found that only treatment with NSC - 87877 resulted in the generation of increased amounts of phosphorylated CrkII ( Fig . 5A ) . The same treatment also resulted in the reduced adhesion of anti - CD3 antibody – treated cells to ICAM - 1 – coated wells ( Fig . 5B ) . This inhibition was blocked by overexpressing a phosphodeficient CrkII variant ( CrkII Y221A ) , which suggests that at least one of the targets for SHP - 1 or SHP - 2 is the adaptor protein CrkII ( Fig . 5B ) .

We knocked down each isoform individually ( Fig . 5C and fig . S10 ) and then measured the abundance of phosphorylated CrkII . Whereas the amount of phosphorylated CrkII was unchanged , or decreased , in wild - type cells ( scramble ) , upon knockdown of SHP - 1 or SHP - 2 , there was a marked increase in CrkII phosphorylation after TCR stimulation ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) . Disruption of tonicCrkIIphosphorylation , as governed by additional kinases and their corresponding positive and negative feedback loops , might also have contributed to CrkII function . The extent of the increase in CrkII phosphorylation was more substantial when SHP - 1 was knocked down ( Fig . 5E ) . Moreover , knocking down SHP - 1 inhibited TCR - stimulated static adhesion ( 45 ) to ICAM - 1 in Jurkat cells expressing the relevant short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) ( Fig . 5F ) and primary human T cells treated with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) ( Fig . 5G ) . To confirm that the contribution of SHP - 1 to adhesion was not compensated for by SHP - 2 signaling , we knocked down SHP - 1 alone or together with SHP - 2 and found that adhesion to ICAM - 1 was reduced to the same extent ( Fig . 5G ) . To rule out off - target effects of our inhibitory RNAs , we rescued the adhesion defect of the cells by overexpressing SHP - 1 ( Fig . 5H ) . Moreover , the phosphodeficient CrkII variant ( CrkII Y221A ) also rescued this adhesion defect , suggest - ing that T cell adhesion is mediated specifically through CrkII dephosphorylation by SHP - 1 ( Fig . 5H ) . The contribution of SHP - 1 to TCR signaling was also demonstrated by a chemokinesis assay ( 46 ) , which showed that primary human T cells deficient in SHP - 1 failed to arrest in response to TCR cross - linking ( Fig . 5I ) . Using conjugate formation assays , we demonstrated that SHP - 1 was required for the activation and recruitment of Rap1 to the contact area of Jurkat cells ( Fig . 5J ) and primary human T cells cocultured with APCs ( Fig . 5K ) . Moreover , SHP - 1 was also required for stable conjugate formation ( Fig . 5L ) . Together , our results suggest that CrkII is targeted by SHP - 1 upon TCR stimulation and that SHP - 1 is required for Rap1 activation and T cell adhesion downstream of the TCR . DISCUSSION Previous work showed that the activation of Rap1 in response to TCR stimulation ismediated primarilyby the exchange factor C3G ( 40 , 47 ) . C3G was the first Rap1 GEF identified , and it is highly abundant in T lymphocytes . C3G transduces signals from Crk proteins , binding to their SH3 domains and activating mainly Rap1 ( and , to a lesser extent , other membersofthe Ras family ofGTPases ) . The recruitment ofC3G to the plasma membrane is facilitated by several adaptor proteins , including CrkII , CrkL , and CasL ( 48 , 49 ) . Unlike C3G , which is restricted to the p - SMAC , CrkII translocates from the p - SMAC to the c - SMAC upon phosphorylation ( Fig . 6 ) . Compartmentalization of signaling molecules to different areas of the immunological synapse based on their phosphorylation state has been reported previously . Campi et al . reported that phosphorylated TCR clusters move to the c - SMAC ( 50 ) , and Purbhoo et al . discovered that phosphorylated LAT clusters and vesicles move centripetally toward the c - SMAC during immunological synapse formation ( 51 , 52 ) . Analogously , we showed here that the phosphorylation state of CrkII Fig . 3 . CrkII phosphorylation is required for its proper localization in the immunological synapse .

However , the direction of its trafficking was not toward but rather away from the center of the synapse . Moreover , the localization of CrkII is also associated with multiple T cell functions , including adhesion and cytokine secretion . This is an exam - pleofhowthesubcellularlocalizationofanadaptorproteincanregulatedownstreamsignaling ( 51 , 53 ) . An additional level of CrkII regulation was demonstrated by pre - vious studies showing an important role for its proline - rich domain and its ability to alter CrkII from a cis ( inactive ) to a trans ( active ) conformation ( 54 , 55 ) . In this regard , the previous studies showed that the binding of CrkII to C3G was enhanced by the activity of prolyl isomerases ( 20 , 56 , 57 ) . The contribution of CrkII isomerization to its localization at different compartments of the immunological syn - apse is not clear . The mechanism underlying the retention of dephosphorylated CrkII at the p - SMAC remains unclear . Previous reports showed that the adaptor protein CasL is limited to the same compartment ( 49 , 58 ) . We confirmed that CrkII and CasL physically interact with each other ( fig . S11 , A and B ) , which suggests that CasL might serve as a docking site to retain CrkII in the periphery of the synapse , where it can signal downstream to Rap1 and LFA - 1 ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast to CrkII , the TCR complex travels to the center of the immunological synapse upon stimulation and during the maturation process . Whereas CrkII trafficking is regulated by dephosphorylation and possibly by its binding to CasL , the contribution of Rap1 and Ras signaling to TCR trafficking remains incompletely understood . Choudhuri et al . reported that polarized vesicles enriched in TCR complexes emerge from the center of the immunological synapse ( 59 ) . Whether these vesicles are also enriched with activated Rap1 or Ras proteins is under active investigation in our laboratory . Tyrosine phosphorylation ( and dephosphorylation ) of proteins plays a critical role in many T cell functions ( 43 ) . The opposing actions of kinases and phosphatases determine the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation at any given time ( 60 , 61 ) . It is well appreciated that kinases are essential during T cell signaling to promote adhesion . Nolz et al . demonstrated that although the kinase Abl does not regulate the recruitment of C3G to the immunological synapse , it affects the phosphorylation of C3G itself , which is required for its GEF activity toward Rap1 ( 40 ) . The role and importance of phosphatases to T cell functions are less well appreciated ( 43 ) . Specifically , the roles of the phosphatases SHP - 1 and SHP - 2 in T cells are not clear be - cause of numerous opposing reports showing that SHP - 2 activity is related to activating pathways ( 62 ) , whereas SHP - 1 is associated with the inhibition of selected T cell functions ( 43 ) . Analogous to the mechanism by which the phosphatase CD45 activates Lck , our data suggest that SHP - 1 targets CrkII upon TCR stimulation , leading to the recruitment of C3G to the plasma membrane and the Rap1 - dependent activation of LFA - 1 at the immunological syn - apse ( Fig . 6 ) . Thus , our study reveals a previously uncharacterized function for SHP - 1 in integrin - mediated adhesion downstream of TCR stimulation . 0 20 40 60 80 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0 10 20 30 40 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 Fig . 4 .

Whereas activatedRaswaslimitedtothec - SMAC , GTP - loadedRap1wasexcluded from the same compartment . We hypothesize that this is secondary to the differences in the sequences of the hypervariable regions of these GTPases , leading to diverse posttranslational modifications that ulti - mately support affinity for either the p - SMAC or the c - SMAC . Ongoing experiments in our laboratory will clarify these findings . An observation that was not addressed in this work is the distinct pattern of distribution of CrkII and C3G .

Signal . 10 , eaal2880 ( 2017 ) 8 August 2017 7 of 11 tightly clustered organization ( Figs . 2A and 3B ) within the immu - nological synapse . These clusters resemble talin microclusters ( 63 ) , suggesting a possible interaction with the actin cytoskeleton ( 9 , 64 ) or with other actin regulatory proteins , such as Wiskott - Aldrich syn - dromeprotein ( WASP ) ( 65 , 66 ) , Srckinase – associatedphosphoprotein ( SKAP ) ( 67 , 68 ) , regulator for cell adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissue ( RapL ) ( 14 ) , Rap1 - interacting adaptor molecule ( RIAM ) ( 15 , 69 ) , orWiskott - Aldrichsyndromeproteinfamilymember 2 ( WASF2 ) ( 40 ) . The role of the actin cytoskeleton and these proteins in the dynamics of CrkII trafficking will be a subject for future studies . Specifically , it was reported that the protein SLAT is crucial for the TCR - induced activation of LFA - 1 and T cell adhesion ( 26 ) . SLAT interacts , through its PH domain , with activated Rap1 . This interaction facilitates the recruitment of Rap1 and SLAT to the immunological synapse ( 26 ) . Thus , the distribution of SLAT within different compart - ments of the synapse is of interest . Together , our data show a previously uncharacterized regulatory pathway leading to T cell adhesion . TCR activation induced the de - phosphorylation of plasma membrane – bound CrkII by SHP - 1 . The dephosphorylated CrkII protein translocated to the p - SMAC , where it interacted with C3G , which activated Rap1 . Thus , we position CrkII andSHP - 1 ascritical playersinimmunologicalsynapse formationand suggest that CrkII phosphorylation might be therapeutically manipu - lated to treat inflammatory diseases .

ModelforthelocalizationandfunctionofCrkIIwithintheimmunological synapse . Stimulation of the TCR leads to the SHP - 1 – mediated dephosphorylation of CrkII , which then travels from the c - SMAC to the p - SMAC . Here , CrkII binds to the exchange factor C3G , which directly activates Rap1 , leading to LFA - 1 activation and enhanced T cell adhesion .

OT - II Tcells expressing a transgenic TCR thatrecognizes OVA were isolated from single - cell suspensions from the spleens of DO11 . 10 mice by depletion of magnetically labeled non - CD3 cells ( Invitrogen ) . To isolate APCs , spleen suspensions were prepared by digestion with collagenase D ( 100 U / ml ) in Hanks ’ balanced salt solu - tion for 40 min . Low - density cells were isolated by centrifugation over a 60 % Percoll gradient . Cells were further enriched by differential ad - herence by incubating the cells on 100 - mm tissue culture plates in me - dium containing 5 % FBS for 2 hours with OVA peptide ( 100 m g / ml ) . Lipid bilayer experiments Lipid bilayers were prepared as previously described ( 72 ) . Liposomes containingbiotin - CAP - phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylcholine , and Ni 2 + - chelating lipids ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) were placed on 40 - mm glass coverslipscleanedwith Piranhasolution ( CyantekCorporation ) to form the planar bilayers .
