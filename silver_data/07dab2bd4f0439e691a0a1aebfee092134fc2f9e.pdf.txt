78 © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 The Use of Design in Business Strategy : What’s Beneath the Surface ? Guilherme Fowler A . Monteiro Design knowledge has proven to be useful in areas as diverse as engineering , medicine , and communications . The reason is that design can be conceived as an assessment of “how things could be , ” which reveals its innate tendency to focus on the future while seeking to put systems , products , and services into a prospective context . 1 The same is true for business strategy . The basic function of strategy is to focus on the future while continuously identifying the actions necessary for firms to create and appropriate economic rents . For exactly this reason , strategy scholars have sought design inspiration in recent years . Attempts to bring these two fields closer together have occurred on two fronts . On the one hand , management research has emphasized the role of design in organi - zations . 2 On the other hand , business schools have increasingly incorporated innovation and design programs into their curricula . Despite these efforts , our understanding of the relationship between the two disciplines remains superficial . 3 For a growing number of managers , a good strategy is supposedly one that is designed by heterogeneous groups , preferably in a studio , and one that manifests itself through a creative flash that can only be expressed in colorful sticky notes . The most relevant conclusion so far is that design plays a relevant role in building “more meaning - ful strategies . ” What does this assertion mean , exactly ? The risk we face today is that enthusiasm for thinking about design issues becomes trivialized , thus losing its meaning . 4 The discomfort with this risk stems from the fact that relevant dimensions of design seem to be deliberately set aside to make the practice of design more acceptable to managers . 5 What the debate lacks is a deeper understanding of how design and strategy can be effectively connected beyond the usual claim that design thinking is a key component of innovation in business . Starting from this fundamental question of their connection , I sketch in this article the broad contours of a more theoretically grounded dialogue between the fields of design and https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1162 / desi _ a _ 00649 1 Hebert Simon , The Sciences of the Artificial ( Cambridge , MA : MIT Press , 1969 ) . 2 See , e . g . , Tim Brown , “Design Thinking , ” Harvard Business Review 86 ( 2008 ) : 84 – 92 ; Beatrice D’Ippolito , “The Importance of Design for Firms’ Competitiveness : A Review of the Literature , ” Technovation 34 ( 2014 ) : 716 – 30 , https : / / doi . org / http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . technovation . 2014 . 01 . 007 ; Heather M .

My intention is neither to be exhaustive in my investiga - tion , nor to present a complete theory . Instead , my goal is to point out a more consistent path for discussion , thus opening up new possibilities for conversation . Specifically , this article highlights the examination of strategy problems as design problems , the role of paradoxes in strategy thinking , and the nature of design as a strategic meta - capability . The Current Conversation Between Strategy and Design The investigation of the relationship between design and business has been very fruitful in the past few years . 6 Studies linked to this tradition vary widely in terms of methodological perspectives and objects of study . For example , some authors have turned their attention to designers and the design process , trying to identify what is called a design attitude 7 ; others have examined the specific patterns of human interactions within design firms or between design firms and other organizations . 8 Another relevant strand of research has examined design as an organizational resource capa - ble of influencing the performance of firms . 9 Specifically , design activities are said to influence manage - ment and strategy in four main areas . 10 The first recognizes the ability of design to leverage the firm’s positioning by shaping cus - tomer perceptions and experiences—either directly through prod - ucts and services or indirectly through corporate image and brand activities . 11 Second , design enables integration and mediation between professional domains . 12 According to this reasoning , the design of artifacts , experiences , and environments allows employ - ees , partners , rivals , and customers to be introduced to a compa - ny’s strategy . 13 Third , design serves to shape corporate culture and improve knowledge management within firms by means of com - munication design and graphic design . 14 Fourth , design activities at the leadership level help to build a holistic view of complex sys - tems and to create a shared strategic vision . This fourth aspect is the one that I explore more closely in this article . Interestingly , the term “design strategy” does not have a unique understanding in the literature . 15 In some cases , the term refers to long - term planning that focuses primarily on a company’s brand and product attributes . 16 In other cases , “design strategy” is used generically as a reference to the potential of creativity when applied in strategic formulation . 17 However , even with this per - spective , identifying different characterizations is possible : Design can be examined as a method to be coupled with the usual strate - gic management processes 18 ; or it can be seen as a general way of thinking , such that design becomes a metaphor for the elaboration of the strategy—the so - called design thinking approach . 19 79 Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 80 11 Christopher Lorenz , “Harnessing Design as a Strategic Resource , ” Long Range Planning 27 , no . 5 ( October 1994 ) : 73 – 84 , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / 0024 - 6301 ( 94 ) 90229 - 1 . 12 Charles B .

A designer’s way of thinking is expressed in the strategy discourse in different ways . 20 The first form , perhaps the most popular among practitioners , is the conception of design think - ing advanced by Tim Brown from IDEO . 21 The focus is on describ - ing the circular design process and how it can help generate innovative ideas . The second form of expression is design think - ing as a way to address undetermined organizational prob - lems . This aspect is strongly identified with the writings of Roger Martin from the Rotman School of Management . 22 Martin is less concerned with design as a work process ; his emphasis is on design thinking as a set of cognitive characteristics that enable managers to go beyond purely analytical reasoning . Third , some authors examine design thinking as a part of management theory . The main reference for this perspective is the book , Managing as Design . 23 In this edited volume , most contributions explore design situations illustrating how different theoretical frame - works are applied ; yet the work does not formulate a unified theo - retical body . 24 In fact , much of the literature has a “you know a design - based strategy when you see it” flavor . Part of this lack of precision stems from the fact that the discourse on management and strat - egy rarely refers to the theoretical principles already developed in the design literature , thus impairing the cumulative construction of knowledge . 25 What is lacking in the debate is a deeper under - standing of how design and strategy can be effectively connected . To move in this direction , I discuss in the next section the essential theoretical components of design thinking and how they can be broadly associated with strategy . The Building Blocks of a More Meaningful Conversation The main blocks for a more productive dialogue between strategy and design are identified below and include : the meaning of strat - egy , the concept of strategy problems as design problems , the role of paradoxes , and the idea of framework . The Strategic Endeavor Every business strategy aims to chart the path by which a firm is capable of creating and appropriating economic value . In doing this , the strategists generally encounter three materials . The first is the formal material—that is , the basic elements that are available for the development of a strategy . The second is the material given to them—namely , a situation or problem that involves a set of demands from different stakeholders . This material tends to be Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 81 insufficient or vague , so that recreating or reconfiguring the prob - lem is up to the strategists . The third is the psychological material , which comprises the perceptions , emotions , and reactions of the individuals involved in the formulation and implementation of the strategy . Further , the formal material of the strategy is composed of three elements : the firm’s market positioning , the firm’s organiza - tional resources , and the firm’s governance structures . These ele - ments are equivalent to designers’ use of contrast , proportion , shapes and colors . 26 To illustrate , just as graphic designers must think about a problem situation and select a shape that harmo - nizes with a certain color palette , firms must choose a market posi - tioning that finds support in the business model or a governance mechanism that allows resources to be put to their best possible use . The design of the strategy , then , is the configuration of these elements , their influences and developments , and this configura - tion is specific to each firm at each moment in time . Problems Design problems often are characterized as wicked problems . 27 Wicked problems tend to be poorly formulated , feature ambiguous information , and involve many clients and decision makers who most often have conflicting interests . 28 This characterization repre - sents one of the central elements that brings strategy and design closer together . The conditions of “being poorly formulated , ” “fea - turing ambiguous information , ” and “involving many stakehold - ers” apply equally to most problems that firms face . 29 Despite that , many design ( strategy ) projects encompass problem - solving steps that are logical and predictable . 30 These steps arise in situations in which designers already know the value to be expressed in the designed product ( i . e . , object , service , or sys - tem ) , as well as the working principle that connects this thing or product to be created with the thing’s value . What is missing is the thing itself . From a strategic perspective , this kind of “closed prob - lem” is one that many companies face daily . It arises every time a firm is comfortable with its value proposition , its competitive posi - tioning , and its business model . If nothing is wrong with these components , the “working principle” by which the firm creates value is in full operation . In this context , a problem may arise when , for example , a key supplier fails to deliver an input or a competitor hires the top researchers who make up the firm’s R & D team . Such problems are strategic because they involve the real risk that the firm’s ability to create value is shattered , at least in the short term . 22 See Martin , “Design and Business” ; Roger Martin , The Opposable Mind : How Successful Leaders Win Through Integrative Thinking ( Boston , MA : Harvard Business School Press , 2007 ) ; and Roger Martin , The Design of Busi - ness : Why Design Thinking Is the Next Competitive Advantage ( Boston , MA : Harvard Business School Press , 2009 ) . 23 Richard Boland and Fred Collopy , eds . , Managing as Design ( Stanford , CA : Stanford University Press , 2004 ) . 24 Johansson - Sköldberg et al . , “Design Thinking , ” : 129 . 25 Ibid . : 121 . 26 Paul Rand , Thoughts on Design , 4th ed .

Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 82 The most relevant problems in the context of a design / strategy analysis , however , are the wicked problems , which result from breaks in logical and routine circumstances . 31 In this case , the current working principle no longer works . Schön calls these kinds of breaks “surprises”—that is , breaking points in designers’ re - flective conversation with the situation . 32 With these so - called “ill - defined problems , ” the circumstances become complex and uncertain , and articulating the problem itself becomes a problem . 33 For instance , consider the issue of modern urban mobility , with the emergence of self - guided cars and electric vehicles . Car manufac - turers , like all other parties involved , currently face high uncer - tainty . This issue is both a design problem and a strategy problem . How the technology will evolve in the near future is not yet known ; we only know that human mobility in urban spaces will change . Therefore , we can suppose that automakers’ business model will change as well . How will it change ? Nobody knows the answer with certainty ; instead , the business model will be the product of strategic ideas’ being formulated and tested . Creativity , which is a key component of great strategies , manifests itself at exactly these moments of surprise . 34 Creative design involves an iterative process of analysis and refinement , in which problem formulation and idea generation occur simulta - neously and in circular stages . 35 The most interesting consequence within this process is that a real , stable design problem , as such , is not there to be addressed . What exists instead is an unstable pro - cess of formulating problems and generating ideas for solutions . 36 This lacuna is a challenge—and a torment—for the rational mind of most strategists . From a design point of view , there is no speci - fic strategy problem to be solved when dealing with market transformation situations . Strategists instead must enter a circular process of prototyping that involves a coevolution of both the strategy problem and the solution and movement toward a satis - factory outcome . Paradoxes Ill - defined problems are so complicated because designers ( strategists ) know only the projected value ; they do not know the thing to be created , nor the working principle that connects the thing with the value . This type of problem situation arises only when those involved in the design do not know what to do and how to do it . This situation is so disturbing because it involves a paradox . A design ( strategy ) paradox is a complex issue involving two or more conflicting arguments . In the initial stage of the paradox , the arguments that engender it are true or valid , but they cannot be combined . 37 In the case of strategy , consider the issue of 31 It is also interesting to examine the concept of open problems as opposed to the notion of closed problems .

Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 83 urban mobility from the perspective of an automaker : “A great ‘automotive paradox’—where more travel via car than ever , but fewer cars will be needed by individuals—will be a defining qual - ity of the new automotive future . ” 38 Increasingly , consumers living in large urban centers will not want to buy a car but will expect it to be available through , for example , a sharing economy . The paradox plays a central role in design thinking and stra - tegic thinking because it is the trigger for action . Because the para - dox carries with it a contradiction , it is the starting point for redefining the problem situation to move toward a solution . Para - dox thus brings us to the key concept of framework . Framework Designers develop the framing of a problem when they create a new point of view through which the situation can be assessed . The most logical way to structure this type of reasoning is to work recursively 39 and to start with the only known element : the value that is intended to be created . Designers use their perception of the problem situation to support the formulation of a tentative working principle for creating this value . The working principle is the first element of the design framework . The central thesis is the second element . Fundamentally , if designers analyze the problem based on their perception of the situation and their tentative working principle , and from this interaction they construct their central thesis , then the central thesis conveys how the desired value might be created . From a managerial point of view , the concept of this de - sign framework can be linked to the idea of strategy itself . This interpretation echoes the understanding of strategy articulated by Jay Barney , who claims that “a firm’s strategy is its theory of how to achieve high levels of performance in the markets and industries within which it is operating . ” 40 I interpret Barney’s use of “theory” here as the framework just described : a tentative working principle in combination with a central thesis , which indicates how the firm intends to create and appropriate value , thus achieving high levels of performance . Strategy as Design Based on the above description , the starting point of designing a strategy is to become aware of the central strategic paradox in which the company is involved . Because paradoxes are by their nature complex , the firm cannot assess it directly . What the firm must do , then , is investigate the themes within the paradox . There are countless management tools to assist in the task of identifying “relevant themes . ” For example , PESTLE analysis is a 38 David Welch and Joe Ryan , “Ride - Hailing Boom Will Mean Decades of Slow Growth for Carmakers , ” Bloomberg , 2017 , https : / / www . bloomberg . com / news / articles / 2017 - 11 - 14 / ride - hailing - boom - will - mean - decades - of - slow - growth - for - carmakers ( accessed on December 2 , 2019 ) . 39 Dorst , “The Core of ‘Design Thinking . ’” 40 Jay B .

Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 84 tool that companies and entrepreneurs use to map the envi - ronment in which they are operating or planning to operate . The word is an acronym for political , economic , social , technolog - ical , legal , and environmental factors . The PESTLE analysis was formulated to help an organization recognize the opportunities and challenges associated with conditions in the business envi - ronment . As a result , it allows for better organizational planning , especially when used in combination with other techniques . PESTLE does offer a simple , intuitive way to structure planning , but it also presents a risk when managers view it as a mere check - list . The problem here is not the tool but its users . Designers faced with a complex problem situation cannot simply pull out a list of items to consider and check off . They investigate the problem , talk to the parties involved , and look at the situation in different ways and at different times . From this intimate contact with the para - dox , designers take note of the themes that come up spontaneously and then work on a framework . If a firm wants to build a strategy truly founded on design , it should follow a similar path . After the firm has identified the themes , it formulates a strategic framework . First , it defines a tentative working princi - ple—that is , a set of assumptions based on its observation of the problem situation . Second , grounded on these assumptions , the firm defines a central thesis : a causal relationship linking a specific combination of strategy components with its potential generation of economic rents . Third , the firm starts the circular process by which the strategic framework evolves through the firm’s testing , learning , adaptation , retesting , and so on . As Fraser notes , “what is critical is to identify what will strategically drive the success of the solution , prioritize which activities an organization must under - take to deliver those strategies , define the relationship of those parts strategically , operationally and economically , and determine what net impact the new [ business ] model will have . ” 41 Two Principles The mere existence of a design framework for strategy does not mean that the company is destined for success . A framework will never be a guarantee for creating and appropriating supe - rior rents—although its absence can be a serious problem . To be strategically relevant , a framework must meet two general princi - ples . 42 The first principle is associated with internal consistency . The framework must enable a coherent articulation of the formal elements of the strategy : market positioning , organizational resources , and governance structures . The most common way to respond to a lack of internal consistency is to blame top manage - ment . Shareholders , investors , and even employees are generally 41 Fraser , “The Practice of Breakthrough Strategies by Design , ” 17 . 42 Ron Sanchez and Aime Heene , The New Strategic Management : Organization , Competition , and Competence ( New York , NY : John Wiley & Sons , 2004 ) . Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 85 quick to criticize the “ineptitude” and “myopia” of the CEO and other board members . Although this criticism may not be entirely misplaced , it generally ignores the complex dynamics that charac - terize the strategic framework . Because the basic components of the strategy can be influenced by different external forces , main - taining the internal consistency of the framework is an ongoing exercise that requires attention . For example , competitors can influence a firm’s positioning and internal management . In fact , a move by an incumbent—say , when starting a price war—affects the firm’s strategic framework , as does the threat of entry by a new competitor . Suppliers also can affect a firm’s management of its resource base and transactions . Managing external suppliers is dif - ferent in nature from managing internal consistency , but the effects of internal actions cross these boundaries . For example , imagine a situation in which the marketing team launches a new media campaign that is inconsistent with the strategic framework and negatively affects consumers’ perceptions . This internal incon - sistency can weaken the company’s positioning and negatively affect relationships with key suppliers . From a design perspective , the challenge is to rebalance the internal elements of the frame - work—the firm’s market positioning , organizational resources , and governance structures—so that these formal elements of the strategy remain logically consistent . The second principle refers to external consistency . The strategic framework must be connected to the market and provide a clear , plausible rationale for value creation . This principle encom - passes , but should not be confused with , the design idea of user centrality . For a firm to generate economic value , it clearly must deliver to consumers a value proposition that connects with their desires and aspirations . The firm generates value precisely by meeting ( or creating ) a consumer need—which presupposes plac - ing consumers ( or users ) at the center of the creative process . How - ever , value creation also must be plausible in the economic sense , including the market structure within which the firm operates . Entrepreneurs or managers who believe that consumers will spon - taneously form a queue at the door of the company once they have produced a good or service generally fail because they disregard the external consistency of their strategic framework . Design as a Strategic Meta - Capability Although the principles of internal and external consistency can bring strategic relevance to the framework , they are only a nec - essary and not a sufficient condition to sustain a company’s com - petitive advantage . The advantage is temporary if the framework can be imitated—that is , if rivals are able to mimic both the way Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 86 43 Michael E .

This discussion is central to strategy . Harvard Business School profes - sor Michael Porter emphasizes the relevance of barriers to entry , which can prevent competitors from threatening a firm’s position . 43 Jay Barney , another influential author , notes that a firm is able to sustain its competitive advantage when it grounds its business model on resources that are not only valuable but also rare and dif - ficult to imitate . 44 Interestingly , the same line of reasoning can be used to argue that strategy design is , in itself , a valuable resource . More specifically , strategy design is a type of organizational com - petence focused on the internal and external alignment of the for - mal components of strategy . What remains , then , is simply to understand the conditions under which design can be rare and dif - ficult to imitate . As intuitive as this perspective might seem , it brings some difficulties . The issue is proportionality . Saying that strategy design ( i . e . , the building of a strategic framework ) is an organiza - tional competence that comprises the firm’s bundle of resources is like saying , with William Blake , that a world is contained in a grain of sand . Design , defined here as a “world , ” organizes the components of the strategy to create a coherent framework that simultaneously describes and guides strategic action . However , that design also is an organizational competence—that is , a set of processes and activities that allow a company to produce a certain result—is difficult to reject . What seems to be a more coherent approach is to think of strategy design as a meta - capability . 45 It is a meta - capability , or a higher order competence , because it represents a set of skills and knowledge that underlies the process of building new compe - tences . A firm’s knowing how to position itself profitably in a given market , being able to manage the resource base efficiently , and establishing superior governance mechanisms are examples of different organizational competencies . Building these competen - cies is a meta - capability , and strategy design makes this higher order competence possible . Meta - capability can be described in terms of four organiza - tional skills : learning continuously , establishing collaboration between different groups , redesigning processes , and facilitating strategic conversations . 46 The presence of these skills within an organization enables the creation of new competences . And these skills are exactly what design promotes . Faced with an ill - defined problem , the firm embarks on an iterative process of analysis , Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 87 which involves learning throughout each “round” and collabo - rating among the parties involved . In the end , the proposed solution very likely involves a change in the way the processes are carried out , leading to an adjustment in the business model and a change in the firm’s positioning . This change is achieved using a framework that can take the form of a simplified represen - tation , the function of which is to create an understanding ( i . e . , a conversation ) among the involved parties . Because firms differ in their ability to interpret a prob - lem situation and formulate a framework , we expect to see de - sign differences between their strategies . 47 More importantly , a firm creates and appropriates more value relative to its rivals by defining a superior design framework in the face of a given problem situation . Put differently , firms with superior design capabilities have an advantage over their rivals . In addition , if this meta - capability is rare and difficult to imitate , there is the pos - sibility of sustaining a competitive advantage . The New Possibilities When strategy scholars teach business strategy to their students or discuss strategy with executives and entrepreneurs , they naturally tend to adopt a general discourse . They usually talk about the industry in which the firm operates and then speak about its inter - nal resources 48 ; they add some occasional comments on how the transactions of the company should be governed . Although this versatility might sound natural in the corridors of large and small businesses , strategy scholars may find themselves in the middle of a set of strategy components without ever questioning how it is articulated at a deeper level . My argument is that design can help in this context , contributing to a more integrated view of strategy . A design - based view of strategy is especially suitable for dealing with ill - defined , complex problems—that is , problems that require firms to rethink their positioning or business model . The first step for companies is to assess the central paradox that might influence their ability to generate value . They do so by investigat - ing the themes surrounding the paradox , thus analyzing and engaging with the problem situation , rather than looking at the issue with a preconceived or biased view . An intimate understand - ing of the problem allows firms to formulate a first outline of their strategic framework . The framework includes a tentative working principle and a central thesis that connects a specific combination of strategy components with the potential generation of economic rents . The second step is to enter a circular or iterative learning 47 Thomas C .

Design Issues : Volume 37 , Number 3 Summer 2021 88 process in which the problem , the solution , and the framework coevolve . Accordingly , examining strategy as design allows for a less rigid , more liberating look at the phenomenon of value cre - ation and value appropriation by firms . The recursive logic of design gives firms the flexibility to adapt as their framework evolves . This kind of logic goes far beyond the “sticky notes and data walls” that have become increasingly popular with the democratization of design methods . And that new depth can be the real hidden strength of design applied to strategy .
