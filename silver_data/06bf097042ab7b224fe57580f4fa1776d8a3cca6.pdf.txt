Placozoans are arguably the simplest free - living animals , possibly evoking an early stage in metazoan evolution , yet their biology is poorly understood . Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the ~ 98 million base pair nuclear genome of the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens . Whole genome phylogenetic analysis suggests that placozoans belong to a " eumetazoan " clade that includes cnidarians and bilaterians , with sponges as the earliest diverging animals . The compact genome exhibits conserved gene content , gene structure , and synteny relative to the human and other complex eumetazoan genomes . Despite the apparent cellular and organismal simplicity of Trichoplax , its genome encodes a rich array of transcription factor and signaling pathway genes that are typically associated with diverse cell types and developmental processes in eumetazoans , motivating further searches for cryptic cellular complexity and / or as yet unobserved life history stages . Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 2 Introduction Placozoans ( literally , “flat animals” ) are small ( 1 - 2 mm ) , disc - shaped creatures that were initially discovered 1 on the walls of a saltwater aquarium in the late 1800’s . They were largely neglected until rediscovered 2 in the 1970 ' s and subsequently found throughout tropical and subtropical oceans in nearshore habitats , particularly mangrove communities . 3 , 4 Placozoans are readily collected in the wild and can be maintained in the laboratory on diverse food sources . While placozoans found in diverse locations are morphologically indistinguishable , they exhibit surprising diversity at the DNA level , suggesting that cryptic species may exist . 5 - 7 The only named species in the phylum is Trichoplax adhaerens F . E . Schulze . 1 Trichoplax appears as a flat disc of cells consisting of two epithelial layers , which sandwich a layer of multi - nucleate fiber cells ( Figure 1a ) . Only four cell types have been described ( Figure 1b ) ; 8 , 9 nerves , sensory cells , and muscle cells are apparently absent . To feed , Trichoplax climbs atop its food using the bottom surface as a temporary extraorganismal gastric cavity ; digestion is both extracellular and by phagocytosis . 10 , 11 When not feeding , the animals move by cilia on the bottom surface and by the fiber cell layer . 10 Placozoans have no evident axis of symmetry other than top versus bottom and periphery versus interior polarity , and show no regular directionality in their movement , although both positive and negative phototaxis have been observed ( personal communication ) 12 . In culture , Trichoplax reproduces by binary fission , whereby one half of the animal moves away from the other half until their connection is broken ( Figure 1c - e ) . Sexual reproduction has never been observed in culture but putative oocyte formation in degenerating animals is routinely seen . 13 These large cells have been observed to undergo cleavage ( Figure 1f - g ) up to a 256 - cell stage before degenerating ( personal communication 14 ) . While Grell also described sperm , 15 they have not been seen by other investigators . Population genetic analyses , however , reveal allelic variation and evidence for genetic recombination in animals in the wild that is consistent with sex . 16 The phylogenetic relationship of placozoans to other metazoans remains controversial . While early studies based on a small number of genes suggested that placozoans could Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 3 be secondarily simplified cnidarians , 17 other analyses refuted this position . 18 , 19 Small subunit rRNA analysis suggested placozoans as eumetazoans , either as sister to bilaterians , 18 or the earliest eumetazoan branch 20 ( although addition of the large subunit rRNA sequences reduced the resolution of the tree ) . Analyses of the complete mitochondrial genomes of Trichoplax adhaerens 21 and other placozoans , 22 however , led to the proposal that Placozoa could be the earliest branching basal metazoan phylum ( but see Ruiz - Trillo et al . , 2008 ) 23 . Here we report the draft nuclear genome sequence of Trichoplax adhaerens , and use it to begin to address the nature of placozoans . Our phylogenetic analysis supports the identification of placozoans as a basal eumetazoan lineage that diverged prior to the separation of cnidarians and bilaterians but after the divergence of sponges from other animals . The compact genome shows remarkable complexity , including conserved gene content , gene structure , and synteny relative to the human and other eumetazoan genomes . Despite the absence of any known developmental program and only a modest number of cell types , the Trichoplax genome encodes a rich array of transcription factors and signaling genes that are typically associated with embryogenesis and cell fate specification in eumetazoans , as well as other genes that are consistent with cryptic patterning of cells or unobserved life history stages and / or complex execution of biological processes such as fission and embryonic development in these enigmatic creatures . The Trichoplax genome We produced a high quality draft sequence of the ~ 98 million base pair ( Mb ) Trichoplax genome using whole genome shotgun methods 24 with ~ 8 - fold redundant sequence coverage . Since there are currently no genetic or physical maps of Trichoplax , we could not reconstruct entire chromosomes , but the completeness of the draft assembly ( 98 % of the 14 , 571 expressed sequence tags aligned ) and its long - range linkage ( 19 scaffolds longer than 1 Mb represent 80 % of the assembly ) make it an excellent substrate for annotation and comparative analysis ( Supplementary Note S2 ) . As expected from genomic sequences derived from an asexually reproducing laboratory culture of diploid animals , only two alleles are observed at each locus . The single Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 4 nucleotide polymorphism averages 1 % and is distributed as expected for two haplotypes selected from a panmictic sexual population ( Supplementary Note S3 ) . We observed 35 extended regions of unusually low polymorphism ( < 0 . 25 % over more than 40 kb ) , indicating recent shared ancestry of the two haplotypes ( via sex or gene conversion ) and / or the influence of selective sweeps . Sampling of more than two haplotypes is required to distinguish these two possibilities . The Trichoplax gene complement and conserved gene structures We estimate that the Trichoplax genome contains 11 , 514 protein coding genes , based on a combination of homology - based and ab initio methods ( Supplementary Note S4 ) . Nearly 87 % of these predicted genes have detectable similarity to proteins known from other animals , and most ( 83 % ) of the ~ 7 , 800 gene families that are conserved between the sea anemone and bilaterians 25 have homologs in Trichoplax as detected by BLAST . Trichoplax genes have an intron density ( 7 . 6 per kb ) comparable to that found in vertebrates ( 8 . 5 per kb ) and the starlet sea anemone ( 6 . 7 per kb ) . 25 Analysis of the exon - intron structure of orthologous genes demonstrates a high degree of conservation in Trichoplax relative to other eumetazoans , extending the antiquity of many animal introns ( Supplementary Note S5 ) . 25 For example , in conserved regions , 82 % of human introns have orthologous counterparts with the same position and phase in Trichoplax . The retention of ancient introns in Trichopla x is in contrast to other animals with small genomes that show extensive intron loss ( e . g . , fruit fly , soil nematode , and sea squirts ) that presumably accompanied their reduction in genome size . 25 Relationship of Trichoplax to other animals With the complete nuclear genome in hand , we reassessed the phylogenetic position of placozoans relative to other metazoans using Bayesian , maximum likelihood , and parsimony analyses of a concatenation of 104 slowly evolving single copy nuclear genes ( 6 , 783 aligned amino acid positions ) drawn from nine diverse fully sequenced genomes ( Figure 2 and Supplementary Note S7 ) . With 100 % Bayesian support and 92 % likelihood bootstrap support , placozoans are found to be a sister group to the other Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 5 eumetazoans ( as represented by two cnidarians and a sampling of diverse bilaterians ) , with demosponge sequences diverging prior to the Trichoplax - cnidarian - bilaterian clade . This topology is further supported by parsimony analysis , albeit with weaker support . There is no support for Trichoplax as a derived or basal cnidarian or bilaterian , and these hypotheses are rejected by statistical phylogenetic tests ( see Supplementary Note S7 . 6 ) . Although there is strong likelihood bootstrap and Bayesian support for the topology in Figure 2 , our analysis can only reject the placement of Trichoplax basal to other animals at the p = 0 . 07 level . Although our result disagrees with results from mitochondrial trees , 21 , 22 , 26 these analyses are complicated by the long branch lengths ( i . e . , unusually high levels of amino acid divergence ) found in bilaterian mitochondrial peptides relative to their basal metazoan orthologs . 26 , 27 Figure 2 shows that peptides encoded by the nuclear genome show no notable differences in amino acid substitution levels between basal metazoans and bilaterians , suggesting that our proposed phylogeny based on nuclear genes is less susceptible to long - branch attraction artifacts . Conserved synteny with other eumetazoans Although the placozoan lineage diverged from that of other animal phyla in the Precambrian , we find evidence for limited conserved local gene order as well as substantial blocks of longer - range conserved linkage ( synteny ) in the Trichoplax genome relative to the larger vertebrate and the starlet sea anemone genomes ( Supplement Table S8 . 1 ) . This is in sharp contrast to the relatively small genomes of flies and nematodes , which show no such conservation . Quantitative analysis of gene neighborhoods in Trichoplax , human , and Nematostella genomes shows that the Trichoplax genome has the lowest level of local rearrangement relative to the common placozoan - cnidarian - bilaterian ancestor ( Supplementary Note S8 . 1 ) . The Trichoplax genome also exhibits larger blocks of conserved synteny ( i . e . , conserved linkage without requiring colinearity 28 ) relative to the human genome . Each of the 21 longest gene - rich Trichoplax scaffolds contains segments with a significant concentration of orthologs on one or more human chromosome segments ( Supplementary Note S8 . 2 ) . These segments are clearly visible in a dot - plot of the Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 6 Trichoplax scaffolds versus the seventeen ancestral chordate linkage groups 29 ( Figure 3 ) , which shows that ( 1 ) many of these linkages have been preserved in the Trichoplax genome , and ( 2 ) most of the chordate linkage groups date back to the placozoan - vertebrate last common ancestor . Neither flies nor nematodes show such conservation . For example , chordate linkage group # 10 ( comprising portions of human chromosomes 1q , 6p , and 9q ) appears in its entirety as a relatively compact 3 . 2Mb segment of Trichoplax scaffold 2 , with substantial gene order changes ( Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure S8 . 1 ) . The observation of blocks of conserved synteny is consistent with a relatively low rate of local rearrangement in Trichoplax Genes that regulate development in Eumetazoa : transcription factors With only four ( possibly five 30 ) morphologically identifiable somatic cell types , one might naively expect Trichoplax to possess few transcription factors associated with the complex regulation of cell fate , patterning , and differentiation found in other eumetazoans ( Table 1 ) . Nevertheless , targeted studies of homeoboxes in Trichoplax have identified a modest complement of these essential eumetazoan patterning genes , including paired box genes 31 and members of the Antp class . 32 Two of these ( Trox2 and Not ) are expressed around the rim of the animal , defining the only known molecular patterning of its body plan . 30 , 33 Analysis of the draft genome shows a rich repertoire of transcription factors ( Table 1 and Supplementary Note S9 ) commonly associated with patterning and regionalization during eumetazoan development , including additional homeobox containing genes from the ANTP , Paired , POU , and Six homeobox subfamilies . 34 Trichoplax also has members of many subfamilies of the animal - specific SOX ( Sry - related HMG - box ) family involved in the regulation of embryonic development , the T - box family including brachyury whose expression defines the blastopore in eumetazoan gastrulation 35 , and the opisthokont ( animal and fungi ) - specific FOX ( forkhead / winged - helix ) family . Transcription factors that regulate cell type specification and differentiation in bilaterians are also abundant in Trichoplax , including multiple LIM - homeobox genes typically associated with sub - type specification in neurons , multiple basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) family genes associated with neural and muscle cell fates , a ( linked ) pair Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 7 of POU / homeodomain family genes implicated in neuroendocrine development in bilaterians , and a pair of GATA - family zinc finger transcription factors that participate in the specification of endodermal , cardiac , and blood cell fates in bilaterians . Thus the Trichoplax genome encodes a variety of nominally cell - type specific markers despite having only a few recognizable cell types , suggesting either massive redundancy of function , alternative functions not directly analogous to those in other animals , or cryptic cellular or developmental complexity . Genes that regulate development in Eumetazoa : signaling pathways Trichoplax lacks consistent directionality in its movements , and possesses upper - lower and center - rim axes that show no evident homology to bilaterian antero - posterior or dorso - ventral axes . Yet components of a complete Wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway - - used for axial patterning in bilaterians and cnidarians 36 and in demosponge larvae 37 - - are present in Trichoplax ( Figure 4a ) . All essential components of the BMP / TGF β signaling pathway are also present in the Trichoplax genome ( Figure 4b ) . In bilaterians BMP signaling is responsible for the establishment of the embryonic dorso - ventral axis during bilaterian development with a similar axis - defining role proposed in cnidarian 38 and demosponge larvae . 37 We did not find evidence for a functioning hedgehog pathway , as there is no evident hedgehog ligand , Patched or Smoothened receptors , or GLI - like transcription factor . 39 Components of other signaling pathways such as the Notch and JAK / STAT pathways are present , but these pathways appear to be incomplete in that they lack molecular components critical to signal transduction ( for example a Notch - like gene with a true Notch domain in the Notch pathway , or a Janus kinase in the JAK / STAT pathway ) ( Table S9 . 1 ) . Four nuclear receptor family transcription factors are present , suggesting signaling by lipid - soluble ligands ( Table 1 ) . Elements of the animal stress response NF - kappaB pathway are found in Trichoplax , along with a nearly complete set of orthologs of genes typically involved in eumetazoan apoptosis ( except for TNFR and Fas - receptor ) ( Supplementary Table S9 . 1 ) . The absence of components of some animal signaling pathways in Trichoplax relative to Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 8 their completeness inferred in the cnidarian - bilaterian ancestor 25 suggests that Trichoplax branched off from an ancestor that either did not possess all animal signaling pathways or that these genes were lost in the placozoan lineage . This latter interpretation is consistent with the presence of some of these ' missing ' components in sponges ( Hedgeling , EGFR , Notch ) . 39 - 41 Molecular elements associated with neuroendocrine function Although Trichoplax has no nervous system , it exhibits behavioral responses to environmental stimuli , and sensitivity to the neuropeptide RFamide has been reported . 42 In the Trichoplax genome we find various ion channels that are implicated in neural signaling in animals . For example , different members of the Kv family of voltage - dependent potassium channel alpha subunits ( the electrically active Shaker and Shaw and the electrically inactive Kv9 ) and beta subunits ( KCNAB ) are present in the Trichoplax genome , along with inward rectifier K - channels and homologs of voltage - gated sodium channels and voltage - gated L - type calcium channel alpha1 subunits and their regulatory beta subunit ( Figure 4c ) . Components of neurotransmitter biosynthesis and vesicle transport systems , as well as a putative neuroendocrine - like secretory apparatus , are also found in the genome ( Figure 4c ) . DOPA decarboxylase and DBH - like monooxygenase ( involved in dopamine , norepinephrine and epinephrine synthesis in adrenergic cells ) , and putative vesicular amine transporters ( used for uptake of neurotransmitters ) are present . The Trichoplax genome encodes members of the synaptic core complex ( SNAP - 25 , synaptobrevin and syntaxin ) . While synaptobrevin and syntaxin are found in diverse eukaryotic groups and are generally involved in vesicular trafficking , Trichoplax SNAP - 25 has a distinct domain found only in animal versions of this protein and not in other eukaryotic members of this family ( e . g . , Sec9 in yeast ) . 43 The genome also contains homologs of the animal neurosecretory vesicle membrane - bound proteins synaptophysin and synaptotagmin , which aid in calcium - dependent vesicle docking and fusion by interacting with SNAP - 25 . Putative neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors are also present , including abundant seven transmembrane G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) that could be Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 9 candidate sensory transducers . Four putative opsin genes possess a crucial lysine residue in the 7th transmembrane domain and thus are suspected to serve a function in light reception are present . 85 members of the class 3 GPCR family ( unrelated to other GPCR families by sequence ) , including putative metabotropic glutamate receptors , are also found . Transmembrane proteins important in nerve conduction ( multiple candidate ionotropic glutamate receptors ) and in neurotransmitter release and uptake ( e . g . sodium neurotransmitter symporter ) are encoded by the genome ( Figure 4c ) . Synapse formation proteins ( such as neurexin and neuroligin ) and structural elements of the post - synaptic scaffold known to be present in sponges 44 ( such as discs large ) are also found in Trichoplax , including the receptors and channels missing from the sponge genome . Genes associated with neural migration and axon guidance in bilaterians ( Slit , netrin , NCAM , semaphorin / CD100 and spondin ) are also present . While all of these nominally neural elements may be functioning in non - neural roles , the Trichoplax genome encodes the basic machinery required for neurotransmitter synthesis , release and uptake , synapse formation , and conduction of electrical impulses and photoreception . Extracellular matrix and cell adhesion Trichoplax has regular cell - cell junctions between epithelial cells but is reported to lack an underlying basal lamina , or indeed , any described extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . 2 Its genome , however , contains a diverse set of putative ECM proteins ( Figure 4d ) . These include collagen IV , laminin - alpha , - beta , and - gamma , and nidogen , although fibronectin , fibrin , elastin , and vitronectin are apparently absent . Heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( including two glypicans ) and a matrilin - 2 like gene are also found . Since many of these genes were also represented in the ESTs from cultured animals , an ECM may be present in a way that evades traditional histological stains . The Trichoplax genome also encodes cell surface adhesion proteins ( alpha and beta integrins , cadherins , selectins , and immunoglobulin superfamily members ) that interact with each other and the ECM , as well as cytoskeletal linker proteins ( paxillin , vinculin , talin , alpha and beta - catenin ) that help organize the actin cytoskeleton and / or transduce signals in other eumetazoans ( Figure 4d ) . Similarly , the genome encodes the protein components ( focal adhesion kinase , paxillin , talin ) that would permit dual functions of beta - catenin and integrin receptors in adhesion and signal transduction ( through Wnt Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 10 and FAK signaling respectively ) . Enzyme families known to modify ECM components and / or signalling molecules in the matrix , such as lysyl oxidases , the ADAM metalloproteases ( including the TACE family ) , and the TIMP metalloprotease inhibitor are present . Sex and Germ Cells Given the ancient eukaryotic origins of meiosis , 45 the production of putative oocytes by Trichoplax , 2 and inference of recombination in wild populations 16 it is perhaps not surprising that meiosis - associated genes are found in the genome ( Table S9 . 1 ) . Trichoplax has an ortholog of the zinc finger protein Nanos and a member of the vasa / PL10 family of DEAD box helicases , as well as homologs of mago nashi , par - 1 , pumilio and tudor , all implicated in primary germ cell development in eumetazoans . While these results suggest that Trichoplax has the same genetic tools that cnidarians and bilaterians use to segregate the germline , studies to document the expression and functions of these genes are needed to verify germline formation in placozoans . Conclusions Our whole genome analyses are consistent with placozoans being the earliest diverging eumetazoan phylum , i . e . , the sister group to the cnidarian - bilaterian clade . Although we cannot formally exclude a more basal position , our analysis rejects the derivation of placozoans from within cnidarians or bilaterians . Further studies ( including additional sequences , ideally from whole genomes ) will be needed to test this phylogenetic hypothesis . Although Trichoplax has a compact genome relative to vertebrates and many other animals , we find that it has not experienced the same degree of intron loss and genomic rearrangement as have other small ( ~ 100 Mb ) metazoan genomes ( e . g . , the sequences of flies and soil nematodes ) . This suggests that many structural aspects ( introns , local gene order , larger - scale linkages ) of the small Trichoplax genome could be primitive eumetazoan characteristics . Nature 2007 - 12 - 12673 page 11 Trichoplax ' s apparent genomic primitiveness , however , is separate from the question of whether placozoan morphology or life history is a relict of the eumetazoan ancestor . For example , the flat form and gutless feeding could be an " primitive " ancestral feature , with the cnidarian - bilaterian gut arising secondarily by the invention of a developmental process for producing an internal body cavity , as in Butschli ' s " plakula " theory , 46 , 47 or it could be a " derived " uniquely placozoan feature that resulted from the loss of an ancestral eumetazoan gut . Unfortunately the genome sequence alone cannot answer these questions , although it provides a platform for further studies . While the Trichoplax body plan is simple , with only four or five morphologically defined cell types , its genome encodes a rich array of transcription factors and signaling pathways that are typically associated with eumetazoan developmental patterning and cell type specification . What roles do these genes play in placozoans ? Cellular morphology may be deceptive , and complex gene expression patterns may define functionally distinct but morphologically cryptic cellular subtypes . 30 , 33 , 35 This would be consistent with scenarios in which transcription factors associated with gene expressions for specific differentiated cell functions in the eumetazoan ancestor were co - opted in cnidarians and bilaterians for patterning roles . 48 We speculate that signaling and transcription factor genes may be involved in complex regulatory events required for the known processes of growth , fission , and / or swarming , or the as yet undescribed processes of sexual reproduction and embryonic development ( Figure S9 . 1 ) . It has been suggested that Trichoplax is a “living fossil” relict of an early stage of animal evolution . 9 , 46 At least from a genomic perspective , Trichoplax retains many ancestral features of its last common ancestor with cnidarians and bilaterians , which lived in the Precambrian . The extent to which the physiology , behavior , and life history of placozoans retains primitive features remains unclear . With the genome in hand , renewed interest in this " simple " animal with a complex genome will likely add to our appreciation of animal diversity and perhaps yield fundamental insights into early animal evolution .

Online Methods A detailed description of methods used in this study can be found in the Supplementary Information available online . Genome Sequencing Genomic DNA was sheared and cloned into plasmid and fosmid vectors for whole genome shotgun sequencing as described . 49 The data were assembled using release 2 . 10 . 6 of Jazz , a WGS assembler . 49 The Trichoplax 8X assembly and the preliminary data analysis can be downloaded from http : / / www . jgi . doe . gov / trichoplax and has been deposited at DDBJ / EMBL / GenBank as project accession ABGP00000000 . Gene Prediction and Annotation The JGI annotation pipeline took scaffolds , repeats , and ESTs as inputs and produced gene models and other features that are stored in a relational database . The data can be publicly accessed through the JGI genome portal at http : / / www . jgi . doe . gov / trichoplax . Protein - coding gene predictions are deposited in DDBJ / EMBL / GenBank as accession ABGP00000000 . Phylogenetic Methods 104 single - copy orthologous genes from nine genomes were aligned using default parameters using both CLUSTALW 50 and MUSCLE , 51 and poorly aligned regions were excluded using Gblocks , yielding 6 , 783 aligned amino acid positions . Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Bayesian inference , maximum likelihood with bootstrap and maximum parsimony with bootstrap using mrbayes , 52 PHYML , 53 and PAUP 54 respectively . Ribosomal sequences ( 18S , 5 . 8S and 28S ) were added to the nuclear dataset and analyzed independently using maximum parsimony with bootstrap . Alternative likelihood topologies were tested using TREEPUZZLE 55 and CONSEL . 56 Identification of Trichoplax Orthologs of Specific Bilaterian Genes A list of Trichoplax gene models annotated with PANTHER hidden Markov models 57 or PFAM domains 58 was analyzed for genes involved in various biological processes in bilaterians . In many cases , Trichoplax orthologs of bilaterian genes were identified by BLAST against the Trichoplax assembly . The resulting genes were analyzed by BLAST against nr , PFAM domain composition and phylogenetic trees to determine orthology to the vertebrate query . 49 . Aparicio , S . et al .
