It is now almost 30 years since we first wrote a review about its existence ; at that time many people believed that with the exception of macropino - cytosis , which will only be briefly mentioned in this review , all uptake could be accounted for by clathrin - dependent endo - cytosis . Now it is generally accepted that there are different clathrin - independent mechanisms , some of them regulated by ligands and membrane lipid composition . They can be both dynamin - dependent and - independent , meaning that the uptake cannot be accounted for by caveolae and other dynamin - dependent processes such as tubular structures that can be induced by toxins , e . g . Shiga toxin , or the fast endophilin mediated endocytosis recently described . Caveolae seem to be mostly quite stable structures with other functions than endocytosis , but evidence suggests that they may have cell - type dependent functions . Although several groups have been working on endocytic mechanisms for years , and new advanced methods have improved our ability to study mechanistic details , there are still a number of important questions we need to address , such as : How many endocytic mechanisms does a cell have ? How quantitatively important are they ? What about the complexity in polarized cells where clathrin - independent endocytosis is differentially regulated on the apical and basolateral poles ? These questions are not easy to answer since one and the same molecule may contribute to more than one process , and manipulating one mechanism can affect another . Also , several inhibitors of endocytic processes commonly used turn out to be less specific than originally thought . We will here describe the current view of clathrin - independent endocytic processes and the challenges in studying them . Keywords Endocytosis · Clathrin · Caveolin · Caveolae · Endophilin · Rho proteins Introduction Clathrin - dependent endocytosis is still the most studied endocytic pathway ; for review , see Kaksonen and Roux ( 2018 ) , and with the clear basket formed by clathrin , it is perhaps not surprising that the question was asked : how can an endocytic vesicle form without clathrin ? Also , published data suggested that all uptake could be accounted for by clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Doxsey et al . 1987 ) . Actu - ally , even a quite recent paper indicated that this can be the case ( Bitsikas et al . 2014 ) . However , early suggestions for other processes came from the observation of cholera toxin in caveolae ( Montesano et al . 1982 ) , and from the findings that when clathrin was removed by potassium depletion of cells ( Moya et al . 1985 ) or the pinching off of clathrin - coated vesicles was prevented by low cytosolic pH ( Sandvig et al . 1987 ) , the protein toxin ricin was still endocytosed . At the time , the counter - arguments raised against clathrin - independent uptake were for instance : when clathrin is removed from the plasma membrane , other elements of the endocytic machinery are still left and may account for a con - tinued uptake . Similarly , when the cytosol is acidified and clathrin - dependent endocytosis is blocked ( Sandvig et al . 1987 ) , this might induce compensatory mechanisms that are normally not present . The last argument was used also in the case of removal of clathrin by potassium depletion . How - ever , although newer studies actually revealed that blocking clathrin - dependent uptake can induce increase in clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Damke et al . 1995 ) , the finding that both potassium depletion and acidification of the cytosol * Kirsten Sandvig ksandvig @ radium . uio . no 1 Department of Molecular Cell Biology , Institute for Cancer Research , The Norwegian Radium Hospital , Oslo University Hospital , Montebello , 0379 Oslo , Norway 2 Department of Molecular Biosciences , University of Oslo , 0316 Oslo , Norway 108 Histochemistry and Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 150 : 107 – 118 1 3 inhibited uptake of ricin by about 50 % fits nicely with the large capacity of the Cdc42 - dependent pathway ( Howes et al . 2010b ) . When it comes to the question of the role of caveolae in endocytosis , this has been debated for decades ( Hommelgaard et al . 2005 ; Sandvig et al . 2008 ; van Deurs et al . 1993 ; Lamaze et al . 2017 ; Cheng et al . 2010 ; Sharma et al . 2004 ) , and a more detailed discussion of caveolae and their role in endocytosis can be found below . It was in fact not until it was published that the dynamin mutant K44A inhibited clathrin - dependent endocytosis without blocking fluid phase uptake that it was generally accepted that there are different endocytic mechanisms ( Damke et al . 1994 ) . It should , however , be remembered that the cellular context is definitely playing a role for quantitative aspect of endocytic uptake . It is an old observation that endo - cytosis is affected by cell density ( Kaplan 1976 ; Sandvig 1978 ; Snijder et al . 2009 ) , and increased cell density is associated with changes in lipid composition and intracel - lular transport ( Kavaliauskiene et al . 2014 ; Frechin et al . 2015 ) . Furthermore , when a cell becomes polarized the clathrin - independent uptake on the two poles are regulated in different ways . The apical clathrin - independent uptake of ricin in polarized MDCK cells can be selectively regu - lated by protein kinase A , protein kinase C , cyclooxyge - nase , and by inhibition of calmodulin without any effect on the basolateral uptake ( Sandvig and van Deurs 2005 ) . Notably , caveolae are only found on the basolateral pole in MDCK cells ( Vogel et al . 1998 ; Scheiffele et al . 1998 ) . Although molecular biology techniques have provided us with new possibilities to manipulate and study cellular mechanisms , we will in this article also touch upon the pit - falls and challenges in studies of endocytosis . For instance , overexpression of proteins or mutant proteins may cause unexpected phenotypes ; one may sequester proteins due to high concentrations of partners with a low affinity , and overexpression or treatment with siRNA may cause com - pensatory mechanisms ; an example being the upregula - tion of Rab6A’ upon knockdown of Rab6A ( Utskarpen et al . 2006 ) . Importantly , it is also essential in such studies with a strict quantification of what is really internalized and what is still connected to the surrounding of the cell , but present in invaginations that have not pinched off . An overview of endocytic pathways covered in this review can be found in Fig . 1 . Fig . 1 An overview of endocytic mechanisms in a non - polarized and b polarized epithelial cells . The different mechanisms are described in the text : In addition to clathrin - dependent endocytosis , we have indicated the following pathways : Caveolae , now regarded as quite stable structures ; flotillin , may mediate transfer of a ligand to the invagination rather than contribute to the endocytic process ; the Cdc42 - dependent but dynamin - independent uptake ; the Rho / Rac pathway ; the toxin - induced tubules with endophilin ; FEME ( see text ) ; as well as macropinocytosis . In polarized cells the apical clathrin - independent uptake is regulated by a number of factors , e . g . protein kinase A , which does not affect the basolateral uptake . It should be noted that in MDCK cells all caveolae are at the basolateral pole 109 Histochemistry and Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 150 : 107 – 118 1 3 Quantitative aspects of endocytic pathways There are several challenges when one wants to study quan - titative aspects of different endocytic mechanisms , and to answer the question : by which mechanism is a given ligand taken into cells ? An important aspect in studies of endocytic uptake of plasma membrane and ligands is : how can one make sure that the ligand under investigation is in a closed vesicle and not only in a deeply invaginated portion of the plasma membrane ? When cells are fixed and studied by EM one cannot without serial sectioning conclude as to whether a structure seen still might be connected to the cell surface . An alternative to serial sectioning is fixation in the presence of Ruthenium red which can reveal whether a structure is surface connected ( Sandvig et al . 2008 , 2011 ; Caldieri et al . 2017 ; Liberali et al . 2008 ) . As seen in Fig . 2 caveolae which are still connected to the cell surface can appear to be located far from the cell surface unless the membrane connection is revealed by Ruthenium red staining . Another way to study whether a ligand is internalized is to use high - resolution confocal microscopy with Z - stacks ( Iversen et al . 2011 ) . Furthermore , if one wants to study a possible constitutive endocytic process , it is of course important to investigate whether the ligands or compounds added do not in them - selves modulate the process . For instance , it was discovered that addition of glycosphingolipids may increase the pinch - ing off of caveolae ( Sharma et al . 2004 ) , and to our knowl - edge it has not yet been investigated to which extent cholera toxin , which can be seen localized in caveolae ( Montesano et al . 1982 ) and which will crosslink the glycosphingolipid GM1 , might affect the pinching off of caveolae . Interesting in this connections is that crosslinking of GM1 with the cholera toxin B pentamer can induce transmembrane signal - ing ( Schnitzler et al . 2007 ) and increase the cytosolic con - centration of Ca 2 + ( Ledeen and Wu 2015 ; Dixon et al . 1987 ) . Another challenge it is that one and the same protein can be involved in more than one endocytic pathway , an example being endophilin A2 which plays a role both for clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent uptake ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ; Ferreira and Boucrot 2018 ; Renard et al . 2015 ; Hohen - dahl et al . 2017 ) . Thus , modifying the level or transfecting with mutants are likely to affect different mechanisms . It should be noted that endophilin was recently reported to inhibit dynamin - mediated membrane fission ( Hohendahl et al . 2017 ) . However , since a fast endophilin A2 - dependent endocytosis ( FEME ) pathway was reported , it is possible that endophilin can facilitate dynamin - dependent uptake in certain contexts ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) . Similarly , Cdc42 is important for both macropinocytosis , FEME as well as for the dynamin - independent CLIC / GEEC ( clathrin - independent carrier / glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored protein - enriched endosomal compartments ) pathway ( Howes et al . 2010a ; Sabharanjak et al . 2002 ; Fer - reira and Boucrot 2018 ) . However , inhibition of Cdc42 may increase FEME ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) . Already in 2010 it was reported that phosphocaveolin - 1 is involved in the coregu - lation of caveolar and Cdc42 - dependent fluid phase uptake ( Cheng et al . 2010 ) , and it turns out that also the caveolar protein cavin can down - regulate the Cdc42 dependent path - way ( Chaudhary et al . 2014 ) . The role of actin in clathrin - dependent endocytosis has been debated over the years . Its involvement is not always Fig . 2 Ruthenium red added during fixation of cells and the result - ing black staining of the membrane reveal that caveolae which may appear as free vesicles in the cytosol are surface connected . Bar 100 nm . This figure is reproduced from ( Sandvig et al . 2011 ) . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . ceb . 2011 . 03 . 007 110 Histochemistry and Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 150 : 107 – 118 1 3 obligatory or easy to demonstrate , and was reported to be dependent on cell type and growth conditions ( Fujimoto et al . 2000 ) . More recently , the dependency on actin was found to be regulated by membrane tension ( Boulant et al . 2011 ) . In agreement with that , insertion of lysolipids with large headgroups into the plasma membrane of HEp - 2 cells reduced the clathrin - dependent uptake of transferrin , and made transferrin uptake more dependent on actin ( Ailte et al . 2017 ) . It is possible that actin may facilitate all types of endocytosis , but that the requirement varies , as other fac - tors such as protein crowding and insertion of amphipatic helixes can also be involved in vesicle formation ( Renard et al . 2018 ) . Thus , the disruption of actin function cannot easily be used to conclude about the quantitative aspects of endocytic pathways . A common way to study by which mechanisms a given ligand or compound is taken up is to use inhibitors of dif - ferent enzymes , or chemical compounds affecting vari - ous cellular processes . Such studies have to be performed with care , as there are several pitfalls ( Iversen et al . 2011 ) . Although the term “well - established small molecule inhibi - tors” is often used , the conclusions can still be wrong . For instance , the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein is often used as a specific inhibitor for uptake by caveolae , but since it is a general inhibitor of phosphotyrosine kinases , it will also inhibit other processes dependent on tyrosine phosphoryla - tion , as for instance uptake of EGF by clathrin - coated pits ( Yang et al . 1996 ) and ruffling induced by growth factors acting via tyrosine phosphorylation ( Jiang et al . 1995 ) . So , when the conclusion is that rather large particles ( several hundred nanometers ) enter via the small caveolae ( about 80 nm diameter ) since the uptake is inhibited by genistein ( Wolfram et al . 2017 ) , one should question whether another mechanism is involved , and it is absolutely worthwhile to recheck what is going on in this system . Another commonly misused approach is to conclude about the involvement of caveolae from studies involving extraction of cholesterol with cyclodextrin . Removal of cholesterol will affect sev - eral endocytic pathways , and this is further discussed below . Actually , a number of compounds commonly used to inter - fere with various endocytic pathways were recently found to affect endophilin A2 - positive assemblies ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) , but whether this correlates with inhibition of endo - cytosis does not seem to be clear . One should also be aware of the fact that crosslinking of surface structures might induce endocytic uptake in itself . An example is that particles with several Tat peptides can induce recruitment of Rac1 and induce macropinocytosis ( Imamura et al . 2011 ) . Also , particles with the plant toxin ricin immobilized on the surface can , in contrast to free ricin , induce a macropinocytotic process ( Iversen et al . 2012 ) . Moreover , as suggested by Ferreira and Boucrot ( 2018 ) , results reported for the uptake of IL - 2 ( interleukin 2 ) receptor beta subunit might be affected by use of antibod - ies against this subunit . Membrane lipids and clathrin‑independent endocytosis It has been known for many years that the structure of caveolae is dependent on cholesterol , and that addition of cholesterol - binding compounds such as nystatin and filipin , or removal of cholesterol by using methyl β - cyclodextrin ( mβCD ) will remove the caveolar structures ( Rothberg et al . 1990 ; Klein et al . 1995 ) . However , also clathrin - dependent endocytosis can be reduced by extraction of cholesterol , leaving flat clathrin - coated areas at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 ) ( Rodal et al . 1999 ; Subtil et al . 1999 ) . The mech - anism behind this change is not understood . Importantly , endocytosis can still occur under these conditions ( Rodal et al . 1999 ) . By testing the ability of different sterols to restore endocytosis , it was recently shown that the 3β - OH group in cholesterol is essential and so is the ability of the sterol to support lipid raft formation ( Kim et al . 2017 ) . How - ever , it could be that it is the effect of lipid packing and not raft formation that is important ( Kim et al . 2017 ) . Also macropinocytosis requires cholesterol ; reduction of cho - lesterol will inhibit recruitment of Rac and the membrane ruffling ( Fig . 4 ) which is a prerequisite for macropinocyto - sis ( Grimmer et al . 2002 ) . Moreover , cholesterol has been shown to be important both for Cdc42 - dependent endocy - tosis ( Chadda et al . 2007 ) and for RhoA - dependent endocy - tosis of IL - 2 receptors ( Lamaze et al . 2001 ) . Whether cho - lesterol redistribution might be involved in the shear stress induced Cdc42 - activated apical endocytosis in proximal tubule cells , a process regulated by activators and inhibitors of calmodulin ( Bhattacharyya et al . 2017 ) , has so far not been investigated . It should be noted that also clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis on the apical pole of polarized MDCK cells is regulated by calmodulin ( Llorente et al . 1996 ) . In contrast to the examples above , where cholesterol is required for uptake , we found that when clathrin - dependent uptake is blocked by expression of clathrin heavy chain antisense RNA , Shiga toxin uptake after cholesterol deple - tion is actually increased , suggesting that rafts may prevent endocytosis and keep ligands at the cell surface ( Sandvig et al . 2008 ) . Similarly , the raft - associated proteins caveo - lin and flotillin may actually inhibit uptake from the cell surface of certain ligands . Caveolin - 1 was found to inhibit dynamin - dependent , raft - mediated endocytosis of cholera toxin ( Lajoie et al . 2009 ) , and flotillin stabilized the plasma membrane association of ErbB receptors ( Asp et al . 2014 ; Pust et al . 2013 ) . After knockdown of flotillin , the ErbB receptors were internalized . Recent data have revealed that removal of cholesterol also induces formation of tubular structures ( Shen et al . 2014 ; 111 Histochemistry and Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 150 : 107 – 118 1 3 Hirama et al . 2017 ) that may pinch off in an ATP - independ - ent manner . This is presumably linked to increased charge density at the inner leaflet caused by phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , and similar tubular structures can be created by direct addition of PS ( Hirama et al . 2017 ) . In agreement with these findings are data published already in 1995 , that an increase in plasma membrane PS would increase endocytosis ( Farge 1995 ) . Thus , changing the membrane lipid composition may throw light on the processes normally occurring , but may also create phenomena normally not observed . Not surprisingly , interfering with sphingolipid synthe - sis may affect clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Cheng et al . 2006 ) . Sphingomyelin was reported to be important for membrane recruitment of both Cdc42 and RhoA , and as mentioned above , addition of certain lipids such as the glycosphingolipid LacCer ( lactosylceramide ) can induce pinching off of caveolae ( Sharma et al . 2004 ) . Thus , trying to follow an endocytic process by inserting probes into the membrane might change the process under investigation . Moreover , changing the membrane fluidity by incubating cells with unsaturated fatty acids was found to reduce the uptake of Shiga toxin , which is internalized by both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis ( Spilsberg et al . 2007 ) . Interestingly , crosslinking of glycolipids by ligands such as Shiga toxin and cholera toxin has been reported to induce formation of tubular structures that pinch of in a dynamin - and endophilin - dependent manner ( see below ) ( Römer et al . 2007 ; Renard et al . 2015 ) . Changing membrane structure by modifying lipids with enzymes , thereby changing their shape , do also affect the membrane curvature and endocytic uptake . For instance , a wounded cell may , due to a membrane damage causing leak - age , get a higher cytosolic Ca 2 + - level , which may induce fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane and release of sphingomyelinase with subsequent formation of ceramide from sphingomyelin . Due to the decrease in lipid head group size in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane , this will facil - itate membrane bending and endocytosis of the lesion ( Tam et al . 2010 ) . In contrast , insertion of lysophosphatidylinosi - tol with large headgroups into the plasma membrane made it Fig . 3 Examples from HEp - 2 cells of clathrin - coated areas with different extent of invagi - nation ( a – e ) and schematically drawn in f . In g , clathrin - coats in control cells and cells treated with 10 mM mβCD for 15 min were scored for invagination as classified in f ( approximately 200 coated pits in each experi - ment ) . The relative frequency of the different types is shown , and reveal that mβCD prevents invagination of clathrin - coated pits . Bar 100 nm .

Such treatment efficiently reduced clathrin - dependent uptake , whereas it had a much smaller effect on clathrin - inde - pendent uptake ( Ailte et al . 2017 ) . To investigate the mechanisms of endocytosis , one may use planar lipid model membranes or liposomes . However , mostly the membrane composition of these membranes does not reflect what is normally found in the plasma membrane . Such model membranes are normally symmetric and contain only a few lipid species , often present in very low amounts in cells . Furthemore , two model systems may not always give the same results . For instance , using Shiga toxin to induce tubules after binding to Gb3 , it was found that the semisyn - thetic C22 : 1 Gb3 , but not C22 : 0 , behaved like porcine kidney Gb3 in the liposome model ( Römer et al . 2007 ) . However , in planar lipids C22 : 0 Gb3 gave similar results as the Gb3 mix - ture from porcine kidney ( Windschiegl et al . 2009 ) , revealing a model - dependent difference that so far is not explained . Clathrin‑independent and dynamin‑dependent endocytic mechanisms RhoA , FEME , Shiga toxin - induced tubules , and ARF6 Clathrin - independent endocytosis can be both dynamin dependent and dynamin independent . Mechanisms dependent on dynamin for vesicle formation are the RhoA - dependent pathway responsible for uptake of IL - 2 , pinch - ing off of tubules induced by crosslinking of glycolipids by multivalent toxins such as Shiga toxins , the relatively newly described process FEME , and also endocytosis of the EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) occurring at high con - centrations of EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) . Furthermore , uptake from caveolae and closure of macropinocytic vesicles originating from circular ruffles also require dynamin . How - ever , more than one mechanism may be involved in vesicle formation ( Renard et al . 2018 ) . The different dynamin - dependent mechanisms are described in detail below . In 2015 it was described that pinching off of Shiga toxin induced tubules is dependent not only on dynamin , but also on endophilin and actin ( Renard et al . 2015 ) . For a recent review of this mechanism , see Johannes ( 2017 ) . It should , however , be noted that although endophilin A2 and dynamin knockdown protected cells against Shiga toxin by a factor of 2 – 3 , very little protection was obtained after disruption of actin ( Renard et al . 2015 ) , a finding that may be related to Shiga toxin taken in by other mechanisms ; both clathrin - dependent and dynamin - independent endocytosis of the toxin occurs in several cell lines ; for review , see Bergan et al . ( 2012 ) and Sandvig et al . ( 2014 ) . Furthermore , one should be aware of that dynamin is important also for endosome to Golgi transport of Shiga toxin ( Lauvrak et al . 2004 ; Saint - Pol et al . 2004 ) , thus a protection obtained by knockdown of dynamin is not necessarily related only to uptake from the Fig . 4 Cholesterol is required for macropinocytosis . A431 cells were serum - starved for 4 h , and in a and b the cholesterol was lowered by a 30 min incubation with 5 mM mβCD ( CDx ) before the cells were incubate for 15 min with HRP ( horseradish peroxidase ) ( 10 mg / ml ) in the presence of mβCD and 1 µM TPA ( 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate ) . There is no ruffling and macropinocytosis . In contrast , in c and d , a mixture of mβCD ( 2 . 5 mM ) and mβCD ( 2 . 5 mM ) with cholesterol ( CDxCh ) was used in order not to affect membrane cho - lesterol , and as shown , the cells are then able to form ruffles and macropinosomes .

It would certainly be interesting to know the fraction of Shiga toxin taken in by such tubular structures in different cell lines as clathrin - dependent and dynamin - inde - pendent uptake of this toxin can account for a considerable uptake of this toxin ; for review , see Sandvig et al . ( 2014 ) . Another study showing the importance of endophilin A2 in clathrin - independent endocytosis was published at the same time ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) . An endocytic pathway operating at the leading edges of cells was demonstrated , and it was found to be ligand triggered and responsible for uptake of a number of different receptors , including the IL - 2 recep - tor . This process , FEME , was reported to be activated upon inhibition of Cdc42 , and remarkably seemed to be affected by a large number of inhibitors normally used to interfere with other endocytic pathways . The RhoA and dynamin - dependent uptake of IL - 2 recep - tor subunits was first described in 2001 ( Lamaze et al . 2001 ) , and today several molecules required for this process are known ( Basquin et al . 2013 ) . This includes Rac1 , Pak and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , so during the years the mechanistic insight has increased , and the requirements for uptake seem to fit with the recently described FEME mechanism ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) . However , although IL - 2 was reported to be internalized by FEME in T cells ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) , it has been suggested that the characteristics found for uptake of IL - 2 receptor subunits after crosslinking with antibodies are affected by the antibodies , and that the receptor subunits in spite of many similarities are endocy - tosed by a different mechanism than FEME ( Ferreira and Boucrot 2018 ) . A recent publication reports that endophilin A2 is required for dynamin recruitment during endocytosis of the IL - 2 receptor ( Bertot et al . 2018 ) . In contrast , dynamin was still recruited to clathrin - coated pits after knockdown of endophilin A2 , and importantly , in the control situation endophilin was recruited to all clathrin - coated pits , not only to a subpopulation , meaning that endophilin cannot be used as a marker for clathrin - independent endocytosis . Concern - ing involvement of Rho proteins in endocytosis of other ligands , it was reported that in basolaterally permeabilized MDCK cells , apical clathrin - independent endocytosis of the plant toxin ricin was inhibited by the Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase , implicating involvement of Rho - proteins ( Garred et al . 2001 ) . Clearly more studies should be per - formed to characterize regulation of clathrin - independent uptake in polarized cells . Also the small GTP - binding protein Arf6 has been impli - cated in endocytosis ; for review , see Grant and Donaldson ( 2009 ) . However , although this protein was reported to be involved in clathrin - independent , but dynamin - dependent endocytosis of Coxsackievirus A9 ( Heikkila et al . 2010 ) and the Herpes Simplex virus protein VP22 ( Nishi and Saigo 2007 ) , Arf6 seems to mainly play a role in recycling ( Grant and Donaldson 2009 ) . Also β1 - integrin can be endocytosed by clathrin - inde - pendent and dynamin - dependent endocytosis , and tubules that pinch off can be induced by the calmodulin - inhibitor W7 ( Soriano - Castell et al . 2017 ) . Interestingly this tubula - tion was counteracted by active Rac , phospholipase C , the Rac effector ROCK1 , and actomyosin at the cell cortex . Sim - ilarly , apical clathrin - independent endocytosis in polarized MDCK cells was stimulated by the calmodulin inhibitor W7 , whereas there was no effect on the basolateral side ( Llorente et al . 1996 ) . However , in this case it was not investigated whether the increased uptake is dynamin dependent . Caveolae / caveolin and endocytosis Caveolae have been reported to be important for uptake of albumin in endothelial cells ( Schnitzer et al . 1994 ) , and the possibility exists that there are different types of cave - olae with specialized functions as for instance dynamin - 2 is not found in all caveolae ( Lamaze et al . 2017 ) . Caveolae are today , at least in most cells , considered as quite stable membrane structures ( van Deurs et al . 2003 ; Pelkmans et al . 2004 ; Parton et al . 2006 ; Kirkham et al . 2005 ) with a role in signaling and in providing membrane during stretching of the plasma membrane ( Bastiani and Parton 2010 ) . Thus the observation of a certain ligand in caveolae does not mean that this is the main endocytic pathway for that ligand . An example is cholera toxin which many years ago was found to localize in caveolae ( Montesano et al . 1982 ) , and which for years was believed to enter mainly by this pathway . How - ever , quantitative measurements revealed that the presence or absence of caveolae may not play any difference for the uptake of this toxin in Caco - 2 cells ( Torgersen et al . 2001 ) , and the toxin can be endocytosed also by clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Torgersen et al . 2001 ; Shogomori and Futer - man 2001 ; Nichols et al . 2001 ) . At the time when these data were published this caused some reaction , but this view is now accepted as different groups published similar results . As mentioned above , certain ligands and lipids may induce pinching off of caveolae , and it would be interesting to know if cholera toxin - induced cross - linking of GM1 actually might induce pinching off of caveolae . Relevant in this connection is the finding that the virus SV40 , which also binds multiva - lently to glycolipids , can enter through caveolae ( Pelkmans et al . 2001 ) , but that it may enter even more efficiently in cells without these structures ( Damm et al . 2005 ) . Also , it should be noted that at a time it was believed that SV40 went from caveolae to the so - called neutral “caveosome” and from there to the ER , and actually it is still being published that people try to target for instance nanoparticles to these structures to avoid the endosomal / lysosomal pathway and degradation of the particles . However , it is important to be aware of that the caveosome turned out to be an artefact , and that the content of caveolae after pinching off ends up in the 114 Histochemistry and Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 150 : 107 – 118 1 3 endosomal pathway ( Parton and Howes 2010 ) . Actually the authors of the original articles about the caveosome have suggested that the term “caveosome” should not be used any more ( Hayer et al . 2010 ) . Caveolin is found not only in caveolae , but also on flat areas of the plasma membrane where it may function to restrict and not facilitate uptake of certain ligands . This has been reported to be the case for uptake of autocrine mobil - ity factor ( AMF ) and for cholera toxin ( Lajoie and Nabi 2010 ) . A recently published mechanism involving cave - olae , but apparently not their endocytic function , concerns their involvement in an ARF6 - dependent mechanism linking hemidesmosome remodeling and mechanoresponse ( Osmani et al . 2018 ) . EGFR - reticulon 3 dependent uptake It has been known for some time that at high concentra - tions of EGF , the EGF / EGFR complex is endocytosed by a clathrin - independent mechanism leading to degradation of the growth factor , and recently it was described that EGF is able to induce increased contact between the plasma mem - brane and the ER ( endoplasmic reticulum ) in a reticulon 3 dependent mechanism . An IP3 ( inositoltrisphosphate ) - dependent release of Ca 2 + from the ER is required for the uptake of EGFR , and in addition dynamin is involved . The plasma membrane protein CD147 was found to be cointer - nalized with EGFR . Whether other growth factors or ligands may be endocytosed by a similar mechanism , is still an open question . Dynamin‑independent endocytosis Cdc42 dependent endocytosis giving rise to small vesicles The Cdc42 dependent pathway , also called CLIC / GEEC pathway ( Howes et al . 2010a ; Sabharanjak et al . 2002 ; Fer - reira and Boucrot 2018 ) , is responsible for quite a fraction of fluid phase uptake in cells , and it has been reported to take in GPI - anchored proteins , protein toxins that bind glycolipids as well as transmembrane proteins such as CD44 ; for review see Bendris and Schmid ( 2017 ) . Perhaps a bit surprising , this Cdc42 - dependent form of endocytosis is dynamin independ - ent even though one of the proteins implicated in the pro - cess , GRAF1 , is able to bind dynamin ( Ferreira and Boucrot 2018 ) . However , in this context GRAF1 seems to function as a GAP for Cdc42 ( Bendris and Schmid 2017 ) . Furthermore , SNX9 is a positive regulator of Cdc42 , and knockdown of SNX9 reduces the uptake of CD44 ( Bendris and Schmid 2017 ) . Interestingly , this sorting nexin is involved also in clathrin - dependent endocytosis and may serve as a negative regulator of RhoA ; for a recent review on the role of SNX9 in endocytosis , see Bendris and Schmid ( 2017 ) . ARF1 and its GEF , GBF1 , are also reported to be important for this Cdc42 - dependent clathrin - independent uptake ; for review , see Kaczmarek et al . ( 2017 ) . Remark - ably , although CtBP / BARS seems to be important for fluid phase uptake , a direct involvement in the Cdc42 - dependent pathway described above has to our knowledge not been demonstrated . On the other hand , it has been demonstrated to be involved in uptake by macropinocytosis ( see below ) . CtBP / BARS and associated proteins CtBP / BARS was found to be important both for fission at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus , and inter - fering with its function in COS7 cells reduced fluid phase uptake by 60 % ( Bonazzi et al . 2005 ) . However , although the mechanistic details are still not clarified , different proteins associated with CtBP / BARS as well as its state of phospho - rylation are important for its function ( Liberali et al . 2008 ; Valente et al . 2013 ) . It has been suggested that the protein 14 - 3 - 3γ binds and stabilizes the phosphorylated fission active monomeric form of CtBP / BARS in connection with macropinocytosis . This does not exclude involvement of other partners . Interestingly , ARF1 , which is also involved in macropinocytosis , stimulates together with CtBP / BARS the enzyme PLD ( phospholipase D ) in a synergic manner . The locally generated PA ( phosphatidic acid ) is important for the fission ; for review , see Valente et al . ( 2013 ) . To which extent CtBP / BARS is involved in different endocytosis mechanisms does not seem to be known , and several fission mechanisms may play a role in the different endocytic processes ; for review , see Renard et al . ( 2018 ) . Macropinocytosis In this review , we will not describe macropinocytosis in detail since it differs from the other endocytic mechanisms by resulting in formation of relatively large vesicles , and macropinocytosis has been recognized as an important uptake mechanism for fluid and membrane receptors for many years . We want to refer the reader to some recent reviews ( Orth and McNiven 2006 ; Itoh and Hasegawa 2013 ; Ferreira and Boucrot 2018 ; Marques et al . 2017 ; Buck - ley and King 2017 ) . Briefly , there are two main types of macropinocytosis : one type involving circular ruffles and being dependent on dynamin for pinching off ( Orth and McNiven 2006 ; Itoh and Hasegawa 2013 ) , the other one being dynamin - independent ; for recent reviews , see Fer - reira and Boucrot ( 2018 ) and Marques et al . ( 2017 ) . As for other endocytic mechanisms , SNX9 has been found to be a central player also for macropinocytosis ( Bendris and Schmid 2017 ) . As mentioned above , CtBP / BARS is involved 115 Histochemistry and Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 150 : 107 – 118 1 3 in macropinocytosis , and it has been reported that comple - tion of macropinocytosis is dependent on the conversion of phosphoinositides ( Maekawa et al . 2014 ) . It should be mentioned that a commonly used method to block macropi - nocytosis is to inhibit the Na + / H + - exchanger by addition of amiloride or derivatives of this drug , thereby lowering the submembranous pH and inhibiting recruitment of Rac and Cdc42 ( Koivusalo et al . 2010 ) . However , these drugs were also reported to affect endophilin - positive assemblies in cells ( Boucrot et al . 2015 ) , and in general care should be taken in interpreting inhibitor - based studies . Flotillins and their role in endocytosis The raft - associated proteins flotillin 1 and 2 have also been implicated in endocytosis ( Glebov et al . 2006 ; Sandvig et al . 2011 ) . Knockdown of flotillin - 1 was found to inhibit uptake of GPI - linked proteins ( Glebov et al . 2006 ) . However , a very low frequency of flotillin - microdomain associated budding has been reported ( Riento et al . 2009 ) , a finding in agree - ment with the lack of effect of flotillin - depletion on the rate of cholera toxin endocytosis ( Saslowsky et al . 2010 ) . Also , there was no effect on the uptake of the plant toxin ricin and uptake of Shiga toxin upon knockdown of flotillin - 1 and flotillin - 2 ( Pust et al . 2010 ) . Interestingly , flotillin microdo - mains may , in a similar way as reported for flat membrane domains containing caveolin , prevent endocytosis of mem - brane receptors . We recently reported that ErbB receptor internalization is induced by knockdown of either flotillin - 1 or flotillin - 2 ( Asp et al . 2014 ) . In cases where flotillins actu - ally mediate uptake , it is possible that they are important for pre - endocytic clustering , and not for the endocytic process itself , and the term flotillin - assisted endocytosis ( instead of flotillin - dependent endocytosis ) has therefore been sug - gested ( Meister and Tikkanen 2014 ) . Conclusion As described in the current review , the scientific community still has a long way to go when it comes to understanding the different endocytic mechanisms ; the molecular details , the influence of cell context such as polarization , the effect of ligands with the possibility of crosslinking and mediating transmembrane signaling , as well as the variability between cell types .
