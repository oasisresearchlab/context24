ABSTRACT Public surveys intend to integrate civic values into ofcial decision - making . Because such surveys are typically infrastructured from the top - down , citizens’ participatory agency is often reduced to react - ing to concerns that may not align with their bottom - up needs . This paper presents PosterTalk , a physically situated and digitally facili - tated middle - out survey platform that explicitly involved bottom - up citizens in its gatekeeping activities . Over a four months in - the - wild deployment , PosterTalk accumulated 41 inquiries and 420 responses spanning over 13 civic themes . Its emerging survey content directly infuenced the local policy agenda of the facilitating neighbour - hood committee , and nudged them to reassess their civic repre - sentativeness .

By integrating publicly - sourced values and preferences into of - fcial decision - making , citizen engagement has the potential to increase the quality of legislation , foster trust and reduce confict [ 89 ] . Although in - person citizen engagement allows citizens to raise their concerns to government representatives , physically co - located initiatives , such as co - design workshops [ 57 ] , participatory walk - shops [ 107 ] or town hall meetings [ 60 ] yet limit the diversity of involved citizens by the time , preference , language and rhetorical skill that is required [ 92 ] to bodily attend and express convinc - ing arguments [ 41 ] . Digital manifestations of citizen engagement claim to gather a more diverse citizen cohort [ 75 ] by ofering public surveys via dedicated websites [ 31 ] , mobile applications [ 94 ] or public displays [ 28 ] that invite citizens to provide actionable sug - gestions or vote on policy alternatives in more opportunistic ways . For instance , digital surveys already empowered citizens to provide feedback regarding the planning of parking regulations [ 111 ] ; sur - veyed the experience of shop visitors in their local neighbourhood [ 66 ] ; or nudged apathetic demographics , such as the youth [ 55 ] or time - poor [ 95 ] individuals to take part in urban planning activities . However , most public surveys are instituted from the top - down [ 51 ] , either by governmental agencies or local councils to inform already scoped policy decisions ; or by researchers to investigate the civic impact of methodological or technological participation techniques in living - labs [ 87 ] or during in - the - wild [ 91 ] studies ( e . g . [ 27 , 99 , 106 ] ) . Such top - down surveys can be criticised for inhibiting the participatory agency of citizens to passive engagement [ 85 ] because they can merely consume predefned information [ 33 , 46 ] or are asked to respond [ 50 ] to concerns that refect the assumptions of the ’top’ . As such , the content of these surveys is not necessarily representative of the actual needs from those at the ’bottom’ [ 4 ] . It has therefore been argued that top - down public surveys can gain value by inviting ’bottom - up’ stakeholders , such as afected citizens , communities and organisations , to actively partake in their design process [ 13 , 104 ] . Moreover , the so - called ’middle - out’ design approach [ 43 ] proposes to actively utilise the collective knowledge of both top - down and bottom - up stakeholders not only during the initial design phase but also while implementing and deploying surveys [ 40 ] . Public surveys that are controlled by both citizens and top - down stakeholders not only focus more on locally relevant issues [ 95 ] , they also allow citizens to trust and interpret the survey content more , particularly when bottom - up opinions are in opposition to those of the top - down stakeholders [ 61 ] . However , little knowledge exists on how a ’middle - out’ approach can be technologically facilitated and integrated throughout a pub - lic survey process , let alone on how it afects the engagement of both stakeholder sides . This paper therefore attempts to answer the research question : " What is the impact of integrating a middle - out approach in a public survey ? " . In response , we present our analysis of PosterTalk ( PT ) : a physically situated and digitally fa - cilitated middle - out survey platform that aims to engage a non - formalised neighbourhood committee and local citizens to collect concerns from within their neighbourhood . PT was specifcally conceptualised to open - up the ’gatekeeping’ activities , which are normally managed from the top - down [ 12 ] , to citizens . The concept of gatekeeping typically refers to the one - directional and top - down curation and designation of news content in large - scale communica - tion networks [ 97 ] . With the proliferation of social media however , end users have become more empowered to share , and therefore gatekeep , information themselves on diferent scales [ 45 ] , so that institutions , professional communicators , networked and everyday citizens now also infuence each other in multi - directional ways [ 10 , 23 ] . In this paper , we interpret gatekeeping in the context of citizen engagement to denote the multi - directional fltering of all content that is produced during public surveying : from determining the questions , over moderating ofensive comments , to curating the most promising answers , certain information is selected , high - lighted and fne - tuned in seemingly objective but however biased ways . While diferent types of gatekeeping have already been man - ifested in other citizen engagement interventions , our literature review ( Table 1 ) suggests that our study is the frst to report on the impact of deliberately opening up multiple gatekeeping activities at once . During its four - month deployment within a sub - municipality of approximately 30 . 000 inhabitants , PT collected 41 valid inquiries that covered 13 distinct civic themes , which in turn provoked 420 responses . Among other results , the use of PT has prompted the neighbourhood committee to re - evaluate their role as civic media - tors within the local community . The survey also encouraged them to broaden their activist agenda when taking part in a public debate with the city council , during which they presented local agenda points generated by PT . Through critical analysis of the gathered content , interaction logs and stakeholder interviews , this paper contributes a middle - out framework that outlines : 1 ) a gatekeeping activity workfow that could be used to optimise or benchmark the participatory agency of the involved stakeholders in public surveys ; and 2 ) four practi - cal guidelines on how middle - out gatekeeping can be leveraged to diversify civic agendas , nudge top - down introspection , and how it should be prevented that middle - out gatekeeping is unintentionally misappropriated or becomes perceived as a top - down initiative . As citizen engagement becomes more integral to public policy devel - opment [ 14 ] , we believe this longer - term study of a middle - out survey platform can inform the future development of technologi - cal advances that empower everyday citizens to shape their own environment . 2 RELATED WORK We review the diferent types of citizen engagement platforms and technologies within HCI research with a particular focus on public surveying , alongside the participatory agency they provide to their various stakeholders . 2 . 1 Digitally Facilitated Citizen Engagement The ultimate goal of any citizen engagement method is to incor - porate public values , assumptions , and preferences into decision making while increasing the substantive quality of decisions and fostering trust in institutions [ 11 ] . However , to become an engaged participant of in - person civic activities , citizens typically need to 2574 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Table 1 : In comparison to 11 other public survey platforms , PT stands out due to the participatory agency it provides through middle - out ( cells marked red , horizontal arrows ) gatekeeping activities .

When this is achieved , traditional methods such as mail surveys , dialog with existing community groups , and community dinners can be productive in defning common goals and incorporating beliefs and values into decision - making , but may not represent an entire community [ 32 ] . In contrast , digital types of citizen en - gagement are theoretically better suited to host citizen engagement and reach a more diverse citizen cohort that goes beyond physical face - to - face activities , particularly in terms of overcoming social biases in rhetorical skill [ 92 ] and availability [ 41 ] . Digital citizen engagement platforms difer in terms of the degree of citizen involvement they support and their role within a public engagement process [ 89 ] . How platforms raise the participatory agency of citizens is typically assessed in reference to the ’ladder of citizen participation’ [ 6 ] , ranging from being manipulated to having full control . However , this ladder framework fails to account for real - world complexities [ 105 ] , as lower levels of involvement ( e . g . informing or consulting ) may still contribute to the development of a sense of community and commitment , and thus hold potential for longer - term paradigm shifts in policy - making [ 30 ] . Consequently , citizen crowd - sourcing applications ( e . g . [ 81 ] ) are well suited for the early stages of a public engagement process , yet typically ofer only low levels of involvement . On the other hand , online workshops ( e . g . [ 76 ] ) or idea collection applications ( e . g . [ 83 ] ) tend to ofer a higher degree of involvement . While it is promised to overcome diferences in skill and availabil - ity [ 72 ] , digital types of citizen engagement still face the so - called ’digital divide’ [ 78 ] that is particularly prevalent within low - income and ethnically - diverse neighbourhoods [ 79 ] . Yet it is also argued that digital technology by itself can probably never overcome the real civic challenges in marginalised communities , as long as those citizens continue to lack social relationships with top - down stake - holders due to years of educational , employment , and economic disenfranchisement [ 37 ] . 2 . 2 Physically Situated Public Surveys Within the broader domain of Urban HCI [ 39 ] , it has been argued that physically situated interactive interfaces [ 18 , 108 ] are able to gather more responses from citizens by imposing a sense of urgency that is stronger when the issue is experienced in - situ , rather than imagined in hindsight [ 48 ] . Situated public survey platforms have been demonstrated to extend the social reach of engagement [ 111 ] , gather more responses compared to entirely online alternatives [ 26 , 48 ] , and motivate citizens by grounding interaction in a spatial context that is immediately relevant to the survey [ 49 ] , all matters that are particularly relevant for urban planning [ 74 ] . Although they typically facilitate a lower level of participatory agency than online alternatives [ 36 , 38 ] , situated public survey plat - forms are more pragmatic because they can reach their audience opportunistically , i . e . citizens do not need to consciously reserve time or register before engagement and anonymously [ 54 ] . Conse - quently , such platforms have queried passers - by about contextu - ally grounded issues via animated projections [ 106 ] , electronically - augmented posters [ 111 ] , touch - enabled LCD displays [ 54 ] , or low - power e - ink displays equipped with push - buttons [ 28 ] . Knowing that personal smartphones are the most common form of interaction with citizen engagement technology in public space [ 25 ] , QR - codes may present a valuable opportunity to nudge passers - by to visit websites at certain locations . While the public adoption of QR - code scanning was limited due to poor execution and lack of general awareness [ 21 ] , it has become more widely accepted since the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 3 ] insofar that it can be integrated in video games that foster social cohesion on a neighbourhood scale [ 98 ] . 2 . 3 Middle - Out Public Surveys Citizen engagement platforms can experience a loss of trust and engagement when deployed from the top - down [ 82 ] . A ’middle - out’ approach on the other hand , embraces the position of middle stakeholders who have the potential to facilitate processes that connect stakeholders on opposite sides of the power scale [ 34 ] . As such , middle - out stakeholders can be successful enablers and medi - ators of change , for instance by bridging between stakeholders and providing a platform where bottom - up experiences are collected to be analyse and refect upon by the local authority [ 35 ] . When this approach is used to design citizen engagement in particular , it can be either initiated by top - down stakeholders and supported 2575 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Paul Biedermann , Jorgos Coenen , Dries De Roeck , Andrew Vande Moere First contact to OBK Jan .

Middle - out cit - izen engagement may even support the development of disaster resilient cities by strengthening social capital and promoting col - laborations [ 53 ] . However , middle - out stakeholders also have their own agenda and interests that have to be acknowledged [ 58 ] . In a substantial sample of citizen engagement technology studies , many gatekeeping activities seem bottom - up , but are actually performed by academic researchers from the top - down [ 12 ] . Middle - out approaches ideally involve citizens and top - down stakeholders throughout the design , infrastructuring and deploy - ment phases of a citizen engagement process [ 40 ] . During the design phase , most middle - out approaches use workshops to co - design urban technologies [ 114 ] and journalistic methods , such as inter - views with citizens , to design novel concepts of urban technologies [ 104 ] . During the infrastructuring phase , middle - out approaches in - clude workshops to open up content - creation to community groups [ 71 ] and to fabricate prototypes of the engagement technology it - self [ 102 ] using custom kits [ 103 ] . During the deployment phase , citizens can promote the survey and share inquiries by hosting the technology ( e . g . on their home facade [ 24 ] or storefront [ 71 ] ) and personally inviting engagement , to build direct connections with other community members . Content control patterns that pro - vide ‘citizen - ’ or ‘community - control’ [ 115 ] and share moderation among a larger subset of citizens likewise ft within a middle - out approach during the deployment . Based on a convenience sample of 11 studies of comparable public survey platforms , Table 1 indicates that middle - out is typically manifested during infrastructuring ( e . g . [ 42 ] ) or inquiry sharing ( e . g . [ 99 ] ) , and that the most gatekeeping activities require the support or supervision by top - down academic researchers ( marked with an asterisk ) . 2 . 4 Synthesising Public Survey Content Despite the success of public survey platforms in collecting sub - stantial amounts of citizen engagement content , civic stakeholders struggle with making sense of this content [ 73 ] . Both bottom - up and top - down stakeholders face difculties in synthesising survey content , with the former being hindered by a lack of data visuali - sation and comparison features [ 7 ] and the latter limited by their data literacy and resources [ 26 ] . Hence , new digital data analysis and visualisation tools should be developed to reduce the time , efort , and expertise required to process survey data for top - down stakeholders [ 59 ] . For bottom - up stakeholders , it has been shown that machine learning algorithms that analyse survey content can also be combined with creative art approaches to make complex concepts and visualisations accessible to citizens [ 22 ] . More in line with a middle - out approach , co - located and hands - on collaborative synthesis activities have shown to democratise the sense - making process , such as by co - creating physical representations of data as boundary objects [ 84 ] , or actively guiding interactions with data visualisations through conversations with an expert [ 112 ] . 3 POSTERTALK This Section describes the neighborhood community context in which PT was designed and deployed , the positionality of the au - thors , the technical functionalities , and the gatekeeping workfow it facilitated . 3 . 1 Context PT was conceptualised in close collaboration with a non - formalised neighbourhood committee that is commonly abbreviated as ’OBK’ . Originally founded in 2007 as a merger of 10 diferent street com - mittees , OBK is led by nine core members that make up its steering committee . OBK aims to represent the citizens of a sub - municipality of approximately 30 . 000 inhabitants , within a mid - sized city in Bel - gium , with the primary objective to infuence local mobility policies . OBK’s main activities consist of organising consultation events , petitions and protests , during which they are typically able to collect the input of hundreds of local citizens . Some of their more recent achievements include successfully advocating for stricter speed limits [ 64 ] , proposing innovative solutions that limit cut - through trafc [ 63 ] , and publishing a report on their website written by citizens , experts and municipal workers that details mobility issues plaguing the neighbourhood [ 62 ] . As such , we claim that OBK operates from the middle - out , as they actively use locally available knowledge and resources to mediate between local citizens and the city council . Faced with a far - reaching circulation redevelopment proposal by the city council in 2021 , OBK became interested to particularly engage citizens that were still outside of their existing network , and widen its activist scope beyond that of mobility alone . Realising that the public attendance of its yearly in - person citizen consultation event would be severely hampered by the strict COVID - 19 regulations advising against mass events , they felt compelled to consider a digital approach . 2576 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Response Local Agenda Valid Response NeighbourhoodCommittee Create Create S h a r e C u r a t e S u b m i t Submit Citizens M o d e r a t e P o li c y P r o p o s a l Workshop 2 Kick - oﬀ Flyering Synthesise Infrastructure Share Curate Workshop 1 x Link Poster PT Platform Inquiry Synthesise Figure 3 : The PT public survey platform and its gatekeeping activities . Some gatekeeping activities could be accessed from the bottom - up by local citizens ( denoted in red ) ; or top - down ( blue ) , by the facilitators of the neighbourhood committee . Gatekeeping activities that were accessed by both sides are " middle - out " . 3 . 2 Co - Design The historical timeline of PT’s development and deployment is illustrated in Figure 2 . Following the middle - out approach of co - designing the infrastructural means , we frst established a set of design requirements for PT in collaboration with OBK during an initial ideation phase of two months . Throughout this phase , we held bi - weekly video - conference meetings with two core members , who were in constant contact with the rest of the steering commit - tee . These meetings typically lasted between one and two hours and included interviews and interactive design sessions to assess requirements for the platform and to collaboratively map specifc PT features on a Miro board 1 . During these sessions , OBK expressed a desire to collect concrete concerns regarding local mobility , but also to gain insight into broader civic themes that might expand their community activist agenda . As these goals overlapped with our own aim to study the impact of opening multiple gatekeeping activities for citizen engagement , we agreed to implement a work - ing prototype . Towards the end of the ideation phase , the larger committee was invited to an alignment session that was attended by approximately 20 OBK members and supporters . In this session , we presented the Miro board with the design requirements and asked the attendees for feedback to estimate whether the current concept indeed corresponds to their needs in surveying local citizens . During the infrastructuring phase , we iteratively developed pro - totypical features based on the established design requirement . OBK in turn provided feedback in form of email correspondence and the ongoing bi - weekly video - conference meetings . Throughout this process , OBK stressed that citizens should be able to engage fully 1 https : / / www . miro . com anonymously and without any eligibility or registration require - ments whatsoever ; and that all submitted inquiries and responses should be open and permanently accessible to all citizens . After ap - proximately three and a half months , we delivered a frst functional prototype that was initially tested by 16 OBK members during a subsequent alignment session . The fnal prototype was eventually handed to OBK one week prior to the deployment phase , allowing the facilitating committee members to conduct a pilot test within their closed network to familiarise themselves with the platform and its functions . 3 . 3 Positionality Statement This research was conducted in the framework of the CityStory research consortium consisting of six partners , who contacted OBK whether they were interested to participate in a use case study . The CityStory consortium , subsidised by a European funding agency to prototype tools that facilitate citizen - driven storytelling in an urban context , included a popular media institution , an interaction design ofce , an urban design ofce and a university research group . All feld work and hands - on engagement with OBK was primarily conducted by the primary author , who — as a foreign national and resident to a diferent neighbourhood — could be considered an outsider to the local community context . Throughout the co - design process and various community events , he worked to balance his own expertise as a HCI researcher with the needs and perspectives of the neighbourhood committee to ensure that the resulting survey platform was truly collaborative and responsive to the community needs . While the authors did receive various requests from the OBK for specifc design and workfow alterations , they always ap - proached these requests through a critical lens , seeking to ensure 2577 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Paul Biedermann , Jorgos Coenen , Dries De Roeck , Andrew Vande Moere A B C Figure 4 : The PT website .

C ) The inquiry page shows a threaded discussion of all submitted responses to a single inquiry . that the resulting features were in the best interests for the commu - nity but also aligned with the academic research question . In cases where the authors felt that a proposed alteration did not align ( e . g . requiring too much development efort or leading to results that did not pertain middle - out goals ) , they suggested alternative paths where possible . 3 . 4 Platform Figure 3 illustrates how the PT platform manifested a middle - out approach by opening multiple gatekeeping activities that are typi - cally controlled by top - down stakeholders [ 12 ] . On PT , both citizens and OBK facilitators are enabled to independently ’create’ inquiries , ’share’ them and ’submit’ responses to them . Invalid or irrelevant responses would either be ’moderated’ out by OBK facilitators , or not be ’curated’ into a fnal local agenda in collaboration with citizens . Figure 5 : The online dashboard for OBK visualised the evo - lution of page visits , inquiry and response submissions ( per engagement channel ) , poster downloads , and instances of inquiries shared on social media . 3 . 4 . 1 Online Manifestation . As shown in Figure 4 - A , the PT web - site invited any online visitor to create an inquiry in the local language . An inquiry could be recorded as a textual message in the form of a question ( e . g . " Are cameras the solution for cut - through trafc ? " - F11 ) or a proposition ( e . g . " An organised shuttle service , with pick - up points at the carpool parking lots . This shuttle can use its own lane on the motorway . " - C1 ) . Each inquiry was then chrono - logically displayed on the website’s landing page ( Figure 4 - B ) , next to its author , amount of responses and date of submission . Each separate inquiry page ( Figure 4 - C ) allowed any visitor to respond via a textual message to either the original inquiry or any of the other submitted responses in the threaded discussion . In addition , each inquiry page presented three thematically ’related inquiries’ to encourage visitors to contribute to multiple discussions . These pages further provided sharing opportunities to either download an inquiry as a ’poster’ design with a unique QR - code for physical , printed publication ( depicted in Figure 1 ) , or as a digital ’social link’ to be shared via e - mail or popular social media channels . As shown in Figure 5 , OBK facilitators also had access to an online dashboard with data visualisations conveying numerical data about inquiry page visits , responsive submissions and engage - ment channels ( i . e . via QR - codes , direct links or social media ) . The same back - end interface allowed them to unpublish inappropriate inquiries or responses that were deemed ofensive . 3 . 4 . 2 Physical Manifestation . When an inquiry was downloaded as a PDF - fle that could be printed as an A4 or A3 poster , the visitor was prompted to enter the location where they intended to deploy it . Featuring a consistent graphical lay - out that included the ofcial logos of OBK , our university and aforementioned partners , this poster could then be placed in public space , as shown in Figure 1 . Each poster also featured a QR - code that encoded a unique URL that allowed passers - by to directly visit the respective inquiry page and potentially submit a response via their personal smartphone . 2578 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA In addition to inquiry posters , we designed a promotional poster ( visible in Figure 1 C and D ) to be distributed by OBK in advance of the PT deployment . We hypothesised that the physical posters could exploit the situated and opportunistic qualities of public displays [ 48 , 49 ] to create a hyperlocal connection between an inquiry and its physical location . The low - tech and activist approach of putting up posters was already well practised by OBK as a public form of protest and awareness creation . In addition , it was deemed well - suited for the single - family housing typology that is prevalent in the neighbourhood , as many citizens hold the opportunity to place posters at eye - level behind windows or on facades . A ’PT pop up installation’ , which was promoted via OBK’s media channels , and operated by a local shop owner in the cultural centre of the neighbourhood provided free access to a laptop computer , an inkjet printer ( A3 + A4 sizes ) and a laminating machine . 3 . 4 . 3 Technical Implementation . The data processing back - end was implemented as a custom - built PHP application . To comply with GDPR regulation , it was hosted on a virtual machine located on an European server . The server ran its own mySQL database and Apache webserver . The front - end website was based on the open - source CSS framework Bootstrap , while the dashboard visualisa - tions used the open - source visualisation library ‘chart . js’ The PDF posters were created via the PHP library ’mPDF’ for the PDF layout , and ’TC - lib - barcode’ for the on - the - fy QR - code generation . 3 . 5 Deployment PT was deployed for 17 consecutive weeks because OBK asked to extend the originally intended deployment period of two months for another two months in the hope of gathering more responses to the already collected inquiries . 3 . 5 . 1 Content Moderation . To ensure that no content contained inappropriate language or highly controversial opinions , OBK or - ganised a permanency roster to critically moderate any submitted inquiry or response shortly after being published . This system of moderating already submitted content was chosen above approving content before publishing , in order to remove potential engagement barriers . The roster insured that one rotating OBK member took charge , yet was always supported by two peers for advice . OBK divided this work between 11 members who volunteered as ’fa - cilitators’ to actively moderate the survey content via a protected backend , as illustrated in Figure 5 . 3 . 5 . 2 Content Synthesis . During PT’s deployment , OBK initiated , promoted and organised three in - person events . As shown in Figure 2 , we consider these events as part of the general PT approach as they each targeted a specifc middle - out goal . Kick - of event . OBK distributed promotional posters to an - nounce PT and invite citizens to this event . The initial kick - of event , designed to introduce PT and its functionalities to local citi - zens , utilised the well - established practice by OBK to host public activities for general awareness . Due to unforeseen weather condi - tions however , this event attracted only approximately 12 visitors . First synthesis workshop . As OBK felt unsure about PT’s general acceptance after six weeks of deployment , they invited local citizens to discuss preliminary survey content in form of a two hour workshop . During this workshop , OBK presented four inquiries that they curated based on the amount of responses . This caused citizens to question the representativeness ( see Section 5 . 4 ) , and ultimately lead the OBK to abandon the collected content to adopt a more open and transparent synthesis approach in the second workshop . Crowd - sourcing . Urged by OBK , we subsequently set up a cus - tom workfow to circumvent selection bias by allowing citizens to rate each inquiry on a scale from 1 ( less important ) to 5 ( essen - tial ) . This online crowd - sourcing poll was publicly promoted via OBK’s social media channels two weeks before the second synthesis workshop and engaged 121 visitors of which 63 rated all inquiries , resulting in a shortlist of the 10 top - rated inquiries . Second synthesis workshop . The second synthesis workshop was set up to : 1 ) determine the most relevant inquiries from the shortlist and 2 ) discuss their value towards future policy propos - als . After introducing and contextualising the shortlist and their responses , the attendees then used argument mapping [ 88 ] to struc - ture all responses to the selected inquiries . 4 METHODOLOGY 4 . 1 Data Acquisition To facilitate a fuid interaction fow and solve many ethical and GDPR concerns , all interactions on the PT platform were recorded fully anonymously , so that our log data was limited to : when a page was visited , where the visit originated from ( i . e . via poster , shared link or the website directly ) , and when content was created . Because no cookies , profles or logins were stored , individual user behaviour could not be tracked , therefore creating an inquiry or response only required a user name which could be left blank or refect a pseudonym . After submission , each participant was invited to voluntarily share their personal information if they were willing to be interviewed by the researchers . The initial interview requests were sent by e - mail on a weekly basis in English , as the primary author was not fuent in the local language . In an attempt to increase the response rate , later requests included the option to be interviewed in the local language by another researcher . As detailed in Table 2 , we interviewed 24 people from three diferent stakeholder groups : facilitators ( F ) , which we defne as OBK members who actively partook in PT ; citizens ( C ) ; and non - participants ( N ) . The numerical and letter identifers are consistent across interviews and all cited inquiries or responses , and chrono - logically numbered . Taking between 16 minutes ( F5 ) and almost two hours ( F9 ) , each semi - structured interview was voluntarily held in the non - native English , due to the language constraints of the interviewer . Interviewees were asked basic demographic questions , including gender , age , profession ; a self assessment of their techno - logical literacy ; followed by questions regarding their engagement with PT , as well as their relationship to the neighbourhood and OBK . 15 interviews occurred in response to the 67 interview invitations sent to inquiry or response authors , either as physical ( N = 6 ) or video conference ( N = 9 ) meetings . Three interviews were held with citizens who explicitly expressed their disinterest to interact with PT during casual encounters with some of the facilitators .

Two recordings were technically unusable and were restored from memory protocol . The remaining 21 recordings were auto - transcribed , using dedicated transcription software 2 , exported as text fles , and then manually refned . The transcription data was coded following a thematic analysis approach [ 16 ] , using a qual - itative coding software [ 86 ] . The primary author coded a sample of four ( 16 . 67 % of all ) transcripts , by continuously highlighting excerpts relevant to the research question and annotating codes with brief descriptions , resulting in an initial code - book of 44 codes that were tagged over 113 excerpts . An external researcher inde - pendently re - coded these excerpts , following the same set of codes , while taking notes on potentially missing or redundant codes , to estimate the validity of the initial code - book . The inter - coder reliability was determined via percent agreement [ 20 ] . To be considered a match , both coders had to align the exact same set of codes to each excerpt , which resulted in an initial inter - coder reliability of 54 % . During a re - alignment session , fve codes were merged with existing codes and another four were adapted 2 https : / / www . otter . ai in terms of their inclusion criteria , resulting in an updated code - book of 39 unique codes . A second round of coding , following the updated code - book resulted in an inter - coder reliability of 80 . 53 % , which was deemed sufciently accurate to analyse the remaining transcripts . 4 . 3 Content Analysis All inquiries and responses were reviewed and categorised in themes based on their textual description . We also analysed the inquiries that were selected during the synthesis workshops to determine their contextual grounding . Inquiries were deemed contextually grounded if they addressed issues that can be spatially or socially attributed to the neighbourhhod . In contrast , general inquiries tack - led general societal challenges that apply beyond the scope of the neighbourhood . All responses were then coded through fve dimensions that capture the quality of online news comments [ 15 ] . We interpreted the ’argumentation’ dimension in terms of the reasoning behind a response ( coded as 0 = simple statement , 1 = with reasoning , and 2 = with additional evidence ) ; ’civility’ in how far a response was friendly and open to the ongoing debate ( coded as 0 = explicitly ofensive ; 1 = implicitly disrespectful ; and 2 = respectful ) ; ’rele - vance’ as its relation to the debate ( 0 = unrelated response ; and 1 = related ) ; ’orthography’ as the appropriate use of spelling , grammar 2580 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Table 3 : The 41 inquiries created by citizens ( C .

To also capture how much a response agreed with previous responses , we added " opinion " as a sixth dimension ( 0 = contradict , 1 = neutral , and 2 = support ) . resulting in a total of 41 valid inquiries and 420 valid responses , as detailed in Table 3 . The six engagement peaks highlighted in Figure 7 correspond to promotional eforts by the facilitators , including the three organised events , an informal project presentation at a local bar , and a fyer - ing initiative that addressed approximately 450 households . The decreased online engagement after the frst synthesis workshop in week six correlates to the approaching end of the vacation season , which restricted the available time to engage for facilitators and citizens . This decrease might also be due the apparent saturation of new inquiries , causing citizens to contribute to popular inquiries instead : " I considered [ creating an inquiry ] but decided that I prefer using an existing question and enlarge it [ . . . ] as the newer questions that get added get less traction . " - C22 , rather than creating new ones . Finally , the rather contested atmosphere during the frst synthesis workshop diminished the perceived agency of citizens : " I attended all discussion rounds and only at one [ out of three ] I felt that I could bring in my opinion [ . . . ] the others where so narrowly defned that I thought [ OBK ] are just looking for confrmation to their ideas " - C53 . Except of PT’s landing page ( 70 % ) , related inquiries ( 22 % ) played the largest role in generating page visits , while posters and social links constituted 5 % and 3 % respectively , as shown in Figure 6 . Although they played a relatively minor role in engaging citizens to visit PT , the posters ( 8 % ) and social links ( 69 % ) ability to nudge passive visitors into active engagement was signifcantly higher compared to the landing page ( 3 , 5 % ) . 4 . 4 Poster Scouting Posters were canvassed by the primary author while biking through the neighbourhood , capturing their location , inquiry , authorship , and physical context . Due to the relatively large geographic area , a bike tour typically passed along the residences of the facilitators , known poster locations , and the hints provided via the prompt when downloading a poster . 5 RESULTS The following Sections provide a detailed account of our fndings , ranging from the evolution of how citizens engaged with PT , over the inquiries and responses it facilitated , to the motivations for engagement and poster distribution . 5 . 1 Engagement PT collected a total of 51 inquiries and 442 responses via 8472 page visits ( daily avg . 68 , 3 ) during its 17 - week deployment . 10 of these inquiries and 22 responses were unpublished by facilitators as they contained accidental double submissions or technical errors , 5 . 2 Inquiries The inquiries were relatively equally created by citizens ( N = 21 ) and seven of the 11 facilitators ( N = 20 ) . Most inquiries created by facilitators ( N = 16 ) and citizens ( N = 13 ) related to mobility , including the top fve inquiries by the most responses . Notably , these fve inquiries were exclusively created by the facilitators , while the most responded citizen - created inquiries ranked on place six , eight and 13 and also concerned mobility . However , PT also gathered a relatively diverse range of inquiries , spanning a total of 13 distinct themes . Besides the 29 mobility re - lated inquiries , e . g . " Zone 30 is pointless in my opinion , it’s a tax issue and costs money due to the speed - reducing measures . Is a general zone 30 really necessary ? " - C2 ; Other themes featured four planning related inquiries , e . g . " Organic waste collection every other week in summer time is not sufcient at all . It should be once a week at least ! " - C9 ; three inquiries relating to environmental concerns , e . g . Related inquiries Poster Social Website Responses via channel Visits via channel 22 % ( 2564 ) 70 % ( 8239 ) 5 % ( 549 ) 3 % ( 379 ) 50 % ( 218 ) 42 % ( 183 ) 8 % ( 32 ) Figure 6 : Overview of used engagement channels for page visits and response submission . Navigation from the PT plat - form itself generated most of the trafc to inquiry pages , yet 42 % of the responses were submitted by citizens directed to inquiries via social media . 2581 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Paul Biedermann , Jorgos Coenen , Dries De Roeck , Andrew Vande Moere 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Week Pilot Phase 0 0 2 4 6 8 0 100 200 300 400 10 20 30 Kick - oﬀ event Newspaper + tv feature Project presentation Mid - term evaluation Final evaluation Flyering initiative I n q u i r y S u b m i ss i o n s R e s p o n s e S u b m i ss i o n s P a g e v i s i t s Figure 7 : Evolution of daily PT platform engagement , comparing three indicators : 1 . page visits , 2 . inquiry submissions , and 3 . response submissions by OBK facilitators ( purple ) and citizens ( turquoise ) . Engagement on all three graphs shows a strong decline after approximately six weeks , when promotional eforts and events stopped taking place . All three indicators show a similar evolution and engagement peaks that coincide with , or appear in the run - up to events . " Flooding in certain streets can be prevented by more storage and infl - tration . Where are there opportunities on private and public domain ? " - F9 ; and fve socially connected inquiries , e . g . " How do we reconcile social with economic interests ? " - C66 . Two social inquiries directly questioned the representativeness of the OBK and the PT platform : " How do you involve minorities : the elderly , non - native speakers , busy two earners , the less mobile , the less educated . Do we reach these people ? " - C4 and " Are Vorm3010 [ a related survey platform initiated by the city council ] and PosterTalk sufciently democratic to be able to represent the whole of our sub - municipality of 30 , 000 inhabitants ? " - C61 . The thematic coverage was acknowledged by several citizens : " There were quite a number of topics [ . . . ] and I know that those things are really being discussed amongst people for a long time now , so [ . . . ] it seems to be a good representation of what’s happening in [ the the neighbourhood ] . " - N2 . 5 . 3 Responses Gathering approximately seven ( median ) responses per inquiry , around 40 % ( N = 161 ) of all responses were submitted by eight of the 11 facilitators . The large majority of responses : directly related to the inquiries ; contained relatively few orthographic errors ; tried to argue , and partly included additional evidence , as detailed in Table 4 . Although uncivil online commenting behaviour is relatively common [ 100 ] , debates on PT remained civil : " I didn’t see much scamming or hate speech . " - F5 ; " I’m glad that there is a really open Table 4 : Analysis of all PT responses over six dimensions that capture the quality of online news comments [ 15 ] . Most responses related to the inquiries ( n = 339 ) and contained no orthographic errors ( n = 413 ) . This analysis demonstrates that the debate facilitated by PT can be considered supportive and respectful . Category 0 1 2 Average St .

" - C53 . In terms of the submitted opinions , neutral and contradicting responses were fairly balanced , while about twice as many responses were submitted in agreement to previously created content . Out of the contradicting responses , only eight were deemed to be provocative because of sarcasm ( e . g . " What a surprise , suddenly it is unsafe here . . . we have lived at this junction for 11 years , I have never felt unsafe " - C42 ) ; or denunciation ( e . g . " Anyone with common sense 2582 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA will have to admit that with every road you block , you create a problem elsewhere " - C39 ) . Of the eight provocative responses , two were proposed for removal by the moderating facilitators , yet considered to fall within the borders of civility : " The Cyclist Terror ? Zone 30 , bicycle streets and now this ? Have you ever thought of adjusting your speed on your ( electric ) bicycle , just like for cars , to the children playing , etc . " - C15 and " One - way and play streets are by far the most antisocial and simplistic measures you can take against trafc congestion " - anonymous citizen . Although it was not foreseen in the original platform design , we identifed four types of moderation activities that both OBK and citizens engaged in collaboratively : 1 ) asking follow - up questions to minimise uncertainty ( " Do you mean to make it a one way street ? " - anonymous citizen ) ; 2 ) attempting to settle disputes ( " The reason for asking this question was precisely to avoid confict . " - F4 ) ; 3 ) referring to existing inquiries if themes were repeatedly discussed ( " This question has actually already been asked [ refers to previous inquiry ] , with many reactions . " - C11 ) ; and 4 ) providing external information to support ongoing debates ( " The playing streets themselves are easy to fnd out : [ link to website of the police ] " - C53 ) . 5 . 4 Synthesis Workshops The frst synthesis workshop was based on a selection of four inquiries , which were curated by the OBK solely based on the amount of responses they had triggered . Some of the approximately 20 attending participants yet unexpectedly pointed out the implicit bias of this selection , insofar that the selected inquiries turned out to be all created by facilitators and exclusively focused on ( motorised ) trafc ( e . g . " Are cameras the solution for cut through trafc ? " ) - despite the diverse range of remaining themes in PT , as described in Section 5 . 2 . This discussion triggered sufcient internal refection within OBK to abandon their gatekeeping approach and instead adopt a more open and transparent synthesis strateg for the second workshop . The second synthesis workshop opened up the inquiry selection process via a public online crowd - sourcing poll , producing a list of 10 top - rated inquiries . Besides fve inquiries about motorised trafc , newly surfaced themes included cycling ( e . g . " Help ! Where can we safely store bicycles belonging to families ? There are no bicycle sheds in terraced houses [ . . . ] . " ) and air quality ( e . g . " In which streets should the air quality ( nitrogen ) be measured ? " ) . Six of these top - rated inquiries were contextually grounded ( e . g . " A zebra crossing / bicycle crossing over the [ anonymised street ] near the [ anonymised street ] would be nice . " ) . Perhaps surprisingly , the three fnal inquiries that were chosen during the workshop turned out to be about motorised mobility : 1 ) " How can we keep motorised trafc on the main roads and on [ anonymised street ] instead of letting them drive through the residen - tial streets ? " , 2 ) " Turn impacted streets back into residential streets = provide more approach and arterial roads in [ anonymised ] . " , and 3 ) Do you support trajectory control ? How do we check " zone 30 " ? . 5 . 5 Engagement Motivations Of the interviewees who initiated an inquiry ( N = 13 ) , 10 did so to raise awareness around issues they felt related to in their neighbour - hood : " The reason why I came up with this question [ . . . ] is because a friend of mine just told me that she almost hit a bike there " - C25 . Five interviewees reported to create inquiries in order to engage others in the neighbourhood : " My day job is to facilitate people in order to become proprietors of their own surroundings , so to promote partic - ipation " - C66 . Such content ranged from contextually grounded inquiries intended to improve a given issue in the neighbourhood ( e . g " How can we transform our central square into a real neighbour - hood centre and meeting place ? " - F6 ) , to broader and more open ended inquiries ( e . g . " How can we achieve a modal and mental shift ? " - F2 ) . Of the interviewees who responded to inquiries ( N = 16 ) , 10 re - ported their motivation to solve current issues by either supporting or opposing previous ideas : " I wanted to express the importance and the gravity of the issue [ . . . ] so therefore , [ I responded because ] I thought it was important to support the issue even more " - C18 . Content of this kind included constructive suggestions in the form of additional information or references ( e . g . " Private owners have to install an infltration pit with a capacity that is proportional to the paved surface . The government should do the same for paved public grounds . " - F3 ) , but also subjective expressions , such as personal opinions ( e . g . " Just paint on bicycle paths and cars will adapt . No fuss just do it . " - C44 ) . The disparity in thematic knowledge between facilitators and citizens sometimes hampered citizens to respond to inquiries : " That was part of my hesitation [ . . . ] I felt like there was a lot of expertise behind the replies , so I was reluctant [ to engage ] to not be ridiculed . " - C5 . In addition , some citizens felt that certain topics were inun - dated with comments from facilitators , causing them to doubt the openness of PT to outside opinions : " I feel that they killed the process themselves , I mean look at these threads , one of them ends with fve comments of OBK members " - C53 . Some interviewed citizens reported that previous encounters with public survey platforms afected their belief in PT to neutrally intermediate between them and the city council . For instance , when they doubted the representativeness of such platforms and believed they " did not take into account certain parts of the demographic " - C4 . Previous experiences with OBK impacted citizens’ perception of PT when their own political agendas collided with those of the facilitators : " I don’t agree at all with this [ . . . ] they [ OBK ] said to the politicians , that the neighbours wanted a general 30 km / h speed limit and that’s not right . " - C2 , which even caused others to question PT’s neutrality : " The feeling that I always have , is that the city and those initiatives are actually in this fnancing thing . " - C13 . Finally , lack of representativeness on the survey platform re - duced trust in its efcacy : " If you see a lot of the ideas , it’s from a single sided view , from a certain part of the demographic [ . . . ] but if you want to gain traction with things like this , you need to appeal to a wider audience . " - C4 . Nine interviewees ( N = 24 ) further men - tioned to particularly engage with PT when they noted a lack of representation of certain social groups : " If I see that ideas are actu - ally conficting with other inhabitants , or are very narrow minded , I always fnd it a bit of a shame and I try to understand what is the motivation behind it . " - C4 This led some citizens to perceive the neighbourhood committee as complacent : " I think , they [ OBK ] say the things they want to do , but they do not take into account a lot of people and use cases " - N1 . 2583 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Paul Biedermann , Jorgos Coenen , Dries De Roeck , Andrew Vande Moere N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 4 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 1 1 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 7 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 2 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 6 C E N T E R N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 6 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 1 1 C E N T E R N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 7 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 2 N E I G H B O U R H O O D A 4 16 2 5 2 2 2 2 16 5 2 2 2 2 2 0 100 200 500 1 . 000 m N E I G H B O U R H O O D 1 N E I G H B O U R H O O D 2 C E N T E R N E I G H B O U R H O O D 3 N E I G H B O U R H O O D 4 N E I G H B O U R H O O D 5 16 2 5 2 2 2 2 16 5 2 2 2 2 2 0 100 200 500 1 . 000 m Figure 8 : Overview of the canvassed poster dissemination , suggesting how the geographic distribution of posters is linked to the locations of facilitator residences . The red markers indicate promotional posters ( without inquiries ) , while the orange markers carry citizen - created inquiries . The transparent orange circles indicate a proximity to facilitator residences . Numbers indicate where multiple posters overlap on the map . Note that this map represent all ( encountered ) posters , including those that were removed throughout the deployment . 5 . 6 Posters As postering in public space was generally prohibited by the mu - nicipality , OBK decided to deploy a total of 13 promotional posters on the neighbourhood notice boards under their control . In total 834 posters were downloaded , of which 41 were discovered during the poster canvassing tours , as detailed in Figure 8 . The posters were disseminated in a polycentric manner through - out the neighbourhood , concentrated nearby the residences of fa - cilitators , highlighting how they infuenced the poster distribution . Some posters related to the immediate physical context : " It’s [ the poster ] been in the street here [ . . . ] because I know that this is a question that has been launched in here . " - F11 . In detail , 22 posters ( N = 41 ) showed a loose relationship to their location ( e . g . poster inquiries for novel ways of enforcing speed limits , deployed in a zone 30 street ) ; 3 posters directly referred to their location ( e . g . “How can we make the intersection at Platte Lostraat - Koetsweg - Verenig - ingstraat - Ontvoogdingstraat safe ? ” , deployed at the corresponding intersection ) ; and 16 posters showed no signifcant relationship . While the idea of sharing posters for public surveying was mostly perceived positive by citizens : " I like putting [ a poster ] behind the window . We live in a street where quite a lot of people pass by . " - C4 , some facilitators raised concerns regarding their lack of efcacy : " You need the scale of what’s going on during the elections , [ . . . ] So we’ll never reach that . That’s impossible . " - F4 . In contrast , citizens who did encountered a poster reported that posters functioned as active motivators for engagement : " [ He ] sometimes e - mails information that is related to that sort of thing [ . . . ] . But I also saw a poster at his door or his window . So these are the two things that reminded me that I should give this a try . " - C25 . The relative scarcity of poster dissemination and few page visits via posters ( see Section 5 . 1 ) may be best explained by the social inhibition to interact within public space [ 19 ] , as exemplifed by N2 : " And then there was like a QR - code . You have to walk up to the tree and like , everybody sees that you’re going to the tree [ . . . ] . I never scan the code , and that’s where it stops for me " - N2 . During our observations , we did not note any citizens engaging with the PT pop up installation . This lack of interest could be caused by the required efort and potentially even the social embarrassment to visit this facility . 2584 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA 5 . 7 Local Agenda The PT deployment had direct impact on the organisation of the neighbourhood committee , and has sparked specifc political ac - tions by the committee and citizens . Within the committee , the critique of citizens regarding OBK’s representativeness ( see Section 6 . 3 ) nudged OBK to limit claims on their website regarding who they represent . In addition , the composition of members has changed in response to PT . Two members voluntarily joined the steering committee to work on topics from the emerging local agenda ( i . e . public transport , a theme highlighted by citizen as shown in Table 3 ) and new members started attending meetings after becoming aware of OBK through PT ( One of my neighbours is an expert in mobility [ . . . ] he was receiving my [ PT social link ] and asked a lot of things and [ . . . ] now he is going to the OBK - A4 ) . We also found that one core OBK member has left the committee . Although we cannot conclusively attribute this outcome to PT , he claimed OBK did not represent the needs of the entire neighbourhood . While OBK expressed the intend to translate more inquiries into political actions , this is a gradual and time - consuming process . Three months after the deployment , selected inquiries from the second synthesis workshop were used to discuss stricter speed limitations in the neighbourhood during a public debate evening with a local politician . PT also afected some individual citizens , as at least one contacted the national roads and trafc agency to request an additional pedestrian cross - walk after having learned about this opportunity on the PT platform . 6 DISCUSSION By relating and opening each gatekeeping activity for citizens and facilitators , Figure 9 proposes a generalised middle - out framework for public surveys . This framework encompasses the two main con - tributions of this paper : it proposes an ideal gatekeeping activity workfow for public surveying and depicts four major considera - tions to how opening up gatekeeping activities impacts the process , the stakeholders and the content . As we also demonstrated in Table 1 , identifying the distinct gatekeeping activities makes it possible to pinpoint and even benchmark the level of participatory agency aforded by various other public survey platforms . We believe it also enables future practitioners to conceptualise novel middle - out tools and methods , and researchers to identify potential gaps in litera - ture . Based on the PT study use case , the framework illustrates the impact of middle - out gatekeeping activities , as we discovered that : 1 ) due to the more diverse motivations of citizen engagement , the resulting inquiries , responses and agendas became diversifed too ; despite that 2 ) some gatekeeping activities were appropriated by OBK ; which was 3 ) perceived as a top - down stakeholder by citizens ; who in turn 4 ) nudged them to introspect their mediating civic role . With the aim to support practitioners in integrating middle - out approaches in future citizen engagements , we detail each of these impacts alongside a critical middle - out guideline . 6 . 1 Middle - out Diversifes Local Agendas Our results suggest that opening up gatekeeping activities diver - sifed each gatekeeping outcome . In lack of a clear baseline , we ground this claim on a variety of independent indicators that to - gether demonstrate how citizens were empowered to refect be - yond the previous civic agenda of OBK . For instance , citizens felt diversely motivated to engage with PT ( see Section 5 . 5 ) , they sub - mitted ( see Section 5 . 2 ) and shared ( Section 5 . 1 ) inquiries that were thematically diverse , which in turn provoked responses with diverse levels of agreement ( see Section 5 . 3 ) , resulting in a local agenda with a more diverse set of themes ( see Table 3 ) . Motivation . Citizens conveyed diferent motivations to explain their engagement with PT , and appreciated that it collected a multi - tude of " . . . real living and actual concerns and it’s not something that comes only from one person - C18 . The nine interviewees ( N = 24 ) who engaged because they perceived inequalities in the responses , and the two inquiries that questioned the representativeness of PT itself , suggest that PT was sufciently open to surface self - critical concerns that balance the debate . These fndings broaden the ex - isting collection of socio - cultural motivators for citizens to engage in bottom - up initiatives , like from community gardening [ 113 ] or mobile sensing initiatives [ 70 ] , with a balancing and a self - critical dimension . Inquiries . Approximately a third of all inquiries ( 12 , N = 41 ) , in Table 3 introduced social and environmental challenges , that reach beyond OBK’s previous civic agenda around mobility . Because these inquiries were framed from the real - life context of the neighbour - hood , we claim that they represent contextually - grounded concerns : e . g . " The bike lane at the community centre is not safe nearby the opportunities for recreation - suggestions for improvements ? " - F4 or " Many youth camps depart from the parking near the insurance company , resulting in heavy trafc . Can these depart from [ . . . ] outside the residential area ? " - C1 . In contrast , comparable studies on pub - lic surveying requested responses to general inquiries , framed by top - down stakeholders , such as a city council querying citizens to share personal stories regarding their energy consumption to raise awareness for climate change [ 44 ] or government representatives asking for input on their political agenda [ 104 ] . Responses . The relative diversity of ’opinions’ in Table 4 sug - gests how citizens felt empowered to agree with but also object against particular inquiries . Because these responses denote dif - ferent opinionated perspectives , we claim PT avoided so - called ’pseudo - participation’ , a phenomenon that sometimes appears dur - ing predefned public surveys when citizens perceive a lack of afordances that allow meaningful engagement [ 80 ] . Sharing . A substantial portion ( 42 % ) of the submitted responses resulted from social links , which were shared with peer citizens ( see Figure 6 ) . The self - organising and bottom - up power of social media is well - known , as it allows quality content to be fltered by way of memetic propagation [ 77 ] , sharing [ 17 ] and voting [ 67 ] . We believe that the relatively minor dissemination via poster shares ( see Figure 8 ) can be partially explained by how their locations identifed their authorship , which has been demonstrated to be a social inhibitor [ 24 , 106 ] . Yet , their ability to nudge visitors to submit responses ( 8 % ) compared to the PT website ( 3 , 5 % ) confrms how situating content in local contexts is crucial to broaden participation [ 82 ] . Demographics . We were unable to ascertain whether the citizen cohort was socio - demographically diversifed , as all engagement occurred fully anonymously . There were also no explicit traces of inquiries or responses that were foregrounding issues pertinent to 2585 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Paul Biedermann , Jorgos Coenen , Dries De Roeck , Andrew Vande Moere Citizens Inquiry Platform Response Local Agenda Infrastructure Create Facilitators Share Submit Curate Curate Moderate Share Submit Moderate Create Valid Response Dissemination 2 .

Diversify content Figure 9 : The middle - out framework describes how opening up the gatekeeping activities towards citizens impacted the public survey process . The four grey areas correspond to the respective middle - out guidelines described within the frst four discussion points . particular socio - demographic groups . Similar to what related litera - ture reported so far ( e . g . [ 109 , 110 ] ) , our interviewees tended to con - sist of middle - aged , male and well - educated individuals ( 14 , N = 24 ) . While this interview participant bias can be partially explained by availability bias [ 72 ] and / or the non - native English interview requests , that are potential burdens for minorities , our fndings do not contain clear evidence that PT succeeded in engaging socio - demographic groups that are known to be hard to reach , including migrants [ 79 ] , the poor [ 69 ] or the youth [ 55 ] . 6 . 1 . 1 Middle - out guideline : When a facilitator wishes to diversify their civic agenda in terms of content generation , engagement mo - tivation and reach through sharing , we recommend to particularly open up the creation of inquiries and their public dissemination , next to the commonly open submission of responses . Facilitators should yet realise that opening up these gatekeeping activities also means that the diversifed content might misalign or contradict with their original motivation , or even the survey intention , insofar that the power to subvert the survey in itself forms a motivating factor to engage . Future work may investigate how middle - out en - gagement can still be limited within a predefned civic agenda . For instance , it is uncertain whether a more strict thematic scope that is consistently enforced via middle - out moderation would also de - rive more diversifed inquiries within that theme . Similarly , further investigations could focus whether participation could be more socio - demographically diversifed by ofering a wider range of tech - nological engagement channels of varying degrees of involvement [ 68 , 89 ] that are co - designed with these groups . Finally , the geo - graphical distribution of posters might improve by allowing the stakeholders to print and deploy a general promotional call instead of a potentially opinionated inquiry through which authorship may be implied towards the residence owner . 6 . 2 Middle - out Is ( Unintentionally ) Appropriated The interactions between the facilitators on PT , the deployment of posters , and the curation before the frst synthesis workshop show how OBK unintentionally appropriated some gatekeeping activities by foregrounding themes that aligned more with their own civic agenda . Platform interactions . As detailed in Table 3 , inquiries submit - ted by facilitators generally triggered more responses than those submitted by citizens . While this suggests that the OBK’s thematic focus corresponded well with bottom - up issues , it yet leaves the possibility open that citizens with unrelated inquiries felt not suf - ciently empowered to raise them on a survey that , to some , seemed to focus on OBK’s mobility centred agenda . However , the Table further indicates how facilitator created responses were primarily ( 75 % ) directed towards their own or inquiries from other facilitators . This sustained a quantifable - yet therefore not representative - perception that some inquiries were deemed more relevant than others . For instance , the top - fve most responded inquiries were all created by facilitators , probably because at least a quarter of their responses were authored by other facilitators . Although this phenomenon validates how survey engagement is not driven by the most innovative ideas , but by the party with the best abilities to persuade others [ 96 ] , it equally seems natural for OBK to par - ticularly focus their eforts on the inquiries that aligned with their own skills , interests and availability [ 89 ] . 2586 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Poster dissemination . As shown in Figure 8 , posters were polycentrically deployed around the residences of OBK facilitators , suggesting that they used their social network to motivate imme - diate neighbours and acquaintances . Not surprisingly , posters sha near facilitator residences also featured inquiries that aligned with OBK’s civic agenda ( 26 , N = 41 ) . First synthesis workshop . The facilitators curated themes to be discussed during the frst synthesis workshop solely based on the number of responses to each submitted inquiry . Despite that ap - proximately half of all inquiries were created by citizens and a third did not concern mobility , the selected inquiries exclusively related to ( motorised ) trafc , and happened to be created by facilitators . Furthermore , these curated inquiries addressed general concerns , instead of focusing on more contextually grounded issues that were specifc to the spatial and social context of the neighbourhood . Although it has been argued that expert - driven curation processes achieve high levels of feasibility to implement the selected ideas [ 96 ] , curation by an organising party naturally introduces their bias . Realising that curation should not be solely based on quantifcation , and refecting upon the requests from OBK to help them make a more representative selection , there seems to be an opportunity to develop new technological tools that specifcally target making curation as transparent and accountable as possible . Second synthesis workshop . Integrating a middle - out ap - proach by crowd - sourcing the curation gatekeeping activity diver - sifed the resulting civic agenda , insofar that six of the 10 selected inquiries were contextually grounded ; and fve originated from citizens and related to themes beyond OBK’s agenda . We argue that contextual grounded inquiries exhibit bottom - up qualities , insofar that the ’situatedness’ refects strong spatial or social connections to a specifc place [ 49 ] . While it seems logical for facilitators to fo - cus their eforts on more general societal inquiries , as to represent a larger cross - section of a population , local citizens may be more inclined to engage with inquiries they can directly relate to . 6 . 2 . 1 Middle - out guideline : We propose that ( unintentional ) middle - out appropriation could be avoided by engaging citizens - or a neu - tral party - in gatekeeping , particularly during the moderation and curation activities . Our experience in the second workshop also sug - gests that there exists a lack of technological tools that allow textual content to be moderated and curated in a fully transparent way . As demonstrated when local citizens maintained a village photo [ 101 ] or textual [ 115 ] public display , the joint efort of citizens could be considered neutral due to their intrinsic motivation to better their own personal environment [ 29 ] . Alternatively , a third party , like ur - ban planners , architects , citizen engagement service providers [ 58 ] or academic researchers [ 35 , 40 ] could well oversee gatekeeping activities in a neutral way . This yet also means that a governmental body could potentially be considered to take on this responsibility , particularly at earlier stages in the citizen engagement process [ 89 ] when the debate would not yet be opinionated , such as to gather bottom - up ideas [ 72 , 96 ] or crowd - source urban observations [ 9 ] . 6 . 3 Middle - out Is Perceived as Top - down PT was mostly perceived as a positive citizen engagement initia - tive , being " free from the suspicion that it is a tool from the city to keep everyone quiet " - C23 . Yet , some expressed more critical opinions : " Is PT sufciently democratic to be able to represent the whole [ Neighbourhood ] with 30 , 000 inhabitants ? " - A61 , based on the perception that OBK acted in a top - down , and therefore not fully democratic manner . While it is known that top - down appropriation tends to erode bottom - up engagement because of tensions between empowerment and austerity [ 34 ] , it also reduces public trust in the efcacy of citizen engagement [ 104 ] in general . Our fndings thus contribute three new inhibiting engagement factors of citizen engagement : Agency . Previous experience with top - down citizen engage - ment initiatives led citizens to doubt their participatory agency , for instance when such initiatives " focused too much on people that only work [ but do not live ] in the neighbourhood " - C4 , which also decreased their believe to gain agency by engaging with PT . Ownership . Personal emotions about a stakeholder both pro - mote [ 1 ] and inhibit partaking in citizen engagement . We found that negative opinions about OBK , which were sometimes grounded in absence or delays in following up on previous actions , discouraged some citizens to support any of their initiatives : " [ OBK ] don’t expect any reaction [ . . . ] They don’t react , or even do the opposite " - C2 . Representativeness . Some citizens felt discouraged to engage , because they expected OBK to include all socio - demographic layers of the neighbourhood , which PT inherently lacked due to technical , social and language barriers , e . g . [ cynical : ] " In your own street you know where the non - native speakers live , you can ring the doorbell there to explain what it is about " - C47 ) . These three inhibitors link to the notion of accountability [ 90 ] , as the OBK facilitators had full agency over PT despite being nei - ther elected , nor being directly answerable about any consequences . Even opening all gatekeeping activities to citizens , as recommended in the frst discussion point , would most likely establish an unac - countable hierarchy , as the citizens with the best ability to mobilise others have the strongest impact on citizen engagement [ 96 ] . 6 . 3 . 1 Middle - out guideline : As any ubiquitous computing technol - ogy is inherently unable to engage the full breadth of social diversity due to e . g . educational , employment , and economic disenfranchise - ments [ 37 , 69 ] , we argue that striving for full representativeness is not naturally constructive to middle - out integration . We therefore propose that middle - out eforts could instead focus on making all gatekeeping activities transparent , so that any citizen can objec - tively assess the presence of underlying biases during the process . In addition , there should be more attention paid to how citizens can be enticed and technologically empowered to actively engage in gatekeeping , as to become intrinsically motivated to take own actions [ 49 , 93 ] . This transparency starts with publicly conveying the bottom - up agency to promote a locally informed , and thus middle - out , civic agenda , instead of giving the implicit impression that the survey content would be used solely by the facilitators . In practice , promotion should more clearly disclose how citizens co - own the whole gatekeeping process , instead of implying certain ownership via logos of the middle - out stakeholder and partner - ing organisations . Yet transparency is also required in any smaller action within a gatekeeping activity , to at least estimate its underly - ing motivation . For instance , each inquiry , response , moderation or curation action could disclaim clearly whether it originates from a citizen , facilitator or any other involved stakeholder . Ultimately , this 2587 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Paul Biedermann , Jorgos Coenen , Dries De Roeck , Andrew Vande Moere transparency could also enrich the debate with socio - demographic information , such as the age range , geographic area or civic role of the participant . 6 . 4 Middle - out Nudges Introspection Criticism from citizens nudged OBK to self - refect on its own ac - tivist agenda and its mediating role in the neighbourhood . External . Despite that OBK facilitators primarily advocated their civic agenda , the citizen - generated content nudged them to adjust their activist points to some extent . For instance , we observed how some facilitators publicly revised their opinion on PT ( although anonymously ) due to citizen responses : " I want to take back part of my words : I’m not so much saying that the cameras must be there , I think above all the idea should be thoroughly examined " - F11 and " I am not arguing for ad hoc interventions to turn certain streets into bicycle streets , but the city must start with a clear , future - oriented vision for mobility . " - F8 . Internal . OBK scrutinised their participatory agency by in - ternally discussing the dashboard visualisations of their own re - sponses , fuelling a debate about their dual civic role : " For me , a facilitator who moderates is normally not participating in the whole thing [ . . . ] but if you’re answering questions , you have an opinion , and you have to come out for your opinion . " - F4 . This is further evidenced by the changed composition of their steering committee discussed in Section 5 . 7 , and by the proposal of three OBK facilitators to redo the synthesis workshop to address the bias discussed in Section 6 . 2 . 6 . 4 . 1 Middle - out guideline : We suggest that middle - out public sur - veys form a suitable method to enrich or re - calibrate a civic agenda through introspection . We have demonstrated how internal refec - tion and external critique can catalyse this introspection during middle - out surveys in distinct ways . In particular , we propose to gather high - level demographic information and engagement sta - tistics that can then be visualised alongside the gathered survey content [ 59 ] to uncover any potential bias within the gatekeeping activities and the local agenda itself . These visualisations should then be iteratively considered throughout the process , particularly during critical moments such as the content curation and synthesis . We further propose that introspection can be encouraged through opportunities for external critique aforded by opening up the gate - keeping activities . In this way , the survey content might reveal critical and even adversary opinions to the facilitator’s aims , that are yet equally important to consider when defning civic agen - das that are truly informed from the middle - out . Consequently , it is essential that there is room for thematic diversifcation , that facilitators are prepared to accept critique , and the agency of all stakeholders is clearly communicated . Any insights derived from external critique should then be communicated back to citizens in a constructive feedback loop to continuously build trust between stakeholders over time . 6 . 5 Role and Agency of the Researchers PT challenged our own academic agency in the citizen engagement process . While our involvement was indeed initially limited to in - frastructuring and solving technical issues , we felt obliged to step up to a more active role when OBK explicitly asked for our support due to being critiqued after the frst synthesis workshop . Not only did this occurrence foreground some critical middle - out shortcom - ings in our PT prototype , it also made us realise that this type of democratic tools might always require some type of overseeing guidance to negotiate power imbalances . It demonstrated how our use case conditions resembled those of action - research [ 52 ] , as our ( in ) actions mattered more substantially than those of short and small - scale in - the - wild [ 8 ] studies . These real - life sensitivities are increasingly acknowledged in HCI research , as we move towards considering the impact of technological solutions beyond project conclusions and the tensions between researchers and collaborators [ 2 ] . 6 . 6 Limitations We note that although a middle - out approach strives to include bottom - up and top - down stakeholders in all stages of the citizen en - gagement process [ 43 ] , we were unable to actively involve citizens in the infrastructuring stage of PT . Secondly , despite our best eforts to conceptualise PT as inclusive as possible , certain demographics might have been implicitly excluded by its design . For instance , pre - senting the platform only in the local language naturally restricted access to non - native speakers , so that only one single inquiry was created in English . Thirdly , the requirement to use digital technolo - gies to engage with PT suggests that we could not overcome the digital divide , and the availability of the ’PT pop - up installation’ was not able to remedy this . Finally , although we strongly believe this was not the case , it is impossible for us to ensure that no facili - tators acted covertly , or that no citizens monopolised the survey results due to how all interactions with PT were designed to be fully anonymous . 6 . 7 Future work While our study primarily focused on the engagement between the middle - out OBK and bottom - up local citizens , the potential role of true top - down stakeholders , such as the city council , still requires further research . Such work could potentially address new ways of engaging top - down stakeholders in middle - out engagement , such as to increase the potential that the citizen - created content can and will be considered in meaningful ways . Possible future directions include conducting co - design sessions with top - down stakeholders to account for their needs , or giving them access to the PT platform to also take responsibility in the gatekeeping activities . Investigating how our middle - out framework can be applied to other platforms and use - cases could further help to extend or validate the main fndings of our study . Longer term deployments could assess PT’s capacities to not only challenge existing power dynamics among diferent stakeholder groups but also sustain civic engagement over time . Finally , further studies could focus on integrating privacy - aware ways of revealing socio - demographic information , so that the needs of specifc — and potentially underrepresented — groups could be better foregrounded , not only for research purposes but also to establish more transparency and accountability in middle - out gatekeeping . 2588 PosterTalk : Expanding Participatory Agency in Public Survey Platforms via Middle - Out Gatekeeping DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA 7 CONCLUSION A middle - out approach to public surveying aims to reconcile the intentions and contextual knowledge of top - down and bottom - up stakeholders to inform public decision making . The proposed public survey platform ’PosterTalk’ provides a collaborative environment for this approach by design . Based on an in - the - wild deployment , this work reports on a four - month period , during which we studied the interactions facilitated by PT between a neighbourhood com - mittee , and local citizens . Based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative result analysis , we refect our fndings in the form of a middle - out public survey framework . This framework depicts the relevant gatekeeping activities for public survey platforms that can be used to benchmark similar systems , and highlights four critical design guidelines . As such , we demonstrated how a middle - out approach impacted : 1 ) the diversity of the generated survey content and motivations of citizens , which caused the neighbourhood com - mittee to 2 ) ( unintentionally ) appropriate the platform by focusing eforts on their own activist agenda , leading citizens to 3 ) question the representativeness of the committee for the entire neighbour - hood , which 4 ) triggered the committee to introspect their medi - ating role . With these guidelines , we provide a starting point to efectively apply a middle - out approach in citizen engagement in general , and public surveying in particular . By demonstrating the real - world impact of a middle - out survey platform and ofering critical design guidelines , we hope our research provides leading lights for how such a design approach can be applied in practice . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all members of the OBK and the involved citizens for their hard work and commitment during our collaboration . Without their willingness to participate and promote PosterTalk in their neighbourhood , this study would not have been possible .
