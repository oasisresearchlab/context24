Schizotypal personality disorder has a strong familial relationship with schizophrenia . Several susceptibility genes for schizophrenia have been related to schizotypal traits . Methods : We first investigated the association of eight linkage disequilibrium - tagging single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that cover the p250GAP gene with schizophrenia in a Japanese sample of 431 schizophrenia patients and 572 controls . We then investigated the impact of the risk genetic variant in the p250GAP gene on schizotypal personality traits in 180 healthy subjects using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire . Results : We found a significant difference in genotype frequency between the patients and the controls in rs2298599 ( x 2 = 17 . 6 , p = 0 . 00015 ) . The minor A / A genotype frequency of rs2298599 was higher in the patients ( 18 % ) than in the controls ( 9 % ) ( x 2 = 15 . 5 , p = 0 . 000083 ) . Moreover , we found that subjects with the rs2298599 risk A / A genotype , compared with G allele carriers , had higher scores of schizotypal traits ( F 1 , 178 = 4 . 08 , p = 0 . 045 ) , particularly the interpersonal factor ( F 1 , 178 = 5 . 85 , p = 0 . 017 ) . Discussion : These results suggest that a genetic variation in the p250GAP gene might increase susceptibility not only for schizophrenia but also for schizotypal personality traits . We concluded that the p250GAP gene might be a new candidate gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia . Citation : Ohi K , Hashimoto R , Nakazawa T , Okada T , Yasuda Y , et al .

The lifetime morbidity rate is 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 % across distinct popula - tions . Family , twin and adoption studies of schizophrenia have indicated that there are strong genetic factors and have estimated the rate of schizophrenia heritability at 80 % [ 1 , 2 ] . Although genes implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia have been found using several approaches , such as through association studies of candidate genes , genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) , copy number variation ( CNV ) studies and pedigree studies [ 3 , 4 ] , the exact genetic factors of this complex disease remain to be explained . Hypofunction of the glutamate N - Methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . NMDA receptor antagonists , such as phencyclidine ( PCP ) and ketamine , mimic symptoms of the disorder in humans and exacerbate symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [ 5 ] . These NMDA receptor antagonists induce schizophrenia - like symptoms in humans . Preclinically , they have been shown to PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35696 induce similar symptoms and to induce neural circuitry changes reminiscent of schizophrenia [ 6 ] . The ability of these NMDA receptor antagonists to induce a schizophrenia - like phenotype supports the concept that schizophrenia may be the result of reduced or abnormal functioning of NMDA receptors . Altered NMDA receptor binding density in several brain regions , such as in the anterior cingulate cortex , has been reported in schizophre - nia [ 7 , 8 ] . The NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor are spatially and developmentally regulated , and they provide an important level of receptor regulation [ 9 , 10 ] . NR2A and NR2B are the predominant subunits in the cortex , striatum and hippocampus [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] . In particular , these three areas are closely associated with the pathology of schizophrenia and with the neural circuits within and between these regions [ 14 ] . In patients with schizophrenia , alterations have been observed in the NR2 subunit mRNA and protein in the prefrontal cortex , including a reduction in NR2A mRNA and NR2B protein levels [ 15 , 16 ] . Additionally , the NR2B subunit mRNA levels were increased in the hippocam - pus [ 17 ] . Therefore , different expression of NR2 subunits could play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . The NMDA receptor regulates activity - dependent spine mor - phological plasticity by modulating the actin cytoskeleton [ 18 ] . As the key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics , the Rho family of GTPases , including RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 and their regulators , play an important role in NMDA receptor - mediated spine morphogenesis [ 18 , 19 ] . In our previous study , we identified the p250GAP gene ( also known as p200RHOGAP , GRIT , KIAA0712 , RICS , or ARHGAP32 : OMIM 608541 ) as a novel NMDA receptor - interacting RhoGAP [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] . This gene spans approximately 56 . 17 kb of the genomic DNA and is located on chromosome 11q24 . 3 . p250GAP is highly enriched in the central nervous system , is concentrated in the post - synaptic densities in neurons and is co - localized with the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor [ 20 ] . Knockdown of p250GAP increased spine width and elevated the endogenous RhoA activity in primary hippocampal neurons , suggesting that p250GAP regulates spine morphogenesis through its RhoGAP activity for RhoA [ 24 ] . Importantly , p250GAP activity and localization within neurons are regulated by NMDA receptor activity [ 20 , 24 ] , suggesting that p250GAP , together with the NMDA receptor , regulates NMDA receptor - mediated spine morphogenesis . Given that neuropathological studies of schizo - phrenia have shown alterations in spine morphology [ 25 , 26 ] , we hypothesized that the p250GAP gene may be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . In this study , we investigated the association between the p250GAP gene and schizophrenia in a Japanese population using a gene - based approach . Schizotypal personality disorder ( SPD ) is one of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders and is characterized by social avoidance , ideas of reference , vagueness , magical thinking , odd speech , illusions and paranoid ideation . The lifetime prevalence of SPD has been estimated at 3 . 9 % [ 27 ] , making it one of the more common psychiatric disorders . The prevalence rate of SPD in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia ( 6 . 9 % ) was higher than the prevalence rates found either in relatives of individuals with other psychiatric disorders or in mentally healthy subjects [ 28 ] . Twin studies have estimated that the heritability of the latent liability to SPD is 61 – 72 % [ 29 , 30 ] . Premorbid SPD is related to the development of schizophrenia [ 31 ] . These findings suggest that SPD shares common genetic influences with schizophrenia . The traits of SPD were incorporated in the SPD criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , third edition ( DSM - III ) , and the traits are listed in the DSM - IV - TR on Axis II . These traits can be identified using a well - validated questionnaire , such as the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire ( SPQ ) [ 32 ] . The heritability rates of three schizotypal trait factors , cognitive / perceptual , interpersonal and disorganization , have been estimated at 40 to 60 % [ 33 , 34 ] . We recently demonstrated that a genome - wide genetic variant for schizophrenia in the ZNF804A gene was associated with schizotypal personality traits [ 35 ] . Additionally , we investigated whether a genetic variant in the p250GAP gene was associated with schizotypal personality traits in healthy subjects . Materials and Methods Ethics statement Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after the procedures had been fully explained . This study was performed in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Osaka University Research Ethics Committee . Subjects The subjects of our genetic association study were 431 patients with schizophrenia ( 48 . 7 % male ( 210 males , 221 females ) , mean age 6 SD was 49 . 7 6 15 . 4 years ) and 572 healthy controls ( 46 . 7 % male ( 267 males , 305 females ) , mean age 6 SD was 61 . 9 6 20 . 4 years ) . The sex ratio did not differ significantly between the groups ( x 2 = 0 . 41 , p = 0 . 52 ) , but the mean age was significantly different ( z = 2 11 . 49 , p , 0 . 001 ) . The subjects were all biologically unrelated and were Japanese . The subjects were recruited from both outpatient and inpatient units at Osaka University Hospital and other psychiatric hospitals . Each patient with schizophrenia had been diagnosed by at least two trained psychiatrists by unstruc - tured clinical interviews , according to the criteria of the DSM - IV . When the diagnosis of the two trained psychiatrists was discordant , they discussed the diagnosis . When the diagnostic disputes were resolved and the patient was diagnosed as schizophrenic , we included the patient . When the diagnostic disputes were not resolved by discussion or the patient was not diagnosed as schizophrenia , we excluded the patient . Controls were recruited through local advertisements . Psychiatrically healthy controls were evaluated using unstructured interviews to exclude individuals with current or past contact with psychiatric services , with experience with psychiatric medications or who were not Japanese . We did not assess the controls for their family history of mental disorders , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , or major depressive disorder . The ethnicity was determined by self - report and was not confirmed by genetic analyses . Data for the schizotypal personality trait analysis were available for 180 healthy subjects [ 48 . 3 % male ( 87 / 93 ) , mean age 6 SD : 36 . 5 6 11 . 5 years ] . The subjects were included in the genetic association analysis . The subjects included in the analysis met additional criteria . Psychiatrically , medically and neurologically healthy controls were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM - IV - Non - Patient Edition ( SCID - I / NP ) to exclude individuals who had received psychiatric medications or who had first - or second - degree relatives with psychiatric disorders . Additionally , subjects were excluded from this study if they had neurological or medical conditions that could have potentially affected their central nervous system , such as atypical headaches , head trauma with loss of consciousness , chronic lung disease , kidney disease , chronic hepatic disease , thyroid disease , active cancer , cerebrovascular disease , epilepsy , seizures , sub - stance - related disorders or mental retardation . SNP selection , genotyping and genomic sequencing This study was designed to examine the association between the p250GAP gene and schizophrenia by tagging single - nucleotide Association of p250GAP Gene with Schizophrenia PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35696 polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the p250GAP gene and its flanking regions ( 6 5 kb ) . Of the 31 SNPs in the p250GAP gene and flanking regions , we selected eight tagging SNPs using the TAGGER algorithm ( Paul de Bakker , http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / mpg / tagger ) with the criteria of r 2 greater than 0 . 5 in ‘pair - wise tagging only’ mode and a minor allele frequency ( MAF ) greater than 5 % . The selection was implemented in Haploview 4 . 2 using HapMap data release 24 / PhaseII Nov 08 , on NCBI B36 assembly , dbSNP b126 ( Japanese in Tokyo ( JPT ) , Chr 11 : 128 , 338 , 052 . . 128 , 404 , 222 ) ( Table S1 ) . The eight tagging SNPs were rs493172 , rs10893947 , rs2276027 , rs3796668 , rs581258 , rs3740829 , rs546239 and rs2298599 . The markers are shown in Table 1 ; the orientation and the alleles are reported on the genomic minus strand . The positions of the eight SNPs analyzed in the present study and the LD relationships between the SNPs in a HapMap JPT population are shown in Figure 1 . Venous blood was collected from the subjects . Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood using standard procedures . The SNPs were genotyped using the TaqMan 5 9 - exonuclease allelic discrimination assay ( Applied Biosystems ; Foster City , California , USA ) as previously described [ 36 , 37 ] . Detailed information on the PCR conditions is available upon request . Genotyping call rates were 99 . 3 % ( rs493172 ) , 98 . 9 % ( rs10893947 ) , 99 . 1 % ( rs2276027 ) , 99 . 7 % ( rs3796668 ) , 98 . 4 % ( rs581258 ) , 99 . 2 % ( rs3740829 ) , 98 . 5 % ( rs546239 ) and 99 . 3 % ( rs2298599 ) . No deviations from the Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) in the examined SNPs were detected ( p . 0 . 05 ) . Additionally , with 48 subjects with schizophrenia , we confirmed a SNP significantly associated with schizophrenia , genotyped by the TaqMan method , using direct DNA sequencing . These subjects were included in the genetic association analysis . The genomic regions were amplified by PCR using a pair of primers for rs2298599 , 5 9 - AAGTCAGCCCA - GACTCTCCA - 3 9 and 5 9 - GAGGGAGGAAGGGATTTTTG - 3 9 . PCR for each sample was carried out in a total volume of 40 m l using a Gene Amp H PCR System 9700 ( Applied Biosystems , CA , U . S . A ) . The PCR cycling conditions were 94 u C for 10 minutes , 30 cycles at 94 u C for 1 minute , 60 u C for one minute and 72 u C for 1 minute , followed by an incubation at 72 u C for 10 minutes . The PCR products were purified using a QIA quick H PCR Purification Kit ( QIAGEN , CA , USA ) , and the purification products were sequenced using a Big Dye H Terminator v1 . 1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems , CA , USA ) . Cycle sequencing conditions were 96 u C for 2 minutes , 25 cycles of 96 u C for 20 seconds , 50 u C for 30 seconds and 60 u C for 2 minutes , using a Gene Amp H PCR System 9700 . The PCR products from the cycle sequencing were purified using a Big Dye H XTerminator TM Purification Kit ( Applied Biosystems , CA , U . S . A . ) , and they were sequenced using an ABI PRISM H 3700 DNA Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , CA , U . S . A . ) . The sequencing was checked with SEQUENCHER ver . 4 . 7 ( Gene Codes , U . S . A . ) . Schizotypal personality trait analysis To assess schizotypal personality traits , a full Japanese version of the SPQ was administered to healthy subjects [ 38 , 39 ] . The SPQ is a 74 - item self - report questionnaire with a ‘‘yes / no’’ response format [ 40 ] . All items answered ‘‘yes’’ were scored 1 . The SPQ measures nine subscales of specific schizotypal features , which are ideas of reference , odd beliefs / magical thinking , unusual percep - tual experiences , suspiciousness / paranoid ideation , social anxiety , no close friends , constricted affect , eccentric / odd behavior and odd speech . The total SPQ score was obtained by summing the scores from all of the items . The three schizotypal trait factors , cognitive / perceptual , interpersonal and disorganization , were derived by summing the related subscale raw scores according to the three - factor model of Raine and colleagues [ 32 ] . Full - scale IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale , Revised or Third edition . Statistical analysis Differences in clinical characteristics between the patients and the controls or between the genotype groups were analyzed using the x 2 test for categorical variables and the Mann - Whitney U - test for continuous variables , using the PASW Statistics 18 . 0 software ( SPSS Japan Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) . We performed power calcula - tions using the Power Calculator for Two Stage Association Studies ( http : / / www . sph . umich . edu / csg / abecasis / CaTS [ 41 ] ) . The power estimates were based on the allele frequency of 0 . 35 ( rs2298599 ) in the controls and an alpha level of 0 . 05 . Power was calculated under a prevalence of 0 . 01 using a multiplicative model that assumed varying degrees of the odds ratio ( OR ) . Statistical analyses for the genetic associations were performed using the SNPAlyze V5 . 1 . 1 Pro software ( DYNACOM , Yokohama , Japan ) . Deviation from the HWE was tested using x 2 tests for goodness of Table 1 . Genotypic and allelic distributions for SNPs in the p250GAP between patients with schizophrenia and controls .

The allelic and genotypic distributions of p250GAP polymor - phisms between the patients and the controls were analyzed using x 2 tests . Pairwise linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) analyses , expressed by r 2 , were applied to detect the intermarker relationships in each group using the Haploview 4 . 2 software ( http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / mpg / haploview / contact . php ) . Haplotype frequencies were estimat - ed using the maximum likelihood method with the genotyping data . We used the expectation - maximization algorithm from the SNPA - lyze V5 . 1 . 1 Pro software . Rare haplotypes , detected in less than 3 % of the patients and the controls , were excluded from the haplotypic association analysis , as previously described [ 42 , 43 ] . Using a 2 6 2 contingency table approach , we performed 10 , 000 permutations of significance tests to determine empirical significance . We used a 2 - to 8 - window fashion analysis . We applied Bonferroni corrections in allelic and genotypic association analyses ( eight tests ) and in haplotypic association analyses ( 28 independent global tests ) . The effects of the p250GAP genotype on the total score and on the three factors of the SPQ were analyzed by a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . To control confounding factors , the effect of the p250GAP genotype on the significance factor of the SPQ was analyzed by a one - way analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) . Age , sex and education years were used as covariates because the SPQ total score and the three factors were correlated with these confounding factors in a previous study [ 44 ] . Standardized effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d method ( http : / / www . uccs . edu / faculty / lbecker ) . All p values are two tailed , and statistical significance was defined as p , 0 . 05 . Results Genetic association analysis Our study size of 431 patients with schizophrenia and 572 controls had sufficient power ( . 80 % ) to detect a genetic effect at ORs of 1 . 30 or larger when the allele frequency was 0 . 35 . The genotype and allele frequencies of the eight tagging SNPs located in the p250GAP gene and flanking regions are summarized in Table 1 . We found significant differences in genotype frequencies between the patients and the controls in rs3796668 ( x 2 = 7 . 8 , p = 0 . 020 ) and rs2298599 ( x 2 = 17 . 6 , p = 0 . 00015 ) . No allelic or genotypic associations were observed with schizophrenia for any other SNPs ( p . 0 . 05 ) . The major genotype frequency of rs3796668 was significantly higher in the patients with schizophrenia ( 43 % ) than in the controls ( 36 % ) ( x 2 = 5 . 2 , p = 0 . 023 ) , but no differences were observed in the frequencies of the minor or heterozygous genotypes of rs3796668 ( p . 0 . 05 ) . The minor genotype frequency of rs2298599 was higher in the patients with schizophrenia ( 18 % ) than in the controls ( 9 % ) ( x 2 = 15 . 5 , p = 0 . 000083 ) , but no differences were observed in the frequencies of the major or heterozygous genotypes of rs2298599 ( p . 0 . 05 ) . The evidence for genotypic association of rs2298599 remained significant after a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests ( corrected p = 0 . 0012 ) . Genomic sequencing data for rs2298599 for each individual were in agreement with genotyping data using the TaqMan methods . Haplotype analysis showed a marginally significant association with schizophrenia in the rs3740829 - rs546239 - rs2298599 haplotype ( x 2 = 7 . 9 , global p = 0 . 049 ) ( Table S2 ) . However , the Figure 1 . The genomic structure of p250GAP and linkage disequilibrium of the p250GAP in the HapMap JPT .

The LD relationships between the investigated markers are provided in Figure S1 . The LD pattern observed in our controls was similar to our patients and the JPT HapMap samples ; however , it was different from the LD pattern of the Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection ( CEU ) HapMap samples . In silico genotype - expression analysis We examined an association between the rs2298599 and the expression levels of the p250GAP gene in immortalized lymphoblasts derived from 45 HapMap JPT subjects using WGAViewer software ( http : / / compute1 . lsrc . duke . edu / softwares / WGAViewer ) . However , in silico analysis revealed that there was no significant association between the SNP and the p250GAP expression in the immortalized lymphoblasts ( p = 0 . 28 ) . Impact of p250GAP genotype on schizotypal personality traits We examined a possible association between the p250GAP genotype of rs2298599 and schizotypal personality traits in healthy subjects . Compared to controls , patients with schizophrenia were significantly more likely to carry the rs2298599 A / A genotype . Therefore , these analyses focused on a comparison of homozygous risk A / A genotype carriers versus homozygous carriers of one or two copies of the G allele ( a combined G / G and G / A genotype group ) , under a recessive inheritance model of the risk A / A genotype . Demographic variables , age , sex , and full - scale IQ were not significantly different between the genotype groups , except for years of education ( z = 2 2 . 05 , p = 0 . 041 ) ( Table 2 ) . We first examined the possible effect of p250GAP rs2298599 on the total SPQ score and found a significant effect of the genotype ( F 1 , 178 = 4 . 08 , p = 0 . 045 ) ( Table 3 ) . Then , we investigated the genotype effects on the three SPQ factors , cognitive / perceptual , interpersonal and disorganization . A significant genotype effect was observed on the interpersonal factor ( F 1 , 178 = 5 . 85 , p = 0 . 017 ) , but no significant genotype effects were observed on the cognitive / perceptual or disorganization factors ( p . 0 . 1 ) . The effect of genotype on the interpersonal factor remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors ( F 1 , 175 = 4 . 71 , p = 0 . 031 ) . Sub - jects with the risk A / A genotype of rs2298599 showed higher scores on schizotypal traits , particularly the interpersonal factor , compared with subjects with the G allele ( Figure 2 ) . The effect sizes of the total score and interpersonal factor were 0 . 41 and 0 . 47 , respectively . When the two genotypes were divided into opposite two genotype groups ( homozygous carriers of one or two copies of the A allele versus homozygous G / G genotype carriers ) under a dominant model of inheritance , there was no significant difference in scores between A carriers and individuals with G / G genotype ( p . 0 . 05 , Table S3 ) . Discussion This study is the first investigation of the association of the p250GAP gene with schizophrenia . In this study , we first provided evidence that a genetic variant of the p250GAP gene was associated with the risk for schizophrenia . The frequency of individuals with the rs2298599 risk A / A genotype was higher in patients with schizophrenia than in the controls . Second , we indicated that the risk genotype of the p250GAP gene was associated with high schizotypal personality traits , particularly the interpersonal factor , in healthy subjects . Individuals with the rs2298599 risk A / A genotype scored higher on schizotypal personality traits and the interpersonal factor than did individuals with non - risk genotypes . These findings suggest that the p250GAP gene may be related to the risk for schizophrenia and the schizotypal personality traits . Rs2298599 is situated within the relatively large LD block , which includes the p250GAP and the P53AIP1 ( OMIM 605426 ) genes ( Figure S2 ) . The SNP is located 2 . 9 kb downstream of the p250GAP gene and located 22 . 1 kb upstream of the P53AIP1 gene . To confirm whether a significant association signal of rs2298599 with schizophrenia is attributed to the p250GAP gene , we checked strength of LDs in the genomic region ( 6 50 kb ) around rs2298599 using HapMap data ( JPT , Chr 11 : 128 , 290 , 162 . . 128 , 390 , 161 ) . Seven SNPs was related to rs2298599 with the criteria of r 2 greater than 0 . 8 . Of the seven SNPs , five SNPs were located 5 9 upstream from rs2298599 and four SNPs were included in the p250GAP gene . Two SNPs were located 5 . 2 and 7 . 9 kb downstream from rs2298599 . These findings suggest that our association signal could be attributed to the p250GAP but not the P53AIP1 gene . However , the P53AIP1 may be a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia .

Although significant associations between the p250GAP gene and schizophrenia were observed in this study , no experimental evidence has indicated that the rs2298599 SNP of p250GAP is functional . To define a possibly functional SNP associated with the disease , followed by evaluation of altered function caused by the relevant SNP , may be able to narrow down the region of the association observed with the rs2298599 . For example , gene expression analyses at either mRNA or protein levels of the p250GAP gene using postmortem or lymphoblast samples may be an alternative approach . We examined an association between the rs2298599 and p250GAP expression in immortalized lymphoblasts . However , in silico analysis revealed that the SNP might not be related to p250GAP mRNA expression in a Japanese population . A future biological study of the function of rs2298599 or p250GAP gene is required to verify our results . MicroRNAs ( miRs ) regulate cellular fate by controlling the stability or translation of the mRNA transcripts . The miR132 , located on 17p12 . 3 , controls p250GAP protein levels and regulates neuronal morphogenesis by decreasing the levels of p250GAP [ 45 ] . The miR132 target sequence in the p250GAP 3 9 UTR , AACAGTCCACTGTCCAGCAGAGG , is conserved across ver - tebrate evolution . We performed a mutation search of the genomic region ( the target sequence of miR132 6 250 bp ) in the p250GAP gene using 48 patients with schizophrenia to evaluate the presence of a genetic variant in this region . However , we had no polymorphisms in our sequence data . This result suggests that the miR132 target sequence in the p250GAP might not play a major role in risk for schizophrenia . Several molecular genetic studies have investigated the influences of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia on schizotypal personality traits . These studies have reported associations between the COMT [ 46 , 47 , 48 ] , NRG1 [ 49 ] , DTNBP1 [ 50 , 51 ] , RGS4 [ 52 ] , DAAO [ 51 ] and ZNF804A [ 35 ] genes and schizotypal components . Risk alleles or haplotypes of schizophrenia were correlated with high scores on schizotypal personality traits . Of these genes , the COMT , NRG1 , DTNBP1 , DAAO and RGS4 genes , as well as the p250GAP gene , are directly or indirectly responsible for NMDA receptor - mediated glutamate transmission or signaling via glutamate receptors [ 53 ] . However , involvement of the glutamate NMDA receptors in SPD is still unknown . Further research will need to clarify the relationship between the glutamate NMDA receptors and SPD . The interpretation of our results has several limitations . We found a significant association of the p250GAP gene with schizophrenia using 431 patients with schizophrenia and 572 controls . Our sample sizes had sufficient power ( . 0 . 80 ) to detect the effects of ORs of 1 . 30 or larger . Because our results were based on a relatively small sample to detect the effects of ORs of 1 . 30 or fewer , a future replication study using larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our findings . Our positive results might have been derived from a sample bias due to population stratification and non - age - matched samples , although the Japanese are a relatively homogeneous population . We used schizotypal personality traits as a phenotype of interest . As the assessment of the personality traits was based on a self - reported questionnaire , it was not an objective measurement . Importantly , to be included in the SPQ analysis , subjects were not required to meet criteria for SPD . We had hypothesized that schizotypal personality trait is a continuous measure of the genetic liability to schizophrenia . G allele carriers had marginally higher years of education and lower scores on schizotypal traits than did subjects with the risk A / A genotype . In a previous study , years of education had significant inverse effects on the total SPQ score and the three factor scores , indicating that the SPQ scores decreased with increased years of education [ 44 ] . The educational level difference between the genotype groups may have affected the genotype effects on the schizotypal personality trait . However , our results remained significant after adjusting for years of education . In this study , we proposed p250GAP as a new candidate gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia . The association between the p250GAP gene and schizophrenia might partially explain the relationship between the hypofunction of the glutamate NMDA receptor and schizophrenia . Future studies are required to confirm the association between the p250GAP gene and schizophrenia in other populations .
