Previous work demonstrates that decisions by patients in this setting are made within a ‘trusting relationship’ with healthcare professionals . The current study aimed to further illuminate the nuances of this relationship from both the patients’ and healthcare professionals’ perspectives . Methods Face - to - face interviews using a grounded theory approach were conducted at a regional Cancer Centre in the United Kingdom . Interviews were performed with 34 participants ( patients with non - curative cancer , number ( n ) = 16 ; healthcare professionals involved in the consent process , n = 18 ) . Data analysis was performed after each interview using open , selective , and theoretical coding . Results The ‘Trusting relationship’ with healthcare professionals underpinned patient motivation to participate , with many patients ‘feeling lucky’ and articulating an unrealistic hope that a clinical trial could provide a cure . Patients adopted the attitude of ‘What the doctor thinks is best’ and placed significant trust in healthcare professionals , focusing on mainly positive aspects of the information provided . Healthcare professionals recognised that trial information was not received neutrally by patients , with some expressing concerns that patients would consent to ‘please’ them . This raises the question : Within the trusting relationship between patients and healthcare professionals , ‘Is it possible to provide balanced information ? ’ . The theoretical model identified in this study is central to understanding how the trusting professional - patient relationship influences the decision - making process . Conclusion The significant trust placed on healthcare professionals by patients presented an obstacle to delivering balanced trial information , with patients sometimes participating to please the ‘experts’ . In this high - stakes scenario , it may be pertinent to consider strategies , such as separation of the clinician - researcher roles and enabling patients Trusting relationships between patients with non - curative cancer and healthcare professionals create ethical obstacles for informed consent in clinical trials : a grounded theory study Mary Murphy 1 , Eilís McCaughan 2 , Gareth Thompson 3 , Matthew A Carson 3 , Jeffrey R Hanna 3 , Monica Donovan 3 , Richard H Wilson 4 and Donna Fitzsimons 3 * Page 2 of 8 Murphy et al . BMC Palliative Care ( 2023 ) 22 : 85 Background The advancement of cancer treatment is contingent on research that investigates novel drugs and treatment methods , with the primary phase of this process con - stituting a clinical trial [ 1 ] . Clinical research studies are governed by stringent scientific procedures and regula - tions to maximise patient protection and enhance the rigour of findings , with one of these principles being informed consent , which allows potential participants to make a voluntary , autonomous decision regarding trial enrolment , through the provision of comprehen - sible information surrounding the potential benefits and risks of involvement [ 2 ] . Additionally , patients should be informed of alternative opportunities to study par - ticipation , for instance , supportive care within a pal - liative setting [ 3 ] . However , the decision - making process for participation in an oncology clinical trial inevitably occurs when patients are vulnerably positioned , due to the life - threatening circumstances of a non - curative cancer diagnosis , raising concerns about the validity of informed consent provided [ 4 ] . Research regarding clinical trial decision - making and informed consent has been predominantly performed in curative settings , with a paucity of studies focusing on the palliative context in patients with non - curative cancer nearing the end of life [ 1 ] . In this patient popu - lation , early phase trials are unlikely to present clinical benefit [ 5 ] . Thus , the decision to participate represents an ethically challenging and clinically complex situation [ 4 ] . Research in this area asserts that a desire for curative treatment constitutes the principal reason for patients with non - curative cancer participating in clinical trials [ 6 ] , with many patients being willing to try anything to improve prognosis [ 7 ] . These findings are supported by a grounded theory study recently published by our group [ 8 ] , which identified ‘Nothing to lose’ as the core category that underpinned the decision by patients with non - cura - tive cancer to participate in clinical trials . Moreover , this participation was regarded by patients as the ‘only hope in the room’ , with the decision executed within a ‘trusting relationship’ with healthcare professionals . Ultimately , these findings suggest that patients with non - curative cancer frequently hold unrealistic hopes for personal benefit from clinical trials , which highlights a require - ment for research to develop a more robust and context appropriate consent process . Decisional aids have been developed to support patients with cancer in the consent process for clinical trial participation , such as : websites [ 9 ] , booklets [ 10 ] , and videos [ 11 ] . However , a recent systematic review reported limited evidence for the effectiveness of these decisional support resources , with insufficient research on interventions that account for the patients’ relation - ship with clinical staff [ 12 ] . A better understanding of the impact of this relationship on clinical trial participation would inform intervention development for supporting patients during the decision - making and informed con - sent process , thereby maximising patient protection and enhancing quality of care . Given the relevance of our recent qualitative findings [ 8 ] , this paper seeks to further explore the ‘trusting relationship’ between patients with non - curative cancer and clinical staff , to better under - stand how the nuances of this relationship may impact the decision - making and informed consent process from both perspectives . Methods Study aim To develop a greater understanding of how the healthcare professional - patient relationship impacts decision - mak - ing and informed consent for clinical trial participation in patients with non - curative cancer , from the perspec - tives of the patients and healthcare professionals involved in the consent process and recruitment procedures . Study design The study was performed at a regional Cancer Cen - tre ( Northern Ireland Cancer Centre , Belfast Health and Social Care Trust ) in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , which provides standard cancer treatment to patients from across Northern Ireland . Face - to - face interviews were conducted with participants . The overarching methodology was grounded theory , which is a suitable approach for generating theoretical explanations to elu - cidate understudied areas related to personal experience , behaviour , and concerns [ 13 ] . Participants Sixteen patients with non - curative cancer and eighteen healthcare professionals involved with the consent pro - cess and recruitment procedures were recruited from the collaborating regional Cancer Centre in the UK . Eligibil - ity criteria for participants are presented in Table 1 . to articulate their care priorities and preferences within the informed consent process . Further research is needed to expand on these ethical conundrums and ensure patient choice and autonomy in trial participation are prioritised , particularly when the patient’s life is limited . Keywords Clinical trial participation , Patients with non - curative cancer , Healthcare professionals , Decision - making , Consent process , Qualitative study , Grounded theory , Interviews Page 3 of 8 Murphy et al . BMC Palliative Care ( 2023 ) 22 : 85 Recruitment The recruitment strategy involved a convenience sam - pling approach for patients , whereby oncologists iden - tified eligible patients and outlined the study to them . If a patient expressed interest , the oncologist provided him / her with the participant information sheets and requested verbal agreement for the patient to be con - tacted by a researcher ( MM ) for questions to be answered and an interview arranged . Theoretical sampling was uti - lised for healthcare professionals following the analysis of patient data as patients frequently reported oncologists and nurses as being influential in their decision - making process for clinical trial participation , which enabled elucidation of emergent core categories . Healthcare pro - fessionals were invited to participate via an email from the researcher ( MM ) , which contained an overview of the study and participant information sheets . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to interviews by the researcher ( MM ) . Interviews Interviews were conducted by MM , a female healthcare professional and researcher with training in interviewing skills and grounded theory , who had no prior relationship with patient participants and a minimal relationship with healthcare professionals ( awareness of each other’s pro - fessional capacity ) . Consistent with the emergent nature of grounded theory , a formal interview guide was not used [ 13 ] . Rather , interviews were initiated with a general request , such as ‘Tell me about when you were first diag - nosed with cancer ? ’ . Follow - up questions were conceived during each interview and were determined by and rel - evant to the participants’ responses ( i . e . , ‘How did you feel when you received your diagnosis / prognosis ? ’ , ‘When was a clinical trial first mentioned ? ’ , and ‘Why did you make your decision about participation ? ’ ) . Patient inter - views were conducted at their preferred location , which included the patient’s own home ( n = 13 ) or a private room at a hospital ( n = 3 ) . Healthcare professional inter - views were facilitated in a quiet room on hospital prem - ises ( n = 18 ) . All interviews lasted between 40 and 80 min ( average : 60 min ) . Data analysis Interviews were audio - recorded and transcribed ver - batim . Data analysis was performed iteratively , which aligns with the constant comparative method [ 14 ] . As per grounded theory techniques [ 15 ] , the analysis comprised open coding , selective coding , and theoretical coding . Initial transcripts were coded by MM , DF , and EMcC before identified codes were compared . As the analy - sis progressed , the identified codes were reviewed and refined by the research team through critical dialogue until consensus agreement . Coding was completed by hand as the use of NVivo made the researchers feel ‘dis - tanced’ from the data . Pseudonyms replace any names in participant quotes to uphold anonymity . Results A total of 34 participants were involved ( patients , n = 16 ; healthcare professionals , n = 18 ) . The patient sample were predominantly male ( n = 11 ) , had an average age of 57 . 6 years , exhibited a range of cancer types ( i . e . , breast , oesophageal , pancreatic , or prostate ) , and data subse - quently obtained from medical records confirmed that patients were interviewed shortly before death ( range : 7 – 64 weeks ) . Three patients declined clinical trial partici - pation , with thirteen patients primarily participating in a Phase III Clinical Trial . Regarding the healthcare profes - sional sample , they were predominantly female ( n = 10 ) and comprised Oncologists ( n = 10 ) and Clinical Research Nurses ( n = 8 ) . Participant characteristics have been com - prehensively reported elsewhere [ 8 ] . Category 1 ( core category ) – trusting relationship > The ‘Trusting relationship’ was identified as a core cat - egory for both patients with non - curative cancer and healthcare professionals involved with the consent pro - cess and recruitment procedures ( see Fig . 1 ) . Many healthcare professionals reflected on their experience and mentioned the challenges of maintaining a neutral stance when discussing clinical trial participation due to this trusting relationship with patients : ‘So , in that situation where I know a patient well and I know that they’d jump off a cliff for me , that puts an extra responsibility on me to go through the same process I go through with every single patient when I’m approaching it . ’ ( HcP10 ) .

Page 4 of 8 Murphy et al . BMC Palliative Care ( 2023 ) 22 : 85 Most healthcare professionals believed they presented information in a balanced way to patients about inclusion in a clinical trial , with the aim of facilitating an informed decision regarding clinical trial participation : ‘If they ask me an honest question about what I think their personal chance of gain from this is – I’ll answer that honestly - if you are entering a Phase I clinical trial , you have a very small chance of clinical benefit and if I was in that situation and the patient asked , “What would you do doctor ? ” I would not do it , because I see a lot of down sides in it for them . This is somebody who is dying , who has got a limited life expectancy and who we are asking to spend a lot of their time , a significant amount of their limited time , having pharmacokinetic studies carried out on them . ’ ( HcP15 ) . However , the trial information was not always per - ceived in the same balanced way by patients : ‘But he did say great things on that day . He said that XX was a drug that cost £30k or £40k a course . It works well , but this other one , the trial drug is even better than XX he thinks , or they think it’s even better . ’ ( P14 ) . Within the trusting relationship , patients respected and valued the expertise of healthcare professionals . As a result , healthcare professionals believed that patients were determined to ‘please them’ by participating in a clinical trial : ‘I think that there is a risk that patients might feel , “Well I want to keep in with Dr Smith , he’s my oncologist and it’s very important for me . And how do I keep Dr Smith sweet ? Well then , I keep Dr Smith sweet by doing trials . ”’ ( HcP06 ) . It is evident that there are many challenges for health - care professionals when providing patients with balanced trial information because of their emotionally charged relationship . While healthcare professionals believed that they did their best to present impartial information , patients perceived that the doctor wanted them to join the clinical trial , which may have resulted in decisions to participate to please the healthcare professionals . The core category of ‘Trusting relationship’ overarched the data and was inextricably linked to the other categories , which are discussed below . Category 2 - expectation of personal benefit Most patients exhibited an ‘Expectation of personal ben - efit’ ( i . e . , extended life ) from trial participation : ‘I felt pleased . It’s very hard to define . I did feel pleased . I felt very positive about it . I was glad I managed to get the last place on it . I mean , I’ll go through hell and high water if I thought I could get rid of this . I’d like a few more years . ’ ( P02 ) . Fig . 1 Visual representation of identified categories Page 5 of 8 Murphy et al . BMC Palliative Care ( 2023 ) 22 : 85 Patients were sometimes aware of the expensive cost of trial drugs and thought this represented superior treat - ment in comparison to standard care : ‘It’s not available on the NHS [ National Health Service ] , you pay for it yourself and I think it’s £3 , 000 per treat - ment , so it works out at £30 , 000 a year if you wanted to pay for the treatment . So , I felt I was lucky enough getting this treatment without having to pay for it cos I couldn’t have afforded it naturally you know and so hopefully I will get a bit of benefit from it . ’ ( P09 ) . The offer of a clinical trial was clearly perceived as something beneficial by patients , despite the non - cura - tive intent . This demonstrates evidence of a strong , almost desperate desire to extend life , with some patients disclosing a hope that clinical trial participation would be a “magic bullet” , and against all odds , they would be cured . Category 3 - what the doctor thinks is best Secondary to the ‘Trusting relationship’ demonstrated in category 1 , patients displayed an attitude of ‘What the doctor thinks is best’ . It was evident from many patient accounts that they were keen to take the advice of their doctor in making the decision about trial participation : ‘I didn’t think to bother to question it because I just took the view that they’re not going to give me something that’s absolutely stupid . I trust them and I’m not going to ques - tion this . ’ ( P02 ) . Also , ‘Doing what the doctor thinks is best’ was thought by the healthcare professionals to have an influence on a patient’s decision - making : ‘I think that some patients consent to trials because they think that is what the doctor feels is the best thing to do . ’ ( HcP09 ) . This degree of trust placed the healthcare professionals in a difficult position when discussing clinical trial par - ticipation with patients , with many patients expecting healthcare professionals to make the decision on their behalf by virtue of their ‘expert status’ , which may have compromised the impartiality of information provided : “Any attempt to enter into a more equal conversation unsettles them and is unhelpful to the patient . Frequently you are asked “what would you do if it was you , Doctor ? ” or “Tell me what’s right , you are the expert . ” ( HcP10 ) . This analysis demonstrates that given the life - or - death situation , patients placed a lot of trust in their doctor and his / her expertise and judgement , and as a result , many patients were keen to take up the trial offer . Category 4 - positive language During interactions between patients and healthcare professionals , there was evidence that the language and demeanour used to describe the trial had a powerful impact . This patient is recalling the conversation with his Oncologist , when he agreed to be a trial participant : ‘He [ oncologist ] said , “Good , good , good , great , that’s all I want to hear . ” So , you know , he didn’t want to promote it , but when we said , “Yes , ” it was absolutely clear , he did want us to do it . And Dr Black was very positive about it . I didn’t feel pressure… No pressure , but em , they were good PR for the trial . Just very positive about the trial . ’ ( P14 ) . The healthcare professionals shared this perception and believed the environment had a positive impact on patients’ decision - making : ‘And attending a clinic where research is going on , a research active clinic , I would think patients get confident like , “Well these boys know what they are doing . If these doctors and nurses are promoting this type of research , they probably know what they are doing . ” And they’re right . ’ ( HcP10 ) . Ultimately , patients were keen to enroll if healthcare professionals exhibited positive views on clinical trial participation , which reflects the degree of influence con - ferred by their trusting relationship with patients . Category 5 - lack of understanding of randomisation and risk Data from both patients and healthcare profession - als strongly suggested that patients found it difficult to understand some important elements of the consent pro - cess ( i . e . , randomisation ) and believed the healthcare pro - fessionals would choose the drug regime to which they would be allocated . This misunderstanding undermined informed consent , with many patients being ‘naïve’ to the limitations of allocation to a control group ( i . e . , loosing time with loved ones ) : ‘I was also told that the selection for whichever arm is being done by computer random selection . But having said that , the selection process is a matter of putting informa - tion into a computer of a patient’s condition and then the computer will say this will be more appropriate . At the end of the day , and taking into account the high symptom score that I got , would tend to influence a decision for an arm of the research that would be at the more severe end of the scale . ’ ( P04 ) . Healthcare professionals understood this difficulty : ‘On more than one occasion a patient has come back and said , “I am happy to participate in a trial . Which treatment are you going to pick for me ? ” . ’ ( HcP11 ) . Despite having been given information that clearly pre - sented the possibility of potentially fatal consequences , the view of most patients was : ‘What’s an adverse reaction to getting rid of this ? ’ ( P02 ) . In all accounts , the high - risk environment of an incur - able disease exerted a powerful influence on decision - making , with the enormity of the diagnosis eliciting a naïve belief for patients that their relationship with Page 6 of 8 Murphy et al . BMC Palliative Care ( 2023 ) 22 : 85 healthcare professionals would favourably influence study treatment ( i . e . , ensuring allocation to the treatment group ) . Ultimately , this resulted in under appreciation of the risks involved with clinical trial participation , which compromised the integrity of informed consent . Discussion This study is one of the first to explore how the trust - ing healthcare professional - patient relationship impacts decision - making and informed consent for clinical trial participation in patients with non - curative cancer . The theoretical model generated by the grounded theory analysis is presented in Fig . 1 . The core of this model is ‘Trusting relationship’ , which encapsulates and influences the other identified categories . This model builds on pre - vious data [ 8 ] by elucidating the impact of the trusting healthcare professional - patient relationship on the deci - sion - making process for clinical trial participation . From the data , it is apparent that the ‘Trusting relationship’ between patients and healthcare professionals resulted in patients doing ‘What the Doctor thinks is best’ and placing a huge amount of trust in the healthcare team by virtue of their expertise . In turn , this made it difficult for healthcare professionals to deliver balanced information , with patients deciding to participate to please the ‘expert’ healthcare professionals , along with naïvely believing the healthcare professionals would favourably influence their clinical trial treatment . Ultimately , the emotive health - care professional - patient relationship resulted in patients under appreciating the risks involved with clinical trial participation , which may compromise the integrity of informed consent . To uphold autonomy , patients with non - curative can - cer should not be excluded from clinical trials based on vulnerability [ 16 ] . However , the categories identified in this study outline ethical complications in the decision - making and informed consent processes for clinical trial participation in this patient population . Firstly , patients with non - curative cancer exhibited unrealistic expecta - tions of personal benefit , which raises concerns about the validity of informed consent provided . Consistent with the principles of ‘therapeutic misconception’ [ 17 ] , a potential explanation for this patient behaviour is an inability to differentiate between research follow - up and standard care , with a misunderstanding that the primary aim of research is to care for them [ 18 ] . Given the high stakes involved and the role overlap between clinician and researcher , the question pre - sented by the findings of this study is : ‘Is consent truly informed in this situation ? ’ . To avoid this ‘ethical fading’ , a psychological process involving ethical aspects of a decision disappearing from view when focusing on other aspects ( i . e . , perceived benefits ) [ 19 ] , healthcare profes - sionals and researchers should consciously acknowledge the vulnerability and desperation for ‘a cure’ of patients with non - curative cancer when discussing clinical trial participation [ 8 ] . To maximise patient autonomy and the integrity of informed consent , healthcare professionals must employ an effort to ensure patients are impartially informed , both in writing and verbally , of the scope and aims of clinical trials prior to invitation , whilst avoiding any preformed decisions that exclude patient involve - ment [ 20 ] . Future research should explore these issues from the perspectives of healthcare professionals , for instance , opinions on fulling a ‘supportive’ rather than ‘curative’ role [ 21 ] . Shared decision - making is a core value of cancer care [ 22 ] , yet the findings of this study question the degree to which patients are serving as active partners in the decision - making process . Informed consent discussions for participation in Phase - I clinical trials mostly occur in hospital - based clinics involving members of the clini - cal research team . As demonstrated by the results of this study , the emotive relationship between patients and the clinical research team resulted in patients deciding to participate to please the ‘experts’ . To maximise patient autonomy and integrity of informed consent , a multi - disciplinary approach with distributed deliberation is required , whereby patients discuss options with those independent of the clinical research team at different times and places [ 23 ] . Importantly , the recognition of this patient requirement and allowing time for it , are essen - tial for effective shared decision - making [ 24 ] . Greater collaboration with and inclusion of palliative care clini - cians would optimise the level of information provided to patients in this setting , such as : expert discussion of prognosis and options for supportive care [ 25 ] . To facili - tate this , effective communication between the oncolo - gists and palliative care specialists is required , with the wishes of patients and families systematically assessed and integrated into the decision - making processes [ 26 ] . In addition to palliative care clinicians , there is a need for greater involvement of primary care providers in the decision - making process for clinical trial participa - tion , with General Practitioners ( GPs ) being well placed to support patients during their cancer care pathway by virtue of established therapeutic relationships [ 27 ] . Of all caregivers involved , GPs are best positioned to balance treatment options according to a patient’s medical his - tory and personal preferences [ 28 ] . Indeed , recent stud - ies have shown that patients are motivated to consult their GP in preparation for final treatment decisions with their oncologist [ 29 , 30 ] . Whilst there are logistical chal - lenges to this , adequate planning is required to include such consultations in the decision - making process . Ulti - mately , there is a need to rethink the cancer pathway for patients with non - curative disease to promote better col - laboration with other healthcare professionals within and Page 7 of 8 Murphy et al . BMC Palliative Care ( 2023 ) 22 : 85 across all levels of care , which in the context of clinical trial participation , may improve the integrity of informed consent and alleviate the difficulty of delivering ‘balanced information’ perceived by the clinical research team . In terms of strengths and limitations , the current study adds depth to previous work by illuminating how the healthcare professional - patient relationship impacts decision - making and informed consent , with the holis - tic inclusion of patients and healthcare professionals involved in these processes . By implementing a grounded theory approach , the study provides an important con - tribution to the literature by appropriately elucidating an understudied area . However , despite these strengths , the research was conducted in a small sample who were pre - dominantly male ( n = 11 ) from one cancer centre in the UK , therefore , the transferability of the findings to other settings is not assured . There is a need for wider explo - ration of these issues in a larger multi - centre study with a more diverse gender population , which would inform applicability of the theoretical model to cancer patients and relevance to other diseases ( i . e . , end - stage renal dis - ease and heart failure ) . Moreover , the literature would benefit from a better understanding of the perspectives of trial decliners and caregivers , which would provide alternative perspectives and insights into involvement in the decision - making process . Conclusion This study has expanded understanding of how the trust - ing healthcare professional - patient relationship can influ - ence decision - making and informed consent in patients with non - curative cancer . The categories identified in this study convey serious ethical complications , with patients placing a degree of trust on healthcare professionals that rendered the delivery of balanced trial information diffi - cult . As a result , patients often believed that deciding to participate would please the ‘experts’ . Healthcare profes - sionals must acknowledge the vulnerability of patients in this setting , whilst avoiding preformed decisions and delivering unbiased study information . To assist with this , a multidisciplinary approach with distributed delib - eration would enable other professionals , without direct care responsibility , to lead informed consent discussions , which may facilitate effective shared decision - making with patients . Given that standard care and research are becoming increasingly interwoven , future research should further explore the ethical conundrums identified by this study . The imperative is to promote a clinical envi - ronment that upholds ethical research , thereby maximis - ing patient autonomy and enhancing quality of care .
