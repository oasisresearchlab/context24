However , considerably less attention has been paid to learned char - acteristics of relationships that affect the decision to seek information from other people . Based on a review of the social network , information processing , and organizational learn - ing literatures , along with the results of a previous qualitative study , we propose a formal model of information seeking in which the probability of seeking information from another person is a function of ( 1 ) knowing what that person knows ; ( 2 ) valuing what that person knows ; ( 3 ) being able to gain timely access to that person’s thinking ; and ( 4 ) perceiving that seeking information from that person would not be too costly . We also hypothesize that the knowing , access , and cost variables mediate the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking . The model is tested using two separate research sites to provide repli - cation . The results indicate strong support for the model and the mediation hypothesis ( with the exception of the cost variable ) . Implications are drawn for the study of both transactive memory and organizational learning , as well as for management practice .

We had received a last - second opportunity to bid on a sizable piece of work that the partner on the other end of the line really wanted to pursue .

Foundational work focused on learning as either a cognitive process ( e . g . , Argyris and Schon 1978 , Daft and Weick 1984 ) or a func - tion of behavioral change occurring through modi - ﬁcation of an organization’s programs , goals , deci - 1 Vignette from Cross et al .

More recently , scholars have developed midrange theories of how organizational learning occurs and / or impacts organizational perfor - mance . 2 However , to date the bulk of this research has focused on declarative ( know - what ) or procedu - ral ( know - how ) knowledge with little inquiry into organizational learning as a function of relationships ( know - who ) . This is surprising given the importance of social relationships for acquiring information ( e . g . , Granovetter 1973 , Allen 1977 , Burt 1992 ) , learning how to do one’s work ( e . g . , Lave and Wenger 1991 , Brown and Duguid 1991 , Orr 1996 ) and collectively solving cognitively complex tasks ( e . g . , Weick and Roberts 1993 , Hutchins 1991 , Moreland et al . 1996 , Hollingshead 1998 ) . Answering Miner and Mezias’ ( 1996 ) call for new approaches to the study of organizational learning , we suggest that a social network perspective can enrich our understanding of both dyadic and collec - tive learning in organizations . However , rather than simply measuring communication ﬂows among net - work nodes , we seek to model learned characteris - tics of relationships that underlie information seeking and sharing . In doing so , we break somewhat with mainstream social network research that has heav - ily focused on structural properties of networks ( e . g . , identifying cliques or measuring centrality ) , and paid less attention to relational characteristics ( e . g . , how different aspects of relationships affect the individuals involved ) ( Monge and Contractor 2000 ) . While impor - tant , the structural tradition provides no explanatory mechanism relating what people learn about each other to information - seeking behavior . The opening vignette , drawn from preliminary interviews leading to the present study , provides a real - world illustra - tion of the importance of this distinction for network actors . This manager , and by extension his organiza - tion , was successful because he was able to leverage 2 For example , we have evidence of learning from operating expe - rience ( e . g . , Argote et al . 1990 , Epple et al . 1996 ) , innovation efforts ( e . g . , Van de Ven and Polley 1990 , Pisano 1994 ) ; unique events ( March et al . 1991 ) , teams ( Edmondson 1999 ) , improvement ini - tiatives ( e . g . , Leonard - Barton 1992 , Winter 1996 ) , and individuals ( Cohen and Bacdayan 1994 ) . the expertise of others in an accurate and timely fash - ion . This was not so much the result of the struc - ture of current information ﬂows , but of properties of the relationships he had with others that allowed him to rapidly leverage their expertise to respond to this opportunity . Huber ( 1991 , p . 89 ) claimed that an organization learns when “through its processing of information its range of potential behaviors has changed . ” At a dyadic level , qualitative research suggests that per - ceptions of another person are formed through direct interaction , observation , and / or third - party commen - tary ( Cross and Borgatti 2000 ) . We believe that these perceptions affect the likelihood of seeking informa - tion from them in the future . For example , learn - ing someone’s level of expertise or determining how to gain timely access to them affects the probabil - ity of seeking that person out for information in the future . At a collective level , the structure of these perceptual relations reﬂects learning and the poten - tial of a network to identify and react to new issues or opportunities requiring coordinated effort or inte - gration of disparate expertise . As members of one region of a network become aware of and able to leverage the expertise of those in other regions , they become individually capable of doing more while the entire network’s potential to sense and respond to new opportunities is also enhanced . To date , aside from ﬁndings relating information seeking to the closeness or strength of a relation - ship ( Granovetter 1973 ) , we know little about the ways in which kinds of relationships ( in contrast to structural properties ) condition information ﬂow and learning in networks . This paper seeks to contribute to the organizational learning literature by proposing a model of cognitive and effective aspects of relation - ships that are learned and affect information seeking . We will present results from testing this model in two different organizations and conclude with a discus - sion of ﬁndings and implications for future research . Relational Characteristics Inﬂuencing Information Seeking What characteristics of a relationship are learned and affect future information seeking ? Few studies have Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 433 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks speciﬁcally addressed this though there are more gen - eral results that have bearing on the question . For example , research on homophily indicates that people are more likely to have social ties ( especially strong ones ) with those similar to themselves on socially important attributes such as race , sex , education , and age ( e . g . , Marsden 1990 ; Zenger and Lawrence 1989 ; Ibarra 1992 , 1995 ; Brass 1995 ) . We also have consis - tent evidence that physical proximity affects the like - lihood of communication between a pair of actors ( Allen 1977 , Zahn 1991 , Krackhardt 1994 ) , presumably by increasing the probability of serendipitous interac - tions ( Monge et al . 1985 ) . Social network researchers have examined the role of weak versus strong ties in the acquisition of novel information . Granovetter ( 1973 ) theorized that weak ties are more likely than strong ties to be bridges to socially distant regions of a network and , therefore , new information . Subsequent research on the impor - tance of weak ties has demonstrated that they can be instrumental to ﬁnding a job ( Granovetter 1973 ; Lin 1982 , 1988 ) , individual advancement ( Burt 1992 , 1997 , 2000 ) , and diffusion of ideas ( Granovetter 1982 , Rogers 1995 ) . More recently , however , attention has shifted to the role of strong ties ( Krackhardt 1992 ) . Hansen ( 1999 ) , for example , has demonstrated the importance of strong ties in transferring tacit , com - plex knowledge across departmental boundaries in an organization . While providing insight into the way in which communication networks might emerge or how infor - mation might move between people , the above liter - atures have not addressed directly learned relational characteristics that affect who seeks whom for infor - mation . Based in part on the results of qualitative work by Cross and Borgatti ( 2000 ) , we propose that the intentional search for information in an organiza - tional setting can be seen as a dynamic choice pro - cess . The decision to seek information from a speciﬁc other is informed by characteristics of the relation - ship between the seeker and a set of other people he or she might turn to . In turn , actual information - seeking episodes ( as well as third - party interaction ) update the seeker’s perception of another person with respect to these characteristics . Speciﬁcally , we pro - pose that information seeking is a function of ( 1 ) the extent to which a person knows and values the exper - tise of another , ( 2 ) the accessibility of this person , and ( 3 ) the potential costs incurred in seeking information from this person . Each of these variables is discussed below . Knowing . The decision to seek information from someone in the face of a new problem or opportunity is likely affected by one’s perception of another per - son’s expertise . 3 A baseline condition for turning to a given individual for information is awareness of that individual as a possible source in light of a current problem or opportunity . That is , actor i must have some understanding of actor j ’s knowledge and skills . Recent work in transactive memory and distributed cognition has begun to shed light on this issue by exploring the existence and performance implications of distributed knowledge systems ( Weick and Roberts 1993 , Moreland et al . 1996 , Hollingshead 1998 , Rulke and Galaskiewicz 2000 ) . Knowledge of another per - son’s expertise is a standard variable in the transactive memory literature , which identiﬁes knowing where information is stored as a basic requirement of perfor - mance in distributed knowledge systems . We simply propose here that individuals are more likely to seek information from those whose areas of expertise are known to them . Hypothesis 1 . The extent to which actor i seeks infor - mation from actor j is a positive function of the extent to which actor i knows what actor j ’s areas of expertise are . Value . It is also important that a knowledge seeker positively evaluate the knowledge and skills of the person sought out in relation to the problem the seeker is attempting to solve . That is , if actor i knows with a great deal of certainty that actor j is a poor source of information regarding a certain topic , then the probability that i will go to j for information on that topic is lowered . While obvious , this variable has not been previously identiﬁed in the transactive memory literature , perhaps because empirical study of this phenomenon has largely been conducted in laboratory settings where the quality of knowledge is 3 This , of course , is subject to bias ( Fiske and Taylor 1984 ) . How - ever , a person’s perception of others’ knowledge and skills , even if inaccurate , informs who they turn to for what . 434 Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks held constant and only the location is experimentally manipulated . The variable has surfaced in other con - texts , however . For example , in his study of how indi - viduals employ various forms of information in their work , O’Reilly ( 1982 ) found that in choosing among impersonal sources ( e . g . , ﬁles or procedure manuals ) , people largely made their decisions based on accessi - bility , but when tapping coworkers , people took into account source quality . Hypothesis 2 . The extent to which actor i seeks infor - mation from actor j is a positive function of the extent to which actor i positively evaluates actor j ’s knowledge and skills in domains relevant to his or her work . Access . Knowing that someone else has valuable expertise is important , but their knowledge is really helpful only if they are accessible . 4 Accessibility is , in part , a question of timeliness : actor i must be able to bring actor j ’s expertise to bear on his or her problem in a timely fashion to be of any real beneﬁt . Particu - larly , in today’s time - constrained world , access alone may dictate whether and how knowledgeable others are tapped . We rarely , if ever , make fully informed decisions but rather satisﬁce ( March and Simon 1958 ) . Further , the extent to which we satisﬁce is a func - tion of the ease with which solutions are located . As solutions are harder to ﬁnd , standards of search fall ( Cohen et al . 1972 , Perrow 1986 ) . Accessibility is also an issue of engagement : when actor i does not know the exact question he or she needs to ask , access means getting actor j to mindfully focus on the total - ity of i ’s problem to give i the information he or she really needs . With the widespread diffusion of advanced com - munications technology , we can expect technical bar - riers to access to become less important . Rather , access barriers are increasingly likely to be a product of the relational energy one has to expend . As outlined by Krackhardt ( 1994 , p . 212 ) “the constraint (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) is that the recipients of these requests will not have the personal 4 At ﬁrst glance , accessibility of a contact may seem like a personal attribute of the contact rather than a relation between the seeker and the contact . However , a given contact can vary in their acces - sibility to others depending on who the seeker is to others . The classic example is the person who has time for high - status people , but not for others . resources to handle all the trafﬁc . ” Further , cultural issues might also play a role if access is a product of status or inﬂuenced by power inhering in positions of formal authority ( Astley and Sachdeva 1984 ) or infor - mal structure ( Brass 1984 , Burkhardt and Brass 1990 ) . As a result , we can expect that a person’s perception of another person’s accessibility will affect the deci - sion to seek information from that person . Hypothesis 3 . The extent to which actor i seeks infor - mation from actor j is a positive function of the extent to which actor i perceives he or she has access to actor j ’s thinking . Cost . Finally , we suggest there are costs involved in asking others for assistance . That is , actor i must believe that seeking information from actor j is not too costly in terms of either interpersonal risks or obligations incurred . A potentially signiﬁcant cost of seeking information from others in organizational set - tings lies with the interpersonal risks an individual takes by admitting ignorance on a given topic . Esteem and reputation issues come into play in seeking help from others as we are motivated to maintain posi - tive self - images and so often seek out information that conﬁrms a positive sense of self ( Lee 1997 , Kelley and Thibaut 1979 , Janis 1972 ) . One’s trust in another is likely to shape the extent to which people will be forthcoming about their lack of knowledge . 5 Obligations resulting from an exchange can also be considered a form of cost . Due to norms of reci - procity , asking contacts for signiﬁcant amounts of help may place a person in their debt ( Blau 1986 ; Coleman 1988 , 1990 ; Fiske 1991 ) . How much debt is incurred will vary from contact to contact depend - ing on such factors as relative status ( how valuable is the contact’s time ? ) and attitude ( some contacts will begrudge the imposition and demand “payment , ” while others might enjoy the interaction ) . However , we can expect that one’s perception of the extent of 5 Trust writ large is a multifaceted construct in organization stud - ies that in its entirety goes beyond the scope of this effort ( see Gambetta 1988 , Mayer et al . 1995 , Kramer and Tyler 1996 for reviews ) . While trust can refer to the ability to accurately predict another’s behavior , we use trust to mean the belief that one will not be taken advantage of ( Porter et al . 1975 ) . Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 435 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks such future demands will negatively affect informa - tion seeking from that contact . Hypothesis 4 . The extent to which actor i seeks infor - mation from actor j is a negative function of the costs that actor i believes he or she will incur as a result of asking j for help . A well - known ﬁnding in communication research is the importance of physical proximity ( e . g . , Allen 1977 , Monge et al . 1985 ) . Studies suggest that prox - imity promotes the likelihood of communication by increasing the probability of serendipitous interaction . However , we suggest that for purposeful information seeking the effect of proximity is indirect . Proximity leads to chance meetings in which people gradually come to learn about each other , become comfortable with each other , and develop bonds that enable future access . Thus , we suggest that knowing , access , and cost relations mediate the relationship between phys - ical proximity and information seeking . Hypothesis 5 . Knowing , access , and cost relations mediate the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking . Methods To test the hypotheses , we collected social net - work data on groups in two different organizations . The ﬁrst was a group of 37 information scientists ( 16 men and 21 women ) in a global pharmaceu - tical organization whose primary function was to conduct secondary research to support drug devel - opment . Preliminary interviews indicated that this group relied on each other for informational purposes in solving various problems and ﬁnding information for research scientists . Furthermore , this group was distributed approximately equally across four differ - ent geographic locations , thus providing an opportu - nity to test the extent to which relational variables mediated the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking . The second group comprised a genomic research function in a different global pharmaceutical organi - zation . This was a group of 35 researchers ( 16 men and 19 women ) whose primary function was to develop new pharmaceutical applications . Again , pre - liminary interviews indicated that this group relied on each other for informational purposes in solv - ing various problems . This group was also dis - tributed approximately equally across four different geographic locations , thus providing a similar oppor - tunity to test the extent to which relational variables mediated the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking . Surveys were conducted via electronic mail and were initially sent out along with a cover letter from the sponsor of our study . Surveys were returned directly to the researchers who also sent two follow - up e - mails to increase response rate . In aggregate , all of the information scientists completed the survey , but one of the genomic researchers declined due to maternity leave . Each group was asked the same set of network questions , corresponding to the relational variables in our model . The exact item wording and scales are given in Table 1 . As is typical in network research , each independent variable was measured by using a single network question ( e . g . , Ibarra 1992 , 1995 ) . While some have faulted the practice of asking a single sociometric question to measure each theoret - ical variable ( Rogers and Kincaid 1981 ) , a review by Marsden ( 1990 ) suggests that these indices are largely reliable when appropriate procedures are followed to help individuals accurately report their network links . Measures taken in this instance included pretesting and constructing question items that were highly spe - ciﬁc , and which elicited typical or long - term patterns of interaction rather than one - time events ( Rogers and Kincaid 1981 , Freeman et al . 1987 ) . It is important to note that the unit of analysis in this study is the relationship between pairs of per - sons so all of the variables are dyadic . For each pair , we have measured the extent to which person i seeks information from person j ( “information seeking , ” regarded as a dependent variable ) , as well as the extent to which i believes they know what j ’s exper - tise is ( “knowing” ) , how much i values j ’s expertise ( “value” ) , how accessible j is to i ( “access” ) , and the extent to which i feels it is costly to seek information from j ( “cost” ) . The cost variable was reverse coded to facilitate interpretation of the regression results . The data are cross sectional , meaning that all of the 436 Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks Table 1 Questionnaire Items for Relational Variables Variable name Question Knowing ( K ) I understand this person’s knowledge and skills . This does not necessarily mean that I have these skills or am knowledgeable in these domains , but that I understand what skills this person has and domains they are knowledgeable in . 1 = Strongly disagree , 5 = Strongly agree , 0 = I do not know this person . Value ( V ) This person has expertise in areas that are important in the kind of work I do . 1 = Strongly disagree , 5 = Strongly agree , 0 = I do not know this person . Access ( A ) One issue in getting information or advice from others is your ability to gain access to their thinking . The extent to which you can access another person’s thinking and knowledge is a continuum . At one end of the spectrum are people who do not make themselves available to you quickly enough to help solve your problem . At the other end of the spectrum are those who are willing to engage actively in problem solving with you in a timely fashion . With this continuum in mind , how would you rate your overall ability to access this person’s thinking and knowledge ? 1 = Extremely weak , 5 = Extremely strong , 0 = I do not know this person . Cost ( C ) Seeking information or advice from other people can be costly . For example , with some people you may not feel comfortable revealing your own lack of knowledge on a given topic . Alternatively , people you ask for information may make you feel excessively indebted to them . In light of such interpersonal risks and obligations , please indicate the extent to which you feel that seeking information or advice from this person is costly . 1 = Very costly , 5 = Not at all costly , 0 = I do not know this person . Information ( I ) ( GetInfo ) Please indicate how often you have turned to this person for information or knowledge on work - related topics in the past 3 months . 1 = Never , 5 = Very frequently , 0 = I do not know this person . ( GiveInfo ) Please indicate how often this person has turned to you for information or knowledge on work - related topics in the past 3 months . 1 = Never , 5 = Very frequently , 0 = I do not know this person . variables were collected at the same point in time . It is assumed that the independent variables refer to aspects of enduring and ongoing relationships with others , while the dependent variable refers to discrete transitory events that recently occurred . 6 Respondents were not required to rate their rela - tionships with people they did not know . Thus , not every person has ratings for every other person in the network . These pairs were coded with missing values . In addition , to facilitate interpretation , all variables were standardized . Because each of our variables is an N × N matrix , this means that , for each one , the average of all nonmissing cells in the entire matrix ( excluding the diagonal ) is zero and the standard deviation is one . Obviously , standardization does not affect signiﬁcance levels or r - squared values . An important issue in network data collection con - cerns respondent accuracy . Research has shown that respondents have difﬁculty accurately recalling with whom they did what with in a speciﬁc time period ( Bernard et al . 1982 ) . For example , no matter what time period is being asked about , respondents tend to bias answers toward long - run frequencies ( Freeman et al . 1987 ) . This is of some concern in measuring our dependent variable , information seeking , because our objective is to predict who really went to whom for information ( rather than perception of informa - tion seeking ) . To mitigate accuracy problems , we used an estimate pooling technique . Instead of asking only : How often did you turn to X for information ? ( GetInfo ) , we also asked : How often has X turned to you for information ? ( GiveInfo ) . Then , to construct the dependent variable , we took the average of the GetInfo variable and the transpose of the GiveInfo variable ( Borgatti et al . 1999 ) . In other words , to eval - uate the extent to which person i sought information from person j , we took the average of two estimates : ( 1 ) the amount i claimed to seek information from j , and ( 2 ) the amount that j indicated that he or she was sought out by i . We also collected demographic data , including each person’s hierarchical position in the organization , tenure within the group ( in months ) , gender , and 6 In network analysis , this is known as the backcloth / trafﬁc distinc - tion ( Atkin 1972 ) . Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 437 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks physical location ( which ofﬁce they worked in ) . All of these were used to construct control variables . In the case of hierarchical position and tenure , for each ordered pair of persons , we subtracted the second person’s value ( such as number of months in the orga - nization ) from the ﬁrst person’s . In the case of gender and location , we constructed dyadic variables X in which X ij = 1 if persons i and j had the same value on gender ( or location ) , and X ij = 0 otherwise . Hierarchy difference was included because of the possibility that it affects both access ( lower - ranking members are more accessible ) and information seeking . Tenure dif - ference was included because , according to the com - munities of practice literature ( Lave and Wenger 1991 , Wenger 1998 ) , newer members should know less and , therefore , be less likely to be sought for informa - tion . Gender homophily and physical proximity are well - established factors affecting communication fre - quency . To test the model statistically , we used network correlation and regression . Network data do not sat - isfy assumptions of statistical inference in classical regression because the observations are not inde - pendent . Consequently , special procedures known as quadratic assignment procedure ( QAP ) and multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure ( MRQAP ) ( Baker and Hubert 1981 , Krackhardt 1988 , Borgatti et al . 1999 ) were used to run the correlations and multiple regressions , respectively . QAP and MRQAP are identical to their nonnetwork counterparts with respect to parameter estimates , but use a randomiza - tion / permutation technique ( Edgington 1969 , Noreen 1989 ) to construct signiﬁcance tests . Signiﬁcance lev - els for correlations and regressions are based on distri - butions generated from 10 , 000 random permutations . Results As an introduction to the results , Table 2 gives the matrix of correlations among all variables in each site . Beginning with the information scientists ( Table 2a ) , several observations may be made . First , correlations involving the control variables are virtually nonexis - tent , with proximity being the only control variable correlated with information seeking . Second , except for cost , all of the independent variables are pos - itively and strongly correlated with the dependent variable . Third , a few of the correlations among the independent variables are fairly large but well within acceptable limits for joint inclusion in a regression model ( Nunnally 1978 ) . Turning our attention to the genomic researchers ( Table 2b ) , we can observe a sim - ilar pattern of correlations . In fact , a QAP correla - tion between the two correlation matrices is 0 . 749 , indicating that the two sites yield similar patterns of intercorrelation among variables , which attests to the reliability and stability of the constructs in different settings . Table 3a gives the regression results for the infor - mation scientists . The coefﬁcients presented in the table are standardized regression coefﬁcients . In the ﬁrst model , we enter only the four control variables . The results show that , as a set , the controls have little effect on information seeking ( the percent of variance accounted for is 3 % ) , but proximity and sameness of gender are signiﬁcant ( with the negative coefﬁcient indicating a tendency to seek out the other gender ) . In the fourth model , we simultaneously add the know - ing , value , access , and cost relations and ﬁnd that the variance accounted for substantially improves to 56 % . The results provide clear support for Hypothesis 1 ( knowing another’s expertise leads to seeking infor - mation from them ) , Hypothesis 2 ( valuing another’s expertise in relation to one’s work leads to seeking information from them ) , and Hypothesis 3 ( access to another’s thinking leads to seeking information from them ) . However , Hypothesis 4 ( low cost of interaction leads to seeking information ) was not supported . We now turn to the regressions for the genomic researchers in Table 3b . The ﬁrst model includes only the control variables . As with the information sci - entists , proximity and gender are signiﬁcant , but in this case , there is a tendency to turn to people of the same rather than different gender . In the fourth model , we simultaneously add the knowing , value , access , and cost relations and ﬁnd once again that variance accounted for substantially improves to 34 % . Consistent with the information scientists , the results provide clear support for Hypothesis 1 ( knowing ) , Hypothesis 2 ( valuing ) , and Hypothesis 3 ( access ) , but do not support Hypothesis 4 ( cost ) . Per Hypothesis 5 , we were also interested in assess - ing whether our variables mediated the relationship 438 Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks Table 2 Correlations of Control , Relational Variables , and Information Seeking H T G P K V A C I ( a ) Information scientists H 1 (cid:1) 00 T − 0 (cid:1) 06 1 (cid:1) 00 G 0 (cid:1) 00 0 (cid:1) 00 1 (cid:1) 00 P 0 (cid:1) 00 0 (cid:1) 00 0 (cid:1) 01 1 (cid:1) 00 K − 0 (cid:1) 04 0 (cid:1) 08 − 0 (cid:1) 04 0 (cid:1) 10 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 V − 0 (cid:1) 06 0 (cid:1) 03 − 0 (cid:1) 06 0 (cid:1) 05 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 64 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 A − 0 (cid:1) 08 0 (cid:1) 01 − 0 (cid:1) 07 0 (cid:1) 20 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 61 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 63 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 C − 0 (cid:1) 14 0 (cid:1) 03 − 0 (cid:1) 02 0 (cid:1) 17 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 50 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 46 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 66 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 I 0 (cid:1) 01 0 (cid:1) 00 − 0 (cid:1) 07 0 (cid:1) 17 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 65 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 68 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 63 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 45 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 Mean 3 (cid:1) 63 3 (cid:1) 46 3 (cid:1) 67 3 (cid:1) 96 2 (cid:1) 22 ( SD ) 1 (cid:1) 08 1 (cid:1) 18 1 (cid:1) 09 0 (cid:1) 99 1 (cid:1) 32 ( b ) Genomic researchers H 1 (cid:1) 00 T 0 (cid:1) 26 1 (cid:1) 00 G 0 (cid:1) 00 0 (cid:1) 00 1 (cid:1) 00 P 0 (cid:1) 00 0 (cid:1) 00 0 (cid:1) 07 1 (cid:1) 00 K − 0 (cid:1) 09 0 (cid:1) 05 0 (cid:1) 09 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 17 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 V − 0 (cid:1) 13 − 0 (cid:1) 07 0 (cid:1) 09 ∗ 0 (cid:1) 07 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 51 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 A 0 (cid:1) 18 ∗ 0 (cid:1) 04 0 (cid:1) 10 ∗ 0 (cid:1) 12 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 27 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 34 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 C 0 (cid:1) 25 ∗ 0 (cid:1) 11 − 0 (cid:1) 01 0 (cid:1) 08 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 07 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 16 ∗ 0 (cid:1) 57 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 I − 0 (cid:1) 18 − 0 (cid:1) 02 0 (cid:1) 17 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 17 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 42 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 39 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 47 ∗∗ 0 (cid:1) 22 ∗∗ 1 (cid:1) 00 Mean 3 (cid:1) 14 3 (cid:1) 89 3 (cid:1) 80 4 (cid:1) 10 2 (cid:1) 63 ( SD ) 1 (cid:1) 40 1 (cid:1) 04 1 (cid:1) 06 0 (cid:1) 97 1 (cid:1) 20 ∗ = p < 0 (cid:1) 05 , ∗∗ = p < 0 (cid:1) 01 .

To establish mediation , three conditions must hold ( Baron and Kenney 1986 ) . First , physical prox - imity must predict the mediating variables ( know - ing , access , and cost ) . For the information scientists , proximity was a signiﬁcant predictor of knowing ( p < 0 (cid:1) 05 ) , access ( p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) , and cost ( p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) . Sim - ilarly , for the genomic researchers , proximity was a signiﬁcant predictor of knowing ( p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) , access ( p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) , and cost ( p < 0 (cid:1) 05 ) . Second , physical prox - imity must predict the dependent variable ( informa - tion seeking ) . In Model 1 of Table 3 , we show that physical proximity predicted information seeking for both the information scientists ( p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) and the genomic researchers ( p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) . Finally , the coefﬁcient for proximity must become nonsigniﬁcant when we control for mediating variables . As shown in Table 3 , the results from the information scientists are consis - tent with the mediation hypothesis for two of the four relations . Speciﬁcally , the knowing and access rela - tions mediate the effect of proximity on information seeking . Value was not hypothesized to relate to prox - imity , and cost fails because , as we have already seen , it does not predict information seeking . Turning to the genomic researchers , results again are consistent with the mediation hypothesis via the knowing and access relations . A summary of ﬁndings with respect to each hy - pothesis is given in Table 4 . We ﬁnd that three of the relations—knowing , value , and access—consistently predict information seeking . In contrast , the cost rela - tion does not . With respect to the mediation hypoth - esis , there was support for proximity being mediated by knowing and access relations .

Table 4 Summary of Hypotheses and Findings Hypothesis Support Hypothesis 1 ( Knowing ) : The extent to which actor i seeks information from actor j is a positive function of the extent to which actor i knows what actor j ’s areas of expertise are . Full Hypothesis 2 ( Value ) : The extent to which actor i seeks information from actor j is a positive function of the extent to which actor i positively evaluates actor j ’s knowledge and skills in domains relevant to his or her work . Full Hypothesis 3 ( Access ) : The extent to which actor i seeks information from actor j is a positive function of the extent to which actor i has access to actor j ’s thinking . Full Hypothesis 4 ( Cost ) : The extent to which actor i seeks information from actor j is a negative function of the costs that actor i believes he or she will incur as a result of asking j for help . No Hypothesis 5 ( Mediation ) : Knowing , access , and cost relations mediate the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking . Partial ( Cost is not signiﬁcant ) Discussion and Conclusion We have known for some time that relationships are important for acquisition of information ( Granovet - ter 1973 , Allen 1977 , Burt 1992 ) and that the cre - ation of knowledge is a social process ( Mead 1934 , Wittgenstein 1953 , Berger and Luckman 1966 ) . Yet despite the importance of social interaction as a vehi - cle for knowledge acquisition , we know little about the learned relational characteristics that facilitate information seeking . Our study offers evidence of at least three enduring relational characteristics that are predictive of the behavior of information seeking : ( 1 ) knowing what another person knows , ( 2 ) valu - ing what that other person knows in relation to one’s work , and ( 3 ) being able to gain timely access to that person’s thinking . Interestingly , although cost emerged as an impor - tant factor in prior qualitative work ( Cross and Borgatti 2000 ) , it was not statistically signiﬁcant in either research site . This could be a product of response bias—an unwillingness to say negative 440 Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks things about others . However , we took several mea - sures to ensure against this in the survey process ( e . g . , guarantee of nondisclosure and responses sent directly to third - party researchers ) . Rather , we believe one of two explanations could account for this ﬁnd - ing . First , from a cultural perspective , it could be that cost functions as a characteristic of a group as a whole , affecting whether or how often people seek information from others in general , rather than as a determinant of who is sought out . 7 This line of reasoning is consistent with Edmondson’s ( 1999 ) ﬁnd - ings in relation to psychological safety as a collec - tive property of teams , and represents an interesting avenue for further research . Alternatively , the answer could lie in the choice of dependent variable . We sought to predict the behavior of information seeking and so asked about frequency of interaction rather than effectiveness . In today’s time constrained world , people might be forced to seek out available others out of necessity and pay lit - tle heed to costs of interaction . Thus , cost might not affect the behavior of information seeking , but might come into play in terms of learning in the interac - tion . Low - cost relations might promote learning via willingness to expose lack of knowledge and explore alternative solutions . This explanation is consistent with the ﬁnding in Cross et al . ( 2001a ) that dyadic trust matters in problem - framing interactions but not for simple information exchange . A second point of interest in this work is the ﬁnd - ing that knowing and access variables mediate the relationship between physical proximity and informa - tion seeking . This extends the literature on proximity by identifying relational mechanisms through which physical propinquity leads to information exchange . As organizations consider open spaces or other envi - ronments to promote interaction among employees , it is important that social interventions develop knowl - edge and access relations as they are the factors that ultimately inform information seeking . Virtual work might also beneﬁt from these ﬁndings . While stag - ing of face - to - face interactions during the course of a given project is important , alternative means can 7 In fact , the variance of the cost variable was the lowest of all the relational variables . also be employed to develop relational conditions of knowing and access ( e . g . , skill proﬁling systems , developmental stafﬁng practices , or action - learning techniques ) . One of the strengths of this study is that we have replicated the ﬁndings by testing the model with data from two separate organizations . The great bulk of work in the social network tradition has largely drawn conclusions based on a single social network within one organization in one industry . This research has tested our model in two organizations on groups engaged in seemingly different forms of work and found consistent results . Of course , this study has signiﬁcant limitations as well . First , our theoretical model is temporally ordered in the sense that we believe that the indepen - dent variables ( knowing , valuing , access , and cost ) enable the dependent variable ( information seeking ) . Yet , because our data are cross sectional , we can only test for the existence of a statistical relation - ship among the variables and cannot draw conclu - sions about the direction of causality . Thus , the test of the model is valid because nonsigniﬁcant results would have falsiﬁed the theory , but it is also a weak test because the results are consistent not only with our proposed model but others as well ( e . g . , that information seeking affects knowing , valuing , access , and cost , and not the other way around ) . However , prior qualitative research ( Cross and Borgatti 2000 ) found that informants choose who to seek information from based on their perceptions of and relationships with others , indicating causality in the hypothesized direction . Our model is also incomplete in the sense that we did not account for potentially moderating ﬁrm - wide variables such as organizational climate . For example , as footnoted previously , we found that the cost variable had little variance and was not signiﬁ - cantly related to information seeking , however , it is possible that this is a product of cultural norms mak - ing information - seeking behavior acceptable . Theo - retically , this suggests a more complicated model in which some dyadic variables take on greater impor - tance in the absence of cultural attributes . Despite these empirical limitations , we feel that the study provides a platform for further theoriz - Management Science / Vol . 49 , No . 4 , April 2003 441 BORGATTI AND CROSS A Relational View in Social Networks ing on transactive memory , social capital , and orga - nizational learning . In terms of transactive mem - ory , a key question is : What relationships need to exist for a group to leverage its collective exper - tise ? The largely laboratory - based research to date has focused on the knowing relation in demonstrating performance implications of collective agreement on “who knows what . ” 8 As this work moves into ﬁeld settings—where temporal pacing of tasks , interdepen - dence of jobs , physical location of workers , and def - inition of problem or goal are not controlled by the researcher—other relational characteristics will likely need to be accounted for to ensure that a group lever - ages its collective expertise . We hope future research on transactive memory will assess ways in which net - work structure and relational features , such as valu - ing and access , affect the ability of a group to beneﬁt from distributed expertise . Finally , we feel our results hold the potential to fur - ther theorizing on organizational learning concepts of absorptive capacity and path dependence . In terms of absorptive capacity , employing social network anal - ysis to map the above relations could offer insight into central individuals or cliques that disproportion - ately account for an organization’s ability to recognize valuable new information , assimilate it , and apply it to new ends . Theorists originally suggested that an organization’s “absorptive capacity”—its ability to take in and make use of new knowledge—is a prod - uct of both the “character and distribution of exper - tise within the organization” ( Cohen and Levinthal 1990 , p . 132 ) . To date , few have focused on the lat - ter issue of the distribution of expertise ( Zahra and George 2002 ) . We suggest that the construct of absorp - tive capacity should be framed in a way that accounts for both existing knowledge and the relations that facilitate information exchange in light of new prob - lems . We can use knowing , value , and access relations to identify central individuals ( Freeman 1979 ) or coali - tions ( Everett and Borgatti 1999 ) whose knowledge is likely to be inﬂuential in absorbing new information . In addition , we suggest that a dynamic exten - sion of the model presented here could , in future research , provide new insight into path dependence 8 See Rulke and Galaskiewicz ( 2000 ) for a discussion . in organizational learning ( e . g . , Cohen and Levinthal 1990 , March 1991 ) . We noted earlier that qualita - tive research ( Cross and Borgatti 2000 ) had indi - cated that the knowing , valuing , access , and cost relations enabled information seeking . However , the same research also found that when we do engage with others ( e . g . , when seeking information from them ) , we recalibrate our understanding of their skills and knowledge , as well as how to gain access to them most effectively and what the potential costs might be of interacting with them . As we update our under - standing of others , we affect our probability of inter - acting with them in the future , creating a dynamic feedback system ( as shown in Figure 1 ) . For example , discovering that a person is not help - ful , reduces the probability of interacting with them , which means that knowledge of their expertise and how best to access them begins to fade . In contrast , having a positive interaction may reduce access barri - ers and lead to future interactions , increasing knowl - edge of that source’s expertise . Over time , people may lock in to a limited set of people with whom they frequently interact , which might be efﬁcient but yield suboptimal information if other people are better sources . This extended network model might provide a formal explanation of the mechanism underlying path dependence in information search and , therefore , organizational learning . Given the importance of peo - ple as critical sources of knowledge and information , we hope future research on organizational learning will consider the role of both structural and relational attributes of networks in understanding absorptive capacity and path dependence .

Mapping infor - mation seeking alone does not necessarily provide a clear path to intervention . For example , we may ﬁnd that one group has no information - seeking ties with another , but without knowing why it is difﬁcult to suggest interventions . However , if we regard infor - mation seeking as resulting from relational character - istics we propose , then we can assess which relation or combination of relations is the problem for a given network . For example , if the problem in a group lies with it not “knowing what it knows , ” we might sug - gest action learning , developmental stafﬁng practices , or skill proﬁling systems to help create knowledge of “who knows what . ” In contrast , if a group is hav - ing problems with access , we might consider perfor - mance metrics that encourage people to be accessible to others in combination with peer feedback processes to ensure that this happens . On the technical front , one might consider distributed or wireless technolo - gies to allow people the ability to access each other . By examining the relations we have proposed , we can begin to diagnose a network and design interventions with greater accuracy than if we just assessed existing information networks .
