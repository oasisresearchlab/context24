Phanstiel ( douglas _ phanstiel @ med . unc . edu ) and Hyejung Won ( hyejung _ won @ med . unc . edu ) ABSTRACT 3D chromatin structure has been shown to play a role in regulating gene transcription during biological transitions . While our understanding of loop formation and maintenance is rapidly improving , much less is known about the mechanisms driving changes in looping and the impact of differential looping on gene transcription . One limitation has been a lack of well powered differential looping data sets . To address this , we conducted a deeply sequenced Hi - C time course of megakaryocyte development comprising 4 biological replicates and 6 billion reads per time point . Statistical analysis revealed 1 , 503 differential loops . Gained loops were enriched for AP - 1 occupancy and correlated with increased expression of genes at their anchors . Lost loops were characterized by increases in expression of genes within the loop boundaries . Linear modeling revealed that changes in histone H3 K27 acetylation , chromatin accessibility , and JUN binding in between the loop anchors were as predictive of changes in loop strength as changes to CTCF and / or cohesin occupancy at loop anchors . Finally , we built linear models and found that incorporating the dynamics of enhancer acetylation and loop strength increased accuracy of gene expression predictions . INTRODUCTION The three dimensional ( 3D ) organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in transcriptional reg - ulation and has been implicated in many biological pro - cesses , including cellular differentiation and response to external stimuli 1 . While several types of 3D chromatin structures exist , chromatin loops are of particular interest as they are thought to regulate gene expression by bring - ing distal regulatory elements ( e . g . enhancers ) into close physical proximity with gene promoters via point to point interactions . Indeed , loop anchors are typically enriched for enhancers and promoters and correlate with differ - ences in gene expression 2 – 4 . Aberrations to chromatin looping are associated with a variety of human diseases and developmental disorders such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome 5 , polydactyly 6 , 7 , and cancer 8 , 9 . While the basic mechanisms of loop formation have been established , major questions remain regarding the mechanisms driv - ing differential looping during biological development and their functional impact . The vast majority of chromatin loops are thought to form through a process called loop extrusion , in which the cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA and reels in chromatin until it reaches convergently bound CTCF proteins 10 . In specific cell types and biological condi - tions chromatin loops can form through non - canonical mechanisms including phase separation 8 , 11 , 12 or binding of lineage - specific factors like LDB1 8 , 11 , 12 . While chro - matin loops have been shown to change over cellular transitions , the mechanisms that govern these structural changes , and the impact of these changes on gene ex - pression , remain poorly understood 13 , 14 . The relationship between looping and gene expres - sion is even less clear . Cell type specific loops correlate with differential expression patterns , supporting a role for loops in gene regulation 15 – 17 . Moreover , forced loop - ing between enhancers and promoters at select loci has been shown to activate transcription 18 , 19 . However , sev - eral recent studies have called the role of loops in reg - ulating gene expression into question . Live cell imaging of looping between SOX2 and an enhancer known to regulate its expression showed no correlation between enhancer - promoter proximity and gene transcription 20 . In another study , rapid and thorough degradation of co - hesin led to a complete removal of cohesin - driven loops 2 in human cancer cells with only a minor impact on gene expression 14 . In summary , the degree to which chromatin looping regulates gene expression is still unresolved . One impediment to answering these questions is that identifying differential loops between cells and conditions remains challenging . Due to the depth of sequencing required for Hi - C data sets , the statistical requirements of differential analysis , and the cost of DNA sequencing , most existing differential looping studies lack the sta - tistical power to adequately identify differential loops . And without comprehensive and rigorously defined sets of differential loops , it is challenging to determine what mechanisms drive differential looping and what tran - scriptional impact they have . To address this gap , we generated a deeply sequenced Hi - C data set characterizing the differentiation of K562 cells into a megakaryocyte - like state . By sequencing over 18 billion reads across three timepoints and four biolog - ical replicates , we achieved a statistical power of roughly 0 . 932 and identified 1 , 503 differential loops . Generation and intersection with accompanying maps of chromatin accessibility , histone acetylation , transcription factor ( TF ) binding , and gene expression revealed insights into both the mechanisms and the functional impacts of differen - tial looping during cellular differentiation . Interestingly , we find that regulatory features both at and between loop anchors correlate with changes in loop strength . Finally , we show that incorporating H3 K27 acetylation and chro - matin looping dynamics into linear models in addition to promoter acetylation improves predictions of changes in gene expression . RESULTS Differentiation of K562 cells induces large - scale changes to 3D chromatin structure across multiple scales To understand how 3D chromatin structures change over cellular differentiation , we performed a deeply sequenced , 3 timepoint Hi - C time course tracking the differentiation of K562 cells into a megakaryocyte - like state 21 . We treated K562 cells with phorbol 12 - myrisate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , which has been shown to induce a megakaryocyte - like phenotype 21 , 22 , for 0 , 6 , and 72h . We confirmed differentiation using qPCR for ITGB3 , a mega - karyocyte marker 23 ( Fig S1A ) . As K562 cells differentiate into a megakaryocyte - like state , they lose their potential to differentiate into erythroid cells . We confirmed this with qPCR for KLF1 , an erythroid marker , which decreases in expression over differentiation 24 ( Fig S1B ) . We then performed in situ Hi - C on four biological replicates and sequenced them to a depth of roughly 6 billion reads per time point ( Table S1 ) . We generated Hi - C contact maps using the Juicer pipeline 15 , identified compartments using the EigenVector package 25 , topologically associ - ating domains ( TADs ) using arrowhead 15 , and chromatin loops using SIP 26 ( Fig S1C ) . Replicates exhibited high similarity as measured by principal component analysis ( PCA ) ( Fig S1D ) . Visual inspection of the data revealed clear chang - es at multiple scales including nuclear compartments , TADs , and chromatin loops ( Fig 1A - C ) . To assess the se - quencing depth and replicates required to achieve suf - ficient statistical power , we analyzed our data set using the RNASeqPower package 27 . Using our dispersion of 0 . 0019 and median sequencing depth of 38 counts per million ( CPM ) per loop , the statistical power to detect 2 - fold changes was 0 . 932 , which is generally considered to be well - powered 28 ( Fig 1D ) . We used the dispersion from our Hi - C data to model predicted statistical power across multiple different sequencing depths and num - bers of replicates ( Fig 1D ) . Holding sequencing depth per replicate constant , we found that decreasing to 3 or 2 replicates reduced the power estimates to 0 . 762 and 0 . 416 respectively . To determine how this increase in power translated into the number of differential loops , we subsampled our data to multiple depths and analyzed it with 2 , 3 , or all 4 replicates ( Fig 1E ) . Using our full data set of four biological replicates ( ~ 900 million reads per replicate ) we identified 1 , 503 differential loops using DESeq2 29 with a log - 2 fold change ( LFC ) greater than 1 . 5 ( adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 ) compared to only 698 and 45 identified with 3 or 2 replicates respectively ( Fig 1E ) . This underscores how critical sequencing depth is in the sen - sitivity to detect differential loops . Finally , we confirmed the quality of these differential loops through aggregate peak analysis 15 ( APA ) , showing that gained loops have higher contact at 72 vs 0 h , and lost loops have higher contact at 0 vs 72 h ( Fig 1F ) . Genes at the anchors of gained , but not lost , loops ex - hibit concordant changes in expression To assess the potential transcriptional impacts of differ - ential loops , we performed RNA - seq across 8 time points ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 , 3 , 6 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h ) in K562 cells treated with PMA . DESeq2 analysis identified 3 , 190 differential genes ( adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 , LFC > 2 ) which were grouped into 6 clusters using k - means clustering ( Fig 2A ) . The biggest and most unique changes were observed at 6 and 72 hours ( 1 , 619 differential , 527 unique genes after 6 h ; 1 , 925 differential , 236 unique genes after 72 h ) , which coincide exactly with our selected Hi - C timepoints . Consistent with the differentiation of these cells into a megakaryocyte - like state , the upregulated genes were enriched for Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms relating to cell 3 differentiation , cell adhesion , and morphogenesis , and pathways including focal adhesion , hematopoietic cell lineage , and regulation of actin cytoskeleton ( Fig S2A - B ) . Upregulated genes include megakaryocyte markers VWF , FLI1 , and ITGB3 , further supporting acquisition of a megakaryocyte - like phenotype . To determine the relationship between differential loops and gene transcription , we intersected the pro - moters of differential genes with differential loop calls ( Fig 2B ) . We found that 9 % ( 126 of 1 , 503 ) of differential loop anchors overlapped a differential gene promoter . Interestingly , 93 % ( 75 out of 81 ) of gained loops that overlapped a differential gene promoter showed the same direction of change as the gene ( p = 2 . 91 x 10 - 16 , binomial test ) ( Fig 2C ) . This is consistent with our previ - ous work in macrophages 30 , 31 and suggests that gained loops are relevant in increasing transcription of genes at their anchors . Upregulated genes found at the anchors of gained loops include TGFB1 and THBS1 , both of which are megakaryocyte - related 32 , 33 . An example of a gained loop with a concordant increase in gene expression is present at the INHBA locus ( Fig 2D ) . In contrast , lost loops that overlapped a differential gene promoter showed no such concordant behavior , with only 33 % ( 15 out of 45 ) exhibiting the same direc - tional change as the gene ( p = 0 . 04 , binomial test ) ( Fig 2C ) . These findings again agree with our previous work in mac - rophages 30 , 31 , where we did not see a significant decrease in expression of genes at lost loop anchors , suggesting that loss of looping is not sufficient to decrease transcrip - Figure 1 .

This is also consistent with work by Rao et al that found almost no change in gene transcription fol - lowing virtually complete abrogation of loop - extrusion 14 . Taken together , this suggests that loss of looping is gen - erally not sufficient to induce a decrease in transcriptional output of genes at loop anchors . The anti - concordance we observed at loop anchors was also observed when looking at genes found between loop anchors . 45 % of lost loops ( 228 out of 503 ) had a differential gene between their anchors , 64 % of which ( 146 out of 228 ) overlapped Figure 2 .

Genes that overlapped the interior of lost loops were expressed at significantly higher levels compared to genes within gained loops ( p = 1 . 85 x 10 - 23 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) ( Fig S2D ) . This also agrees with our work in macrophages 30 , 31 showing that extremely high expression of genes within loop boundaries was associated with a weakening of the loop , suggesting that high transcription at loop interiors might antagonize loop extrusion . Indeed , several other studies provide evidence that transcription can serve as a barrier to and / or interfere with loop extru - sion 34 – 36 . Gained loops are associated with increased accessi - bility at AP - 1 motifs To assess which TFs were involved in loop based regu - lation , we mapped chromatin accessibility using ATAC - seq in K562 cells treated with PMA for 0 , 6 , and 72 h . Differential chromatin accessibility analysis with DESeq2 revealed 37 , 609 differential peaks ( adjusted p - value , LFC > 2 ) , which we grouped into 4 clusters based on whether the peak reached maximal or minimal normalized counts at 6 or 72h ( Fig 2E ) . As was the case with gene expres - sion , differential chromatin accessibility peaks were highly concordant at the anchors of gained , but not lost , loops ( Fig 2F - G ) . To understand the mechanisms driving differential looping we performed TF motif enrichment on various sets of ATAC peaks at loops anchors ( Fig 2H ) . As expected CTCF was the most enriched motif at ATAC peaks overlap - ping all loop anchors , which is consistent with its known role in loop formation and maintenance . In contrast , peaks of gained chromatin accessibility at gained loop anchors were highly enriched for Activator Protein 1 ( AP - 1 ) fam - ily members . This is consistent with our previous work showing the enrichment of AP - 1 at the anchors of gained loops during macrophage development 30 . Peaks of de - creased chromatin accessibility at lost loop anchors were enriched for Gata family members , albeit to a far lesser degree compared to the enrichments observed at all or gained loops . GATA TFs have a well established role in me - diating cell fate decisions in myeloid cell development 37 – 39 . Differential looping is associated with chromatin fea - tures both at and between loop anchors To gain further insight into the mechanisms driving dif - ferential looping , we generated matched CUT & RUN data - sets for multiple TFs and histone modifications . Due to the enrichment of AP - 1 motifs at the anchors of gained loops , we performed CUT & RUN for JUN , a member of the AP - 1 family . We also targeted histone H3 K27 acetylation , which is commonly used to identify putative enhancers , and CTCF and RAD21 , proteins with known roles in DNA looping . For each assay , we performed differential anal - ysis and compared how each differential feature corre - sponds to differential looping ( Fig S3A - D ) . For all fea - tures , we observed statistically significant concordance at gained loop anchors ( Fig 3A - B ) . With the notable exception of RNA , all features were also concordant at lost loop anchors , albeit to a lesser degree . Investigating these trends more closely revealed two prominent features . First , while all features increased at gained loop anchors , some exhibited bigger chang - es than others . Surprisingly , the canonical mediators of chromatin looping , CTCF and RAD21 , increased by only 1 . 26 - and 1 . 23 - fold respectively at gained loop anchors . In contrast , histone H3 K27ac increased nearly 14 - fold at gained loop anchors ( median = 13 . 86 - fold ) . Chroma - tin accessibility and JUN binding increased by modest amounts , 1 . 72 - and 2 . 16 - fold respectively . Second , while increased signals were observed at gained loop anchors , they were also observed between loop anchors . For ex - ample chromatin accessibility and histone H3 K27ac peaks within the boundaries of gained loops increased by 2 . 99 - and 11 . 52 - fold respectively . Examples of these trends are evident at the TBX3 lo - cus ( Fig 3C ) . Gained enhancer - promoter looping is asso - ciated with increases in CTCF and RAD21 occupancy at loop anchors as well as large gains in chromatin accessi - bility and JUN occupancy at , between , and even beyond loop boundaries . Expression of TBX3 itself , a TF known to regulate developmental transitions 40 , increases by over 50 fold . Taken together these results suggest that differ - ential looping may involve more than just alterations to CTCF and RAD21 occupancy . They may also be mediated by chromatin modifying proteins and condition - specific TF binding events that act both at loop anchors and with - in the loop interior . Changes in chromatin features predict changes in chromatin looping To explore this further and determine which chromatin features are the most predictive of changes in chroma - tin looping , we investigated how changes in each feature correlated with changes in looping ( Fig 4A ) . Despite the relatively small fold change of CTCF peaks at differential loop anchors , we found that CTCF occupancy changes had the highest correlation ( R 2 = 0 . 189 ) with loop log2 fold - change ( Fig 4A ) , consistent with the role of CTCF in the formation and maintenance of loops . However , chang - es to multiple features in the loop “interior”—the region in between the two anchors—also strongly exhibited strong correlations with differential looping . Interior chromatin accessibility , histone H3 K27 acetylation , and JUN occu - pancy had correlations of 0 . 175 , 0 . 154 , 0 . 127 , followed by anchor RAD21 occupancy ( R 2 = 0 . 117 ) . Several features 6 exhibited very slight negative correlations including inte - rior gene expression and CTCF occupancy , which is con - sistent with each of these having the ability to antagonize loop extrusions as previously described 13 , 34 , 41 . In addition to correlations with changes in looping , many of the fea - tures are highly correlated with each other ( Fig S4 ) . Given the relationships between changes in looping and multiple features both at and between loop anchors , we next asked if we could build a better model to predict differential looping using multiple features simultaneous - ly . We used the caret package to perform LASSO regres - sion 42 , 43 . We selected 1 , 127 differential loops and 2 , 254 non - differential loops that were matched for distance and contact frequency as our training set and held out 376 differential loops and 752 non - differential loops as a testing set to evaluate our model . We then used LASSO with 10 cross - validations to generate a predictive mod - el using various sets of features ( Fig 4A ) and evaluated it by applying it to our test set . Using all anchor features improved the correlation to R 2 = 0 . 279 , far higher than us - ing the best single feature alone ( CTCF anchor max , R 2 = 0 . 189 ; Fig 4B ) . Surprisingly , using only interior features yielded an even more accurate model with an R 2 of 0 . 317 ( Fig 4B ) . Combining all features at both the anchors and interiors produced the strongest predictions with an R 2 of 0 . 405 ( Fig 4B - C ) . Further , the model accurately pre - dicted the signs of 91 % of gained loops and 72 % of lost loops . The predictive power of histone H3 K27 acetyla - tion , chromatin accessibility , and JUN occupancy is sur - prising , and especially so given that the highest correla - tions were observed within loop boundaries rather than at anchors themselves . This may suggest that epigenetic changes between anchor sites play a significant role in modulating loop strength . Figure 3 . Changes in chromatin features are correlated with changes in looping .

Recent advances have been made by incorporating both 2D ( e . g . histone H3 K27 acetyla - tion ) and 3D ( e . g . Hi - C contacts ) features into the Activ - ity - By - Contact model of gene regulation 44 . This model has been successful in assigning enhancers to their tar - get genes but has typically been applied to resting cells rather than biological transitions . A notable exception is Beagan et al . that correlated changes to ABC score to changes in gene expression 45 albeit at only a handful of genomic loci . We leveraged this approach to determine if chromatin dynamics could help predict changes in gene expression in a genome - wide fashion . To evaluate our ability to predict changes in gene ex - pression we built and evaluated four linear models . In the first model , changes in gene expression were predicted based solely on changes in promoter H3 K27ac which performed well with an R 2 of 0 . 401 ( Fig 5A ) . In the second model , adding information from the nearest enhancer slightly decreased the predictive power ( Wilcoxon rank sum test on permutations , p = 1 . 99 x 10 - 6 ; median R 2 = 0 . 401 ; Fig 5B ) . In contrast , in the third model , by combin - ing H3 K27ac information from both the promoter and enhancers that were physically looped to the promoter , the R 2 increased significantly to 0 . 421 ( Wilcoxon rank sum test on permutations , p = 1 . 99 x 10 - 122 ; Fig 5B ) . We then calculated a modified ABC score ( see methods ) by taking the product of loop strength and distal enhancer activity for each looped enhancer - promoter pair , sum - ming across all enhancers that were looped to each gene , and then calculating the fold - change . Finally , the last lin - ear model built using both promoter histone H3 K27ac and change in ABC score increased the R 2 even further to 0 . 467 ( Fig 5D ) , a significant improvement compared to all other models ( Wilcoxon rank sum test on permutations , p = 1 . 95 x 10 - 182 ; Fig 5E - F ) . The improvement was even more drastic when building and applying the model to specifically differential genes and differential loops . For the models built on differential genes and loops , R 2 val - ues improve from 0 . 674 ( promoter only model ) to 0 . 763 for the promoter plus ABC score model ( Fig S5A - E ) . These findings suggest that alterations to both enhancer activity and contact frequency can tune transcriptional programs during cellular differentiation . DISCUSSION Collection and integration of deeply sequenced Hi - C and other genomic data characterizing the differentiation of K562 cells into a megakaryocyte - like state strengthened previous findings and provided novel observations into the mechanisms and impacts of changes to 3D chromatin structure . Our results confirmed canonical roles for CTCF and RAD21 in loop establishment and were consistent Figure 4 . Changes in chromatin features predict changes in chromatin looping .

Intriguingly , differential looping correlated with transcriptional and regulatory features both at and between loop boundaries . In many cases , the correlations with internal features were stronger than the correlation with anchor signals . These results raise fur - ther questions regarding the mechanisms driving differ - ential looping and point to previously underappreciated roles of molecules other than CTCF and cohesin . The correlation between gained loops and the expres - sion genes at their anchors agrees with many previous studies and supports the role of chromatin looping in gene activation . The increased predictive power when incorporating acetylation dynamics of looped enhancers and the dynamics of loop strength itself further empha - size this point . In contrast , loss of looping does not coin - cide with decreased expression of anchor genes . In fact , more genes were increasing in expression than decreas - ing at the anchors of lost loops . This is consistent with our previous studies of macrophage development and activa - tion , neither of which identified a decrease in expression at lost loop anchors 30 , 31 . Taken together , this suggests that while loops may be involved in transcriptional activation , loss of looping alone may not be sufficient for transcrip - tional repression or decreased expression . This agrees well with previous studies involving rapid depletion of co - hesin and subsequent global loss of loop extrusion - driven loops . Rao et al 14 found that loop elimination did not sub - stantially alter gene transcription—as measured directly using PRO - seq—in human colorectal cancer ( HCT - 116 ) cells . In contrast , loop disruption does inhibit activation of proinflammatory transcription in macrophages treat - ed with LPS 46 ( a bacterial cell wall component commonly used as a model for inflammatory activation ) , again sug - gesting that loops do play a role in gene activation . While Figure 5 . Changes in gene expression are explained by combined proximal and distal enhancer activity and loop strength .

One possible explanation is that looping imparts some sort of regulatory memory that is not erased as soon as the loop is disrupted . Similar mechanisms ( e . g . the kiss - and - run mechanism ) 47 have been suggested before . While these trends are coming into focus , more functional studies are required to understand the exact role of chromatin loop - ing in gene activation and repression . Our data also support the theory that loop loss may be a result , rather than cause , of changes in gene tran - scription . Differential genes within lost loops are signifi - cantly biased towards increased expression . And those increased genes tend to be fairly highly expressed . We observed this exact same phenomena in macrophages responding to LPS 31 . This is consistent with transcription occurring at a high level between loop boundaries being antagonistic to loop extrusion , something that is easy to imagine given that both involve fairly large molecular complexes traversing the same stretch of DNA . Indeed several previous studies have suggested that transcrip - tion can act as a molecular barrier to the loop extrusion process 34 – 36 . Interestingly , we revealed that changes to multiple other chromatin features ( i . e . chromatin accessibility , histone H3 K27 acetlyation , and AP - 1 occupancy ) are roughly as predictive as changes to known loop extru - sion - related proteins CTCF and RAD21 . The correlation between looping and these other features was strongest for features within the loop interior which may provide clues into the nature of this relationship . One intriguing possibility is that increased accessibility , histone H3 K27 acetylation , and AP - 1 binding might play a role in increasing the efficiency or rate of cohesin loading . This seems consistent with previous findings that suggested that cohesin loading takes place preferentially at active gene promoters 4 which are also associated with histone acetylation , TF binding , and chromatin accessibility . It is important to acknowledge that we can not rule out the possibility that all of these internal changes are the re - sult , rather than cause , of differential looping events . Despite the intriguing findings presented here , several limitations of this study must be considered when inter - preting the data and speculating about their meaning . First , this study is largely correlative . While intersecting the results of this study can provide important mechanistic in - sights , several of the results raise new questions that must be addressed by future functional experiments . Second , in contrast to our previous work 31 , this time - course lacked the temporal resolution to put regulatory and transcrip - tional events in temporal order , which makes it difficult to infer the direction of causality between any two fea - tures . This was a conscious decision as the current cost of sequencing makes it unfeasible to acquire deeply se - quenced data sets across deeply sampled time courses ; however , this is likely to change soon as sequencing costs continue to decrease 48 , 49 . Finally , while this study encom - passed a broad number of regulatory features—including ATAC - seq , which when combined with motif analysis can provide insights into the binding patterns of hundreds of TFs—there are a vast number of other features that likely influence looping ( e . g . DNA methylation ) for which we are not measuring nor explicitly accounting for . Despite these limitations , these findings improve our understanding of how different trans regulators and epi - genetic features govern changes in looping , as well as our understanding of the relationship between looping and gene expression . The deeply sequenced nature of this differential Hi - C analysis offers a uniquely well - pow - ered dataset with which to explore a pressing number of biological questions . Moverover , this data was acquired in one of the most widely studied human cell lines ( K562 ) for which hundreds of publicly available genome - wide data sets are already available . As such , this study pro - vides a valuable new resource for future studies of chro - matin biology . DATA AVAILABILITY Raw and processed data for Hi - C ( GSE213909 ) , RNA - seq ( GSE213386 ) , ATAC - seq ( GSE213295 ) , and CUT & RUN ( GSE213908 ) are publicly available on GEO and SRA under SuperSeries 213909 .

METHODS K562 culture and differentiation K562 were cultured in RPMI media ( Corning , cat # 10 - 040 - CV ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco , cat # 26140079 ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( PS ) ( Gibco , cat # 15140122 ) . For megakaryocyte differentiation , K562 were plated in either 6 - well plates ( RNA - seq , ATAC - seq ) or T - 175 flasks ( Hi - C , CUT & RUN ) at a density of 1 x 10 5 cells / mL and treated with 25 nM PMA ( Sigma - Aldrich , cat # P1585 - 1MG ) . After 24h , the cells become semi - ad - herent . Cells were provided with fresh media and PMA after 24h and 48h . Cells were collected without treatment or after 6 or 72h . For all treatments and library prepara - tions , K562s were thawed and immediately split into two T - 25 flasks to create biological replicates . Crosslinking Cells were cultured in T - 175 flasks containing 10 x 10 6 cells for Hi - C and 5 x 10 6 cells for CUT & RUN at 1 x 10 5 cells / mL . The collection protocol differs for where the cells are at during the differentiation . For suspended cells ( 0h and 6h ) : Media was centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min . Cells are in suspension for 0h and 6h . Suspended cells were collected and spun down 300 x g for 5 min . Pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of 1 % formaldehyde ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # 28908 ) in RPMI for 10 min with rotation . For semi - adherent cells ( 72h ) : The sus - pended cells were harvested and centrifuged for 300 x g for 5 min . Pelleted cells were resuspended in 10 mL of 1 % formaldehyde , and added to the adherent cells in the T - 175 flask to crosslink all cells at once , where they were put on the shaker for 10 min ( from here , the protocol is the same for all time points ) . Cells were quenched with cold glycine for 5 min ( Invitrogen , cat # 15527013 ) to a final concentration of 2 . 0 M for 5 min . Cells were then centri - fuged at 562 x g , resuspended in cold PBS ( Corning , cat # 21040CV ) , and split into 3 tubes of approximately 3 x 10 6 cells each ( HiC ) or 10 tubes of approximately 5 x 10 5 each ( CUT & RUN ) . Cells were spun again at 562 x g for 5 min and washed again with cold PBS , then aspirated and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 80ºC . In situ Hi - C library preparation Four treatments ( biological replicates ) were performed . For each treatment , either two or three frozen pellets ( 3 x 10 6 each ) were used to generate technical replicates ( 3 technical replicates for the first two biological replicates and 2 technical replicates for the last two biological replicates ) . Libraries were generated according to the protocol as described in Rao et al 15 . Briefly , crosslinked we lysed the cells , isolated nuclei , and used MboI ( New England Biolabs , cat # R0147L ) to digest chromatin over - night . The fragment ends were biotinylated , proximity ligated , and reverse crosslinked . Quantification of shear - ing DNA was achieved with Qubit ( dsDNA Broad Range ( BR ) assay ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # Q32850 ) . We then sheared the samples on a Covaris LE 220 ( duty factor 25 , PIP 500 , 200 cycles / burst , 90 seconds ) . 2 % of each sample was run on a 2 % agarose gel to confirm fragmentation . Size selection with AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter , cat # A63881 ) was then performed to select for DNA fragments between 300 and 500 bp . Biotinylated chromatin was pulled down with streptavidin beads . Biotin was then removed from unligated ends and the libraries were end repaired . We added the Illumina TruSeq Nano ( Set A ) ( Illumina , cat # 20015960 ) indices to each sample in a combination appropriate for pooling and amplified using 9 cycles of PCR . Final quantification was achieved using Qubit ( dsDNA High Sensitivity ( HS ) assay ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # Q32851 ) and Tapestation ( D1000 screentape ) ( Agilent , cat # 5067 - 5584 ) . Libraries were pooled to 10 nM and sequenced across 7 Illumina NovaSeq S4 lanes ( Novogene , 150 - bp paired - end ) . RT - qPCR We extracted RNA from 5 x 10 5 cells using the QIA - GEN RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , cat # 74014 ) with DNase I treatment ( Qiagen , cat # 79254 ) and quantified with a Qubit Broad Range assay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # Q32850 ) . Reverse transcription into cDNA was performed with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad , cat # 1708891 ) . qPCR was performed with the TaqMan reagents using probes for ITGB3 , KLF1 , and GAPDH ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # Hs01001469 , Hs00610592 , Hs02786624 ) . RNA - seq library preparation We extracted RNA from 5 x 10 5 cells using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini kit with DNase I treatment . To confirm qual - 11 ity of libraries , we checked RNA integrity numbers with a Tapestation RNA screentape ( Agilent , cat # 5067 - 5577 ) and confirmed them all to be above 9 . 7 . We determined the concentration of all RNA samples with the Qubit Broad Range assay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # Q10211 ) . The KAPA RNA HyperPrep kit with RiboErase ( HMR ) ( Kapa Biosciences , cat # KK8560 ) was used for library preparation . Illumina TruSeq adapters ( Illumina , cat # 20015960 ) were diluted and 0 . 0075 nmol was added to each sample . We determined library concentration and fragments size with Qubit ( dsDNA HS assay ) and Tapes - tation ( D1000 screentape ) . Libraries from each timepoint were pooled at 10 nM and each biological replicate was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 ( 75 - bp paired - end , high output kit ) . ATAC - seq library preparation We used the Omni ATAC - seq protocol as described in Corces et al 50 with some adjustments to perform ATAC - seq . Two treatments ( biological replicates ) were per - formed . For untreated and 6h , cells were harvested and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min . For semi - adherent 72h cells , all of the floating cells were harvested . Adherent cells in each well were washed with 2 mL PBS , lifted with 500 µL 0 . 5 M EDTA for 5 min , and quenched with 3 mL of RPMI before combining with the floating cells . 5 x 10 5 cells were used for library preparation . Illumina Nextera XT indices ( Illumina , cat # FC - 131 - 1001 ) ( 3 . 75 µL / sample ) were used for PCR . After 5 PCR cycles , 5 % of each sample was used in qPCR to determine how many more cycles were neces - sary . We found that 4 - 7 cycles were sufficient for final amplification . AMPure XP beads were used to perform a final cleanup ( 0 . 5X followed immediately by 1 . 3X ) and quantified with the Qubit ( ds DNA HS assay ) . The con - centration in molarity of samples was determined by the KAPA Library Quantification Kit ( Kapa Biosystems , cat # 4854 ) . Each replicate was pooled to 4 nM and sequenced separately on an Illumina NextSeq 500 ( 75 - bp paired - end , high output kit ) . CUT & RUN library preparation We generated CUT & RUN libraries following existing pro - tocols 51 , but modified for the use of crosslinked cells . Cells were centrifuged at 500 x g at 4ºC for 10 min . For H3 K27ac , 0 . 5 µL of 1 : 10 diluted antibody ( Abcam , cat # ab4729 ) was added to each sample . For CTCF , 0 . 5µL of 1 : 10 diluted antibody ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # MA5 - 31344 ) was added to each sample . For JUN , 2 . 08 µL of stock antibody ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , cat # MA5 - 15172 ) was added to each sample . For RAD21 , 0 . 625 µL of stock antibody ( Abcam , cat # ab992 ) was added to each sample . We then added 5 µL of KAPA Unique Dual - In - dexed Adapters ( Roche , cat # 08861919702 ) diluted to 750 nM . Libraries from each timepoint for H3 K27ac , CTCF , and JUN were pooled to 6 nM , and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 ( 75 - bp paired - end , high output kit ) . RAD21 libraries from each timepoint were pooled to 9 nM , and were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 ( 75 - bp paired - end , high output kit ) . Hi - C data processing and calling compartments , do - mains , and loops We processed our Hi - C data using a modified version of the Juicer pipeline ( version 1 . 9 . 8 ) 15 . Hi - C contact maps were generated at 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , and 2500 kb resolution for each individual technical replicate that was sequenced . This was for 4 biological replicates , 3 timepoints , and 2 - 3 technical replicates each , totaling 30 unique samples . Additionally , all of the samples for each timepoint were merged to create merged Hi - C maps . All samples and replicates across all timepoints were also merged to create a “Mega” map . Compartments were identified using the EigenVector R package at a 10 kb resolution 25 . TADs were identified using the arrowhead command within the Juicer pipeline at 25 kb resolution . Cell type specific TADs were identified by merging with the mari - ner R package and using the denovo function . Loops were called from the merged timepoint Hi - C files and Mega map with SIP 26 ( version 1 . 6 . 1 ) . The settings “ - g 2 - 5 2000 - fdr 0 . 05” were used both on the timepoint and the Mega map . Loops were merged in R with mariner using the mergeBedpe function , providing a list of 33 , 914 loops . A count matrix was prepared using mariner 52 , where unnormalized counts at each loop pixel from each tech - nical replicate were extracted . The compartment , TAD , and loop - level Hi - C maps were SCALE normalized and visualized with plotgarden - er 53 at 100 , 10 , and 5kb resolutions respectively . Differential loop and aggregate peak analysis DESeq2 was used to identify differential loops using the count matrix prepared as described above . Loops with a median count of 5 counts or less were filtered out . Counts from the technical replicates from each biological repli - cate were summed together and the design “ ~ rep + time” was used , with a reduced design of “ ~ rep” used to form a likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) . Apeglm was used to calculate log - 2 fold changes for each loop , comparing both 6 and 72h to 0h . Loops were deemed significant if they had an adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 and a log - 2 fold change > 1 . 5 . Aggregate peak analysis ( APA ) was performed with mariner . For all , gained , and lost loops , the loop pixel and 10 pixels around the loop were extracted with SCALE normalization at 10 kb resolution . 12 Hi - C Power Analysis Power analysis was performed with the RNAPower pack - age 27 . Dispersion was calculated from the differential loop analysis in DESeq2 as described above , where the minimum dispersion value was used . Power was mod - eled across various theoretical sequencing depths and replicates for identifying a log - 2 fold change of 2 with a p - value of 0 . 05 . The rnapower function was used with an alpha of 0 . 05 / 33914 and a cv of the square root of the dispersion value . We subsampled our Hi - C data from the merged _ nod - ups files to approximate sequencing depths of 100 , 300 , 500 , and 700M per biological replicate . We then repeated our differential loop analysis using the subsampled data for either 2 , 3 , or 4 replicates using all of the same param - eters and loop calls . RNA - seq processing Fastq quality was assessed using the FastQC and Mul - tiQC tools ( FastQC version 0 . 11 . 5 , MultiQC version 1 . 5 ) 54 , 55 . Fastq files were trimmed with Trim Galore ! ( version 0 . 4 . 3 ) and quantified with Salmon ( version 1 . 4 . 0 ) to the hg38 ge - nome 56 , 57 . Alignment was performed using HISAT2 ( ver - sion 2 . 1 . 0 ) , which generated BAM files that were indexed using samtools ( version 1 . 9 ) 58 , 59 . The BAM files for each timepoint’s two biological replicates were merged using samtools and converted to bigwigs using deeptools ( ver - sion 3 . 0 . 1 ) 60 for easy visualization of signal tracks . Reads were summarized into a format compatible with DESeq2 using txImport ( r version 3 . 3 . 1 , tximport version 1 . 2 . 0 ) 29 , 61 . Differential gene analysis DESeq2 was again used to identify differential genes . The txi file was used as input , and the DESeqDataSet - FromTximport was used with “ ~ rep + time” as the design . A reduced design of “ ~ rep” was used to form an LRT , as previously for peak analysis . Shrunken log - 2 fold change values were calculated for each gene by comparing the counts at each time point to 0h with apeglm 62 . Significant genes had an adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 and a log - 2 fold change > 2 . The DESeq2 dataset was normalized with variance stabilized transformation . We then filtered for differen - tial genes and calculated Z - scores based on standard deviation and mean . Replicates were then averaged , and kmeans clustering was used to identify 6 temporal clus - tered based on the vectors of Z - scores . ATAC - seq processing and peak calling Adapters were trimmed and low quality reads were filtered out using Trim Galore ! ( version 0 . 4 . 3 ) 56 . BWA mem ( ver - sion 0 . 7 . 17 ) was used to align reads to the hg38 genome and sorted using Samtools ( version 1 . 9 ) 59 . PicardTools ( version 2 . 10 . 3 ) was used to remove duplicate reads 63 . Mitochondrial reads were filtered out with Samtools idxstats 59 . For each timepoint , biological replicates were merged and indexed with Samtools . We called peaks were called on the merged files using MACS2 with the fol - lowing parameters : - f BAM - q 0 . 01 - g hs - - nomodel - - shift 100 - - extsize 200 - - keep - dup all - B - - SPMR ( version 2 . 1 . 1 . 20160309 ) 64 . A comprehensive peak list was gen - erated by merging peaks across all time points ( 181 , 136 peaks ) . For each peak across all biological replicates independently , counts were extracted with bedtools mul - ticov , which was the input for differential peak analysis 65 . Signal tracks were generated from merged time points with deeptools ( version 3 . 0 . 1 ) for visualization 60 . CUT & RUN processing peak calling Adapters were trimmed off and low quality reads were filtered out with Trim Galore ! ( Version 0 . 4 . 3 ) 56 . BWA mem ( version 0 . 7 . 17 ) was used to align reads to the hg38 genome , sorted with Samtools ( version 1 . 9 ) , and filtered for duplicates with PicardTools ( version 2 . 10 . 3 ) 59 , 63 . Sam - tools was again used to index all BAM files . For each timepoint , biological replicates were merged and indexed with Samtools . We called peaks on the merged files using MACS2 with the following parameters : - f BAM - q 0 . 01 - g hs - - nomodel - - shift 0 - - extsize 200 - - keep - dup all - B - - SPMR ( version 2 . 1 . 1 . 20160309 ) 64 . A comprehensive peak list was generated for each antibody by merging peaks across all time points ( X , Y , Z peaks for X , Y , Z data - sets ) . For each biological replicate independently , counts were extracted with bedtools multicov , which was the input for differential peak analysis 65 . Signal tracks were generated from merged time points with deeptools ( ver - sion 3 . 0 . 1 ) for visualization 60 . Differential ATAC - seq and CUT & RUN Peak Analysis DESeq2 was again used to identify differential peaks from ATAC - seq and all CUT & RUN data . The count matrix generated in the ATAC - seq and CUT & RUN processing was used as the input with the function DESeqDataSet - FromMatrix . We used “ ~ rep + time” as the design and a reduced design of “rep” to form an LRT . Apeglm was used to calculate shrunken log - 2 fold - changes for each peak for each dataset 62 . Significant peaks had an adjusted p - value of < 0 . 05 and an absolute log - 2 fold change > 2 . Peaks were clustered into up early , up mid , up late , down early , down mid , and down late by determining whether their max / min value was at 0 , 6 , or 72h . Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis We used the HOMER function findMotifs . pl on each of our 6 gene clusters to identify enriched gene ontology terms and KEGG pathways with default settings 66 . For GO 13 Terms , the biological _ process . txt file was used and for KEGG pathways , the kegg . txt file was used . Motif Enrichment Analysis We used the HOMER function findMotifsGenome . pl for all motif enrichment 66 . For motifs at the anchors of all loops , we intersected all ATAC peaks with all loop anchors . For motifs at the anchors of gained loops , we intersected all differential gained ATAC peaks with gained loop anchors . For motifs at the anchors of lost loops , we intersected all differential lost ATAC peaks with lost loop anchors . For each motif enrichment , all ATAC peaks were used as the background . The default parameters were used with the following adjustments : - size given . Genomic Intersections The GenomicRanges and InteractionSet R packages were used to perform all genomic intersections 67 . Loop bedpe files were converted into GInteractions objects and were intersected with the coordinates for ATAC , H3 K27ac , JUN , CTCF , RAD21 peaks and genes with subset - ByOverlaps . The unshrunken fold - changes as calculated by DESeq2 analysis were extracted from each of the peaks that overlapped a loop anchor . Chromatin Looping Linear Model The count matrices from previous analysis were again used to generate the data for the linear model . We used loop counts , peak counts from ATAC - seq and all CUT & RUN data , and transcripts per million ( TPM ) per 10 kb bin from RNA - seq . For all loops , each of these counts was extracted from both the anchors and each anchor individually . In the case of multiple peaks intersecting with loops , the sum of all peaks was recorded . We also recorded the maximum values from extracting counts from bigwig files instead . A final anchor measure was calculated by taking the product of signal ( either sum or max ) at both of the anchors for each loop . All interior measures were normalized to the length of the loop . We added a pseudocount of 1000 to the entire data - frame ( which is roughly 0 . 04 times the average count val - ue ) and then calculated the log ( fold - change ) between 72h and 0h . This “delta” matrix was then scaled , and DESeq2 log - 2 fold - changes were used for looping . Our model consisted of all differential loops and twice as many static loops matched for distance and contact . Matched static loops were generated from the matchRanges 68 function within the nullranges Bioconductor package . 75 % of the dataset was used for training and the remaining 25 % was reserved for testing . Each feature was tested against loop LFC with the base R function lm to determine R 2 values . The sign of correlation was determined with the cor function . LASSO regression was used to find a sparse model combining features , calling glmnet 42 within the caret R package 43 . We trained the LASSO model on the training set , using an - chor features only . We evaluated selected LASSO models on the test set using R 2 . This was repeated again for all interior features , and with all anchor and interior features combined . The R 2 was calculated with the cor function . This was repeated for all interior features , and again re - peated with all anchor and interior features combined . Gene Expression Linear Model We used the lm function within the stats R package to model how gene expression changes correlate with changes in changes in proximal and distal acetylation , and looping . We used the GenomicRanges function sub - setByOverlaps and linkOverlaps to determine which dif - ferential genes had promoter H3 K27ac and were looped to a distal H3 K27ac peak 67 , identifying 332 genes , and included 332 static genes matched for expression . We also identified the nearest enhancer with the nearest function of GenomicRanges . For proximal and distal H3 K27ac , we extracted the counts and calculated log2 ( - fold - change ) . For genes that had multiple enhancers , we took the sum of the counts at 0h and 72h and then cal - culated log2 ( fold - change ) . For the ABC score , we scaled all enhancer and loop counts to be between 1 and 100 to ensure that both factors were contributing equally to the interaction despite differences in sequencing depth . For each enhancer - promoter pair , we multiplied the nor - malized distal enhancer counts by the normalized loop strength counts , then calculated log2 ( fold - change ) . For genes with multiple enhancer - promoter pairs , we summed the multiplied score at 0h and 72h and then cal - culated log2 ( fold - change ) . The first model only used changes in promoter acetyl - ation to predict changes in gene expression . The follow - ing three models used promoter acetylation in addition to either nearest enhancer , distal enhancer , or the inter - action between distal enhancers and loops . We trained on 60 % of the data and tested on the remaining 40 % . The predict function was used to predict on the testing data - set from the trained model and cor was used to calculate R 2 values . For R 2 and coefficient estimate calculations , we performed 1000 permutations of splitting the data into testing and training datasets . 14 REFERENCES 1 . Dixon , J . R . et al .
