ABSTRACT Cofilin plays an essential role in regulating actin filament propagation through the cytoplasmic medium . Over the years , various studies have been conducted in an attempt to better understand the complex mechanism by which cofilin promotes filament severing and de - polymerization . Here , we have compiled information obtained from these studies in order to craft a more complete and succinct description of cofilin functionality . In particular , we review the precise structural and mechanical changes associated with cofilin - binding , and the subtle ways in which some of these structural changes may be interconnected .

Lester 1 1 Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University INTRODUCTION Cofilin is a member of the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) pro - tein family and plays a critical role in the propagation of actin - based microfilaments through the cytoplasmic medium ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . Cellular microfilaments are composed of mo - nomeric actin ( G - actin ) that is assembled into long fibers of fila - mentous actin ( F - actin ) . Actin filaments are known to play a crucial role in driving cell motility and other structural changes in a wide variety of cell types , serving multiple functions ( Bravo - Cordero , Magalhaes , Eddy , Hodgson , & Condeelis , 2013 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ) . In neural cells , for example , cofi - lin was shown to be a key regulator of dendrite morphology and , more recently , axon growth and regeneration ( Noguchi et al . , 2016 ; Tedeschi et al . , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . In light of this , it is un - surprising that drastic changes in cofilin activity and F - actin density have been shown to influence the pathogenesis of many nervous system disorders — most notably , Alzheimer’s disease ( Bamburg & Bernstein , 2016 ; Heredia et al . , 2006 ; D . E . Kang & Woo , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Maloney & Bamburg , 2007 ; Minamide , Striegl , Boyle , Meberg , & Bamburg , 2000 ) . Furthermore , cofilin has been shown to play a role in the invasion and metastasis of many forms of cancer — including breast cancer , colorectal cancer , medullary thyroid carcinoma , and lung cancer ( Giardino et al . , 2019 ; Islam , Patel , Bommareddy , Khalid , & Acevedo - Duncan , 2019 ; Kolegova et al . , 2019 ; W . Wang et al . , 2006 ; W . G . Wang , Eddy , & Condeelis , 2007 ) . These examples represent only a small fraction of the disor - ders in which cofilin is thought to play a role . Due to the relevance of actin filament dynamics in such a wide ar - ray of human illnesses , cofilin has been proposed as a possible ther - apeutic target in developing novel pharmaceutical treatments ( Al - hadidi , Bin Sayeed , & Shah , 2016 ) . However , cofilin is also known to play a role in other cellular processes , including phospholipid metabolism , apoptosis cascades , and mechanisms of gene expres - sion ( Bernstein & Bamburg , 2010 ) . Thus , the ubiquitous nature of cofilin and many other ADF proteins in normal cellular processes would pose a significant challenge to using endogenous cofilin as a drug target . It has long been known that ADF / cofilin binds cooperatively to F - actin in the cell , and catalyzes the severing and depolymerization of these actin filaments — thereby increasing the number of barbed ( + ) ends and pointed ( – ) ends where newly - regenerated monomeric actin units can either add or dissociate , respectively ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; Hayden , Miller , Brauweiler , & Bamburg , 1993 ; Michelot et al . , 2007 ; Roland , Berro , Michel - ot , Blanchoin , & Martiel , 2008 ) . This results in a form of “steady - state” in which G - actin monomers are continuously “treadmilled” through the cytoplasm from the pointed ( – ) ends to the barbed ( + ) ends ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . The net result is the stochastic propaga - tion of these actin filaments through the cytoplasm ( Roland et al . , 2008 ) . These propagating filaments are then able to generate pi - conewton forces that promote the formation of lamellipodia for cell movement and other structural changes — such as axon - or den - drite - formation in neural cells ( Bravo - Cordero et al . , 2013 ; Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; Kovar & Pollard , 2004 ; Noguchi et al . , 2016 ; Tedeschi et al . , 2019 ) . Over the past twenty - five years , much focus has been placed on trying to better our understanding of the precise nature of cofilin – F - actin interactions . Characterizing the exact na - ture of cofilin’s severing ability would pave the way for developing new pharmaceutical treatments that could instead use actin fila - ments as a target — perhaps by mimicking the structural impacts of cofilin - binding . Yet , our understanding of the allosteric mechanism by which cofilin severs / depolymerizes actin filaments — and of the underlying conformational changes it induces in F - actin — contin - ues to evolve as new studies emerge and add to the ever - increasing complexity of cofilin functionality . Here , we present an overview of the various physical and structural changes that have been shown to contribute to cofilin’s severing and depolymerizing mechanisms . 1 YURJ | Vol 2 . 1 Spring 2021 Lester | Structural Biology COFILIN – INDUCED MECHANICAL ASYMMETRIES The actin - severing functionality of cofilin relies on its ability to change both the local and global conformation of F - actin upon binding to it ( Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Galkin , Orlova , Lukoyanova , Wriggers , & Egelman , 2001 ; Galkin et al . , 2003 ; Prochniewicz , Janson , Thomas , & De La Cruz , 2005 ) . More specifically , it has been proposed by McCullough et al . ( 2008 ) that the main source of cofilin’s severing power arises from its ability to create two kinds of mechanical asymmetry in the filament : flexural ( bending ) and torsional ( Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; McCullough , Blanchoin , Martiel , & De La Cruz , 2008 ) . Here , we will consider individually these two types of asymmetry in an effort to concisely characterize the changes in filament mechanics that are caused by cofilin - binding . We will also take a closer look at the structural basis for each of these mechanical changes . Cofilin - Binding Changes the Flexural ( Bending ) Rigidity of F - Actin It has previously been shown using both cryogenic electron micros - copy ( Cryo - EM ) ( Orlova & Egelman , 1993 ) and fluorescence mi - croscopy ( McCullough et al . , 2008 ) that cofilin - binding decreases the flexural rigidity and persistence length ( L P ) of actin filaments by a factor of ~ 4 . 4 ( Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ; Orlova & Egelman , 1993 ) . In a qualitative sense , the L P defines the maximum length at which a filament ( or any other ob - ject ) continues to behave like a rigid rod in its environment . Thus , flexural rigidity and persistence length are two distinct measures of bending flexibility . McCullough et al . ( 2008 ) showed that co - filin - bound actin filaments ( also known as “cofilactin” ) appear to bend with higher amplitudes ( to a greater extent ) than bare actin filaments ( see Figure 1 ) . As shown in Figure 1 , the cofilactin segments bend to a much greater extent under the influence of thermal forces than the actin filaments do — indicating that the flexural rigidity of F - actin is significantly decreased when cofilin binds . This increased bending flexibility in cofilactin also corresponds to a greater critical sever - ing angle ( 73 ± 7º ) compared to actin — which has a critical sever - ing angle of 54±4º ( McCullough et al . , 2011 ) . Various studies have determined that the structural source of this greater bending flexibility lies in the broken longitudinal contacts between subsequent actin protomers ( Bobkov et al . , 2002 ; Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; Fan et al . , 2013 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ) . Cofilin binds to F - actin in a groove between subdomains 1 and 3 — thereby disrupting the contacts between the partially - hydropho - bic DNase1 - binding loop ( “D - loop” ; residues 38 - 52 ) in subdomain 2 ( SD2 ) of one actin protomer and the C - terminus “hydrophobic groove” in subdomain 1 ( SD1 ) of the subsequent protomer ( Aihara & Oda , 2013 ; Bobkov et al . , 2006 ; E . M . De La Cruz , 2005 ; En - rique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; Scoville et al . , 2009 ) . More specifical - ly , it shifts the D - Loop in SD2 away from the hydrophobic groove and closer to SD3 ( see later discussion on change in tilt of the actin outer domain ) ( Bobkov et al . , 2002 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ) . Interest - ingly , MD simulations conducted by Fan et al . ( 2013 ) simultane - ously showed an overall net decrease in the SD3 - SD2 longitudinal contacts — increasing the distance between them by ~ 4Å . Although perhaps less influential in altering the stability of actin filaments , cofilin - binding may also shift the SD4 of one protomer farther away from SD3 of the subsequent protomer , thereby dimin - ishing the SD4 – SD3 longitudinal contact ( Fan et al . , 2013 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ) . Overall , cofilin binding decreases the total number of longitudinal contacts from ~ 103 residue pairs to ~ 31 residue pairs , and the strength of each of these contacts is predicted to decrease by ~ 20 - fold ( Fan et al . , 2013 ) . Figure 2 ( adapted from Izoré et al . , 2016 ) shows the structure of a bare F - actin protofilament , with the four subdomains and the D - loop labeled in red and black , respec - tively .

The greater bending flexibility of cofilactin ( red ) is evidenced by the overall increase in amplitude of the fluctuations in the image shown above . Original imag - es obtained using fluorescence microscopy with fluorescently labeled actin . Figure borrowed from McCullough et al . ( 2008 ) . Furthermore , one might also argue that this broken contact between the D - loop and the hydrophobic groove is the most important fac - tor in decreasing the flexural rigidity of the filament because the D - loop makes the highest - radius contact within the filament ( En - rique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ) . Breaking this contact narrows the radial mass distribution of the filament and decreases the effective contact radius from 15 . 26Å in actin to 12 . 68Å in cofilactin , which decreases the overall stiffness of the filament by changing its geometric moment ( Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; Fan et al . , 2013 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ) . Atomis - tic molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations conducted by Fan et al . ( 2013 ) using the structure of rabbit skeletal muscle F - actin further illustrated these decreased inter - protomer contacts in cofilactin , and show how these contacts are more concentrated toward the center of the filament in cofilactin ( see Figure 3 ) . The change in the effective contact radius between SD2 and SD1 — in conjunction with the visual simulation results obtained by Fan , et al . ( 2013 ) — suggest that the primary structural cause of the increased bending flexibility of cofilactin is this broken interaction between the D - loop ( in SD2 ) and hydrophobic cleft ( in SD1 ) ( En - rique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ) . Cofilin - Binding Changes the Torsional ( Twisting ) Rigidity of F - Actin Time - resolved phosphorescence anisotropy experiments on the twisting motions of labeled actin and cofilactin filaments ( see Prochniewicz et al . , 2005 ) demonstrated that cofilin - binding also decreases the torsional rigidity constant of actin filaments by a fac - tor of ~ 20 , which corresponds to a ~ 4 - fold increase in the root - mean - square amplitude of the thermally - driven inter - protomer angular fluctuations ( from 4 . 0º to 16 . 8º , at 25ºC ) ( Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ) . This large increase in angular disorder is also evi - denced by the widening of the torsional angle distribution in Figure 4 ( borrowed from Fan et al . , 2013 ) . The widths of the distributions in Figure 4 are directly proportional to the twisting flexibility of each type of filament . The greater width of the cofilactin ( red ) probability distribution shows that cofilactin 3 YURJ | Vol 2 . 1 Spring 2021 Lester | Structural Biology Figure 3 . Graphics generated from atomistic MD simulations showing physical locations of longitudinal contacts in F - actin ( left ) and cofilactin ( right ) , and the radial distributions of these contacts . The visual loss of the outer “contact ring” ( turquoise ) in going from actin to cofilactin corresponds to the decreased contact between SD2 ( the D - loop ) and SD1 ( the hydrophobic groove ) of the subsequent protomer . The change in intensity of the inner contact ring ( denoted by the change in color from red to turquoise ) corresponds to a potential decrease in SD4 – SD3 contacts .

( 2013 ) . segments are much more compliant to thermal - induced twisting than bare actin filaments . For several years , there was some disagreement in the field over the relative importance of lateral inter - subunit interactions in deter - mining the torsional rigidity of F - actin ( Bobkov et al . , 2006 ; Fan et al . , 2013 ; McGough & Chiu , 1999 ) . However , the MD simulations conducted by Fan et al . ( 2013 ) ultimately determined that the bro - ken longitudinal interactions are the dominant factor in decreasing both the torsional and flexural rigidity of F - actin . In addition , mechanical simulations conducted by De La Cruz et al . ( 2010 ) and De La Cruz et al . ( 2015 ) have shown that these fil - ament bending and twisting motions are actually coupled to one another and that this twist - bend coupling plays a substantial role in the severing ability of cofilin by amplifying the stress localized at actin - cofilactin boundaries ( E . M . De la Cruz , Martiel , & Blan - choin , 2015 ; E . M . De La Cruz , Roland , McCullough , Blanchoin , & Martiel , 2010 ) . These simulations also showed that up to 60 % of the filament subunit elastic free energy is due to this twist - bend coupling phenomenon — which itself appears to be a direct result of the intrinsic double - protofilament helical structure of F - actin ( E . M . De La Cruz et al . , 2010 ) . Actin - Severing Occurs Preferentially at Actin – Cofilactin Bound - aries Due to Mechanical Heterogeneity Further studies by Enrique M . De La Cruz ( 2009 ) have also shown that severing efficiency scales with the total number of actin - co - filactin boundaries on a filament . This suggests that thermally - in - duced fracture events are most likely to occur at the boundaries between regions of bare actin and cofilin - decorated actin , rather than within homogenous ( i . e . bare or saturated ) regions of the fila - ment ( Bobkov et al . , 2006 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ; Prochniewicz et al . , 2005 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ) . This is due to the stark change in mechanical properties and dynamics of the filaments at these junctions ( E . M . De La Cruz , 2005 ; Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ; Prochniewicz et al . , 2005 ) . This mechani - cal asymmetry results in elastic stress - localization at a point imme - diately adjacent to the actin - cofilactin boundaries as the filaments undergo thermal twisting and bending motions ( Anderson , 2005 ; E . M . De la Cruz et al . , 2015 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ) . The imag - es in Figure 5 ( borrowed from Suarez et al . , 2011 ) were obtained using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) , and provide visual evidence for this preferential severing at boundaries between actin ( red ) and cofilactin ( green / yellow ) regions . Moreover , it has been shown that the effect of cofilin binding is cumulative , and as more cofilin molecules bind successive actin protomers , the filament stress localized at the ( + ) ends of these co - filin clusters increases dramatically ( Bobkov et al . , 2006 ; Pavlov , Muhlrad , Cooper , Wear , & Reisler , 2007 ) . However , as the number of bound cofilin molecules increases , the number of actin - cofilactin boundaries on a filament of finite length must necessarily reach a maximum , before beginning to decrease as the filament becomes more and more saturated with cofilin . This would , in theory , result in a severing efficiency that increases initially with cofilin bind - ing density before reaching a theoretical maximum efficiency at half - saturation , and then decreasing again as the filament becomes YURJ | Vol 2 . 1 Spring 2021 4 Lester | Structural Biology Figure 5 . TIRF microscopy images providing direct evidence of preferen - tial severing at boundaries between bare ( red ) and cofilin - bound ( green / yellow ) F - actin regions . In these experiments , a fluorescently labeled form of cofilin was genetically engineered in order to distinguish between actin and cofilactin regions . The blue arrow denotes the pointed ( – ) end of the actin filament , and the white arrow denotes the barbed ( + ) end of the fila - ment . The orange arrow denotes the severing site , which is clearly shown to occur at the boundary between homogeneous actin ( red ) and cofilactin ( green / yellow ) regions of the filament . The second image shows the two separated filaments post - severing , approximately fifteen seconds later . Im - age borrowed from Suarez et al . ( 2011 ) . Figure 6 . Experimental relationship between cofilin severing efficiency ( given as a fraction of total sites on the filament ) and the binding density of cofilin . The solid magenta line shows the average number of actin - cofilac - tin boundary sites ( also expressed as a fraction of total sites ) as a function of cofilin binding density , which was calculated using equilibrium binding constants from the nearest neighbor cooperative interaction model pre - sented by Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2005 and Cao et al . , 2006 . Two different measures of cofilin severing efficiency are used : the filled circles show the net subunit dissociation from pointed filament ends ( measured by Bobkov et al . , 2006 using differential scanning calorimetry ) ; the filled squares show the change in phase transition temperature ( T m ) for a population of filaments when cofilin binds ( reported by Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) . The strong cor - relation between the two measures of severing efficiency and the fraction of sites where an actin - cofilatin boundary exists demonstrates preferential severing at actin - cofilactin boundaries and supports the notion of a theo - retical maximum severing efficiency when a filament is half - saturated with cofilin . Figure borrowed from Enrique M . De La Cruz ( 2009 ) . saturated with cofilin ( Andrianantoandro & Pollard , 2006 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ) . These predictions are supported by studies conducted by Yeoh et al . ( 2002 ) and Bobkov et al . ( 2006 ) , which are summa - rized in Figure 6 ( borrowed from Enrique M . De La Cruz , 2009 ) . The strong correlation shown in Figure 6 between the two measures of severing efficiency and the total number of boundary sites — along with the TIRF microscopy images presented by Suarez et al . ( 2011 ) in Figure 5 — provide strong evidence of preferential severing at actin - cofilactin boundaries rather than within homoge - nous regions due to drastic changes in filament flexibility and the localization of elastic stress at those junctions . In addition , these results support the hypothesis of a theoretical maximum severing efficiency when the filament is half - saturated with cofilin . Mechanical and thermodynamic simulations conducted by E . M . De La Cruz et al . ( 2015 ) also support the claim that filaments pref - erentially sever at these boundaries . In particular , they showed that when adjacent F - actin and cofilactin regions of equal length are subjected to compressive forces , the asymmetry in the deforma - tions of the two regions results in localization of elastic energy and a sharp increase in the total energy gradient directly adjacent to the boundary , but within the more flexible cofilactin region ( see Figure 7 ) ( E . M . De la Cruz et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , the unsymmetrical deformation of the filament that is half - actin and half - cofilactin in Figure 7 provides visual evidence of this mechanical heterogeneity ( i . e . differences in flexural rigidity between the two regions ) . Although compressive buckling forces are less relevant when discussing severing promoted by stochastic thermal motions , these simulations nonetheless provide a very good description of how / where elastic energy is localized in and around the actin - cofilactin boundaries ( E . M . De la Cruz et al . , 2015 ) . COFILIN - INDUCED CHANGES IN THE LOCAL F - ACTIN STRUCTURE As we previously discussed , when cofilin binds to an actin filament , longitudinal inter - subunit contacts are broken , which compromises the torsional and flexural rigidity of the filament . For many years , it has been known that F - actin undergoes at least two key macromo - lecular structural changes when cofilin binds : the tilt angle of the “outer domain” ( composed of SD1 and SD2 ) changes ( see Galkin et al . , 2001 ) , and the twist angle between adjacent protomers changes ( see McGough et al . , 1997 ) . However , it remained unclear which structural changes were responsible for the broken longitudinal contact ( s ) . Here , we present an answer to this long - held question , based on a compilation of data from previous studies conducted by others . Cofilin Disrupts SD2 – SD1 ( and Perhaps SD4 – SD3 ) Longitudi - nal Contacts by Increasing the Local Helicity When cofilin binds to an actin filament , it alters the local twist angle of the filament — a change which has been shown to only propagates 1 - 2 subunits into the bare actin region ( Huehn et al . , 2018 ; McGough , Pope , Chiu , & Weeds , 1997 ) . When discussing the structure of F - actin , it is also important to note that it can be treated as either a right - handed , two - start , long - pitch double helix or as a left - handed , one - start , short - pitch single helix ( see Figure 8 ) ( Jegou & Romet - Lemonne , 2020 ) . The long - pitch torsion angle between one protomer and the longi - tudinally adjacent protomer ( i . e . the horizontal angle between the small black dots in Figure 8 ) was shown to be approximately + 27º in bare actin ( measured by Galkin et al . , 2011 using Cryo - EM ) . This is coupled to a short - pitch torsion angle equal to – 166 . 6º going 5 YURJ | Vol 2 . 1 Spring 2021 Lester | Structural Biology Figure 7 . Results from molecular simulations for three different patterns of cofilin - decoration on F - actin . ( Filament length = 1µm ; red = actin , green = co - filactin ) The top row of graphs depicts the shape of deformation that each type of actin filament would undergo when it is compressed by 1 % , 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % of its total length ( black , red , purple , and blue curves , respectively ) . The graphs of stored elastic energy ( middle row ) demonstrate how cofilactin regions have higher levels of stored elastic energy at each compression level , which corresponds to a greater degree of flexibility . The graphs depicting elastic energy gradients at various points along the filament show how energy gradients reach a maximum at points within cofilactin regions that are immediately adjacent to ( border ) regions of bare actin ( i . e . at actin - cofilactin boundaries ) . The white space behind the cofilactin regions is also shaded in the bottom two rows of graphs to aid in visual interpretation . Figure borrowed from De La Cruz et al . ( 2015 ) . ( A similar diagram can also be found in Schramm et al . , 2017 . ) from one protomer to the next one above it in the single - helix ( de - termined by Huehn et al . , 2018 , from a structure solved by Oda et al . , 2009 using X - ray fiber diffraction ) . On the other hand , cofilac - tin filaments were shown to have a long - pitch torsion angle equal to + 35 . 8º ( measured by Tanaka et al . , 2018 using Cryo - EM ) , and a short - pitch torsion angle equal to – 162 . 1º ( determined by Schramm et al . , 2017 , from a structure solved by Galkin et al . , 2015 using cryo - EM ) . Thus , when cofilin binds to F - actin , it induces a local - ized increase in the helicity of the filament — including a ~ 9 . 5º increase in the long - pitch torsion angle and a ~ 4 . 5º decrease in the absolute value of the short - pitch angle ( Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Jegou & Romet - Lemonne , 2020 ) . It might also be noted that these exper - imentally determined values for the short - pitch torsion angles of actin and cofilactin are comparable to the values determined from MD simulations ( – 165 . 8 ( ±2 . 2 ) º and – 163 . 7 ( ±2 . 9 ) º , respectively ) by Fan et al . ( 2013 ) . Data from previous studies suggest that this local change in helicity causes the one ( potentially two ) broken inter - protomer contact ( s ) that increase filament flexibility . MD filament models created by Schramm et al . ( 2019 ) have shown that the ~ 4 . 5º difference in the short - pitch filament is to blame for the disrupted SD2 – SD1 con - tact between the D - loop and the hydrophobic cleft . Interestingly , this opposes previous studies conducted by Galkin et al . ( 2003 ) , which suggested that the twist did not have a direct effect on these SD2 - SD1 contacts . To the best of our knowledge , it remains un - clear whether or not the increase in helicity directly causes the observed net decrease in SD3 - SD2 longitudinal contacts . Perhaps future simulation studies on actin filaments with constrained ends to selectively amplify the change - in - twist effect of cofilin ( similar to the studies conducted by Wioland et al . , 2019 ) might reveal the answer to this uncertainty . A low - resolution Cryo - EM structure obtained by Galkin et al . ( 2001 ) previously suggested that the other longitudinal contact between SD4 and SD3 is also disrupted by this increase in heli - city . However , subsequent higher - resolution Cryo - EM structures determined by Galkin et al . ( 2011 ) and Tanaka et al . ( 2018 ) did not support this claim . The supposed broken contact between SD4 and SD3 was only observed in simulations conducted by Fan et al . ( 2013 ) , and not in previously determined Cryo - EM structures — suggesting that perhaps these broken SD4 – SD3 contacts are only transient in nature ( Fan et al . , 2013 ; Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Tanaka et al . , 2018 ) . Carefully executed point - mutation studies may be re - quired to determine the relative importance of these SD4 - SD3 con - tacts in relation to the severing functionality of cofilin . In short , the increased helicity ( and the increased variability in the twist angle ) in cofilactin regions disrupts longitudinal SD2 – SD1 and SD3 – SD2 contacts ( and potentially some SD4 – SD3 contacts ) between adja - cent protomers in F - actin , and is likely one of the main contributors to cofilin’s severing ability . At this point , it is also important that we distinguish between fil - ament “fragmentation” and filament “de - polymerization” ( Pope , Gonsior , Yeoh , McGough , & Weeds , 2000 ) . Fragmentation refers to the process of breaking off F - actin oligomers from the pointed end of a propagating microfilament , whereas de - polymerization re - fers to the complete de - polymerization of F - actin back into G - ac - tin monomers — so that they can be “treadmilled” back up to the barbed end of the propagating filament to then re - polymerize . Pope et al . ( 2000 ) showed that changes in the filament twist alone were insufficient to de - polymerize F - actin ( measured by the turnover rate of actin monomers ) , but did dramatically increased the rate of fragmentation of short oligomers from the pointed end of the filament . In fact , more recent studies conducted by Schramm et al . ( 2017 ) and Wioland et al . ( 2019 ) have shown that mechanically increasing the helicity of filaments by constraining their ends re - sults in a ~ 100 - fold acceleration of the fragmentation rate . These observations all suggest that the mechanism of monomeric actin turnover consists of two parallel mechanisms that go hand - in - hand ; the increased twist of F - actin results in the fragmentation of the fil - ament into short oligomers near the pointed end ( which we can see visually in Figure 5 ) , and de - polymerization is due to some other structural change — perhaps , as we will soon see , a change in the conformation of the nucleotide - binding pocket caused by a change YURJ | Vol 2 . 1 Spring 2021 6 Lester | Structural Biology Figure 8 .

Cofilin - Binding Disrupts the SD2 – SD1 Longitudinal Contacts by Changing the Internal Tilt Angle Between the Inner and Outer Domain Within Each Protomer When cofilin binds to F - actin , it also induces a change in the inter - nal structure of each actin monomer and the tilt angle between the “outer domain” of actin protomers ( consisting of subdomains 1 and 2 ) and the “inner domain” ( consisting of subdomains 3 and 4 ) ( see Figure 9 ) ( Fan et al . , 2013 ; Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ) . As depicted in Figure 9 , the dihedral “tilt” angle R2 – R1 – R3 – R4 increases from 10 . 27º ( ±3 . 41º ) in bare actin to 25 . 73º ( ±3 . 71º ) in cofilin - decorated actin ( Fan et al . , 2013 ) . This ~ 15º change in the tilt of the outer domain relative to the inner domain ( red arrow , Fig - ure 9 ) results in the reorganization of longitudinal inter - subdomain contacts . In particular , contacts between SD2 ( the D - loop ) and SD1 ( the hydrophobic groove ) on the adjacent protomer are bro - ken , and the SD2 is shifted closer to SD3 on the adjacent protomer ( Galkin et al . , 2001 ; Galkin , VanLoock , Orlova , & Egelman , 2002 ) . This is one of the very same structural changes responsible for the decreased rigidity of F - actin when cofilin binds ( see previous dis - cussion on the importance of mechanical heterogeneity ) . We can then draw the conclusion that this “tilting” of the outer domain is another important macromolecular structural change that causes the decreased rigidity seen in cofilactin filaments . In vertebrate cofilin , it has also been shown that another important consequence of this change in the outer domain tilt angle is that it disrupts the binding pocket for an important Mg 2 + stabilizing cation within the F - actin structure ( H . R . Kang et al . , 2014 ) . The presence or absence of this Mg 2 + cation has been shown to play a crucial role in modulating the bending and twisting mechanical properties of actin filaments ( Hocky et al . , 2016 ; H . R . Kang et al . , 2014 ) . The Mg 2 + binding site is found at the SD2 – SD2 interface , cradled mostly by polar / charged residues located at the base of the D - loop in SD2 ( Q49 , K50 , D51 , E57 ) and the inner rim of the hydrophobic cleft ( E167 ) ( see Figure 10 ) ( Hocky et al . , 2016 ) . This divalent cation serves as an “electrostatic linker” — adhering the SD2 of one protomer to the SD1 of the adjacent protomer in such a way that allows the hydrophobic residues in the D - loop ( res - idues 52 – 56 ) to fit snugly into the hydrophobic cleft of SD1 ( Hocky et al . , 2016 ) . However , the Mg 2 + binding pocket overlaps with the cofilin binding site such that when cofilin binds , the change in tilt of the outer domain also alters the geometry of the pocket and expels the Mg 2 + ion — destabilizing the filament and promoting sever - ing ( H . Kang , Bradley , Elam , & De La Cruz , 2013 ; H . R . Kang et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we now have a clearer understanding of why this change in tilt promotes filament severing . An interesting observation was that in the yeast homolog of actin , which lacks this Mg 2 + binding pocket , the vertebrate cofilin is un - able to sever the filaments ( H . R . Kang et al . , 2014 ) . Yet , in A167E mutant yeast , where the binding pocket has been “restored , ” cofilin regains its severing capabilities ( H . R . Kang et al . , 2014 ) . This sug - gests that this Mg 2 + - displacement — and the broken electrostatic interactions associated with it — contributes a significant portion of the fragmentation free energy . Future point - mutation studies may be able to determine the exact contributions of the hydrophobic 7 YURJ | Vol 2 . 1 Spring 2021 Lester | Structural Biology Figure 9 .

( 2016 ) . interactions and the electrostatic interactions to the overall thermo - dynamic stability of the SD2 – SD1 contact . It would also be inter - esting to compare the free energy of cofilin binding in vertebrates and yeast , to see if the difference ( if there is one ) between them is numerically equal to the calculated free energy contribution of the residue – Mg 2 + electrostatic attractions . Inter - Subunit Tilt Modulates the Conformation of the Nucleo - tide - Binding Pocket in F - Actin Even without decoration by cofilin , it has previously been shown that actin’s intrinsic ATPase activity results in the breaking of the same SD2 – SD1 longitudinal contacts when the nucleotide binding cleft opens to release the cleaved inorganic phosphate ion ( P i ) ( Bel - mont , Orlova , Drubin , & Egelman , 1999 ; Galkin et al . , 2003 ; Or - lova & Egelman , 1992 ; Sablin et al . , 2002 ) . For that reason , Galkin et al . ( 2003 ) and Orlova et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that the tilt angle of the outer domain also regulates the conformation of the nucle - otide binding pocket , and when cofilin increases this tilt angle , it effectively reverts the actin protomers back to a conformational state that favors de - polymerization . In fact , this tilt angle can be used as a measure of how widely the nucleotide binding pocket is opened — and thus a measure of P i release ( Fan et al . , 2013 ) . This conclusion is supported by further studies conducted by Suarez et al . ( 2011 ) , which demonstrated that cofilin - binding accelerated P i release from the nucleotide pocket . In this way , similar to the du - al - effect of helicity changes in promoting filament fragmentation , the change in tilt between the outer domain and the inner domain within each cofilactin protomer has a two - fold effect in destabiliz - ing actin filaments . We can now mentally separate the two distinct structural shifts that give rise to the two parallel processes contributing to the breaking down of microfilaments . The change in twist induced by cofilin is responsible for the increased rate of fragmentation seen at ac - tin - cofilactin boundaries near the pointed ( – ) end of propagating fil - aments , and the change in tilt between the outer and inner domains within each actin protomer indirectly causes the increased rate of actin de - polymerization at the pointed end . CONCLUSION Here , we have succinctly summarized the many facets of cofilin’s filament - severing and filament - depolymerizing mechanism — in - cluding extensive discussions on the two form of mechanical / dynamic asymmetry induced in F - actin by cofilin , the macromo - lecular changes in local structure that occur within these cofilactin regions , and the specific inter - domain longitudinal contacts that are disrupted by these changes . Moreover , we have characterized the ways in which some of these structural and mechanical changes are actually intertwined in an effort to arrive at a more complete un - derstanding of how cofilin controls F - actin stability and dynamics .
