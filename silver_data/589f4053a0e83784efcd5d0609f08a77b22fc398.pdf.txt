I would like to thank my supervisor , Bill Earnshaw , for giving me the opportunity of working in your lab , and for the encouragement you gave me . I learnt so much and had the opportunity to attend really good conferences and courses and this was because of your support . I am not going to thank you for the Monday meetings at 9 : 30 am though . I would like to say ‘thank you’ to all the Earnshaw Lab members , present and past , starting with : Dan , Diana ( Papi ) , Oscar ( ma non ci credo ! ! ! ) and Mar ( loca ! ) you are colleagues and ( will be ! ) friends and this PhD would not have been such a good experience without you guys ! ! Also Laura , Alisa , Melpi , Nuno , Jan , Helena , Paola , Florence , Kumiko , Hiromi , Emma… . I most luckily came to you , at some point , asking really absurd questions or having terrible doubts about things…well ‘thank you’ for sharing your knowledge / time with me . You all certainly contributed with your inputs to the nice science contained in this thesis . Thank you , thank you , thank you to all the thesis readers : Dan , Oscar , Alisa e Alba . I cannot tell how much you helped me and how grateful I am for this ! ! ! Thank you Alisa for always having delicious food and for being willing to share it with me ! Maybe not much of choice as your desk is adjacent to mine , and maybe you were just being very polite but anyway it is nice ! Vorrei esprimere un enorme GRAZIE alla mia famiglia ! ! ! Grazie mamma e papà per avermi sempre supportata ed incoraggiata a perseguire tutti i traguardi che iii mi ero prefissata ! So che la lontananza è stata dura ma speriamo che il futuro riservi delle nuove possibilità più vicino a casa . Grazie agli amici di sempre : Simona , Arianna , Simone , Valentino , Riccardo , Marina , Valeria , Luca , Francesco , Massi e Ramona . Tornare a casa e trovarvi , fa parte del tornare a casa , rappresentate ormai una’estensione della parola famiglia . Adesso con i piccoletti è ancora più bello tornare ! Anche a Daniele , a cui piace viaggiare in tutto il mondo ma non è mai venuto in Scozia in quasi 5 anni ! ! ! Thank you to the ‘italian’ crew in Edinburgh , which now is actually almost exstinguished . Dianina e Manuela I don’t even know how many time I had dinner in your place ! Thank you for taking care of me when I felt lonely ! Adriana for being such a good person / friend despite the distance these days ! The last ‘thank you’ but not the least , goes to the dearest person is now in my life . I certainly was not expecting my life to change so much during my PhD and even so I met you and now I can’t even remember how it was before ! Thank you for being the best friend , the best partner , best chef in the house , a super - good scientist , and the most patient person on the planet . The support you gave me is beyond my ability to describe things… Daniel , I love you . I wish we will always be happy together as we are now . iv Lay Summary Cells are the core components of all living organisms . To allow growth and development , cells must divide and pass on their genetic information ( DNA ) to daughter cells . For this to be achieved the entire genome is duplicated and packaged into compact units known as chromosomes . During cell division , the chromosomes become attached to string - like protein complexes , the microtubules of the spindle . Microtubules are capable of exerting minute forces with the aim of pulling the duplicated chromosomes into opposite directions . Unfortunately it is not possible for microtubules to interact with chromosomes directly , but instead , they attach to a structure on the front of chromosomes known as the kinetochore . In this regard , the kinetochore acts much like the handle of a handbag . Unlike one handle of a handbag however , the kinetochore is composed of more than 100 different parts ( proteins ) in all , and it has an essential role during cell division . As an example , if microtubule attachment to chromosomes is too weak , or indeed too strong , this can lead to abnormal cell division , a condition often associated with cancer . The kinetochore therefore acts as a regulator for the proper attachment of microtubules to chromosomes . How all of these kinetochore proteins work to perform this complex function is still poorly understood , therefore the focus of my PhD was to study a selection of the components that make - up the kinetochore , to better understand how these proteins both individually and collectively function to achieve a solid attachment site for microtubules . A key aim of this research was to study the region of the kinetochore that engages with the underlying DNA . Very little is known about the ultra - structure of this particular compartment and how , if it all , its architecture confers functional relevance . To achieve my aims I used an elegant microscopy technique that allowed the DNA associated with the kinetochore to be unfolded , and accurately measured , both with and without the presence of some of the key kinetochore components . v Using this method of microscopy , combined with complex statistical analyses , I acquired data that has allowed a more detailed ultra - structural model of the kinetochore to be proposed . vi Abstract The kinetochore is a highly complex proteinaceous structure located at the primary constriction of mitotic chromosomes . Here , it performs an essential role in accurate chromosome segregation . Recently , much interest has been directed towards the Constitutive Centromere Associated Network ( CCAN ) components , as they participate in the formation of a scaffold involved in kinetochore assembly . It is therefore important to fully understand their role , and their distribution , at the kinetochore . Although many kinetochore proteins have already been identified , it is still unclear how centromeric chromatin folds to form the structure of the inner kinetochore . This is an interesting yet still open field of study , where the literature reports are still quite divided . In this study we take advantage of the high homologous recombination efficiency in DT40 B - lymphoma chicken cell lines , allowing the generation of conditional knockouts and deletion cell lines of several centromere proteins , subsequently engineered to stably express GFP : CENP - A . In the parental cell line the unfolding properties of the centromeric region were investigated by using TEEN buffer . Using fluorescence microscopy we were able to measure the length of many unfolded centromeric chromatin fibres , from both interphase and mitotic samples , based on the signal of GFP : CENP - A . A multi - peak analysis revealed the presence of discrete populations of fibres , recognised as peaks , in both interphase and mitotic samples . Compared with interphase , mitotic centromeres showed a greater level of compaction . Next , mutants for CCAN components , blocked in mitosis , were subjected to centromere chromatin unfolding . Results revealed that mitotic kinetochores depleted of CENP - C and CENP - S behaved similarly to the parental interphase samples , suggesting a role of those proteins in maintaining kinetochore structure . In contrast , CENP - O , CENP - H and CENP - I depletion did not seem to weaken the structure of the kinetochore . Additionally , we tested a hypothesis revealed by the multi - peak analyses , that chromatin layers exist in the inner kinetochore . Our data , when combined with published electron microscopy and crystallography measurements of centromere / kinetochore components , allowed us to assemble a robust and mathematically viable model that supports a vii boustrophedon organisation of the kinetochore chromatin . Finally , characterization studies of the novel kinetochore protein CENP - Z were performed . An involvement of CENP - Z in controlling the levels of di - methylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 was shown . This work represents an advance in our understanding of kinetochore structure in vertebrates . viii Table of Contents !

These events , in almost all eukaryotes , are divided into distinct phases : Gap - phase 1 ( G1 ) , synthesis ( S ) , Gap - phase 2 ( G2 ) and Mitosis ( M ) . G1 , S and G2 phases constitute the interphase ( Norbury and Nurse , 1992 ) , which is the longest portion of the cell cycle , where a cell increases in size ( G1 ) , generates a copy of its own DNA ( S ) and duplicates cell organelles ( G2 ) . Interphase is followed by mitosis . During mitosis duplicated DNA becomes organised into chromosomes that will be then equally segregated into two daughter cells . Cells can also enter into Gap - phase 0 ( G0 ) when they stop proliferating . Typically , only senescent or differentiated cells enter G0 . Senescent cells are not able to re - enter the cell cycle , whereas differentiated cells could start to proliferate again in response to the appropriate physiological signalling ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . For the cell cycle to be executed successfully , each phase of the cell cycle has to be completed before the next one can begin . There are control checkpoints present in both interphase and mitosis ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Cells delay cell cycle progression until the checkpoint conditions are satisfied . During interphase , a checkpoint for DNA damage and a checkpoint for unduplicated DNA are responsible for impairing cells carrying errors in their genome , from continuing cell division , until these errors are corrected ( Painter and Young , 1980 ; Weinert and Hartwell , 1988 ) . During mitosis , the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) ensures that all the chromosomes are properly attached to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle before entering anaphase , the mitotic phase in which chromosomes segregation into two daughter cells is initiated ( Rieder et al . , 1995 ; Sluder , 1979 ; Sluder and Begg , 1983 ) . Importantly , the cell cycle can only proceed in one direction . This is achieved by a tight regulation . Cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) are serine / threonine dual specificity kinases and some of them are key regulators of cell cycle progression Chapter 1 : Introduction 19 ( Baldin et al . , 1993 ; Nakayama et al . , 2001 ; Pines , 1999 ) . CDKs are enzymatically active only when they are associated with their regulatory subunits , cyclins . This allows the phosphorylation of a subset of substrates and pushes the cell cycle forward ( Evans et al . , 1983 ; Hadwiger et al . , 1989 ; Lohka et al . , 1988 ; Nash et al . , 1988 ) . A caveat for CDK activity is constituted by the levels of cyclins in the cells that are tightly regulated by ubiquitin mediated proteolysis , as CDKs are , in contrast , constitutively expressed ( Glotzer et al . , 1991 ; Hershko et al . , 1991 ) . Therefore , different cyclins regulate distinct stages of the cell cycle : cyclin D is present in G1 ; cyclin E in S phase ; cyclin A in S , G2 and M phases and cyclin B in M phase . Figure 1 . 1 . Cell cycle in eukaryotic cells . A diagram representing the phases of the cell cycle , highlighted by different colours . The uni - directionality of the cell cycle is indicated by the arrows and the length of each phase in commonly used human , tissue - cultured , cells is specified . Checkpoints for monitoring and regulating cell cycle progression are shown . Chapter 1 : Introduction 20 1 . 2 Stages of mitosis Mitosis is the shortest phase of the cell cycle , only one hour in most human cells , and indeed finely regulated to allow the generation of two genetically identical daughter cells . Mitosis is composed of five stages : prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase and telophase / cytokinesis ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . 1 . 2 . 1 Prophase In prophase , the nuclear envelope and nucleoli start to disassemble and chromatin condensation begins . At this point , duplicated DNA is organised into X - shaped chromosomes ( Koshland and Strunnikov , 1996 ) due to the activity of the Condensin II complex ( Hirano , 2005 ) . Each chromosome is composed of a pair of sister chromatids , one chromatid per daughter cell ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . Sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex ( Nasmyth et al . , 2000 ) present along chromosome arms and at the primary constriction . Previously duplicated centrosomes migrate to the opposite sides of the nucleus and increase their microtubule nucleation activity , re - organizing the cytoskeleton into radial arrays of short tubulin filaments ( asters ) ( Ault and Rieder , 1994 ) . 1 . 2 . 2 Prometaphase Prometaphase starts with nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) . Chromosomes are now in contact with cytosolic environment where the Condensin I complex is present . The interaction between the two condensin complexes completes chromosome condensation ( Hirano , 2005 ) . Dynamic spindle microtubules emanate from the centrosomes and start capturing chromosomes . The attachment of microtubules to chromosomes occurs at a specialized structure called the kinetochore ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ; Maiato et al . , 2004 ) . Usually , one sister chromatid is captured while the other is still unattached , a configuration known as mono - orientation . At this stage , microtubules are highly unstable , undergoing cycles of polymerization and depolymerization and syntelic attachments ( both sister chromatids are attached by microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole ) or Chapter 1 : Introduction 21 merotelic attachments ( one sister chromatid is attached to microtubules coming from opposite poles ) can occur and need to be corrected to proceed to the next stage of mitosis ( Cimini and Degrassi , 2005 ; Tanaka , 2013 ) . Microtubules stabilise when the plus end engages with the kinetochore , forming end - on attachments . At the same time , interpolar microtubules extending from opposite poles interact with each other in an anti - parallel fashion to promote the formation of a bipolar spindle ( Mastronarde et al . , 1993 ) . When all the chromosomes are bi - oriented ( sister kinetochores are attached by microtubules coming from opposed spindle poles ) , the balance of tension on both sides of the mitotic spindle causes the chromosomes to align on a plate , equidistant from spindle poles ; this is called metaphase plate ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . 1 . 2 . 3 Metaphase At this point , all chromosomes are bi - oriented and aligned on the metaphase plate . This satisfies the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) that regulates the transition between metaphase and anaphase onset ( Rieder and Khodjakov , 1997 ) . When checkpoint signalling stops , cell division cycle protein 20 ( Cdc20 ) activates the anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) , an E3 ubiquitin ligase , allowing it to mark for degradation its targets , securin and the cyclins ( Peters , 2002 ) . Securin is a protein that normally binds the protease separase , keeping the enzyme inactive . When the proteasome degrades securin , separase passes to its active state and cleaves cohesin , allowing sister chromatid segregation to occur ( Nasmyth et al . , 2000 ) . 1 . 2 . 4 Anaphase Pulling forces generated by the depolymerization of microtubules facilitate chromatid migration towards the spindle poles ( Figure 1 . 2 ) ( Scholey et al . , 2003 ) . Interpolar microtubule interactions contribute to an elongation of the mitotic spindle to further separate chromosomes in preparation of telophase and nuclear envelope reformation . When the chromatid clusters are sufficiently separate , the spindle midzone forms , which consists of arrays of anti - parallel microtubules . The position of the midzone determines the position of the future cleavage plane , the portion of Chapter 1 : Introduction 22 the cell where the division of the cytoplasm of the two daughter cells will start ( Field et al . , 1999 ) . 1 . 2 . 5 Telophase / Cytokinesis Key events in telophase are the reformation of the nuclear envelope and the onset of DNA decondensation . More anti - parallel microtubules concentrate at the midzone and a cortical furrow starts to ingress . During cytokinesis , the progressive ingression of the furrow is mediated by actin that forms the contractile ring ( Salmon , 1989 ) . In its final stages , only a bridge of membranes , containing microtubules , is left between the two daughter cells , this is called the midbody ( Salmon and Wolniak , 1990 ) ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . Final abscission ( Carlton et al . , 2012 ) and creation of two identical daughter cells is hence achieved . Chapter 1 : Introduction 23 Figure 1 . 2 . Diagram representing the stages of mitosis . Changes in cell morphology are represented as follows : DNA compaction ( light blue – decondensed ; dark blue – compact ) ; microtubules ( green ) and centrosomes ( red ) . A dashed line around nuclei represents nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) and nuclear envelope reassembly . Orange dots on both sides of chromosomes indicate kinetochores . Chapter 1 : Introduction 24 1 . 3 The kinetochore Faithful mitosis could not be achieved , in eukaryotes , without a functional kinetochore . The kinetochore is a multi - subunit protein complex positioned on the external surface of chromosomes at the primary constriction site , with the exception of holocentric chromosomes . Approximately 100 different proteins compose the kinetochore , which work in cohort to finely coordinate essential functions ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ) , such as ( i ) supplying an anchor point for microtubule binding , ( ii ) correcting erroneous KT - MT attachments and ( iii ) monitoring that chromatid segregation occurs only when bi - orientation in achieved . Since a large part of this Ph . D . research is dedicated to better understanding the role of kinetochore components in the maintenance of kinetochore structural integrity , this will now be discussed in greater detail . 1 . 3 . 1 Kinetochore ultrastructure The kinetochore was first observed by electron microscopy during the late sixties ( Brinkley and Stubblefield , 1966 ) . Later it was shown to be a plate - like structure found on chromosomes only during mitosis ( Brenner et al . , 1981 ) . The kinetochore plate , in vertebrates , was visualised as a trilaminar structure composed of two electron dense regions , separated by an electron translucent area ( Figure 1 . 3 A ) ( Maiato et al . , 2006 ) . In these studies , the inner plate includes the centromeric chromatin together with several protein complexes , that function to stabilize the kinetochore foundations . Typically , the outer kinetochore plate in vertebrates is 30 - 40 nm thick with a diameter of 500 nm . Electron microscopy shows that microtubules are terminating at this site of the kinetochore , where an adequate scaffold for microtubule binding is provided ( Figure 1 . 3 A right panel and B ) . The fibrous corona , also indicated as corona filaments ( Rieder , 1982 ) , progressively become visible irradiating from the outer kinetochore plate as the number of microtubules attached to the kinetochore decreases , as shown following nocodazole treatment ( Cassimeris et al . , 1990 ) ( Figure 1 . 3 A left panel ) . By contributing to poleward kinetochore movements , corona filaments could provide a stable anchor point for microtubule attachment at the kinetochore ( Rieder and Alexander , 1990 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 25 Figure 1 . 3 . Kinetochore architecture in vertebrates . A . Schematic of a condensed chromosome flanked by EM pictures of specific structures on both sides . The left panel shows a section of kinetochore imaged using transmission electron microscopy where Ptk1 cells were treated with nocodazole for 20 minutes before fixation . The fibrous corona appears irradiating from the kinetochore ( arrowheads ) ( Cassimeris et al . , 1990 ) . In the panel on the right an electron tomography slice of a human kinetochore displays the presence of an outer plate , in contact with the microtubules of the spindle , and a separate inner plate that lies on condensed , centromeric chromatin .

The main functions of these groups of proteins are also indicated .

Enlargement of the area of the schematic in panel B highlighted by a black square , showing the interaction between CENP - C and the LEEGLG amino acid sequence present at the C - terminus of CENP - A . Chapter 1 : Introduction 26 Chapter 1 : Introduction 27 This is the ‘classical’ structure of the kinetochore in vertebrates ( Rieder , 1982 ) , however , extending the study of kinetochore structure to different organisms and by adopting different fixation procedure ( i . e . high pressure freezing in place of aldehyde fixatives ) of the sample for electron microscopy introduced some inconsistencies . Already in 1998 , by using high - pressure freezing , the outer plate appeared as a fibrous mat ( McEwen et al . , 1998 ) . Recently , by combining high - pressure freezing with 3D electron tomography ( 4 - 5 nm resolution ) , flared protofilaments were shown to extend from the microtubule plus end and slender fibrils constitute an element of continuity between the protofilaments and the kinetochore . These structures were apparently conserved in phylogenetically distant organisms ( McIntosh et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , the current view pictures the outer kinetochore more as fibrous net rather than a stack of plates ( Dong et al . , 2007 ; McIntosh et al . , 2013 ) . Despite the essential role during mitosis played by kinetochores , their structure remains still poorly understood . With regards to better characterize kinetochore structure , en elegant combination of biochemistry with electron microscopy gave an insight on the simplest kinetochore structure , in S . cerevisiae ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . In this study kinetochore particles were purified performing flag purification ( Dsn1 - flag ) and imaged attached to microtubules after taxol treatment . Large kinetochore particles ( 126 nm in length ) were found to interact with microtubules via their globular domains with additional rod - like structures ( predicted Ndc80 complex ) extending in a parallel manner along the microtubule and occasionally through a ring - like structure ( predicted Dam1 / Ska complex ) orthogonally oriented with respect to the microtubules . When bound to microtubule tips , the ring - like structure was always present however kinetochore particles measured an additional 50 nm in length . This study provided a first insight of kinetochore dimensions and structure exploiting the high resolution obtained using EM and also it was demonstrated that the core hub of the kinetochore is connected through a flexible linker to his globular domains . Chapter 1 : Introduction 28 1 . 3 . 2 Centromere and kinetochore inner layer In human chromosomes , the primary constriction site is also the locus of the centromere . The centromere is the region of DNA where determinants for kinetochore assembly are present . For this reason , the specification of the position of the centromere is relevant for the outcome of cell division . However , despite its importance in eukaryotes , the structure and complexity of the centromere varies between different organisms and is poorly understood ( Cleveland et al . , 2003 ) . Three types of centromere have been described : point , holocentric and regional ( Pluta et al . , 1995 ) . In S . cerevisiae centromere function is genetically determined by 125 bp of DNA sequence , also referred as point centromere ( Figure 1 . 4 A ) . This is sufficient to ensure the binding of one microtubule to the centromere ( McAinsh et al . , 2003 ; Westermann et al . , 2007 ) . It consists of , a single nucleosome ( Clarke and Carbon , 1980 ; Clarke and Carbon , 1985 ) composed of three distinct centromere DNA elements ( CDEs ) : both CDE I and CDE III present a conserved sequence able to specify for centromere function as a single mutation in these regions can abolish it . CDE II varies in sequence when comparing different budding yeast chromosomes , however the length ( 76 - 84 bp ) and AT composition ( 90 % ) remains unchanged . Importantly , CDE II region interacts with Cse4 / CENP - A ( Stoler et al . , 1995 ) . Organisms like C . elegans have holocentric centromeres , which extends along the entire length of the chromosomes ( Figure 1 . 4 B ) . Similarly , the kinetochore here forms a single long plate where HCP - 3 / CENP - A nucleosomes are intercalated with H3 - containing nucleosomes . Multiple microtubule attachment occurs in holocentric kinetochores ( Maddox et al . , 2004 ) . Regional centromeres are considered to be predominant in eukaryotes ( fission yeasts , plants , flies and vertebrates ) and are constituted of # - satellite DNA , spanning from hundreds of kilobases to megabases ( Sullivan et al . , 2001 ; Willard , 1985 ) . In humans , # - satellite DNA is organized in higher order repeats ( HOR ) where a tandem of core monomers , 171 bp long , are flanked , on each side , by other monomers which share only 50 % sequence identity , although the same monomer when repeated Chapter 1 : Introduction 29 present 90 % of sequence identity ( Figure 1 . 4 C ) ( Waye and Willard , 1989 ; Willard , 1990 ) . Regional centromeres are specified not only by the DNA sequence , but also by epigenetic factors ( Allshire and Karpen , 2008 ) . Three lines of evidence support this hypothesis . First , the sequence of the centromere is not evolutionarily conserved , not only across chromosomes of different organisms , but also between chromosomes in the same species ( Henikoff et al . , 2001 ) . Second , centromere sequence is not sufficient to determine centromere function , as observed in some dicentric chromosomes , where one of the centromeres is inactivated without undergoing sequence rearrangements ( Earnshaw and Migeon , 1985 ; Sullivan and Willard , 1998 ) . Lastly , centromeres have been observed moving to a different locus , not containing a - satellite repeats , called a neocentromere ( Amor et al . , 2004 ; Saffery et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , if centromere identity relies on epigenetic factors , then kinetochore assembly localisation is also determined by the epigenetic landscape . Chapter 1 : Introduction 30 Figure 1 . 4 . Schematic centromere representation in different model organisms . A . In S . cerevisiae the centromere is composed of one nucleosome able to bind Cse4 / CENP - A .

C . elegans carries holocentric centromeres . These extends for the whole length of chromosomes and therefore HCP - 3 / CENP - A is intercalated with histone H3 - containing nucleosomes .

Each HOR is composed of different monomers ( 171 bp in length ) , which share only 50 % of sequence identity . Adapted from ( Fukagawa and Earnshaw , 2014 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 31 1 . 3 . 2 . 1 CENP - A , a centromere unifier and a core kinetochore component Despite the lack of DNA sequence conservation , eukaryotic centromeres all assemble CENP - A . Most fundamentally , centromere chromatin is defined by the presence of CENP - A ( Earnshaw and Rothfield , 1985 ) , the centromere specific histone variant of H3 ( Palmer et al . , 1991 ) , present in centromere nucleosomes ( Palmer et al . , 1987 ) . CENP - A , together with CENP - B and CENP - C , were the first centromere proteins identified , found localising to the primary constriction of human chromosomes using serum obtained from patients affected by scleroderma CREST ( Earnshaw and Rothfield , 1985 ) . Following this discovery , an entire new subset of centromere proteins have been identified and studied ( Amano et al . , 2009 ; Foltz et al . , 2006 ; Izuta et al . , 2006 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ; Perpelescu and Fukagawa , 2011 ) . CENP - A homologs have also been identified in other species : Cse4p in S . cerevisiae ( Meluh et al . , 1998 ) , Cnp1 in S . pombe ( Takahashi et al . , 2000 ) , HCP3 in C . elegans ( Buchwitz et al . , 1999 ) and CID in D . melanogaster ( Henikoff et al . , 2000 ) . At present , the only known group of eukaryotes that do not assemble CENP - A nucleosomes at centromeres is the Trypanosomatid . CENP - A overexpression studies in D . melanogaster showed that CENP - A can be ectopically loaded into chromosome arms and generate functional kinetochores ( Heun et al . , 2006 ) . However , in human cells , tethering CENP - A to ectopic sites is not sufficient to generate functional de novo kinetochores ( Van Hooser et al . , 2001 ) , which suggests that additional factors are required ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ) . Nonetheless , depletion studies performed in C . elegans ( Oegema et al . , 2001 ) , mouse ( Howman et al . , 2000 ) , chicken ( Regnier et al . , 2005 ) and human ( Goshima et al . , 2003 ) indicated an essential role of CENP - A in proper chromosome congression at the metaphase plate , and segregation in anaphase . In addition , in vitro studies showed that , once in contact with X . laevis egg extracts , CENP - A chromatin arrays are able to recruit several kinetochore components ( Guse et al . , 2011 ) . These observations support a primary role of CENP - A as centromere identifier and kinetochore pillar . Due to the relevance of CENP - A , the question arose Chapter 1 : Introduction 32 about how cells control the location of CENP - A deposition , avoiding its spreading onto the chromosome arms . 1 . 3 . 2 . 2 Spatial and temporal deposition of CENP - A The amount of CENP - A at the centromere is diluted after every cycle of DNA replication ( Jansen et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2003 ; Shelby et al . , 2000 ; Sullivan and Karpen , 2001 ) , therefore the loading of new CENP - A is an essential process for the maintenance of a functional centromere . The only exception found is in S . cerevisiae where all old CENP - A molecules are substituted for new ones during S - phase ( Pearson et al . , 2004 ) . Despite the fact that CENP - A mRNA levels peak during G2 ( Shelby et al . , 1997 ) , it has been shown that , in human cells , CENP - A incorporation into newly replicated DNA occurs in early G1 ( Jansen et al . , 2007 ; Maddox et al . , 2007 ) . The process of CENP - A deposition can be divided into several steps : priming , incorporation and maturation . Initially , the Mis18 complex , which consists of Mis18 # , Mis18 " and Mis18 binding protein ( Mis18BP1 or KNL2 ) ( Fujita et al . , 2007 ; Hayashi et al . , 2004 ; Maddox et al . , 2007 ) , prime the centromeric chromatin for CENP - A loading . The Mis18 complex localises to centromeres in late mitosis , just before the loading of new CENP - A occurs . This could explain why a direct interaction between CENP - A and Mis18 complex has not been observed . However , it has been shown that the Mis18 complex physically binds to the Mis16 / RbAp48 / 46 complex . RbAp46 is a member of histone acetyl - transferase complexes ( HATs ) . The combination of the Mis18 and the Mis16 / RbAp48 / 46 complexes affect acetylation levels at the centromere ( Fujita et al . , 2007 ) . Additionally , depletion of any single component of the Mis18 complex ablates loading of newly synthesized CENP - A , leading to mitotic defects ( Fujita et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , increasing levels of acetylation at the centromere turn the chromatin into a ‘permissive’ state for CENP - A assembly . Next , newly synthesized CENP - A must be assembled onto centromere chromatin . This is the task performed by the Holliday junction - recognition protein ( HJURP ) , which works as a CENP - A specific chaperone ( Dunleavy et al . , 2009 ; Chapter 1 : Introduction 33 Foltz et al . , 2009 ) . HJURP only localizes at centromeres during a short window of time , extending from late telophase to early G1 ( 3 hours in human cells ) ( Dunleavy et al . , 2009 ; Foltz et al . , 2009 ) , in parallel with CENP - A deposition ( Jansen et al . , 2007 ) . HJURP is able to recognize CENP - A , in combination with H4 , through a highly conserved N - terminal region in CENP - A sequence called CENP - A targeting domain ( CATD ) ( Foltz et al . , 2009 ) . Depletion of HJURP in human cells severely limits the loading of CENP - A , with the appearance of segregation defects and micronuclei only after several rounds of mitosis ( Dunleavy et al . , 2009 ; Foltz et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that in normal circumstances an excess of CENP - A is present at centromeres , however , a minimal amount of CENP - A is critical for the execution of centromere functions . Remodeling and spacing factor ( RSF ) complex , composed by Rsf - 1 and Snf2h , is involved in the stabilization of new CENP - A at centromeres . The complex co - IPs with CENP - A and it can transiently accumulate at centromeres in the middle of G1 where it recruits new CENP - A . Additionally , Rsf - 1 depleted cells showed reduced levels of CENP - A signal at centromeres ( Perpelescu et al . , 2009 ) . More recently , it has been shown that Plk1 activity is required for proper centromere localization of Mis18 complex and HJURP ( McKinley and Cheeseman , 2014 ) and that CDK1 and CDK2 inhibit the loading of CENP - A during phases S , G2 and M of the cell cycle ( Silva et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , spatio temporal regulation of CENP - A deposition is essential for centromere maintenance and function . The mechanisms described here referred to studies performed in human cells or metazoans , however , with some mechanical differences in chromatin licensing and CENP - A chaperones are found across eukaryotes . Also found at the inner kinetochore is the chromosomal passenger complex ( CPC ) , present only in the early stages of mitosis . Here , the CPC is responsible for the correction of erroneous attachments of microtubules onto kinetochores . This will be discussed in more detail in a later section . Although CENP - A specifies where the kinetochore is going to be established , kinetochore functions are exerted by several other proteins , such as members of the CCAN and the KMN network . Chapter 1 : Introduction 34 1 . 3 . 3 Bridging inner and outer kinetochore : CCAN In 2006 , a number of new centromere proteins were discovered ( Foltz et al . , 2006 ; Izuta et al . , 2006 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . The entire subset of new centromere proteins has been termed , constitutive centromere associated network ( CCAN ) . These proteins are mostly located at the inner kinetochore and contribute to the stabilization of the outer kinetochore components , conferring stability for microtubule binding . Three different laboratories published the discovery of CCAN components in the same year . Foltz and colleagues ( Foltz et al . , 2006 ) expressed tagged versions of CENP - A or H3 in HeLa cells and performed IP and affinity purification experiments of the tagged histones . This led to the identification of CENP - M , CENP - N and CENP - T by mass - spectrometry . Later , these three proteins were individually overexpressed , followed by double affinity purification step ( TAP - tag purification followed by incubation with S - protein beads ) , further identifying CENP - I / K / L / O / P / Q / S . In this work , CENP - A proximal nucleosome associated complex ( NAC , CENP - C / H / N / M / U / T ) or CENP - A - nucleosome distal ( CAD , CENP - I / L / O / P / Q / R / S ) proteins were identified . Other researchers ( Izuta et al . , 2006 ) developed a method to identify interaction partners of CENP - A or H3 by using specific monoclonal antibodies ( Ando et al . , 2002 ) using interphase nuclei isolated from HeLa cells . To preserve its native structure , isolated DNA mixed with proteins was not sonicated or cross - linked with formaldehyde , as in conventional ChIP protocols , but treated with micrococcal nuclease followed by salt treatment ( 0 . 3 M NaCl ) . This procedure was called Native Chromatin IP ( NChIP ) . DNA digestion led to isolation of the components of the Interphase Centromere Complex ( ICEN ) . Ultimately , the expression of tagged CENP - H and CENP - I in chicken DT40 cells and of CENP - H , CENP - O and CENP - P in HeLa cells prompted the identification of CENP - H / I / K / L / M / N / O / P / Q / R / U as centromere proteins by performing immuno - precipitation and mass - spectrometry ( Okada et al . , 2006 ) . This list was later expanded when CENP - W ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) and CENP - X ( Amano et al . , 2009 ) were also identified . Chapter 1 : Introduction 35 At present 16 components have been classified as members of the CCAN ( Figure 1 . 3 B ) , and divided into sub - groups on the basis of reciprocal dependencies ( McAinsh and Meraldi , 2011 ; Perpelescu and Fukagawa , 2011 ) . These studies have provided an almost exhaustive parts list of the CCAN , however the mechanism by which a functional kinetochore is assembled from these parts ( CCAN components ) is yet to be fully elucidated . In addition , as the initial studies pointed out , there are a number of CCAN components that can directly interact with chromatin and others that do not . These will be now discussed . 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 Chromatin interface The CCAN , placed in between the centromere chromatin and the outer kinetochore protein complexes , mediates the interaction between these two compartments . In order to do so , some CCAN members have shown to bind to chromatin . Currently three connection points have been found between chromatin and CCAN . These involve CENP - N , CENP - C and CENP - T . In vitro experiments showed that CENP - N binds directly to CENP - A , but not to H3 containing nucleosomes ( Carroll et al . , 2009 ) . This was shown by incubating 35 S - labelled centromere proteins with reconstituted nucleosomes containing or lacking CENP - A and by looking at the shift of nucleosome migration on an agarose gel . In addition , CENP - N could interact with a mutant H3 containing the CENP - A targeting domain ( CATD ) , H3 CATD . This highlighted and confirmed the importance of the CATD domain to CENP - A functions ( Black et al . , 2004 ; Black et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , it was found that upon CENP - A overexpression , CENP - N co - localized to the chromosome arm , supporting previous evidences for CENP - A binding ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ) . Despite its dependence on CENP - A , CENP - N was observed to be recruited at CENP - A free chromatin sites ( lacO arrays ) where N - terminus fragment of CENP - T or CENP - C lacI fusion proteins were tethered ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that not only interaction with CENP - A but also contacts with other CENPs can contribute to CENP - N localization . More recently , it has been shown that CENP - N levels at kinetochores are higher during S and G2 phases compared to M and G1 phases ( Fang et al . , 2015 ; Hellwig et al . , 2011 ) as a consequence of the exposure to an Arg80 / Gly81 loop on CENP - A ( Fang et al . , 2015 ) that recruits Chapter 1 : Introduction 36 CENP - N in a cell cycle - regulated manner . Following these observations , a possible role of CENP - N in centromere chromatin replication has been hypothesised . CENP - C , recognised as part of the inner kinetochore ( Saitoh et al . , 1992 ) , is involved in the binding of both DNA ( with its C - terminus ) ( Yang et al . , 1996 ) and Mis12 complex ( with its N - terminus ) , placed in the outer kinetochore ( Przewloka et al . , 2011 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly to CENP - N , the ability of CENP - C to bind CENP - A nucleosomes was tested by incubation in vitro , prior to running a gel and observing a shift in CENP - A nucleosomes migration ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ) . A motif at the C - terminus of CENP - A , ‘LEEGLG’ , located outside of the CATD domain , was found to be sufficient to promote CENP - C binding to H3 ( Figure 1 . 3 C ) . In contrast , studies in chicken DT40 cells revealed an interaction by immunoprecipitation of CENP - C with H3 mononucleosomes , but not with CENP - A ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) , although super - resolution images of stretched centromere fibers in DT40 cells showed co - localization of CENP - A and CENP - C ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . However , one evidence supporting a dependency of CENP - C on CENP - A in chicken cells derives from the observation of a decrease in the levels of CENP - C following CENP - A depletion ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) . Additionally , structural studies on Mif2p , the CENP - C homologue in S . cerevisiae , revealed the presence of a dimerization domain at the C - terminus of the protein ( Cohen et al . , 2008 ) . Mutantions designed to disrupt the dimer formation impaired mutants growth at 37°C , suggesting a role of the CENP - C dimer for kinetochore function in vivo . Importantly CENP - C , besides making connections with inner kinetochore chromatin , organises , together with other CCAN , a platform for the outer kinetochore as it has been shown that ectopic expression of CENP - C can recruit the Mis12 complex ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ) . CENP - T contains a long , unstructured N - terminal tail and a histone - fold domain ( HFD ) at the C - terminus . The HFD is required for CENP - T DNA binding activity ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) . CENP - T was found to bind preferentially with H3 containing nucleosomes , rather than CENP - A . However , reduced levels of CENP - T were found in cells depleted of CENP - A ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) . In addition , the HFD also allows CENP - T to combine with CENP - W ( a 100 amino acid protein , a majority Chapter 1 : Introduction 37 of which also comprises a HFD ( Hori et al . , 2008a ; Nishino et al . , 2012 ) , forming a heterodimer . Following its isolation ( Foltz et al . , 2006 ) , CENP - S was identified as putative binding / interacting partner of CENP - X and CENP - T by mass - spectrometry ( Amano et al . , 2009 ) . Later , it was confirmed by in vitro experiments that chicken CENP T / W and S / X sub - complexes form a heterotetramer able to super - coil the DNA in a nucleosome - like fashion ( Nishino et al . , 2012 ) . However , unlike canonical nucleosomes , which must have 147 bp of DNA wrapped around them , the CENP - T / W / S / X heterotetramer was able to protect only 100 bp of chromatin from micrococcal nuclease digestion . Furthermore , CENP - T / W / S / X complex purified from chicken cells induces positive supercoiling of the DNA , in contrast to the negative supercoiling imposed by canonical nucleosomes ( Takeuchi et al . , 2014 ) . This activity is only found in the complete T / W / S / X complex , as T / W and S / X sub - complexes alone do not induce positive supercoiling in chromatin . Interestingly , the positive supercoiling thus obtained has been proposed to be a characteristic signature of centromere chromatin , which would contribute to the recruitment of other CCAN components specifically to the centromere . This hypothesis has been supported by FRET experiments in human cells , where the observation of the loading at the centromere of CENP - T / W / S / X complex from mid - S phase up until G2 , preceding CENP - A loading ( in early G1 ) , and also at DNA damaged sites , suggested a role for the complex in turning the chromatin into a ‘kinetochore - competent’ state ( Dornblut et al . , 2014 ) . Despite the T / W and S / X sub - complexes co - operating together in DNA binding , their contribution to the overall kinetochore assembly process must be separate since deletion of CENP - T / W is lethal in chicken DT40 cells ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) , whereas depletion of CENP - S / X is not , although it has been reported to affects outer kinetochore plate length ( Amano et al . , 2009 ) . CENP - T / W / S / X complex also has a primary role in connecting inner kinetochore chromatin with outer kinetochore protein complexes . Indeed , the N - terminal tail of CENP - T has been shown to directly interact with the Ndc80 complex ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Hori et al . , 2008a ; Nishino et al . , 2013 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ) . Also , the CENP - T N - terminal tail is phosphorylated in a cell cycle dependent manner by CDK1 kinase , which could be a mechanism for ensuring a time - regulated Chapter 1 : Introduction 38 formation of a functional kinetochore ( Gascoigne and Cheeseman , 2013 ; Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ) . If CENP - C and CENP - T confer their essential role in kinetochore function due to the simultaneous interaction with centromere chromatin and outer kinetochore components at the same time , it is relevant that CENP - N , the only one of the three interacting directly with CENP - A , does not extend far from CENP - A chromatin . However , more components of the CCAN are positioned more distal than CENP - A chromatin , overlooking at outer kinetochore components , whose role / function has been less studied . 1 . 3 . 3 . 2 Trapped in the middle : extended CCAN The CENP - H / I / K / M complex centromere localization is dependent on CENP - A , CENP - T / W ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) and in humans , also CENP - C ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ) . This complex has been reported to influence CENP - A chromatin and plus tips of microtubules . CENP - H and CENP - I have been reported to affect the recruitment of newly synthesized CENP - A to the centromere ( Hori et al . , 2013 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . Although one study found that CENP - H did not directly bind to CENP - A ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) , recent work , using super - resolution microscopy revealed that the two components localize close to each other on centromere fibers ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) and in human neocentromeres ( Alonso et al . , 2007 ) . Importantly , the overexpression of CENP - H has been linked to an increase in chromosomal instability ( CIN ) and has been found in several primary tumours ( Liao et al . , 2009 ; Shigeishi et al . , 2006 ) . CENP - K plays a role in Hec1 / Ndc80 localization , where depletion of both CENP - K and KNL1 drastically impairs Hec1 / Ndc80 kinetochore localization ( Cheeseman et al . , 2008 ) . Depletion of CENP - I can trigger severe mitotic defects as this protein is known to interact with outer kinetochore protein components such as CENP - F and Mad1 / 2 ( Liu et al . , 2003 ) . It has been recently shown that CENP - H and CENP - I can modulate microtubule dynamics during chromosome congression onto the metaphase plate , by accumulating at the kinetochore in favour of microtubule polymerisation ( Amaro et al . , 2010 ) . If the CENP - H / I / K complex can affect microtubule dynamics this would explain the phenotypes of mitotic block and defective chromosome congression upon depletion of these proteins . In support of Chapter 1 : Introduction 39 this evidence , a new mechanism for spindle checkpoint maintenance during prometaphase was found . CENP - I was shown to be involved in preventing Mad1 and the RZZ complex from dissociating from kinetochores that have not been properly attached by spindle microtubules . This action would complement Aurora B activity , which induces Mad1 and RZZ complex association , which is particularly important in the absence of Aurora B activity ( Matson and Stukenberg , 2014 ) . Recently , CENP - M was found to be cross - linked with CENP - I , and its depletion associated with chromosome alignment defects . CENP - M has also been shown to be an inactive GTPase , related to the Rab1 family ; it is required for proper CENP - I localization and interaction with outer kinetochore proteins . Surprisingly , depletion of CENP - M decreased the levels of CENP - T / W and Ndc80 ( Basilico et al . , 2014 ) . CENP - L / M were initially classified as a small sub - complex , however new evidence supports CENP - M as part of the CENP - H / I / K sub - complex . Despite this , CENP - L was shown to relate to CENP - M in some aspects as follows . CENP - L / M were initially co - purified with the H / I / K sub - complex and the centromere localization was shown to be interdependent among these centromere proteins ( Okada et al . , 2006 ) . Depletion of CENP - L / M in HeLa cells , by RNAi , caused a decrease in the amount of CENP - H / I at kinetochores ( Foltz et al . , 2006 ; Izuta et al . , 2006 ) . Specifically with CENP - L , RNAi studies showed that its depletion is connected with the increase of monopolar spindles in mitotic cells ( McClelland et al . , 2007 ) , and in vitro studies demonstrated an interaction between CENP - L and the N - terminus of CENP - N ( Carroll et al . , 2009 ) . Some research suggests that the CENP - O / P / R / Q / U sub - complex functions downstream of the sub - complexes previously described ( Takeuchi and Fukagawa , 2012 ) . Although depletion of any of these components does not affect cell viability in DT40 cells , mitotic phenotypes can arise following chromosome segregation in a depletion background ( Hori et al . , 2008b ; Izuta et al . , 2006 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . Its role becomes essential in DT40 cells for spindle recovery following impairment of spindle dynamics , such as after nocodazole treatment ( Hori et al . , 2008b ) . Using a fluorescent three - hybrid assay ( F3H ) , it has been shown that CENP - O / P / R / Q / U can interact with one another at an ectopic site on the chromosomes ( Eskat et al . , 2012 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 40 Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) data also confirmed the proximity of the subunits to one another in the kinetochore . In addition , fluorescence cross - correlation spectroscopy ( FCCS ) measurements demonstrated that the complex does not pre - assemble in the nucleoplasm ( Eskat et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , CENP - O has been reported to be present at centromeres in S - phase , similarly to CENP - N and CENP - T / W . Its protein levels at the prekinetochore / kinetochore progressively decrease during mitosis ( Eskat et al . , 2012 ; McAinsh et al . , 2006 ) . Moreover , recent studies showed a connection between members of this sub - complex and the mechanism driving chromosome congression : CENP - U would recruit Polo - like kinase 1 ( Plk1 ) to the kinetochore through a phosphorylation step and Plk1 / CENP - U / CENP - Q form a ternary complex , and only in this conformation CENP - Q is phosphorylated by Plk1 in human cells ( Kang et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , a Plk1 independent mechanism has been shown where CENP - Q is essential for the recruitment of motor - protein CENP - E at kinetochores , contributing to chromosome segregation ( Bancroft et al . , 2015 ) . The most recently characterised kinetochore proteins were identified by SILAC mass - spectrometry analysis of chromosomes isolated from DT40 cells ( Ohta et al . , 2010 ) . Out of the entire DT40 chromosome - proteome , 13 novel kinetochore proteins were identified that , in agreement with the established nomenclature , have been named with letters Y and Z and numbers from 27 to 36 ( i . e . CENP - Y or CENP - 27 ) . These proteins are still mostly uncharacterised , although a recent study described an essential role for CENP - 32 in the maintenance of centrosome / spindle pole association ( Ohta et al . , 2015 ) . 1 . 3 . 4 Outer kinetochore : KMN network and SAC The KMN is a conserved network of proteins , across eukaryotes , which functions as a microtubule binding site and as a platform for the recruitment of SAC components . The acronym KMN stands for the initials of the components of the network : kinetochore null protein 1 ( KNL1 ) , missegregation 12 ( Mis12 ) and nuclear division cycle 80 ( Ndc80 ) complexes . These protein complexes are bound to the kinetochore in mitosis where they play an essential role in the formation of end - on Chapter 1 : Introduction 41 attachments . The assembly of a defective KMN has been shown to result in problems in chromosome segregation errors ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ) . 1 . 3 . 4 . 1 KMN network components The Ndc80 complex is a heterotetramer composed of : Ndc80 ( also known as Hec1 in human ) and nuclear filamentous 2 ( Nuf2 ) , organized into one heterodimer , and spindle pole component 24 ( Spc24 ) and 25 ( Spc25 ) forming a second heterodimer . Each heterodimer consists of a long coiled - coil region , with two globular domains at one end ( one per protein ) . Spc24 / 25 heterodimer has globular heads located at the C - terminus , whereas in Ndc80 / Nuf2 heterodimer they are located at the N - terminus of the proteins . The heterodimers interact via the extremities of their coiled - coils , and the overall complex forms a dumb - bell shaped structure with a total length of $ 60 nm ( Ciferri et al . , 2005 ; Ciferri et al . , 2008 ; Wei et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 1 . 3 B ) . The C - terminal globular heads of Spc24 / 25 are important for the recruitment of the complex at the kinetochore as they interact with Mis12 ( Petrovic et al . , 2010 ) and with the CCAN via CENP - T ( Bock et al . , 2012 ; Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Hori et al . , 2013 ; Nishino et al . , 2013 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ) . The N - terminal globular heads of Ndc80 / Nuf2 fold into a calponin homology ( CH ) domain , required for binding to microtubules ( Cheeseman et al . , 2006 ; Ciferri et al . , 2008 ; Wei et al . , 2007 ) . Structural studies of Ndc80 bonsai ( a shorter version of Ndc80 , lacking the coiled - coil region ) in combination with tubulin dimers , clarified that microtubules interact with a site contained in the CH domain of Ndc80 , called the ‘toe’ ( Alushin et al . , 2010 ) . The toe includes positively charged residues that recognise a negatively charged region at the interface between # and " tubulin , named the ‘toe print’ . It has been proposed that the presence of this site might act as a sensor , limiting the binding of Ndc80 to straight microtubule protofilaments rather than to curled ones . In addition , Ndc80 forms electrostatic interactions between its positively charged N - terminus and the E - hooks ( acidic carboxy - terminal tails ) present on each tubulin monomer ( Alushin et al . , 2010 ; Ciferri et al . , 2008 ; Wei et al . , 2007 ) . This contributes to the co - operative binding of Ndc80 to microtubules , which is mediated by Ndc80 N - terminal tail . When the ‘toe print’ , recognised by Ndc80 , is displaced due to microtubule depolymerisation , Ndc80 shifts preferentially Chapter 1 : Introduction 42 towards the microtubule minus end ( biased diffusion ) for the maintenance of a stable attachment ( Alushin et al . , 2010 ) . The human Mis12 complex consists of Nnf1 , Mis12 , Dsn1 and Nsl1 . These subunits form a rod - like structure ( Petrovic et al . , 2010 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 1 . 3 B ) . The yeast Mis12 complex homologue ( Mtw1 / MIND ) was shown to have a similar structure as the human , and an interaction was observed with the Spc24 / 25 subunit of the Ndc80 complex ( Hornung et al . , 2011 ; Maskell et al . , 2010 ) . In vertebrates , cross - linking studies revealed that the C - terminus tail of Nsl1 interacts with both the Ndc80 and KNL1 complexes , even though these two complexes do not interact with one another ( Petrovic et al . , 2010 ) . KNL1 , first identified in C . elegans ( Desai et al . , 2003 ) , forms a heterodimer with ZW10 - interacting protein 1 ( ZWINT1 ) in humans ( Petrovic et al . , 2010 ) . KNL1 depletion demonstrated that it is required for proper chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate , and showed that its loss can lead to cell death in chicken DT40 cells ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ) . More observations in C . elegans and D . melonogaster demonstrated that KNL1 is required for the localization of Ndc80 at kinetochores ( Desai et al . , 2003 ; Przewloka et al . , 2007 ) . However in humans , this pathway is also influenced by CENP - H / I / K ( Cheeseman et al . , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2003 ) . 1 . 3 . 4 . 2 KMN is a platform for both microtubule attachments and SAC activity The spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) includes a group of proteins , conserved across eukaryotes , which tightly regulate the process of chromatid segregation , delaying anaphase entry until all the chromosomes are bioriented , in order to avoid missegregation events . The SAC is activated by unattached kinetochores . This is due to the inactivation of cell division cycle 20 ( Cdc20 ) that normally activates the APC / C . In order to do so , Cdc20 is sequestered by the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) , composed of mitotic arrest deficient 2 ( Mad2 ) , budding uninhibited by benomyl 3 ( Bub3 ) and Bub1 - related ( BubR1 ) proteins ( Sudakin et al . , 2001 ) . APC / C , once active , triggers the proteolytic degradation of Cyclin B and securin , allowing anaphase to start . For this reason , modulating the activity of Chapter 1 : Introduction 43 APC / C is crucial for the achievement of a correct ploidy in the daughter cells ( Foley and Kapoor , 2013 ) . Unattached kinetochores recruit high levels of monopolar spindle protein 1 ( Mps1 ) kinase ( Hewitt et al . , 2010 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2010 ; Maciejowski et al . , 2010 ; Santaguida et al . , 2010 ) . Recently , a new model has been proposed for SAC activation ( Figure 1 . 5 ) . In this model it was suggested that Mps1 phosphorylates KNL1 at its MELT ( M [ D / E ] [ I / L / V / M ] [ S / T ] ) repeats ( London et al . , 2012 ; Shepperd et al . , 2012 ; Yamagishi et al . , 2012 ) , recruiting Bub1 and Bub3 to kinetochores ( Kiyomitsu et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , in addition to ZWINT1 , within which KNL1 is in complex , other members of the RZZ complex such as Rod , Zwilch and ZW10 are targeted to KNL1 ; however it is unclear whether their binding depend on the Mps1 phosphorylation of KNL1 ( Hewitt et al . , 2010 ; Maciejowski et al . , 2010 ; Santaguida et al . , 2010 ) . The kinetochore localization of Mad1 and Mad2 heterodimers is dependent on the RZZ ( Kops et al . , 2005 ) . Mad2 has been proposed to exist in two conformations : ‘open’ and ‘closed’ ( Figure 1 . 5 ) . When Mad2 , through its association with Mad1 , is recruited to the kinetochore , it is in a closed conformation . Closed - Mad2 can bind Cdc20 preventing its interaction and activation of the APC / C . In addition to the pool of Mad2 bound to the kinetochore , there is also a pool of free cytosolic open - Mad2 . Open - Mad2 cannot bind Cdc20 ( Luo et al . , 2000 ; Luo et al . , 2002 ; Luo et al . , 2004 ) . Closed - Mad2 at the kinetochore is able to interact with open - Mad2 and induce a conformational change in its structure to revert it into a closed Mad2 , which is now able to interact with Cdc20 and sequester it into the MCC complex , until the ‘anaphase - waiting signal’ is switched off ( all the kinetochores are attached to microtubules and chromosomes are bioriented ) ( De Antoni et al . , 2005 ; Luo and Yu , 2008 ; Mapelli et al . , 2007 ; Mapelli and Musacchio , 2007 ) . In this context , the Aurora B dependent mechanism of biorientation silences the SAC . Aurora B kinase , a member of the CPC complex , by phosphorylating its targets is responsible for the correction of erroneous attachments of microtubules onto kinetochores ( Carmena et al . , 2012 ) . As previously mentioned , the CPC complex localizes at centromeres in early mitosis . The CPC complex is composed of four subunits : Incenp , Survivin , Borealin / Dasra and Aurora B . Incenp , Survivin and Chapter 1 : Introduction 44 Borealin all contribute to the centromere localization of the complex ( Carmena et al . , 2012 ) . Aurora B kinase can phosphorylate , in addition to other substrates , the Ndc80 complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2006 ; DeLuca et al . , 2006 ) and MCAK , a microtubule depolymerazing kinesin ( Andrews et al . , 2004 ; Lan et al . , 2004 ; Ohi et al . , 2004 ) , causing a destabilization of microtubule attachments . More recently , a mechanism coupling the phosphorylation activity of Aurora B kinase with tension generated by bipolar attachments was proposed in both yeast and human cells ( Liu et al . , 2009 ; Tanaka et al . , 2002 ) . The tension generated at the centromere , as a result of correct microtubule attachments , increases the distance of kinetochore proteins from Aurora B kinase , which , in this configuration is unable to phosphorylate these targets ( Tanaka , 2013 ) . In contrast , when erroneous or none attachments are present at kinetochores , kinetochore proteins are now located in close proximity with the kinase , which can now phosphorylate them . During anaphase the CPC migrates to the spindle midzone where it remains until completion of cytokinesis . At the midzone CPC promotes an accurate cell abscission ( Carmena et al . , 2012 ; Earnshaw and Cooke , 1991 ; Jeyaprakash et al . , 2007 ; Yamagishi et al . , 2010 ) . Specifically , it has been reported that Borealin interacts with the ESCRT - III , the complex that mediates the end of cytokinesis ( Capalbo et al . , 2012 ; Carlton et al . , 2012 ) . How stable kinetochore - MT attachments are maintained is still not fully understood . Growing evidence suggests that this could be the role of the spindle and kinetochore associated ( Ska ) complex . The composition of this complex with Ska1 , Ska2 and Ska3 ( Rama1 ) has been deeply studied ( Abad et al . , 2014 ; Daum et al . , 2009 ; Gaitanos et al . , 2009 ; Hanisch et al . , 2006 ; Jeyaprakash et al . , 2012 ; Raaijmakers et al . , 2009 ; Theis et al . , 2009 ; Welburn et al . , 2009 ) . A functional homolog in yeast has been also identified , known as Dam1 complex , and it is composed by ten subunits assembled in the shape of a ring that surrounds microtubules ( Gaitanos et al . , 2009 ; Hanisch et al . , 2006 ; Schmidt et al . , 2012 ; Welburn et al . , 2009 ) . This conformation differs from the structure of the metazoan Ska complex , recently elucidated by crystallography ( W shaped ) ( Jeyaprakash et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1 . 3 B ) . In vitro experiments showed that both Ska and Dam complexes are able to bind to dynamic microtubules ( Abad et al . , 2014 ; Asbury et al . , 2006 ; Grishchuk et al . , 2008 ; Welburn et al . , 2009 ; Westermann et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , it Chapter 1 : Introduction 45 has been shown that the association of the Cdt1 and Dis1 proteins , with the loop domain ( loop that interrupts the coiled - coil region ) of Ndc80 , stabilise the interactions between the kinetochore and microtubules ( Hsu and Toda , 2011 ; Varma et al . , 2012 ) . The SAC signal is removed by the recruitment of protein phosphatase PP1 to the kinetochore via a PP1 binding motif in KNL1 ( Pinsky et al . , 2009 ; Vanoosthuyse and Hardwick , 2009 ) and also through dynein / dynactin stripping of Mad1 from the kinetochore in the direction of the spindle poles ( Howell et al . , 2001 ) . Recent evidence has highlighted a possible role of KNL1 in activating Aurora B kinase , coupling the SAC with KT - MTs attachment error - correction ( Caldas et al . , 2013 ) . According to this model , the N - terminal region of KNL1 is sufficient for protein kinase Bub1 recruitment at the kinetochore , triggering the phosphorylation of histone H2A and thereby contributing to Aurora B localization at the centromere ( Yamagishi et al . , 2010 ) . To support this , measurements of Bub1 activity with Aurora B activity seemed to correlate , and levels in such activities were dropping upon KNL1 silencing . In summary , the kinetochore in eukaryotes is an essential structure required for microtubule attachment , and therefore viable cell division . This structure has been visualized in numerous ways since its first observation in 1966 by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Brinkley and Stubblefield , 1966 ) . Attempts have also been made using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Harrison et al . , 1985 ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Pietrasanta et al . , 1999 ) , however these modes of microscopy either do not have the resolving power necessary ( SEM ) or they are too technically challenging ( AFM ) . At present the most frequent mode of microscopy used to visualize the kinetochore is light microscopy , exploiting the properties of fluorescent probes or GFP - fusion proteins . Chapter 1 : Introduction 46 Figure 1 . 5 . Spindle assembly checkpoint and the ‘anaphase - wait’ signal . MPS1 kinase phosphorylates KNL1 at the MELT repeats at no microtubule bound kinetochores . This phosphorylation event triggers the recruitment of RZZ complex and Bub3 , Bub1 and BubR1 to the kinetochore . The recruitment of the latter group of proteins is linked to the kinetochore localization of Mad1 / Mad2 heterodimer . The heterodimer is composed of closed Mad2 , which is able to interact with free open Mad2 and catalyse its transition to the closed conformation . Closed Mad2 binds Cdc20 , Bub3 and BubR1 subsequently sequester them in the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) . Adapted from ( Foley and Kapoor , 2013 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 47 1 . 4 Contemporary methods for imaging the structure of the inner kinetochore Although the protein composition of the kinetochore has been deeply studied , much less is known about the spatial arrangements of these components and their interactions with the chromatin , an event that allows the kinetochore to perform its crucial roles . Methods currently used to tackle this question are conventional fluorescence microscopy ( Blower et al . , 2002 ; Bodor et al . , 2014 ; Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Haase et al . , 2013 ; Joglekar et al . , 2009 ; Joglekar et al . , 2008 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Lawrimore et al . , 2011 ; Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ; Suzuki et al . , 2014 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ) and super - resolution microscopy ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . As the work presented in this thesis is based on fluorescence microscopy methods , I will discuss recent advances in the understanding of kinetochore structure achieved using fluorescence microscopy techniques . 1 . 4 . 1 Conventional wide field fluorescence microscopy : centromere protein copy number and localization Conventional light microscopy enables the visualization of proteins of interest within cells with relatively routine sample preparation , compared with other microscopy methods ( i . e . electron microscopy ) . The use of this technique increased exponentially after the generation of the first fluorescent proteins ( Lippincott - Schwartz and Patterson , 2003 ; Tsien , 1998 ) . The earliest studies looking at protein copy number were performed starting in S . cerevisiae , where the aim was to calculate protein copy number at kinetochores based on fluorescence intensities . It was found that , when comparing the copy of kinetochore proteins , from S . pombe and in C . albicans , the amount of CENP - A nucleosomes does not positively correlate with centromere chromatin length , however it does positively correlate with the number of microtubules bound per kinetochore ( Joglekar et al . , 2008 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 ) . However , these quantifications are still contentious as changing reference standard parameters determined a different estimation of kinetochore protein copy number ( Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Lawrimore et al . , 2011 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 48 Concomitantly , studies in S . cerevisiae and human cells developed similar methods to measure distances between fluorescence centroids of kinetochore proteins using a two - colour fluorescent labelling approach in the presence of tension ( metaphase plate ) , ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ) . These studies showed a comparable distribution of proteins within the kinetochore in both organisms ( Figure 1 . 6 ) . Adopting two - colour fluorescent labelling and centroid distance measurements , allowed quantification of distances for SAC proteins as well as CCAN components with an accuracy of few tens of nanometers in human cells ( Suzuki et al . , 2014 ; Varma et al . , 2013 ) . Studies have also been focused on mapping the localization of core kinetochore components or histone modifications onto centromere chromatin with the aim of better characterising the inner kinetochore structure . To compare the fluorescence pattern of specific histone modifications relative to CENP - A on metaphase chromosomes ( Figure 1 . 7 A ) or on stretched chromatin fibers ( Figure 1 . 7 B ) ( Blower et al . , 2002 ; Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) studies were performed in D . melanogaster and human centromeres , where a distinct separation between Cid / CENP - A and H3K4me2 containing nucleosomes was observed . These results were formalized into a model , known as ‘amphipathic model’ , for centromere chromatin architecture . Chapter 1 : Introduction 49 Figure 1 . 6 . Distances measured between CENP - A and other kinetochore components in both S . cerevisiae and human kinetochores . Schematic summarising the distances , expressed in nm , measured between each CENP and CENP - A in human ( Wan et al . , 2009 ) and budding yeast ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ) kinetochores under tension . The following budding yeast proteins are homologs of : ( Cse4 ) CENP - A , ( Ctf19 ) CENP - P , ( Okp1 ) CENP - Q , ( Ame1 ) CENP - U , ( Mtw1 ) Mis12 , ( Spc105 ) KNL1 . Ask1 is a component of the Dam1 complex in yeast . CENP proteins are coloured in green , with the exception of CENP - A ( blue ) , Ndc80 complex in orange , KNL1 in pink and Mis12 complex in red . When protein localization is measured from the N - terminus , C - terminus or middle region , letters N , C or M are indicated . Chapter 1 : Introduction 50 Figure 1 . 7 . Amphipathic model for centromere chromatin assembly . A . Configuration of chromatin at centromeres in intact chromosomes . Chromatin containing CENP - A ( light green ) is found on the external surface of the centromere , facing the outer kinetochore plate ( brown ) where microtubules are bound ( dark green ) ; whereas H3K4me2 nucleosomes are restricted to the inner centromere region and have no contact with kinetochore proteins . Cohesin complex is represented in purple . B . Pattern of CENP - A and H3 containing chromatin observed in fibers , that supports this model . Chapter 1 : Introduction 51 1 . 4 . 2 Super - Resolution Microscopy : the new frontier of light microscopy Conventional fluorescence microscopy has a resolution limit dictated by the diffraction limit of light ( 250 nm ) ( Abbe , 1873 ) . This means that any light - emitting object smaller than 250 nm will be visualised as a blurry spot , impairing the observation of fine structural details . Similarly , two light - emitting objects in close proximity ( i . e . distance < 250 nm ) will be seen as one when observed by conventional microscopy . This effect is due to what is better known as ‘point spread function’ ( PSF ) , which describes how an imaginary light - emitting object , with the shape of a point , is represented in an image . The PSF is a common parameter used to indicate the resolution achieved by an optical system , like a microscope . The range of sizes of macro - molecules generally spans from tens to a few hundred nm , therefore the observation of most sub - cellular compartments , smaller than the Abbe limit ( 250 nm ) , is highly limitated by conventional microscopy . During the last 20 years improved novel microscopy methods have been developed , allowing imaging with greater resolution ( between 30 - 100 nm ) ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Dickson et al . , 1997 ; Hell and Wichmann , 1994 ) . Collectively , these techniques are known as ‘super - resolution’ ( SR ) imaging ( Gustafsson , 2000 ; Huang et al . , 2009 ; Lippincott - Schwartz and Patterson , 2009 ; Schermelleh et al . , 2010 ) . A brief description of the most commonly used SR techniques is presented here , including : structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) and stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) , which both rely on characteristic illumination systems and single molecule localization techniques such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) and photo - activation localization microscopy ( PALM ) ( Figure 1 . 8 A ) . ‘Structured illumination microscopy’ ( SIM ) is based on a characteristic sample illumination where the light passes through a movable optical grating , which can be oriented in different directions , projecting light patterns onto the sample ( Gustafsson , 2000 ; Heintzmann and Cremer , 1999 ) . This is also referred to as non - uniform wide - field illumination ( Figure 1 . 8 B ) . The application of coarser shading patterns to finer cellular structures produces a set of moiré fringes in the light Chapter 1 : Introduction 52 emitted . Multiple raw images are acquired of every vertical section . The complete set of images is then computationally processed to identify the size of the grating , its periodicity and direction , determining an increase in resolution in x and y . By superimposing raw images where moiré fringes are present , in different areas of the samples , an image can be reconstructed that has lateral resolution that is twice that of wide - field microscopy . With the development of three - dimensional SIM ( 3D - SIM ) , the potential resolution achieved along the z axis doubled ( Figure 1 . 8 A , 350 nm versus $ 700 nm ) . This is achieved by modulation of the light excitation in the z axis using three - beam interference ( Gustafsson et al . , 2008 ; Schermelleh et al . , 2008 ) . One particular benefit is that standard staining techniques of cell samples can be combined with SIM and 3D - SIM acquisition enabling the visualization of multiple structures at the same time , and the study of their reciprocal localization . ‘Stimulated emission depletion’ ( STED ) ( Dyba and Hell , 2002 ; Dyba et al . , 2003 ; Hell and Wichmann , 1994 ; Klar et al . , 2000 ) typically uses a combination of two laser beams for scanning the sample , that are shone on the sample in sequence , not at the same time ( Figure 1 . 8 B ) . The first beam excites the fluorophores present in the sample . Illumination by the second laser is delayed , and this is referred to as the STED laser . This has a longer wavelength ( less energy ) and has the shape of a doughnut , illuminating the fluorophores positioned off the center of the emitting object . This causes all the fluorophores surrounding the centre of the PSF to return back to ground state ( de - excitation ) . The centre of the emitting object is protected from the effects of the STED laser by a phase plate through which the laser light is unable to pass . Therefore , the STED reduces the size of the PSF beyond the diffraction limit . Doing so , the resolution that can be achieved in x and y is approximately 60 nm ( Figure 1 . 8 A ) . The main limitation of this technique is related to the restricted combination of probes available per experiment . It is important to avoid any excitation in the wave - length of the depletion beam , as this would not allow the de - excitation of the signal . Commonly used combinations of secondary antibodies are : Alexa 488 and Alexa 555 or Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 ( Schermelleh et al . , 2008 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 53 Single molecule localization techniques rely on the light - emitting properties of the fluorescent molecules used and they are based on the assumption that many photons contribute to the appearance of the PSF of an object . The photons are emitted from the same object , therefore the PSF can be described by a gaussian function , where a gaussian fitting can determine the centroid from which the fluorescence departs . Despite this rather simple formulation , several difficulties have been encountered in order to separate single photons . Approaches based on colour emission ( Bornfleth et al . , 1998 ) and fluorescence life - time ( Heilemann et al . , 2002 ) have been attempted without achieving acceptable results . However , much better results were achieved when tests to separate photons in time were performed ( Lidke et al . , 2005 ) . This advanced technology was named ‘pointillism’ , after the famous painting technique , and is based on the usage of photoactivatable or photoswitchable dyes . By reducing the number of molecules emitting in a specific region of the specimen , at a given time , the probability of signals overlapping is greatly reduced ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Hess et al . , 2006 ; Rust et al . , 2006 ) . The two best known technologies that arose from pointillism are the ‘stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy’ ( STORM ) ( Rust et al . , 2006 ) and ‘photo - activation localization microscopy’ ( PALM ) ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 1 . 8 B ) . The difference between PALM and STORM classically lies in the type of probe used . PALM exploits the advantages of genetically encoded proteins fused to a photoactivatable tag , whereas STORM takes advantage of antibodies labelled with reporter dyes that can be activated or inactivated in turn , or just spontaneously switch between bright and dark states . However , the two approaches can be combined , generating for example , a two colour acquisition system where one protein candidate is tagged with a photoactivatable protein and the second one is labelled with a metastable secondary antibody . This is a conjugated secondary antibody where the fluorophore , supplied with enzymes , is able to catalyse the change between dark and bright states and appropriate energy ( in the form of laser wave length ) spontaneously blink ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . For both PALM and STORM , images are acquired by modulating laser wave - lengths through a shutter , activating only a small subset of molecules in the specimen at a time . Next , prior to the acquisition of the signal of another group of molecules , the signals are turned off by irradiation with a different laser wave - length Chapter 1 : Introduction 54 or simply due to oscillations to a dark state . The process is repeated , acquiring several hundreds of frames per structure of interest ( Sengupta et al . , 2012 ) . High resolution images are obtained by reconstructing the entire set of molecule positions related to one focal plane , by applying a gaussian fitting and incorporating them into a density map . The resolution obtained is dependent on the accuracy of the localization of each fluorescent molecule , labelling density and the biological structure itself . Results are generally more reliable when a long and thin object is analysed rather then a globular and dense one . Each mode of microscopy carries its own pros and cons . For example the preparation of samples for 3D - SIM is relatively simple and follows standard protocols for indirect immunofluorescence , however one limitation is the small improvement in resolution compared with other super - resolution microscopy techniques . In contrast , PALM / STORM allow a resolution of $ 30 nm to be achieved , however , for these methods , preparation of samples is more complex and restricted by the chemical properties of the probes . Accurate single molecule localization achieved by PALM has been employed in one attempt to study centromere chromatin structure ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 55 Figure 1 . 8 . Overview of super - resolution imaging methods applied in cell biology . A . Diagram representing size and shape of ‘point spread function’ ( PSF ) in STED , 3D - SIM and PALM / STORM . On the top of the diagram , values indicating the resolution achieved in x , y and z using each method are shown . B . Schematic illustration of sample illumination and signal detector used for each technique . In STED , an excitation laser scans the specimen followed by a ‘doughnut’ shaped STED , which takes back to ground level the excitation of peripheral molecules , overall reducing the PSF . A photomultiplier tube ( PMT ) or avalanche photodiodes ( APD ) detectors are used . In the case of SIM and 3D - SIM , conventional wide - field illumination is coupled to grating filtering of the light , creating a moiree fringe shadowing effect . After acquiring images where the grating was rotate of different degrees , the super - resolution image of the sample is generated by a mathematical reconstruction of dark and bright areas . Here , charge - coupled devices ( CCD ) are used for signal detection . PALM / STORM uses wide - field illumination and charge - coupled devices ( CCD ) for signal detection . Adapted from ( Schermelleh et al . , 2010 ) . Chapter 1 : Introduction 56 1 . 4 . 2 . 1 Use of PALM / STORM microscopy as a tool to analyse kinetochore structure Recently , single - molecule fluorescence techniques have been applied to the study of inner kinetochore chromatin structure and composition in chicken cells ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . Here , CENP - A molecules were tagged with the protein Dronpa ( Ando et al . , 2004 ; Habuchi et al . , 2005 ) , which is activated ( bright ) or inactivated ( dark ) depending on the wave - length of the irradiating laser beam ( 488 and 405 nm respectively ) . To map the position of histone modifications relative to CENP - A , Alexa Fluor 647 secondary labelled antibody was used in presence of a ‘switching buffer’ that contains enzymes able to catalyse the change between dark and bright states at an appropriate wave length ( 633 nm ) ( see section 2 . 7 ) . This approach allowed the visualization of H3 nucleosomes in CENP - A chromatin fibers ( Figure 1 . 9 A ) . Results showed that H3 nucleosomes had the same pattern of distribution as CENP - T on centromere fibers , relative to CENP - A ( Figure 1 . 9 B ) . This suggested that a revision of the previous amphipathic model was required as it predicted a confinement of H3 to the inner side of the centrochromatin , which is incompatible with the pattern of distribution of CENP - T ( Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) . Therefore , the ‘boustrophedon’ model was proposed . This described the centromere as composed of a stack of layers of chromatin , where in each layer chromatin is folded in a sinusoidal pattern ( Figure 1 . 9 C ) . In this conformation , both CENP - A and H3 are present at the interface with inner kinetochore components and interact with CCAN members . In this study , the resolution achieved to determine single molecule position was approximately 37 nm . Chapter 1 : Introduction 57 Figure 1 . 9 .

Schematic representing the predicted boustrophedon model for inner kinetochore organization . DNA , including both CENP - A and H3 nucleosomes , is composed of a stack of layers , where chromatin folds into sinusoidal curves . On the external surface ( top view ) both CANP - A and H3 interact with CCAN components to direct and stabilise the kinetochore . Chapter 1 : Introduction 58 1 . 5 Aim of the project and experimental approach The purpose of this research is to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the hierarchies of kinetochore assembly and to further characterize the structure of the vertebrate kinetochore , uncovering novel relationships between different components . At present , the field is divided between support of one of two best established models : the amphipathic model or the boustrophedon model . With this study I hope to provide evidence supporting one of these two models . To achieve this aim different approaches will be used : 1 ) as this research will be focussed on the architecture of centromeric chromatin , methods for observing and measuring changes in its biophysical properties will need to be optimised . These include testing diverse sample preparations , procedures and microscopy methods , in order to identify the most suitable conditions to accomplish my aim ; 2 ) cell cycle related changes will be interrogated by measuring the stretching of centromeric chromatin of interphase and mitotic cells in vitro . For this , parental DT40 cell lines stably expressing GFP : CENP - A will be generated . Using conventional wide field fluorescence microscopy , stretched centromere fibers will be observed using GFP : CENP - A , before being measured and analysed using multi - peak algorithms to identify sub - populations of fibers ; 3 ) to better understand the role of individual CCAN members in stabilising the architecture of the centromeric chromatin , I will analyse stretched centromere fibers prepared from a range of cell lines depleted for salient proteins . Therefore , a selection of DT40 conditional knockout ( KO ) and deletion ( ! ) cell lines will be engineered to stably express GFP : CENP - A . Similarly with aim ( 2 ) , the length of unfolded GFP : CENP - A centromere fibers will be measured in the different cell lines . This will allow me to identify which CCAN components are required for the stable folding and rigid ultra - structure of the kinetochore in mitosis ; Chapter 1 : Introduction 59 4 ) the effects of the depletion of CCAN proteins required for the maintenance of kinetochore ultra - structure will also be analysed on stretched centromere fibers using super - resolution microscopy . The level of co - localization between Dronpa : CENP - A and CENP - R will be analysed by PALM following CENP depletion , as a tool to observe fine changes in distribution ; 5 ) finally , with the goal of identifying an additional contributor to kinetochore structure , maintenance or function , the novel kinetochore protein CENP - Z will be characterised .

The next morning the culture was diluted 1 : 200 with fresh LB , supplemented with 20 mM MgSO 4 , and incubated in a shaker at 37°C for 3 - 4 hours or until OD600 reaches 0 . 48 . The culture was transferred to 50 ml falcon tubes and cooled on ice for 10 minutes . Next , cells were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 7 minutes at 4°C in a pre - chilled rotor . Supernatant was discarded and the pellets resuspended in 20 ml of cold TfbI buffer ( Table 2 . 2 ) . Following a 5 minute incubation on ice , the bacteria was collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C . Supernatant was discarded and the pellets gently resuspended in 2 ml of cold TfbII ( Table 2 . 2 ) .

Bacteria were heat - shocked at 42°C for 42 seconds and then transferred into ice for two minutes . Next , the transformed bacteria were diluted in 900 µ l of LB broth and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in an orbital shaker . Cells were then centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 2 minutes and most of the supernatant was discarded . Transformed bacteria were resuspended in the remaining 100 µ l Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 62 before seeding onto LB agar plates , supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic ( kanamycin or ampicillin , both 50 µ g / ml ) , and then left to grow overnight in an incubator at 37°C .

The supernatant was discarded and pellet resuspended in 4 ml of Buffer P1 . Next 4 ml of Buffer P2 was added to this mixture . Bacterial cells were mixed in this lysis solution by inverting 4 - 6 times and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature . Next , 4ml of pre - chilled Buffer P3 was added and mixed by inverting 4 - 6 times . The lysate was poured into a QIAfilter Cartridge and left to incubate for 10 minutes . During this time , one HiSpeed Midi Tip was equilibrated by the addition of 4 ml of Buffer QBT ; the column was allowed to empty by gravity flow . By inserting a plunger into the QIAfilter Cartridge clear cell lysate was filtered into the equilibrated HiSpeed Midi Tip . Lysate was allowed to enter the resin by gravity flow . 2 washes of 10 ml of Buffer QC were applied , followed by DNA elution with 5 ml of Buffer QF . Obtained DNA was precipitated by adding 3 . 5 ml of isopropanol , mixed and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature .

Samples were analysed by the GenePool Sequencing Facility ( The University of Edinburgh ) and the chromatograms examined with the free software ApE ( A Plasmid Editor ) . 2 . 2 . 5 Constructs used in this thesis The GFP : GgCENP - A ( Gg : Gallus gallus ) construct was obtained by cloning GgCENP - A into the pEGFPC1 vector ( Clontech ) with the addition of a 17 amino acid linker ( Ribeiro et al . , 2009 ) . The Dronpa : GgCENP - A construct was obtained by swapping the GFP of the construct described above , with cDNA coding for Dronpa . This construct was a kind gift from Dr Jennifer Lippincott - Schwartz . Human cDNA of CENP - Z ( isoform b ) was recombined , using the Gateway system into a pDEST3 . 2NGFP by Dr Laura Wood , and subsequently ligated into a TetR - EYFP vector ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ) to perform tethering studies . 2 . 3 Biochemistry 2 . 3 . 1 Standard protein sample preparation For all experiments the number of cells / ml was calculated and an equal number of cells across the samples was collected in falcon tubes and centrifuged at 1300 x g for 5 minutes . Cells were washed once in ice - cold 1X PBS before lysis in 1X SB ( Table 2 . 1 ) supplemented with protease inhibitors ( cOmplete EDTA - free , Roche ) . Lysates were sonicated to shear genomic DNA and then boiled for 5 minutes at 95°C before storage at - 80°C . Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 64 2 . 3 . 2 Preparation of nuclei protein extracts For all experiments , an equal number of cells across the samples were collected in falcon tubes and centrifuged at 1300 x g for 5 minutes . Cells were washed twice in ice - cold 1X PBS . The PBS was removed and cells were resuspended in cold hypotonic buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 ; 2 mM MgCl 2 ; 25 mM KCl ; protease inhibitors ; 1 mM DTT ; 1 mM PMSF ) . 0 . 5 % NP - 40 was added to the cell suspension and mixed gently . Cell lysate was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 7 minutes at 4°C .

Nuclei were pelleted at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C . Supernatant was discarded and pelleted nuclei resuspended in an appropriate volume of 1X sample buffer . 2 . 3 . 3 SDS - PAGE Denaturing protein gel electrophoresis was carried out using the Tris - glycine buffer system previously described ( Laemmli et al . , 1978 ) . Polyacrylamide gels were prepared from a 30 % ( v / v ) acrylamide / bisacrylamide mixture ( Severn Biotech ) . Gels were assembled in a vertical electrophoresis apparatus ( BioRad ) . A 4X resolving gel solution containing 1 . 5 M Tris - HCl pH 8 . 8 was poured at the bottom of the apparatus . A 4X stacking gel solution containing 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 was placed on top of the resolving gel . Samples were loaded on the gels and run for 90 minutes at 100 V . Next , the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham GE ) at 250 mA constant for 2 hours or 30 mA constant overnight . Both electrophoresis and protein transfer were performed in a BioRad apparatus according to the manufacturer instructions and suitable buffers ( Table 2 . 1 ) . 2 . 3 . 4 Immunoblotting Membranes were washed abundantly in ddH 2 O and incubated in Ponceau Red ( Table 2 . 1 ) to check for protein transfer . Following Ponceau destaining ( Table 2 . 1 ) , membranes were blocked with 3 % low fat milk in 0 . 05 % PBS - Tween for 1 hour at room temperature on a rocking shaker . Blocking solution was removed and membranes incubated with primary antibody solution in 1 % low fat milk in 0 . 05 % Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 65 PBS - Tw for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C on a rocking shaker . Conditions and specifications of the primary antibodies used for membrane immunoblotting in this thesis are indicated in Table 2 . 3 . Membranes were washed three times in 0 . 05 % PBS - Tw for five minutes on a rocking shaker . Solutions of the appropriate secondary antibodies were prepared in 1 % low fat milk in 0 . 05 % PBS - Tw . Conditions and specifications of the secondary antibodies used for membrane immunoblotting in this thesis are indicated in Table 2 . 3 . Next , membranes were incubated 45 minutes at room temperature on a rocking shaker . Following generous washes with 0 . 05 % PBS - Tw and lastly with 1X PBS only were applied to the membranes for 5 minutes each on a rocking shaker . Labelled proteins were detected using the Li - Cor Odyssey system . 2 . 3 . 5 Affinity purification of CENP - Z protein fragments for antigen production Purification of human CENP - Z fragments from E . coli cells was done in collaboration with Dr Maria Alba Abad , who performed the initial cloning ( pEC - K - GST - 3C - CENPZ 79 - 153 , pEC - K - His - 3C - CENPZ 347 - 580 ) and supervised during initial steps of protein expression and purification . 2 . 3 . 5 . 1 GST 79 - 153 human CENP - Z The expression of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) tagged 79 - 153 human CENP - Z fragment was induced with IPTG ( 350 mM ) in a 6 L culture of E . coli BL21 Gold competent cells overnight at 18°C . The next morning , cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 ml of a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 400 mM NaCl , 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . Protease inhibitors ( cOmplete EDTA - free , Roche ) , DNase ( 10 µ g / ml , DN25 , Sigma ) and PMSF ( 1 mM ) were added to the cell lysate . From here onwards everything was performed at + 4°C or on ice . Next , sample was sonicated for 10 minutes ( 60 % Amp pulse , 1 ON , 1 OFF ) . The lysate was clarified by spinning down at 22000 rpm for 50 minutes at ( JLA rotor 25 . 50 , Beckman ultracentrifuge ) . Both pellet and supernatant were kept and 1 µ l of each sample was diluted in sample buffer and later loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel .

For each wash described , form here onwards , beads were resuspended in the indicated buffer and centrifuged . The supernatant was incubated with GSH beads for 3 hours . To remove proteins that could unspecifically bind to the GSH resin , beads were washed first with 350 ml of lysis buffer , next with 200 ml of high salt buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 M NaCl , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl , 2 mM ATP and 2 mM DTT ) and lastly with cleavage buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT ) . Cleavage was performed with the addition of protease 3C ( 1 mg / ml ) in the cleavage buffer overnight . The next day , elutions from the beads were collected through centrifugation cycles into cleavage buffer . Elutions were next checked for protein concentration . A polyacrylamide gel , where samples obtained during the purification were run , is shown in Figure 5 . 4 C . The elutions containing the purified protein were pooled together and the sample was concentrated by using cellulose concentrators ( Amicon concentrators 3 kDa , Millipore ) . The eluted and concentrated was aliquoted , snap - frozen and kept at - 80°C . 2 . 3 . 5 . 2 His 347 - 580 human CENP - Z The expression of poly - histidine ( His ) tagged 347 - 580 human CENP - Z fragment was induced with IPTG ( 350 mM ) in a 3 L culture of E . coli BL21 Gold competent cells overnight at 18°C . The next morning , cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 ml of a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 35 mM Imidazole and 2 mM " - mercaptoethanol . Protease inhibitors ( cOmplete EDTA - free , Roche ) , DNase ( 10 µ g / ml , DN25 , Sigma ) and PMSF ( 1 mM ) were added to the cell lysate . From here onwards everything was performed at + 4°C or on ice . Next , sample was sonicated for 10 minutes ( 60 % Amp pulse , 1 ON , 1 OFF ) . The lysate was clarified by spining down at 22000 rpm for 50 minutes ( JLA rotor 25 . 50 , Beckman ultracentrifuge ) . Pellet and supernatant were kept and 1 µ l of each sample was diluted in sample buffer and later loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel . A single 5 ml Ni - NTA HisTrap column ( GE Healthcare ) was washed with 50 ml of ddH 2 O . The supernatant was loaded onto the pre - equilibrated column ( flow speed 1 ml / minute ) . Flow - through was collected and 1 µ l was diluted in sample buffer and later loaded Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 68 onto a polyacrylamide gel . The column was next washed with 350 ml of lysis buffer , followed by 250 ml wash of a high salt buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1M NaCl , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl , 2 mM ATP , 35 mM Imidazole and 2 mM " - mercaptoethanol ) . Finally , His tagged protein elution was obtained by a 50 ml wash with elution buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 200 mM NaCl , 400 mM Imidazole and 2 mM " - mercaptoethanol . 10 elutions of 5 ml each were collected and checked for protein concentration . A polyacrylamide gel , where samples obtained during the purification were run , is shown in Figure 5 . 4 D . The elutions containing the purified protein were pooled together . Cleavage was performed overnight with the addition of protease 3C ( 1 mg / ml ) to the elutions and dialysis ( Spectra por 6 - 8 kDa cut - off ) against 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT . The next morning , the sample was concentrated by using cellulose concentrators ( Amicon concentrators 10 kDa , Millipore ) . The concentrated protein was aliquoted , snap - frozen and kept at - 80°C . 2 . 3 . 6 Antigen preparation for antibody production 800 µ g of purified 79 - 153 and 347 - 580 human CENP - Z fragments were loaded onto two 15 % polyacrylamide gels . After the run , the gels were stained with Aqueous Blue Comassie ( 0 . 1 % Comassie Brilliant Blue in 1X running buffer without SDS ) for 2 hours at room temperature . Gels were de - stained using ddH 2 O to allow the visualization of the bands . Images of the gels at this stage are shown in Figure 5 . 4 E and F . The bands excised using scalpels and frozen at - 80°C overnight in a 50 ml falcon tube . This step is essential for the de - hydration of the bands . The next morning , a bucket was filled with dry ice and a pestle and mortar were left to cool down . Gel bands were processed one by one . After taking one band out of the - 80°C freezer it was easily scraped off the falcon tube from frozen and it was possible to avoid frozen water . The band was placed in the mortar and liquid nitrogen was poured and left to evaporate . This step was repeated two times more . The band was ground to fine powder by using a pestle ( Figure 2 . 1 B ) . Liquid nitrogen was applied during the grinding to maintain the sample cold ( Figure 2 . 1 A ) . When the powder was fine enough to pass through a 25 G needle ( needle size used for animal immunization ) then the material was resuspended in 800 µ l of sterile D - PBS ( Gibco ) Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 69 aliquoted into 400 µ l for the first injection and two busters of 200 µ l each . This procedure was performed for both the antigens . Aliquots were snap frozen , kept at - 80°C and delivered at the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service ( Pentlands Science Park , Penicuik ) . Figure 2 . 1 .

Chicken DT40 cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Biosera ) , 1 % chicken serum ( Gibco ) and 1 % Penicillin / Streptomycin ( Gibco ) at 39°C in 5 % CO 2 . To deplete proteins , conditional knockout cell lines were treated with doxycycline ( BD Biosciences ) ( 500 ng / ml ) , added directly to the culture media ( CENP - C KO and CENP - H KO , 36 hours treatment ; CENP - I KO , 24 hours treatment ) . A high enrichment in mitotic cells ( > 90 % ) was obtained after 12 - 13 hours of nocodazole treatment ( 500 ng / ml ) . 2 . 4 . 2 Transient transfection in human cell lines HeLa Kyoto / HeLa 3 - 8 / 1C7 cells were seeded in 12 - well dishes on coverslips and grown up to 50 % confluency . On the day of the transfection 50 µ l of Optimem ( Gibco ) were mixed by vortex with 1 . 5 µ l of GeneJuice® ( Novagen ) transfection reagent in a 1 . 5 ml tube . The mixture was incubated for five minutes at room temperature . Next , 0 . 5 µ g of DNA was added and gently mixed by pipetting .

Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 74 Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 75 2 . 4 . 5 Cell vital counts using Trypan Blue DT40 cells were maintained at a concentration of 20 X 10 4 cells / ml at every dilution time . For cell counts experiments , 1 part of Trypan Blue was mixed with 1 part of cell suspension at room temperature . Trypan Blue is a colorant able to penetrate the cell membrane of dead cells while living cells would remain transparent . 10 µ l of cell suspension were used to count living cells using a haemocytometer . 2 . 5 Fixation procedures for microscopy In order to perform any fluorescence microscopy experiment , DT40 cells were seeded onto Concanavaline A ( Calbiochem ) ( ConA ) coated coverslips and left to adhere for two to three hours at 39°C prior to fixation . HeLa and 1C7 cells were seeded onto uncoated coverslips and allowed to grow for one day prior to fixation . ConA coated coverslips were obtained by dipping coverslips into 0 . 5 mg / ml ConA solution , washed with ddH 2 O and allowed to dry underneath UV light . 2 . 5 . 1 Paraformaldehyde fixation Cell media was discarded and coverslips were washed with pre - warmed 1X PBS . Next , cells were fixed with pre - warmed 4 % PFA ( 16 % Formaldehyde ( w / v ) methanol - free , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) diluted in 1X PBS for 10 minutes . Afterwards , coverslips were abundantly washed in 1X PBS to remove any trace of paraformaldehyde . Permeabilization was carried out by applying 0 . 3 % TritonX - 100 ( BioRad ) diluted in 1X PBS for 5 minutes . Cells were abundantly washed in 1X PBS prior to blocking . 2 . 5 . 2 Methanol fixation Cell media was discarded and coverslips were washed with pre - warmed 1X PBS . Next , cells were fixed and permeabilized using glacial methanol ( VWR ) for 10 Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 76 minutes at - 20°C . Before proceeding with the blocking step , coverslips were abundantly washed in 1X PBS . 2 . 5 . 3 Preparation of chromatin fibers in DT40 cells using TEEN buffer Cells were seeded onto ConA coated coverslips and left to adhere for two to three hours at 39°C . Next , the media was discarded and cells washed with warm D - PBS without calcium and magnesium ( Gibco ) . To obtain chromatin fibers , hypotonic TEEN solution ( Table 2 . 1 ) was used to swell the cells . Additionally , because of the presence of EDTA , cations are sequestered causing repulsive forces amongst the negative charges present on the DNA and triggering the release of the DNA into thin chromatin fibers . To uniformly stretch fibers in one direction coverslips were maintained in a vertical position in coplin jars for 30 minutes at RT . Coverslips were then quickly dried by placing 3MM filter paper at the bottom edge of each coverslip before being immersed into 4 % PFA ( 16 % Formaldehyde ( w / v ) methanol - free , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) diluted in TEEN solution for 10 minutes at room temperature . Coverslips were washed several times in D - PBS . Finally , DNA was stained with Hoechst ( 2 µ g / ml ) for 5 minutes at room temperature in the dark . Coverslips were mounted onto slides using Vectashield ( Vector ) mounting media and sealed with nail varnish .

After fixation , samples were blocked in 3 % BSA ( 30 % BSA solution , Sigma ) diluted in 1X PBS . Primary antibodies were diluted in 1 % BSA ( 30 % BSA solution , Sigma ) in PBS and used at the concentrations indicated in Table 2 . 6 . Washes between primary and secondary antibodies were performed with 0 . 1 % PBS - Tw as described ( 2 . 6 . 1 ) . Primary antibodies were detected using Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody , used at a dilution of 1 : 20 , 000 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature . Three washes with 0 . 1 % PBS - Tw , of five minutes each , were performed . Following the immuno - staining , coverslips were inserted into imaging chambers ( Grace Bio Labs ) containing ‘switching buffer’ : 0 . 5 mg / ml glycose oxidase , 40 µ g / ml catalase , 10 % w / v glucose ( Fisher Scientific ) , in D - PBS pH 7 . 4 ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . The switching buffer allows blinking of Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody when exposed to a far - red wave length laser ( 633 nm ) and , in addition , it reduces photo - bleaching of the sample . The presence of the switching buffer does not affect the blinking properties of protein Dronpa that passes from a bright state into a dark state as a consequence of irradiation with lasers of different wave length ( 405 nm and 488 nm respectively ) . The imaging chambers used are designed to fit a specially adapted , anti - drift , microscope stage . The samples were analysed using a 60X TIRF oil - immersed objective ( Nikon ) , NA 1 . 49 , achieving a pixel size of 74 nm . The objective was mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope . Movies were captured using an Andor Luca S electron - multiplying CCD camera . 500 frames were collected for each sample and saved as . sif files . The acquisition of green and red signals were separated and therefore two . sif files were generated for each fiber . In order to correct for photo - chromatic shift aberrations multi - fluorescent Tetra Speck microspheres ( Invitrogen ) were used and imaged in one single frame at 488 and 633 nm wave lengths . Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 81 2 . 8 Bio - informatics and data analyses 2 . 8 . 1 CENP - Z protein sequence analysis Human CENP - Z ( ZNF276 ) protein sequence was found in NCBI ( gene ID : 92822 ) and in Uniprot ( Q8N554 ) . This sequence was next imported into Jalview ( Waterhouse et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , sequences of MmCENP - Z , GgCENP - Z and XlCENP - Z were also imported and conserved residues highlighted in different shades of blue ( Figure 5 . 1 A ) . Human CENP - Z protein secondary structure was obtained using Psi - pred ( Jones , 1999 ) , a platform for secondary structure prediction . Here , CENP - Z sequence was submitted and results were received within a few hours ( Figure 5 . 1 B ) . Human CENP - Z protein domain in - depth analysis was performed using PHYRE2 protein folding recognition server ( Kelley et al . , 2015 ) . CENP - Z protein sequence was imported into PHYRE2 server and here different domains recognised in the sequence were identified and their folding predicted . In addition , a comparison of known structures , with similar folding , was performed and results indicated the percentage of identity between CENP - Z sequence and the known protein and the percentage of confidence for the prediction ( see section 5 . 2 . 1 and Figure 5 . 1 B ) . 2 . 8 . 2 PALM data analysis Sif files ( . sif ) , each containing 500 frames of data per sample , were imported into Igor Pro ( WaveMetrics ) . The software provides the user with an interface where it is possible to make adjustments for the standard deviation of the point spread function ( PSF ) of the objects imaged and to adjust the GLRT - based ( generalized likelihood ratio test ) sensitivity , allowing the user to visualize which particles are detected in the specimen ( yellow circles ) ( Figure 2 . 3 A ) . At this point , the analysis was launched and particle positions identified . The results of particle position identification can be visualised as a 2D scatter plot where a coloured coded percentage of the number of fluorescent signals , detected in a particular position , is shown ( Figure 2 . 3 B ) . Positions of the detected signals are organised as a set of coordinates in X and Y . This set of coordinates can be accessed in Igor Pro and Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 82 copied and pasted into a GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , Inc ) spread sheet . Here coordinates are plotted into a graph and corrected for the photo - chromatic shift aberrations measured between green and red channel using multi - fluorescent Tetra Speck microspheres ( Invitrogen ) , by subtracting a delta distance . A representative graph produced in GraphPad is shown in Figure 2 . 4 A , left panel . For this analysis it is essential to minimise , if not eliminate , all sample drifting , as this would impair the accuracy of localization measurements within the specimen . Therefore , the acquisition system used was tested for sample drifting by measuring signals of multi - fluorescent Tetra Speck microspheres in unperturbed or perturbed conditions ( Figure 2 . 4 B ) . Unperturbed conditions are the standard conditions for data acquisition used for this type of experiment . Perturbed conditions were obtained by gently tapping on the microscope stage during the acquisition . If the sample moves during data acquisition ( perturbed stage ) a smear of colour is observed in the 2D scatter plot indicating a shift in the position of the same molecule ( Figure 2 . 4 B ) . In contrast , acquiring signals following the standard procedure ( unperturbed stage ) did not show drifting of the Tetra Speck beads . It can be seen from a representative 2D scatter plot derived from a cellular sample ( Figure 2 . 4 A , right panel ) that measurements performed according to standard conditions are accurate , as no drifting in the samples was detected .

Red arrows indicate the parameters ( standard deviation of the PSF ; GLRT sensitivity ) adjusted during the analysis .

Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 85 2 . 8 . 3 Igor Pro and multi - peak analysis of stretched centromere fibers data - sets Fiber unfolding measurements were imported into Igor Pro ( Figure 2 . 5 , 1 ) where the data were divided into an appropriate number of histogram bins ( see sections 4 . 2 . 2 and 4 . 2 . 4 ) . The multi - peak fitting 2 package was used for peak identification . Here , the software allows the user to adjust parameters such as noise level , smooth fraction and minimal fraction in order to identify the peaks ( Figure 2 . 5 , 2 ) . All parameters within specific ranges were kept constant across all samples : noise level 0 . 00005 - 0 . 06 ; smooth fraction 0 . 05 - 2 . 5 ; minimal fraction 0 . 035 - 0 . 5 . At this point the software predicts whether the peaks identified are Gaussian , Lorentzian or Voigt . Once the peaks have been identified , the multi - peak fitting ( Figure 2 . 5 , 3 ) and results were summarized into a table containing information about peak location , area , type and amplitude ( Figure 2 . 5 , 4 ) . Also , a line of best fit is shown in the graphs containing data represented as histograms . Parameters such as chi - squired value and residuals were also returned in order to assess the reliability of the analysis . A detailed discussion of such parameters will be presented in the discussion of Chapter 4 . Chapter 2 : Materials and Methods 86 Figure 2 . 5 . Performing multi - peak analysis using Igor Pro . Representative screen - shot image of Igor Pro while performing multi - peak analysis . Data is copied into a spread sheet ( 1 ) and divided into an appropriate number of histogram bins . Next , multi - peak fitting 2 package is opened and parameters adjusted for peak identification ( 2 ) . By pressing on the ‘Do Fit’ button ( 3 ) the fitting runs and results are organised into a table ( 4 ) .

Fibers were prepared as described in 2 . 5 . 3 up until the point of fixation . 2 . 9 . 2 CLEM processing Fibers were fixed for 1 hour with 3 % glutaraldehyde and 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 2 M cacodylate buffer containing 5 µ g / mL Hoechst . Cells were washed with 1X PBS ( 3 washes of 5 minutes ) and the last PBS wash was left on . Unfolded fibers were identified using a wide field fluorescence DeltaVision microscope ( Applied Precision ) where GFP tagged CENP - A highlighted centromeres on DNA fibers visualized by Hoechst staining . Transmitted light was used to map cell positions via etched coordinates . The reference images allowed for the correlative re - identification of cells of interest by electron microscopy . DeltaVision acquisition was followed by treatment with tannic acid ( 0 . 1 % in water ) for 20 minutes , followed by osmication ( 1 % osmium tetroxide in PBS ) for 1 hour . Samples were then washed with PBS ( 3 washes of 5 minutes ) , ddH2O ( 2 washes of 20 minutes ) and 30 % ethanol ( 1 wash of 10 minutes ) before the incubation in uranyl acetate ( 0 . 5 % in 30 % ethanol ) for 1 hour . Next , cells were dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol washes followed by 2 washes of 10 minutes with 100 % ethanol . Following dehydration , cells were infiltrated with ethonal : resin mixtures ( 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 ) for 20 minutes each . Finally , cells were embedded in 100 % resin ( TAAB ) , with a gelatin capsule of resin covering the cells of interest , before curing at 60 ° C for 3 days . Polymerised resin blocks were sectioned and post stained as routine . Samples were viewed using a Phillips CM120 BioTwin transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) and micrographs acquired using a Gatan Orius CCD camera ( Gatan ) . Chapter 3 : Results 88 3 Chapter 3 : DNA unfold ing : a high resolution tool to resolve protein localization onto chromatin 3 . 1 Introduction Since 1839 , it has been possible to visualize and study individual cells by microscopy ( Schwann , 2013 ) . With advances in technology , not only cells but also subcellular components have been detected and therefore further studied ( Verdaasdonk et al . , 2014 ) . One obstacle that cell biology and imaging technologies are trying to overcome is how to assess whether two proteins truly co - localize . To overcome this , three issues need to be addressed : 1 ) diffraction limit of the optics in use ; 2 ) resolving complex structures ( i . e . compact globular structures ) ; 3 ) development of a computational system for data analysis ( i . e . choice of suitable software ) . The purpose of this Ph . D . project was to study the ultrastructure of the kinetochore , taking advantage of the most suitable microscopy procedures . Before this could be achieved the best method for data acquisition , given the time and equipment available , needed to be explored . Therefore two diverse approaches have been attempted : conventional wide - field light microscopy and super - resolution light microscopy . Conventional light microscopy exploits the properties of fluorescent molecules , where a typical standardized wide - field system can achieve a maximum resolution of $ 250 nm ; therefore any structures or distances smaller than 250 nm cannot be accurately measured . More recently , new microscopy techniques have been developed which are grouped into the category of “super - resolution” microscopy ( Flors and Earnshaw , 2011 ; Schermelleh et al . , 2010 ) . Here the illumination coupled with improved , genetically engineered , fluorescent molecules , reduces the resolution limit from 250 nm to 100 or 30 nm in x and y , depending on the specific technique used ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Dickson et al . , 1997 ; Hell and Wichmann , 1994 ) . Unfortunately , a caveat with such high resolution equipment is that these systems are often not suitable for high throughput screenings as the Chapter 3 : Results 89 acquisition time can be long and thus acquisition of an appropriate N number for statistical purposes is extremely time consuming . The focus of this study is to analyse centromere chromatin , wrapped into the kinetochore , which has a compact structure . Therefore , both high resolution imaging and large sample size for statistical analyses were essential . An indirect solution would be to modify the centromere chromatin structure in order to increase its dimensions so that even conventional microscopy would be useful on such samples . One way to do this is to extend the chromatin into what are known as DNA fibers . In this chapter developing protocols for fiber stretching preparation , on both human and chicken cells , will be presented . The development of such protocols was essential for carrying out further studies on the kinetochore ultrastructure . The second part of this chapter describes both internal and external collaborations where I applied my optimised protocols to answer biological questions , whilst also becaming proficient at localizing proteins or histone modifications on stretched kinetochore chromatin fibers . Here , I used conventional wide - field microscopy or Photo - Activation Localization Microscopy , PALM . The technical experience gained by performing these techniques was essential for addressing my core research questions in later chapters . Chapter 3 : Results 90 3 . 2 Results 3 . 2 . 1 Optimizating the preparation of stretched centromere DNA fibers Independently from the microscopy method used , the generation of stretched chromatin fibers was an important prerequisite for my project to achieve the maximal resolution possible ( Weier , 2001 ) . Therefore protocols for the preparation of chromatin fibers were optimised in cell types commonly used in the laboratory . DT40 cells are a commonly used cell line in many laboratories . DT40 cells are a chicken B - lymphoma cell line that shows several advantages , such as high homologous recombination efficiency and rapid doubling time ( 9 - 10 hours ) . DT40 cells also have a highly stable karyotype ( Takata et al . , 1998 ) . As a preliminary test , control DT40 cells ( clone 18 ) stably expressing GFP : CENP - A ( 2 . 4 . 4 ) were used for a quick identification of the centromere region . To test that GFP : CENP - A localised to centromeres , cells left to adhere on conA coated coverslips , were fixed in 4 % PFA and DNA counterstained with DAPI . Representative images were acquired showing that GFP : CENP - A localised , as expected , in focused GFP spots on centromeres in mitotic chromosomes , and showed the typical centromere localization in interphase ( Figure 3 . 1 A ) . Next , my aim was to perform high - resolution studies by stretching kinetochore fibers . To stretch chromatin in DT40 cells TEEN buffer was used ( 10 mM Triethanolamine : HCl pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA ) as previously described ( Earnshaw and Laemmli , 1983 ; Hudson et al . , 2003 ) . TEEN buffer contains EDTA that functions as a divalent cation chelator and has a low salt concentration , creating a hypotonic environment . Osmotic pressure together with the excess of negative charges triggers cell lysis and ultimately causes the chromatin to unfold ( Figure 3 . 1 B ) . This protocol was tested in samples as follows : cells were left to adhere to conA coated coverslips for two hours , before one wash in PBS 1X . Next , coverslips were dipped vertically into TEEN buffer for 30 minutes and then fixed in 4 % PFA diluted in TEEN ( Figure 3 . 1 C , method 2 . 5 . 3 ) ; DNA was counterstained with Hoechst diluted in ddH 2 O at room temperature . The protocol was tested and successfully reproduced in DT40 cells Chapter 3 : Results 91 stably expressing GFP : CENP - A . Representative fibers with stretched centromeres obtained with this protocol are shown in Figure 3 . 1 D . Chapter 3 : Results 92 Figure 3 . 1 . Optimisation of TEEN buffer protocol for chromatin stretching in DT40 cells . A . Representative images of DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A used to test and optimise the protocol .

Centromere regions were identified by the localization pattern observed for the GFP signal ( green ) . Scale bar , 5 µ m . B . Schematic summarising the mechanism of action of TEEN buffer . The low salt concentration of the buffer generates an osmotic movement of solvent from outside to inside the cells causing cell lysis ; in addition , EDTA is an efficient cation chelator , sequestering positive charges from the surroundings . As a consequence , negative charges present on the DNA repel each other and DNA stretches in an unconfined environment . C . Diagram of the experimental protocol used as described in 2 . 5 . 3 . D . Examples of fibers obtained performing the protocol illustrated in C . 60 % confluent DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A attached to conA coated coverslips were fixed and dipped vertically into TEEN buffer for 30 minutes .

In the inset , an unfolded centromere ( green ) is shown at higher magnification . Chapter 3 : Results 93 Chapter 3 : Results 94 3 . 2 . 2 A comparison of intact cells versus chromatin fibers Having selected a model system compatible with stretching of chromatin , the next aim was to examine to what extent the sample preparation could affect the level of resolution achieved during data acquisition , particularly on a compact structure such as the chromatin inside a kinetochore . This step was essential in order to decide how to proceed in further experiments . DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A were used for this test . Cells were either fixed for standard microscopy ( 2 . 5 . 1 ) or processed for fiber preparation ( 2 . 5 . 3 ) . To assess whether it was possible to obtain enough resolution after stretching DNA fibers , samples were probed with anti histone H3 tri - methylated ( me3 ) on lysine 9 ( K9 ) ( H3K9me3 ) . Nucleosome octamers , in addition to H2A , H2B and H4 , also contain either H3 or CENP - A , the centromere variant of H3 , but not both ( Luger et al . , 1997 ; Richmond et al . , 1984 ; Warburton et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore H3 and CENP - A should never directly co - localise . After image acquisition using a conventional wide - field light microscopy system ( DeltaVision RT , Applied Precision ) . ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) was used to perform line - scan analysis of the signals of GFP : CENP - A and H3K9me3 . In the case of intact cells , H3K9me3 and GFP : CENP - A showed a clear co - localization , as underlined by the line - scan plots , where the majority of the peak of CENP - A ( blue curve ) overlapped with the peak of H3K9me3 ( green curve ) ( Figure 3 . 2 A ) . This was observed in both interphase and mitotic samples . In addition , H3K9me3 signal was present on centromeres but , as expected , was also extended to pericentromeric chromatin ( Figure 3 . 2 A , enlarged IF insets ) . In contrast , on stretched chromatin fibers H3K9me3 peaks of fluorescence intensities rarely overlap with the peaks of fluorescence intensities of GFP : CENP - A . When CENP - A showed a peak , there was a corresponding decrease in the histone mark and vice versa ( Figure 3 . 2 B ) . This demonstrates the presence of H3 in between CENP - A nucleosomes . This result was in agreement with previously published data where the authors showed this typical alternated pattern between CENP - A and H3K9me3 after centromere stretching ( Jin et al . , 2008 ; Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ; Yan et al . , 2005 ) .

Thin yellow lines were drawn beside unfolded centromeres whose fluorescence was measured in the line - scans using ImageJ software . On the x axis of the plot is represented distance expressed in pixels whilst on the y is a measurement of fluorescence intensity . CENP - A and H3K9me3 fluorescence peaks are traced by a blue and a green curve respectively . Intact cells showed overlap between CENP - A and H3K9me3 signals in both interphase and mitosis , whereas stretched centromere fibers revealed an alternate pattern of either CENP - A or H3K9me3 signals . Chapter 3 : Results 96 Chapter 3 : Results 97 To study the ultra - structure of the kinetochore in human cells , it was next considered whether TEEN buffer protocol for chromatin stretching would work in HeLa cells . HeLa is a common human cell line derived from a cervical cancer biopsy and is routinely used in research laboratory practises . As HeLa cells are cancerous , they do not differentiate , their doubling time is approximately 24 hours and their transfection efficiency is high compared with other cell lines . HeLa cells were left to adhere onto coverslips for 24 hours before proceeding with the fiber stretching protocol . Cells were then washed with PBS 1X . Next , TEEN buffer treatment was performed for up to one hour , followed by fixation with 4 % PFA diluted in TEEN buffer ( Figure 3 . 3 A ) . A panel of different conditions was tested ( Figure 3 . 3 B ) . Chromatin stretching was performed with TEEN buffer either alone or in the presence of non - ionic detergents , dissolved in TEEN buffer , at the concentration of 0 . 1 % v / v ( Figure 3 . 3 B ) . No chromatin stretching was observed in HeLa cells after treatment with TEEN buffer alone ( Figure 3 . 3 C1 ) . Therefore , the same protocol was repeated with TEEN buffer supplemented with the detergents in Figure 3 . 3 B . Results showed no reproducible high quality stretched chromatin when TEEN was added with 0 . 1 % v / v of TritonX - 100 or Octyl - " - D - maltopyranoside ( Figure 3 . 3 C2 and C3 ) . In contrast , treatment with 0 . 1 % v / v Decyl - " - D - maltopyranoside in TEEN buffer showed successful chromatin stretching in HeLa cells ( Figure 3 . 3 C4 ) . However , although using this method stretched chromatin fibers were generated , the quality of the stretching was poor compared with the results obtained previously in DT40 cells , and the samples showed a high degree of heterogeneity regarding the levels of chromatin stretching . In conclusion , an analysis of protein co - localization was performed on both intact cells and stretched chromatin fibers using a light wide - field system . Results confirmed that centromere chromatin fibers provided a better resolution for centromere measurement compared to intact cells . Unfortunately , the same gentle method for chromatin stretching was not as efficient in human cells , where despite the addition of detergents to TEEN buffer , a lower level of chromatin stretching was observed .

The data collected has been included as part of a main text figure in a manuscript currently under review at the JCB ( Molina et al . , 2015 ) . The project aims to study the effects of the removal of H3K4me2 from kinetochore chromatin on the maintenance of a functional centromere that allows a faithful chromosome segregation . To do so , a Human Artificial Chromosome , the alphoid tetO HAC system , previously used in our laboratory , has been further exploited ( Bergmann et al . , 2012 ; Bergmann et al . , 2011 ; Cardinale et al . , 2009 ; Nakano et al . , 2008 ) . In this system , a synthetic array of cloned ! - satellite monomers containing alternating tetracycline operators ( TetO ) and CENP - B boxes were introduced into HT1080 cells ( Kouprina et al . , 2012 ; Nakano et al . , 2008 ) to generate the alphoid tetO HAC . 1C7 is a hybrid cell line derived from the fusion of the original HT1080 cell line that carried the alphoid tetO HAC , with HeLa cells . Resultant 1C7 cells were still carrying the HAC and in addition , they were growing faster and were more efficiently transfected ( Cardinale et al . , 2009 ) compared to the original HT1080 cells . TetR - EYFP fusion proteins were transfected into 1C7 cells where they were specifically tethered to the TetO sequence present in the alphoid tetO HAC . This system allows us to tether different chromatin modifiers to the alphoid tetO HAC for studying the epigenetic landscape of the centromere . Importantly , the alphoid tetO HAC is visualised as a fluorescent spot ( from the EYFP ) in transfected interphase nuclei . Some authors had reported the presence of RNApolIIS2 P on centromeres in metaphase spreads ( Chan et al . , 2012 ) and , more recently , on stretched centromere chromatin fibers ( Quenet and Dalal , 2014 ) . Although these studies demonstrated the presence of RNApolIIS2 P at centromeres , no evidence of RNApolIIS2 P at the kinetochore domain , where CENP - A is present , was reported . My role in this project was to study whether the active elongating RNA polymerase II , which is phosphorylated at the serine 2 of its CTD tail ( RNApolIIS2 P ) ( Komarnitsky et al . , Chapter 3 : Results 101 2000 ; Morris et al . , 2005 ) , is specifically present at the kinetochore domain of the centromere . The development of a method to obtain better stretching of chromatin fibers in human cells was required in order to perform high resolution co - localization studies . A successful protocol to obtain stretched chromatin fibers in mitotic human cells was performed as follows ( 2 . 5 . 4 ) . Mitotic 1C7 cells were harvested through mitotic shake - off following metaphase arrest with colcemid ( 100 ng / ml for 3 hours ) . Next , samples were incubated for 10 minutes with 75 mM KCl buffer at 37°C causing hypotonic swelling , and then cytospun onto polylysine coated slides . Finally , slides were immersed into a lysis buffer ( Figure 3 . 4 A ) , whose composition is indicated in section 2 . 5 . 4 . A representative image of stretched chromatin fibers , generated with this protocol is shown in Figure 3 . 4 B . Next , immunofluorescence staining for both CENP - C , as a kinetochore reference , and RNApolIIS2 P was performed as described in 2 . 5 . 1 and 2 . 6 . 1 . With this protocol , stretched mitotic kinetochore fibers were obtained , shown by DAPI staining ( Figure 3 . 4 C ) . Fiber images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope , deconvolved and processed for fluorescence intensity line - scan analysis using ImageJ software . Fluorescence intensities of CENP - C and RNApolIIS2 P were detected along DNA fibers , recognised by DAPI staining , and plotted together as shown in the representative plot in Figure 3 . 4 C . Results demonstrated an average frequency of co - localization between CENP - C and RNApolIIS2 P of 66 . 73 % , whereas the remaining 33 . 27 % of RNApolIIS2 P signal was found extended in the regions flanking the kinetochore ( Figure 3 . 4 C ; n = 10 ) . After testing the presence of the elongating RNA polymerase in native kinetochores we wanted to test whether RNApolIIS2 P was also present on the alphoid tetO HAC kinetochore . In order to do so , it was not enough to perform a normal transfection followed by fiber protocol , as the presence of detergent in the lysis buffer washed away the tethered TetR - EYFP ( data not shown ) . Therefore , an alternative solution for detecting the HAC was found . In a joint effort with Dr Jeyaprakash Arulanandam’s laboratory TetR - EYFP protein was expressed in E . coli BL21 Gold competent cells and purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni - NTA Chapter 3 : Results 102 column ( GE Healthcare ) . To test the in vitro binding efficiency of the purified TetR - EYFP , chromosome spreads were prepared 2 . 5 . 5 . TetR - EYFP was added to chromosome spread samples , diluted in a blocking solution without Tween20 or any detergent ( 2 . 6 . 2 ) . The alphoid tetO HAC was successfully detected by the presence of EYFP as illustrated in Figure 3 . 4 D ( arrow ) . Next , chromatin fibers were stretched and incubated with the TetR - EYFP purified protein , ensuring that no detergent was added to any washing solution . Results showed that performing such protocol allowed the binding between TetR and TetO to be preserved also on chromatin fibers ( Figure 3 . 4 E ) . Having optimised conditions for alphoid tetO HAC detection onto stretched chromatin fibers , an experiment to look at the kinetochore domain of the alphoid tetO HAC was designed . Mitotic fibers were prepared and probed with anti CENP - C and anti RNApolIIS2 P antibodies . Afterwards , following secondary antibody labelling , an in - situ tethering of the TetR - EYFP was performed , thereby allowing the detection of the alphoid tetO HAC on kinetochore fibers . Results showed co - localization of RNApolIIS2 P and CENP - C on the alphoid tetO HAC ( TetR - EYFP signal ) in 60 % of the fibers analysed ( Figure 3 . 4 F ; n = 32 , three independent experiments ) . In summary , a new and more efficient protocol for stretching chromatin fibers in human cells was successfully optimised . This protocol overcame the limitation of stretching chromatin fibers observed with the former protocol ( section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . Results demonstrated that the RNApolIIS2 P was present on the alphoid tetO HAC in a similar frequency in which RNApolIIS2 P was detected in endogenous metaphase chromosomes ( $ 60 % ) . This finding lead to further experiments performed by Dr Molina in order to analyse the role of RNApolIIS2 P on maintaining active kinetochores . This was made possible by a new method for in - situ tethering using purified TetR - EYFP ( Molina et al . , 2015 ) . Chapter 3 : Results 103 Figure 3 . 4 .

Chapter 3 : Results 104 Chapter 3 : Results 105 3 . 2 . 4 Microscopy localization study of H4K20me1 : novel centromere signature The epigenetic nature of the centromere is widely recognised and accepted ( Karpen and Allshire , 1997 ; Shang et al . , 2013 ) . As DNA sequence is not a unique definer of the centromere , greater importance is currently attributed to the presence of CENP - A and modification signature of the other core histones ( Ruthenburg et al . , 2007 ) . Although several studies have been focused on the identification of these modifications at centromeres , it is still unclear which are the minimum epigenetic requirements to generate and maintain a functional centromere . The histone H4 N - terminus tail modifications were early identified in 1969 ( DeLange et al . , 1969 ) . On lysine 20 of histone H4 , three methylation states are possible : mono - , di - and tri - methylation ( Kouzarides , 2007 ) . Methyltransferase enzymes are responsible for controlling the methylation levels on H4K20 in a cell cycle dependent manner ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) . Some of these enzymes have been shown to be involved in gene expression during early stages of development in Drosophila and mice and their loss causes lethality ( Karachentsev et al . , 2005 ; Oda et al . , 2009 ) . Beyond gene expression , the H4K20me1 mark is also involved in replication control ( Beck et al . , 2012 ; Tardat et al . , 2010 ) , whilst H4K20me2 / 3 take part in DNA double strand break ( DSB ) repair ( Fradet - Turcotte et al . , 2013 ; Pei et al . , 2011 ; Tang et al . , 2013 ) . Preliminary ChIP - seq data by Hori and colleagues identified an enrichment of H4K20me1 at the centromere of chromosome Z in chicken DT40 cells . My task in the project was to visualize H4K20me1 centromere localization by immunofluorescence in order to confirm the H4K20me1 localization using an alternative technique . My results confirmed the centromere localization of H4K20me1 and they were included into a paper recently published in Dev . Cell ( Hori et al . , 2014 ) . Initially , the localization of H4K20me1 was tested in DT40 intact cells . DT40 cells engineered to stably express GFP : CENP - A ( 2 . 4 . 4 ) were used in order to easily identify centromere regions . DT40 cells were left to adhere onto conA coated coverslips and fixed in 4 % PFA . Samples were incubated with anti H4K20me1 and Chapter 3 : Results 106 anti CENP - T antibodies and the distribution of the H4 modification was observed in every mitotic stage ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . The mono - methylation appeared ubiquitous in the chromatin ; the presence of a lower signal on compact chromosomes compared to interphase nuclei might be due to a problem of antigen accessibility of the antibody when the chromosomes are highly condensed . However , at the resolution achieved on intact cells , the predicted accumulation of H4K20me1 at centromeres could not be detected . Therefore , H4K20me1 localization was further tested on stretched chromatin fibers obtained using TEEN buffer ( 2 . 5 . 3 ; 3 . 2 . 1 ) . 60 % confluent coverslips were treated with TEEN buffer and subsequently fixed using 4 % PFA . Antibody incubation conditions were kept identical to the previous experiment . Examples of isolated centromere chromatin fibers are shown where an accumulation of H4K20me1 appeared evident ( Figure 3 . 6 A ) . To quantify the level of co - localization of GFP : CENP - A and H4K20me1 , the overlap of signal was measured using ImageJ ; the same quantitation performed between the signals of CENP - A and CENP - T was used as an internal control of the experiment , as CENP - A and CENP - T normally showed high degree of co - localization on chromatin fibers ( Figure 3 . 6 B , n = 5 ) . As expected , CENP - T largely co - localized with CENP - A ( 92 . 2 % ) . Although less than the control , a majority of H4K20me1 co - localized with CENP - A ( 63 . 2 % ) . To test for a relationship between fiber length and the level of co - localization of H4K20me1 signal with the centromere , data was integrated as a 2D plot ( Figure 3 . 6 C ) . Five fibers of different length that displayed H4K20me1 staining at the centromere were included in the analysis visualized as five columns ( dashed lines ) . No correlation between fiber length and percentage of co - localization between CENP - A and H4K20me1 was observed ( p = 0 . 083 ; Spearman’s test ) . To provide further support to this novel data , co - localization was also tested using Photo - Activation Localization Microscopy , PALM . PALM is a super - resolution microscopy technique based on single molecule sensitivity , which exploits the properties of blinking or photo - switchable fluorescent molecules . For this purpose , Dronpa in place of GFP was used to tag CENP - A and Alexa Fluor 647 Chapter 3 : Results 107 Figure 3 . 5 . H4K20me1 characterization by immunofluorescence in intact chicken cells . Representative immunofluorescence images of DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A . Confluent coverslips were fixed and probed with anti CENP - T and anti H4K20me1 antibodies .

C . 2D plot representing centromere fiber length ( x axis , µ m ) versus signal co - localization ( y axis , % ) . Data from five fibers is shown as five columns defined by dashed lines . In each column specific percentages of co - localization are shown accordingly to the legend . No correlation was observed between H4K20me1 centromere occupancy and stretched centromere fiber length ( p = 0 . 083 ; Spearman’s test ) . Chapter 3 : Results 109 Chapter 3 : Results 110 conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect H4K20me1 . Dronpa can ‘blink’ between bright and dark states when excited at 405 and 488 nm respectively . Alexa Fluor 647 switches between metastable bright and dark states after 633 nm irradiation in presence of a switching buffer that can catalyse the blinking . Previously generated cells expressing Dronpa : CENP - A ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) were seeded on conA coated coverslips ( n°1 . 5 thickness ) , this was important for sample visualization and acquisition as this thickness is optimal for the TIRF objective mounted on our PALM set - up . Samples were processed for chromatin fiber generation using TEEN buffer ( 2 . 5 . 3 , Figure 3 . 7 ) . After treatment with TEEN buffer and fixation in 4 % PFA , samples were probed with anti H4K20me1 antibody . Coverslips were next sealed into wet chambers where fibers were left incubating in switching buffer . On the day of the acquisition , lasers were manually aligned and put into TIRF . At the end of each session , signals from multi - fluorescent microspheres were acquired in order to correct for chromatic shift . The acquired movies were processed in Igor Pro 6 . 2 software for particle recognition . In Igor Pro , particles were assigned with coordinates that were subsequently entered in GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . Here , each coordinate point was corrected for the photo - chromatic shift and graphic representations of particle localization were generated . Fiber images acquired by PALM are shown in Figure 3 . 7 . This qualitative data supported my previous findings ( Figure 3 . 6 ) as co - localization between H4K20me1 and Dronpa : CENP - A was observed ( yellow regions , Figure 3 . 7 ) . Collectively , these results confirmed the presence of mono - methylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 at CENP - A chromatin in DT40 cells . Chapter 3 : Results 111 Figure 3 . 7 .

Coverslips were sealed into a wet chamber where the fibers were dipped into a switching buffer . This catalysed molecule blinking during laser irradiation . For each fiber , 500 frames were acquired in both channels and the movies were later processed through Igor Pro for particle recognition and coordinate assignment . Coordinates were imported in GraphPad where correction for photo - chromatic shift was applied and a graph generated .

Chapter 3 : Results 112 3 . 2 . 5 Confirmation of single , not multiple , fiber generation It has been considered that fibers generated and measured using protocols established during this chapter , may not be individual fibers , but rather , numerous fibers on top of one another . To confirm this is not the case CLEM analysis of stretched fibers was performed . DT40 cells expressing GFP : CENP - A were seeded into CLEM dishes ( 2 . 9 ) and fibers were prepared as in 2 . 5 . 3 . Typical fibers were then identified using a light microscope ( Figure 3 . 8 A ) before processing for EM ( 2 . 9 ) . The correlative EM analysis showed that individual fibers could be observed ( Figure 3 . 8 A ) . Remarkably , the thickness of these fibers correlated closely with the expected diameter of DNA - containing nucleosomes as measured by a pixel density line - scan analysis ( mean thickness of 13 nm , Figure 3 . 8 B ) .

Chapter 3 : Results 114 Chapter 3 : Results 115 3 . 3 Discussion and conclusion The purpose of the experiments described in this chapter was to gain experience in generating high quality DNA fibers in both human and chicken cells . Both model organisms are useful for different biological questions . I have also presented results from two different projects whose progress was dependent on the development of such methods . Firstly , I was able to reproduce the TEEN buffer protocol , previously established in the lab ( Hudson et al . , 2003 ) in order to obtain fibers in chicken cells ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . The same method however was not successful in human cells . Different adjustments were tested to disperse chromatin in fibers in human cells . The addition of non - ionic detergents such as TritonX - 100 , Octyl - " - D - maltopyranoside and Decyl - " - D - maltopyranoside to TEEN buffer produced a range of effects ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . Both TritonX - 100 and Octyl - " - D - maltopyranoside did not seem to dramatically alter DNA compaction , whereas treatment with Decyl - " - D - maltopyranoside induced chromatin fibers formation , but not at a highly reproducible standard ( Figure 3 . 3 C ) . The difference observed in the effects of TEEN buffer between chicken and human cells could be explained by the lipid composition of the nuclear membrane . Despite the shared presence of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol , chicken erythrocyte nuclear membrane presents more abundant phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin , whilst in human cells , the membrane also contains traces of phosphatidylserine , cardiolipin and cholesterol ( Kleinig et al . , 1971 ; van Meer and de Kroon , 2011 ) . DT40 , as previously described , are not erythrocyte cells , however a similar membrane composition could still be possible and offer an explanation for the results obtained with TEEN buffer . Those molecules could supply additional strength to human membranes resulting in tolerance to TEEN buffer . Indeed this difference in lipid composition could also explain why chicken cells cannot be transfected using standard lipid based transfection reagents but instead require electroporation . As the final goal of this doctorate was to study the centromere chromatin , wrapped up into the kinetochore , it was important from the initial stages of work , to establish a suitable protocol that would allow me to observe samples , in the best Chapter 3 : Results 116 possible conditions . With the aim of testing which was the most suitable sample preparation , H3K9me3 localization compared to CENP - A was analysed in both intact cells and chromatin fibers ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . Line - scan analysis on the images acquired from intact cells revealed that CENP - A and H3K9me3 were both present at kinetochores , where the peaks of the two signals were shifted apart of few pixels ( 2 pixels = 126 nm ) ( Figure 3 . 2 A ) . In contrast , the analysis of centromere fibers showed that signals of CENP - A and H3K9me3 had an alternating pattern in which a peak of CENP - A corresponded a lower level of H3 and viceversa ( Figure 3 . 2 B ) . This result is in agreement with previous mapping of H3K9me3 onto centromere fibers ( Blower et al . , 2002 ; Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ; Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) and validated the use of centromere fibers for future kinetochore chromatin studies . With the aim of obtaining fibers in human cells , we decided to use a protocol recently published where the dispersion of chromatin in the sample was enhanced by the use of cytospin , followed by incubation into a lysis buffer ( Quenet and Dalal , 2014 ) ( Figure 3 . 4 A ) . It was found that RNApolIIS2 P was present on 60 % of stretched kinetochores analysed , as highlighted by CENP - C signal ( Figure 3 . 4 C ) . This result was also confirmed on the kinetochore of alphoid tetO HAC ( Figure 3 . 4 F ) . These results constituted an important contribution to a manuscript currently under review in JCB ( Molina et al . , 2015 ) . This is also the first time that a purified DNA - binding protein from bacteria has been used for in - situ labelling in immunofluorescence experiments . I was responsible for the protocol optimisation in intact cells , chromosome spreads and fibers ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . CENP - A is the fundamental constituent of the centromere . The work of Hori and colleagues ( Hori et al . , 2014 ) represents an exciting step forward in understanding how epigenetic factors might regulate kinetochore assembly . The authors found that the H4K20me1 was co - IPing with CENP - A nucleosomes in both chicken and human cells . In addition they observed the presence of the mark by ChIP - seq in non - repetitive centromeres or neocentromeres comparing prior and after their establishment ( CENP - A deposition ) . My role in this project was to establish a protocol in DT40 cells for imaging the H4K20me1 mark on chromatin fibers , and testing for co - localization of CENP - A and H4K20me1 . CENP - T was used as a Chapter 3 : Results 117 standard for high level of co - localization with CENP - A . Using conventional light microscopy it was possible to visualize the H4 modification at centromeres of DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A ( Figure 3 . 6 A ) . A plugin of ImageJ / Fiji , called coloc2 , was used in order to quantify the extent of co - localization between CENP - A and H4K20me1 ( Figure 3 . 6 B ) . The analysis showed that CENP - A and H4K20me1 shared slightly over 60 % of their positions on chromatin fibers and also that this percentage is not affected by fiber length ( Figure 3 . 6 C ) . As I was interested in quantifying the amount of H4K20me1 at the centromere the data was plotted as CENP - A on H4K20me1 ( Figure 3 . 6 B ) ; this is because H4K20me1 is also present outside the centromere therefore if the data was charted as H4K20me1 on CENP - A , then the amount of shared positions would be lower , as CENP - A is not detected outside centromeres by microscopy ( Figure 3 . 6 C , red squares ) . In the cases of CENP - A and CENP - T this shift is less pronounced since CENP - A and CENP - T are both exclusively kinetochore proteins . Qualitative PALM data supported the wide - field experiments , confirming the presence of H4K20me1 on CENP - A nucleosomes . My data together with other results presented in that paper , led to the conclusion that H4K20me1 appears on chromatin where the loading of CENP - A has just occurred and represents a mature chromatin that is able to recruit CENP - T and therefore build a functional kinetochore to ensure correct chromosome segregation at the next mitosis ( Hori et al . , 2014 ) . Finally , it was possible to show that the protocols for fiber preparation , optimised in this chapter , allow the generation of highly unfolded , individual chromatin fibers . The experience and data collected in this chapter has permitted a robust protocol to be established allowing the reproducible generation of high quality DNA fibers in chicken cells . This method was next adopted in efforts to tackle the main research area of this study about kinetochore ultrastructure . Chapter 4 : Results 118 4 Chapter 4 : Ultrastructure analysis of the Gallus gallus kinetochore 4 . 1 Introduction The kinetochore is a multi - subunit protein complex located on the outer surface of each centromere whose main function is to bridge DNA , packed into chromosomes , with attached microtubules , thus playing an essential role in chromosome segregation during mitosis ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ; Joglekar et al . , 2010 ; Khodjakov et al . , 1997 ) . The assembly of a non fully functional kinetochore complex can result in aneuploidy ( Cleveland et al . , 2003 ) . CENP - A , CENP - B and CENP - C are probably the best studied CENPs , however , over the last decade 16 other centromere proteins have been identified , and further classified as members of the constitutive centromere associated network , CCAN ( Foltz et al . , 2006 ; Izuta et al . , 2006 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . Although it is still unclear how some CCAN components interact between one another it is thought that their location between the inner and outer kinetochore ( i . e . KMN network ) supplies a scaffold for microtubule plus tips on the centromere ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Hori et al . , 2008a ) . CENPs can be broadly classified into several functional sub - groups : CENP - C ; CENP - T / W / S / X ; CENP - H / I / K / M ; CENP - L / N and CENP - P / O / R / Q / U ( McAinsh and Meraldi , 2011 ; Perpelescu and Fukagawa , 2011 ; Takeuchi and Fukagawa , 2012 ) . Each sub - group occupies a specific region within the kinetochore , however , the exact mechanism of how these proteins function is still ambiguous . Collectively , all of these protein complexes contribute to the organization of centromere chromatin , which composes the kinetochore . At present , the ultra - structural organization of centromere chromatin during mitosis remains unclear , despite the research interest that this topic attracts . Currently , two specific questions remain unanswered : i ) how does the chromatin fold into the centromere and ii ) what are the differences in its folding between mitosis and interphase . One hypothesis is that the organization of the chromatin within the centromere resembles a cylinder composed of spirals or loops , where CENP - A Chapter 4 : Results 119 containing nucleosomes are positioned facing the outer kinetochore , whilst H3 chromatin is oriented towards the inner chromatin region in an amphipathic configuration ( Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) . A more recent study predicts a model , supported by super - resolution microscopy data , suggesting that centromere chromatin is folded back and forth into a boustrophedon and assembled in stacks , where H3 was visualized facing not only the inner kinetochore but also the outer kinetochore , as H3 shared a pattern of localization with CENP - T ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . The hypothesis of H3 nucleosomes being widely distributed throughout kinetochore chromatin was contrasting with previous observations ( Blower et al . , 2002 ; Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) . In this study we focused on the understanding of the re - organization of centromere chromatin between interphase and mitosis . I generated chromatin fibers from DT40 parental cells and several CENP depleted cell lines . By applying rigorous statistical analysis of fiber measurements from both interphase and mitotic cells , a repetitive module within the kinetochore chromatin was discovered that supports a structure like the boustrophedon , composed by layers . My results suggest that there are five layers of chromatin in interphase , in contrast to only three in mitotic samples . It was also possible to estimate the amount of chromatin present in each layer and therefore predict the amount of chromatin present in a chicken kinetochore . The total length of DNA in each layer was estimated to be 0 . 5 µ m . To further test kinetochore structure , conditional knockout and deletion cell lines of centromere proteins were analysed . These results revealed that CENP - C and CENP - S separately contribute in the maintenance of the structure of the kinetochore , whilst loss of CENP - I did not seem to affect kinetochore assembly . CENP - H and CENP - O depletion did not disrupt kinetochore structure although it did significantly affect centromere chromatin stretching . Chapter 4 : Results 120 4 . 2 Results 4 . 2 . 1 Mitotic kinetochores unfold only half as much as interphase pre - kinetochores To study the structure of the kinetochore , chromatin fibers were generated from cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A and the length of the GFP region was measured . A fully mature kinetochore is a structure that exists only during mitosis but the majority of CCAN kinetochore components are also present in interphase . Fibers from both interphase and mitosis samples were prepared , measured and the results of the measurements were compared and statistically analysed . Firstly , the generation of a stable GFP : CENP - A expressing cell line was required . Clone 18 cells are commonly used as a control or wild - type cell line in chicken DT40 ; from now onwards , I will refer to them as the parental cell line as other cell lines used in this study derive from this cell progenitor . Parental DT40 cells were electroporated with a GFP : CENP - A expressing vector and plated with geneticin as a selective agent for one week ( 2 . 4 . 4 ) . Growing colonies were amplified and screened for GFP expression by flow cytometer ( FL1 - H profiles for green fluorescence shown in 2 . 4 . 4 ) and further characterised by immunofluorescence . Western analysis confirmed that the final clone selected was stably expressing GFP : CENP - A at a level that did not affect the expression of endogenous CENP - A , when compared to parental DT40 cells ( Figure 4 . 1 A ) . Next , GFP : CENP - A expressing cells were processed for immunofluorescence and co - stained with CENP - T antibody , showing that the protein expressed localized correctly at the centromere , at every stage of mitosis and in interphase ( Figure 4 . 1 B ) . This level of overexpression of CENP - A did not cause mis - localization of GFP : CENP - A onto chromosome arms , as shown by the co - localization of GFP signal with CENP - T on chromatin fibers ( Figure 4 . 1 C ) . Next , chromatin fibers in chicken cells were obtained using TEEN buffer ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . Fibers were generated from optimally confluent cultures ( 60 % ) of both asynchronous and nocodazole arrested cells , Chapter 4 : Results 121 Figure 4 . 1 . Characterization of DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A . A . Immunoblot of whole cell lysate prepared from parental DT40 cells and DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A ; the aim was to check for the expression levels of GFP : CENP - A and endogenous CENP - A . In each lane 3 . 5 X 10 5 cells were loaded . The membrane was probed with primary antibodies raised against tubulin , GFP and GgCENP - A . Signals were acquired using IRDye® 680 and 800 conjugated secondary antibodies . The Li - Cor Odyssey system was used for signal acquisition . B .

Coverslips with cells were processed for fiber preparation using TEEN buffer ( 2 . 5 . 3 ) . Fixed samples were probed with anti GgCENP - T antibody . The signal was detected using Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated secondary antibody ( red ) . Centromere chromatin was identified by the GFP signal ( green ) . DNA was counterstained with Hoechst . Scale bar , 5 µ m . Chapter 4 : Results 122 Chapter 4 : Results 123 these were fixed in parallel and DNA was stained with Hoechst to allow fiber visualization . Images of fibers were acquired using a DeltaVision RT microscope ( Applied Precision ) . Centromere fibers were identified by the presence of the GFP signal marking CENP - A chromatin ( Figure 4 . 2 A ) . The lengths of the fibers were measured in microns ( µ m ) using ImageJ and the “segmented line” tool . Clearly distinguishable and non - overlapping fibers in the field of view were used for the data acquisition in order to avoid artefacts deriving from overlapping fibers . All data concerning asynchronous cells will be referred to , from here onwards , as interphase data since ! 95 % of DT40 cell cultures are in interphase at any given time . The mean centromere unfolding in interphase ( 1 . 97 µ m + / - 1 . 27 ) was greater than the mean centromere unfolding found in mitosis ( 1 . 09 µ m + / - 0 . 65 ) ( box and whisker plots in Figure 4 . 2 B ) . The difference in unfolding between the two samples was statistically significant ( p < 0 . 0001 ; Mann - Whitney U test ) . This difference between the two samples was due to the presence of a higher number of short length fibers in mitosis compared to longer length fibers observed in interphase . This was more apparent when the data was represented as frequency histograms ( Figure 4 . 2 C ) . The frequency histograms , with a bin width of 1 µ m , showed the distribution of the data within a range of lengths between 1 and 10 µ m . Hence , if the box and whisker plots showed the mean difference in the overall stretching of interphase and mitotic fibers , the frequency histograms highlighted instead the presence of accumulation points . The histograms showed different patterns of distribution for the two samples . To confirm that TEEN buffer was allowing genuine unfolding of the centromeres , one would predict that the level of GFP fluorescence should decrease proportionally to the increasing of fiber length . Simultaneous measurements of GFP : CENP - A fluorescence intensity and fiber length were performed on 25 randomly picked fibers for both interphase and mitosis samples . Data obtained was represented in a 2D scatter plot where on the x axis fiber length was represented versus GFP fluorescence intensity on the y axis ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . Chapter 4 : Results 124 Figure 4 . 2 . Unfolding of centromere chromatin in interphase versus mitotic samples . A . 60 % confluent coverslips with DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A were processed for chromatin stretching ( 2 . 5 . 3 ) . DNA was counterstained with Hoechst .

Box and whisker plots showing the median fiber length ( black line in the boxes ) for both interphase and mitotic data sets . The size of the box defines the interquartile range , whilst the whiskers indicate the 10 th and the 90 th percentile .

Frequency histograms containing stretched fiber length data for interphase ( blue bars ) and mitotic ( red bars ) samples . The data was allotted into ten 1 µ m bin width histograms . Centromere length is expressed in µ m on the x axis . Frequency percentages for each bin were calculated and represented on the y axis . Chapter 4 : Results 125 Chapter 4 : Results 126 The slope of the line of best fit confirmed that greater unfolding directly correlates with the decrease in fluorescence intensity . Overall , this analysis of the data demonstrated that GFP fluorescence intensity decreased with the increase of the fiber length as expected from the quantification of single fibers . These results showed that the interphase pre - kinetochore has the potential to unfold to twice the length of its mitotic counterpart ( 1 . 97 µ m + / - 1 . 27 versus 1 . 09 µ m + / - 0 . 65 ) , or , an alternative way to interpret this would be that the mitotic kinetochore is twice as compact as that of an interphase . These results support the common literature ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ; Maiato et al . , 2004 ) since one of the key roles of a kinetochore , during mitosis , is to act as a platform for microtubule attachments and the propagation of pushing / pulling forces . Following the observation that the data - sets displayed different patterns of distribution , it was considered whether a more rigorous statistical analysis would reveal some novel insights .

Correlation between GFP : CENP - A fiber length and GFP fluorescence intensity . 2D scatter plots representing fiber length measurements versus GFP fluorescence intensity values in 25 fibers , randomly chosen , for both interphase ( blue ) and mitosis ( red ) . In addition , for both samples , the best fitting line was also calculated together with R squared value . The scatter plots show that longer fibers had weaker GFP fluorescent signals . Chapter 4 : Results 128 4 . 2 . 2 Kinetochore unfolding : a new approach to study the organization of the kinetochore chromatin Due to the large sample size ( 655 measured fibers ) for both interphase and mitosis samples , it was possible to increase the resolution of the data by plotting it into frequency histograms with smaller bin widths . To identify the most appropriate bin width for this sample size , several plots with a range of bins and bin width were attempted . Therefore , from the initial 10 bins ( 1 µ m bin width ) data were divided into 50 ( 200 nm ) , 60 ( 166 nm ) , 80 ( 125 nm ) or 100 ( 100 nm ) bins ( Figure 4 . 4 A ) . Strikingly , segmenting the data into 100 bin frequency histograms appeared to reveal the presence of distinct populations of fibers within the two data - sets visualized as distinguishable peaks ( Figure 4 . 4 A , 100 bins ) . The difference between both data - sets was most apparent when overlaid onto the same graph ( Figure 4 . 4 B ) . In mitosis ( red bars ) a majority of the fibers were short . Therefore the histogram bars were all present on the left end of the graph . In contrast , interphase fibers ( blue bars ) were rarely observed . A majority of the fibers were found between 1 and 2 µ m . The remaining data consisted of a low number of very long fibers ( Figure 4 . 4 B ) . In order to test more directly whether or not there were indeed subpopulations of fibers within the data - sets , a multi - peak analysis was performed . 100 bin histograms were chosen as the optimal number of bins applicable to this sample size . A higher number of bins caused saturation of the resolution potential and excessive breaks in the histogram continuity . This was shown when the data was allotted in 250 and 500 bins ( Figure 4 . 5 A and B ) . Multi - peak analysis was performed using the multi - peak fitting package 2 . 0 in Igor Pro 6 . 2 software ( WaveMetrics ) ( 2 . 8 . 2 ) . Interestingly , the algorithm recognised five and three distinct peaks in fibers from interphase and mitosis respectively ( Figure 4 . 6 A and B , red curves ) , suggesting the presence of a subpopulations of unfolded centromeres . In addition , it was possible to Chapter 4 : Results 129 Figure 4 . 4 . Increasing the number of bins improves the resolution of the data . A . Two columns of frequency histograms are represented containing fiber length data from interphase ( left column , blue bars ) and mitotic samples ( right column , red bars ) . Columns show a progressive revealing of substructure of the histograms . This was obtained by adjusting the number of bins and bin width ( bin width indicated in brackets ) : 50 bins ( 200 nm ) , 60 bins ( 166 nm ) , 80 bins ( 125 nm ) and 100 bins ( 100 nm ) . On the x axis centromere length is expressed in µ m , while on the y axis frequency of fibers allotted in each bin is represented expressed in percentages . The scale on the y axis has been kept different for interphase and mitosis to allow a better visualization of the peaks in the two data sets . B . Frequency histograms containing both data sets allotted into 100 bins ( 100 nm ) were merged together into one graph with the same scale on the y axis . At the optimal bin width of 100 nm putative subpopulations of fibers are observed in both data - sets . Chapter 4 : Results 130 Chapter 4 : Results 131 Figure 4 . 5 . The maximum number of bins in which is possible to divide the data is limited by the sample size ( n number ) . For both interphase and mitotis data sets the fiber length measurements were allotted in 250 and 500 bins with bin width of 40 and 20 nm respectively , on the x axis . On the y axis the height of the histograms showed the frequency in which each range of length was represented in the population of fibers . Dividing the data sets in a number of bins greater than 100 with an n number of 655 fibers measured caused the disappearance of clear peaks , which were observed at 100 bins . Chapter 4 : Results 132 visualize the best fitting curve ( Figure 4 . 6 A and B , blue line ) . The quality of the fit was measured by the presence of small residuals and the chi - square value ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . Using , Igor Pro software it was also possible to identify the exact localization of each peak in a space scale expressed in µ m . The distance between two adjacent peaks was measured and the mean of all the intervals present calculated for the two samples . Intervals of 0 . 615 , 0 . 464 , 0 . 506 and 0 . 725 µ m were found between peaks from interphase . Remarkably these reflect four approximally equal steps of unfolding ( mean = 0 . 577 µ m ) . In mitosis , intervals were 0 . 449 and 1 . 248 µ m with a mean of 0 . 424 µ m , where the value 1 . 248 was counted three times ( as a multiple of 0 . 5 µ m ) ( Figure 4 . 6 C ) . These distances have provisionally been interpreted as steps of unfolding of constituent repetitive units of kinetochore chromatin . These could potentially help estimate the amount of chromatin present on average in each chromatin layer that composes the kinetochore . The mean between the interphase and mitotic step of unfolding ( 0 . 577 and 0 . 424 µ m ) was calculated equal to 0 . 5 µ m . Next , both the position and area of each peak were registered and compared , to test whether any of the subpopulations of fibers were common to both data - sets . From the listed values for peak areas ( Figure 4 . 8 ) it was possible to identify two common populations of fibers , across the samples , which were located at ! 1 µ m and at 2 . 7 µ m ( Figure 4 . 8 , peaks 1 and 4 interphase ; peaks 2 and 3 mitosis ) . When comparing just these peaks the amount of fibers present in mitosis was lower than the one in interphase ; this was in agreement with the presence of a greater peak in mitosis at 0 . 8 µ m ( Figure 4 . 8 , peaks 1 mitosis ) . In contrast , in interphase two intermediate and one final peak were identified that were undetectable in mitosis ( Figure 4 . 8 , peaks 2 , 3 and 5 ) . Peak - associated colours indicate how the fiber populations distributed in the transition between interphase and mitosis . These results suggest the existence of a repetitive module underlying the kinetochore structure detectable in both interphase and mitosis . This module is constituted by multiple 500 nm lengths of chromatin . The amount of chromatin present at the kinetochore throughout interphase and mitosis apparently remains constant however the packaging of the layers changes , with increased constraints Chapter 4 : Results 133 during mitosis . If the kinetochore is indeed composed of stacked layers , the nature of the connections between different layers still remained unclear . Following these findings , we next decided to use our newly applied statistical approach to identify which CCAN components are , or are not , relevant for the maintenance of ordered 500 nm arrays of layers . For this , I performed fiber analysis on numerous conditional knockout and deletion cell lines . Chapter 4 : Results 134 Figure 4 . 6 . The centromere is composed of multiple dynamic chromatin layers . Unfolded fiber data from interphase and mitosis samples was plotted as frequency histograms and analysed with a multi - peak fitting algorithm using Igor Pro software ( 2 . 8 . 3 ) . In panels A and B are probability density histograms . The y and x axes show frequency and centromere fiber length ( µ m ) respectively . The data sets are divided in 100 bins with a resolution of 100 nm per bin . Putative populations of fiber lengths within the two data sets were highlighted by discrete peaks ( red curves ) . The best fitting curve is shown ( blue line ) for both samples . C . Schematic representing the location of the peaks ( µ m ) and the length of the intervals between two adjacent peaks ( µ m ) . The average step of unfolding was calculated as a mean of these numbers where 1 . 248 µ m was interpreted as 3X of the 0 . 5 µ m step . Chapter 4 : Results 135 Chapter 4 : Results 136 Figure 4 . 7 . Evaluation of the quality of fit of the multi - peak analysis carried out with Igor Pro . A complete series of graphs obtained during a multi - peak fitting of the input data for the two data - sets is shown . Similarly to the previous graphs , on the y axis were plotted frequencies whilst on the x axis was the fiber length ( µ m ) . For each sample , the upper diagram highlighted the amount of residuals . The larger the residuals , the worse is the fitting function . In addition the software calculated a chi - square value , which could be employed to calculate the p value together with the degrees of freedom ( DF , DF = 100 – 1 = 99 ) . In the middle diagrams the best fitting curve is shown ( blue line ) . In the bottom diagrams individual peaks identified during the analysis were illustrated ( red curves ) . Chapter 4 : Results 137 Figure 4 . 8 . Changes in compaction of centromere chromatin layers at the transition of interphase with mitosis . Individual peaks obtained from the multi - peak analysis were aligned along the x axes and straight lines were drawn from peaks in interphase down in the mitotic peaks crossing shared peaks between interphase and mitosis . The values for the area of each peak are shown in tables . Looking at the area values it was possible to highlight with different colours putative common fiber populations between the two data sets . Chapter 4 : Results 138 4 . 2 . 3 Generation and characterization of conditional knockout ( KO ) and deletion ( " ) cell lines stably expressing GFP : CENP - A Following the identification of structural differences in kinetochore chromatin between interphase and mitosis , cell lines allowing the depletion of CENPs were used to perform centromere unfolding analysis with the aim of identifying novel contributors to kinetochore structure . The original conditional knockout ( KO ) and deletion ( " ) cell lines ( donated to our laboratory by Prof . Fukagawa ) did not express a fluorescent centromere marker , therefore it was necessary to generate new cell lines expressing GFP : CENP - A . Stable lines made included : CENP - H KO GFP : CENP - A ; CENP - I KO GFP : CENP - A ; CENP - O " GFP : CENP - A ; CENP - S " GFP : CENP - A ; CENP - C KO GFP : CENP - A . A comprehensive list of conditions used to make these cell lines is present in the Materials and Methods of this thesis ( section 2 . 4 . 4 ) . After antibiotic selection , growing colonies were expanded and screened for GFP expression by flow cytometry ( FL1 - H profiles for green fluorescence shown in 2 . 4 . 4 ) and further characterised by immunofluorescence . The final clones chosen showed the correct localization of GFP : CENP - A , as showed by the co - staining with anti CENP - T antibody , in every stage of mitosis and interphase ( Figure 4 . 9 A ) . To test that the presence of doxycycline ( and therefore depletion of target proteins ) did not affect GFP : CENP - A expression / localization cells were next treated with doxycycline , fixed , and probed with anti CENP - T antibody . GFP : CENP - A signal co - localized with CENP - T immuno - staining at kinetochores in both mitosis and interphase ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . The expression of exogenous CENP - A tagged with GFP did not affect the levels of endogenous CENP - A as demonstrated by western blotting analysis ( Figure 4 . 9 B ) . To test that genetic engineering of the KO and " cell lines , for the additional expression of GFP : CENP - A , had not interrupted the tetracycline conditional depletion mechanism , growth curves were performed . To test cell viability in presence or absence of doxycycline cell vitality was monitored using Trypan Blue ( 2 . 4 . 5 ) . It had been previously published that depletion of these proteins would cause Chapter 4 : Results 139 Figure 4 . 9 .

The Li - Cor Odyssey system was used for signal acquisition . Chapter 4 : Results 140 Chapter 4 : Results 141 Figure 4 . 10 .

Even when each specific CENP was depleted the expressed GFP : CENP - A showed a correct co - localization with CENP - T staining at kinetochores . Scale bar , 5 µ m . Chapter 4 : Results 142 an extension of the cell cycle ( Amano et al . , 2009 ; Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ; Kwon et al . , 2007 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . Newly generated KO and ! cell lines ( expressing GFP : CENP - A ) were grown in parallel , with or without doxycycline present in the media ( Figure 4 . 11 A ) . Cells were counted every 24 hours . All the KO and ! cell lines were able to divide when grown in standard media . In the presence of doxycycline , it was found that all of the KO cell lines either died or were unable to duplicate , whereas CENP - S and CENP - O ! cell lines survived ( Figure 4 . 11 A , + doxy ) . These data suggest an unaltered response to tetracycline mediated repression of gene expression . Following this successful functional test of CENP depletion by growth curves , I next analysed the new cell lines by western blotting . To do so , antibodies raised against chicken CENP proteins were used ( Table 2 . 3 ) . Since antibodies raised against chicken protein are not commercially available , they had been previously generated , by rabbit inoculation , in collaborators laboratories . The Uniprot database was consulted to find out the size of the chicken centromere proteins analysed for detection ( Figure 4 . 11 B ) . As antibodies that are not commercialized can have low affinity for their target , and indeed CENP proteins are often in low abundance , protein samples deriving from whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts were tested . Anti GgCENP - I antibody positively recognised a band of the right size in the KO cell line that disappeared after the addition of doxycycline ( Figure 4 . 11 D yellow box , lanes 4 and 5 ) ; however the same band was not present in the DT40 parental cell line ( yellow box , lanes 2 and 3 ) . This is likely due to the fact that in KO cell lines the transgene under tetracycline control inserted can be expressed at a higher level than the endogenous gene . In order to exclude any issue with the western blotting procedure itself , the membrane was additionally probed with anti GFP antibody that successfully recognised GFP : CENP - A ( green box ) . GgCENP - H at the predicted size of 26 kDa was not recognised with the anti GgCENP - H antibody ( Figure 4 . 11 E yellow box ) . The membrane was also incubated with anti GFP antibody and GFP : CENP - A was clearly identified ( green box ) in the samples . This suggested a lack of the antibody recognition rather than an unreliable performance of western blotting procedure . Chapter 4 : Results 143 Anti GgCENP - O and GgCENP - S antibodies were tested on portions of a membrane cut prior to antibody incubations ( Figure 4 . 11 F and G ) . Anti GgCENP - O antibody successfully identified one band between 35 and 40 kDa that was not present anymore in the CENP - O ! cell line ( Figure 4 . 11 F yellow box ) . In contrast , anti GgCENP - S antibody did not highlight any band of " 15 kDa that was absent in the CENP - S ! cell line ( Figure 4 . 11 G yellow box ) . In this case , incubation with anti GFP antibody was not performed as the anti CENP - O antibody clearly worked whereas anti CENP - S antibody did not . Western blotting analysis of the CENP - C KO stably expressing GFP : CENP - A could not be tested as anti ggCENP - C antibody was not available in the laboratory . As additional control , progenitor cell lines for each of the conditionally or stably depleted CENP were analysed in the laboratory by mass - spectrometry and an efficient decrease in levels of each of the proteins was observed ( I . Samejima , data not shown ) . In conclusion , new KO and ! cell lines stably expressing GFP : CENP - A were generated . The cell lines showed an appropriate level of expression of GFP : CENP - A , which correctly localized at kinetochores , as demonstrated by co - localizing signals with CENP - T . In addition , the KO cell lines were still under tetracycline control for protein depletion as shown by growth curves and western blotting , where the antibodies worked .

Chapter 4 : Results 145 Chapter 4 : Results 146 4 . 2 . 4 Depletion of CCAN components affects the structure of the kinetochore Next , centromere stretching analysis was performed in mitotic cells , depleted of either CENP - C , - S , - H , - O and - I . These results were directly compared to the results obtained in the parental cell line . From here onwards , each sample depleted of a CCAN component will be indicated by the name of the protein followed by the word ‘off’ to highlight the absence of such protein . 60 % confluent cultures of each cell line were treated with doxycycline for the appropriate time ( 2 . 4 . 1 ) and with nocodazole for 12 hours before generating fibers according to the TEEN protocol ( 2 . 5 . 3 ) . DNA was stained with Hoechst to allow fiber visualization . Samples were subsequently imaged on a DeltaVision RT ( Applied Precision ) microscope . Centromere fibers were identified by the presence of the GFP signal marking CENP - A chromatin ( Figure 4 . 12 A ) . Fiber lengths were measured in ImageJ using the segmented line tool . Strikingly , a large difference in the mean fiber stretching was seen between mitotic fibers of both CENP - C and CENP - S depleted samples ( Figure 4 . 12 B , 2 . 81 µ m + / - 1 . 97 and 2 . 44 µ m + / - 2 . 14 respectively ) compared with mitotic fibers from parental DT40 cells ( Figure 4 . 12 B , 1 . 09 µ m + / - 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 for both comparisons ) . Indeed CENP - C depletion in mitosis caused a greater fiber stretching than the one seen with parental interphase fibers ( Figure 4 . 12 B , 1 . 97 µ m + / - 1 . 27 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . To assess whether the effect observed in CENP - S OFF samples was due entirely to the lack of CENP - S , or to the loss of the entire CENP - T / W / S / X complex at kinetochores , an immunofluorescence experiment was performed in the CENP - S ! cell line and fixed cells were incubated with anti CENP - T antibody ( Figure 4 . 13 ) . CENP - T was still detected at kinetochores suggesting that CENP - S might a have a role in kinetochore structure in mitosis , which is CENP - T independent . Chapter 4 : Results 147 Figure 4 . 12 .

Chapter 4 : Results 148 Chapter 4 : Results 149 No statistically significant difference was seen between CENP - I depleted mitotic fibers and parental mitotic fiber length ( Figure 4 . 12 B , 0 . 96 µ m + / - 0 . 33 ; p > 0 . 05 ) . CENP - H and CENP - O depleted mitotic fibers showed a lower but still statistically significant difference from both parental interphase and mitosis fiber length ( Figure 4 . 12 B , 1 . 43 µ m + / - 0 . 62 and 1 . 21 µ m + / - 0 . 50 ; Figure 4 . 12 C , p values table ) . Representing the data as frequency histograms with bin width of 1 µ m ( Figure 4 . 12 D ) it became more apparent that CENP - C and CENP - S depleted cells blocked in mitosis behaved similarly to interphase parental cells , demonstrating an important role of CENP - C and CENP - S in creating a robust mitotic kinetochore structure ; in contrast , histograms from CENP - I OFF mitotic unfolded fibers better resembled the parental mitotic fibers , suggesting that the absence of CENP - I in mitotic kinetochores does not perturb the structure . CENP - H OFF and CENP - O OFF mitotic fibers stretched at an intermediate level between parental mitotic and interphase fibers , potentially indicating either a lesser essential role in holding mitotic kinetochore structure together or possibly effects on the targeting of CENP - C or CENP - S to kinetochores . As previously , the number of bins used to cluster the data for further analysis was considered . The most appropriate bin width for the data acquired in the CENP depleted cell lines was 200 nm in 50 bins ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . At 100 bins it was possible to observe an excessive increase in ‘fuzziness’ and breaks in the histogram continuity , particularly for CENP - C and CENP - S depleted fibers , when the measurements are spread over a large length range . In the case of CENP - H , CENP - O and CENP - I depleted fibers , although the curve profile at 100 bins was probably acceptable , for coherent and comparative purposes all the KO and ! cell lines data was plotted in histograms with 50 bins . A multi - peak analysis was performed using Igor Pro software ( WaveMetrics ) ( 2 . 8 . 2 ) ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . Four peaks were identified in both CENP - C and CENP - S depleted mitotic fiber data - sets ( Figure 4 . 15 A ) , suggesting the existence of four subpopulations of fibers . The quality of fitting was satisfactory as indicated by Chapter 4 : Results 150 Figure 4 . 13 . In CENP - S ! cell line CENP - T is still present at kinetochores . Here are shown two representative images of CENP - S ! cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A used for measurements of unfolded fibers . Confluent coverslips were fixed and cells were probed with anti CENP - T antibody . Signals were detected using Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated secondary antibody ( red ) . DNA was counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) . CENP - T signal was normally detectable and showed co - localization with GFP : CENP - A ( green ) at kinetochores . Scale bar , 5 µ m . Chapter 4 : Results 151 Figure 4 . 14 . Testing data resolution by changing the histogram bin number in the CENP depleted data - sets . For each KO and ! cell lines the fiber data were divided in 50 or 100 bins where the bin width was 200 or 100 nm respectively . On the y axis was represented the frequency expressed in percentages whilst on the x axis centromere length expressed in µ m . Initially , the data - sets were allotted in 50 bins and successively into 100 bins . Clustering data in 100 bins seemed to better suit samples where the overall unfolding achieved was not high , however in the case of CENP - C and CENP - S depleted fibers , the histograms were often intercalated with gaps and started showing some ‘fuzziness’ indicating too low an n number of measurements for such a high number of bins . In order to analyse all the mutants under same conditions , 50 bins were used to represent the data in all cell lines for further analyses . Chapter 4 : Results 152 Chapter 4 : Results 153 the chi - square values and the residuals ( Figure 4 . 15 C ) . CENP - C OFF mitotic fibers exhibited intervals between two adjacent peaks of 0 . 93 , 1 . 38 and 0 . 97 µ m . Interestingly , these are broadly all multiples of the step of unfolding of 0 . 5 µ m measured in the parental cell line ( Figure 4 . 6 C ) . A similar pattern of unfolding was seen in CENP - S OFF mitotic fibers ( Figure 4 . 16 , intervals = 1 . 22 , 1 . 09 and 1 . 24 µ m ) . In contrast , only two peaks were identified in CENP - H OFF , CENP - O OFF and CENP - I OFF mitotic fibers ( Figure 4 . 15 B ) compared with three peaks in the parental mitotic sample ( Figure 4 . 6 ) . The intervals for these samples were consistently close to 0 . 5 µ m ( Figure 4 . 16 ) . This suggested a possible hyper - constriction of the structure when those proteins were not present . Considering the interval values obtained from the multi - peak analysis of CENP depleted fibers , a mean unfolding step was calculated equal to 0 . 45 µ m , where distance values close to 1 µ m were counted twice and distance values close to 1 . 5 µ m were counted three times . In conclusion , a role of CENP - C and CENP - S in the maintenance of kinetochore structure was demonstrated . CENP - C and CENP - S depletion caused a major loosening of kinetochore structure , suggesting a function in bridging separated layers of chromatin . Decreased levels of CENP - H , CENP - O and CENP - I did not disrupt the structure of mitotic kinetochore although it is possible that the structure contracted instead . The mean step of unfolding in CENP depleted cell lines was calculated , supporting the hypothesis that multiple 500 nm layers of chromatin comprise the core component of kinetochore architecture . Chapter 4 : Results 154 Figure 4 . 15 . Multi - peak analysis of the unfolding data - sets in CENP depleted cell lines . Data from KO and ! cell lines was plotted as frequency histograms and analysed with a multi - peak fitting algorithm using the Igor Pro software .

Schematic showing the location of each peak ( µ m ) and the length of the intervals between two adjacent peaks ( µ m ) . These numbers derived from the multi - peak analysis performed on the related data sets with the data allotted in 50 bins . The average step of unfolding across all the cell lines is 0 . 45 µ m . This value was calculated by performing a mean of all the interval values , where values close to 1 µ m were counted twice and values near 1 . 5 µ m were counted three times . Chapter 4 : Results 156 4 . 2 . 5 Mapping the distribution of kinetochore components in unfolded fibers by PALM Given that the depletion of CENP - C and CENP - S led to extended kinetochore fiber stretching by conventional light microscopy , I next considered whether super resolution microscopy of samples might provide additional insights into mapping kinetochore proteins onto chromatin fibers . Therefore , with the following experiments I aimed to observe differences in the localization of various CCAN components relative to CENP - A . PALM is a single - molecule based microscopy technique that exploits the properties of ‘blinking’ or photo - switchable fluorescent molecules ( Shcherbakova et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore DT40 cells stably expressing Dronpa : CENP - A were generated in order to perform the experiments . Parental DT40 cells were electroporated with a Dronpa : CENP - A expressing vector and plated with geneticin as a selective agent for one week ( 2 . 4 . 4 ) . Growing colonies were expanded and screened for Dronpa expression by flow cytometry ( FL1 - H profiles for green fluorescence shown in 2 . 4 . 4 ) and further characterised by immunofluorescence . Since the use of highly specific primary antibodies is essential while performing PALM experiments , antibodies raised against chicken CENP - O , CENP - R and CENP - S proteins were first tested by immunofluorescence in DT40 cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A using wide - field microscopy . The specificity of the antibodies was tested in both intact cells and stretched centromere fibers ( Figure 4 . 17 A and B ) . The three antibodies tested showed high specificity for kinetochores in intact cells and on chromatin , with the exception of GgCENP - S antibody , which in intact cells also seemed to stain nucleoli . Validated anti GgCENP - R antibody was chosen as the most reliable kinetochore marker and employed for the following PALM studies . CENP - C KO and CENP - S ! cell lines stably expressing Dronpa : CENP - A were seeded on conA coated coverslips ( thickness 1 . 5 , 2 . 7 ) . Samples were processed for chromatin fiber generation using TEEN buffer ( 2 . 5 . 3 ) . After fixation , Chapter 4 : Results 157 Figure 4 . 17 . GgCENP antibody screening for PALM . A . GgCENP - R , GgCENP - S and GgCENP - O antibodies were tested in intact DT40 parental cells stably expressing GFP : CENP - A .

Antibody labelling was performed as explained in A . DNA was counterstained with Hoechst ( blue ) . Scale bar , 5 µ m . Chapter 4 : Results 158 samples were probed with anti CENP - R antibody , followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 647 ‘blinking’ secondary antibody . On the day of data acquisition , imaging chambers were mounted where samples were in direct contact with switching buffer ( 2 . 7 ) ; imaging was performed using an oil immersion 60X TIRF objective mounted on an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE2000 microscope . Following steps of analysis ( 2 . 8 . 2 ) , results showed that CENP - A and CENP - R co - localized in control conditions with a frequency of 100 % ( Figure 4 . 18 , CENP - C ON , n = 12 fibers ) . However , when CENP - C or CENP - S were depleted the number of fibers in which co - localization between CENP - A and CENP - R was observed decreased to 66 % and 63 % respectively ( Figure 4 . 18 , CENP - C OFF and CENP - S OFF , n = 9 and n = 11 respectively ) . These findings , confirm our other data , suggesting that when CENP - C and CENP - S are depleted , ultra - structural changes in the kinetochore occur allowing the structure to lose compaction , such that CENP - A and CENP - R no longer co - localise in some cells . Chapter 4 : Results 159 Figure 4 . 18 . Analysis of kinetochore architecture by PALM . Reconstructed images of DT40 centromere fibers . DT40 cell lines stably expressing Dronpa : CENP - A were processed for generating chromatin fibers ( 2 . 5 . 3 ) and probed with anti CENP - R antibody . The signal was detected using Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody . Dronpa and Alexa Fluor 647 blinking properties were optimal into a switching buffer , which catalysed molecule blinking during laser irradiation . For each fiber , 500 frames were acquired in both channels and the movies were later processed through Igor Pro for particle recognition and coordinate assignment .

Chapter 4 : Results 160 4 . 2 . 6 Model for kinetochore folding To better test the robustness of our findings , we generated an up - to - date model of the kinetochore ultrastructure . This model combined our findings with already known and generally accepted measurements of kinetochore dimensions ( Figure 4 . 19 A ) using the software Anim8or 3D Modeler . The parental DT40 interphase data predicts a kinetochore structure composed of five distinct layers of chromatin , corresponding to the five peaks recognised from the multi - peak algorithm in the same data - set ( Figure 4 . 6 A ) . Each layer contained " 500 nm of chromatin ( average step size of unfolding , Figure 4 . 6 C ) comprising both H3 and CENP - A nucleosomes ( Figure 4 . 19 A , represented in grey and green respectively ) . In the model , CENP - C was integrated as a linker between adjacent chromatin layers and intra - layer too . In the outermost layer CENP - C also extends towards the outer kinetochore in order to take contact with Mis12 ( Hori et al . , 2013 ; Przewloka et al . , 2011 ) . Estimating the total length of the chromatin in each layer it was possible to predict the number of nucleosomes assembled on such a length of chromatin . Nucleosomes size is known from EM and AFM measurements to be " 10 nm ( Olins and Olins , 1978 ) . By combining these known sizes with data from this thesis we would predict that " 50 nucleosomes could be associated with 500 nm of DNA ( Figure 4 . 19 B ) . Multiplying the number of nucleosomes for five layers of chromatin yields a total of 250 nucleosomes per chicken kinetochore ( 50 X 5 , Figure 4 . 19 B ) . If it is considered that one nucleosome occupies " 147 bp ( or 200 bp including DNA linker ) , then 250 nucleosomes X 200 bp would predict that 50 kb of chromatin are present in a chicken kinetochore . Chapter 4 : Results 161 Figure 4 . 19 . 3D model for centromere chromatin folding in a DT40 kinetochore . A . 3D model of the kinetochore chromatin designed with the free software Anim8or 3D Modeler . In the model the chromatin ( blue ) is wrapped around nucleosomes containing either GFP : CENP - A ( green ) or H3 ( grey ) . On the basis of the data collected from parental DT40 cells in interphase , chromatin and nucleosomes are organised into repetitive units , with the shape of layers , which are composed by 500 nm of chromatin . Five layers of chromatin and nucleosomes would compose the inner kinetochore . Rod - shaped CENP - C dimers ( red ) can enter in contact with H3 directly and form a net of interactions between different layers and inside each layer , constituting a structural scaffold . CENP - S , not included in this model , from the data here presented clearly executes a similar function . In the outer most layers of the kinetochore , CENP - C molecules also engaged contact with Mis12 , working as a bridge with the KMN network in the outer kinetochore ( light brown round pattern ) . B . Schematic of the mathematics behind the calculation of the amount of DNA present in a chicken kinetochore . Chapter 4 : Results 162 4 . 3 Discussion and conclusion The results presented in this chapter derived from a novel approach developed to tackle the as - yet unresolved topic of kinetochore chromatin fiber pucking . In order to answer our biological question we used stretched centromeres and measured their length looking at the fluorescence of GFP fused to CENP - A . Adopting chicken as model organism was decided on the basis of the highly reproducible unfolding procedure using TEEN buffer that did not require addition of detergents ( 3 . 2 . 1 ) . Initially , the study focused on highlighting differences in the structure of the kinetochore between interphase and mitosis . From chicken parental DT40 cells , it was necessary to generate a new cell line stably expressing GFP : CENP - A . It was important to confirm that the overexpression level obtained for CENP - A did not cause a spread of CENP - A in the pericentromeric region ( Figure 4 . 1 C ) . Once the cell line was obtained , cells were grown in absence or presence of nocodazole for the last 12 hours before fixation of interphase and mitotic samples respectively . As representative fluorescence images showed , interphase centromeres were more prone to stretch compared to mitotic ones ( Figure 4 . 2 A ) . For direct comparison , the entire collection of measurements for the two samples was represented in box and whiskers plots where the fibers unfolding was found to be significantly different ( Figure 4 . 2 B ) . This was the first time that a direct comparison between unfolded centromeres in interphase and mitosis has been quantified . Although interesting , this piece of data still did not fully reveal the internal organization of chromatin inside the kinetochore . Therefore a complex mathematical interpretation of the data was pursued . We next aimed to test whether our large data - sets contained hidden subpopulations of fibers . This was the motivation for representing the data - sets as frequency histograms ( Figure 4 . 2 C ) . Achieving a high number of measurements allowed clustering of the data in bins representing 100 nm range of length ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . It was previously suggested that chromatin at centromere could form a stack of loops ( Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) or a layer of sinusoids ( a boustrophedon ) ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . I therefore tested if it was possible to identify any repetitive units in the data - sets . Performing multi - peak analysis on the data - sets provided an insight to this Chapter 4 : Results 163 question . Five discrete populations of fibers were identified in interphase and only three in mitosis ( Figure 4 . 6 A and B ) . Each peak represented a node of accumulation of fiber lengths . One interpretation is that each peak represents unfolding of one layer of chromatin composing the kinetochore . The distance between two consecutive peaks can then be interpreted as the amount of chromatin comprising a chromatin layer ( Figure 4 . 6 C ) . The analysis identified a repetitive step of unfolding at the centromere of 0 . 5 µ m . The spatial location of the peaks also suggested the presence of stronger forces holding together kinetochore chromatin along a shorter radius in mitosis compared to interphase . This could explain why , in mitosis , a lower number of peaks was detectable . Parameters used to assess whether the statistical analysis was reliable or not included residuals and chi - square values . Residuals , or fitting deviations , represent the difference between the observed values with the predicted sample mean and our best fitting curve . A positive value of residual suggests that the measured value is placed above the best fit curve whilst a negative one is referred to a value located underneath it . If the best fit curve passes through the value measured than there is no residual , therefore the residual equals zero . Comparing interphase to mitosis it was possible to observe that the fitting in interphase was probably more accurate than in mitosis as the range of the residuals was smaller ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . The chi - square value here expressed is not on itself a p value , however it could be used to calculate the p value knowing the degrees of freedom ( 100 categories – 1 = 99 degrees of freedom ) . Although only three peaks were detected in unfolded mitotic kinetochores , this does not necessarily imply that in mitosis there is a loss of chromatin but rather that in mitosis chromatin is more resistant to unfolding . On the basis of area measurements of the peaks it was possible to map the extra peaks present in interphase onto those detected in mitosis ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . This tighter packaging chromatin during mitosis is probably due to the presence , at this stage of the cell cycle , of a mature kinetochore complete with the outer kinetochore proteins . Next , we wanted to test whether the removal of specific CCAN components could affect kinetochore unfolding . The original conditional knockout and deletion cell lines were engineered to stably express GFP : CENP - A ( Figure 4 . 9 and Figure Chapter 4 : Results 164 4 . 10 ) . When treated for an appropriate length of time in doxycycline , as specified in the methods section ( 2 . 4 . 1 ) , cells were tested for protein depletion and doubling time ( Figure 4 . 11 ) . When TEEN experiments for chromatin stretching were performed with mitotic samples , the unfolding measurements revealed different levels of stretching depending on which member of the CCAN was depleted . Measurements of CENP depleted kinetochores were collected into box and whiskers plots . These showed that the absence of CENP - C and CENP - S in mitosis allowed an increase in the stretching of centromere fibers . In contrast , depletion of CENP - H , CENP - O and CENP - I did not profoundly change the organization of kinetochore chromatin ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . In parallel experiments , PALM analysis of centromere architecture in cells depleted of CENP - C or CENP - S confirmed the establishment of a less rigid and organised structure ( Figure 4 . 18 ) . Previous studies found CENP - C to be a fundamental component of kinetochore stability ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . CENP - C is located at the inner kinetochore ( Wan et al . , 2009 ) where it can form dimers ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ) bridging nucleosomes . It was also reported , using chicken cells , that there is a direct interaction between CENP - C and H3 nucleosomes ( Hori et al . , 2008a ) . In addition , CENP - C represents a bridging point between the inner and outer kinetochore since it interacts with Mis12 ( Hori et al . , 2013 ; Przewloka et al . , 2011 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . In agreement with this , our results confirmed a destabilisation of the structure of the kinetochore after CENP - C depletion and its effect was quantified ‘in size’ for the first time . We hypothesized that dimers of CENP - C can connect H3 nucleosomes present on the same or on different layers of chromatin so that , once CENP - C is depleted , more than one layer of chromatin unfolds ( Figure 4 . 15 A ) . This is in agreement with work recently published where the authors claim that the majority of CENP - C is restricted to the inner kinetochore and not extending into the outer kinetochore ( Suzuki et al . , 2014 ) . The CENP - S results are even more striking , as they assign to CENP - S a new role as a kinetochore structural pillar . In agreement with this finding a previous study reported that CENP - S depletion caused the formation of a longer outer plate of the Chapter 4 : Results 165 kinetochore ( Amano et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , CENP - I depletion , although not causing a statistically significant increase in kinetochore unfolding , appeared to cause an increase in the constriction between chromatin layers . CENP - I has been recently linked to the spindle checkpoint , particularly to the recruitment of Mad1 through the RZZ complex ( Matson and Stukenberg , 2014 ) . I hypothesize that CENP - I could act like a spring in the kinetochore , allowing some ‘breathing’ in the structure so that checkpoint components can bind in the event of microtubule detachment . CENP - H depletion does not dramatically affect the structure of the kinetochore , however the change in kinetochore structure observed in CENP - H OFF samples might be related to a partial impairment in the localization of CENP - C , as previously described ( Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ) . One interpretation of our data and previous observations is that when CENP - H is depleted , only a fraction of CENP - C is retained at the kinetochore , and this fraction is sufficient to hold chromatin layers together within the kinetochore . Equally to CENP - H , effects of depletion of CENP - O on kinetochore structure are only marginal , however data in S . cerevisiae support a structural role of COMA complex ( CENP - O - P - Q - U - R complex homolog ) in the looping of centromere chromatin ( Anderson et al . , 2009 ) . This could explain the relatively mild effect that we were able to quantify . After performing multi - peak analysis on the conditional knockout and deletion cell lines the mean step of unfolding was calculated and found it to be " 450 nm ( Figure 4 . 16 ) . Depletion of CENP - C and CENP - S caused double or triple size steps of unfolding , supporting our model that predicts CENP - C and CENP - S to function as anchoring points between different layers of chromatin . By combining our novel data with classical measurements of nucleosome size we generated a model , which predicts that 50 kb of DNA are included into a chicken kinetochore . This number is remarkably close to the size of chromatin domains occupied by CENP - A in chicken neocentromeres , " 40 kb , ( Shang et al . , 2013 ) and to the amount of DNA in chicken kinetochores measured by quantitative fluorescent microscopy , " 50 - 60 kb , ( Ribeiro et al . , 2014 ) . This result is also very similar to new evidence in human cells , where the total number of CENP - A nucleosomes has been identified equal to 200 ( Bodor et al . , 2014 ) , therefore roughly 40 kb of chromatin Chapter 4 : Results 166 would be the amount of DNA predicted in this study to be at the kinetochore , if one excludes the H3 nucleosome fraction . In conclusion the present study provided , for the first time , strong evidence supporting the existence of a 500 nm repetitive chromatin unit at the base of chicken kinetochore structure , which includes a total amount of chromatin of 50 kb . A quantified difference in kinetochore organization between interphase and mitotic data - sets was also shown . Additional data on kinetochore structure in absence of members of the CCAN network highlighted a new role for CENP - S in contributing to kinetochore structure and confirmed CENP - C as an essential component for the maintenance of kinetochore architecture . In the future , this unfolding analysis could be extended to outer kinetochore components , to evaluate their role in kinetochore structure , and to post - translational modifications . In addition , the synergistic effect of simultaneous removal of CENP - C and CENP - S on centromere stretching could be studied . To take this project onto another level , it would be interesting to continue fiber analysis using correlative light - electron microscopy ( CLEM ) . This would potentially allow subnanometer measurements to be obtained . Chapter 5 : Results 167 5 Chapter 5 : C haracterisation of the novel kinetochore protein CENP - Z 5 . 1 Introduction Despite the large number of publications associated with kinetochore , there is still significant information missing regarding its organization and composition . In 2010 our laboratory identified a novel group of putative kinetochore proteins by performing SILAC mass - spectrometry on isolated prometaphase chromosomes ( Ohta et al . , 2010 ) . In this study , the use of several protein classifiers , combined with a ‘machine learning’ analysis , allowed the identification of 13 previously uncharacterised proteins . These proteins were described as kinetochore proteins from a cluster analysis and visualized at kinetochores during mitosis by microscopy . One of these bona fide kinetochore proteins is CENP - Z , also known as ZNF276 ( NCBI gene ID : 92822 ) . CENP - Z has two isoforms ( isoform a : 67 . 2 kDa ; isoform b : 59 . 8 kDa ) that contain identical sequences with the exception of the first 75 aa at N - terminus of the isoform A , which are missing from isoform b . Both isoforms contain an N - terminus zinc finger associated domain ( zf - AD ) and a C - terminus zinc finger domain Cys 2 His 2 ( C2H2 ) fold group ( Uniprot , Q8N554 ) . Interestingly , the presence of a zinc finger domain suggests a potential role of CENP - Z in DNA binding . Moreover , analysis of putative interactors of CENP - Z using a protein - interaction database such as BioGRID ( Stark et al . , 2006 ) , reported interactions in yeast two - hybrid screenings of CENP - Z with ZBTB8A and ATXN1 . ZBTB8A is a zinc finger protein , which , in turn , interacts with lysine acetyltransferase 7 ( KAT7 ) . Similarly , ATXN1 is a chromatin binding factor reported to interact with the acetyltransferase 6A ( KAT6A ) and the histone deacetylase 4 ( HDAC4 ) ( BioGRID ) . These observations suggest a role of CENP - Z in transcription regulation , making it an interesting candidate for investigating the role of transcription for kinetochore maintenance . In this chapter , an initial characterization of the unknown CENP - Z / ZNF276 is presented . Here , CENP - Z kinetochore localization was confirmed . A more detailed Chapter 5 : Results 168 look at CENP - Z sequence conservation and secondary structure indicated the presence of a highly conserved region of the protein at the C - terminus . Using bioinformatics tools , the sequence of CENP - Z was compared with an atlas of proteins , with known structures . It was predicted that CENP - Z C - terminus could fold as a region of the histone - lysine n - methyltransferase , PRDM9 , which catalyses trimethylation on H3K4 . Having confirmed CENP - Z kinetochore localization in mitosis , the predicted PRDM9 - like activity was tested . These results suggested a role of CENP - Z in modulating methylation states of lysine 4 of histone H3 . As histone methylation profile can affect CENP - A loading ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ; Kim et al . , 2012 ) , CENP - Z activity was tested for CENP - A recruitment at an ectopic chromosomal site . These last experiments demonstrated that CENP - Z is not necessary for CENP - A assembly . Furthermore , preliminary data showed that optimization of CENP - Z depletion by RNAi led to an accumulation of mitotic cells in prometaphase . Chapter 5 : Results 169 5 . 2 Results 5 . 2 . 1 Protein sequence conservation and secondary structure . Bioinformatics analyses of CENP - Z CENP - Z is an uncharacterised protein and has no literature available . Therefore , we performed conservation and structural analyses using different on line tools , in order to predict its function . The CENP - Z aa sequence for Homo sapiens , Mus musculus , Gallus gallus and Xenopus laevis were aligned using Jalview software ( Waterhouse et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 5 . 1 A ) . Jalview showed the percentage of sequence identity across species in different shades of blue , where darker blue indicates 100 % of identity and the colour progressively decrease in intensity for lower percentages of identity . The CENP - Z alignment revealed two conserved regions along the sequence of CENP - Z : the first region ( 81 - 92 aa ) is comprised into a zinc finger associated domain ( zf - AD , 79 - 153 aa ) ( Uniprot , Q8N554 ) , and the second conserved region is at the C - terminus of the protein , 410 - 581 aa residues , containing the zinc finger domain ( C2H2 , 434 - 577 ) ( Uniprot , Q8N554 ) ( Figure 5 . 1 A ) . This high level of conservation of these two regions suggests an essential function for the zinc finger domain of CENP - Z across vertebrates . To acquire information regarding CENP - Z structural elements , two different tools were used : the Psi - pred platform for secondary structure prediction ( Jones , 1999 ) and the PHYRE2 protein folding recognition server ( Kelley et al . , 2015 ) . The analysis performed using Psi - pred revealed that CENP - Z presents highly unstructured N - terminus and central regions ( Figure 5 . 1 B ) . By using the PHYRE2 server , a predicted model for CENP - Z structure was proposed comparing its protein sequence with the sequence of proteins whose structure is known . Specifically , the region of CENP - Z that includes 480 - 570 aa residues was predicted to fold as the zinc finger protein ZNF297b ( 26 % sequence identity between CENP - Z 480 - 570 aa and ZNF297b 4 - 107 aa , with 99 . 91 % of confidence in the prediction ( see section 7 . 2 ) ) . Moreover , the region of CENP - Z containing aa 347 - 578 was predicted to fold similarly to the histone - lysine n - methyltransferase PRDM9 ( 8 % sequence identity Chapter 5 : Results 170 Figure 5 . 1 . Bioinformatic analysis of CENP - Z protein sequence . A . Conservation analysis of CENP - Z sequence across vertebrates expressed as percentage of identity .

B . Secondary structure analysis of H . sapiens CENP - Z isoform a using the on - line platform for protein prediction Psi - pred . Information found in Uniprot or PHYRE2 on - line databases is also included in this diagram as follows : the protein sequence predicted to fold as a zf - AD domain is highlighted in green , as a C2H2 zinc finger domain in purple and as a PRDM9 - like lysine methyltransferase in red . Chapter 5 : Results 171 Chapter 5 : Results 172 between CENP - Z 347 - 578 aa and PRDM9 195 - 408 aa , with 99 . 93 % of confidence in the prediction ( see section 7 . 2 ) ) . PRDM9 is a methyltrasferase that contains C2H2 zinc fingers and catalyses a trimethylation on H3K4 . This activity has recently been linked to recombination hotspots in humans and mice meiosis ( Baudat et al . , 2010 ; Grey et al . , 2011 ; Hayashi et al . , 2005 ) . The SET domain is the catalytic domain that confers H3K4 trimethyl transferase activity to PRDM9 . This domain is found in the PRDM9 sequence comprised in 244 - 358 aa interval ( Uniprot , Q9NQV7 ) . Therefore , the PRDM9 SET domain ( 244 - 358 ) is included in the region of similarity identified by PHYRE2 between CENP - Z and PRDM9 ( 195 - 408 ) . These evidences suggest a possible trimethyl - transferase activity of CENP - Z on lysine 4 of histone H3 , potentially activating transcription at kinetochores . Chapter 5 : Results 173 5 . 2 . 2 CENP - Z localizes at kinetochores in mitosis Confirming the kinetochore localization of CENP - Z was necessary before proceeding with further functional studies . Since no antibodies are available for CENP - Z , to test CENP - Z localization it was necessary to fuse it with EGFP for expression in HeLa cells ( see section 2 . 2 . 5 ) . HeLa cells were transiently transfected with EGFP : CENP - Z isoform b ( 1620 bp ; 540 aa ) for 24 hours . Coverslips were fixed in 4 % PFA , washed in 1X PBS and processed for CENP - C immuno - staining following a standardised protocol , as described in section 2 . 6 . 1 . Results showed the presence of GFP : CENP - Z at kinetochores , co - localizing with CENP - C during mitosis ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . We also detected CENP - Z signal localising at the spindle poles ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . Here , the presence of CENP - Z is more likely due to the overexpression in HeLa cells . This could be further clarified , in future , by using an antibody specific for endogenous CENP - Z . The H3K4 trimethyl transferase activity predicted for CENP - Z ( PHYRE2 analysis in 5 . 2 . 1 ) together with CENP - Z kinetochore localization during mitosis could imply a modulation of histone methylation states as a kinetochore function for CENP - Z . Chapter 5 : Results 174 Figure 5 . 2 . CENP - Z localises at kinetochores during mitosis . Representative fluorescence images of HeLa cells expressing GFP : CENP - Z probed with anti CENP - C and anti tubulin antibodies are present . Alexa Fluor 647 ( far red , pseudo coloured in dark red ) and Alexa Fluor 594 ( red ) conjugated secondary antibodies , respectively , were used to detect signals from the primaries . DNA was counterstained with DAPI . Scale bar , 5 µ m . Chapter 5 : Results 175 5 . 2 . 3 Tethering CENP - Z to the HAC causes the removal of H3K4me2 The bioinformatics results on CENP - Z predicted that CENP - Z shares structural similarities with the histone - lysine n - methyltransferase PRDM9 . Since PRDM9 catalyses methylation changes on lysine 4 of histone H3 , I next tested whether CENP - Z was capable of the same catalytic activity . H3K4me2 has been found in the centromere chromatin ( Sullivan and Karpen , 2004 ) and it was later linked to centromeric transcription ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ) . Results from our laboratory showed that removal of H3K4me2 correlates with a decrease in centromeric transcripts at the alphoid tetO HAC ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ) . As previously described , the alphoid tetO HAC is constituted by an alternation of alpha satellite monomers , containing tetracycline operators ( TetO ) , and CENP - B boxes ( Kouprina et al . , 2012 ; Nakano et al . , 2008 ) . By expressing a TetR - EYFP fusion protein , this protein is tethered to the TetO sites on the HAC and visualised through the fluorescence of EYFP ( Figure 5 . 3 A ) . The effects of tethered protein / chromatin modifiers to the HAC can then be assayed via fluorescence microscopy . The alphoid tetO HAC contains high levels of H3K4me2 ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ) . Staining 1C7 cells for H3K4me2 showed a bright spot for this mark at the HAC , as identified by TetR - EYFP ( Figure 5 . 3 B , TetR - EYFP ) . Therefore , the alphoid tetO HAC represents an optimal system to test whether CENP - Z affects H3K4me2 upon tethering . CENP - Z isoform b was fused to TetR - EYFP and expressed in 1C7 cells in the following experiments . 1C7 cells were transfected either with TetR - EYFP ( control ) or with TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z . 48 hours post trasfection , samples were fixed and probed with anti H3K4me2 antibody . In control cells ( cells expressing TetR - EYFP only ) the HAC showed a bright signal for H3K4me2 ; in contrast , H3K4me2 signal on the HAC decreased after tethering TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z ( Figure 5 . 3 B ) . The levels of H3K4me2 were quantified after tethering the TetR fusion proteins using ImageJ and results were plotted in a graph ( Figure 5 . 3 C ) . Results showed that tethering TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z caused a significant decrease in the fluorescence of H3K4me2 at the HAC compared to the TetR - EYFP alone ( median values 0 . 99 and 1 . 83 respectively ; Chapter 5 : Results 176 Figure 5 . 3 . Reduced levels of H3K4me2 were observed at the HAC upon CENP - Z tethering . A . Diagram representing TetO array integrated into the HAC ( yellow ) in 1C7 cells . Upon transfection of TetR - EYFP fusion protein into the cells , the TetR ( orange ) will bind the TetO and the occurred binding can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy looking at the signal of the EYFP ( green ) . B . Representative fluorescence images of 1C7 cells transfected with TetR - EYFP and TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z . In both cases , cells were fixed and probed with anti H3K4me2 antibody . The signal was detected with Alexa Fluor 594 ( red ) conjugated secondary antibody . The HAC was recognised by the signal of the EYFP ( green ) . DNA was counterstained using DAPI ( blue ) . 3 X enlargements of the HAC are shown in the insets . Scale bars , 10 µ m . C . Quantification of H3K4me2 fluorescence intensity at the HAC from the experiment described in panel B was performed using ImageJ . Once found the best focal plane for the HAC in the EYFP channel , I moved to the H3K4me2 channel and drew a circular area of the diameter of 10 pixels around the HAC . H3K4me2 fluorescence was measured and next subtracted of the background fluorescence present outside the cell in a 10 pixels diameter area . This value obtained was then normalized for H3K4me2 fluorescence intensity present in the areas surrounding the HAC , by applying from 3 to 6 times the 10 pixel diameter area in the surroundings of the HAC and measuring H3K4me2 fluorescence intensity ; a mean of these values was calculated , which was next subtracted of the same background value as before . Finally HAC fluorescence value for H3K4me2 was divided for the mean value of the surrounding areas . Compared to TetR - EYFP only , tethering TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z caused a significant decrease in H3K4me2 on the HAC ( TetR - EYFP versus TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z , p < 0 . 0001 ; Mann - Whitney U test ) . Fluorescence intensities medians plus standard deviations are shown in the graph . Asterisks highlight statistical significance . For each sample 60 cells were analysed from two independent experiments . Chapter 5 : Results 177 Chapter 5 : Results 178 p < 0 . 0001 ) . In conclusion , these results suggested a role for CENP - Z in the modulation of H3K4 methylation states . 5 . 2 . 4 CENP - Z is not a CENP - A assembly factor The epigenetic environment at the centromere has been linked to CENP - A assembly and maintenance ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ; Kim et al . , 2012 ) . Since our previous results suggested a role of CENP - Z in chromatin modulation , we aimed to assess whether CENP - Z was involved in CENP - A loading at the centromere . For these experiments a HeLa cell line containing an alpha satellite array integrated into a chromosome arm ( HeLa 3 - 8 ) ( Ohzeki et al . , 2012 ) was used . This alphoid satellite integration contains TetO as the alphoid tetO HAC system described before ( section 5 . 2 . 3 ) . As before , isoform b of CENP - Z was used in these experiments . 48 hours post transfection , the TetR - EYFP fusion proteins were tethered to the integration where TetR and TetO tightly interact . In order to highlight the possible effect of CENP - Z on CENP - A assembly , a HeLa 3 - 8 cell line that ovexpressed CENP - A was used . Indeed in the presence of CENP - A overexpression it is easier to observe CENP - A ectopic recruitment when it occurs . In order to assess the potential role of CENP - Z as a CENP - A loading factor , a negative control ( TetR - EYFP empty vector ) and a positive control for CENP - A assembly ( TetR - EYFP : HJURP ) were included in the analysis . HJURP is a well characterised CENP - A chaperone and it is directly involved in CENP - A loading ( Dunleavy et al . , 2009 ; Foltz et al . , 2009 ) . HeLa 3 - 8 cells were transfected with TetR - EYFP , TetR - EYFP : HJURP or TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z for 48 hours . After fixation with 4 % PFA , cells were probed with anti CENP - A antibody . A minimum of 20 images of transfected interphase cells were acquired using a DeltaVision RT microscope ( Applied Precision ) . Representative images of transfected cells are shown in Figure 5 . 4 A . As in previous experiments , TetR - EYFP fusion proteins were identified by the EYFP signal at the integration . Fluorescence intensity of CENP - A was measured Chapter 5 : Results 179 Figure 5 . 4 . CENP - Z did not recruit CENP - A when tethered to a chromosome arm . A . Representative fluorescence images of HeLa 3 - 8 transfected with TetR - EYFP , TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z and TetR - EYFP : HJURP . In all the three cases , cells were fixed and probed with anti CENP - A antibody . The signal was detected with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody ( red ) . The integration was recognised by the signal of the EYFP ( green ) . DNA was counterstained using DAPI ( blue ) . Scale bar , 5 µ m . B . Quantification of CENP - A fluorescence intensity at the integration from the experiment described in panel A . For quantification purposes , a macro in ImageJ custom modified from Bodor et al . , 2014 was used ( section 7 . 1 ) , which was able to identify the integration spot and measure intensity of signals in CENP - A channel . Among the samples , HJURP is the best CENP - A recruiter ( TetR - EYFP : HJURP versus TetR - EYFP or TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z , p < 0 . 0001 ; Mann - Whitney U test ) . Tethering CENP - Z did not cause CENP - A loading when compared to the TetR empty vector ( TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z versus TetR - EYFP , p = 0 . 1058 ; Mann - Whitney U test ) . Fluorescence intensities medians plus standard deviations are shown in the graph . Asterisks highlight statistical significance . For each sample 45 cells were analysed in two independent experiments . Chapter 5 : Results 180 Chapter 5 : Results 181 was measured using a custom made macro in ImageJ modified from Bodor et al . , 2014 ( see section 7 . 1 ) . This macro automatically identifies the area of the integration and it measures the average signal present in this area in the CENP - A channel . Results of the quantification of CENP - A signal across the three conditions tested were plotted in a graph ( Figure 5 . 4 B ) . Tethering of TetR - EYFP did not prompt CENP - A recruitment to the array integration . Tethering of TetR - EYFP : HJURP caused a significant increase in the signal of CENP - A at the integration , compared to the TetR - EYFP only tethering experiment ( Figure 5 . 4 C , median values 0 . 893 and 0 . 079 respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Importantly , TetR - EYFP : CENP - Z tethering at the integration had no effects on the signal of CENP - A at the array integration compared to TetR - EYFP ( Figure 5 . 4 C , median values 0 . 104 and 0 . 079 respectively ; p = 0 . 1058 ) . These results demonstrated that CENP - Z is not involved in the CENP - A loading pathway . Collectively , these results suggest that CENP - Z modulate the methylation status of the centrochromatin , however this is not associated with CENP - A loading . In the future , experiments we will analyse whether this methylation control is associated with the maintenance of CENP - A . 5 . 2 . 5 Development of tools for CENP - Z detection and optimization of CENP - Z depletion Previous results showed that CENP - Z has an activity on H3K4me2 and it was also shown to localise at kinetochores in mitosis . Therefore , we wanted to perform depletion studies in order to identify possible phenotypes related to CENP - Z knockdown , giving indications of its function . However , the lack of a specific antibody for CENP - Z makes it difficult to study this protein , as it could only be visualised by ovexpression as a GFP fusion . To address this limitation we aimed to raise an anti CENP - Z antibody that will allow us to visualise and study endogenous CENP - Z . Anti - peptide monoclonal antibodies were synthetized by Abmart ( Shanghai ) Co . , Ltd . CENP - Z peptides were synthesised , expressed in E . coli , purified and injected into mice ( Abmart ) . Afterwards , 26 sample antibodies were received and tested , to clarify if any of them Chapter 5 : Results 182 could recognise CENP - Z by western blot . HeLa cells were transfected with GFP : CENP - Z for 24 hours after which a protein extract was prepared ( see section 2 . 3 . 1 ) . The protein extracts were run on a SDS - PAGE gel and , following the transfer , the membrane was blotted with each of the sample antibodies received . The predicted size of CENP - Z is 67 kDa ( Uniprot - Q8N554 ) , and the expected size of GFP : CENP - Z fusion protein is approximately 100 kDa . Nitrocellulose membranes were cut into 26 strips to test each of the antibodies . The presence of GFP : CENP - Z was used as a positive control . Therefore , strips number 3 , 11 and 24 were also incubated with anti GFP antibody . In addition , anti tubulin antibody was used as a control for protein loading in strips number 4 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 22 and 26 . Results of the immunoblot are shown in Figure 5 . 5 . Antibodies incubated with strips number 2 and 3 appeared to recognise a band of the correct size ( yellow box ) , also confirmed by the GFP antibody . Particularly , antibody n°2 ( incubated with strip 2 ) showed a high specificity for GFP : CENP - Z . However , no clear signal for endogenous CENP - Z ( 67 kDa ) was observed in any of the antibodies tested . This could be due to relatively low abundance of the endogenous protein compared to the exogenous one overexpressed . To study the localization of CENP - Z and its dynamics in different stages of cell cycle , without overexpressing the protein , Abmart antibody n°2 , which gave the best signal by western blotting ( Figure 5 . 5 ) , was subsequently tested by immunofluorescence . A range of fixation procedures ( Figure 5 . 6 A ) were used to prepare HeLa cell samples to perform immunofluorescences analysis where samples were incubated with n°2 CENP - Z antibody in combination with CENP - C or tubulin ( Figure 5 . 6 B 1 - 3 ) . No co - localization was found between CENP - C and CENP - Z antibodies , even after a pre - extraction of cytosol . Indeed , anti CENP - Z antibody appeared unfocused and diffused in the cytoplasm . With the aim of studying the role of CENP - Z at the kinetochore , several siRNA oligos were tested in order to assess the efficiency of CENP - Z depletion . Chapter 5 : Results 183 Figure 5 . 5 . CENP - Z anti - peptide antibodies screening . HeLa cells were transfected with GFP : CENP - Z and protein extracts were prepared after 24 hours of expression . Two 10 % polyacrylamide gels were loaded with 500 µ g of HeLa whole cell lysate each . After transfer , nitrocellulose membranes were cut into 26 vertical strips and each of them was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with a different antibody diluted in 1 : 200 in PBS - Tw20 0 . 05 % added of 3 % w / v of low fat milk . Membranes were incubated with Abmart test antibodies plus anti tubulin and anti GFP antibodies for two hours at room temperature . Signals were detected using IRDye® 680 and 800 conjugated secondary antibodies . The Li - Cor system was employed for signal acquisition . Light blue boxes highlight tubulin bands and yellow boxes were drawn at GFP : CENP - Z predicted size height . Chapter 5 : Results 184 Figure 5 . 6 . Testing Abmart antibody n°2 by immunofluorescence . Abmart antibody n°2 was tested on HeLa cells in immunofluorescence experiments . A .

Representative images of HeLa cells incubated with Abmart n°2 , CENP - C or tubulin primary antibodies .

No kinetochore signal of Abmart n°2 antibody was observed . Rows 1 , 2 and 3 in panel B are representative examples of the conditions illustrated in panel A 1 , 2 and 3 . Chapter 5 : Results 185 As the antibody currently available did not recognise the endogenous CENP - Z it was necessary to test RNAi oligos in cells transfected with GFP : CENP - Z . For RNAi oligo sequences against CENP - Z refer to Table 2 . 4 . HeLa cells were co - transfected with GFP : CENP - Z and either control siRNA or GFP : CENP - Z specific siRNAi oligos . Next , after 48 hours of knockdown , cells were pelleted and lysed . An equal amount of protein was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and western blotting analysis was performed to test the efficiency of CENP - Z depletion . The membrane was incubated with anti GFP antibody , to check for GFP : CENP - Z levels , and anti tubulin antibody was used , as a loading control . Results showed a good level of depletion achieved by RNAi oligo n°2 compared to the control levels in presence of scramble RNAi ( Figure 5 . 7 , top row ) . RNAi oligo n°4 showed a milder effect on the levels of GFP : CENP - Z , whereas oligos n° 0 , 1 and 3 did not affect GFP : CENP - Z levels . This analysis was validated by the observation of an equal sample loading as indicated by tubulin bands ( Figure 5 . 7 , top ) . Rabbit anti GFP antibody gave a high number of smaller size bands . These may be degradation products of GFP : CENP - Z combined with some unspecific binding of the GFP antibody already observed ( Figure 5 . 5 anti GFP blot ) , although this was not observed in the tubulin blot . This evidence suggested that CENP - Z might be an unstable protein . This correlates with the observation of unstructured regions at the N - terminus and central parts of the protein , as highlight by the Psipred analysis ( section 5 . 2 . 1 ) . In addition , as I was interested in clarifying the reliability of the mouse Abmart antibody n°2 for western blotting analysis , a second incubation was performed . This test showed that Abmart antibody n°2 is able to detect reduced levels of GFP : CENP - Z ( Figure 5 . 7 , bottom row ) , as its signal co - localise with the one of the GFP antibody ( yellow bands ) . Furthermore , a band at the predicted size of endogenous CENP - Z ( 67 kDa ) was recognised by this antibody ( yellow box ) . Since the membrane was not stripped the bands corresponding to tubulin were still visible ( light blue box ) . Having found the appropriate conditions for knocking down CENP - Z , an RNAi experiment to analyse the effects of this depletion on mitosis progression was performed . HeLa cells were transfected with control RNAi or CENP - Z specific oligo 2 for 48 hours . Next , cells were fixed in 4 % PFA and permeabilized . Samples were incubated with antibodies raised against a kinetochore marker , in this case ACA , and Chapter 5 : Results 186 Figure 5 . 7 . Immunoblot analysis of CENP - Z depletion . HeLa cells were transfected with GFP : CENP - Z and control RNAi or CENP - Z specific siRNA oligos . After 48 hours of transfection , cells were pelleted and lysed . Protein extracts were next loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel with , in each lane , the correspondent protein content of 4 X 10 5 cells . The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies raised against GFP and tubulin ( top raw ) or GFP and CENP - Z ( Abmart n°2 ) ( bottom raw , signal of the tubulin from previous hybridization is included in a light blue box ) . Signals were detected using IRDye® 680 and 800 conjugated secondary antibodies . The Li - Cor Odyssey system was used for signal acquisition . A yellow box includes predicted bands for endogenous CENP - Z , whilst a light blue box highlights tubulin bands across the samples . Chapter 5 : Results 187 tubulin . Microscopy analysis of 100 mitotic cells revealed the presence of a higher percentage of cells in prometaphase when CENP - Z was depleted , compared with control RNAi , as shown in Figure 5 . 8 A . Most of the chromosomes in cells transfected with CENP - Z RNAi were organised in a metaphase plate - like structure with the exception of fewer chromosomes that were not properly aligned in comparison with control RNAi treated cells . Mitotic defects needed to be quantified to reveal the effect of CENP - Z depletion in mitosis . Due to the difficulty of unambiguously categorizing a normal prometaphase and a ‘delayed’ one , all the prometaphase cells have been grouped together , assuming that if that particular conformation observed after 48 hour depletion was causing a delay in prometaphase , then a higher percentage of cells in prometaphase would have been observed . Counts confirmed this hypothesis showing an increase in the fraction of mitotic cells in prometaphase after 48 hours depletion , leading to a smaller number of cells in telophase / cytokinesis ( Figure 5 . 8 B ) . These preliminary results , suggest that CENP - Z might have a role in chromosome alignment . To further investigate this possible role of CENP - Z more replicas of the RNAi phenotype analysis and live cell imaging will be performed . To detect endogenous CENP - Z we attempted to generate our own antibody against CENP - Z . This work has been done in collaboration with Dr Maria Alba Abad , a post - doctoral researcher in Dr Jeyaprakash Arulanandam’s laboratory . Previous experiments showed that CENP - Z full - length protein is unstable and poorly expressed in bacteria ( Dr Maria Alba Abad , data not shown ) . Therefore , we decided to use 79 - 153 and 347 - 580 fragments of human CENP - Z as they showed higher yield of expression and , additionally , they contained the zf - AD and the zinc finger C2H2 domains ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . 79 - 153 and 347 - 580 fragments of human CENP - Z were expressed in E . coli BL21 Gold competent cells . CENP - Z 79 - 153 fragment was purified through a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) tag whereas 347 - 580 fragment had a poly - histidine ( His ) tag that was used for the purification ( Figure 5 . 9 A ) ( for CENP - Z fragment purification see section 2 . 3 . 5 . 1 and 2 . 3 . 5 . 2 ) . Samples , acquired at Chapter 5 : Results 188 Figure 5 . 8 . CENP - Z depletion study in mitotic human cells . A . Representative images of mitotic HeLa cells treated with control RNAi or CENP - Z RNAi oligo 2 . 50 % confluent coverslips with HeLa cells were transfected for 48 hours . Samples were next processed for immunofluorescence . Samples were incubated with primary antibodies raised against tubulin and kinetochore proteins , such as CENP - C and ACA . Signals were detected using Alexa Fluor 488 ( green ) and 594 ( red ) conjugated secondary antibodies . DNA was counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) . Scale bars , 5 µ m . B . Graph representing counts of 100 mitotic cells per samples , where cell numbers , scored for each category , are expressed in percentages . Chapter 5 : Results 189 each step of the purifications , were run on a polyacrylamide gel and the gel was stained with Comassie Blue in order to verify that each stage of the purification was successful ( Figure 5 . 9 C and D ) . The 79 - 153 protein fragment was soluble , as a band can be seen in the supernatant ( SP ) . A less intense band of the same size was observed in the flow - through ( FT ) . As expected , an enrichment of GST - 79 - 153 on the beads after the affinity purification step was also observed ( B * ) . After cleavage with 3C protease the fragment was released from the beads ( BA ) and collected into elutions ( E ) . The elutions contain the fragment with a size of " 8 kDa that corresponds to 79 - 153 ( Figure 5 . 9 C , yellow box ) . The 347 - 580 CENP - Z fragment was also soluble and , as previously , a band was observed in the supernatant ( SP ) and a less intense one in the flow - through ( FT ) . The fragment has a size of " 26 kDa ( Figure 5 . 9 D , yellow box ) and was present in the elutions ( E ) . After cleavage with 3C protease , a shift in the band was observed ( poolE cleaved ) , indicating that the His tag was cleaved . In total 920 µ g of 79 - 153 and 2 . 35 mg of 347 - 580 were purified . Next , 800 µ g of both fragments were run into a 15 % polyacrylamide gel and gels were stained by aqueous comassie for protein bands visualization ( Figure 5 . 9 E and F ) . Bands of the appropriate sizes ( yellow box ) were frozen and finely grounded for animal injection ( see section 2 . 3 . 6 ) . Concomitantly , pre - immune sera of 9 rabbits were tested by immunoblot on whole cell extracts of asynchronous or mitotic HeLa cells ( Figure 5 . 4 G ) . After this screen , rabbits n° 4 , 5 , 8 and 9 were chosen for the production of CENP - Z antibody as they presented the lowest levels of natural immunity ( fewest number of bands ) across the animals tested . Currently , I am awaiting for rabbit bleeds to test by immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiment for CENP - Z antibody specificity . Chapter 5 : Results 190 Figure 5 . 9 .

Chapter 5 : Results 191 Chapter 5 : Results 192 5 . 3 Discussion and conclusion The aim of this chapter was to gain new insights on the role of CENP - Z . CENP - Z / ZNF276 was one of the proteins identified in our laboratory five years ago as a putative kinetochore protein following mass - spectrometry analysis of isolated chromosomes ( Ohta et al . , 2010 ) . Despite the bioinformatic analysis applied to identify this new subset of CENP proteins , only one recent study has confirmed a genuine role in mitosis for CENP - 32 , which is required for normal mitotic spindle structure ( Ohta et al . , 2015 ) , therefore further studies have to be performed aiming to confirm the kinetochore localization and to test the function of these novel proteins . Despite the lack of literature and structured characterization of CENP - Z , we considered that reviewing the protein sequence would allow a prediction of possible mechanisms that CENP - Z could be involved in . Initially , information of functional domains contained in CENP - Z was found in NCBI and Uniprot databases . A predicted zinc finger domain C2H2 at the C - terminus and a predicted zf - AD at the N - terminus of CENP - Z were observed after bioinformatics analysis ( Figure 5 . 1 B ) . This result was interesting , as the zinc finger domains generally are associated with the binding of a protein to DNA and are common in transcription factors . Analysis of CENP - Z protein sequence conservation , in vertebrates , revealed high level of conservation in these two domains ( Figure 5 . 1 A ) , suggesting a conserved function for CENP - Z . Furthermore , the PHYRE2 server ( Kelley et al . , 2015 ) predicted that the C2H2 zinc finger domain region of CENP - Z folds similarly to a region of the PRDM9 methyltransferase ( Figure 5 . 1 B and 7 . 2 ) . PRDM9 catalyses the transfer of a methyl group to the di - methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 ( H3K4me2 ) , bringing H3K4 to a tri - methylated state ( H3K4me3 ) ( Hayashi et al . , 2005 ) . H3K4me2 is commonly associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin ( Ernst and Kellis , 2010 ) ; in contrast , H3K4me3 is a marker enriched at active promoters . The hypothesis that CENP - Z , which was visualized at kinetochore during mitosis ( Figure 5 . 2 ) , could activate transcription , puts forward the question : is transcription required for kinetochore function / stability ? It is already known that a decrease in levels of transcription is linked to kinetochore instability ( i . e . decreasing levels of kinetochore Chapter 5 : Results 193 proteins ) as an effect of the tethering of the lysine - specific de - methylating enzymes ( LSD1 / LSD2 ) ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ; Molina et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore it was important to test the predicted methyltransferase activity of CENP - Z . The alphoid tetO HAC presents high levels of H3K4me2 ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ) , and foci of enriched H3K4me2 were observed by immunofluorescence in 1C7 cells ( Figure 5 . 3 B ) . Therefore the alphoid tetO HAC represents a good system to visualise changes in this post - translation modification . Upon tethering of CENP - Z , fluorescence intensity of H3K4me2 on the HAC decreased ( Figure 5 . 3 C ) . This could be due to a change of H3K4me2 into H3K4me3 for the activity of CENP - Z as a PRDM9 methyltransferase . Importantly , experiments with a catalytically dead mutant CENP - Z would ensure the specificity of this effect . Moreover , experiments where fluorescence intensity of H3K4me3 is quantified after CENP - Z tethering , should be performed to confirm H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity of CENP - Z . In addition , testing the variation , if detectable , in the amount of transcripts at the TetO in CENP - Z tethering experiments and behaviour of representative CCAN components could be the focus of future experiments . If the hypothesis of CENP - Z trimethylating H3K4 to induce transcription at kinetochores will be confirmed , that would classify CENP - Z as a novel methyltransferase able to control transcription dynamics at the centrochromatin . As the epigenetic landscape can influence CENP - A assembly and kinetochore maintenance ( Bergmann et al . , 2011 ; Kim et al . , 2012 ) , the effects of CENP - Z tethering on a chromosome arm devoid of CENP - A were studied . However , no recruitment of CENP - A was prompted by CENP - Z activity at the alphoid tetO ectopic integration ( Figure 5 . 4 B ) . Finally , how does the depletion of CENP - Z affect cell division ? In order to answer to this question a main technical obstacle had to be overcome . So far , CENP - Z depletion ( Figure 5 . 7 ) was performed in cells that were also co - expressing GFP : CENP - Z as there was no specific antibody for CENP - Z . Down regulation of GFP : CENP - Z , upon treatment with a specific oligo , was visualized by using an anti GFP antibody . Detection trials of CENP - Z with an anti - peptide antibody , Abmart n°2 , were performed by western blotting ( Figure 5 . 5 and 5 . 7 ) and by Chapter 5 : Results 194 immunofluorescence ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . However , although this antibody gave satisfactory results by western blotting , proper localization could not be observed by immunofluorescence microscopy . This limits the study of endogenous CENP - Z cell localization and from performing further assays such as immunoprecipitation assays to identify CENP - Z interactors . Therefore , we are currently trying to generate our own antibody against CENP - Z , specifically against 79 - 153 and 347 - 580 fragments which can be highly expressed in bacteria and correspond to the zf - AD and the C2H2 zinc finger domain ( Figure 5 . 9 ) . Preliminary data collected from HeLa cells depleted of CENP - Z for 48 hours , analysed by microscopy , revealed an accumulation of mitotic cells in prometaphase ( Figure 5 . 8 A and B ) . The phenotype , described as prometaphases containing a metaphase plate - like structure , is similar to the one previously observed upon CENP - E ( Harborth et al . , 2001 ) and CENP - Q ( Bancroft et al . , 2015 ) knockdown by RNAi . However , CENP - Z depletion results need to be confirmed in order to determine the statistical significance of these changes . Next , a rescue experiment will be designed to rule out the possibility of off - target effects . Also , performing live cell imaging analysis will clarify the destiny of cells depleted of CENP - Z . Overall , in this chapter , I presented the optimisation of tools for analysing the unknown function of CENP - Z . Future experiments will be designed to clarify the role of CENP - Z on kinetochore structure and function . Chapter 6 : Conclusion and final perspectives 195 6 Conclusion and final perspectives Despite the extensive literature available on the kinetochore , key questions currently remain unanswered . As many kinetochore components ( > 100 proteins ) are known , it is yet to be confirmed how they assemble , relative to one another , at an ultra - structural level , to constitute a functional unit . At present two models were proposed for the structure of the inner kinetochore , one designed as the ‘amphipathic model’ and the second one named the ‘boustrophedon model’ . The purpose of this Ph . D . was to generate data that supports one of these models . To study the ultra - structure of the inner kinetochore chromatin I used fluorescence microscopy . Numerous sample preparations were tested and both wide - field fluorescence microscopy and super - resolution assayed while working on side projects . Unfolding centromere chromatin was the approach chosen to analyse centromere length , in several conditions , using wide - field fluorescence microscopy to acquire the data . Having optimised the ’modus operandi’ , analysis of chromatin fibers could begin . The first question tackled was the identification of differences in the kinetochore structure between interphase and mitosis . In order to generate a data - set statistically representative , for each sample a large number of fibers was acquired and measured in length . Importantly , with this study , we were able to quantify differences in the structure of the centromere with a resolution of 100 nm . In addition , the data - sets generated were additionally tested for the presence of peaks , using a multi - peak algorithm . Experimental evidence suggests the presence , within the inner kinetochore , of multiple chromatin units of 500 nm in both interphase and mitosis . We next exploited conditional knockout or deletion cell lines , generated in the same model system , in order to study changes in the kinetochore ultra - structure when isolated CCAN components were depleted . A major role in the maintenance of kinetochore structure for CENP - C and CENP - S , out of a list of more CENP proteins ( CENP - I , CENP - H and CENP - O ) , is supported by the data presented in this thesis . Strikingly , the same 500 nm long core unit was identified in the data - set of each of Chapter 6 : Conclusion and final perspectives 196 the depleted CCAN components , supporting the idea of a core module repeated to form a collection of loops of chromatin or chromatin planes piled on top of each other . Therefore which of the two models discussed here is best supported by the data presented in this thesis ? In mitotic cells the depletion of CENP - C or CENP - S suggests that these two proteins constitute two anchor points for centromere structure , and their absence caused an unfolding of chromatin , that is otherwise constricted into the typical centromere structure ( control mitotic sample ) . This novel insight supports the boustrophedon model where CENP - C and CENP - S could create a network of connections within the chromatin layers , supplying the structural support for the maintenance of inner kinetochore structure and act as intra - layer and inter - layer linkers . In addition , CENP - C has the dual role of both contributing to the structure of the centromere and also working as a platform for the outer kinetochore components , through its interaction with the Mis12 complex . Our hypothesis is that CENP - C in the inner centromere would be involved in keeping the structure together , possibly through its dimerization , whilst in the outer chromatin layers its N - terminus would extend outwards for the interaction with Mis12 . The presence of a different amount of steps of unfolding observed in different samples suggests that there could be intermediate steps of de - constructing the kinetochore , accomplished by a hierarchical system of complexity ( layers containing each sinusoidal patches of chromatin ) , already hypothesized ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . Lastly , estimating the length of chromatin included in each layer , allowed the prediction of the total number of nucleosomes residing in the kinetochore , at least in DT40 cells . The numbers obtained in our system are remarkably close to the work shown in other publications that use different approaches ( Bodor et al . , 2014 ; Ribeiro et al . , 2014 ; Shang et al . , 2013 ) . The loop model , or amphipathic model , does not easily adapt to the scenario just described . In terms of distribution of the proteins along the chromatin loop it would be difficult to explain how , for example CENP - C , could differentiate its function , as there would be more accessibility to the outer kinetochore components . Chapter 6 : Conclusion and final perspectives 197 A further complication derives from the amount of steps of unfolding observed in the data - sets . An argument , albeit unlikely , is that with the amphipathic model you could associate a loop with a core repetitive unit , however minimal unfolding obtained in control mitosis or in mitotic cells depleted of CENP - I , CENP - H or CENP - O could not be explained . What would determine how many loops to unfold if the loops are all the same ? More likely a structure with diverse levels of complexity could justify such behaviour . In the future it will be interesting to investigate the effect exerted by histone post - translation modifications on the overall structure of the inner centromere , or by analysing the additive effect of CENP - S and CENP - C simultaneous depletion . Challenging , however exciting , would be the combination of super - resolution microscopy with electron microscopy ( correlative PALM / EM ) for the visualization of unfolded centromeres . Combining these two high - resolution techniques it would be possible , for example , to visualize on centromere fibers how H3 and CENP - A nucleosomes are organized relatively to each other , or where newly loaded CENP - A nucleosomes are inserted along the centromere . Difficulties will be encountered in the preparation of the EM samples as the sectioning of a thin specimen like chromatin fibers is not trivial . The final part of this thesis attempted to characterize CENP - Z . CENP - Z was identified five years ago in the Earnshaw laboratory and visualized at kinetochores during mitosis . CENP - Z is an interesting kinetochore protein to study as it by contains a zinc finger domain and a zinc finger associated domain , which are common features of DNA interacting proteins . It was found to interact with lysine acetyl transferases ( KAT ) and one histone deacetylase ( HDAC4 ) , which are both involved in transcription regulation . An additional bioinformatic approach was used to analyse CENP - Z aa sequence revealing the presence of a large portion of the protein at the C - terminus , highly conserved across vertebrates , predicted to fold with 99 . 93 % of confidence , similarly to PRDM9 . PRDM9 catalyses the transfer of one methyl group to H3K4me2 , generating H3K4me3 , which is a mark for transcription initiation . The region of PRDM9 that was found similar to CENP - Z includes its catalitic domain , suggesting that CENP - Z could present the same methyl transferase Chapter 6 : Conclusion and final perspectives 198 activity . To further investigate this aspect , tethering studies at the Human Artificial Chromosome ( HAC ) were performed . This system was indeed the best to studies effects on H3K4me2 upon tethering chromatin modifiers , as it presents one foci of enrichment for this mark . The results presented here showed that , upon tethering of CENP - Z , H3K4me2 fluorescence intensity at the HAC significantly decreased . Our hypothesis is that CENP - Z catalyses a change from H3K4me2 to H3K4me3 . Therefore , future CENP - Z tethering experiments will be performed where levels of H3K4me3 will be measured at the HAC . This is potentially very exciting piece of data , as , if confirmed , it would imply that CENP - Z can modulate transcription initiation at kinetochore in mitosis . Additionally , CENP - Z depletion was optimised by RNAi . Preliminary analysis of the phenotypes found in mitosis revealed a block in prometaphase . Future work will be , on the short - term , focused in the screening of rabbit sera for a specific antibody able to recognised endogenous CENP - Z and to repeating the analysis of mitotic phenotypes upon CENP - Z depletion . Also , more tethering experiments to the HAC will be performed in order to clarify whether CENP - Z is or isn’t a methyl transferase specific for H3K4me2 . On the long - term , provided that a specific antibody will be obtained , it would be interesting to try affinity purifications combined with mass - spectrometry in order to identify interacting partners and analyse the amount of transcripts at the HAC to confirm or deny a role in transcription . Ultimately , as CENP - Z is also present in Gallus gallus , it would be interesting to deplete CENP - Z in DT40 cells and perform fiber analysis to test for any effects on kinetochore ultra - structure . In conclusion , the data presented in this thesis was the first to identify an organised array of 500 nm layers of chromatin at the inner kinetochore ; the first to uncover a new role of CENP - C and CENP - S in holding together centromere structure , contributing with novel insights to the field of kinetochore structure . Finally , this thesis has also provided data suggesting that the novel kinetochore protein CENP - Z could be a PRDM9 - like methyl transferase and having a potential effect on transcription at the kinetochore .
