The paper focuses on the classiﬁcation of offensive tweets written in Hinglish language , which is a portmanteau of the Indic language Hindi with the Ro - man script . The paper introduces a novel tweet dataset , titled Hindi - English Offen - sive Tweet ( HEOT ) dataset , consisting of tweets in Hindi - English code switched language split into three classes : non - offensive , abusive and hate - speech . Fur - ther , we approach the problem of classiﬁ - cation of the tweets in HEOT dataset us - ing transfer learning wherein the proposed model employing Convolutional Neural Networks is pre - trained on tweets in En - glish followed by retraining on Hinglish tweets . 1 Introduction The rampant use of offensive content on social media is destructive to a progressive society as it tends to promote abuse , violence and chaos and severely impacts individuals at different levels . Offensive text can be broadly classiﬁed as abu - sive and hate speech on the basis of the context and target of the offense . Hate speech ( Schmidt and Wiegand , 2017 ) is an act of offending , insult - ing or threatening a person or a group of similar people on the basis of religion , race , caste , sexual orientation , gender or belongingness to a speciﬁc stereotyped community . Abusive speech categor - ically differs from hate speech because of its ca - sual motive to hurt using general slurs composed of demeaning words . Both abusive as well as hate speech are sub - categories of offensive speech . Freedom of expression is one of the most ag - gressively contested rights of the modern world . While censorship of free moving online content such as Twitter tweets curtails the freedom of speech , but unregulated opprobrious tweets dis - courage free discussions in the virtual world ( Silva et al . , 2016 ) . Hate speech detection is a hard re - search problem because of ambiguity in the clear demarcation of offensive , abusive and hateful tex - tual content due to variations in the way people ex - press themselves in a linguistically diverse social setting . A major challenge in monitoring online content produced on social media websites like Twitter , Facebook and Reddit is the humongous volume of data being generated at a fast pace from varying demographic , cultural , linguistic and reli - gious communities . A major contributor to the tremendously high offensive online content is Hinglish ( Sreeram and Sinha , 2017 ) , which is formed of the words spo - ken in Hindi language but written in Roman script instead of the Devanagari script . Hinglish is a pro - nunciation based bi - lingual language that has no ﬁxed grammar rules . Hinglish extends its grammatical setup from na - tive Hindi accompanied by a plethora of slurs , slang and phonetic variations due to regional in - ﬂuence . Randomized spelling variations and mul - tiple possible interpretations of Hinglish words in different contextual situations make it extremely difﬁcult to deal with automatic classiﬁcation of this language . Another challenge worth consider - ation in dealing with Hinglish is the demographic divide between the users of Hinglish relative to to - tal active users globally . This poses a serious lim - itation as the tweet data in Hinglish language is a small fraction of the large pool of tweets gen - erated , necessitating the use of selective methods to process such tweets in an automated fashion . We aim to solve the problem of detecting offen - sive Hinglish tweets through the development of a deep learning model that analyses the input text and segregates them as : 1 . Not Offensive 2 . Abusive 3 . Hate - Inducing A dataset of manually annotated Hinglish tweets is used to measure the performance of the proposed framework . The experimentation con - sists of two phases , the ﬁrst of which investi - gates the semantic correlation of Hindi - English code switched language with native English lan - guage and proposes a dictionary - based translation of Hinglish text into Roman English text . Next , we analyze the performance of the semantically similar but syntactically different tweets obtained via transliteration and translation on a pre - trained Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) and pro - pose improvements to the classical hate speech classiﬁcation methodology through the transfer of previously learned features by the CNN . The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows : • Creation of an annotated dataset of Hinglish tweets • Experimentation of transfer learning based neural networks for classifying tweets in Hinglish language as abusive , hate - inducing or non - Offensive . 2 Related Work The voluminous data present on Twitter ne - cessitates identiﬁcation , ranking and segregation of event - speciﬁc informative content from the streams of trending tweets ( Mahata et al . , 2015 ) . Orsini ( 2015 ) dates the origin of Hinglish as an informal language to postcolonial Indian soci - ety . Several work like that done by Dwivedi and Sukhadeve ( 2010 ) attempted to translate Hindi - English language into pure English . However , the major challenge in this case is that the grammati - cal rules of Hinglish are gravely uncertain and user dependent . One of the earliest efforts in hate speech de - tection can be attributed to Spertus ( 1997 ) who had presented a decision tree based text classiﬁer for web pages with a remarkable 88 . 2 % accu - racy . Contemporary works on Yahoo news pages were done Sood et al . ( 2012 ) and later taken up by Yin et al . ( 2016a ) . Xiang et al . ( 2012 ) detected offensive tweets using logistic regression over a tweet dataset with the help of a dictionary of 339 offensive words . Offensive text classiﬁcation in other online textual content have been tried pre - viously for other languages as well like German ( Ross et al . , 2017 ) and Arabic ( Mubarak et al . , 2017 ) . However , despite the various endeavors by language experts and online moderators , users continue to disguise their abuse through creative modiﬁcations that contribute to multidimensional linguistic variations ( Clarke and Grieve , 2017 ) . Badjatiya et al . ( 2017 ) used CNN based classi - ﬁers to classify hateful tweets as racist and sex - ist . Park and Fung ( 2017 ) introduced a combina - tion of CharCNN and WordCNN architectures for abusive text classiﬁcation . Gamb¨ack and Sikdar ( 2017 ) explored four CNN models trained on char - acter n - grams , word vectors based on semantic information built using word2vec , randomly gen - erated word vectors , and word vectors combined with character n - grams to develop a hate - speech text classiﬁcation system . Mahata et al . ( 2018 ) experimented with multi - channel CNN , BiLSTM and CNN + BiLSTM models for identifying spe - ciﬁc posts from a large dataset of Twitter posts . Another interesting attempt in the same direc - tion was made by Pitsilis et al . ( 2018 ) through an ensemble model of Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN ) classiﬁers . 3 Dataset Table 1 shows the tweet distribution in English dataset A provided byDavidson et al . ( 2017 ) and the manually created Hinglish dataset HEOT . Dataset A consists of 14509 tweets such that 7274 are non - offensive , 4836 are abusive and 2399 are hate - inducing tweets . The imbalance of dataset is Label Dataset A Dataset HEOT Non - Offensive 7274 1414 Abusive 4836 1942 Hate - inducing 2399 323 Total 14509 3679 Table 1 : Tweet distribution in dataset A and HEOT . encouraged to represent a realistic picture usually seen on social media websites . Dataset HEOT was created using the Twit - ter Streaming API by selecting tweets in Hindi - English code switched language by data min - ing speciﬁc profane words in Hinglish language . The tweets were collected during the months of November - December 2017 and were crowd - sourced to ten NLP researchers for annotation and veriﬁcation . The data repository thus created con - sists of 3679 tweets out of which the count of non - offensive , abusive and hate - inducing tweets is 1414 , 1942 and 323 respectively and categorized similar to the previous dataset . Dataset HEOT is considerably small as compared to dataset A , but this abnormality is rather advantageous for our re - search . It is a common observation that online users who identify to a particular demographic subdivision are often a small percentage of the total active users . This restriction of the size of Hinglish corpus closely represents a true world scenario where the relative balance of standard and indigenous users is naturally skewed . Care was taken to ensure that the tweets having insuf - ﬁcient textual content were not incorporated into the dataset . An illustration of the three types of tweets is presented below to explain the contextual mean - ing of each class label in different languages . The tweets in category 1 , 2 and 3 are non - offensive , abusive and hate - inducing respectively . In the ex - amples given here , each tweet belonging to class A and B is in English and Hinglish language respec - tively . The tweets that fall under class C exemplify the corresponding version of Hinglish tweets after transliteration , translation and preprocessing . 1 . ( a ) We all are going outside ? http : / / t . . . ( b ) Hum sab ghumne jaa rahe hain ? http : / / t . . . ( c ) we all outside go are 2 . ( a ) @ username1 B * tch !

( 2014 ) , while the Hindi to Ro - man English translation was achieved by using the Hindi - English dictionary sourced from CFILT , IIT Bombay 1 . A crowdsourced list of 208 pro - fane Hinglish words along with their spelling vari - ations , regional dialects , homonyms and contex - tual variants were added to the corpus of 7193 word - pairs to be used for all the Hinglish to En - glish tweet conversions discussed in this paper . 4 Methodology 4 . 1 Preprocessing The tweets obtained from data sources were chan - neled through a pre - processing pipeline with the ultimate aim to transform them into semantic fea - ture vectors . The transliteration process was broken into in - termediate steps : 1 . Removal of punctuations , URLs and user mentions . 2 . Replacement of hashtags with corresponding plain text . 3 . Replacement of emoticons with appropriate textual descriptions sourced from the list pro - vided by Agarwal et al . ( 2011 ) . 4 . Conversion of all tweets into lower case . 5 . Removal of useless words providing little textual information using stop words ob - tained from Gensim ( Rehurek and Sojka , 2011 ) . 6 .

Transformation of pre - processed tweets into a word vector representation through Glove ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) pre - trained vec - tor embeddings . The version of Glove pre trained word vectors used in our case was Twitter ( 2B tweets , 27B tokens , 1 . 2M vocab , uncased , 200d , 1 . 42 GB download ) . 8 . The ﬁnal step in tweet transformation was the creation a word vector sequences that can be fed into the neural network architecture . 4 . 2 Transfer Learning Transfer learning ( Pan and Yang , 2010 ) is a ma - chine learning paradigm that refers to knowledge transfer from one domain of interest to another , with the aim to reuse already learned features in learning a specialized task . The task from which the system extracts knowledge is referred to as source task while the task which beneﬁts is termed as target task . Such representation learning sys - tems are used in cases where the feature space and distribution of input are similar so as to get maxi - mum beneﬁt from the knowledge transfer exercise . Another pertinent role of transfer learning is data reclassiﬁcation without overﬁtting in cases where data extraction restraints the size of training data . Bengio ( 2012 ) put emphasis on two predomi - nant cases which are well suited for the applica - tion of transfer learning . The ﬁrst case is when the class labels of source and target task vary but the input distribution is same . The other is when the class labels are similar but the input distribu - tion varies . The proposed problem of hate speech detection in Hinglish tweets is a classic example of the second case due to the semantic parallelism between English and translated Hinglish language , despite the eventual grammatical disassociation when Hinglish is transliterated into Roman script . Transfer learning provides relative performance increase at a reduced storage and computational cost . Pan and Yang ( 2010 ) gave a mathematical def - inition of transfer learning and justiﬁed use cases for application of transfer learning . Let domain D consist of two components : a feature space X and a marginal probability distribution P ( X ) , where X = { x 1 , x 2 , · · · , x n } ∈ X , X is the space of all individual word vectors representing the input text , x i is the i th vector corresponding to some tweet and X is a particular learning sample . A task consists of two components : a label space Y and an objective predictive function f ( ˙ ) , repre - sented as T = { Y , f ( ˙ ) } , which is not observed but can be learned from the training data , which con - sists of pairs ( x i , y i ) , where x i ∈ X and y i ∈ Y . In the experiments , Y is the set of all labels for a multi - class classiﬁcation task , and y i is one of three class labels . Figure 1 shows the architec - ture of convolutional neural network used in the experiments throughout the paper . CNN models pre - trained on English dataset learn low - level fea - tures of the English language . The last few layers are removed and then replaced with fresh layers keeping the initial convolutional layers frozen and retrained on dataset HEOT where it learns to ex - Figure 2 : Transfer learning technique used for Ternary Trans - CNN model tract intricate features due to syntax variations in pre - processed Hinglish text . 5 Proposed Approach The authors have put forward an experimental schema for Hinglish hate speech classiﬁcation , termed as Ternary Trans - CNN model . 5 . 1 Ternary Trans - CNN Model Ternary Trans - CNN model aims to achieve the three - label classiﬁcation of Hinglish tweets using transfer learning on a pre - trained CNN architec - ture depicted in Figure 2 . The model is trained successively on English dataset A and Hinglish dataset HEOT . We have empirically chosen em - bedding dimension to be 200 . The proposed CNN architecture consists of 3 layers of Convo - lutional1D layers having ﬁlter size 15 , 12 and 10 respectively and kernel size ﬁxed to 3 . The last two layers are dense fully - connected layers with size 64 and 3 units and the activation function as Rectiﬁed Linear Unit ( ReLU ) ( Maas et al . , 2013 ) and ’Softmax’ respectively . The loss function used is categorical cross - entropy on account of multi - label classiﬁcation role of the model . We used Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) The batch size was experimented from size 8 to 256 using grid search . Similarly , the number of epochs were chosen by exploring different values from 10 to 50 . The number of trainable and static layers varied to get the best combination giving optimal results . To ensure that the models do not overﬁt , dropout layers after the dense layers were Dataset A HEOT ( w / o TFL ) HEOT ( TFL ) Accuracy ( % ) 75 . 40 58 . 70 83 . 90 Precision 0 . 672 0 . 556 0 . 802 Recall 0 . 644 0 . 473 0 . 698 F1 Score 0 . 643 0 . 427 0 . 714 Table 2 : Results for Ternary Trans - CNN task : non - offensive , abusive and hate - inducing tweet clas - siﬁcation on datasets A , HEOT without transfer learning ( w / o TFL ) and HEOT with transfer learning ( TFL ) introduced to enhance generalization of the sys - tems . The Ternary Trans - CNN model is initially trained on 11509 training data points and tested on 3000 data points that were randomly split from the parent dataset A . The batch size is set to 128 for 25 epochs with all layers as trainable . The same model is retrained , keeping only last two layers as trainable and other layers frozen , on dataset HEOT which is split into 2679 training and 1000 testing examples . The batch size was decreased to 64 with epochs reduced to 10 for minimum training loss and the metric measurements were recorded in Ta - ble 2 for further comparative analysis . 6 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS The results of Ternary Trans - CNN model were compiled in terms of accuracy , F1 score , preci - sion , and recall by choosing macro metrics as the class imbalance is not severe enough to strongly bias the outcomes . The CNN model was ini - tially trained on dataset A and its performance on it taken as the baseline . Testing the same model on dataset HEOT without transfer learning reports downfall in model performance as com - pared to the baseline which is justiﬁed because the Hinglish tweets in dataset HEOT suffer from syn - tactic degradation after transliteration and transla - tion which leads to a loss in the contextual struc - turing of the tweets . After retraining the Trans - CNN model , the model performance on dataset HEOT not only improves signiﬁcantly but also surpasses the earlier results on dataset A . Thus , we can safely conclude that there was a positive transfer of features from source to target data . 7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This work demonstrates various CNN based mod - els for multi - class labeling of offensive textual tweets . An important contribution of the paper is to analyze informal languages on social me - dia such as Hinglish for hate speech and sug - gest ways to transform them into English text for the purpose of natural language processing . The dataset provided is an optimistic step in contribu - tion to the study of code - switched languages such as Hinglish that play a major role in online social structuring of multi - linguistic societies . The ex - periments prove that a positive transfer of knowl - edge and characteristics between two congruent domains is made possible by training , freezing and retraining the models from source to target tasks . The success of transfer learning for analyz - ing complex cross linguistic textual structures can be extended to include many more tasks involving code - switched and code - mixed data . The future efforts can be directed towards ﬁne - tuning the neural network models using boost - ing methods such as gradient boosting ( Badjatiya et al . , 2017 ) . The experiments here used CNN models for primary training , but other types of deep learning models like LSTM have also been known to show a high afﬁnity for semantic tasks such as sentiment analysis ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) and sentence translation ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ) . An - other possible approach to ﬁne - tune the classiﬁ - cation can be to use a stacked ensemble of shal - low convolutional neural network ( CNN ) models as shown by Friedrichs et al . ( 2018 ) . In recent years , leveraging multimodal infor - mation in several multimedia analytics problem has shown great success ( Shah , 2016a , b ; Shah and Zimmermann , 2017 ) . Thus , in the future , we plan to exploit multimodal information in offensive lan - guage detection since the most of existing sys - tems work in unimodal settings . Moreover , since offensive language is closely related with senti - ments , keywords ( or hashtags ) , and some asso - ciated events , we would also like to explore as - pects ( Jangid et al . , 2018 ) , tag relevance ( Shah et al . , 2016a , b ) , and events ( Shah et al . , 2015a , 2016c ) for the present problem . Furthermore , we would like extend our work to build an of - fensive video segmentation system ( Shah et al . , 2014a , 2015b ) in order to ﬁlter abusive and hate - inciting videos on social media . Since offensive code - switched languages are heavily inﬂuenced by region ( i . e . , location ) , we would try to ex - ploit the location information of videos as well in our extended work ( Shah et al . , 2014b , c ; Yin et al . , 2016b ) . Finally , since relative positions of words play a pivotal role in analyzing Hindi , we would like explore such possibilities in our future work ( Shaikh et al . , 2013a , b ) .
