One such PRR is the flagellin receptor FLS2 in Arabidopsis . Here , we demonstrate that a functional fusion of FLS2 to the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) resides in cell membranes of most tissues . Stimulation with the flagellin epitope flg22 induces its transfer into intracellular mobile vesicles , followed by degradation . FLS2 internalization depends on cytoskeleton and proteasome functions , and receptor activation . A variant FLS2 mutated in Thr 867 , a poten - tial phosphorylation site , binds flg22 normally , but is impaired in flg22 responses and FLS2 endocytosis . We propose that plant cells regulate pathogen - associated molecular pattern ( PAMP ) - mediated PRR activities by subcellular compartmentalization .

A key aspect of the eukaryotic innate immune system is the recognition of pathogen - associated molecular pat - terns ( PAMPs ) , universally conserved patterns in whole classes of microbes , mediated by germline encoded , non - rearranging receptors , the so - called pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) ( Gordon 2002 ) . In vertebrates , the most important PRRs are the Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , of which 11 have been identified to date . PAMP recognition through TLRs induces a conserved host defense response including production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobials . Furthermore , TLR signaling influences phagocytosis and triggers adaptive immunity ( Pasare and Medzhitov 2004 ; Underhill and Ganter 2004 ) . Mamma - lian TLR5 influences host susceptibility to infection through recognition of the bacterial flagellin protein , the main subunit building the flagellar structure ( Smith et al . 2003 ) . In plants , the paradigm for a PRR is the well - charac - terized FLS2 receptor kinase ( Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ; Asai et al . 2002 ; Zipfel et al . 2004 ) . Arabidopsis FLS2 mediates flagellin recognition on the basis of the highly conserved flg22 peptide ( Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ; Chinchilla et al . 2006 ) . Interestingly , the epitope recog - nized by mammalian TLR5 is different ( Smith et al . 2003 ; Chinchilla et al . 2006 ) . Perception of flg22 by FLS2 leads almost immediately to the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , protein phosphorylation , mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase signaling , and transcrip - tional gene induction ( Felix et al . 1999 ; Asai et al . 2002 ; Zipfel et al . 2004 ) . Recent work has shown that flagellin perception is essential for efficient host defense , since fls2 mutant plants exhibit an enhanced disease suscep - tibility to bacterial infections ( Zipfel et al . 2004 ) . Besides basal immunity , plants contain a specific defense system based on the detection of pathogen - derived race - specific avirulence factors ( Avr ) through corresponding products of resistance ( R ) genes . Recently , RIN4 , a key regulator of R - gene - mediated defense , has been shown to also modu - late flg22 signaling ( Kim et al . 2005 ) . Thus , both basal and specific immune signaling pathways in plants appear to be linked . Obviously , TLR signaling needs to be kept in check by negative regulation . Several negative regulators of TLR signaling have been recently described , which function on different levels , for example , through extracellular PAMP scavengers , cytosolic adapter proteins , or trans - membrane protein regulators , or by down - regulation of TLR expression ( Liew et al . 2005 ) . Although FLS2 - trig - gered immune responses in plants are well characterized , it is not yet clear how FLS2 signaling is attenuated . FLS2 belongs to the large receptor - like kinase ( RLK ) family with ∼ 610 members in Arabidopsis ( Shiu and Bleecker 2001 ) . One possibility for down - regulating RLK signaling in plants is the kinase - associated protein phosphatase ( KAPP ) , which has been identified to interact with sev - eral RLKs including FLS2 ( Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ; Becraft 2002 ) . In addition , since RLKs are structurally related to receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) in animals ( Shiu and Bleecker 2001 ) , mechanisms established for RTKs could also take place for RLKs . Attenuation of RTK signaling can be achieved by internalization of the receptors , either constitutively or selectively upon li - gand binding ( Katzmann et al . 2002 ) . The occurrence of endocytic processes in plants has been discovered only recently , including the possibility of constitutive RLK internalization ( Shah et al . 2002 ; Russinova et al . 2004 ; Gifford et al . 2005 ) . However , nothing is known about ligand - mediated receptor endo - cytosis in plants . Here , we use labeling of the FLS2 re - ceptor with the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) in order to demonstrate cell membrane localization of the FLS2 receptor and its specific , ligand - induced internalization . FLS2 accumulates in intracellular vesicles that are traf - ficking within the cell and likely target FLS2 for degra - dation . We also show that a potentially phosphorylated threonine residue in the juxta membrane region of the receptor is required for both signaling and endocytosis , indicating a close relationship between the two pro - cesses . Results and Discussion We transformed the Arabidopsis ecotype Ws - 0 , an fls2 mutant ( Zipfel et al . 2004 ) , with a construct encoding FLS2 fused to GFP with a myc - linker under the control of its native promoter ( Ws - 0 / FLS2 - GFP ) . Transgenic lines exhibited expression of the full - length FLS2 - GFP [ Keywords : Endocytosis ; FLS2 ; innate immunity ; PAMP ; RLK ] 1 Present address : Max - Planck - Institut für Züchtungsforschung , Carl - von - Linné - Weg 10 , 50829 Köln , Germany . 2 Corresponding author .

GENES & DEVELOPMENT 20 : 537 – 542 © 2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890 - 9369 / 06 ; www . genesdev . org 537 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 6 , 2008 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from fusion protein ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . Transgenic FLS2 - GFP and endogenous FLS2 were expressed with similar abundance ( data not shown ) . Expression of FLS2 - GFP restored normal specific flg22 binding in Ws - 0 ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) , and the whole array of full flg22 responses , as lines expressing FLS2 - myc only ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1C ; data not shown ) . Thus , the FLS2 - GFP fusion protein is biologically equivalent to native FLS2 in every respect , making it perfectly suited for localiza - tion studies . Confocal microscopy revealed that the FLS2 - GFP fu - sion protein was expressed in roots , rosette leaves , stems , and flower petals , and that it was localized at the cell periphery ( Fig . 1 ) . In leaves , expression occurred in mesophyll and epidermal cells as well as in the guard cells lining the stomata , the possible entry sites for in - vading bacteria ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Obviously , plants are con - stantly ready to detect flagellin , and thus to trigger an immediate early defense response upon a bacterial inva - sion . In fact , it has been demonstrated that FLS2 plays a role in the first line of host defense ( Zipfel et al . 2004 ) . Plasmolysis experiments showed a retraction of the fluo - rescence signal associated with the cell membrane and with Hechtian strands ( Fig . 1G ) . This is consistent with the function of FLS2 as a surface receptor recognizing an extracellular ligand , and is in agreement with its RLK structure and biochemical ligand - binding studies ( Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ) . Interestingly , senescent leaves did not exhibit FLS2 expression ( data not shown ) . We next tested the effect of the ligand flg22 on FLS2 localization . Young rosette leaves were preincubated in water for 30 min , treated with flg22 , and then subjected to confocal microscopy . Within 20 – 40 min of flg22 treat - ment , the fluorescent signal disappeared from the cell membrane . Instead , numerous distinct fluorescently la - beled vesicles occurred underneath the cell membrane , both in epidermal cells and in mesophyll cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Prolonged incubation led to a complete loss of the GFP signal , suggesting disappearance of the internalized FLS2 - GFP fusion protein ( Fig . 2B ) . Similarly , a pulse treatment with flg22 for 20 min followed by intense washing and a further incubation for 10 min revealed the occurrence of intracellular vesicles . However , within 75 min , the FLS2 - GFP signal in the cell membrane was al - most back to its original level ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , upon with - drawal of flg22 , the cell membrane was replenished with FLS2 - GFP . This replenishment was completely blocked by cycloheximide ( CHX ) , indicating that it was based on de novo protein synthesis rather than vesicle recycling ( Fig . 2C ) . We suggest that FLS2 , upon interaction with an agonist - active ligand , is subject to degradation via endo - cytosis and lysosomal and / or proteasomal pathways . Furthermore , we addressed the specificity of flg22 - induced FLS2 internalization . The inactive variant flg22 A . tum , derived from the sequence of Agrobacterium tumefaciens flagellin ( Felix et al . 1999 ) , did not affect FLS2 - GFP localization ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , the antago - nistic peptide flg22 (cid:1) 2 ( Bauer et al . 2001 ) failed to induce FLS2 internalization , and interestingly , a slight increase of the FLS2 - GFP cell membrane signal could be ob - served . It is possible that the binding of an antagonist inhibits a constitutive turnover / recycling mechanism . A Figure 2 . Dynamics of FLS2 localization in response to flg22 .

Robatzek et al . 538 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 6 , 2008 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from simultaneous treatment of flg22 and flg22 (cid:1) 2 at the same concentration led to fluorescence signals in cell mem - branes and intracellular vesicles ( Fig . 3 ) , as expected in view of the competitive behavior of the two peptides ( Bauer et al . 2001 ) . No accumulation of FLS2 - GFP in vesicles was observed when leaves were incubated with the peptide elicitor elf26 ( Fig . 3 ) , a PAMP recognized by a different receptor ( Kunze et al . 2004 ; G . Kunze , D . Chinchilla , and D . Felix , unpubl . ) . Since the responses to elf26 and flg22 are almost identical ( Kunze et al . 2004 ) , FLS2 - GFP internalization is not due to cellular changes such as ion fluxes or the formation of ROS induced by PAMPs in general but strictly depends on binding of the ligand . To further characterize the phenomenon of flg22 - in - duced FLS2 internalization , we tested a series of different inhibitors . Treatment with each of the inhibitors alone did not affect FLS2 cell membrane localization ( data not shown ) . It has been demonstrated in yeast and mamma - lian cells that actin plays an important role during re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin 2003 ) , and we actually observed intracellular movement of the FLS2 - GFP - labeled vesicles rapidly traf - ficking along cytoplasmic strands ( Fig . 4 ) . We found that Oryzalin , a well - known inhibitor of tubulin polymeriza - tion , and Latrunculin B , an inhibitor of actin depolymer - ization ( Mathur and Chua 2000 ) , strongly reduced the appearance of flg22 - induced FLS2 - GFP vesicles ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , cytoskeleton components are important for FLS2 endocytosis per se , possibly through dynamin - like pro - teins . They function in most endocytic processes in ani - mals and have also been found in plants ( Samaj et al . 2004 ) . Post - Golgi - derived vesicles are known to be affected by Brefeldin A ( BFA ) ( Emans et al . 2002 ) . In BFA pre - treated leaves , flg22 addition induced the appearance of fluorescent vesicles ( Fig . 4 ) . To further examine the na - ture of these vesicles , we used Wortmannin , which is thought to inhibit fusion of prevacuolar compartments ( Emans et al . 2002 ) . Application of flg22 in the presence of Wortmannin failed to induce the appearance of fluo - rescent vesicles ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating that these vesicles arise from a Wortmannin - sensitive endocytic process . Moreover , low temperature was also found to inhibit flg22 - triggered FLS2 internalization ( data not shown ) . Endocytosis has been well studied in yeast and mam - malian cells , while its very occurrence in plants was doubtful for many years ( see Meckel et al . 2004 , and references cited therein ) . However , during the past years , it has become clear that endocytosis takes place in plants ( Samaj et al . 2004 ; Tse et al . 2004 ) , even in fully turges - cent guard cells ( Meckel et al . 2004 ) . It has been mainly studied in developmental processes such as cytokinesis and root hair and root tip growth , as well as stomata closing . During plant growth and development , various processes are regulated by polar transport of the phyto - hormone auxin , which is mediated by a polar distribu - tion of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 through its traffick - ing from endosomal compartments ( Geldner et al . 2003 ) . Auxin itself has been shown to negatively regulate PIN1 endocytosis ( Paciorek et al . 2005 ) . Only recently , endocytosis of surface receptors has been also discovered in plants ( Shah et al . 2002 ; Ron and Avni 2004 ; Russinova et al . 2004 ; Gifford et al . 2005 ) . However , internalization of the RLK - type hormone re - ceptors Brassinosteroid - Insensitive 1 ( BRI1 ) and BRI1 - as - sociated receptor kinase ( BAK1 ) appeared independent of ligand addition and occurred constitutively ( Russinova et al . 2004 ) . In contrast , we demonstrate here that FLS2 internalization is triggered specifically by binding of its ligand flg22 and requires receptor activation . Thus , it represents the first case of ligand - mediated receptor en - docytosis in plants . Induced FLS2 endocytosis is further followed by receptor degradation . This suggests , in con - trast to early types of endosomes recycling plasma mem - brane proteins , that activated FLS2 is eventually sorted Figure 4 . Regulation of FLS2 internalization .

Never - theless , a much slower constitutive form of turnover of FLS2 might occur as well , since treatment with the an - tagonistic peptide flg22 (cid:1) 2 slightly increased the fluores - cence signal of cell - membrane - localized FLS2 - GFP , indi - cating that this peptide , which prevents signaling of FLS2 , also stabilizes it in the membrane . Autophosphorylation has been shown to play a crucial role in animal RTK activation ( Hubbard and Till 2000 ) and also occurs in several plant RLKs including FLS2 ( Nasrallah 2000 ; Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ; Wang et al . 2001 ) . In order to study the role of protein phosphoryla - tion in receptor kinase endocytosis , we used K - 252a , which acts as a general kinase inhibitor and was shown to inhibit elicitor responses ( Felix et al . 1991 ) . In the presence of K - 252a , flg22 - induced FLS2 endocytosis was completely abolished ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , FLS2 internalization requires kinase activities , possibly that of its own serine / threonine kinase ( Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ) . We next conducted site - directed mutagenesis of potential phos - phorylation sites in the cytoplasmic part of FLS2 and assayed their function in flg22 binding and response by transformation of Ws - 0 plants . Threonine and serine residues were selected for mutational analysis based on their high conservation among several RLKs . Transgenic lines expressing similar amounts of mutant FLS2 protein were chosen for further functional characterization ( Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . Among five different threonine and serine residues tested ( T867 , S878 , T1040 , T1072 , and S1118 ) , we could identify three ( FLS2 T867V , FLS2 T1040A , FLS2 T1072A ) that abolished flg22 - induced immediate generation of ROS ( Supplementary Fig . 2B ) . Two mutations , FLS2 T867V and FLS2 T1040A , also strongly affected flg22 downstream signaling , since seedling growth was not inhibited in the presence of 100 nM flg22 ( Supplementary Fig . 2C ) . A partial seedling growth inhi - bition by flg22 was observed in FLS2 S878A - and FLS2 T1072A - expressing lines . Only FLS2 S1118A was ca - pable of mediating a full flg22 response ( Supplementary Fig . 2B , C ) . Unlike the described mutations fls2 - 17 and fls2 - 24 ( Gomez - Gomez et al . 2001 ) , all mutations , even those impaired in flg22 responses , exhibited clear flg22 binding ( Supplementary Fig . 2D ) . One of the identified residues , FLS2 T867V , was located in the juxta membrane region of FLS2 , a region known to be phosphorylated in RLKs ( Nuhse et al . 2004 ; Wang et al . 2005 ) , and to be important in RTK function by creat - ing docking sites for recruitment of downstream mol - ecules ( Hubbard and Till 2000 ) . Moreover , FLS2 T867 re - sembles BRI1 T880 , which has been identified as in vivo phosphorylation site ( Wang et al . 2005 ) . Therefore , FLS2 T867V was further investigated in detail . Transgenic Ws - 0 / FLS2 T867V plants were found to exhibit the same flg22 - binding characteristics as Ws - 0 / FLS2 plants ( G . Kunze , unpubl . ) . However , these lines were flg22 insen - sitive at concentrations that induce a strong response in wild - type plants ( Fig . 5A , B ) . In addition , they also dis - played an enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype upon infection with pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae bacteria ( Fig . 5C ) . Microscopic analysis of Ws - 0 trans - genic plants expressing a GFP - tagged version of FLS2 T867V showed normal cell membrane localization of the mutant FLS2 protein ( Fig . 5D ) . Clearly , the impair - ments in the flg22 response of Ws - 0 / FLS2 T867V plants are not a result of FLS2 T867V subcellular mislocalization in the absence of elicitor . However , upon flg22 addition , FLS2 T867V endocytosis was strongly reduced ( Fig . 5D ) , and only observed as a delayed rare event . Therefore , mutation of the threonine residue 867 hampered both FLS2 internalization and FLS2 response , indicating that both processes are intimately connected . For surface receptor endocytosis , ligand binding in - duces receptor kinase activation and phosphorylational and conformational changes that lead to the exposition of sorting motifs recognized by cytosolic proteins . Clas - sically , the tetrapeptide YXX (cid:2) functions as a sorting sig - nal in animal receptors ( Kurten 2003 ) . Although this mo - tif can be found in plant RLKs and PRRs ( Ron and Avni 2004 ) , it is not present in FLS2 . Instead , in the FLS2 cytoplasmic part there is a well - conserved PEST - like motif , which has been implicated in ubiquitin - triggered Figure 5 .

Robatzek et al . 540 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 6 , 2008 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from receptor endocytosis ( Haglund et al . 2003 ) . Further evi - dence for a possible FLS2 ubiquitination comes from our gene chip expression analysis . Among flg22 rapidly in - duced genes are several coding for RING zinc - finger pro - teins with potential E3 - ligase activities ( Zipfel et al . 2004 ) . E3 ligases have been reported to regulate TLRs ( Chuang and Ulevitch 2004 ) . Furthermore , ligand - in - duced receptor ubiquitination is important for their en - docytic sorting into lysosomes and finally degradation ( Longva et al . 2002 ) . Interestingly , lysosomal receptor degradation appears to be regulated by the proteasome . Inhibition of the proteasomal activity affects the uptake of internalized receptors from outer membranes of MVBs into small inner vesicles that will fuse with the lyso - some ( Haglund et al . 2003 ) . Eventually , internalized re - ceptors can recycle back to the cell membrane ( van Kerk - hof and Strous 2001 ) . Trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) to MVBs requires sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail and also function of an ubiquitin ligase ( Longva et al . 2002 ) . Studies using proteasome inhibitors revealed that not only FLS2 deg - radation but also the internalization step were strongly compromised by MG132 ( Fig . 4 ) and LNLL ( data not shown ) . This suggests that the proteasome activity pri - marily influences FLS2 endocytosis and rather indirectly its degradation , as has been described for RTKs ( Ham - mond et al . 2001 ) . Therefore , we are currently addressing the involvement of the PEST motif in the mechanism of FLS2 endocytosis and introduced a single amino acid ex - change within the FLS2 PEST - like motif . Preliminary results of Ws - 0 transgenic lines expressing this FLS2 mu - tant variant revealed that FLS2 endocytosis was im - paired ( data not shown ) . Intriguingly , these plants were strongly compromised in their flg22 response as assayed by flg22 - mediated inhibition of seedling growth . In con - trast , immediate early flg22 - induced ROS production ap - peared to be much less affected ( data not shown ) . These data provide evidence that FLS2 endocytosis and down - stream signaling might be regulated through its PEST - like motif , possibly involving ubiquitin ligase activities . The most studied model of ligand - mediated receptor internalization is the EGF receptor in mammals . EGF binding accelerates EGFR rapid endocytosis , which is followed by sorting and trafficking through a series of endosomal compartments . EGFR directed into MVBs re - sults in their lysosomal degradation and therefore in sig - nal termination ( Sorkin and Von Zastrow 2002 ) . How - ever , the rate of receptor internalization appears to be much higher than the rate of receptor degradation . This fact together with other observations provides evidence that RTKs can signal from endosomes ( Sorkin and Von Zastrow 2002 ) . Similarly , FLS2 is internalized and likely further subjected to protein degradation , which occurs much slower than its internalization , and substantial pools of initially activated FLS2 receptor accumulate in - side the cell . Thus , there is a clear possibility that FLS2 can signal from intracellular compartments , for ex - ample , through interaction with MAPK cascades . Be - cause all flg22 - triggered responses display a transient be - havior ( Felix et al . 1999 ; Zipfel et al . 2004 ) , we postulate that this characteristic could be achieved through FLS2 internalization . Here , we show for the first time that a plant cell mem - brane receptor , in its function recognizing a bacterial PAMP , exhibits ligand - induced internalization . Our re - sults with the FLS2 T867V mutant provide evidence that endocytosis and signaling function are coupled . How - ever , whether FLS2 internalization is , in fact , required for signaling needs to be further evaluated . What is clear , instead , is that FLS2 is subject to protein degradation after endocytosis . This implies a host cell mechanism to dispose activated PRRs , thereby down - regulating signal - ing capacity . Attenuation of PAMP - mediated PRR sig - naling in animals occurs mainly through interactions with negative regulators ( Liew et al . 2005 ) . It has been reported that uncontrolled hyperinduction of proinflam - matory cytokines by TLRs may play a role in the patho - genesis of autoimmune , chronic inflammatory , and in - fectious diseases ( Cook et al . 2004 ) . Therefore , especially during immune responses , tailoring of pathogen - induced signaling is important to ensure both , effective defense and host survival . Materials and methods Generation of transgenic plants A FLS2p (cid:1) FLS2 – 3xmyc - GFP construct was used to transform Arabidop - sis thaliana Ws - 0 ( Ws - 0 / FLS2 - GFP ) . The FLS2 promoter up to −988 base pairs was amplified by PCR and introduced into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pCAMBIA 2300 , additionally adding BamHI and KpnI restriction sites upstream of the HindIII site . The FLS2 gene triple myc - tag fusion was PCR - amplified , in which the stop codon was mutated and a SalI site was introduced , and cloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites of pCAMBIA . The GFP - tag was PCR - amplified and in - frame cloned into the SalI site . Constructs were verified by sequencing . Stable transgenic lines were gen - erated using the standard A . tumefaciens - mediated gene transfer proce - dure of inflorescence infiltration . Independent transformed plant pools were kept separate for selection of independent transgenic lines based on their kanamycine resistance . Functional complementation of Ws - 0 by FLS2p (cid:1) FLS2 – 3xmyc - GFP was assayed in standard procedures . Expres - sion of FLS2 – 3xmyc - GFP protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti - myc tag polyclonal antibodies ( Upstate ) and anti - GFP rabbit serum ( Molecular Probes ) . Plants of the T3 generation were chosen for experiments . Confocal microscopy GFP fluorescence was observed in an Olympus microscope ( FV500 ) after excitation at 488 nm . GFP emission and remaining autofluorescence were detected using the EGFP ( 505 – 525 nm ) and PI ( > 660 nm ) filter sets . All samples were imaged with the 60× oil objective . Pictures were taken in Kahlman frame giving an average of four scans . Ligand and inhibitor applications Detached leaves of two independent lines ( Ws - 0 / FLS2 - GFP line 4 and Ws - 0 / FLS2 - GFP line 7 ) were either preincubated for 30 min in H 2 O or in 1 % DMSO at room temperature . Flg22 , its variants flg22 A . tum and flg22 (cid:1) 2 , and elf26 were added to a final concentration of 10 µM . Cotreat - ments with K - 252a were done at a final concentration of 10 µM . The following inhibitors were used : 100 µg / mL BFA , 33 µM Wortmannin , 20 µM Oryzalin , 20 µM Latrunculin B , and 50 µM MG132 . All were added 30 min ahead of flg22 application . Site - directed mutagenesis For each construct , FLS2 – 3xmyc was PCR - amplified and replaced into the StuI and SalI sites of the original FLS2p (cid:1) FLS2 – 3xmyc - GFP construct . Amino acid substitutions of T867V , S878A , T1040A , T1072A , and S1118A were achieved by the megaprimer method . Transgenic plants of the T2 generation were chosen for experiments . Binding studies with radiolabeled 125 I - Tyr - flg22 , seedling growth inhibition studies , ROS as - says , and bacterial infections were performed as described previously ( Zipfel et al . 2004 ) .
