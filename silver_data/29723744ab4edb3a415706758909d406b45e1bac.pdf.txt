However , the nature and extent of these changes are unclear . As part of the NIH Mouse Regulome Project , we here combined DNaseI hypersensitivity , ChIP - seq , and ChIA - PET technologies to map the promoter - enhancer interactomes of pluripotent ES cells and differentiated B lymphocytes . We conﬁrm that enhancer usage varies widely across tissues . Unex - pectedly , we ﬁnd that this feature extends to broadly transcribed genes , including Myc and Pim1 cell - cycle regulators , which associate with an entirely different set of enhancers in ES and B cells . By means of high - resolution CpG methylomes , genome editing , and digital footprinting , we show that these enhancers recruit lineage - determining factors . Furthermore , we demonstrate that the turning on and off of enhancers during development correlates with promoter activity . We propose that organisms rely on a dynamic enhancer landscape to control basic cellular functions in a tissue - speciﬁc manner . INTRODUCTION Gene expression during development is orchestrated by pro - moter sequences and a variety of distal cis - regulatory elements . Key among these are enhancers , which associate with pro - moters to increase the transcriptional output of target genes in a tissue - speciﬁc manner ( Visel et al . , 2009 ) . Enhancers are typically distinguished from nonregulatory DNA by their hyper - sensitivity to DNaseI digestion ( Sabo et al . , 2006 ) and binding of chromatin modiﬁers . The CBP / p300 acetyltransferase for instance mediates H3K27 acetylation of chromatin at active enhancers ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , enhancers dis - play high levels of H3K4 monomethylation ( H3K4me1 ; Buecker and Wysocka , 2012 ) , and a relative depletion of H3K4me3 ( Heintzman et al . , 2007 ) and the histone variant H2AZ ( Kouzine et al . , 2013 ) . Based on these parameters , ! 400 , 000 genomic sites displaying enhancer - like features were recently discov - ered , spanning nearly 10 % of the human genome ( ENCODE Project Consortium et al . , 2012 ) . Enhancers control lineage identity by recruiting transcription factors , cofactors , and RNA Polymerase II ( PolII ) to target genes . They physically interact with promoters resulting in looping out of intervening sequences ( Krivega and Dean , 2012 ) , which in some instances can span over 1 Mb of DNA ( Nobrega et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast to promoters and insulators , which vary little across cell types , the enhancer landscape changes considerably during development ( Thurman et al . , 2012 ) . This feature predicts that Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1507 functional connectivity in mammalian cells ( 1 ) must display a high degree of tissue speciﬁcity and ( 2 ) should closely reﬂect tran - scriptome changes during cell differentiation . However , these ideas have not been fully explored because of the difﬁculty of mapping promoter - enhancer connections during development . In the absence of direct approaches , enhancers have been typically assigned to ‘‘cognate’’ promoters based on linear prox - imity or shared chromatin states . This strategy has limitations because enhancers do not always regulate nor share chromatin proﬁles with the nearest promoter . Alternatively , chromosome conformation capture techniques have been used to explore regulatory interactions at predeﬁned genomic loci . However , the resolution of 3C - based techniques alone is insufﬁcient to map promoter - enhancer connectivity in entire genomes ( Xie and Ren , 2013 ) . To overcome this challenge , the ChIA - PET pro - tocol was recently developed ( Fullwood et al . , 2009 ) . ChIA - PET is a ChIP - based method that captures long - range chromatin in - teractions involving or mediated by a protein of interest such as estrogen receptor a in adenocarcinoma cells ( Fullwood et al . , 2009 ) or RNA PolII in human cell lines ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . We here introduce the NIH Mouse Regulome Project , an initia - tive that seeks to deﬁne the 3D interplay of gene regulatory domains in developing mouse primary cells . In this ﬁrst report we compare pluripotent embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and dif - ferentiated B lymphocytes . By combining ChIA - PET , CpG methylomes , DNaseI hypersensitivity , transcriptomes , digital footprinting , and TALEN - mediated genome editing , our studies reveal the dynamics of the mouse regulome during ontogeny . RESULTS A Comprehensive Map of Regulatory Domains and Their Interactions in Mouse Primary Cells To characterize the mouse regulome in primary cells we ﬁrst applied DNaseI hypersensitivity ( DHS ) followed by deep - sequencing to CD43 " B lymphocytes activated in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and interleukin - 4 ( LPS + IL - 4 ) . From two in - dependent experiments ( 268 million aligned reads ) , we identiﬁed 90 , 015 high - conﬁdence DNaseI domains in B cells . As expected , DNaseI - seq proﬁles were highly reproducible between biological replicates ( Spearman’s r = 0 . 99 ; Figure S1A available online ) . ToidentifyDHSsitesassociatedwithgeneregulatorydomains , we next mapped Nipbl , Med12 , and p300 by ChIP - seq ( Fig - ure 1A ) . We chose the cohesin - loading factor Nipbl and the Med12 component of mediator because they demarcate en - hancers tethered with core promoters ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ) . Like - wise , the transcription regulator p300 occupies a subset of active promoters and enhancers ( Chen et al . , 2008 ) . There was a considerable , although incomplete , overlap in the recruitment of these factors in B cells ( Figures 1A and S1B ) . Active promoters were thus identiﬁed as Nipbl + , Med12 + , or p300 + DHS sites that overlapped with ENSEMBL - annotated transcription start sites ( TSSs ) . Based on this strategy we identiﬁed 17 , 004 DHS promoter elements associated with 16 , 931 genes , 49 , 763 enhancer elements , and an additional 23 , 248 that did not overlap with either ( Figure 1B ) . Promoters were in general H3K4me1 - low H3K4me3 high H2AZ high , whereas the opposite signature demarcated enhancer domains ( Figure 1A ; Kouzine et al . , 2013 ) . DHS analysis of mouse ES cells uncovered a similar num - ber of DHS promoters ( 16 , 771 ) and an increased number of en - hancers ( 62 , 766 , Figure 1B ) . To directly map the promoter - enhancer interactome , we applied chromatin interaction analysis by paired - end - tag se - quencing ( ChIA - PET ; Fullwood et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) , which combines PolII ChIP with 3C technology ( Figures 1C , S2A ) . We generated two independent B cell ChIA - PET libraries , from which ! 15 million reads were uniquely aligned and classiﬁed into two separate data sets : 5 . 7 million reads of PolII chromatin occupancy , and 9 . 2 million reads clustered into 14 , 247 high - conﬁdence PolII long - range cis interactions or PETs ( Figure 1D and Table S1 ) . Both data sets were corre - lated between replicates ( Spearman’s r > 0 . 83 , Figures S2B and S2C ) . Attesting to the speciﬁcity of ChIA - PET , most PolII long - range interactions ( 13 , 070 , 92 % ) were linked to at least one gene reg - ulatory domain ( Figure S1C ) . Furthermore , of 16 , 931 B cell pro - moters associated with DHS domains , 6 , 890 were involved in PolII long - range interactions . In general , these genes were tran - scribed 2 - fold higher ( p < 2 3 10 16 , Figure S1D ) and recruited more PolII ( p < 2 3 10 16 , Figure S1E ) than nonanchored ones . We also detected 6 , 813 DHS enhancer domains involved in PolII interactions . Of these , 71 % were active ( H3K27Ac + ) , whereas up to 60 % of nonanchored ones were poised ( H3K27Ac " , Fig - ure S1F ) . In general , the number of ChIA - PET interactions per regulatory site was proportional to the extent of DNaseI digestion ( Figure S1G ) . Thus , ChIA - PET preferentially detects PolII long - range interactions involving H3K27Ac + enhancers and transcrip - tionally active promoters . As previously shown ( Li et al . , 2012 ) , PolII interactions fell into four distinct groups : ( 1 ) intragenic , connecting promoters to gene bodies ; ( 2 ) extragenic , connecting promoters to distal regulatory elements ; ( 3 ) intergenic , tethering promoters from different genes ; and ( 4 ) enhancer - enhancer interactions ( Fig - ure S1H ) . Examples of these are provided in Figure 1D for the Atp5j - Mir155 gene locus . Consistent with high expression of Mir155 in activated B cells ( Kuchen et al . , 2010 ) , its promoter was associated with 83 long - range interaction tags ( Figure 1D , upper ) . Of these , 70 were extragenic , involving 5 upstream enhancer domains , while 13 were intragenic , connecting the pro - moter to downstream sequences . An additional 23 PolII long - range interactions interconnected the 5 enhancers upstream of Mir155 . In contrast to B cells , ES cells actively transcribe Mrpl39 , Jam2 , and Atp5j but express little Mir155 mRNA ( Fig - ure 1D , lower ) . Consistent with this , we identiﬁed 30 intergenic connections between Mrpl39 , Jam2 , and Atp5j promoters in ES cells , whereas few connections involved Mir155 ( Figure 1D ) . As in previous ChIA - PET studies , both direct and indirect inter - actions were considered in our analysis ( Figure S1I ) . TALEN - Mediated Validation of Promoter - Enhancer Connectivity ChIA - PET conﬁrmed established connections between gene regulatory domains . For instance , the pluripotent gene Sox2 was associated in ES cells with a series of enhancers recently described by 5C studies ( Figure S3A ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ) . Likewise , the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( Igh ) 3 0 E a 1508 Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . enhancer was found in spatial proximity to transcribed Ig m , Ig g 1 , and Ig ε in B cells only ( Figure S3B ) . We also found evidence of Ig m - Ig g 1 associations , representing either synapses between the recombining genes ( Wuerffel et al . , 2007 ) or fully recombined DNA . At the Ig k locus , the VJ k - 5 0 E k domain was connected to the previously characterized 3 0 E k and Ed enhancers ( Figure 2A ; Liu B B cells ES cells DHS A Pax5 Zcchc7 H2AZ H3K4me1 H3K4me3 DHS Nipbl Med12 p300 chr4 : 44 , 531 , 378 - 44 , 785 , 274 Enhancers Promoters Other 23 , 248 ( 26 % ) 17 , 004 ( 19 % ) 49 , 763 ( 55 % ) 62 , 766 ( 69 % ) 12 , 194 ( 13 % ) 16 , 771 ( 18 % ) chromatin - associatedPolII tags C PolII Enhancer 1 Promoter Enhancer 2 ChIA - PET Mir155 Mrpl39 Atp5j chr16 : 84 , 563 , 820 - 84 , 867 , 354 Jam2 Gabpa 2000 1000 0 2000 1000 0 R PK M R PK M E1 ( 7 ) E2 ( 42 ) E3 ( 45 ) E4 ( 15 ) E5 ( 42 ) P3 ( 19 ) P2 ( 23 ) P1 ( 18 ) inter - ligation PolII tags ES cell B cell P1 ( 83 ) D 50 0 50 R PK M ( B c e ll ) mRNA 50 0 50 R PK M ( ES c e l l ) mRNA 20Kb 20Kb 5 28 31 9 24 Figure 1 .

Unexpectedly , the analysis uncovered two additional enhancers located 8 kb ( E4 ) and 15 kb ( E5 ) downstream of Ed ( Figure 2A ) . We also found additional enhancers ( E1 - E2 ) associated with the activation induced deaminase ( AID ) gene Aicda ( Figure 2B ) . The three enhancers previously shown to regulate AID transcrip - tion in vivo were also linked by PolII long - range interactions in the analysis ( E3 - E5 , Figure 2B ; Crouch et al . , 2007 ; Huong et al . , 2013 ; Sayegh et al . , 2003 ) . The Apobec1 promoter and a sixth enhancer located in Apobec1 intron 2 were also clus - tered ( Figure 2B ) . To validate ChIA - PET associations , we deleted E1 and E2 in CH12 mouse lymphoma cells . We chose this B cell line because upon activation it transcribes high levels of AID and undergoes efﬁcient Ig m - Ig a recombination ( Naka - mura et al . , 1996 ) . To facilitate homozygous gene targeting , knockout constructs were cotransfected with enhancer - speciﬁc transcription activator - like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) , assem - bled via a solid - phase high - throughput system ( Reyon et al . , 2012 ; Figure S4A ) . Upon activation , wild - type CH12 cells increased AID mRNA expression ! 5 - fold and recombined to IgA ( 15 % , Figures 2C and 2D ) . Deletion of E1 or E2 however markedly reduced AID transcription and IgA expression ( Figures 2C and 2D ) , consistent with the notion that the extent of switching is proportional to AID expression ( Takizawa et al . , 2008 ) . Transcription of Apobec1 was also impaired in the mutant cells , whereas noninteracting Ezh2 and Cd83 genes were unaffected ( Figure 2C ) . Importantly , E1 " / " and E2 " / " cells displayed an overall reduction in Nipbl and PolII occupancy at all regulatory domains within the Aicda locus , including the Apobec1 promoter ( Figure 2E and S4B ) . In contrast , this effect was not observed at the Foxj2 - Necap1 locus , ! 190 kb down - stream of Apobec1 ( Figure 2E and S4B ) . Thus , E1 and E2 regulate AID and Apobec1 transcription by controlling local recruitment of PolII . To further validate the ChIA - PET results , we targeted additional regulatory elements associated with the Pou2af1 ( OCA - B ) , and Cd79a genes . We uncovered an intronic enhancer ( E3 ) ! 15 kb downstream of OCA - B TSS required for transcrip - tional upregulation upon B cell activation but dispensable for basal transcription in nonstimulated cells ( Figure S4C ) . This activity is consistent with the reported dynamics and signaling requirements of OCA - B expression during B cell differentiation ( Casellas et al . , 2002 ; Qin et al . , 1998 ) . A similar analysis conﬁrmed the presence of enhancer elements that augment basal Cd79a transcription ( Figure S4D ) . Additional gene target - ing experiments within the Pim1 oncogene locus are discussed below ( Figure 5 ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that at least a fraction of PolII long - range interactions , as deﬁned by ChIA - PET , represent functional promoter - enhancer connec - tions in B lymphocytes . Single - and Higher - Order Gene Clusters in Primary Mouse Cells Up to 54 % of genes recruiting PolII in activated B cells were associated with long - range interactions ( 6 , 890 of 12 , 652 ) . Of these , 1 , 231 ( 18 % ) represented single promoters tethered to at least one enhancer ( Figure 3A ) . These clusters created complex architectures and spanned an average of 78 kb of genomic DNA ( Figure S5A ) . The most elaborate of this group was the Gpr183 promoter , which was connected either directly or indirectly to 12 enhancers via 76 long - range interactions ( Figure 3A ) . Another example was Cd83 , which displayed 158 PolII intragenic and extragenic connections ( Figure 3B ) . Among single - promoter gene clusters , we found examples of the recently dubbed superenhancer domains ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) , whichwere deﬁnedbasedon clusteringofgene regulatory domains : e . g . , mir290 / 295 and Sox2 loci ( Figures S5B and S3A ) . However , the vast majority of anchored genes ( 5 , 606 , 81 % ) formed higher - order multigene complexes ( 1 , 481 B cell clusters , Figure 3C ) , which could not be easily deduced as interacting based on visual inspection of DHS island distribution . The average span of these clusters was 179 kb ( Figure S5A ) . Its prime example in B cells was the Rela cluster in chromosome 19 , which was composed of 66 genes and 398 long - rangeinteractions ( Fig - ure 3C ) . Promoters linked by intergenic connections displayed higher PolII density and mRNA synthesis relative to genes from single - promoter clusters or not anchored to other domains ( Fig - ure S5C ) . Furthermore , families of genes coexpressed during ontogeny were overrepresented in the multiple - promoter gene group ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Among these we found themajorhistocompatibilitycomplex H2 - M b cluster ( Fisherexact test p = 1 . 3 3 10 14 ) , the Hist1h histone family ( p = 7 . 7 3 10 82 ) , and thelymphoidsignaling Gimap cluster ( p = 7 . 6 3 10 14 , FigureS5D ) . In contrast to promoters , which readily formed higher - order complexes , the vast majority of enhancers ( ! 90 % ) were linked to a single promoter , and less than 2 % of all enhancers were linked to more than two promoters ( Table S1 ) . One exception was an enhancer downstream of Gimap6 , which was directly linked to seven promoters ( Figure S5D ) . Transcriptional Correlation between lncRNA and Associated Coding Genes Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNA ) are a new class of RNAs believed to play regulatory functions ( Batista and Chang , 2013 ) . ChIA - PET identiﬁed hundreds of associations between protein - coding and lncRNA genes in multiple - promoter clusters . For instance , lncRNA E ( ENSMUSG ) 85930 is extensively associated with Clec2d and to a lesser extent with Cd69 ( Figure 3D ) . Other examples involving genes key for B cell development included Ptprcap - E90702 , Cd81 - E59277 , and Bcl11a - E123592 pairs ( Figure S5E ) . lncRNAs are believed to modulate transcription of ( B ) Regulatory map of the Aicda - Apobec1 locus in activated B cells . Deletion of selected enhancers ( E1 and E2 ) was carried out in CH12 B cells using knockout targeting cassettes ( cyan ) and TALEN endonucleases .

Consequently , transcription of lncRNAs and their targeted genes is often coordinated ( Guil and Esteller , 2012 ) . To test this idea across the genome we measured expression of lncRNAs and their interacting protein - coding genes as deﬁned by ChIA - PET . We found that genes associated with highly abundant lncRNAs were transcribed at higher levels than those associated with lncRNAs detected at low or trace levels ( p < 0 . 05 , Figure 3E ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with the proposal that transcription of lincRNAs and their targets can be coordinated . Whether the same scenario applies to promoter - promoter clusters not involving lncRNA remains to be determined . Broadly Expressed Genes Are Linked to Cell - Type - Speciﬁc Enhancers As expected , genes differentially expressed in B and ES cells were linked to tissue - speciﬁc regulatory elements .

Conversely , the B - cell - spe - ciﬁc Cd79b gene was only anchored to enhancers in the B cell compartment ( Figure S6A ) . We next turned our attention to genes transcribed in both cell types . Of 6 , 890 promoters anchored by ChIA - PET in B cells , 4 , 854 ( 70 % ) were also anchored in ES cells ( Figure 4A , Venn diagram ) . As an example , the Hexim1 - 2 genes were linked to the same downstream enhancer ( E1 ) in B and ES cells ( Figure 4B ) . Surpris - ingly , most anchored promoters in the two cell types ( 4 , 430 , 94 % ) were associ - ated with at least one additional tissue - speciﬁc enhancer ( Figure 4A , lower pie chart ) . A striking example was the Myc proto - oncogene , which displayed a completely different enhancer landscape in ES and B cells ( Figure 4C ) . In B cells , Myc was linked to ten enhancers ( E5 - E14 ) located near or downstream of exon 3 of the lncRNA Pvt1 , whereas in ES cells all enhancers associated with Myc ( E1 - E4 ) were found upstream of this site ( Figure 4C ) . Other ex - amples included Tgif1 , Smad7 , and Malat1 , which were prefer - entially linked to ES - cell - speciﬁc enhancers , whereas Swap70 , Etv5 , and Pim1 were tethered to a greater number of enhancers in B lymphocytes ( Figure 4D ) . To explore whether changes in the enhancer landscape impacts transcription of this gene group , we measured their expression by calculating mRNA copy numbers per cell . Genes that turned on or off a single tissue - speciﬁc enhancer displayed little or no changes in transcription levels in the two cell types ( Figure 4E ) . However , as genes interacted with two or more addi - tional enhancers their expression was signiﬁcantly different ( p < 9 3 10 10 , Figure 4E ) . Myc , for instance , was transcribed ! 4 times 1512 Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . higher in B cells than in ES cells ( Table S2 ) . This observation is consistent with the notion that , in general , transcription levels of a given promoter are commensurate with the number of reg - ulatory domains it is regulated by ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . On the basis of these ﬁndings we conclude that ( 1 ) broadly expressed genes can be regulated by cell - type - speciﬁc enhancers and ( 2 ) the turning on and off of enhancers during ontogeny impacts tran - scription levels . Dynamic CpG Methylation of Cell - Type - Speciﬁc Regulatory Domains Cellular differentiation is accompanied by changes in DNA methylation at promoters and distal regulatory domains ( Shen et al . , 2013 ; Song et al . , 2013 ; Stadler et al . , 2011 ; Ziller et al . , 2013 ) . To explore whether the dynamics of DNA methylation correlate with differential enhancer usage , we applied bisulphite sequencing ( Bis - Seq ) and generated methylome libraries at single - nucleotide resolution . Bis - Seq of activated B cells pro - vided a total of 148 billion mappable methylome bases . We com - plemented this data set with Bis - Seq libraries from mouse ES cells ( Stadler et al . , 2011 ) and calculated the percentage of CpG methylation at gene regulatory domains . With few excep - tions , activated B - cell - speciﬁc enhancers were highly methyl - ated in ES cells ( > 80 % of CpGs ) , whereas enhancers common to both cell types displayed a broad range of CpG methylation levels ( Figure 5A ) . High methylation was also observed at ES cell - speciﬁc enhancers in activated lymphocytes , whereas B cell enhancers displayed low methylation levels ( Figure 5A ) . Importantly , the level of CpG methylation was lower at active than at poised enhancers ( p < 3 3 10 16 , Figure 5A ) . As expected , promoters of silent genes displayed on average higher CpG methylation than active ones ( p < 2 . 2 3 10 16 , Figure 5A ) . Methyl - ation levels were also inversely proportional to the extent of ChIA - PET signals ( Figure S6B ) . Thus , enhancers are highly methylated when inactive , but become demethylated during development concomitant with the presence of tissue - speciﬁc PolII interactions . We explore in Figure 5B transcriptional regulation of the Pim1 oncogene , whose promoter is tethered to an entirely different set of enhancers in activated B cells and ES cells . The analysis shows a direct correlation between CpG demethylation and enhancer usage . For instance , B cell enhancers E2 and E5 and ES cell enhancers E6 and E7 display nearly complete CpG demethylation in a cell - type - speciﬁc manner ( Figure 5B ) . To conﬁrm that these enhancers truly promote Pim1 transcription , we targeted E2 and E6 in CH12 B cells and ES cells , respectively . As measured by qPCR , we found a signiﬁcant decrease in Pim1 mRNA levels in the targeted cells , whereas expression of Brd2 , Mtch1 , and Gapdh was unaffected ( Figure 5C ) . Attempts to delete E2 and E6 in the cell type where they are inactive were unsuccessful ( not shown ) , likely due to the inability of TALENs to target methylated DNA ( Bultmann et al . , 2012 ) . In ES cells , B - cell - speciﬁc enhancers , including those linked to broadly expressed genes , were hypermethylated ( Figure S6C ) . To examine at which stage during B lymphopoiesis these regulatory elements become demethylated , we generated meth - ylome libraries from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells ( KSL ) , B lymphoid precursors ( CLP ) , and peripheral G 0 resting B cells . Of 1 , 518 B - cell - speciﬁc enhancers that were linked by long - range interactions and hypomethylated during activation , only 82 ( 5 % ) were also hypomethylated in ES cells ( Figure 5D ) . However , in KSL precursors nearly half ( 714 , 47 % ) of activated B cell enhancers were already demethylated ( Figure 5D ) . This group included Pim1 enhancers E2 , E3 , and E5 , which displayed nearly identical CpG methylation levels in KSL , CLP , G 0 resting , and cycling B cells ( Figure S6D ) . As KSLs develop into CLP B cell precursors , demethylation was observed in 61 % ( 926 ) of B cell enhancers . In resting G 0 B cells , this number increased to 80 % ( 1 , 207 , Figure 5D ) . At this stage of development , the overall mean methylation was comparable between activated B cell enhancers and those functional both in B and ES cells ( Fig - ure S6C ) . Thus , most activated B cell enhancers , including those associated with broadly expressed genes , are demethylated by the time naive lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow to the periphery . This ﬁnding is consistent with the notion that the genome of G 0 lymphocytes is primed for activation and that most genes expressed during the humoral immune response are transcribed at basal levels in the naive compartment ( Kou - zine et al . , 2013 ; Nie et al . , 2012 ) . At the same time , it is important to point out that ! 20 % of activated B cell enhancers do not become fully demethylated until activation occurs . Among these , we ﬁnd Pim1 E4 and Aicda E3 and E4 ( Figures S6D and S6E ) . Digital Genomic Footprinting Characterizes TF Binding in the Mouse Genome The observation that cell - type - speciﬁc enhancers can promote transcription of broadly expressed genes implies that factors driving lineage speciﬁcation are involved in this regulation . To explore this idea , we sought to comprehensively catalog tran - scription factor occupancy in mouse B lymphocytes and ES cells . To this end , we took advantage of the fact that transcription factors protect their binding sites from DNaseI cleavage , leaving nucleotide - resolution footprints within DHS islands ( Neph et al . , 2012 ) . Figure 6A , for instance , shows four DNaseI footprints at the Pold4 gene promoter in G 0 and cycling B cells . Importantly , these footprints overlap with recognizable binding motifs for transcription factors PU . 1 , Ebf1 , Egr1 , and Sp1 ( Figure 6A ) . By applying an established algorithm ( Baek et al . , 2012 ) , we de - tected 706 , 669 high - conﬁdence ( FDR < 5 % ) footprints within 75 , 917 B cell DHS domains ( 70 % of total DHS ) . To link these footprints to known transcription factor recognition sequences , we examined all empirically deﬁned DNA binding motifs , compiled by HOMER , UniPROBE , JASPAR , and similar data - bases . We found a signiﬁcant enrichment in transcription factor binding motifs within DHS footprints ( p < 1 3 10 6 , Figure S7A ) . Altogether , we linked 247 distinct transcription factor DNA motifs to 122 , 505 footprints in B cells ( Table S1 ) . In addition , de novo motif discovery yielded 18 new binding sites that did not match known recognition sequences ( Table S1 ) . A similar analysis linked 306 DNA motifs to 346 , 284 footprints in ES cells ( Table S1 ) . Figure 6B shows examples of cleavage proﬁles for tran - scription factors Irf8 , Sp1 , Nrf1 , PU . 1 , and CTCF ( an extended view of footprints is provided in Figure S7B ) . Importantly , ChIP - seq analysis showed a correlation between PU . 1 and CTCF occupancy , their DNA binding motifs , and cognate footprints Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1513 A B C D E Figure 4 .

To conﬁrm that footprinting proﬁles truly reﬂect the morphology of DNA - protein interactions , we turned to available transcription factor : DNA cocrystal structures . For instance , consistent with the published Ebf1 : DNA structure ( Treiber et al . , 2010 ) , backbone phosphates in direct contact with Ebf1 amino acids via hydrogen bounds ( in red in Figure 6D ) were the most protected from DNaseI cleavage , whereas more exposed residues ( in cyan ) displayed by comparison greater suscepti - bility to digestion .

We conclude that DNaseI cleavage proﬁles can reca - pitulate the structural features of tran - scription factor : DNA interactions , and thus they reﬂect the occupancy of gene regulatory proteins across the genome . Lineage - Determining Factors Regulate Transcription of Broadly Expressed Genes Having validated the genomic footprint - ing approach , we next turned to the question of whether lineage - speciﬁc fac - tors associate with enhancers controlling transcription of broadly expressed genes . To this end we classiﬁed B and ES cells enhancers into three groups : ( 1 ) those shared between the two cell types and linked to the same promoter as deter - mined by ChIA - PET , ( 2 ) cell - type - speciﬁc enhancers bound to promoters active both in B and ES cells , and ( 3 ) cell - type - speciﬁc enhancers linked to cell - type - speciﬁc promoters ( Fig - ure 7A ) . Within the B cell compartment , all transcription factors analyzed were associated with the three enhancer groups . Ebf1 , Oct2 , and E2A footprints for instance showed no signiﬁ - cant differences in their distribution regardless of enhancer speciﬁcity ( Figure 7B ) . Other factors , such as E2f2 and Foxo1 displayed statistical signiﬁcant biases for shared and cell - type - speciﬁc enhancers , respectively ( Figure 7B ) . However , even in Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1515 these cases , footprints were not excluded from any enhancer group . A similar distribution was observed in ES cells ( Fig - ure S7C ) . Thus , lineage speciﬁcation factors associate both with tissue - speciﬁc and broadly active enhancers . Conﬁrming this ﬁnding , ChIP - seq analysis of the pluripotent factors Nanog , Oct4 , and Sox2 showed occupancy of B and ES cell shared enhancers at the Ube2g1 locus as well as binding to ES - cell - spe - ciﬁc enhancers at the Myc locus ( Figure 7C ) .

( D ) Transcription of broadly expressed genes is driven during development by a relay race type of regulation , where the landscape of active enhancers varies in different cell types concomitant with the dynamics of CpG methylation . See also Figure S7 .

We conclude that transcription factors driving lineage speciﬁcation associate with regulatory elements of broadly expressed genes . We point out that the functional signiﬁcance of TF recruitment as deﬁned by digital footprinting remains to be empirically determined . At the same time , our ﬁndings are consistent with the notion that broadly expressed genes can be regulated in a tissue - speciﬁc manner . DISCUSSION We have here characterized the ﬁrst interactomes of gene regu - latory domains in primary cells . The data provide a wealth of information from the mouse genome with thousands of pro - moter - enhancer pairs . Even for loci that have been extensively studied , the analysis uncovered new connectivities . At the Ig k locus , for instance , we identiﬁed novel enhancers linked to 5 0 E k , the regulatory domain from which NF - k B was originally iso - lated 27 years ago ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ) . ChIA - PET also un - covered three additional enhancers tethered at a long distance ( up to 50 kb ) to the AID gene promoter ; the previously character - ized AID enhancers are all located within 15 kb of the TSS . Thus , one clear advantage of ChIA - PET lies in its ability to identify long - range interactions , even when they leapfrog noninteracting genes , as is the case for 65 % of all enhancers ( Table S1 ) . A strik - ingexampleisapairofgiantenhancerslinkedto Pax5 byskipping over ! 250 kb of DNA containing the Zcchc7 gene ( Figure S7D ) . Like other conformation capturing techniques , ChIA - PET does not directly address functionality of chromatin interactions . This can only be determined empirically by other means . Typically , enhancer activity is deﬁned by luciferase - based plasmids or LacZ transgenes . However , these experimental approaches only provide an incomplete view of transcriptional regulation because they either lack proper chromatin structure or the inﬂu - ence of neighboring enhancers , insulators , and silencers is not taken into account . Conversely , genome editing provides a means to measure the impact of enhancer deletion in the phys - iological context . In most cases , we found that cognate promoter activity was partially reduced following enhancer ablation , sup - porting the model that the contribution of individual enhancers to gene expression is additive in nature . Examples of this cate - gory were enhancers linked to the Cd79a , Pou2af1 , and Pim1 . On the other hand , the targeting of AID 5 0 enhancers E1 or E2 nearly entirely abolished AID expression and activity , a result that is reminiscent of those obtained upon deletion of AID enhancers E3 and E5 in BAC transgenic mice ( Crouch et al . , 2007 ; Huong et al . , 2013 ) , or by interference with E4 activity in primary B cells ( Sayegh et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , rather than working in additive fashion , AID gene regulatory elements seem to syner - gize or act as a cooperative unit . Conceivably , the local topology of the Aicda - Apobec1 locus requires activation of all enhancers for optimal transcription to occur . This strategy may be useful for genes that require tight regulation as AID , whose expression is strictly limited to activated B cells to minimize its well known tumorigenic activity ( Casellas et al . , 2009 ) . Consistent with this model , our methylome analysis indicates that the AID locus is not completely demethylated until B cells are activated . A direct comparison between the B and ES cell interactomes revealed that up to 95 % of genes anchored in both cell types are associated with at least one tissue - speciﬁc enhancer . Transcription modularity , the mechanism whereby genes accu - mulate regulatory elements during ontogeny , is a well - described phenomenon that controls the spatiotemporal expression of developmental genes ( Davidson , 2001 ; Visel et al . , 2007 ) . For instance , the cardiac homeobox gene Nkx2 - 5 is targeted to spe - ciﬁc subregions of the developing heart by turning on additional cis - regulatory domains over time ( Schwartz and Olson , 1999 ) . Similarly , expression of the human apolipoprotein E gene is trig - gered in hepatocytes and astrocytes by enhancers only active in those tissues ( Grehan et al . , 2001 ) . Our studies demonstrate that the turning on and off of enhancers is not a singularity of devel - opmental gene loci . Instead , it is a widespread mechanism that regulates broadly expressed genes involved in basic cellular functions , such as cell - cycle initiation ( Myc ) , signal transduction ( b - catenin ) , and cellular motility ( Malat1 ) . Mechanistically , we show that the changing enhancer land - scape in mammalian development results from the unbiased recruitment of lineage - determining factors , which associate with enhancers anchored not only to tissue - speciﬁc promoters but also to constitutively active ones . Based on these observa - tions we propose a ‘‘relay race’’ model of transcriptional regula - tion , whereby broadly active genes make use of tissue - speciﬁc cis - regulatory elements and transcription factors as cells prog - ress through development ( Figure 7D ) . For genes that only replace a subset of their regulatory domains , transcription is roughly maintained at comparable levels in different cell types . However , as the number of connected enhancers ﬂuctuates considerably , promoter activity can be signiﬁcantly altered . We can think of at least two reasons why higher organisms modulate the enhancer landscape of broadly expressed genes . First , as aforementioned , it enables ﬁne - tuning of protein output , which in turns controls protein activity . Second , it places basic cellular functions under the control of tissue - speciﬁc factors . In the B cell compartment , these strategies are perhaps best illus - trated during the immune response to invading pathogens . In this microenvironment B lymphocytes move rapidly from a G 0 , quiescent state to one of the fastest proliferative rates among eukaryoticcells ( Liuetal . , 1991 ) . Keyinthisprocessis Myc which , along with TFIIH , triggers a ! 10 - fold ampliﬁcation of the lympho - cyte transcriptome concomitant with cell - cycle entry ( Kouzine et al . , 2013 ; Nie et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , vis - a ` - vis proliferation B cells differ substantially from continuously dividing ES cells , in that they must rapidly engage a burst of Myc expression and activity duringtheimmuneresponsetocopewithfastdividingpathogens . Ourstudiesimplythatthisuniqueresponseismediated , atleastin part , by the large number of cis - and trans - responsive elements that associate with the Myc promoter in the B cell compartment .

Supplemental Information EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Genome Editing TALENs for speciﬁc loci were designed and assembled using protocols described in ( Reyon et al . , 2012 ) . The donor vector included 500 - 1500 bp homology arms and a loxP - ﬂanked puromycin - T2A - thymidine kinase cassette to select for targeted clones ( Figure S3 ) . Activated B or E14 cells were nucleofected with the donor cassette and the TALEN plasmid pair using Nucleofector Kit V according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Lonza ) . After 72 hr , limiting dilution was performed in media con - taining 0 . 5 – 1 m g / ml puromycin ( Sigma ) and incubation was continued for 6 – 8 days . Individual clones were picked and genomic DNA was extracted ( Promega ) . Genotyping was done by nested PCR using locus - speciﬁc external and vector internal primers ( Table S3 ) under the following conditions : 98 ! C for 30 s ; 35 3 ( 98 ! C for 10 s , 63 ! C for 30 s , 72 ! C for 30 s ) ; 72 ! C for 3 min ; hold at 4 ! C . PCR products were run on 1 % agarose gel . Positive clones were expanded and nucleofected with a plasmid express - ing CMV - or EF1 a - driven Cre recombinase ( Addgene ) . At 72 hr , limiting dilution was performed in the presence of 0 . 5 – 2 m g / ml ganciclovir ( Sigma ) for 6 – 8 days . Once again , single clones were picked and genotyped by PCR using primers amplifying deleted loci ( Figure S3 ) . qPCR RNA from locus - deleted clones was extracted with RNAqueous - Micro Kit ( Ambion ) . cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III First - Strand Synthesis SuperMix ( Invitrogen ) . qPCR samples were mixed with SyBrgreener ( Invitrogen ) and run on BioRad CFX96 . qPCR primers are listed in Table S3 . ChIP - Seq Cultured cells were ﬁxed with 1 % formaldehyde ( Sigma ) for 10’ at 37 ! C . Fixation was quenched by addition of glycine ( Sigma ) at a ﬁnal concentration of 125 mM . Twenty million ﬁxed cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 6 ] , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 3 Complete Mini EDTA free proteinase inhibitor [ Roche ] ) or stored at " 80 ! C until further processing . Sonication was performed using Covaris S2 sonicator at duty cycle 20 % , intensity 5 , cycle / burst 200 for 30 min . Five to ten micrograms of anti - NIPBL ( Bethyl , A301 - 779A ) , anti - p300 ( Santa Cruz , SC - 584 ) , anti - Med12 ( Bethyl , A300 - 774A ) , anti - H3K27Ac ( Abcam ab4279 - 100 ) , anti - H2AZ ( Abcam , ab4174 - 100 ) , anti - H3K4me1 ( Abcam ab8895 - 50 ) , anti - H3K4me3 ( Millipore 04 - 745 ) , and anti - PU1 ( Santa Cruz , SC - 352 ) was incubated with 40 m l of Dynabeads Protein A ( or G ) for 40 min at room temperature . Antibody - bound beads were added to 500 m l of sonicated chromatin , incubated at 4 ! C over - night , and washed twice with RIPA buffer , twice with RIPA buffer containing 0 . 3 M NaCl , twice with LiCl buffer ( 0 . 25 M LiCl , 0 . 5 % Igepal - 630 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate ) , once with TE ( pH 8 ) plus 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and once with TE ( pH 8 . 0 ) . Crosslinking was reversed by incubating the beads at 65 ! C for 4 hr in the presence of 0 . 3 % SDS and 1 mg / ml Proteinase K . ChIP DNA was puriﬁed by phenol - chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation . DNA was subsequently blunt - ended with End - It DNA end repair kit ( Epicenter ) and A - tailed with Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) in the presence of 200 mM of dATP for 40 min at 70 ! C . Samples were puriﬁed by phenol - chloroform extraction after each reaction . Illumina compatible adaptors ( Illumina or Bioo Scientiﬁc ) were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase ( Enzymatics ) , and the reaction was puriﬁed once with AMpure XP magnetic beads ( Beckman Coulter ) . Samples were PCR ampliﬁed for 18 cycles with KAPA HiFi DNA polymerase mix ( KAPA Biosystems ) and run on a 2 % agarose gel and size - selected at 200 – 300 bp . Thirty - six or 50 bp of sequencing data ( Table S1 ) were acquired on the Illumina GAII or HiSeq2000 ( Illumina ) . DHS - Seq Digital DNase I mapping was performed as described in reference ( Sekimata et al . , 2009 ) . Brieﬂy , we pelleted 1 3 10 8 B cells , washed them with cold PBS and resuspended them in Buffer A ( 15 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 15 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 5 mM EGTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 5 mM spermidine , 0 . 15 mM spermine ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 3 10 6 cells / ml . Nuclei were isolated by dropwise addition of an equal volume of Buffer A containing 0 . 04 % NP - 40 , followed by incubation on ice for 10’ . Nuclei were centrifuged at 1 , 000 g for 5 min and then resuspended and washed with 25 ml of cold Buffer A . Nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer A at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 3 10 7 nuclei / ml . We performed DNase I ( Roche , 10 – 80 U / ml ) digests for 3 0 at 37 ! C in 2 ml volumes of DNase I buffer ( 13 . 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 87 mM NaCl , 54 mM KCl , 6 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 9 mM EDTA , 0 . 45 mM EGTA , 0 . 45 mM Spermi - dine ) . Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume ( 2 ml ) of stop buffer ( 1 M Tris - Cl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5 M NaCl , 20 % SDS and 0 . 5 M EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 10 m g / ml RNase A , Roche ) and incubated at 55 ! C . After 15’ , we added Proteinase K ( 25 m g / ml ﬁnal concen - tration ) to each digest reaction and incubated for one hour at 55 ! C . After DNase I treatment , phenol - chloroform extractions were performed . Control ( untreated ) samples were processed as above except for the omission of DNase I . DNase I double - cut fragments and sequencing libraries were constructed as described in the ChIP - seq protocol with the exception of the size - selection of 300 - 400 bp . RNA - Seq Total RNA from 10 6 ES , resting , or activated B cells was isolated by Trizol extraction . To obtain more precise measurements of tran - scription , RNA spike - ins were used by adding 1 m l of 1 / 10 dilution of Ambion’s ERCC RNA Spike - in Mix ( catalog number 4456740 ) to Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . S1 total RNA . mRNA was then isolated and the standard RNA - Seq library preparation was performed following Illumina’s RNA - Seq protocol v2 . Bi - Seq Genomic DNA was isolated from 5x10 6 cells using QIAGEN DNeasy blood and tissue kit . Libraries were prepared following whole - genome bisulﬁte sequencing for methylation analysis guide from Illumina ( 15021861 _ B ) with slight modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , 5 m g of genomic DNA was sheared and blunt - ended with End - It DNA end repair kit ( Epicenter ) and A - tailed with Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) in the presence of 200 mM of dATP for 40 min at 70 ! C . Illumina compatible adaptors ( 5 0 P - GATXGGAAGAGXGGTTXAG XAGGAATGXXGAG , 5 0 AXAXTXTTTXXXTAXAXGAXGXTXTTXXGATXT where X is a methylated cytosine ) were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase ( Enzymatics ) . Adaptor - ligated DNA of 275 - 350 bp was isolated by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis , and sodium bisulﬁte conversion performed on it using the Epitect Bisulﬁte kit ( QIAGEN ) . Bisulﬁte converted DNA was divided in three tubes and PCR ampliﬁed for 6 cycles by PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) . The reaction products were puriﬁed using the MinElute PCR puriﬁcation kit ( QIAGEN ) then separated by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and puriﬁed from the gel using the MinElute gel puriﬁcation kit ( QIAGEN ) . ChIA - PET RNA PolII ChIA - PET was performed as previously described ( Fullwood et al . , 2009 ; Goh et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) . Brieﬂy , B or ES cells ( up to 3x10 9 cells ) were treated with 1 % formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then neutralized using 0 . 2 M glycine . The crosslinked chromatin was subjected to fragmentation with an average length of 300 bp by sonication . The anti - PolII monoclonal antibody 8WG16 ( Covance , MMS - 126R ) was used to enrich PolII - bound chromatin fragments . A portion of ChIP DNA was eluted off from antibody - coated beads for concentration quantiﬁcation using Picogreen ﬂuorimetry and for enrichment analysis using quanti - tative PCR . For ChIA - PET library construction ChIP DNA fragments from two biological replicates were end - repaired using T4 DNA polymerase ( NEB ) and ligated to either linker A or linker B . Other than four nucleotides in the middle of the linkers that were used as nucleotide barcode , the two linkers share the same nucleotide sequences . After linker ligation , the two samples were combined for proximity ligation in diluted conditions . During the proximity ligation , DNA fragments within the same ChIP complex with the same linker were ligated , which generated the ligation products with homodimer linker composition . However , chimeric ligations between ChIP fragments that are bound in different chromatin complexes could also occur , thus producing ligation products with heterodimer linker composition . These heterodimer linker composition products were used to assess the frequency of nonspeciﬁc ligations and were then removed bioinformatically . As shown in Figure S2A , all heterodimer linker ligations are by deﬁnition nonspeciﬁc . Because random intermolecular associations in the test tube are expected to be comparable for linkers A and B , the frequency of random homo and heterodimer linker ligations must also be equivalent . In our PolII ChIA - PET libraries , only 3 . 8 % of pair - end ligations ( PETs ) involved heterodimer linkers . Thus , we estimate that less than 5 % of total homodimer ligations are nonspeciﬁc . Even though this represents but a small number of PETs , we reduced this number even further by discarding singleton PETs . In other words , we only report PolII long - range interactions when two or more pair - end reads create a PET cluster ( Figure S2A ) . The strategy is based upon the fact that random heterodimer ligations rarely form PET clusters . In the PolII ChIA - PET libraries for instance , of 487 , 981 het - erodimer PETs , only 26 PET clusters were obtained . Conversely , 9M homodimer PETs created # 15 , 000 PET clusters . Thus , while there are # 20 times more homodimer than heterodimer PETs , we obtain # 600 times more homodimer than heterodimer PET clus - ters . Following proximity ligation , the Paired - End - Tag ( PET ) constructs were extracted from the ligation products and the PET tem - plates were subjected to paired - end sequencing using Illumina GAII .

Bioinformatics Analyses DHS - Seq , ChIP - Seq , and RNA - Seq Processing DHS - Seq and ChIP - seq were sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II and the Illumina HiSeq 2000 , following the manufac - turer’s instructions . The standard Illumina pipeline ( versions 1 . 3 to 1 . 8 . 2 ) was used for image analysis and base calling . The software Fastqc was applied to the fastq ﬁles to ensure that the quality of each read position was no less than 28 . Alignment of DHS - Seq and ChIP - Seq Reads Reads were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information mouse genome data ( July 2007 ; NCBI37 / mm9 ) . The align - ment software Bowtie version 0 . 12 . 8 was used with the following options : – best – all – strata - m1 - n2 – l [ read length ] . These options report the reads that align uniquely to the best stratum and allowing 2 mismatches . Alignment of RNA - Seq Reads Strand - speciﬁc B and E14 cell RNA - Seq reads were mapped onto the mouse reference genome ( mm9 ) with SOLiD WTP and analyzed by ABI SOLiD Bioscope ( version 1 . 0 ) analysis pipeline . Expression values were determined in terms of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads ( RPKM ) . For increased precision in transcription measurements , ERCC RNA spike - in mix was added to the total RNA before standard RNA - Seq library preparation ( as described above ) . Reads were aligned against the mouse genome ( build mm9 ) with gsnap using only known splice sites obtained from the Refseq annotation as present in the USCS genome browser database in January 2012 with – novelsplicing = 0 . Subsequently , the same reads were also aligned to the ERCC RNA standard , also with gsnap but not looking for splice sites . The number of reads matching each Refseq gene was then determined using htseq - count while the number of reads matching ERCC standard RNAs was determined by a simple line count . Spike and mRNA counts were then read into R where counts were normalized by library size and exonic size of each gene to obtain RPKM ( reads per kb per million aligned reads ) . A linear model was ﬁt to the ERCC spike data to relate the known copy number to the measured RPKM and cell type : lm ( log10 ( known copy number ) ? log10 ( RPKM ) + cell , data = counts ) . The linear model was then used to estimate the copy number of each expressed gene based on the cell type and measured RPKM . PolII ChIA - PET Processing The pipeline for ChIA - PET sequencing processing is described in ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Brieﬂy , the redundant sequences were collapsed into a nonredundant PET sequence set based on sequence content . The nonredundant PET sequences were analyzed for linker bar - code composition and identiﬁed as sequences with homodimer linker derived from speciﬁc ligation products , or sequences with het - erodimer linker derived from nonspeciﬁc ligation products . The linker composition information was used to evaluate the noise in the ChIA - PET library and sequences with heterodimer linkers were removed . After trimming the linkers , PET sequences were mapped to the mouse reference genome ( mm9 ) using customized BatMis 3 . 0 and only perfectly and uniquely aligned PETs were retained . PETs uniquely aligned and similarly mapped ( within ± 2 bp ) were merged into one PET as they were considered to be derived from the same DNA - fragment ligation with variations in MmeI enzyme digestion . Based on the mapping characteristics , each PET was categorized as a self - ligation PET ( two ends of the same DNA fragment ) or interligation PET ( two ends from two different DNA fragments in the same chromatin complex ) . The PET categories were established by evaluating the mapping orientation and genomic span between two tags of a PET . The interligation PETs were further categorized into intrachromosomal PETs , where the two tags from a PET lay on the same chromosome , and interchromosomal PETs , where the two tags lay on different chromosomes . The self - ligation PETs were utilized as a proxy for ChIP fragments since they provide two deﬁned end points , as described above . The coverage of all self - ligated PET sequences across the genome reﬂects the speciﬁc PolII binding sites , which is analogous to ChIP - seq mapping for protein bind - ing sites . The local summits of the sequence coverage were called as potential peaks if there were multiple self - ligation PETs over - lapping in that region . Assuming multiple self - ligation PETs would not occur by random chance , the random background was set as the maximum of the global tag density , local tag densities at 10 kb and 20 kb windows around the peak , and the Poisson distribution was applied to estimate the p values for the peaks . P values were then adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini - Hochberg false discovery rate method ( B - H FDR method ) . FDRs less than 0 . 05 were used as the criteria for ﬁnal peak calling . Throughout the text , PET clusters with 2 or more PETs are referred to as interactions or connections . Bi - Seq Processing In silico conversion mimicking complete bisulﬁte conversion was performed on the National Center for Biotechnology Information mm9 mouse genome . Speciﬁcally , in silico C / T and G / A mm9 genomes were constructed by converting all C or Gs into T or As . Sequence reads were C / T converted and aligned to the C / T and G / A genomes , resulting in two alignments per sample . Alignments were performed with Bowtie version 0 . 12 . 8 with the options ‘‘ – best - n2 - k2 , ’’ which report the top 2 best alignments . Alignments against the C / T converted genome had the additional option – norc ( only alignments against the forward strand were reported ) and alignments against the G / A converted genome was performed with the additional option – nofw ( only align - ments against the reverse strand were reported ) . The two alignments per sample were merged and sorted using Samtools , and only reads that had a unique alignment with the minimum number of mismatches were retained . Going through all the sorted unique alignments , the number of methylated Cs ( C nucleotide in the original read and C nucleotide in the genome ) and the number of unmethylated Cs ( T nucleotide in the original read and C nucleotide in the genome ) were determined for every position covered . The context of each C was determined and each C was classiﬁed as CpG , CHH , or CHG , where H is either A , T , or C nucleotide . For the CpGs , base positions that were consecutive and on different strands were merged . To ensure proper quality of the methyl - ation calls , a minimal base quality score of 20 and a minimum of 5 uniquely aligned reads covering a given position were required for Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . S3 that position to be considered . For each C nucleotide with sufﬁcient quality and coverage then , we calculated the percentage of methylated C nucleotides with respect to the sum of methylated and unmethylated C nucleotides . For each CG , the difference in percent methylation between KSL or CLP or resting B cells or activated B cells and ES cells was calculated . Deﬁnition of DHS Hotspots and Footprints DHS hotspots were detected using the software DNase2Hotspots with the following parameters : background window size 200 , 000 bp , target window size 250 bp , mergeable gap : 0 , z - score threshold 2 , FDR 0 % . Reads that mapped to chromosome M were removed prior to hotspot detection . The software DNase2Hotspots uses an algorithm that identiﬁes local enrichment of tags in a 250 bp target window relative to a local background window spanning 200 kb . To remove artifacts , reads that overlapped sat - ellites , long interspersed repetitive elements , and short tandem repeats were removed . With the remaining reads , a z - score , ( n – m ) / s is calculated for each target window where n is the original number of tags observed in the target window , m is the expected number of tags overlapping that target window based on the number of mappable reads in the background window , and s is the standard deviation of the expectation . A false discovery rate is estimated for each z - score by calculating z - scores using randomly sampled uniquely mapped reads from the observed data set . Hotspots with 0 % FDR were selected here . Finally , DHS hotspots located within 1 kb of TSSs were merged into promoter domains , while all other DHS were merged into enhancer domains if they were within 2 kb from each other . Transcription factor footprints were called by applying ‘DNase2TF’ , a program that implements a new footprint detection algorithm ( S . Baek , G . L . Hager , M . - H . Sung , unpublished data ) . Brieﬂy , the algorithm looks for regions of local depletion in DNaseI cutting within each hotspot , taking the enzyme’s dinucleotide bias and mappability of sequence reads into account . Candidate intervals are obtained by considering binomial z - scores that reﬂect the depletion in cutting relative to a background window 3 - fold the width of the candidate region and then by merging consecutive intervals . Candidate intervals whose z - scores correspond to FDR < 5 % were retained for subsequent analyses . Annotation of DHS Regions into Promoters and Enhancers The Bedtools software suite was utilized to map the ChIP - seq reads onto the DHS regions . First , the fragment sizes for each ChIP - seq experiment was estimated using macs2 . The 3 0 end of the aligned ChIP - seq reads were then lengthened to match these predicted fragment sizes . Next , the read counts overlapping each DHS region was calculated using bedtools intersect . These overlapping read counts were then normalized to the total number of reads for each epigenetic mark and p values based on the negative binomial dis - tribution of the negative controls ( a combination of negative pull - downs for B cells and IgG for ES cells ) were calculated for each region . DHS regions with a Benjamini - Hochberg FDR - adjusted p value less than 1 % were considered positive . DHS regions that were within 1 Kb of a TSS were denoted DHS - promoter . The remaining regions were classiﬁed as enhancers if they were p300 or Med12 or Nipbl positive . ChIA - PET Cluster Interactions : Deﬁnitions and Annotation Interligation PETs reﬂect long - range chromatin interactions . However , there is technical noise from various sources , which should be inevitably considered . To determine if an interligation PET represents a speciﬁc interaction event between two DNA fragments that are bound together in close spatial proximity by a PolII protein complex , we reasoned that the multiple interligation PETs would be enriched by the ChIP procedure between the same DNA fragments . To identify such chromatin interactions , both ends of the inter - ligation PETs were extended by 500 bp along the reference genome , and PETs overlapping at both ends were clustered together as one PET cluster . The number of PETs in a PET cluster therefore reﬂects the frequency of an interaction between two genomic regions . To determine whether the observed number of PETs in a PET cluster was signiﬁcantly different from background noise or weak interactions represented by singleton interligation PETs , we evaluated p values from a hypergeometric distribution with the tag counts from both anchor regions of PET clusters and the sequencing depth as input . P values were corrected using the B - H FDR method for multiple hypothesis testing and the FDR cutoff is 0 . 05 . Classiﬁcation of PET Clusters In this study , we only considered the intrachromosomal PET clusters with span less than 1 Mb on chromosomes and used the deﬁned DHS regions to annotate PET cluster interactions . DHS regions were extended by 1 . 5 kb in both directions and interaction PET clusters were considered anchored if they overlapped the extended DHS regions by at least 1 base . Interaction PET clusters were then annotated into the following 4 types , according to the type of DHS region they overlapped : intragenic ( promoter to gene internal region ) , extragenic ( promoter to enhancer ) , and intergenic ( promoter to distal promoter ) , and enhancer - enhancer ( neither anchor of a PET cluster overlaps with a DHS promoter region ) . In some cases , interaction PET clusters overlap with both DHS promoters and enhancers . If the interaction PET cluster overlapped with a DHS promoter region and a DHS enhancer region located in the same gene internal region , the interaction was denoted as intragenic interaction . If the interaction PET cluster over - lapped with a DHS promoter and a distal DHS enhancer , the interaction was denoted as an extragenic interaction as shown in Figure S1H . Deﬁning Transcription Models from Chromatin Interactions PET interaction clusters were grouped with other interaction clusters based on what type of DHS region they were anchored to . We then deﬁned three transcription models based on how the gene promoters were involved in these complex chromatin interactions : multigene ( MG ) interaction model , single gene ( SG ) interaction model , and basal promoter ( BP ) model . The MG model comprises intergenic promoter - promoter interactions grouped in an interaction cluster that could also include intragenic and extragenic enhancer - promoter interactions . The SG model consists of single or multiple enhancer interactions with only one gene promoter , S4 Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . whereas the BP model includes genes with PolII binding but no chromatin interaction . MG and SG interaction cluster models were visualized with Cytoscape . Reproducibility of ChIA - PET PolII Peaks and Interactions Since the sonicated fragment size of ChIA - PET library is less than 1 kb , PolII peaks between biological replicates were considered overlapping if the distance from peak center to peak center was within 1 Kb . To account for the sonication fragment size anchors of interaction PET clusters were extended 1 kb at both ends . Extended PET clusters were considered overlapping if they shared at least one nucleotide . Identiﬁcation of lncRNAs Associated Genes The lncRNA - associated genes were identiﬁed by PET clusters , which connected the DHS promoter regions of lnRNA and their target gene . Ensembl version NCBI36 . 67 was utilized for annotation . When a lncRNA associated with multiple genes , the gene with highest connection frequency was selected as the lnRNA - associated gene . Expression levels of lnRNAs and associated genes were measured as reads per kilobase per million reads ( RPKM ) from RNA - Seq sequencing by using Cufﬂinks 2 ( Trapnell et al . , 2013 ) . CpG Methylation Changes across Cell Types RPKM values were calculated for genes annotated using Refseq annotation as found in the USCS genome browser database ( January 2012 ) . Using R , a two - component mixture model was ﬁt to the log - transformed RPKM values and genes with expression levels exceeding the 95 th percentile were considered active while genes with expression levels below the 1 st percentile were consid - ered silent . Methylation levels was averaged over each gene ( TSS ± 200 bp ) and the distribution of methylation levels in silent and active genes were depicted with violin plots ( Figure 5A ) . To assess global demethylation in enhancers across cellular development ( Figure 5D ) , we considered DHS enhancer regions anchored by PETs in activated B cells only . A subset of these regions were noted as demethylated ( average methylation % 40 % ) in activated B cells and the number of these regions is depicted in Figure 5D .

Validation of ChIA - PET Connections via Genome Editing , Related to Figure 2 ( A ) Custom FLASH TALENs were engineered to selectively delete speciﬁc DHS enhancer domains in CH12 B cells or ES cells . The donor construct contains a loxP - PGK promoter / puromycin - T2A - thymidine kinase / PolyA - loxP cassette to select positive clones . PCR primers ( Table S3 ) speciﬁc for genomic and construct sequences were used to verify the insertion of knockout constructs at the desired targeted genomic locus . The cassette was removed by Cre - mediated recombination and clones were selected with Ganciclovir and veriﬁed by PCR . ( B ) Targeted deletion of AID enhancer E1 results in a marked decrease in PolII occupancy at AID gene regulatory domains but not at the Foxj2 - Necap1 locus ( # 190 kb downstream of Apobec1 ) .

Note : We point out that most PolII long - range interactions link E1 to E2 , instead of tethering the enhancers to the Cd79a promoter . One interesting possibility is that these interactions help establish the higher - order chromatin structure of the two loci , which in turn may regulate promoter activity as has been shown at the mouse b - globin locus within the context of CTCF binding ( Phillips and Corces , 2009 ) . Notably , E1 and E2 enhancers in question display clear CTCF occupancy , which might facilitate their association ( depicted with a semi circle ) . A similar scenario applies at the Pax5 locus ( see Figure S7D below ) . Cell 155 , 1507 – 1520 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc .
