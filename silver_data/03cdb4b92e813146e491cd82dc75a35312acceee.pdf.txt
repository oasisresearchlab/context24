This is followed by activation of cellular signalling pathways , endocytic internalization and transport of the virus via the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus . Here we show that the association of SV40 ( as well as isolated pentameric VP1 ) with GM1 is itself sufficient to induce dramatic membrane curvature that leads to the formation of deep invaginations and tubules not only in the plasma membrane of cells , but also in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) . Unlike native GM1 molecules with long acyl chains , GM1 molecular species with short hydrocarbon chains failed to support such invagination , and endocytosis and infection did not occur . To conceptualize the experimental data , a physical model was derived based on energetic considerations . Taken together , our analysis indicates that SV40 , other polyoma viruses and some bacterial toxins ( Shiga and cholera ) use glycosphingolipids and a common pentameric protein scaffold to induce plasma membrane curvature , thus directly promoting their endocytic uptake into cells . SV40 is a non - enveloped DNA virus of the polyoma family . The capsid is 45 nm in diameter , and composed of 72 icosahedrally organized VP1 pen - tamers 1 that each bear five binding sites highly specific for GM1 ( refs 2 , 3 ) , its glycolipid receptor for infection 4 . Incoming SV40 virions attach to sev - eral GM1 molecules 5 , 6 in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and quickly become immobilized by the cortical actin cytoskeleton 7 , 8 . Cholesterol - dependent entry 7 occurs after kinase signalling 7 , 9 via small , tight - fitting indentations 10 , most of which are devoid of caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ; ref . 11 ) . Internalized vesicles are transported via microtubules to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum 12 where the protein folding and retrotranslocation machineries are involved in SV40 export into the cytosol 13 for infection . How the binding of a virion to glycolipids in the exoplasmic leaflet leads to cell entry and infection is not clear . Several other multivalent glycolipid ligands are also internalized by clathrin - independent endo - cytosis 14 – 16 , suggesting that the reorganization of specific lipids into membrane domains 17 , 18 is important for the uptake process 19 – 21 . Indeed , binding of the pentavalent cholera toxin to GM1 induces the formation of membrane domains in vitro 22 , and multivalent binding is required for efficient endocytosis 23 . By binding to up to 15 Gb3 glycolipid molecules , Shiga toxin drives curvature changes of cell and model membranes 24 . Whether multivalent binding and glycolipid structure mediate the proc - ess of cell infection by colloidal viral particles is not known . Here , we investigate the role of the hydrocarbon chain structure of the GM1 receptor molecule in SV40 endocytosis and infection . Based on experimental work with cells and liposomal membranes and on theoretical considerations , a physical model for the formation of SV40 - induced membrane invaginations is derived . Our results indicate that the tight organization of GM1 molecules with specific hydrocarbon chain structures is required for membrane mechanical processes leading to endocytosis and infection by SV40 . RESULTS Dependence of SV40 infection on GM1 hydrocarbon chain structure To test how critical the structure of the GM1 hydrocarbon chain is for cellular uptake and infection , we took advantage of a mutant mouse melanoma cell 1 ETH Zurich , Institute of Biochemistry , HPM E , Schafmattstrasse 18 , 8093 Zurich , Switzerland . 2 Institut Curie , Centre de Recherche , Laboratoire Trafic , Signalisation et Ciblage Intracellulaires , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 3 CNRS UMR144 , France . 4 Institute for Biophysics , TU Dresden , BIOTEC , Tatzberg 47‑51 , D‑01307 Dresden , Germany . 5 UMR Gulliver CNRS‑ESPCI 7083 , 10 rue Vauquelin , 75231 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 6 Glycosciences Laboratory , Imperial College London , Harrow , Middlesex , HA1 3UJ , UK . 7 M010 , German Cancer Research Center ( DKFZ ) , D‑69120 Heidelberg , Germany . 8 Institut Curie , Centre de Recherche , Laboratoire Physico‑ Chimie , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 9 Université P . et M .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S line , GM95 , that lacks all glucose - based glycolipids 25 . We incorporated GM1 species with differing lipid chain compositions 26 , 27 into these cells . GM1 with C18 : 1 / C20 : 1 sphingosine molecules and C18 : 0 fatty acids ( native , nt - GM1 , Fig . 1a ) was used as a control . After GM95 cell reconstitution with nt - GM1 , the lipid was evenly distributed in the plasma membrane , as judged by the homogeneous appearance of fluorescently labelled cholera toxin B - subunit ( CTxB – FITC ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , another natural GM1 ligand 28 . This situation was similar to the one found on cells that naturally express GM1 ( data not shown ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) demonstrated that the GM1 - bound CTxB – FITC was mobile in the plane of the membrane ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Moreover , confocal microscopy showed that CTxB was efficiently internalized by endo - cytosis ( data not shown ) . We concluded that nt - GM1 was integrated as a functional component of the plasma membrane , as demonstrated previously by electron spin resonance 27 . Whereas Cy5 - labelled SV40 failed to associate with untreated GM95 cells ( Fig . 1b ) , it bound to nt - GM1 - supplemented cells to a similar extent as to wild - type murine cells ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast to untreated cells that were totally resistant to infection , up to 76 % of the cells supplemented with nt - GM1 were infected , as indicated by T - antigen expression . The level of infection depended on the amounts of GM1 and SV40 used ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b , c ) . As in normal host cells , infection was inhibited by extraction of cellular cholesterol ( mβCD ) , inhibition of tyrosine kinase activ - ity ( genistein ) , disruption of microtubulules ( nocodazole ) and interference with the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton ( jasplakinolide and latrunculin A ; Fig . 1c ) 7 , 29 . By supplementing cells with GM1 , we could thus reconstitute the normal , productive entry pathway of SV40 in GM95 cells . Next , GM95 cells were supplemented with GM1 species with differing tail structures . One was a GM1 molecule with short fatty acid chains ( C8 ) , and the others ( DL , DP and DO ) were glycerophospholipids with differing saturation levels and lengths of lipid chains to which the GM1 pentasaccharide was conjugated through the amino group of the phos - phatidylethanolamine ( Fig . 1a ; Methods ) 27 , 30 .

A RT I C L E S species needed to result in a level of binding comparable to that found on cells supplemented with nt - GM1 ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . To make sure that the different lipid species were properly inserted into the plasma membrane , lateral CTxB – FITC mobility was confirmed under all conditions by FRAP analysis ( data not shown ) . We then analysed the binding of SV40 to these reconstituted cells using virus - like particles ( VLPs ) , which are recombinant capsids composed exclusively of VP1 proteins 3 , 31 , 32 . VLPs behave as intact virus with respect to receptor binding and endocytosis , but are devoid of viral DNA as well as internal capsid proteins . SV40 - VLP binding was similar between cells reconstituted with the different GM1 species ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1e , f ) . However , only GM1 species with long acyl chains , DP ‑ and DO - GM1 , supported SV40 infection ( Fig . 1d ) . The levels of infection were 88 . 9 ± 15 . 1 % and 26 . 8 ± 7 . 4 % , respectively , compared with nt - GM1supple - mented cells . In contrast , infection in cells that were supplemented with short chain species was close to background levels ( Fig . 1d ) . We concluded that a ceramide base structure was not an absolute requirement for glycoli - pid receptor function , but acyl chain length was critical . To determine which step in the infectious entry programme required a receptor lipid with long acyl chains , GM95 cells were supplemented with either nt - GM1 or C8 - GM1 . The latter was chosen to represent a non - permissive receptor species . Confocal microscopy after indirect immunofluorescence labelling of internalized particles showed that only nt - GM1 supported efficient endocytosis of the virus ( Fig . 1e ) .

A RT I C L E S internalization in C8 - GM1 - supplemented cells was reduced to 34 . 4 ± 1 . 5 % when compared with nt - GM1 supplemented cells ( Fig . 1f ) , probably rep - resenting particles taken up by non - infectious pathways . Caveolin - independent membrane invagination in cells A few minutes after binding to CV - 1 cells , transmission electron microscopy showed SV40 particles in small invaginations that some - times extended to enclose few virions ( Fig . 2a ) and in tight - fitting early endocytic vesicles lacking sub - membrane , electron - dense material 10 , 12 . The close contact between virus and the plasma membrane and the formation of tight - fitting indentations differentiates SV40 and other polyomavirus family members from most other viruses . When high VLP doses of mouse polyomavirus , a closely related virus with a similar structure 33 , ganglioside receptor 4 , 26 and endocytic pathway 8 , 34 , 35 , were used , even longer tubular structures were observed that extended from the plasma membrane and contained a continuous row of particles ( Fig . 2b , arrowheads ) . These thin ( 50 – 60 - nm diameter ) tubules could thus penetrate the cortical actin meshwork , which has a mesh size of 200 – 300 nm ( ref . 36 ) . Electron microscopy images indicated an inward - directed budding process , as if the virus particles directly participated in the induction of membrane curvature by binding to gangliosides . To test this possibility , we blocked active cellular processes , such as coat dynamics and membrane traffic , in CV - 1 and HeLa cells by using metabolic inhibitors to deplete energy . We hypothesized that this treatment would abolish abscission of VLP - containing invaginations from the plasma membrane . Starting 20 – 30 min after addition to such cells , fluorescently labelled SV40 - VLPs were found to induce numerous tubular , virus - containing structures of variable length that in some cases reached several microns into the cyto - plasm and contained the majority of SV40 particles ( Fig . 2c ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) . These tubules did not form in the absence of virus ( data not shown ) , and using the membrane dye FM - 1 - 43 FX , it was found that they were connected to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2e ) . Incubation of SV40 - VLPs with Cav - 1 - negative mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to the formation of identical tubular structures ( Fig . 2d ) . Furthermore , tubules in wild - type cells did not colocalize with endogenous Cav - 1 immunostaining ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2c ) and , even before tubule forma - tion , SV40 - VLPs rarely colocalized with Cav - 1 – GFP in normal ( Fig . 2f ) or energy - depleted cells ( Fig . 2g ) , as observed by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . These findings are consistent with previ - ously published immuno - electron microscopy experiments in which only 13 – 20 % of viruses on the cell surface were associated with anti - Cav - 1 gold 37 , and confocal microscopy experiments on Cav - 1 - expressing cells in which only about 1 out of ten viruses associated with Cav - 1 , and few entered together with Cav - 1 ( ref . 11 ) . We concluded that SV40 induces the formation of membrane invaginations without the help of active cellular machinery or caveolar coats . Interference with the actin cytoskeleton , depletion of cholesterol or inhibition of tyrosine kinases in non energy - depleted cells also led to SV40 - VLP - induced tubule formation ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) , suggesting that these factors have a role in the scission process . On the other hand , treatment of cells with the dynamin - inhibitor dyna - sore did not result in tubule formation ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) , indicating that the budding of SV40 binding - induced mem - brane invaginations is dynamin - independent , which is consistent with previous reports 11 . SV40 binding - induced membrane invaginations — properties of GM1 To test whether SV40 binding to GM1 was sufficient to induce mem - brane invagination , we incubated fluorescently labelled VLPs with GUVs made of a mixture of 1 , 2 - dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ; 68 mol % ; spiked with 1 mol % BodipyFl - C5 - HPC ) , cholesterol ( 30 mol % ) and nt - GM1 ( 1 mol % ) .

A RT I C L E S seconds membrane invaginations were formed that contained the VLPs ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . These invaginations had a similar morphology to those observed in cells and their formation did not require the presence of cholesterol in the lipid mixture ( data not shown ) . Mouse polyomavirus - VLPs also induced tubular invaginations on GUVs containing the ganglioside GD1a ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) , the polyomavirus cellular receptor 4 , 26 , 38 . When the different GM1 species were incorporated into GUVs , addition of SV40 - VLPs led to efficient binding in all cases . However , VLPs failed to induce invaginations in GUVs that contained the two short chain species C8 and DL ( Fig . 3b , c ) . In contrast , lipid species with longer acyl chains ( DP , DO and DS — di - stearoyl - GM1 , which could not be incorporated into cells at non - toxic concentrations ) supported the formation of invaginations , independently of their saturation status ( Fig . 3d – f ) . These observations demonstrated that the structure of recep - tor lipid tails was essential for the virus - induced formation of invagina - tions on GUVs , as observed for endocytosis and infectivity in cells . SV40 binding - induced membrane invaginations — properties of SV40 In virus particles and VLPs , the VP1 molecules provide a surface with 360 regularly spaced binding sites for the GM1 glycan moiety . To test whether the number and colloidal topology of binding sites was criti - cal for tubule formation , we expressed and purified recombinant VP1 pentamers that are incapable of assembly into VLP capsids 39 . When flu - orescence - labelled and incubated with energy - depleted CV - 1 cells , such VP1 proteins induced long invaginations ( Fig . 4a ) . CTxB , whose five GM1 - binding sites are arranged in an identical geometry to that found on the SV40 VP1 pentamer 2 , also induced invaginations ( Fig . 4b ) . In contrast , an antibody against cell - bound GM1 failed to induce invagina - tions , even when crosslinked by a secondary antibody ( Fig . 4c ) . These results indicated that the spatial organization of the GM1 - binding sites was critical for tubule formation . Crosslinking of GM1 via antibodies did not allow tubule formation , which required the pen - tavalent organization of binding sites , as found in VP1 and CTxB mole - cules . This was confirmed on GUVs containing nt - GM1 . VP1 and CTxB induced invaginations ( Fig . 4d , e ) , whereas the crosslinked anti - GM1 antibody did not ( Fig . 4f ) . Interestingly , VP1 - induced tubule formation was also sensitive to lipid structure in that tubules failed to form on GUVs that were made with C8 - GM1 ( Fig . 4g ) . This result is similar to that observed for infection ( Fig . 1d ) , endocytosis ( Fig . 1e , f ) and VLP - induced tubule formation on GUVs ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Some differences could be observed between isolated VP1 pentam - ers or CTxB proteins and intact , colloidal viral capsids . The time lag between ligand addition to GUVs and the formation of invaginations was much longer for isolated pentamers ( minutes ) than for SV40 - VLPs ( seconds ) . When we repeated these experiments in nt - GM1 containing GUVs that were made from a lipid mixture that generates a more rigid , liquid - ordered ( l o ) phase ( 40 . 7 mol % brain SM , 13 . 6 mol % cholesterol , 40 . 7 mol % DOPC and 5 mol % GM1 ) , SV40 - VLPs were still able to induce membrane invaginations ( Fig . 5a ) . However , CTxB failed to form tubules under these conditions . Furthermore , SV40 - VLPs induced tubules on GUVs with a high membrane tension ( data not shown ) , in contrast to CTxB ( data not shown ) and Shiga toxin B - subunit 24 . We concluded that the pre - curved colloidal organization of GM1 - binding sites on the virion was not necessary for membrane deformation and tubulation , but it made the process more efficient , enabling it to overcome high membrane ten - sion and rigidity . In a previous study , we found that the pentameric Gb3 glycolipid - bind - ing Shiga toxin B - subunit ( STxB ) can induce tubule formation in cells and GUVs with kinetics similar to the kinetics of tubule induction by SV40 pentamer and CTxB 24 . Like SV40 capsids , STxB required glycosphingoli - pid receptor species with long acyl - chains for tubule formation . However , for STxB - induced membrane tubulation , the Gb3 acyl - chains needed to be unsaturated , suggesting a difference in the underlying physical mecha - nism between the spherical capsids and the pentameric proteins .

A RT I C L E S A physical model for SV40 binding - induced membrane deformation The formation of membrane tubules by the aggregation of membrane - bound monomers ( which may either be small proteins such as toxins or VP1 pentamers , or large spherical capsids , Fig . 6a ) can be understood from a generic physical model that couples the thermodynamics of phase separation to the mechanics of membrane deformation ( Supplementary Information , Theoretical model ) . Tubule nucleation and growth is con - trolled by the free energy difference , ∆ F N = E neck – N ( ∆ e + kT log ϕ 1 ) , between N species being either aggregated in a tubule or isolated on the membrane . Here , E neck is the energy of the toroidal neck connecting the tubule to the membrane ( Fig . 6b ) , and ∆ e and kT log ϕ 1 are the energy gain and entropy loss , respectively , when a species joins a growing tubule ( ϕ 1 is the surface fraction , concentration × species area , of the isolated species on the membrane and kT ~ 2 . 5 kJ mol – 1 is the thermal energy ) . Tubules can form if the energetic gain overcomes the entropic loss , which requires a sufficiently high species density on the membrane : ϕ 1 > e – ∆ e / kT . Tubules nucleate in a typical time controlled by a free energy barrier ∆ F c ( Fig . 6b ) , which is strongly influenced by the cost of membrane defor - mation in the tubule neck ( Supplementary Information , Theoretical model ) . The insensitivity of spherical VLP - induced tubule formation to membrane tension and other factors such as the lipid tail saturation , as opposed to what is observed for individual proteins , stems directly from the properties of the energy difference ∆ e , as discussed below . Because of their intrinsic curvature , large spherical VLPs imprint a close to tubular shape onto the membrane to which they adhere . Membrane tension can influence the virus - induced membrane defor - mation and tubulation only to the extent that it prevents the membrane e d c b f h i g j k n t - G M 1 SV40 - VLP DiI Merge C 8 - G M 1 D L - G M 1 D O - G M 1 D S - G M 1 D P - G M 1 VLP nt - GM1 VP1 nt - GM1 VLP C8 - GM1 VP1 C8 - GM1 a SV40 DHPC Merge F l u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y F l u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y F l u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y F l u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y Radial distance Radial distance Radial distance Radial distance Figure 5 Clustering and domain formation analysis .

A RT I C L E S wrapping around the capsids , which requires tensions in the order of the high adhesion energy ; about 10 kT per GM1 molecule 40 , or 10 – 3 J m – 2 . Individual pentameric proteins on the other hand are fully bound to the membrane , whether in tubules or not . Membrane tubulation is in this case not driven by protein – lipid adhesion , but is the result of protein clustering due to the existence of a line tension µ ~ 0 . 5 pN between lipid - domains of different composition and ordering 41 . Individual pentamers or toxins should not be able to form tubules if the membrane tension is larger than the ratio of the line tension to the particle size ( γ ~ µ / a , Supplementary Information , Theoretical model ) , which we estimate to be in the order of 10 – 4 J m – 2 . Furthermore , the kinetics of tubule nuclea - tion is largely controlled by the tension - dependent energy of the tubule neck , and we expect tubule nucleation to be slow when the line energy associated with membrane deformation is larger than the line tension of the clustered domain ( √ κγ > μ , with membrane bending rigidity in the order of κ ~ 20 kT , Supplementary Information , Theoretical model ) , which we estimate to be about 10 – 5 J m – 2 ( or smaller when the membrane is in the more rigid l o - state and Shiga toxin fails to induce membrane invaginations ) 42 . These considerations explain a number of experimental findings . SV40 - VLPs can induce tubules even on GUVs with a membrane tension in the order of 10 – 3 J m – 2 , close to the lysis tension of a bilayer . In contrast , indi - vidual VP1 pentamers and toxins only form tubules in relatively ‘floppy’ vesicles with tensions in the order of 10 – 5 J m – 2 . Furthermore , these obser - vations clarify why several minutes are required for tubule nucleation by pentamers and CTxB , which is similar to what is observed with the Shiga toxin system 24 , in comparison to seconds with SV40 capsids . The structure of the receptor tail can influence two important mem - brane properties : the degree of lipid ordering , related to the line tension of glycolipid receptor - enriched membrane domains , and mechanical properties , expressed by the bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature . Whereas the former property is crucial to the aggregation process of both individual proteins ( pentamers or toxins ) and spherical VLP capsids , the latter should only influence the tubulation induced by individual pro - teins , as adhesion of VLP s onto membranes is by itself sufficient to create strong curvature . Our findings show that long acyl chains are required for the induction of tubules by both capsids and individual pentamers , strongly suggesting that the effect is mediated by line tension . Indeed , both SV40 - VLPs and VP1 pentamers form lateral aggregates shortly after binding to nt - GM1 - containing GUVs ( Fig . 5b , c ) , whereas such aggregates were not detectable in C8 - GM1 - containing GUVs ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Receptor tail length should also have a strong influence on the nucleation of membrane phase separation . In agreement with this prediction , SV40 was found in l o phase membranes when associated with saturated long chain GM1 molecules , and in the l d phase when GUVs were made with short chain GM1 species ( Fig . 5f ) . Saturated receptor chains were found to prevent membrane invagination by shiga toxin 24 , but did not modify the ability of the capsid to induce tubules . A likely explanation is that tail saturation strongly couples to spontaneous negative curvature , possibly by amplifying a head group compaction and chain splaying effect . This property is crucial for membrane tubulation induced by small proteins 24 , but dispensable in the case of intrinsically curved spherical capsids . The picture emerging from the arguments summarized above and detailed in the Supplementary Information is that although pentamers and capsids share a common aspect related to lipid organization and line tension for their clustering , the mechanisms that drive membrane deformation are different . Capsids imprint membrane curvature through adhesion , whereas small proteins must promote the emergence of a spon - taneously curved membrane organisation . DISCUSSION From our study it seems that , unlike other viruses that rely on cell - driven processes , SV40 initiates its internalization process by inducing membrane curvature itself from the extracellular side of the membrane through multivalent binding of its VP1 pentamers to cell surface GM1 . The association with caveolae , which is occasionally observed for SV40 but is not essential for entry or infection 11 , 37 , 43 , 44 , probably reflects a preferred localization of the virus to membrane environments with appropriate curvature radii , and does not seem to have a role in the invagination process described here . Indeed , while Cav - 1 expression does not influence the infection efficiency of SV40 , the structure of the hydrocarbon chain of GM1 does so significantly ( Fig . 1 ) . Hence , what we describe here is the infectious pathway of SV40 . In cellular and artificial membranes , the binding of SV40 to GM1 alone suffices to induce the formation of invaginations . The subsequent membrane scission reac - tion to form an endocytic vesicle depends on signal transduction and active cellular fusion factors 7 , 9 , 29 .

The lipid receptors are specifically enriched in the contact area and thereby create an interface between the receptor‑enriched membrane ( lilac ) and the adjacent cellular membrane . In the case of the viral particle , it is the shape of the membrane‑bound surface that drives the formation of an indentation and the minimization of neck energy promotes tubule formation .

The energy of forming a tubular membrane neck around the tubule provides a barrier ( ∆ Fc ) that slows tubule nucleation . Tubules form if the driving force overcomes the loss of entropy and the forces opposing membrane deformation . nature cell biology VOLUME 12 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2010 17 © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The capacity of the virus to induce membrane invaginations is shared with other polyomaviruses and with some bacterial toxins ( Shiga and cholera toxins ) . As they all bear a remarkably similar pentameric organization for association with glycan moieties of glycosphingolipids , we suggest that they exploit a common mechanism that integrates precise require - ments in the hydrocarbon chains of the glycolipid receptors and a com - pact organization of receptor binding sites within the pentameric protein scaffolds . These pentamers serve as nanoscale lipid - clustering devices for membrane mechanical processes leading to the coat - independent formation of endocytic membrane invaginations .

DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb1999 M E T H O D S METHODS Cell culture and Reagents . GM95 are a ceramide - glucosyl - transferase - deficient mouse melanoma cell line , and therefore do not express glucose - based ganglio - sides 25 . Cav‑1 – / – cells are embryonic fibroblasts derived from a Cav‑1 - knockout mouse 45 . CV - 1 and murine 3T6 Swiss albino fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection . All cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and 4 mM Glutamax ( culture medium ) and maintained at 37 ºC in 5 % CO 2 . Di - oleoyl - phosphatidylcholine , cholesterol , sphingomyelin and nt - GM1 were from Avantilipids . Fluorescence - labelled CTxB and transferrin , DiIC18 , DiOC18 , Bodipy - FL - C5 - DHPC and latrunculin A were from Invitrogen . The anti - Cav - 1 antibody was rabbit N20 anti - Cav - 1 from Santa Cruz . GM1 glycolipids . The native ( nt ) GM1 ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) had either an 18 or 20 carbon - atom sphingosine base that was monounsaturated near the headgroup ( C18 : 1 , C20 : 1 ) , and a fully saturated 18 carbon - atom fatty acid chain ( C18 : 0 ) as specified by the supplier and verified by electrospray mass spectrometry . For greater flexibility in design , the GM1 pentasaccharide was coupled to phosphati - dylethanolamine ( PE ) . Di - oleoyl - PE , which has two monounsaturated C18 chains within the plane of the bilayer ( C18 : 1 ) , di - lauroyl - PE which has two short satu - rated acyl chains ( C12 : 0 ) , di - palmitoyl - PE ( C16 : 0 ) and di - stearoyl - PE ( C18 : 0 ) were used to yield DO - GM1 , DL - GM1 , DP - GM1 and DS - GM1 , respectively . Preparation of neoglycolipids . Neoglycolipids of the GM1 pentasaccharides ( Accurate Chemicals ) were prepared with four PEs , 1 , 2 - dilauroyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanol amine ( DLPE , Sigma ) , 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoeth - anolamine ( DPPE , Sigma ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DOPE , Fluka ) and 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DSPE , Sigma ) essentially as described previously 30 . Briefly , water ( 5 μl ) , phospholipid ( 100 μl , 5 μg μl – 1 in CHCl 3 / MeOH 1 : 1 , by vol ) and freshly prepared tetrabutylam - monium cyanoborohydride solution ( 20 μl , 20 μg μl – 1 in MeOH ) were added to 100 nmol of lyophilized pentasaccharide . The reaction mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 60 h . The neoglycolipid products were analysed by high - performance thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) , purified using silica cartridges ( Waters Sep - Pak , 500 mg silica ) and quantified based on orcinol - hexose response 30 using the neoglycolipid of lactoneotetraose as a standard . Mass spectrometric analyses of glycolipids and neoglycolipids . Molecular masses of the neoglycolipids of GM1 pentasaccharide were determined by matrix - assisted desorption / ionization mass spectrometry on a TOF SPEC 2E instrument ( Micromass ) using 2 , 4 , 6 - trihydroxyacetophenone as the matrix . Their carbohydrate sequence and lipid identity were verified by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry ( ES - MS / MS ) with collision - induced dissociation ( CID ) 46 , carried out on a Q - TOF instrument ( Micromass ) . ES - CID - MS / MS nitrogen was used as desolvation and nebulizer gas at a flow rate of 250 l h – 1 and 15 l h – 1 , respectively . Source temperature was 80 ºC and the desolvation temperature 150 °C . The capillary voltage was maintained at 3 kV and cone voltage at 50 V . Product - ion spectra were obtained from CID with argon as the collision gas at a pressure of 1 . 7 bar . The collision energies for fragmentation were 60 – 65 V . For the analysis , samples were dissolved in CHCl 3 / MeOH / H 2 O 25 : 25 : 8 , at a concentration of 25 pmol μl – 1 , 5 μl of which were loop - injected . The same solvent was used as mobile phase and delivered by a Harvard syringe pump ( Harvard Apparatus ) at a flow rate of 5 μl min – 1 . SV40 virus purification . The protocols for virus purification were based on those described previously 47 . Briefly , monkey kidney CV - 1 cells were cultured in complete medium : Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM from Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS , LabForce ) , 4 mM GlutaMAX , and 50 mM HEPES ( Gibco ) at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . Forty T175 flasks of sub - confluent CV - 1 cells were infected with SV40 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 01 . Cells were cultured in complete medium for 14 days . To collect virus , cells were put through three freeze - thaw cycles , and then centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 °C . Virus - containing supernatant ( 30 ml ) was loaded on a 10 - ml cushion of CsCl ( 1 . 4 g ml – 1 ) in 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 . Following centrifugation at 76 , 000 g for 3 h at 4 °C in a SW28 rotor ( Beckman ) , the banded virus in the CsCl cushion was collected . The density of the CsCl fraction containing SV40 was checked and the fraction was adjusted to a CsCl density of 1 . 34 g ml – 1 in 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 . Following equilibrium centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 16 h at 4 °C in a 70 . 1 Ti rotor ( Beckman ) , the lower virus band was isolated , and dialysed against 50 mM HEPES at pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl 2 ( virus buffer ) . The purified infectious virus was stored in aliquots at – 80°C . Virus - like particle ( VLP ) Purification . SV40 - VLPs were generated as described previously 32 from lysates of SF9 cells that expressed SV40 VP1 . Lysates contained fully assembled SV40 - VLPs as well as assembly intermediates and unassembled VP1 protein . To purify the fully assembled VLPs , lysates were clarified by cen - trifugation for 30 min at 10 , 000 g in an Eppendorf microfuge . The clarified super - natant ( 0 . 5 ml ) was centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 . 5 h at 160 , 000 g using a SW41Ti rotor ( Beckman ) through a 5 – 20 % ( w / v ) linear sucrose gradient with a 0 . 5 ml 60 % ( w / w ) sucrose cushion in 10 mM HEPES at pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl 2 . After fractionation , 0 . 5 ml fractions were analysed by transmission electron microscopy following negative staining , and fractions with homogenous intact particle populations were pooled . The purified particles were dialysed against virus buffer and stored at – 80°C . In later experiments , the VLPs were collected from the medium of baculovirus - infected Sf9 following cell lysis , 5 days post - infection , as follows : intact cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 6 , 000 g for 10 min . The supernatant was further clarified at 17 , 000 g for 20 min . VLPs were precipitated at 80 , 000 g for 3 h . The VLP pellet was suspended in 0 . 5 M NaCl , purified by ultrafiltration and treated as above . Labelling of SV40 - VLPs . Cy - 5 ( Amersham Biosciences ) , atto - 565 ( atto - tec ) , FITC ( Sigma ) or biotin ( Pierce ) were covalently coupled to SV40 - VLPs in 0 . 2 M NaHCO 3 at pH 8 . 2 using a 10 - fold molar excess of the dye relative to VP1 protein , and resulting in less than 200 fluorophore and / or biotin molecules per VLP as determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Unbound dye was removed by chromatography with a Nap - 5 column ( Amersham Biosciences ) . The modified SV40 - VLPs were able to bind , enter and traffic within CV - 1 cells to the same extent as non - modified infectious SV40 as described previously 6 ( data not shown ) . Supplementation of GM95 cells . Lipid supplementation was as described pre - viously 48 , adapted from a protocol 49 . GM95 cells were grown in Lab - tek 8 - well coverglass culture chambers for three days . Cells were washed with serum - free culture medium and incubated in 200 μl of serum - free culture medium in the presence of nt - GM1 ( 19 μM ) , C8 - GM1 ( 7 μM ) , DL - GM1 ( 1 . 25 μM ) , DO - GM1 ( 1 . 25 μM ) or DP - GM1 ( 10 μM ) . Because lipid incorporation into cellular mem - branes is strongly influenced by its hydrocarbon chains , lipid - addition condi - tions were standardized to allow equivalent levels of plasma membrane GM1 as detected by CTxB plasma membrane staining , as detailed below . Cells were then cultured at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 48 h to allow uptake and incorporation of the glycolipids . To remove unincorporated glycolipids , the cells were then cooled to 4 ºC , and washed with DMEM supplemented with 25 % FCS , 4 mM GlutaMAX and 50 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 . Quantification of membrane - incorporated GM1 . After lipid addition with each GM1 species , live cells were incubated for 15 min with 1 μg ml – 1 CTxB – Cy5 in phosphate buffered saline , washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope . Settings were adjusted such that the strongest staining observed throughout the experiment just saturated a few pixels to ensure a high dynamic range . Confocal slices were taken 2 μm above the substrate and the fluorescence in a line perpendicular to the cell membrane was quantified . The highest intensity pixels in the peaks representing the cellular plasma membrane on both ‘sides’ of the cell were compared , to yield unambiguous quantitative binding data . Analysis of SV40 infection . For infection assays , cells were incubated with infec - tious SV40 virus at an MOI of 200 ( as judged by plaque assay in reference host CV1 cells ) in inoculation media or with inoculation medium only as a negative control , in 200 μl for 2 h at 37 ºC . Cells were then washed with serum - containing phenol - red free culture medium to remove unbound virus and were maintained in phenol - red free culture medium at 37 ºC in 5 % CO 2 for an additional 18 h . Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4 % ( w / v ) and viral T - antigen expression was immuno - detected by epi - fluorescence microscopy to identify SV40 - infected cells . Hoechst ( Sigma ) staining of the nuclei was used to determine the total number of cells per field .

M E T H O D S DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb1999 ( data not shown ) . The cell infection rate in the nt - GM1 - supplemented GM95 cell line was 76 . 6 % for a MOI = 200 . Infection was normalized to the rate in nt - GM1 - supplemented GM95 cells . Analysis of SV40 infection in the presence of drugs . After lipid addback , cells were incubated for 1 h with 0 . 1 mM genistein , 0 . 1 μM latrunculin A , 0 . 1 μM jasplakinolide , 1 μM nocodazole , 5 mM methyl - β - cyclodextran or DMSO in inoculation medium . SV40 was added in inoculation medium supplemented with the respective drugs at an MOI of 200 . After 20 h of incubation at 37ºC , cells were processed and quantified as indicated above . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . For FRAP , we bound 0 . 5 μg ml – 1 of FITC – CTxB to supplemented cells for 15 min , washed with PBS and photobleached a circular area of 2 . 7 - μm in diameter by 10 iterations of the 488 nm laser of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope set to 6 A at 100 % output . Fluorescence recovery was imaged at 0 . 1 % laser output for 20 consecu - tive frames . Energy depletion of cells and tubule formation . Cellular energy was depleted by incubating HeLa cells in PBS + + supplemented with 10 mM 2 - deoxy - D - glucose and 10 mM NaN 3 for 30 min at 37 °C . Residual ATP levels were 2 . 1 % under energy - block conditions , similar to a previous report 50 . HeLa , CV - 1 and Cav - 1 – / – cells were depleted in cellular energy for 30 min at 37 °C and further incubated with SV40 - VLPs ( 25 – 250 μg ml – 1 ) and SV40 - Pentons ( 10 μg ml – 1 ) for 1 h at 37 °C in energy depletion medium enriched in BSA ( 0 . 1 % ) . Cells were fixed in PFA 4 % at 37 °C and imaged on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope . Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) . GUVs were grown using the electroformation technique as previously described 24 , 51 . Lipid mixtures contain - ing the different GM1 species were prepared in chloroform / methanol with the appropriate lipid ratio . Vesicles were grown in a solution of sucrose . The size of observed vesicles ranged between 5 and 50 μm . GUVs were transferred into a chamber containing various concentrations of labelled SV40 - VLPs , SV40 pen - tamers , Py - VLPs , CTxB or anti - GM1 antibody in PBS buffer for invagination experiments . The difference in density between the outside ( PBS ) and the inside of the vesicles ( sucrose ) led to their sedimentation . Phase - separated GUVs were prepared in a flow chamber and labelled . SV40 - VLPs were added to VLP buffer ( 10 mM HEPES at pH 6 . 8 , 133 mM NaCl and 2 mM CaCl 2 , osmolality adjusted to 330 mOsm kg – 1 , with sucrose ) . Live - cell imaging of cells or GUVs was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope . Observations were made at room temperature and / or at 37 °C . Fluorescence analysis of clustering of VLP and VP1 on GUVs . Radial analysis of fluorescence of VLP and VP1 at the equatorial plane of GUVs was performed with the oval profile plot of software package ImageJ . After masking the fluorescent signal only at the membrane , a circular region of interest was defined surround - ing the vesicle . Starting from the centre of the circular region , we defined n = 360 equally spaced radial sections and added the pixel intensity values for the respective conditions : SV40 - VLPs and SV40 VP1 pentamers with C8 - GM1 and nt - GM1 . The standard deviation is defined as √ ( x – x ) 2 ( n – 1 ) Σ where x is the value of the n th point , and x the mean . Preparation for electron microscopy . Cell were fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( 0 . 05 M sodium cacodylate , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM MgCl 2 and 1 . 25 mM CaCl 2 ) for 20 min at room temperature followed by 1 h in 2 % OsO 4 . After wash - ing in distilled water cells were stained with 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate for 18 h . Further sample preparation was according to standard protocols . TIRF microscopy of SV40 on HeLa Cav - 1 – GFP cells . HeLa cells stably express - ing Cav - 1 – GFP were plated in 8 - well coverglass ( Nunc ) and imaged in PBS , 0 . 2 % BSA . TIRF microscopy was performed in the light microscopy facility of the ETH Zurich ( LMC ) on an inverted Leica DMI 6000B system with a 100× 1 . 47NA objective . Atto - 565 - labelled SV40 - VLPs were added to the media and imaged right after binding to cells in TIRF mode with 90 - nm penetration depth of both the 488 nm and the 561 nm laser lines .

All rights reserved . 1 Supplementary Information Theoretical model We review some theoretical concepts that link aggregation of proteins or virus - like particles ( VLPs ) to the formation of membrane tubules . Tubule statistics . The thermally driven aggregation of membrane - bound monomers ( proteins or capsids ) is controlled by the free energy difference Δ F N between an aggregate containing N monomers and N isolated monomers freely diffusing on the membrane 1 : ! " F N = E neck # N ( kT log $ 1 + " e ) ( 1 ) where E neck is the aggregate ' s interfacial energy ( e . g . the energy of the membrane neck connecting a tubular aggregate to the main membrane ) . The free energy includes the loss of monomer entropy upon aggregation that varies as the log of the monomer concentration ( φ 1 is the surface fraction occupied by isolated monomers , and kT is the thermal energy ) , and the energy gain ( per monomer ) Δ e between an isolated monomer and a monomer in an aggregate . Aggregation occurs for a critical density of monomers φ * 1 for which the free energy is a decreasing function of the aggregate size . The free energy difference typically shows an energy - barrier Δ F c for short tubules of critical size N c . This energy barrier is due to the neck energy and is influenced both the line tension between membrane domains of different composition and by the energy of deformation of the membrane neck ( see Figure 4 ) . Aggregate nucleation occurs after an average nucleation time τ c that varies exponentially with the height of the barrier 2 !

The energy difference ( per monomer ) in and out of a tubule can be decomposed in three parts : Δ e = Δ e adhes + Δ e comp + Δ e deform , including respectively the adhesion energy between membrane and monomer , the energy from inhomogeneities of membrane composition ( e . g . receptor enrichment near the monomer ) , and the energy of membrane deformation . Two size - scales are important in the problem : the size of the monomer a , and the radius of the tubule R . For complete viral capsids a ~ R ( see Figure 2b ) , while for individual pentamers ( or toxins ) , a < < R ( a ~ R / 5 for a virus of 50 nm diameter containing 72 pentamers ) . A third length - scale may play an important role . It is the inverse spontaneous curvature C 0 of the membrane adhered to the monomer , which is asymmetrically enriched in receptors . The energy scales of the problem are given by the membrane - monomer adhesion energy w ( of order to 2 kT per GM1 receptor 3 ) , the membrane bending rigidity κ , and the membrane tension γ . Since membrane binding occurs via specific receptors , membrane composition - gradients near the sites adhered to monomers cause a line - energy proportional to a line tension µ ( the cost of creating an interface of unit length between different membrane compositions ) which increases with the degree of membrane order near the monomer . Expected values for these parameters are given in Table 1 : energy scale for physical parameter monomer ( radius a = 5 nm ) capsid ( radius R = 50 nm ) Adhesion energy W = 10 - 3 J / m 2 w π a 2 = 20 kT w 4 π R 2 = 2000 kT Bending rigidity κ = 20 kT 2 πκ a 2 / R 2 = 5 kT 8 πκ = 500 kT Line tension µ = 0 . 4 pN = 0 . 1 kT / nm µ2 π a = 3 kT µ2 π R = 15 kT Surface tension γ = 10 - 6 – 10 - 3 J / m 2 γπ a 2 = 0 . 02 – 20 kT γ 4 π R 2 = 2 – 2000 kT Deformation line tension !

Small monomers of size a are entirely covered by membrane , whether located to a tubule or not , hence the adhesion energy does not play a role : Δ e adhes = 0 . If neither monomers nor the bound membrane possess intrinsic curvature , monomers initially aggregate into circular domains ( as seen for Shiga toxin 4 ) . This aggregation process results only from the balance between line energy and entropy , and is characterized by the free energy difference ( valid for N > > 1 ) Flat domains : ! " F N = 2 # µ a N $ N ( 2 # µ a + kT log % 1 ) ( 3 ) Domains should steadily grow beyond a nucleation size N c , which corresponds to the maximum of this energy . The typical delay time to cross this energy barrier τ c increases exponentially with the energy barrier : ! " c = " D e # a µ N c kT N c = # µ a 2 # µ a + kT log $ 1 % & ’ ( ) * 2 ( 4 ) with ! " D = # a 2 D $ 1 ~ 10 % 4 $ 1 seconds as the typical time for a diffusion - limited encounter between two proteins ( for a diffusion coefficient D ~ 1 µm 2 / s ) . The nucleation size and the delay time diverge at the critical concentration ! " 1 * = e # 2 $ µ a / kT ~ 4 % , below which no aggregate can form at equilibrium . For larger concentrations , the delay time drops very fast for increasing concentration , and is shorter than 1 sec for φ 1 > 6 % . Line tension alone can force a membrane domain to curve with a radius of curvature of order 4 πκ / µ ( ~ 1 µm , see Table 1 ) 5 . The membrane tubules observed in this work and in 4 have much higher curvature ( R ~ 50 nm ) , and must rely on another mechanism . It is likely to be spontaneous curvature , either of the monomer itself , or of the membrane bound to it . The formation of a tubule is costly in terms of membrane tension , increasing © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . 4 the energy by an amount γπ a 2 per monomer . The free energy Eq . ( 1 ) for tubules thus reads : Tubular domains : ! " F N = E neck # N ( 2 $ µ a # $ a 2 % + kT log & 1 ) ( 5 ) where the neck energy includes both compositional and deformation energy . In its simplest form , valid for λ < < R and N > > 1 , it is ! E neck " 2 # a N ( µ + $ % / 2 ) up to a hemi - spherical aggregate shape ( N ~ ( R / a ) 2 ) and E neck ≅ constant for well - formed tubules . In Eq . ( 5 ) , we have neglected the energy of membrane deformation of individual proteins gained when protein aggregates ( Supplementary Figure 11 ) , which is smaller than the surface tension contribution by a factor at least of order ( a / R ) 2 < < 1 6 . The critical nucleation size and time are now given by : ! " c = " D e # a ( µ + $ % / 2 ) N c kT N c = # a ( µ + $ % / 2 ) 2 # µ a + kT log & 1 ’ # a 2 % ( ) * + , - 2 ( 6 ) This defines a critical monomer concentration for tubule formation ! " 1 * = e # ( $ a 2 % 2 µ a ) / kT , which cannot be reached for γ > 2µ / a ~ ( ~ 10 - 4 J / m 2 ) . At smaller membrane tensions , tubules can form principally , but the nucleation time might be prohibitively long due to the deformation energy of the neck , which starts playing an important role for γ > 4µ 2 / κ ~ 10 - 5 J / m 2 .

Membrane deformation is driven by the adhesion energy , and is prevented under high © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . 5 tension : γ > ! w . The existence of spontaneous membrane curvature can help the deformation by increasing the effective adhesion energy ! w , but is not required . The formation of membrane tubules following colloid aggregation does not necessitate large membrane deformation , since the membrane wrapped around a VLP is already curved . The main limitation to tubule formation by VLPs should thus be that the membrane actually wraps a sizable fraction of a VLP . Once this is achieved , colloid aggregation can be driven by the membrane line tension , or by curvature - mediated attraction between colloids 5 . This sets the maximal tension to be in the order of the binding energy γ < w ~ 10 - 3 J / m 2 . One can also expect that very low membrane tension would favor fully - wrapped , isolated capsids rather than tubular aggregates . We have tested this prediction by permeabilizing GUVs by addition of α - hemolysin resulting in extremely floppy vesicles indicating strongly reduced membrane tension . However under these conditions membrane tubulation could still be observed suggesting that residual membrane tension was preventing full wrapping of SV40 - VLPs ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Theoretical predictions . The discussion above shows that aggregation of small toxins and pentamers is promoted by line tension , but tubulation requires spontaneous curvature and should be highly sensitive to the level of membrane tension . Tubules cannot form in vesicles or cells with γ > 2 µ / a ~ 10 - 4 J / m 2 and their nucleation should be slow for γ > 4µ 2 / κ ~ 10 - 5 J / m 2 . Aggregation of capsids is also expected to be driven by line tension , but does not require spontaneous curvature , and can proceed under conditions of much higher membrane tension γ < w ~ 10 - 3 J / m 2 , because the adhesion energy provides the driving force for membrane deformation . These predictions are a good qualitative agreement with our observations . Indeed , the line tension is strongly dependent on differences of lipid order . Long GM1 acyl chains are known to promote the liquid - ordered ( l o ) membrane phase , and are required for the lateral aggregation of and subsequent membrane tubulation by both capsids and toxins . Saturation of the lipid tails , on the other hand , is thought to modify the spontaneous curvature of the membrane ( i . e . via the “lipid compaction” © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Finally , high membrane tension can prevent toxin - induced tubulation , but does not seem to affect capsid - induced tubulation . Supplementary References 1 . Foret , L . & Sens , P .
