In epithelia , the architecture of actomysin networks can extend beyond the size of a single cell : this results in supracellular actomyosin structures emerging at the scale of a tissue or of the entire animal . Supracellular actomyosin networks are commonly reported in developmental processes and tissue repair during wound healing . These cytoskeletal structures provide large scale mechanical forces and can function as segregating barriers 1 , 2 or as mechanical actuators responsible for tissue remodeling as for example epithelial buckling 3 , closure 4 , 5 , and extension 6 , 7 . While we do have a good understanding of the molecular processes and their regulation controlling the cytoskeleton in the cell , little is known on how cellular properties and mechanics are integrated at the tissue level and ﬁ nally at the animal level to give shape . In this study , we focus on tissue extension and take advantage of a recently established model process : the elongation of the Drosophila egg chamber . The egg chamber is composed of a monolayer follicular epithelium surrounding a 16 - cell germline cyst . During oogenesis , the egg chamber gradually changes its shape from round to elongated by extending along the anterior - posterior ( AP ) axis 8 . Tissue elongation occurs between stage 6 ( S6 ) and S10B , and it is controlled by two distinct processes : global egg chamber fast rotation from S6 to S8 ( refs . 9 , 10 ) and oscillating contractions of basal non - muscle myosin II ( Myo - II ) between S9 and S10B 11 . We here report that during S9 - S10B a supracellular actomyosin network along the dorsal - ventral ( DV ) axis is established via polarized intercellular ﬁ lopodia that interdigitate . Filopodia are dynamic , ﬁ nger - like plasma membrane protru - sions of cells that act as antennae to sense the mechanical and chemical environment , and thus they are often regarded as “ sensory organelles ” 12 , 13 . Filopodia are involved in many biolo - gical processes , such as growth cone guidance , cell migration , wound closure , and macrophage - induced cell invasion 12 – 14 . These thin membrane protrusions are 60 – 200 nm in diameter and contain parallel bundles of 10 – 30 actin ﬁ laments held toge - ther by actin - binding proteins 15 , 16 . The formation of parallel actin bundles and ﬁ lopodia is initiated by the IRSp53 - mediated plasma membrane bending and the recruitment of the small GTPase Cdc42 and its downstream effectors , including ENA / VASP , WASP / N - WASP , and mDia2 ( refs . 17 – 21 ) . These Cdc42 effectors synergistically nucleate actin polymerization to deliver actin monomers to the ﬁ lopodia tip , and thus the barbed end of the actin ﬁ laments is directed towards the protruding mem - brane 17 – 21 . In addition to chemical cue sensing , ﬁ lopodia can probe the mechanical properties of the physical environment surrounding the cell ( e . g . , the extracellular matrix ) 22 – 30 , and eventually apply traction forces 31 , 32 . Nevertheless , it is still unknown whether cells use ﬁ lopodia to mechanically sense each other and if ﬁ lopodia mechanosensitivity plays a role in epithelial morphogenesis . Recently , ﬁ lopodia have been reported to be present between follicular epithelial cells at basal domains 9 . Nevertheless , their regulation and function are yet unknown . By using live - cell imaging together with genetic , optogenetic , and infrared ( IR ) femtosecond ( fs ) laser manipulations , here we demonstrate that ( 1 ) stress ﬁ bers at the basal domain of the Drosophila ovarian follicular epithelial cells exert polarized con - tractile forces parallel to the DV axis both at the intracellular and supracellular scales ; ( 2 ) intercellular ﬁ lopodia , which extend towards the dorsal and ventral sides in a polarized manner , can be mechanosensitive and function as cell – cell anchoring sites between stress ﬁ ber networks , and ( 3 ) both intercellular ﬁ lopodia and intracellular stress ﬁ bers are under the control of the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42 . Our data support the notion that intercellular ﬁ lopodia function as guiding cues organizing F - actin stress ﬁ bers parallel to the egg chamber DV axis . Finally , a Cdc42 - dependent supracellular F - actin network integrates local Myo - II - dependent cellular contractions to drive a global DV - polarized contraction force and AP - directed tissue elongation . Results Supracellular ﬁ bers emerge from interdigitating ﬁ lopodia . During egg chamber elongation at S9 - S10 , the actin stress ﬁ bers at the basal side of follicle cells are polarized and run parallel to the DV direction 33 ( Fig . 1a ) . Actin stress ﬁ bers are periodically dis - tributed along the AP axis with an interval of ~ 9 µm ( as revealed by Fourier analysis in Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) corre - sponding to follicle cell AP length . No periodic F - actin dis - tribution is detected along the DV axis ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This shows that F - actin has a discrete cellular organization along the AP axis but not along the DV axis . Remarkably , a supracellular actin ﬁ ber pattern emerges along the DV axis ( Fig . 1a , d ) . To understand how ﬁ lamentous actin structures spanning multiple cells emerge , we imaged isolated clones with mCD8 membrane marker to discern the organization of F - actin in single cells along the DV axis . Actin bundles radiate from the medial stress ﬁ ber network , and they normally extend to the cell dorsal and ventral cortexes thus forming polarized pro - trusions ( Fig . 1e ) . By performing live imaging of Enabled ( ENA ) , we could con ﬁ rm that these protrusions are ﬁ lopodia ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2a , b ) . Filopodia of opposing cells interdigitate ( Fig . 1f , g ) and penetrate the actomyosin cortex of the neigh - boring cell ( Fig . 1h ) . As shown in previous studies 34 , E - cadherin based junctions are present at the sub - basal cortex including along the ﬁ lopodia ( Fig . 1i ) . While actin bundles extend from medial stress ﬁ bers to the sub - basal cell – cell contact zone forming ﬁ lopodia , Myo - II is not enriched at this zone and concentrates instead in the medial region ( Fig . 1j ) . During stages 7 – 8 , ﬁ lopodia at the basal side of follicle cells are unidirectionally polarized along the DV axis , following the orientation of egg chamber rotation 9 . After egg chamber rotation arrests at the end of S8 , ﬁ lopodia gradually increase their length and become bidirectionally polarized ; they reach their maximal length between middle and late S9 , and then shorten in S10B ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . To summarize , at S9 a supracellular F - actin network parallel to the DV axis emerges from bidirectionally polarized ﬁ lopodia that interdigitate and penetrate the actomyosin cortex of opposing cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Cdc42 controls ﬁ lopodia and stress ﬁ ber formation . It is known that ﬁ lopodia formation is under the control of the Rho - family small GTPase Cdc42 ( refs . 19 , 20 ) . We , therefore , assessed whether Cdc42 is involved in the control of intercellular ﬁ lopodia in fol - licle cells . Firstly , we examined the localization of the Cdc42 protein which , like Rac1 and Rho1 proteins , appeared to be enriched at the sub - basal cell – cell contact zone of follicle cells ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . Chemical and genetic inhibition of Cdc42 activity , but not Rac1 or Rho1 activity , reduced ﬁ lopodia length ( Fig . 2b , c and Supplementary Fig . 3c – f , h , i ) and also affected the ﬁ lopodia directionality ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The inhibition of Cdc42 activity by its dominant - negative ( DN ) form or by the loss - of - function ( LOF ) mutation 35 also decreased the intensity and changed the central / lateral distribu - tion of the basal actomyosin network ( Fig . 2b , d – g and Supple - mentary Fig . 3h , j ) . In contrast , the inhibition of Rac1 or Rho1 activity did not affect the distribution of the medio - basal acto - myosin network ( Supplementary Fig . 3e , g ) . Furthermore , basal Myo - II periodic oscillations were still present with smaller ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15593 - 2 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1921 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15593 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications amplitude in cells with reduced Cdc42 activity in contrast to cells expressing Rho1DN ( Fig . 2h , i and Supplementary Movies 1 – 3 ) . These results show that Cdc42 is required for ﬁ lopodia formation and to organize the basal actomyosin network whereas Rho1 controls the medial actomyosin oscillations . Cdc42 effectors control both stress ﬁ bers and ﬁ lopodia . To further investigate the role of Cdc42 in ﬁ lopodia and stress ﬁ ber formation , we tested three Cdc42 downstream effectors : WASP , Enabled , and Dia 18 – 20 . RNAi inhibition of each effector resulted in similar phenotypes , as observed in Cdc42 downregulation experiments : ( 1 ) ﬁ lopodia length reduction ( Fig . 3a , b ) , ( 2 ) basal Myo - II intensity decrease ( Fig . 3a , c ) , and ( 3 ) central / lateral redistribution of stress ﬁ bers ( Fig . 3a , d ) . Next , we characterized the effect of Cdc42 inhibition on these effectors . Cdc42 activity inhibition by its DN form strongly reduced the medio - basal distribution of all effectors , compared to wild - type cells ( Fig . 3e – h ) . Moreover , concurrent expression of Enabled and Cdc42DN recovered the basal F - actin distribution and also returned the ﬁ lopodia length back to normal ( Fig . 3i – k ) . Similarly , signi ﬁ cant but weaker recovery effects were observed when either WASP or Dia was concurrently expressed with Cdc42DN ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Finally , our data corroborate the notion that Cdc42 signaling controls ﬁ lopodia formation and the organization of medio - basal stress ﬁ bers . a b d e mCD8 moeABD mCD8 moeABD h f 0 0 0 , 114 2 2 – 2 – 2 ( 1 / μ m ) ( 1 / μ m ) AP m agn i t ude D V m agn i t ude a a’ b b’ d d’ c c’ a a’ b b’ d d’ c c’ m CD 8 G F P m CD 8 R F P mCD8GFP mCD8RFP mCD8GFP mCD8RFP g mCD8 F - actin mCD8 F - actin c j mCD8 MyoII z z * * * M y o II m oe AB D moeABD MyoII i * * * * * * 1 2 3 1 2 3 * * * 1 2 3 endo E - cad MyoII z * * 3 * 1 2 * * * A V D P NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15593 - 2 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1921 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15593 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 3 Optogenetics reveals Cdc42 spatiotemporal - speci ﬁ c control . Genetic modi ﬁ cations often lack spatial and temporal speci ﬁ city . To probe the role of Cdc42 with greater spatiotemporal resolu - tion , we constructed a photoactivatable Cdc42 ( PA - Cdc42 , described in Fig . 4a ) to activate or inhibit Cdc42 activity with blue light . Similar to PA - Rac 36 , 37 , blue light illumination can change the conformation of the LOV2 domain , thereby releasing the active site of Cdc42 . The effectiveness of PA - Cdc42 was con - ﬁ rmed by GST - pulldown experiments in which a mutant , mimicking the illuminated state , strongly enhances the interac - tion between PA - Cdc42 and GST - PAK compared to the effect of a mutant mimicking the dark state ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . We produced transgenic ﬂ ies expressing PA - Cdc42 in the constitutively - active ( CA ) or DN form and a light - insensitive control in which the C450M mutation stabilizes the dark - state conformation of LOV2 ( refs . 36 , 37 ) . For either the PA - Cdc42CA or PA - Cdc42DN form , exposure to blue light was able to sig - ni ﬁ cantly increase or decrease , respectively , the accumulation of PAK1 - RBD - GFP at the basal cortical domain of follicle cells compared to the dark conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 6b , c ) . Furthermore , compared with the C450M light - insensitive control , expression of PA - Cdc42DN in dark condition led to little effect on basal Myo - II and F - actin signals ( Supplementary Fig . 6d , e ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate the effectiveness of PA - Cdc42CA and PA - Cdc42DN in vivo . First , we tested the effect of Cdc42 photo - inhibition on intercellular ﬁ lopodia in follicle cells at late S9 and S10A . The inhibition of Cdc42 activity by light reduced the length of ﬁ lopodia within 10 min ( Fig . 4b , c ) . Subsequently , we checked the effect of Cdc42 photo - inhibition on the basal actomyosin network of follicle cells at late S9 and S10A . Light - induced inhibition of Cdc42 activity gradually decreased the medio - basal distribution of F - actin and Myo - II signals within 20 – 30 min ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Movies 4 and 6 ) . The C450M light - insensitive control caused no signi ﬁ cant effect ( Fig . 4d , e , Supplementary Fig . 7a , b and Supplementary Movies 5 and 7 ) . In addition , the activation of PA - Cdc42DN at the apical domain had no prominent effect on basal stress ﬁ bers ( Supplementary Fig . 7c – e ) . This demonstrates that stress ﬁ bers are under the control of basal Cdc42 activity . Furthermore , we con ﬁ rmed that Cdc42 photoactivation restores stress ﬁ ber formation in Cdc42 - LOF mutant follicle cells . In these mutant cells , basal stress ﬁ bers are severely disrupted and misaligned . However , the activation of PA - Cdc42CA by light signi ﬁ cantly recovered the formation and distribution of stress ﬁ bers within the medio - basal region in a short time period ( Fig . 4f , g ) . Finally , PA - Cdc42CA activation in Cdc42 - LOF mutant clones rescued ﬁ lopodia length , while C450M light - insensitive control caused no signi ﬁ cant effect ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 7f , g ) . Finally , these results further support Cdc42 spatiotemporal control over ﬁ lopodia and stress ﬁ bers . Cdc42 non - cell autonomous role in stress ﬁ ber organization . Since intercellular ﬁ lopodia , which extend in a polarized manner along the DV axis and penetrate the neighboring cell cortex , are under the control of Cdc42 , we tested whether Cdc42 plays a non - cell autonomous role in stress ﬁ ber organization . Three cell categories can be de ﬁ ned in follicular epithelial tissues containing Cdc42DN clones : ( 1 ) clone cells , ( 2 ) cells neighboring clone cells , and ( 3 ) cells not neighboring clone cells . While cells not neigh - boring Cdc42DN clones show the normal stress ﬁ ber distribution parallel to the DV axis , both clones and clone neighbors showed stress ﬁ ber mis - organization ( Fig . 5a , b and Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Cdc42DN clones and clone neighbors also showed the redistribution of the actin bundles ( lateral vs . medial , e . g . , Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 8c , d ) . This led us to ask whether this local non - cell autonomous effect was due to reduced Myo - II contractility ( hypothesis 1 ) or to the loss of intercellular ﬁ lopodia ( hypothesis 2 ) , both being mediated by the inhibition of Cdc42 activity . To test the ﬁ rst hypothesis , we speci ﬁ cally reduced actomyosin contractility by interfering with the Rho1 pathway . The inhibition of Rho1 or ROCK activity in clone cells had no major effect on the neighboring and more distant wild - type cells , thus ruling out the ﬁ rst hypothesis ( Supplementary Fig . 8 and ref . 11 ) . To test the second hypothesis , we took advantage of the PA - Cdc42DN optogenetic construct that allows spatiotemporal speci ﬁ c Cdc42 inhibition . We speci ﬁ cally photoactivated the sub - basal cell – cell contact zone of PA - Cdc42DN clone cells from which the ﬁ lopodia radiate and monitored stress ﬁ ber organiza - tion in a neighboring wild - type cell ( Fig . 5c ) . During photo - activation , ﬁ lopodia of photoactivated Cdc42DN clones retracted and the actomyosin medial network of the neighboring wild - type cell was disrupted ( Fig . 5d – i ) . Photoactivation had no effect on the light - insensitive control PA - Cdc42DN C450M cells ( Supple - mentary Fig . 9 ) . Finally , this shows that Cdc42 plays a non - cell autonomous role in stress ﬁ ber organization that could be mediated by intracellular ﬁ lopodia . Cortical tension anisotropy is under the control of Cdc42 . Basal actomyosin contractility drives tissue elongation 11 . While it is known that basal Myo - II contractility is necessary to reduce basal cell area in a polarized manner along the DV axis 11 , cell basal tension anisotropy has never been tested directly .

When ablating the cell medial network along a line that is parallel to the AP direction , a maximum recoil speed of 0 . 22 µm s − 1 was measured on average along the DV axis ( Fig . 6a , e and Supple - mentary Movie 8 ) . When ablating along a line that is parallel to the DV direction , a maximum recoil speed of 0 . 01 µm s − 1 was mea - sured on average along the AP axis ( Fig . 6b , e and Supplementary Movie 9 ) . This result directly shows that tension in the medial network of follicle cells at S9 of Drosophila egg chamber devel - opment is 20 times higher along the DV axis compared to the AP axis . We next tested the role of Cdc42 in cell tension and the establishment of tension anisotropy . When performing laser dissection in Cdc42DN clones , the basal - medial network showed little recoil along both the DV and the AP axis and tension anisotropy of a factor 2 ( Fig . 6c – e and Supplementary Movie 10 ) . This shows that Cdc42 plays a key role in DV tension and DV / AP tension anisotropy establishment at the cellular scale . We then tested DV tension in wild - type cells that neighbored or were distantly located from Cdc42DN clones respectively . When ablating along a line parallel to the AP direction , little or no recoil was measured for wild - type neighboring cells while a normal maximum recoil speed was maintained in wild type far located Dia WASP Ena C on t r o l C d c 42 DN Dia WASPEna g n = 24 n = 24 n = 18 n = 26 n = 12 n = 18 E na RN A i W ASP RN A i D i a RN A i E na RN A i ( n = 20 ) W ASP RN A i ( n = 29 ) D i a RN A i ( n = 33 ) C on t r o l ( n = 23 ) 0 1 2 p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 F - a c t i n Cdc42DN ; UASEna Cdc42DN Control UASEna 0 1 2 3 C d c 42 DN ; U ASE na n = 27 C d c 42 DN n = 24 C on t r o l n = 28 U ASE na n = 25 N .

This shows that Cdc42 also plays a non - cell autonomous role in cell tension anisotropy . Finally tension was restored by overexpressing Ena in Cdc42DN follicle cells ( Sup - plementary Fig . 10 ) . Cdc42 controls supracellular tension and tissue elongation . We have demonstrated that at S9 - S10 follicle stress ﬁ bers generate DV - polarized contractile forces at the cellular scale ( Fig . 6 ) while ﬁ ber actin structures , resulting from the stress ﬁ bers and ﬁ lopodia intermingling , emerge at the supracellular scale ( Fig . 1 ) . We therefore wondered if polarized supracellular forces are acting on the follicular epithelium . To test this , we used IR laser ablation and dissected the basal actomyosin network over a 100 µm line ( about ten cells ) . If forces are only acting at the cellular scale , multiple local recoils of the actomysin network would occur ( a recoil for each ablated cell network ) . If supracellular forces emerge from the interaction of local contractile units , a global recoil at higher speed would be expected . Upon ablation along a line parallel to the AP direction , the basal network recoiled along the DV axis with a maximum speed of 0 , 76 µm s − 1 on average . The recoil resulted in one single large opening in the basal net - work ( Fig . 7a , d and Supplementary Movie 11 ) . This demon - strates that a supracellular force is acting at the level of the follicular epithelium and that this is > 3 times greater than the contractile force acting at the cellular scale . Ablation along the DV axis resulted in a much slower recoil ( 0 , 07 µm s − 1 maximum speed on average ) compared to AP ( Fig . 7b , d and Supplementary Movie 12 ) , showing that tension anisotropy is also established at the tissue scale . IR fs laser ablation has been demonstrated to be capable of high - resolved dissection of the actomyosin network with little or no perturbation of the cell membrane 38 , 40 . Our experiments corroborate this notion : membranes are preserved since they ( i ) are visible after ablation and ( ii ) stretch under the action of tissue scale unbalanced forces ( Fig . 7a and Supple - mentary Movie 11 ) . These observations suggest that cell unities are preserved after IR fs tissue scale dissection . Tissue scale IR fs ablation results in the dissection of the basal network , including both the medial - basal actomyosin stress ﬁ bers and the basal junctional F - actin network that is not enriched with Myo - II ( Fig . 1j ) . In order to speci ﬁ cally probe the medial - basal actomyosin stress ﬁ bers network ( which is the focus of our study ) , we performed a tissue scale segmented ablation to dissect the actomyosin stress ﬁ bers while avoiding the sub - basal cell – cell contact zones ( probed already in a previous study 41 ) . The tissue scale segmented ablation still resulted in one single large opening ( see Supplementary Movie 13 ) . In addition , network recoil maximum speed after segmented dissection was > 3 - fold greater than after single cell network dissection ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . These evidences show that egg - chamber surface mechanics , during stage 10 , is dominated by polarized supracellular tension generated by the medial - basal actomyosin stress ﬁ ber network . We further tested tissue scale forces in follicular epithelia containing large Cdc42DN clones . Under these conditions , tension was drastically reduced along the DV axis as observed in subcellular dissection experiments ( Fig . 7c , d ) . Therefore , we assessed the effect of Cdc42 inhibition on tissue shape . Egg chambers containing clones of Cdc42 mutant cells were signi ﬁ cantly more round - shaped than wild type ( Fig . 7e , f ) . This round egg chamber shape was mainly due to the Cdc42 - LOF in follicle cells , since the expression of Cdc42DN speci ﬁ cally in follicle cells resulted in an equally strong phenotype ( Fig . 7e , f ) despite no apical - basal polarity loss nor any egg chamber rotation defects ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . These results show that DV - polarized supracellular tension and AP - directed global tissue elongation are under the control of Cdc42 . To further investigate the role of ﬁ lopodia in establishing a functional supracellular contractile network , we probed ﬁ lopodia mechanosensitivity and mechanical function . Firstly we per - formed IR nano - dissection of stress ﬁ bers juxtaposed to ﬁ lopodia : this induced stress ﬁ ber tension release and ﬁ lopodia retraction ( Fig . 7g white arrowhead , h ) . Remarkably , ﬁ lopodia juxtaposed to preserved stress ﬁ bers did not retract ( Fig . 7g yellow arrowhead , h ) . This data shows that ﬁ lopodia in follicle cells are tension sensitive . We next aimed to test whether ﬁ lopodia are mechanically coupled to neighboring cell cortexes . To test this , we performed a supracellular laser dissection parallel to the AP direction intersecting a ﬁ lopodium ( Fig . 7i ﬁ rst panel ) . The hypothesis supposing a strong mechanical coupling between the ﬁ lopodium and the neighboring cell cortex can be ruled out if , during recoil , the ﬁ lopodium tip were to move following the displacement of the cell from which it radiates . Remarkably , after dissection , the ﬁ lopodium tip moved away from the cell that it belonged to : this resulted in ﬁ lopodium stretching ( Fig . 7i and Supplementary Movie 14 ) . After persisting in a stretch con ﬁ g - uration for several minutes , the stretched ﬁ lopodium partially retracted as the tip ﬁ nally moved back in a way that was similar to a spring that , under load , has been stretched out and then suddenly released from one extremity ( Fig . 7i last panel and Supplementary Movie 14 ) . This directly demonstrates that ﬁ lopodia can be coupled to neighboring cells , thus functioning as mechanical anchors and establishing the bridging links between cell cortexes .

Previous studies have shown that subcellular acto - myosin oscillations play a key role in egg chamber elongation . Here , we extend this by directly probing subcellular mechanics and by showing how cellular forces are integrated at the tissue scale to drive tissue extension . A supracellular and DV - polarized F - actin network emerges from interdigitating ﬁ lopodia that penetrate actomyosin stress ﬁ bers of neighboring cells . Filopodia are formed by F - actin bundles which radiate from the medial - basal network . Both ﬁ lopodia and actomyosin stress ﬁ bers are under the control of Cdc42 . The cellular actomyosin stress ﬁ bers generate DV - polarized forces . Cellular forces are integrated at the tissue level to generate tissue scale tension anisotropy . Finally , tissue scale forces and epithelia extension are mediated by the supracellular and polarized F - actin network controlled by Cdc42 . In contrast to other epithelial cells , in which Myo - II is enriched at junctions generating forces that are directly transmitted from cell to cell 38 , 42 , in follicle cells Myo - II is not enriched at basal junctions and concentrates instead in the medial region . How can then forces be transmitted from one cell to the other at the basal domain in the follicular epithelium ? Here , we show that ﬁ lopodia , hv Effector Effector LOV J α Cdc42 L O V J Cdc42 α 0 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 0 min 10 min 20 min 29 min 0 min 10 min 20 min 30 min MARCM cdc42 [ 4 ] MARCM cdc42 [ 4 ] 0 min 10 min 20 min 25 min 10 20 30 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 0 1 2 10 20 30 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 10 20 30 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 10 20 30 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 PA - Cdc42DN PA - Cdc42DN C450M PA - Cdc42DN PA - Cdc42DN C450M PA - Cdc42DN ( n = 10 ) C450M ( n = 11 ) PA - Cdc42DN ( n = 10 ) C450M ( n = 7 ) PA - Cdc42CA ( n = 6 ) PA - Cdc42CA ( n = 7 ) PA - Cdc42CA PA - Cdc42CA p < 0 . 01 p < 0 . 001 Before PA After PA p < 0 . 001 N .

Filopodia could thus function as cell – cell coupling units . While previous work has shown that actomyosin stress ﬁ ber organization is not affected in integrin downregulated follicular epithelia 34 , further work is necessary to rule out the possibility that the extracellular matrix may also function as a scaffold integrating stress ﬁ ber contractions during S9 . Our work demonstrates that Cdc42 has a non - cell autonomous role in stress ﬁ ber organization . By inhibiting Cdc42 , speci ﬁ cally at the sub - basal cell – cell contact zone of PA - Cdc42DN clones , we show that ﬁ lopodia retract and that stress ﬁ bers of neighboring wild - type cells are mis - organized within a time period of tens of minutes . This suggests that ﬁ lopodia could function also as guiding cues to organize stress ﬁ bers . A recent study shows that engulfed cadherin “ ﬁ ngers ” are asymmetrically distributed between endothelial cells to maintain actomyosin network polarity during collective cell migration 43 . These ﬁ ndings delineate a functioning mode in which thin protrusions might commonly serve to coordinate the collective behaviors of cell sheets . During the early stages of Drosophila oogenesis , global egg chamber rotation polarizes ( 1 ) the extracellular matrix , ( 2 ) the intracellular basal F - actin network , and ( 3 ) the ﬁ lopodia ( the latter in a unidirectional manner ) 9 , 10 , 44 , 45 . When rotation is arrested at early S9 , ﬁ lopodia maintain a DV polarity but become bidirectional penetrating the cortexes of dorsally and ventrally positioned neighboring cells . As egg chamber development proceeds , stress ﬁ bers become densely packed and more aligned while ﬁ lopodia retract beginning at S10B . While during S9 and S10A , bidirectional ﬁ lopodia might provide a physical cue to guide stress ﬁ bers and to stabilize their DV polarity , ﬁ lopodia might become dispensable in later stages after stress ﬁ ber maturation . Filopodia bidirectional polarity might be under the control of the prepolarized extracellular matrix . Further work is necessary to better understand the origin of bidirectionally polarized ﬁ lopodia . Finally , we show that actomyosin stress ﬁ ber dynamics and organization are separately controlled . While Rho1 - ROCK signaling controls basal Myo - II oscillations ( as also shown in previous work 11 , 34 , 46 ) , Cdc42 controls stress ﬁ ber distribution . While both levels of control are necessary for tissue extension , future work is needed to better understand the role and mechanics of Myo - II periodic oscillations acting at the cell scale and of Myo - II phase waves propagating along the egg chamber .

Moreover , UAS - PA - Cdc42DN and UAS - PA - Cdc42DN with LOV C450M mutant version transgenic ﬂ ies were generated by Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa ( CSIC / UAM ) using the w1118 ﬂ y . Dissection and mounting of the Drosophila egg chamber . One - to three - day - old females were fattened on yeast with males for 1 – 2 days before dissection . Droso - phila egg chambers were dissected and mounted in live - imaging medium ( Invi - trogen Schneider ’ s insect medium with 20 % FBS and with a ﬁ nal PH adjusted to 6 . 9 ) , using a similar version of the protocol described in ref . 50 . In contrast to the normal mounting conditions , egg chambers were slightly compressed to overcome the endogenous curvature . Under this condition , basal oscillation pattern , intensity and period were similar to those observed under conditions without compression . GST pulldown . The assay of Cdc42 activity in cell lysates was performed as described in ref . 51 . Brie ﬂ y , the p21 - binding domain ( PBD ) domain from PAK1 was subcloned into pGEX - 4T1 vector and expressed as an N - terminal GST fusion protein in BL21 ( DE3 ) competent E . coli ( New England BioLabs ) . GST - PDB was puri ﬁ ed from bacterial lysates using glutathione magnetic beads ( Thermo - Scienti ﬁ c ) . The PA - Cdc42 lit state mutant ( I531E / I539E ) or dark - state mutant ( C450A , L514K , G528A , L531E , N538E ) were expressed in HEK293 cells via transient transfection with Fugene6 ( Promega ) . HEK293 cell line was from Genetica , MA , USA , and it was not authenticated . This cell line has been regularly tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination . Lysates from HEK293 cells were incubated with ~ 10 μ g of GST - PDB beads and incubated at 4°C for 1h . Following incubation , beads were washed , boiled with sample buffer , and analyzed via western blot . Imaging and photomanipulation . Time - lapse imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM710 or Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a 40× , numerical aperture 1 . 3 inverted oil lens , with a 488 nm argon laser and a 561 nm green laser in LSM710 or a 552 nm laser in SP8 . The basal focal plane , which is about 1 μ m beneath the basal surface inside the cell , was selected during live imaging to maximize the basal Myo - II intensity . For the dynamics of UtrABD – GFP , the similar basal focal plane was selected to maximize the basal F - actin intensity , as for basal Myo - II dynamic imaging . The same microscope setup was used when comparing intensity between different samples . For the dynamics of follicle cell rotational movement , the focal plane , which is centered at follicle cell nuclei , was selected to maximize the nuclear dsRed to better view the localization of individual follicle cells . Imaging data have been collected by Zeiss Zen software ( version : Zen 2007 light edition ) or Leica Metamorph software ( version : Metamorph 7 . 8 . 13 . 0 ) or Leica SP8 LAS software ( version : LAS X ) . For photoactivation experiment , live - cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope with a 40× , numerical aperture 1 . 3 inverted oil lens , with a 488 nm argon laser and a 561 nm green laser . To photoactivate , the 458 nm laser was set at 6 – 8 % power for 0 . 1 ms per pixel in a 5 – 15 μ m circle or rectangle and the photoactivation scan took ~ 15 – 20s . After 30 s , follicle cells were imaged using 488 or 568 nm . This series of steps was repeated for the duration of the time - lapse experiment . Drug treatments . Egg chambers were dissected in live - imaging medium , and then incubated with Cdc42 inhibitor ML141 52 ( Sigma ) at 400 μ M , Rac inhibitor NSC23766 53 ( Sigma ) at 400 μ M , Rho1 inhibitor Rhosin 54 ( Merk ) at 400 μ M for 20 min before being mounted for imaging . Information of chemical inhibitors is listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Image processing and data analysis . Images were processed with MATLAB ( version : R2018a ) and Image J ( version : 1 . 51j8 ) . For all images the background ( intensity of area without sample ) was subtracted . Image J was used to calculate the intensity of an individual cell as the average value of all pixels within the cell area . In the time - lapse experiments , images were processed by MATLAB to correct photo - bleaching automatically . To determine the signal ratio between the medio - basal region and the outside region close to basal junction , each follicle cell was separated into these two regions ( one is medio - basal cortex , which is around 1 / 2 at center region , while the other is around 1 / 4 regions near both anterior and posterior junctional membrane ) , and then the signals in either region were analyzed using ImageJ . For the quanti ﬁ cation of egg chamber rotation , the rotation speed of follicle cells was measured from the time - lapse images of S6 - S7 egg chambers expressing nuclear dsRed driven by FLP - OUT system . The time - lapse positions of individual follicle cell nuclear centers were automatically tracked by MATLAB and the migration speed was automatically calculated also by MATLAB . Migration speed ( each dot in Supplementary Fig . 12c ) was obtained from the average of each follicle cell nuclear movement in the same egg chamber . The distribution of oscillation periods was generated by measuring the intervals between each pair of adjacent peaks . We applied autocorrelation to calculate the period of a time series with different time offsets . This method averages out irregularities in the sequence and gives a similar average period . To quantify the percentage distribution of the oscillating time period , the 25 to 30 minute - dynamic intensity of the n individual cells ( n is indicated in Fig . 2i ) from four independent LS9 egg chambers was tracked , then the oscillating cycle time of each individual cell was calculated by the autocorrelation method . Tissue elongation was measured by the A - P to D - V length ratio of S10 and S14 egg chambers . For the quanti ﬁ cation of the planar cell polarity of stress ﬁ bers in follicle cells , we calculated the order parameter , S , for the mutant clone , neighboring WT and far WT follicle cells ( three categories of follicle cells ) in egg chambers , by a similar version of the protocol described in ref . 9 . We de ﬁ ned S as : S = 2 ( < cos 2 ( θ ij ) > – 1 / 2 ) , where θ ij is the angle between the directors of cells i and j . The average was performed over all unique cell pair combinations in each category of follicle cells . Box and whiskers plots ( GraphPad Prism software ) were used to represent the ﬁ lopodia length and distribution as well as stress ﬁ ber orientation , and also the data with sample number > 10 : boxes extend from the 25th to 75th percentiles , the mid line represents the median and the whiskers indicate the maximum and the minimum values . GraphPad Prism software ( version : 8 . 0 . 1 ) has been used for box and whiskers plots . For ﬁ lopodia length analysis , the average ﬁ lopodia length per cell was quanti ﬁ ed . For each analyzed individual cell , all ﬁ lopodia not < 0 . 5 µm were measured . Ablation experiments . Ablations of basal actomyosin stress ﬁ bers were performed using a 780 NLO ( Zeiss ) inverted confocal microscope , equipped with the Spectra - Physics Mai Tai DeepSee IR fs laser ( Newport Corp . , Irvine , CA , UAS ) , using 40× / N . A . 1 . 2 water - immersion objective ( ZeissC - Apo 421767 - 9970 ) . Ablations were obtained by exposing the ﬁ bers to the focused beam with an average power of 200 mW ( at 950 nm with 90 % transmission ) measured on the focal plane of the objective using a thermic slide - photoreceptor . IR fs laser dissections were per - formed using FRAP function of ZEN software . The region of interest ( ROI ) was always set to a horizontal line ( the egg chamber was thus digitally rotated accordingly for AP or DV ablations ) . The frame rate is constant regardless of the length of the ROI . Images were acquired in mono - photon mode , using an Argon laser ( 488nm ) and DPSS 561 nm .
