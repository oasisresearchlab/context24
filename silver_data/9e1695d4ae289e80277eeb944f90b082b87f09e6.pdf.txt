Gel Lattice Spring Model We consider a layer of swollen polymer gel located in the XY plane . The layer thickness is given by the fixed value of 0 H   , where 0 H is the thickness of the undeformed gel , and   is the degree of swelling in the transverse direction . In the undeformed state , the gel geometry is captured by triangulation in the XY plane . Each undeformed element is characterized by the same values of the volume fraction of polymer 0  and the cross - link density 0 c . The undeformed elements belonging to the BZ patches are also characterized by the concentration of the ruthenium catalyst Ru c , which is assumed to be constant within a patch but can vary from patch to patch . The nodes of the triangular mesh are labeled ( global labeling ) by the integer number N , tot N N   1 , where tot N is the total number of nodes , and N X is the spatial position of node N in the undeformed state . Upon deformation , ) , ( t X x X  ; that is , a point with the initial ( undeformed ) coordinates X moves to a new position ) , ( t X x during the period of time t . The mesh nodes move together with the gel ( i . e . , they are “frozen” into the to gel ) , so that ) ( t N N x X  , where N x is the actual position of node N at the moment of time t . In addition to the spatial position , each node is characterized by the time - dependent local values of the concentrations of the BZ reagents u and v , and the time - dependent volume fraction of polymer Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 2  . To derive the equations of motion for the nodal coordinates and concentrations , we use a finite element approximation , as described below . The time - dependent nodal values of  are determined through 0  and the nodal coordinates ( see below ) . In a mesh , each node is the vertex of a cell , which consists of the triangular elements adjoining the node . A cell is labeled by the same integer number as it’s vertex node , i . e . , node N is the vertex of cell N . We describe each cell by the piecewise linear function ) ( x N  , which equals 1 at N x and zero at the neighboring nodes ( see Fig . S1a ) . In the context of finite element methods , the function ) ( x N  is known as the global shape function [ 1 ] or the hat - function . The hat - function satisfies a number of properties , such as NM M N    ) ( x , 1 ) (    N N x , x x x    N N N ) ( . ( S1 ) The above properties make the hat - function useful for a linear interpolation of the data . Namely , if some variable , g , is defined at the nodal points , N g , then the linear interpolation of the data over the entire region is provided by    N N N g g ) ( ) ( ~ x x ( S2 ) The tilde symbol denotes that g ~ is an approximation to g . It has been demonstrated that the hat - function can also be used for coarse - graining , i . e . , by formulating an approximate , contracted description of a system via a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom that are taken into account [ 2 , 3 ] . For example , a value ) (   , which depends on the coordinates of many particles  , can be coarse - grained through the introduction of the density N  , which is localized to node N by integration with the hat - function N  . Namely ,      d V N N N   1 , where N V is the weight factor of cell N defined as    x d V N N ( S3 ) As a result , the system is described in terms of a relatively small number of variables N  defined at the mesh nodes [ 2 , 3 ] . In this paper , we adopt the above procedure to perform the spatial discretization of the partial differential equations that describe the heterogeneous BZ gels . The nodal values are defined as Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 3     x x x d g V g N N N ) ( ) ( 1 ( S4 ) where ) ( x g denotes some model variable , e . g . , the velocity of the polymer and the concentrations of the BZ reactants . Then , the evolution of N g in time is determined by applying the model equations , e . g . , eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) , to eq . ( S4 ) . Finally , the linear interpolation given in eq . ( S2 ) is used to find the approximate solution ) ( ~ x g in the entire domain . In what follows , we omit the tilde symbol , which denotes approximation , if it does not lead to an ambiguity . We take into account that the hat - function N  depends on both x and t as the triangular mesh moves together with the BZ gel . In order to be a piecewise linear function of x at any moment of time t , the function N  must obey the following equation : 0 ) (       N p N t v ( S5 ) where p v is the velocity of the polymer . The above kinematic equation is equivalent to the assumption that within any triangular element , the deformation of gel ) , ( t X x X  is described by linear functions of the nodal coordinates . In the latter case , the point X in the undeformed element and the point ) ( X x in the deformed element are characterized by the same local triangular coordinates [ 1 ] , so that ) 0 , ( ) , ( X x N N t    and 0   dt d N . It is worth noting that eq . ( S5 ) allows us to use eq . ( S2 ) for the interpolation of the velocity of the polymer dt t d p / ) , ( X x v  , i . e . ,    N N N p t t t ) , ( ) ( ) , ( x v x v ( S6 ) where N v is the velocity of node N . Below , the time dependence of N v and all other nodal values is assumed , but not shown explicitly for simplicity . Differentiation of eq . ( S4 ) with respect to the time t yields the following equation for the nodal value N g            x v d g g V dt dV V g dt dg p t N N N N N N ) ] ( [ / / 1 1 . ( S7 ) To obtain the above equation , we utilized eq . ( S5 ) and took into account that by definition , 0 ) (   x N inside cell N , and 0 ) (   x N at the cell boundary and outside it . Equation ( S7 ) is used for the discretization of the reaction diffusion equations : eqs ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) , ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) . Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 4 We begin by formulating the discretized reaction - diffusion equations for the BZ gel , eqs . ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) . First , we apply eq . ( S7 ) to determine the time evolution of the nodal value of the volume fraction of polymer N  . Substitution of eq . ( 3 ) into the right - hand side ( r . h . s . ) of eq . ( S7 ) gives 0 / ) (  dt V d N N  ( S8 ) It can be shown ( see Section B below ) that the weight factor N V , which is defined by eq . ( S3 ) , is linearly proportional to the area of the cell , N A ; namely , 3 / N N A V  . Therefore , eq . ( S8 ) means simply that the amount of polymer within each cell does not change in time . Hence , eq . ( S8 ) can be re - written as N N N A A      ) 0 ( 0 ( S9 ) where ) 0 ( N A is the area of cell N in the undeformed state . Note that eq . ( S9 ) defines N  as an algebraic function of the coordinates of the cell nodes in the undeformed and current states . Next , by substituting eq . ( 2 ) into the r . h . s . of eq . ( S7 ) , we obtain the following equation for the time - dependent nodal value of the oxidized catalyst N v :        x d G V dt dV V v dt dv N N N N N N  1 1 / / . ( S10 ) It is convenient to introduce the partial value N N N v  /  v , which is the mole fraction of the oxidized catalyst in the polymer network . In effect , the spatial distribution of the oxidized catalyst is sought to be in the form    N N N N v ) ( ) ( x x  v , where N  is given by eq . ( S9 ) . The nodal value N v obeys the following equation , which was obtained by using eqs . ( S8 ) and ( S9 ) :     x d G A dt d N N N    ) 0 ( 0 3 / v . ( S11 ) It is worth noting that the nodal value N v varies in time due to the BZ reaction only . The reaction rate is represented as a function of the nodal values of the BZ reagents . For the latter purpose , the concentration fields within the triangular elements , which form the cell , are calculated using the linear interpolation between the corresponding nodal values , and then the integration is performed on the r . h . s . of eq . ( S11 ) ( see Section B below ) . Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 5 The equation for the nodal value N u , the concentration of the activator , is obtained by applying eq . ( S7 ) to eq . ( 1 ) . The equation for N u is further simplified by reformulating it in terms of the partial value N N N u 1 ) 1 (     u , which is the concentration of the activator in solution , and hence ,     N N N N u ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( x x  u . The equation for N u can be written as             x x J d F V d V dt dV V dt d N N N N N N N N N 1 1 1 ) ( / / ) 1 ( u u u  . ( S12 ) Here , u J is the flux of the activator u u u      ) 1 (  p v J , ( S13 ) where u 1 ) 1 (     u . The factor dt dV V N N / 1  in the first term on the r . h . s of eq . ( S12 ) is an algebraic function of the nodal coordinates N x and velocities N v that can be determined through a purely geometrical consideration . To perform the integration in the second term on the r . h . s . of eq . ( S12 ) , the linear interpolation is used to represent the velocity of the polymer p v and the concentration u as linear functions of the respective nodal values ( see Section B below ) . Specifically , eq . ( S6 ) is utilized to calculate ) ( x v p , and the concentration of the activator in solution is calculated as    N N N ) ( ) ( x x u u . Finally , the reaction rate contribution , which is given by the third term on the r . h . s . of eq ( S12 ) , is determined through the same approach as described above for eq . ( S11 ) . Equations ( S11 ) and ( S12 ) describe the BZ reaction in a catalyst - containing region of the gel . The latter equations must be accompanied by the description of the gel dynamics . The dynamical behavior of the gel is captured by the equations of motion for the nodal points N N dt d v x  / , ( S14 ) where the nodal velocity is determined according to eqs . ( 10 ) and ( S4 ) , i . e . ,        x σ v d M V N N N ) ˆ ( ) ( 1 0 1    ( S15 ) In the above equation , M is the gel mobility defined as 2 / 1 0 0 ) / ) ( 1 ( ) (        M ( S16 ) The integration on the r . h . s . of eq . ( S15 ) is carried out separately over the elements forming the cell . The elements of cell N are labeled by the integer number N e , N N E e   1 , Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 6 where 1  N E is the total number of elements adjoining node N ( see Fig . S1b ) . Within each element , the nodes are labeled by 3 , 2 , 1  n ( local labeling ) in the counter clockwise direction ( see Fig . S1c ) starting from the cell vertex . For element N e , we also introduce the edge vectors ) ( N n e d , 3 , 2 , 1  n , as shown in Fig . S2 , so that the edge n is located opposite to the node n , and 0 ) (   n N n e d . The area of element N e is denoted as ) ( N e A , and the cell area is   N e N N e A A ) ( . The volume fraction of polymer is spatially uniform within each element , and determined by an equation similar to eq . ( S9 ) , i . e . , 1 0 0 ) (    A A    , where 0 A is the element area in the undeformed state , and the element label is omitted for brevity . It can be shown ( see Section B below ) that after the integration , the r . h . s . of eq . ( S15 ) can be expressed as a sum of the elemental contributions , namely ,    N e N N N N N e e e A A ) ( ) M ( ) ( 1 F v . ( S17 ) where ) M ( N e is the mobility , eq . ( S16 ) , calculated at ) ( N e    , and ) ( N e F is the force acting on the node N from within the element N e . We note that the bold faced symbol F , which denotes the force ( i . e . , a vector ) , should not be mistaken with the italicized symbol F denoting the BZ rate function ( i . e . , a scalar ) in eq . ( 4 ) . The elemental force F is determined by the following equation ( the element label N e is omitted ) : P ) ( 2 3 ] ) cot ( ) cot ( [ 2 3 1 3 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 d e d d F       A A c    . ( S18 ) The first term on the r . h . s . of the above equation describes the linear spring - like forces between the neighboring nodes . Besides the crosslink density 0 c , the spring constants depend on the size and shape of the undeformed triangular element that enter eq . ( S18 ) through the element area 0 A and the alternate angles 0  and 0  ( see Fig . S2 ) , respectively . The second contribution to the elemental force ) ( N e F , eq . ( S18 ) , is due to the isotropic pressure ) P ( N e , which is the isotropic part of eq . ( 10 ) , 1 0 0 ) 2 ( ) (            c v P FH , calculated at ) ( N e   and ) ( N e v v  . The value of ) ( N e v is defined as the average concentration of the oxidized catalyst in the element N e . Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 7 Thus , eqs . ( S11 ) , ( S12 ) , ( S14 ) , ( S17 ) and ( S18 ) taken together describe the chemo - mechanical behavior of the BZ gel represented by the triangular elements of arbitrary size and shape ( unstructured triangular mesh ) . We note that the formulation presented here is a generalization of the gLSM approach developed previously for the case of equal quadratic elements [ 4 ] , and allows us to model BZ gels of a complex geometry . The gLSM approach developed for the BZ gel can be extended immediately to the case of a heterogeneous gel , which consists of both the reactive and nonreactive regions [ 5 ] . The reaction and diffusion of the activator u in the nonreactive gel is described by eq . ( S12 ) , in which the BZ reaction rate function F is taken in the form 2 ) ( u u F   . The nodal velocity is determined according to eqs . ( S17 ) and ( S18 ) , in which the isotropic pressure is calculated at 0  v . A special treatment is needed to describe the reaction and diffusion of the activator u in the outside solution . In general , the shape of the heterogeneous gel varies in time , so eq . ( 9 ) must be solved under the constraint of moving boundary conditions . To solve the latter problem , we extend the triangular mesh over the entire system , including the outside solution , and fix the nodal positions at the outer boundary of the system . Then , we assume that the mesh external to the gel behaves like a fictitious elastic body , which deforms when the gel boundary moves , but does not impose a force back onto the gel boundary . As a result , eq . ( 9 ) can be solved using an approach similar to that described above . Specifically , we describe the mesh outside the gel as a compressible neo - Hookean solid , characterized by the following stress - strain equation [ 6 ] : I I B σ ˆ ) log ( ) ˆ ˆ ( ˆ 1 1 J J K J c         ( S19 ) Here , J is the local volumetric change , and  c and  K are the model parameters , which are proportional to the shear and bulk moduli , respectively [ 6 , 7 ] . The dynamics of this fictitious solid is described by the relaxational equation       σ v ˆ M , where  v and  M are the velocity and mobility , respectively . The same procedure as outlined above , cf . eqs . ( S14 ) and ( S17 ) , yields the following equations for the moving nodal points :    N N dt d v x / , ( S20 )       N e N N N e A M ) ( 1 F v . ( S21 ) Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 8 Here , the elemental force is [ cf . eq . ( S18 ) ] ) ] log ( ) [ ( 2 3 ] ) cot ( ) cot ( [ 2 3 10 1 3 1 0 3 0 2 0             AA K c A A c d e d d F   , ( S22 ) and all of the notation is the same as in eqs . ( S17 ) and ( S18 ) . The approximate solution of eq . ( 9 ) is provided by the linear interpolation between the nodal values ,    N N N u u ) ( ) ( x x , and the following equation should be solved to obtain the nodal values N u [ cf . eq . ( S12 ) ] :            x x J d u V d V dt dV V u dt du N N N u N N N N N 2 1 1 1 ) ( / / . ( S23 ) In eq . ( S23 ) , the flux of the activator u J is defined as [ cf . eq . ( S13 ) ] u u u      v J , ( S24 ) where      N N N ) ( x v v , and the nodal velocity  N v is calculated according to eq . ( S21 ) . Finally , we note that the continuity of the activator concentration u and its flux at the gel - solution boundary is automatically fulfilled in the approach developed here . This is because the reaction and diffusion of the activator within the swollen gel are described in terms of the variable 1 ) 1 (     u u , which is the concentration of the activator in the solution phase [ see eq . ( S12 ) ] . B . Details of the Finite Element Approximation On the right - hand side ( r . h . s . ) of eqs . ( S11 ) , ( S12 ) and ( S15 ) , the integrals over cell N are calculated by summing the elemental contributions obtained by integration over the triangular elements adjoining node N ( see Figs . S1a and S1b ) . Within an individual element , the linear approximation of function g given by the nodal values n g , 3 , 2 , 1  n , is provided by    3 1 ) ( ) ( n n n l g g x x , ( S25 ) where ) ( x n l are the linear triangular shape functions shown in Fig S3 . Hereafter , we omit the element labels and the global node labels when it does not lead to an ambiguity . Note that the hat - function ) ( x N  is the union of the shape functions ) ( 1 x l defined in the elements constituting cell N ( see Figs . S1a and S1c ) . Hence , the integral   x x x d g N ) ( ) ( is Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Journal of Materials Chemistry This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 9 decomposed to the elemental contributions of the form    3 1 1 ) ( ) ( n n n d l l g x x x . The integration of the products of the functions ) ( x n l , 3 , 2 , 1  n , is known to yield the following result [ 1 ] : ! ) 2 ( ! ! ! 2 ) ( ) ( ) ( 3 2 1      c b a c b a A d l l l c b a x x x x , ( S26 ) where A is the area of the triangle . Thus , the elemental contributions to the r . h . s . of eq . ( S11 ) and to the last term on the r . h . s . of eq . ( S12 ) are calculated as ) 2 ( 12 ) ( ) ( 3 2 1 1 g g g A d g l     x x x , ( S27 ) where the n g correspond to the nodal values of the rate functions G or F . To determine the elemental contribution to the second term on the r . h . s . of eq . ( S12 ) , it should be taken into account that A l n n 2 ) ( 3 d e x    , ( S28 ) where n d , 3 , 2 , 1  n , are the edge vectors defined as shown in Fig . S2 , and that the volume fraction of polymer in the element is constant and equal to A A      0 0 ( S29 ) Here , 0  and 0 A are the volume fraction of polymer and area of an element in the undeformed state , respectively . In eq . ( S13 ) , the concentration of the activator in solution u and velocity of polymer p v are approximated using eq . ( S25 ) through the respective nodal values n u and n v , 3 , 2 , 1  n . Application of eqs . ( S26 ) , ( S28 ) , and ( S29 ) results in the following equation for the elemental contribution to the second term on the r . h . s . of eq .

( 11 ) and ( 12 ) . The second term in the parentheses on the r . h . s . of the above equation is equivalent to the second term on the r . h . s . of eq . ( S18 ) owing to eqs . ( S28 ) and ( S29 ) . It is important to note that the Finger strain tensor B ˆ is constant within each element ( but is different in different elements , of course ) because the deformation of gel ) ( X x X  is described by linear functions of the nodal coordinates . Specifically , as noted above in the Section A [ see the discussion after eq .

The Finger strain tensor is defined as T ˆ ˆ ˆ F F B   , where ) ( ˆ 0 X x F   is the deformation - gradient tensor [ 6 , 7 ] ; the subscript “0” denotes differentiation with respect to coordinates in the undeformed state , i . e . , X . The tensor F ˆ can be readily calculated by applying the operator 0  to eq . ( S33 ) and taking into account eq . ( S28 ) re - written in the form ) ( ) 2 ( ) ( 3 1 0 0 n n A L D e X     . Here , n D , 3 , 2 , 1  n , are the edge vectors in the undeformed state ( see Fig . S2 ) .
