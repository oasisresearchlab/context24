A formin inhibitor would be useful because most cells express multiple formins whose functions are not known and because metastatic tumor formation depends on the deregulation of formin - dependent processes . We identiﬁed a general small molecule inhibitor of formin homology 2 domains ( SMIFH2 ) by screening com - pounds for the ability to prevent formin - mediated actin assembly in vitro . SMIFH2 targets formins from evolutionarily diverse organisms including yeast , nematode worm , and mice , with a half - maximal inhibitor concentration of (cid:2) 5 to 15 m M . SMIFH2 pre - vents both formin nucleation and processive barbed end elongation and decreases formin’s afﬁnity for the barbed end . Furthermore , low micromolar concen - trations of SMIFH2 disrupt formin - dependent , but not Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent , actin cytoskeletal structures in ﬁssion yeast and mammalian NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts . INTRODUCTION Cells assemble diverse actin - dependent structures for a variety of fundamental processes , each of which is thought to be reliant on speciﬁc actin nucleation factors such as the Arp2 / 3 complex , Spire , and formin ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ) . Determining which factors drive actin ﬁlament assembly for particular cellular func - tions is daunting . Formins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that stimulate actin assembly for a variety of processes including division , motility , establishing polarity , stress ﬁber formation , focal adhesions , and cell - to - cell adhesions ( Faix and Grosse , 2006 ; Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Higgs , 2005 ) , which are often deregulated during tumor cell transformation and metastasis ( Sahai , 2005 ) . Not surprising then , formins are involved in malig - nant tumor function and are highly overexpressed in different cancer cell types including colorectal , carcinoma , leukemia , melanoma , and lymphoid ( Favaro et al . , 2003 ; Kitzing et al . , 2007 ; Sarmiento et al . , 2008 ; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . Determining for - min’s numerous roles is particularly complicated because most organisms express multiple isoforms ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ) . For example , there are at least 20 formin genes in plants , 18 in mammals , 6 each in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabdi - tis elegans , 3 in ﬁssion yeast , and 2 in budding yeast ( Higgs , 2005 ) . A major challenge is to elucidate all formin - dependent cellular functions in both healthy and diseased tissues . Formins are multidomain proteins that contain a highly conserved actin assembly formin homology 2 FH2 domain and its associated proﬁlin - binding FH1 domain , which are ﬂanked on either side by regulatory domains that coordinate localization and activation ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Higgs , 2005 ) . Some for - mins are autoinhibited by association of their N - and C - terminal regulatory domains and activated by GTP - bound small Rho - GTPases ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Wallar and Alberts , 2003 ) . Upon activation , the FH2 domain either nucleates actin ﬁlament assembly or associates with preexisting ﬁlaments and remains continuously associated with the elongating actin ﬁlament barbed end ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . Processive association allows formins to protect barbed ends from capping proteins ( Harris et al . , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2005 ; Moseley et al . , 2004 ; Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) and to stimulate the addition of FH1 domain - bound proﬁlin - actin ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Neidt et al . , 2008 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . As a result , formins produce long - straight ﬁlaments that are often bundled in cells and pulled by myosin motors to produce con - tractile forces , such as the cytokinetic contractile ring and stress ﬁbers ( Glotzer , 2005 ; Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) . Given that the roles of most formins in different cell types are not known , and the potential for formin as an anti - cancer target , inhibitors of formin - mediated actin assembly would be extremely useful . We report here a simple ﬂuorescence - based in vitro screen and identiﬁcation of the ﬁrst general small molecule inhib - itor of formin - mediated actin assembly that disrupts formin - dependent processes from yeast to mammals . 1158 Chemistry & Biology 16 , 1158 – 1168 , November 25 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Identiﬁcation of a Small Molecule that Inhibits Formin - Mediated Actin Assembly We screened (cid:2) 10 , 000 commercially available small molecules ( ChemBridge ) for the ability to prevent mouse formins mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) and mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) from stimulating actin assembly in vitro ( see Experimental Procedures ) . We identiﬁed a compound that we named SMIFH2 for small molecule inhibitor of formin FH2 domain - mediated actin assembly ( see Figure 1A ) . This 2 - thiooxodihydropyrimidine - 4 , 6 - dione derivative inhibits mouse formin mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) - mediated assembly of proﬁlin - actin in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Half - maximal inhibition occurs at (cid:2) 15 . 0 m M SMIFH2 , and at saturating concentrations of SMIFH2 the rate of assembly is identical to the rate without formin . Control experiments demonstrate that SMIFH2 is speciﬁc for formin - mediated actin assembly . High concentrations of SMIFH2 did not eliminate the spontaneous assembly of actin monomers without formin ( Figure 2C ) , the addition of actin to the barbed end of preassem - bled ﬁlaments without formin ( Figures 2G and 2I ; see Figures S1C and S1E available online ) , or actin polymerization stimulated with Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 2E and2F ) . With similar potency SMIFH2 also inhibits mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) without proﬁlin , as well as the construct mDia1 ( FH2 ) lacking the proﬁlin binding FH1 domain ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , the molecular target of SMIFH2 is likely the highly conserved FH2 domain . SMIFH2 also inhibits actin assembly by evolutionarily diverse formin FH1FH2 constructs including C . elegans CYK - 1 , S . pombe Cdc12 , S . pombe Fus1 , S . cerevisiae Bni1 , and M . musculus mDia2 ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Therefore , SMIFH2 is a general inhibitor of actin assembly mediated by formin FH2 domains . SMIFH2 Inhibits Both Formin - Mediated Nucleation and Elongation Formins nucleate actin assembly and drive rapid elongation of proﬁlin - actin by remaining continually associated with the elon - gating barbed end ( Kovar , 2006 ) . We determined that SMIFH2 inhibits formin - mediated nucleation by visualizing the products of spontaneous assembly reactions upon reaching plateau ( Figure 2D ) . Filament length is proportional to the number of ﬁla - ments . Control reactions without formin produce long ﬁla - ments ( (cid:2) 21 m m ) compared to reactions with formins ( (cid:2) 1 . 5 and (cid:2) 0 . 5 m m for mouse mDia2 and ﬁssion yeast Cdc12 , respec - tively ) . SMIFH2 inhibits formin nucleation , resulting in ﬁlament lengths similar to controls without formin ( (cid:2) 18 and (cid:2) 21 m m for mDia2 and Cdc12 , respectively ) . We determined that SMIFH2 inhibits formin - mediated elonga - tion by measuring the addition of proﬁlin - actin to preassembled formin - associated ﬁlaments ( Figures 2G – 2J ) . In the absence of SMIFH2 , formin - associated ﬁlaments rapidly assemble upon addition of proﬁlin - actin . Conversely , SMIFH2 severely blocked the elongation of both Cdc12 - and mDia2 - associated ﬁlaments . Half - maximal inhibition occurs at (cid:2) 4 . 0 m M SMIFH2 ( Figure 2J ) . SMIFH2 did not inhibit the barbed end elongation of ﬁlaments without formin ( Figures 2G and 2I ) . SMIFH2 Decreases the Afﬁnity of Formin for the Actin Filament Barbed End We determined that SMIFH2 decreases the afﬁnity of formin for the barbed end by three assays .

In the absence of SMIFH2 , formin signiﬁcantly inhibits the depolymerization of preassem - bled ﬁlaments upon dilution below the barbed end critical concentration . Concentrations of SMIFH2 above 25 to 50 m M allow rapid barbed end depolymerization in the presence of both Cdc12 and mDia2 . Conversely , SMIFH2 had no effect on the barbed end depolymerization rate without formin ( Fig - ure S1B ) . Second , we determined the effect of SMIFH2 on the ability of formin to bind to the barbed end and reduce the rate of monomer addition ( Figures S1C – S1E ) . Cdc12 binds to preassembled barbed ends and severely inhibits their elongation in the absence of proﬁlin ( Figures S1D and S1E ) ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . In a con - centration - dependent manner , SMIFH2 prevents Cdc12 from binding to the barbed end , allowing ﬁlaments to elongate near the control rate ( Figures S1D and S1E ) . Conversely , SMIFH2 had no effect on the rate of barbed end elongation in the absence of formin ( Figures S1C and S1E ) . Third , we determined that SMIFH2 does not allow formin to inhibit the end - to - end annealing of actin ﬁlaments ( Figure S2 ) . Formin - associated ﬁlaments do not anneal ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . SMIFH2 allowed preassembled ﬁlaments severed in the pres - ence of Cdc12 to anneal ( Figures S2A and S2B ) and allowed Cdc12 - and mDia2 - nucleated ﬁlament seeds to anneal ( Figures S2C and S2D ) . Conversely , SMIFH2 had no effect on annealing in the absence of formin ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Direct Observation of Formin Inhibition by Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) Microscopy To verify that SMIFH2 speciﬁcally inhibits formin - mediated actin assembly , we used TIRF microscopy to observe individual ﬁla - ments assembled from formin in solution ( Figure 3 ) or from for - min immobilized on beads ( Figure 4 ) . When 1 . 5 m M Mg - ATP actin monomers ( 33 % labeled with Oregon green for visualization ) are assembled in the presence of 5 . 0 nM mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) and 2 . 5 m M proﬁlin , two ﬁlament populations are present that differ by both elongation rate and brightness ( Figure 3A ) ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . The ﬁrst population consists of ‘‘bright’’ control ﬁla - ments whose barbed ends are not associated with formin and elongate at (cid:2) 14 subunits / second ( sub / s ) ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . The second population consists of ‘‘dim’’ formin - associated ﬁla - ments that elongate their barbed ends signiﬁcantly faster at (cid:2) 60 sub / s . 450 s after the reaction was initiated , just over 80 % of the ﬁlaments were associated with formin ( Figure 3G ) . In reactions containing 100 m M SMIFH2 , control ﬁlaments were unaffected , whereas the average number of dim formin - associated ﬁlaments was signiﬁcantly reduced to (cid:2) 10 % of the total ﬁlament population ( Figures 3C – 3D and 3G ) .

A plot of the dependence of the percentage of formin - nucleated ﬁlaments on the concentration of SMIFH2 revealed half - maximal inhibition at (cid:2) 25 m M SMIFH2 ( Figure 3H ) . When 1 . 5 m M Mg - ATP actin monomers ( 33 % labeled with Oregon green ) and 7 . 5 m M proﬁlin is ﬂowed into a chamber con - taining 2 . 0 m m carboxylate beads preabsorbed with GST - mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) , actin ﬁlaments are nucleated from and remain processively associated with formin immobilized on the beads ( Figure 4A ) ( Michelot et al . , 2007 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) . Each formin - absorbedbeadaveragedslightlymorethanfourﬁlaments by 375 s ( Figure 4E ) , which elongated at a rate of (cid:2) 40 sub / s ( Fig - ure 4B ) . Filaments processively associated with mDia1 elongate their barbed ends 33 % slower in the presence of 7 . 5 m M proﬁlin than in the presence of 2 . 5 m M proﬁlin ( Figures 3B and 4B ) ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . When incubated with 100 m M SMIFH2 each formin - absorbed bead averaged less than 0 . 05 ﬁlaments ( Figures 4C and 4E ) , which elongated at (cid:2) 44 sub / s ( Figure 4D ) . A plot of the dependence of the average number of ﬁlaments per bead on the concentration of SMIFH2 revealed half - maximal inhibition at (cid:2) 15 m M SMIFH2 ( Figure 4F ) . Although formin is likely the molecular target , it is theoretically possible that SMIFH2 binds to actin in a manner that inhibits formin - mediated assembly but not ( 1 ) spontaneous actin assembly without formin ( Figure 2C ) , ( 2 ) barbed end elongation without formin ( Figures 2G and 2I and Figures S1C and S1E ) , ( 3 ) barbed end depolymerization without formin ( Figure S1B ) , and ( 4 ) Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . To establish that the molecular target of SMIFH2 is for - min , we tested the effect of washing out SMIFH2 from formin - associated beads before the addition of actin monomers ( Fig - ures 4G and 4H ) . In this case , formin - associated beads , but not actin , are exclusively treated with SMIFH2 . We found that extensively washing beads one and ﬁve minutes before the addi - tion of actin monomers only partly recovered the nucleation activity of formin - associated beads to (cid:2) 0 . 5 and (cid:2) 1 . 25 ﬁlaments per bead ( Figure 4G ) . Increased nucleation activity after ﬁve minutes likely reﬂects the dissociation rate of SMIFH2 from formin . Inhibition of the Fission Yeast Formin - Dependent Actin Cytoskeleton We examined the effect of SMIFH2 on ﬁssion yeast to determine whether the compound inhibits formin - mediated processes in cells . Fission yeast assembles four distinct ﬁlamentous actin structures that depend on different actin nucleation factors ( Figure 5A ) ( La Carbona et al . , 2006 ; Marks and Hyams , 1985 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for endocytic actin patches at sites of polarized growth ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ; McCol - lum et al . , 1996 ) . Three formin isoforms are speciﬁcally required for polarized actin cables ( For3p ; Feierbach and Chang , 2001 ; Nakano et al . , 2002 ) , the cytokinetic contractile ring ( Cdc12p ; Chang et al . , 1997 ) , and the mating projection tip ( Fus1p ; Petersen et al . , 1998 ) . We imaged ﬁssion yeast cells expressing GFP - CHD ( actin binding domain of Rng2 ) to label the entire ﬁla - mentous actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 5A ) ( Martin and Chang , 2006 ) . An asynchronous population of control cells treated with DMSO contained Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent patches as well as formin - dependent actin cables and contractile rings . The non - speciﬁc actin depolymerizing drug LatA completely disas - sembled all ﬁlamentous actin structures ( Figure 5A ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK - 666 speciﬁcally disassembled Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin patches ( Figure 5A ) ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , 25 m M SMIFH2 disassembled formin - dependent actin cables and contractile rings , but not actin A 1 . 0 µM ATP - actin with 5 . 0 nM mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) and 2 . 5 µM MmPRF1 + 100 µM SMIFH2 75 225 375 75 225 375 c1 c1 c2 c2 c2 c1 c1 c1 c3 c3 c4 c5 f1 f1 f1 f2 f2 f2 f3 f3 f4 f4 f5 f5 f6 f6 f7 f8 f9 f12 f7 C B Time , seconds 20 F il a m en t l eng t h , T hou s and s o f s ubun i t s 15 10 5 00 100 200 300 Formin : 57 . 4 sub / s Control : 14 . 3 sub / s D Time , seconds 20 F il a m en t l eng t h , T hou s and s o f s ubun i t s 15 10 5 00 100 200 300 Formin : 59 . 6 sub / s Control : 16 . 1 sub / s G H [ SMIFH2 ] , µM 0 50 100 150 m D i a1 - nu c l ea t e d f il a m e n t s , % 0 20 40 60 80 100 m D i a1 - nu c l ea t e d f il a m e n t s , % mDia1only 100 µM SMIFH2 0 20 40 60 80 100 100 µM Analog 2 + 100 µM Analog 2 75 225 375 c1 c2 c3 E c1 c1 c2 c2 c3 F Time , seconds 20 F il a m en t l eng t h , T hou s and s o f s ubun i t s 15 10 5 00 100 200 300 Formin : 62 . 3 sub / s Control : 17 . 1 sub / s c2 c2 Figure 3 .

The concentration of SMIFH2 required to disassemble actin cables and contractile rings varied ( Figure 5B ) . Whereas actin cables were lost in the presence of only 2 . 5 m M SMIFH2 , disassembly of contractile rings required 25 m M SMIFH2 . It is possible that contractile rings are more robust than actin cables or that For3 is more sensitive to SMIFH2 than is Cdc12 . To quantify the inhibitory effect of SMIFH2 on formin - dependent actin cables and contractile rings , we imaged ﬁssion yeast cells expressing integrated GFP fusions to proteins that localize to particular actin structures ( Figure 5C ) . As expected , actin capping protein - labeled actin patches ( Acp2 - GFP ) were observable in 100 % of cells treated with 10 m M SMIFH2 . However , the localization of GFP - tagged proteins to formin - dependent actin cables and the contractile ring was abrogated . Although type V myosin ( Myo52 - GFP ) normally localizes to the tips of interphase cells via actin cables , 10 m M SMIFH2 caused Myo52 - GFP to become distributed throughout the cell . Myo52 - GFP also distributes throughout the cell in formin For3 null cells that completely lack actin cables ( Feierbach and Chang , 2001 ) . Additionally , both the regulatory light chain ( Rlc1 - GFP ) and type II myosin ( Myo2 - GFP ) appeared as punctate spots rather than continuous smooth formin - dependent contractile rings at the division site in 10 m M SMIFH2 - treated cells . Structure - Activity Relationship of SMIFH2 To gain insight into the structure - function proﬁle of SMIFH2 ( 1 ) , we characterized the ability of six other compounds ( 2 – 7 ) , including both pyrimidine - 2 , 4 , 6 - triones and 2 - thiooxodihydro - pyrimidine - 4 , 6 - diones , to inhibit formin - mediated actin assem - bly in vitro and disrupt the ﬁssion yeast actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 1 ) . We found that the ability of analogs to inhibit formin - mediated actin assembly in vitro ( Figures 1B and 3E – 3G ) corre - lated closely with their ability to disrupt the ﬁssion yeast formin - dependent actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 1C ) . None of the analogs removed Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin patches . Analogs 2 and 3 were the most potent both in vitro and in ﬁssion yeast . Similar to SMIFH2 ( 1 ) , cells treated with 10 m M of analogs 2 and 3 for 30 min lost actin cables , resulting in mislocalization of the type V myosin Myo52 - GFP from cell tips and throughout the cell . Analog 4 had lower potency , whereas analogs 5 , 6 , and 7 had little effect on both formin - mediated actin assembly in vitro and actin cables in ﬁssion yeast cells . Our results strongly suggested that the thiourea moiety of SMIFH2 is an important pharmacophoric element of this compound since a substitution of this unit by the urea fragment resulted in substantial loss in activity .

Chemistry & Biology Small Molecule Formin Inhibitor 1162 Chemistry & Biology 16 , 1158 – 1168 , November 25 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved molecule - 1 , with compounds 5 and 6 being the most potent in the series ( Harriman et al . , 2008 ) . Despite notable structural homology between 5 , 6 , and SMIFH2 ( 1 ) , there is a substantial difference in their ability to inhibit formin - mediated actin assembly . This data suggests that the cell - based activity of SMIFH2 is due to selective modulation of formin and that the activity proﬁle is uniquely linked to the thiourea - containing struc - ture of this compound . SMIFH2 - Induced Cytotoxicity and Growth Inhibition of NIH 3T3 Fibroblasts NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were incubated with a range of concentra - tions of SMIFH2 to determine its effects on adherent mammalian cells . Cell viability was assessed after 24 hr . SMIFH2 elicited cytotoxicity with an IC 50 of 28 m M ( Figure 6A ) . We also observed dose - dependent growth inhibition of NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts within a period of 96 hr ( Figure 6B ) . In addition , cells cultured in SMIFH2 with concentrations as low as 2 . 5 m M were observed to have cytokinesis defects , as measured by the percentage of multi - nucleated cells . After 4 days , 8 . 6 ± 2 % of cells cultured in 2 . 5 m M SMIFH2 had multiple nuclei as compared to 1 . 1 ± 0 . 7 % of cells treated with a DMSO control . This cytokinesis defect is consistent with recent data showing that siRNA depletion of mDia2 in NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts increases the percentage of binu - cleate cells to (cid:2) 35 % ( Watanabe et al . , 2008 ) . Cellular Morphology and Protrusion Phenotypes Observed in NIH 3T3 Fibroblasts We took time - lapse images of NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts to visualize SMIFH2 - induced phenotypes in mammalian cells . The migration rate of cells treated with 10 m M SMIFH2 for > 2 hr was reduced two - fold compared to control cells ( Figure 6C ) , which is consis - tent with previous studies implicating mDia2 in cell migration ( Gupton et al . , 2007 ) . Control cells are characterized by a spread morphology and thin sheet - like protrusions termed lamellipodia that require Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly . Over 90 % of control cells have lamellipodia ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Despite a less spread morphology , approximately 20 % of cells treated with less than 20 m M SMIFH2 for 6 hr still extended lamel - lipodial protrusions ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Mouse formin mDia2 has been implicated in the assembly of cortical actin required for maintaining plasma membrane integrity , and inhibition of mDia2ledtoabundantnonapoptoticmembraneblebbing ( Eisen - mann et al . , 2007 ) . Consistent with this result , we observed that 20 % of cells treated with 10 – 20 m M SMIFH2 for 6 hr exhibit constitutive , dynamic , small ( < 1 m m ) blebs ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . At 30 m M SMIFH2 , nearly all the cells exhibited large blebs ( Figures 6D and 6E ) , which is consistent with an IC 50 of 28 m M SMIFH2 for NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 6A ) . Effects of SMIFH2 perfusion were reversible on the time scale of 5 to 10 min ( data not shown ) . The observed phenotype changes slowly over time when cells are incubated with 10 m M SMIFH2 ( Figure 6F ) . After 2 hr 60 % still retain the lamellipodial protrusive phenotype , whereas 40 % protrude by means of small dynamic blebs ( Figure 6F ) . After 7 hr the percentage of cells exhibiting either lamellipodial protru - sions or constitutive small blebbing decreases dramatically , while the percentage of cells that lack protrusive activity and appear phase dark near the cell periphery increases ( Figure 6F ) . Because of the static , round shape of these cells , we term this phenotype ‘‘bulbous’’ ( Figure 6D ) . The phase dark appearance near the cell periphery suggests an increase in cell thickness in this region , which may be due to decreased stability of the ﬁla - mentous actin cortex . 25 µM LatA DMSO A 25 µM SMIFH2 0 µM 1 µM 2 . 5 µM 10 µM 25 µM B G F P - CHD C G F P - CHD D M S O S M I F H 2 Acp2 - GFP Myo52 - GFP Rlc1 - GFP Myo2 - GFP 100 % 100 % 90 . 2 % 10 . 5 % 93 . 9 % 23 . 8 % 89 . 5 % 48 . 8 % 100 µM CK - 666 Figure 5 .

Chemistry & Biology Small Molecule Formin Inhibitor Chemistry & Biology 16 , 1158 – 1168 , November 25 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1163 F - Actin Cytoskeleton in SMIFH2 - Treated 3T3 Fibroblasts We imaged ﬁlamentous actin and the focal adhesion marker paxillin to assess the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells treated with SMIFH2 ( Figure 7A ) . In ﬁbroblasts the actin cytoskeleton is typically organized into prominent type II myosin - dependent contractile bundles . The width and actin ﬁla - ment density of these bundles were characterized by quantifying the variation in intensity of ﬂuorescent phalloidin across the bundles . ‘‘Thick’’ F - actin bundles have a mean width of 1 . 5 m m and a 2 . 4 - fold higher local actin ﬁlament density compared with the surrounding region ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . ‘‘Thin’’ F - actin bundles have a mean width of 0 . 7 m m and a 1 . 5 - fold enhanced actin ﬁlament density . Interestingly , focal adhesions are similar in cells with thick or thin F - actin bundles ( Figures 7A ) . In control cells , over 80 % of the ﬁbroblasts exhibited predominately thick F - actin bundles , with only 20 % exhibiting thin bundles ( Fig - ure 7C ) . However , 60 % of cells incubated with 10 m M of SMIFH2 for 2 hr havethin F - actin bundlesand only20 % havethick F - actin bundles ( Figure 7C ) . Moreover , approximately 5 % of the spread cells have a disorganized lamellar network and no F - actin bundles ( Figures 7A and 7C ) . In cells lacking F - actin bundles , focal adhesion plaques were signiﬁcantly reduced in size , remi - niscent of nascent focal complexes that are observed to form in the absence of myosin II - driven tension ( Figure 7A ) ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . As the concentration of SMIFH2 was increased to 20 m M , the percentage of cells that lacked F - actin bundles increases to 50 % , with the rest of the population showing only thin bundles ( Figure 7C ) . Importantly , all spread cells have an F - actin - rich lamellipodia near the cell periphery , which is depen - dent on Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly ( Figure 7A , arrows ) . Thus , at intermediate SMIFH2 concentrations the ﬁla - mentous actin organization of cells that remain spread is in the form of thin F - actin bundles or an isotropic lamellar meshwork . This is consistent with previous reports that mDia1 , in addition to the Rho effector Rho kinase , is essential to building contractile stress ﬁbers and the growth of focal complexes ( Hotulainen and Lappalainen , 2006 ; Riveline et al . , 2001 ; Watanabe et al . , 1999 ) . Changes in F - actin organization and adhesion were not observed with analog compounds ( data not shown ) . Impact of SMIFH2 on a Carcinoma Cell Line A549 We treated the carcinoma cell line A549 with a range of SMIFH2 concentrations to determine the effect of SMIFH2 on diverse cells . A549 cells are exceptionally more tolerant , with an IC 50 near 75 m M SMFH2 and a higher dose of SMIFH2 was required to inhibit growth ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Treatment of A549 cells for 4 days with 30 m M SMIFH2 increases the percentage Lamellipodia ( LP ) Small Bleb Large Bleb Bulbous Phenotype at 6 hr incubation Phenotype in 10 µM SMIFH2 % v i ab l e c e ll s log [ SMIFH2 ] , µM 2 4 6 8 0 20 40 60 80 100 LP Bulbous Small Bleb % o f c e ll s Incubation time , hr 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 20 40 60 80 100 % o f c e ll s [ SMIFH2 ] , µM LP Large Bleb Small Bleb Bulbous D E F IC50 = 28 . 0 µM - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 0 20 40 60 80 100 A B C m i g r a t i on r a t e ( µ m / h r ) DMSOControl 0 5 10 15 10 µM SMIFH2 2 hr 6 hr g r o w t h ( x 10 5 a . u . ) time , hr 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 DMSO12 . 5 µM SMIFH2 25 µM 50 µM 100 µM Figure 6 .

In contrast to the NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , a majority of A549 cells treated with 30 m M SMIFH2 remained spread over the course of an 8 hr time - lapse movie . However , (cid:2) 40 % have spherical bleb - like protrusions that rapidly extended and retracted at the cell periphery ( FiguresS3CandS3D ) . In10 % ofcells , theseprotrusions were stabilized by adhesion to the external matrix and resulted in changesincellshape ( FiguresS3CandS3D ) . Immunoﬂuorescence images revealed regions near the cell periphery with high ﬁlamen - tous actin intensity and numerous small focal complexes that existed beyond the zone of large focal adhesions ( Figure S3E ) . Thus , it appears that SMIFH2 treatment induces bleb - like protru - sionsnearthecellperipherywithoutsigniﬁcantlyalteringtheforma - tion of focal complexes . This is consistent with reports suggesting that the RhoA pathway and its effector , mDia1 , are instrumental in maintaining cortical integrity to limit protrusive activity ( Worthylake and Burridge , 2003 ) . Such bleb - like protrusions have been observedinseveralcelltypes , buttherelativecontributionsofactin polymerization and local cortical tension in regulating cellular protrusions has not been well established ( Fackler and Grosse , 2008 ) . These results suggest that reduction in formin - mediated actin polymerization at the plasma membrane results in local cortical weakening . In this scenario , the forcesfor protrusion might originate from osmotic pressure - driven changes in membrane shape rather than from actin polymerization . Additional work is required to elucidate the mechanism of differences in drug toxicity between these two cell lines ; possible reasons are changes in expression of different isoforms of formins or different formin activity due to different levels of the formin activator RhoA .

Future Considerations Analysis of SMIFH2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK - 666 demonstrates the usefulness of ﬁssion yeast to deter - mine the speciﬁcity of drugs on actin cytoskeleton processes . Extensive work is required to determine which speciﬁc actin - modulating proteins are required for the at least 15 processes in verte - brates ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ) . Fission yeast assembles actin into just four structures ( La Carbona et al . , 2006 ; Marks and Hyams , 1985 ) . The ease of genetic manipulation and visualiza - tion of functional GFP - tagged proteins expressed from their endogenous locus has provided a nearly complete proﬁle of which evolutionarily conserved actin - binding proteins are required for each structure in budding and ﬁssion yeast ( La Car - bona et al . , 2006 ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ) . Inhibitor speciﬁcity can be investigated in yeast , and then used to determine which processes in animals depend on the drug’s target . Yeast has also been useful for testing the speciﬁcity of drugs targeting other fundamental cellular processes ( Lehar et al . , 2008 ; Lopez et al . , 2008 ) . As a general inhibitor , which targets diverse formin isoforms with similar potency , SMIFH2 may be a useful drug for identifying cellular processes dependent on formin - mediated actin assembly in a broad range of experimental systems . However , it will be important to isolate formin isoform - speciﬁc inhibitors to determine which formin is required for a particular cellular process . Furthermore , particular formin isoforms are involved in malignant tumor formation and are highly overexpressed in a range of cancer cell types ( Favaro et al . , 2003 ; Kitzing et al . , 2007 ; Sarmiento et al . , 2008 ; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . Isoform - speciﬁc inhibitors are likely to be better anti - metastatic tumor drugs because they may target tumor cells while having less impact on surrounding healthy tissues . SIGNIFICANCE Formins are required to stimulate actin ﬁlament assembly at the correct time and place to drive fundamental cellular Chemistry & Biology Small Molecule Formin Inhibitor Chemistry & Biology 16 , 1158 – 1168 , November 25 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1165 processes such as division , adhesion , and establishing polarity . Formin inhibitors would be an extremely useful reagent because most eukaryotic organisms express mul - tiple formins whose cellular roles have not been determined and because formins are required for processes deregu - lated during metastic tumor formation . We established a simple ﬂuorescent - based in vitro screen to discover for the ﬁrst time a general small molecular formin inhibitor that we named SMIFH2 ( small molecule inhibitor of formin FH2 domains ) . SMIFH2 is a general formin inhibitor that targets evolutionarily diverse formin isoforms from budding yeast , ﬁssion yeast , nematode worm , and mouse , with similar (cid:2) 5 to 15 m M half - maximal potency . SMIFH2 inhibits formin at multiple points from preventing both nucleation and processive barbed end elongation and decreases formin’s afﬁnity for the barbed end . We veriﬁed that SMIFH2 abolishes formin - dependent actin cytoskeletal structures in both ﬁssion yeast and animal cells . SMIFH2 disrupts formin - dependent actin cables and contractile rings in ﬁssion yeast , but does not target endocytic actin patches , which are dependent on the other major actin nucleation factor , Arp2 / 3 complex . Although it is possible that SMIFH2 has additional cellular targets , the potency of analog compounds on formin - mediated actin assembly in vitro directly correlates with their potency on the ﬁssion yeast formin actin cytoskeleton . In animal cells , SMIFH2 severely disrupts formin - dependent stress ﬁbers and per - turbs cell division and motility , but does not disrupt Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent lamellipodia near the cell periphery . SMIFH2 may be a useful drug to elucidate formin - dependent processes in a wide range of organisms and cell types . Future work will focus on elucidating where SMIFH2 binds formin , optimization of SMIFH2 activity , and expan - sion of the in vitro screen to identify formin isoform - speciﬁc inhibitors . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Compounds and Protein Puriﬁcation Compounds were purchased from ChemBridge Corporation : SMIFH2 , analog 2 , analog 3 , analog 4 , analog 5 , analog 6 , and analog 7 . Proceduresfor protein puriﬁcation can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Formin Inhibitor Screen Small molecules were initially screened by a single - point pyrene - ﬂuorescence assay . In96wellplates , 1 . 5 m MMg - ATP - actin ( 20 % pyrene - labeled ) andeither 10 nM mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) or 20 nM mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) with 1 . 5 m M mouse proﬁlin MmPRF1 was assembled in the presence of 960 pools of 8 small molecules ( Chembridge ; 12 . 5 m M ﬁnal concentration of each small molecule ) for 30 min and read on a Saﬁre 2 ﬂuorescent plate reader ( Tecan ) . Positive hits had 50 % or lower ﬂuorescence than control reactions without small molecules . Sixty - one positive pools were re - screened kinetically by following the time course of pyrene ﬂuorescence ( actin assembly ) of 1 . 5 m M Mg - ATP - actin with 10 nM mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) or 20 nM mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) and 1 . 5 m M MmPRF1 . Forty - six positive pools assembled at least 2 - fold slower than control reactions without small molecules . The 368 individual compounds were subsequently screened against both mDia1 and mDia2 by the single - point assay ( 42 compounds in - hibited pyrene ﬂuorescence by at least 50 % ) and by the kinetic assay ( 34 compounds slowed the rate of assembly by at least 2 - fold ) . Thirty of the thirty - four compounds did not inhibit the rate of 1 . 5 m M actin assembly in the absence of formin . The ﬁnal 30 compounds were screened kinetically over a range of concentrations . Two small molecules , SMIFH2 and analog 2 , inhibited formin - mediated actin assembly by at least 50 % at a concentration of 10 m M and were characterized further .

Serial dilutions ( 2 - or 3 - fold ) in DMSO were performed using a stock solution of SMIFH2 in DMSO .

After three washes in PBS , coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C in Alexa 568 - conjugated anti - rabbit ( 1 : 400 ; Molecular Probes ) and were subsequently washed three times in PBS and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade reagent ( Molecular Probes ) . Images were acquired with an inverted Nikon Ti microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera ( Photometrics , Coolsnap HQ2 ) . Time - Lapse Imaging NIH 3T3 Fibroblasts or A549 carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to spread for 24 hr .
