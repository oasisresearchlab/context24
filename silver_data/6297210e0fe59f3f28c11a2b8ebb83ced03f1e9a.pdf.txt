We developed Accelerated Sensor of Action Potentials 1 ( ASAP1 ) , a voltage sensor design in which a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein is inserted in an extracellular loop of a voltage - sensing domain , rendering fluorescence responsive to membrane potential . ASAP1 demonstrated on and off kinetics of ~ 2 ms , reliably detected single action potentials and subthreshold potential changes , and tracked trains of action potential waveforms up to 200 Hz in single trials . With a favorable combination of brightness , dynamic range and speed , ASAP1 enables continuous monitoring of membrane potential in neurons at kilohertz frame rates using standard epifluorescence microscopy . Understanding how information is processed in the brain would benefit from precise spatio - temporal recording of electrical activity in individual neurons and larger neuronal circuits . Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators are promising tools for optical reporting of brain activity , as they allow monitoring of genetically defined neuro - nal circuits and do not require chemical access . An ideal genetically encoded indicator would produce large fluorescence responses , facili - tating spatio - temporal imaging of how input signals are processed by neurons into output responses such as action potentials ( APs ) 1 , 2 . An ideal indicator would also have millisecond - timescale kinetics , enabling interrogation of synchrony and temporal coding in indi - vidual neurons and across large neuronal populations 3 . In particular , tracking high - frequency firing would be useful for visualizing how bursts of neurotransmission are decoded by postsynaptic neurons 4 and for understanding how the 50 – 200 - Hz firing of fast - spiking interneurons regulates information processing in the brain 5 , 6 or is affected in disease 7 . A genetically encoded sensor with these capabilities had not pre - viously been developed . After intense engineering efforts , fluores - cent protein – based calcium reporters can now detect single APs 8 . However , they do not provide a direct readout of membrane potential changes . Furthermore , given that calcium transients can persist in neurons for hundreds of milliseconds 9 , calcium responses cannot track high - frequency AP trains . For example , the responses measured by GCaMP6f , the fastest variant in the latest iteration of calcium sen - sors , have mean half decay times ( τ 1 / 2 ) of 142 ± 11 ms ( 1 AP , mouse V1 cortex ) , 400 ± 41 ms ( 10 APs , dissociated neuronal cultures ) and ~ 650 ms ( zebrafish tectum ) 8 . Accurate reporting of neuronal activity would therefore benefit from sensors that more directly report membrane potential . Existing fluorescent voltage sensors are constructed from one of two types of voltage - sensing proteins : seven - helix microbial rhodopsins and four - helix voltage - sensing domains ( VSDs ) from voltage - sensitive phosphatases or ion channels . Some rhodopsin - based sensors pro - duce large fluorescence responses in dissociated neuronal cultures , but they are not sufficiently bright to report neuronal activity over background fluorescence in brain slices or in vivo 10 , 11 . In addition , they are still slow compared with the typical 2 - ms duration of APs in pyramidal neurons . Finally , their use can be complicated by the dependence of voltage sensitivity on illumination intensity and wavelength , and nonlinear increases in fluorescence with increas - ing illumination intensity 12 . Voltage sensors using four - helix VSDs are typically brighter than rhodopsin - based sensors , but produce suboptimal fluorescence responses to neuronal activity 13 – 19 , exhibit inactivation kinetics that are too slow for following fast trains of APs 13 , 15 – 17 , 19 , 20 , and / or require excitation at wavelengths below 450 nm , where phototoxicity and autofluorescence are more problematic 17 , 18 . The recently developed ArcLight sensor produces the largest fluores - cence response to APs among previously reported VSD - based sensors and is excited at ~ 488 nm , but slow kinetics limit its ability to resolve closely spaced spikes , especially when they are superposed on large excitatory postsynaptic potentials 15 , 18 , 21 . Thus , no existing genetically encoded activity sensor possesses all of the characteristics needed for accurate optical reporting of neuronal activity in vivo . We therefore sought to develop a voltage sensor with sufficient brightness , dynamic range and kinetics for detection of neuronal activity ranging from subthreshold potentials to rapid trains of APs . RESULTS The extracellular loop between the third ( S3 ) and fourth ( S4 ) trans - membrane segments of VSDs is thought to undergo substantial con - formational changes following depolarization 22 . In particular , crystal structures of a VSD isolated from the seasquirt Ciona intestinalis voltage - sensitive phosphatase ( VSP ) suggest that repolarization 1 Department of Bioengineering , Stanford University , Stanford , California , USA . 2 Department of Pediatrics , Stanford University , Stanford , California , USA . 3 James H .

We reasoned that insertion of GFP into this location might allow voltage - induced movements to perturb GFP fluorescence . We also hypothesized that circular permutation of GFP , bringing its termini near the chromo - phore , would enhance conformational coupling between the VSD and fluorescent protein domains . We chose a VSD from the chicken Gallus gallus as an initial candidate VSD because it has a shorter S3 - S4 loop than Ciona intestinalis VSD ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , which we hypothesized would increase coupling between voltage - induced move - ments and GFP barrel distortions . We constructed and tested fusions of the circularly permuted GFP ( cpGFP ) from GCaMP3 ( ref . 24 ) to the S3 - S4 loop of the Gallus gallus VSD ( GgVSD ) . We included an R153Q mutation that has been shown to shift the voltage response of Ciona intestinalis VSPs to a less negative range of potentials 25 . We obtained several protein constructs with cpGFP inserted into GgVSD that were well expressed at the plasma membrane of HEK293A human embryonic kidney cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) and showed a fluorescence decrease in response to membrane depolarization ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Beginning with the brightest variant , where cpGFP was inserted between residues 147 and 148 of GgVSD , we tested substitutions of various fluorescent proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) and found that the OPT variant of circularly permuted superfolder GFP 26 ( cpsfGFP - OPT ) improved both bright - ness and dynamic range while maintaining efficient expression at the membrane . We named this protein Accelerated Sensor of Action Potentials 1 ( ASAP1 ; Fig . 1a ) . We created ASAP1 variants to test whether our initial choice of GgVSD with an R153Q mutation was optimal . Substituting VSDs from Danio rerio or Xenopus laevis in place of GgVSD in ASAP1 produced voltage sensors with comparable membrane expression , but lowered dynamic range ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Sensors contain - ing the VSD from Ciona intestinalis ( CiVSD ) did not localize well to the plasma membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . As fusions with fluo - rescent proteins at either intracellular termini of CiVSD can be well localized at the membrane 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 25 , the observed mislocalization appears to be specific to insertion of a fluorescent protein into the extracellular S3 - S4 loop rather than an intrinsic property of CiVSD . Reversion of the R153Q mutation did not affect membrane expression of ASAP1 , but lowered the fluorescence response to hyperpolarizing signals ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , c ) . We next investigated the structural determinants necessary for the voltage sensitivity of ASAP1 . Dimming following depolariza - tion suggested that VSD movement disrupts hydrogen - bonding interactions between the beta - barrel and the chromophore that stabilize the deprotonated form of the chromophore .

The corresponding FWHM of the fluorescence responses ( bottom ) were 3 . 7 ms and 6 . 5 ms for ASAP1 and ArcLight Q239 , respectively .

Each data point is the average response of an individual neuron over 12 – 25 APs per neuron ( 91 APs total for ASAP1 and 87 APs total for ArcLight Q239 ) . For each sensor , the mean response over all tested neurons is depicted using a horizontal bar . © 201 4 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Removing the first residue of cpsfGFP - OPT ( immediately following the S3 - GFP junction , Phe145 in the original GFP numbering ) severely reduced response . In contrast , removing other amino acids at the GgVSD / cpsfGFP - OPT junction , such as the last residue of cpsfGFP - OPT , had modest effects on dynamic range ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . Certain conservative mutations of Phe145 impaired response ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Notably , mutation of Phe145 to Tyr markedly reduced dynamic range . This result is consistent with the smaller response amplitude of our initial sensors , which used an alternative cpGFP contain - ing Tyr145 ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Our findings suggest that the modulation of cpsfGFP - OPT by voltage is sensitive to the struc - ture near the breakpoint , as previously seen with calcium sensors based on circularly permuted fluorescent proteins 27 , 28 . In particular , they suggest that cpsfGFP - OPT responds to a conformational change on the S3 side of the linker , consistent with models of VSD structural transitions 23 . We next tested ASAP1 expression in neurons . ASAP1 produced excellent membrane localization in living dissociated hippocampal neurons and fixed brain slices , both at the cell body and in individual dendrites ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To determine whether ASAP1 expression altered membrane capacitance , we transfected cul - tured neurons with 1 – 4 times the amount of ASAP1 plasmid used in typical fluorescence imaging experiments . Under these condi - tions , we observed no change in membrane capacitance following ASAP1 expression compared to that in GFP - transfected neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . We then quantified ASAP1’s dynamic range and kinetics . When expressed in HEK293A cells , ASAP1 responded to voltage steps from −120 to 50 mV with a total fluorescence change ( ∆ F / F ) of −36 . 3 ± 1 . 6 % ( mean ± s . e . m . ; Fig . 1c , d ) . The response to a 100 - mV depolarization from a holding potential of −70 mV was −17 . 5 ± 1 . 0 % ∆ F / F ( Fig . 1d ) , an order of magnitude larger than previous cpGFP - based voltage sensors such as ElectrikPk 14 . ASAP1 also produced large changes to hyperpolarizing signals , with ∆ F / F of 11 . 7 ± 0 . 6 % Figure 2 Monitoring simulated AP trains in voltage - clamped HEK293A cells . ( a ) ASAP1 followed 200 - Hz trains of AP waveforms , whereas ArcLight Q239 followed trains of 30 Hz , but not 100 or 200 Hz . For each frequency , simulated trains of APs ( 2 . 0 - ms FWHM , 75 - mV peak amplitude ) were applied for 1 s . Traces shown are the fluorescence response to 5 AP waveforms at 500 ms from the start of each train . ( b ) Quantification of frequency responses of ASAP1 and ArcLight Q239 to 100 - Hz and 200 - Hz simulated spike trains . The power spectral density ( PSD ) of optical responses during spike trains was estimated as the magnitude - squared of the Fourier transform of the fluorescence signal . Amplitudes of the 100 - Hz and 200 - Hz power peaks for the 100 - Hz and 200 - Hz spike trains , respectively , were calculated and normalized to ASAP1’s mean 100 - Hz peak amplitude during 100 - Hz trains . Consistent with the example traces shown in a , ArcLight Q239 produced little or no response at these frequencies , with mean peak amplitudes of 0 . 012 ± 0 . 001 ( 100 Hz ) and < 0 . 001 ( 200 Hz ) . ASAP1 showed greater mean response amplitudes to both 100 - Hz and 200 - Hz simulated AP trains ( 100 Hz , P = 0 . 021 ; 200 Hz , P = 0 . 031 ) . Differences are statistically significant ( asterisks ) following Holm - Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons .

In HEK293A cells at 22 °C , ASAP1 had rapid biexponential kinetics , with activation and inactivation being characterized by a fast component with time constants of 2 . 1 ± 0 . 2 ms and 2 . 0 ± 0 . 1 ms , respectively ( Fig . 1e ) . The fast component accounted for 60 . 2 ± 1 . 2 % and 43 . 7 ± 0 . 6 % of the full activation and deactivation kinetics , respectively . For comparison , we characterized ArcLight Q239 , the voltage sensor with the largest fluorescence response to APs of all previous VSD - based sensors . The fast components of the ASAP1 response for activation and inactivation were 7 . 0 ( P = 0 . 00063 ) and 22 . 5 ( P = 0 . 002 ) times as fast as those of ArcLight Q239 , respec - tively , whereas the slow components were 1 . 7 ( P = 0 . 034 ) and 5 . 4 ( P = 0 . 0095 , two - tail Mann - Whitney U test ) times as fast . We predicted that ASAP1’s faster kinetics compared with ArcLight Q239 would increase the fidelity by which fluorescence tracks transmembrane voltage and would enhance responses to fast events such as APs . Indeed , although ArcLight Q239 produced a broad fluorescence trace in response to single APs in cultured hippo - campal neurons , as previously reported 15 , the fluorescence response of ASAP1 to single APs more closely resembled the correspond - ing voltage response ( Fig . 1f ) . Averaging over the entire cell body , ASAP1 produced a fluorescence response of −4 . 8 ± 0 . 5 % , 2 . 2 times as large as the −2 . 2 ± 0 . 2 % response that we observed with Arclight Q239 ( Fig . 1g ) . The larger response to single APs with ASAP1 is consistent with its ~ 7 - fold faster on ( activation ) kinetics , which are better matched to the kinetics of APs . We next tested the ability of ASAP1 to track various membrane potential waveforms . In voltage - clamped HEK293A cells , ASAP1 was able to track spike trains of up to 200 Hz while clearly discern - ing individual peaks in single trials without filtering . In contrast , ArcLight Q239 traces at 100 Hz appeared to be flattened with an elevated baseline and poor peak discrimination ( Fig . 2a , b ) . In cul - tured hippocampal pyramidal neurons , ASAP1 was able to detect subthreshold depolarizations in the form of simulated excitatory post - synaptic potentials ( EPSPs ) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials of 5 – 20 - mV amplitude , comparing favorably with ArcLight Q239 ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Notably , ASAP1 was able to resolve spikes superimposed on a large compound EPSP , whereas ArcLight Q239 was not ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . ASAP1 also detected spontaneous spikes , spontaneous ~ 10 - Hz bursting and subthreshold potential changes between spikes in neurons ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . As observed previously under voltage clamp ( Fig . 3c ) , ArcLight Q239 failed to detect or produced minimal responses to spontane - ous APs superposed on large EPSPs ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) .

From cell to cell , ASAP1 mean fluorescence responses ranged from −4 . 8 to −8 . 1 % , averaging −6 . 3 ± 0 . 6 % ( n = 6 neurons from 5 litters , ≥ 10 APs per neuron ) . The arrow indicates an AP not detected by ArcLight Q239 . Additional examples are shown in Supplementary Figure 8 . ( b ) ASAP1 followed a spontaneous AP train in a cultured hippocampal neuron ( ∆ F / F = −6 . 2 ± 0 . 5 % mean ± s . e . m . , n = 10 APs ) . Spontaneous bursts are rare events in cultured neurons and we made this observation only a single time in all of our recordings .

ASAP1 responses to slow low - amplitude changes were disproportionally larger than to the fast component of APs ( Fig . 4a ) ; this is expected from the relative steepness of the fluorescence response near the resting potential ( Fig . 1d ) and a slow component in the ASAP1 response ( Fig . 1e ) . To investigate ASAP1’s suitability for imaging neuronal activity over longer durations , we first determined its photobleaching time constant in neurons under continuous illumination ( 0 . 12 mW mm −2 of 470 – 490 - nm light ) as 35 . 0 ± 2 . 5 min ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . For comparison with probes we developed previously , we estimated the time over which the signal to noise ratio ( SNR ) for AP detection decays from 4 to 2 as a result of photobleaching at a fixed excitation intensity to be 49 . 1 ± 9 . 8 min ( mean ± s . e . m . , n = 4 neurons ) , longer than voltage sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) 16 . As this calculation was based on extrapolations from short recordings , we also directly tested ASAP1’s ability to monitor spon - taneous neuronal activity over longer durations . We easily detected APs in cultured neurons over 15 min of constant illumination ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Peak SNR decreased modestly from 14 . 6 ± 2 . 3 to 9 . 4 ± 1 . 3 ( n = 4 neurons from 3 litters ; paired t test , P = 0 . 047 ) , partially as a result of a 19 . 9 ± 5 . 1 % reduction in the AP response ( paired t test , P = 0 . 014 ) . The observed increase in baseline noise ( 23 . 3 ± 20 . 5 % ) did not reach statistical significance ( paired t test , P = 0 . 34 ) . These results suggest that ASAP1 has sufficient dynamic range , brightness and photostability for experiments requiring long durations . However , the magnitude of photobleaching and photodamage will likely depend on experimental conditions , such as illumination power , ASAP1 expression levels , neuron type and specimen preparation . Finally , we investigated ASAP1 performance in acute cortical slices from mouse brains transfected in utero . ASAP1 reported current - induced APs in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in single trials without filtering or averaging ( Fig . 4d ) and was able to distinguish between subthreshold depolarizations and APs . ASAP1 also reliably reported current - induced 25 - Hz AP trains in layer 2 / 3 neurons ( Fig . 4e ) , detect - ing all APs and most subthreshold depolarizations . Thus , ASAP1 is able to discriminate between subthreshold voltage changes , single APs and closely spaced APs in neurons in culture and in brain slices . DISCUSSION Despite decades of development 29 , previous voltage - sensing proteins have limitations hindering their use for high - fidelity recording of neu - ronal activity . Early sensors consisting of GFP fused to ion channels produce slow or small responses in oocytes 29 , 30 and no responses in neurons as a result of poor membrane trafficking 31 . More recent sen - sors , with fluorescent proteins fused to intracellular termini of VSDs from VSPs , show improved membrane localization and can detect voltage changes in neurons . These sensors can be divided into three main classes . In the first , a large change ( > 10 % ) in FRET between two fluorescent proteins occurs in response to depolarization , but kinetics are slow ( τ > 10 ms ) 13 , 16 . In the second class , represented by ArcLight , depolarization produces a large decrease in fluorescence of a pH - sensitive GFP fused to the VSD C terminus , but also with slow kinetics 15 . In the third class of sensor , the fluorescence of single fluorescent proteins attached to the VSD C terminus can be perturbed by voltage with small dynamic range ( < 5 % ) and sometimes with fast ( τ < 5 ms ) on 14 , 32 and / or off 32 kinetics . We designed ASAP1 with a different architecture from previous VSD - based sensors . Instead of attaching fluorescent proteins to intra - cellular locations in VSDs , we inserted cpGFP in the extracellular S3 - S4 loop of a VSD . This location enables direct coupling between conformational changes in the S3 - S4 linker and β strand 7 of cpGFP , a strand that interacts with the chromophore to stabilize its deproto - nated state . Indeed , the large and rapid responses of ASAP1 indicate that movement of the S4 helix and S3 - S4 loop in response to depolari - zation rapidly modulates protonation of the chromophore . In conclusion , ASAP1 is distinct from earlier sensors in combining efficient membrane localization , high brightness , large dynamic range and fast kinetics , enabling sensitive detection of a wide repertoire of membrane voltage responses in neurons with standard optical equip - ment . Separately , two of us ( Y . G . and M . S . ) are reporting voltage sen - sors based on FRET between a yellow or orange fluorescent protein and a rhodopsin with voltage - dependent absorption 33 . As there are differ - ences in quantitative performance metrics with ASAP1 , their respective suitability in particular experimental settings should be determined empirically . Overall , the improved properties of ASAP1 and these rhodopsin - based sensors advance the field substantially toward imag - ing fast electrical activity in neural tissue . In particular , ASAP1’s fast responses to single APs and ability to track high - frequency trains make ASAP1 an excellent sensor for AP detection and counting , either in unitary events or in rapid trains , whereas its large fluorescence changes near the resting membrane potential make it a sensitive reporter for subthreshold excitatory and inhibitory potentials . ASAP1 should facili - tate efforts to map the activity of genetically defined neurons in the brain and decode neuronal communication in time and space 34 .

Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods and verified by sequencing of all cloned fragments . ASAP1 expression plasmid and its complete sequence can be obtained via Addgene ( plasmid 52519 , www . addgene . org / 52519 ) . We constructed or obtained four circularly permuted fluorescent proteins for use in voltage sensor variants ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , d ) . First , we con - structed a circularly permuted GFP from GCaMP3 by inserting amino acids 145 - 148 ( YNSH ) of EGFP to the N terminus of cpGFP149 - 144 from plasmid pEGFP - N1 - GCaMP3 ( Addgene 22692 ) 24 . Second , we designed a circularly permuted Clover 16 GFP by alignment to cpGFP from GCaMP3 , creating new termini at original amino acid positions 145 and 144 , and linking its origi - nal N - and C - termini using the peptide ‘GGTGGS’ between the C - terminal lysine ( K239 ) and the original starting methionine . Third , we obtained cpsfGFP - OPT145 - 144 ( abbreviated as cpsfGFP - OPT ) from L . Oltrogge ( Stanford ) . cpsfGFP - OPT is a circular permutant of a superfolder GFP vari - ant ; it was evolved for use in a split GFP system , and contains seven muta - tions ( GFP1 - 10 OPT mutations ) not present in the original superfolder GFP 35 . The full sequence of cpsfGFP - OPT is provided as part of ASAP1 . Finally , we designed circularly permuted superecliptic pHluorinA227D 15 ( cpsepHluorinA227D ) by alignment to cpsfGFP - OPT , creating new termini at original amino acid positions 145 and 144 , and linking its original N - and C - termini using the peptide GTGGSAS between the C - terminal lysine ( K239 ) and a lysine originally present near its N terminus ( K4 ) . We constructed ASAP1 using the voltage - sensing domain ( VSD ) from the Gallus gallus voltage - sensitive phosphatase ( VSP , GenBank , XP _ 417079 ) . ASAP1 variants with alternate VSDs were constructed by inserting cpsfGFP - OPT imme - diately after amino acids G146 ( Xenopus laevis VSP 2 , GenBank , JF440218 ) , amino acid G147 ( Danio rerio VSD , GenBank , NM _ 001025458 ) or amino acids L203 to G214 ( Ciona intestinalis VSD , GenBank , AB183035 ) . In each case , we iso - lated the VSD from the VSP by truncating the C - terminus at homologous posi - tions : T183 ( G . gallus ) , T182 ( X . laevis ) , T183 ( D . rerio ) or S244 ( C . intestinalis ) . Besides the R153Q mutation discussed in the text , our VSDs ( generous gift of V . Pieribone , Yale University ) differ from the corresponding GenBank sequences as follows . First , G . gallus , X . laevis and D . rerio all contain an extra codon ( GAG , glutamic acid ) after the starting methionine , possibly to match expression levels of C . intestinalis VSD , whose wild - type sequence contains this codon . Second , our G . gallus has a lysine rather than glutamic acid at amino acid position 14 , while D . rerio has a proline rather than leucine at position 90 ; the effect of these differences in sequence has not been carefully examined . ArcLight Q239 ( ref . 15 ) and ASAP1 variants were cloned between the NheI - HindIII sites of pcDNA3 . 1 / Puro - CAG 16 . All variants contain identical Kozak sequences . To evaluate sensor brightness or membrane localization , we coex - pressed sensors with a fusion of mCherry with a farnesylation motif ( CAAX ) from the CAG promoter by using the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) ; a schematic of the resulting plasmids is shown in Supplementary Figure 5a . Hek293A cell culture and transfection . HEK293A cells ( Life Tech ) were main - tained in high - glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , HyClone ) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , vol / vol , Life Tech ) and 2 mM glutamine ( Sigma ) at 37 °C in air with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were plated onto glass - bottom 24 - well plates ( In vitro Scientific ) for standard imaging , or onto uncoated no . 0 12 - mm coverslips ( Glaswarenfabrik Karl Hecht GmbH ) for patch clamping experi - ments . Transfections were carried out using FuGene HD ( Promega ) according to manufacturer instructions , except that cells were transfected at ~ 50 % confluence with lower amounts of DNA ( 200 ng ) and transfection reagent ( 0 . 6 µ l ) to reduce cell toxicity . Cells were cultured for ~ 48 h before experiments were performed . Hek293A imaging without patch clamping . We used an IX81 microscope with a 60× 1 . 42 - numerical aperture ( NA ) PlanApo oil - immersion objective ( Olympus ) . Fluorescence excitation was delivered using a 120 - W Mercury vapor short arc lamp ( X - Cite 120PC , Exfo ) through a 485 / 22 - nm ( GFP ) or 545 / 30 - nm ( RFP ) filter . Fluorescence emission was passed through a 540 / 40 - nm ( GFP ) or 605 / 50 - nm ( RFP ) filter , and recorded using an Orca ER CCD ( Hamamatsu ) with Micro - Manager 36 software . Fluorescence images shown in Supplementary Figures 1 – 4 are representative images selected out of multiple fields of view . Simultaneous patch clamping and imaging of Hek293A cells . We performed patch - clamp experiments at 22 °C , using an Axopatch 700B amplifier ( Axon Instruments ) and borosilicate glass electrodes with resistances of 2 . 5 – 5 M Ω . Cells were superfused in a chamber mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope with a 40× 1 . 3 - N . A . oil - immersion objective ( Zeiss ) . Fluorescence excitation was delivered using a high - power blue light - emitting diode ( LED , UHP - MIC - LED - 460 , Pryzmatix ) through a 472 / 30 - nm filter at a power density of 0 . 4 – 5 . 2 mW mm −2 at the sample plane . Fluorescence emission was passed through a 525 / 50 - nm filter , and recorded using either an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 V2 C11440 - 22CU ( Hamamatsu ) scientific CMOS camera ( experiments for Fig . 1c , d ) , or an iXon 860 electron - multiplied charge - coupled device camera ( Andor ) cooled to −80 °C ( all other experiments ) . Unless otherwise indicated , step voltage depolarizations were applied to change the membrane potential from a holding voltage of −70 mV to voltages ranging from −120 mV to 50 mV for 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 s . For these voltage steps experiments , we captured images at 200 Hz without binning , and the fluorescence response was measured from pixels at the perimeter of the cell ( plasma membrane ) . For experiments with trains of artificial AP waveforms , we captured images at 827 Hz with 4 × 4 binning , and fluores - cence response was measured using pixels from the entire cell . The AP waveform , recorded from a hippocampal neuron , has a FWHM of 2 . 0 ms and peak amplitude of 75 mV . To measure the kinetics of ASAP1 and ArcLight Q239 , we expressed these sensors in HEK293T ( Tribioscience ) cells . Fluorescence excitation was delivered using a 488 - nm diode laser ( OBIS , Coherent ) through a 469 / 35 - nm filter at 25 – 50 mW mm 2 . Fluorescence emission was passed through a 520 / 40 - nm band - pass filter to a PMM02 photomultiplier tube ( Thorlabs ) and sampled at 5 – 10 kHz . Double - exponential models were applied to the rising and falling portions of the imaging trace during command step voltages . For all experiments , fluorescence traces were corrected for photobleaching ; electrophysiological data was recorded with Clampex ( Molecular Devices ) and fluorescence images were acquired with Solis ( Andor ) , HCImage ( Hamamatsu ) or Micro - Manager 36 . neuronal cell culture and transfection . Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the rules of the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care . Primary hippocampal neurons were dissected from Sprague - Dawley rats on embryonic day 18 and digested with 10 – 20 U ml −1 papain ( Worthington ) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS ) with 2 U µ l −1 DNaseI for 25 min at 37 °C . Neurons were then dissociated by gentle trituration in Neurobasal ( Life Tech ) with 10 % FBS . Neurons were plated at 4 × 10 4 cells cm −2 on 12 - mm no . 0 coverslips ( Glaswarenfabrik Karl Hecht GmbH ) precoated for 24 h with > 300 - kDa poly - d - lysine ( Sigma ) in water . Neurons were cultured overnight at 37 °C in air with 5 % CO 2 in Neurobasal with 1 × B27 ( Life Tech ) , 2 mM GlutaMAX ( Life Tech ) and 10 % FBS . The following day , 90 % of the medium was replaced with identical medium without FBS . Cytosine β - d - arabinofurano - side ( Sigma ) was added to 2 µ M at 5 d in vitro ( DIV ) . Neurons were transfected at 7 - 10 DIV using calcium phosphate 37 . For each well , we transfected 400 ng of sensor DNA and 1 . 1 µ g of empty pcDNA3 . 1 / Puro - CAG vector . confocal imaging of live dissociated neurons . Live neurons were imaged 2 d post - transfection in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 × B27 , 2 mM GlutaMAX , and 1 mM sodium pyruvate on an IX81 microscope with a FluoView FV1000 laser - scanning confocal unit operated using the FV10 - ASW v3 . 01 software ( Olympus ) . Fluorescence excitation was delivered using a 488 - nm laser through a 40× 1 . 3 - NA oil - immersion objective ( Olympus ) . Emission was passed through a 530 / 40 - nm emission filter . A single slice close to the bottom of the neuron was imaged using a 1 - Airy pinhole setting . Images shown in Figure 1b are representative images selected out of multiple fields of view . Antibody staining and confocal imaging of fixed dissociated neurons . DIV10 neurons were transfected with a plasmid vector expressing both ASAP1 and mCherry - CAAX ( see above and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) as described above , except that a range of plasmid concentrations was used ( 0 . 2 – 1 . 6 µ g of sensor DNA , supplemented to 1 . 6 µ g total DNA with empty pcDNA3 . 1 / Puro - CAG vector ) . 4 d post - transfection , neurons were washed in HBSS , fixed for 15 min at 22 °C with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( wt / vol ) , and washed three times with HBSS . For preparation of intact ( non - permeabilized ) neurons , we blocked nonspecific staining by incubating neurons for 30 min in blocking buffer : 5 % goat serum ( vol / vol , Life Tech ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , HyClone / Thermo Scientific ) ; © 201 4 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature neurOSCIenCe doi : 10 . 1038 / nn . 3709 neurons were then washed three times with PBS . Primary antibody staining was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GFP ( ab6556 , Abcam , 1 : 2 , 000 ) for 2 h , followed by three washes with PBS . Secondary antibody staining was per - formed with a goat antibody to rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 633 ( AF633 ) dye ( A21071 , Life Tech ) for 2 h in the dark . Multiple published studies have used ab6556 ( ref . 38 ) and A21071 ( ref . 39 ) for similar applications . Cells were washed once with PBS and twice with PBS + 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( vol / vol , Amresco ) for 20 min each time . All steps were performed at 22 °C . Permeabilized neurons were prepared as above , except that Triton X - 100 was added to the blocking and staining solutions to a final concentration of 0 . 1 % ; washes were performed iden - tically . Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield HardSet mounting medium ( H - 1400 , Vector Laboratories ) supplemented with 0 . 01 % sodium azide ( wt / vol ) . Neurons were imaged using a 40× 1 . 3 - NA oil - immersion objective on an IX81 microscope with a FluoView FV1000 laser - scanning confocal unit operated using the FV10 - ASW v3 . 01 software ( Olympus ) . mCherry - CAAX was imaged with a 559 - nm laser and a 603 / 35 - nm emission filter . ASAP1 - associated Alexa Fluor 633 was imaged with a 635 - nm laser and a 705 / 100 - nm emission filter . Images were acquired using a 1 - Airy pinhole setting and filtered with a two - pass Kalman filter . All neurons with visible membrane - localized mCherry - CAAX were selected for analysis . For each neuron and wavelength , a z stack from −3 to + 3 µ m relative to the mid - cell position was acquired , with 0 . 5 - µ m vertical spacing between slices . The slice showing the best mCherry - CAAX membrane localization was used for quantifying ASAP1 ( AF633 ) membrane localization ; this slice was typically at or close to the mid - cell position . For Supplementary Figure 5e , membrane and cytosol regions of interest were hand - drawn using the corresponding mCherry - CAAX image to identify region boundaries . Simultaneous patch clamping and imaging of dissociated neurons . 2 d post - transfection , cells were patch - clamped at 22 °C using borosilicate glass electrodes with resistances of 3 – 5 MOhm attached to an Axopatch 700B amplifier ( Axon Instruments ) . Cells were superfused with extracellular solution containing 110 mM NaCl , 26 mM sucrose , 23 mM glucose , 5 mM HEPES - Na , 5 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 and 1 . 3 mM MgSO 4 , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 . The intracellular ( pipette ) solution contained 115 mM potassium gluconate , 10 mM HEPES - Na , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM glucose , 8 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 . Cells were imaged using the same microscope , camera , filters and illumi - nation as HEK293A cells ( see above ) . Images were captured at 827 Hz ( current - induced APs ) or 417 Hz ( spontaneous APs ) with 4 × 4 binning , and fluorescence response was measured using pixels from the entire cell body . Fluorescence traces were acquired while cells were voltage clamped or current clamped in whole - cell mode . For all experiments , fluorescence traces were corrected for photobleaching . To generate APs , ~ 800 pA of current was injected for 2 ms . We discarded from future analysis neurons with resting membrane potential greater than −50 mV or membrane resistance lower than 100 MOhm . Electrode voltages and currents were recorded using pClamp ( Axon Instruments ) and analyzed using custom software written in MATLAB . Voltage traces were corrected for the junction potential post hoc . The neuron resting membrane potential was measured at I = 0 in current clamp immediately after membrane rupture . Membrane capacitance was determined by pClamp v10 ( Molecular Devices ) preset routines using the current response to 5 - mV square pulses . Photobleaching and long - term voltage sensing in dissociated neurons . Neurons were cultured and transfected as described above , but were left intact ( unpatched ) . We used an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 V2 C11440 - 22CU ( Hamamatsu ) CMOS camera ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) or an iXon 860 ( Andor ) electron - multiplied charge - coupled device camera ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) as described above , except that we used a 480 / 20 - nm excitation filter ( Chroma HQ480 / 20x ) . estimating the concentration of membrane - localized ASAP1 molecules . To obtain a coarse estimate of the number of ASAP1 molecules per µ m 2 in dis - sociated neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 6f ) , we first purified a preparation of Clover GFP 16 as previously described 40 . We then determined Clover concentra - tion in our preparation by alkali denaturation 41 . We injected dilutions of our Clover preparation into a custom polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) microfluidics device 42 . To obtain a correspondence between fluorescence and number of Clover molecules , we imaged channels of 10 - µ m depth using the microscopy system described above . We adjusted this relationship to measure ASAP1 molecules by factoring the difference in brightness between Clover and cpsfGFP - OPT 43 . We assumed that ASAP1 brightness is equivalent to cpsfGFP - OPT at the brightest point of the ∆ F / F versus V curve ( −120 mV ; Fig . 1d ) , and then factored in the difference in ASAP1 brightness between −120 mV and the resting membrane potential of approximately −70 mV . In utero electroporation , acute slice preparation and imaging . Embryos from pregnant CD - 1 mice ( Charles Rivers ) were injected with 1 – 1 . 5 µ l of 1 – 2 µ g µ l −1 ASAP1 plasmid DNA in PBS and electroporated using five 10 - ms 50 – 55 - V voltage pulses delivered at 1 Hz . At P15 – 30 , electroporated pups were anesthetized with 2 % isofluorane ( vol / vol ) , and perfused with a sucrose solution containing 234 mM sucrose , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 11 mM glucose , 10 mM MgSO 4 , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , and continuously bubbled with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . 300 - µ m slices were prepared and allowed to recover for 30 min in bubbled artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing 123 mM NaCl , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 11 mM glucose , 3 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 . Slices were placed in an imaging chamber in a customized BX - 51WI fluorescence microscope ( Olympus ) , continuously perfused with ACSF , and visualized under a 20× 1 . 0 - NA objective ( Olympus ) . Cells were illuminated with a stable LED source ( Heliophor , 89 North ) at a power density of 8 mW mm −2 or a 488 - nm diode laser ( OBIS , Coherent ) at a power density of 50 mW mm −2 . Layer 5 cortical pyramidal cells expressing ASAP1 were patch clamped , held in current - clamp mode and either monitored for spontaneous spiking or injected with 2 - to 5 - ms current pulses ( 600 – 1 , 500 pA ) to induce single spikes with minimal subthreshold contribution . Fluorescence traces were recorded at 400 Hz by an iXon DU - 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor ) . For all experiments , fluorescence traces were corrected for photobleaching . data analysis . Peak SNR was defined as the ratio of baseline - subtracted fluores - cence intensity changes and the s . d . of the baseline trace in a 500 - ms window near the AP , in regions with no apparent hyperpolarizations or subthreshold depolari - zations . T 4 → 2 is defined as the time a cell , illuminated so as to obtain an initial SNR of 4 , can be imaged before the SNR drops to 2 as previously described 16 . Assuming a reciprocal relation between excitation intensity and photobleaching time , the time to decay from an AP SNR of θ to θ / 2 is T SNRC 1 2 2 2 4 2 / ln = ( ) × × t q off where τ off is the decay time of the fluorescence transient induced by the spike . The signal - to - noise capacity ( SNRC ) is a dimensionless measure of a probe’s ability to report activity and is defined as the instantaneous peak / noise ratio of a probe integrated over all time . For an single - channel probe , SNRC is defined as SNRC 2 = ( ∆ F / F ) 2 N ( t ) τ PB , with ∆ F / F the fractional change in fluorescence to a spike , N ( t ) the rate of emission , and τ PB the photobleaching time constant . We used fluorescence traces from stimulated APs in dissociated neurons to extract the SNRC and τ off ( see above ) . Statistical methods . Results presented in the form x ± y represent the mean ± s . e . m . , unless indicated otherwise . Statistical comparisons of pre - identified measures of interest between two data sets were performed with the Student t test unless otherwise indicated . Prior to performing such statistical comparisons , the Shapiro - Wilk method was used to test the null hypothesis that the data fol - lowed a Gaussian ( normal ) distribution . When this normality hypothesis could not be rejected , Student t tests were performed ; otherwise , the Mann - Whitney U nonparametric test was used . Prior to performing t tests , we also tested the null hypothesis of equal variance between the two data sets , and employed Welch’s correction when the null hypothesis was rejected . Two - tailed tests were per - formed at significance level ( α ) of 0 . 05 . Statistical tests were performed in Excel ( Microsoft ) and MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . Except where otherwise indicated , neurons for a given experiment were from the same preparation of hippocampal neurons obtained from dissection of rats from the same litter . No statistical meth - ods were used to predetermine sample sizes , but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field .

However , as mentioned earlier , we chose cells for data collection and analysis using predefined selec - tion criteria . Furthermore , data analysis was largely performed using automated Matlab and ImageJ routines . A Supplementary methods checklist is available 38 . Watkins , R . J . et al .
