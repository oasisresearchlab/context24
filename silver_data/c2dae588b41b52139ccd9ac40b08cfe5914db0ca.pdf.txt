Both migration and formation of DC - T cell contacts depend on cytoskeleton plasticity . However , the molecular bases governing these events have not been completely defined .

PLC c 2 controls actin remodeling in dendritic cells , thereby affecting their capacity to prime T cells . DCs from PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice mature normally , however they lack podosomes , typical actin structures of motile cells . Absence of PLC c 2 impacts both DC trafficking to the lymph nodes and migration towards CCL21 . The interaction with T cells is also affected by PLC c 2 deficiency . Mechanistically , PLC c 2 is activated by CCL21 and modulates Rac activation . Rac1 / 2 2 / 2 DCs also lack podosomes and do not respond to CCL21 . Finally , antigen pulsed PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs fail to promote T cell activation and induce inflammation in vivo when injected into WT mice . Conversely , injection of WT DCs into PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice rescues the inflammatory response but not focal osteolysis , confirming the importance of PLC c 2 both in immune and bone systems . Conclusions / Significance : This study demonstrates a critical role for PLC c 2 in eliciting inflammatory responses by regulating actin dynamics in DCs and positions the PLC c 2 pathway as a common orchestrator of bone and immune cell functions during arthritis .

They are potent antigen presenting cells with the specific ability to stimulate naı¨ve T cells and control T cell responses [ 1 ] . For their T cell priming capacity , DCs actively participate in development of autoimmune condi - tions . In particular , several reports support the importance of DCs during rheumatoid arthritis , a highly inflammatory disease characterized by proliferation of synovial tissue and associated joint destruction [ 2 ] . It is generally agreed that the arthritic disease process involves abnormal presentation of self - antigens by antigen presenting cells , leading to activation of autoreactive T lympho - cytes , that are a significant component of RA pathogenesis [ 3 ] . Histological studies in patients showed that DCs cluster with T cells close to blood vessels , and presence of T cell infiltrates in the synovium are often observed [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . Furthermore , experimental animal studies have shown that DCs pulsed with collagen are able to induce autoimmune arthritis after transfer to joints [ 6 ] , suggesting that DCs play an active role during the inductive phase of inflammation . For all these reasons , a lot of efforts have been spent in trying to elucidate the mechanisms controlling DC functions , as a way to target T cell responses . DCs are activated in the periphery where they internalize and process the antigen [ 7 , 8 ] . Next , DCs migrate to the lymph nodes where they present the antigen on MHC molecules , and the process culminates with activation of reactive T cells . DC migration is ensured by presence of podosomes , adhesive structures mediating short - lived and low - affinity interactions with the substrate . Podosomes are made by a core of actin bundles surrounded by a ring of vinculin and other actin regulatory proteins [ 9 ] . They are highly dynamic structures , fast assembled PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8909 and disassembled to allow progression of the cell leading edge toward the migratory stimuli . Once DCs reach the lymph nodes , podosomes are replaced by long membrane extensions , called dendrites , which favor the interaction with potentially reactive T cells [ 5 ] . Dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton are controlled by the Rho family of small GTPases . In particular , Rac has been reported to be a critical player in cell motility in various cell types [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . Rac1 , 2 2 / 2 DCs have migratory defects in vivo and fail to induce T cell priming due to impaired interactions with T cells [ 13 ] . The signaling pathway governing Rac activation in DCs is still under investigation . Phospolipase C gamma 2 ( PLC c 2 ) , an enzyme that hydrolyzes Phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - biphosphate to generate the two second messengers inositol ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate and diacylglycerol , is implicated in actin cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts and neutrophils [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] . Importantly , PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice are protected from inflammation and consequent bone loss in the serum transfer arthritis model due to defective neutrophil activation [ 14 ] . Another consequence of PLC c 2 deficiency is decreased B cell number , while PLC c 2 2 / 2 T cells develop normally [ 17 , 18 ] , and defective osteoclast differentiation and function [ 15 , 16 ] . Interestingly , PLC c 2 activation has also been observed in DCs in response to LPS [ 19 ] , however the phenotype of PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs , including their capacity to activate T cells , remains to be elucidated . In this study we explored the contribution of PLC c 2 in DC functions as well as in the development of a T cell dependent model of arthritis in vivo . Our results indicate that PLC c 2 is involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and Rac - activation in DCs thereby modulating their trafficking to the lymph nodes and their ability to interact with T cells . Furthermore , we show that PLC c 2 is critically required for progression of autoimmune arthritis by affecting DC - mediated T cell priming and focal osteolysis by modulating osteoclast responses . Results PLC c 2 2 / 2 Mice Are Protected from mBSA - Induced Arthritis Considering the importance of PLC c 2 in B cell develop - ment , neutrophil function and osteoclastic bone resorption [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 ] , we hypothesized that PLC c 2 could be central to both the inflammatory and the osteolytic response associated with the arthritic disease . In order to define the potential role of PLC c 2 in the development of inflammatory arthritis we employed an established model of antigen - induced arthritis ( AIA ) , in which WT and PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice were immunized with methylated BSA ( mBSA ) , followed by induction of acute local inflammatory response by a single knee injection of mBSA ( or PBS as a negative control ) . Induction of arthritis in WT mice led to severe local joint inflammation , characterized by pronounced cellular infiltration and osteoclast recruitment with associated bone destruction compared to PBS control knees ( Figure 1A , B and 2A , B ) . In contrast , PLC c 2 2 / 2 animals showed no clinical signs of knee swelling , undetectable cellular infiltration or pannus formation in the joint space , and no osteoclast recruitment or bone erosion following the local injection of mBSA ( Figure 1C , D and 2A , B ) . The protection of PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice from induction of arthritis was not due to absence of mature B cells , since PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice adoptively transferred with WT B cells ( Figure S1 ) were still resistant to development of the disease ( Figure 1E , F and 2A , B ) . In line with this observation , muMT mice , which lack B cells , developed inflammation in response to mBSA and showed increase OC number and signs of bone erosion as their WT counterpart ( Figure 1G , H and 2A , B ) . T cells are the primary players during the inductive phase of inflammatory arthritis [ 21 ] . To increase our understanding of the impaired inflammatory response observed in PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice , we analyzed T cell activation after induction of the disease . Paralleling the massive cellular infiltrate observed in the mBSA injected knees of WT and muMT B cell - deficient mice , T cells isolated from inguinal lymph nodes of these animals released IL - 2 , TNF a and IFN c when restimulated in vitro with mBSA ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , mBSA - dependent production of T cell cytokines in samples from PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice or PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice adoptively transferred with WT B cells was barely detectable ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting a requirement of PLC c 2 for correct T cell activation in vivo . Importantly , PLC c 2 2 / 2 T lymphocytes can release inflammatory cytokines when activated in vitro with PMA and ionomycin ( Figure S2 ) , confirming that PLC c 2 does not directly control T cell function [ 22 , 23 ] . Thus , deletion of PLC c 2 confers protection against the development of mBSA - induced arthritis due to defective antigen - dependent T cell activation . PLC c 2 Controls Actin Organization in Mature DCs DCs are potent inducers of naı¨ve T cell responses [ 1 ] . We hypothesized that PLC c 2 might regulate T cell activation by affecting DC maturation or function . To determine if PLC c 2 was required for development of DCs , we generated WT and PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs from bone marrow precursors in the presence of GM - CSF ( Figure 3A ) . Expression of CD11c and upregulation of maturation markers ( CD80 , CD86 , CD40 ) in response to LPS stimulation were similar between WT and mutant cells ( Figure 3B ) , as well as expression of MHC I ( not shown ) and MHC II molecules ( Figure 3B ) . Morphologically , consistent with LPS - induced DC maturation , WT DCs assumed an elongated shape , with numerous filamentous membrane extensions protruding from their cell bodies ( Figure 3C top panel ) . Enrichment of podosomes , short lived dotted - like actin structures ( Figure 3D top panel ; in green ) surrounded by a ring of vinculin ( Figure 3D top panel ; in red ) , were also seen at the protruding body of WT cells . In contrast , PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs appeared larger and more round ( Figure 3C bottom panel ) . Actin staining ( in green ) revealed absence of long membrane extensions , and fewer number of abnormal podosomes ( Figure 3D bottom panel ; in green ) , lacking the external ring of vinculin ( Figure 3D bottom panel in red ) and a specific cellular localization as observed in WT DCs . Thus , while not affecting expression of DC maturation markers , PLC c 2 modulates actin reorganization in mature DCs . PLC c 2 Controls DC Migration by Affecting CCR7 Signaling and Rac Activation Podosomes are dynamic actin structures , typical feature of highly motile cells [ 9 , 24 , 25 ] . The aberrant podosome organization observed in PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs suggested a role for PLC c 2 in cell motility . To evaluate this possibility , we employed a competitive homing assay in which we coinjected a 1 : 1 mixture of differentially labeled WT ( low CFSE ) and PLC c 2 2 / 2 ( high CFSE ) DCs into the footpad of WT mice and analyzed by FACS analysis the number of cells reaching the draining popliteal lymph nodes 2 days later . Surprisingly , we observed that PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs had significantly reduced ability to reach the lymph nodes compared to WT cells ( Figure 4A and Figure S3 ) . A similar result was observed when WT DCs were labeled with high CFSE and PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs with low CFSE ( not shown ) . Signs of defective migration were also confirmed in vitro , when we monitored the chemotactic response of DCs towards CCL21 ( Figure 4B ) . While WT DCs efficiently migrated trough the pore of the transwell chamber ( 59 + / 2 17 cells / field ) , the number of migrating PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs PLC c 2 Modulates DC Functions PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8909 was about 3 fold decreased ( 16 + / 2 5 cells / field ) . Consistent with impaired migration , PLC c 2 was activated downstream of CCR7 G Protein Coupled Receptor , as activation of ERK was abolished in PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs stimulated with CCL21 ( Figure 4C ) . In line with the cytoskeletal abnormalities , activation of the small GTPase Rac was significantly dampened in PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs in response to the chemokine ( Figure 4D ) . Similarly to PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs , Rac1 , 2 2 / 2 DCs fail to migrate in response to CCL21 ( Figure 4E ) due to impaired CCR7 activation , as ERK phosphorylation in response to CCL21 was significantly dampened in the double KO Figure 1 . PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice are protected from mBSA - induced arthritis independently of B cells . WT ( A , B ) , PLC c 2 2 / 2 ( C , D ) , PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice transferred with WT B cells ( E , F ) and muMT B cell - deficient mice ( G , H ) mice were immunized with mBSA and injected intraarticularly with mBSA to induce arthritis or with PBS as a negative control . Histological sections of control PBS or mBSA injected knees were TRAP stained . Cellular infiltrates ( stars ) , osteoclasts ( red cells ) and bone erosion ( arrows ) are depicted . Images were taken using a Nikon inverted microscope and a CoolSnap camera , magnification 20 6 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008909 . g001 PLC c 2 Modulates DC Functions PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8909 cells ( Figure 4F ) . However , PLC c 2 was normally phosphorylated in Rac1 , 2 2 / 2 DCs ( Figure 4F ) , indicating that PLC c 2 modulates DC motility via Rac activation downstream of CCR7 receptor . To further explore the possibility that Rac modulates podosome organization in DCs , WT and Rac1 / 2 2 / 2 DCs matured with LPS were stained for actin and vinculin . The majority of Rac1 / 2 2 / 2 DCs lack podosomes ( 86 + / 2 2 % cells compared to only 25 + / 2 7 % cells without podosomes in WT DCs ) . Similarly to PLC c 2 deficient DCs , the few cells that display dotted - like actin structures which resemble the podosomes observed in WT cells ( Figure 4G top panels , arrow points to podosomes ) , lack the ring of vinculin surrounding the actin core ( Figure 4G bottom panels ) . PLC c 2 Is Required for DC : T Cell Interaction Podosomes are active dynamic structures involved in cell migration [ 9 , 24 , 25 ] and cell : cell interactions [ 26 ] . Once DCs reach the lymph nodes , they need to make contacts with potentially reactive T cells to initiate T cell dependent responses . In this phase a single DC can interact and activate multiple reactive T cells . Thus , we wondered if PLC c 2 was also modulating the formation of DC : T cell contacts occurring during T cell priming , a process known to be mediated by Rac [ 13 ] . To test this hypothesis , we used time - lapse video microscopy to monitor the interactions between antigen - loaded DCs with T cells . While WT DCs appeared highly dynamic , projecting numerous membrane extensions in the direction of the T cells ( Figure 5A and Movie S1 ) , PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs were poorly motile , well anchored to their initial position , and extended only few dendrites towards T cells ( Figure 5A and Movie S2 ) . The quantification of DC cell movement , as determined by nuclei displacement , clearly showed that PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs failed to move towards the surrounding T cells ( Figure 5B ) . Furthermore , lack of directional cell body Figure 2 . PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice display defective osteoclast recruitment and T cell activation in response to mBSA .

We next tested the ability of PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs to prime T cells in vitro , by culturing WT or PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs together with OT II T cells and increasing concentrations of the cognate peptide for ovalbumin . Paralleling the observation that PLC c 2 modulated DC : T cell interactions , PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs were less efficient than WT DCs in inducing T cell proliferation , as determined by CFSE dye dilution ( Figure 5D ) . PLC c 2 Modulates DC - Mediated T Cell Activation In Vivo To explore the in vivo relevance of our findings , we then analyzed the capacity of PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs to trigger a T cell response in a variant of AIA model evoked by administration of antigen - loaded DCs . Specifically , WT recipient mice were immunized with mature mBSA - pulsed WT or PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs on days 0 and 7 , followed by a local knee injection of mBSA on day 21 . In this context , only exogenously injected DCs have the ability to present the antigen to endogenous WT T cells . When WT mice were immunized with mBSA - pulsed WT DCs , they developed visible signs of arthritis . Cellular infiltrates , pannus formation and local bone erosion were visible in the mBSA injected knee , and such changes were not detected in the control knee injected with PBS ( Figure 6A , B and 7E , F ) . In contrast , development of the disease did not occur in WT mice injected with mBSA - pulsed PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs ( Figure 6C , D and 7E , F ) . Consistent with the histological findings , T cells isolated from Figure 6 . PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs fail to induce arthritis when injected into WT mice . ( A – D ) WT mice were immunized with mBSA - pulsed WT ( A , B ) or PLC c 2 2 / 2 ( C , D ) DCs followed by intraarticular injection of mBSA to induce local inflammation or PBS as a negative control . Histological analysis of mBSA - injected knee reveals insurgence of arthritis as indicated by presence of inflammatory infiltrates ( stars ) , osteoclast recruitment ( TRAP - stained red cells ) and bone erosion ( arrows ) in WT animals injected with WT but not PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs . Images were taken using a Nikon inverted microscope and a CoolSnap camera , magnification 20 6 . ( E ) Inguinal lymph nodes of mice treated as above were cultured ex vivo with mBSA ( 50 m g / ml ) for 3 days and T cell activation was determined as release of IL - 2 , TNF a and IFN c in the culture medium . Statistical significant differences are underlined by stars ( p value , 0 . 01 ) ( n = 3 ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008909 . g006 PLC c 2 Modulates DC Functions PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 8 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8909 mice immunized with PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs failed to release T H cytokines when restimulated ex - vivo with mBSA ( Figure 6E ) . Importantly , injection of WT DCs into PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice was sufficient to rescue the inflammatory response , leading to massive cellular infiltrate in the joint space ( Figure 7 ) . Confirming the previously known role of PLC c 2 as critical mediator of osteoclastic formation and function , PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice injected with WT DCs were still protected from osteoclast recruitment in the knee space and focal osteolysis ( Figure 7 ) . Collectively , these data suggest a critical role for PLC c 2 in inflammatory arthritis by affecting both DC - mediated T cell activity and osteoclastic responses . Discussion In the past decade , the focus of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) research has been to determine which cytokines and inflammatory mediators are produced at the site of disease . However , biological pharmacotherapy aimed at blocking the activity of inflammatory Figure 7 . WT DCs rescue inflammation but not focal osteolysis when injected in PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice . ( A – D ) PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice were immunized with mBSA - pulsed WT ( A , B ) or PLC c 2 2 / 2 ( C , D ) DCs followed by intraarticular injection of mBSA to induce local inflammation or PBS as a negative control . Inflammatory infiltrates in B are depicted by stars . Magnification 20 6 . ( E , F ) Histomorphometric analysis was performed on knee sections of both WT or PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice injected with WT and PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs .

We are now beginning to understand that migration of inflammatory cells into the joints and DC : T cell contacts are other important components of the disease , specifically because adhesion molecules not only modulate tissue infiltration , but also affect cell activation and cell - cell interactions . Here we have identified PLC c 2 as a critical component of the immune response associated with RA by affecting DC trafficking from peripheral tissues to the lymph nodes and DC : T cell interactions required to initiate the local inflammation via modulation of actin dynamics . Despite the well known role of PLC c 2 in B cell maturation [ 17 , 18 ] , PLC c 2 is also required for osteoclast differentiation and function [ 15 , 16 ] . Indeed , PLC c 2 deletion leads to an osteope - trotic phenotype in vivo [ 16 ] . More recently , we have also found that PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice are protected from inflammation in the serum transfer arthritis model [ 14 ] , which is primarily dependent on neutrophil recruitment and activation [ 28 ] . However , human rheumatic disease is more complex , involving multicellular responses and not only neutrophil infiltration in the joint space . We now demonstrate that PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice are also protected from development of inflammation and tissue damage in a T cell dependent model of arthritis , which more closely resembles the complex pathophysiology of the human disease . Using mBSA as antigen to induce arthritis , we found impaired T cell activation in PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice . However , T cells do not express PLC c 2 , excluding the possibility that PLC c 2 directly affects T cell function [ 22 , 23 ] . B cells , which fail to fully mature in the absence of PLC c 2 [ 17 , 18 ] , are neither the source of the defective T cell response , since WT B cell transplant into PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice failed to rescue the inflammatory response to mBSA . Additionally , muMT B cell - deficient mice could develop the arthritic disease to the same extent as WT animals . Thus , other inflammatory cells modulating T cell activation are affected by the deletion of PLC c 2 . In the complex puzzle of arthritis , DCs are known to play a crucial role as they are the most potent antigen presenting cells in T cell responses [ 29 , 30 ] . When PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs were loaded with the antigen ex vivo and injected into WT animals , they were unable to induce inflammation or support T cell activation , although similarly treated WT DCs were fully competent in the same assays . In contrast , injection of WT DCs into PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice fully restored the arthritic inflammatory response . Two distinct events modulate the capacity of DCs to regulate T cell activation : first , their ability to migrate from peripheral tissues to secondary lymphoid organs upon antigen binding , and second , the interaction with and activation of T cells in lymph nodes [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] . We found that PLC c 2 controls both events . Migration of DCs to the lymph nodes is critical for induction of T cell responses [ 4 ] . Lymph node homing of plasmacytoid DCs has been suggested to be critical for regulatory T - cell development and tolerance induction in a cardiac allograft transplant model [ 34 ] . Our data clearly show that in absence of PLC c 2 DCs fail to home to the lymph nodes and PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice do not develop inflammatory arthritis . Even in the circumstance that some PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs could reach the secondary lymphoid organs , the in vitro imaging data suggest that lack of PLC c 2 affects DC ability to extend ruffles and long dendrites towards the adjacent T cells . Consequently , PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs display defective T cell priming in vitro and ex - vivo . We cannot rule out the possibility that PLC c 2 may also play a role in additional DC functions occurring during T cell priming , such as presentation of the antigen or production of cytokines [ 19 , 35 , 36 ] that support Th cell differentiation . However , trafficking to the lymph nodes is an event that occurs in the initial phase of T cell priming and DC : T cell contacts precede T cell activation . Mechanistically , these two , albeit distinct , DC functions require active cytoskeleton rearrangements , as membrane protrusions must form to activate the migratory machinery as well as to favor cell : cell contacts . Although cell maturation occurs normally in the absence of PLC c 2 , the null cells appear larger , lack long membrane elongations that DCs form to interact with T cells , and present abnormal podosome structures , characterized by condensed actin dots not surrounded by the typical ring of vinculin . We have previously reported a role for PLC c 2 in actin dynamics in osteoclasts . PLC c 2 2 / 2 osteoclasts , like DCs , have abnormal actin cytoskeleton , as they lack the typical belt of actin which enables the cell to seal the acidic environment of the resorptive lacunae , allowing bone dissolution . As a consequence of aberrant resorption , PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice have increased bone mass in basal condition and now we show are also protected from inflammatory - induced bone loss . Similarly to the osteoclasts , we find that DCs have an abnormal podosome structure . It is not clear how PLC c 2 specifically modulates formation of podosomes , as focal contacts , more stable adhesive structures , form normally in PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs following short exposure to LPS stimulation ( Figure S4 ) . In the osteoclasts , PLC c 2 regulates c - Src activation and membrane localization and c - Src null osteoclasts lack podosomes [ 15 ] . It is possible that a similar mechanism occurs in DCs , as vinculin , a Src substrate [ 37 ] , fails to surround the podosome actin core . Lack of these highly dynamic structures can affect the capacity of the cell to rapidly rearrange the actin cytoskeleton during cell migration or cell : cell contacts . Evidence showing the importance of podosome organization in DC function comes from Wasp deficient DCs , which lack podosomes , and display trafficking defects [ 38 ] and impaired T cell activation [ 39 ] . Similarly , WASP - interacting - protein ( WIP ) deficient DCs lack the typical belt of vinculin around the actin core of the podosome , fail to polarize and form stabilized leading edges in response to chemokine gradient and consequently are poorly motile [ 25 ] . However the physiological importance of these actin - regulating molecules in DC function in a disease context in vivo has never been reported . Activation of the small Rho GTPase Rac is also essential for cell polarization and membrane protrusions at the leading edge of migratory cells [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . We now provide new evidences that Rac deficiency impairs podosome formation in LPS matured DCs . Importantly , Rac1 , 2 2 / 2 DCs have severe migratory defects and cannot extend polarized dendrites towards T cells [ 13 ] , thereby fail to promote T cell activation , similarly to what we observed in PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs . Mechanisms of Rac activation in DCs are unclear . In plasmacytoid , but not myeloid DCs , DOCK2 controls cell migration by functioning downstream of chemokine receptors and activating Rac [ 40 ] . Direct interaction between constitutively active Rac and the split pleckstrin domain of PLC c 2 has been recently described in COS cell line [ 41 ] . Indeed , we find Rac to be activated in response to the chemokine CCL21 and regulated by PLC c 2 in bone marrow derived DCs . Conversely , PLC c 2 phosphorylation is normal in Rac1 / 2 deficient DCs . Thus , our data position PLC c 2 as a critical modulator of Rac activity downstream of CCL21 receptor , CCR7 . This data are further supported by the similar morphological , functional and signaling defects observed in both PLC c 2 2 / 2 and Rac1 / 2 2 / 2 DCs . DCs constitute a unique link between innate and adaptive immunity , and their targeting during inflammatory conditions may represent a valid alternative to current therapies which are often specific for only one component of the immune response [ 27 ] . Our in vivo animal studies unequivocally support the PLC c 2 Modulates DC Functions PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8909 importance of PLC c 2 in DCs during the development of an inflammatory response associated with antigen - induced arthritis . Moreover , previous studies showed that activation of PLC c 2 in DCs occurs downstream of several immune receptors , in particular TLR4 [ 19 ] and Dectin - 1 [ 36 , 42 ] . Altogether , these data suggest that PLC c 2 is actively regulated in DCs during the course of an inflammatory response . We have previously reported that neutrophil activation is impaired in PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice [ 14 ] . Although we cannot exclude that neutrophils also participate in the development of inflamma - tion in the antigen - induced model of arthritis , the finding that injection of antigen - pulsed PLC c 2 2 / 2 DCs in WT mice is not sufficient to initiate the inflammatory disease , highlights the importance of DC motility and actin dynamics during DC - mediated activation of T cell responses . In agreement with this posture , injection of WT DCs in PLC c 2 2 / 2 mice rescues inflammation , however bone resorption is still impaired . Focal osteolysis is a deleterious consequence of arthritic inflammatory conditions , reflected as bone pain , periarticular and appendicular osteopenia , and impaired mobility . Here we provide evidences that PLC c 2 modulates bone loss independent from inflammation . While our prior investigation has revealed a role for PLC c 2 in osteoclast formation and function under basal condition , now we prove that this holds true even in the context of an inflammatory condition known to be favorable for osteoclastic recruitment . In summary , the importance of PLC c 2 in osteoclasts [ 15 , 16 ] and neutrophils [ 14 , 20 ] , in conjunction with its role in DC - mediated T cell activation here discussed , positions the molecule as a point of convergence between bone and immune systems in complex pathologies such as RA and other autoimmune diseases characterized by an interplay between bone and immune cells .
