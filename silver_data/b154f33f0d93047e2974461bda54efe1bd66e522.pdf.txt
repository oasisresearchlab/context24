To understand how 31 this CLC diversity influences neuronal clathrin function , we characterised the biophysical 32 properties of clathrin comprising individual CLC variants for correlation with neuronal 33 phenotypes of mice lacking either CLC - encoding gene . CLC splice variants differentially 34 influenced clathrin knee conformation within assemblies , and clathrin with neuronal CLC 35 mixtures was more effective in membrane deformation than clathrin with single neuronal 36 isoforms nCLCa or nCLCb . Correspondingly , electrophysiological recordings revealed that 37 neurons from mice lacking nCLCa or nCLCb were both defective in synaptic vesicle 38 replenishment . Mice with only nCLCb had a reduced synaptic vesicle pool and impaired 39 neurotransmission compared to wild - type mice , while nCLCa - only mice had increased 40 synaptic vesicle numbers , restoring normal neurotransmission . These findings highlight 41 differences between the CLC isoforms and show that isoform mixing influences tissue - 42 specific clathrin activity in neurons , which requires their functional balance . 43 44 KEY WORDS 45 Clathrin , membrane traffic , coated vesicle formation , protein isoforms , neuronal synapse 46 47 3 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 48 49 This study reveals that diversity of clathrin light chain ( CLC ) subunits alters clathrin 50 properties and demonstrates that the two neuronal CLC subunits work together for optimal 51 clathrin function in synaptic vesicle formation . Our findings establish a role for CLC diversity 52 in synaptic transmission and illustrate how CLC variability expands the complexity of clathrin 53 to serve tissue - specific functions . 54 55 4 INTRODUCTION 56 57 Clathrin mediates vesicle formation from the plasma membrane and endosomal 58 compartments ( 1 ) . Recruited by cargo - recognising adaptor proteins , triskelion - shaped 59 clathrin proteins assemble into polyhedral lattices to capture membrane - associated cargo 60 and promote membrane bending into clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . Through sequestration 61 of a variety of cargo , CCVs play fundamental roles in general cellular physiology including 62 regulation of nutrient uptake and signalling , as well as in tissue - specific membrane traffic 63 such as synaptic vesicle ( SV ) generation ( 2 ) . This range of clathrin functions has been 64 attributed to adaptor and accessory protein variation ( 3 ) . However , functional diversity is also 65 generated by variability of clathrin subunits . Vertebrates have two types of clathrin heavy 66 chains with distinct functions ( 4 ) . The major vertebrate clathrin is formed from clathrin heavy 67 chain CHC17 ( herein referred to as CHC ) associated with clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) , which 68 do not bind the minor CHC22 clathrin isoform . Vertebrate CLCs are encoded by two different 69 genes CLTA and CLTB ( in humans ) , producing CLCa and CLCb isoforms of about 60 % 70 sequence identity ( 5 , 6 ) . Their sequence differences have been conserved during evolution , 71 after the encoding genes arose through duplication , suggesting the two isoforms can mediate 72 distinct functions ( 7 , 8 ) . Expression levels of the CLCa and CLCb isoforms are tissue - specific 73 ( 9 ) , and further variation is created by alternative gene splicing during development ( 10 ) and 74 in brain ( 5 , 6 ) . Here we address how CLC diversity affects the biophysical properties of 75 clathrin and how the resulting variation affects the specialised function of clathrin in synaptic 76 vesicle ( SV ) replenishment . 77 78 Limited functional differences between CLCa and CLCb have been observed in cell culture 79 with respect to clathrin dynamics ( 11 ) , during focal adhesion formation ( 12 ) , cancer cell 80 migration ( 13 ) and in epithelial polarity ( 14 ) , with mechanisms attributed to isoform - specific 81 differences in CLC binding proteins and post - translational modification ( 15 ) . Loss of CLCs in 82 5 culture and in vivo affects CCV uptake of some , but not all cargo , possibly reflecting 83 variability in mechanical demand for packaging different cargo into CCVs ( 9 , 15 , 16 ) . The 84 capacity for biophysical differences in clathrin comprising different CLC isoforms and their 85 splicing variants to influence tissue - specific clathrin functions has not yet been considered . 86 CLC variability has potential to affect clathrin function as CLCs interact with key domains of 87 the clathrin triskelion that contribute to clathrin - mediated membrane bending . They bind the 88 trimerisation domain ( TxD ) of the triskelion vertex where the three component CHCs interact 89 ( 17 , 18 ) , and extend along the triskelion leg to the bend at the knee where CLCs regulate 90 conformation ( 19 ) . Like various other endocytic proteins ( 3 ) , CLCs undergo neuron - specific 91 splicing ( 20 ) , which introduces one exon in CLCb ( encoding 18 residues ) and two exons 92 ( encoding 30 residues ) in CLCa at equivalent positions near the CLC C - termini , resulting in 93 higher molecular weight forms nCLCb and nCLCa ( 5 , 6 ) , suggesting neuron - specific 94 functions for these variants . In vitro , CLCs are required for efficient clathrin - mediated 95 membrane vesiculation at low temperature ( 21 ) . Thus , CLCs could affect clathrin - mediated 96 membrane deformation directly through their influence on clathrin lattice properties ( 21 , 22 ) , 97 as well as indirectly through cellular interaction with proteins that influence the actin 98 cytoskeleton ( 14 , 23 - 25 ) . 99 100 SV replenishment by membrane traffic following neuronal degranulation is critical for 101 sustained neurotransmission . Endocytosis is required to regulate synaptic plasma membrane 102 surface area and to retrieve SV proteins ( 26 ) , and SVs are generated from the plasma 103 membrane and endosome - like compartments ( 27 ) . The essential sites of clathrin function in 104 these pathways are debated ( 2 , 28 ) , but dysfunction of clathrin - associated endocytic proteins 105 is associated with neurological defects observed in Parkinson’s disease ( 29 ) , Alzheimer’s 106 disease ( 3 ) and in numerous animal models in which such proteins have been genetically 107 deleted ( 30 - 35 ) . 108 109 6 Here , we assess how clathrin lattices formed with neuronal and non - neuronal CLC variants 110 could differentially affect function by correlating their in vitro biophysical properties with in 111 vivo neuronal phenotypes of mice lacking CLC - encoding genes . We found that CLC 112 composition significantly influenced clathrin lattice properties and the ability to form vesicles . 113 CLC splice variation impacted assembly curvature by regulating CHC knee conformation , 114 resulting in decreased ability of individual neuronal splice variants to deform liposome 115 membrane in vitro . This effect was ameliorated for lattices formed from a mixture of neuronal 116 CLC isoforms . Mice lacking either CLCa or CLCb isoforms showed corresponding 117 differences in SV replenishment and synaptic neurotransmission compared to their wild - type 118 ( WT ) littermates expressing both isoforms , and to each other . Collectively , these functional 119 differences between CLC isoforms observed in vitro and in vivo establish a role for CLC 120 diversity in regulating clathrin function in neurons and suggest a critical role for isoform 121 balance . 122 123 7 RESULTS 124 125 CLC splice variants differentially influence lattice curvature via the triskelion knee 126 Within clathrin lattices , the knee bending angle determines whether a hexagon ( non - 127 curvature inducing ) or pentagon ( curvature - inducing ) is formed ( 36 , 37 ) . In addition , the 128 characteristic pucker at the triskelion vertex and the crossing angle of interacting CHC legs 129 can further modulate lattice curvature ( 38 , 39 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . This versatility of clathrin assemblies 130 allows clathrin to sequester cargo of various sizes as well as to form stable , flat assemblies 131 that serve as signalling hubs ( 3 , 40 ) . For each closed cage , there is a fixed number of 12 132 pentagons , but a varying number of hexagons ( 41 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Thus , larger cages ( i . e . lattices 133 of lower curvature ) have a smaller pentagon to hexagon ratio . CLCs maintain the puckered 134 conformation of triskelia in flat assemblies ( 21 ) and structural studies showed that nCLCb 135 can influence conformation of the triskelion knee up to a degree that inhibits assembly ( 19 ) . 136 Considering these effects on CHCs , we hypothesized that sequence differences between the 137 CLC isoforms and alterations due to splicing might modulate CLC influence on triskelion 138 conformation and lattice curvature . 139 140 To address this , we produced clathrin triskelia of defined CLC composition by reconstituting 141 tissue - derived CHC triskelia ( 42 ) with recombinantly expressed CLCa , CLCb , nCLCa or 142 nCLCb ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1a - d ) . We then induced assembly of these different clathrins into 143 closed cages and analysed cage diameter as a measure of lattice curvature by electron 144 microscopy . Previous studies showed that tissue - derived , CLC - bound clathrin ( native ) forms 145 two major size classes , while CHC - only triskelia predominantly form small - sized cages ( 43 - 146 46 ) . Our results confirmed that without CLCs , CHC formed predominantly cages of less than 147 90 nm in diameter with an average size of around 70 nm , representing cages of up to 60 148 triskelia ( 45 ) . Clathrin with each of the CLC variants was further able to form larger cages 149 with an average diameter of around 110 nm ( 140 triskelia ) for those cages . The degree to 150 8 which larger cages were formed varied significantly between splice variants ( Fig . 1b , c ) , 151 indicating that the neuronal splice inserts regulate the influence of CLCs on lattice curvature . 152 153 To establish whether differences in larger cage formation resulted from CLC influence on the 154 triskelion vertex or on the CHC knee conformation or both , we dissected the effect of CLCs 155 separately for each domain . To test whether CLC diversity exerts influence through varying 156 CHC knee conformation , we produced clathrin cages from two CHC fragments that together 157 constitute a full - length clathrin triskelion “cut” at the knee ( Fig . 1d ) ( 47 ) . The Hub fragment 158 ( residues 1074 - 1675 ) was reconstituted with different CLCs ( 48 ) and combined with the 159 terminal - distal leg segment ( TDD , residues 1 - 1074 , SI Appendix , Fig . S1e ) under conditions 160 promoting their co - assembly ( 47 ) . Cages produced when TDD was combined with CLC - 161 reconstituted Hub fragments were similar in size to fragment cages without CLCs , and the 162 larger cages observed for CLC variants associated with intact CHC did not form ( Fig . 1d , e ) . 163 This result demonstrates that for CLC diversity to exert an effect on lattice curvature , the 164 CHC knee must be intact , and shows that CLC splice variants differ in their influence on CHC 165 knee conformation . Formation of larger cages by neuronal CLCs suggests that the neuronal 166 splice inserts restrict the conformational flexibility of the CHC knee and could thereby reduce 167 the likelihood of pentagon over hexagon formation . Non - neuronal CLCs appear to support a 168 less biased variety of knee conformations , as cages of the two size classes are observed at 169 almost equal frequency ( Fig . 1b , c ) . To establish whether cage size differences also 170 correlated with CLC effects at the TxD , the different CLCs were compared for their ability to 171 stabilise the TxD ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) in an assay that measures triskelion dissociation . 172 While dissociation differences were observed between triskelia reconstituted with the 173 different CLC isoforms and their splice variants , these effects did not correlate with cage size 174 differences , suggesting that CLC influence at the vertex is not a major factor in lattice 175 curvature . 176 177 178 9 CLC diversity modulates mechanical properties of the clathrin lattice 179 We next investigated whether the influence of CLCs on the CHC knee had mechanical 180 consequences for their ability to support membrane deformation . Mechanical properties of 181 clathrin lattices were previously shown to be CLC - dependent and reduced ability of CLC - free 182 clathrin to bend membranes in vitro was correlated with reduced planar lattice quality when 183 assembled on an electron microscopy ( EM ) grid ( 21 ) . To establish whether CLC diversity 184 influences lattice quality in the same assay , clathrins with different CLC composition were 185 assembled on EM grids coated with a clathrin - binding fragment of epsin1 ( H 6 - Δ ENTH - 186 epsin 144 - 575 , SI Appendix , Fig . S1f ) ( 49 ) . The flat lattices formed were visualized by EM and 187 their periodicity ( quality ) assessed by Fourier transform analysis . Lattice quality was 188 significantly reduced for clathrin with the neuronal splice variants of either CLCa or CLCb 189 compared to clathrin reconstituted with their respective non - neuronal variants , and was 190 significantly improved if formed from a 1 : 1 mix of nCLCa clathrin and nCLCb clathrin ( Fig . 2 ) . 191 To visualise the nature of CLC distribution in these mixtures , lattices were generated using 192 His - tagged nCLCa clathrin or nCLCb clathrin combined with the cognate untagged CLC and 193 labelled with Ni - NTA - gold ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) , confirming a uniform distribution of each 194 neuronal CLC within the mixed lattice . In contrast to the behaviour of the neuronal CLCs , 195 lattice quality was reduced in mixtures of CLCa clathrin and CLCb clathrin compared to 196 lattices formed by clathrin with only CLCa or CLCb . 197 198 To determine whether CLC - related variation in lattice quality correlated with membrane 199 bending efficacy , as seen for complete absence of CLCs , we tested the function of the CLC - 200 reconstituted clathrins using a low temperature in vitro budding assay ( 21 ) . In this assay , H 6 - 201 Δ ENTH - epsin 144 - 575 , coupled to liposomes via modified Ni - NTA lipids , captures clathrin at the 202 liposome surface . Lattice assembly on these liposomes can generate mature buds , which 203 remain attached to the liposome due to lack of dynamin , needed for scission ( 21 , 49 ) . The 204 efficiency of clathrin with different CLC composition to form such coated buds was assessed 205 at 15°C , a temperature permissive for budding by native clathrin but reduced for CLC - free 206 10 clathrin ( 21 ) . For each reconstituted clathrin , we measured the diameter of clathrin - coated 207 membrane profiles in thin - section electron micrographs and assessed budding efficiency by 208 the percentage of mature clathrin - coated buds ( defined by a fitted diameter < 200 nm ) 209 relative to the total clathrin - coated membrane observed including shallow pits and flat clathrin 210 assemblies ( defined by a fitted diameter > 200 nm ) ( Fig . 3a ) . In line with previous findings , 211 we found that at 15°C native clathrin was about twice as effective in membrane deformation 212 as CLC - free clathrin ( 21 ) , and that budding efficiency varied with the CLC composition of 213 clathrin tested ( Fig . 3b ) . CLCa or CLCb clathrin lattices generated mature membrane buds 214 more efficiently than clathrin with either single neuronal clathrin variant ( Fig . 3b , c ) , 215 demonstrating that CLC splicing affects budding . Visualising the clathrin - coated liposomes 216 absorbed to EM grids confirmed that all clathrins tested assembled into intact lattices or buds 217 on the liposome surface ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) , suggesting that the observed variation in 218 budding was not due to impaired lattice formation , but CLC - dependent lattice properties ( 21 ) . 219 Notably , mixing reconstituted neuronal clathrins significantly improved budding efficiency 220 compared to clathrins with only one type of neuronal CLC ( Fig . 3d ) , overall reflecting the 221 same pattern as observed for both lattice quality and curvature ( Table 1 ) , suggesting all three 222 parameters result from differential CLC effects at the triskelion knee . Furthermore , all three 223 assays demonstrated that neuronal clathrin benefits from cooperative co - assembly of clathrin 224 with both isoforms . 225 226 Membrane deformation could result either from lattice formation at constant curvature or 227 through transitioning from flat to curved lattices ( Fig . 3e ) . Morphological analyses of clathrin - 228 coated pits in human cell lines suggest that clathrin initially assembles into flat lattices at the 229 plasma membrane and then gradually deforms the underlying membrane into coated buds 230 ( 50 , 51 ) . To determine whether clathrin displayed these budding characteristics in our in vitro 231 system and whether they are influenced by CLCs , we adopted the same EM - based 232 approach . In micrographs of clathrin buds formed on liposomes , we measured the angle 233 between the convex side of the coat and the coat - free membrane ( Fig . 3e ) , coat curvature 234 11 ( i . e . diameter of the clathrin - coated structure ) , coat length and neck width for all coated 235 membrane profiles ( 50 ) and then correlated these measurements . We observed a variety of 236 coat curvatures ( Fig . 3f ) and found that neck width decreased with bud angle ( Fig . 3g ) , as 237 would be expected for both modes of deformation . Additionally , coat diameter correlated with 238 the bud angle , characteristic of curvature transition ( Fig . 3h ) , while we found no correlation 239 between coat length and budding angle ( Fig . 3i ) . Although this analysis is based on fixed 240 structures at equilibrium , results were consistent with a flat to curved lattice transition , rather 241 than assembly with constant curvature ( Fig . 3h , i ) . Thus , we conclude that budding in our in 242 vitro system displays the same characteristics as observed in cells ( 50 , 51 ) , where curvature 243 is most likely generated gradually through lattice rearrangement . Collectively , our results 244 suggest that CLC splice variants and mixtures thereof differ in their ability to promote this 245 transition and that this is due to variable restrictive influence on the flexibility of the triskelion 246 knee within the lattice , which in turn affects clathrin’s mechanical ability to deform membrane 247 into coated buds ( Table 1 ) . 248 249 CLC composition affects SV pool size and replenishment 250 Our in vitro experiments suggest that the CLCs differentially affect clathrin’s ability to deform 251 membrane , with the neuronal isoforms working in conjunction for efficient membrane 252 budding . Therefore , we predicted that neurons of animals with only one CLC isoform might 253 be defective in clathrin - mediated pathways that rely on SV formation . This hypothesis was 254 investigated in knock - out ( KO ) mice lacking the Clta or Cltb genes in all tissues ( CLCa KO 255 and CLCb KO mice ) . We previously generated CLCa KO mice ( 9 ) and have now produced 256 CLCb KO mice . Loss of Cltb in CLCb KO mice was confirmed by PCR , and no CLCb or 257 nCLCb protein was detected in all tissues analysed ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 ) . Whereas wild - 258 type ( WT ) mice express a mixture of CLCs in most tissues ( 9 ) , CLCa KO mice express only 259 CLCb or nCLCb , and CLCb KO mice express only CLCa or nCLCa , enabling functional 260 analysis of clathrin with only one type of CLC in neurons ( Fig . 4a ) . 261 262 12 Hippocampal neurons have frequently been used to study the function of endocytic proteins 263 in synaptic transmission ( 27 , 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 52 ) . H & E staining of the hippocampus showed 264 no morphological abnormalities in either KO strain , indicating that absence of either CLC 265 isoform does not affect gross hippocampus development in the CLC KO mice ( SI Appendix , 266 Fig . S6 ) . We therefore analysed the adult hippocampus in the CLC KO and WT mice to 267 evaluate the function of mature excitatory synapses in the CA1 region , a region of well - 268 defined neuronal architecture and neurophysiological circuitry . For electrophysiological 269 recordings at Schaffer collateral ( SC ) - CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices , a 270 stimulating electrode was placed in the SC fibres of the CA3 region and responses were then 271 recorded in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer ( Fig . 4b ) . 272 273 To determine the role of CLC diversity in SV pool replenishment in vivo , we recorded the 274 responses to a prolonged high - frequency stimulus , which maximally depletes presynaptic 275 terminals of the readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of SVs ( 53 - 55 ) . Under these conditions , initial 276 responses would draw from the pre - existing SV pool , while sustained neurotransmission 277 would rely on the efficiency of SV pool replenishment ( 54 ) . Using this approach , we were 278 able to assess CLC - dependency for different stages of SV exo - and endocytosis from these 279 recordings . We found that the initial fusion efficiency of SVs in either KO strain was similar to 280 that of their WT littermates , indicating that packaging of fusion - mediating cargo was not 281 affected by changes in CLC composition ( Fig . 4c , d and SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . Instead , both 282 KO models had a decreased SV recycling rate characteristic of a defect in acute SV pool 283 replenishment ( Fig . 4c , d and SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . This finding correlated with our 284 expectation from the in vitro studies that showed clathrin lattices with only one type of 285 neuronal CLC were different from mixed lattices in their assembly properties ( Table 1 ) . 286 287 Further calculations based on data obtained from sustained trains of action potentials 288 indicated that the RRP was larger in the CLCb KO mice but reduced in the CLCa KO mice 289 when compared to WT littermates ( Fig . 4c , d and SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) , revealing a 290 13 phenotype that we did not expect from our in vitro data . To establish whether the SV 291 formation was altered in the CLC KO mice rather than the ability to mobilise SVs from other 292 SV pools , we assessed the ultrastructure of excitatory synapses in the CLC KO mice and 293 their WT littermates ( Fig . 4e ) . Indeed , SV density was significantly reduced in hippocampal 294 neurons in the CLCa KO animals . In contrast , SV density in equivalent neurons of the CLCb 295 KO mice was significantly increased compared to their WT littermates ( Fig . 4f , j ) , in line with 296 our RRP estimates from electrophysiological recordings ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Other parameters such 297 as individual SV size ( Fig . 4g , k ) , postsynaptic density ( PSD ) length ( Fig . 4h , l ) and excitatory 298 synapse density ( Fig . 4i , m ) were similar between both KO strains and respective WT 299 littermates . Together , these data show that CLCs are required for efficient and sustained 300 synaptic function and suggest that loss of either CLC decreases acute SV replenishment by 301 affecting immediate formation , correlating with expectations from reduced in vitro budding 302 efficiency , but that the KO strains differ in their ability to generally maintain SV pools . Thus , 303 CLC composition influences SV density in excitatory neurons of the hippocampus , and 304 nCLCa and nCLCb function differently in SV generation such that mice with only nCLCa can 305 sustain a compensatory pathway for SV generation and mice with only nCLCb cannot . 306 307 CLCa KO and CLCb KO mice have distinct neurological and behavioural defects 308 To further investigate the differential consequences of CLCa or CLCb KO for synapse 309 function , we conducted additional electrophysiological experiments to characterise synaptic 310 transmission in our KO animals . Analyses of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current 311 ( EPSC ) responses to stimuli of increasing magnitude revealed decreased EPSC response 312 amplitude in the CLCa KO mice compared to WT littermates , suggesting impaired basal 313 synaptic transmission in the CLCa KO mice ( Fig . 5a ) . In contrast , the evoked EPSC 314 response amplitude in hippocampal slices from the CLCb KO mice was of similar or higher 315 magnitude than that of their WT littermates , suggesting that basal synaptic transmission was 316 intact and even enhanced ( Fig . 5b ) . These differences in synaptic connectivity between 317 hippocampal function in the two KO strains could arise from defects in presynaptic 318 14 neurotransmitter release correlating with differences in SV pool size in the KO animals 319 relative to their WT littermates ( Fig . 4 ) . 320 321 We then performed paired - pulse ratio ( PPR ) recordings experiments , an approach that 322 allows assessment of defects in neurotransmitter release ( 56 , 57 ) . In excitatory neurons such 323 as those analysed here , a second stimulus pulse ( P 2 ) fired in short succession after an initial 324 pulse ( P 1 ) results in a larger response than the first stimulus . This facilitation is dependent on 325 changes in the probability of neurotransmitter release . PPR is inversely correlated with 326 release probability , as a lower initial release probability leaves more vesicles remaining at the 327 terminal which are then capable of being released after the second stimulus ( 56 , 57 ) . We 328 observed that , compared to WT littermates , the PPR was increased in CLCa KO mice , 329 consistent with a reduction in release probability ( Fig . 5c ) . In contrast , no differences in PPR 330 were observed in CLCb KO mice compared to WT littermates ( Fig . 5d ) . Thus , specific loss of 331 nCLCa impairs presynaptic function compromising neurotransmitter release at the SC - CA1 332 synapse . Collectively , our electrophysiological data support the morphological data ( Fig . 4e - 333 m ) , indicating that neurons with only nCLCa clathrin can compensate for defective SV 334 regeneration by expanding their SV pool from another pathway , while neurons with only 335 nCLCb clathrin cannot compensate and show decimated SV pools from impaired 336 replenishment . 337 338 Ongoing breeding of the CLCa KO colony confirmed a 50 % survival rate compared to that 339 expected for homozygous CLCa KO mice ( 9 ) , whereas homozygous CLCb KO mice had no 340 survival defects ( Fig . 5e ) . Survival phenotypes similar to the CLCa KO animals have been 341 reported for other genetic deletions in endocytic pathways , which also displayed neuronal 342 phenotypes ( 30 ) in the hippocampus and other regions of the brain ( 32 ) . Therefore , we 343 assessed performance in the rotarod test for neuro - motor coordination for both CLC KO mice 344 ( 58 ) . Compared to their WT littermates , surviving CLCa KO mice displayed defects in rotarod 345 balance , whereas CLCb KO mice did not ( Fig . 5f ) . Further assessment of sensorimotor 346 15 function revealed that CLCa KO mice exhibited defects in a grid - walking test ( Fig . 5g ) , but 347 not in grip strength ( Fig . 5h ) , suggesting neurological rather than muscular dysfunction in the 348 CLCa KO animals , supporting the notion that loss of nCLCa is less tolerable than loss of 349 nCLCb . Together , the phenotypes of the KO animals indicate that neuronal CLC isoforms are 350 differentially able to support compensatory mechanisms for adjusting SV pools hippocampal 351 synapses with impaired acute SV replenishment , and suggest that clathrin with only nCLCa 352 enables more functions than clathrin with only nCLCb , while a mix of both neuronal CLCs is 353 necessary for optimal clathrin function in neurons , in keeping with their synergistic 354 contribution to clathrin function in vitro . 355 356 16 DISCUSSION 357 358 To understand the consequences of CLC diversity for clathrin function , we characterised the 359 biophysical properties of in vitro assemblies formed from clathrin comprising single CLC 360 isoforms and correlated these properties with neuronal phenotypes observed in KO animals 361 expressing single CLC isoforms . We found that neuronal CLC splicing affects lattice 362 properties ( Fig . 1b and Fig . 2b ) by diversifying the CLC influence on the CHC knee to 363 regulate lattice curvature ( Fig . 1c , d ) and deform membrane ( Fig . 3b ) . Our in vitro studies 364 further suggest that lattices formed from mixtures of clathrin with nCLCa and nCLCb have 365 different assembly properties and are more efficient in membrane deformation compared to 366 clathrin with only one type of neuronal CLC ( Fig . 2b , 3d ) . Consistent with this observation , 367 neurons from both CLCa and CLCb KO mice showed defects in synaptic transmission that 368 indicated acute clathrin - dependent SV replenishment was impaired ( Fig . 4c , d ) . However , the 369 CLCa KO mice had reduced numbers of SVs in their hippocampal synapses , while the CLCb 370 KO mice had more SVs than their WT littermates ( Fig . 4f , j ) . Thus , although acute SV 371 replenishment was impaired in both KO strains , clathrin with only nCLCa ( in the CLCb KO 372 mice ) was able to support a compensatory pathway of SV formation , while clathrin with only 373 nCLCb ( in the CLCa KO ) was not ( Fig . 5a - d ) . These findings establish functional differences 374 between CLC isoforms in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate how resulting clathrin diversity , 375 as well as CLC isoform balance , are important for clathrin function in neurons . 376 377 Neuronal splicing predominates for CLCb in neurons ( 59 ) , while neuronal CLCs are not 378 present in other brain cells such as glial or Schwann cells ( 20 ) , indicating that the CLC splice 379 variants segregate within brain cell types to fulfil distinct functions . Neuronal CLC variation 380 due to splicing had a significant influence on lattice curvature and budding efficiency . 381 Compared to clathrin with non - neuronal CLCs , clathrin with neuronal CLCs formed 382 predominantly large cages in solution ( with low a pentagon to hexagon ratio ) , suggesting that 383 through their influence on the CHC knee ( Fig 1d ) , the spliced inserts reduce triskelion 384 17 flexibility to accommodate pentagonal faces . When constrained to a flat , solid surface ( EM 385 grid ) , lattice assembly requires significant deformation of triskelia ( 21 ) . The quality of lattices 386 formed by clathrin with neuronal CLCs under these conditions was reduced compared to 387 clathrin with non - neuronal CLCs , further suggesting that neuronal CLCs restrict clathrin’s 388 conformational flexibility . Notably , CLC - dependent lattice quality and cage size correlated 389 with the ability of clathrin with different CLCs to produce mature buds at liposome 390 membranes , which morphological analysis suggested are generated by flat lattice 391 rearrangement , as observed at cell membranes ( 50 , 51 ) . Together , these results suggest 392 that CLC splicing variation influences clathrin’s flexibility to form and alternate between a 393 range of morphologies in order to deform lipid membrane into mature clathrin - coated buds , 394 and that this is attributable to CLC influence on the CHC knee domain . 395 396 Given that the inserted sequences are located near the TxD where the C - termini of CLCs are 397 bound ( arrowheads , Fig . 6a ) , we propose that the splice inserts affect the conformation of the 398 adjacent knee of a neighbouring triskelion , which is closer to the inserted sequences than the 399 knee of the triskelion to which the CLC is bound ( Fig . 6b ) . This intermolecular influence could 400 involve splice inserts at the C - terminus ( stars , Fig . 6b ) interacting with the neighbouring CHC 401 knee or with the N - terminal domain ( N ) of a CLC bound to the neighbouring knee ( Fig . 6b ) . 402 Considering the average 40 % sequence differences between CLCa and CLCb isoforms and 403 their even greater variation at the N - terminus , inter - CLC interactions could vary depending 404 on which splice isoform interacts with which CLC isoform N - terminus , thereby influencing 405 overall lattice properties . This imputed interaction may be lost from clathrin with non - neuronal 406 CLCs , which would explain why mixing non - neuronal CLC isoforms does not affect in vitro 407 membrane deformation to the same extent as mixing neuronal CLC isoforms ( Fig . 3d ) . 408 409 Here , we characterise the properties of homo - and hetero - assemblies of clathrin comprising 410 single CLC isoforms . In brain , CLC isoforms are apparently randomly distributed on triskelia 411 ( 60 ) , in which case neuronal inserted sequences could still influence lattice curvature via 412 18 interactions with an adjacent triskelion knee . The presence of nCLCb would serve as an 413 attenuator of nCLCa - specific interactions and vice versa . Further , in cells where CLCb 414 expression is transiently increased ( 61 ) , newly synthesized triskelia would be generally 415 occupied by a single CLC isoform as clathrin subunit turnover is slow ( 62 ) . The resulting 416 homotypic clathrins would then participate mixed in lattices , as we have studied here . Thus , 417 neuronal CLC isoform expression ratios ( and / or local abundance within cells ) could tailor 418 clathrin lattice properties specifically to particular needs . 419 420 There are several pathways involved in SV recycling in neurons and the role of clathrin has 421 been widely debated , possibly because the contribution of each pathway to SV formation is 422 variable between organisms , types of neurons and stimulus ( 52 , 63 , 64 ) . SV recycling can 423 either be achieved by direct regeneration of SVs through clathrin - mediated endocytosis from 424 the plasma membrane at low - frequency stimulus , or through clathrin - independent 425 mechanisms , which predominantly mediate retrieval of SV components from the plasma 426 membrane under high stimulus ( 2 , 27 , 28 , 33 , 52 ) . Rapid clathrin - dependent trafficking of SV 427 proteins from the endosomal pathway then leads to re - sorting and formation of SVs at high - 428 frequency stimulus ( 2 ) , which can occur in a timeframe of 1 - 3 seconds after stimulation ( 27 ) . 429 In our analysis of neurotransmission , SV recycling defects were detected by 430 electrophysiology within three seconds at high stimulus ( 20 Hz for 3s ) , suggesting the 431 defects detected were due to impaired clathrin - mediated regeneration of SVs from the 432 endosomal pathway . These findings are consistent with previously observed roles for CLCs 433 in recycling from non - neuronal endosomal compartments ( 61 , 65 ) . 434 435 That neurons in both CLC KO strains shared an acute defect in SV pool replenishment fits 436 with our in vitro biophysical data that demonstrate single neuronal CLCs are not as efficient 437 in membrane deformation as a mixture of clathrin with both neuronal CLCs ( Fig . 3d ) . In 438 response to this defect , we found that clathrin with only nCLCa generated an increased 439 steady - state SV pool in CLCb KO neurons , while clathrin with only nCLCb could not ( Fig . 4 ) . 440 19 CLCa seems to have preferential connection with the actin cytoskeleton compared to CLCb 441 ( 12 , 14 ) , which might account for the ability of nCLCa clathrin to function on its own without 442 nCLCb and benefit from involvement of actin and its accessory molecules in this 443 compensatory pathway . It is possible that in the ( normal ) presence of nCLCb , the actin 444 interactions of nCLCa may be “diluted down” , so that nCLCb works as an attenuating 445 balancing mechanism to control SV pools at steady state . The presence of nCLCb would 446 simultaneously create lattice properties for efficient CCV budding during neurotransmission . 447 In its absence , the acute replenishment pathway would decrease in efficiency but loss of the 448 nCLCb attenuation effect enables a compensatory pathway with nCLCa only ( Fig . 6c ) . Thus , 449 the budding defect resulting from a change in biophysical properties of clathrin is detectable 450 only under acute demand , and when demand is less acute , there are mechanisms by which 451 nCLCa clathrin can generate SVs that are not supported by nCLCb clathrin . 452 453 Considering the whole animal phenotypes , including the increased mortality rate for CLCa 454 but not CLCb KO animals , CLCa seems able to sustain house - keeping clathrin functions , 455 while CLCb functions mainly in conjunction with CLCa , apparently in a regulatory capacity , 456 such that a balance between the two is required for some specialised functions . This is in line 457 with the observation that CLC expression ratios vary with tissue , and while lymphoid cells 458 almost exclusively express CLCa , no tissue has been found to express exclusively CLCb ( 9 , 459 62 ) . CLC isoform splicing changes during cell differentiation , development ( 10 , 59 ) and ratios 460 of CLCb relative to CLCa are modulated in tumour progression ( 13 ) and cell migration ( 61 ) . 461 These observations , in combination with the in vitro and in vivo data reported here , support 462 the concept that , in addition to influencing accessory protein interaction , the conserved CLC 463 isoform and splicing differences characteristic of vertebrates facilitate tissue - specific clathrin 464 functions by directly modulating clathrin lattice properties . In particular , CLC diversity 465 regulates clathrin budding efficiency , a property that we show here affects SV formation 466 under acute demand , and is likely to influence other pathways that rely on rapid clathrin - 467 mediated membrane traffic . 468 20 MATERIALS AND METHODS 469 470 Protein expression and purification 471 Except for full - length CHC , all proteins were recombinantly expressed in bacteria and purified 472 by standard affinity and size exclusion chromatography methods as specified in SI Appendix , 473 Materials and Methods . Native clathrin and full length CHC were prepared from porcine brain 474 as specified in SI Appendix , Materials and Methods . 475 476 Characterisation of clathrin lattice properties 477 For lattice curvature determination , cage assembly was induced by dialysis in assembly - 478 promoting buffer A ( 100 mM MES , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 ) and cage size 479 distributions analysed form EM images as specified in SI Appendix , Materials and Methods . 480 Flat lattices were produced and analysed as previously described ( 21 ) and as detailed in SI 481 Appendix , Material and Methods . Lattice regularity was assessed from electron micrographs 482 of similar quality and various focuses for each specimen as a measure of lattice quality . 5 - 12 483 images were analysed for each reconstituted clathrin isoform within each of three 484 independent sets of experiments . In vitro budding was performed as previously described 485 ( 49 ) . In brief , H 6 - Δ ENTH - epsin 144 - 575 was bound to liposomes made from brain polar lipid 486 extracts containing 5 % DGS - Ni - NTA lipids ( Avanti ) . H 6 - Δ ENTH - epsin 144 - 575 - coated liposomes 487 were then chilled to 15 ° C and mixed with clathrin triskelia at 15 ° C , incubated for 30 min at 488 15 ° C and then transferred to ice . Samples were then fixed at 4 ° C overnight and processed 489 for EM analysis . Diameter , coat length , bud angle and neck width of clathrin - coated 490 membrane profiles were measured from electron micrographs using ImageJ ( NIH ) and data 491 processed using Prism ( GraphPad ) . Between 150 and 200 coat profiles , randomly sampled 492 across four thin sections , were analysed for each sample ( > 60 , 000 nm total coat length per 493 experiment per sample ) . The proportion of mature buds , defined by a diameter of less than 494 200 nm , of all clathrin - coated membrane profiles examined , was used as a measure of 495 21 budding efficiency . Results from 3 - 5 independent sets of experiments were tested for 496 statistical significance . 497 498 Generation of CLC KO mice 499 The Cltb ko / ko mouse strain was created from ES cell clone 19159A - F4 , generated by 500 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc . , and obtained from the KOMP Repository ( www . komp . org ) . 501 Methods used to create the CLCb - null ES cell clone have previously been published ( 66 ) . In 502 brief , the complete coding region of the Cltb gene was fully deleted by homologous 503 recombination using a large BAC - based targeting vector . Targeted ES cells were then 504 injected into albino C57BL / 6J - N blastocytes and transferred into foster mothers . Chimeric 505 offspring were mated with C57BL / 6J females ( Charles River ) , and germ - line transmission of 506 the Cltb - null allele ( Cltb ko ) was established . Heterozygote Cltb ko / + mice were backcrossed on 507 the C57BL / 6 background and bred to produce Cltb ko / ko homozygous mice . CLCa KO mice 508 were derived from C57BL / 6 WT mice ( 9 ) and produced by breeding Clta ko / + heterozygotes . 509 WT littermates from the same breedings were used as controls for homozyogous KO 510 animals . All procedures involving animals were conducted according to the Animals Scientific 511 Procedures Act UK ( 1986 ) and in compliance with the ethical standards at University College 512 London ( UCL ) . 513 514 Analysis of protein expression in brain 515 Mouse brains were harvested from six 9 - 12 - month old C57BL / 6 WT and homozygous CLCa 516 and CLCb KO mice and snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further use . 517 Tissue were quickly thawed and homogenised in lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM 518 NaCl , 1 % Triton - X 100 , 5 mM EDTA , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF , cOmplete ™ Protease 519 Inhibitor Cocktail mix ( Roche ) ) . The homogenate was further incubated on ice for 45 min 520 before centrifugation at 21 , 000 g and 4°C for 2 x 10 min in an Eppendorf 5424 R benchtop 521 centrifuge ( Eppendorf ) . Protein content of the lysate was determined by BCA assay ( Thermo 522 22 Fisher ) . For analysis , 25 μ g of sample was loaded on 4 - 15 % acrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad ) and 523 subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting 524 were TD . 1 ( anti - CHC , made in house ) ( 67 ) , X16 ( anti - CLCa , made in house ) ( 68 ) , CLTB 525 ( anti - CLCb , Proteintech ) and anti - beta - actin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 526 527 Electrophysiology 528 Experiments were performed in 8 - 10 - month - old mice . Both male and female mice were used 529 for electrophysiological experiments . Acute transverse hippocampal slices ( 300 µm ) of 530 homozygous CLCa or CLCb KO and control mice were cut on a Leica VT - 1000 vibratome in 531 ice - cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) bubbled with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 containing ( in 532 mM ) : NaCl ( 125 ) , KCl ( 2 . 4 ) , NaHCO 3 ( 26 ) , NaH 2 PO 4 ( 1 . 4 ) , D - ( + ) - Glucose ( 20 ) , CaCl 2 ( 0 . 5 ) 533 and MgCl 2 ( 3 ) . At 5 - minute intervals , slices were then transferred into a series of 3 different 534 chambers oxygenated ( 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ) in the same base ACSF but with the following 535 temperature and component ( in mM ) variations : 1 . 21°C initially with MgCl 2 ( 1 ) and CaCl 2 536 ( 0 . 5 ) then allowed to heat gradually to 36°C ; 2 . 36°C with MgCl 2 ( 1 ) and CaCl 2 ( 1 ) ; and 3 . 537 36°C initially with MgCl 2 ( 1 ) and CaCl 2 ( 2 ) before cooling to 21°C . Slices were then left for at 538 least 1 hour before recordings commenced . 539 540 Evoked recordings were performed on an upright microscope continually perfused with 541 oxygenated recording solution at room temperature containing the same ACSF composition 542 as the third chamber and supplemented with 10 μ M bicuculline . Pyramidal cells in the CA1 543 region were held at - 60 mV in whole - cell voltage - clamp configuration using glass 544 microelectrodes ( resistance 3 - 8 M Ω ) filled with caesium gluconate intracellular solution 545 containing ( in mM ) : D - gluconic acid lactone ( 130 ) , HEPES ( 10 ) , EGTA ( 10 ) , NaCl ( 10 ) , CaCl 2 546 ( 0 . 5 ) , MgCl 2 ( 1 ) , ATP ( 1 ) and GTP ( 0 . 5 ) , QX314 ( 5 ) , pH to 7 . 2 with CsOH . To evoke 547 postsynaptic EPSCs , a bipolar concentric stimulation electrode ( FHC ) was placed in the SC 548 fibres of the CA3 region . For input - output recordings , the stimulus pulse was varied between 549 0 . 2 and 1 mA with a pulse width of 0 . 1 millisecond ( ms ) and stimuli were delivered at a rate 550 23 of 0 . 1 Hz . Paired pulse stimuli were given at rate of 0 . 2 Hz with different inter - stimulus 551 intervals , ranging from 25 ms to 200 ms and a stimulation strength set to approximately 50 % 552 of the maximal response for each cell . PPR was calculated as the ratio of the peak amplitude 553 of the second response over the first response . Calculation of RRP size , initial fusion 554 efficiency and SV recycling rate was done on ESPC recordings that underwent 3 s duration 555 trains of stimulation at 20Hz and estimated as previously described ( 54 , 69 ) . Briefly , RRP 556 size , fusion efficiency ( fe ) and vesicle recycling rate ( α ) were evaluated from the cumulative 557 charge during the stimulation train using the following two equations : 558 559 Equation 1 : 560 561 562 Equation 2 : 563 564 r ( 1 ) is the charge of the first EPSC in the train 565 r ( i ) the charge passed by the i th EPSC 566 r ( ∞ ) was calculated from the average charge of the last 10 EPSCs in the train 567 Δ t is the stimulus interval in the train 568 The RRP was estimated as RRP = r ( 1 ) / fe . 569 570 All currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier , filtered ( 1 kHz ) and digitised 571 ( 10 kHz ) . Data were monitored online and analysed offline using WinEDR and WinWCP 572 software ( available free online at http : / / spider . science . strath . ac . uk / sipbs / software _ ses . htm ) . 573 Stimulus artefacts in representative traces were digitally removed for clarity . 574 575 Statistical analysis 576 All experiments were performed at least three times . All calculations and graphs were 577 performed with ImageJ , Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism software . P - values were 578 24 calculated using two - tailed Student’s unpaired or paired ( in vitro budding ) t - tests , two - way 579 ANOVA with repeated measures ( electrophysiology ) , one - way ANOVA followed by Holm - 580 Sidak correction for multiple comparison or one - way ANOVA for preselected pairs without 581 correction for multiple comparison ( clathrin biophysical properties ) .

Different knee angles ( encircled , black straight and dashed lines ) are adopted 788 for hexagon ( non - curvature inducing ) or pentagon ( curvature inducing ) formation ( 3 , whole 789 triskelion in black and parts of others in grey ) . Lattice curvature is further amended through 790 changes in pucker angle ( 4 , dashed and black lines ) , or changes in proximal leg - crossing 791 angle ( 5 ) . CLC subunits are omitted for simplicity . Different sizes of closed cages are 792 achieved by varying numbers of hexagons and a fixed number of 12 pentagons ( filled black , 793 based on ( 45 ) ) . b Quantification of the percentage of small cages ( < 90 nm in diameter ) in a 794 population of more than 200 cages , generated by in vitro assembly of clathrin reconstituted 795 with indicated CLCs , 1 : 1 mixtures of reconstituted clathrins ( CLCa / b or nCLCa / b ) or CHC 796 only ( CHC ) , determined from electron micrographs ( mean ± SEM , * P < 0 . 05 , * * * P < 0 . 001 797 one - way ANOVA followed by Holm - Sidak correction for multiple comparison , n = 3 ) . c Cage 798 size distributions from assemblies of triskelia formed from full length CHC as described in b , 799 with CLC composition key in d . d Size distributions of cages formed from TDD ( black ) and 800 Hub ( grey ) co - assemblies , with Hub fragments reconstituted or not with the indicated CLC 801 32 isoforms or 1 : 1 mixtures thereof . e Representative EM images of cages formed from full - 802 length CHC ( top ) or Hub / TDD fragments ( bottom ) without or following reconstitution with 803 indicated CLC isoforms .

Interaction between a neuronal splicing insert and the knee of an adjacent triskelion 892 and / or adjacent CLC N - terminus ( N ) could promote conformational change in the CHC knee . 893 As the formation of pentagons and hexagons requires different knee angles , this interaction 894 could consequently influence lattice curvature ( see Fig . 1a ) . c In WT mice ( centre ) , a mix of 895 nCLCa and nCLCb clathrin creates the appropriate biophysical properties to mediate SV 896 generation from endosomal compartments ( and possibly the plasma membrane , blue - green 897 arrows ) . Loss of nCLCa ( left ) creates nCLCb clathrin lattices that are defective in efficient SV 898 regeneration ( blue arrows ) , resulting in decimated SV pools . Loss of nCLCb ( right ) creates 899 nCLCa clathrin lattices , which are also less efficient in SV regeneration than WT , but able to 900 maintain an overall increased SV pool by excess budding to compensate for reduced 901 efficiency in acute SV pool replenishment ( green arrows ) . 902
