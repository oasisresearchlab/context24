Recent experimental work suggests that cofilin also forms functionally distinct oligomers through thiol post - translational modification ( PTM ) that encourages actin nucleation and assembly . Despite these advances , the structural conformations of cofilin oligomers that modulate actin activity remain elusive because there are combinatorial ways to oxidize thiols in cysteines to form disulfide bonds rapidly . This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate human cofilin 1 as a case study for exploring cofilin dimers via disulfide bond formation . Using the free energy profiling , our simulations unveil a range of probable cofilin dimer structures not represented in current Protein Data Bank entries . These candidate dimers are characterized by their distinct population distributions and relative free energies . Of particular note is a dimer featuring an interface between cysteines 139 and 147 residues , which demonstrates stable free energy characteristics and intriguingly symmetrical geometry . In contrast , the experimentally proposed dimer structure exhibits a less stable free energy profile . We also evaluate frustration quantification based on the energy landscape theory in the protein - protein interactions at the dimer interfaces . Notably , the 39 - 39 dimer configuration emerges as a promising candidate for forming cofilin tetramers , as substantiated by frustration analysis . Additionally , docking simulations with actin filaments further evaluate the stability of these cofilin dimer - actin complexes . Our findings thus offer a computational framework for understanding the role of thiol post - translational modification of cofilin proteins in regulating oligomerization , and the subsequent cofilin - mediated actin dynamics in the actomyosin network . INTRODUCTION The actomyosin network serves as a critical cellular scaffold that regulates a variety of cell behaviors , including cell division , shape changes , and movement , 1 , 2 regulated by actin - binding proteins . Among these numerous actin - binding proteins , cofilin holds particular significance . Cofilin monomers act as molecular scissors , severing actin filaments and facilitating the recycling process through the collaborative efforts of capping proteins , profilins , and other actin - binding proteins . 3 – 5 When interacting with actin molecules , cofilin monomers employ distinct binding sites for globular actin monomers ( G - actin ) compared to actin filaments ( F - actin ) , as highlighted in a previous study . 6 A recent cryo - electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) investigation has elucidated the overall structure of F - actin with cofilin molecules decorating the filament ' s surface , leading to the formation of what is termed cofilactin . 7 These studies collectively suggest that filament surface heterogeneity plays a crucial role in modulating filament severing . The variation in filament severing boundaries arises from different combinations of cofilin - actin interfaces , contributing to the stochastic nature of filament severing . Interestingly , experimental evidence substantiates that cofilin is not merely functional in its monomeric form ; it also exists as oligomers with divergent roles in actin regulation . 8 Cofilin has four cysteine ( Cys ) residues that can undergo redox - dependent post - translational modifications ( PTM ) to form specific intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds . 9 Specifically , rather than severing actin filaments , when cofilin forms oligomers through intermolecular disulfide bonds , they are implicated in promoting actin nucleation , assembly , and bundling . 10 , 11 The formation and functioning of the cofilin oligomers are regulated by the local cofilin concentration and the phosphorylation pathway , which also governs the monomeric form . 11 , 12 However , there are combinatorial ways to form intermolecular disulfide bonds . Establishing the causal relation between the molecular arrangement of cofilin oligomers and their distinct role in regulating actomyostin networks in response to redox is unclear . Various experimental works have posited that these cofilin dimers likely emerge through intermolecular disulfide bonds between specific cysteine residues—namely , cysteine 39 and cysteine 147—on adjacent cofilin monomers , 8 instead of a cofilin symmetric dimer through the disulfide bonds between their cysteine 139 residues . 13 Moreover , prevailing theories suggest that the biologically active form of cofilin is not a dimer but rather a tetramer , leaving the dimeric state as a potentially transient state in oligomer formation . 11 However , the structural and functional intricacies of these cofilin oligomers in response to thiol PTMs remain unknown , thereby offering ample opportunities for the application of coarse - grained simulation techniques . While the atomistic simulations have shed light on crucial aspects of the mechanical stress from the composition of filament structures , they are often constrained by limited timescales and length scales , which pose challenges for achieving robust statistical analyses . Coarse - grained protein models provide an avenue to surmount these limitations . The application of coarse - grained protein modeling to explore the network dynamics of CaMKII / F - actin bundles , in conjunction with protein array experiments and electron microscopy imaging , has effectively elucidated the multivalent binding interactions between CaMKII and F - actin , aligning with experimental findings . 14 Collectively , these studies underscore the capacity of coarse - grained protien models to capture sufficient molecular details , enabling them to replicate numerous features of filamentous behavior and , in turn , to address the regulatory roles of actin - binding proteins within the actin network . The advantages of coarse - grained simulations in addressing complex protein behaviors over long timescales make them particularly well - suited for investigating the formation , stability , and function of cofilin oligomers and their interaction with actin filaments . In this study , we focus on human cofilin 1 , with specific attention to the structural representation denoted by the PDB ID 4BEX . 13 While it provides a symmetric cofilin dimeric structure comprised of two monomers , it is noteworthy that the authors themselves suggest that this assembly , formed during crystallization , may not faithfully represent a biologically relevant dimeric state . To fill the existing knowledge gaps , we provide a computational framework to evaluate the cofilin oligomers formed with distinct intermolecular disulfide bonds and their interaction with a short fragment of the actin filament . METHODS Associative - memory , water - mediated , structure and energy model ( AWSEM ) The present study leveraged the AWSEM ( Associative - Memory , Water - Mediated , Structure , and Energy Model ) coarse - grained protein force field for an in - depth analysis of cofilin protein dimerization . 15 This force field , implemented on the LAMMPS simulation platform , employs a three - bead model for each amino acid residue , representing C - alpha , C - beta , and O atoms . This coarse - graining preserves ideal peptide bond geometry , thus enabling efficient simulations of protein folding dynamics , 16 structure prediction , 16 and protein aggregation . 17 – 19 The energy function of AWSEM comprises transferable and physically - motivated potentials , encapsulating complex residue - specific physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions within the framework of protein secondary and tertiary structures . Implicitly , the enthalpic contributions of protein - protein contacts are included in the AWSEM contact energies . In AWSEM ' s coarse - grained scheme , the energy function is sectioned into three main components : V backbone , V non - backbone , and V FM ( Fragment Memory ) , responsible for the backbone geometries , protein ' s physicochemical attributes , and local structural tendencies , respectively . V backbone encompasses five terms that regulate chain connectivity , bond angles around the C α atom , orientations of the C β atoms , backbone dihedral angles , and excluded volume interactions . Harmonic potentials control both the chain connectivity and the bond angles around the C α atom . V non - backbone is further split into three terms : V contact , V burial , and V helical . These terms individually consider aspects like tertiary fold contact interactions , residue exposure / burial preferences , and helical structure propensity . V FM is tailored to bias the local structure towards those found in a " fragment memory " library of protein fragments with similar local sequences . This term also accounts for the local steric effects influenced by the protein’s local sequence . For this study , a single fragment memory scheme within AWSEM was employed to accentuate the effects of physical forces on folding and binding landscapes .

Structural preparation and simulation protocol for cofilin dimer formation through intermolecular disulfide bond The wild - type sequence of human cofilin - 1 ( hCof1 ) is depicted in Figure 1A . Due to the limited availability of monomeric cofilin structures , a crystal structure with high resolution was selected for the monomeric form ( PDB ID : 4BEX ) . 13 This structure was found to possess a mutation at residue 147 , where cystine was replaced by alanine . To revert the structure to its wild - type form , we mutated residue 147 back to cystine using the ‘Mutate Residue’ module available in VMD software , as shown in Figure 1B . 20 The simulation process for forming cofilin dimers was organized into three distinct steps , illustrated in Figure 1C : 1 ) Initiation ( using pushing forces ) , 2 ) Association ( using pulling forces ) , and 3 ) Relaxation ( absence of biasing forces ) . In the Initiation step , a spring force characterized by an equilibrium distance greater than the intermolecular disulfide bond was employed to two cofilin monomers . During the Association phase , a spring force equivalent to the equilibrium distance of a disulfide bond was applied between the Cys39 - Cys147 and Cys139 - Cys139 residues of adjacent cofilin monomers , to simulate oxidized thiol cysteine residues from post - translational modifications . For simplicity , Figure 1C shows only the Cys139 - Cys139 bond as an example . The Relaxation step was designed to allow the mutual configurations of cofilin monomers in the dimer assembly to stabilize naturally , simulating the reduced state of cysteine . Accordingly , the biasing spring force was removed during this phase . The simulated system was held at a constant temperature of 300K throughout the study . Each simulation trajectory consisted of three phases : 1 ) Initiation , 2 ) Association , and 3 ) Relaxation , as previously outlined . These phases encompassed 0 . 5 , 4 , and 4 million simulation time steps , respectively . To ensure the robustness of our statistical analysis , we conducted a total of 30 individual trajectories . Figure 1 . The mutated cofilin sequences , their monomeric structure , and simulated dimer formation workflow are described . A : Sequence representation of human cofilin 1 ( PDB ID : 4BEX ) . Cysteine residues 39 , 139 , and 147 are highlighted in red , blue , and green , respectively . The latter was mutated to cysteine in our simulations to mirror in vivo conditions . While cysteine residue 80 is also underlined , it is not color - coded . The color patterns introduced here are consistently used in subsequent figures . B : Monomeric cofilin structure post the mutation at residue 147 . The protein chain is rendered using the ' NewCartoon ' method in cyan , while cysteine residues employ the ' Licorice ' visualization with colors as designated in ( A ) . Due to spatial proximity in relation to residue 39 , cysteine residue 80 is labeled . C . The stages of simulated dimer formation . ( i ) Monomers are drawn apart using a gentle spring force centered on the total protein structures . ( ii ) The force from stage ( i ) is discontinued and replaced by a potent spring force — set at an equilibrium distance of 2 Å , the approximate length of a disulfide bond — encouraging the monomers to assemble ( as demonstrated using residues cys139 and cys139 ) . ( iii ) Post removal of the bias from ( ii ) , the monomers are at liberty to oscillate or dissociate . All molecular visualizations were made using VMD . Importance sampling and free energy analysis For the purpose of free energy analysis , 21 we employed two distinct configurations of cofilin dimers as reference structures for umbrella sampling . The first configuration featured Cys139 - Cys147 at the interface ( 139 - 147 cofilin dimer ) , which was identified during the previous unbiased relaxation simulation within the context of the 3 - stage dimer formation simulation . The second configuration corresponded to the crystallized 4BEX assembly ( 139 - 139 cofilin dimer ) obtained through experimental means 13 Notably , the reference structure was derived by averaging over the last 50 simulation frames of a single trajectory , specifically chosen from among the 30 trajectories to ensure the stable dimer formation of interest . In the umbrella sampling , a harmonic biasing force was applied to the α - carbon atoms of the target molecule , utilizing the global Q value of the entire dimer assembly as the sampling coordinate . The force constant was set at 1000 kcal / mol Å 2 , and the center values for each sampling window ranged from Q = 0 . 025 to 0 . 975 at intervals of 0 . 025 , yielding a total of 36 sampling windows . All other parameters were kept consistent with default values utilized in previous work . 16 We conducted umbrella sampling analyses for five replicate sets , selecting only the binding simulations where the two cofilin monomers remained consistently associated with each other ( i . e . , Q ≥ 0 . 60 ) . The global Q values from these binding simulations were concatenated into an array and subsequently categorized into 300 discretized centers . The data , now organized by centers , were processed through Pyemma thermo module to calculate the free energy and then visualized . 22 The jupyter notebooks for umbrella sampling analysis can be found on the Github ( https : / / github . com / pnnl / PTMPSI / tree / master / ptmpsi - awsem ) . Exclusion of long - range electrostatics in binding simulations Recognizing the significance of electrostatic interactions in governing protein structure and dynamics is fundamental to our understanding of molecular behavior . Notably , while the standard AWSEM code incorporates local electrostatic interactions with the solvent , it does not consider long - range electrostatic interactions . Our previous research has emphasized the pivotal role played by long - range electrostatic interactions ( namely , Debye - Hückel potentials ) in predicting the structural characteristics of specific proteins and shaping the binding energy landscapes of various protein binders . 16 However , when considering the stability of cofilin , these interactions appear to have a limited impact . A comparison of the simulated annealing results for cofilin , with and without the inclusion of long - range electrostatics , clearly demonstrates their negligible effect on the native structure ' s stability , as visualized in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information . Furthermore , even in scenarios where multiple cofilin molecules engage in dimerization , our frustration analysis ( refer to Figure S2 in the Supporting Information ) confirms that these long - range electrostatic interactions do not exert a significant influence . Figure S2 vividly illustrates the minimal role of electrostatic - induced frustration interactions at the cofilin binding interfaces . Consequently , despite the capability of AWSEM to incorporate long - range electrostatics in simulations , we have chosen to exclude these interactions from our binding simulations due to their limited impact on the proteins under investigation . Visualization , clustering , and frustration analysis The analysis of our AWSEM simulations was conducted using various tools and techniques . To visualize the simulations , we employed VMD . 20 The total protein structure was visualized using the ' New Cartoon ' drawing method , while the specific cysteine residues ( 39 , 139 , and 147 ) were highlighted using the ' Beads ' drawing method , each assigned a distinct color ( Cys39 in red , Cys139 in blue , and Cys147 in green ) for easy identification within the dimer . For further trajectory analysis , we initially processed the PDB files containing the cofilin dimer configurations using the Python package MDTraj . 23 Subsequently , we generated contact maps illustrating the residue positions within the cofilin dimers using the Contact Map Explorer ( https : / / github . com / dwhswenson / contact _ map ) , which is an open - source tool built on MDTraj . The scripts for generating these contact maps are available on our Github repository ( https : / / github . com / pnnl / PTMPSI / tree / master / ptmpsi - awsem ) . To perform structural clustering analysis , we curated a total of 1360 structures obtained from biased simulations conducted for umbrella sampling . In pursuit of a comprehensive exploration of the cofilin dimer ensemble , we systematically selected these structures across five separate replicate simulations , each representing 16 distinct trajectories ( resulting in a total of 5x16 = 80 trajectories ) . Within each trajectory , we extracted a structure every 50 simulation frames , yielding a grand total of 5x16x17 = 1360 representative structures . Our clustering analysis began by transforming the Q - global data , into a square form . The Q value serves as a structural similarity measure , ranging from 0 to 1 , where " 1 " signifies an identical reference structure and " 0 " denotes a completely dissimilar counterpart . Subsequently , we employed hierarchical clustering analysis , utilizing the Python package Seaborn and the function " seaborn . clustermap . " In this analysis , we specified critical parameters , including metric = " correlation " for the pairwise distance metric and method = " average " for the linkage method . These choices facilitated the generation of informative visualizations . Please consult our GitHub repository ( https : / / github . com / pnnl / PTMPSI / tree / master / ptmpsi - awsem ) for further reference and access to detailed scripts related to the clustering analysis of the dimer configurations . To investigate frustration within the cofilin structures , we utilized the Frustratometer Server , accessible at http : / / frustratometer . qb . fcen . uba . ar / . 24 The concept of frustration in biomolecules and its contemporary perspective on folding , function , and assembly have been discussed in detail in other sources . 25 , 26 This analysis was performed with a sequence separation parameter of 3 and without considering electrostatics ( see Exclusion of electrostatics in binding simulations section above ) . RESULTS AWSEM simulations reveal multiple probable binding interfaces in a cofilin dimer In our AWSEM simulations , we identified multiple cofilin dimer candidates established by intermolecular disulfide bond with distinct binding interfaces , of which six were particularly noteworthy . Cofilin’s mutual configurations in the dimer are represented using three key cysteine residues ( 39 , 139 , 147 ) for visual inspection . Previous experimental findings had proposed a dimer interface involving cysteine 39 and 147 residues , referred to as the 39 - 147 cofilin dimer . 10 Additionally , the PDB structure of human cofilin 1 ( PDB ID : 4BEX ) reported a disulfide bond formed between adjacent , symmetric monomers at cysteine 139 residues , known as the 139 - 139 cofilin dimer . 13 While our simulations confirmed the presence of the 39 - 147 cofilin dimer , the experimentally reported 4BEX assembly involving disulfide bonds between cysteine 139 residues was notably absent . Our simulations also unveiled several previously unreported binding interfaces , with the 39 - 39 and 139 - 147 interfaces being the most prevalent . In Figure 2A , the population distribution of these cofilin dimer candidates is illustrated using structural clustering analysis , while Figure 2B visualizes the centroid structures based on their constituent cysteine residues . It is important to note that the population size shown in Figure 2A serves as a qualitative indicator for structural categorization purposes and does not represent the realistic population of representative clusters . Our simulation results predict that the 39 - 147 cofilin dimer is the only asymmetric assembly among the other six configurations . The asymmetry of this assembly can be visualized in three - dimensional space by representing the three key cysteine residues ( 39 , 139 , and 147 ) with red , blue , and green balls , respectively ( refer to Figure B - I ) . One can conceptualize a virtual triangle formed by connecting these three cysteine residues ( colored balls ) within the cofilin molecule . The asymmetric binding configuration of a cofilin dimer is akin to envisioning two virtual triangles stacked together with their vertices misaligned . This asymmetric assembly suggests a generic intermolecular interaction between cofilin molecules in vivo and is known to exhibit bundling activity under oxidative stress . 10 The interface residue pairs in this asymmetric assembly consist of a combination of mild hydrophobic contacts ( involving Ser - Ile , Ser - Cys , Tyr - Cys , Cys - Gly , Leu - Gly ) and scattered charge pairs ( including Glu - Lys , Glu - Glu ) . The experimentally determined cofilin assembly , the 139 - 139 cofilin dimer , exhibits C2 symmetry , with two virtual triangles mirroring each other in the crossing plane . In this symmetric assembly , the interface residue pairs engage in numerous strong hydrophobic contacts ( e . g . , Phe - Leu , Ala - Leu , Met - Met , Ala - Met , Ala - Ala , Cys - Cys , Cys - Tyr , Asn - Pro ) and a significant number of repulsive charged pairs ( e . g . , Glu - Glu , Lys - Lys ) . Despite its high degree of symmetry , the distribution of the resulting interaction pairs does not optimize at the interface , thus remaining unobserved in our simulations . On the other hand , the predicted 139 - 147 cofilin dimer displays considerable conformational dynamics among its subspecies . These subspecies share a significant number of strong hydrophobic contacts ( e . g . , Met - Leu , Ala - Leu , Leu - Ile , Met - Met , Met - Ala , Cys - Cys ) along with mild stabilizing charge - pairs ( e . g . , Asp - Glu ) . This combination of chemical interactions underscores the conformational flexibility and dynamic exchange of contacts at the interface . Interestingly , the model of 39 - 39 cofilin dimer exhibits a highly symmetric molecular structure ( C2 symmetry ) with very limited hydrophobic contacts , nearly none at all . The majority of the binding interface is composed of charged residues such as Lys ( + ) , Glu ( - ) , and Asp ( - ) , resulting in charge - complementary clusters , including major attractive charge - pairs , Lys ( + ) - Glu ( - ) and Lys ( + ) - Asp ( - ) , and several repulsive charge - pairs like Glu ( - ) - Glu ( - ) and Glu ( - ) - Asp ( - ) . This phenomenon highlights a unique charge - pair distribution that compensates for repulsive charge forces through effective distribution . One thing worth mentioning is that Arg ( + ) is not observed as part of the electrostatics - driven binding interface , which is notable considering its common role in electrostatic interactions . One possible explanation for the exclusion of Arg ( + ) at the binding interface is the interplay between steric considerations , the structural specificity required for protein - protein interactions , and the relatively large and complex side chain of Arginine ( Arg ) compared to some other charged residues like Lysine ( Lys ) . Protein - protein interactions necessitate a precise fit between interacting surfaces , and the choice of residues in the binding interface often aims to achieve optimal interactions , prevent steric clashes , and maintain a specific structural arrangement .

Dark clusters correspond to the cofilin dimer candidates depicted in B . B . Cofilin dimer candidates indexed I - V , correlating with the cluster map in A . Candidate VI ( 139 - 139 ) represents the experimental assembly from 4BEX , which was not identified in our simulations . Candidates I - V are denoted by the cysteine residues detected at the interface . The cysteine residues 39 , 139 , and 147 are represented as red , blue , and green spheres , respectively . Candidates III and IV ( both belonging to 139 - 147 ) are further distinguished as d1 and d2 , representing degenerative states 1 and 2 , respectively . Notably , the candidate I ( 39 - 147 ) dimer exhibits asymmetry , while the other candidates are symmetric . Free Energy Landscapes of Major Cofilin Dimer Candidates : Insights from Importance Sampling Despite the plethora of cofilin dimer configurations obtained through clustering analysis , their thermodynamic stability remains unknown . To assess their relative stability among the six cofilin dimers , we employed the umbrella sampling technique to explore the binding free energy landscape of cofilin dimers . Figure 3 presents the free energy profile of cofilin dimer candidates using the 139 - 147 dimer as the reference structure . Notably , several basins are evident along the free energy profile , indicating stable populations of the dimer . These free energy basins are labeled A & B , C , and D , with their respective representative structures ( dimer candidates I to VI ) displayed accordingly . Dimer candidates I ( 39 - 147 ) and II ( 39 - 39 ) are situated within the A & B basin , representing the lowest free energy state among the others , despite their initial low prevalence as observed in the clustered dendrogram . This result suggests a greater thermodynamic stability of approximately 5kT ( ~ 3kcal / mole at 300K ) compared to our other dimer candidates , namely III , IV , and V ( e . g . , the 139 - 147 dimer ) . The 139 - 147 dimer ensemble is characterized by the free energy basin C , which exhibits a broader range , indicating higher conformational dynamics . Consequently , the 139 - 147 dimer encompasses several degenerate configurations , including 139 - 147 itself and a doublet pair , d1 / d2 . One distinctive feature that distinguishes d1 from d2 is the relative placement of Cys139 and Cys147 within the interface . In the case of d1 , the positioning of one cofilin ' s Cys139 and Cys147 in the interface is on opposite sides compared to those of the other cofilin . Conversely , d2 demonstrates that Cys139 and Cys147 are situated on the same side . This side - by - side variation is primarily attributed to a rotational change at the interface . Alongside this rotational difference , it ' s worth noting that they also exhibit similar global Q values , as illustrated in the two - dimensional free energy landscape depicted below . The 139 - 139 dimer ( VI ) is not stable in our simulation as it does not exhibit any free energy basin , suggesting it is not a biologically relevant dimer ( in line with the statement in the paper 13 ) . Figure 3 . Free Energy Profiles of Cofilin Dimer Candidates are shown . The monomeric cofilin structure is illustrated at the top left : the main protein chain is in cyan , while cysteine residues 39 , 139 , and 147 are colored red , blue , and green , respectively . This color scheme extends to all dimer structures within this figure . A , B , C , and D denote various free energy profiles , either basin - like or non - basin - like , corresponding to specific dimer configurations . A . Candidate I : 39 - 147 dimer . B . Candidate II : 39 - 39 dimer . C . Candidates III - V : 139 - 147 dimers along with their degenerative states . D . Candidate VI : 139 - 139 dimer ( 4BEX experimental configuration ) . Notably , Candidates I and II exhibit a local free energy minimum that is 5 kT less than Candidates III - V and 10 kT lower than Candidate VI . Candidate VI does not present a local free energy minimum . Experimentally characterized cofilin assembly exhibits a highly frustrated interface while predicted dimer models exhibit a less frustrated interface We conduct frustration analysis 24 for the aforementioned set of six cofilin dimer candidates ( see Figure 4 ) . Frustration in the context of protein analysis refers to energetically unfavorable interactions within specific regions of a given protein . Frustration analysis typically involves comparing the energy of a given interaction or region with the statistical energy distribution of different decoy states . 25 , 27 , 28 If the energy of the interaction is higher than the average energy of the decoys , it is considered frustrated ( indicated by red lines ) . This signifies that the local interaction is not stable within the current protein structure . Conversely , if the energy of the interaction is lower than that of the decoys , it is termed minimally frustrated ( indicated by green lines ) , implying that the local interaction energy cannot be further stabilized through mutation or state changes . Please refer to the Methods section for a detailed definition of frustration and a quantitative description . The dimer interfaces of candidates I , II , and V exhibit predominantly green lines with few instances of red lines , indicative of minor frustrated interactions as compared to candidates III and IV . This observation suggests that the interfaces of candidates I , II , and V are favorable binding counterparts . However , candidate VI , corresponding to the 4BEX experimentally determined assembly , displays many red lines in its frustration analysis , implying a high degree of frustrated interactions . Consequently , the candidate VI interface is unlikely to be a favorable binding interface in the biological context . Figure 4 . Frustration Analysis of Cofilin Dimer Interfaces is shown . Interactions at the binding interface across various cofilin dimer candidates are analyzed for frustration . Green lines highlight minimally frustrated residue pairs , while red lines highlight highly frustrated residue pairs . Notably , Candidates I , II , and V demonstrate less frustrating interfaces compared to Candidates III and IV . In contrast , Candidate VI displays pronounced frustration at the binding interface . The population shifts of dimeric structures from I to V are dynamic due to low free energy barriers in between basins In the context of relatively low free energy barriers separating the basins populated with predicted cofilin dimer configurations , we employed importance ( umbrella ) sampling simulations to construct two - dimensional free energy landscapes . These landscapes profile free energy as functions of critical coordinates . Figure 5 illustrates these landscapes , depicting the free energy in terms of the global Q value and the radius of gyration ( Figure 5A ) , as well as the system ' s potential energy as a function of the radius of gyration ( Figure 5B ) . Thermodynamically speaking , candidate V readily interconverts with candidates III and IV , owing to negligible energy barriers . It ' s noteworthy that both III and IV exhibit comparable Q values , approximately around Q = 0 . 6 , within the same free energy basin . This similarity in Q values indicates that they share similar contacts formed at the interface . This similarity in the interface suggests a degree of dynamic flexibility inherent to this binding interface . It is characterized by variations in the relative orientations of individual monomers , which results in a degeneracy in energy , designated as d1 and d2 . In contrast , dimer configuration V presents a significantly distinct Q value , approximately 0 . 9 , indicating a structurally different configuration . Remarkably , the radius of gyration ( R g ) for III - V falls within the range of 20 to 22 Å , consistent with their similarity in shape . Furthermore , these local minima are more thermodynamically favorable for conformational transitions into candidates I and II , as indicated by the directional arrows in Figure 5 . Figure 5 . Free Energy Landscape of Cofilin Dimer Transitions is explored using two - dimensional free energy surfaces .

( B ) Free energy landscape mapped as a function of R g and potential energy . Dimers are pinpointed at the free energy local minima , represented by dashed circles , and labeled I to V . Arrows of varying thickness indicate the probability of transitions , influenced by relative free energy differences . Cofilin monomer and dimers interact differently with actin filament fragments To explore the binding affinities of various cofilin forms with actin , we utilized the ClusPro2 . 0 server for docking simulations between a cofilin dimer model and a fragment of F - actin . As a control , we first demonstrated that monomeric cofilin readily docks onto a F - actin fragment where the cofilin monomer ( yellow ) places at the junction of actin units , as depicted in Figure 6A—an observation consistent with its role in actin severing . Conversely , cofilin dimers ( for example Model I ) can only dock at the terminal ends of F - actin , not between adjacent actin units , as illustrated in Figure 6C . Figures 6B and 6D further illustrate that both monomeric and dimeric forms of cofilin exhibit strong binding affinity for G - actin . Based on these findings , we propose that the smaller size of the cofilin monomer facilitates its docking between actin units on F - actin , thus enhancing its role in severing . Conversely , the larger size of dimeric cofilin limits its binding to either G - actin or the terminal ends of F - actin , aligning with their respective roles in actin nucleation and assembly .

DISCUSSIONS Symmetry and Stability of Cofilin Dimers : Insights to Cofilin Tetramers from AWSEM Simulations In this simulation study , we have predicted various cofilin dimer configurations that could potentially be guided by intermolecular disulfide bond formation . We should note that each cofilin dimer is characterized by distinct binding interfaces . Employing free energy analysis 29 through the AWSEM coarse - grained force field , 15 these proposed dimeric configurations display diverse population distributions and relative free energies . Among these , one particular candidate , designated as " dimer 139 - 147 , " stands out due to its prevalence , characterized by an interface involving cysteine residues at positions 139 and 147 . Additionally , we identify two other notable dimer candidates named " dimer 39 - 39 " and " dimer 39 - 147 . " The configuration of " dimer 39 - 147 " bears a resemblance to the experimentally proposed dimer structure , while " dimer 39 - 39 " holds promise as a potential precursor to cofilin tetramer formation . Some of these configurations find support in experimental evidence , either directly or indirectly , while others are theoretical predictions lacking experimental validation . Nevertheless , our free energy calculations have demonstrated the capacity to predict the stability of these configurations . Notably , among all the predicted cofilin dimer configurations , the 39 - 39 assembly stands out due to its remarkable stability , high degree of symmetry , and optimized charge - pair distributions at the interface . This prediction raises the intriguing possibility of a prevalent population when cofilin oligomerizes into larger entities - - from cofilin dimers to tetramers , where two cofilin dimers randomly diffuse and collide . The 39 - 39 dimer ' s C4 - like symmetry positions it as a strong candidate for participating in the formation of a cofilin tetramer . To test this hypothesis , we conducted AWSEM simulations . Initially , we applied two biasing forces to maintain disulfide bond equilibrium distances between the Cys39 residues of adjacent 39 - 39 dimers . Subsequently , these forces were removed to assess the tetramer ' s structural stability . As illustrated in Figure 7A , these simulations revealed a stable cofilin tetramer configuration . Further analysis of mutational frustration within the tetramer , as shown in Figure 7B , indicated minimal frustration at the interfaces between the four chains . We speculate that this tetrameric configuration is energetically favorable , thereby providing support for its potential as a biologically relevant assembly . While higher - order reaction schemes are possible , we consider the most probable reaction channel to involve a second - order reaction , wherein two activated cofilin dimers interact to form a tetramer . Such simulations will require more sophisticated simulations ; therefore , it is beyond the scope of this study . Figure 7 . The Proposed Tetrameric Configuration of Cofilin Using 39 - 39 Dimers is shown . ( A ) Display of the simulated tetrameric cofilin structure , with protein chains rendered in cyan and cysteine 39 residues emphasized using red balls . Notably , this configuration remains stable in the AWSEM simulation without any external force biases . ( B ) Mutational frustration analysis was conducted at the interface between two contrasting dimers , colored tan and gray . A dominant minimally frustrated interface is inferred , as the majority of interactions within the delineated ellipsoid are green , indicative of an optimized binding interface . Cofilin Oligomerization and Its Functional Implications in Actin Regulation through Post - translational Modifications The regulatory influence of cofilin monomers or oligomers on filamentous actin , for instance , involves a complex interplay of cooperative binding and mechanical coupling with the filament , resulting in diverse severing activities at the interfaces between bare and decorated segments . 30 Numerous computational investigations , conducted at various levels , have been dedicated to exploring the mechanical stress modulation induced by cofilin binding . 31 – 33 Among these investigations , mesoscopic models have proven to be particularly valuable for elucidating the mechano - elastic properties of actin filaments in the context of fragmentation . De La Cruz et al . pioneered a mesoscopic model capable of predicting bending and torsional rigidities based on polymer interaction energies , geometric constraints , and twisting - bending coupling dynamics . 31 This model , as subsequently refined to include considerations of filament helicity and occupancy , has demonstrated its efficacy in mapping filament strain energy across specific lateral and longitudinal interfaces . 33 Since these mechanical stress requires input from subtle changes in protein structures , all - atom molecular dynamics simulations play a pivotal role in furnishing these intricate structural insights at the molecular level that remain elusive in mesoscopic models . For instance , extensive molecular dynamics simulations have the capability to faithfully reproduce the subtle helical twists observed in actin filaments upon cofilin binding , 34 a phenomenon consistent with cryo - electron microscopy findings . 35 The atomistic - scale simulations have also uncovered the asymmetric dynamics of barbed and pointed ends , along with intricate conformational changes in neighboring subunits arising from differences in crossover lengths at slow - severing and fast - severing boundaries . 36 , 37 Even with AlphaFold2 38 or RoseTTAFold 39 that offers us a tool to predict protein structures from sequences accurately , these structure - only models with canonical amino acids lack the interpretation of protein functions that rely on post - translational modification ( PTM ) . PTM is the chemical modification of amino acids in response to changes in the cellular environment . While some PTMs , such as phosphorylation , require specific enzymes to characterize cellular behaviors , oxidation - reduction ( redox ) - based PTMs ( i . e . , redox PTMs ) of thiol - containing cysteines are the most common in rapid responses to shifting redox conditions . 40 One of the authors recently developed a Python - based workflow , PTM - Ps i ( A Python Package to Facilitate the Computational Investigation of Post - Translational Modification on Protein Structures and Their Impacts on Dynamics and Functions ) , that allows users to interpret how chemical perturbations caused by PTMs , particularly thiol PTMs , affect a protein ' s properties , dynamics , and interactions with its binding partners . They demonstrated the utility of PTM - Psi for interpreting sequence - structure - function relationships of a cysteine - rich protein derived from thiol redox proteomics data . 41 Here , cofilin oligomerization involves thiol PTMs of cysteines to form intermolecular disulfide bonds under oxidation stress . Our cofilin dimer models enable us to explore these possibilities based on cofilin ' s distinct binding interfaces . We employed a straightforward docking approach to address these questions , aiming to provide practical insights into predicting cofilin ' s function in terms of its oligomeric state . We showed that due to the volume exclusion , only cofilin monomers could fit at the cleft of actin filaments , while cofilin dimers have fewer options to bind to the actin filament . Under oxidation stress , cofilins may regulate their binding with actin filament through its thiol PTMs of disulfide formation . We fit this coarse - grained modeling module based on AWSEM simulations into the schema of PTM - Psi ( https : / / github . com / pnnl / PTMPSI / tree / master / ptmpsi - awsem ) . CONCLUSIONS Our study focuses on cofilin , a vital actin - binding protein known for its role in actin - severing and monomer recycling . Recent experimental discoveries have highlighted cofilin ' s capacity to form functionally diverse oligomers through intermolecular disulfide bond formation , contributing to actin nucleation and assembly . The formation of cofilin oligomers signifies its importance in regulating actin dynamics under oxidative stress . We provided a computer model to evaluate the structural conformations of these cofilin oligomers and evaluated their impact on actin binding with coarse - grained molecular simulations . Our findings enhance our comprehension of the intricate interplay between cofilin and actin , which has a far - reaching impact on understanding the cellular cytoskeletal dynamics .
