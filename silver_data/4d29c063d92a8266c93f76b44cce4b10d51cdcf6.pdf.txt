T E C H N I Q U E S A biosensor for the activity of the “ sheddase ” TACE ( ADAM17 ) reveals novel and cell type – specific mechanisms of TACE activation Douglas A . Chapnick , Eric Bunker , Xuedong Liu * Diverse environmental conditions stimulate protein “ shedding ” from the cell surface through proteolytic cleavage . The protease TACE [ tumor necrosis factor – a ( TNF a ) – converting enzyme , encoded by ADAM17 ] mediates protein shedding , thereby regulating the maturation and release of various extracellular sub - strates , such as growth factors and cytokines , that induce diverse cellular responses . We developed a FRET ( fluorescence resonance energy transfer ) – based biosensor called TSen that quantitatively reports the kinetics of TACE activity in live cells . In combination with chemical biology approaches , we used TSen to probe the dependence of TACE activation on the induction of the kinases p38 and ERK ( extracellular signal – regulated kinase ) in various epithelial cell lines . Using TSen , we found that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in keratinocytes induced rapid and robust TSen cleavage and the accumulation of TACE at the plasma membrane . Cytoskeletal disruption also increased the cleavage of endogenous TACE sub - strates , including transforming growth factor – a . Thus , TSen is a useful tool for unraveling the mecha - nisms underlying the spatiotemporal activation of TACE in live cells . INTRODUCTION The tumor necrosis factor – a ( TNF a ) – converting enzyme ( TACE ) , en - coded by the ADAM17 gene , is a transmembrane protease that is im - plicated in numerous physiological processes , including inflammation ( 1 , 2 ) , wound healing ( 3 ) , development ( 4 ) , and cancer progression ( 5 , 6 ) . In these diverse processes , TACE plays a common role as an extracellular sheddase that cleaves the pro - / transmembrane form of a wide variety of ligands and receptors ( 6 ) . For example , TACE activity mediates autocrine and paracrine signaling mediated by TNF a during the immune re - sponse by cleaving pro - TNF a , thereby enabling the release of soluble TNF a , which binds to and activates the TNF receptor ( 2 ) . Similarly , TACE activity mediates autocrine and paracrine signaling mediated by TGF a ( transforming growth factor – a ) and amphiregulin ( 7 ) , both of which are lig - ands of EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) that regulate cellular motility during development , wound healing , and metastasis ( 8 – 10 ) . EGFR is also cleaved by TACE , enabling complex feedback mechanisms in the regulation of cellular motility ( 11 ) . Although ligand shedding has gained increased attention as a major posttranslational modification mech - anism and significant research has been conducted in an effort to under - stand the consequences of the release of TACE substrates on autocrine and paracrine cell signaling , relatively less is known about how TACE activity is itself regulated . Several lines of evidence suggest that TACE activity is spatially and temporally regulated within a cell or a tissue ( 12 – 14 ) . TACE activation has been proposed to require the proteolytic cleavage of the autoinhibited pro - TACE form ( 15 ) , mediated by the protease furin ( 6 ) ; however , furin - deficient cells display a clear ability to mature and activate TACE ( 16 ) . Thus , the mechanism mediating the proteolytic activation of TACE is incompletely understood . It has been suggested that the trafficking of TACE to the plas - ma membrane is the primary means of TACE regulation in cells ( 17 – 21 ) . Direct phosphorylation of TACE at Thr 735 by either p38 MAPK ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) or ERK ( extracellular signal – regulated kinase ) has been proposed to facilitate the trafficking of TACE to the plasma membrane and , hence , its subsequent extracellular activity ( 17 – 21 ) . Other studies point to the importance of the exit of TACE from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , which is mediated by the inactive rhomboid protease iRhom2 ( 13 ) . Additionally , pathophysiological mutants of the kinase Src have been shown to regulate plasma membrane display of TACE , and there is some evidence that wild - type Src may also mediate this process ( 22 , 23 ) . How the TACE protease is regulated such that it is able to cleave 76 sub - strates in a cell type – dependent manner ( 6 ) and mediate diverse physio - logical and pathophysiological processes is an outstanding question . The current mechanistic understanding of TACE regulation is hampered by a lack of effective tools to measure the spatiotemporal regulation of TACE activity in live cells . Here , we developed a novel FRET ( fluorescence resonance energy transfer ) – based biosensor for TACE activity called TSen , and its use in live cells reveals that rapid TACE activation can be achieved not only through the activity of p38 and ERK but also through changes in the subcellular trafficking of TACE . Using TSen , we identified novel chemical modulators that either activate or repress TACE , which may also prove to be of further use as research tools to study the functional regulation and consequences of TACE activity . RESULTS The TSen FRET biosensor was designed using a mixture of domains from TGF a and TNF a Using a chimeric protein design approach , we developed a novel , genet - ically encoded FRET biosensor , which we call TSen , to measure TACE activity in live cells by fluorescence microscopy . As displayed schemat - ically in Fig . 1A , TSen has an N - terminal leader sequence derived from TGF a , a TACE cleavage site from TNF a flanked by linker regions , a PDGFR ( platelet - derived growth factor receptor ) transmembrane domain , an eCFP ( enhanced cyan fluorescent protein ) FRET donor , and a YPET [ a yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) variant ] FRETacceptor in a similar man - ner as to what has been used for the MMP14 ( matrix metalloproteinase Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , 596 UCB , University of Colorado , Jennie Smoly Caruthers Biotechnology Building ( JSCBB ) , 3415 Colorado Ave - nue , Boulder , CO 80303 , USA . * Corresponding author .

A key difference between TSen and other protease cleavage biosensor designs is that two tandem valines make up the immediate C - terminal end of the sensor , which mimic the C - terminal valines that are required for TGF a maturation in live cells ( 25 ) . The use of a TACE cleavage site derived from TNF a in TSen is the result of exten - sive research that identified a small peptide region within TNF a as an effi - cient and specific substrate of TACE over other metalloproteinases ( 26 , 27 ) . Although a TACE - specific cleavage site derived from TNF a is incorporated into TSen , TSen differs from the TNF a and TGF a proteins in the distance between the cleavage site and the transmembrane domain along the poly - peptide chain ( about 245 , 18 , and 7 amino acids , respectively ) . However , in TSen , the TACE cleavage site is separated from the PDGFR trans - membrane domain with an eCFP domain , whose N and C termini are positioned within 22 ± 1 . 8 Å ( corresponding to a distance of about six amino acids ) of each other , according to the eCFP structure in Protein Data Bank ( identifier 2WSN ) ( 28 ) . Thus , although the TACE cleavage site in TSen is fairly distant from the transmembrane domain in the primary structure , these two domains are likely positioned near each other in the tertiary structure . Additionally , TSen differs from TNF a in that TSen is a type I transmembrane protein , whereas TNF a is a type II . Because TGF a , another TACE substrate , is a type I transmembrane protein , it appears that TACE does not take into account the type of transmembrane protein as a parameter for selectivity . Despite the highly chimeric structure of TSen relative to the structures of endogenous TACE substrates , we found that Fig . 1 . TSen measures the catalytic activity of TACE in live cells .

R E S E A R C H R E S O U R C E www . SCIENCESIGNALING . org 24 February 2015 Vol 8 Issue 365 rs1 2 this chimeric nature did not interfere with TSen being a highly suitable substrate for TACE . TSen measures TACE activity in live cells TSen measures TACE activity as a function of inverse FRET ratio ( CFP / FRET ) , meaning that the FRET signal decreases relative to CFP when TSen is cleaved , presumably by TACE , and the CFP and YPET fluoro - phores are separated , where YPET is then released as a soluble protein into the surrounding medium . In HeLa S3 cells stably expressing TSen , the inverse FRET ratio rapidly increased when PMA ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ) , a previously reported activator of TACE ( 18 ) , was added to the culture medium ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1A ) . This PMA - induced change in the FRET signal was blocked by the addition of TACE inhibitors BMS - 561392 ( DPC - 333 ) or GM6001 . BMS - 561392 is a partially selective TACE inhibitor ( K i = 180 pM ) and has 100 - fold selectivity over several other MMPs and ADAM family members [ MMP12 : IC 50 ( half maximal inhibitory concentration ) = 2 nM ; MMP13 : IC 50 = 12 nM ; ADAMTS4 : IC 50 = 10 nM ) , whereas GM6001 is a nonselective MMP / TACE inhibitor ( 29 ) . Similar results were found in human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected with TSen ( herein called 293T - TSen cells ) ( fig . S1B ) . To de - termine whether PMA - dependent TACE activity , as measured by our sensor , is contingent on the specific sequence of the TNF a cleavage site , we constructed a noncleavable sensor , in which the TACE cleavage site no longer resembled an ideal TACE substrate ( Fig . 1A ) . The noncleavable sensor sequence was predicted to be a poor TACE substrate , according to a previous study ( 30 ) . PMA - dependent activation was not observed in HeLa S3 cells stably expressing the noncleavable sensor compared to those stably expressing TSen ( HeLa S3 - TSen cells ) ( Fig . 1B ) , validating that the TACE cleavage site is the primary and required feature of TSen to show PMA - dependent TACE activity . Because TSen was designed to display reduced FRETefficiency through proteolytic cleavage , we validated that cleavage was indeed occurring . To this end , we additionally measured the release of YPET and CFP from HeLa S3 - TSen cells after a 3 - hour period of PMA stimulation in the presence or absence of either BMS - 561392 or GM6001 . PMA enhanced YPET , but not CFP , release into the medium , and YPET release was inhibited by either pharmacological TACE inhibitor ( Fig . 1C ) . When the same experiment was conducted in HeLa S3 cells transfected with the noncleavable sensor , PMA - stimulated YPET release was greatly reduced but was not complete - ly absent ( Fig . 1C ) . This residual PMA - dependent cleavage of the “ non - cleavable ” sensor is likely still dependent on TACE because both GM6001 and BMS - 561392 inhibited its activation . The remaining small portion of TACE activity detected through YPET release is likely to be attributed to cleavage at a cryptic site located between CFP and YPET in the non - cleavable sensor that is independent of the TNF a cleavage site . These YPET secretion experiments , in conjunction with the microscopy experi - ments , demonstrate the versatility of TSen . Thus , TSen can be used in either a secretion - based fluorescent spectroscopy assay , in a similar man - ner to the available TACE bioassays ( 31 ) , or in a FRET - based live cell mi - croscopy assay . The use of TSen in live cells also enabled the determination of the in - tracellular location at which TACE is active . Using confocal microscopy , we repeated our experiments with HeLa S3 - TSen cells in the presence of PMA to determine whether cleaved TSen localizes to intracellular vesicles or to the plasma membrane . We found that TSen cleavage localizes to a large degree to the plasma membrane and to a far lesser degree to intracel - lular vesicles under these conditions ( Fig . 1D ) . This may be the result of selectively localized TACE activity , or more likely , it is a reflection of the selective localization of TSen . Therefore , TSen is not expected to show all possible subcellular locations where TACE may be active , nor does it eluci - date where TACE itself is activated within a cell . Rather , the observa - tions suggest that TSen is primarily a sensor of TACE activity at the plasma membrane . TSen reports TACE activity with similar dose and kinetic profiles to that of pro - TGF a cleavage at the plasma membrane Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) have been used previously to study TACE - dependent cellular responses , wherein TACE mediates the cleavage of EGFR ligands ( 4 ) . MEFs stably expressing TSen ( MEF - TSen ) re - sponded to PMA stimulation with TACE activation , assessed by an in - crease in inverse FRET ratio ( Fig . 1E ) , similar to that observed for both HeLa S3 - TSen and 293T - TSen cells ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1B ) . We aimed to determine whether the time and dose profiles of TACE activity in response to PMAwere similar between TSen - measured activation of TACE and en - dogenous TGF a cleavage assessed by Western blot analysis . Although we could not detect cleavage of endogenous pro - TGF a in whole - cell lysates ( fig . S1C ) , we could detect the time - dependent disappearance of pro - TGF a in subcellular fractions enriched for plasma membrane ( Fig . 1F ) . The time - and dose - dependent amount of pro - TGF a at the plasma membrane closely resembled the TACE activity as reported by TSen in fluorescence micros - copy experiments ( Fig . 1 , F and G ) . These similarities between the PMA - induced dose - and time - response profiles for TSen and TGF a cleavage suggest that TSen may be a faithful reporter of TACE activity in general at the plasma membrane . TSen reports TACE activity with high specificity To determine the specificity of TSen for measuring TACE activity , we stably expressed short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) against ADAM17 ( the mRNA encoding TACE ) in HeLa S3 - TSen cells . Knocking down TACE ( Fig . 2A ) showed that the PMA - induced change in FRET ratio reported by TSen was dependent on TACE ( Fig . 2B ) . Similarly , Adam17 − / − MEFs transfected with TSen had no measurable changes in the TSen - reported inverse FRET ratio in response to PMA , in contrast to wild - type MEF - TSen cells , which display a significant increase in inverse FRET ratio in response to PMA ( Fig . 2C ) . Previous studies show that TNF a can be cleaved not only by TACE but also by the protease PR3 ( proteinase 3 , encoded by PRTN3 ) ( 32 ) . Additionally , the peptidomimetic gelatinase B inhibitor Regasepin - 1 is capable of inhibiting not only gelatinase B but also MMP8 and TACE to the same degree , suggesting that these proteases may share overlapping substrate specificity ( 33 ) . However , knocking down either MMP8 or the protease PR3 in HeLa S3 - TSen cells ( Fig . 2D ) was insufficient to alter either the basal or PMA - stimulated inverse FRET ratio of TSen ( Fig . 2E ) . Together , these series of experiments show that TSen is a biosensor that faithfully re - ports TACE activity with specificity for TACE over other similar proteases . TACE activation by stimulating EGFR is p38 - and ERK - dependent TACE has been reported to mediate the proteolytic activation of several EGFR ligands ( 2 , 7 ) . We determined that PMA - dependent TACE activation mea - sured through TSen depends partially on the kinases p38 and ERK ( Fig . 3A ) , which is consistent with the findings in other studies ( 17 , 18 ) . Because p38 and ERK are both activated upon stimulation of EGFR , and there is uncertainty whether this can enhance TACE activation ( 34 ) , we aimed to determine the breadth of the phenomenon of EGFR - mediated activation of TACE in several established cell lines . To this end , we created three ad - ditional stable epithelial cell lines expressing TSen ( HaCaT keratinocytes , SCC13 squamous carcinoma cells , and VMCUB1 bladder cancer cells ) and tested their responses to EGF . Although TACE was not activated by exogenous EGF in HeLa S3 - TSen cells ( fig . S2A ) , EGF efficiently activated R E S E A R C H R E S O U R C E www . SCIENCESIGNALING . org 24 February 2015 Vol 8 Issue 365 rs1 3 TACE in HaCaT , SCC13 , and VMCUB1 cells ( Fig . 3 , B to D ) . The kinetics of activation of TACE was faster in PMA - stimulated cells ( 1 hour to satu - ration , fig . S1A ) , compared to EGF - stimulated cells ( 3 hours to saturation , fig . S2B ) . EGF - dependent TACE activation was blocked in all cell lines by pharmacological EGFR inhibition using gefitinib , which is consistent with the theory that the activation of TACE by EGF occurs through EGFR . As expected , the TACE inhibitor BMS - 561392 diminished both basal and EGF - dependent TACE activation , revealing that only a portion of the total TACE activity in all three of these cell types was dependent on EGFR . Additionally , the effects of the inhibitors SB - 203580 and CI - 1040 , which target p38 and MEK1 ( MAPK kinase 1 , which phosphorylates ERK ) , respectively , consistently showed the importance of both of these kinases in EGF - dependent TACE activation . Thus , EGF - dependent activation of TACE in these three cell lines was similar to that of PMA - dependent activa - tion of TACE in both HeLa S3 and 293T cells ( Fig . 1E and fig . S1B ) , in which both chemical and biochemical activation of TACE were p38 - and ERK - dependent . Chemical compound screening reveals novel activators and inhibitors of TACE To further understand the cellular regulation of TACE , we conducted an unbiased screen of small - molecule compounds in HaCaT - TSen cells to find those that are capable of modifying TACE activity . We screened 81 compounds that affect diverse cellular functions ( table S1 ) , from a library of small molecules that either have been widely used research tools or are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical applications . Thus , each compound has a known mechanism of action . Our screen re - vealed two candidate compounds that activate TACE [ cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) and quinacrine ] and two candidate compounds that repress TACE ( doxorubicin and sunitinib ) ( Fig . 4A ) . All four candidates were Fig . 2 . TSen reports specifically TACE activity .

SCIENCESIGNALING . org 24 February 2015 Vol 8 Issue 365 rs1 4 validated in independent titration experiments ( Fig . 4B and fig . S3 , A to C ) . Doxorubicin is a DNA - damaging agent that can activate an apoptosis response in cells through the activation of caspase - 8 , a protease capable of activating TACE ( 35 ) . Although we observed doxorubicin to be an inhib - itor of TACE activity , we investigated whether this suppression was an indirect effect as a result of its activation of apoptosis . We found that dox - orubicin did not activate apoptosis as assessed by caspase - 3 cleavage un - der the experimental conditions we used , but it can cause the accumulation of pro - TGF a in whole - cell lysates , supporting the claim that doxorubicin inhibits TACE ( fig . S3D ) . Presumably , this inability of doxorubicin to ac - tivate apoptosis in these cells may be attributed to the high density ( 1200 cells / mm 2 ) at which cells were screened , which leads to density - dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation ( fig . S3E ) and hence to decreased DNA replication and a decreased amount of doxorubicin - associated DNA inter - calating damage . Actin cytoskeleton – dependent activation of TACE relies on the accumulation of TACE at the plasma membrane Because CytoD , an inhibitor of actin polymerization , emerged as the strongest potential activator of TACE , we investigated the possible regu - latory connection between the actin cytoskeleton and TACE activity . We conducted a dose - response experiment in HaCaT - TSen cells using latrun - culin B ( LatB ) , which is another actin - depolymerizing agent with a mech - anism of action that is different from that of CytoD . We found that LatB had a similar ability to increase the inverse FRET ratio ( fig . S3F and Fig . 4 , C to E ) with faster kinetics than that of EGF ( half maximum at ~ 30 min compared with ~ 120 min , respectively ) ( figs . S2B and S3G ) . We confirmed that these actin - targeting drugs were capable of modulating the actin cytoskeletal structure at their respective EC 50 ( half maximal effective concentration ) concentrations by fixing HaCaT cells in the presence or ab - sence of either CytoD or LatB and staining for F - actin using phalloidin – rhodamine B ( fig . S3H ) . Furthermore , the actin depolymerization – induced increase of the inverse FRET ratio in TSen - expressing cells did not require the kinase activity of ERK or p38 in HaCaT and SCC13 cells ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) , but it did in VMCUB1 cells and MEFs ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . Although this ERK and p38 dependence was cell type – specific , the fact that actin disruption can occur independently of these kinase activities suggests that actin disruption is capable of regulating TACE activity through a mech - anism that is distinct from TACE phosphorylation . Three observations suggested that actin cytoskeletal disruption does indeed cause endogenous activation of TACE . First , CytoD - dependent in - duction of an inverse FRET ratio in MEF - TSen cells was completely blocked upon deletion of the Adam17 gene ( Fig . 4F ) . Second , actin - depolymerizing drugs efficiently induced the release of YPET into the surrounding medium , which was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of TACE with BMS - 561392 ( Fig . 4G ) . Third , actin - depolymerizing agents induced EGFR - dependent ERK activation in HaCaT , SCC13 , and VMCUB1 cells stably expressing a well - known ERK FRET biosensor , EKAR ( 36 ) , which was blocked by pretreating cells with either BMS - 561392 or gefitinib ( Fig . 4H and fig . S3 , I and J ) . These experiments provide additional support that TSen enabled the detection of a previously unknown mechanism of TACE activation : perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton . Because cytoskeletal disruption is variably mediated by p38 and ERK activities across the many cell lines investigated , we sought to explain how actin - depolymerizing drugs were capable of activating TACE indepen - dently of p38 and ERK . The actin cytoskeleton is important for a myriad of cellular processes , including endocytosis through clathrin - coated pits ( 37 ) . Thus , we performed subcellular fractionation of MEFs by differential centrifugation to separate the plasma membrane in cell lysates from the vesicle and soluble components of the cytosol . TACE accumulated at the plasma membrane in cells exposed to CytoD but not PMA ( Fig . 4I ) . How - ever , pro - TGF a abundance was decreased in cells exposed to either PMA or CytoD , the latter eliciting a greater magnitude change ( Fig . 4I ) , which was consistent with our fluorescence microscopy experiments ( Figs . 2C and 4I ) . Upon either PMA or CytoD treatments , the abundance of the TACE sensor TSen at the plasma membrane remained unchanged . The Fig . 3 . ERK and p38 mediate PMA - and EGF - induced activation of TACE .

R E S E A R C H R E S O U R C E www . SCIENCESIGNALING . org 24 February 2015 Vol 8 Issue 365 rs1 5 accumulation of TACE at the plasma membrane is likely to be indepen - dent of the kinase activity of p38 or ERK , because PMA - dependent ac - tivation of TACE consistently relies on the activity of these kinases , but it did not lead to an accumulation of TACE at the plasma membrane . Al - though cleavage of the full - length sensor was expected to mirror the cleav - age of pro - TGF a , we were unable to detect a substantial decrease of the uncleaved TSen by Western blot , although the cleaved product ( YPET ) accumulated in the medium ( Fig . 4G ) . To explain this observation , we per - formed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) in HaCaT - TSen cells , which revealed that TSen turnover at the plasma membrane occurred with a half - life of 1 min , independently of TACE activity ( fig . S3K ) . In contrast , the activation of TSen measured by fluorescence micros - copy occurred about 30 times more slowly ( fig . S3G ) . These data suggest that the combination of a relatively small portion of plasma membrane – localized TSen being cleaved by TACE and the high turnover of TSen at the plasma membrane may preclude the ability to detect TSen cleavage by Western blotting . Nevertheless , our subcellular fractionation data suggest that only actin cytoskeleton disruption , not PMA stimulation , alters the subcellular trafficking of TACE to and from the plasma membrane . DISCUSSION Our study illustrates not only a novel technique for measuring plasma membrane – localized TACE activity with high specificity in live cells but also how the TSen sensor can successfully be used to shed light on the complexity of TACE activation in cells . The development and use of TSen enabled us to discover a previously unknown actin cytoskeleton – dependent mechanism of TACE activation by regulating its accumulation at the plasma membrane . We propose that this mechanism for TACE activation highlights a role for the actin cytoskeleton as a sensory structure , whose integrity is functionally linked to TACE activation , EGFR ligand shedding , and sub - sequent ERK activation .

In addition , TSen enabled us to determine that EGF - dependent activa - tion of TACE was driven by a combination of p38 - and ERK - dependent mechanisms ubiquitously , but to varying degrees , across the many cell lines investigated . This observation suggests that cells may engage a posi - tive feedback system for TACE - dependent shedding of EGFR ligands , where TACE activity can promote subsequent increases in TACE activity through EGFR and p38 and / or ERK activation . Such positive feedback has been proposed in previous studies ( 11 ) . One physiologically relevant occurrence of such a feedback loop may be in the skin to promote wound healing . In wound healing model systems for the skin , epithelial sheets of keratinocytes undergo sustained motility upon wounding , which depends on sustained EGFR activity ( 42 ) . Initiation of epithelial sheet migration may rely on a wide range of possible initial stimuli , such as reactive oxy - gen species ( 43 ) , that activate p38 and / or ERK in response to direct wound - ing . Our study suggests that TACE - mediated EGFR ligand shedding likely continues after the initial activation of p38 or ERK subsides , even when the initial stimulus has been removed . Using TSen may provide insight into not only how individual cells respond to environmental stimuli , as shown here , but also how groups of cells respond during a physiological process like wound healing . This TACE biosensor should facilitate the investigation of mechanisms regulating TACE activation and the development of new phar - macological agents to control its activity .

Oligonucleotides encoding the TACE cleavage site ( sense strand : 5 ′ - TCGAGAGCGGCCTGAGATCTAGCGGCCTGGCCCAGGCCGTGA - GATCCAGCTCCAGAGGCGGCAGCGGATCCACCAGC - 3 ′ , and antisense strand : 5 ′ - GGCCGCTGGTGGATCCGCTGCCGCCTCTGGAGCTGGA - TCTCACGGCCTGGGCCAGGCCGCTAGATCTCAGGCCGCTC - 3 ′ ) or a noncleavable site ( sense strand : 5 ′ - TCGAGAGCGGCAGCGGCAGCAGCGG - CAGCGCTCCCCCGGGCATGAGCGGCAGCGGCGGCGGCAGCGGCACC - 3 ′ , and antisense strand : 5 ′ - GGCCGGTGCCGCTGCCGCCGCCGCTGCC - GCTCATGCCCGGGGGAGCGCTGCCGCTGCTGCCGCTGCCGCTC - 3 ′ ) were inserted in Xho I – Not I site of the EKAREV plasmid to generate TACE - REV and NCS - REV plasmids , respectively . The fragments encoding YPET - TACE - REV - ECFP or YPET - NCS - REV - ECFP were excised by digestion with Eco RI – Xba I and inserted in between the HA and PDGFR domains ( Eco RI – Avr II ) of pBBSR - TGFA - HA - PDGF - FLAG . The resultant vec - tors were named as TSen and NCS ( Fig . 1 ) . FRET data analysis and fluorescence spectroscopy Live cell microscopy was conducted as previously described ( 42 ) . Filters used for FRET measurements were the following : FRET excitation 438 / 24 - 25 , dichroic 520LP , emission 542 / 27 - 25 ( Semrock MOLE - 0189 ) ; CFP excitation 438 / 24 - 25 , dichroic 458LP , emission 483 / 32 - 25 ( Semrock CFP - 2432B - NTE - Zero ) . Time lapse microscopy images were analyzed , and FRET calculations were performed using MATLAB ( data file S1 ) . Briefly , images were background - corrected through subtraction using images acquired from samples of cell - free media . Pixels representing cells were iden - tified as having an intensity 1000 units above background . FRET ratio or inverse FRET ratio was calculated as either FRET intensity against CFP intensity or CFP intensity against FRET intensity , respectively , and all rele - vant pixels were averaged . Each image was acquired at ×4 magnification for calculations , which encompasses data from at least 1000 cells per measure - ment . Measurements were done in triplicate . For images displayed , ×40 mag - nification was used . A similar method of inverse FRET ratio calculations was used in confocal microscopy experiments , where a z plane of 1 - m m height at ×100 magnification was measured , and segmentation of membrane and vesicle fractions was performed in MATLAB . Fluorescent protein secretion experiments YPET media secretion was quantified by transfer of media supernatant to 96 - well plates , followed by measurement of YPET fluorescence using a Tecan Microplate reader ( excitation 500 / 20 , emission 550 / 20 ) . CFP media secretion was performed in the same manner with different parameters ( ex - citation 438 / 20 , emission 485 / 20 ) . Stable shRNA expression Stable shRNA expression was achieved using TRC Lentiviral shRNA ( Thermo ) with the following shRNA constructs : ADAM17 ( TACE ) , TRCN0000052172 and TRCN0000052168 ; PR3 , TRCN0000418696 ; MMP8 , TRCN0000373060 ; and SHC016 ( a control construct ) . Stable shRNA knockdown cell lines were selected in the presence of puromycin ( 2 m g / ml ) . Lentiviral manu - facturing was done in 293T cells , using pHCMV - VSVg , pMDLg , and pREV vectors . Western blotting Whole - cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [ 25 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl flu - oride ( PMSF ) ] . Subcellular fractionation was achieved by lysis in fraction - ation buffer [ 25 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ] , with a buffer - to - cell ratio ( by volume ) of 10 : 1 , for 10 min at 4°C , followed by seven volume strokes with a 1 - ml syringe / 25G needle . Lysate was centrifuged at 3000 g to pellet nuclei . Supernatant was then cen - trifuged at 16 , 000 g . The resulting pellet was used as the plasma membrane fraction , whereas the supernatant was used as the cytosol / vesicle fraction . Antibodies used for Western blots were against pro - TGF a ( 3715S , Cell Sig - naling Technology ) , TACE ( Ab39162 , Abcam ) , GAPDH ( SC47724 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , caspase - 3 ( 9665p , Cell Signaling Technology ) , flotillin - 2 ( 3436s , Cell Signaling Technology ) , PDI ( 3501p , Cell Signaling Technology ) , and YPET ( 632376 , Clontech Laboratories ) . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction For RT - PCR , the following primers were used : ADAM17 ( TACE ) , 5 ′ - GAGCCACTTTGGAGATTTGTTAATG - 3 ′ ( forward ) and 5 ′ - GTTCC - GATAGATGTCATCAACTCTGTC - 3 ′ ( reverse ) ; PR3 , 5 ′ - ATGGCCTCCCTGC - AGATGCGGGGG - 3 ′ ( forward ) and5 ′ - GCCCAGCCAACCTCAGTGCCTCCG - 3 ′ ( reverse ) ; and MMP8 , 5 ′ - AGCTGTCAGAGGCTGAGGTAGAAA - 3 ′ ( forward ) and 5 ′ - CCTGAAAGCATAGTTGGGATACAT - 3 ′ ( reverse ) .

SCIENCESIGNALING . org 24 February 2015 Vol 8 Issue 365 rs1 7 Small - molecule compound library All drugs in the screen were used at 10 m M , and measurements were made after 1 hour . The small - molecule compound libraries included selected com - pounds from the Approved Oncology Drugs Set and the Structural Diversity Set , which were provided by the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program ( http : / / dtp . nci . nih . gov / branches / dscb / repo _ open . html ) . FRAP experiments TSen - expressing HaCaT cells were imaged using a Nikon A1R LSM con - focal microscope . Measurements for CFP were achieved using a 405 laser with a 450 / 50 emission filter . A 100× oil immersion objective was used . A 2 m m × 2 m m square was selected over both the cellular junctions and an unoccupied extracellular space , where photobleaching was performed for 4 s at 100 % laser power . n = 20 cells in each of two independent exper - iments . Image analysis was performed in MATLAB . Cell proliferation assay The Click - IT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit ( Life Technologies ) was used to assay the percentage of cells dividing in populations of cells plated at different density , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Cells were exposed to EdU ( 5 - ethynyl - 2 ′ - deoxy - uridine ) for 8 hours . Statistical analysis All comparisons indicated with brackets were the result of a two - tailed t test , from which P values were obtained , using Microsoft Excel . Two - tailed t tests were conducted between data collected from triplicate trial measure - ments in individual experiments .
