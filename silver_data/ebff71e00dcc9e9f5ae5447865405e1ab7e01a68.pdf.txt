Detrimental Effects of Seductive Details on Multiple Text Inference Generation Alexander A . Johnson , Jason J . L . Braasch , Roger J . Kreuz Psychology Department , The University of Memphis STUDY GOALS • Extend seductive details ( SD ) effect to multiple text context • Explore impact on inferences across texts • Test explanations using reading time predictions 1 • Reduced Attention : less time spent on main text in SD condition • Coherence Break : longer time on sentences following SDs • Inappropriate Schema : no timing predictions • Examine influences of learner characteristics • Interest , prior knowledge , vocabulary , and need for cognition ( NFC ) 1 Lehman et al . ( 2007 ) . Processing and recall of seductive details in scientific text . METHOD • Two texts about weather patterns in typical and El Niño seasons 2 • Presented sentence - by - sentence for reading times • Seductive details based on pilot ratings of interest and importance • Intertextual Inference Verification Task ( IIVT ) 2 • Judge whether 18 provided inferences could be made by combining information across both texts • Learner characteristics • Interest , prior knowledge , vocabulary , & NFC 2 Braasch et al . ( 2014 ) . Incremental theories of intelligence predict multiple document comprehension . RESULTS • Worse IIVT performance for those receiving text with seductive details • Seductive Details ( M = 8 . 71 , SD = 2 . 61 ) < Control ( M = 9 . 84 , SD = 2 . 66 ) • Mixed results for learner characteristics • Vocabulary and NFC were significant predictors of IIVT performance • No interaction with condition • Neither interest nor prior knowledge significant ( p ’s > . 6 ) • Reading Times ( non - parametric tests used ) • No significant difference in main text reading times between conditions ( p = . 49 ) • Sentences following seductive details not significantly longer ( p = . 14 ) DISCUSSION • Seductive details effect observed with multiple text inference task • Seductive details detrimental for inferences across texts • General benefits to IIVT performance from vocabulary and NFC • Interest and prior knowledge not significant • Prior knowledge questions may have been too easy relative to inference ability • Interest may reflect general weather ( e . g . , tornadoes ) , rather than climate • Reading time predictions all in correct direction , but not significant • Further research with larger sample may support these predictions
