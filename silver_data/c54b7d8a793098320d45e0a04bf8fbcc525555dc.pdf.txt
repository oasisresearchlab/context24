Here we report a systematic investigation conducted in 1868 Chinese gastric cancer patients indi - cating that signet - ring cells content was related to multiple clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes . We thus perform whole - genome sequencing on 32 pairs of SRC samples , and identify frequent CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion ( 25 % ) . With 797 additional patients for validation , prevalence of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion is noticed to be associated with signet - ring cell content , age at diagnosis , female / male ratio , and TNM stage . Impor - tantly , patients with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion have worse survival outcomes , and get no bene ﬁ t from oxaliplatin / ﬂ uoropyrimidines - based chemotherapy , which is consistent with the fact of chemo - drug resistance acquired in CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 introduced cell lines . Overall , this study provides insights into the clinical and genomic features of SRCC , and highlights the importance of frequent CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions in chemotherapy response for SRCC .

Multiple subtypes are classi ﬁ ed , such as intestinal and diffuse types according to Lauren ' s classi ﬁ cation 3 – 5 , and diffuse type has signi ﬁ cantly worse treatment outcomes than intestinal type 6 . To ﬁ gure out the molecular mechanisms for tumorigenesis and heterogeneity of gastric cancer at the molecular level , large efforts have been taken to characterize the comprehensive genomic features through high - throughput genomic screening 3 , 7 – 14 , and multiple driver alterations have been identi ﬁ ed . These altered genes are either commonly identi ﬁ ed in other cancers ( e . g . , TP53 , PIK3CA , CDH1 , SMAD4 ) or relatively speci ﬁ c in gastric cancer ( e . g . , RHOA ) 3 , 7 , 15 . As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) project , four subtypes ( i . e . , EBV , MSI , GS , and CIN ) have been systematically analyzed separately in the largest gastric patient cohort ( N = 295 ) including subtypes of Epstein – Barr virus infected ( EBV ) , microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , genomically stable ( GS ) , and chromosomal instability ( CIN ) . It is found that the frequency of PIK3CA mutations is high ( 80 % ) in EBV subtype but low in CIN subtype ( 3 % ) , while ARID1A , RHOA , and CDH1 mutations are prevalent in GS subtype 3 , which has been validated in diffuse type of gastric cancer 7 . Additionally , recurrent structure rearrangement has been observed between CLDN18 and ARHGAPs ( i . e . , ARHGAP26 or ARHGAP6 ) 3 , 16 , which is also enriched in diffuse type , and mutually exclusive with RHOA mutations 3 . Despite of signi ﬁ cant ethnic differences of gastric cancer in terms of prevalent and treatment outcomes 17 , no signi ﬁ cant difference for the frequent mutated genes has been identi ﬁ ed on the basis of ethnic origin in TCGA study 3 . Additionally , no systematical investigation on the association of genetic alterations with clinical features has been done due to the lack of long - term follow - up information for TCGA gastric cancer cohort . Besides Lauren ' s classi ﬁ cation , gastric cancer with at least 50 % of signet - ring cell in the pathologic specimen is de ﬁ ned as signet - ring cell carcinoma ( SRCC ) based on the microscopic characteristics according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) classi ﬁ cation 18 – 20 . Although all SRCCs belong to , and account for less than half of diffuse type 5 , distinct epidemiology and oncogenesis of SRCC have been observed including female / male ratio , tumor location , tumor stage , etc . 19 , 21 SRCC is posi - tively related to survival outcomes in early gastric cancer 22 , however , paradoxically associated with worse prognosis com - pared to non - SRCC in advanced tumor stage 18 , 19 , and may have different chemosensitivity pro ﬁ les 19 , 23 – 25 . Although a few of the SRCC patients may be analyzed as diffuse type in previous studies 3 , no systematical study has been done to investigate the comprehensive molecular characterizations of SRCC due to the heterogeneity and low content of signet - ring cells in most tumor samples . In this study , we systematically investigate the speci ﬁ c clinical features of SRCC , and characterize the genomic features of SRCC tumors with > 80 % presence of signet - ring cells ( de ﬁ ned as HSRCC ) through whole - genome sequencing ( WGS ) , to deter - mine clinically relevant ( e . g . , survival outcomes ) frequent geno - mic alterations in a large patient cohort . Results Clinical characteristics and prognostic value of SRCC . In this study , a total of 1868 primary gastric cancer patients who had underwent gastrectomy from 2006 to 2012 were included for analyses ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . SRCC patients were de ﬁ ned according to WHO classi ﬁ cation ( containing > 50 % of signet - ring cells in pathologic tumor specimen , N = 375 [ 20 . 1 % ] ) . Further , to investigate the in ﬂ uence of low frequency of signet - ring cells , we divided the rest of the patients into two groups : con - SRCC ( containing < 50 % of signet - ring cells , N = 556 [ 29 . 8 % ] ) and non - SRCC ( no signet ring cell at all , N = 937 [ 50 . 2 % ] ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Consistent with previous reports , we found signi ﬁ cant differences between SRCC and non - SRCC patients in terms of multiple clinical character - istics . Not surprisingly , feature values of con - SRCC patients rank between those of SRCC and non - SRCC , indicating the positive association of signet cells content with younger age , higher female / male ratio , advanced tumor stage , lower tumor locations , higher risk of invasion , and higher frequency of diffuse subtypes ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Survival outcomes were compared among non - SRCC , con - SRCC , and SRCC groups ( Fig . 1a ) in 1703 out of 1868 patients ( 91 . 2 % ) with fully postoperative follow - up information , Signet - ring cell content was related to shorter survival time in patients with advanced stage but not stage I ( Fig . 1b , and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted , identifying signet - ring cell content as an independent prognostic factor for survival outcomes in gastric cancer , as well as TNM stage , capillary invasion , etc . ( Table 1 ) . Chemotherapy treatment outcomes of SRCC . We next investi - gated the survival outcomes by separating patients into two groups in terms of chemotherapy usage . Not surprisingly , the overall survival rate increased signi ﬁ cantly in patients with che - motherapy treatment ( P = 0 . 002 , Log - rank test , Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Considering the signet - ring cell content , non - SRCC and con - SRCC but not SRCC patients got bene ﬁ t from chemotherapy in all stages ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) or advanced stage only ( Fig . 1d ) , while patients with diffuse type , which all SRCCs belong to , also have signi ﬁ cantly longer survival time with chemotherapy introduction ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , therefore SRCC is considered as an independent prognostic factor for chemotherapy treatment . Genomic alterations of SRCC identi ﬁ ed by WGS . Next we sought to identify the genomic features of SRCC due to its distinct clinical characteristics . In this case , we focused on HSRCC , which has > 80 % presence of signet - ring cells in the tumor specimen as described above ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , and found that HSRCCs tend to have even worse survival outcomes compared to non - SRCC , with 38 % and 73 % of 3 - year overall survival rate , respectively ( P = 0 . 001 , Log - rank test , Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . All HSRCC tissue samples for WGS were got from patients enrolled in 2012 , and similar association of SRCC with clinical char - acteristics were observed ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . WGS was performed on all available 32 tumor / normal pairs of HSRCC samples , with a mean depth of 66 . 4× ( range from 57 . 2 to 89 . 3× ) and 40 . 4× ( range from 30 . 6 to 52 . 1× ) covering 98 . 3 % and 95 . 3 % of reference genome with ≥ 20 depths in tumors and matched control , respectively . Totally , we identi ﬁ ed more than 1000 potentially functional somatic SNVs and 16 INDELs ( 931 mis - sense , 63 nonsense , 27 splice sites , 6 inframe INDELs , 10 frame - shift INDELs ) . No obvious hypermutant or MSI tumor sample was identi ﬁ ed according to sequencing - based MSI determination . Alternatively , patients can be classi ﬁ ed into hypomutant and non - hypomutant in terms of total mutations ( Fig . 2 ) . A total of 949 genes have at least one somatic non - silent SNV or small INDEL in coding region ( Supplementary Data 1 ) , of which six signi ﬁ cantly mutated genes ( SMG ) were identi ﬁ ed , including TP53 ( 25 % ) , CDH1 ( 15 . 6 % ) , PIK3CA ( 12 . 5 % ) , ERBB2 ( 6 . 3 % ) , LCE1F ( 6 . 3 % ) , and OR8J1 ( 6 . 3 % ) ( Fig . 2 and Supple - mentary Data 2 ) , but not the well - reported SMGs enriched in ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04907 - 0 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 2447 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04907 - 0 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications diffuse type , such as ARID1A , RHOA , and SMAD4 ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Fig . 7 , and Supplementary Data 2 ) , indicating possible distinct genomic features of SRCC from other diffuse type of gastric cancer . Interestingly , despite of low mutation rate in RHOA , multiple mutations were identi ﬁ ed in its regulatory factors , such as RhoGAPs ( GTPase - activating protein , including ARHGAP1 , ARHGAP5 , and ARHGAP26 ) or RhoGEFs ( GDP / GTP - exchange factor , including ARHGEF2 , ARHGEF5 , ARH - GEF33 , and ARHGEF40 ) ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Data 1 ) . With pathway analyses , we identi ﬁ ed frequent alterations across multiple pathways in non - hypomutant group ( e . g . , cell adhesion , enriched score = 8 . 5 , FDR = 8 . 1 × 10 − 9 , Supplementary Data 3 ) , but not hypomutant group ( Supplementary Data 4 ) . Further Protein – protein interaction ( PPI ) network analyses identi ﬁ ed 107 additional cell adhesion - related mutant genes ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , indicating the important role of cell adhesion pathway on SRCC tumorigenesis . Consistent with the ﬁ ndings of stable genomic characteriza - tions for diffuse type , only 4 out of 32 tumor samples had obvious extensive somatic copy number alterations ( SCNAs ) . Besides the recurrent large - scale copy number gain and loss ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , 15 out of 32 tumors had foci or extensive of loss at a tumor suppressor ( i . e . , 46 . 9 % of FHIT ) ( Supplementary Fig . 10A ) , while recurrent ampli ﬁ cations were observed at 8q24 . 21 ( 21 . 8 % , including MYC ) , 10q26 . 13 ( 12 . 5 % , including FGFR2 ) , 11p13 ( 12 . 5 % , including CD44 ) , 19q12 ( 9 . 4 % , including CCNE1 ) , and 20q13 . 2 ( 15 . 6 % including BCAS1 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 10B - F ) , among which MYC , FGFR2 , CD44 , and CCNE1 were well - known oncogenes . We further investigated the somatic SVs ( Supplementary Data 5 ) , and identi ﬁ ed high frequency of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion ( Figs . 2 and 3a ) , which linked exon5 or downstream of CLDN18 to exon 12 ( N = 6 ) or exon 10 ( N = 1 ) of ARHGAP26 , or to exon 2 ( N = 1 ) of ARHGAP6 ( Fig . 3b ) . With Sanger sequencing validation in cDNA level , we noticed that the ARHGAPs splicing acceptor activated a cryptic splicing site before the stop codon of CLDN18 in exon5 ( Fig . 3b ) , and validated the result in another 65 out of 797 patients ( Supplementary Data 6 ) . With activation of this cryptic splicing site , truncated CLDN18 ( lost last 11 amino acids ) and ARHGAP26 / 6 ( lost the ﬁ rst to the translocated exons ) are predicted to be inframely fused . Moreover , patients with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion tended to have ARHGAP s or ARHGEF s mutations ( P = 0 . 04 ) , but were mutually exclusive with CDH gene ( i . e . , CDH1 , CDH4 , CDH6 , and CDH8 ) mutations ( Fig . 2 ) . Finally , we integrated all genes involved in SNV / INDEL , SVs , and SCNA ( focal alterations containing no more than three genes ) , and performed cluster and pathway analyses , cell adhesion category still ranks the top ( Supplementary Data 7 ) . Correlation of genomic features to clinical characteristics . Logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical characteristics and genetic alterations . Mutation rate was positively related to age at diagnosis ( P = 0 . 04 , Logistic regression test ) , with an average age of 49 ( ±13 years ) and 57 ( ±13 years ) in hypomutant and non - hypomutant group , respectively .

Frequency of such fusion was in parallel with signet - ring cell content in either all patients ( 2 . 2 % non - SRCC , 11 . 0 % con - SRCC , and 17 . 0 % SRCC , P = 4 . 1 × 10 − 9 , Logistic regression test ) or patients with diffuse type alone ( 0 % non - SRCC , 14 . 8 % con - SRCC , and 19 . 4 % SRCC , P = 0 . 003 , Logistic regression test ) , and positively related to younger age at diagnosis ( 51 . 3 ± 12 . 4 years vs . 60 . 7 ± 12 . 2 years , P = 4 . 2 × 10 − 10 , Logistic regression test ) , female / male ratio ( 4 . 6 % in male vs . 18 . 5 % in female , P = 1 . 7 × 10 − 9 , Logistic regression test ) , advanced TNM stage ( 1 . 6 % in stage I / II , 9 . 7 % in stage III , and 16 % in stage IV , P = 1 . 7 × 10 − 5 , Logistic regression test ) , and Lauren ’ s subtypes ( 1 . 2 % in intestinal , 15 . 4 % in diffuse , P = 0 . 005 , Logistic regression test ) ( Fig . 4a – c and Supple - mentary Table 4 ) . Interestingly , patients with CLDN18 - ARH - GAP26 / 6 fusions tended to have a higher N stage ( P = 2 . 2 × 10 − 7 , Logistic regression test ) and M stage ( P = 0 . 003 , Logistic regression test ) , but not T stage ( P = 0 . 13 , Logistic regression test ) , indicating this fusion may contribute to tumor metastasis rather than invasion . Despite of the differences of clinical characteristics in TCGA cohort , recurrent CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion ( 13 / 295 ) was also signi ﬁ cantly enriched in patients at a younger age ( 60 . 2 ± 10 . 7 years vs . 66 . 8 ± 10 . 7 years , P = 0 . 03 , Logistic regression test ) , females ( 2 . 3 % in male vs . 8 % in female , P = 0 . 03 , Logistic regression test ) , and diffuse type of gastric cancer ( 1 . 1 % in intestinal , 11 . 8 % in diffuse , P = 0 . 001 , Logistic regression test ) ( Fig . 4a – c and Supplementary Table 4 ) . No signi ﬁ cant difference was observed of TNM stage in TCGA patients , possibly because of their older age and ethnic diversity . Since SRCC status are also associated with gender , age and stage , we conducted multivariate analyses and found that the association of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion with these clinical characteristics can only partially explained by SRCC status ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . For instance , the frequency of CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion raised to 12 . 1 % and 24 . 4 % in male and female patients with SRCC , respectively . We next evaluated the prognostic potential of the genetic alterations in gastric cancer . Patients with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion had worse survival outcomes compared to fusion - free patients ( P = 0 . 03 , Cox ’ s regression model , Supplementary Fig . 11A ) , which can be partially explained by TNM stages ( e . g . , P = 0 . 35 for patients at stage III and IV , Supplementary Fig . 11B ) , indicating CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion may not be an independent predictor for survival outcomes . To exclude the impact of therapy regimen , we compared patients with and without any chemotherapy treatment . Patients with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion got no bene ﬁ t from chemotherapy ( P = 0 . 92 , HR = 1 . 03 , 95 % CI : 0 . 55 – 1 . 94 , Cox ’ s regression model ) compared to fusion - free patients ( P = 0 . 001 , HR = 1 . 41 , 95 % CI : 1 . 15 – 1 . 75 , Cox ’ s regression model ) after adjusting for stages and SRCC status ( Table 2 and Fig . 5 ) , suggesting the potential prognostic value of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion for chemotherapy introduction independent of TNM stages . Function of the common fusion in cell lines . To ﬁ gure out the role of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion in gastric cells , we stably expressed CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 in a gastric cancer cell line ( i . e . , BGC - 823 ) . Compared to control , cells with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 overexpression got no advantage in cell prolifera - tion ( Fig . 6a ) , but had signi ﬁ cantly increased ability of cell migration ( Fig . 6b ) , which is considered as a late event in can - cer progression . Moreover , we proceeded to drug response assay by treating the cells with either 5 - ﬂ uorouracil or oxaliplatin . CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 overexpressed cells exhibited around three folds of resistance to oxaliplatin compared to control ( IC 50 = 4 . 6 [ 95 % CI : 3 . 2 – 6 . 7 ] vs . 1 . 6 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 9 – 2 . 7 ] ) , and 5 - ﬂ uorouracil ( IC 50 = 0 . 58 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 37 – 0 . 91 ] vs . 0 . 21 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 13 – 0 . 34 ] ) ( Fig . 6c ) , providing further evidence for fusion - induced chemotherapy resistance . Next , CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 was introduced into two additional cell lines ( i . e . , AGS and MKN - 74 ) , and little change has been observed in terms of growth rate and migration ability ( Supplementary Fig . 12a and 12b ) . However , cells with fusion overexpression also exhibited drug resistant to 5 - ﬂ uorouracil / oxaliplatin in MKN - 74 but not AGS cell lines ( Sup - plementary Fig . 12c and 12d ) , indicating the varied effects of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 among gastric cells with different genomic backgrounds . Discussion Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant digestive cancers , and its treatment strategy has been well developed during the past decades 1 , 2 . SRCC has been ﬁ rstly noticed for its speci ﬁ c microscopic characteristics , and de ﬁ ned as a high - grade malig - nancy subtype . In this study , we divided the patients into three groups , and found that the signet - ring cell content was in parallel with higher female / male ratio , younger age , higher risk of serosa invasion , and lymph nodes metastasis , which is consistent with previous reports 18 , 21 . Moreover , SRCC status is associated with survival outcomes independently in advanced stage only , pro - viding additional evidence to settle the arguments on its prog - nostic value 21 , 26 – 28 . Considering the different chemosensitive pro ﬁ les of SRCC and non - SRCC in Caucasians 25 , 29 , we ﬁ rstly systematically investi - gated the in ﬂ uence of SRCC status on survival outcomes of chemotherapy treatment in Chinese population , and noticed that current chemotherapy strategy can signi ﬁ cantly bene ﬁ t non - SRCC and con - SRCC but the curative effect remains unclear to SRCC patients . Since signi ﬁ cant improvement of treatment out - comes in terms of survival rate in patients with diffused types , which contains all SRCC ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , we considered that determination of SRCC status rather than Lauren ’ s classi ﬁ - cation may guide the chemotherapy usage in gastric cancer treatment . However , more independent validations in large sample sized are needed , and prospective trials ( e . g . , Clin - icalTrials . gov , NCT01717924 ) 30 are still expected . The distinct clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of SRCC indicate the importance of systematically genetic research on this subtype of gastric cancer . Although some of the reported diffuse types of gastric cancers may be SRCC 3 , 12 , high content of other tumor cells may greatly impact on the molecular char - acterization of signet - ring cells . Indeed , speci ﬁ c genetic pro ﬁ les Fig . 3 Somatic copy number variations and structure variation in HSRCC . a Somatic structure variations of all patients were combined and illustrated with CIRCOS plot .

To our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst whole genomic screening on high - content signet - ring cell tumors . HSRCC belongs to diffuse type of gastric cancer , and consistently has low mutation rate , high frequency of TP53 alterations 3 , 7 , 11 , 12 , foci deletion in FHIT , ampli ﬁ cations of multiple oncogenes ( e . g . , FGFR2 , CD44 , and CCNE1 ) , and enriched mutations in cell adhesion - related genes 12 . However , high frequency of ampli ﬁ cation in MYC and BCAS1 , and low mutation rate in ARID1A and RHOA are noticed in our study , suggesting genetic differences between HSRCC and other subtypes of diffuse gastric cancer . High frequency of gastric cancer speci ﬁ c fusions ( i . e . , CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 ) has been detected in our HSRCC , which has also been reported in TCGA research 3 . Besides the reported fusion pattern of CLDN18 - ARH - GAP26 in TCGA , a rare un - reported case of CLDN18 / exon4 - ARHGAP26 / exon11 has been identi ﬁ ed in our patient cohort , although the last exon ( i . e . , exon5 ) is spliced out , whole region of the most conserved domain ( i . e . , Claudin superfamily ) of CLDN18 has been retained , indicating the similar role of such fusion pattern as others . Given that these fusions retained the Rho - GAP domain of ARHGAP26 / 6 , we considered that CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 may drive the endocytic membrane turnover at tight junction by transient interaction with the Rho - GAP domain of ARHGAP26 / 6 . Because CLDN18 locates at cell membranes through its four transmembrane domains , and is highly expressed in gastric mucosa epithelium cells , CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion protein would result in over - presentation of Rho - GAP domain close to cell surface . Patients with ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion have distinct clinical char - acteristics , and ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion is enriched in patients with SRCC subtype , as well as younger age , higher female / male ratio , advanced tumor stage , which is in parallel with that for SRCC patients , thus can partially account for their clinical relevance . In our patient cohort , ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion can be detected in 17 % of all SRCC patients , or up to 35 % of female SRCC patients with no more than 45 years old at diagnosis . Although it cannot represent all the SRCC , the frequency of such fusion is much higher than most of the reported driver mutated and druggable genes in tumorigenesis in other types / subtypes of cancers ( e . g . , ALK fusion ) , indicating its important role on tumorigenesis of SRCC . More importantly , patients with CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion are resistant to current chemotherapy strategy , which not only partially explains the worse treatment outcome of SRCC , but also suggests detection of such fusion is important to determinate therapy strategy usage in precision medicine era . Actually , recent functional experiments exhibit the cellular characteristic changes in CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 introduced cells , including reduced cell – EMT adhesion / loss of epithelial integrity , and cell pro - liferation 16 .

Importantly , we found signi ﬁ cant resistance to oxaliplatin and 5 - ﬂ uorouracil after introduction of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 in vitro with different infection systems ( Supplementary Fig . 13a - d ) , providing the possible explanation of poor drug response of patients with such fusion . However , inconsistence of drug response changes in AGS cells with stably expressed CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion ( Supplementary Fig . 13e and 13f ) . We noticed that AGS cells have a veri ﬁ ed RHOA mutation in its conserved GTPases domain according to COSMIC database ( version 81 , http : / / cancer . sanger . ac . uk / cosmic / ) , while RHOA were con - sidered to be mutually exclusively mutated with CLDN18 - ARH - GAP26 / 6 in gastric cancer patients from TCGA , indicating RHOA mutation and CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 may function with the similar mechanism in gastric tumorigenesis as well as drug response . We ﬁ rstly established the clinical relevant of CLDN18 - ARH - GAP26 / 6 in gastric cancer . However , due to the lack of com - prehensive clinical information of the chemotherapy treatment outcomes in the large scale of genetic studies in gastric cancer ( e . g . , TCGA ) , more independent validation studies are needed to determine the prognostic signi ﬁ cance of both SRCC status and CLDN18 - ARHGAP , and their impact on determination of personalized treatment strategy . Meanwhile , the biologic mechanisms of drug resistance induced by CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 should also be investigated in the future , so as to provide a way to reverse such resistance . Interestingly , ARHGAP26 is well known as a GTP - activating protein that enhances conversion of RHO GTPases to its GDP state 31 , and directly binds to the downstream cell adhesion - related genes ( e . g . , RHOA ) 32 , 33 . CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion could thus be considered as target for drug screening , and it might be possible to develop novel – 1 0 1 2 – 1 – 2 0 1 2 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 2 4 6 100 80 60 40 20 0 C e ll v i ab ili t y ( % ) 100 80 60 40 20 0 C e ll v i ab ili t y ( % ) N o r m a li z aed O D O D 570 n m Control CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 Drug concentration ( log10 µ g / ml ) Drug concentration ( log10 µ g / ml ) Time ( day ) Control CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 Control CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 5 - fluorouracil Oxaliplatin Control 500 µ m CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Control Fusion a c b Fig . 6 Impact of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 overexpression in cell line .

Overall , this study provides additional insights into the clinical and genomic features of SRCC , and highlights the prognostic signi ﬁ cance of frequent CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions . Methods Patients and specimens . All the consecutive primary gastric cancer patients in this study underwent surgical treatment of gastrectomy from 2006 / 01 to Dec 2012 / 12 , in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery , West China Hospital , Sichuan University . The clinical information was retrospectively collected from the prospective database of gastric cancer ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , and the tis - sue samples were collected from the biorepository , National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy , West China Hospital . Patients ’ selection procedures were listed in the Supplementary Fig . 1 . Patients were classi ﬁ ed into three groups in terms of signet - ring cell content : non - SRCC ( no signet - ring cell at all ) , con - SRCC ( con - taining < 50 % of signet - ring cells in pathologic specimen ) , and SRCC ( containing > 50 % of signet - ring cells ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Patients from 2012 / 01 to 2012 / 12 undergoing whole - genome sequencing screening met the following criteria : ( 1 ) with > 80 % presence of signet - ring cells ; ( 2 ) both the tumor and matched control samples were available ( Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig . 5d . 797 additional tumor samples were collected from 2009 / 1 – 2014 / 12 as validations ( Supplementary Data 6 ) . This study was approved by Ethics Committee of West China Hospital , Sichuan University ( 2014 , no . 215 ) , and informed consent was obtained from patients or their guardians , as appropriate . Treatment strategy and clinical information . The surgical treatments were performed according to the treatment guidelines published by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association 34 . The postoperative chemotherapy was recommended for patients with advanced tumor stages . Combinations of ﬂ uoropyrimidine and platinum regimens were used as ﬁ rst - line postoperative chemotherapy treatment strategies . The following clinical information were retrieved : gender , age , tumor size , tumor location , tumor grade , residual degree 34 , T stage , N stage , M stage , and TNM stage 35 . The tumor grade and tumor stage were diagnosed according to the Union for International Cancer Control / American Joint Committee on Cancer 35 . The tumor subtypes were classi ﬁ ed according to Lauren ’ s classi ﬁ cation , which was started to be routinely characterized after 2012 / 01 5 . Other pathological characteristics , such as nervous invasion , capillary invasion and extranodal metastasis , were evaluated according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Classi ﬁ cation 36 . Postoperative outpatient follow - up was done routinely ( every 3 months during the ﬁ rst two years and then every 6 months for the last 3 years ) . Follow - up information was updated on January 1 , 2016 . Finally 1703 out of 1868 ( 91 . 2 % ) patients had fully postoperative follow - up information , with 44 months median follow - up duration ( we calculated the follow - up duration from the date of surgery to 1 / 1 / 2016 if the patients were still alive , otherwise to the date of deaths ) . Statistics of clinical characteristic and genetic alteration . Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS statistics software , version 20 . 0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) or R ( Version 3 . 2 . 2 ) . The continuous variables were tested for normal distribution before analyzing by one - way ANOVA test . The ranked variables were assessed by the Log - rank test or Kruskal – Wallis test . The categorical variables were taken with the Pearson ’ s Chi - square test ( or Fisher ’ s exact test ) . Impact of clinical characteristics and genetic alterations on survival outcomes were estimated by using Kaplan – Meier method , Cox proportional hazard modeling . Associations of genetic alterations with clinical characteristics were estimated by logistic regression . A two - tailed P value of less than 0 . 05 was regarded as statistically signi ﬁ cant . Nucleic acid preparations and whole genome sequencing . DNA and RNA extraction was performed from the same tissues by using the AllPrep DNA / RNA Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) , and evaluated by using 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Aglient Technologies ) . DNA samples from 32 pairs of HSRCC patients passed quality control for WGS . The standard protocols from Illumina were followed to construct sequencing library for WGS , and submitted to Illumina Hiseq X10 platform to generate sequencing data with 2 × 150bp reads in Fastq format . The detailed sequencing information for each sample has been listed in Supplementary Table 5 , and all the following bioinformatics tools were used in the default setting . All the cleaned reads were aligned to human genome reference ( GRCh37 ) using BWA software ( version 0 . 7 . 10 ) 20 . Picards tools ( http : / / broadinstitute . github . io / picard version 2 . 0 . 1 ) were used to remove those PCR duplicates in BAM ﬁ les . Genome Analysis toolkit ( GATK , version 3 . 5 ) 37 was employed to call variants and small insertion / deletions ( INDELs ) from BAM ﬁ les . Averagely 4 , 247 , 438 SNVs and 979 , 980 INDELs were identi ﬁ ed in each sample , among which 83 . 7 % SNVs and 51 . 4 % INDELs were annotated as polymorphisms in dbSNP137 . Meanwhile , we predicted structure variations ( SVs ) with CREST ( version 1 . 0 ) 38 and copy number variations ( CNVs ) with CONSERTING 39 using default parameters . Somatic alterations identi ﬁ cation . Somatic SNVs and INDELs were identi ﬁ ed by comparing tumors and their matched controls , using MuTect software 40 and Varscan2 ( version 2 . 40 ) 41 , respectively . 8658 somatic SNVs 4325 INDELs were identi ﬁ ed per patient , in which 72 . 5 SNVs and 11 . 2 INDELs were located in coding or splice regions on average , respectively . Several false - positive SNVs and INDELs were removed through manual inspection by using visualization tool IGV ( version 2 . 3 . 67 ) 42 . MSI was determined by WGS - based approach according to previous reports . 20 With the matched normal sample as references , somatic SVs and SCNAs were estimated and illustrated with CIRCOS ( version 0 . 69 ) 43 , and IGV , respectively . Additionally , signi ﬁ cantly mutated genes were identi ﬁ ed by using MuSic2 with the standard procedures 44 . Validation of the common gene fusion . RNA from the 32 pairs of HSRCC tumor / control samples were subjected to reverse - transcribed PCR validation ( F : TGGTGCGGCTCTGTTCGT / R : TGGTCTTTATCTCCCATTCA and F : TGGTGCGGCTCTGTTCGT / R : TCGTCCCTCTGCAAGTCC for CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 and CLDN18 - ARHGAP6 fusion , respectively ) . Additionally , RNA was extracted from expanding 835 tumor samples of gastric cancer patients , 797 of which were in good condition ( 260 / 280 > 2 , and RIN value > 5 ) ( Supplementary Data 6 ) , including 362 non - SRCC , 237 con - SRCC , and 198 SRCC , same RT - PCR condition was proceeded to identify CLDN18 - ARHGAP6 / 26 fusions . Pathway enrichment and PPI analyses . 949 mutated genes were submitted to DAVID ( version 6 . 7 ) for gene enrichment analyses in non - hypomutant and hypomutant group , respectively 45 . Further adhesion genes - related PPI network was built by using data set from PrePPI 46 , and modi ﬁ ed based on the interactions between the mutated cell adhesion and rest genes . Public information downloading . Information of gastric cancer patients from TCGA were downloaded for validation from https : / / tcga - data . nci . nih . gov / tcga / , including genetic alterations and clinical characteristics . Functional experiments with fusion introduced cells . The construct of pMXs - Puro - CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 was purchased from Addgene ( http : / / www . addgene . org / 69465 / ) . The fragment of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion was got by using BamHI and NotI sites , and cloned into pCDH - CMV - MCS - EF1 - copGFP , and con ﬁ rmed by Sanger sequencing . Four available gastric cancer cell lines were picked for checking CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion and CHD1 mutations . MKN - 45 was excluded because it had CDH1 mutation . The rest three cell lines ( i . e . , BGC - 823 , AGS , and MKN - 74 ) were infected with either control ( empty vector ) or CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion contained retrovirus , which was packaged with helper vectors ( PCMV - VSV - G and PCL - Eco ) , and sorted with GFP signal through ﬂ ow cytometer . For validation of the drug resistance , we also used retrovirus system to infect BGC - 823 by using MSCV - expression plasmid , and selected the positive pools with puromycin . MKN - 74 cell line was purchased from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank , BGC - 823 was purchased from Cellbank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences , AGS cell line was purchased from ATCC . All cells lines were treated with Plasmocin ( Invivogen ) for 2 weeks before storage in liquid nitrogen , and routinely tested for mycoplasma with Mycoplasma Stain Assay Kit ( Beyotime ) . Transwell assay was used to evaluate cell migration ability . Brie ﬂ y , 1 ×10 5 cells in 200 μ l quench medium ( 5 % BSA 1640 mediun ) were seeded in 12 - mm Transwell inserts ( Corning ) , and plated into a 24 - well plate with 800 μ l 10 % FBS 1640 medium . After 48 h incubation , The insertions were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min , stained with 1 % crystal violet for 30min , and followed by microscope examination after three times of washing . 33 % acetic acid was added to the 24 wells for eluting the crystal violet of the transwell inserts , then the absorbance of the eluent was measured at 570 nm by microplate reader to indirectly re ﬂ ect cell numbers . All the experiments have been replicated for three times . MTT assay was used to estimate drug response . Brie ﬂ y , 3000 cells were seeded each well of 96 - well plates with 100 μ l of 10 % FBS 1640 medium , and treated with gradient concentrations of oxaliplatin or 5 - ﬂ uorouracil ( Sigma ) on the second day . After 2 ( for AGS and BGC - 823 ) or 3 ( MKN - 74 ) additional days of incubation , 10 μ l MTT ( 5 mg ml − 1 ) was added into each well and incubated for 3h . Afterwards , medium was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide ( 100 μ l ) were added . The absorbance was measured at 570 nm with microplate reader . Data availability .
