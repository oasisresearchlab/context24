Though the muscle - type coﬁlin ( CFL2 ) gene has a crucial inﬂuence on skeletal muscle ﬁbers and other related functions , the epigenetic modiﬁcation mechanism of the CFL2 gene regulating meat quality remains elusive . After exploring the spatiotemporal expression data of CFL2 gene in a group of samples from fetal bovine , calf , and adult cattle , we found that the level of CFL2 gene in muscle tissues increased obviously with cattle age , whereas DNA methylation levels of CFL2 gene in muscle tissues decreased signiﬁcantly along with cattle age by BSP and COBRA , although DNA methylation levels and mRNA expression levels basically showed an opposite trend . In cell experiments , we found that bta - miR - 183 could suppress primary bovine myoblast differentiation by negatively regulated CFL2 . In addition , we packaged recombinant adenovirus vectors for CFL2 gene knockout and overexpression and found that the CFL2 gene could promote the differentiation of primary bovine myoblasts by regulating marker genes MYOD , MYOG and MYH3 . Therefore , CFL2 is an essential mediator for promoting myogenic differentiation by regulating myogenic marker genes in cattle myoblasts . Keywords : muscle - type CFL2 ; spatiotemporal expression ; bta - miR - 183 ; DNA methylation ; cattle ; myoblasts differentiation 1 . Introduction Meat quality and meat composition are not separated from the inﬂuences of animal genetic improvement systems . Previous studies have indicated that meat quality is tightly correlated with muscle composition and structure and the histological properties of muscle ﬁbers [ 1 , 2 ] . It is therefore crucial to further study the molecular genetic mechanism of skeletal muscle growth and development [ 3 ] . Moreover , one study examined coﬁlin gene function as a key regulator of actin assembly on myoblast proliferation and differentia - tion [ 4 ] . In healthy mouse muscle cells , the type of coﬁlin from non - muscle coﬁlin transits to muscle coﬁlin [ 5 ] . In our previous study , we found that CFL1 - mediated epigenetic regulation mechanisms were involved in the myogenic growth and differentiation [ 6 ] . Muscle - type coﬁlin is a new member of the coﬁlin protein family , which mainly regulates the expression of skeleton muscle and cardiac muscle . In mammals , muscle - type coﬁlin is also named CFL2 ( coﬁlin - 2 , M - coﬁlin ) . Studies have shown that CFL2 was mainly detected Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / bioengineering9120729 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / bioengineering Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 2 of 14 in adult skeletal muscle and performs an essential role in skeleton muscle development and maintenance [ 7 – 9 ] . As the only subtype of mature skeletal muscle , CFL2 also performs a crucial function in maintaining the constitution of muscle fibers . A previous report showed that CFL2 is the primary expressed isoform of cofilin in adult muscle of human and murine , especially in skeletal and cardiac muscles [ 10 ] . CFL2 is essential for myoblast proliferation and differen - tiation by modulating the expression of myogenic transcription factors in C2C12 cells . Mai presented an unusual regulatory pattern , wherein CFL2 mediates myoblasts differentiation in C2C12 cells , signiﬁcantly , CFL2 depletion suppressed cell differentiation , accelerated cell proliferation and induced cell cycle from the G0 / G1 stages to the G2 / M stages [ 11 ] . Considering CFL2 a candidate gene for nemaline myopathy , some studies have shown that the mutation from G to A in the coding region position 103 of the CFL2 gene can induce the occurrence of human nemaline myopathy , and the CFL2 gene can regulate the expression of key factors CAM and MEF2C in myoﬁbroblast signal pathway , resulting in a change in muscle properties [ 12 ] . A CFL2 A35T / A35T knock - in mouse model indicated that the expression levels of CFL2 mRNA and full - length transcript decreased signiﬁcantly in skeletal muscles and muscle biopsy samples of a p . A35T mutation patient , respectively [ 13 ] . Sun examined the association of the CFL2 gene polymorphisms with performance traits in Qinchuan ( QC ) cattle . Base mutations at three single nucleotide polymorphisms sites were found in the coding region , which can signiﬁcantly affect body length and body mass of cattle , indicating that the CFL2 gene can be used as a genetic marker for growth traits in cattle breeding program [ 14 ] . According to the regulation of the CFL2 gene on skeletal muscle ﬁbers and other related functions , it can be observed that the CFL2 gene has an important inﬂuence on the growth and development of myocytes . However , if we want to study the way in which it affects skeletal muscle and the speciﬁc functional mechanism of muscle , we need to further explore the epigenetic regulation mechanism of CFL2 gene . Epigenetics has been recently undergoing the evolution of research ﬁeld from diverse and complicated phenomena to profound and deﬁned ﬁeld [ 15 ] . Here , we investigated the regulatory functions of CFL2 from the angle of spatiotemporal expression pattern , DNA methylation and miRNA – target relationship . Our ﬁndings have made comprehensive analysis of the molecular regulation mechanisms of CFL2 gene on myogenesis . This has profound signiﬁcance in understanding the complicated biological characteristics of meat quality and will provide a very strong basis for theoretical research for the subsequent genetic improvement of cattle breeds . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Tissue Collection and Cell Culturing Seven tissue samples ( heart , liver , spleen , lung , kidney , fat and longissimus dorsi muscle tissues ) were harvested from three critical phases of muscle formation and maturation : 90 - day embryonic ( FB , fetal bovine , n = 3 ) , 1 - month postnatal ( calf , n = 3 ) , and 24 - month - old ( AC , adult cattle , n = 3 ) samples .

The Bisulﬁte Sequencing Polymerase Chain Reaction ( BSP ) primers from the CFL2 differentially methylated region ( DMR ) were designed by online software MethPrimer [ 17 ] ( Table 4 ) .

BSP data were analyzed by online software QUMA [ 19 ] and BiQ Analyzer [ 20 ] . The differences of methylation levels were analyzed by SPSS statistics V18 . 0 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Spatiotemporal Expression Proﬁles of CFL2 Gene in Different Tissues In order to investigate the CFL2 role in cattle , our study first detected the mRNA expres - sion levels of CFL2 in seven different tissues of three developmental phases in QC cattle using qRT - PCR . The expressions of the CFL2 gene have the same performance in fetal bovine , calf and adult cattle . CFL2 gene showed the highest expression in muscle tissues , followed by expression in heart and lowest expression in spleen in the three growth and development stages ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1A – C ) . At the fetal bovine stage , the mRNA levels of CFL2 gene among liver , kidney and lung tissues were not significantly different ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1A ) . At Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 5 of 14 the calf stage , the mRNA levels of CFL2 gene in fat and liver were higher than in kidney and lung ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1B ) , whereas at the adult cattle stage , the mRNA levels of the CFL2 gene among the lung , kidney and fat tissues were not statistically different ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1C ) . Figure 1 . Spatiotemporal expression profiles of CFL2 gene in cattle tissues . qRT - PCR was used to examine CFL2 gene mRNA levels of spatiality in six tissues at FB stage ( A ) , seven tissues at calf stage ( B ) , seven tissues at AC stage ( C ) ; CFL2 mRNA levels in lung tissues were taken as 1 . qRT - PCR was used to investigate CFL2 gene mRNA levels of temporally at three developing stages along with cattle age ( D , E ) ; CFL2 mRNA levels at FB stage were taken as 1 . Due to the no fat deposition in FB stage , CFL2 mRNA levels at calf stage were taken as 1 in adipose tissues . Mean data ± SE of n = 3 independent experiments , each performed in triplicate , and normalized to GAPDH . * p < 0 . 05 and * * p < 0 . 01 . We further detected the CFL2 gene mRNA expression level in the same three tissue growth and development stages of QC cattle ; the expression trends are shown in Figure 1D . In heart , liver and lung tissues , the expression of CFL2 gene indicated an upward trend in three growth and development stages along with cattle age . Additionally , due to no fat deposition in FB stage , adipose tissues were observed in calf stage and AC stage , and the results revealed that mRNA expression levels of CFL2 gene have an extremely significant increase in adult bovine compared to that of the calf ( p < 0 . 01 ) . In the spleen , the CFL2 gene has a higher expression level in the calf ; the mRNA level was unexpectedly upregulated in the calf relative to that of the FB and AC stages ( p < 0 . 05 ) , whereas the mRNA expression level in the AC period presented a diminishing drift compared to those of the FB stage and calf stage in kidney tissues ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and the differences in mRNA expression levels in the fetal bovine and calf Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 6 of 14 period were insignificant ( p > 0 . 05 ) . In muscle tissue , the CFL2 gene mRNA level presented an extremely significantly upward trend with cattle age ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 1E ) . 3 . 2 . DNA Methylation Analysis of CFL2 Promoter Region in Muscle Tissues We explored DNA methylation assays on myogenesis and muscle maturation to demon - strate the impression of CFL2 gene differential methylation level on myoblast differentiation at the FB and AC stages . The CpG islands seated in CFL2 DMR were predicted by Meth - Primer [ 17 ] ; one CpG island of CFL2 gene promoter region was taken as research objective ( Figure 2A ) . We found 8 CpGs at CFL2 DMR ( 177 bp ) by BSP - amplified sequences . Every sample sequenced 15 clones ; then , we detected 120 CpGs in every muscle sample at CFL2 DMR . The methylated CpGs percentages of CFL2 gene were 61 . 7 % , 61 . 7 % , 60 . 8 % and 60 . 0 % in the FB group ; there were 47 . 5 % , 47 . 5 % , 46 . 7 % and 48 . 3 % in the AC group . Statistical results presented that the FB group ( mean 61 . 1 % ) had prominently higher methylation levels than the AC group ( mean 47 . 5 % ) ( Figure 2B ) . In order to improve the specificity and to decrease the false positives of BSP sequencing results , we further detected COBRA assay by using restriction enzymes Hin fI ( “GANTC” ) ( Figure 2C ) . At the fourth and fifth CpG sites , 177 bp PCR fragments of CFL2 DMR were digested with Hin fI and obtained 177 , 128 and 49 bp fragment bands by COBRA ( Figure 2D ) . The outcomes were in accordance with the results of BSP sequencing . Figure 2 . DNA methylation analysis of CFL2 promoter region in muscle tissues . Schematic represen - tation of the proximal promoter region ( + 1 to − 3850 base pairs ) to predict high - GC - content regions of CFL2 gene . In CFL2 gene promoter region , there were 177 bp CFL2 DMR ( A ) . BSP assay was used to analyze DNA methylation profiles in FB and AC muscle tissues . There are few rows , one for each of the monoclonal bacterial antibodies ; there are 8 columns , meaning 8 CpG islands ; black circles , meaning methylated CpG region ; and white circles , meaning unmethylated CpG region ( B ) . The 177 bp CFL2 DMR contains eight CpG islands , lower strands present bisulfite - converted bases , and yellow highlights and arrows indicate primer sequences using Hin fI ( “GANTC” ) to cut 4th – 5th CpG islands for COBRA assay ( C ) . COBRA assay was performed to analyze the DNA methylation patterns in FB and AC muscle tissues , each performed in quadruplicate . M means Marker I ( D ) . We further examined the CFL2 gene mRNA levels in FB and AC muscle tissues . Mean data ± SE of n = 3 independent experiments , each performed in quadruplicate , and normalized to GAPDH , ( * p < 0 . 05 ) ( E ) . In cells , methyl moieties may directly regulate the action of transcription factors . To further testify the relationship between DNA methylation level and the expression level of CFL2 gene in muscle tissues at the FB group and the AC group , the following experiment tested the mRNA level of the CFL2 gene . In contrasted with the FB group , the mRNA level of the CFL2 gene in the AC group was statistically higher ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2E ) . Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 7 of 14 3 . 3 . bta - miR - 183 Target Muscle Type CFL2 In addition to influences on muscle , previous study showed that bta - miR - 183 repre - sented regulator of proteolysis in muscle , which affects meat tenderness . To verify this hypothesis in C2C12 cell lines , after treating bta - miR - 183 , mimic or inhibitor , the mRNA level was statistically induced or suppressed ( Figure 3A ) . After performing induction for 4 days for cell differentiation , we found that the mRNA levels of myoblast differentiation marker genes MYOD , MYOG and MYH3 were downregulated by bta - miR - 183 mimic ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Interestingly , the mRNA levels of these three marker genes were statistically upregulated by the bta - miR - 183 inhibitor ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 3B , C ) . These data revealed that bta - miR - 183 could suppress PBM differentiation . Figure 3 . Bta - miR - 183 target muscle type CFL2 . Expression efﬁciency of miR - 183 was examined after treating bta - miR - 183 mimic and inhibitor for 48 h in C2C12 cells ( A ) . The expression of myoblast differentiation marker genes MYOD , MYOG , and MYH3 were detected by qRT - PCR after transfecting miR - 183 mimic or inhibitor into C2C12 cells and inducing for 4 d with 2 % horse serum ( B , C ) . The expression level of miR - 183 was normalized to U6 , the mRNA levels of CFL2 and three marker genes were normalized to GAPDH . CFL2 mRNA ( D ) and protein ( E ) expression in PBMs were detected by qRT - PCR and Western blot after being transfected with miR - 183 mimic , miR - 183 inhibitor and NC for 48 h . Putative binding sites of miR - 183 on the 3 (cid:48) UTR fragments of CFL2 mRNA were detected in different species ( F ) . Computational prediction of the targeting sites of miR - 183 on the 3 (cid:48) UTR fragments of CFL2 was conducted in Bos Taurus , and 8 base deletion of CFL2 3 (cid:48) UTR was designed for mutant type ( G ) . PBMs co - transfected with pairwise plasmids ( bta - miR - 183 mimic and CFL2 - Luc , NC and CFL2 - Luc , bta - miR - 183 mimic and CFL2 - del Luc , NC and CFL2 - del Luc ) , and Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to the ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity ( H ) . NC , Negative Control . Mean data ± SE of n = 3 independent experiments , each performed in triplicate . * p < 0 . 05 and * * p < 0 . 01 . Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 8 of 14 To further determine the effect of CFL2 gene on myoblast differentiation , we exam - ined whether bta - miR - 183 directly targets and regulates CFL2 expression . As shown in Figure 3D , E , the mRNA and protein levels of CFL2 were prominently upregulated or down - regulated after being treated with bta - miR - 183 inhibitor or mimicked in PBMs ( p < 0 . 01 or p < 0 . 05 ) . These results indicated that bta - miR - 183 negatively regulated the expression of CFL2 . Using the in silico method , we predicted a potential binding site for the bta - miR - 183 seed sequence in 3 (cid:48) UTR of CFL2 mRNA in ten different species , which revealed highly conservative bta - miR - 183 target sites ( Figure 3F ) . To verify direct interaction sites between bta - miR - 183 and CFL2 , we generated a luciferase reporter psiCHECK - 2 construct contain - ing a CFL2 3 (cid:48) UTR segment or delete binding site for bta - miR - 183 ( Figure 3G ) . Compared to only containing the NC vector ( p < 0 . 01 ) , renilla luciferase activity was prominently reduced when bta - miR - 183 mimic and CFL2 - Luc co - transfected PBMs , while ﬂuorescent reactive was resumed after bta - miR - 183 mimic co - transfected with CFL2 - del Luc ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 3H ) . The base data showed that miR - 183 directly binds to CFL2 3 (cid:48) - UTR . 3 . 4 . Effects of CFL2 Gene on Myoblasts Differentiation To further investigate whether CFL2 inﬂuences the expressions of myogenic factors , we generated an adenovirus overexpression and interference construct ( Supplementary Data , Figures S1 and S2 ) . mRNA and protein assays demonstrated that CFL2 expression levels were obviously up - regulated or down - regulated after transfection of CFL2 - CMV or shCFL2 in HEK293 cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) ; meanwhile , shCFL2 - 1 had stronger knock - down effects than shCFL2 - 2 ( Figure 4A – C ) . After transfecting CFL2 - CMV or shCFL2 - 1 into C2C12 cells , the marker genes MYH3 , MYOG and MYOD were assessed on differentiation day 4 . We found the mRNA levels of MYOD and MYH3 were upregulated after being transfected with CFL2 - CMV ( p < 0 . 05 ) , while MYOG level was not apparently changed ( p > 0 . 05 ) . After transfecting shCFL2 - 1 , the mRNA expression levels of marker genes were extremely signiﬁcantly decreased ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 4D , E ) . After being induced for 8 days ( DM 1 – 8 d ) in C2C12 cells , CFL2 and marker genes of mRNA levels presented upward trends . During this process , the expression level of the MYH3 gene was always lower than that of other genes , and MYOD gene continuously maintained a high expression level , except it was lower than MYOG gene on DM2 . The CFL2 gene and the MYOD gene displayed the identical differentiation trends with a downward trend during 6 – 8 days ( DM 6 – 8 d ) in the late differentiation stage ( Figure 4F ) . In vitro , PBM model is the optimal one for studying myoblast differentiation ( Supple - mentary Data , Figure S3 ) . After transfection with CFL2 - CMV , the mRNA level of CFL2 was signiﬁcantly up - regulated at 3 – 7 days ( p < 0 . 05 or p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 5A , I ) and the mRNA levels of MYOD , MYOG and MYH3 were extremely signiﬁcantly increased ( p < 0 . 01 ) , ex - cept that there was no obvious difference in MYH3 at 1 day ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 5B – D ) . After transfection with shCFL2 - 1 , the expression of CFL2 was signiﬁcantly decreased compared to control group ( p < 0 . 05 or p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 5E ) , and MYOG was signiﬁcantly down - regulated during myoblast differentiation ( p < 0 . 05 or p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 5G , J ) . Meanwhile , the mRNA levels of MYOD and MYH3 showed an obvious decrease after 3 days of myoblast differentiation ( p < 0 . 05 or p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 5F , H ) . After transfection with CFL2 - CMV , the expression trend of CFL2 was gradually up - regulated during myoblast differentiation ( DM 1 – 7 d ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) ; meanwhile , MYOD and MYOG showed a signiﬁcantly upward trend , and MYH3 slightly increased during myoblast differentiation ( Figure 5I ) . After transfection with shCFL2 - 1 , the expression of CFL2 presented a signiﬁcantly downregulated trend during myoblast differentiation ( DM 1 – 7 d ) ; in the meantime , the expression trends of MYOD , MYOG and MYH3 were signiﬁcantly downward ( p < 0 . 05 or p < 0 . 01 ) , and the peak values of CFL2 and MYH3 both occurred at day 5 after induction and then showed a slight increase after induction ( Figure 5J ) .

Then , the developmental expression patterns of CFL2 gene and three myogenic marker genes from GM to DM7 were further examined after being treated with CFL2 - CMV ( I ) or shCFL2 - 1 ( J ) in PBMs . Mean data ± SE of n = 3 independent experiments , each performed in triplicate , and normalized to GAPDH . * p < 0 . 05 and * * p < 0 . 01 . 4 . Discussion The PBM model acts as an optimal model for perusing myoblast differentiation . It is primarily associated with muscle growth and development and can improve muscle quality [ 21 ] . During culturing , a change in the serum could stimulate myoblasts to differen - tiate to myocytes or myotubes ; in the meantime , the expression of some genes regulated the phenotypes of meat quality by some special epigenetic mechanisms [ 22 ] . Our previ - ous research showed that the CFL2 gene was signiﬁcantly associated with body mass in bovinae [ 14 ] , and there is a strong association between skeletal muscle mass , muscle ﬁber characteristics , meat quality and meat yield of beef cattle . Consequently , it is especially crucial to further expound the epigenetic regulatory network of muscle - related genes . As a muscle subtype , the CFL2 gene was generally considered to be mainly expressed in mammalian muscle tissue . Our present study reveals the myogenic regulatory charac - teristics of the CFL2 gene in myoblast differentiation . An analysis of the spatiotemporal expression showed that the CFL2 gene is widely distributed in various organizations . This indicates that the CFL2 gene has a wide range of biological functions , whereas at the three growth and developmental stages , it revealed a vary expression trend in seven tissues . Especially in AC group muscle tissues , the mRNA expression level of the CFL2 gene was Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 11 of 14 increased probably eight times in comparison with the FB group and showed a high ex - pression pattern and a meaningful increasing trend along with the muscle growth and development . These ﬁndings seem to be in accordance with earlier research on mice muscle tissue [ 8 ] and further demonstrate that the coﬁlin expression subtype could gradually transition to M - CFL2 along with the growth and development of myocytes [ 5 , 23 ] . Skeletal muscle development can be split into two stages : the prenatal stage that affects the number of muscle ﬁbers and the postnatal stage that generates the size of muscle ﬁbers [ 24 ] . The expression change in CFL2 in muscle growth was likely correlated with the regulatory pattern of external epigenetics . Generally , DNA methylation participates in suppression patterns during muscle growth and development in mammals by regulating gene expression . Previous study examined the DNA methylation and mRNA expression of the SERPINA3 gene DMR in muscle tissues and demonstrated that mRNA expression levels of genes could be affected by DNA methylation levels considerably [ 25 ] , and research has demonstrated that a number of methylated genes could act as candidate beef tender - ness biomarkers [ 26 ] . In our prior study , there was a negative correlation between DNA methylation status and the expression level of the IGF2 gene in muscle tissues during the FB and AC stages [ 27 ] . Compared to the FB group , the CFL2 gene showed an obviously high mRNA expression level and relatively low DNA methylation extent in the AC group in this experiment ; here , a detectable trend for mammalian DNA methylation patterns to vary in time and space was observed . In FB and AC , the question arises of how DNA methylated patterns arise in development and maintenance , and how they affect the genetic expression in the whole genome . Though these burning questions cannot be elucidated explicitly now , additional studies have addressed distinct hypotheses experimentally in muscle growth and development [ 28 ] . Although miRNAs act as an important factor in myogenesis and pathogenesis of muscle wasting , the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs are mainly expressed by targeting mRNAs [ 4 , 29 , 30 ] . There are four miRNAs that have been experimentally validated to be capable of regulating bovine skeletal muscle development by miRNA – mRNA interactions ; nine miRNAs have been identiﬁed modulating PBMs differentiation through binding functional genes experimentally [ 31 ] ( Table S1 ) . Owing to the innumerable target genes , the epigenetic mechanisms of miR - 183 seemed very complicated and even inconsistent during skeletal muscle differentiation . Several studies have expounded the miR - 183 function on the apoptosis , proliferation and invasion of cancers by negatively regulated FOXO1 [ 32 – 34 ] . Our previous data exhibited that the FOXO1 gene plays a major part in the bovine myoblast differentiation [ 22 ] . Thus , the function of miR - 183 in PBMs differentiation is still unknown , and the regulatory relationship between miR - 183 and CFL2 has no reports . This research found that miR - 183 may suppress PBM differentiation and conﬁrmed the targeting site with CFL2 , further clarifying the negative regulation mechanism on the CFL2 gene . These ﬁndings enriched the academic theories of miR - 183 on meat tenderness [ 21 ] and ﬁlled the vacancy of miR - 183 / CFL2 axis in the ﬁeld of PBM differentiation . The quality of meat products was mainly affected by the muscle structure and histolog - ical characteristics of myoﬁber , which closely related to muscle cell differentiation [ 35 ] . In this experiment , we demonstrated that miR - 183 restrained myoblast differentiation and pre - liminarily conﬁrmed the proﬁle trend of the CFL2 gene and related marker genes’ effects on myoblast differentiation during one week . Muscle differentiation is a complex process that involves a multistage gene expression and regulation [ 36 – 38 ] . Many research results have reported that CFL2 intensiﬁes C2C12 cell line differentiation . In C2C12 cells , knock - down CFL2 has given rise to F - actin accumulation , accelerated cell cycle progress and increased cell proliferation [ 11 ] . Previous studies showed that miR - 325 - 3p mimic suppressed the expression of CFL2 but elevated the accumulation of F - actin , induced the translocation of nuclear YAP , delayed myogenic differentiation , accelerated the progression of cell cycle and ultimately promoted myoblast proliferation [ 21 ] . In this experiment , the expression level of CFL2 increased gradually during C2C12 differentiation , the peak of related marker genes occurred at different time nodes ; then , all showed a downward trend after DM6 Bioengineering 2022 , 9 , 729 12 of 14 introduction . Due to the fact that during myogenesis , myoblasts differentiate into myocytes and myotubes exhibit an opposite relationship , when myotubes were completely formed , myoblasts have been fully differentiated , and we inferred that marker genes MYH3 , MYOG and MYOD were activated at different myoblast differentiation phases , revealing that CFL2 may be essential for myoblast differentiation . Earlier work has authenticated an increase in CFL2 mRNA during skeletal muscle myogenesis of mice [ 39 ] . Thus , we further conﬁrmed the speciﬁc regulatory function of CFL2 in myoblast differentiation by transfected recombinant adenovirus vectors into PBMs . The results of the present study exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher expression of CFL2 in the late differentiation stage ( 5 – 7 d , myotubes to form myoﬁber ) than in the initial differ - entiation stage ( 1 – 3 d , mononucleated fuse to multinucleated myotubes ) . Subsequently , CFL2 gene overexpression had obviously increased the mRNA level of MYH3 , MYOG and MYOD and knock - down CFL2 gene obviously decreased the mRNA levels of MYH3 , MYOG and MYOD during PBM differentiation . This means that CFL2 tends to promote myoblasts differentiation . Recent evidence indicates that coﬁlin family genes ( CFL1 and CFL2 ) participate in actin cytoskeleton remodeling [ 40 ] . Notably , the CFL1 and CFL2 genes can be expressed simultaneously in embryonic skeletal muscle , whereas the CFL2 gene replaces the CFL1 gene in the late stage of differentiation [ 6 , 8 ] . This means that coﬁlin only presents one subtype ( CFL1 or CFL2 ) along with the muscle cell growth and development in healthy mouse [ 41 ] . This fact may be related to the myogenic regulatory roles of the CFL2 gene in myoblasts ; therefore , we intend to develop a new system for myogenic differ - entiation monitored by CFL2 from the perspective of molecular genetics and epigenetics . CFL2 depletion inactivated cell differentiation progression and inhibited the expressions of myogenic transcription factors , thereby eventually leading to impaired myogenic differen - tiation in myoblasts [ 11 , 42 ] . In light of this , we observed that decreased expression of CFL2 signiﬁcantly suppressed myoblast differentiation . Our research results were consistent with previous results and showed that CFL2 promoted myoblast differentiation , which is also sufﬁcient for the induction of muscle differentiation . 5 . Conclusions In summary , our study reveals that CFL2 was predominantly expressed in adult muscle tissues . It also promoted PBM differentiation by negatively targeting epigenetic modiﬁcation in cattle . Our results will provide beneﬁts for ameliorating the cattle meat production and meat quality .
