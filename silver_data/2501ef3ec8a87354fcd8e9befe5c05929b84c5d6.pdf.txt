Isolation of phage and replicative form . Isolation of phage from V . cholerae was done essentially as described 24 . In brief , 1 - litre Luria broth cultures were grown overnight at either 30 (cid:56) C ( 395 ) or 37 (cid:56) C ( N16961 ) . Cultures were centrifuged twice at 10 , 000 g and the supernatant was passed through a 0 . 45 - (cid:109) m low - protein - binding ﬁlter . DNase I and RNase I ( Boehringer Mannheim ) were added to the ﬁltrate at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 (cid:109) gml - 1 and incubated at room temperature for 3h . NaCl and PEG 8000 were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1M and 10 % w / v , respectively , and the mixture was left to precipitate overnight at 4 (cid:56) C . The supernatant was centrifuged at 11 , 000 g for 20min and the pellet resuspendedin 4ml of SM buffer . PEG was removed with an equalvolume of chloroform . This supernatantwas layeredonto a CsCl 2 step gradient consisting of 2ml each of CsCl 2 in SM buffer ( d ¼ 1 : 7 , 1 . 5 and 1 . 45 ) . After centrifugation at 25 , 000r . p . m . for 2h in an SW41 rotor ( Beckman ) , the lower phage band ( 1 : 45 (cid:60) d (cid:60) 1 : 5 ) was extracted and dialysed against two changes of TM buffer . The phages were further concentrated by the addition of PEG 8000 ( 10 % w / v ) and placed on ice for 2h . The phage preparation was centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 20min and the resulting pellet ( containing phage particles ) was resuspended in 100 (cid:109) l of SM buffer . PEG was removed with an equal volume of chloroform . 5 (cid:109) l of the phage preparation was used for PCR . The replicative form was isolated from 1 litre of Luria broth culture as described 24 . Although ﬁlamentous phage do not lyse the cell or have a ‘burst size’ , we calculated the approximate number of VPI (cid:70) and CTX (cid:70) released per cell and the RF copy number . The number of phage released was calculated by determining the amount of phage DNA ( from its absorbance ) in 1 litre of overnight culture of DK238 and CVD110 containing (cid:44) 10 12 cells . As strain DK238 is positive for VPI (cid:70) and CTX (cid:70) and CVD110 is positive for only VPI (cid:70) , the difference in amount ( in (cid:109) g ) between the two strains should reﬂect the number of CTX (cid:70) genomes ( 7kb ) and the balance the number of VPI (cid:70) genomes ( 40kb ) released per cell . We estimate that 280 and 200 (cid:109) gl - 1 of ssDNA is present in a phage preparation from 1 - litre cultures of DK238 and CVD110 , respectively . If 1 (cid:109) g of 1 - kb ssDNA contains 1 : 8 (cid:51) 10 12 molecules , then 1 (cid:109) g of 7 - kb ssDNA contains 2 : 6 (cid:51) 10 11 CTX (cid:70) molecules and 80 (cid:109) g contains 2 (cid:51) 10 13 molecules , so 2 (cid:51) 10 13 molecules = 10 12 cells indicates that an averageof20CTX (cid:70) aremadepercellduringovernightculture . Likewise , forVPI (cid:70) we calculate that an average of 9 VPI (cid:70) are produced per cell . Our calculations all assume that no otherphage ( orRF ) is produced and that DNAextractionis 100 % efﬁcient , which is unlikely , so values could be underestimates . We estimated that 57 and 39 (cid:109) gl - 1 of dsDNA are present in RF preparations from 1 - litre cultures of DK238 and CVD110 , respectively , which yields an averageCTX (cid:70) RF copy numberof 2 percell afterovernight culture ; the average VPI (cid:70) RF copy number is similarly estimated as 1 per cell . Immunoprecipitation . DNase - and RNase - treated phage preparations were incubated with rabbit anti - TcpA peptide antibody ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) at 37 (cid:56) C and with vigorous shaking for 1h . Mouse anti - rabbit IgG ( whole molecule ) agarose beads ( Sigma ) were added and the reaction was incubated at 4 (cid:56) C overnight with gentle rotation . After several low - speed centrifugations and washings in deionized water , the pellet was resuspended in deionized water . Electronmicroscopy . Phage preparations of CVD110 and 395 were placed on a carbon – formvar - coated 300 - mesh copper grid ( Electron Sciences ) for 2min thennegativelystained with 1 . 5 % phosphotungstic acid for1minand analysed by electron microscopy . In addition , equal volumes of 395 and N16961 phage preparationswereseparatelyincubatedwithrabbitanti - peptideTcpAantibody ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) at 37 (cid:56) C for 20min , after which this suspension was placed on a grid for 5min , and 10 (cid:109) l of 10 - nm colloidal gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( ICN Biomedicals ) was added before negative staining .

The Rho - family GTP - hydrolysing proteins ( GTPases ) , Cdc42 , Rac and Rho , act as molecular switches in signalling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal architecture , gene expression and progres - sion of the cell cycle 1 . Cdc42 and Rac transmit many signals through GTP - dependent binding to effector proteins containing a Cdc42 / Rac - interactive - binding ( CRIB ) motif 2 . One such effec - tor , the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , is postulated to link activation of Cdc42 directly to the rearrangement of actin 3 . © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd letters to nature 380 NATURE | VOL 399 | 27 MAY 1999 | www . nature . com Human mutations in WASP cause severe defects in haemato - poletic cell function , leading to clinical symptoms of thrombo - cytopenia , immunodeﬁciency and eczema . Here we report the solution structure of a complex between activated Cdc42 and a minimal GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) from WASP . An extended amino - terminal GBD peptide that includes the CRIB motif contacts the switch I , (cid:98) 2 and (cid:97) 5 regions of Cdc42 . A carboxy - terminal (cid:98) - hairpin and (cid:97) - helix pack against switch II . The Phe - X - His - X 2 - His portion of the CRIB motif and the (cid:97) - helix appear to mediate sensitivity to the nucleotide switch through contacts to residues 36 – 40 of Cdc42 . Discrimination between the Rho - family members is likely to be governed by GBD contacts to the switch I and (cid:97) 5 regions of the GTPases . Structural and biochemical data suggest that GBD - sequence divergence outside the CRIB motif may reﬂect additional regulatory interactions with functional domains that are speciﬁc to individual effectors . To identify a suitable system for structural analysis , we assayed the binding of a series of WASP fragments to Cdc42 in complex with the non - hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPPCP and Mg 2 + , both bio - chemically and by NMR spectroscopy . All fragments contained the WASP CRIB motif , amino acids 238 – 251 , deﬁned as the minimum conserved sequence in several Cdc42 / Rac - binding proteins 2 ( Fig . 1a ) . As found previously 4 , only fragments containing at least residues 230 – 288 of WASP maintained high afﬁnity for the GTPase ( K D , 20 – 30 nM ) . NMR analyses indicated that all unbound peptides were largely disordered in solution . However , in the presence of Cdc42 – GMPPCP , they adopted discrete structure , with a minimal binding domain indicated by a conserved group of 44 well dispersed cross - peaks in 1 H / 15 N heteronuclear single - quantum coherence spectra . We carried out structural studies on a fragment of WASP ( amino - acids 230 – 288 ) bound to Cdc42 ( residues 1 – 179 ) in com - plex with GMPPCPand Mg 2 + . Table 1 shows statistics describing the ﬁnal set of 20 converged structures . A best - ﬁt backbone super - position of the conformers is shown in Fig . 1c . Residues in the CRIB motif bind Cdc42 in an extended con - formation , contacting the ﬁve C - terminal residues of switch I , and the entire adjacent (cid:98) 2 strand ( residues 41 – 47 ; Fig . 2a ) . This interaction effectively appends the central (cid:98) - sheet of the GTPase with an additional , irregular strand containing a series of conserved (cid:98) - bulges at WASP residues 240 – 241 , 243 – 244 and 247 – 248 . Bind - ing through strand - like contacts is also found in the two reported Ras - family GTPase – effector complexes , Rap1A – Raf ( ref . 5 ) and Ras – RalGDS ( ref . 6 ) ( Fig . 2b ) , indicating that this may be a common feature of target recognition by small GTPases . However , in these cases binding involves an independently folded domain of the effector , and the contacts cover a larger region of switch I without extending across (cid:98) 2 . N - terminal to the CRIB region , WASP residues 231 – 237 form a compact loop that packs against the (cid:98) 2 – (cid:98) 3 turn and adjacent C - terminal (cid:97) 5 helix of Cdc42 . The C - terminal portionoftheGBDisfolded into atwo - strandedantiparallel (cid:98) - hairpin ( residues 252 – 253 and 257 – 258 ) and a short (cid:97) - helix ( residues 265 – 274 ) .

Figure 3 shows intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects ( NOEs ) that deﬁne packing of the switch - II residues Leu 67 and Leu 70 against aliphatic and aromatic residues of the WASP (cid:98) - hairpin and helix ( Phe 258 , Leu267 , Leu 270 , Phe 271 , Ala 274 and Ile276 ) . The extensive Cdc42 – WASP interface results in burial of over twice as much total surface area as in the Rap1A – Raf ( ref . 5 ) complex ( 2 ; 930 (cid:54) 60 ˚A 2 versus 1 , 270 A˚ 2 ) . The WASP GBD has about 500 - fold greater afﬁnity for Cdc42 – GTP than for Cdc42 – GDP ( ref . 4 ) . Although high - resolution structures of the two Cdc42 states are not available , chemical shift comparisons 7 , as well as analogy to the Ras system , indicate that conformational differences will be localized primarily to switch I and switch II . Thus , contacts to these regions will mediate the sensitivity of WASP binding to the nucleotide switch . Cdc42 residues Phe 37 , Asn39 and Ala 41 , near the C terminus of switch I , form main - chain hydrogen bonds to WASP residues Val 250 , Val 247 / Ser 248 and Lys 245 , respectively ( Fig . 2c ) . These interac - tions position the Asp 38 side chain of Cdc42 near WASP residues His 246 and His 249 . There is a hydrogen bond from the Asp 38 carboxylate to either the His 246 or His 249 imidazole ring in nearly all members of the NMR ensemble . Disruption of these contacts through mutation of either the GTPase ( for example , Asp 38 to glutamate in Cdc42 ; ref . 8 ) or effector ( for example , His 208 to aspartate in N - WASP ; ref . 9 ) signiﬁcantly ( (cid:46) 50 - fold for Asp 38 to glutamate ) decreases the afﬁnity of Cdc42 and Rac for CRIB proteins in vitro and in vivo , explaining the high conservation of the two histidine residues throughout the CRIB effector family . Sheet - like intermolecular hydrogen bonds also position the side chain of conserved WASP residue Phe 244 in a shallow hydrophobic pocket between (cid:97) 1 and (cid:98) 2 of Cdc42 formed by Ile21 , Thr 25 and Tyr 40 . The importance of these interactions was shown by muta - genesis of Tyr 40 to cysteine or lysine in Cdc42 or Rac , which substantially decreases their afﬁnity for CRIB - containing targets 10 . The side chains of switch I residues Val 36 and Phe 37 form one side of an exposed hydrophobic surface of Cdc42 , with Phe 56 in (cid:98) 3 , and Leu67 and Leu 70 in switch II . This site interacts with the hydrophobic faces of the GBD C - terminal (cid:98) - hairpin and helix ( Fig . 2c ) with numerous intermolecular NOEs from Phe 37 and Phe 56 to WASP residues Val 260 , Leu 263 and Leu 267 ( see also Fig . 3 ) . These contacts are signiﬁcant to recognition , as elimination of the C - terminal GBD helix decreases afﬁnity for Cdc42 approxi - mately six - fold 4 . Preferential binding of WASP to Cdc42 – GTP thus appears to derive in part from polar and hydrophobic contacts involving highly conserved residues in the CRIB motif .

CRIB - family proteins bind activated Cdc42 and Rac , but not Rho 2 . Within the family there are variable levels of additional selectivity : proteins such as WASP , ACK and MRC kinase preferen - tially bind Cdc42 over Rac 3 , 11 , 12 , whereas others such as PAK discriminate little between the two GTPases 2 . The Cdc42 – WASP structure allows us to understand some aspects of these speciﬁcities . The three Rho - family members are identical in the switch I and switch II portions of the WASP - binding site , except at position 38 , which is aspartate in Cdc42 and Rac but glutamate in Rho ( Fig . 1b ) . Surprisingly , mutation of Asp 38 in Rac to glutamate 8 decreases the afﬁnity for the PAK GBD by a factor of 50 , probably by disrupting contacts to the conserved HXXH motif in the CRIB region , as already described . Thus , this single conservative difference appears to be important for mediating CRIB speciﬁcity against Rho . Biochemical evidence and sequence comparisons indicate that there may be additional speciﬁcity determinants in the C - terminal (cid:97) 5 helix of the GTPase 13 . Hydrophobic interactions anchor WASP residues 232 – 238 to the Cdc42 (cid:98) 2 / (cid:98) 3 hairpin and (cid:97) 5 helix ( Fig . 2d ) . WASP residue Ile233 , which is a hydrophobic amino acid in most CRIB proteins , packs into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Cdc42 residues Ile46 , Tyr51 , Leu 177 and Leu 174 , and the highly con - served Ile238 packs against Cdc42 residues Ile46 and Ile173 . A (cid:98) - turn in the GBD , stabilized by backbone and side - chain hydrogen bonds between Asp 237 and Ser 234 , then packs the hydrophobic portion of the Lys 235 sidechain of WASP against the Cdc42 Leu 174 sidechain . This arrangement positions the Lys 235 amine close to the carboxylate of Cdc42 Glu 171 , facilitating hydrogen - bond for - mation . In Rac and Rho , Leu174 is replaced by arginine , and Gly47 in the (cid:98) 2 / (cid:98) 3 hairpin is replaced by aspartate . Hydrogen bonding between these side chains , which is seen in activated Rac 14 and Rho 15 , closes off the pocket contacted by Ile233 of WASP , and would disrupt the hydrophobic contacts to Lys 235 . Thus , these differences may enhance the ability of WASP to distinguish Cdc42 from Rac and Rho . PAK , which has a similar afﬁnity for Cdc42 and Rac , contains a lysine at the position corresponding to Ile233 of WASP ( Fig . 1a ) , suggesting that it may interact differently with the GTPase in these regions . Thus , the extended nature of the WASP – GTPase interface may enable binding energy and speciﬁcity elements to be distributed in regions of Cdc42 that are modulated by nucleotide exchange and in more static portions of the molecule . In contrast , in the Ras family , nucleotide exchange and selectivity are intimately coupled , with a single residue in switch I at position 31 of Ras and Rap1A largely governing discrimination between Raf and RalGDS ( ref . 16 ) . The Cdc42 – ACK structure 17 shows similar interactions through - out the CRIB motif to those observed for Cdc42 – WASP , with both effectors extending the GTPase (cid:98) - sheet by an additional strand . However , interactions in regions outside the CRIB motif , particu - larly in the C termini of the two GBDs , are quite different . Such variability in extra - CRIB interactions may be a common theme in structures throughout the effector family . Sequence conservation outside the CRIB motif is very low ( Fig . 1a ) , and biochemical and structural data indicate that , like ACK , PAK contacts switch I more extensively than we observe for WASP . Thus , whereas PAK binding strongly inhibits nucleotide dissociation from Cdc42 ( ref . 8 ) , WASP has only a fourfold effect 4 . In addition , covalent modiﬁcation of the ribose ring of bound nucleotide ( proximal to Glu 31 / Tyr32 ) decreases the afﬁnity of PAK for Cdc42 approximately 30 - fold 8 , but has no effect on WASP binding 4 . Finally , an intermolecular NOE has been reported from the N - terminal region of switch I in Cdc42 to bound PAK 18 that is incompatible with the binding mode in the WASP complex . The functional explanation for these differences may lie in the speciﬁc mechanisms of signalling through WASP and PAK . In N - WASP , the GBD binds to and inhibits the actin depolymerization activity of an acidic C - terminal domain , an interaction postulated to involve the highly basic region immedi - ately N - terminal to the CRIB motif 9 . This inhibition is relieved through competitive binding of Cdc42 to the GBD . Similarly , in PAK , C - terminal regions of the GBD appear to regulate the serine / threonine kinase domain of the protein negatively , as mutation of 7 . 0 4 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 d 1 271 . a d ez 274 . a g 2 274 . b 271 . a 274 . b d 2 L67 . d 1 } 276 de } 271 } 258 de } 271 } 267 / 270 L70 . d 1 a b 1 H ( ppm ) Figure 3 Selected regions of a 13 C - ﬁltered NOESY spectrum recorded in D 2 O .

Thus , sequence divergence in the extra - CRIB regions , and the resulting variation in GTPase contacts , may reﬂect additional regulatory interactions with other enzymatic / functional domains in the effec - tors . Structural overlap between the intermolecular ( GTPase ) and intramolecular ( enzymatic domain ) binding sites of the GBD , and its thermodynamic consequences , could be subtle , and themselves subject to additional regulation . In both WASP and PAK , the GTPase - binding and enzymatic domains are separated by proline - rich sites that bind SH3 domains 21 , 22 . Ligation of these sites could modulate the thermodynamic balance in favour of activation or inhibition . Additional structures of CRIB proteins , both free and in complex with GTPases , will be needed to understand these thermo - dynamic and structural aspects of recognition and signalling through the Rho - family GTPases . The structure of a Cdc42 – WASP - GBD complex represents a ﬁrst step in this direction .

Methods Sample preparation . WASP and Cdc42 were overexpressed from vector pET11a in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) , and puriﬁed from bacterial lysate chromatographically . Uniform 15 N and 13 C labelling was achieved by growing bacteria in minimal medium supplemented with 15 NH 4 Cl and / or 13 C 6 - glucose as the solenitrogenand carbonsources . Deuterationwasachieved bygrowth in 50 – 99 . 9 % D 2 O with protonated ( 50 – 70 % 2 H samples ) or deuterated ( 99 . 9 % 2 H samples ) 13 C 6 - glucose . Selective methyl protonation of leucine , valine and isoleucine ( (cid:100) 1 ) in a deuterated background was obtained as described 23 . NMR spectroscopy . Spectra were recorded at 25 (cid:56) C on Varian Inova 600 or 800MHz spectrometers . Sequential assignments were obtained through the following 2 H - decoupled , triple - resonance spectra recorded on complexes with one unlabelled component and one 2 H ( 90 % ) / 15 N / 13 C - labelled component : CT - HNCa , CT - HN ( CO ) Ca , HN ( Ca ) Cb , HN ( COCa ) Cb , HNCO , HN ( Ca ) CO ( ref . 24 ) . Side - chain resonances were assigned using HCCH - TOCSY , CCC - TOCSY - NNH and HCC - TOCSY - NNH experiments recorded on protonated and 50 – 70 % random fractionally deuterated samples . Leucine , valine and isoleucine ( (cid:100) 1 ) methyl assignments for Cdc42 were obtained from a methyl - protonated , otherwise fully deuterated sample bound to unlabelled WASP using optimized HCC - and CCC - TOCSY - NNH experiments 25 . Aromatic protons were assigned through 2D 1 H - NOESY and 1 H - TOCSY spectra recorded in D 2 O on complexes with one protonated component and one deuterated component . NOEs were obtained from three - dimensional 15 N - edited , 15 N / 13 C - edited , 15 N - edited - 15 N / 13 C - ﬁltered and 13 C - edited - 15 N / 13 C - ﬁltered NOESY spectra ( (cid:116) mix of 40 , 75ms ) on complexes having only a single 15 N / 13 C - labelled component . Intermolecular NOEs identiﬁed in a complex of 15 N / 13 C - Cdc42 and 1 H - WASP were conﬁrmed using a sample with 1 H - Cdc42 and 15 N / 13 C - WASP . Intermolecular NOEs from Cdc42 methyl groups to WASP aromatic protons were conﬁrmed through a 13 C - edited - 13 C - ﬁltered NOESY spectrum recorded on a complex of 2 H / 13 C / methyl protonated Cdc42 and unlabelled WASP . Structure determination . For initial calculations , we used a torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol implemented in CNS 26 to dock the GBD onto coordinates of Cdc42 – GMPPNP derived from the crystal structure of the GTPase in complex with GMPPNP – Mg 2 + and rhoGAP ( unpublished coordinates provided by N . Nassar and R . Cerione ) through 382 intra - WASP and 170 intermolecular NOEs . These Cdc42 coordinates are similar to those of Rac – GMPPNP – Mg 2 + and Rho – GTP (cid:103) S – Mg 2 + ( backbone r . m . s . d . of 0 . 88A˚ and 1 . 01A˚ , respectively ) 14 , 15 . Structures from these calculations formed the basis for automated , iterative assignment of intra - Cdc42 and remaining intra - WASP NOEs using ARIA 27 . In addition to NOE data , calculations used 128 restraints for 64 intra - Cdc42 hydrogen bonds found in regular secondary structure elements in both the Cdc42 – GMPPNP – Mg 2 + – rhoGAP and Rac – GMPPNP – Mg 2 + structures 14 . InternalGTPasesidechainsin55residues , whose amide chemical shifts were not perturbed byWASP binding , were restrained to within (cid:54) 20 – 60 (cid:56) of their rotamers observed in the Cdc42 – GMPPNP – rhoGAP crystal structure . Nucleotide and Mg 2 + coordinates were ﬁxed in the calcula - tions , and restrained to Cdc42 by hydrogen bonds conserved in Ras - like GTPase structures . The (cid:120) 1 torsions of nine WASP and four Cdc42 side chains at the molecularinterface were restrained to (cid:54) 20 – 40 (cid:56) basedon patterns of local NOEs . A total of 16 WASP (cid:102) angles were restrained to (cid:54) 40 (cid:56) based on qualitative analysis of an HNHa - J experiment . We performed six rounds of calculations with ambiguous cut - off parameter , p ( ref . 27 ) , decreasing from 0 . 96to0 . 7 . Thiswasrepeatedseveraltimes , asintermolecularNOEswereadded manually . Late in the reﬁnement , we included 97 / 16 ( Cdc42 / WASP ) (cid:102) and 97 / 26 ( Cdc42 / WASP ) (cid:119) restraints , based on analysis of chemical shifts in the program TALOS 28 . Dihedrals were restrained to the maximum of 30 (cid:56) or twice the standard deviation observed in the TALOS database matches . We assessed structure quality with PROCHECK - NMR 29 .
