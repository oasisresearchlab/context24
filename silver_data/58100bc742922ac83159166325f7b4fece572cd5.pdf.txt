Torrance Test of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ) The creativity performance of each subject was measured using the figural version of Torrance Test of Creative Thinking ( TTCT - Figural ) ( Torrance 1966 ) . The TTCT - Figural measured fluency , originality , flexibility and elaboration , which were based on Guilford’s divergent - thinking factors ( Guilford , 1959 ; Torrance , 1996 ) . The TTCT - Figural comprises three parts : picture construction ( SI Fig . 1a ) , picture completion ( SI Fig . 1b ) , and repeated figures of lines ( SI Fig . 1c ) . In picture construction task , the subjects were asked to construct a creative picture that told a story based on a circle . In picture completion part , the subjects needed to complete 10 different lines to novel and interesting pictures . In repeated figures of lines part , subjects were asked to construct novel and meaningful pictures based on 10 pairs of parallel lines . Each part should be finished in ten minus . SI Fig . 1 . Samples of the figural version of Torrance Test of Creative Thinking The creativity scores are determined based on four measures : • Fluency : The number of relevant ideas ; shows an ability to produce a number of figural images . • Originality : The number of statistically infrequent ideas ; shows an ability to produce uncommon or unique responses . The scoring procedure counts the most common responses as 0 and all other legitimate responses as 1 . The originality lists have been prepared for each item on the basis of normative data , which are readily memorized by scorers . • Elaboration : The number of added ideas ; demonstrates the subject’s ability to develop and elaborate on ideas . • Flexibility : scored by the variety of categories of relevant responses 2 . Number of dynamic FC states To validate the robust of our results , we performed exploratory analyses of k of 3 and 5 . We obtained similar results that high creativity group ( HCG ) has more frequent transition among dynamic functional connectivity ( dFC ) states than low creativity group ( LCG ) . Specifically , for k = 3 , χ 2 ( 2 , N = 44 ) = 8 . 44 , p = 0 . 02 , post hoc analysis revealed that HCG had more frequent transition between dFC state 1 and state 2 than LCG ; for k = 5 , χ 2 ( 9 , N = 44 ) = 24 . 59 , p < 0 . 01 , post hoc analysis revealed that HCG had more frequent transition between dFC state 4 and state 5 than LCG . 3 . Validation using Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives To improve the confidence of our results , we performed a confirmatory analysis using ‘Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives’ . The MTD has been shown to be more sensitive than sliding window correlation methods in detecting dynamic alterations in connectivity structure and less susceptible to spurious connectivity , such as global mean signal fluctuations and head motion . The MTD estimated similar changes over time , specifically a positive value implies time series couple in the same direction ( either both increasing or both decreasing ) , however negative value represents anti - coupling ( one increasing while the other is decreasing ) . The value of the MTD can be interpretable as a signed and weighted adjacency matrix with each temporal window . To avoid the influence of high - frequency noise , we averaged MTD over a temporal window . Briefly , the MTD for the pairwise interaction between region i and j is defined according the following equation : 𝑀𝑇𝐷 𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 1 𝑤 ∑ ( 𝑑𝑡 𝑖𝑡 ×𝑑𝑡 𝑖𝑗 ) ( 𝜎 𝑑𝑡𝑖 ×𝜎 𝑑𝑡𝑗 ) 𝑡 + 𝑤 𝑡 ( S1 ) Where dt is the first temporal derivative of the i th or j th time series , σ is the stand deviation od the temporal derivative time series for region i or j , and w is the window length of the simple moving average . Given that we used a 0 . 15 - Hz low - pass filter , all signals with periods of 15 seconds or shorter would be removed from the data in theory . Therefore , we used a temporal window with window length of 15 time points to calculate the moving average of the MTD . The MTD can provide an estimation of time - varying functional connectivity . We calculated the spatial similarity of the adjacency matrix across all time points and subjects by using spatial Pearson’s correlations . We further applied the K - means cluster algorithm ( k = 4 ) to assigned each time point of each subject a cluster index . Statistical analysis was performed to validate whether the HCG has more frequent dFC states transition . 4 .
