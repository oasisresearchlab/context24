The interaction among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation in the condylar cartilage of TMJ - OA remains largely unknown . Method : In the present study , microarray - based transcriptome analysis was used to detect , and quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate transcriptome changes in the condylar cartilage from a well - established rat TMJ - OA model . Gene ontology ( GO ) , Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( KEGG ) pathway and protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) analyses were conducted . Result : There were 1817 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs , fold change ≥ 2 , p < 0 . 05 ) between TMJ - OA and control cartilages , with 553 up - regulated and 1 , 264 down - regulated genes . Among those genes , representative DEGs with known / suspected roles in innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation were further validated by enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways . The DEGs related to innervation were predominately enriched in the GO terms of neurogenesis , generation of neurons , and KEGG pathways of cholinergic synapse and neurotrophin signaling . Genes related to angiogenesis were enriched in GO terms of vasculature and blood vessel development , and KEGG pathways of hypoxia - inducible factor 1 ( HIF - 1 ) pathway and calcium signaling pathway . For in ﬂ ammation , the DEGs were enriched in the GO terms of immune system process and immune response , and KEGG pathways of Toll - like receptor and transforming growth factor β ( TGF β ) signaling . Analysis with PPI indicated that the aforementioned DEGs were highly - interacted . Several hub genes such as v - akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt1 ) , glycogen synthase kinase 3 β ( Gsk3b ) , ﬁ broblast growth factor 2 ( Fgf2 ) and nerve growth factor receptor ( Ngfr ) were validated . Conclusion : The present study demonstrated , for the ﬁ rst time , that intimate interactions exist among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation in the condylar cartilage of TMJ - OA .

This condition is one of the most complex temporomandibular disorders ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . The osteochondral junction in the TMJ comprises a calci ﬁ ed cartilage layer and a subchondral plate . In normal joints , the terminal blood vessels in the subchondral plate are in direct contact with , or in ﬁ ltrate the calci ﬁ ed cartilage . These vessels are rarely detected in the non - calci ﬁ ed cartilage beyond the tidemark ( i . e . , boundary between the calci ﬁ ed and non - calci ﬁ ed cartilage ) ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . In OA , blood vessels and nerve endings from the subchondral bone can breach the tidemark and cause channels to extend from the subchondral bone into the non - calci ﬁ ed cartilage ( Zhu et al . , 2019 ) . Pathological neurovascularization within the non - calci ﬁ ed cartilage damages the normal barrier between articular cartilage and subchondral bone . In ﬁ ltration of in ﬂ ammatory cells from the blood vessels disrupts chondrocyte function and degrades the cartilage matrix ( Findlay and Kuliwaba , 2016 ) . Pathological neurovascularization is also an essential component of endochondral ossi ﬁ cation ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . Alteration of the osteochondral junction further aggravates OA progression via direct involvement of innervation , angiogenesis , and in ﬂ ammation ( Jiao et al . , 2015 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ) . Angiogenesis and innervation are closely integrated processes in pathological conditions such as cancer and arthritis ( Jin et al . , 2020 ; Hu et al . , 2021 ) . In OA , perivascular nerve growth causes the sensory nerves within the cartilage to be exposed to chemical and mechanical stimulation , thereby contributing to osteoarthritic pain . Neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene - related peptide and substance p , in turn , act on speci ﬁ c vascular receptors to regulate blood ﬂ ow and permeability , as well as stimulating endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation to promote growth of the blood vessels . Sympathetic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y are also acute vasoconstrictors that increase blood ﬂ ow and promote angiogenesis ( Mapp and Walsh , 2012 ) . Apart from the contribution of blood vessel growth to in ﬂ ammation in arthritis , increased in ﬁ ltration of macrophages also provides a key stimulus for angiogenesis through the production of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Nerve growth regulators are also produced by vascular cells and in ﬂ ammatory cells in the perivascular environment ( Marrella et al . , 2018 ; Wan et al . , 2021 ) . Although the growth of blood vessels , nerves and the in ﬁ ltration of in ﬂ ammatory cells are closely interacting processes that share common regulatory pathways , information on the interactions of these three processes in the TMJ - OA cartilage is scanty ( Marrella et al . , 2018 ) . Previous work by the authors demonstrated that OA - like lesions were created by unilateral anterior crossbite ( UAC ) - induced dysregulated mechanical loading of rodent TMJs ( Sun J . - l . et al . , 2020 ; Sun et al . , 2020 J . L . ) . In the present study , pathologic changes in the blood vessels and nerves from the osteochondral junction to condylar cartilage of UAC mice were characterized . Microarray - based transcriptome analysis was used to select target genes involved in innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation in the cartilages of UAC mice and the corresponding control . Enrichment analysis and protein - protein interaction analysis were used to identify differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) that were associated with these processes . The hypothesis to be tested was that there is intricate crosstalk among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation during OA progression . MATERIALS AND METHODS Male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 140 – 160 g ; 6 - week - old ) were obtained from the animal center of the Air Force Medical University ( AFMU ) , Xi ’ an , China . Animal experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of AFMU , following the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . The procedures complied with ARRIVE 2 . 0 guidelines . Unilateral anterior crossbite appliances ( metal tubes ) were ﬁ tted to the jaws of the rats to induce osteoarthritic - like changes in their TMJ cartilage ( Jiao et al . , 2016 ) . In the control group , rats were subjected to the aforementioned procedures except for the bonding of the UAC appliances . Histochemical and Immunohistochemical Staining All rats were euthanized with pentobarbital overdose . A 3 × 4 mm tissue block that included the joint capsule and surrounding soft tissue was harvested gently from each rat . For hematoxylin - eosin and Safranin O / Fast Green staining , the tissue blocks were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , decalci ﬁ ed in 10 % ethylenediamine tetra - acetic acid and embedded in paraf ﬁ n . The TMJ was sectioned in the sagittal plane . The sections were mounted on poly - L - lysine - coated glass slides and deparaf ﬁ nized . Half of the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . For Safranin O / Fast Green staining , the sections were stained with 0 . 02 % Fast Green and subsequently with 0 . 1 % safranin O . The central sagittal sections of each TMJ section were used for examination . For immuno ﬂ uorescence staining , the specimens were sequentially ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and 30 % sucrose , embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) and stored at − 80 C . After blocked with 1 . 5 % goat serum ( MilliporeSigma , Burlington , MA ) , the sections were incubated with CGRP ( ab36001 , Abcam , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) or CD31 ( sc - 376764 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) primary antibodies and subsequently with secondary antibody ( US Everbright Inc . , Suzhou , China ) . The sections were rinsed with phosphate - buffered saline then mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant containing 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) . Images were acquired using laser scanning confocal microscopy ( FV1000 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org April 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 901749 2 Qin et al . Neurovascular Signals in TMJ - OA Cartilage Microarray Condylar cartilages were ground in liquid nitrogen . Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and puri ﬁ ed using a RNAeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . All specimens were treated on - column with DNase . The isolated total RNA was translated into cDNA and labeled with Cy3 using the Quick Amp Labeling kit ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) . After matched with the same concentration of RNA , the specimens were prepared for Whole Rat Genome Microarray ( 4 × 44K ; Agilent Technologies ) . The hybridization signal intensities were detected using a microarray scanner ( G2505C , Agilent ) . Signals were read , normalized and analyzed using the Feature Extraction 9 . 5 . 3 and GeneSpring GX10 software ( Agilent ) . The DEGs were identi ﬁ ed as fold change ≥ 2 ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Analyses with Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway ( Kanehisa et al . , 2019 ) were undertaken by the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ; Laboratory of Immunopathogenesis and Bioinformatics , SAIC , Frederick , Inc . , Frederick , MD ) . Analysis of protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) was undertaken by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes / Proteins ( STRING ; https : / / string - db . org / ) ( Szklarczyk et al . , 2019 ) and CytoScape ( version 3 . 9 . 0 , Institute of Systems Biology , Seattle , WA ; https : / / cytoscape . org / ) ( Shannon et al . , 2003 ) . Quantitative Real - Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) was performed as previously reported ( Ma et al . , 2022 ) . The following genes were used for qRT - PCR : v - akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt1 ) , glycogen synthase kinase 3 β ( Gsk3b ) , ﬁ broblast growth factor 2 ( Fgf2 ) and nerve growth factor receptor ( Ngfr ) . Glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Gapdh ) was used as the housekeeping gene for data normalization using the 2 – ΔΔ Ct method . GraphPad Prism 8 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) was used to examine if signi ﬁ cant difference in fold expressions of the tested genes existed between the UAC group and the control group . The Student ’ s t test was used for statistical analysis . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was preset at α = 0 . 05 . Because the four genes tested were derived from the same rat genome , the t - tests performed belonged to the same “ family ” of statistical procedures . The Bonferroni correction was used to control the familywise error rate to reduce the chance of obtaining false - positive conclusions . Accordingly , p values less than 0 . 05 / 4 = 0 . 013 were considered signi ﬁ cantly different for comparison of fold changes of the four genes between the UAC and control groups . RESULTS Validation of Cartilage Changes in Osteoarthritis Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining were used to characterize the rat TMJ - OA model ( Figure 1A ) . The condylar cartilage appeared normal in the control group , with four intact layers . The cartilage had an overall smooth surface and contained homogenously - distributed chondrocytes . The UAC group manifested OA - like changes such as the loss of cartilage surface integrity , abnormal thickening of the four cartilage layers and cellular derangement . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the changes within the right and left condylar cartilage in the UAC group . Pathological neurovascularization , in the form of new erythrocyte - containing blood vessels and nerves , in ﬁ ltrated the osteochondral junction into the non - calci ﬁ ed condylar cartilage in the TMJ - OA rat model . Differential Gene Expression in the Condylar Cartilage Of the 4 , 650 genes detectable using the Whole Rat Genome Microarray , 1817 signi ﬁ cant DEGs with fold change ≥ 2 ( p < 0 . 05 ) were detected in the condylar cartilage of the UAC group . Among the DEGs , 553 genes were up - regulated and 1 , 264 genes were down - regulated . Speci ﬁ c DEGs related to innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation are depicted in Supplementary Appendix Table S1 – S4 , respectively . The heatmap and bar chart in Figure 1B showed the fold changes in selected genes expressed by the condylar cartilage in the UAC group versus the control group . Enrichment Analysis of Differential Gene Expression GO term enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were performed on innervation - related , angiogenesis - related and in ﬂ ammation - related genes to obtain more detailed information on correlated pathways and their potential functions . The KEGG pathways ( Figure 2 ) and GO terms ( Figure 3 ) related to innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation are presented in the order of enriched factor . Genes related to innervation were enriched in several classical KEGG pathways such as dopaminergic synapse , cholinergic synapse and neurotrophin signaling pathway ( Figure 2A ) . Genes related to angiogenesis were enriched in the AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , hypoxia - inducible factor ( HIF ) - 1 and calcium signaling pathways ( Figure 2B ) . Genes related to in ﬂ ammation were enriched in the cationic antimicrobial peptide ( cAMP ) signaling pathway , Toll - like receptor signaling pathway and in ﬂ ammatory mediator regulation of transient receptor potential ( TRP ) channels ( Figure 2C ) . The top three enriched GO terms related to innervation were regulation of synapse structure or activity , negative regulation of neuron death , and regulation of neuron apoptotic process ; additional enriched terms are depicted in Figure 3A . The top three enriched GO terms related to angiogenesis were positive regulation of vasodilation , VEGF receptor signaling pathway , and VEGF signaling pathway ; additional enriched terms are depicted in Figure 3B . The top three enriched GO terms related to in ﬂ ammation were regulation of macroautophagy , activation of innate immune response , and positive regulation of innate Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org April 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 901749 3 Qin et al . Neurovascular Signals in TMJ - OA Cartilage immune response ; additional enriched terms are depicted in Figure 3C . Among the 30 GO terms related to innervation , 12 terms were related to synapse and axons , suggesting that neurotransmitters are involved in the extension of neurons into the condylar cartilage . Angiogenesis was not only closely related to the angiogenic factors but was related also to classical signaling pathways including AMPK , MAPK , PI3K - Akt , and NF - kappa B signaling . The enriched GO terms related to in ﬂ ammation identi ﬁ ed a possible role for T cells , based on their frequency of occurrence . Protein - Protein Interaction ( PPI ) Network Analysis of DEGs The STRING database and Cytoscape were to analyze PPI to detect hub genes ( i . e . , genes with high correlation in candidate modules ) among the selected genes . The innervation - related genes ( Figure 4A ) , angiogenesis - related genes ( Figure 4B ) and in ﬂ ammation - related genes ( Figure 4C ) were ﬁ rst analyzed separately . All selected genes were then analyzed together to further validate their interactions ( Figure 4D ) . Different colors on the dot represented different functions . Different dot sizes represented closeness ( i . e . , the larger the point , the closer the relationship ) . The interrelated genes identi ﬁ ed included Akt1 , Igf1r , Vegfa , Pik3cb , Ngfr , Mapk8 , Mapk12 , Actb , Fgf2 , Gsk3b , Ccl2 , and Jun . Remarkably , Akt1 and Gsk3b participated in all the three processes - innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation . Akt1 , Igf1r and Vegfa shared several pathways , including PI3K - Akt signaling pathway , MAPK signaling pathway and HIF - 1 signaling pathway . These results revealed the strong interactions among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation in the TMJ - OA cartilage . qRT - PCR To con ﬁ rm the ﬁ ndings of the microarray analysis , qRT - PCR was conducted on four genes involved in innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation ( Akt1 , Fgf2 , Gsk3b , Ngfr ) . The expression pro ﬁ les of these genes had a good match for the results obtained by microarray analysis ( Figure 5 ) . Minor differences were attributed to the heterogeneity of OA between individual animals . The qRT - PCR results validated the accuracy of the microarray data and supported that changes in innervation - related , angiogenesis - related and in ﬂ ammation - related genes were detected in the condylar cartilage of OA rats .

Neurovascular Signals in TMJ - OA Cartilage DISCUSSION Neurovascularization within the non - calci ﬁ ed cartilage is a critical pathological change in OA ( Mapp and Walsh , 2012 ; Li B . et al . , 2021 ) . In the present study , pathological neurovascularization was validated in TMJ - OA cartilage . Microarray analysis of genes from the condylar cartilage of TMJ identi ﬁ ed 1817 signi ﬁ cant DEGs between the control and UAC groups . Based on their functions , target genes involved in innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation were selected for further analyses . After enrichment analysis and PPI analysis , the robust interactions among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation were con ﬁ rmed in the condylar cartilage of TMJ - OA . Several other microarray analyses about osteoarthritis cartilage also supported our ﬁ ndings . One of which was carried out on IL - 1 β - stimulated chondrocytes to identify the potential biological processes in the progression of osteoarthritis ( Liang et al . , 2022 ) . Similarly , they found DEGs were mainly enriched in these terms , including “ in ﬂ ammatory response ” , “ blood vessel morphogenesis ” , “ epithelial cell proliferation ” and so on . However , different from our results , the terms about neurogenesis were not included in that research , which may because the subject of our research was cartilage from animal while that of their research was cultured chondrocyte . Another analysis about OA cartilage also found the changes in PI3K / Akt signaling pathway played an important role , which supporting our results ( Li S . et al . , 2021 ) . The contribution of angiogenesis to OA progression has been investigated extensively . Osteochondral angiogenesis was observed in mandibular condyles with OA - like changes , with concomitant local up - regulation of VEGF , connective tissue growth factor and matrix metalloprotease - 9 ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . Growth factors such as Vegfa , Vegfb , Pdgf , and Angpt1 are promoters of angiogenesis ( MacDonald et al . , 2018 ) ; these factors were up - regulated in OA cartilage and down - regulated in the control . Both VEGFa and VEGFb are members of the VEGF family . These angiogenesis regulators act on endothelial cells and pericytes around blood vessels . Platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , a pro - angiogenic factor derived from preosteoclasts in the subchondral bone , directly induces proliferation of endothelial cells to form type H vessels and stimulates VEGF secretion ( Su et al . , 2020 ) . Angiopoietin 1 ( ANGPT1 ) is a vascular growth factor that controls endothelial sprouting by regulating vascular stability . It interacts with tyrosine - protein kinase receptor 2 ( TIE2 ) to activate several signaling pathways , including the PI3K / AKT pathway , to ensure endothelial FIGURE2 | TheKyotoEncyclopediaofGenesandGenomes ( KEGG ) pathwaysenrichedforthetargetedgenes .

Neurovascular Signals in TMJ - OA Cartilage survival and junctional stability ( Saharinen et al . , 2017 ) . With the use of KEGG analysis , the MAPK , HIF - 1 and nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - κ B ) signaling pathways were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in the DEGs . Regulated by the MAPK and NF - κ B pathways , HIF - 1 α upregulates VEGFa expression and promotes type H vessel formation ( Fernandez et al . , 2017 ) . Hence , the present data con ﬁ rm that angiogenesis is involved in TMJ - OA progression . Because angiogenesis contributes to synovitis , osteochondral damage , and osteophyte formation in patients with TMJ - OA , inhibition of angiogenesis is potentially useful for treatment of TMJ - OA . In ﬁ ltration of sensory nerves and sympathetic nerves through the osteochondral junction into cartilage occurs after in ﬂ ammation and angiogenesis in TMJ - OA ( Zylinska et al . , 2021 ) . Subchondral bone deterioration through increased bone remodeling and nerve sprouting has been identi ﬁ ed in the osteochondral junction of osteoarthritic joints and is closely associated with osteoarthritic pain in OA rats ( Sun J . - l . et al . , 2020 ) . Although the role of sensory nerves and sympathetic nerves in OA has been well demonstrated , pathological innervation in TMJ - OA cartilage requires further studies . The present study demonstrated up - regulation of Ngfr in the condylar cartilage of TMJ - OA . This factor induces pain through ampli ﬁ ed proliferation of sensory neurons that alter the pain threshold ( Jiang et al . , 2015 ) . Others reported that gene deletion of NGF produced pain - palliative effects ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Apart from innervation , NGF / NGFR also stimulates the expression of VEGF and promotes vascular growth . This accounts for the link between angiogenesis and innervation in TMJ - OA . Examination of articular cartilages harvested from healthy and OA patients identi ﬁ ed that NGF increased angiogenesis by promoting the expression of FGF2 via PI3K / Akt and ERK / MAPK signaling pathways ( Yu et al . , 2019 ) . Identi ﬁ cation of the up - regulation of Adrb2 and Adra2a genes in the UAC group is indicative of the penetration of sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers into the cartilage during TMJ deterioration . Further studies are needed to con ﬁ rm this ﬁ nding and clarify the role of pathological innervation in TMJ - OA cartilage . Because the interactions among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation contribute to structural damage and pain in TMJ - OA , interception of these interactions offer potential conduits for relieve of symptoms and prevent joint pathology in TMJ - OA . For example , inhibiting in ﬂ ammation and reducing cartilage innervation produce direct symptomatic bene ﬁ ts for OA patients . Inhibition of angiogenesis reduces pain by moderating each of these pathological processes . Apart from targeting the nervous system , potential nano - therapies that target blood vessels or in ﬂ ammation also help to relieve pain symptoms ( Li X . et al . , 2021 ) . Although treatment strategies that individually target angiogenesis ( Li et al . , 2019 ; Yajun et al . , 2021 ) , FIGURE3 | GeneOntology ( GO ) analysisenrichedforthetargetedgenes .

Neurovascular Signals in TMJ - OA Cartilage pain or in ﬂ ammation ( Lee et al . , 2014 ; Bhalekar et al . , 2016 ) are casually effective in alleviating OA symptoms , therapies that explicitly target the crosstalk among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation may potentially become the therapeutic target of the future . The gene expression pro ﬁ les of TMJ - OA identi ﬁ ed in the present study may not completely match those reported by other studies . This may be attributed to the limitations inherent in the present study . These results we obtained were merely based on limited sample size ( four in each group ) , leading to dif ﬁ culty in excluding false positive . With the development of scienti ﬁ c technology , bulk RNA - sequencing , single - cell RNA - sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have become feasible over the last few years . These timely techniques have become extremely popular assays for transcriptome measurements . In the future , high - throughput sequencing technology should be applied to examine the mechanism of TMJ - OA . It is imperative to mention that differences exist between animal models and human versions of TMJ - OA . Results obtained from animal models should be tested prior to their translation for treatment of human diseases . In conclusion , the highly interactive crosstalk among innervation , angiogenesis and in ﬂ ammation in the condylar cartilage is a contributor to disease progression in TMJ - OA . This crosstalk offers possible directions for future research on therapeutics to address TMJ - OA .
