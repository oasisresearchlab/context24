Supporting Fast Design : The Potential of Hackathons for Co - Creative Systems Jeanette Falk jeanette . falk - olesen @ plus . ac . at Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces , University of Salzburg Salzburg , Austria Faith Young faith @ rocketyoung . com Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces , University of Salzburg Salzburg , Austria ABSTRACT In this paper , we argue for the potential and relevance of modelling novel AI co - creative systems after key aspects which characterises the specific kind of design processes unfolding in hackathons . There has recently been an increased interest into the potentials and chal - lenges of creative collaborations between humans and AI , however , there have not been many practical implementations of co - creative systems . We argue that by designing co - creative systems to support the specific kind of creative design work in hackathons , valuable contributions can be made in the context of an overlooked aspect in interaction design ; how to support fast design thinking . The speci - ficity of hackathon participation involves high demands for fast idea generation , decision - making , and prototyping , which ideally ends in a functioning and novel prototype . Specifically , we identify three key characteristics of hackathon participation , and for each characteristic we discuss how they may model Human - AI interac - tion in the context of co - creative systems for fast design thinking . The contribution of this paper is to provide future research on co - creative systems with inspiration grounded in the parallels between aspects of AI and key characteristics of hackathon participation .

[ 30 ] . In creativity research , the role of time and temporality in creativity is contested , especially in terms of speed and acceleration [ 44 ] ; e . g . , meeting strict deadlines has been found to be positive for focused idea generation [ 16 ] , and at the same time harmful for the creative process [ 7 ] particularly in regards to incubation [ 2 ] . In a society which has been described as involving the “acceleration of just about everything” [ 17 ] , Simpson argues that theories of time and temporal theories are increasingly urgent and can provide new insights into empirical dilemmas such as the above - mentioned [ 44 ] . Similarly for HCI and interaction design , despite temporality constituting a key dimension of HCI as it is essential for almost all types of computing and interaction [ 46 ] , there is still only little attention paid to how “participation in the design of IT unfolds over time” [ 42 ] . Although there has been a movement in the area of slow design processes [ 22 ] and interaction design [ 19 , 33 , 45 ] , only a small — but growing — amount of research has been conducted on understanding and supporting short term and accelerated design processes [ 12 , 13 ] , during which participants engage with what has been called fast design thinking [ 25 ] . The definition of creativity underlying this paper follows Plucker et al . ’s understanding of creativity which is “the interaction among aptitude , process , and environment by which an individual or group produces a perceptible product that is both novel and useful as de - fined within a social context ” [ 36 ] . We furthermore follow the defini - tion of computational co - creativity or co - creative systems described by Karimi et al . [ 27 ] ; i . e . , co - creativity is when humans and at least one AI agent collaborate to build shared creative artefacts . Participation in hackathons is a phenomenon that offers creativ - ity and interaction design research to explore a situationality [ 14 ] and specificity that enable us to better understand the effects of considerably shortening the creative design process while still en - gaging participants in key design activities such as generating ideas to finalising a functioning prototype . Hackathons — and hackathon - like events such as game jams [ 34 ] — are design events which are typically organised with a short time frame , for instance only 48 hours , though the formats and time frames may vary [ 10 ] . A theme , goal , or a design challenge is revealed in the beginning of the hackathon , and participants team up in smaller groups ( often with people they do not know beforehand ) and work on a project that addresses the theme , goal , or design challenge . In other words , a hackathon “includes an initial divergence in order to search for and understand a problem , convergence onto a specific design op - portunity , divergence during the development of the solution , a final convergence via testing of the design and preparation and 515 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Jeanette Falk and Faith Young delivery of a final pitch” [ 13 ] , hence generally following a double diamond structure [ 6 ] . It has even been argued that “the resulting design activity [ in hackathons , ed . ] is more authentic than what is commonly studied in controlled experiments” [ 13 ] , because of the nature of the design process itself , participants’ self - motivation , and personal interest – though the design activity is arguably still uniquely constrained especially in terms of the time constraint . Another motivation for focusing on hackathons in the context of exploring co - creative systems is the fact that practitioners gen - erally find it difficult to understand capabilities of AI [ 8 , 23 , 47 ] . While some AI tools , methods and aids support practitioners in e . g . evaluation phases of design processes [ 23 ] , few have also explored how practitioners may “generate a greater number of novel and diverse concepts for the AI domain in the early conceptual design phase” [ 23 ] . In their review of literature on AI and whether , why and how Human - AI interaction is particularly difficult to design , Yang et al . identify a theme to facilitate the design of human - AI in - teraction as “creating AI - specific design processes” [ 47 ] . With these contributions in mind and in an attempt to create an AI - specific design process , focusing on generating concepts for AI designers , we follow a similar approach to that of Rezwana and Maher who contribute with a framework for modeling interaction in Human - AI co - creative systems : “A good starting point to investigate questions about interaction modeling is studying creative collaboration in humans ( Davis et al . 2015 ) . Understanding the factors of human collaboration can be a tool to build the foundation for the develop - ment of systems that can augment or enhance creativity in humans ( Mamykina , Candy , and Edmonds 2002 ) ” [ 40 ] . Taken together , we hence propose exploring participants’ creative collaboration in hackathons as a tool for understanding and building the founda - tion of co - creative systems for supporting fast design thinking in general and hackathon participation specifically . In this context , we make two early stage research contributions : First , we identify three key characteristic traits for hackathon par - ticipation and argue how designing co - creative systems tailored for the specific kind of design work that participants undergo in hackathons can generate valuable contributions not only to improv - ing hackathon participation specifically but also to understanding fast design thinking more generally . Second , based on these charac - teristics , we discuss how AI may play a role in co - creative systems and support hackathon participation in particular and thereby fast design thinking in general . 2 HACKATHON PARTICIPATION A unique aspect of participating in hackathon formats is the per - vasive time pressure of the intentionally short deadline which ar - guably prompts more of what can be called fast design thinking [ 13 ] . Recently , Kannengiesser and Gero described a framework for fast and slow design thinking [ 25 ] , based on Kahneman’s dual - system theory in cognitive psychology , known as System 1 and System 2 thinking [ 24 ] . System 1 is a kind of fast and effortless thinking , which can be prone to cognitive bias , while System 2 is a slower , more analytical way of thinking , and requires greater cognitive ef - fort than System 1 [ 24 ] . In exploring fast and slow design thinking , they argue “if dual - system theory plays a role in design , then tool support for system 1 and system 2 design thinking is likely to differ” [ 25 ] . In addition to the role which design tools — or co - creative systems— may play for fast design thinking , speed can also play a role in how people collaborate and work together . Edmondson coined the term teaming as a kind of team collaboration which is flexible enough to address the speed of today’s rapidly changing world image and which can support accelerating organisations’ responses to new challenges . Teaming is “a way to get work done while figuring out how to do it better ; it’s executing and learn - ing at the same time” [ 9 ] . From our experience , this kind of group dynamic reflects how people participate in hackathons . Hence , hackathon participation involves high demands for fast idea gener - ation , decision - making , and prototyping . Based on our combined experience of both participating in and organising 13 hackathons and hackathon - like events ( such as game jams and design sprints ) , as well as more than four years of re - search focusing on various aspects of hackathons and hackathon - like events , we now identify three key characteristic aspects of hackathon participation : ( 1 ) Interdisciplinary Teaming ( 2 ) Decision - Making under Time Pressure ( 3 ) Creating Perceptible Prototypes Somewouldperhapsargueforother characteristics forhackathon participation that could help model Human - AI interaction . We , however , frame these particular characteristics as the most promi - nent ones and suggest them as initial point of departures to model human - AI interaction . 3 HACKATHON PARTICIPATION MODELLING HUMAN - AI INTERACTION IN CO - CREATIVE SYSTEMS In discussing how AI may support hackathon participation and fast design thinking , we consider Schneiderman’s design principles for creativity support tools ( CST ) as they serve as a solid foun - dation for supporting creativity in general [ 43 ] , though CST’s do not necessarily include AI such as in co - creative systems [ 27 ] . In the following sections , we engage with some related works on the topics of Human - AI interaction in the areas of especially cre - ativity , collaboration , interaction and decision - making . We take a speculative approach and for each characteristic , we envision and discuss the role which AI could play in a co - creative system in the context of the respective characteristics . Ultimately , we envision that co - creative systems based on the discussed characteristics will contribute to not only supporting participation in hackathons , but also to how fast design thinking in general may be supported . 3 . 1 Interdisciplinary Teaming Hackathons are often interdisciplinary events , where people of dif - ferent backgrounds can collaborate on projects [ 41 ] . It is straightfor - ward to point to Schneiderman’s CST design principles for enabling collaboration as well as to design “with low thresholds , high ceilings , and wide walls” [ 43 ] , the latter suggesting that tools should be easy to begin using for novices , but that it should provide ambitious 516 Supporting Fast Design : The Potential of Hackathons for Co - Creative Systems C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy functionality for experts as well . In the context of citizens con - tributing to citizen science , Rafner et al . argue that AI could be used to “broaden accessibility by automatically adapting to the diverse needs and skills of participants” [ 38 ] . In a recent keynote talk , Ger - ber asked how AI could optimise group formations in hackathons [ 15 ] . Although perhaps intended as a provocation for the audience , we can envision how automating and , in a way , optimising group formation could potentially broaden accessibility by matching par - ticipants with diverse needs and skills with others . This may also improve long - term hackathon project continuation ; In a recent study , Nolte et al . found that the skill match of a hackathon team ( i . e . , the fit between a team’s skills and the requirements of a project ) and skill diversity ( i . e . , team members possessing different skills ) “are significantly associated with long - term project continuation” [ 32 ] . Recently , Baum envisioned the concept of artificial interdisci - plinarity ( A - ID ) — i . e . AI that “performs interdisciplinary research or supports other agents in the performance of interdisciplinary research” [ 3 ] — in the context of interdisciplinary research ( IDR ) [ 3 ] . Although hackathon participation cannot necessarily be de - fined as IDR , some of the identified challenges related to IDR and discussed potentials related to A - ID may serve as inspiration for sup - porting interdisciplinary collaboration in hackathons . For example , participants coming from different disciplines ( such as program - ming , design , art , etc . ) may approach “the same topic from different perspectives , using different conceptual paradigms and different language . ” [ 3 ] . Similar to Baum’s discussion , we can envision how search engines —already a common form of A - ID used for navigat - ing massive literature— can be improved to identify terminology across disciplines [ 3 ] ; “When searching for literature on an unfa - miliar topic , identifying the right keywords to search for can be a major impediment” [ 3 ] . Synonym identification is here a relevant capability of AI [ 3 , 31 ] . For example , participants may sometimes engage with topics that are not familiar to them during a hackathon . At the same time , hackathons often involve participants in teaming processes , where they collaborate with unfamiliar team members from other disciplines and together they collaborate on design ac - tivities . This may be difficult to manage while also having to learn about an unfamiliar topic . We envision how identifying terminol - ogy across disciplines through improved search engines [ 3 ] may support team members in getting to know each others’ skills as well as in learning about unfamiliar topics during the hackathon . 3 . 2 Decision - Making under Time Pressure An aspect that greatly characterises hackathon participation is the time pressure from the short duration of the design event . Research on hackathon - like formats described how significantly shortening the time frame of the design format prompts participants to make design decisions quickly with only little or no time for reflection or incubation of design ideas , while participants often rely on combi - national creativity [ 5 ] gained from quick and associative thinking [ 11 ] . Kahneman studied how fast System 1 thinking can introduce different kinds of biases [ 24 ] . System 2 requires more cognitive effort than System 1 , and one of the tasks of System 2 is “to over - come the impulses of System 1” [ 24 ] . Resisting biases is possible , but tiresome as effort has to be made in order to reconsider one’s own impressions and intuitions [ 24 ] . AI can challenge our think - ing and overcome limitations and biases such as “poor handling of probabilities , entrenchment , short termism , confirmation bias , functional fixedness , stereotypes , in - group favoritism , and so forth” [ 1 ] . One of Schneiderman’s design principles revolves around sup - porting exploratory search [ 43 ] . One way of doing this is “viewing many relevant examples of previous work to engage innovators in a creative mind - set” [ 43 ] . Here , it is straightforward to again point towards search engines , which Schneiderman also discuss in this context . Searching for inspiration sources using search engines is considered central to creative design [ 4 , 21 ] . However , view - ing only similar examples may increase design fixation [ 37 ] : “the tendency to reproduce certain elements from examples they have seen” [ 20 ] . Hence , Herring et al . recommend not always to “or - der search results based solely on similarity to the query” but also show dissimilar results [ 20 ] . In the area of computational creativity and evolutionary art , there are several examples on systems that generate artistic outcomes , which are then subjectively judged — or searched— by humans in terms of quality or “fitness” , a cycle that is is repeated until a satisfactory outcome is obtained [ 29 ] . A recent example on how AI can potentially support a divergent phase of exploratory search in the beginning of a hackathon , is explored by Karimi et al . [ 28 ] . They present a computational tool for sketching , where an AI model maps an input sketch from a user into another categorically different sketch which shares structural and semantic characteristics [ 28 ] . The user controls how similar visual and conceptual components the AI model should produce in order to inspire their own sketch , thus helping the user iterate on their sketches . They found that the AI tool supported design ideation and overcoming fixation [ 28 ] . There is potential for AI tools to alleviate some of the challenges that decision - making under time pressure may entail . So far we have discussed two kinds of interaction modalities [ 26 ] ; textual input for search engines , and visual inputs such as sketches . An example of an AI tool which combines these two modalities is DALL·E 2 described as “a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language” [ 35 ] . We envision an AI tool such as DALL·E 2 during hackathons , e . g . by supporting participants’ exploratory and visual search . For example , hackathon participants may write a description of core aspects of their idea in natural language or the design challenge which they seek to address , and get inspiration from the visual output of the system . 3 . 3 Creating Perceptible Prototypes Lastly , we want to highlight how ideally novel and functioning artefacts — e . g . software or hardware prototypes — are created in hackathons . The fast design thinking that characterises participa - tion in hackathons can mean that participants are more likely to rely on existing skills , templates and resources , and personal networks , and — similar to observations in rapid institutional development when there is little time between events and responses — “Rather than learning or developing new sources of information , they take ‘off the shelf’ examples” [ 18 ] , This contributes to the unfolding of hackathon participation as a form of teaming [ 9 ] . Hence , there is a 517 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Jeanette Falk and Faith Young close relation between idea generation and the prototyping phase of a hackathon , since participants rely on their own skills to mate - rialise an abstract idea into something concrete which illustrates the idea . While this is then closely related to the characteristic of interdisciplinary teaming , here , we highlight what this aspect may also entail for creating a perceptible prototype and how AI could play a role . We have already seen how an AI tool such as the one presented by Karimi et al . [ 28 ] works with recognition of visual user input sketches and generation of new inspirational sketches ; How could AI support the transition from sketches to physical prototypes ? One common AI design heuristic is recommendation [ 23 ] ; could an AI system recommend ways to realise visual design sketches into physical prototypes , by suggesting hardware parts or fabrication methods ? Other AI design heuristics are recognition , judging and evaluation [ 23 ] ; Could an AI system recognise , judge , and evalu - ate hackathon participants’ sketches or physical prototypes , for example , by utilising computer vision and object recognition ? 4 CONCLUSION Hackathons impose specific constraints on participation , and by exploring these in modelling potential Human - AI interactions in co - creative systems , future research may contribute to understanding how not only hackathon participation can be supported but also fast design thinking . We highlight three characteristics for hackathon participation : Interdisciplinary teaming , decision - making under time pressure , and creating perceptible prototypes . To further ex - plore how to model Human - AI Interaction for novel co - creative systems for supporting fast design thinking , we plan future studies to engage deeper with hackathon participation .
