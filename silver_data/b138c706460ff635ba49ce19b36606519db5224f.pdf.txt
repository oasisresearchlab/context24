Fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled dextran ( FD ) is endocytized and accu - mulates in lysosomes where it remains without apparent deg - radation . The fluorescence spectrum of this compound changes with pH in the range 4 - 7 and is not seriously affected by FD concentration , ionic strength , or protein concentration . Living cells on coverslips are mounted in a spectrofluorometer cell and can be perfused with various media . The normal pH inside macrophage lysosomes seems to be 4 . 74 . 8 , although it can drop transiently as low as 4 . 5 . Exposure of the cells to various weak bases and to acidic potassium ionophores causes the pH to in - crease . The changes in pH are much more rapid than is the in - tralysosomal accumulation of the weak bases . Inhibitors of glycolysis ( - deoxyglucose ) and of oxidative phosphorylation ( cyanide or azide ) added together , but not separately , cause the intralysosomal pH to increase . These results provide evidence for the existence of an active proton accumulation mechanism in the lysosomal membrane and support the theory of lysosomal accumulation of weak bases by proton trapping . There have been conflicting reports and theories about the pH inside lysosomes . This controversy has been the subject of a review by Tager and Reijngoud ( 1 ) . Isolated lysosomes have an internal pH about 1 unit lower than that of the medium , ap - parently as a consequence of a Donnan equilibrium ( 2 - 4 ) . However , there is some evidence of an energy - dependent mechanism that is capable of lowering the pH ( 5 , 6 ) . In living cells , various weakly basic substances are concentrated in ly - sosomes as a consequence of lysosomal acidity ( 7 ) . When the intralysosomal concentration of these substances becomes suf - ficiently high , the lysosomes swell osmotically to form large vacuoles ( 8 , 9 ) . Vacuoles of similar appearance have been ob - served in cells exposed to the acidic ionophore X537A ( 10 ) . Attempts have been made to estimate the pH inside lyso - somes by visual inspection of color changes in pH indicator dyes ( see ref . 1 ) . Here we describe a quantitative method for the measurement of intralysosomal pH based on the pH - dependent fluorescence signals from fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled dextran ( FD ) in the lysosomes of living cells . Control experi - ments indicate that these signals should provide an accurate measure of pH . We report the results of some measurements of pH in the lysosomes of living cells under various conditions that support the existence of an active process of pH mainte - nance and provide some confirmation of the theory of pH - dependent concentration of certain substances in lysosomes ( 7 ) .

Fluorescence was measured with a Perkin - Elmer - Hitachi MPF - 4 in ratio mode . Coverslips on which cells were growing were mounted in the holding device illustrated in Fig . 1 . The holding device was inserted into a standard fluorescence cell and the cell was perfused with a thermostated solution con - taining the salts , glucose , and pyruvate of Eagle ' s medium plus various additions . All solutions were adjusted to pH 7 . 6 . Serum and vitamins usually were omitted from the perfusion fluid because they interfered with the fluorescence measure - ments . In uptake experiments , cells were exposed to the compound in question for various lengths of time and then washed four times with Hanks ' solution ( 13 ) . For the assay of chloroquine uptake , the cells were then dissolved in 0 . 1 M NaOH / 0 . 4 % so - dium deoxycholate . For the assay of [ 14C ] methylamine uptake the cells were extracted twice with 4 ml of 5 % trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved . Protein was measured by the auto - mated Lowry procedure ( 14 ) . Chloroquine was assayed fluo - rometrically . Scintillation counting was performed in Triton / toluene / 2 , 5 - diphenyloxazole . FD ( average molecular weight 67 , 000 ) was purchased from Sigma . Nigericin and X537A were generous gifts from Eli Lilly Co . and Hoffmann - La Roche Inc . , respectively . RESULTS Fluorescence characteristics of FD Fig . 2 shows the excitation spectra of solutions of FD at various pHs . The alkaline spectrum is dominated by a large peak at 495 nm . As the pH is lowered , this peak dies away and is replaced by two new , much lower , peaks at 480 and 450 nm . The in - tensity of the 495 - nm peak could be used as a measure of pH , provided one knew exactly how much FD is being illuminated and provided the solvent remained the same . However , as shown in Fig . 3 , a much better measure of pH is the ratio of fluorescence measured with excitation at 495 nm to that with excitation at 450 nm , to be referred to henceforth as the 495 / 450 ratio . We found that overall fluorescence intensity changes somewhat depending on the buffer used but the shape of the excitation spectrum remains almost constant at a given pH . The effects of ionic strength ( Fig . 3 ) and bovine serum albumin ( 200 mg / ml ) were small ( < 0 . 1 pH unit ) . Even at FD concentrations as high as 30 mg / ml , the fluorescence signals remained almost the same . In the work we describe below , we used the fluorescence intensity at 495 nm to follow rapid changes in intralysosomal pH and the 495 / 450 ratio to follow Abbreviation : FD , fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled dextran . 3327 3328 Cell Biology : Ohkuma and Poole Medium out Medium in Excitation light FIG . 1 .

An excitation spectrum of FD within the lysosomes of living cells is shown in Fig . 4 . The difference between the signals from cells with and without FD also is shown and is indistinguishable from a spectrum of FD at pH 4 . 75 calculated by interpolation of the data of Fig . 2 . We took cells out of complete medium containing 20 % serum , washed them briefly in the salts , glucose , and pyruvate of Eagle ' s medium and then placed them in the coverslip holder in the perfusion chamber in the same solution . After such treatment the intralysosomal pH in a large number of experi - ments was always 4 . 5 + 0 . 1 . However , as illustrated in Fig . 5A , after further incubation in the chamber , the intralysosomal pH always increased to about 4 . 8 and then remained constant . When amino acids were included in the washing and perfusion medium , the intralysosomal pH remained about 4 . 9 . When the perfusion medium was changed to one without amino acids , there was a transient decrease in the intralysosomal pH to about 4 . 5 , with a gradual return to a stable value of 4 . 8 ( Fig . SB ) . As will be shown below , a similar transient low pH is observed when cells exposed to low concentrations of ammonia are washed with ammonia - free solution . 3 : t 0 D t2 c 0 + 1 c 0 0I 0 0 a5 500 450 400 Excitation wavelength , nm FIG . 4 .

In each case there was a rapid increase in pH to a higher , relatively stable , value . The brief lag before the higher pH was attained is probably a reflection of the time necessary to exchange the perfusion fluid in the cell . The higher the ammonia concentration , the larger the pH in - crease . When the ammonia was removed from the perfusion fluid the pH dropped rapidly and actually attained a value slightly lower than that before the ammonia was added . During the next several minutes , the pH then rose to its initial value . This is reminiscent of the results shown in Fig . 5 , where removal of amino acids ( undoubtedly containing ammonia from glu - tamine breakdown ) caused a transient drop in pH .

As was the case with ammonia , each of these weak bases caused a rapid increase in intralysosomal pH to a relatively stable value ; when the base was removed from the perfusion fluid , the pH dropped rapidly back to a value close to its initial value . Both methylamine and amantadine cause vacuolation at the concentrations used here . In contrast , tri - butylamine does not cause vacuolation but rather inhibits the vacuolation caused by other compounds . We will return to this distinction in the discussion . Fig . 8 shows the effects on intralysosomal pH of a 20 - min exposure to the acidic ionophores X537A and nigericin . Both caused a substantial increase in pH . However , the response to these ionophores differed from that to the weak bases in two ways . The onset of the increase in pH was somewhat slower , and the reversal after the removal of the ionophores from the per - fusion medium was very slow . Fig . 9 shows the effects on intralysosomal pH of two meta - bolic poisons , alone and in combination . Neither azide nor 2 - deoxyglucose had a very large effect on pH by themselves . In combination they caused an increase in pH that was consider - ably greater than the sum of their individual effects . The onset of the pH increase caused by these metabolic poisons was slower than any reported above , and the reversal , after the removal of the metabolic poisons from the perfusion fluid , appeared to be complete . Similar effects of these inhibitors were found even when the pH of the perfusion medium was as low as 6 . 6 . This makes it likely that we are observing effects on the lysosomes themselves and not effects on any possible plasma membrane system for pH homeostasis in the cytoplasm . Similar effects were observed when cyanide was used in place of azide . In all the experiments reported above , the excitation spectra measured on the FD in the lysosomes was recognizable in shape as belonging to the family of spectra in Fig . 2 or some inter - mediate thereof . Such was not the case when cells were exposed to chloroquine . As shown in Fig . 10 , the 495 - nm peak of the FD was shifted to longer wavelengths . This could not be explained by either light absorption or fluorescence of chloroquine in this spectral region . Similar shifts and quenching in the FD spectra were observed when the FI ) was dissolved in solutions con - taining chloroquine at 10 mM or more , but to some extent the magnitude of the spectral shifts depended on the ionic com - position .

Results of this experiment are shown in Fig . 11 . Chloroquine caused a rapid , substantial increase in the intralysosomal pH that was only partially reversed when the chloroquine was removed from the perfusion fluid . Our interpretation of the spectra indicates that the concentration of chloroquine in the lysosomes was 50 - 100 mM all the time that the macrophages were exposed to chlo - roquine in the medium . Kinetics of uptake of substances into lysosomes Fig . 12 shows results of an experiment in which macrophages were exposed to two different compounds in the medium , 100 , MM chloroquine and 10 mM methylamine . Under these con - ditions , each of these compounds causes clearly visible vacu - olation in the macrophages within the time scale of this ex - periment . The kinetics of uptake were somewhat different in the two cases , as was the ratio of cellular to medium concen - trations attained . Chloroquine is taken up most rapidly and reaches a plateau after 30 min . Methylamine is taken up more slowly and is only approaching a plateau after 2 hr . The ratio of concentration in cells to that in the medium was higher for chloroquine than it was for methylamine . 7 . 0 W 6 . 5 6 . 0 \ pH 5 . 5 5 . 0 4 . 5 o 10 20 30 40 Minutes FIG . 11 .

DISCUSSION In our calibration standards of FD , we cannot , of course , sim - ulate exactly the chemical environment inside lysosomes . However , the insensitivity of FD fluorescence to environment that we have observed makes it likely that our values derived from the 495 / 450 ratio are accurate to within 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 pH unit . It remains highly desirable that measurements of this sort be repeated using a different fluorescence probe . If there is any heterogeneity in the pH of lysosomes , our values would be bi - ased . Because the neutral excitation spectrum is so much more intense than the acidic one ( Fig . 2 ) , any FD in a very acidic compartment would be essentially invisible . Thus , our measured pHs are upper limits for the average . The normal pH inside macrophage lysosomes seems to be 4 . 7 - 4 . 8 . The transient lower pH seen during the recovery from ammonia treatment and after removal of amino acids ( con - taminated with ammonia from glutamine decomposition ) from the medium may be a consequence of the intralysosomal pro - duction of protons as free base diffuses rapidly out through the lysosomal and plasma membranes and the protonated base inside dissociates . The theory of uptake of weak bases by lysosomes ( 7 ) predicts that back diffusion of protonated base will limit the concen - tration ratio that can be achieved and , at the same time , provide a proton leak . Indeed , we find that methylamine and ammonia , both substances that are concentrated very weakly in lysosomes , cause a great increase in the intralysosomal pH . Amantadine , a substance that is concentrated much more strongly , causes a substantially smaller increase in pH at comparable intralyso - somal concentrations . It seems likely that the inability of tri - butylamine to cause vacuolation , its ability to inhibit the va - cuolation caused by other weak bases , and its ability to increase the intralysosomal pH all are consequences of the lipophilic nature of its protonated form . This permits rapid proton leakage in the presence of this compound . The large pH increase in lysosomes after exposure to the acidic ionophores nigericin and X537A makes it likely that the cellular vacuolation caused by these compounds is a conse - quence of the exchange of potassium for protons across the ly - sosomal membrane . In this way , an active process of proton transport into lysosomes could be coupled to potassium transport in the same direction and lead to osmotic swelling . The pH values measured in the presence of chloroquine are much less precise than the others we have reported . There is , however , no doubt that this drug causes a substantial increase in the intralysosomal pH . Our pH value is remarkably close to the value reported by Reijngoud and Tager ( 15 ) for isolated lysosomes exposed to chloroquine at the same concentration . However , this coincidence is almost certainly fortuitous because the lysosomes of the living cells started with a lower internal pH and took up about 10 times more chloroquine than did the isolated lysosomes ( 8 , 15 ) . The results reported here lend support to the hypothesis that the low intralysosomal pH is maintained , at least partially , by an active process . First , the normal pH of 4 . 7 - 4 . 8 that we find in lysosomes is considerably lower than that found in isolated lysosomes ( 2 - 4 ) . More direct evidence comes from the effects of azide or cyanide and 2 - deoxyglucose alone and together . Neither type of inhibitor seems to have much effect alone , but together they act synergistically to increase the intralysosomal pH . This effect is most easily explained as the consequence of depriving the cells of both sources of ATP , oxidative phos - phorylation and glycolysis . Another argument for an active process of proton transport comes from a comparison of kinetics of pH change ( Fig . 7 ) and bulk uptake of methylamine ( Fig . 12 ) . The pH changes , presumably a consequence of simple acid - base equilibria of the same class as the Donnan equilibri - um , are very rapid . Uptake of the base is very much slower and continues while the pH in the lysosomes remains relatively constant . This is most easily explained by an active pumping of protons into the lysosomes , thus permitting further uptake of methylamine even though the pH remains constant . The pH increase seen in the lysosomes of cells exposed to weak bases is probably the consequence of proton leakage as a consequence of permeation by protonated base .
