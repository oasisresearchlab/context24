In one of the closest living relatives of animals , the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta , we find that rosette colony development is induced by the prey bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis and its close relatives in the Bacteroidetes phylum . Here we show that a rosette inducing factor ( RIF - 1 ) produced by A . machipongonensis belongs to the small class of sulfonolipids , obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play important roles in signal transmission in plants , animals , and fungi . RIF - 1 has extraordinary potency ( femtomolar , or 10 −15 M ) and S . rosetta can respond to it over a broad dynamic range—nine orders of magnitude . This study provides a prototypical example of bacterial sulfonolipids triggering eukaryotic morphogenesis and suggests molecular mechanisms through which bacteria may have contributed to the evolution of animals . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 . 001 Introduction Eukaryotes evolved in a world filled with bacteria and throughout their shared history these two branches of life have developed a complex set of ways to compete and cooperate with each other . While research on these interactions has historically emphasized bacterial pathogens , bacteria also regulate the biology of eukaryotes in many other ways ( McFall - Ngai 1999 ; Koropatnick et al . 2004 ; Mazmanian et al . 2005 ; Falkow 2006 ; Hughes and Sperandio 2008 ; Desbrosses and Stougaard 2011 ) and may have exerted critical influences on animal evolution . Choanoflagellates , microscopic bacteria - eating eukaryotes that are the closest living relatives of animals ( James - Clark 1868 ; Saville Kent 1880 ; Hibberd 1975 ; Carr et al . 2008 ; King et al . 2008 ; Ruiz - Trillo et al . 2008 ) , could provide particularly important insights into the mechanisms underlying bacterial influences on animal biology and evolution . Moreover , some choanoflagellates have both solitary and multicellular stages in their life histories ( Leadbeater 1983 ; Karpov and Coupe 1998 ; Dayel et al . 2011 ) and understanding the environmental cues that regulate choanoflagellate colony formation could provide a molecular model for animal multicellularity . Results In the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta , rosette - shaped multicellular colonies develop when a single founder cell undergoes multiple rounds of incomplete cytokinesis , leaving neighboring cells physically attached by fine intercellular bridges ( Fairclough et al . 2010 ; Dayel et al . 2011 ) . Although the original stock of S . rosetta ( ATCC50818 ) was established from a rosette colony ( Dayel et al . * For correspondence : jon _ clardy @ hms . harvard . edu ( JC ) ; nking @ berkeley . edu ( NK ) † These authors contributed equally to this work Competing interests : See page 12 Funding : See page 12 Received : 22 May 2012 Accepted : 18 July 2012 Published : 15 October 2012 Reviewing editor : Peter Greenberg , University of Washington , United States Copyright Alegado et al .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 2 of 16 Research article 2011 ) , laboratory cultures consistently produced single cells , with small numbers of rosette colonies forming only sporadically ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Serendipitously , we discov - ered that the bacterial community influences rosette colony development . Treatment of the ATCC50818 culture with an antibiotic cocktail resulted in a culture of S . rosetta cells that proliferated robustly by feeding on the remaining antibiotic - resistant bacteria but never formed rosette colonies , even upon removal of antibiotics ( Figure 1B ) . This culture line is hereafter referred to as RCA ( for ‘Rosette Colonies Absent’ ) . Supplementation of RCA cultures with bacteria from ATCC50818 restored rosette colony development , revealing that S . rosetta cells in the RCA culture remained competent to form colonies and would do so when stimulated by the original community of environmental bacteria . To determine which co - isolated bacterial species stimulate rosette colony development in S . rosetta , the RCA cell line was supplemented with 64 independent bacterial isolates from ATCC50818 and monitored for the appearance of rosette colonies . Only one bacterial species from ATCC50818 , the previously undescribed Algoriphagus machipongonensis ( phylum Bacteroidetes ; Alegado et al . 2012 ) , induced rosette colony development in the RCA cell line ( Figure 1C ) . S . rosetta cultures fed solely with A . machipongonensis yielded high percentages of rosette colonies ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , demonstrating that no other co - isolated bacterial species is required to stimulate rosette colony development . What was not clear was whether other bacteria might also be competent to induce rosette colony development . Therefore , representative Bacteroidetes and non - Bacteroidetes bacteria were grown and fed to RCA cultures ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ) . None of the non - Bacteroidetes species tested , including members of the γ - proteobacteria , α - proteobacteria , and Gram - positive bacteria , were competent to induce rosette colony development . In contrast , all 15 Algoriphagus species tested induced rosette colony development , as did six of 16 other closely related species tested in the Bacteroidetes phylum ( Table 1 ) . Therefore , the ability to induce rosette colony development is enriched in Algoriphagus bacteria and their relatives . Although Bacteroidetes bacteria regulate morphogenetic processes in such diverse lineages as animals , red algae , and green algae ( Provasoli and Pintner 1980 ; Matsuo et al . 2005 ; Mazmanian eLife digest All animals , including humans , evolved in a world filled with bacteria . Although bacteria are most familiar as pathogens , some bacteria produce small molecules that are essential for the biology of animals and other eukaryotes , although the details of the ways in which these bacterial molecules are beneficial are not well understood . The choanoflagellates are water - dwelling organisms that use their whip - like flagella to move around , feeding on bacteria . They can exist as one cell or a colony of multiple cells and , perhaps surprisingly , are the closest known living relatives of animals . This means that experiments on these organisms have the potential to improve our understanding of animal development and the transition from egg to embryo to adult . Alegado et al . have explored how the morphology of Salpingoeca rosetta , a colony - forming choanoflagellate , is influenced by its interactions with various species of bacteria . In particular , they find that the development of multicellularity in S . rosetta is triggered by the presence of the bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis as well as its close relatives . They also identify the signaling molecule produced by the bacteria to be C 32 H 64 NO 7 S ; this lipid molecule is an obscure relative of the sphingolipid molecules that have important roles in signal transmission in animals , plants , and fungi . Moreover , Alegado et al . show that S . rosetta can respond to this molecule – which they call rosette - inducing factor ( RIF - 1 ) – over a wide range of concentrations , including concentrations as low as 10 - 17 M . The work of Alegado et al . suggests that interactions between S . rosetta and Algoriphagus bacteria could be a productive model system for studying the influences of bacteria on animal cell biology , and for investigating the mechanisms of signal delivery and reception . Moreover , the molecular mechanisms revealed by this work leave open the possibility that bacteria might have contributed to the evolution of multicellularity in animals .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 3 of 16 Research article et al . 2005 ) , the bacterially produced chemical cues that regulate most of these partnerships remain obscure . The limited phylogenetic distribution of bacteria capable of inducing rosette colony develop - ment suggested that A . machipongonensis and its close relatives may produce a characteristic mole - cule that could be identified biochemically . The complete absence of rosette colonies in RCA cultures provided the basis for a robust bioassay that we developed to identify the rosette - inducing molecule ( s ) , which we named RIFs ( Rosette - Inducing Factors ) , from A . machipongonensis cultures . Preliminary studies demonstrated that RIF activity was present in conditioned medium from A . machipongonensis , even when grown in the absence of choanoflagellates . Furthermore , the activity was also found in the A . machipongonensis cell envelope and was heat , protease , and nuclease resistant , revealing that the compound is not a protein , RNA , or DNA ( Table 2 ) . The bacterial cell envelope components lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and peptidoglycan ( PGN ) from Gram - negative bacteria have long been known to affect host biology ( Cohn and Morse 1960 ; Hoffmann et al . 1999 ; Kopp and Medzhitov 1999 ; Takeuchi et al . 1999 ; Medzhitov and Janeway 2000 ; Kimbrell and Beutler 2001 ; Koropatnick et al . 2004 ) , but neither LPS nor PGN from A . machipongo - nensis triggered rosette development , alone or in combination ( Figure 3A ) . Instead , we found that A . machipongonensis crude lipid extracts enriched in sphingolipids robustly induced rosette develop - ment ( Figure 3A ) . In animals , sphingolipid signaling pathways regulate developmental processes such as cell death , survival , differentiation , and migration ( Prieschl and Baumruker 2000 ; Pyne and Pyne 2000 ; Spiegel and Milstien 2000 ; Hannun et al . 2001 ; Merrill et al . 2001 ; Herr et al . 2003 ) . Moreover , sphingolipids serve essential functions both as structural components of cell membranes and as signal - ing molecules in diverse eukaryotes ( Hannich et al . 2011 ) . In contrast , the phylogenetic distribution of sphingolipids in bacteria is largely limited to Bacteroidetes and Sphingomonas , where their endog - enous functions are poorly understood ( Olsen and Jantzen 2001 ; An et al . 2011 ) . To isolate and characterize the molecule ( s ) underlying RIF activity , we focused on the fraction enriched in sphingolipids . Lipids isolated from 160 L of A . machipongonensis culture were separated using preparative liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) and the activity of each fraction was measured using the rosette colony induction bioassay . RIF activity tracked with a single fraction , which was further purified by several rounds of preparative thin - layer chromatography ( Figure 3— figure supplement 1 ) to yield approximately 700 µg of active compound ( RIF - 1 ) with sufficient purity Figure 1 . Rosette colony development in S . rosetta is regulated by A . machipongonensis . ( A ) The original culture of S . rosetta , ATCC 50818 , contains diverse co - isolated environmental bacteria and forms rosette colonies ( arrowheads ) rarely . ( B ) Treatment of ATCC50818 with a cocktail of antibiotics reduced the bacterial diversity and yielded an S . rosetta culture line , RCA , in which rosette colonies never formed . ( Representative single cells indicated by arrows . ) ( C ) Addition of A . machipongonensis to RCA cultures was sufficient to induce rosette development . Scale bar , 2 μ m .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 5 of 16 Research article for structural analysis . RIF - 1 represents only 0 . 015 % of the A . machipogonensis sphingolipid pool . Based on high - resolution mass spectrome - try , RIF - 1 has a molecular formula of C 32 H 64 NO 7 S ( M - H : exptl . 606 . 44027 , calcd . 606 . 44035 , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Detailed analysis of one - and two - dimensional ( COSY , HMBC , TOCSY , Figure 3—figure supplements 3 – 15 ) nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR , 600 MHz , Table 3 ) spectra revealed the planar structure of RIF - 1 , an unusual sulfonolipid shown in Figure 3B . Sulfonolipids like RIF - 1 resemble sphingolip - ids , but there are important differences between the two . In sphingolipids , a sphingoid base ( 1 , 3 - dihydroxy - 2 - aminoalkane ) is linked through an amide bond to a fatty acid . The long alkyl chains of both the sphingoid base and fatty acid vary in length , branching , number of double bonds , and placement of hydroxyl substituents . In RIF - 1 , a capnoid base ( 2 - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 15 - methyl - 1 - sulfonic acid ) replaces the sphingoid base , and the sphingolipid hydroxyl , which is the attachment point for the major diversifying ele - ments of the sphingolipid family , is replaced by a sulfonic acid . While members of the sphingolipid family , such as the ceramides , glycosphingolipids , sphingomyelins , and gangliosides , differ by the groups attached to the hydroxyl , the sulfonic acid function in sulfonolipids like RIF - 1 has no re - ported diversifying modifications . In this sense sulfonolipid diversity appears more limited than sphingolipid diversity . Significantly , commercial sphingolipids ( sphingomyelin , monosiloganglio - side , galactocerebroside , and N - palmitoyl - DL - dihydrolacto cerebroside ; Table 2 ) failed to show any activity in our assay system . To our knowledge , RIF - 1 is the first sulfonolipid demonstrated to influ - ence developmental processes in eukaryotes . Finally , we investigated the potency of RIF - 1 and its ability to induce colony development under plausible environmental conditions . Purified RIF - 1 induces rosette formation with a bell - shaped dose - response curve over a broad range of concentrations , from 10 −2 to 10 7 fM or some nine orders of magnitude ( Figure 4 ) . No observable effects were seen below 10 −5 fM , and RIF - 1 appears to be inactive above 10 8 fM . A . machipongonensis conditioned medium contains 10 4 fM RIF - 1 ( Figure 4—figure supplements 1 – 3 ) , and even if this conditioned medium measurement exaggerates natural concentra - tions by a factor of 10 6 , S . rosetta could still respond to its presence . The shape of the dose - response curve and the potency of RIF - 1 suggest that S . rosetta perceives RIF - 1 in a manner consistent with a receptor - ligand interaction , albeit a receptor of exquisite sensitivity and remarkable dynamic range . While RIF - 1 is the only molecule detected with rosette - inducing activity , its maximal activity ( 5 . 6 ± 0 . 5 % colonial cells / total cells ) differs from that of the sphingolipid - enriched lipid fraction ( 19 . 2 ± 4 . 6 % colonial cells / total cells ; Figure 4 ) . This difference may be due to delivery issues of the purified and highly hydrophobic molecule , which in nature resides in membranes and potentially in membrane vesicles . Alternatively , the full potency of RIF - 1 as an inducer of colony development may require additional A . machipongonensis molecules not identified in this study . Discussion These data reveal that RIF - 1 , a sulfonolipid produced by the prey bacterium A . machipongonensis , regulates morphogenesis in its predator , S . rosetta . The ecological relevance of this signaling Figure 2 . Diverse members of the Bacteroidetes phylum induce rosette colony development . A maximum likelihood phylogeny inferred from 16S rDNA gene sequences reveals the evolutionary relationships among A . machipongonensis , other members of the Bacteroidetes phylum , and representative γ - proteobacteria ( γ ) , α - proteobacteria ( α ) , and Gram - positive ( + ) bacteria . All 15 members of the Algoriphagus genus ( Table 1 ) , as well as six other species in the Bacteroidetes phylum , were competent to induce colony development ( filled squares ) . In contrast , no species outside of Bacteroidetes and most of the non - Algoriphagus bacteria tested failed to induce rosette colony development ( open squares ) .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 6 of 16 Research article interaction is indicated both by the coexistence of S . rosetta and A . machipongonensis in nature and by the fact that the activity of RIF - 1 at femtomolar concentrations makes it markedly more potent than other marine signaling molecules [ e . g . , Vibrio autoinducer ( Schaefer et al . 1996 ) and the tripeptide pheromones of the Caribbean spiny lobster ( Ziegler and Forward 2007 ) ] . The potency of RIF - 1 signal - ing compares favorably with that of silkworm moth sex pheromone signaling , in which vapors from an ~ 4 fM solution of bombykol , the sex pheromone of the silkworm moth , induce a pronounced wing fluttering response in males ( Butenandt et al . 1961 ; Agosta 1992 ; Roelofs 1995 ) . While it is formally possible that RIF - 1 - dependent rosette colony development is a promiscuous response to sphingoli - pid - type molecules , only a handful of sulfonolipids like RIF - 1 have been reported ( Godchaux and Leadbetter 1980 , 1983 , 1984 , 1988 ; Drijber and McGill 1994 ; Kamiyama et al . 1995a , 1995b ; Kobayashi et al . 1995 ) and no other A . machipongonensis lipid tested in this study induced rosette colony development . Therefore we favor a model in which A . machipongonensis cell density , as revealed by RIF - 1 concentration , provides S . rosetta with an indication of conditions under which rosette colony development would be advantageous , for instance by promoting more efficient cap - ture of planktonic bacteria ( Kreft 2010 ) . In analogy to the chemotaxis system of bacteria ( Falke et al . 1997 ) , the ability of S . rosetta to respond to increasing bacterial cell density likely requires the hypoth - esized RIF - 1 receptor to become less sensitive at higher concentrations . The high concentration cutoff in the dose - response curve reflects a complete loss of sensitivity at high , but non - physiological , RIF - 1 concentrations . Although the presence of RIF - 1 in the A . machipongonensis cell envelope suggests that it may be encountered by S . rosetta during phagocytosis , it can also function at a distance . We hypothesize that RIF - 1 may be released into the environment in membrane vesicles , which have been described in Gram - negative bacteria such as Bacteroidetes ( Zhou et al . 1998 ; Møller et al . 2005 ) , and that additional membrane constituents might be required for the full potency of RIF - 1 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 8 of 16 Research article elucidating RIF - 1 delivery , along with determining the three - dimensional structure of RIF - 1 and char - acterizing sulfonolipids from other Bacteroidetes will begin to provide the needed foundation for a molecular understanding of how S . rosetta perceives RIFs . The morphogenetic interaction described here between S . rosetta and A . machipongonensis raises the possibility that bacterially - produced sphingolipids in general , and sulfonolipids in particular , may be essential for the chemical signaling that allows Bacteroidetes to influence cell differentiation and morphogenesis in diverse animals ( Falkow 2006 ; Mazmanian et al . 2008 ; Lee and Mazmanian 2010 ; An et al . 2011 ) . Sulfonolipids like RIF - 1 have been reported to have therapeutic activities , but their endogenous functions are not known . Sulfobacins A and B , which were isolated from the culture broth of a Chryseobacterium sp . were reported as von Willebrand factor receptor antagonists , and flavocris - tamide A , from a related bacterial species , was reported as a DNA polymerase α inhibitor ( Kamiyama et al . 1995a ; Kobayashi et al . 1995 ) . The pervasiveness of interactions between Bacter oidetes and animals ( Webster et al . 2004 ; Wexler 2007 ) , coupled with the close evolutionary relationship between choanoflagellates and animals ( King and Carroll 2001 ; King 2004 ; King et al . 2008 ; Ruiz - Trillo et al . 2008 ) , raise the possibility that the connection between Bacteroidetes and animal development has deep evolutionary roots ( McFall - Ngai 1999 ) . The discovery of RIF - 1 and its biological activity toward S . rosetta provides both the molecular basis and model organism for further understanding a new and potentially important class of small molecule information transfer . Materials and methods Choanoflagellate husbandry and microscopy The environmental isolate of Salpingoeca rosetta is deposited at the American Tissue Culture Collection ( ATCC ) under the designation ATCC50818 ( King et al . 2003 ) . The Rosette Colonies Absent ( RCA ) culture line was produced from ATCC50818 by serial treatment with chloramphenicol ( 68 μ g mL −1 ) , ampicillin ( 50 μ g mL −1 ) , streptomycin ( 50 μ g mL −1 ) , and erythromycin ( 50 μ g mL −1 ) ( Fairclough et al . 2010 ) . A monoxenic line of S . rosetta ( Px1 ) was generated by treating ATCC 50818 with a combination of ofloxacin ( 10 μ g mL −1 ) , kanamycin ( 50 μ g mL −1 ) , and streptomycin ( 50 μ g mL −1 ) antibiotics to kill the undefined environmental bacteria . Following several rounds of serial dilution , a single cell was isolated by FACS and supplemented with A . machipongonensis ( Dayel et al . 2011 ) . All three S . rosetta cell lines ( ATCC 50818 , RCA , and Px1 ) were grown in cereal grass infused seawater at 25°C and maintained by splitting cultures 1 : 10 into fresh medium every 3 days ( King et al . 2009 ) . Live cells were imaged with a Leica DMI6000B microscope equipped with a DFC350 FX camera . Bioassay for rosette colony development Under laboratory conditions , S . rosetta differentiates into a variety of cell types including attached thecate cells , solitary swimmers , rosette colonies , chain colonies and loose , disorganized associations of cells attached to one another at the collar or to bacterial biofilms ( Dayel et al . 2011 ) . S . rosetta rosette colonies can be distinguished from other cell types in that they contain clusters of at least four closely associated cells with organized polarity ; each cell oriented with its flagellum pointing outward from a central focus . In the qualitative bioassay , RCA cultures were diluted in fresh medium to a density of approximately 10 4 – 10 5 cells mL −1 , aliquoted into 24 - well flat bottom culture dishes ( Costar , Corning , NY , USA ) , supplemented with various treatments , and scored for the presence or absence of rosette colonies after 48 hr . For quantitative measurements , RCA cultures were diluted as before into six - well flat bottom culture dishes . To measure the percentage of cells within rosette colonies , each well was scraped to detach thecate cells and the total number of cells and the total number of cells in each rosette colony were counted with a Bright - Line hemacytometer ( Hausser Scientific , Horsham , PA , USA ) .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 9 of 16 Research article Isolation and identification of A . machipongonensis A partial representation of the bacterial flora from ATCC50818 was isolated by standard dilution - plating technique on modified Zobell medium agar ( Carlucci and Pramer 1957 ) at 25°C . Individual iso - lates were tested for their morphogenic activity by supplementing RCA cultures with a single colony of each isolate . Of 64 isolates tested , the only one that restored rosette colony development to the RCA cell line was a species that formed pink - pigmented colonies ( designated strain PR1 ) . Strain PR1 was used to inoculate liquid modified Zobell medium at 25°C and grown with aeration overnight . PR1 cells were harvested by centrifugation , and genomic DNA was isolated using a Bacterial Genomic DNA Mini - prep Kit ( Bay Gene , Burlingame , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s specifications . The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal prim - ers 8F ( 5 ′ - AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG - 3 ′ ) and 1492R ( 5 ′ - ACCTTGTTACGRCTT - 3 ′ ) ( Weisburg et al . 1991 ) ; comparison of the PR1 16S rRNA sequence to the Greengenes 16S rRNA database ( DeSantis et al . 2006 ) revealed strain PR1 to be most closely related to members of the Algoriphagus genus within the Bacteroidetes phylum . PR1 was subse - quently named Algoriphagus machipongonensis ( Bradley et al . 2009 ) . Generating a phylogenetic framework for testing the diversity of bacteria that induce rosette colony development To investigate whether the ability to trigger rosette colony development was specific to A . machipon - gonensis , we tested three classes of bacterial spe - cies for their morphogenic capacity : 15 species in the Algoriphagus genus , 16 non - Algoriphagus members of the Bacteroidetes phylum , and eight species representing three additional major clades within Bacteria . Each species was screened for morphogenic activity using the bioassay for rosette colony development . Live cells from individual colonies grown from solid agar plates were added directly to RCA cultures and scored for the presence or absence of rosette colonies 48 hr after inocula - tion . Each bacterial species was tested three times . To determine the phylogenetic distribution of morphogenic activity in the bacterial species tested ( Table 1 ) , a sequence alignment of 16S rDNA genes from each species was generated by iterative pairwise comparisons using FSA ( Bradley et al . 2009 ) . Poorly aligned regions were removed by Gblocks version 0 . 91b ( Castresana 2000 ; Talavera and Castresana 2007 ) using default block param - eters . A distance matrix ( distance options according to the Kimura two - parameter model ) , including clustering with the maximum likelihood algorithm , was calculated using Phylip version 3 . 67 ( Falenstein 1989 ) . Support for the resulting tree topology was estimated using bootstrap analysis ( 1000 replicates ) . Biochemical analysis of Rosette Inducing Factor ( RIF - 1 ) To determine the biochemical nature of RIF - 1 , A . machipongonensis cell fractions and conditioned medium were subjected to a battery of treatments . The results of these tests are summarized in Table 2 . Conditioned medium ( CM ) was generated by pelleting either choanoflagellates grown Table 3 .

To test whether RIF - 1 activity required live bacteria , A . machipongonensis was grown overnight at 25°C , centrifuged at 16 , 000× g for 1 min to pellet cells , and heated for 30 min at 80°C to kill viable bacteria . To test whether RIF - 1 activity might be heat labile ( e . g . , a polypeptide ) , A . machipongo - nensis CM was boiled for 10 min . To test whether RIF - 1 was a protein , A . machipongonensis CM was incubated with 200 μ g mL −1 proteinase K ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA , USA ) for 2 hr at 37°C . To test whether RIF - 1 was a nucleic acid , 25 mL of A . machipongonensis CM was lyophi - lized , resuspended in 2 . 5 mL of water , and extracted with 100 % ethanol to a final concentra - tion of 80 % ( vol / vol ) for 2 hr at −20°C and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000× g at 4°C . The precipitate was dis - solved in 0 . 01 M PBS ( containing 10 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 ) and incubated with either RNase A ( 100 μ g mL −1 ; Sigma ) or DNase I ( 100 μ g mL −1 ; Sigma ) for 2 . 5 hr at 37°C . To test whether RIF - 1 activity was in the methanolic extract , A . machipongonensis cell pellet and CM were lyophilized and vortexed with methanol . Each suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min and the methanol layer recovered and dried . To test whether RIF - 1 was a lipid , A . machipon - gonensis cell pellet was extracted according to the Bligh – Dyer method ( Bligh and Dyer 1959 ) . Briefly , the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 vol of 1 : 2 ( vol / vol ) CHCl 3 : MeOH and vortexed . One volume of CHCl 3 was added , and the mixture vortexed . One volume of distilled water was then added , and the mixture vortexed . The same was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and the bottom layer recov - ered and dried . To test whether RIF - 1 was a component of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , A . machipongonensis LPS was isolated using a method from Apicella ( 2008 ) . Lyophilized A . machipongonensis cells were ground with a mortar and pestle and suspended in 10 mM Tris – Cl buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , containing 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 4 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , and 2 mM MgCl 2 . The mixture was vortexed and incu - bated at 65°C until solubilized . Proteinase K ( 20 mg mL −1 ) was added to the mixture , and incubated at 65°C for an additional hour , followed by 37°C incubation overnight . 3 M sodium acetate was then added and the sample mixed . Following addition of cold absolute ethanol to the cell suspension , the sample was incubated overnight at – 20°C to allow precipitate to form . The mixture was centrifuged at 4000× g for 15 min , and the supernatant discarded . The precipitate was suspended in distilled water . 3 M sodium acetate was added , and the mixture vortexed . Following addition of cold absolute etha - nol , the mixture was vortexed again , and the suspension again allowed to precipitate overnight at – 20°C . After the centrifugation , the precipitate was suspended in 10 mM Tris – Cl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , and DNase I ( 100 μ g mL −1 ; NEB ) and RNase ( 25 μ g mL −1 ; NEB ) added . The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 4 hr , then placed in a 65°C water bath for 30 min . Ninety percent phenol preheated to 65°C was added , and allow to set at 65°C for 15 min . The mixture was placed in an ice bath to cool , and then centri - fuged at 6000× g for 15 min . The top aqueous layer was removed , and the phenolic layer re - extracted with an equal volume of distilled water . This sample was again incubated at 65°C for 15 min and then placed in ice water . After centrifugation at 6000× g for 15 min , the two aqueous layers were combined and dialyzed against multiple changes of distilled water over 2 days . Figure 4 .

( 1992 ) , A . machipongonensis cell pellet was washed with 0 . 8 % NaCl . The cells were resuspended in hot 4 % SDS , boiled for 30 min , and then incubated at room tem - perate overnight . The sample was boiled for an additional 10 min and then centrifuged at 15 , 000× g for 15 min at room temperature . The pellet was washed four times with water and resuspended in water . The sample was digested for mutanolysin ( 10 μ g mL −1 ; Sigma ) overnight at 37°C . The enzyme was inactivated by incubation at 80°C for 20 min . Isolation and purification of RIF - 1 from A . machipongonensis A . machipongonensis was cultured in seawater complete medium ( 16×1 L ) at 30°C for 2 days . The cells were harvested by centrifugation and extracted with CHCl 3 : MeOH ( 2 : 1 , 4 L ) . The organic extract was filtered , dried over sodium sulfate ( Na 2 SO 4 ) , and concentrated to give approximately 4 g crude lipid extract . The crude extract was dissolved in a minimum amount of CHCl 3 : MeOH ( 2 : 1 ) , and purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . All solvents were pur - chased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted . Preparative reversed phase HPLC ( RP - HPLC ) was performed on an Agilent Technologies 1200 Series HPLC using a Phenomenex Luna 5 µm C8 ( 2 ) 100 Å 250×21 . 2 mm column . Isolation of RIF - 1 continued with a crude fractionation in which com - pounds were eluted at 10 mL min −1 in a gradient of solvents A ( 0 . 1 % NH 4 OH in water ) and B ( 0 . 1 % NH 4 OH in methanol ) : 65 % B increasing to 100 % B over 30 min , isocratic at 100 % B for 1 min . before returning to 65 % B and re - equilibrating over 10 min . Fractions were analyzed by low - resolution mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) on an Agilent 6130 LC / MS using a Phenomenex Gemini - NX 5 µm C18 110 Å 100×2 mm column . The next stage involved a higher resolution separation in which compounds were eluted at 0 . 5 mL min −1 in a gradient of solvents A ( 0 . 1 % NH 4 OH in water ) and B ( 0 . 1 % NH 4 OH in methanol ) : 65 % B increasing to 100 % B over 30 min , isocratic at 100 % B for 1 min before returning to 65 % B and re - equilibrating over 3 min and those which contained a mass peak corresponding to RIF - 1 ( [ M - H ] = 606 . 4 ) were combined and concentrated . This material was then purified by prepara - tive TLC ( 1 mm , silica gel 60 ) , eluted with CHCl 3 : MeOH : AcOH : H 2 O ( 100 : 20 : 12 : 5 , Rf = 0 . 5 ) . RIF - 1 was visualized by staining with ammonium molybdate in 10 % H 2 SO 4 . The portion of the plate ( Fraction F ; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) that induced colony formation and contained RIF - 1 ( LC / MS : [ M - H ] 606 ) was scraped off after RIF - 1 was visualized by staining with ammonium molybdate in 10 % H 2 SO 4 , and the silica was extracted with CHCl 3 : MeOH ( 5 : 1 ) . This material was further purified by preparative TLC on a 250 μ m TLC plate ( silica gel 60 ) , eluted with CHCl 3 : MeOH : AcOH : H 2 O ( 100 : 20 : 12 : 5 ) . From 16 L of A . machipongonensis culture , approximately 50 μ g RIF - 1 was obtained in sufficient purity . The entire process , from growth of the cells to isolation of pure RIF - 1 , was repeated nine times in order to obtain approximately 0 . 7 mg RIF - 1 from a total of 160 L of A . machipongonensis culture . High Resolution Mass Spectrometry ( HRMS ) was carried out by Ted Voss at the WM Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University on a Bruker 9 . 4T FT - ICR MS . RIF - 1 was dissolved in 200 μ L DMSO - d 6 and transferred into a 3 mm NMR tube . 1 H , TOCSY , gCOSY and dqfCOSY were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer . HMQC and gHMBC experiments were performed on a Bruker Advance ( sgu ) 900 MHz and Varian Unity Inova 600 MHz equipped with a cryoprobe , respec - tively . Chemical shifts are reported in ppm from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance resulting from incomplete deuteration as the internal standard ( DMSO : δ 2 . 50 ) . Data are reported in Table 3 as follows : chemical shift , multiplicity ( s = singlet , d = doublet , t = triplet , q = quartet , br = broad , m = multiplet ) , coupling constants , and integration . Optical rotation was measured on a Jasco P - 2000 dig - ital polarimeter with a sodium lamp at 21 . 4°C . Unless otherwise noted , all solvents and reagents were purchased from VWR or Fisher and used without further purification . 1 H NMR ( 600 MHz , DMSO ) and 13 C NMR ( 600 MHz , DMSO ) : see Table 3 .

Quantification of RIF - 1 levels in conditioned medium Conditioned medium was prepared from A . machipongonensis grown in seawater complete medium ( 750 mL ) at 30°C for 2 days . The conditioned medium was lyophilized and extracted with CHCl 3 : MeOH Cell biology Alegado et al . eLife 2012 ; 1 : e00013 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00013 12 of 16 Research article ( 2 : 1 ; 78 mL ) . The organic extract was filtered , further extracted with CHCl 3 ( 60 mL×2 ) , and filtrates were combined and concentrated to dryness under vacuum . The crude extract was suspended in 5 mL 50 % MeOH : H 2 O and was passed through a C - 18 SPE ( 1 g ) column . The open column was then washed with 10 mL 90 % MeOH : CHCl 3 . The organic eluate was concentrated and dissolved in 3 mL CHCl 3 : MeOH ( 2 : 1 ) for LC / MS analysis . The chromatography was carried out using an Agilent 6130 Quadrupole LC / MS system with a C18 reverse - phase column ( 4 . 6×100 mm ; Phenomenex Luna ; 5 μ ) for 30 min in a linear gradient from solvent A ( 60 % methanol / water with 0 . 1 % ammonium hydroxide ) to solvent B ( 100 % methanol with 0 . 1 % ammonium hydroxide ) . The RIF - 1 was detected in the conditioned medium at a concentration of 80 ng L −1 . The purified RIF - 1 was used as the standard ( Figure 4—figure supplements 1 – 3 ) . Activity profile of RIF - 1 The potency of pure RIF - 1 was determined using the quantitative bioassay for rosette colony develop - ment . Briefly , 100 ug of pure RIF - 1 was solubilized in 100 μ L DMSO and this 1 g L −1 stock was stored at - 80°C . For each experiment , serial dilutions ranging from 10 −1 g L −1 down to 10 −17 g L −1 were made in DMSO . 2 μ L of each dilution was premixed with 1 mL of fresh cereal grass infused seawater ( King et al . 2003 ) to avoid precipitation of RIF - 1 and the premixed RIF - 1 dilution was then added to 1 mL RCA cultures to yield final concentrations ranging from 10 −3 to 10 −20 g L −1 , equivalent to 1 . 6×10 9 fM down to 1 . 6×10 −8 fM . The percentage of rosette colonial cells was determined as described above in three independent cell lines in triplicate . From the percent rosette colony development , a bell - shaped dose - response model was determined to be the nonlinear regression curve of best fit determined using GraphPad Prism 5 statistical software .
