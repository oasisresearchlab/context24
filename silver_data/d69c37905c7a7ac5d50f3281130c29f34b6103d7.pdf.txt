KEYWORDS nervous system , skeletal system , crosstalk , bone repair and regeneration , nerve innervation Introduction The nerves are spatially connected to the skeleton . The skeleton is extensively innervated by sensory and sympathetic nerves ( Togari et al . , 2012 ) . However , our understanding of the interrelationship between nerve and bone is still limited , which also hinders the treatment of neuro - skeletal disorders . Neuroskeletal regulation has received more attention in recent years , and some pioneering theories and ideas have been proposed . Skeletal function and regeneration were affected by neurological defects or mental disorders ( Kelly et al . , 2020 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , Ducy et al . found that bone remodeling was regulated by the central nervous system and its derived leptin ( Ducy et al . , 2000 ; Takeda et al . , 2002 ) , suggesting that nerves have the ability to modulate bone . Since then , researchers have explored the mechanisms by which neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems communicate with cells in the skeletal microenvironment and have identi ﬁ ed the contributions of sensory and sympathetic nerves to bone development , bone homeostasis , and bone remodeling ( Grassel , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2019 ; Tomlinson et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Review PUBLISHED 30 August 2022 DOI 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 976736 approximately 15 % of the total body weight and is one of the largest organ systems in the body , supporting the movement and protecting vital organs ( Han et al . , 2018 ; Su et al . , 2019 ; Rath and Durairaj , 2022 ) . However , in the last 20 years , it has gradually been discovered that the skeleton also acted as a secretory organ , regulating other tissue functions by secreting different bone - derived factors ( Li et al . , 2019 ; Qian et al . , 2021 ) . The crosstalk between bone and nerves is a hot topic of research currently . As part of this review , we will examine the role of nerves in bone formation and repair , analyze the regulation of the nervous system by the skeleton , and summarize the mechanisms of mutual regulation between nerves and bone . Nerve distribution within the bone Connecting the central nervous system ( CNS ) to the skeleton is the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , which acts as a transmitter of information . In the PNS , neurons are found in sensory and autonomic ganglia , collections of nerve cell bodies with axons that extend to target tissues ( Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . Long bones and the calvaria are innervated by nerves that originate at different locations . Sensory neurons in the limbs originate in the dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) next to the spinal cord and have a pseudo - unipolar morphology ( Sorkin et al . , 2018 ) . Its axons bifurcate into peripheral projections that innervate the target tissue ( Figure 1A ) and can sense pain , pressure , heat and other stimuli and transmit them to central processing ( Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . Nociceptors are the receptors that are sensitive to injurious stimuli ( Dubin and Patapoutian , 2010 ) . They can be further subdivided into peptidergic and non - peptidergic primary afferent neurons ( Kestell et al . , 2015 ) . Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) is necessary for the survival and recruitment of peptidergic ﬁ bers , whereas ﬁ bers lacking peptides are dependent on glial - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) ( Averill et al . , 1995 ) . Peptide - rich ﬁ bers expressing substance P ( SP ) and calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) are prevalent in the skeleton of vertebrate species ( Hill and Elde , 1991 ; Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , the collateral axon branches of these neurons can generate efferent signals that target their peripheral target tissues ( Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . This local release of neuropeptides indicates the trophic nature of sensory nerves and their ability to modulate skeletal activity . The autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) is a part of the peripheral efferent nervous system that innervates and regulates the activity of all organs of the body , including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves ( McCorry , 2007 ) . The autonomic nerves in the limbs are mainly sympathetic ( Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . Through preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord , autonomic nerves synapse with postganglionic neurons in the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic chain ( Cherruau et al . , 2003 ; Elefteriou , 2018 ) . Sympathetic postganglionic neurons are noradrenergic , and they can project to a wide range of tissues in the body ( Elefteriou , 2018 ) . Sympathetic adrenergic neurons , which are abundant in bone , express tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) and promote the synthesis of norepinephrine ( NE ) ( Hill and Elde , 1991 ; Mach et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , cholinergic neurons containing acetylcholine ( ACh ) and the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) innervate bone ( Hohmann et al . , 1986 ; Cherruau et al . , 2003 ) . Reports on nerve innervation in the skull are very limited . The ganglia that innervate the craniofacial skeleton are located in the cranial nerve ganglia ( Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . Calvarial bone is surrounded by both intracranial ( dura ) and extracranial ( periosteal ) sheaths ( Figures 1B , C ) that contain sensory , sympathetic , and parasympathetic nerve endings ( Kosaras et al . , 2009 ) . In the mature calvaria , the sutures are thought to serve as the major passageway of innervation between the dura and periosteum . From the dura , the ﬁ bers appear to penetrate the suture and emerge into the periosteum ( Kosaras et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , our results showed that the sutures were dominated by sensory nerves with a small portion of sympathetic nerves ( Meyers et al . , 2020 ) . The regulatory mechanisms of neurodevelopment are complex . The in ﬂ uence of nerve formation and distribution on cranial repair remains to be elucidated . In summary , the skeleton is covered by neural networks . Their location in space determines that they necessarily modulate each other . However , we know very little about the interaction FIGURE 1 Distribution of nerves in limb and skull .

Neural regulation of bone remodeling and repair Bone is innervated by sensory nerve ﬁ bers expressing tropomyosin receptor kinase A ( TrkA ) , which are required for the proliferation of osteochondral progenitors during skeletal development in mammals ( Castaneda - Corral et al . , 2011 ; Mantyh , 2014 ) . Besides pain , little is known about the role of sensory innervation in bone regeneration . NGF is the ﬁ rst discovered neurotrophic factor that is primarily involved in the regulation of the growth , survival , as well as regeneration of neurons ( Ebendal , 1992 ) . In addition to directly activating TrkA + sensory neurons to transmit injury signals , NGF determines the amount and type of innervation required for repair and regulates the growth of TrkA + neurons into the cartilage membrane of long bones during embryogenesis , which is required for progenitor cell differentiation and bone mineralization ( Reichardt , 2006 ; Tomlinson et al . , 2016 ) . Primary and secondary ossi ﬁ cation centers exhibited delayed vascular invasion when TrkA + signaling and innervation were inhibited , which further decreased the number of Osterix + osteoprogenitor cells and reduced the length and volume of femur ( Tomlinson et al . , 2016 ) . The regeneration of entire appendages by star ﬁ sh and certain amphibians depends on nerves . We also found that mammalian fracture repair required TrkA signaling from sensory nerves ( Li et al . , 2019 ) . NGF was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in the early stage of repair after fracture . The bone repair process involves the regulation of in ﬂ ammation by macrophages and the formation of bone by mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . In our study , the main sources of NGF production were periosteal MSCs and osteocalcin ( OCN ) + bone - lining osteoblasts , followed by macrophages . TrkA + nerve sprouting was positively correlated with NGF expression . The level of NGF and the number of newly generated nerve ﬁ bers peaked on day 3 and then dropped signi ﬁ cantly . Moreover , the nerves in the callus were predominantly sensory and peptidergic ﬁ bers , with a small proportion of TH + sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers . Inhibition of NGF - TrkA signaling impaired sensory nerve re - growth and vascular remodeling , leading to failure of bone healing . The research suggests that NGF regulates nerve ingrowth at an early stage , which facilitates vascular and bone regeneration . Thus , we reveal the sequence of cellular events that occur during re - innervation of fracture - healed tissue and demonstrate a critical role of TrkA sensory nerves in bone healing . The ﬂ at bones of the skull are densely innervated , which is essential for coordinated bone development and repair ( Warren et al . , 2003 ; Doro et al . , 2017 ) . Our group next characterized the innervation of the mouse skull and explored their role in cranial bone defect repair ( Meyers et al . , 2020 ) . Nerve ﬁ bers were observed in the uninjured skull . During the early stages of calvarial defect repair , macrophages were activated and expanded rapidly , releasing signi ﬁ cant amounts of NGF . Locally increased NGF promoted nerve regeneration and axonal ingrowth . Furthermore , immunohistochemical staining identi ﬁ ed the sprouting nerve as primarily CGRP + peptidergic nociceptors . The nerve regeneration process further promoted vascular remodeling and bone regeneration at the defect site . Like the long bone , TrkA is universally expressed on ﬁ bers that innervate the calvarium from the trigeminal ganglia . A mutation in TrkA protein inhibited NGF signaling and subsequently impaired the re - innervation of tubulin beta 3 Class III ( TUBB3 ) + nerve ﬁ bers . These ﬁ ndings suggest that nerve regeneration in the skull is also controlled by the NGF - TrkA signaling pathway . Blocking the NGF - TrkA signaling pathway led to reduced vascularity and decreased osteogenic capacity , which signi ﬁ cantly delayed bone defect healing ( Meyers et al . , 2020 ) . Interestingly , we found that NGF also regulated the migration of MSCs . Locally released NGF recruited the aggregation of MSCs to the defect site via the NGF - p75 signaling pathway , thereby coupling the neuro - skeletal interaction ( Figure 2 ) ( Xu et al . , 2022 ) . Despite these ﬁ ndings , we have yet to address the downstream molecular mechanisms of neuroskeletal intercommunication . It is particularly important to investigate how nociceptive ﬁ bers affect bone repair through secondary messengers . Along with NGF , semaphorin 3A ( Sema3A ) is also a well - known axon guidance molecule ( Tamagnone and Comoglio , 2004 ; Kruger et al . , 2005 ; Fukuda et al . , 2013 ) . Neuron - derived Sema3A is essential for the normal development of FIGURE 2 NGF promotes neural regeneration and MSC migration . There are two receptors for nerve growth factor ( NGF ) : tropomyosin receptor kinase A ( TrkA ) and p75 ( also known as CD271 ) . Upon bone injury , NGF produced by macrophages activates the TrkA pathway to promote nerve ﬁ ber re - innervation . Furthermore , NGF recruits mesenchymal stem cells via the p75 signaling pathway to migrate toward bone defects and enhance bone formation . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 03 Xu et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 976736 peripheral neurons in vivo and contributes to nerve growth and regeneration ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Fukuda et al . demonstrated that Sema3A produced in neurons regulated bone remodeling by modulating sensory nerve innervation to the bone ( Fukuda et al . , 2013 ) . Speci ﬁ c deletion of Sema3A in neurons resulted in lower bone mass , whereas mice with a Sema3A de ﬁ ciency speci ﬁ c to osteoblasts had normal bone mass . Further studies revealed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in the number of sensory innervations of trabecular bone in neuron - speci ﬁ c Sema3A - de ﬁ cient mice , leading to skeletal abnormalities . In contrast , sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers , which inhibit the increase in bone mass , were not signi ﬁ cantly affected . In combination with our transcriptome sequencing data ( Xu et al . , 2022 ) , we found high expression of Sema3A locally in bone injury sites . Based on its role in bone remodeling , we hypothesize that Sema3A also plays an important regulatory role in bone repair by stimulating sensory nerve innervation and thus promoting bone regeneration . However , the relative roles of Sema3A and NGF in bone regeneration need to be further explored . As the skeleton develops and fractures heal , nerve ﬁ bers are closely associated with blood vessels ( Tomlinson et al . , 2016 ; Li et al . , 2019 ) . Our study showed that nerve regeneration occurred before revascularization and contributed to vascular regrowth ( Meyers et al . , 2020 ) . Angiogenesis is promoted by sensory nerve - released SP and CGRP via neurokinin - 1 ( NK1 ) and CGRPR receptors on endothelial cells ( Marrella et al . , 2018 ) . We previously found that vascular extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) promoted MSC proliferation , migration , and differentiation and improved bone regenerative capacity ( Xu et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , nerves can indirectly regulate bone repair through the vasculature in addition to their paracrine role in regulating bone regeneration . Clear nerve - derived factors mediating bone formation , including neurotransmitters and extracellular vesicles ( Figure 3 ) , have been elucidated in several in vitro studies and regenerative contexts . Bone lineage cells express receptors for neurotransmitters or neuropeptides that can be modulated by neurogenic substances . CGRP and SP , which are derived from sensory nerves , stimulate osteogenic differentiation and bone formation . CGRP is a critical and highly expressed sensory signal . It produces in both peripheral and central neurons and can function in the transmission of nociception ( Rosenfeld et al . , 1983 ; Crenshaw et al . , 1987 ) . CGRP promoted the proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells , reduced their apoptosis and enhanced the expression of osteogenic genes and the activity of osteoblasts via inhibiting NF - κ B activation ( Mrak et al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , CGRP promoted the recruitment and cell proliferation of MSCs and enhanced osteogenic differentiation by activating mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway ( Yang et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) and upregulating the expression of alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and runt - related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) ( Fang et al . , 2013 ; Xu and Jiang , 2014 ) . Following bone injury or fracture , CGRP - containing ﬁ bers may trigger perivascular bone regeneration . Local injection of CGRP was effective in accelerating bone formation ( Jia et al . , 2019 ) . CGRP expression in the peripheral femoral cortex and dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) was signi ﬁ cantly increased following in vivo implantation of biodegradable magnesium , which promoted new bone formation ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . SP belongs to the tachykinin family and is a highly conserved 11 - amino acid neuropeptide involved in pain perception ( Hong et al . , 2009 ; Steinhoff et al . , 2014 ) . SP is expressed in the peripheral nerves and is often released together with CGRP ( Brazill et al . , 2019 ) . Similar to CGRP , SP has been shown to increase the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs ( Nagao et al . , 2014 ) . SP bound to and activated the NK - 1 receptor ( NK - 1R ) , which was expressed by bone lineage cells ( Goto et al . , 1998 ; Goto et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . SP directly regulated bone metabolism through NK - 1R ( Goto et al . , 1998 ) . SP stimulated the proliferation of BMSCs in a concentration - dependent manner . Wang et al . found that low concentrations of SP promoted ALP activity and Runx2 expression , and high FIGURE 3 Bone regeneration is regulated by nerves through paracrine action .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 04 Xu et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 976736 concentrations of SP contributed to matrix mineralization ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , SP enhanced MAPK , Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( Bmp2 ) signaling pathways as well as upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression , thereby promoting angiogenesis and osteogenic differentiation ( Hong et al . , 2009 ; Fu et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . SP also increased the mobilization of MSCs to the osteogenic region , accelerating bone remodeling and formation ( Imai et al . , 1997 ; Hong et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . Neuronal cells can also regulate bone regeneration remotely via extracellular vesicles . According to clinical studies , patients with craniocerebral injury and fractures have a faster callus formation and a shorter fracture healing time than patients with fractures alone . Xia et al . demonstrated that damaged neurons released small extracellular vesicles ( sEVs ) rich in pro - osteogenic microRNAs ( miRNAs ) after traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) ( Xia et al . , 2021 ) . Fibronectin 1 on the membrane surface of sEVs might be a key protein for brain - derived sEVs to target bone tissue . Moreover , miR - 328a - 3p and miR - 150 - 5p enriched in sEVs accelerated bone healing by regulating the transcription of FOXO4 and CBL proteins , respectively . Sympathetic signaling reduces bone mass . Sympathetic tone activation upregulated intracellular OPN expression and induced bone loss . Mechanistically , intracellular OPN reduced the cAMP - response element binding ( CREB ) phosphorylation and osteogenic differentiation via the inhibition of β 2 - adrenergic receptor ( Nagao et al . , 2011 ) . NE is the main neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system and is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine by the action of TH ( Elefteriou , 2018 ) . Adrenergic nerves release NE that inhibits bone formation . Its receptors include a - and ß - adrenergic receptors ( ARs ) , such as β 1 , β 2 , α 1B , α 2A , α 2B , and α 2C ( Grassel , 2014 ; Tank and Lee Wong , 2015 ; Brazill et al . , 2019 ; Wan et al . , 2021 ) . NE participates in the regulation of bone remodeling mainly via its β 2 receptor . Sympathetic signaling via β 2 - adrenergic receptors ( β 2 - AR ) present on osteoblasts controlled bone formation . Disruption of the noradrenergic signaling axis or knock of β 2 - AR increased bone mass ( Elefteriou et al . , 2005 ) . Mechanistically , sympathetic tone signals in osteoblasts suppressed CREB phosphorylation via β 2 - AR , thereby reducing osteoblast proliferation ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ; Kajimura et al . , 2011 ) . Du et al . found that NE inhibited stem cell migration , downregulated Runx2 and OCN expression , and prevented the formation of mineralized bone nodules via β 3 - adrenergic receptor ( Du et al . , 2014 ) . Cholinergic nerve - derived ACh and VIP , as well as adrenergic nerve - produced neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) also play important roles in bone formation . ACh functions by binding to both muscarinic ( mAChRs ) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) ( Jones et al . , 2012 ) . These receptors are expressed on bone lineage cells , suggesting that ACh may affect bone formation ( Wan et al . , 2021 ) . Ma et al . demonstrated the bene ﬁ cial effect of ACh signaling on bone mass increase , while it also promoted the maintenance of peak bone mass in adult mice ( Ma and Elefteriou , 2020 ) . Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) is a classical cholinergic hydrolase that mainly degrades acetylcholine . AChE decelerated bone growth by terminating the action of acetylcholine to balance acetylcholine concentrations at low levels , thereby promoting chondrocyte apoptosis and impeding bone mineralization . Conversely , reducing AChE increased ACh activity and promoted bone formation ( Luo et al . , 2020 ) . VIP is normally released from cholinergic neurons together with acetylcholine . There are two known receptors for the VIP termed VPAC1 and VPAC2 . VIP promoted osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by activating the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway . VIP also increased the expression of VEGF in MSCs to stimulate angiogenesis . Additionally , VIP signi ﬁ cantly boosted cranial defect repair , bone formation , and angiogenesis in vivo ( Shi et al . , 2020 ) . PKA activation by VIP resulted in the accumulation of cAMP and affected multiple signaling pathways that regulate osteoblast differentiation ( Juhasz et al . , 2016 ) . VIP also upregulated ERK 1 / 2 activation in osteoblasts ( Juhasz et al . , 2015 ) . NPY is usually accompanied by the release of NE in sympathetic nerves ( Wan et al . , 2021 ) . NPY acts through ﬁ ve G protein - coupled receptor isoforms , Y1R , Y2R , Y4R , Y5R and Y6R , of which Y1R and Y2R are usually involved in bone mass regulation ( Chen and Zhang , 2022 ) . Osteoblast - speci ﬁ c Y1 receptor knockout mice exhibited high bone mass , suggesting that the NPY - Y1R signaling axis regulates bone homeostasis ( Yahara et al . , 2017 ) . Reduced Runx2 levels and mineralized nodules after NPY - treated MSC osteogenesis con ﬁ rmed that NPY impaired osteogenic differentiation ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Blockade of NPY enhanced bone mass ( Baldock et al . , 2009 ; Lee et al . , 2010 ; Xie et al . , 2020 ) . However , some studies have also reported a positive role for NPY in bone formation and bone repair ( Chen and Zhang , 2022 ) . Low doses of NPY promoted osteogenesis and mineralization in MSCs , whereas high concentrations of NPY had the opposite effect ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . NPY overexpression signi ﬁ cantly upregulated osterix and Runx2 levels and enhanced osteogenic capacity ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . The speci ﬁ c regulatory role of NPY on bone formation needs to be further clari ﬁ ed . Nevertheless , our understanding of the exact key molecules released from nerve ﬁ bers within a bone injury site that regulate bone regeneration in vivo remains unclear and is the subject of continued investigation . Skeletal regulation of neural function Bone has long been thought to serve only as a supportive and protective organ ( Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . In the last 20 years , it has slowly become apparent that bone can also act as an endocrine organ by secreting various bone - derived factors that have regulatory effects on the central nervous system , immune system , energy metabolism , etc ( Guntur and Rosen , 2012 ; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 05 Xu et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 976736 Moser and van der Eerden , 2018 ; Du et al . , 2021 ) . OCN is a marker gene for osteogenic differentiation and is synthesized solely in osteoblasts ( Klingelhoffer et al . , 2016 ; Moser and van der Eerden , 2018 ) . It plays an important role in regulating bone calcium metabolism . OCN is considered as a multifunctional bone - derived hormone that regulates a variety of physiological activities and developmental processes ( Karsenty and Olson , 2016 ; Obri et al . , 2018 ; Qian et al . , 2021 ) . OCN regulates the neuronal function and is required for both brain development and brain function in mice ( Obri et al . , 2018 ) . Khrimian et al . found that the target receptor for OCN in the brain was the G - protein coupled receptor Gpr158 , which was expressed in neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus ( Khrimian et al . , 2017 ) . Despite this , Gpr158 was not expressed in all OCN - active brain regions , suggesting that other receptors respond to osteocalcin signaling in the mouse brain . Recently , Qian et al . demonstrated that OCN regulated the transition of oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs ) into mature oligodendrocytes ( OLs ) and was essential for OL myelination and remyelination after demyelination injury ( Qian et al . , 2021 ) . OCN de ﬁ ciency led to upregulated myelin - related gene expression and excessive myelin formation in the central nervous system . G Protein - Coupled Receptor 37 ( GPR37 ) was abundantly expressed in mature OLs and was a novel speci ﬁ c receptor for OCN . OCN suppressed myelin gene regulatory factor ( Myrf ) through GPR37 , which was required for OCN to regulate OL differentiation and myelination . This study reveals reciprocal crosstalk between bone secreted - OCN and glial cell function , providing evidence for an important role of OCN in regulating OL myelin formation . Furthermore , osteoblast - derived OCN could cross the blood - brain barrier and bind to neurons in the brainstem , midbrain , and hippocampus , enhancing the production of monoamine neurotransmitters , preventing anxiety and depression , and facilitating learning and memory . In addition to these , before the embryos synthesized OCN , the mother delivered this hormone to the fetus via the placenta to prevent neuronal apoptosis ( Oury et al . , 2013 ) . Increased prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) levels in osteoporotic mice were accompanied by a signi ﬁ cant reduction in CGRP + sensory ﬁ bers ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) . PGE2 receptor 4 ( EP4 ) is the main receptor for PGE2 ( Hawcroft et al . , 2007 ; Konya et al . , 2013 ) , which is expressed in bone sensory nerves . Chen et al . clari ﬁ ed that PGE2 secretion by osteoblasts was elevated under conditions of reduced bone mass , and this signal , transmitted through EP4 , regulated osteoblast - mediated bone formation ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) . The speci ﬁ c mechanism was that PGE2 stimulated hypothalamic CREB signaling through EP4 in sensory nerves to inhibit sympathetic tone , which in turn regulated osteoblast differentiation and promoted bone regeneration ( Figure 4 ) . During early embryonic development in mice , NGF produced by osteochondral progenitor cells promoted skeletal nerve innervation and function by activating TrkA signaling , which directed sensory nerve axons to the site of initial ossi ﬁ cation ( Tomlinson et al . , 2016 ) . In a long bone stress fracture model , we found that periosteal MSC - and osteoblast - derived NGF could regulate the reinnervation of nerves , representing the role of skeletal regulation of nerves after injury ( Li et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , MSC - derived NGF was not a key factor in regulating nerve regeneration during calvarial defect repair ( Meyers et al . , 2020 ) , suggesting that the mechanisms regulating nerve ingrowth during regeneration differ depending on the physiological site . Conclusion The peripheral nerves in the skeleton include sensory and sympathetic nerves . The mechanisms of skeletal - neural crosstalk are complex , and a rich variety of cells and factors are involved . There are still many unknown regulatory effects . In this review , we explore the role of nerves in the regulation of bone remodeling and repair and parse the effect of bone as an endocrine organ on nerves . In our research , we are more interested in the mechanisms of neural regulation of the skeleton . Innervation of bone occurs almost simultaneously with endochondral ossi ﬁ cation during embryonic development ( Bidegain et al . , 1995 ; Sisask et al . , 2013 ) . The increase in nerve density in bone coincides with bone growth and FIGURE 4 Bone regulates neural function and activity . Osteocalcin ( OCN ) released from skeleton controls oligodendrocyte ( OL ) differentiation and neural function through G - protein coupled receptors , affecting cognition and mood . Moreover , bone produces prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , which binds to EP4 receptors on sensory nerves to inhibit sympathetic nerve activity , thereby promoting bone formation .

Bone injury is accompanied by nerve damage , and nerve reinnervation is essential for bone repair . We found that MSCs , osteoblasts and macrophages all secreted NGF . NGF - expressing cells that play a key role in long bone and calvarial bone injuries are differential . The speci ﬁ c roles of skeletal and immune cells in injury repair and neural regeneration remain to be investigated . Moreover , the results from single - cell studies revealed that NGF was highly expressed in perivascular stem cells ( especially pericytes ) and that the NGF - TrkA signaling pathway promoted angiogenesis and vascular regeneration ( Graiani et al . , 2004 ; Vera et al . , 2014 ; Ahluwalia et al . , 2016 ) . The fact that EVs of vascular origin could stimulate stem cell activity and regenerate skeletal tissues suggests the diversity of NGF sources and its multiple roles . In this regard , further research is required . Signals from nerves can promote bone formation and prevent bone degeneration . Targeting pro - neural regenerative pathways or speci ﬁ c signals from peripheral nerves can accelerate bone healing . Dissecting the neuro - skeletal crosstalk could advance our understanding of bone metabolism and the pathogenesis of diseases such as osteoporosis , osteoarthritis , heterotopic ossi ﬁ cation and bone tumors , as well as identify potential targets for the mitigation and prevention of these diseases . Related research could also contribute to the development of novel bone repair materials . Materials that target both nerve and bone regeneration could offer new hope and solutions to major clinical challenges , such as large bone defects .
