This protein has emerged as a crucial molecule for functions of the nervous system including motility and guidance of the neuronal growth cone , dendritic spine organization , axonal branching , and synaptic signalling . Recently , other important functions in cell biology such as apoptosis or the control of mitochondrial function have been attributed to coﬁlin . Moreover , novel mechanisms of coﬁlin function regulation have also been described . The activity of coﬁlin is controlled by complex regulatory mechanisms , with phosphorylation being the most important , since the addition of a phosphate group to coﬁlin renders it inactive . Due to its participation in a wide variety of key processes in the cell , coﬁlin has been related to a great variety of pathologies , among which neurodegenerative diseases have attracted great interest . In this review , we summarized the functions of coﬁlin and its regulation , emphasizing how defects in these processes have been related to different neurodegenerative diseases . Keywords : coﬁlin ; neurodegenerative diseases ; coﬁlin – actin rods ; apoptosis ; mitochondrial ﬁssion ; microtubule instability 1 . Introduction In 1980 , Bamburg et al . identiﬁed a protein that acted as an actin disassembly factor in chicken brain extracts [ 1 ] . Proteins with similar functions were isolated from differ - ent organisms and tissues during the following years [ 2 ] and were grouped under the ADF / coﬁlin family , which includes actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as de - strin ) ; coﬁlin - 1 , the major ubiquitous isoform in non - muscle tissues ; and coﬁlin - 2 , the major isoform in differentiated muscle . In this review , we will focus on coﬁlin - 1 ( hereinafter called coﬁlin ) . Actin microfilaments ( F - actin ) are linear polymers composed of globular actin monomers ( G - actin ) , which are polarized with a barbed end , where the addition of available actin monomers bound to ATP occurs , and a pointed end , where actin bound to ADP is re - leased [ 3 ] . The addition and release of actin monomers allows actin microﬁlaments to be a dynamic structure capable of responding to stimuli . These actin dynamics are pos - sible thanks to accessory proteins such as the Arp2 / 3 complex and formin , involved in actin nucleation , a process of the formation of a complex composed of actin monomers from which an actin ﬁlament can elongate ; proﬁlin , involved in microﬁlament elongation ; or ADF / coﬁlin , involved in actin disassembly , although its function has been shown to vary depending on coﬁlin concentration relative to actin [ 4 ] , as Figure 1 shows . At low coﬁlin / actin ratios , coﬁlin binds to the ADP - actin region of the F - actin , and it severs ﬁla - ments in a persistent way creating new barbed and pointed ends . Then , coﬁlin is released Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / brainsci11070954 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / brainsci Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 2 of 12 from binding to an ADP - actin subunit and both can be recycled . At the same time , the pieces of F - actin generated by severing can nucleate ﬁlament growth or enhance depoly - merization if ATP - actin is limited [ 5 ] . At higher coﬁlin / actin ratios , many coﬁlin subunits bind to ADP - actin , induce conformational changes in the microﬁlament modifying its twist and sever it in a rapid , but not persistent , way as most coﬁlin is sequestered and bound to actin . Coﬁlin saturates the fragments , which are stabilized , although they can be depolymerized to generate monomers or may be used to nucleate growth [ 4 ] . Under ATP - deﬁcient conditions , stabilized actin bound to coﬁlin can form rods , slowing the actin dynamics and associated ATP hydrolysis . This mechanism allows the preservation of ATP , but if it persists , the rods can cause neurite degeneration ( reviewed below ) [ 6 ] . When even higher coﬁlin / actin ratios occur , coﬁlin can bind actin monomers and nucleate new ﬁlaments promoting polymerization [ 7 ] .

When even higher cofilin / actin ratios occur , cofilin can bind actin monomers and nucleate new fila - ments promoting polymerization [ 7 ] . Figure 1 . Function of cofilin in actin dynamics according to the cofilin / actin ratio . Cofilin has a pointed end , where actin subunits can be released from the microfilament , and a barbed end , where actin subunits can be added . ( A ) At low co - filin / actin ratios , cofilin binds to ADP - actin of filaments and severs it , creating new pointed and barbed ends . Then , cofilin binds to the generated fragments and induces depolymerization . Both cofilin and the released actin subunits can be recy - cled . ( B ) At higher cofilin / actin ratios , many cofilin subunits bind to ADP - actin , induce conformational changes in the microfilament , and sever it . However , severing is not persistent because cofilin is sequestered and bound to the microfil - ament . The generated F - actin fragments bound to cofilin are stabilized and can form rods under ATP - deficient conditions . However , cofilin has been recently related to cellular processes other than actin mi - crofilament disassembly . For example , cofilin could take part in rod formation , apoptosis induction , mitochondrial dynamics , microtubule instability , or even in the regulation of the gene expression [ 8 – 10 ] . Alterations in these processes could trigger pathological con - ditions such as neurodegenerative diseases . Neurons are cells susceptible to cytoskeleton disturbances that can lead to deficiencies in axonal transport . In addition , neurons present a high energetic demand , which , to be satisfied , requires that mitochondrial dynamics works properly [ 11 – 13 ] . However , not only neurons are involved in the correct function - ing of the nervous system . The role of glial cells is essential by providing support to neu - rons in relevant processes including synapses , neuronal plasticity , brain fluid transport mediated by the glymphatic system , and the inflammatory response [ 14 – 17 ] . As in neu - rons , cofilin could cause alterations in glial functions or morphology changes and , conse - quently , lead to neurodegenerative diseases [ 18 ] . In this regard , great advances have been Figure 1 . Function of coﬁlin in actin dynamics according to the coﬁlin / actin ratio .

In addition , neurons present a high energetic demand , which , to be satisﬁed , requires that mitochondrial dynamics works properly [ 11 – 13 ] . However , not only neurons are involved in the correct functioning of the nervous system . The role of glial cells is essential by providing support to neurons in relevant processes including synapses , neuronal plasticity , brain ﬂuid transport mediated by the glymphatic system , and the inﬂammatory response [ 14 – 17 ] . As in neurons , coﬁlin could cause alterations in glial functions or morphology changes and , consequently , lead to neurodegenerative diseases [ 18 ] . In this regard , great advances have been made to discover how coﬁlin and its regulatory mechanisms may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 3 of 12 such as Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) , Huntington’s disease ( HD ) , or Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) [ 19 – 21 ] .

In this review , we analyse the main mechanisms through which cofilin , and its regulation could be taking part in the pathology of different neurodegenerative diseases ( Figure 2 ) . Figure 2 . Role and regulation of cofilin in neurodegeneration . Cofilin function depends on the phos - phorylation of its Ser3 residue , among others . When Ser3 is dephosphorylated by CIN and SSH1 , cofilin enters an active state that can be enhanced by A β oligomer accumulation . On the other hand , LIMK and TESK can phosphorylate , and thus , inactivate cofilin . Parkin can interfere with cofilin phosphorylation by blocking LIMK function . Under oxidative stress conditions , active and oxidized cofilin can be translocated into the mitochondria , allowing it to take part in mitochondrial fission . This process is mediated by both active cofilin and the DRP1 protein and can be induced by activa - tion of the ROCK pathway . Mitochondrial fission , in turn , triggers the release of the cytochrome C , leading to apoptosis . Apoptosis can also begin with the cofilin / p53 pathway , although inactive co - filin can prevent it activating PLD1 . Moreover , active and oxidized cofilin can form cofilin – actin rods . The rods have been found to colocalize in the nucleus with huntingtin . Cofilin can also enter the nucleus together with actin through importin - 9 .

Coﬁlin Regulation and Its Implication in Neurodegenerative Diseases Coﬁlin can undergo post - translational modiﬁcations that regulate its function and , among these , phosphorylation stands out . Phospho - regulation of coﬁlin is mediated by signalling pathways in response to extracellular signals . This signal transduction is very complex , and numerous studies have been carried out to characterize it [ 22 ] . Coﬁlin is inactive when it is phosphorylated on its Ser3 residue by LIM - domain containing kinases 1 and 2 ( LIMK1 y LIMK2 ) and testis - speciﬁc kinases 1 and 2 ( TESK1 y TESK2 ) . LIMK1 is in turn activated by the small GTPase Rho and its downstream Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) [ 23 ] , and TESK1 is activated downstream of an integrin signal . Both contribute to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton . The phosphatases chronophin ( CIN ) and slingshot ( SSH1 ) remove the phosphate of Ser3 , activating coﬁlin and accelerating the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton [ 24 ] . However , in addition , the regulation of coﬁlin has to be spatiotemporally controlled to obtain a precise actin cytoskeleton reorganization . While coﬁlin is expressed in almost all tissues and cells , distinctly different expression patterns of LIMKs , TESKs , and SSHs exist [ 22 ] . Moreover , other regulatory mechanisms of coﬁlin are known . Dephosphorylation by CIN and SSH is enhanced when ATP levels are low and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) high [ 25 , 26 ] , demonstrating how oxidative stress plays a role in the regulation of coﬁlin activity . Moreover , coﬁlin function is also directly regulated by the oxidation of its cysteine residues [ 27 ] . Oxidized coﬁlin can induce the formation of an intramolecular disulﬁde bridge in vivo and the loss of its Ser3 phosphorylation site . This activated and oxidized coﬁlin is responsible for inducing the apoptosis cascade through its translocation to the mitochondria [ 28 ] . In addition , coﬁlin oxidation can induce not only intramolecular but also intermolecular disulﬁde bonds between coﬁlin molecules . In these cases , coﬁlin – actin rod formation is enhanced , thus preventing the cell from entering apoptosis [ 29 ] . Apart from phosphorylation and oxidation , other regulatory mechanisms have been proposed . For example , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is a membrane phospholipid that inhibits coﬁlin activity by competing with actin at the binding site [ 30 ] . High - pH conditions could also regulate the activity of coﬁlin by increasing it [ 31 ] . Coﬁlin phosphorylation at its Y68 residue induces coﬁlin ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome , adding another regulation mechanism [ 32 ] . According to current evidence , it seems clear that coﬁlin is involved in neurodegen - erative processes , as we will describe in the following paragraphs , and more speciﬁcally , the regulation of coﬁlin function has also been associated with different disease states . However , much remains to be known about the complex regulatory mechanisms of this protein and how they are affected in different neurodegenerative diseases . Mutations in the Parkin 2 ( PARK ) gene are the main cause of autosomal recessive parkinsonism , a type of early onset familial PD , and also seem to play a role in sporadic PD . Parkin is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that ubiquitinates dysfunctional proteins for their degradation in the proteasome . The loss of parkin activity leads to the accumulation of parkin substrates . These have been proposed as a cause for toxicity and neurodegeneration through mechanisms that are not completely understood [ 33 ] . Previous studies had already shown that parkin was associated with actin ﬁlaments by colocalizing with them , so it was suggested that parkin could have a role in actin stabilization [ 34 ] . According to this ﬁnding , Lim et al . observed that parkin interacts with and ubiquitinates LIMK1 in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line BE ( 2 ) - M17 but not in the human embryonic kidney - derived cell line HEK293 , indicating a tissue - speciﬁc regulation . As a result , since LIMK1 phosphorylates coﬁlin , LIMK1 ubiquitination by PARK2 reduces the level of inactive coﬁlin [ 35 ] . Overall , parkin modulates the level of phosphocoﬁlin by negatively regulating LIMK1 activity in a cell - type - dependent way , which can help understand how coﬁlin contributes to familial PD . Friedreich’s ataxia ( FRDA ) is an inherited peripheral neuropathy characterized by an early loss of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia , among other clinical symptoms caused by frataxin deﬁciency . Cytoskeletal abnormalities have been proposed to contribute to dying - Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 5 of 12 back neurodegeneration in FRDA [ 24 ] . In fact , at the molecular level , the F - actin : G - actin ratio has been shown to be increased in sensory neurons of FRDA mice , suggesting an alteration of the normal turnover of actin ﬁlaments . This disturbance could be the cause of the changes observed in the morphology of the growth cones of FRDA mouse neurons [ 36 ] . The authors observed a hyperactivation of coﬁlin in the dorsal nerve roots of the FRDA mouse model compared to controls , which can be partially explained by the increased levels of CIN [ 36 ] . Altogether , the dysregulation of coﬁlin might explain the reduced neurite growth and alterations of cytoskeleton , suggesting a role in FRDA neuropathy . Regulation of active coﬁlin could also be involved in AD . A signiﬁcant reduction of total SSH1 phosphatase in AD brains could be the cause of the increased coﬁlin inactivation observed in human samples . γ - Secretase is an enzyme that makes the second cleavage to amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) to give rise to the amyloid - β ( A β ) peptides , whose pathological accumulation is related to AD . This enzyme has been discovered to takes part in promoting actin / coﬁlin - related pathology . In this sense , γ - secretase inhibitors promote coﬁlin activation by increasing SSH1 levels in mouse primary cortical neurons [ 37 ] . However , other authors point to the excessive coﬁlin activation , and not the opposite , as the cause of AD pathogenesis . For example , Kim et al . suggest that the binding of A β oligomers to the leukocyte immunoglobulin - like receptor B2 ( LilrB2 ) present in human brain enhances coﬁlin signalling , which leads to synapse elimination [ 38 ] . The contribution of active coﬁlin to AD pathogenesis does not seem to be limited only to its levels since its location also has an inﬂuence . Coﬁlin is translocated to the spine upon long - term potentiation induction and promotes the assembly of F - actin , essential for spine expansion and to potentiate synaptic transmission . This activity - dependent plasticity phenomenon is altered in the hippocampus of AD patients , with coﬁlin having a potential role in this defect since it is aberrantly localized in neuron spines [ 39 ] . The authors showed how downregulation of cyclase - associated protein 2 ( CAP2 ) , by synergizing with coﬁlin to accelerate depolymerization of the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments , is able to control coﬁlin synaptic availability in long - term potentiation processes that , as it is known , are extremely important for stabilizing memory . It seems clear that the regulation of coﬁlin is crucial for the activity and function of the protein , so that alterations in the coﬁlin regulation mechanisms trigger pathological processes such as neurodegenerative diseases . 3 . New Functions for Coﬁlin in Neurodegenerative Diseases Chua et al . have shown that after staurosporine - induced apoptosis , active coﬁlin can translocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria , leading to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the release of cytochrome C , which is the ﬁrst step in the apoptotic cell death cascade [ 28 ] . This suggests that coﬁlin has an important function during the initiation phase of apoptosis . In this regard , the translocation of coﬁlin to mitochondria has been also linked to mitochondrial ﬁssion , a process in which coﬁlin would participate regulating the function of the dynamin - related protein 1 ( Drp1 ) [ 40 ] . Moreover , coﬁlin could also be translocated to the nucleus due to its nuclear localization sequence [ 41 ] . In this context , coﬁlin has been suggested to participate in actin import to the nucleus , where actin can regulate gene expression [ 42 ] . Even inactive coﬁlin , a form that was thought to have no function , has been shown to have stimulatory effects on phospholipase D1 ( PLD1 ) , an enzyme involved in a wide variety of cellular responses , including calcium mobilization , superoxide production , endocytosis , vesicle trafﬁcking , etc . [ 43 ] . All these processes , highly related to neurodegeneration , point towards coﬁlin as a key protein involved in many neurological diseases , but its role in the pathophysiology of these diseases still remains to be elucidated . Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 6 of 12 3 . 1 . Coﬁlin Oxidation Leads to Coﬁlin – Actin Rod Formation Coﬁlin – actin rods are inclusions that contain coﬁlin and actin in a 1 : 1 ratio , formed in axons and dendrites of stressed neurons . Rods can be assembled in response to different stimuli , including sublethal doses of glutamate , hydrogen peroxide , or ATP depletion , although all the mechanisms of rod formation converge in an increase in the pool of dephos - phorylated / activated coﬁlin by the action of phosphatases [ 44 ] . In this context , coﬁlin binds with high afﬁnity to ADP - actin , saturating it and forming rods , as Figure 1 shows . Actin in rods is less dynamic , which avoids the ATP hydrolysis associated with actin ﬁlament turnover . As a result , the formation of rods transiently protects neurons in declining ATP situations . Coﬁlin – actin rods can be reversible when the insult is ended but , if it persists , rods may block intracellular trafﬁcking and induce synaptic disfunction , contributing to neurodegeneration and ageing [ 6 , 45 ] . In fact , rods were found in the hippocampal and cortical neurons of the post - mortem brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease [ 44 ] . Mal - oney et al . proposed a feedforward model to explain neurodegeneration in AD in relation to coﬁlin – actin rods . The authors observed that both the pathological accumulation of A β peptides , which occurs in familial AD , and the neuronal stress ( ischaemia , oxidative stress , excitotoxic insults , etc . ) involved in sporadic AD can result in rod formation in the presence of phosphatases responsible for activating coﬁlin [ 46 ] . Rod formation can , in turn , block the transport of vesicles containing APP , β - secretase , and γ - secretase . These stalled vesicles supply a site for A β production , which triggers rod formation in surrounding neurons , exacerbating neurodegeneration [ 47 ] . Coﬁlin – actin rods have also been related to other neurodegenerative diseases such as HD . Some studies proposed that coﬁlin – actin rods can also be located inside the nucleus instead of in the cytoplasm under various stressful cellular conditions [ 48 , 49 ] . In fact , Munsie et al . described that , under stress conditions such as heat shock or DMSO - induced stress , huntingtin , the protein whose mutated form causes HD , was localized in the nuclear coﬁlin – actin rods in a mouse - neuron - derived cell line and in primary mouse hippocampal neurons . Moreover , once cells had recovered from stress , nuclear rods were persistent only when mutant huntingtin was present , suggesting that huntingtin could have a role in actin remodelling in response to stress [ 21 ] . 3 . 2 . Coﬁlin Takes Part in Microglia Activation Which Leads to Neuroinﬂammation Neuroinﬂammation involves the activation of glial cells , especially microglia and astrocytes , which precedes and causes neuronal degeneration . In response to an increase in inﬂammatory cytokines , microglia and astrocytes undergo morphological and molecular changes that result in glial reactivity . Coﬁlin participates in the morphological changes of microglia and astrocytes in re - sponse to neuroinﬂammatory process [ 18 ] . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced microglial cell activation was studied in a coﬁlin - knockdown cellular model , conﬁrming a reduction in microglial activation and the protection of neurons from neurotoxicity [ 50 ] . The authors propose that LPS , by binding to the toll - like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , activates the SRC kinase that most likely promotes coﬁlin dephosphorylation through the SHH phosphatase . Thus , morphological changes , proliferation , migration , and the phagocytosis of microglial cells were altered . Moreover , coﬁlin could also act on the transcription factors STAT1 and NF - kB , which , in turn , initiate neurotoxicity through the expression of cytotoxic factors [ 50 ] . After a large inﬂammatory response , microglia adopt a phagocytic phenotype ( neuro - protective phenotype ) for the removal of cellular debris . It is in this action where coﬁlin intervenes , promoting the cytoskeletal dynamics and leading to a change to ameboid morphology and phagocytic activity of the microglia [ 51 ] . 3 . 3 . Coﬁlin Mediates Actin Depolymerization for Myelin Wrapping The formation of myelin is important for the correct function of motor and sensory neurons . During the development of the central nervous system , oligodendrocyte precursor cells are responsible for extending a network of processes to contact axons and initiate Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 7 of 12 myelination [ 52 ] . In this action , the dynamics of the cytoskeleton is vital , and any alteration in both the formation and repair of myelin generates neurodegenerative diseases such as AD , multiple sclerosis , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or psychiatric diseases [ 53 – 55 ] . It is well described that the initiation of myelination requires actin polymerization , while depolymerization is associated with myelin wrapping [ 52 ] . In this process , the coﬁlin must move to the oligodendrocyte membrane mediated by myelin basic protein ( MBP ) , which facilitates actin depolymerization and , therefore , the wrapping process [ 56 ] . A protein necessary for the myelination and myelin repair processes is cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( CDK5 ) . The Cdk5 KO mouse exhibits hypomyelination and a reduction in the number of Ranvier’s nodules . Molecular studies showed that low levels of p - coﬁlin together with p - CREB were associated with these phenomena , suggesting that these pathways were affected by low levels of myelin [ 57 ] . Recently , it has been observed that the regulation of actin polymerization during the initiation of myelination is determined by mTOR [ 58 ] . In these studies , the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was added to primary oligodendrocyte cultures , observing a decrease in inactive coﬁlin levels while total coﬁlin levels did not change . Nevertheless , in addition , signalling after mTOR inhibition reduces both MBP levels and its correct location in the membrane , which directly affects myelin wrapping [ 58 ] . 3 . 4 . Coﬁlin Translocation into the Mitochondria Induces Apoptosis As aforementioned , upon oxidative stress conditions , active coﬁlin becomes oxidized on its cysteine residues and , consequently , coﬁlin is translocated into the mitochondria . In this organelle , oxidized coﬁlin induces apoptosis through the release of cytochrome C . HTT2 cells ( hippocampus - derived neuroblastoma cell line ) treated with A β oligomers showed an increased translocation of coﬁlin to the mitochondria . However , the transloca - tion was signiﬁcantly prevented with the RNAi - mediated knockdown of the phosphatase SSH1 , suggesting that A β oligomers promote apoptosis trough the activation and transloca - tion of coﬁlin into the mitochondria via SSH1 . The same authors isolated the mitochondrial fraction from the frontal cortex of AD patients and compared it with age - matched cogni - tively normal controls . They observed a signiﬁcant increase in total and oxidized coﬁlin oligomers , as well as in coﬁlin monomers , reinforcing the idea that activated and oxidized mitochondrial coﬁlin has a pathogenic role in AD [ 59 ] . The mechanism by which A β oligomers promote actin – coﬁlin pathology in AD by both promoting rod formation and apoptosis is not fully understood yet . RanBP9 , a protein known to promote A β oligomers production by scaffolding LRP / APP / integrins complexes , could take part in this process because RanBP9 overexpression promotes A β - induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis , which is independent of its capacity to promote A β generation [ 60 ] . Moreover , RanBP9 promotes coﬁlin activation via activating phosphatase SSH1 . In transgenic mice exhibiting reduced RanBP9 protein , signiﬁcant decreases in SSH1 protein could be observed , indicating that RanBP9 positively regulates SSH1 levels [ 61 ] . Another study has observed that active and oxidized coﬁlin , through A β accumulation and oxidative stress , binds p53 protein and promotes the translocation of this complex into the mitochondria . Once this complex is translocated , it activates the mitochondria - mediated apoptosis pathway . Meanwhile , coﬁlin enhances F - actin depolymerization , which would lead to p53 translocation into the nucleus according to previous studies that showed that actin polymerization impairs p53 nuclear import . Nuclear location of p53 would drive the transcription of the pro - apoptotic mitochondrial protein , suggesting that coﬁlin is involved in both direct mitochondrial and indirect nuclear apoptosis . SSH1 activation by RanBP9 could be an upstream factor that is involved in the coﬁlin – p53 apoptosis pathway . Moreover , the same study shows that inactive coﬁlin can activate PLD1 , which inhibits coﬁlin / p53 complex formation and p53 translocation to the nucleus . Thus , PLD1 negatively regulates the coﬁlin / p53 - mediated apoptosis pathway [ 62 ] . Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 8 of 12 3 . 5 . Coﬁlin Induces Mitochondrial Fission Mitochondrial dynamics ( ﬁssion and fusion ) is a key process controlling cell death , mitophagy , organelle distribution , transport , and bioenergetics in the cell [ 11 ] . Neurons require large amounts of energy to carry out their functions , so they are especially sensitive to changes in mitochondrial dynamics . In fact , failures in this process have been related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Charcot – Marie – Tooth , AD , PD , or HD [ 63 ] . Drp1 is a GTPase that constricts the mitochondrial outer membrane , enhancing mito - chondrial ﬁssion . To carry out its function , Drp1 must be recruited at the mitochondrial surface in a process promoted by actin polymerization . Regarding this , in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts , active coﬁlin would act as a negative regulator of mitochondrial Drp1 activity and , thus , of mitochondrial ﬁssion by ﬁne - tuning actin dynamics at the mitochondrial surface [ 40 ] . However , other authors point to both active coﬁlin and Drp1 translocation to the mitochondria as necessary for mitochondrial ﬁssion . Hu et al . have shown that ROCK1 activation results in the dephosphorylation of Drp1 and coﬁlin via serine / threonine phos - phatases ( PP1 / PP2 ) in cancer cells , leading to the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 and coﬁlin , which results in mitochondrial ﬁssion [ 64 ] . Furthermore , mitochondrial ﬁs - sion would activate the apoptosis process due to the release of cytochrome C [ 65 ] . In PD , ROCK1 has been described to promote aberrant mitochondrial ﬁssion by inducing the dephosphorylation / activation of Drp1 , resulting in dopaminergic nerve cell apoptosis [ 20 ] . Recently , an approach to treat neurodegeneration in PD by the conversion of astrocytes to new dopaminergic neurons , which provide axons to reconstruct the nigrostriatal circuit , has been developed [ 66 ] . 3 . 6 . Coﬁlin Mediates Microtubule Instability Tauopathies are a type of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumu - lation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated protein tau , a microtubule - associated protein , in neuronal / glial inclusions . Tau accumulation is found in Pick’s disease , frontotempo - ral dementia , or AD , in which it is a hallmark in addition to the presence of β - amyloid plaques [ 67 ] . Coﬁlin has been discovered to not only regulate the action of A β peptides in AD , as previously mentioned , but also to participate in the pathological accumulation of tau in the inclusions . In this sense , active coﬁlin competes with tau for direct microtubule binding , displacing it from microtubules and inhibiting tau - induced microtubule assem - bly . Displaced tau is then accumulated , and it can be phosphorylated by several kinases , promoting tauopathy [ 10 , 68 ] . 3 . 7 . Coﬁlin Regulates Gene Expression For many years , the location of actin was open to debate since actin did not present a nuclear localization sequence and , therefore , presence in this organelle was assigned to cytosolic contamination caused due to its high expression levels . Many subsequent studies conﬁrmed that the presence of actin in the nucleus was indeed real and that it even had a very relevant role in transcription and transcriptional regulation through a sophisticated mechanism in eukaryotic cells ( for a review see [ 69 ] ) . Cells can reach a high level of gene expression regulation by tuning the state and levels of actin . It is at this point where coﬁlin comes into action by being responsible for the active transport of actin into the nucleus . Coﬁlin has a nuclear localization sequence , recognized by importin - 9 , which allows the translocation of both proteins from the cytosol to the nucleus [ 42 ] . Furthermore , some authors suggest that coﬁlin could actually have a direct role in the regulation of gene expression , since increasing nuclear actin levels independently of coﬁlin does not affect the transcription levels [ 42 ] . It remains unclear how actin and / or coﬁlin have an effect on transcriptional regulation , whether it has a global or a more speciﬁc effect . In this regard , some experiments have demonstrated that the effect could target speciﬁc gene programmes and lead to reprogramming and cellular differentiation [ 70 ] . It is interesting to emphasize that this same regulatory mechanism could be present at the mitochondrial DNA level [ 71 ] , since the localization of both proteins in these organelles has been observed . Brain Sci . 2021 , 11 , 954 9 of 12 4 . Future Perspectives Coﬁlin has a main role in actin dynamics and , therefore , in cytoskeletal homeostasis . However , current evidence on its new functions seems to show that coﬁlin also contributes to degenerative processes through the formation of coﬁlin – actin rods that impair axonal transport and promotion of neuronal cell death , or by changes in mitochondrial dynam - ics and in the endoplasmic reticulum – mitochondria ( ER – mitochondria ) connection and communication . However , much remains to be known about coﬁlin , starting with its complex regulatory mechanisms . This is a key piece to understand how the modulation of coﬁlin activity and levels could be a critical point in neurodegenerative diseases to modify its natural history . At this point , the question arises as to whether coﬁlin could be used as a neurodegenerative progression biomarker . In this sense , coﬁlin 2 expression was demonstrated to be signiﬁcantly increased in the serum of Alzheimer’s disease patients , and it performed well as a diagnostic and non - invasive biomarker with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity [ 72 ] . Thus , the biggest challenge is to determine whether coﬁlin is a potential target for neurodegenerative diseases , which can open new possibilities for drug development with the purpose , for example , of preventing mitochondrial alteration and axonopathy in neurodegenerative diseases . Another therapeutic approach could be to design drugs that target coﬁlin - regulatory proteins since many of the pathological processes related to coﬁlin are due to alterations in its regulation . Anyway , the recent advances in the use of high - throughput screening and computer - aided drug design can help in the search of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases [ 73 ] .
