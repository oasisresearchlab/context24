This article outlines a network approach to the study of technological change . We propose that new inventions reshape networks of interlinked technologies by shift - ing inventors’ attention to or away from the knowledge on which those inventions build . Using this approach , we develop novel indexes of the extent to which a new invention con - solidates or destabilizes existing technology streams . We apply these indexes in analyses of university research commercialization and ﬁnd that , although federal research funding pushes campuses to create inventions that are more destabilizing , deeper commercial ties lead them to produce technologies that consolidate the status quo . By quantifying the eﬀects that new technologies have on their predecessors , the indexes we propose allow patent - based studies of innovation to capture conceptually important phenomena that are not detectable with established measures . The measurement approach presented here oﬀers empirical insights that support theoretical development in studies of innovation , entrepreneurship , technology strategy , science policy , and social network theory .

New products and new methods compete with the old products and old methods not on equal terms but at a decisive advantage that may mean death to the latter . ( Schumpeter 1942 , p . 32 ) 1 . Introduction Foundational theories of technological change distin - guish between two types of new technologies . The ﬁrst “come to exist as entities that depart in some deep sense from what went before” ( Arthur 2007 , p . 274 ; Mokyr 1990 ) . Recombinant DNA made a radical departure from existing drug discovery methods that had relied on massive screening of potentially ther - apeutic compounds ( Henderson and Cockburn 1996 , Gambardella 1995 ) . Inventions like this can transform the fortunes of organizations and industries . A second type of new technology builds on and enhances its pre - decessors and therefore has the result of consolidating ( not challenging ) the status quo . In one classic study , Enos ( 1962 ) describes four waves of improvements in processes for manufacturing gasoline . Although new technologies of this type are sometimes dubbed “incre - mental , ” they may make substantial improvements over their predecessors and they account for the lion’s share of economic and social welfare returns from technological progress ( Enos 1958 , Rosenberg 1982 , David 1990 ) . Despite the substantive and theoretical importance of diﬀerentiating between these two types of technolo - gies , no quantitative measure exists to capture this distinction . Systematic explanations for why , when , and how particular inventions have diﬀerential eﬀects on their environment remain elusive . Assessments of technological dynamics traditionally relied on detailed case studies of particular technologies ( Dosi 1982 , Bresnahan and Greenstein 1996 , Goldfarb 2005 , Arthur 2009 ) . Quantitative studies exploded with the intro - duction of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) U . S . Patent Citations Data File in the late 1990s ( Hall et al . 2002 ) and led to many productive insights . However , the patent literature’s focus on cita - tion counts and forward - citation - based measures of impact has become a limitation , because many dimen - sions of technological change cannot be seen by observ - ing the simple magnitude of an invention’s later use . Attending to the impact of a new invention without also considering how it relates to already extant tech - nologies creates bias and ambiguity in analyses . The inability to systematically measure fundamen - tal concepts has made theoretical development chal - lenging in many areas . Consider work on university 791 Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 792 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS research commercialization . Since the 1980 passage of the Bayh – Dole Act ( Public Law 96 - 517 , 94 Stat . 3015 ) , a law that allowed organizations to seek patents and issue licenses on inventions made with federal funding , scholarly debate has raged over the con - sequences of commercial activity for university sci - ence . Although proponents emphasize universities’ ability to make transformative discoveries , detractors worry that commercial engagement pushes campuses to focus on narrow pursuits that are attractive to indus - try . Empirical research has been unable to adjudi - cate between these positions . Part of the challenge is that forward - citation - based measures of universities’ patent impact are unable to determine whether corpo - rate engagement results in greater alignment between industrial interests and academic priorities . Indeed , studies ﬁnd that both industrial and more traditional academic funding sources yield higher - impact patents ( e . g . , Owen - Smith and Powell 2003 ) . Such ﬁndings help to establish that public and corporate partners both select high - quality projects , but they do little to adju - dicate the key substantive question for studies of aca - demic commercialization . Computational advances are creating opportuni - ties for extracting deeper insights from large - scale databases like the U . S . Patent Citations Data File . In the area of technological change , a quantitative measure that leverages these advances to distinguish between technologies that depart from or reinforce established trajectories would allow empirical studies to better match foundational theories and may facilitate new conceptual development . To create such a measure , we begin with a network conception of technolog - ical change . New discoveries are additions to pre - existing networks of complementary or substitutable components . Inventions alter the structure of these net - works by creating relationships among technologies and changing the way subsequent additions connect . Networks of technologies evolve as inventions consol - idate or destabilize the status quo by increasing or decreasing the use of incumbent technologies . We build on studies that distinguish between tech - nologies that render ﬁrm capabilities obsolete ( and therefore are competency destroying ) and those that improve the value of capabilities ( and therefore are competency enhancing ) ( Abernathy and Clark 1985 , Tushman and Anderson 1986 , Christensen 1997 ) . How - ever , our approach diﬀers from these works . First , studies of competency - enhancing and competency - destroying inventions focus on major changes , i . e . , dis - continuities that fundamentally break with existing standards ( Tripsas 1997 , Kaplan et al . 2003 , Feldman and Yoon 2012 ) . By contrast , we suggest that a new technology’s inﬂuence on the status quo is a matter of degree , not categorical diﬀerence , and we make this observation a focal point of our indexes . Second , our approach decouples the consolidating or destabilizing eﬀects of new technologies from organizations’ compe - tencies . Although the implications of new inventions are felt forcefully in terms of how they inﬂuence incum - bents’ capabilities ( Benner 2007 ; Sosa 2009 , 2011 ) , their eﬀects ripple more broadly through dynamic networks of prior and subsequent technologies . Using our network model of technological change , we propose a measure , the CD t index , that quantiﬁes the extent to which an invention consolidates or desta - bilizes the subsequent use of the components on which it builds . Combining our CD t index with an impact weight yields an additional mCD t index that charac - terizes the magnitude of an invention’s consolidation or destabilization of the status quo . These indexes are sensitive to the enhancing and destructive eﬀects of important new technologies . Applying these measures to the context of univer - sity research commercialization , we ﬁnd clear evi - dence that , when universities have greater commercial engagement , they tend to create technologies that con - solidate the status quo but , when they receive more federal funding for academic research , they tend to produce more destabilizing inventions . Commercial engagement and federal support are both positively associated with forward citations of university patents . This important ﬁnding points to the challenge of rely - ing on forward - citation - based impact measures to dis - tinguish among patents . In what follows , we ﬁrst review existing measures . Next , we present our CD t and mCD t indexes . Sub - sequent sections use patent data in four validation exercises . First , we demonstrate that our indexes dis - criminate among patents along dimensions that are known to be associated with the destabilizing or con - solidating nature of technologies . Second , we present case studies that illustrate core features of our indexes while attesting to their ability to identify recognized breakthroughs . Third , we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with regressions that compare patents’ impact with their scores on the CD t and mCD t indexes . Finally , we present several diﬀerent aggregate ver - sions of our measures and evaluate their potential for organizational - level analyses in models that exam - ine how features of the academic research enterprise explain characteristics of university patents . 2 . Measuring the Eﬀects of Technologies 2 . 1 . Existing Measures Many quantitative metrics treat technologies as vari - able in their impact , i . e . , the extent to which they are later used . Although the true impact of a technology is diﬃcult to measure , citations of papers and patents are a common proxy ( Griliches 1990 , Trajtenberg 1990 , Harhoﬀ et al . 1999 , Hall and Trajtenberg 2004 , Lanjouw and Schankerman 2004 , Wuchty et al . 2007 , Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 793 Schoenmakers and Duysters 2010 ) . Impact measures are attractive because they correspond to the intuitive idea that new technologies that oﬀer improvements over the state of the art should become more widely used than less valuable inventions . However , because they focus on the magnitude of future use , impact mea - sures of technologies miss the key substantive distinc - tion between new things that are valuable because they reinforce the status quo and new things that are valu - able because they challenge the existing order . In short , impact measures are good for evaluating the extent to which new inventions are used , but they are limited because they oﬀer no insight into how they are used and what those uses do to shape future trajectories , a central objective of evolutionary theories of change ( Arthur 2007 , 2009 ; Dosi 1982 ; Nelson and Winter 1982 ; Verspagen 2007 ) . This ambiguity makes it problem - atic to use impact measures to develop and test such theories . We argue that , to understand a new technology’s eﬀects , it is necessary to look not only at its impact , but also how the technology ﬁts into existing trajec - tories . Measures that consider only the magnitude of a technology’s later use miss the crucial point that new technologies emerge in environments that are comprised of other technologies ( Arthur 2007 , 2009 ) . Existing approaches are therefore unable to describe the substantial eﬀects that inventions may have on the subsequent use of their technological predecessors or the evolution of broader technological trajectories . We describe a new measure designed to capture these very eﬀects by appeal to network science . 2 . 2 . Consolidating and Destabilizing Technologies Our measure has four core features . First , and most important , it is structural in a network sense , able to capture the extent to which future inventions that build on a technology also rely on that technology’s pre - decessors . This second - order view of impact implies that an invention’s importance stems both from how it inﬂuences the use of other technologies and its own direct use . Second , the measure is dynamic , able to account for variation in the extent to which an invention alters the use of its predecessors over time . Third , the measure is continuous , able to cap - ture degrees of consolidation and destabilization rang - ing from large - scale transformations to smaller - scale , incremental shifts . Finally , the measure is valenced , able to distinguish between consolidating and destabi - lizing technologies that may have similar impact but diﬀerent consequences for the status quo . We developed our measure using utility patents granted by the U . S . Patent and Trademark Oﬃce ( USPTO ) . Utility patents cover the majority of patented inventions . They include any new or improved method , process , machine , manufactured item , or chemical compound . Although other categories exist for design patents , which are granted for ornamental designs of functional items , and plant patents , which cover plant breeds , most patents granted in the United States are in the utility category , over 90 % in 1999 ( Hall et al . 2002 ) . We focus on utility patents to help to avoid com - plexities that arise from diﬀerences in citation practices across categories . Patents are attractive for our purposes because the USPTO requires inventors to include citations of rele - vant technological predecessors ( known as “prior art” ) in their patent documents . Before being granted , all patents go through an evaluation process in which examiners review these citations for comprehensive - ness . Applicants have incentives to make accurate citations : listing irrelevant predecessors weakens a patent’s enforceability , but failing to acknowledge related work can invalidate a patent . 1 2 . 3 . Measure Development The CD t index characterizes how future inventions make use of the technological predecessors cited by a focal patent . Our intuition is that citations of prede - cessors should decrease after a destabilizing invention is introduced because the technology entails a break with past ways of thinking . By contrast , consolidating inventions should be cited together with their prede - cessors and therefore increase citations of technologies on which they build . The networks in the bottom left and right panels of Figure 1 illustrate this idea . The bottom left panel of Figure 1 depicts a hypo - thetical patent that is maximally destabilizing . The focal invention ( black diamond ) cites four predeces - sor technologies ( gray diamonds ) . These citations con - tribute to the impact of earlier inventions and indicate the focal patent’s technological lineage . On the right side of the panel , six subsequent patents ( white cir - cles ) cite the focal invention , but note that none of these future patents ( or “forward citations” ) also cite the focal invention’s technological predecessors . The focal patent is destabilizing because it directs the atten - tion of subsequent inventors and examiners away from technologies that were relevant to its conceptualiza - tion . The bottom right panel of Figure 1 shows a focal patent that has identical impact to the one in the left panel ( as measured by forward citations ) but is maximally consolidating . As illustrated by the white squares , each future patent also cites at least one of the focal patent’s predecessors , and therefore this hypo - thetical patent appears to consolidate the use of these earlier technologies . 2 Drawing on the tools of network science , we devel - oped our measure by conceptualizing patents as nodes in tripartite networks ( or “graphs” ) . 3 A tripartite graph , denoted G (cid:3) ( V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , E ) , is a network with three generic types or categories of nodes , V 1 , V 2 , Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 794 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS Figure 1 .

For simplicity , we eliminate the weighting parameter w it by setting it to 1 . and V 3 , and ties ( or “edges” ) E that connect nodes of diﬀerent types . The edges in our graphs are directed because citations point from one patent to another , and our graphs are acyclic because patents only cite inven - tions that are temporally prior and therefore there are no paths that begin and end with the same patent ( or “node” ) . Using this notation , let V 1 consist of a focal patent , f , that we seek to evaluate ; V 2 consist of predecessor inventions , b , cited by the focal patent ; and V 3 consist of a set of future patents , i , that eventually cite the focal patent and / or its predecessors . Types f and b are ﬁxed at focal patent’s issue date , but i can grow as time passes and the patent and / or its predecessors accrue new citations . Our objective is to characterize how a new patent , i , joins the network deﬁned by the ties ( citations ) between patents of type b and f . New patents may join in one of three ways : ( 1 ) i can cite the focal patent’s predecessors ( type b ) , ( 2 ) i can cite the focal patent ( type f ) , or ( 3 ) i can cite the focal patent and its predecessors ( both types f and b ) . For a focal patent and vector i (cid:3) ( i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i n − 1 , i n ) of future patents that cite the focal patent and / or its technological pre - decessors at time t , we deﬁne the CD t index as CD t (cid:3) 1 n t n (cid:88) i (cid:3) 1 − 2 f it b it + f it w it , w it > 0 , ( 1 ) where f it (cid:3) (cid:40) 1 if i cites the focal patent ( type f ) , 0 otherwise , ( 2 ) and b it (cid:3)   1 if i cites any focal patent predecessors ( type b ) , 0 otherwise , ( 3 ) where n t is the number of forward citations in i , and w it indexes a matrix W of weights for patent i at time t . 4 Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 795 We emphasize that n t is the number of forward cita - tions of both the focal patent and / or its technological predecessors and therefore this quantity diﬀers from a traditional measure of patent impact . The multipli - cation by − 2 in the numerator of Equation ( 1 ) ensures that the measure ranges from − 1 to 1 , with positive val - ues representing inventions that are more destabilizing and negative values highlighting inventions that are more consolidating . Figure 1 gives examples of how to calculate the CD t index for three diﬀerent patents . The CD t index captures the direction of an inven - tion’s eﬀects on existing technologies , not the mag - nitude ; therefore the measure does not discriminate among inventions that inﬂuence a large stream of sub - sequent work and those that shape the attention of a smaller number of later inventors . By introducing a weighting parameter to Equation ( 1 ) , the magnitude of a focal invention’s future use can be incorporated . Formally , mCD t (cid:3) m t n t n (cid:88) i (cid:3) 1 − 2 f it b it + f it w it , w it > 0 , ( 4 ) where m t is a parameter that captures the magnitude of use of f at time t . In this formulation , m t diﬀers from n t in that the former counts only citations of the focal patent , whereas the latter includes citations of both the focal patent and its predecessors . This measure diﬀers from the CD t index by distinguishing among inven - tions according to their overall eﬀect on a network of interlinked technologies . The CD t index captures the direction of an invention’s eﬀects , whereas the mCD t index mixes both direction and magnitude . In cases where neither the focal patent nor its techno - logical predecessors receive any citations from future patents during the measurement interval , the value of n t is 0 and the indexes are undeﬁned . When cal - culated ﬁve years after the focal patent’s issue date , undeﬁned values of the CD t and mCD t indexes were rare , occurring in only 82 , 572 cases of 2 . 9 million , a rate of 2 . 8 % . Empirical analyses in later sections exam - ine the implications of these undeﬁned values more closely . 5 3 . Assessments of Face Validity 3 . 1 . Descriptive Statistics and Correlations Using data on the 2 . 9 million U . S . utility patents granted between 1977 and 2005 , we examine the abil - ity of our indexes to discriminate among inventions along dimensions that are known from previous work to have associations with the destabilizing or con - solidating nature of new technologies . Our analyses exclude 34 , 889 patents that were outside the scope of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s ( NBER’s ) technology categorization system and 177 patents with substantial missing data . The basic covariates were obtained from the Patent Network Dataverse ( Li et al . 2014 ) and supplemented with data taken from the USPTO . For simplicity , we set the weighting parameter w it in Equations ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) to 1 so that each future patent i that eventually cites the focal patent and / or its pre - decessors contributes equally . Most of our analyses in this and later sections evaluate impact and the CD t and mCD t indexes using forward citations made dur - ing the ﬁrst ﬁve years after the focal patent’s issue , because annual citations of most patents reach their peak within this time frame ( Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg 2002 ) . We denote these quantities as I 5 , CD 5 , and mCD 5 , respectively . In a small number of cases , we use all cita - tions made through the year 2010 , regardless of the focal patent’s issue date . For clarity , we label these val - ues I 2010 y , CD 2010 y , and mCD 2010 y to indicate the diﬀer - ent approach to calculation . Table 1 reports descriptive statistics and correlations . Values of the CD 5 index roughly approximate a nor - mal distribution with a mode of 0 , mean of 0 . 07 , stan - dard deviation of 0 . 23 , and a range from − 1 to 1 . The distribution leans slightly to the right , which suggests that modestly destabilizing inventions may be more common than slightly consolidating ones . This runs counter to prior research , which shows that destabiliz - ing technologies are rare . However , existing literature does not account for the possibility that destabilization is a matter of degree . Given that patents are somewhat costly to obtain and applicants are required to demon - strate how their invention is nonobvious , useful , and novel , this distributional skew may be expected . More - over , when interpreting the distribution , it is useful to observe that the measure is only modestly correlated with impact ( r (cid:3) 0 . 03 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The distribution of the mCD 5 index is similar to the CD 5 index , with a mode of 0 , mean of 0 . 31 , standard deviation of 1 . 75 , and a range from − 127 . 84 to 222 . 67 , but the tails are longer . Other estimates in Table 1 also add support that our indexes function as intended . First , consider the cor - relations between assignee type and the CD 5 index . The ( small ) negative correlation between the CD 5 index and ﬁrm assignee ( r (cid:3) − 0 . 00 , p < 0 . 01 ) sug - gests that ﬁrms tend to produce more consolidating inventions , whereas universities ( r (cid:3) 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 ) and government laboratories ( r (cid:3) 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 ) generate more destabilizing ones . These correla - tions are consistent with previous observations about the diﬀerences between these types of organiza - tions . Companies tend to specialize in shorter - term , application - oriented development whereas public sec - tor organizations more often focus on longer - term , fundamental research ( Dasgupta and David 1994 , Rosenberg and Nelson 1994 ) . Consistent with these observations , the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes are also pos - itively correlated with acknowledgement of a “gov - ernment interest” ( r (cid:3) 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 , and r (cid:3) 0 . 01 , Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 796 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS Table 1 .

Finally , the small positive correlation between the num - ber of inventors and the CD 5 ( r (cid:3) 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 ) and mCD 5 ( r (cid:3) 0 . 03 , p < 0 . 001 ) indexes implies that larger teams may produce more destabilizing technologies , a potentially noteworthy addition to research on scientiﬁc collaboration ( Wuchty et al . 2007 , Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . Figure 2 shows the within - year variability of the CD 5 index by NBER category . Consistent with cri - tiques about the exploding volume of patenting and perceived lowering of quality thresholds required for obtaining a successful grant ( Jaﬀe and Lerner 2004 ) , the ﬁgure suggests that , across technology categories , the average patent of today is less destabilizing than those of the late 1970s and early 1980s . We also ﬁnd signiﬁcant ( all p < 0 . 001 ) negative correlations across categories between application and grant year and the CD 5 index . However , Figure 2 also shows more outliers on the positive end of the CD 5 index in later years . 7 3 . 2 .

The measure also identiﬁes technologies that are known to have destabilized the use of their pre - decessors . Patents 4 , 237 , 224 , 4 , 399 , 216 , and 4 , 683 , 202 ( the Cohen – Boyer patent on recombinant DNA , the Axel patent on eukaryotic cotransformation , and the Mullis patent on polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , respectively ) are at the bottom of Table 2 . 8 These three inventions from the late 1970s and early 1980s set the stage for the molecular biology revolution in pharma - ceutical R & D by making techniques for targeted in vitro drug discovery possible ( Powell and Owen - Smith 1998 ) . That technological shift altered the international pharmaceutical industry in the 1980s and 1990s by challenging traditional organic - chemistry - based drug discovery methods ( Henderson and Cockburn 1996 , Powell et al . 1996 ) . These patents were also lucrative for their assignees . The Cohen – Boyer patent generated some $ 255 million in licensing royalties for Stanford University over its lifetime ( Hughes 2001 ) . A more aggressive licensing policy at Columbia University led the Axel patent to yield some $ 790 million in revenues ( Colaianni and Cook - Deegan 2009 ) . Finally , some esti - mates place the total royalties for the Mullis patent at $ 2 billion ( Fore et al . 2006 ) . Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 799 The scanning tunneling microscope ( STM , patent 4 , 343 , 993 ) and the atomic force microscope ( AFM , patent 4 , 724 , 318 ) together enabled the development of nanotechnology . Both instruments image and move individual atoms on material surfaces , which allows electronics , medications , and other products to be designed and built atom by atom . Although both inventions are destabilizing on our measure ( i . e . , they have positive scores ) , the AFM is less so than the STM . This relative ranking accords with nanotechnol - ogy’s evolution . Although the STM was introduced ﬁve years before the AFM , the AFM oﬀered several major improvements , including three - dimensional render - ings and the ability to image living organisms ( Youtie et al . 2008 ) . The AFM was a radical improvement over prior microscopes , but it was less destabilizing because it built on ( and cited ) the more transformative STM . Finally , consider patent 5 , 016 , 107 , for an “Electronic Still Camera Utilizing Image Compression and Digi - tal Storage . ” This is an Eastman Kodak patent for an early digital camera that employed novel techniques for image processing , compression , and recording on a removable storage medium ( Lucas and Goh 2009 ) . Relative to the perceived destabilization of digital pho - tography for silver halide imaging , this patent ranks low on the CD 5 index with a score of 0 . 06 . One expla - nation is that , unlike the technologies discussed above , a single patent did not cover the advent of digital pho - tography ( Christensen 1997 ) . 9 The examples described above cover well - known breakthroughs from multiple industries and technol - ogy classes . They demonstrate that our approach dis - tinguishes between destabilizing and consolidating inventions , as well as among degrees within each cat - egory . We now turn to a more detailed consideration of three inventions—glyphosate - resistant soybeans , a method of ranking of online search results , and a eukaryotic cotransformation technique—that occupy diﬀerent locations on the consolidating – destabilizing spectrum . Consider Monsanto’s patent 6 , 958 , 436 , titled “Soy - bean Variety SE90346 . ” This invention illustrates the core premise of a consolidating invention . The patent describes a genetically engineered soybean that is resis - tant to glyphosate , an herbicide patented by Monsanto in the 1970s . Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup product line , the best - selling her - bicide worldwide . In addition to glyphosate tolerance , the seed integrates other desirable plant traits , includ - ing improved yield , immunity to various diseases , and resistance to shattering , by using genetic sequences owned by Monsanto . Genetically engineered seeds increase the value of the earlier patented chemical and biological technologies by broadening potential appli - cation areas and excluding competitors ( Graﬀ et al . 2003 , Pollack 2009 ) . In this particular case , Monsanto has developed a plant variety engineered to resist dam - age from its market - leading herbicide . The top panel in Figure 3 plots citations between the Monsanto soybean patent , its predecessors , and subsequent inventions . The line graph below the ﬁg - ure tracks the patent’s annually updated CD 5 index . In the network diagram , as in the measure , forward citations are divided into three types . Triangles are patents that cite the focal patent’s predecessors but not the focal patent . Circles represent patents that cite only the focal invention and not its predecessors . Squares indicate patents that cite both the focal patent and its predecessors . The ﬁgure shows interesting features of this con - solidating invention . Note that , although the soybean patent has received 150 total citations ( as of 2010 ) , it has never been cited independently of the technolo - gies on which it builds . The patent’s introduction also virtually eliminated independent citations of its prede - cessors ( i . e . , triangles ) . The line graph that tracks the patent’s CD 5 index starts at 0 but rapidly approaches − 1 . This pattern implies that the focal patent and its predecessors are complementary in a way that would not be expected if this invention had , for instance , opened a new method of plant engineering . Although not revealed in the ﬁgure , two additional features of the Monsanto soybean patent are sugges - tive . First , consider raw citation counts . In the ﬁve years before the focal patent was granted , the ﬁve techno - logical predecessors received a total of 61 citations , or 2 . 44 citations per patent per year on average . In the ﬁve years following the soybean patent grant , citations of the predecessors increased by more than 600 % , to an average of 15 . 28 per patent per year . 10 The second suggestive feature is the antecedent technology’s ownership . By the time of application , Monsanto had acquired the ﬁrms that owned all but one of the predecessors cited by the focal patent . 11 This observation ﬁts with theories of technological innovation that argue that incumbent ﬁrms strive to enhance the value of their knowledge bases ( Sosa 2011 ) . It also suggests interesting possibilities for using this approach to examine corporate decisions about when to litigate competitor’s intellectual property . We would predict that the most likely patents to be chal - lenged in established industries are those that consol - idate the technological position of a signiﬁcant com - petitor . A similar logic might be used in explanations of merger and acquisition activities in technologically intensive ﬁelds , where complementary patent portfo - lios loom large . Next , we examine patent 6 , 285 , 999 , titled “Method for Node Ranking in a Linked Database . ” This inven - tion , referred to as PageRank , covers the core algorithm used by Google to measure the importance of web Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 800 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS Figure 3 .

Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 801 pages . Before PageRank , search engines used largely ineﬀective strategies to rank search results ( Brin and Page 1998 ) . PageRank , which is owned by Stanford Uni - versity but licensed exclusively to Google , proposed a new method that drew on insights from social net - work theory to rank web pages by the number of links they receive from other sites . PageRank’s destabiliz - ing eﬀects are evident in Yahoo ! ’s June 2000 agreement to make Google its default search engine . Prior to the implementation of Google’s search technology , Yahoo ! was the market - leading search engine . After the intro - duction of this invention , Yahoo ! could only maintain its position by adopting its competitor’s technology . The middle panel of Figure 3 presents the network of citations involving the PageRank patent , its prede - cessors , and subsequent patents . The ﬁgure is instruc - tive when compared to the Monsanto soybean patent above it . Unlike the soybean patent , which quickly garnered a substantial number of citations , PageRank appears to have been overlooked in years immediately following its 2001 publication . 12 Most citations between 2002 and 2007 cite PageRank’s technological predeces - sors , but not the patent itself . This changes between 2007 and 2010 , when more subsequent inventions cite PageRank without its predecessors . During this period , PageRank increasingly destabilizes its predecessors’ use . This pattern of change is also visible in the CD 5 index trend line , which begins near 0 and rises to 0 . 37 . For our ﬁnal case , we turn to the Axel patent on eukaryotic cotransformation , in the bottom panel of Figure 3 . This destabilizing discovery is one of the foundational inventions of biotechnology . The patent covers a method for inserting foreign genes into cells that then produce associated proteins . Along with the bacteriological method of recombinant DNA invented by Cohen and Boyer , cotransformation is a fundamental tool in biologically based drug devel - opment . In contrast to both Monsanto’s soybean and Google’s PageRank , citations of the predecessors cited by Columbia’s Axel patent eﬀectively cease within two years of its publication . Of nearly 340 citations of the Axel patent , only one subsequent invention cites it together with its predecessors and only 14 cited the predecessors on their own . 13 Indeed , the trend line below this panel suggests that a swift change in the CD 5 index happened three years after issue and was followed by a smooth rise to a maximum value of 0 . 95 . The juxtaposition of the cotransformation and soy - bean patents is interesting when viewed in light of research on technology paradigms and industry life cycles . If the Axel invention and similar technologies laid the foundations for molecular biology in the late 1970s and early 1980s , then subsequent breakthroughs that follow much later but operate within the same paradigm should be more consolidating , as is the case with the Monsanto patent . Tracing changes in the CD t index of inventions that belong to particular lineages over time might oﬀer new means to evaluate indus - try evolution and the process by which knowledge paradigms and technology standards coalesce , expand , and are swept away . 3 . 3 . Regression Analyses Our analyses so far have looked at the face validity and discriminatory power of the CD t and mCD t indexes rel - ative to patent impact . We found that ( 1 ) the CD t index is essentially uncorrelated with impact , and ( 2 ) the technologies our approach identiﬁes as consolidating or destabilizing are sensible and echo published eval - uations of high - proﬁle technologies . In this section , we begin to explore the value of the CD t and mCD t indexes for substantive research . We do this by considering the CD t and mCD t indexes along - side impact in sets of regressions that explore argu - ments from current literature about the determinants of important new technologies . We begin by presenting models at the patent level and then consider adapta - tions of the CD t and mCD t indexes at the organization level in analyses of university patenting . 3 . 3 . 1 . Patent - Level Analyses . Sample . Our data consisted of the 2 . 9 million U . S . utility patents that ( 1 ) were granted after 1976 but before 2006 , ( 2 ) were available in full - text form from the USPTO ( this criterion eliminated a small number of patents , most of which had been withdrawn from issue ) , and ( 3 ) were assigned to one of the six NBER technology categories . For each patent , we collected covariates at the patent , assignee , team , and examiner levels . Patent Importance . We measured our three indicators of patent importance—the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes and impact ( I 5 ) —using citations received during the ﬁrst ﬁve years after being granted . As noted previously , the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes are undeﬁned when neither a focal patent nor its predecessors receive any citations . To better understand the behavior of the indexes , we therefore also considered models where we replaced these undeﬁned values with 0 . Patent Covariates . One alternative interpretation of our indexes is that , rather than capturing diﬀerences in the eﬀects of new technologies , they record varia - tion in opportunity . As a focal patent cites more pre - decessors , it also makes it easier for future patents to cite those predecessors , which in turn may cause the focal patent to appear less destabilizing . To explore this possibility , we include a variable , Predecessor patents cited , that counts the number of citations made by the focal patent to U . S . utility patents . In addition to prior inventions , U . S . patents must also disclose when they build on existing knowledge Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 802 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS that is not subject to patent protection ( Fleming and Sorenson 2004 ) . Although these works ( usually techni - cal manuals or scientiﬁc papers ) are not incorporated in our indexes , we include a count of Nonpatent pre - decessors cited ( log ) in our models , because these may inﬂuence the nature and extent of a patent’s uses . For example , inventions that cite scientiﬁc papers may be closer to the frontiers of knowledge and therefore more likely to open new technological domains . Prior research also indicates that a patent’s scope and distinctiveness are good indicators of its impor - tance ( Hall and Trajtenberg 2004 , Lanjouw and Schankerman 2004 ) . Some patents describe improve - ments within a narrow area whereas others make broader assertions . To capture these diﬀerences in scope , we followed earlier research and included in our models a count of the number of Claims made by each focal patent . We also used prior work to guide our mea - sure of distinctiveness , which attempts to capture how diﬀerent an invention is from earlier ones by determin - ing whether it proposes novel combinations . Following this logic , we assign patents a Distinctiveness value of 1 if they are classiﬁed with a previously uncombined set of USPTO subclasses and 0 otherwise ( Fleming 2001 , Funk 2014 ) . The context of discovery also inﬂuences a new technology’s importance . Although many contextual factors matter , contemporary discussions often focus on the eﬀects of sponsorship . We therefore include a dummy variable that captures whether a focal patent declares a Government interest , meaning that the research leading to the patent was supported by fed - eral grants . Grant support may indicate one of several things that could bear on the CD 5 or mCD 5 indexes . First , because federal R & D funding is competitive , grant support may simply be an indicator for high - quality research . That in itself may bear on a patent’s eventual impact but does not suggest a clear impli - cation for its destabilization . However , if the grant - funded research is higher quality and oriented to more fundamental objectives than privately funded R & D , we might expect government interest patents to be more destabilizing . Finally , to evaluate the eﬀect of changes in citation patterns over time and across diﬀerent kinds of inven - tions , we included indicator variables for the grant year and NBER category of each focal patent ( Mehta et al . 2010 ) : Computers , Drugs , Electrical , Mechanical , or Others ( with Chemical omitted ) . Assignee Covariates . Researchers have shown that assignee characteristics may also inﬂuence the impor - tance of new technologies . Universities , government laboratories , and private ﬁrms diﬀer in terms of their research missions and may generate diﬀerent kinds of inventions ( Dasgupta and David 1994 , Rosenberg and Nelson 1994 , Stephan 2012 ) . To examine poten - tial diﬀerences attributable to organizational form , we included indicators for whether each focal patent listed an assignee that was a Government entity ( including for - eign and domestic ) , Firm , or University . Some patents have multiple assignees of diﬀerent forms , in which case we assigned them a value of 1 on each of the rel - evant indicators . The USPTO does not keep systematic records on assignees’ organizational forms and , there - fore , to obtain our indicators , we relied on features of assignee names . We began by manually coding a small subsample , which we then used to train a naïve Bayes classiﬁer to label the more than 300 , 000 unique assignee names in the USPTO database . Experience may also inﬂuence technological impor - tance . For instance , as an organization develops and patentsmoreinventions , itmayacquireaunique knowl - edge of particular components that when brought together form a destabilizing new technology . By contrast , there may also be an association between experience and the production of more consolidating inventions , as organizations seek to bolster or expand a particular technological trajectory . Recall the very clear case of such a development strategy , apparent in Monsanto’s soybean patent . To capture these possibil - ities , we control for the stock of eventually successful patent applications that assignees made before apply - ing for the focal patent . When there was more than one assignee we used the median stock of patents . We also added a quadratic term in the models to account for diminishing returns to experience . Team Covariates . Invention is a social activity ( Wuchty et al . 2007 ) and the structure of the team that creates a new technology may inﬂuence that technol - ogy’s importance . Prior research indicates , for instance , that despite advances in information technology , geo - graphic proximity among inventors still matters ( Funk 2014 ) . To capture these diﬀerences , we included a measure of Median team distance ( log ) . This variable records the median geographic distance among each focal patent’s inventors , adjusted for Earth’s curvature . It takes a value of 0 for patents with a single inven - tor . We also added Median team experience ( log ) and a quadratic term , which we measured as the median number of ultimately granted patents applied for by the inventors of the focal patent . To evaluate diﬀerences in team size , we included a count of the number of Inventors listed on the focal patent in each model . USPTO Covariates . Our last set of covariates focused on the USPTO examination process . As with assignees and inventors , examiner experience may inﬂuence a technology’s importance . Lemley and Sampat ( 2012 ) reported that examiners who have prosecuted more patent applications tended to cite fewer predecessor technologies and were also less likely to issue rejections Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 803 that would require applicants to revise their claims . We therefore added Examiner experience ( log ) to our models , which we measured as the number of granted patents on which the examiner of the focal patent also served as an examiner , before the focal patent’s appli - cation date . The time and energy an examiner has to devote to review may also inﬂuence citations of prior patents . To capture these diﬀerences , we added a covariate for Examiner workload . This variable counted the number of open patent applications assigned to the examiner at the same time as the focal patent by iden - tifying granted patents with application dates before and grants dates after a focal patent that were evalu - ated by the same examiner . This measure likely under - estimates the actual workload of examiners because we do not include applications that were eventually denied . We also controlled for Grant lag , which was the number of years between the grant year and applica - tion year of the focal patent ( Mehta et al . 2010 ) . 14 Statistical Approach . We used ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regressions to model the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes because both indexes are continuous and our data are cross - sectional . Models of impact ( I 5 ) used a negative binomial speciﬁcation because the variable takes on only nonnegative integer values and likelihood ratio tests of overdispersion suggested that a Poisson process did not generate the data . After excluding patents with undeﬁned CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes we had 2 , 828 , 700 observations . In models of impact ( I 5 ) and those that set undeﬁned values of CD 5 and mCD 5 to 0 , our sam - ple size increased to 2 , 910 , 506 . Correlations among the covariates were low and the variance inﬂation factors ( VIFs ) and tolerances did not indicate multicollinearity . 3 . 3 . 2 . Patent - Level Results . Table 3 displays estimates from four negative binomial models of patent impact ( I 5 ) . Overall , the coeﬃcients are consistent in sign and signiﬁcance and are supportive of ﬁndings from ear - lier research . At the patent level , all four models show a positive association between Predecessor patents cited , Nonpatent predecessors cited ( log ) , Claims , and Distinc - tiveness , which together suggest that higher - impact patents tend to be broader in scope and novelty , while also building on existing streams of technology and sci - ence . Impact also varies across technological domains . Relative to Chemical ( the omitted NBER category ) , patents in the Computers , Drugs , Electrical , Mechanical , and Others categories receive—according to estimates in Model 4—between e 0 . 120 × 1 ≈ 1 . 13 and e 0 . 710 × 1 ≈ 2 . 03 times more citations within ﬁve years of being granted . Also noteworthy , Models 2 and 3 suggest a negative association between Government interest and impact , although that eﬀect washes away in more fully speci - ﬁed models . There are signiﬁcant associations between assignee - level characteristics and impact , such that patents awarded to a Firm or University are more highly cited , whereas those with a Government assignee are less acknowledged by future inventors . Echoing some research on team science ( Wuchty et al . 2007 ) , patents with more Inventors and greater Median team distance ( log ) receive more citations , as do those that have longer Grant lag and those that are reviewed by exam - iners with higher Examiner workload . Finally , we ﬁnd consistent evidence that experience matters for patent impact , but in diﬀerent ways across levels . Increases in Median assignee experience ( log ) and Median team experi - ence ( log ) are associated with higher impact . However , as Median examiner experience ( log ) increases , impact decreases , a ﬁnding that is consistent with work by Lemley and Sampat ( 2012 ) . OLS models of the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes are shown in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively . Although the coef - ﬁcients in each table are internally consistent with respect to their sign and signiﬁcance , the estimates and their interpretations diﬀer from our impact mod - els . Beginning with the patent level , estimates in Mod - els 5 – 8 of Table 4 and Models 11 – 14 of Table 5 reveal positive relationships between reporting a Government interest and the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes , respectively . This ﬁnding makes sense in light of the federal gov - ernment’s tendency to fund basic research that seeks to open new areas . Models in Tables 4 and 5 also suggest that the rela - tionship between technological importance and the use of existing knowledge is more complex than is apparent from models of impact . Although Predecessor patents cited and Nonpatent predecessors cited ( log ) both have a positive relationship with patent impact , the former has a negative association with the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes , whereas the latter has a positive associ - ation . These relationships are open to several interpre - tations . First , they may indicate that patents that build on more patented inventions tend to consolidate the status quo , whereas those that build on more knowl - edge that is not subject to patent protection , including scientiﬁc papers , tend to destabilize it . Second , the pos - itive association between Nonpatent predecessors cited ( log ) and our indexes may happen as ﬂurries of new scientiﬁc discoveries create opportunities for techno - logical advances that are destabilizing ( Azoulay et al . 2007 ) . Finally , the relationship may result from patents building on scientiﬁc and other knowledge that is old but has never been applied to a technological domain . Coeﬃcients on our variables for assignee type also raise the possibility that evaluating impact alone may conceal important nuances . For instance , Model 4 in Table 3 reports a positive association between assign - ment to a Firm or University and a patent’s impact . Moreover , with respective increases in citations of e 0 . 092 × 1 ≈ 1 . 10 and e 0 . 036 × 1 ≈ 1 . 04 , the magnitudes of the Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 804 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS Table 3 .

Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 807 associations are nearly identical . This result is surpris - ing in light of prior research on the diﬀerences between approaches to research and invention at ﬁrms and uni - versities ( Dasgupta and David 1994 , Rosenberg and Nelson 1994 ) . Estimates using our indexes are more consistent with these earlier arguments . The negative and signiﬁcant coeﬃcients on the Firm indicator in Model 8 of Table 4 ( for the CD 5 index ) and Model 14 of Table 5 ( for the mCD 5 index ) suggest that commer - cial entities produce patents that do more to consoli - date the status quo than other assignees . By contrast , the coeﬃcients for the University assignee indicator are positive , which suggests that academic organizations generate inventions that destabilize existing technol - ogy streams , although only the coeﬃcient on the CD 5 index is signiﬁcant . In other words , both universities and ﬁrms tend to produce higher - impact inventions than other types of organizations , but that similarity masks important diﬀerences in how the technologies enter and change existing technological trajectories . Results reported in Tables 4 and 5 also suggest that the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes may oﬀer insights into distributed teams that are not apparent from impact alone . As noted above , Table 3 reports a positive association between Median team distance ( log ) and patent impact , but this ﬁnding is somewhat hard to interpret in light of earlier research . Although some studies ﬁnd value in distributed collaboration ( Owen - Smith and Powell 2004 ) , others emphasize the chal - lenges of working across distances ( Funk 2014 ) . The positive and signiﬁcant coeﬃcients on Median team dis - tance ( log ) in Tables 4 ( for the CD 5 index ) and 5 ( for the mCD 5 index ) imply that geographically distributed teams may have a greater tendency to create inventions that consolidate the status quo . Finally , several coeﬃcients are noteworthy because they help to further establish the face validity of our indexes , although they do not contrast with the results of our impact models . Patents that bridge a previously uncombined set of USPTO subclasses , for instance , and therefore score a 1 on our measure of Distinctive - ness also challenge the status quo , as indicated by the positive and signiﬁcant coeﬃcients in Tables 4 and 5 . Moreover , consistent with the research on team struc - ture and invention , we also ﬁnd , again in Tables 4 ( for the CD 5 index ) and 5 ( for the mCD 5 index ) , a positive and signiﬁcant association with Inventors : larger teams produce more destabilizing inventions . Last , models of the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes both show positive coeﬃ - cients for Grant lag , which is consistent with the idea that examiners require more time to evaluate patents that depart from the status quo and therefore their prior experience . Robustness Checks . We also examined the robust - ness of our models to alternative speciﬁcations . First , to determine whether our focus on patents granted between 1976 and 2006 inﬂuenced our ﬁndings , we reran our models on subsamples that began several years later and ended several years earlier . Our ﬁnd - ings were similar to those presented here . Second , as noted before , the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes are unde - ﬁned when neither a focal patent nor its predecessors receive any citations after the focal patent’s issue , and therefore we had to exclude these patents from our models . To gain some insight into whether these exclu - sions inﬂuenced our results , we estimated new models where we set the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes to 0 . The results appear in Models 9 and 10 ( for the CD 5 index ) and Models 15 and 16 ( for the mCD 5 index ) . Models 10 and 16 are identical to Models 9 and 15 , with the exception of an Imputed indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 for the newly added patents . Once again , the results are nearly identical to our preferred models . 3 . 3 . 3 . Organization - Level Analyses . The preceding analyses examined the relationships between impact and the CD t and mCD t indexes and factors that are known to have associations with the importance of individual patents . In this section , we move to a higher level of analysis to evaluate the ability of the CD t and mCD t indexes to oﬀer insight into patenting by organizations . Aggregate adaptations of the CD t and mCD t indexes may be useful in research considering the sources and consequences of technological change for organizations and industries . Our analyses focus on U . S . utility patents issued to the 110 most research - intensive American universities . The data set covers a broad set of high - and low - impact inventions and therefore serves as a useful setting in which to examine the value of our approach for ana - lyzing portfolios of patents . Research on the organi - zational sources of important academic patents has yielded mixed results . We believe that the ambigu - ity in this line of work may stem from its reliance on impact measures of technological importance . Below , we demonstrate that , when analyzing portfolio - level variation , the CD 5 and mCD 5 indexes oﬀer insights into the dynamics of academic patenting that are less apparent in examinations of patent impact . We consider four variations of the CD t and mCD t indexes that we have adapted for use with patent portfolios . We chose these four adaptations for their diversity and conceptual appeal , not because they exhausted the list of possible approaches . The ﬁrst measure , CD mean 5 , is the average CD 5 index among patents applied for by each university during year t + 1 . This is a simple approach to evaluating the consoli - dation or destabilization of multiple patents . Our sec - ond measure , mCD scale 5 , is a more complex adaptation of the mCD 5 index that attempts to capture the overall direction and magnitude of the eﬀects of each univer - sity’s patent portfolio on existing technology streams . We compute the mCD scale 5 measure as the product of the Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 808 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS CD mean 5 and the total impact ( I total 5 ) of patents applied for during year t + 1 . The third and fourth adaptations , CD total − 5 and CD total + 5 , are complementary measures that attempt to separately capture the eﬀects of universities’ consolidating and destabilizing patents by counting citations of patents with positive and negative values on the CD 5 index , respectively . Both the CD total − 5 and CD total + 5 indexes are computed based on patents applied for during year t + 1 . In what follows we brieﬂy survey literature that seeks to explain the scale and impact of academic patenting . We then present our models of organiza - tion - level patent importance . Although the ﬁndings suggest interesting new directions for research on aca - demic patenting and the economic value of university R & D , we pay particular attention to the comparison of eﬀects across dependent variables in order to high - light multiple possibilities for analyses using aggre - gated versions of the CD t and mCD t indexes . 3 . 3 . 4 . Research on Academic Patenting . In 1980 , Congress passed the Bayh – Dole Act , a law that allows organizations that perform federally funded research to ﬁle for patents and issue licenses on intellectual property they develop . The act accelerated a trend toward research commercialization on campus . Over the last 30 years , academic patenting has increased dra - matically . Some inventions have been highly lucrative for the institutions that own them by generating new products , companies , and even industries . Proponents of Bayh – Dole call it “prescient” ( Cole 1993 ) and herald the act’s importance in turning uni - versity science into an engine of economic devel - opment ( Powell et al . 2007 ) . In 2002 , The Economist ( 2002 , p . 3 ) called the act “possibly the most inspired piece of legislation enacted in America over the past half century” and went on to attribute to it an impor - tant role in “reversing America’s precipitous slide into industrial irrelevance . ” By the same token , crit - ics of Bayh – Dole and commercialization bemoan the “selling” of the university ( Greenberg 2007 ) , link the act to the “corporate corruption” of academia ( Washburn 2005 ) , and argue that proprietary research diminishes universities’ scientiﬁc and public mission ( Krimsky 2004 ) . Hyperbole aside , both the economic beneﬁts and the dangers of academic commercialization are often attributed to the type of inventions that universities produce . For those with rosier views , it is the uni - versity’s capability to generate unexpected , market - creating inventions outside the channels of corporate R & D that make academic inventions valuable . In the terms we use here , the economic beneﬁts of Bayh – Dole rely in part on academic scientists’ propensity to generate destabilizing inventions . Although critics approach Bayh – Dole from a range of philosophical starting points , one thread running through most neg - ative appraisals is concern that attention to the com - mercial value of academic ideas leads to capture by corporate interests , and with it to university science closely wedded to industry priorities . Put diﬀerently , one signiﬁcant concern about Bayh – Dole suggests that , as research commercialization becomes more widespread , both published and patented science will tend to consolidate the status quo . This tension has led many academic analysts to assess the costs and beneﬁts of university research commercialization ( Trajtenberg et al . 1997 , Henderson et al . 1998 , Mowery et al . 2002 ) . Two key themes in this line of work emphasize the value of academic inven - tions and the relationship between increases in the use of proprietary science and the vitality of more funda - mental research and training . Researchers pursuing the former question express concern over the relationship between the sources and types of R & D funding that support academic research and the impact of patented science on cam - pus . Although the results of some studies conﬂict , most ﬁnd evidence that increases in the quantity of academic patenting do not decrease its impact at the campus level ( Mowery et al . 2002 ) . These studies also suggest that connections with industry help academic institutions to learn to patent up to a point . Owen - Smith and Powell ( 2003 ) ﬁnd a curvilinear ( inverted U - shaped ) relationship between ties to biotechnology ﬁrms and the impact of a university’s patent portfolio . They attribute diminishing returns to the likelihood of corporate capture of technology transfer priorities . The relationship between academic ( papers ) and proprietary ( patents ) research outputs has also been much examined . Owen - Smith ( 2003 ) demonstrates that patent ﬂows are deeply intertwined with traditionally academic inputs and outputs such as federal grants and publications . Sine et al . ( 2003 ) ﬁnd that academic visibility in the form of article citations increases the likelihood that patents will be licensed by industry . For a set of life science patents issued to 89 university cam - puses , Owen - Smith and Powell ( 2003 ) ﬁnd a positive relationship between the citation impact of life science papers and the overall impact of a university’s patent portfolio . Sample . To determine whether the CD t and mCD t in - dexes can oﬀer any new insights into debates over academic patenting , we collected data on a sample of universities that mirror those studied in previous research . We focus on the 110 most research - intensive U . S . universities ( Owen - Smith and Powell 2003 ) and the 55 , 322 utility patents awarded to these institutions between 1976 and 2010 . Our sample includes every institution that has ever ranked among the top 100 Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 809 nationally by federal obligations for science and engi - neering research . After deﬁning our sample , we cre - ated a university × year panel with annually updated variables for each institution . Portfolio Importance . We considered six measures of portfolio importance . The ﬁrst two measures , vol - ume ( V total ) and impact ( I total 5 ) , capture the number of patents applied for by ( and ultimately granted to ) each university during year t + 1 and the total number of citations received by those patents , respectively . Vari - ants of these two measures have been widely used in previous work on university patenting ( Mowery and Ziedonis 2002 , Owen - Smith and Powell 2003 ) . The last of our six measures are the four portfolio variations on the CD t and mCD t indexes discussed above : CD mean 5 , mCD scale 5 , CD total − 5 , and CD total + 5 . As in our earlier analy - ses , all measures are computed using citations received by patents in the ﬁrst ﬁve years after being granted . We frame the analyses we present here in terms of groups of right - hand side variables that operational - ize key concepts from the literature . In particular , we attend to measures related to individual university lev - els of experience with patenting , the sources of fund - ing and support for their research , and their scientiﬁc capacity . Technology Transfer Experience Covariates . Prior work reports mixed results about the eﬀects of expe - rience with patenting . On the one hand , more experi - ence in the form of increasing patenting may help a university to better identify potentially commercially valuable inventions and thus higher impact patents . On the other hand , experience may also be associated with declines in impact , because universities looking to develop strong patent portfolios pursue more incre - mental inventions ( Henderson et al . 1998 ) . We measure each university’s experience with technology transfer as the volume of Patents applied for during year t . We also include a separate measure for Life sciences that captures the proportion of recent patents applied for by each university that fall within the NBER’s Drugs category . Industry Ties Covariates . Owen - Smith and Powell’s ( 2003 ) observation that greater corporate engagement leads to the capture of university technology transfer eﬀorts suggests that science supported by industrial partners is likely to generate inventions that increase the use of existing technologies . We thus propose that industry support of university R & D will lead universi - ties to pursue more consolidating discoveries . Industry - sponsored R & D ( log ) measures the dollar value , in millions , of grants and contracts from corporations to researchers on campus . This variable comes from National Science Foundation ( NSF ) surveys of campus - level R & D eﬀorts available from the online WebCAS - PAR database . 15 Our second measure , Industry R & D ties , captures formal R & D relationships with ﬁrms in technology - intensive industries . The information on R & D connections used to create this variable was con - tent coded from Securities and Exchange Commission ﬁlings made by a sample of 634 publicly traded ﬁrms in high - technology sectors ( see Buhr and Owen - Smith 2010 , Owen - Smith et al . 2015 ) . Government Ties Covariates . Levels of support from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , and the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , the nation’s premier funders of basic science , should yield research that is less connected to existing industrial needs . Thus , more federal grants and more patents derived from them should be associ - ated with destabilizing inventions . We track the level of support ( in millions of dollars ) that ﬂows to campuses from federal science agencies with three variables , NSF grants ( log ) , NIH grants ( log ) , and DoD grants ( log ) . Federal grant measures were extracted from the NSF’s WebCASPAR database . Broadly speaking , if the process by which federal sci - ence agencies apportion R & D support is more likely to fund research focused on academic concerns divorced from the needs of industry , then campuses that per - form more federally funded research and those whose patents emerge from federally funded projects should produce more destabilizing patents . Likewise , because corporate R & D funding is presumably linked to spon - sors’ proximate , market - driven goals , we expect cam - puses that pursue more industrially funded R & D to produce patents that consolidate the use of existing technologies . Although any source of external support seems likely to yield higher - impact patents , we antici - pate that industrial connections will be associated with consolidating inventions , while public sector funding will lead to more destabilizing ones . Scientiﬁc Capacity Covariates . Although existing measures of publication impact suﬀer from many of the same limitations as the patent citation indexes we critique above , we use them to provide some sense of the relationship between high - impact public and important proprietary science . We follow two lines of reasoning . Noting ﬁrst with Sine and colleagues ( 2003 ) that articles confer a “halo eﬀect” on associated aca - demic patents while advertising their value to potential licensees , we expect both the volume and impact of academic science to be associated with higher - impact patent portfolios . To the extent that highly - cited papers generate scientiﬁc attention because they report novel , basic - science discoveries that are far removed from the current concerns of industry , we would expect higher - impact publications to be associated with more desta - bilizing inventions . We use the count of Scientiﬁc articles published in the preceding year to index the volume of academic Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 810 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS research on campus . In addition , we include a measure of the citation Impact factor of those articles as a proxy of the visibility and quality of a campus’s published research . Both measures are drawn from the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information’s ( ISI ) University Indicators Database . Statistical Approach . Four of our measures of patent importance— V total , I total 5 , CD total − 5 , and CD total + 5 —are counts that take on only nonnegative integer values . To capture time - invariant heterogeneity among uni - versities , account for overdispersion , and match the approach taken in earlier research ( Owen - Smith and Powell 2003 ) , we model I total 5 , CD total − 5 , and CD total + 5 using a conditional ﬁxed - eﬀects negative binomial speciﬁca - tion ( Hausman et al . 1984 ) . Our model of V total also uses a negative binomial speciﬁcation , but because it includes a lagged dependent variable , we use random instead of ﬁxed eﬀects . 16 Finally , to model CD mean 5 and mCD scale 5 , we use a ﬁxed - eﬀects OLS speciﬁcation . All models include indicator variables for calendar year . 3 . 3 . 5 . Organization - Level Results . Table 6 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for all variables used in these analyses . Table 7 reports results from a fully speciﬁed model for each one of our dependent variables . Nested speciﬁcations are available from the authors . Consider the ﬁrst two columns of Table 7 ( Models 17 and 18 ) , which present estimates for patent volume ( V total ) and impact ( I total 5 ) . The results of these models are broadly consistent with prior ﬁndings . Universi - ties that have greater prior experience with patent - ing ( Patents ) produce more and higher impact patents . A greater focus on Life sciences patenting , however , is associated with diminished patent impact . This may be the case because , unlike physical science and engi - neering technologies , the most sought - after life science patents are those that oﬀer exclusive protection for potential drug candidates . Such patents are typically Table 6 . Descriptive Statistics and Correlations Variable Mean SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1 . Patents / volume ( V total ) 28 . 85 27 . 76 1 . 00 2 .

Perhaps unsurprisingly , universities that produce more Scientiﬁc articles and higher - impact ( Impact factor ) research publications also develop more and higher - impact patents . Connections to corporate partners in the form of Industry - sponsored R & D ( log ) and research - based university – industry alliances ( Industry R & D ties ) suggest more interesting associations . Increased indus - trial funding is modestly associated with more and higher - impact patenting , but campuses with more cor - porate alliances patent less , and this type of corporate connection has no signiﬁcant relationship with patent impact . By the same token , increases in research funding from key public sources ( NSF grants ( log ) , NIH grants ( log ) , and DoD grants ( log ) ) demonstrate largely pos - itive relationships with patent volume and impact . The cross agency funding diﬀerences in these mod - els warrant further scrutiny , but we expect that they have much to do with the relative proportion of each funding source in a university’s portfolio of research support and the distinctive ﬁelds in which diﬀerent agencies concentrate their grant making . Model 19 regresses these same variables on the average CD 5 index ( CD mean 5 ) for a given university . Just one variable , the impact factor of published sci - entiﬁc articles , oﬀers any explanatory purchase on this dependent variable , and that eﬀect is marginal . Although the suggestion that higher - visibility scien - tiﬁc portfolios are associated with more destabiliz - ing patents is in accord with some of the patent - level ﬁndings we present in the prior session , the lack of robust relationships in Model 19 implies that an aver - age CD 5 index might not be the best aggregate mea - sure for analyzing the kinds of diverse , decentralized patent portfolios that are commonplace on university campuses .

In contrast , Model 20 oﬀers what we believe to be the clearest and most compelling example of an aggregate version of our measures . mCD scale 5 weights a standard forward citation measure of impact for a group of patents by the CD mean 5 index . Comparing these results with those in Model 18 is thus illustrative of the beneﬁts to be gained by incorporating the kinds of structural measures we propose into the analysis of portfolios of patents . Note ﬁrst that , although high volume patenting ( Patents ) and publishing ( Scientiﬁc articles ) are both associated with increases in patent impact ( Model 18 ) , the same measures are associated with higher - impact patents that consolidate the status quo of their technology streams ( Model 20 ) . Univer - sities that produce higher - impact portfolios of articles ( Impact factor ) , however , also develop higher - impact patents that do more to destabilize the status quo . Perhaps most tellingly , however , both measures of engagement with corporate partners ( Industry - sponsored R & D ( log ) and Industry R & D ties ) are strongly associated with patenting that consolidates existing technology trajectories . In contrast , increases in fund - ing from all three sources of public research support ( NSF grants ( log ) , NIH grants ( log ) , and DoD grants ( log ) ) are linked to more destabilizing patent port - folios . This analysis holds potential lessons for both defenders of and detractors from Bayh – Dole . For the former , the implications are clear : the post – Bayh – Dole wave of university inventions depends on the founda - tion of academically important , publicly funded sci - ence . Thus , to preserve their economic contributions , the academic character of university science should be encouraged . For the latter , it appears that tighter indus - trial connections yield patents that reinforce existing technical arrangements , a ﬁnding that should deepen concerns about the long - term eﬀects of commercializa - tion on universities , their research , and ultimately their economic contributions . Finally , turn your attention to Models 21 and 22 , which examine variables that take a diﬀerent approach to aggregation . Here we use the patent - level CD 5 index to diﬀerentiate between patents that destabilize or con - solidate the use of existing technologies . We then calcu - Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 812 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS late the forward citation impact for those patents . Both models oﬀer less clear signal than Model 20 , but some interesting features are apparent . Most notably , the coeﬃcients for variables that capture scientiﬁc capac - ity ( Scientiﬁc articles and Impact factor ) in these two models are consistent with the ﬁndings we reported for our mCD scale 5 index . A higher volume of scientiﬁc papers is associated with higher - impact consolidating inventions ( Model 22 , CD total − 5 ) . In contrast , a higher - impact portfolio of scientiﬁc publications is associated with a more broadly used portfolio of patents that destabilize the use of the technologies on which they build ( Model 21 , CD total + 5 ) . When considered holistically , these models suggest that there is value in pursuing more aggregate forms of our measures , but more research is needed . To our eyes , the admittedly schematic ﬁndings presented in Table 7 imply that , for organizations like universities that pursue research across many ﬁelds with multi - ple goals and partners , an integrated measure such as mCD scale 5 oﬀers signiﬁcant purchase . We suspect that the kinds of measures we created for Models 21 and 22 may be more adapted to studying the eﬀects of changes in technology management and R & D practices for organi - zations , such as smaller ﬁrms , that pursue more explic - itly destabilizing or consolidating invention goals in a more homogeneous range of ﬁelds . Regardless , the additional analytic ﬂexibility that comes with our network - based measurement approach may yield div - idends when applied to more speciﬁc examinations of technology strategy and its eﬀects . 4 . Discussion We began this article with a quote from Schumpeter . That insight served as a stepping stone for two gen - erations of research that views creative destruction as a motor for economic and social transformation . Although Schumpeter and others observe that what makes a technology important is the nature and extent of its use , quantitative evaluations of how , precisely , the use of new technologies strengthens or challenges the status quo have remained elusive . The purpose of this article has been to propose and evaluate measures— the CD t and mCD t indexes—that capture the eﬀects that new inventions have on the use of their predeces - sors . Our approach diﬀers from prior eﬀorts by oper - ationalizing the distinction between technologies that are valuable because they break from current stan - dards and those whose value derives from reinforcing the trajectories from which they spring . The CD t index has several attractive features that may make it useful for future research . By treating new technologies as additions to evolving networks , the measure makes use of theoretically important struc - tural information on second - order forms of impact that are overlooked by existing approaches . These net - work underpinnings also make the CD t index natu - rally suited to dynamic analyses over the course of a particular technology’s existence . Our method also oﬀers a continuous and valenced characterization of an invention’s impact , which allows for clear , qualita - tive distinctions while also recognizing that the con - solidating or destabilizing character of technologies is often a matter of degree . Moreover , because the value of the CD t index can vary over time for a single patent , the measure allows for the possibility that some impor - tant proportion of the eﬀect that a new invention has is determined ex post in the context of its use rather than ex ante in the context of its discovery . Finally , by incorporating an impact weight into the CD t index , it is possible to obtain an indicator ( the mCD t index ) that characterizes both technologies that are major depar - tures from the status quo and those that reinforce but oﬀer substantial improvements over existing technolo - gies . Together , these indexes capture the positive and negative dimensions of technological change . In addition to their methodological beneﬁts , the CD t and mCD t indexes may also help to facilitate theoreti - cal development in some areas by clarifying conﬂicting empirical ﬁndings . For more than three decades , schol - ars have engaged in heated debates over the impli - cations of increasing commercial engagement for the nature and quality of university science . Although patents are a potentially valuable source of data for adjudicating among competing views , empirical inves - tigations using forward - citation - based measures of impact have been inconclusive . Using the CD t and mCD t indexes , we found consistent evidence that while increases in federal support for academic research appear to push universities to create technologies that destabilize the status quo , increases in commercial ties are associated with university research that consoli - dates existing technology streams . The indexes we propose are not without limita - tions and more remains to be done . Most broadly , our approach rests on the assumption that relevant nodes ( patents ) and ties ( citations ) can be meaningfully identiﬁed , and that the network under investigation evolves in some way . Many settings in which inven - tion occurs meet these criteria . However , in certain cases ( for instance , where change is largely propelled by exogenous inﬂuences ) , the value of the approach will be limited . Our indexes are also limited because they are undeﬁned when a focal invention and its pre - decessors are never cited by subsequent technologies . In the context of U . S . patents , we found that these kind of inventions are rare , occurring in 3 % of cases when the CD t and mCD t indexes are measured ﬁve years after the focal patent’s issue year . Nevertheless , inventions of this sort may still inﬂuence technologi - cal change ( for instance , by leading inventors to believe Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS 813 a particular ﬁeld has been saturated ) and therefore diverting attention from components that were in exis - tence before its introduction . A related limitation is that , even when our indexes are deﬁned , they may be biased for inventions that oﬀer improvements over some existing technologies but use entirely new meth - ods and therefore do not build on those technologies , perhaps by using methods from a diﬀerent domain . Clarifying these eﬀects , both conceptually and with respect to measurement , is an exciting opportunity for future research . Our analyses did not explore the possibility that some inventions might simultaneously consolidate and destabilize the use of predecessors in diﬀerent technol - ogy streams . This phenomenon could occur if a par - ticular invention made its antecedents more valuable for one community of users , but less so for others . Such patterns of alternating consolidation and desta - bilization may prove useful in identifying instances where a technology fails to cite the predecessors it most strongly destabilizes . When a new technology is based on a totally diﬀerent set of mechanisms , for instance , we might not see destabilization on our measure for several patent generations . Our example of the Axel patent , which cited no examples of the chemistry - based drug discovery methods it eventu - ally supplanted , oﬀers a case in point . The same eﬀect might also be present in cases where usage patterns change over the course of a technology’s life cycle . Finally , our empirical analyses suﬀer from some lim - itations common to all research that relies on archival data like patents . For instance , many important inven - tions are never ﬁled with the USPTO , although , as critics suggest , many mediocre new technologies pass through the examination process and are awarded patent protection . Business and legal strategies may create additional noise or bias in the data through the intentional omission of legitimate citations or the inclu - sion of irrelevant references ( Alcácer et al . 2009 ) . Although not without limitations , we believe that the CD t and mCD t indexes may help to expand research in multiple areas . Below , we address some im - plications of our approach where it is likely to be most useful . 4 . 1 . Social Networks The indexes we propose may help to generate new insights in research on social networks and invention ( Burt 2004 , Obstfeld 2005 ) . A persistent challenge in this area has been to distinguish between the eﬀects of more open , unconstrained social network conﬁgu - rations and more closed or cohesive structures . Some current ﬁndings suggest that the former are more eﬀec - tive for generating novel ideas whereas the latter are more suited for mobilizing collaborators around the often diﬃcult work of development , but other research points to the importance of more complex , hybrid network arrangements ( Fleming et al . 2007 , de Vaan et al . 2015 ) . Rather than reﬂecting diﬀerences in the eﬀects of particular social network structures and the need to consider more complex conﬁgurations , how - ever , the conﬂicting ﬁndings in this area may stem from noisy outcome indexes that mask fundamental diﬀerences between network positions that facilitate destabilizing ideas and those that support inventions that are more consolidating in nature . Closed groups of inventors with many overlapping , cohesive rela - tionships , for instance , may collectively have deeper knowledge of a technological domain and therefore be especially suited for developing ideas that consol - idate a trajectory . Alternatively , inventors who search through networks of otherwise disconnected contacts may leverage their vision advantage to pursue more fundamental insights that destabilize existing techno - logical arrangements . 4 . 2 . Industries and Firms The CD t and mCD t indexes may also be useful for understanding industry evolution and its implications for ﬁrms ( Nelson and Winter 1982 ; Tushman and Anderson 1986 ; Benner 2007 ; Sosa 2009 , 2011 ) . For instance , recall our brief discussion of two related tech - nologies identiﬁed in Table 2 : the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) and the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . The STM was highly destabilizing because of its major break with the technological standards in place at the time of its introduction . By contrast , the AFM was only moderately destabilizing because it built on and expanded the technological base created by the STM . Yet the AFM has proven to be more impor - tant to the development of nanotechnology . Abstract - ing from this dynamic , one may hypothesize and use our indexes in tandem with qualitative and historical case data to examine the possibility that , in emerging sectors like nanoscale materials or tissue engineering , early inventions will be the most likely to challenge the incumbents’ capabilities , whereas later discoveries may enhance them as the technologies ( and related organizations , networks , and markets ) mature . The ability to distinguish between inventions that consolidate and those that destabilize the use of exist - ing technologies may also be valuable for examining a range of questions of relevance to technology strat - egy . For instance , consider debates over the eﬀect of market power on incentives to develop new technolo - gies . Much like research on social networks , this liter - ature has produced conﬂicting theoretical arguments and empirical ﬁndings ( Gilbert 2006 , Ahuja et al . 2008 ) . Although some contend that incumbents should pur - sue inventions in order to maintain their positions , oth - ers argue the opposite and claim that incentives are depressed due to lack of competition . Ahuja and col - leagues ( 2008 , p . 8 ) note that empirical eﬀorts to resolve Funk and Owen - Smith : A Dynamic Network Measure of Technological Change 814 Management Science , 2017 , vol . 63 , no . 3 , pp . 791 – 817 , ©2016 INFORMS this debate have been challenging , “since the main eﬀects are countervailing . ” To the extent that incum - bents may diﬀer with respect to the aims of their R & D eﬀorts in relation to existing technology streams , the measures we propose could help to disentangle some of these countervailing eﬀects . 4 . 3 . Science Policy In recent years , eﬀorts to develop evidence - based sci - ence policy measures have triggered extensive work in what has come to be called the “science of science policy” ( Lane 2010 , Fealing et al . 2011 , Powell et al . 2012 ) . Among other concerns in this burgeoning ﬁeld is the question of how to support , identify , and eval - uate transformative research . We submit that variants of the CD t and mCD t indexes might help to document the transformative eﬀects of diﬀerent collaborative or funding models by , for instance , associating diﬀering levels of interdisciplinarity or scientiﬁc team structure with the production of more or fewer ﬁndings that enhance or replace existing knowledge bases . Our ﬁnd - ings about the diﬀering implication of higher - impact university and corporate patents for established tech - nological arrangements and the tendency of federally funded grants to generate more destabilizing inven - tions oﬀer cases in point . Funders and performers of such research are under increasing political pressure to explain and justify their work in terms of its eco - nomic impact . However , ﬁndings like those we explore here suggest the importance of more fundamental , aca - demic research as a means to open new technological trajectories . As such , the CD t and mCD t indexes may oﬀer a more eﬀective means to evaluate the technologi - cal signiﬁcance of scientiﬁc discoveries in a fashion that justiﬁes novel funding approaches at the federal and state levels . The ﬁndings we present in regard to the disparate eﬀects that industrial and public R & D ﬁnd - ings may have for diﬀerent types of academic patent - ing , and the suggestion that support from diﬀerent agencies is associated with diﬀerent types of research outcomes , oﬀer cases in point . 4 . 4 . Geography and Space The method we propose could also be of use in ongo - ing work on the causes and consequences of regional industrial agglomeration . Competition is stiﬀer within established clusters than outside them ( Stuart and Sorenson 2003 , Whittington et al . 2009 ) . Work has doc - umented the diﬀerent roles that physical proximity to universities and other ﬁrms and geographically local versus distant ties play in the inventive performance of biotechnology companies ( Owen - Smith and Powell 2004 , Whittington et al . 2009 ) . Both lines of work have suggested that location in vibrant regions forces ﬁrms to compete more vigorously to succeed , but research in this area has not attempted to distinguish among the types of inventions made by geographically clus - tered and geographically remote organizations . Adapt - ing insights on social isolation and creativity ( Taylor and Greve 2006 , Singh and Fleming 2010 ) , one may pre - dict that ﬁrms located in “second - tier” regions ( Mayer 2011 ) or outside established clusters entirely are bet - ter positioned to generate inventions that destabilize existing streams of technology , whereas those in closer proximity to industry peers are well suited to work that consolidates and reinforces them . The ability to char - acterize regions along these dimensions may be valu - able for managers and urban planners , in addition to researchers ( Bettencourt et al . 2007 ) . At a more microlevel , our ﬁnding of a greater ten - dency for distributed teams of inventors to create inventions that consolidate the status quo suggests that geographic diversity may help collaborators to per - form better in some respects while also challenging their ability to create truly destabilizing new technolo - gies . Existing studies of team - based research suggest that this could be the case , but pure impact mea - sures lack the ability to distinguish among such claims . If , as some research on scientiﬁc and technical teams suggests , distance increases coordination challenges ( Cummings and Kiesler 2005 ) , then it may be that dispersed teams are more eﬀective in pursuing addi - tions to existing technological trajectories . In contrast , if serendipity is an important contributing factor for destabilizing discoveries and face - to - face interactions are a key mechanism for its recognition , then dispersed teams may be at a substantial disadvantage when it comes to making more destabilizing inventions ( Kabo et al . 2014 ) . 4 . 5 . Beyond Technological Change Finally , consider some possible uses of our dynamic network approach far aﬁeld from technological change . The CD t and mCD t indexes might be adapted to studies of the evolving link structure of the World Wide Web , where new pages will cite and be cited by others . Similarly the evolving structure of citations among judicial decisions that comprise an important aspect of U . S . law might be examined in these terms . Rather than measuring the eﬀects of new technologies , this family of indexes might oﬀer new insight into more political and cultural questions involving the dynamics of political polarization in the blogosphere , the evo - lution of management fads and fashions , the visibil - ity of music artists and genres , the commercial and critical impact of ﬁlms , and the larger legal implica - tions of new court decisions . Evolving network data on relationships of deference among entrants and incum - bents in diﬀerent substantive domains are becoming more available and are potentially valuable for research questions in multiple ﬁelds .

Bhaven Sampat generously provided data on USPTO examiners . All errors are the authors’ own . Endnotes 1 Nevertheless , patent data have limitations . For example , inventors may not seek patent protection for their ideas . Moreover , the patent examination process has been criticized by observers who argue that the USPTO grants many patents that fail to meet the legal require - ments of novelty and nonobviousness ( Jaﬀe and Lerner 2004 , Lemley and Sampat 2008 ) . Firms may have strategic reasons for omitting citations , and examiners may fail to add these during their reviews ( Alcácer et al . 2009 ) . 2 Although we do not include them in these diagrams , we also recog - nize and integrate into our measure the likelihood that later inven - tions will cite the focal patent’s predecessors without citing the focal patent itself . 3 Code for calculating the CD t and mCD t indexes along with values for U . S . patents are available at http : / / www . cdindex . info . 4 More nuanced approaches could , for example , determine the val - ues of W according to the issue date of i such that older citations have greater or lesser inﬂuence over the measure , or by diﬀerentially weighting citations made by examiners and patent applicants . 5 Our focus on types of nodes and binary relations among them dis - cards some structural data . We address these issues more in Online Appendix A , where we introduce variations on the CD t and mCD t indexes that allow for multiple focal patents . 6 We identiﬁed government interest patents by extracting and coding information contained in the GOVT , GOVINT , and related ﬁelds of full - text patent documents , available from the USPTO . 7 In unreported comparisons , we found few substantial diﬀerences in the distribution of the CD 5 index across broad ( NBER ) technology categories . Computerspatents ( includingsoftware ) , however , appear to have less inﬂuence in terms of either consolidating or destabilizing the status quo than other classes have . 8 By convention , we refer to these patents using the last names of their authors . The inventors’ full names are , respectively , Stanley N . Cohen and Herbert W . Boyer , Richard Axel ( with Michael H . Wigler and Saul J . Silverstein ) , and Kary B . Mullis . Each of these patents covers what was to become a fundamental method for research in many ﬁelds of biology and the biotechnology industry . Cohen and Boyer established the fundamental technique of gene splicing . Axel and colleagues developed a method to insert genes into cells in order to turn them into protein “factories . ” Mullis invented an eﬃ - cient method to produce large amounts of DNA from very small samples . 9 The alternative version of the CD t index presented in Online Appendix A may prove useful for estimating the eﬀects that patent families have on their technological predecessors . 10 This calculation does not account for possible right truncation due to delays between patent application and grant years and may also be inﬂated because of increases in the frequency of patenting and citation over time . In Online Appendix B , we present exploratory models that attempt to adjust for these and other factors . The results are similar . 11 Patent 5 , 084 , 082 is owned by DuPont . 12 The PageRank patent also diﬀers from Monsanto in that its back - ward citations come from a more diverse base of organizations , as would be anticipated for a more destabilizing invention . The seven predecessors cited by the patent are owned by a total of four diﬀer - ent corporations and one university , none of which are Stanford or Google . 13 One important question is whether or not the Axel patent’s high CD 5 index of 0 . 95 could stem from the fact that it only cited two pieces of predecessor patents . There is a modest negative correlation ( r (cid:3) − 0 . 17 , p < 0 . 001 ) between the number of citations of predecessors and a patent’s CD 5 index . However , some association between the number of predecessors cited and the CD 5 index is anticipated as novel inventions should have fewer predecessors available on which to build . 14 We thank Bhaven Sampat for sharing the data on USPTO examin - ers that made these analyses possible . 15 http : / / ncsesdata . nsf . gov / webcaspar / . 16 The results are similar if we drop the lagged term ( Patents ) and estimate the model using conditional ﬁxed eﬀects .
