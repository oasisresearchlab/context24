Why make a book available electronically but not on an actual reading device ? As it is , I do too much reading on a lit screen for my graduate school career , and the reason I have a Kindle is so that I can take my lightweight portable device anywhere and highlight , look up terms , bookmark etc . without staring at a lighted screen or having to sit in front of my computer to read . It ' s a good book , recommended by my advisor , but why on earth not make it available on the reading device created ? Especially when it was rentable on said device . This is a great book if you ' re in a research methods class or starting your research proposal . It has some very practical information on grant writing and sources of research grants too . Highly recommend . As a text required for a doctoral class in writing proposals for our dissertations , this text did outline the process and looked at what we need to do to continue our work towards completing this process . Very readable , with the ring of truth . If my proposal actually * does * work , I ' ll be back to add a couple of stars to this review - Need for school . Came in plenty of time !
