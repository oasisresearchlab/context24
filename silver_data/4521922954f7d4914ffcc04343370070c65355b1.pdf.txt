This domain organization is critical for the proper utilization and propagation of the genetic information encoded by the chromosome . A special set of archi - tectural elements , called boundaries or insulators , are responsible both for subdividing the chromatin into discrete domains and for determining the topological organization of these domains . Central to the architectural functions of insulators are homologous and heterolo - gous insulator : insulator pairing interactions . The former ( pairing between copies of the same insulator ) dictates the process of homolog alignment and pairing in trans , while the lat - ter ( pairing between different insulators ) defines the topology of looped domains in cis . To elucidate the principles governing these architectural functions , we use two insulators , Homie and Nhomie , that flank the Drosophila even skipped locus . We show that homolo - gous insulator interactions in trans , between Homie on one homolog and Homie on the other , or between Nhomie on one homolog and Nhomie on the other , mediate transvection . Critically , these homologous insulator : insulator interactions are orientation - dependent . Consistent with a role in the alignment and pairing of homologs , self - pairing in trans is head - to - head . Head - to - head self - interactions in cis have been reported for other fly insulators , suggesting that this is a general principle of self - pairing . Homie and Nhomie not only pair with themselves , but with each other . Heterologous Homie - Nhomie interactions occur in cis , and we show that they serve to delimit a looped chromosomal domain that contains the even skipped transcription unit and its associated enhancers . The topology of this loop is defined by the heterologous pairing properties of Homie and Nhomie . Instead of being head - to - head , which would generate a circular loop , Homie - Nhomie pairing is head - to - tail . Head - to - tail pairing in cis generates a stem - loop , a configuration much like that observed in classical lampbrush chromosomes . These pairing principles provide a mechanistic under - pinning for the observed topologies within and between chromosomes .

Author Summary The chromosomes of multicellular animals are organized into a series of topologically independent looped domains . This domain organization is critical for the proper utiliza - tion and propagation of the genetic information encoded by the chromosome . A special set of architectural elements , called boundaries or insulators , are responsible for both sub - dividing the chromatin fiber into discrete domains , and determining the topological orga - nization of these domains . Central to the architectural functions of insulators are heterologous and homologous insulator : insulator pairing interactions . In Drosophila , the former defines the topology of individual looped domains in cis , while the latter dictates the process of homolog alignment and pairing in trans . Here we use two insulators from the even skipped locus to elucidate the principles governing these two architectural func - tions . These principles align with several longstanding observations , and resolve a number of conundrums regarding chromosome topology and function . Introduction The highly regular and reproducible physical organization of chromosomes in multicellular eukaryotes was recognized a century ago in cytological studies on the lampbrush chromosomes that are found in oocytes arrested at the diplotene phase of meiosis I [ 1 – 3 ] . At this stage , homologous chromosomes are paired . The two homologs display a similar and reproducible architecture . It consists of a series of loops emanating from the main axis , that are arranged in pairs , one from each homolog . In between the loops are regions of more compacted chromatin [ 2 ] . A similar physical organization is evident in insect polytene chromosomes [ 4 ] . As with lampbrush chromosomes , the paired homologs are aligned in precise register . However , instead of one copy of each homolog , there are hundreds . While loops are not readily visible , each polytene segment has a unique pattern of bands and interbands that depends upon the underlying DNA sequence and chromosome structure . Subsequent studies have shown that the key features of chromosome architecture evident in lampbrush and polytene chromosomes are also found in diploid somatic cells [ 5 – 13 ] . One of these is the subdivision of the chromatin fiber into a series of loop domains . There are now many lines of evidence indicating that looping is a characteristic architectural feature . Bio - chemical evidence comes from chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) experiments , which show that distant sites come into contact with each other in a consistent pattern of topologi - cally associating domains ( TADs ) . While the first studies in mammals suggested that TADs have an average length of 1 Mb [ 14 – 16 ] , subsequent experiments showed that the average is only about 180 kb [ 17 ] . In flies , TADs are smaller , between 10 – 100 kb [ 18 , 19 ] . Neighboring TADs are separated from each other by boundaries that constrain both physical and regulatory interactions . In mammals and also in flies , these boundaries typically correspond to sequences bound by insulator proteins like CTCF [ 17 ] . That TAD boundaries correspond to insulators is consistent with the known properties of these elements . Insulators subdivide the chromosome into functionally autonomous regulatory domains . When interposed between enhancers or silencers and target promoters , insulators block regulatory interactions . They also have an architectural function in that they can bring distant chromosomal sequences together , and in the proper configuration can promote rather than restrict regulatory interactions [ 20 , 21 ] . Moreover , insulators are known to mediate con - tacts between distant sequences ( loop formation ) , and these physical contacts depend upon specific interactions between proteins bound to the insulators [ 22 , 23 ] . Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 2 / 25 The notion that insulators are responsible for subdividing eukaryotic chromosomes into a series of looped domains raises questions about the rules governing loop formation in cis . One of these is the basis for partner choice . Is choice based simply on proximity , or is there an intrinsic partner preference ? A second concerns the topology of the loop formed by interacting partners in cis . Do the partners interact to form a stem - loop - like structure , or does the interac - tion generate a circular loop ( “ circle - loop ” ) ? The answer to this question will depend upon whether there is an orientation dependence to the interactions between two heterologous insu - lators . In flies , homologs are typically paired in somatic cells , not just in cells that are polyploid [ 24 ] . This means that the loop domains in each homolog must be aligned in precise register along their entire length . A plausible hypothesis is that both alignment and homolog pairing are mediated by insulator interactions in trans . If this is case , there are similar questions about the rules that govern trans interactions . Is there a partner preference in the interactions that mediate homolog pairing ? Is there an orientation dependence , and if so , what is the topological outcome of the looped domains generated by insulator interactions in paired chromosomes in cis and in trans ? In the studies reported here , we have used insulators from the even skipped ( eve ) locus to address the questions posed above about the architecture of eukaryotic chromosomes . The eve domain spans 16 kb and is bordered upstream by the Nhomie ( Neighbor of Homie , this study ) insulator and downstream by Homie ( Homing insulator at eve ) [ 25 , 26 ] . eve encodes a homeo - domain transcription factor that is required initially for segmentation , and subsequently in the development of the CNS , muscles , and anal plate [ 27 , 28 ] . It has a complex set of enhancers that activate expression at different stages and tissues [ 25 , 29 – 31 ] , and a Polycomb response ele - ment ( PRE ) that silences the gene in cells where it isn ’ t needed [ 32 ] . In early embryos , the stripe enhancers upstream ( 3 + 7 , 2 , late stripes ) and downstream ( 4 + 6 , 1 , and 5 ) of the eve gene acti - vate transcription in a pair - rule pattern . Later in development , around the time that germband retraction commences , mesodermal ( Me ) and neuronal ( CNS ) enhancers turn on eve expres - sion in a subset of cells in each of these tissues . These late enhancers continue to function once germband retraction is complete , while another enhancer ( APR ) induces transcription in the presumptive anal plate . Located just upstream of eve is CG12134 , while the TER94 gene is downstream . Unlike eve , both of these genes are ubiquitously expressed throughout much of embryogenesis . Results Homie pairs with itself and with Nhomie The Homie insulator has two striking properties [ 26 ] . First it directs homing of otherwise ran - domly inserting transgenes to a ~ 5 Mb region centered on the eve locus . Second , when the homed transgene carries a reporter , it is expressed in an eve - like pattern , the completeness of which diminishes with distance . Early stripe and later CNS expression are limited to 200 kb from eve , mesodermal expression has an intermediate distance dependence , while anal plate ring ( APR ) expression is seen at distances of several Mb . We showed previously that reporter expression at a site within the hebe gene 142 kb upstream of eve requires Homie [ 26 ] . Since other fly insulators mediate long - distance regulatory interactions by direct physical contact [ 22 , 33 ] , we used high - resolution chromosome conformation capture ( H3C ) [ 34 ] to map con - tacts between transgenes at - 142 kb and eve ( see below ) . The transgenes have an eve - promoter - lacZ ( lacZ ) reporter and Homie . One of them is inserted into the chromosome so that Homie is oriented in the same direction ( ! ; Fig 1A , transgene # 1 ) as the endogenous Homie in the eve locus , while the other transgene is inserted in the opposite orientation ( ; Fig 1A , transgene # 2 ) . In the control transgene , Homie was Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 3 / 25 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 4 / 25 replaced by DNA ( Fig 1A , transgene # 3 ) . Fig 1A shows that the reporters in both Homie trans - genes are regulated by the eve enhancers in a pattern which recapitulates that of endogenous eve . Thus , the orientation of the entire Homie : lacZ transgene in the chromosome doesn ’ t affect long - distance regulation . On the other hand , because of a hebe CNS enhancer located upstream of - 142 kb , the expression pattern is not identical . In the transgene that is oriented so that Homie is closer to the eve locus than the reporter ( Fig 1A , 2 nd column : transgene # 1 ) , lacZ is regulated by both the hebe CNS enhancer ( arrow in bottom panel ) and the eve enhancers ( all 4 panels ) . When the transgene is inserted in the opposite orientation so that the lacZ reporter is closer to the eve locus ( Fig 1A , 3 rd column : transgene # 2 ) , Homie blocks the hebe enhancer , and only the eve pattern is seen ( all 4 panels ) . Finally , as expected , the reporter in the DNA control transgene ( Fig 1A , right column : transgene # 3 ) is not regulated by the eve enhancers ( all 4 panels ) , but is regulated by the hebe enhancer ( arrow in bottom panel ) . In this case , the reporter is separated from the hebe enhancer by DNA , not Homie . These results show that Homie induces a long - range interaction between a reporter transgene located many kilobases away and endogenous eve enhancers , and that this interaction is not sensitive to the orientation of the transgene in the chromosome . ( However , this experiment does not test the orientation dependence of the reporter relative to the insulator , as this does not change between these two cases . This is tested below . ) Furthermore , the long - range looping interactions between the transgene and the eve locus do not change the local enhancer blocking activity of the Homie insulator . Since insulator bypass assays show that fly insulators pair with themselves [ 35 – 37 ] , we expected that Homie : Homie pairing is responsible for long - distance regulation . However , as the transgene Homie might also interact with other eve elements , we used 11 primers spanning the locus ( Fig 1B , arrows numbered 0 – 10 ) for H3C . Fig 1C shows the 3C results for the experi - mental and for the control DNA transgene , while in the inset we controlled for “ non - specific ” interactions using data from the DNA transgene as the reference . Whereas there is little inter - action between the control transgene and the eve locus ( Fig 1C green line ) , the experimental transgene shows significant interactions with two elements in the locus ( magenta line ) . One is endogenous Homie . The other is located at the 5 ’ boundary of the eve Polycomb domain [ 38 , 39 ] , and , from genome - wide chromatin immunoprecipitation studies [ 40 ] , is bound in vivo by many insulator proteins . Based on these and findings below , we call this eve 5 ’ insulator Nhomie . Fig 1 . Homie - carrying transgenes pair with endogenous eve .

However , this doesn ’ t mean that reporter activation is independent of the relative orientation within the transgene of Homie and the reporter . To explore this possibility , we generated a transgene with two divergently transcribed reporters , lacZ and GFP ( both are driven by the same eve basal pro - moter , see Materials and Methods ) . We then inserted Homie in both orientations between the two reporters . Fig 2A shows that in the endogenous eve locus , Homie is located downstream of the eve transcription unit in what we have designated as the “ forward ” 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation ( ! ) . In transgene # 4 ( Fig 2A ) , using this same 5 ’ ! 3 ’ convention for the relative orientation of the Homie insulator , the lacZ reporter would be located 5 ’ with respect to Homie . Thus , in this transgene the relationship between the reporter and Homie is just like the endogenous eve locus where the eve gene is located 5 ’ to Homie . The eve - GFP reporter is in turn located 3 ’ to the Homie insulator in the same relative position as the TER94 gene is with respect to the endogenous Homie . In transgene # 5 ( Fig 2A ) , the 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation of Homie is flipped , so that GFP is now located 5 ’ relative to the Homie insulator , while lacZ is 3 ’ . Each transgene was Fig 2 .

B : locations of transgenes used in Fig 1 in the chromosome relative to endogenous eve ( middle , linear diagrams ) and topologies ( “ circle - loop ” for transgene # 1 or “ stem - loop ” for transgene # 2 ; green block arrows indicate activation of the reporter by endogenous eve enhancers ) consistent with the results shown in Fig 1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 . g002 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 6 / 25 then inserted at - 142 kb so that GFP is on the same side of Homie as the hebe enhancer , while lacZ is separated from the hebe enhancer by Homie ( see diagrams in Fig 3A and 3B ) . The two reporters in transgene # 4 differ dramatically in their pattern ( s ) of expression ( Fig 3A ) . In the case of the lacZ reporter , the eve enhancers activate expression in stripes in the early embryo , as well as in the CNS , mesoderm , and anal plate during mid - embryogenesis ( green arrows ) . The lacZ reporter is not , however , activated by the hebe enhancer , as it is insulated by Homie . A quite different result is observed for the GFP reporter . First , unlike lacZ , it is not sub - ject to regulation by the eve enhancers . Second , it is subject to regulation by the hebe enhancer ( Fig 3A , black arrow ) . In transgene # 5 , the target for regulatory interactions with the eve locus is reversed ( Fig 3B ) . Here , GFP is regulated by the eve enhancers ( green arrows ) , while lacZ is not . And , since the orientation of the transgene in the chromosome remains the same , the hebe enhancer still activates GFP ( Fig 3B , black arrow ) , while Homie blocks it from regulating lacZ . These findings indicate that pairing interactions between the transgene Homie and the eve locus are orientation - specific . With respect to the endogenous Homie insulator ( see below for Nhomie ) , the pairing interactions could be head - to - head or head - to - tail ( Fig 3 diagrams ) . In the simplest topological model , head - to - head interactions predict that the lacZ reporter will be activated by eve enhancers when the 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation of Homie in the transgene places this reporter 5 ’ of Homie , just as the eve enhancers in the eve locus are 5 ’ of the endogenous Homie ( Fig 3A , transgene # 4 , “ stem - loop ” topology ) . The GFP reporter will be activated when the ori - entation of the transgene Homie is reversed ( Fig 3B , transgene # 5 , “ circle - loop ” topology ) . The opposite pattern of activation is expected if Homie interactions are head - to - tail ( Fig 3A and 3B , bottom diagrams ) . In each case , the topology of one of the variants is a stem - loop , while the topology of the other variant is a circle - loop . As can be seen from the expression patterns in Fig 3 , it is head - to - head pairing between the transgene and endogenous Homie that fits the pat - tern of activation . Why are the regulatory interactions in Fig 3 orientation - dependent , while those in Fig 1 are not ? The difference lies in how we altered the orientation of the insulator in the two experi - ments . In the experiments in Fig 3 , the 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation of the Homie insulator in the trans - gene with respect to the two reporter genes was reversed . In contrast , in the experiments in Fig 1 , the relative 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation the Homie insulator with respect to the reporter was main - tained ( the reporter is 5 ’ with respect to Homie ) , while the orientation of the entire transgene was flipped . In the experiment in Fig 1 ( illustrated in Fig 2B ) head - to - head pairing between the Homie insulators in the transgene and the eve locus generates either a circle - loop ( top , trans - gene # 1 ) or a stem - loop ( bottom , transgene # 2 ) . However , in both cases , the eve enhancers are brought into close proximity to the lacZ reporter . Note that as in Fig 3 , the structure of the loops predicted for head - to - tail pairing of the Homie insulators in the Fig 1 experiments would place the lacZ reporter and the enhancers in the eve locus on opposite sides of the paired insula - tors , which would not be conducive for productive regulatory interactions ( not illustrated ) . Nhomie mediates long - distance regulatory interactions with eve and insulates a reporter Our 3C experiments identified a second element , Nhomie , in the eve locus that interacts physi - cally with Homie at - 142 kb ( Fig 1C ) . We wondered whether Nhomie could also promote long distance regulatory interactions and function as an insulator . To test for these activities , we combined the Nhomie insulator with the lacZ reporter ( Fig 2A ) . The Nhomie : lacZ transgene was inserted at - 142 kb so that Nhomie is located between the lacZ reporter and the hebe enhancer ( Fig 4A diagram , transgene # 6 ) . Since the relative orientation of Homie and the reporter was critical for productive regulatory interactions , we tested Nhomie in both Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 7 / 25 Fig 3 .

Using the same convention as was used for Homie , the 5 ’ ! 3 ’ ori - entation of Nhomie in the endogenous locus places the eve enhancers and the eve gene 3 ’ of Nhomie . In transgene # 6 ( Fig 4A ) , the 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation of Nhomie places lacZ is the same position relative to Nhomie as are the eve enhancers and eve gene in the endogenous locus : the reporter is located 3 ’ relative to Nhomie . In transgene # 7 ( Fig 4B ) , Nhomie is in the reverse ori - entation with respect to lacZ . In this case , the 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation of Nhomie places the reporter 5 ’ with respect to the insulator . Our experiments show that Nhomie shares many properties with Homie . Like Homie , it functions as an insulator and blocks the hebe enhancer from activating the reporter ( Fig 4 ) . It is also able to mediate long - distance regulation of the reporter by eve enhancers ( Fig 4A ) . More - over , as for Homie , these regulatory interactions depend upon the orientation of Nhomie rela - tive to lacZ . However , the orientation of Nhomie with respect to the reporter that engenders robust activation is the opposite that of Homie . For Homie , the reporter is activated when it is located 5 ’ with respect to the orientation of the insulator , just like the eve gene is 5 ’ of the endogenous Homie . By contrast , for Nhomie , the reporter is activated when the orientation of the insulator places it 3 ’ relative to Nhomie ; again , just as the eve gene is located 3 ’ relative to the endogenous Nhomie . Homie mediates homolog alignment and pairing Our 3C experiments show that Homie at - 142 kb physically interacts with Homie at the 3 ’ end of the eve locus ( Fig 1C ) . It is clear from bypass experiments that self - interactions like that observed for Homie are not unusual , but instead are a characteristic property of fly insulators [ 35 – 37 , 41 , 42 ] . However , these transgene assays artificially juxtapose homologous partners in cis , as we have done here . In the endogenous setting , homologous partners are only present on the other homolog , and it is in this context that homologous interactions would be biologically relevant . Given that most fly insulators self - interact head - to - head , a plausible idea is that insu - lators are the elements responsible both for locally aligning homologs in precise register and for maintaining their stable association . The classical evidence for homolog pairing in Drosophila is transvection [ 43 – 45 ] . Transvec - tion is a regulatory interaction that occurs in trans rather than in cis , and requires local pairing of homologs . Typically two mutant alleles complement because the regulatory elements on one homolog activate the gene on the other homolog . Complementation is lost when pairing of the two alleles is disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements [ 46 ] . While a special combination of mutations is generally required to detect transvection , trans - regulatory interactions are clearly important for achieving appropriate levels of gene activity in wild - type flies [ 47 ] . The hypothesis that homologous insulator : insulator interactions are responsible for the pairing of homologs in register makes two predictions . First , placing homologous insulators in trans should promote transvection . Second , if the homologous interactions of the test insulator are orientation - dependent , transvection is expected to be greater when both copies are oriented in the same direction than when they are oriented in opposite directions . This is expected because self - pairing interactions are likely to be head - to - head rather than head - to - tail . There are two reasons behind this expectation . One is that the self - interactions detected in insulator bypass experiments are typically head - to - head , not head - to - tail [ 41 , 48 , 49 ] . The other is that head - to - tail self - interactions between endogenous insulators on each homolog would likely interfere with homolog alignment as well as transvection . To test these predictions , we generated two transgenes , one containing the eve APR and mesoderm ( Me ) enhancers [ 25 ] , and the second containing the lacZ reporter . The transgenes were inserted into a site far away from endogenous eve ( on a different chromosome arm , at Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 10 / 25 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 11 / 25 cytological location 23C4 , where we do not see interactions with endogenous enhancers [ 26 ] ) , oriented so that both the enhancers and reporter are on the centromere - distal side of their respective transgene ( Fig 5A ) . In the first experiment , the enhancer transgene had λ DNA , while the reporter had either DNA or Homie . Since there are insulator - like elements near the 23C4 attP site ( one ~ 50 bp distal to the attP site , another ~ 8 kb proximal ) [ 40 ] , we expected to see some transvection [ 50 , 51 ] when either : lacZ or Homie : lacZ is trans to the : enhancer trans - gene . Fig 5A ( top two panels ) shows that the APR enhancer weakly activates lacZ ( green arrows ) , while there is virtually no Me - driven expression ( red arrows ) . As predicted , the pres - ence of a forward - oriented Homie in the enhancer transgene substantially augments transvec - tion ( Fig 5A , 3 rd panel ) . Not only is APR expression much stronger ( green arrow ) , but Me - driven expression is also clearly observed ( red arrow ) . To confirm that stable pairing is head - to - head , we reversed Homie in the enhancer trans - gene ( maintaining the overall transgene orientation in the chromosome ) . In this configuration , head - to - head pairing would introduce an S - shaped double loop . As illustrated in Fig 5A ( “ twisted pairing ” ) , this would place the reporter on the opposite side of the paired insulators from the transgenic enhancers . This configuration would not be expected to increase enhancer - reporter interactions . Consistent with this prediction , reporter expression is about the same ( Fig 5A , bottom panel ) as in the negative controls carrying DNA ( Fig 5A , top two panels ) . Alternatively , the need to form such a double loop might make this pairing interaction less stable than for the other orientation , when the head - to - head pairing reinforces the normal pairing of the homologs ( “ tightly paired ” in the diagram ) . In fact , evidence below is more con - sistent with such “ twisted pairing ” interactions forming only transiently , or not at all ( hence the red “ X ” in the diagram for “ twisted pairing ” ) . This is in line with the expectation , stated above , that head - to - head self - interactions between endogenous insulators mediate homolog alignment and pairing , while head - to - tail self - interactions are incompatible with smooth align - ment and tight pairing . To further explore the relationship between pairing direction and transvection , we gener - ated dual reporters with divergently transcribed GFP and lacZ that have either DNA or Homie inserted between the reporters ( Fig 5B ) . When the DNA : dual reporter is trans to the Homie - enhancer transgene , the APR enhancer weakly stimulates lacZ and GFP in the APR , while nei - ther reporter is activated by the Me enhancer . The addition of Homie to the reporter ( in the same orientation in the chromosome as that of Homie in the enhancer transgene ) substantially enhances APR lacZ transcription , and turns on lacZ in the mesoderm . By contrast , there is only a slight increase in APR GFP expression , while mesoderm expression is detectable , but only weakly . The differences in transvection for the two reporters are consistent with the topol - ogy generated by head - to - head , not head - to - tail pairing ( Fig 5B , “ tightly paired ” ) . We also combined the dual reporter with an enhancer transgene in which the entire trans - gene containing Homie and the enhancers are flipped ( Fig 5B , bottom panel ) . Head - to - head pairing of Homie would generate an S - shaped double loop ( as diagrammed in Fig 5B , “ twisted pairing ” ) . In this case , there is little or no enhancement of transvection for either reporter , sug - gesting that the introduction of such a double loop between the paired homologs either is unstable or does not form ( indicated by the red “ X ” in the diagram for “ twisted pairing ” ) .

This includes all the cases where our topology diagrams are labeled as “ loosely paired ” or “ twisted pairing ” . These differences may be due to a combination of several factors , such as differences in the size of the transgenes , weak or unstable interactions with insulators near the site of transgene insertion , or the shield - ing of transgenic reporters from position effects that weakly upregulate or downregulate reporter activity . Nhomie promotes homolog pairing We next tested whether Nhomie self - interactions in trans also induce transvection . Nhomie was oriented in the single reporter transgene so that the lacZ reporter ( diagrammed in Fig 6A ) is 3 ’ with respect to Nhomie . It was then combined in trans with an enhancer transgene that had or Nhomie ( in the same 5 ’ ! 3 ’ orientation in the chromosome ) so that the two enhancers are 3 ’ of Nhomie ( Fig 6A ) . In the : Nhomie combination , the APR enhancer drives only weak expression , and activation by the Me enhancer is not seen . As would be predicted if head - to - head pairing aligns the enhancers and the reporter , lacZ expression is substantially elevated in the Nhomie : Nhomie combination . This conclusion is confirmed by the dual reporter assay . As shown in the lower half of Fig 6B , head - to - head pairing of Nhomie in the enhancer and dual reporter transgenes would juxtapose the Me and APR enhancers with the lacZ reporter , while the GFP reporter would be separated from the enhancers by the paired Nhomie insulators . In this configuration , the Me and APR should preferentially drive lacZ expression , not GFP expression , and this is what is observed . Transvection induced by combining Homie and Nhomie While Homie - Homie or Nhomie - Nhomie self - interactions normally occur at the endogenous eve locus only in trans , this is not the case for Nhomie - Homie interactions . Heterologous inter - actions between neighboring insulators in cis are thought to be responsible for subdividing chromosomes into a series of topologically independent domains , and are expected to occur all along the chromosome . Like self - interactions , heterologous interactions are known to be spe - cific [ 37 , 42 , 52 , 53 ] , and consequently are likely also orientation - dependent . For heterologous insulators interacting in cis , we define their endogenous directionalities to be the same . That is , the arrows that represent them point in the same “ forward ” direction along the chromosome ( as in Figs 1 – 4 for endogenous Nhomie and Homie ) . Using this convention , at the endogenous eve locus , head - to - tail interactions between Nhomie and Homie would generate a stem - loop , while head - to - head interactions would generate a looped circle or “ circle - loop . ” To test whether these two insulators can interact with each other independently of the eve locus , and ( if so ) determine their orientation dependence , we combined a Nhomie - lacZ reporter with two different Homie - enhancer transgenes . In the one in which the enhancers are 5 ’ of Homie ( Fig 6C , top panel ) , head - to - tail pairing with Nhomie should align the enhancer and reporter , and favor transvection . When the enhancer transgene has Homie in the reverse orientation ( Fig 6C , bottom panel ) , enhancer - reporter alignment would be favored by head - to - head pairing . Fig 6C shows that Nhomie and Homie can pair with each other in a foreign context ( top panel ) , and that transvection is favored by head - to - tail pairing ( top panel vs . bottom panel ) . These findings parallel those for self - pairing ( Figs 5 and 6A and 6B ) , except that heterologous pairing is head - to - tail rather than head - to - head . To confirm these results , we combined the dual lacZ , GFP reporter containing Homie with an enhancer transgene containing Nhomie . As illustrated in Fig 6D , head - to - tail pairing of Nhomie and Homie would juxtapose the enhancers with lacZ , while head - to - head pairing Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 13 / 25 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 14 / 25 would juxtapose the enhancers with GFP . Consistent with head - to - tail pairing , lacZ transvec - tion is stimulated , while GFP is not ( compare 6D with the control in the upper half of 6B ) . Homie and Nhomie long - distance interactions are eve - independent The insulator interactions in the transvection assay are local and likely facilitated by homolog pairing . To confirm that the eve insulators can interact specifically with themselves and with each other over large chromosomal distances , we took advantage of attP 25C1 , located 2 Mb distal to 23C4 . A Homie : lacZ transgene was inserted at 25C1 . It was combined with an enhancer transgene at 23C4 containing either DNA or Homie ( Fig 7A ) . No interaction between the transgenes is evident with the DNA control or when is replaced by the su ( Hw ) insulator . On the other hand , when both the reporter and the enhancer have a Homie insulator , the APR enhancer is able to activate lacZ expression ( Fig 7A , upper left panel ) . This result is consistent with previous studies which showed that APR was the only enhancer in the endogenous eve locus that could act over distances > 1 Mb with Homie - carrying transgenes [ 26 ] . As would be expected from the orientation dependence of insulator self - pairing , when Homie is inverted within the enhancer transgene ( Fig 7A , upper right panel ) , expression is not seen , confirming that Homie - Homie pairing is head - to - head . We also tested whether Nhomie can mediate distant regulatory interactions either with itself or with Homie . In the two transgenes used to test Nhomie self - interactions , the enhancers or reporter , respectively , are each located 3 ’ relative to the adjacent insulator . These Nhomie transgenes were inserted ( separately ) at 23C4 and 25C1 , then crossed into the same animals . Fig 7B shows that Nhomie : Nhomie interactions can mediate long - distance activation of lacZ by the APR enhancer ( Fig 7B , lower right ) . Nhomie also pairs with Homie , enabling the APR enhancer in the Nhomie transgene at 23C4 to activate a Homie - lacZ reporter at 25C1 ( Fig 7B , upper left ) . As illustrated in Fig 7 , these interactions are all consistent with the orientation dependence seen in the other assays , namely head - to - head self - pairing and head - to - tail heter - ologous pairing . Nhomie and Homie physically interact in the endogenous eve locus The experiments described above indicate that Nhomie and Homie must be able to physically pair with each other , and do so in a head - to - tail orientation . In the endogenous locus , head - to - tail pairing would generate a stem - loop containing the eve transcription unit and its associated enhancers and Polycomb silencers , linked together at the base by the Nhomie and Homie insu - lators . 3C experiments with Homie as the anchor confirm that Nhomie and Homie contact each other in the eve locus ( Fig 1D ) . Discussion The importance of insulators in organizing eukaryotic chromosomes has been recognized since their discovery in the 1980 ’ s . However , the principles underlying their architectural and genetic functions have not been fully elucidated . With this goal in mind , we asked how these elements shape two critical architectural features of chromosomes . The first is homolog pairing . Fig 6 . Nhomie - Nhomie and Nhomie - Homie pairing facilitate transvection . Transgenes are as in Fig 5 , except that block arrows labeled “ Nh ” are Nhomie . Stage 13 embryos are shown . A and C : single reporter RNA in the APR ( green arrow ) and the mesoderm ( red arrow ) . A red “ X ” in the “ twisted topology ” diagram indicates that this topology , predicted based on head - to - tail pairing between Homie and Nhomie , may not form in this case because it tends to disrupt homolog pairing . The chromosomal fragment used here for Nhomie is the same as that used in Fig 4 ( 1329 bp , see S1 and S2 Figs ) . B and D : dual reporter RNA ( lacZ or GFP , as indicated at the top ) from the diagrammed transgene combinations . The chromosomal fragment used here for Nhomie is a shorter version ( 603 bp ) that retains most of the long - range interaction activity of the larger fragment ( in the same assay as in Fig 4 , shown in S2 Fig ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 . g006 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 15 / 25 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 16 / 25 Homologs pair in flies from the blastoderm stage onward , and the consequent trans - interac - tions are important for proper gene regulation . The phenomenon of homolog pairing is not unique to Drosophila [ 24 , 54 ] . Homologs are paired in lampbrush chromosomes of invertebrate and vertebrate oocytes . The second is the looped domain organization [ 20 , 21 , 55 ] . Although there is now compelling evidence that insulators subdivide chromosomes into topologically independent looped domains ( and that these domains play a central role in gene regulation ) , the topology of the loops is unknown . Moreover , while the loops must emanate from the main axis of the chromosome , the relationships between the loops , the insulators that delimit them , and the main chromosomal axis are not understood . As homolog pairing is more straightfor - ward and the likely mechanism better documented , it is considered first . Insulators and homolog pairing Homolog pairing requires mechanisms for aligning homologs in precise register , and main - taining their stable association . While many schemes are imaginable , the simplest utilizes ele - ments distributed along each homolog that have self - interaction specificity . Such a mechanism would be consistent with the persistence of local pairing and transvection in chromosomal rearrangements [ 44 , 56 – 60 ] . It would also fit with studies on the pairing process [ 56 , 61 , 62 ] . Self - association of pairing elements would locally align sequences in register , and ultimately link homologs together along their entire length . In this mechanism , self - association must be specific and also directional , namely head - to - head . This avoids the introduction of unresolv - able loops and maximizes pairing for transvection . In Drosophila , the homing of P - element transgenes , in which normally random insertion becomes targeted , suggested the ability of genomic elements to self - interact . Such a homing activ - ity was found in the engrailed locus for a region that includes two PREs [ 63 – 65 ] , and later studies showed that some insulators [ 26 , 66 , 67 ] and a promoter region [ 68 ] also possess homing activity . The self - interaction implied by homing suggests that these elements may facilitate homolog pair - ing . However , in contrast to PREs and promoters , insulators have consistently been found to engage in specific self - interactions ( see below ) . Thus , among the known elements in the fly genome , insulators are the best candidates to align homologs in register and maintain pairing [ 20 , 21 ] . Moreover , genome - wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments ( ChIPs ) show that insulators are distributed at appropriate intervals along each chromosome [ 18 , 19 ] . A role in homolog pairing was first suggested by the discovery that the su ( Hw ) and Mcp insulators each can mediate regulatory interactions between transgenes inserted at distant sites [ 69 , 70 ] . The Fab - 7 insulator can also mediate long - range regulatory effects [ 71 ] . Further evi - dence that self - association is characteristic of fly insulators came from insulator bypass experi - ments [ 35 , 36 ] . These experiments showed that bypass is observed when an insulator is paired with itself , while heterologous combinations are less effective or don ’ t give bypass [ 37 , 41 , 42 , 48 , 72 , 73 ] . Moreover , self - pairing is , with few exceptions , head - to - head . That insulators mediate homolog pairing through specific self - interactions is further sup - ported by our studies . Using a classical transvection assay , we found that Homie - Homie and Nhomie - Nhomie combinations stimulate trans - regulatory interactions between enhancers on Fig 7 . Specific insulator interactions bring distant regions together in trans . Each construct diagrammed in red is at 25C1 , and in blue at 23C4 . A : Homie - Homie pairing . Top , overview : reporter ( lacZ ) with Homie ( magenta arrow ) , and enhancer transgene ( “ Me - APR ” ) with either Homie or DNA ( as diagrammed ) at sites ~ 2 Mb apart . In doubly transgenic embryos , lacZ RNA is seen in the APR ( green arrow , upper left panel ) only when both transgenes carry Homie . However , when Homie is inverted within the enhancer transgene ( upper right panel ) , expression is not seen , confirming the head - to - head orientation specificity of Homie - Homie pairing . B : Homie - Nhomie and Nhomie - Nhomie pairings . Top : overview , as in A ; “ Nh ” is Nhomie . Bottom : β - gal ( lacZ protein ) staining in the APR ( green arrows ) is seen , facilitated by either head - to - head Homie or Nhomie self - pairing , or by head - to - tail Nhomie - Homie pairing , as diagrammed . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 . g007 Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 17 / 25 one homolog and a reporter on the other ( Figs 5 , 6A and 6B ) . Moreover , the parameters that favor transvection dovetail with those expected for a pairing mechanism based on insulator self - interactions in trans . First , the two insulators must be in the same orientation . When they are in opposite orientations , transvection is not enhanced ( or enhancement is much weaker , Fig 5 ) . Second , the enhancers and reporter must be located on the same side ( centromere prox - imal or distal ) of the insulators ( Figs 5 , 6A and 6B ) . In addition to transvection , Homie and Nhomie also engage in highly specific and directional distant regulatory interactions ( Fig 7 ) . While there is compelling evidence that insulator self - interactions are responsible for homo - log pairing , many issues remained unresolved . Perhaps the most important is the nature of the code used for self - recognition and orientation . The best hint comes from bypass experiments using multimerized binding sites for Su ( Hw ) , dCTCF , or Zw5 . Homologous multimer combi - nations give bypass , while heterologous combinations do not . However , bypass is observed for composite multimers when they are inserted in opposite orientations ( e . g . , Su ( Hw ) dCTCF $ dCTCF Su ( Hw ) ) , but not the same orientation ( e . g . , Su ( Hw ) dCTCF ! ! Su ( Hw ) dCTCF ) [ 53 ] . These findings argue that the identity and order of proteins bound to the insulator deter - mine its self - association properties . Topology of looped domains and the higher order architecture of the chromosome The first direct evidence that insulators generate loops came from 3C experiments on the mouse β - globin and the fly 87A7 heat shock loci [ 23 , 74 ] . These studies suggested that physical interactions between adjacent insulators in cis could subdivide chromosomes into looped domains . Subsequent work has confirmed this conclusion [ 17 ] . However , while these experi - ments demonstrate that cis insulator interactions generate loops , they provided no information about the topology of these loops , or how they are arranged . Cis interactions could , a priori , be either head - to - head like self - association in trans , or head - to - tail . The consequences are quite different . Head - to - head interactions generate a circle - loop , while head - to - tail interactions generate a stem - loop ( Fig 8A and 8D , respectively ) . If heterolo - gous insulators interact with only one specific partner , the circle - loop or the stem - loop will be linked to neighboring circles or stem - loops by loops without anchors . These unanchored loops would correspond to the main axis of the chromosome , and the circle - loops or stem - loops would then protrude from the main axis in a random orientation and at distances determined by the length and compaction of the unanchored loops . On the other hand , if insulators in a chromosomal segment are able to interact with both of their neighbors , then the main axis of the chromosome in this region would be defined by the insulators . Quite different structures are predicted for head - to - head and head - to - tail interac - tions ( Fig 8B and 8E ) . Head - to - head would give a series of variably sized circle - loops linked together at their base by an array of interacting insulators . The base would correspond to the main axis of the chromosome , and each circle - loop would extend from one side of the main axis to the other . If the direction of coiling were always the same , this would give a structure resembling a helix anchored to a rod ( Fig 8B ) . If the direction of coiling were random , the structure would be more complicated and variable , since neighboring circle - loops could extend out from the main axis in either the same or the opposite direction ( not illustrated ) . The loop - axis relationship would be more regular for head - to - tail insulator pairing in cis . Adjacent stem - loops would extend out from the main axis in opposite directions much like the lampbrush chromosomes formed when haploid sperm heads are injected into amphibian oocytes ( Fig 8E ) [ 75 ] . This stem - loop organization would also fit with the radial loop model proposed by Laemmli and others for the first level of folding of metaphase chromosomes [ 7 , 11 ] . Insulator Pairing Determines Chromosome Topology PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1005889 February 24 , 2016 18 / 25 Since our experiments show that Homie - Nhomie association is head - to - tail , the topology of the eve locus in vivo is a stem - loop , not a circle - loop . This finding raises a number of questions . Perhaps the most important is whether head - to - tail interactions are the rule rather than the exception . While the orientation dependence of homologous interactions has been extensively investigated , there have been no systematic studies on interactions between neighboring insula - tors . However , there are reasons to think that cis interactions are more likely head - to - tail than head - to - head . One is homolog pairing . As mentioned above , the circle - loops formed by head - to - head interactions can coil in either direction , either left - handed or right - handed . If coiling were random , then about half of the circle - loops on each homolog would be coiled in opposite directions . In this case , head - to - head pairing of homologous insulators in each homolog would generate a structure in which the circle - loops would point in opposite directions ( Fig 8C , left circles ) . This topology would not be compatible with transvection . Coiling of the circle - loops in the same direction on both homologs would permit interdigitation of one circle - loop inside the other ( Fig 8C , right circles ) ; however , the chromatin fiber from the inside circle - loop would need to cross in on one side and out on the other . If the main axis of the chromosome in the paired region is defined by a series of interacting insulators in cis , then generating a topology permissive for transvection ( not illustrated ) would require coiling of successive homologous circle - loops on each homolog in the same direction , one inside the other ( Fig 8C , right circles ) .

Head - to - head pairing of homologous insulators in trans would bring regula - tory elements and genes in the two homologous stem - loops into close proximity . Alignment of the two homologs is straightforward whether or not the main axis of the chromosome is defined by a series of interacting insulators ( Fig 8F illustrates one of these cases ) . Alternating loops extending upwards and downwards from the main axis of the chromosome would be directly aligned when homologous insulators pair head - to - head in trans . While the requirements for aligning and pairing homologs would appear to favor stem - loops between heterologous insulators in cis in flies , homolog pairing does not occur in verte - brates except in specialized cell types [ 76 ] . This could mean that circle - loops formed by cis interactions between heterologous insulators are permissible in vertebrate chromosomes . However , even in organisms in which homolog pairing doesn ’ t occur in somatic cells , it seems possible that cis - pairing interactions more commonly generate stem - loops than circle - loops . First , following DNA replication and before mitosis ( during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle ) , sister chromatids are aligned . Maintaining this alignment may facilitate epigenetic mechanisms that template chromatin structures from one cellular generation to the next , such as the copying of histone modifications onto both daughter chromosomes . The simpler topology of stem - loops could facilitate this sister chromatid pairing , as well as their separa - tion during mitosis . Second , recent studies on the relationship between loop domains and CTCF insulators showed that in more than 90 % of the cases , the CTCF binding sites on opposite ends of a loop are in opposite orientation [ 17 ] . Thus , assuming that the orientation of pairing is such that the CTCF sites are aligned in parallel to form the loop , pairing between CTCF insulators at the ends of the loop would generate stem - loops rather than circle - loops . If insulators form the main axis of the chromosome , there is an additional explanation for such a bias . As shown in Fig 8B , head - to - head pairing in cis could generate a series of circular loops that extend out from the same side of the main axis . This configuration would be favor - able for crosstalk between regulatory elements and genes in adjacent loops . By contrast , head - to - tail pairing , where adjacent stem - loops extend out in opposite directions ( Fig 8E ) , would disfavor crosstalk , helping to explain how insulators block enhancer - promoter com - munication between adjacent loops .

Embryos ( 200 μ l aged 0 - 6h at ~ 23°C ) were cross - linked in either 2 % or 3 % formaldehyde for either 15 or 30 min ( each gave similar results , and were included in the data presented ) , digested with 100U each of EcoRI ( Roche ) and MfeI ( NEB ) at 37°C overnight . About half of the material was ligated ( Takara , 3500U ) for > 4 hr . at ~ 23°C , and incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse cross - links . Following RNase A ( Roche , 40 μ g / sample ) and proteinase K ( Roche , 220 μ g / sample ) digestions , purified DNA ( 20ng / reaction ) was subjected to real - time PCR analysis using SYBR Green Master Mix ( Roche ) . All transgenes inserted at - 142 kb used for 3C analysis had the same tag sequence , which was used as the anchor primer ( Fig 1C ) , in combination with each of a series of accompanying primers from within the eve locus . To identify Homie - interacting regions within endogenous eve , an endogenous Homie fragment - specific primer was used as anchor ( Fig 1D ) , along with the same series of accompanying primers . These sequences are given in S1 Fig . PCR quantification was done as described [ 34 ] , with the following set - up . The fragments in the eve locus created by EcoRI and MfeI digestion were cloned into anchor fragment - carrying plasmids , and served as standards for the expected ligation products . These plasmids were line - arized and mixed with equimolar amounts of digested genomic DNA . Details of the various controls , such as the choice of primers and enzymes , were appropriate for each specific experi - ment [ 34 ] . Additional details are given in the legend to Fig 1 .

The assay of Fig 4A ( same transgenic reporter , same trans - gene insertion site , same transgene orientation in the chromosome , same orientation of the tested genomic fragment in the transgene as transgene # 6 , Fig 4A ) was used to assess the two “ halves ” of Nhomie ( 1329 bp ) for the ability to induce interactions between endogenous eve enhancers and a transgenic promoter - reporter located at - 142 kb relative to the endogenous eve transcription start site . Embryonic stages are indicated on the left . The sequences tested ( “ 1329 bp ” indicates the origi - nal Nhomie fragment used in Fig 4 , as well as in Fig 6A and 6C , “ left half ” indicates the eve - distal 729 bp , “ right half ” indicates the eve - proximal 603 bp used in Fig 6B and 6D ) are given in S1 Fig . Note that only the “ right half ” induces expression in an eve pattern , while the “ left half ” not only has lost the ability to induce the long - range interaction with endogenous eve , but has also lost the ability to block interactions between the nearby hebe enhancer and the transgenic reporter ( black arrow , as also seen in Fig 1A , transgenes # 1 and # 3 , and in Fig 3B , transgene # 5 ’ s GFP reporter ) .
