Depolymerization of cortical actin inhibits UT - A1 urea transporter endocytosis but promotes forskolin - stimulated membrane trafﬁcking . Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 302 : C1012 – C1018 , 2012 . First published January 18 , 2012 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00440 . 2011 . —The cytoskeleton partici - pates in many aspects of transporter protein regulation . In this study , by using yeast two - hybrid screening , we identiﬁed the cytoskeletal protein actin as a binding partner with the UT - A1 urea transporter . This suggests that actin plays a role in regulating UT - A1 activity . Actin speciﬁcally binds to the carboxyl terminus of UT - A1 . A serial mutation study shows that actin binding to UT - A1’s carboxyl termi - nus was abolished when serine 918 was mutated to alanine . In polarized UT - A1 - MDCK cells , cortical ﬁlamentous ( F ) actin colocal - izes with UT - A1 at the apical membrane and the subapical cytoplasm . In the cell surface , both actin and UT - A1 are distributed in the lipid raft microdomains . Disruption of the F - actin cytoskeleton by latrun - culin B resulted in UT - A1 accumulation in the cell membrane as measured by biotinylation . This effect was mainly due to inhibition of UT - A1 endocytosis in both clathrin and caveolin - mediated endocytic pathways . In contrast , actin depolymerization facilitated forskolin - stimulated UT - A1 trafﬁcking to the cell surface . Functionally , depo - lymerization of actin by latrunculin B signiﬁcantly increased UT - A1 urea transport activity in an oocyte expression system . Our study shows that cortical F - actin not only serves as a structural protein , but directly interacts with UT - A1 and plays an important role in control - ling UT - A1 cell surface expression by affecting both endocytosis and trafﬁcking , therefore regulating UT - A1 bioactivity . cytoskeletal protein ; latrunculin ; membrane protein ; urea transport UREA PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE in the urine concentration mecha - nism in the kidney’s inner medulla . The major mechanism for delivering urea to the inner medullary interstitium is urea reabsorption mediated by the UT - A1 urea transporter from the terminal inner medullary collecting duct ( IMCD ) ( 26 , 34 ) . A UT - A1 / A3 knockout mouse has impaired urea clear - ance and urinary concentrating ability ( 10 ) . In vivo , UT - A1 transport activity is mainly regulated by vasopressin . Vaso - pressin increases kidney urea transport activity by increas - ing UT - A1 in the apical plasma membrane ( 19 ) and UT - A1 phosphorylation ( 43 ) . Successful trafﬁcking to and residing on the cell surface are the prerequisites for transport proteins to execute their proper functions . The regulatory mechanism for membrane protein trafﬁcking to cell surface , as well as maintaining its membrane expression , is complex . It is under strict spatial and temporal regulation and is particularly controlled by some important accessory proteins . Direct protein - protein interactions by ac - cessory proteins have been shown to determine the speciﬁcity of membrane protein in sorting , membrane trafﬁcking , and retrieval ( 14 , 27 ) . During the past decade , much attention has been paid to those proteins . Several proteins , including SPA - 1 ( 27 ) , syntaxin - 3 ( 24 ) , SNAP23 ( 38 ) , Rho GTPase ( 16 , 25 ) , dynein and dynactin ( 30 ) , and actin ( 37 , 42 ) , are involved in regulating aquaporin 2 ( AQP2 ) water channel trafﬁcking and membrane expression . UT - A1 membrane trafﬁcking , endocy - tosis , and degradation has been shown to be regulated by the SNARE - associated proteins snapin ( 25 ) , dynamin ( 15 ) , caveo - lin ( 9 ) , and MDM2 ( 5 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is the basic component for the cell’s structure , with actin being one of the most abundant cytosolic proteins . It is a highly conserved protein with three isotypes ( (cid:1) , (cid:2) , (cid:3) (cid:4) 90 % aa homology ) . Actin is vital to the function of all eukaryotic cells . Not only a structural protein or a simple scaffold protein , actin is also required for mitosis , cytokinesis , cell motility , muscle contract , maintenance of cell shape , endocytosis , and secretion ( 1 , 16 ) . Actin exists in two forms , monomeric actin ( G - actin ) and ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) . F - actin is in dynamic equilibrium with soluble G - actin . The extent of F - actin polymerization / depolymerization changes ac - cording to the cell’s physiological needs and its specialization . A number of cytoskeletal proteins like ERM ( ezrin / radixin / moesin ) , many isoforms of actin , coﬁlin , dynein , and tubulin have been identiﬁed in exosomes containing AQP2 ( 29 ) . The epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) complex from bovine epi - thelia contains ankyrin , spectrin , and actin ( 36 ) . These ﬁndings suggested that actin cytoskeleton and actin - associated proteins could directly interact with and actively participate in the regulation of these channels . In addition to AQP2 ( 28 ) and ENaC ( 21 ) , the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR ( 31 ) , the Na - K - 2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 ( 20 ) , cardiac L - type Ca channels ( 33 ) , the Na (cid:5) / H (cid:5) exchanger NHE1 ( 41 ) , and the glucose transporter GLUT4 ( 18 ) are also reported to associate with actin . Some of their interactions with actin could occur indirectly by actin - associated proteins , like NHE3 indirectly binding to the cytoskeleton via actin binding adaptor protein ezrin ( 41 ) . In this study , using a yeast two - hybrid assay , we identiﬁed actin as a UT - A1 - binding protein . We further found that , in polarized epithelial cells , the cortical actin colocalizes with UT - A1 in the apical membrane and subapical cytoplasm and plays an important role in the regulation of UT - A1 cell surface expression and urea transport activity . MATERIALS AND METHODS Constructs . To generate the bait construct for the yeast two - hybrid assay , a fragment of 144 nt corresponding to the 48 aa COOH terminus of human urea transporter UT - A1 was ampliﬁed by PCR Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : G .

The insert sequence and reading frame were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . The UT - A1 COOH - terminal amino acids in pGBK - C - UT - A1 were mutated to alanine with the QuickChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Yeast two - hybrid assay . The bait of C - UT - A1 in pGBKT7 was transformed into the yeast strain AH109 ( BD Biosciences ) using the lithium acetate method . A single positive AH109 clone ( bait ) was selected from SD / - Trp plate and mated with the human kidney cDNA pretransformed library in Y187 ( BD Biosciences ) . The mating mix - tures were plated onto quadruple minus plates lacking Trp , Leu , Ade , and His . After 7 – 10 days , positive colonies were collected and replated in quadruple minus plates containing X - (cid:1) - Gal for the second screening . All positive colonies were then processed for plasmid DNA puriﬁcation and sequence analysis . In vitro translation and binding assay . In vitro translation was carried out using the TNT T7 - coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system ( Promega ) . The bait gene in pGBKT7 was tagged with c - myc and contains a T7 promoter . The targeted gene actin ( clones C30 , C35 ) in pACT2 isolated from cDNA library screening was tagged with hemagglutinin ( HA ) . A 50 - (cid:6) l reaction mixture was prepared by using 25 (cid:6) l of TNT reticulocyte lysate , 2 (cid:6) l of reaction buffer , 1 (cid:6) l of 1 mM amino acid mixture ( minus methionine ) , 2 (cid:6) l of 10 mCi / ml [ 35 S ] methionine ( Amersham ) , 1 (cid:6) g of DNA template , and 1 (cid:6) l of T7 RNA polymerase . After incubation for 30 min at 30°C , 10 (cid:6) l of bait and 10 (cid:6) l of target reaction were mixed and preincubated for 1 h , then 10 (cid:6) l of myc antibody ( BD Biosciences ) was added . For monitoring the quality of the protein synthesis , 10 (cid:6) l of bait or target reaction was incubated with c - myc or HA antibody . The combined mixtures were precipitated by protein - A beads . After washing , the beads were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and the proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE . The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography . Cell culture and cell treatment . A stably transfected MDCK cell expressing UT - A1 ( 12 ) was used in this study . The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 25 mM HEPES , and anti - biotics in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37°C . After becoming conﬂuent , the cells were treated with the following compounds alone or in different combinations : 0 . 1 (cid:6) M jasplakinolide ( Molecular Probes ) , 1 (cid:6) M latrunculin B ( Molecular Probes ) , 5 (cid:6) M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ( M (cid:2) CD , Sigma ) , or 50 (cid:6) g / ml concanavalin A ( Sigma ) , for different times as described in detail in the relevant experiments . Cells were then processed for cell surface biotinylation , lipid raft isolation , Western blot analysis , or immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Immunocytochemistry . UT - A1 - MDCK cells were grown on a Transwell insert ﬁlter ( Corning ) for 5 – 6 days to allow the cells to develop polarity . The cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min , and then were exposed to primary antibody against UT - A1 ( 1 : 400 ) for 1 h , followed by staining with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated secondary goat anti - rabbit antibody ( Sigma ) for another 1 h . To stain the F - actin , the cells were further incubated with Texas Red - X phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) ( 1 : 500 ) for 20 min . After PBS washing , the cells were mounted with Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories ) and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . Lipid raft fractionation . Lipid raft isolation was performed with a 5 – 40 % sucrose discontinuous gradient as described previously ( 4 , 15 ) . UT - A1 - MDCK cells were grown on 100 - mm plates and lysed in ice - cold 0 . 5 % Brij96 - TNEV buffer ( 10 mM Tris·HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 2 mM Na vanadate , and protease inhibitor cocktail ) for 30 min on ice . Lysates were centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm for 5 min . Five hundred microliters of postnuclear supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of 80 % sucrose in TNEV and transferred to 13 (cid:7) 51 - mm Beckman centrifuge tubes . Three milliliters of 35 % sucrose in TNEV were layered carefully on top of the mixture followed by another 1 ml layer of 5 % sucrose . The sucrose gradient was centrifuged in a SW 50 . 1 rotor ( Beckman ) at 34 , 000 rpm ( (cid:8) 110 , 000 g ) for 18 h at 4°C . Equal sizes of fractions ( (cid:8) 400 (cid:6) l ) were collected from the top to bottom of the tube and analyzed by Western blotting with respective antibodies . Biotinylation and Western blot analysis . Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described before ( 3 ) . After treatment , the cells were washed with ice - cold PBS and labeled twice with freshly prepared 1 mg / ml EZ - Link Sulfo - NHS - SS - Biotin ( Pierce ) in borate buffer for 20 min in a cold room with gentle shaking . The excess biotin was quenched with 0 . 1 M L - lysine ( Sigma ) . After washing , the cells were solubilized in 700 (cid:6) l of RIPA buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris·HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , and protease inhibitors ) . Fifty microliters of the supernatant was saved for Western blotting as pre - bead total protein , whereas 600 (cid:6) l of the supernatant was incubated with 25 (cid:6) l of Immunopure immobilized streptavidin agarose beads ( Pierce ) over - night at 4°C with gentle shaking . The biotin - labeled proteins were eluted in 35 (cid:6) l of Laemmli sample buffer and run on SDS - PAGE for Western blot analysis . The following antibodies were used for West - ern blotting : UT - A1 ( 4 ) , (cid:2) - actin ( Sigma ) , tubulin ( Sigma ) , and caveo - lin ( BD Bioscience ) . Oocyte experiments . Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and maintained in OR3 medium as described previously ( 30 ) . The capped cRNA of UT - A1 was transcribed in vitro from linearized cDNAs with T7 polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit ( Ambion ) . Two nanograms of UT - A1 cRNA in a total volume of 23 nl water were injected into each oocyte . Three days later , healthy oocytes were selected for functional assays by measuring [ 14 C ] urea uptake for each individual cell . For the cell actin depolymerization tests , oocytes were incubated with 0 . 2 (cid:6) M latrunculin in OR3 medium for 24 h . Statistical analysis . All values are expressed as means (cid:9) SD . Statistical analysis of the data was performed by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey honestly signiﬁcant difference ( HSD ) tests . Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P (cid:10) 0 . 05 . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of actin as a UT - A1 interaction partner . The urea transporter UT - A1 is a large molecule with 12 transmem - brane segments and cytoplasmic NH 2 and COOH termini . To identify the UT - A1 binding proteins , we ﬁrst used a 48 - aa COOH - terminal fragment of UT - A1 ( C - UT ) as bait and screened a 5 (cid:7) 10 7 colony - forming units of kidney cDNA library using a yeast two - hybrid assay . After the second round selection , we obtained 149 colonies . DNA sequence analysis revealed four of them are the actin genes . The association of actin and UT - A1 was conﬁrmed by an in vitro binding assay . We used a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system and labeled the newly synthesized proteins with [ 35 S ] methionine . The bait ( C - UT ) with c - myc tag and the gene products of interest ( C30 , C35 ) conjugated with HA were mixed and immunoprecipitated with c - myc antibody . Figure 1 A shows that the UT - A1 COOH terminus binds to actin ( C30 and C35 ) . Potential actin binding sites in the UT - A1 COOH terminus . To determine the actin - binding site on the COOH terminus of UT - A1 , we subjected this segment to scanning mutagenesis , converting some key amino acids to alanine . We evaluated the ability to bind actin by an in vitro binding assay . Figure 1 B shows that the mutant S918 lost its ability to bind actin . Cortical actin colocalizes with UT - A1 in polarized UT - A1 - MDCK cells . The possible interaction of UT - A1 in vivo with actin was assessed in UT - A1 - MDCK cells .

The UT - A1 MDCK cells were grown on the ﬁlter for 4 – 5 days . The UT - A1 was detected by UT - A1 antibody and visualized by FITC - conjugated secondary antibody . The F - actin was stained with Texas Red - X phalloidin . The UT - A1 ( green color ) is mainly localized in apical membrane and within the subapical cytoplasm of the MDCK cells . Actin is distributed in the cell periphery along the cell membrane . Figure 2 A shows the representative scanning from apical , middle , and basolateral sections . Cortical actin in apical sec - tions is observed to colocalize with UT - A1 . Both UT - A1 and actin are identiﬁed in cell membrane lipid raft fractions . The cell membrane contains specialized mi - crodomains referred to as lipid rafts , which are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids . UT - A1 is mainly associated with lipid rafts in IMCD ( 4 , 9 ) and HEK293 cells ( 9 , 15 ) , as well as in UT - A1 - MDCK cells ( 4 ) . We examined whether actin is also present in lipid rafts . Lipid raft fractions were isolated from UT - A1 - MDCK cells and blotted with UT - A1 and actin antibodies . Figure 2 B shows the representative blots of more than three independent experiments . Fractions 2 – 4 are denoted as the lipid raft fractions as indicated by caveolin , a marker of membrane lipid rafts . Both UT - A1 and actin are identiﬁed in cell membrane lipid raft domains . As a control for actin , tubulin , the cytosolic protein , is not found in lipid rafts . Depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton increases UT - A1 surface accumulation . Jasplakinolide binds to and stabilizes actin ﬁlaments and promotes actin polymerization ( 41 ) . In contrast , latrunculin B binds to G - actin monomers and prevents polymerization to F - actin ( 16 ) . We manipulated the actin polymerization status using these two compounds and exam - ined whether this affects UT - A1 expression in the cell mem - brane . We treated UT - A1 - MDCK cells with 0 . 1 (cid:6) M jas - plakinolide or 1 (cid:6) M latrunculin B for 1 h and then processed them for cell surface biotinylation . As seen in Fig . 3 , latrun - culin B treatment signiﬁcantly increased the amount of mem - brane UT - A1 . In contrast , jasplakinolide treatment did not affect UT - A1 cell surface expression . Fig . 1 . Urea transporter UT - A1 COOH - terminal actin binding site . A : in vitro binding assay . C - UT ( COOH - terminal fragment of 48 aa ) and the isolated actin clones ( C30 , C35 ) were in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and labeled with [ 35 S ] methionine . The newly synthesized actin clones ( C30 , C35 ) tagged by hemagglutinin ( HA ) and C - UT bait tagged by myc were processed for immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with HA or c - myc antibody and analyzed by autoradiography . B : mutation analysis . A series of potentially important amino acids in the UT - A1 COOH terminus were mutated to Ala . In each case , binding to actin clone C30 was assessed as in A .

UT - A1 molecules are quickly trafﬁcked to the cell surface upon exposure to vasopressin or the cAMP stimulator forskolin ( FSK ) ( 3 , 19 ) . We next investigated whether disruption of F - actin will affect FSK - induced UT - A1 membrane trafﬁcking . UT - A1 - MDCK cells were pretreated with latrunculin B or jasplakinolide for 40 min followed by addition of 10 (cid:6) M FSK for another 20 min . Cell surface biotinylation experiments showed that FSK stimulated UT - A1 membrane trafﬁcking , which is consistent with an earlier report ( 3 ) . Actin depolymerization by latrunculin did not block FSK’s effect ( Fig . 4 ) . On the contrary , cotreatment with latrunculin and FSK had a synergistic effect on UT - A1 membrane expres - sion . Actin depolymerization facilitates FSK stimulated - UT - A1 trafﬁcking to the surface . Actin inﬂuences both caveolin - and clathrin - mediated en - docytosis of UT - A1 . The caveolin - and clathrin - mediated en - docytotic pathways are the two major routes for endocytosis in eukaryotic cells . To examine whether actin participates in one or both pathways , UT - A1 - MDCK cells were treated with M (cid:2) CD , which inhibits caveolin - dependent endocytosis , or concanavalin A , which inhibits clathrin - coated pit - mediated endocytosis , and together with or without latrunculin for 1 h . Cell plasma membrane UT - A1 accumulation was measured by biotinylation . In agreement with our previous study ( 15 ) , inhi - bition of either the caveolin or clathrin - mediated pathway increased UT - A1 membrane accumulation . Latrunculin treat - ment caused more UT - A1 accumulation in the cell membrane when either pathway was blocked ( Fig . 5 ) . This suggests that disruption of actin has broad inhibitory effects and reduces both the caveolin - and clathrin - mediated UT - A1 endocytosis . Actin regulates UT - A1 urea transport activity . Finally , we examined whether modulation of actin could directly regulate UT - A1 urea transport activity . Unfortunately , neither measur - ing urea transport activity by tubular perfusion of rat IMCDs ( 40 ) nor transepithelial ﬂux in UT - A1 - MDCK cells ( 12 ) was successful . Latrunculin treatment caused signiﬁcant tubular leakage and damaged MDCK cell barrier integrity . We then sought to use the oocyte expression system . Incubation of UT - A1 - injected oocytes with 0 . 2 (cid:6) M latrunculin for 24 h signiﬁcantly increased UT - A1 urea transport activity . Cytocha - lasin D , another inhibitor of actin polymerization ( 16 ) , also increased UT - A1 urea ﬂux activity ( Fig . 6 ) . Fig . 3 . Effect of actin remodeling on UT - A1 membrane expression . A : cell biotinylation experiment . UT - A1 - MDCK cells were grown in six - well plates to conﬂuence . They were then treated with jasplakinolide ( Jasp ; 0 . 1 (cid:6) M ) or latrun - culin B ( Latru ; 1 (cid:6) M ) for 1 h at37°C . After treatment , cells were processed for cell surface biotinylation . Total cell lysates or biotinylated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with UT - A1 antibody .

The well - organized actin network , particularly cortical ﬁlamentous actin beneath the apical membrane , plays a critical role in transporter protein membrane expression in polarized epithelial cells ( 16 ) . The major ﬁnding of this study is that actin directly interacts with the UT - A1 carboxyl terminus and that the cortical actin plays an important role in the regulation of UT - A1 cell membrane expression and bioactivity . Intact actin ﬁlaments are required for the vesicular trafﬁcking of some ion channels and transporter proteins to the membrane ( 6 , 17 , 21 , 22 ) and / or structurally anchoring the protein within the plasma membrane ( 21 ) . Inhibition of actin polymerization blocks sodium - glucose transporter 1 ( SGLT1 ) apical surface localization stimulated by 8 - bromo - cAMP and signiﬁcantly inhibits SGLT1 activity ( 17 ) . This indicates that intact actin ﬁlaments are neces - sary to translocate SGLT1 from cytosolic compartments to the plasma membrane ( 17 ) . cAMP / protein kinase A ( PKA ) induces CFTR - associated ion channel activity only in the presence of an organized actin cytoskeleton ( 31 ) . The vasopressin - stimulated Na (cid:5) channel ( ENaC ) activity is inhibited by disrupting the orga - nization of actin ﬁlaments ( 30 ) . However , other studies show that actin polymerization func - tions as a barrier for transporter protein trafﬁcking between the apical membrane and the intracellular compartments ( 21 , 28 ) . Fig . 4 . Effect of actin depolymerization on forskolin ( FSK ) - induced UT - A1 membrane trafﬁcking . A : cell biotinylation experiment .

The vesicles or the transporter mole - cules are held in place by the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( 28 ) and are therefore prevented from contacting the cell membrane and inserting into the cell surface . Thus , depolymerization of cortical F - actin is considered an important prerequisite for transporter protein membrane trafﬁcking and proper activity . AQP2 is another important transporter expressed in the IMCD . Vasopressin - stimulated apical sorting of AQP2 was associated with depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton ( 35 ) in the mammalian collecting duct and in the amphibian bladder ( 7 ) , indicating that actin ﬁlaments might retard the fusion pro - cesses . In rat collecting duct epithelium , the total F - actin content decreases by 20 – 30 % after stimulation with vasopres - sin ( 35 ) . Depolymerization of actin by latrunculin A has also been found to transiently promote neurotransmitter release in synapses ( 25 ) . Similar to the regulation of AQP2 by cAMP , UT - A1 is activated by stimulation of the cAMP pathway and activation of PKA ( 43 ) . Activation of PKA leads to a change in the F - actin cytoskeleton ( 35 ) . This change could cause the increase in UT - A1 membrane abundance and urea transport activity that is seen in the current study ( Figs . 4 and 6 ) . The amount of transporter protein in the cell plasma mem - brane is determined by both protein membrane trafﬁcking ( exocytosis ) and retrieval ( endocytosis ) . Clathrin - mediated en - docytosis is the major endocytic pathway of many mammalian cells . Evidence from a variety of cell types demonstrates that the actin cytoskeleton plays an essential and active role in many key endocytic stages ( 13 , 16 , 32 , 42 ) . Within 5 min , latrunculin causes the actin patch to disappear and endocytosis to be completely abrogated in yeast ( 32 ) . In the very early stage of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , actin accumulates at sites of endocytosis . Then , endocytic proteins and adaptors , like clath - rin , Sla1 , Sla2 , and End3 , are recruited to the actin patch , followed by regulators of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 11 , 32 ) . Actin is also required for the invagination during the late stages of endocytic vesicle movement ( 13 ) . Although cell membrane UT - A1 mainly resides in lipid raft subdomains , its endocytosis occurs through both caveolin - and clathrin - mediated endocytic pathways ( 15 ) . The current study shows that inhibition of either pathway by concanavalin A or M (cid:2) CD only partially inhibits UT - A1 endocytosis , which causes UT - A1 membrane accumulation . Latrunculin inhibits both clathrin - and caveolin - mediated UT - A1 endocytosis . The role of actin in the clathrin - mediated pathway has been well studied ( 11 , 16 , 42 ) , but the function of actin in the caveolin pathway is less explored . Our results show that actin may also be involved in UT - A1 endo - cytosis through the caveolin endocytic pathway . In support of this , both actin and UT - A1 are found localized in lipid raft domains in the cell membrane ( Fig . 2 B ) . In our study , treatment with jasplakinolide , which binds to and stabilizes actin ﬁlaments , does not alter UT - A1 membrane abundance . One of the possible explanations could be that the normal amount of F - actin on the apical side is enough to fulﬁll the cell’s function . An increase in actin ﬁlaments would have no additional effect . An elegant experiment by Apodaca et al . ( 1 ) showed that jasplakinolide treatment selectively stimulated basolateral endocytosis of the ﬂuid - phase marker FITC - dextran and horseradish peroxidase , whereas apical endocytosis of these markers was unaffected ( 1 ) . The reason is that most ﬁlamentous actin is on the apical side of polarized epithelial cells . Although much effort has been made , the consensus actin binding motif is still not certain . A potential motif for actin binding has been suggested as L / I - X - D / E - X - X - L / I ( where X (cid:11) any residue ) ( 2 , 39 ) . However , some actin binding proteins do not have this sequence . The mutation L1020A in Slo1 calcium - activated potassium channels caused a reduction in Slo1 bind - ing to (cid:2) - actin , but the D1022A and L1025A mutations exhib - ited only slightly reduced binding to actin ( 44 ) . The AQP2 COOH terminus does not contain typical actin binding motifs ( 28 ) . A conserved 14 - amino acid region ( E631 – F644 ) in the carboxyl terminus of (cid:1) ENaC has been shown to contribute speciﬁcally to actin’s modulation of ENaC ( 21 ) . In our study , we found that the amino acid residue S918 , probably together with I919 , in the UT - A1 COOH terminus mediates the actin binding . It is interesting to note that in most studies F - actin binds to the carboxyl terminus of the target proteins , such as (cid:1) - subunit of the ENaC ( 21 ) , AQP2 ( 28 ) , Slo1 channel ( 44 ) , as well as UT - A1 in the current study . In summary , actin concentrated at the apical cortex provides many functions in the apical domain of epithelial cells ( 16 ) . Here we found that by directly binding to UT - A1 , cortical actin regulates UT - A1 expression in the cell membrane by regulat - ing both endocytosis and membrane trafﬁcking . This may have important physiological signiﬁcance . Alteration of the actin cytoskeleton modulates UT - A1 activity . It has been shown that actin is also phosphorylated by PKA and that the phosphory - lation reduces the rate of actin polymerization ( 30 ) . Vasopres - sin depolymerizes apical F - actin in rat inner medullary collect - ing duct and increases water channel - carrying vesicle fusion with the apical membrane ( 35 ) . Taken together , we propose that the actin cytoskeleton , by changing its polymerization state , may play an important role in vasopressin - mediated UT - A1 activity in vivo by regulating UT - A1 endocytosis and trafﬁcking .
