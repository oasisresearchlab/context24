The extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK1 / 2 ) cascade is a MAP kinase pathway that transmits signals from the cell surface to substrates either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm . The transmission of the signal through the ERK1 / 2 cascade is mediated by serial phosphorylations and activations of protein kinases . Abnormal regulation of the ERK1 / 2 signals has been linked to diseases and recent work clearly implicated ERK1 / 2 signaling in the development of cardiac pathologies . Understanding the underlying mechanism and the consequences of the aberrant modulation of ERK1 / 2 cascade will lead to the development of pharmacologic inhibitors for the treatment of these cardiac disorders .

Introduction A proportion of inherited cardiomyopathies display deregulated MAP kinase signaling . As these diseases are a major cause of cardiac disease in human , it is therefore not surprising that the MAP kinase signaling continues to be the subject of intense researches for future pharmacological intervention . The development of molecules targeting this pathway has focused mostly on the development of small - molecule inhibitors . This review will gather information on MAP kinase signaling , focusing on the ERK1 / 2 branch and will discuss important research progresses in the field of inherited cardiomyopathies . The recent years provided some clues to explain the pathogenesis of such disease , involving ERK1 / 2 , which might open novel and promising perspectives for future clinical trials . MAP kinases Protein kinases are important players to achieve the integrated function of cells . Protein kinases are able to transfer phosphoryl groups onto target proteins , altering their activity [ 1 ] . This mechanism participates in the transmission of intra - and extracellular signals throughout the cell and to the nucleus . Thus , protein kinases play a pivotal role in signaling pathways that could regulate cell growth , differentiation , development , and death [ 2 ] . Hence , any disruption of the phosphorylation could alter cell functions and may cause diseases [ 3 ] . REVIEW Science Proceedings 2015 ; 2 : e457 . doi : 10 . 14800 / sp . 457 ; © 2015 by Maria Chatzifrangkeskou , et al . http : / / www . smartscitech . com / index . php / sp Page 2 of 4 The kinases are classified by the amino acids they phosphorylate [ 4 ] . The two main classes of kinases are tyrosine kinases , which phosphorylate tyrosine , and serine - threonine kinases , which phosphorylate serine or threonine [ 5 ] . Manning et al . have defined the human «kinome space » consisting of more than 500 protein kinase genes [ 6 ] . A growing number of diseases are caused by deregulation of the phosphorylation , and thus protein kinases are regarded as a promising therapeutic target for diseases . There is a family of protein kinase cascades known as mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases [ 7 , 8 ] , which belongs to serine - threonine kinases . It comprises MAP kinases , MAP kinase kinases ( MKKs ) and MAP kinase kinase kinases ( MKKKs ) [ 9 ] . MKKKs phosphorylate and activate MKKs , which in turn phosphorylate and activate MAP kinases . In all currently known MAP kinase cascades , the kinase immediately upstream of the MAP kinase is a member of the MAP / ERK kinase ( MEK ) family [ 10 - 13 ] , which are dual specificity enzymes that can phosphorylate serine / threonine and tyrosine residues . In spite of their ability to phosphorylate MAP kinases proteins , the substrate specificity of the known MEKs is very narrow : each MEK phosphorylates only one or a few of the MAP kinases . Much of the review highlights knowledge on extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 and ERK2 ) , two of the known MAP kinases . ERK1 / 2 ERK1 and ERK2 are ubiquitously expressed proteins of 44 and 42 kDa , which are nearly 85 % identical in their amino - acid sequences [ 14 - 17 ] . Stimulation of different receptors can activate ERK1 / 2 , e . g . receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , cytokine receptors and G - protein - coupled receptors . Hence , ERK1 / 2 are stimulated by many extracellular ligands and cellular perturbations ( e . g . , mechanical stress , osmotic shock ) , with some cell type specificity [ 7 ] . ERK1 and ERK2 are activated by closely related MEKs , MEK1 and MEK2 [ 10 , 18 - 21 ] . It has been assumed , from lack of evidence to the contrary , that MEK1 / 2 have no other substrates . This specificity of MEK1 / 2 has been used by several pharmacological companies to design potent inhibitors of ERK1 / 2 signaling [ 22 ] . A vast majority of the known MEK1 / 2 inhibitors are ATP non - competitive ( i . e . , they do not directly compete for the ATP binding site ) . These MEK1 / 2 inhibitors bind to a unique allosteric site adjacent to the ATP site , which explains their high specificity . Of all the known MEKKs , Raf isoforms are the only ones known to date , which phosphorylate MEK1 and MEK2 [ 23 - 27 ] . Stimulation of extracellular receptors by ligands results in the activation of the protein Ras , which can interact with several effectors , including Raf isoforms . ERK1 / 2 signaling requires the spatial and temporal organization of three different kinases , Raf , MEK1 / 2 and ERK1 / 2 . This is controlled by scaffold molecules [ 28 ] , among which some have been identified in cardiac tissue ( e . g . , β - arrestin , FHL1 , paxillin ) [ 29 ] . These scaffold molecules have important functions : i / they organize ERK1 / 2 for the efficient activation in the cascade ; and ii / they determine the output signal by localizing ERK1 / 2 to selected sites of action , ( e . g . , the transcription machinery , the actin cytoskeleton ) . Phosphorylation by ERK1 / 2 induces conformational change of the substrate , which thereby , either induces their activation , or regulates their association with other molecules [ 30 ] . To date , more than 150 substrates of ERK1 / 2 have been reported [ 31 ] , which can be categorized into several categories including : i / transcription factors , ii / protein kinases and phosphatases , iii / cytoskeletal proteins , iv / receptors , and vi / others . ERK1 / 2 can translocate to the nucleus where they are able to phosphorylate transcription factors to regulate their activities ( e . g . , c - Jun , c - Fos and ATF - 2 , Elk - 1 ) . Although many ERK1 / 2’s substrates are localized in the nucleus and are phosphorylated after ERKs’ nuclear translocation , the number of cytosolic ERK substrates is not much smaller . It has been described that several cytoskeletal element are targets for ERK1 / 2 ( e . g . , tubulin [ 32 ] , vimentin [ 33 ] or cortactin [ 34 ] ) . ERK1 / 2 and inherited cardiomyopathies Studies point to ERK1 / 2 as a maladaptive signaling pathway in cardiomyopathy . Cardiomyopathy is an anatomic and pathologic condition associated with muscle and electrical dysfunction of the heart , which may be confined to the heart or may be part of a generalized systemic disorder , often leading to heart failure - related disability . A well - known negative effect of ERK1 / 2 signaling in human heart function is highlighted by the fact that different mutations able to increase ERK1 / 2 pathway activation lead to cardiac pathologies in patients with Noonan and related syndromes , such as Costello , LEOPARD and cardio - facio - cutaneous syndromes [ 35 - 38 ] . Knock - in mice expressing a Noonan syndrome - associated mutation exhibit enhanced ERK1 / 2 signaling and an accelerated transition toward heart failure in response to pressure overload . Interestingly , postnatal treatment with MEK1 / 2 inhibition normalizes cardiac defects [ 39 ] . Based on these results , Novartis recently launched a clinical trial on Noonan syndrome using a MEK1 / 2 inhibitor ( ClinicalTrials . gov Identifier : NCT01556568 ) . A further example is represented by mutations in the A - type lamin gene and causing dilated cardiomyopathy . Since 1999 , scientists have unraveled the role of the nuclear lamina in the development of cardiac disease [ 40 ] . LMNA encodes Science Proceedings 2015 ; 2 : e457 . doi : 10 . 14800 / sp . 457 ; © 2015 by Maria Chatzifrangkeskou , et al . http : / / www . smartscitech . com / index . php / sp Page 3 of 4 nuclear A - type lamins via alternative splicing [ 41 ] . Lamins are intermediate filament proteins that polymerize to form the nuclear lamina , a fibrous meshwork underlining the inner nuclear membrane of most eukaryotic cells . We recently demonstrated an aberrant increase in ERK1 / 2 activity in hearts from a mouse model of the disease [ 42 ] . These results provide proof of principle for ERK1 / 2 inhibition as a therapeutic option to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure in LMNA cardiomyopathy . Pharmacological or genetic blockade of signaling in the ERK1 / 2 cascade in these mice improves left ventricular dilatation and deterioration in cardiac contractility [ 43 - 46 ] . Conclusion Less than a decade ago the kinases constituting MAP kinase pathways were identified through intense efforts to understand the molecular events underlying cellular responses to extracellular signals . The kinases constituting ERK1 / 2 pathways appear to be key cellular signal transducers and thus attractive targets for drug development . These efforts are now beginning to bear fruit with the initiation of clinical trials in human cardiac diseases . Their positive outcome would be a triumph of translating basic scientific understanding of cellular function into successful human therapies . Conflict of Interest Dr .
