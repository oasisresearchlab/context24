Functional differences across pyramidal neuron ( PyN ) types have been 16 observed within cortical areas , but it is not known whether these local differences extend 17 throughout the cortex , nor whether additional differences emerge when larger - scale dynamics are 18 considered . We used genetic and retrograde labeling to target pyramidal tract ( PT ) , 19 intratelencephalic ( IT ) and corticostriatal projection neurons and measured their cortex - wide 20 activity . Each PyN type drove unique neural dynamics , both at the local and cortex - wide scale . 21 Cortical activity and optogenetic inactivation during an auditory decision task also revealed 22 distinct functional roles : all PyNs in parietal cortex were recruited during perception of the 23 auditory stimulus , but , surprisingly , PT neurons had the largest causal role . In frontal cortex , all 24 PyNs were required for accurate choices but showed distinct choice - tuning . Our results reveal 25 that rich , cell - type - specific cortical dynamics shape perceptual decisions . 26 Introduction 27 The neocortex is organized into discrete layers that form a vertically - arranged microcircuit motif . 28 This core circuit is largely conserved across cortical areas with each layer consisting of distinct 29 excitatory and inhibitory cell types that can be categorized based on genetic markers , cell 30 morphology , anatomical projections or developmental lineage 1 . The precise interplay between 31 these cell types is crucial for accurate cortical circuit function and their respective functional 32 roles are the subject of intense study . Tremendous progress has been made particularly for 33 cortical interneurons , where the availability of specific mouse driver lines has revealed the 34 functional arrangement of inhibitory circuit motifs 2 – 4 , e . g . for network synchronization 5 – 7 and 35 state - dependent sensory processing 8 – 11 . However , the roles of glutamatergic pyramidal neuron 36 ( PyN ) types are less well established , although PyNs comprise ~ 80 % of all cortical neurons and 37 form almost all long - range projections that enable the communication between local cortical 38 circuits and other brain areas . 39 While often treated as a monolithic group , PyNs appear to be far more diverse than interneurons 40 with at least one hundred putative subtypes indicated by RNA sequencing 12 . These molecular 41 signatures are critical for categorizing PyNs and go far beyond layer identity as different 42 2 subtypes are often intermingled within the same layers 13 – 17 . PyNs can also be classified based on 43 their projection target . Long - range projection neurons are broadly categorized into two major 44 types : intratelencephalic ( IT ) neurons , projecting to other cortical structures and the striatum , and 45 pyramidal tract ( PT ) neurons , projecting to subcortical structures , such as the superior colliculus 46 ( SC ) , thalamus , the pons and the striatum . Furthermore , PT and IT neurons differ in their 47 electrophysiological properties , dendritic morphology , local connectivity , and responsiveness to 48 sensory stimulation 15 – 17 . Recent studies in sensory cortex also showed that only PT but not IT 49 neurons are important for active perception of tactile or visual stimuli , suggesting that PT and IT 50 neurons encode separate streams of information 18 , 19 . Similar results have been found in 51 secondary motor cortex ( M2 ) , where specific PT neurons are involved in motor generation 13 , 20 . 52 This suggests that the functional divergence of PyN types could be key for understanding cortical 53 microcircuits , with PT and IT neurons forming functionally - distinct , parallel subnetworks that 54 independently process different information . However , the functional tuning of individual PyNs 55 in frontal cortex is still best predicted by cortical area location instead of laminar location or 56 projection type 21 . Since PyN subtype activity has only been studied in single areas , it is therefore 57 not known whether PyN - specific subcircuits exist throughout the cortex or only in a subset of 58 cortical regions . 59 An ideal method to address this question is widefield calcium imaging , which allows measuring 60 neural activity across the dorsal cortex with cell - type specificity 22 – 24 . Interneuron - specific 61 widefield imaging revealed clear differences in the spatiotemporal dynamics of different 62 inhibitory cell types during an odor detection task 25 . However , cortex - wide studies of different 63 PyN types are lacking , in part due to the limited availability of PyN - specific driver lines 26 – 28 . 64 Here , we used two novel knock - in mouse driver lines targeting PT or IT neurons 26 and 65 performed widefield Ca 2 + imaging to measure PyN subtype - specific activity while animals 66 performed a perceptual decision - making task . Moreover , we developed a retrograde labeling 67 approach to selectively measure the activity of corticostriatal projection ( CStr ) neurons 68 throughout the dorsal cortex . Dimensionality - reduction and clustering analyses revealed unique 69 cortex - wide dynamics for each PyN subtype , suggesting the existence of specialized subcircuits . 70 Cortical dynamics of different PyNs were further segregated based on their role in decision - 71 making , with encoder and decoder approaches revealing the strongest stimulus - and choice - 72 related modulation in sensory , parietal and frontal cortices . This was confirmed by PyN - type - 73 specific inactivation experiments . In parietal cortex , PT neurons were most important for sensory 74 processing while all PyN types in frontal cortex were needed for choice formation and retention . 75 Taken together , our results demonstrate that different PyN - types exhibit functionally distinct , 76 cortex - wide neural dynamics with separate roles during perceptual decision - making . 77 Results 78 To monitor PyN - type specific neural activity throughout the dorsal cortex , we used two knock - in 79 inducible CreER lines that target developmentally - distinct classes of excitatory cortical neurons : 80 Fezf2 - CreER targeting PT neurons and PlexinD1 - CreER targeting IT neurons 26 . For PyN - type 81 specific GCaMP6s expression , both lines were crossed with the Ai162 reporter line 29 and CreER 82 activity was induced at four weeks of age . In each mouse line , GCaMP expression was restricted 83 to specific cortical layers and PyN types ( Fig 1a , b ) . In Fezf2 mice , expression was concentrated 84 in layer 5b ( Fig . 1a ) . We observed axonal projections to multiple subcortical regions , such as 85 striatum and the corticospinal tract , confirming that Fezf2 is a reliable marker for corticofugal PT 86 neurons . In PlexinD1 mice , GCaMP expression was restricted to layer 2 / 3 and layer 5a and 87 axonal projections were visible in the corpus callosum and the striatum ( Fig . 1b ) . These results 88 3 are in agreement with earlier reports 26 , confirming that PlexinD1 is a reliable marker for 89 intracortical and corticostriatal IT neurons . 90 After confirming non - overlapping expression patterns of PT and IT neurons , we measured cell - 91 type - specific cortical activity with widefield calcium imaging . All imaging data was aligned to 92 the Allen Common Coordinate Framework v3 ( CCF ) 25 , 30 to compare activity across individuals 93 and PyN types . Both lines yielded robust GCaMP - dependent fluorescence and we observed rich 94 neural dynamics throughout the dorsal cortex ( Supp . Movies 1 - 3 ) . We first used retinotopic 95 mapping to assess sensory responses of different PyN types and the resulting spatial arrangement 96 of visual areas . Both PT and IT neurons robustly responded to visual stimulation and we could 97 construct retinotopic maps that reliably indicated the location of known visual areas ( Fig . 1c ) 31 . 98 Retinotopic maps were similar to those observed in an Ai93D ; Emx - Cre ; LSL - tTA mouse line 99 ( EMX ) that expressed GCaMP6f in all excitatory cortical neurons 32 , suggesting that the 100 functional architecture of visual areas is comparable across PyN types . However , clear 101 differences were apparent in the modulation of cortical regions in the absence of visual 102 stimulation ( Fig . 1d , same individual mice as in 1c ) . For example , the total variance of cortex - 103 wide activity was largest in parietal and frontal regions in PT neurons ( Fig . 1d , left ) while 104 variance was highest in visual and somatosensory regions of IT neurons ( Fig . 1d , center ) . This 105 was comparable to variance in EMX mice , which showed additional modulation in retrosplenial 106 ( RS ) cortex ( Fig . 1d , right ) . These different patterns were also highly consistent across individual 107 mice of the same PyN type ( Supp . Fig . 1 ) . 108 109 Figure 1 . Knock - in mouse lines enable PyN subtype - specific recordings of cortex - wide neural activity . 110 a ) GCaMP6s expression in Fezf2 - CreER ; Ai162 mice . Cortical labeling is largely confined to layer 5b . Axonal 111 projections were found in multiple subcortical regions such as the striatum and the corticospinal tract . ( Scale bars : 112 100 µm ) . b ) GCaMP6s expression in PlexinD1 - CreER ; Ai162 mice is widespread throughout the cortex and 113 restricted to superficial layers 2 / 3 and layer 5a . Axonal projections were found in striatum and corpus callosum but 114 absent in the corticospinal tract . c ) Visual sign maps from retinotopic mapping experiments . IT and PT populations 115 showed clear retinotopic responses in primary and secondary visual areas where boundaries largely resembled 116 known areas that were also observed in nonspecific PyNs ( EMX mice ) . d ) Total variance maps from same mice as 117 in c ) , showing most modulated cortical regions in each PyN type . 118 The observed differences in variance could indicate general differences in the spatiotemporal 119 dynamics of cortex - wide activity across PyN types . To describe such differences , we performed 120 semi - nonnegative matrix factorization ( sNMF ) , reducing the imaging data to a small number of 121 spatial - and temporal components that capture nearly all variance ( > 99 % ) 23 , 33 . Here , 122 dimensionality ( the number of required components ) is a measure of the overall complexity of 123 cortical dynamics . Surprisingly , PT neurons had much lower dimensionality compared to IT 124 neurons ( Fig . 2a ) , suggesting that PT neurons are more functionally - homogeneous . This was also 125 4 seen in the correlations between cortical regions , which were consistently highest for PT neurons 126 ( Supp . Fig . 2 ) . A potential reason for this difference could be that IT neurons encompass a larger 127 number of specialized subtypes than PT neurons and may thus support a wider range of 128 functions 34 . 129 130 131 132 Figure 2 .

Conventions as in ( d ) . i ) Top : Peak normalized distributions of area size for 148 PyN - type - predictive ( blue ) versus unspecific ( red ) LocaNMF components . PyN - predictive components are smaller 149 than unspecific components ( PyN - predictive : median = 0 . 59 mm 2 , n = 6317 components , nonspecific : median = 150 0 . 68mm 2 , n = 18938 components ; ranksum test : p < 10 - 10 ) . Bottom : Examples of PyN - predictive ( I , II ) and 151 unspecific ( III ) components in right parietal cortex . 152 Since PT neurons are a subset of EMX neurons , their lower dimensionality could indicate that 153 PT components are also a subset of EMX components . We therefore quantified to which extent 154 components from different PyN types are linearly overlapping or independent from each other . 155 For each PyN type , we computed the amount of variance that could be explained with 156 components from other mice of either the same or different PyN type ( Supp . Fig . 3a ) . For all 157 groups , components from a similar PyN type explained significantly more variance ( ΔR 2 ) than 158 the maximal amount that could be explained by other types ( EMX , mean ΔR 2 = 3 . 3 % , t - test : p < 159 10 - 10 ; IT , mean ΔR 2 = 1 . 5 % , p < 10 - 10 ; PT , mean ΔR 2 = 1 . 2 % , p < 10 - 10 ) . Each group therefore 160 contains additional PyN - type - specific variance that is independent from other types . This was 161 also visible in reconstructed data : PT components captured larger fluctuations in IT activity 162 ( Supp . Movie 4 ) but failed to represent spatial details in the cortical activity patterns ( Supp . Fig . 163 3b ) . Despite the similar dimensionality of IT and EMX activity ( Fig . 2a ) , EMX ΔR 2 was also 164 similar for IT and PT components ( ΔR 2EMX - IT = 3 . 4 % , ΔR 2EMX - PT = 3 . 3 % , p = 0 . 1 ) , demonstrating 165 that EMX data was not largely dominated by either IT or PT neurons . 166 To directly compare spatial activity patterns , we then focused on spatial sNMF components . 167 Spatial components represent cortex - wide maps of positively correlated areas and we wondered 168 whether these correlation patterns would differ between PyN subtypes . Indeed , individual spatial 169 components from different mice of the same PyN subtype often strongly resembled each other 170 but differed from other PyN subtypes ( Fig . 2b ) . To assess if most spatial components ( or only a 171 small subset ) was PyN - type - specific , we performed a UMAP projection of the first 20 172 components from all recordings and PyN types , non - linearly embedding the pixels of each 173 component in a 2 - dimensional space ( Fig . 2c ) 35 . If neural activity in PT , IT and EMX mice 174 tended to exhibit similar correlation patterns , these spatial components would be mixed together . 175 Instead , in agreement with the notion that components of the same PyN type resembled each 176 other , we found that components formed clusters that were largely dominated by either PT or IT 177 neurons ( green / blue markers ) . EMX neurons formed a third set of non - overlapping clusters , 178 likely reflecting the combined cortical dynamics from diverse PyN types beyond PT and IT 179 neurons that were contained in this larger group ( red markers ) . A simple classifier reliably 180 identified each group , based on the nearest neighbors in a UMAP projection that was exclusively 181 based on data from other animals . Remarkably , prediction accuracy was high even when the 182 classification was based on just a single spatial component ( Fig . 2d ) . The presence of such clear 183 clusters is striking given that the spatial components used in the analysis were pooled over many 184 sessions and mice . This confirms that UMAP clusters reflect consistent PyN - type - specific 185 activity patterns , rather than idiosyncratic differences within individual sessions or mice . Taken 186 together , these results clearly demonstrate that PyN types differ in the complexity of cortical 187 dynamics , contain independent variance , and exhibit unique cortex - wide correlation patterns . 188 An important concern is that variations in the density of Cre expression in each mouse line could 189 result in non - uniform GCaMP expression patterns which might contribute to PyN - specific spatial 190 components . However , GCaMP - related fluorescence was largely uniform across cortex in all 191 mice and we observed no clear relationship between raw widefield fluorescence patterns and 192 PyN - specific spatial components ( Supp . Fig . 4a , b ) . Moreover , despite some fluctuations in the 193 density of Cre - expressing neurons across areas in both mouse lines , Cre - expression patterns did 194 not account for spatial components or specific differences between PyN types ( Supp . Fig . 4c , d ) . 195 6 Nevertheless , particularly distinct activity of each PyN type in specific cortical areas could lead 196 to cortex - wide correlation patterns that are either dominated by highly active areas or where 197 inactive areas are ‘missing’ . In this case , the relatively low dimensionality of PT neurons might 198 be due to a lower number of active cortical areas . We therefore used a localized form of sNMF 199 ( LocaNMF ) 33 which extracts components that are dense and spatially restricted to a specific 200 cortical “seed” region ( Fig . 2e ) . Analyzing LocaNMF components therefore allowed us to reveal 201 if PyN - specific differences mostly occur on a cortex - wide level ( reflecting the interactions 202 between cortical areas ) or further extend to the local level of individual cortical areas ( e . g . due to 203 PyN - specific differences in the shape and localization of cortical areas ) . 204 205 First , we again compared the number of components required to explain at least 99 % of the 206 variance in each PyN type . As expected , the number of components was greater than sNMF and , 207 interestingly , was also more similar across PyN subtypes ( Fig . 2f ) . This shows that PyN - type - 208 specific differences in cortex - wide correlation patterns are not due to a lack of activity in some 209 cortical areas ( which would have resulted in a lower number of required components , e . g . in PT 210 mice ) and instead result from PyN - type specific differences in the coordinated activation of 211 multi - area cortical networks . Moreover , as with sNMF components , LocaNMF components from 212 mice of the same PyN type explained more variance than components from other types ( Supp . 213 Fig . 3c ) . 214 215 Repeating the UMAP embedding for these local components also uncovered PyN - type - specific 216 clustering ( Fig . 2g ) , which could be used to accurately identify each PyN type ( Fig . 2h ) . 217 Classification accuracy was high across most cortical regions ( Supp . Fig . 4d ) . Specificity of 218 LocaNMF components could either be due to the presence of specific ‘subregions’ , where PyN 219 types are most active in smaller parts of a given cortical area , or larger ‘superregions’ , where the 220 activity of a specific PyN type extends across known area borders . We therefore compared the 221 size of LocaNMF components that accurately predicted their respective PyN type ( classifier 222 accuracy > 99 % ) versus nonspecific components . Interestingly , PyN - predictive clusters were 223 significantly smaller than nonspecific clusters ( Fig . 2i ) , suggesting that different PyNs might be 224 most active in distinct subregions instead of larger multi - area components . This indicates that 225 smaller , PyN - specific subregions may reside within the coarser , traditionally - defined cortical 226 areas . 227 We next assessed how cortical dynamics of PyN subpopulations are related to decision - making 228 by imaging PyN subtype activity in animals trained on an auditory decision - making task ( Fig . 229 3a ) 36 . Mice initiated trials by touching small handles , which triggered the simultaneous 230 presentation of sequences of clicking sounds to their left and right side . After a short delay 231 period , mice reported decisions by licking one of two water spouts and were rewarded for 232 choosing the side where more clicks were presented . To reduce temporal correlations between 233 task events , such as trial initiation and stimulus onset , the durations of the initiation , stimulus and 234 delay periods were randomly varied across trials . In all mice , decisions varied systematically 235 with stimulus strength ( Fig . 3b ) and were equally affected by click sounds throughout the 236 stimulus period ( Supp . Fig . 5 ) . 237 As with spatial components , trial - averaged temporal sNMF and LocaNMF components showed 238 pronounced clustering , suggesting that different PyN - types also exhibit distinct task - related 239 temporal dynamics ( Supp . Fig . 6 ) . Correspondingly , we found clear differences in trial - averaged 240 neural activity between PyN subtypes , especially during stimulus presentation ( Fig . 3c ) . Here , 241 cortical activity was uniformly suppressed in EMX mice , partially suppressed in somatosensory 242 and visual areas in IT mice , and uniformly increased in PT mice ( Fig . 3d ) . In all PyN types , 243 7 activity was largely symmetric across the left and right hemispheres , even when only analyzing 244 trials where stimuli were presented on the left side and the animal made a corresponding leftward 245 choice ( Fig . 3c ; Supp . Fig . 7 ) . Moreover , responses to sensory stimuli were much weaker than 246 movement - related responses , such as trial initiation or licking ( Fig . 3d , gray bar versus dashed 247 lines ) . A potential explanation is that lateralized , task - related activity is obscured by cortical 248 activity due to animal movements 32 , 37 – 39 . 249 250 251 Figure 3 . An auditory decision - making task reveals distinct functional activity patterns in each PyN type . 252 a ) Auditory discrimination task structure of an example trial . Mice touched paw handles to initiate randomized click 253 sequences on the left and / or right side . After a delay period , a lick response on the correct side was rewarded with 254 water .

Colors as in ( b ) . 261 Shading shows s . e . m . ; n = 4 EMX / IT mice and 5 PT mice . 262 To isolate task - related activity from movements we used a linear encoding model 32 . The model 263 combines many task - and movement - variables to predict single - trial fluctuations in cortical 264 activity ( Fig . 4a , top ) . Task variables were related to the learned behavior , and included past and 265 8 current choices , and the presentation of a sensory stimulus . Movement variables included licking 266 and touching the handles , alongside facial movements ( whisking or nose movements ) obtained 267 from two video cameras of the animal’s face and body ( a complete list of all task - and movement 268 variables is shown in Supp . Table 1 ) . All variables were combined into a single design matrix 269 and we used ridge regression to fit the model to the imaging data . This produced a time - varying 270 event kernel for each variable , allowing us to isolate how specific task variables ( e . g . the sensory 271 stimulus , Fig . 4a , bottom ) are related to neural activity while separating them from the impact of 272 other factors , such as licking movements , which are captured by other model variables . 273 To assess how well the model predicts cortical activity , we first computed the tenfold cross - 274 validated R 2 ( cvR 2 ) . For all PyN types , the model successfully captured a large fraction of single - 275 trial variance throughout the cortex ( Fig . 4b ) , confirming the validity of our approach . Predicted 276 variance was higher in IT and PT mice compared to EMX mice , with over 90 % explained 277 variance in frontal cortex of PT mice . Consistent with earlier results 32 , 37 , movements consistently 278 captured more variance than task variables across all PyNs ( Fig . 4c ) . The impact of movements 279 was also apparent when computing the unique contributions from movement or task variables by 280 removing either set of variables from the full model , demonstrating that movements are an 281 important driver of cortex - wide activity in all PyN types ( Supp . Fig . 8a ) . Interestingly , unique 282 contributions of many task variables were higher for IT , further indicating that they might be 283 more functionally diverse than PT neurons ( Supp . Fig . 8b ) . 284 285 Figure 4 . An encoding model uncovers task - specific differences across PyN types . 286 a ) Schematic of the encoding model . Top : Task - and movement - variables account for fluctuations in cortical 287 activity . Bottom : Weights for each variable define a spatiotemporal event kernel , revealing cortical activity in 288 response to a specific event ( example shows right stimulus kernel in EMX mice ) . b ) Average maps of cvR 2 . The 289 model accurately predicted cortical variance for all PyNs . c ) cvR 2 from two models , using only movement 290 ( ‘Movement’ ) or task variables ( ‘Task’ ) . In all groups , movements were more predictive than task variables and 291 accounted for the majority of the full models explained variance ( dashed lines ) . Circles denote sessions . d ) 292 Contributions of movements , stimulus and choice to the model’s total explained variance . Although movements 293 contributed the most , stimulus and choice also made sizable contributions . 294 To gain insight into the cortical dynamics related to stimulus and choice , we focused on their 295 respective event kernels learned by the model for each PyN type . To ensure that both task 296 variables still accounted for a sizable amount of the observed neural activity ( instead of all 297 variance being explained by movements ) , we first computed how much variance the stimulus 298 and choice kernels contribute to the full model compared to the sum of all movement variables 299 9 ( Fig . 4d ) . Here , although the combined movement variables made the largest contributions 300 ( ~ 60 % of the model’s total explained variance ) , both stimulus and choice also made sizable 301 contributions to the model ( 10 - 20 % explained variance in all PyN types ) . This demonstrates that 302 stimulus and choice remain important for understanding cortical activity patterns and can be 303 leveraged to selectively isolate task - related activity . 304 We then focused on cortical responses to the auditory stimulus . In contrast to trial averages of 305 ΔF / F ( Fig . 3c ) , the stimulus kernels in EMX mice uncovered clear sensory - locked and lateralized 306 responses in auditory , parietal and frontal cortex ( Fig . 4a , bottom ; Fig . 5a , top ) . Other areas , such 307 as somatosensory and visual cortex , were inhibited . Sensory - locked responses were also present 308 in auditory , parietal and frontal cortices of PT and IT mice ( Fig . 5a , center and bottom ) . 309 However , the cortex - wide response patterns were not identical : for instance , no inhibition was 310 apparent in PT mice . Sensory responses were particularly distinct in the parietal cortex ( Fig . 5b ) . 311 Responses in EMX and IT mice were more anterolateral in parietal area A while PT responses 312 were surprisingly prominent and more posteromedial at the border between area AM and RS . 313 314 Figure 5 . PyN - specific differences are evident in the location and specificity of cortical stimulus responses . 315 a ) Left : Response kernels for contralateral stimuli over all EMX ( red ) , IT ( green ) , and PT mice ( blue ) , averaged 316 between 0 and 200 ms .

Conventions as in ( a ) . d ) Magnified view on parietal regions of side - specific maps 321 in ( c ) . IT neurons show clear , side - specific responses that were weaker in EMX and absent for PT neurons . 322 PyN types also differed in their response dynamics following the sensory stimulus . While some 323 cortical areas , such as auditory cortex , preferentially responded to contralateral stimuli , PT 324 10 neurons in parietal cortex were activated bilaterally in response to ipsi - or contralateral stimuli . 325 To assess such side - specificity , we computed the difference between the contra - and ipsilateral 326 stimulus kernels ( Fig . 5c , colors indicate regions for which responses differed for contra - versus 327 ipsilateral stimulus kernels ) . In EMX mice , we found lateralized responses in auditory , frontal , 328 and to a lesser extent , parietal cortex ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Lateralized IT activity was found in auditory 329 and parietal but not frontal cortex . In contrast , PT mice showed clear side - specific responses in 330 auditory and frontal but not in parietal cortex . Such differences in unilateral versus bilateral 331 responses in PT and IT neurons may also reflect different functional roles , with unilateral 332 responses encoding the spatial location of sensory information and bilateral responses signaling 333 its importance for guiding subsequent decisions . 334 Having identified PyN - type dependent activity for sensory stimuli , we then examined choice - 335 dependent activity and again observed clear differences across PyN types . In EMX mice , a 336 number of regions showed choice - related activity , particularly in the frontal cortex , while 337 sensory and parietal regions were only weakly modulated ( Fig . 6a ) . We also found choice signals 338 in somatosensory areas of the whiskers and nose that slowly increased over the course of the 339 trial , even before the stimulus onset ( Supp . Fig . 9a ) . These signals could indicate that mice used 340 their whiskers to probe the location of the spouts or performed subtle , choice - predictive facial 341 movements throughout the trial 40 . In contrast , choice - specific activity in frontal cortex strongly 342 increased after stimulus onset and remained elevated as the decision progressed from sampling 343 the stimulus to the subsequent delay period ( Fig . 6a , yellow trace ) . We found equally prominent 344 choice signals in frontal cortex of PT mice while little choice - predictive activity was seen in IT 345 mice ( Fig . 6b , Supp . Fig . 9b , c ) . In EMX and PT mice , positive signals for contralateral choices 346 were concentrated in the medial part of secondary motor cortex ( M2 ) while parts of the primary 347 motor cortex ( M1 ) were inhibited . This could indicate accumulation of sensory evidence and 348 motor preparation in M2 , and inhibition in parts of M1 when early lick responses must be 349 witheld 41 . 350 Although the choice kernels revealed differences between PyN types , choice - related activity only 351 accounted for a small amount of the total neural variance ( Fig . 4d , Supp . Fig . 8 ) . Since the 352 encoding model is designed to capture as much variance as possible , we hypothesized that this 353 approach might miss subtle choice signals that are specific but low in magnitude . The linear 354 model’s ridge penalty also enforces choice - related variance to be distributed over all correlated 355 model variables , which might ‘diffuse’ weaker choice - related activity from the choice to other 356 model kernels . 357 To selectively isolate all choice - related activity , we therefore built a decoding model , using a 358 logistic regression choice classifier with L1 penalty ( see Methods ) . In contrast to the encoding 359 model , this decoder approach isolates the cortical signals that are best suited to predict the 360 animal’s choices , regardless of their magnitude . For all PyN types , the decoder predicted the 361 animal’s choices with high accuracy , confirming that cortical activity reliably reflects trial - by - 362 trial choices ( Supp . Fig . 10a ) . When analyzing the decoder weights , we found comparable 363 patterns to the encoding model’s choice kernels but with much clearer separation of cortical 364 areas ( compare top row ‘Delay’ in Fig . 6c to Fig . 6a , left ) . Here , positive decoder weights denote 365 areas that are most predictive for contralateral choices but , importantly , this does not suggest that 366 these areas are necessarily the most active . For all PyN types , we found significant choice signals 367 in multiple areas of the anterior cortex that evolved during decisions ( Fig . 6c , Supp . Figs . 10 , 368 11 ) . In EMX and PT mice ( top and bottom rows ) , large parts of M2 were again highly choice 369 predictive , including the anterior lateral motor cortex ( ALM ) and the medial motor cortex 370 ( MM ) 21 . M2 choice weights strongly increased immediately after stimulus onset and remained 371 elevated during the subsequent delay period ( Fig . 6c , d ) . Cortical choice signals also persisted 372 11 after removing movement - related activity from the data , suggesting that they are not explained 373 by choice - predictive animal movements but instead reflect the formation of sensory - driven 374 decisions in frontal cortex ( Supp . Fig . 12 ) . 375 376 Figure 6 . The temporal dynamics of choice - related activity differ across PyN types . 377 a ) Left : Averaged choice kernels for EMX mice during the delay period .

Dashed circle shows location of ALM . 386 12 Surprisingly , we also found a mild ipsilateral choice - preference for M2 in IT mice , despite strong 387 bilateral activation of frontal cortex during the delay period ( Fig . 3c ; Supp . Fig . 7 ) . This 388 ipsilateral choice signal evolved more slowly during the stimulus and delay period ( Fig . 6c , d ) 389 and was more spatially restricted to ALM ( Fig . 6e ) . In line with our previous results , no choice 390 signals were seen in parietal cortex of any PyN type ( Fig . 6d , left ) , suggesting that parietal cortex 391 is mostly involved in sensory processing instead of choice formation or motor execution 42 , 43 . 392 Compared to the encoding model , the decoding model recovered more finely structured choice 393 maps , especially in the frontal regions ( compare Fig . 6e to 6b ) , revealing strong contralateral 394 choice signals in PT and ipsilateral choice signals in IT mice . One possible cause of this 395 unexpected inversion may be different choice - selectivity of specific IT - subtypes : intracortical 396 versus corticostriatal ( CStr ) projection neurons . Earlier work suggested an even distribution of 397 ipsi - and contralateral choice selectivity in frontal intracortical projection neurons 20 , 21 , and we 398 thus hypothesized that our observed IT choice selectivity is due to the activity of CStr neurons . 399 To address this directly , we used an intersectional approach that exclusively labels large 400 populations of CStr neurons by performing multiple bilateral striatal injections of a retrograde 401 virus expressing Cre ( CAV2 - Cre ) in GCaMP6s reporter mice ( Fig . 7a ) , inducing widespread 402 expression in CStr neurons ( Fig . 7b ) . As expected , GCaMP6 expression in CStr neurons was 403 largely confined to layer 5 with sparse expression in deeper layers . 404 We then used widefield calcium imaging to selectively measure activity from CStr neurons . As 405 with PT and IT mice , we observed robust fluorescence signals throughout the dorsal cortex 406 ( Supp . Movie 5 ) and identified visual areas using retinotopic mapping ( Supp . Fig . 13a ) . sNMF 407 showed that the dimensionality of CStr mice was intermediate between PT and IT activity , and 408 that the spatial components did not strongly overlap with other PyN types ( Supp . Fig . 13b , c ) . 409 This clear difference between IT and CStr mice strongly suggests that imaging signals from IT 410 mice are not solely dominated by IT - positive CStr neurons but represent a mixture of 411 intracortical - and corticostriatal - projecting IT neurons with distinct activity patterns . 412 We then trained CStr mice in the auditory discrimination task . Trial - averaged dynamics partially 413 resembled IT mice , for example in frontal cortex , but also showed clear differences , such as a 414 lack of pre - stimulus suppression in sensory cortex ( Fig . 7c , d ; orange versus gray traces ) . 415 Differences between CStr and IT mice were also visible in the stimulus kernels from the 416 encoding model . In CStr mice , stimulus - related activity in parietal cortex was stronger than in 417 sensory and frontal cortex but the activated parietal regions were more medial than in IT mice 418 ( Fig . 7e ) . Interestingly , these stimulus - driven parietal regions ( Fig . 7f , top ) closely resembled 419 cortical areas that form anatomical and functional connections to the dorsomedial striatum 44 , 45 . 420 As with PT neurons ( Fig . 5b , d ) , parietal CStr responses equally responded to contra - and 421 ipsilateral stimulation ( Fig . 7f , bottom ) . 422 To determine whether CStr activity contributed to ipsilateral - preferring IT choice signals , we 423 repeated the choice decoder analysis . The decoder predicted animals’ choices with equally high 424 accuracy as for PT and IT mice ( Supp . Fig . 13d ) . We then extracted choice weights for each task 425 episode . Here , CStr activity was overall similar to that of IT mice , with an even stronger 426 ipsilateral - choice preference in frontal cortex that started after stimulus onset and lasted 427 throughout the delay and response periods ( Fig . 7g , right ) . As in IT mice , this inversion from 428 contra - to ipsilateral choice preference was prominent in area ALM but did not extend to MM , 429 strongly suggesting that ipsilateral choice preference is driven by IT - CStr neurons . 430 13 431 Figure 7 .

Top : A higher fraction of CStr neurons in ALM are ipsi - selective ( CStr Ipsi : 20 . 4 % , CStr Contra : 15 . 5 % , 454 binomial test : p = 0 . 0018 ) while unlabeled neurons are more contra - selective ( Unlabeled Ipsi : 14 . 3 % , Unlabeled Contra : 455 17 . 2 % , binomial test : p = 3 . 5x10 - 10 ) . Bottom : The majority of CStr as well as unlabeled neurons in MM are selective 456 for contralateral choices ( CStr Ipsi : 10 . 2 % , CStr Contra : 19 . 1 % , binomial test : p = 2 . 7x10 - 8 ; Unlabeled Ipsi : 9 . 3 % , 457 Unlabeled Contra : 19 . 6 % , binomial test : p < 1x10 - 10 ) . 458 14 To confirm these results on a single - cell level , we then used two - photon calcium imaging in 459 Camk2α - tTA ; G6s2 mice and labeled CStr neurons through striatal injections of a retrograde 460 adeno - associated virus ( AAVrg - tdTomato ) ( Fig . 7i ) . This allowed us to compare the activity of 461 all PyNs in frontal cortex with tdTomato - labeled CStr neurons in the same animal . Comparing 462 the choice - tuning of CStr and unlabeled PyNs revealed a specific difference in ipsi - versus 463 contralateral choice preference in ALM ( Fig . 7j ) . Here , significantly more choice - selective CStr 464 neurons preferred ipsilateral choices , whereas unlabeled PyNs were mildly contra - selective ( Fig . 465 7k ) . In agreement with our widefield results , these differences were only seen in ALM but not 466 MM . Interestingly , this ipsilateral choice preference was also restricted to superficial IT - CStr 467 neurons at a cortical depth between 200 - 400 µm . Infragranular CStr neurons ( 400 - 600 µm ) , 468 which are also often PT cells 17 , showed strong contralateral choice tuning that was similar to 469 unlabeled cells ( Supp . Fig . 14a ) . Lastly , we also tested if the neuropil exhibits distinct choice 470 signals that may have masked somatic activity in our PyN - specific widefield measures ( Supp . 471 Fig . 14b ) . In all regions and depths , neuropil choice tuning was largely similar to somatic activity 472 of unlabeled neurons , confirming that widefield measures indeed represented local somatic 473 activity . Here , IT - specific widefield signals matched the mixed choice - selectivity of superficial 474 layers , while PT - specific imaging was well - aligned with the clear contralateral choice tuning in 475 deeper cortical layers . 476 The observed differences between PyN types suggest that each type may drive distinct aspects of 477 decision - making . To causally test the functional role of different PyN types , we performed PyN - 478 specific optogenetic inactivation in different cortical areas . We induced Cre - dependent 479 expression of the inhibitory opsin stGtACR2 46 by injecting an AAV in the parietal and frontal 480 cortex of Fezf2 - , PlexinD1 - , or EMX - Cre mice ( Fig . 8a , b , Supp . Table 2 ) . To express stGtACR2 481 in CStr neurons , we used a combined viral receptor complementation and intersectional approach 482 to maximize the efficiency of retrograde expression 47 . First , we simultaneously expressed the 483 coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor ( CAR ) and transduced Cre - dependent stGtACR2 in 484 cortical neurons . Two weeks later , we performed retrograde - mediated stGtACR2 expression 485 through striatal CAV2 - Cre injections . CAR mediates efficient axonal uptake of CAV2 and 486 prevents potential viral tropism in subsets of CStr neurons . The coordinates of auditory , parietal , 487 and frontal injections and subsequent inactivation were determined from our stimulus and choice 488 analyses ( Fig . 5a , 6a ; dashed circles ) . To test whether optogenetic effects are area - specific , we 489 also targeted the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) in a subset of EMX mice as controls . To simplify the 490 behavioral task during the optogenetic inactivation experiments , we only presented unilateral 491 stimuli in each trial and kept the stimulus duration and delay periods constant ( 1 and 0 . 5 seconds , 492 respectively ) . 493 In agreement with our imaging results , bilateral optogenetic inactivation of auditory , parietal or 494 frontal cortex of EMX mice strongly impaired auditory decision accuracy ( Fig . 8c ) . Performance 495 was unaffected by V1 inactivation , confirming that these areas are selectively required for 496 auditory decisions . We then illuminated each area for 0 . 5 seconds during four different task 497 episodes : Early and late stimulus ( the first and last 0 . 5 seconds of the stimulus period ) , delay and 498 response ( Fig . 8d ) . In agreement with our observation that auditory and parietal cortex reflects 499 stimulus driven activity ( Fig . 5a , red and blue traces ) , inactivation of either area strongly reduced 500 animal’s performance , particularly during the stimulus period ( Fig . 8e , f ) . Behavioral 501 impairments ( computed as the normalized difference between performance in non - optogenetic 502 trials and chance ) were weaker during the subsequent trial periods , indicating that these areas are 503 most important for early processing of auditory stimuli . As expected , impairments were strongest 504 in EMX mice where all PyNs were affected ( gray trace ) . 505 15 In agreement with earlier work 48 , inhibiting CStr neurons in A1 also affected auditory decisions 506 ( Fig . 8e , orange trace ) . However , the effects were more transient and weaker compared to 507 inactivation of EMX neurons , suggesting that CStr neurons were not exclusively required for 508 accurate task performance . This was even more evident in parietal cortex where impairments 509 were surprisingly weak when inhibiting either IT or CStr neurons ( Fig . 8f , green / orange traces ) 510 while inactivating PT neurons resulted in a more robust impairment ( blue trace ) . This suggests 511 that the subcortical PT projection pathways in the parietal cortex have a larger causal impact on 512 sensory processing than intracortical IT or CStr projections , pointing to a role for PT neurons 513 that extends beyond preparation and execution of movements . 514 515 Figure 8 .

Conventions 530 as in f ) . Stars in all panels indicate significance ( bonferroni - corrected p < 0 . 01 , binomial test ) . 531 Frontal inactivation resulted in a particularly strong impairment , especially for nonspecific PyN 532 inactivation ( EMX mice , Fig . 8g , gray trace ) , consistent with a role for frontal cortex in sensory 533 integration and working memory 20 , 43 , 49 . IT and CStr inactivation resulted in comparable 534 behavioral impairments during the stimulus and delay periods ( Fig . 8g , green and orange traces ) . 535 Choice impairments in IT mice are therefore not solely due to the disruption of intracortical 536 processing 20 but also involve alterations of CStr neurons . Inactivating PT neurons equally 537 impaired animal performance during the stimulus and delay period but showed stronger effects 538 during the final response period . Impairments in the response period were similar for EMX and 539 16 PT mice , suggesting that PT neurons are particularly involved in licking responses . These results 540 show that multiple PyN types in frontal cortex are involved in the formation and maintenance of 541 choices , despite clear differences in their respective choice tuning . Lastly , we also analyzed 542 licking patterns to test if optogenetic inhibition broadly disrupted animal movements . Frontal 543 inactivation in the delay period had a mild effect on response latency but did not affect response 544 probability or licking patterns , arguing against a strong motor impairment ( Supp . Fig . 15 ) . This 545 shows that PyN - specific inhibition selectively reduced the animals’ response accuracy rather 546 than broadly disrupting their ability for movement initiation and execution . 547 Discussion 548 We measured and manipulated PyN subtypes to determine whether they play distinct roles in 549 decision - making . Cortex - wide activity patterns were PyN subtype - specific , each reflecting 550 distinct neural dynamics at multiple spatial scales . Functional specificity across PyN subtypes 551 was also evident during auditory decision - making : activity of each PyN subtype exhibited unique 552 cortical localization and spatial specificity associated with stimulus and choice . These response 553 patterns were not seen when imaging from PyNs nonspecifically . Optogenetic inactivation 554 confirmed that PyN types in parietal and frontal cortex have distinct functional roles , 555 highlighting the importance of subcortical projection pathways for sensory processing and choice 556 formation . Taken together , our results suggest that different PyN types form parallel subnetworks 557 throughout the cortex , are functionally - distinct , and perform separate roles during auditory 558 decision - making . 559 Dimensionality reduction of cortical dynamics 33 , 50 , 51 revealed that nearly all spatial components 560 were also PyN - subtype - specific . Differences between PyNs are therefore not only present within 561 parcellated cortical regions 18 – 20 but also evident in large - scale activity patterns . This has 562 important implications for studies of cortex - wide neural dynamics , which are often based on 563 indirect measures of neural activity 52 , 53 or pooled activity from all PyNs 22 , 25 , 54 , 55 . Earlier work 564 revealed intricate circuit motifs and functional modules that span the entire cortex 50 , 54 – 57 and 565 largely follow intracortical connectivity patterns 58 , 59 . Our results point to the existence of 566 additional circuit motifs when specific PyN population are isolated , especially subcortical 567 projection types , such as PT or CStr neurons . Furthermore , most PyN - specific LocaNMF 568 components consisted of spatially precise subregions that were smaller than Allen CCF areas . 569 Detailed analysis of PyN - specific activity might therefore reveal more detailed cortical structures 570 than could be observed with nonspecific measures . For future studies , a particularly promising 571 approach to achieve this goal would be to combine large - scale measures of multiple PyN types 572 with multi - color widefield imaging 24 , 60 and directly observe interactions between PyN - specific 573 cortical dynamics within the same animal . 574 Sensory responses were pronounced in auditory , parietal and frontal cortices 42 , 43 , 61 , 62 and 575 revealed unique response patterns for each PyN type . This functional segregation is in line with 576 recent results from primary sensory areas , such as somatosensory 18 , 63 and visual cortex 19 , and 577 strongly suggests that different PyN types play separate roles during sensory processing . 578 Moreover , the clear differences in magnitude , localization , and lateralization of sensory 579 responses in parietal and frontal cortex demonstrate that the functional specialization of different 580 PyN subtypes is a general feature of cortical circuit function . 581 We selectively inactivated different PyN types across cortical areas to directly test their 582 involvement in the behavioral task . In agreement with earlier work , inhibiting CStr neurons in 583 auditory cortex impaired task performance 48 , suggesting that projections from cortex to striatum 584 are important for accurate auditory decisions . Moreover , inactivation of parietal cortex also 585 17 caused strong behavioral impairments , especially during sensory stimulation . Surprisingly , 586 inactivation of CStr or IT neurons caused only weak behavioral effects . This shows that the 587 importance of CStr projections does not generalize from auditory to parietal cortex and also 588 argues against models in which task - relevant sensory information is directly transmitted from 589 parietal to frontal cortex to promote decision formation 42 , 62 , 64 . Instead , inactivation of parietal PT 590 neurons during the stimulus presentation strongly disrupted eventual decisions , highlighting the 591 importance of subcortical projection pathways for auditory performance . A likely subcortical 592 target is the SC , which receives inputs from PT neurons 18 , 26 and has been implicated with 593 somatosensory 18 and visual 65 , 66 perception , and decision - making 39 , 67 , 68 . 594 The strong behavioral effects with inactivation of parietal cortex are at odds with earlier studies 595 in rats that showed very little or no impact of parietal inactivation in auditory task 596 performance 69 , 70 . Conversely , other work in head - fixed mice had found robust behavioral effects 597 in visual 43 , 71 – 73 and auditory 62 task performance . While a potential reason for these contradictory 598 results could be species differences between rats and mice , the precise location of parietal 599 inactivation most likely plays an important role . Different sensory modalities are processed along 600 a mediolateral gradient in parietal cortex , emphasizing the need to precisely target specific 601 parietal areas to obtain a modality - specific behavioral effect 62 . We also found that parietal 602 responses of PT and CStr neurons were located more medially than IT neurons , further 603 emphasizing the need for precise localization . Another important factor is the specific behavioral 604 task . Our task design required accumulation of sensory evidence and working memory which 605 engage a wider range of cortical regions 72 and might therefore explain the involvement of 606 parietal cortex for accurate auditory decisions . 607 The accumulation and memory requirements of the decisions we studied might also explain why 608 we found clear cortical choice signals , especially in frontal cortex , whereas recent cortex - wide 609 studies reported little choice - selectivity 39 , 74 . The lack of side - specific choice tuning in IT 610 population data is consistent with earlier work , showing that intracortical projection neurons in 611 frontal cortex include an equal amount of contra - and ipsilateral choice - preferring cells 20 , 21 . In 612 contrast to other PyNs , CStr neurons were more selective for ipsilateral choices . Using two - 613 photon imaging , we confirmed that this ipsilateral choice preference was also present in 614 individual CStr neurons but not in unlabeled IT neurons . This confirms that our PyN - specific 615 widefield results indeed reflect selective somatic activity and not just superficial neuropil signals , 616 in line with earlier findings that widefield signals are strongly correlated to spiking of cortical 617 neurons 44 . Ipsilateral choice signals in CStr neurons were restricted to superficial layers of area 618 ALM , which is mostly implicated in movement generation 13 , 49 . A recent study showed that CStr 619 projections from the anterior cingulate cortex can inhibit striatal activity and motor behavior 75 . A 620 potential reason for the reduced activity of CStr neurons during the response period could 621 therefore be to disinhibit striatal circuits and release a targeted licking response . 622 In agreement with our imaging results , frontal inactivation strongly impaired animal behavior 623 during the stimulus and delay period , suggesting an important role for the translation of sensory 624 inputs into behavior 21 , 74 , 76 – 78 . Impairments were largely similar for all frontal PyN types , which 625 appear to be equally required for choice formation and retention . Frontal PyNs may thus be more 626 reliant on each other to maintain accurate function than in sensory areas 18 , 19 , 48 . As the only 627 exception , PT neurons were more important during the response period , consistent with a 628 specific role of brainstem - projecting PT neurons for motor execution 13 . 629 Our work offers a new perspective on cortex - wide dynamics by viewing them through the lens of 630 different PyN types and strongly supports the view that cortical circuits perform parallel 631 computations , even within the same cortical layer 13 , 18 , 19 , 79 . Future work to reveal the circuit logic 632 18 of cortex - wide activity patterns in different behavioral contexts should therefore include PyN 633 type information to resolve the functional heterogeneity that is often encountered when studying 634 cortical decision circuits . A powerful tool to achieve this goal are novel mouse lines , such as our 635 temporally inducible knock - in lines that allowed us to reliably target PT and IT neurons with 636 high specificity . These new mouse lines also overcome several known problems of earlier 637 transgenic approaches , unstable expression patterns across cortical areas or mixtures of cell types 638 due to interactions with surrounding genetic elements 26 , 80 . Future studies could explore PyN type 639 function at even higher granularity by using more specific mouse lines , such as the Cux1 - line to 640 selectively isolates intracortical projection neurons 26 . Moreover , combining genetic mouse lines 641 with retrograde labeling will enable the targeting of specific PyN subtypes , such as projection - 642 specific PT neurons 12 , 13 , that might serve a large array of functions from sensory processing , to 643 working memory and motor function 13 , 18 . 644 Acknowledgements 645 We thank Z .

EMX mice , used for calcium 667 imaging , were bred as Ai93D ; Emx - Cre ; LSL - tTA . To avoid potential aberrant cortical activity 668 patterns , EMX mice were on a doxycycline - containing diet ( DOX ) , preventing GCaMP6s 669 expression until they were 6 weeks or older 22 , 25 . 670 For widefield imaging of PT and IT neurons , inducible knock - in drivers Fezf2 - 2A - CreER and 671 PlexinD1 - 2A - CreER ( Supp . Table 2 ) , respectively , were crossed with Ai162 reporter mice to drive 672 cortex - wide GCaMP6s expression . Cre activity was induced through two doses of intra - peritoneal 673 injections of tamoxifen ( 200 mg / kg ; 20 mg / ml solution dissolved in corn oil ) at P28 and P32 . 674 Histologic characterization revealed pyramidal neuron expression patterns consistent with prior 675 reports 26 . For widefield imaging of corticostriatal neurons , we first crossed Ai162 with G6s2 to 676 19 create a new double - transgenic reporter strain Ai162 ; G6s2 with two hemizygous copies of 677 GCaMP6s under tetO control . Since LSL - tTA is incorporated in - tandem to the reporter gene in 678 the Ai162 strain 29 , this hybrid reporter line permits Cre - dependent expression of GCaMP6s at 679 higher levels than Ai162 hemizygotes while avoiding potential leaky reporter gene expression that 680 is sometimes found in Ai162 homozygotes . Next , to achieve widespread GCaMP6s expression in 681 corticostriatal neurons , we performed striatal injections of retrograde virus ( CAV2 - Cre ) in the 682 hybrid Ai162 ; G6s2 reporter line ( see section : viral injections ) . 683 For two - photon imaging experiments , GCaMP6s expression in pyramidal neurons were generated 684 using the hybrid strain Camk2α - tTA ; G6s2 . 685 General surgical procedures 686 All surgeries were performed under 1 - 2 % isoflurane in oxygen anesthesia . After induction of 687 anesthesia , 1 . 2 mg / kg of meloxicam was injected subcutaneously and sterile lidocaine ointment 688 was applied topically to the skin incision site . After making a midline cranial incision , the skin 689 was retracted laterally and fixed in position with tissue adhesive ( Vetbond , 3M ) . We then built an 690 outer wall using dental cement ( C & B Metabond , Parkell ; Ortho - Jet , Lang Dental ) along the lateral 691 edge of the dorsal cranium ( frontal and parietal bones ) to maximize the area of exposed skull . A 692 custom titanium skull post was then attached to the dental cement . For skull clearing , debris and 693 periosteum were thoroughly cleaned from the skull followed by the application of a thin layer of 694 cyanoacrylate ( Zap - A - Gap CA + , Pacer technology ) . 695 To prepare mice for two - photon imaging , a circular craniotomy ( ø = 3 mm ) centered over the right 696 frontal cortex ( 1 . 75 mm lateral to midline and 1 . 75 mm rostral to bregma ) , was made using a 697 biopsy punch . A circular coverslip ( ø = 3 mm ) was then lowered to the surface of the brain and 698 Vetbond and Metabond were used to seal the window to the skull . Lastly , a titanium skull post 699 was implanted as described above . 700 Viral injections 701 After induction with isoflurane anesthesia , animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame ( David Kopf 702 Instruments ) . The skull was leveled along the rostral - caudal and medio - lateral axis , allowing for 703 accurate and reproducible targeting . All injections were made using a programmable nanoliter 704 injector ( Nanoject III , Drummond Scientific , PA ) . For widefield imaging of CStr mice , widespread 705 corticostriatal GCaMP6s expression was generated in Ai162 ; G6s2 reporter mice by performing 706 bilateral stereotaxic injections of CAV - 2 - Cre ( at 3 - 4 weeks of age ) into the dorsal striatum at three 707 targets per hemisphere spanning the rostro - caudal axis . The target coordinates ( relative to bregma 708 and dura , in mm ) are ( 1 ) RC + 0 . 75 , ML ±1 . 8 , DV 3 . 0 ; ( 2 ) RC 0 , ML ±2 . 2 , DV 3 . 1 ; ( 3 ) RC - 0 . 75 , 709 ML ±2 . 9 , DV 3 . 1 . For each striatal target , a burr hole was created using a small dental burr 710 followed by injection of 1 . 8×109 purified particles ( pp ) of CAV - 2 - Cre using pipettes with long 711 taper tips pulled from borosilicate capillaries ( 3 . 5” Drummond # 3 - 000 - 203 - G / X , Drummond 712 Scientific , PA ) . For two - photon imaging experiments , CStr neurons were labeled through striatal 713 injections of AAV - 2 - retro - CAG - tdTomato ( using the same approach and coordinates as described 714 above ) in Camk2α - tTA ; G6s2 mice . 715 For cell type - specific optogenetic silencing experiments , we performed bilateral injections in 716 frontal , parietal , and auditory cortex ( coordinates relative to bregma , in mm : frontal cortex : RC 717 + 2 . 5 , ML ±1 . 5 ; parietal cortices : RC - 1 . 7 , ML ±2 . 5 ; auditory cortex : RC - 2 . 5 , ML ±4 . 6 ) to 718 induce expression of Cre - dependent stGtACR2 ( AAV1 - hSyn - SIO - stGtACR2 - FusionRed , Upenn 719 Vector Core , Supp . Table 2 ) . Cortical injections were performed in P42 to P56 Fezf2 - 2A - CreER 720 20 ( PT ) , PlexinD1 - 2A - CreER ( IT ) , and EMX - Cre ( nonspecific PyNs ) reporter mice . In mice with 721 ligand - dependent Cre recombinase activity , intraperitoneal tamoxifen was administered one 722 week after viral injections . Injections were made at two depths ( 300 and 600 µm ) per cortical 723 target . In two EMX - Cre mice , bilateral injections were performed in the frontal and visual cortex 724 ( RC - 4 , ML ±2 . 5 ) . To express stGtACR2 in CStr neurons , viral injections were performed in 725 C57BL / 6J mice in two stages . In stage one , we utilized a viral receptor complementation 726 strategy 47 by injecting both AAV - DJ - hSYN - DIO - hCAR { off } and AAV1 - SIO - hSyn1 - 727 stGtACR2 - FusionRed in different cortical locations ( targets as described above ) in P21 - P28 728 mice . In stage two , we performed bilateral striatal CAV - 2 - Cre injections 6 weeks after the initial 729 cortical injections ( see above ) . hCAR is expressed in all transfected neurons in a Cre - OFF 730 manner , meaning that Cre expression stops expression of hCAR while inducing expression of 731 stGtACR2 . 732 Optical fiber implantation 733 For optogenetic silencing , we expressed the soma - targeted anion - conducting channelrhodopsin 734 stGtACR2 in target neuronal populations 46 . Optical fibers ( NA = 0 . 36 , ø = 0 . 4mm , FT400UMT , 735 Thorlabs ) were glued into metal or ceramic ferrules ( ø = 1 . 25 mm , Thorlabs ) and secured above 736 the cortex following viral injections at each target . Ferrule - enclosed optical fiber implantations 737 immediately followed cortical AAV injections in Fezf2 , PlexinD1 , and Emx mice and striatal 738 CAV - 2 - Cre injections in CStr mice . One polished end of the optical fiber was positioned extradural 739 to the site of cortical injections and interfaced with thinned skull using cyanoacrylate . Next , the 740 fiber was fixed to the skull using light - cured glass ionomer ( Vitrebond , 3M ) . Additional layers of 741 dental cement and dental acrylic ( Lang Dental Jet Repair Acrylic ; Part # 1223MEH ) were applied 742 around the fiber implant and the skull to reinforce for durability and long - term stability . After all 743 layers were cured , a final outer coating of cyanoacrylate and nail polish were applied . 744 Behavioral training 745 The behavioral setup was controlled with a microcontroller - based ( Arduino Due ) finite state 746 machine ( Bpod r0 . 5 , Sanworks ) using custom Matlab code ( 2015b , Mathworks ) running on a 747 Linux PC . Servo motors ( Turnigy TGY - 306G - HV ) and touch sensors were controlled by 748 microcontrollers ( Teensy 3 . 2 , PJRC ) running custom code . Fifty - four mice were trained on a 749 delayed , spatial discrimination task . Mice initiated trials by placing their forepaws on at least one 750 of the two handles , which were mounted on servo motors that rotated out of reach during the inter - 751 trial period . Upon trial initiation , animals placed their forepaws on the handles and , after a variable 752 duration of 0 . 25 - 0 . 75 seconds of continuous contact , the auditory stimulus was presented . Auditory 753 stimuli consisted of a sequence of Poisson - distributed , 3 - ms long auditory click sounds 36 , 754 presented from either a left and / or right speaker for a variable duration between 1 and 1 . 5 seconds . 755 The stimulus period was followed by a variable delay of up to 1 second , then the servo motors 756 moved two lick spouts into close proximity of the animal’s mouth . If the animal licked twice on 757 the side where more clicks were presented , a drop of water reward was dispensed . The amount of 758 water rewarded per trial ( typically 1 . 5 to 3 µl ) was constant within a single session but was 759 sometimes adjusted daily based on the animal’s body weight . After one spout has been licked 760 twice , the contralateral spout moved out of reach to force the animal to commit to its decision . 761 All trained mice were housed in groups of two or more under reverse light cycle ( 12 - hour dark 762 and 12 - hour light ) and trained during their active dark cycle . Animals were trained over the course 763 of approximately 30 - 60 days . After 2 - 3 days of restricted water access , animals began habituation 764 to head fixation and received water from spouts in the behavior chamber . During these sessions , 765 unilateral auditory stimuli were presented followed by a droplet of water dispensed freely from the 766 21 ipsilateral water spout . After several habituation sessions , animals were then required to touch the 767 handles to trigger stimulus presentation . Once mice could reliably reach for the handles , the 768 required touch duration was progressively increased up to 0 . 75 seconds . During the next stage of 769 training , self - performed trials , where both spouts moved within reach of the animal following 770 stimulus presentation , were progressively introduced . An animal was considered trained when its 771 detection performance across two or more sessions was above 80 % . 772 Behavioral monitoring 773 Data was collected from multiple sensors in the behavioral setup to measure different aspects of 774 animal movement . Touch sensors using a grounding circuit on handles and lick spouts detected 775 contact with the animal’s forepaws and tongue , respectively . A piezo sensor ( 1740 , Adafruit LLC ) 776 below the animal’s trunk was used for monitoring body and hindlimb movements . Two webcams 777 ( C920 and B920 , Logitech ) were used for video recording of animal movements . Cameras were 778 positioned to capture the animal’s face ( side view ) and the ventral surface of the body ( ventral 779 view ) . 780 Widefield imaging 781 Widefield imaging was done as reported previously 23 , 32 , 81 using an inverted tandem - lens 782 macroscope in combination with an sCMOS camera ( Edge 5 . 5 , PCO ) running at 30 fps . The top 783 lens had a focal length of 105 mm ( DC - Nikkor , Nikon ) and the bottom lens 85 mm ( 85M - S , 784 Rokinon ) . The field of view was 12 . 5 x 10 . 5 mm 2 and the imaging resolution was 640 x 540 pixels 785 after 4x spatial binning , resulting in a spatial resolution of ~ 20 μm per pixel . To capture GCaMP 786 fluorescence , a 525 nm band - pass filter ( # 86 - 963 , Edmund optics ) was placed in front of the 787 camera . Using excitation light at two different wavelengths , we isolated Ca 2 + - dependent 788 fluorescence and corrected for intrinsic signals ( e . g . , hemodynamic responses ) 22 , 25 . Excitation light 789 was projected on the cortical surface using a 495 nm long - pass dichroic mirror ( T495lpxr , Chroma ) 790 placed between the two macro lenses . The excitation light was generated by a collimated blue LED 791 ( 470 nm , M470L3 , Thorlabs ) and a collimated violet LED ( 405 nm , M405L3 , Thorlabs ) that were 792 coupled into the same excitation path using a dichroic mirror ( # 87 - 063 , Edmund optics ) . We 793 alternated illumination between the two LEDs from frame to frame , resulting in one set of frames 794 with blue and the other with violet excitation at 15 fps each . Excitation of GCaMP at 405 nm 795 results in non - calcium dependent fluorescence 82 , allowing us to isolate the true calcium - dependent 796 signal by rescaling and subtracting frames with violet illumination from the preceding frames with 797 blue illumination . All subsequent analysis was based on this differential signal . The imaging data 798 was then rigidly aligned to the Allen common coordinate framework ( CCF ) , using four anatomical 799 landmarks : the left , center and right points where anterior cortex meets the olfactory bulbs , and 800 the medial point at the base of retrosplenial cortex . Retinotopic visual mapping experiments 31 , 83 801 confirmed accurate CCF alignment and showed high correspondence between functionally 802 identified visual areas and the CCF across PyN types ( Fig . 1c ) . 803 Two - photon imaging 804 We used a two - photon resonant scanning microscope ( Moveable Objective Microscope , Sutter 805 Instruments ) for session - long , continuous image acquisition at 30 . 9 Hz . A 16X , 0 . 8 NA Nikon 806 objective lens was used for single - plane imaging with a 512x512 pixels ( 575 µm x 575 µm ) fields 807 of view . Mode - locked illumination at 930 nm was delivered using a Ti : Sapphire laser ( Ultra II , 808 Coherent ) . Imaging frames were aligned with behavior control events synchronized acquisition of 809 analog galvanometric and Bpod output signals . Depth of focal planes was 200 - 400 µm below the 810 dura . Emission was collected using band - pass red ( 670 / 50 nm ) and green ( 525 / 50 nm ) filters 811 22 ( Chroma Technologies ) . MScan software ( Sutter Instruments ) was used for image acquisition . 812 Recordings were performed in ALM ( 2 . 5 mm rostra and 1 . 5 mm lateral to bregma ) or MM ( 1 . 5 813 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral to bregma ) in randomized order across mice . Across imaging 814 session , we selected planes that differed from those of prior sessions in order to maximize the 815 number of unique neurons by . 816 Raw images were processed using the Suite2P package 84 which performed motion correction , 817 model - based ROI detection , correction for neuropil contamination , and spike deconvolution . 818 Somatic and non - somatic ( neuropil ) ROI identification was performed through a combination of 819 pre - trained classifier and manual curation . Somata with tdTomato expression were identified in a 820 two - step process . First , potential green channel bleed - through was subtracted from the red channel 821 using non - rigid regression with individual channels being divided into smaller blocks . Next , all 822 sessions were then manually inspected to identify a conservative red fluorescence threshold , which 823 was subsequently applied to all sessions . Analyses of neural activity were based on deconvolved 824 values ( “inferred spiking activity” ) . Since the deconvolved values do not represent absolute firing 825 rates , we performed z - score normalization for each neuron before computing trial - averages across 826 cells . The total number of recorded neurons per session was 396 ± 105 ( mean ± standard deviation ) . 827 Optogenetic inactivation 828 Photostimulation was performed using a 470 nm high - power LED ( M470F3 , Thorlabs ) with a 829 power density of 25 mW / mm 2 . Stimuli consisted of a square wave stimulus that ramped down in 830 power for 200 milliseconds , to avoid an excitatory post - illumination rebound due to sudden release 831 of inhibition 85 . To prevent animals’ visual detection of photostimulation , either through external 832 leakage from light - insulated mating sleeves or transmission to the retina across the brain , an 833 external LED with matching wavelength placed at the center of the animal’s visual field was 834 flashed throughout the duration of every trial . Photoinhibition was performed in 20 % of total trials 835 and randomly interleaved between light - off trials . During each session , only bilateral frontal , 836 parietal or visual cortex inhibition was performed . Once an animal was habituated and able to 837 complete detection behavior trials with > 90 % accuracy , optogenetic inactivation trials were 838 introduced . During these initial sessions , optogenetic inhibition was performed from the beginning 839 of the stimulus epoch until the end of the delay epoch . Additionally , we performed 0 . 5 - second 840 inhibition during four pre - defined epochs of the detection behavior trials : ( 1 ) first half of the 841 stimulus , ( 2 ) second half of the stimulus , ( 3 ) delay , ( 4 ) response . 842 Immunohistology , microscopy and image analysis 843 For a given animal , after all experiments were concluded , we performed transcardial perfusion 844 with PBS followed by fixation with 4 % PFA in 0 . 1 M PB . Brains were post - fixed in 4 % PFA for 845 an additional 12 - 18 hours at 4° . Prior to sectioning , brains were rinsed three times in PBS and 846 embedded in 4 % agarose - PBS . Slices 50 μm in thickness were made using a vibrating microtome 847 ( Leica , VT100S ) . Sections were then suspended in blocking solution ( 10 % Normal Goat Serum 848 and 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 in 1X PBS ) for 1 hour followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with the 849 primary antibody . Next , sections were washed with PBS , incubated for 1 h at room temperature 850 with the secondary antibody at 1 : 500 dilution . For visualization of GCaMP6s , we used primary 851 goat polyclonal anti - GFP antibody ( Abcam ) and secondary donkey anti - goat Alexa Fluor 488 852 ( Abcam ) . Sections were then dry - mounted on slides using Vectashield ( Vector Labs , H1000 ) prior 853 to imaging . No immunostaining was performed for the visualization of FusionRed or tdTomato . 854 Imaging was performed using upright fluorescence macroscope and microscope ( Olympus BX61 ) . 855 Images were acquired using Ocular Scientific Image Acquisition Software ( Teledyne Imaging ) 856 and visualization and analysis were performed using ImageJ / FIJI software packages . 857 23 Quantification cortex - wide gene expression 858 Quantification of cell counts across the dorsal cortex was performed using publicly available serial 859 two - photon tomography ( STPT ) datasets . ( http : / / www . brainimagelibrary . org / ) 26 . Cre expression 860 patterns for IT and PT neurons were characterized with data from eight mice , expressing either 861 Cre - dependent GFP ( PlexinD1 - 2A - CreER ; Snap25 - LSL - 2A - EGFP ) or tdTomato ( Fezf2 - 2A - 862 CreER ; Ai14 ) , respectively . Cell counting was then performed via automated soma detection , using 863 a trained convolutional neural network 86 . STPT datasets were then registered to the Allen CCF v3 864 using the elastix toolbox 87 . To obtain the density of Cre - expressing neurons for individual cortical 865 areas , we used the area outlines from the Allen CCF and computed the average sum of detected IT 866 or PT neuron in each area , normalized by its surface area . 867 Preprocessing of neural data 868 We first performed motion correction on each imaging frame , using a rigid - body image 869 registration method implemented in the frequency domain 88 that aligned each frame to the median 870 over all frames in the first trial . To reduce the computational cost of subsequent analyses , we then 871 computed the 200 highest - variance components using singular value decomposition ( SVD ) . These 872 components accounted for at least 95 % of the total variance in each recording , whereas computing 873 500 components accounted for little additional variance ( ~ 0 . 15 % ) . SVD reduces the raw imaging 874 data Y to a matrix of ‘spatial components’ U ( of size pixels by components ) , ‘temporal 875 components’ V T ( of size components by frames ) and singular values S ( of size components by 876 components ) to scale temporal components to the original data . The resulting decomposition has 877 the form Y = USV T . All subsequent analysis in the time domain ( such as the encoder and decoder 878 models described below ) were then performed on the product SV T and the respective results were 879 later multiplied with U , to recover results for the original pixel space . To avoid slow drift in the 880 imaging data , SVT was high - pass filtered above 0 . 1 Hz using a zero - phase , second - order 881 Butterworth filter . 882 To compute trial averages and perform choice decoder analysis ( see below ) , imaging data in 883 individual trials were aligned to the four trial periods , each marked by a specific event . This was 884 required because the duration of different trial events was randomized to reduce temporal 885 correlations , e . g . between trial initiation , the stimulus presentation and subsequent lick responses . 886 The first period ( Initiate ) was aligned to the time when animal initiated a trial by touching the 887 handles , the second ( Stimulus ) was aligned to the stimulus onset , the third ( Delay ) to the end of 888 the stimulus sequence , and the fourth ( Response ) to the time when spouts were moved in to allow 889 a lick response . After alignment , the total trial duration was 2 seconds and durations of respective 890 trial episodes were 0 . 5 ( Initiate ) , 1 ( Stimulus ) , 0 . 2 ( Delay ) , and 0 . 3 seconds ( Response ) . 891 Spatial clustering and classification 892 To obtain more interpretable spatial components and assess the dimensionality of cortical activity 893 in different PyN types , we used semi - nonnegative matrix factorization ( sNMF ) . As with SVD , 894 sNMF also creates spatial and temporal components for each session and for each mouse but 895 enforces spatial components to be strictly positive . The reason why temporal components were not 896 also enforced to be non - negative is that our hemodynamic correction resulted in temporal 897 dynamics that can be either positive or negative , relative to baseline . We used the LocaNMF 898 toolbox by Saxena et al 33 ( https : / / github . com / ikinsella / locaNMF ) to transform the spatial and 899 temporal components U and SV T into two corresponding matrices A and C , where A is a matrix 900 of non - negative spatial components ( of size pixels by components ) and C the corresponding 901 temporal components ( of size components by frames ) . In addition to regular sNMF , the LocaNMF 902 24 toolbox can be initialized with spatial constraints that are based on the Allen CCF . To obtain 903 spatially restricted localized LocaNMF components , we constructed a map of larger seed regions 904 by merging several smaller areas in the Allen CCF together ( Fig . 2e ) . This region map is then used 905 to enforce that each component in A is sparse outside the boundary of a given region . The amount 906 of possible overlap between regions is specified by a localization threshold which specifies the 907 percentage of a given component that is constrained to be inside a single region’s boundary . To 908 obtain dense spatial components that were mostly driven by the local correlations between pixels 909 and could also lie at the border between seed regions , we used a localization threshold of 50 % . To 910 obtain unconstrained sNMF spatial components , we also used the LocaNMF toolbox but only 911 provided a single region that spanned the entire cortex . This resulted in cortex - wide components , 912 similar to vanilla sNMF , while ensuring that all other analysis steps were done identically for 913 sNMF and LocaNMF components . In both cases , we determined how many components in A and 914 C were needed to explain 99 % of the variance of Y ( with Y = AC ) after the initial SVD . 915 To compare spatial sNMF and LocaNMF components from different PyN types , we embedded 916 them in a 2 - dimensional space , using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) 917 analysis ( Fig . 2c , g ) . UMAP analysis was performed with the UMAP toolbox by McInnes et al . 35 918 ( https : / / github . com / lmcinnes / umap ) . For each recording , the first 20 spatial components in A 919 ( either from sNMF or region - constrained LocaNMF ) were downsampled by a factor of 2 , 920 smoothed with a 2 - D gaussian filter ( 5 x 5 pixels , 2 pixel standard deviation ) and peak - normalized . 921 Components from all recordings and animals were then combined into a larger matrix ( of size 922 pixels by components ) and we used UMAP to project the first ( pixel ) dimension into two , 923 maximally separating non - linear dimensions . Each point in the two dimensional space ( Fig . 2c , g ) 924 therefore reflects a single component from one animal in a given imaging session . 925 The same UMAP approach was used for temporal sNMF and LocaNMF components . Before the 926 UMAP projection , we first computed the trial - averaged and z - scored activity of each component 927 to achieve temporal dynamics that are comparable across sessions and individual mice . 928 To identify PyN types based on individual spatial components ( Fig . 2d , h ) , we performed a separate 929 UMAP projection for each mouse . Each of these projections excluded all components from the 930 test animal , ensuring that the UMAP projection was not shaped by potential noise patterns or other 931 unknown features of the test components that could affected the classifier result . We then tested 932 the first 20 components of each session of the test animal with 100 repetitions per component . In 933 every repetition , 1000 components from each PyN type were randomly selected from the pre - 934 computed UMAP space and we then assigned the PyN type of the test component based on the 935 identity of its 10 nearest neighbors in UMAP space . For LocaNMF components , we performed the 936 same procedure but additionally ensured to use an equal number of components from each seed 937 region and PyN type to prevent PyN types with a larger number of components in a given region 938 from biasing the classifier result . Classifier accuracy for each session ( Fig . 2d , h ) was then 939 computed as the mean probability over all repetitions to accurately identify the PyN type . 940 To determine the size of PyN - predictive LocaNMF components , we selected all spatial 941 components that achieved a classification accuracy of 99 % percent or higher ( all other components 942 were assigned as non - specific ) and thresholded each component above 0 . 2 to obtain a binary 943 image . The size of each component was then computed as the square root of the sum of all pixels 944 and converted to square millimeters . 945 Linear encoding model 946 25 The linear encoding model was based on a combination of task - and movement - related variables , 947 as described previously 32 . Each variable consisted of multiple regressors that were combined into 948 a larger design matrix . Binary regressors contained a single pulse that signaled the occurrence of 949 specific events , such as the stimulus onset , and additional regression copies that were shifted 950 forward or backward in time to account for changes in cortical activity before or after the respective 951 event . For auditory stimuli , the time - shifted copies spanned all frames from the onset of the 952 auditory sequence until the end of the trial . Individual click sounds were also captured by an 953 additional regressor set that spanned the 2 seconds after click onset . For motor events , like licking 954 or whisking , the time - shifted copies spanned the frames from 1 s before until 2 s after each event . 955 Lastly , for some variables , such as the previous choice , the time - shifted copies spanned the whole 956 trial . Other variables were analog , such as measures from the piezo sensor or the pupil diameter , 957 and also contained the 200 highest temporal components of video information from both cameras 958 ( using SVD as described above ) . This ensured that the model could account for animal movements 959 and accurately isolate task - related activity . Movement and task variables were additionally 960 decorrelated due to the variable durations of the initiation , stimulus and delay period . The model 961 was fit using ridge regression to allow for similar contributions from different correlated variables . 962 To determine the regularization penalty λ for each column of the widefield data , we used marginal 963 maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) 89 . MLE expresses the encoding model as a Bayesian linear 964 model and determines the ridge penalty λ by maximizing the marginal likelihood π ( D | λ ) of the 965 model , given data D . This was done iteratively by testing different λ values to determine a global 966 minimum for the negative log - likelihood −log π ( D | λ ) . The main advantage of this approach is 967 that λ can be determined without computationally expensive cross - validation procedures , resulting 968 in a ~ 50 - fold decrease in required compute time on a regular work station . Moreover , the faster 969 MLE approach allows adjusting λ values for individual widefield data components which results 970 in higher cross - validated explained variance of the encoding model , compared to a regular cross - 971 validation approach ( Supp . Fig . 16 ) . 972 Variance analysis 973 Explained variance ( cvR 2 ) was obtained using 10 - fold cross - validation . This was done by fitting 974 the model weights to a continuous 90 % - large section of the imaging data and then computing the 975 explained variance in the remaining 10 % of the data . The procedure was repeated for 10 times , 976 while shifting the training and test data to ensure that each part of the recording was used in the 977 test data in one of the folds . To assess unique explained variance by individual variables ( ΔR 2 ) , 978 we created reduced models in which all regressors of a specific variable were shuffled in time . 979 Shuffling of each regressor was done within individual trials to account for a potential impact of 980 very slow temporal correlations due the kinetics of the calcium indicator . The difference in 981 explained variance between the full and the reduced model yielded the unique contribution ΔR 2 of 982 that model variable that could not be explained by other variables in the model . The same approach 983 was used to compute unique contributions for groups of variables , i . e . , ‘Movements’ and ‘Task’ . 984 Here , all variables that corresponded to a given group were shuffled at once . 985 Decoding model 986 To predict animal’s left / right choices from widefield data , we trained logistic regression decoders 987 with an L1 penalty on the temporal component matrix SV T in each session . The L1 penalty was 988 defined as the inverse of the number of observations in the test dataset during cross - validation , 989 which yielded a good balance between the cross - validated prediction accuracy of the decoder and 990 the number of non - zero model regressors . When decoding choice , we randomly removed trials 991 until there was an equal amount of correct and incorrect trials where mice chose the left and the 992 right side . By balancing left / right choice sides and correct / incorrect trials , we ensured that the 993 26 decoder would not predict choices due to corresponding sensory information or would be 994 influenced by potential side biases . The logistic regression model was implemented in Matlab 995 using the ‘fitclinear’ function and run repeatedly for each time point in individual trials after re - 996 aligning them to trial periods as described above . In each session , all decoder runs were performed 997 with the same amount of trials ( at least 250 trials ) and we used 10 - fold cross - validation to compute 998 decoder accuracy at each time point in the trial . Beta weights were averaged from all models 999 created during cross - validation and convolved with the spatial component matrix U to create 1000 cortical maps of the choice decoder weights . 1001 Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) analysis 1002 We computed the area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) to quantify choice preference of single neurons 1003 obtained from two - photon imaging . AUCs were computed by comparing the mean neural activity 1004 during the stimulus and delay period in all trials with ipsilateral versus contralateral choices . AUC 1005 values denote the specificity of the neural activity to ipsi - or contralateral choices , with values 1006 below 0 . 5 signifying ipsilateral choice - selectivity and AUC values above 0 . 5 contralateral choice - 1007 selectivity . To identify statistically significant choice - selective neurons , AUC values were also 1008 computed for shuffled trial labels ( randomly assigning ipsi - and contralateral choices across trials ) 1009 for each neuron . This procedure was repeated 100 times to create a distribution of shuffled AUC 1010 values for each neuron . A neuron’s choice selectivity was then deemed significant if the probability 1011 of obtaining the actual AUC from the shuffled AUC distribution was less than 0 . 05 . 1012 1013 Code availability statement : Code for preprocessing ( e . g . , hemodynamic correction and 1014 dimensionality reduction ) is available here : 1015 https : / / github . com / churchlandlab / WidefieldImager / tree / master / Analysis . 1016 A cloud - based option for many of these steps is available at Neurocaas : http : / / neurocaas . org .
