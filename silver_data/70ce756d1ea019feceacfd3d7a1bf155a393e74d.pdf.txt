However , due to the high strains that occur in physiological situations ( up to 50 % ) and the complex structure of living cells , suitable experimental techniques are rare . In this study , we introduce a new system composed of an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , a cell stretching system based on elastomeric substrates , and light microscopy . With this system , we investigated the inﬂuence of mechanical stretch on monolayers of keratinocytes . In repeated indentations at the same location on one particular cell , we found signiﬁcant sti ﬀ ening at 25 % and 50 % strain amplitude . To study the contribution of intermediate ﬁlaments , we used a mutant keratinocyte cell line devoid of all keratins . For those cells , we found a softening in comparison to the wild type , which was even more pronounced at higher strain amplitudes .

Introduction Living cells exhibit fascinating mechanical properties that are decisive for many fundamental processes like tissue maintenance , wound healing , or the resilience of skin against external forces . In all such mechanical processes , the three ﬁlamentous cytoskeletal systems—actin ﬁlaments ( AFs ) , microtubules ( MT ) , and intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) —interact synergistically to build and control a fascinating composite material with unique mechanical properties . Experiments using diverse force probes like atomic force microscope ( AFM ) cantilevers [ 1 , 2 ] , optical tweezers [ 3 – 6 ] , magnetic tweezers [ 7 – 9 ] , or micropipette aspiration [ 10 , 11 ] , were instrumental in elucidating complex biomaterial properties like strain sti ﬀ ening [ 12 – 14 ] , glass - like behavior [ 15 , 16 ] , or stretch - induced ﬂuidization [ 17 ] of cells . In a second line of experiments , active responses of cells to external stretch were investigated using freely suspended sheets of endothelial cells [ 18 ] or cells plated on highly stretchable substrates [ 19 – 22 ] . In all cases , the experiments suggested that the mechanical properties of living cells change dramatically upon external stretch . Measurements of mechanical properties of cells subject to external stretch are substantially complicated due to high cell - to - cell variability and extreme spatial variations , even at the single cell level . Moreover , applying physiological strain amplitudes of up to 50 % [ 23 , 24 ] during micro - or Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / mps2020043 www . mdpi . com / journal / mps Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 2 of 14 nanomechanical tests is challenging . To enable reliable measurements in such conditions , we built an instrument that combined continuous light microscopy with atomic force microscopy and large amplitude stretching via elastomeric substrates . Because the epidermis is a mechanically very active organ , we chose its main cellular component , the keratinocytes , for these prototype experiments . A second focus is on keratins and their role in the mechanical resilience of epidermal cell monolayers against high strains [ 25 ] . Keratins form the largest subgroup of IFs with 54 members expressed in epithelial tissues and contribute significantly to the stiffness of cells against indentation [ 26 , 27 ] . Furthermore , in contrast to AFs and MTs , IFs are extremely stretchable . In AFM experiments , reconstituted IFs could be stretched to 260 % [ 28 ] and 350 % [ 29 ] without rupturing . Moreover , as intracellular components in confluent monolayers , IFs resisted strains of more than 100 % [ 30 ] . In reconstituted networks , both their stiffness and their resilience against mechanical strain correlate with the applied level of deformation [ 12 ] . With regard to stress resilience , IFs and AFs mechanically complement each other . For small strains , AFs form networks that are highly tensed , while IFs remain ﬂoppy . Beyond a critical point of strain ( somewhere above 20 % ) , reconstituted AFs rupture . This strain level corresponds roughly to the critical strain amplitude where solutions of intermediate ﬁlaments start to sti ﬀ en [ 12 ] . We hypothesize that this behavior also persists in living cell monolayers . Therefore , we performed comparative measurements of a keratin - free keratinocyte cell line ( knockout , KO ) and their wild - type control ( WT ) , both grown as conﬂuent cell monolayers . In the ﬁrst part of this work , we give a detailed characterization of our system . This is followed by biomechanical analyses of keratinocyte monolayers under large strain in which we found compelling evidence of keratins being responsible for cell sti ﬀ ening at large strains . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Preparation of Cell Chambers Molding of elastomeric cell chambers was based on Faust et al . [ 22 ] . The same chamber geometry and molds were used . An addition - curing polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) elastomer was prepared from a two - component formulation ( Silpuran 2430 A / B , Wacker Chemie AG , München , Germany ) . Part A and B were mixed in a ratio of 1 to 4 by weight . Preparation was performed in a cold room at 6 ◦ C , while curing was achieved overnight at room temperature . Otherwise , the preparation was done as described previously [ 22 ] . The silicone rubber exhibited a Young’s modulus of ~ 370 kPa after crosslinking . For a better mimic of physiological conditions , the chamber bottoms were covered by 130 µ m of a softer PDMS elastomer ( 50 kPa ; Sylgard 184 , Dow Corning GmbH , Wiesbaden , Germany ) via spin coating . Coated chambers were cured again for 16 h at 60 ◦ C . Elastomer sti ﬀ ness was calibrated as described in the supplement of [ 31 ] . In brief , elastomer layers with deﬁned thickness were prepared on rigid support and indented with a ﬂat cylindrical punch attached to a force sensor . Indentation was done in several steps of 200 µ m , each followed by a 40 min relaxation period . Because the ratio of equilibrium force to indentation depth is directly proportional to the Young’s modulus , this yielded the latter . The necessary proportionality factor was determined on layers of sti ﬀ er silicone rubber from which cylindrical test pieces could be prepared and calibrated by vertical stretching as described in [ 32 ] . 2 . 2 . Preparation of Calibration Samples For calibration of local strains , ﬂuorescent beads were immobilized on top of the soft elastomer layer by the following method . PDMS surfaces were functionalized with ( 3 - aminopropyl ) triethoxysilane ( APTES , Sigma - Aldrich Chemie GmbH , München , Germany ) . To this end , they were incubated for 3 min with a freshly prepared 5 % solution of APTES ( in 5 % water in ethanol , pH 4 . 5 – 5 . 5 with acetic acid , age of solution 1 . 5 – 2 h ) , washed with ethanol , and dried in vacuo . Fluorescent beads ( FluoSpheres , carboxylate - modiﬁed , 0 . 2 µ m , blue , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) were activated by 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC ; Sigma - Aldrich Chemie GmbH , Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 3 of 14 München , Germany ) and N - hydroxysulfosuccinimide ( NHS ; Sigma - Aldrich Chemie GmbH , München , Germany ) via 15 min incubation in MES bu ﬀ er ( 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ; 50 mM , pH 6 . 0 with NaOH ) containing 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 0 . 6 ppm beads , 20 mg / mL EDC , and 20 mg / mL NHS . Silanized substrates were incubated for 1 min with activated beads and thoroughly rinsed with water . For thickness determination of the soft PDMS layer on top of the sti ﬀ er chamber bottom , ﬂuorescent beads were deposited on the latter before overlaying it with soft elastomer . To this end , bead suspensions ( PSI - B 0 . 5 ﬂuorescent blue ( 354 / 450 ) plain surface , Kisker Biotech , Steinfurt , Germany ) were diluted with pure ethanol ( AnalaR Normapur , VWR International , Darmstadt , Germany ) at a ratio of 1 : 100 , pipetted on uncoated Silpuran chamber bottoms , and evenly spread . After evaporation , the second silicone and the second bead layer were prepared on top as described above . Thickness was determined from the distance between the focus planes of both bead layers in ﬂuorescence microscopy . The necessary correction for refractive index mismatch was applied . 2 . 3 . Stretching Setup and Protocol Cell stretcher and chamber holders were based on the design described in Faust et al . [ 22 ] . Major alterations due to space limitations below the AFM head ( Nanowizard 1 , JPK , Berlin , Germany ) are described in the results section . Chambers were stretched by 7 . 5 % of their size ( corresponding to 1 . 5 mm ) before experiments to avoid sagging of the chamber bottom . Strain was increased at a constant speed of 0 . 75 % / s ( 0 . 15 mm / s ) until the desired target strain was reached , and the system was arrested . Target strains were 25 % and 50 % , and the measurement period at each strain was 30 min . Due to the design of the chamber and the stretcher , the strain was uniaxial . 2 . 4 . Strain Calibration All strain amplitudes given in the text refer to externally applied strains by the stepper motor . Local strains were calibrated by stretching an empty silicone chamber coupled with ﬂuorescent beads as markers for local in - plane strains of the chamber surface . Rectangular template regions ( 33 µ m by 263 µ m ) containing approximately 100 beads were selected . Normalized cross - correlation was used to ﬁnd the templates again at di ﬀ erent strain amplitudes . The a ﬃ ne transformation that best morphed the undeformed template into the stretched one was calculated by the Lucas – Kanade algorithm [ 33 ] . Via this transformation , strained template regions could be compared with the unstretched state , and local strains could be determined . 2 . 5 . Atomic Force Microscopy Indentations on cells were performed using an AFM equipped with a cantilever of nominal resonance frequency f 0 = 6 kHz and a spring constant k = 0 . 03 N / m ( Arrow - TL1 - 50 , NanoWorld AG , Neuchatel , Switzerland ) . A spherical silica bead ( radius : 3 . 6 µ m , Kisker Biotech , PSI - 5 . 0 , surface plain , Steinfurt , Germany ) was glued ( UHU plus Endfest 300 ; UHU , Bühl , Baden , Germany ) onto the cantilever tip as previously described [ 26 ] . AFM indentations were performed at room temperature with a cantilever speed of 0 . 5 µ m / s for approach and 2 µ m / s for retract . Indentations were repeated six times for each position with 2 s pauses between measurements . A sampling rate of 2 kHz and a force set point of 1 . 5 nN were used . Before each measurement , cantilever spring constants and sensitivities were calibrated in culture medium using the thermal noise method [ 34 ] , and the slope of a sample force – distance curve was recorded on a sti ﬀ substrate as usual [ 34 ] ( glass Petri dish in this case ) . Cantilevers were equilibrated for 30 min in culture medium before calibrations . AFM control measurements in chambers without cells were performed in 2 % detergent solution in water ( Triton X - 100 , Sigma - Aldrich Chemie GmbH , München , Germany ) . No additional CO 2 supply was used . Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 4 of 14 2 . 6 . Noise Analyses During approach , cantilever deﬂections were recorded in a range of 1 . 5 µ m to 1 . 0 µ m above the sample . These curves were corrected for a linear drift , and the remaining noise was analyzed by fast Fourier transformation ( Origin 2015 G ; OriginLab , Northampton , MA , USA ) . Time was chosen as the integration variable . A triangular window was used to reduce frequency leakage . 2 . 7 . Cell Culture The keratinocyte cell lines used—keratin I knockout and the corresponding wild - type control—have been described previously [ 35 , 36 ] . Both were cultivated at 5 % ( v / v ) CO 2 and 32 ◦ C in keratinocyte medium as described previously [ 37 ] . This medium contained only a low concentration of 50 µ M Ca 2 + to prevent formation of cell – cell contacts . Chamber bottoms were coated with 20 µ g / mL ﬁbronectin ( human ; Corning ) in phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline ( PBS ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) overnight . Subsequently , 200 , 000 cells were seeded in each chamber ( inner area ~ 4 cm 2 ) . After an adhesion period of 60 min , the medium was replaced by keratinocyte medium supplemented with a higher Ca 2 + concentration ( 1 . 8 mM ) to allow epithelial sheet formation . Directly before measurements , which began 17 h after cell seeding , the medium was exchanged again with freshly prepared and thermally equilibrated high Ca 2 + medium bu ﬀ ered with 25 mM HEPES ( 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - peperazineethanesulfonic acid ; Sigma Aldrich ) . Measurements were done within a 75 min period after the last bu ﬀ er exchange . 2 . 8 . Light Microscopy The radius of the microsphere on the cantilever tip was determined with an upright microscope ( Axio Imager . M2 , Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a 40 × / 0 . 6 NA LD - Achroplan objective ( Zeiss ) . The thicknesses of spin - coated PDMS layers as well as bead patterns for strain calibration were determined with the same upright microscope equipped with a 10 × / 0 . 3 NA W N - Achroplan lens ( Zeiss ) . Correction of the optical pathway was done with the refractive index of PDMS n = 1 . 43 . For AFM measurements , cells were imaged using an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 200 , Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a 40 × / 0 . 6 NA Plan - Neoﬂuar ( corr . : 1 – 1 . 5 mm ) objective ( Zeiss ) and the recommended equipment for di ﬀ erential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy . Indentation regions were localized with DIC microscopy . 2 . 9 . Statistical Analyses Nonparametric tests were performed . A two - sided Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for matched data pairs , and Mann – Whitney U test was used for unpaired data . Signiﬁcant di ﬀ erences are indicated in the diagrams ( not signiﬁcant ( ns ) p > 0 . 05 , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . 3 . Results Forthemechanicalcharacterizationofstrainedcells , severalchallengeshadtobemet . Abiocompatible elastomer system withstanding large mechanical strains had to be established . The stretcher system had to be adapted to the spatial limitations of atomic force microscopy and , finally , the problem of cells moving out of the field of view during stretching had to be solved . Moreover , the pick - up of acoustic noise by the stretched elastomer lamella turned out to be troublesome . In the following sections , we will describe step - by - step how these challenges were overcome . 3 . 1 . Enabling Extremely Large Strains in Elastomeric Chambers In the so - called security belt hypothesis [ 38 ] , keratins are supposed to act as a mechanical bu ﬀ er system that protects epithelial tissues against mechanical failure . To test this hypothesis , we applied physiological strains [ 23 ] in regimes where reconstituted IFs start to sti ﬀ en ( 20 % strain and more [ 12 ] ) . However , in our experience , most silicone elastomer systems fail at lasting or repetitive strains of about Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 5 of 14 30 % – 40 % . Therefore , we selected a silicone elastomer system that was optimized by the manufacturer for mechanical toughness . To enable chamber molding , we had to extend the possible processing time of the formulation by lowering the process temperature to 6 ◦ C . The resulting chambers were mechanically stable up to several days at a constant , high strain of 100 % . However , this material was unphysiologically sti ﬀ ( 370 kPa ; epithelial monolayers exhibit a sti ﬀ ness of about 20 kPa [ 18 ] ) . This , in turn , was solved by overlaying the chamber material with a softer silicone elastomer ( 50 kPa ) that had been extensively used before for cell biological work . Careful control by light microscopy ( di ﬀ erential interference contrast , also at high material strain , see below ) showed no indications of tearing or other damage of the silicone layer during chamber stretch . 3 . 2 . Matching the Stretching Device to an AFM Atomic force microscopes are built extremely compact to minimize sensitivity to external mechanical noise . As a consequence , the space is extremely tight , and it is di ﬃ cult to ﬁt an additional device under the AFM head . To cope with this , we decided to replace the adjustable sample stage from the microscope table with a new stretcher system with extremely ﬂat chamber holders to ﬁt in the available space . The lug connecting chamber holder and linear drive was elongated to place the bulky stepper motor outside of the AFM head . With these adaptations , the combined setup ﬁtted on the table of our light microscope . Hence , suitable cells and locations could be selected by light microscopy , and samples could be continuously observed optically . A sketch of the combined setup is shown in Figure 1 .

Matching the Stretching Device to an AFM Atomic force microscopes are built extremely compact to minimize sensitivity to external mechanical noise . As a consequence , the space is extremely tight , and it is difficult to fit an additional device under the AFM head . To cope with this , we decided to replace the adjustable sample stage from the microscope table with a new stretcher system with extremely flat chamber holders to fit in the available space . The lug connecting chamber holder and linear drive was elongated to place the bulky stepper motor outside of the AFM head . With these adaptations , the combined setup fitted on the table of our light microscope . Hence , suitable cells and locations could be selected by light microscopy , and samples could be continuously observed optically . A sketch of the combined setup is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 .

Arrows indicate directions of stretch and indentation . To minimize the impact of spatially varying mechanical properties , we needed to design a setup enabling AFM analyses on the same cells at different strain amplitudes . This way , the externally applied strain would be the only experimental parameter being varied .

We determined these displacements by tracking characteristic bead patterns and found a linear relationship between the distance to the immobile lug and the actual displacement upon stretching . To enable compensation of these displacements , we mounted the stretching device on the moveable translation stage . Thus , we could follow our samples during stretching . 3 . 3 . Setup Characterization For further characterization of the cell stretching device , we determined bead displacements during stretch to calibrate homogeneity and magnitude of the local strain . Therefore , we analyzed ﬁve di ﬀ erent locations distributed on the surface of the elastic chamber , as indicated in Figure 2 . Within each of these regions , the local strain was analyzed in more than 30 rectangular templates ( 33 µ m × 263 µ m ) ( Table 1 , raw data freely available at the public repository zenodo , see link at end of paper ) by the two - step algorithm described above . For both the strain ε xx in the stretch direction and the shrinkage ε yy transversal to that , we calculated the transversal shrinkage factor κ = − ε yy / ε xx ( see also Table 1 ) . Throughout the whole procedure , the surface remained ﬂat , as indicated by the focus quality of beads scattered over the surface . Therefore , we did not attempt to measure out - of - plane displacements . The overall change in thickness of the chamber ﬂoor can be determined from both the in - plane strains and the fact that soft silicone elastomers deform at constant volume ( Poisson ratio of 0 . 5 ) .

Setup Characterization For further characterization of the cell stretching device , we determined bead displacements during stretch to calibrate homogeneity and magnitude of the local strain . Therefore , we analyzed five different locations distributed on the surface of the elastic chamber , as indicated in Figure 2 . Within each of these regions , the local strain was analyzed in more than 30 rectangular templates ( 33 µm × 263 µm ) ( Table 1 , raw data freely available at the public repository zenodo , see link at end of paper ) by the two - step algorithm described above . For both the strain ε (cid:2934)(cid:2934) in the stretch direction and the shrinkage ε (cid:3052)(cid:3052) transversal to that , we calculated the transversal shrinkage factor κ = −𝜀 (cid:3052)(cid:3052) / 𝜀 (cid:3051)(cid:3051) ( see also Table 1 ) . Throughout the whole procedure , the surface remained flat , as indicated by the focus quality of beads scattered over the surface . Therefore , we did not attempt to measure out - of - plane displacements . The overall change in thickness of the chamber floor can be determined from both the in - plane strains and the fact that soft silicone elastomers deform at constant volume ( Poisson ratio of 0 . 5 ) .

Sketch to scale . Results of calibration are presented in Table 1 . In addition , we analyzed if the stretching device interfered with AFM performance . To this end , we recorded mock force – distance curves during the cantilever approach ( raw data can be found in supplement ) . The cantilever position was determined during an approach from 1 . 5 µm to 1 . 0 µm above the sample ( speed 0 . 5 µm / s ) , the linear trend was removed ( cf . Figure 3a ) , and the remaining noise component was analyzed via fast Fourier transformation as described in Materials and Methods . We found that the overall noise contained a major contribution of unknown origin at about , but not exactly , 200 Hz . Further peaks in the noise spectrum were found at higher frequencies ( 400 to 600 Hz ) . Peak positions and heights varied widely between different measurements . Because noise amplitudes increased with strain , meaningful AFM analysis was only possible for strains up to 50 % ( cf . Figure 3b – d ) . Figure 2 .

We also tested other ﬁlters for smoothing like a Savitzky – Golay - ﬁlter ( 2nd as well as 4th order , width 200 data points ) , which gave similar results . Each force – distance measurement was repeated six times . Because reproducibility was very good ( cf . Figure 4 ) , we averaged over these indentations . Moreover , the same indenter was used for all measurements .

These indentation amplitudes corresponded to an average contact area between cell and indenter of 15 µm 2 , that is , only about 0 . 6 % of the cell surface area .

Sample size was 14 di ﬀ erent cells except for KO lamella , where it was 13 . Because the widely used Hertz model resulted in systematic deviations between measurement and ﬁt curve , we used the more general but entirely empiric power law function instead : F = A δ b ( 1 ) with force F , indentation δ , and the free ﬁt parameters A and b . At rest ( 0 % strain ) , we obtained a median exponent of 2 . 03 for WT lamellae and 2 . 12 for KO lamellae ( see Figure 7d ) . At all other conditions and strains , higher exponents were found . Please note that the Hertz model [ 1 ] predicts an exponent of 1 . 5 and is therefore not compatible with our results . Ramms et al . [ 26 ] investigated the same cells on glass substrates with AFM . They reported a constant exponent of 2 using isolated cells in the absence of any mechanical stretch . To compare our results at unstrained lamellae to theirs , we also ﬁxed the exponent b at 2 . The resulting prefactor A 2 , termed apparent sti ﬀ ness by Ramms et al . , is deﬁned by the following : F = A 2 δ 2 ( 2 ) Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 11 of 14 It was determined from the slopes of the indentation versus force plot ( Figure 6 ) . For this calculation , linearization of Equation ( 2 ) around the central force value ( 1 . 25 nN ) was used . For WT , we found A WT = 3 . 6 kN / m 2 ( s . d . 0 . 62 kN / m 2 ) and for KO , A KO = 1 . 6 kN / m 2 ( s . d . 0 . 11 kN / m 2 ) . These values are higher than the ones reported by Ramms et al . but in a similar range . 4 . Discussion In the present work , we introduced a new technique that enables precise microrheological analyses of living cells and cell monolayers while subjecting them to prolonged uniaxial strains of large amplitude . Such a deformation mode would occur in human skin , for example , around contracting scar tissue or upon cosmetic surgery . Repeated measurements at identical positions on the same cell but at di ﬀ erent strain amplitudes were performed , and the results indicated pronounced strain sti ﬀ ening . In addition , we were able to distinguish between mechanical responses of cellular junctions and lamellae . Moreover , the mechanical e ﬀ ect of keratin knockout on keratinocytes was clearly detected . With our system , we could show a nearly one - to - one translation of externally applied strain to local strain as determined by measuring displacements of bead patterns on the chamber bottom . Thus , the strain experienced by cells could be easily adjusted and precisely controlled . We determined the ratio of extension in the strain direction and compression perpendicular to that and obtained a transversal shrinkage factor of κ = 0 . 20 ( s . d . 0 . 02 ) for 25 % strain and 0 . 17 ( s . d . 0 . 02 ) for 50 % strain , which is in good agreement with previous ﬁndings [ 22 ] . Moreover , we found a homogenous strain ﬁeld across the analyzed area ( cf . Table 1 ) . Taken together , all cells within the ﬁeld of view of the atomic force microscope were subjected to identical substrate deformations . Next , we performed control experiments on an empty chamber , revealing negligible small indentations in comparison to experiments on cells as well as no measurable inﬂuence of chamber strain . Therefore , the inﬂuence of the substrates on cell indentation experiments could be excluded . Indentations on lamellae of keratin KO cells within a monolayer revealed a similar apparent sti ﬀ ness than was reported for isolated keratinocytes [ 26 ] . However , the sti ﬀ ness of lamellae of WT cells within monolayers was , at average , 70 % higher than the value reported earlier [ 26 ] for isolated WT cells . Indentations at nuclei of cells in monolayer , done in Homberg et al . [ 27 ] , revealed 30 % less sti ﬀ ness than those we measured for cell lamellae of keratin WT as well as of KO cells . The same nuclei – lamellae relation was also found in Ramms et al . [ 26 ] for isolated cells . Taken together , our data are in reasonable agreement with earlier work on the same cell type . In addition , we observed a tendency of increasing exponents with higher strains ( see Figure 7d ) . This surprising e ﬀ ect deserves further research . To test our hypothesis that keratin acts as a security belt against high strains in epithelial tissues , we performed AFM indentations on a keratin - free cell model in combination with the matching WT control . We could show strain sti ﬀ ening on cell lamellae that was more pronounced in the presence of keratins . Furthermore , our results shed new light on the signiﬁcant but limited inﬂuence of IFs on the mechanics at small strains [ 39 ] . We found a higher strain sti ﬀ ening of keratin WT cells than of KO cells , which became even more pronounced at higher stretch amplitudes . This indicated an increased contribution of keratins to the mechanical sti ﬀ ness at large strain amplitudes . Such an e ﬀ ect had indeed been predicted by Bertaud et al . [ 40 ] , who used a coarse - grained simulation model . In conclusion , we veriﬁed our hypothesis that keratins enhance cellular strain sti ﬀ ening . Intriguingly , in keratin WT cells , junctions showed clear strain sti ﬀ ening , while this e ﬀ ect was absent in keratin - free cells . Hence , at these large strains , the presence of keratins seems to play a decisive role in force transmission from cellular junctions to the cell body . Strain sti ﬀ ening is quite common in biopolymer networks [ 12 , 41 , 42 ] and has also been observed in living cells [ 43 ] . In all these works , strain sti ﬀ ening was observed in the direction of the strain . Here , we observed sti ﬀ ening in a direction perpendicular to the stretch , which is much less intuitive . In this context , the work of Vahabi and coworkers [ 44 ] is of great interest . They applied both shear and uniaxial strain to collagen as well as ﬁbrinogen networks and measured pronounced strain sti ﬀ ening Methods Protoc . 2019 , 2 , 43 12 of 14 in the shear , i . e . , normal to stretch direction . These authors explained stretch - induced sti ﬀ ening by the fact that network extension favors extended , taut polymer conﬁgurations with correspondingly fewer bent polymers . As ﬁlaments are much sti ﬀ er in stretch than in bending , this is a natural explanation for sti ﬀ ening and could also contribute to the e ﬀ ects observed by us . In summary , we introduced a new experimental approach that provides the possibility of local rheological measurements of cells and cell assemblies while varying the amplitude of uniaxial mechanical strain . With this approach , we could pinpoint the role of keratins as a mechanical bu ﬀ er system against high strains in keratinocyte monolayers .
