Volume 27 April 1 , 2016 1143 MBoC | ARTICLE Clathrin binding by the adaptor Ent5 promotes late stages of clathrin coat maturation ABSTRACT Clathrin is a ubiquitous protein that mediates membrane traffic at many loca - tions . To function , clathrin requires clathrin adaptors that link it to transmembrane protein cargo . In addition to this cargo selection function , many adaptors also play mechanistic roles in the formation of the transport carrier . However , the full spectrum of these mechanistic roles is poorly understood . Here we report that Ent5 , an endosomal clathrin adaptor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , regulates the behavior of clathrin coats after the recruitment of clathrin . We show that loss of Ent5 disrupts clathrin - dependent traffic and prolongs the lifes - pan of endosomal structures that contain clathrin and other adaptors , suggesting a defect in coat maturation at a late stage . We find that the direct binding of Ent5 with clathrin is re - quired for its role in coat behavior and cargo traffic . Surprisingly , the interaction of Ent5 with other adaptors is dispensable for coat behavior but not cargo traffic . These findings support a model in which Ent5 clathrin binding performs a mechanistic role in coat maturation , where - as Ent5 adaptor binding promotes cargo incorporation . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - dependent traffic is a central facet of all eukaryotic cell biol - ogy . It mediates traffic at multiple locations , including endocytic traffic that originates at the plasma membrane and endosomal traf - fic that originates at trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) or at the endosomes ( reviewed in Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . It regulates nearly every aspect of cellular behavior through effects on the localization of transmem - brane , extracellular , and organellar proteins ( reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . To perform these many different functions , the clathrin coat must bind to many different protein cargoes and pack - age these into transport carriers . This cargo selection is performed by clathrin adaptors . There are more than a dozen different clathrin adaptors encoded in the genomes of most eukaryotes ( reviewed in Owen et al . , 2004 ) . Each clathrin adaptor acts as a complex interaction hub . In addition to binding to transmembrane cargo , most bind phospholipids , small GTPases , or other membrane - associated proteins that confer specificity to adaptor recruitment . Adaptors also directly interact with clathrin , the major structural component of the clathrin coat . This interaction links transmembrane cargo to the forming transport carrier . This function is the minimum definition of a clathrin adaptor . Many adaptors also perform additional mechanistic roles in the coat , such as bending membranes or stimulating clathrin polymer - ization ( Ahle and Ungewickell , 1986 ; Morgan et al . , 2000 ; Ford et al . , 2002 ; Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ; Kelly et al . , 2014 ; Miller et al . , 2015 ; Skruzny et al . , 2015 ) . However , it is unclear whether all adaptors per - form such central mechanistic roles or whether some act solely as linkers between cargo and clathrin . Determining which adaptors perform mechanistic roles and what those roles are is important to understanding the regulation of clathrin function in vivo . Elucidating the roles of clathrin adaptors at the TGN and early and late endosomes has been particularly challenging due , in part , to difficulties in imaging individual transport events and because cells can adapt to disruption in clathrin - dependent traffic by up - regulating other pathways ( Seeger and Payne , 1992 ) . In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , five clathrin adaptors are known to func - tion at the TGN and endosomes : the heteromeric AP - 1 complex ; the Golgi localized γ - adaptins , which are encoded by the para - logues GGA1 and GGA2 ; Ent3 , a protein belonging to the ENTH - A subfamily of epsins ; and Ent5 , a protein belonging to the ENTH - D Monitoring Editor Jean E .

Hung and M . C . Duncan Molecular Biology of the Cell RESULTS Ent5 provides a central function in endosomal clathrin - dependent traffic Previous research implicated Ent5 functions in endosomal / TGN traf - fic ; however , it was unclear whether Ent5 was a specialized cargo - specific adaptor or played a central mechanistic role in endosomal / TGN clathrin - dependent traffic ( ECT ; Costaguta et al . , 2006 ; Copic et al . , 2007 ) . To better understand its role in ECT , we tested whether the deletion of ENT5 impaired ECT , using a quantitative calcofluor white ( CFW ) sensitivity assay . This assay measures the fidelity of ECT by making intracellular retention of the chitin synthase Chs3 depen - dent on ECT . When ECT is defective , some Chs3 is found at the cell surface in cells lacking CHS6 , whereas , in otherwise wild - type cells , all Chs3 is retained intracellularly when CHS6 is deleted ( Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . Cell surface Chs3 makes the cells sensitive to CFW . We found that deletion of ENT5 increased the CFW sensitivity of cells lacking CHS6 ( Figure 1A ) . As a further test of the role of Ent5 in ECT , we examined the localization of the soluble N - ethylmaleimide – sen - sitive factor attachment protein receptor Tlg1 in cells lacking Ent5 . In wild - type cells , Tlg1 - mCherry was found in the vacuole and in punc - tate structures that colocalized with Gga2 - GFP , consistent with the known localization of Tlg1 at the TGN . In contrast , in cells lacking Ent5 , Tlg1 - mCherry puncta were rarer and dimmer than in wild - type cells ( Figure 1B ) . Furthermore , steady - state levels of Tlg1 are lower in cells lacking Ent5 , suggesting that Tlg1 is missorted to the vacuole subfamily of epsins ( Rad et al . , 1995 ; Boman et al . , 2000 ; Dell’Angelica et al . , 2000 ; Hirst et al . , 2000 ; Duncan et al . , 2003 ; Costaguta et al . , 2006 ; De Craene et al . , 2012 ) . Genetic studies sug - gest that AP - 1 and Gga proteins act in distinct pathways ( Boman et al . , 2000 ) . Ent3 appears to act exclusively with Ggas ( Costaguta et al . , 2006 ; Daboussi et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , the role of Ent5 has been unclear . Deletion of Ent5 causes only minor defects in traffic , suggesting that its role may be minor or cargo specific ( Costaguta et al . , 2006 ) . However , it localizes to every Gga2 or AP - 1 structure in vivo and is required for maximal Gga2 interaction with clathrin ( Daboussi et al . , 2012 ; Hung et al . , 2012 ) . These data suggest that it has a more central role . To clarify the function of Ent5 , we reexamined the role of Ent5 in endosomal / TGN traffic using new approaches . Using a quantitative assay of endosomal traffic , we find that loss of Ent5 impairs endo - somal traffic . In addition , removal of Ent5 prolongs the lifespan of clathrin coats after Gga2 and clathrin are recruited , indicating a de - fect after coat assembly initiates . We find that the direct interaction of Ent5 with clathrin is required for its role in coat behavior and cargo traffic , whereas direct interaction of Ent5 with Gga2 or AP - 1 is important for Ent5 ′ s function but not the turnover of Gga2 - contain - ing structures . Taken together , these results suggest that clathrin binding by Ent5 plays a key mechanistic role in the maturation of Gga2 - containing transport carriers , whereas adaptor binding by Ent5 does not .

In wild - type cells , these structures show a relatively stereotypi - cal behavior : fluorescence intensity of Gga2 and Chc1 increased steadily to a maximum point and then decreased rapidly ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . This behavior is believed to reflect the assembly of one or a coordinated assembly of multiple clathrin coats on an endosomal organelle followed by the rapid disassembly of the coat ( s ) or the rapid movement of the vesicle ( s ) after the complete formation of the vesicle ( s ) ( Daboussi et al . , 2012 ; Hung et al . , 2012 ) . The mean life - span of such structures , defined as the time point when the structure was first visible over background to when it was no longer visible , was 24 s for Gga2 - GFP and 23 s for Chc1 – red fluorescent protein ( RFP ; Figure 2D ) . In contrast , in cells lacking Ent5 , this stereotypical behavior was perturbed . The rate of fluorescence intensity increase was less uniform , and the mean lifespan of the structures was 11 s longer for Gga2 and 14 s longer for Chc1 . This increase in lifespan was largely due to an increase in the fraction of events with very long lifespans ( > 30 s ; Figure 2E ) . The increased lifespan is unlikely to be caused by reduced movement of the structures into or out of the plane of focus , because the mean speed of movement of structures determined from mean square displacement measurements was in - distinguishable from that for wild type ( unpublished data ) . These re - sults suggest that loss of Ent5 causes a defect in coat formation after clathrin and Gga2 recruitment but before coat disassembly . and degraded in these cells ( Figure 1C ) . These results are consistent with the loss of Ent5 causing a defect in ECT but do not distinguish between cargo - specific or central mechanistic roles for Ent5 . To distinguish between a cargo - specific or central mechanistic role , we investigated whether Ent5 alters the maximal recruitment of Gga2 or clathrin heavy chain ( Chc1 ) . To do this , we monitored the intensity of Clc1 – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) and Gga2 - GFP ex - pressed from their endogenous loci in wild type and cells lacking Ent5 . Surprisingly , the intensity of Clc1 - GFP was unaffected by dele - tion of ENT5 , suggesting that Ent5 is not required for the maximal recruitment of clathrin ( Figure 1D ) . Similarly , Gga2 - GFP was re - cruited to punctate structures in the absence of Ent5 . However , the intensity of Gga2 structures was increased 1 . 4 - fold in cells lacking Ent5 . These results suggest that Ent5 is not required for the associa - tion of clathrin and Gga2 with membranes . The increased intensity of Gga2 caused by loss of Ent5 is similar to the increased intensity of endocytic proteins caused by loss of endocytic epsins ( Maldonado - Baez et al . , 2008 ) . In endocytosis , this increased intensity is caused by the stalling of endocytic events after the initiation of coat formation . To test whether the increased inten - sity of Gga2 could be explained by a stalling of endosomal coat for - mation , we monitored the kinetics of coat assembly . To do this , we performed time - lapse microscopy on fluorescently labeled Chc1 and FIGURE 2 : Loss of ENT5 prolongs coat lifespan .

Duncan Molecular Biology of the Cell ANTH domains to generate a Ent5 ANTH - domain charge - reversal mutant ( Ent5 - CR ; Ford et al . , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ) . Ent5 also binds the γ - ear of clathrin adaptors Gga2 and AP - 1 . We disrupted this activity by mu - tating key acidic and hydrophobic residues of the highly conserved γ - ear interaction motif to generate an Ent5 adaptor - binding mutant ( Ent5 Δ AB ; Nogi et al . , 2002 ; Duncan et al . , 2003 ; Mills et al . , 2003 ) . Finally , Ent5 contains a pair of clathrin box motifs that mediate interaction with clathrin in many proteins ( Dell’Angelica , 2001 ) . We disrupted clathrin binding by mutating key residues of each clathrin box to generate an Ent5 clath - rin - binding mutant ( Ent5 Δ CB ; Figure 4A ) . When expressed from the endogenous ENT5 locus , each of the mutant proteins was expressed at the same level as wild - type Ent5 ( Supplemental Figure S1 , A – C ) . However , each of the mutant alleles re - duced the functional activity of Ent5 as as - sessed using the quantitative CFW assay ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that each activity contributes to Ent5 function in ECT . We next investigated the effects of each mutation on the localization of Ent5 . To do this , we expressed GFP - fusion proteins from the endogenous loci . We first confirmed that the addition of the GFP tag did not in - terfere with protein function , using the quantitative CFW assay ( Supplemental Figure S1D ) . We then assessed Ent5 local - ization by counting the GFP puncta per cell in a central plane ( Figure 3 , C and D ) . Each mutation altered the number of Ent5 puncta per cell in the central plane ; however , the magnitude of the effect differed substan - tially . The ent5 - CR mutation had the stron - gest effect . It increased the percentage of cells with no central - plane Ent5 puncta from 1 . 4 % in wild - type to 69 % in mutant cells ( Figure 3C ) . Furthermore , the mean number of puncta per cell in a central plane was re - duced to less than one in the mutant cells from three in wild - type cells . To determine whether the loss of Ent5 puncta reflected a loss of endosomes , we monitored endo - somes using clathrin as an endosomal marker . Clathrin structures were abundant in these cells , suggesting the mutation prevents endosomal localiza - tion of Ent5 rather than disrupts endosomal structures . Similar to the effects of ent5 - CR , the ent5 Δ CB mutation in - creased the percentage of cells with no puncta to 32 % and reduced the mean number of puncta per cell to one without altering clathrin localization . The ent5 Δ AB mutation , which mutates the two motifs that interact with Gga2 and AP - 1 , had the weakest defect . It did not significantly alter the percentage of cells with no puncta and re - duced the mean number of puncta per cell only slightly , from 3 to 2 . 6 . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the ANTH do - main and clathrin - binding motifs play important roles in Ent5 local - ization to clathrin - rich structures . Multiple domains of Ent5 contribute to its function and localization The extension in lifespan of Gga2 and Chc1 structures in cells lack - ing Ent5 suggests that Ent5 acts as more than a cargo linker . To better understand the role of Ent5 in ECT , we investigated the im - portance of different Ent5 domains and motifs in Ent5 function . To do this , we mutated each of the known domains and / or motifs in Ent5 ( Figure 3A ) . ENT 5 encodes an N - terminal ANTH domain . This domain is believed to bind cargo and / or lipids . To disrupt the func - tion of the ANTH domain , we mutated several positively charged residues that are predicted to lie on the surface of the ANTH do - main and are similar to residues that interact with lipids in other FIGURE 3 : Schematic of Ent5 and mutations generated .

Volume 27 April 1 , 2016 Ent5 promotes clathrin coat maturation | 1147 The strong effect of the ent5 Δ CB muta - tion on Ent5 localization suggests that clath - rin binding plays a key role in Ent5 localiza - tion . The finding that the effect of ent5 Δ AB mutation was less severe than the effect of the ent5 Δ CB mutation is surprising because the affinity of Ent5 for Gga2 is predicted to be at least five times higher than the affinity of Ent5 for clathrin ( Miele et al . , 2004 ; Fang et al . , 2010 ; Zhuo et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , based on just the predicted protein interac - tion affinity , the ent5 Δ AB allele should have a stronger effect than the ent5 Δ CB allele . However , we previously reported that clath - rin binding by Gga2 enhances Gga2 bind - ing to Ent5 , suggesting that clathrin binding can promote or stabilize the interaction be - tween adaptors ( Hung et al . , 2012 ) . To test whether clathrin stabilizes the interaction between Ent5 and Gga2 , we performed co - immunoprecipitation analysis . We found that Ent5 Δ CB coimmunoprecipitated less Gga2 than wild - type Ent5 . This suggests that the ent5 Δ CB allele reduces the interac - tion of Ent5 with Gga2 , in addition to reduc - ing the interaction with clathrin ( Figure 4 , A – C ) . In contrast , the ent5 Δ AB allele only reduced the interaction with Gga2 and did not interfere with the interaction with clath - rin . The stronger effect of the ent5 Δ CB al - lele on localization is thus consistent with a stronger effect of this allele on physical in - teractions with the coat . Surprisingly , we found that Ent5 Δ CB co - immunoprecipitated a small amount of clathrin , whereas Ent5 Δ AB coimmunopre - cipitated a small amount of Gga2 . Because these alleles were designed to ablate each activity entirely , we suspected that this inter - action might be indirect . For example , Ent5 Δ AB could interact with Gga2 indirectly via clathrin . To test this possibility , we inves - tigated the interactions of Ent5 that lacked both adaptor - and clathrin - binding motifs ( ABCB ) with clathrin and Gga2 . This allele reduced clathrin and Gga2 binding to unde - tectable levels , suggesting that , for the Ent5 Δ AB and Ent5 Δ CB proteins , the unex - pected interactions are indirect . The strong effect of the clathrin binding on Ent5 localization is not consistent with a previous report that the N - terminal ANTH domain of Ent5 was suf - ficient for localization ( Costaguta et al . , 2006 ) . We investigated this apparent contradiction in two ways . First , we reanalyzed the local - ization of the ANTH domain . We found that the ANTH domain was found in fewer puncta per cell in a central plane and that these puncta are dimmer than wild - type Ent5 ( Figure 3 , C – E ) . This sug - gests that the ANTH domain is not sufficient for maximal Ent5 local - ization . Second , as an independent confirmation of the importance of clathrin binding in Ent5 localization , we monitored Ent5 localiza - tion in cells expressing a version of clathrin that lacks the interaction site for proteins like Ent5 ( chc1 Δ box ) as the only version of clathrin We next analyzed the effect of the mutations on the amount of Ent5 recruited to each puncta ( Figure 3E ) . We were unable to per - form this analysis on the Ent5 - CR cells due the low fluorescence intensity of this mutant allele . We found that the mean intensity of Ent5 Δ CB structures was reduced 4 . 8 - fold compared with wild type . In contrast , the mean intensities of Ent5 Δ AB structures were only modestly reduced 1 . 6 - fold . Taken together , these results demon - strate that the ent5 - CR and ent5 Δ CB mutations perturb either the recruitment or persistence of Ent5 in clathrin - rich structures , whereas the ent5 Δ AB mutation does not substantially perturb its localization . FIGURE 4 : Clathrin is required for maximal interaction of Ent5 with Gga2 and localization of Ent5 to membranes . ( A ) A representative immunoprecipitation reaction . GFP - tagged Ent5 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates , and the immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies to Ent5 , Gga2 , and clathrin to monitor the effect of Ent5 mutations on the Ent5 – Gga2 and Ent5 – clathrin interactions . Apparent size shift in mutant proteins may be due to differences in surfactant binding , as previously observed for other mutations that alter charge ( Shi et al . , 2008 ; Rath et al . , 2009 ; De Zutter et al . , 2013 ) .

Duncan Molecular Biology of the Cell the lifespan of Gga2 structures by a mean of 5 s , which is indistin - guishable from lifespan extension observed in cells lacking Ent5 en - tirely ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . In contrast , the ent5 Δ AB allele did not alter the lifespan of Gga2 structures . These results indicate that the inter - action between Ent5 and clathrin regulates the behavior of endo - somal clathrin coats , whereas the interaction between Ent5 and Gga2 is dispensable for the normal lifespan of clathrin coats . We next investigated the recruitment of the Ent5 mutant pro - teins in relation to Gga2 . In wild - type cells , Ent5 is recruited after Gga2 with a mean “recruitment differential” of 4 s ( Figure 5C ) . Be - cause the Ent5 - CR mutant protein is barely detectable in these structures , we did not perform this analysis for this allele . The ent5 Δ CB mutation extended the mean of recruitment differential by 6 s , whereas the ent5 Δ AB mutation did not alter the recruitment dif - ferential . Because the ent5 Δ CB mutation increased both the lifes - pan of Gga2 structures and the recruitment differential between Ent5 and Gga2 , we asked whether the lifespan extension of Gga2 ( Collette et al . , 2009 ) . We first confirmed that the chc1 Δ box protein does not interact with Ent5 by coimmunoprecipitation ( Figure 4D ) . We then investigated the localization of Ent5 in this strain . We found that Ent5 was localized to fewer puncta in the chc1 Δ box cells and that the puncta were dimmer ( Figure 4E ) . This reduction of Ent5 lo - calization was not due to a gross defect in endosomal structures , since Gga2 structures were abundant in these cells . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that ANTH - domain functions and clathrin binding play a pivotal role in Ent5 function and localization , whereas adaptor binding is important for Ent5 function but is less important for localization . Ent5 clathrin binding promotes turnover of Gga2 structures in vivo To better understand how the Ent5 mutations perturb ECT , we mon - itored the effect of ENT5 mutations on the behavior of endosomal clathrin coats using Gga2 - mCherry .

Volume 27 April 1 , 2016 Ent5 promotes clathrin coat maturation | 1149 extended lifespan of coats containing Ent5 , Gga2 , and clathrin in cells expressing Ent5 - CB . In contrast , despite reduced Ent5 recruit - ment , Ent5 - AB – containing coats do not stall . We speculate that in wild - type and in Ent5 - AB – expressing cells , Ent5 binding to clathrin promotes a conformational organization of clathrin that enables clathrin polymerization . This suggests that Gga2 on its own is not capable of promoting this conformational organization . This may be because Gga2 contains only one copy of the clathrin - binding motif known as a clathrin box ( Drake and Traub , 2001 ) . A single clathrin box can bind clathrin ; however , two clathrin boxes appear to be re - quired for clathrin assembly in vitro ( Holkar et al . , 2015 ) . Although Gga2 contains many clathrin - binding sites in addition to the clathrin box , these additional sites are not clathrin boxes . They are low - affin - ity DLL - type binding sites , which may not promote rapid clathrin polymerization ( Dannhauser et al . , 2015 ; Zhuo et al . , 2015 ) . Thus as - sembly may rely on Ent5 alone , which contains two clathrin boxes , or on the cooperation of the three clathrin boxes available when both Ent5 and Gga2 are present . Our findings are similar to a recent study showing that acute inhibition of EpsinR , the closest ortho - logue of Ent5 in mammalian cells , inhibits clathrin coat assembly at a stage after clathrin recruitment but before disassembly ( Hirst et al . , 2015 ) . However , these results and ours are also consistent with other models , such as a role for Ent5 and EpsinR in disassembling clathrin coats . Therefore resolving the exact molecular mechanism by which Ent5 and EpsinR interfere with traffic will require an in vitro system that monitors assembly and organization directly using these proteins . A pivotal late - acting role may be a universal characteristic for epsin - related proteins . Loss of all three mammalian endocytic ep - sins ( Eps1 – 3 ) stalls coat maturation at a stage after clathrin recruit - ment ( Messa et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly , loss of yeast endocytic epsins stalls endocytosis at a stage long after clathrin is normally recruited ( Maldonado - Baez et al . , 2008 ) . This suggests that epsins may have a universal role in the clathrin coat after clathrin recruitment . How - ever , it is unclear whether Ent5 and endocytic epsins perform the same molecular activity to promote coat maturation . Mammalian endocytic epsins appear to promote endocytosis by linking actin to the clathrin coat ( Messa et al . , 2014 ) . However , Ent5 lacks the se - quences important for actin interaction , suggesting that Ent5 is un - likely to act via this mechanism . On the other hand , endocytic epsins could promote a late stage by both actin binding and stimulation of clathrin assem - bly . Indeed , recent in vitro work demon - strates that isolated endocytic epsins are potent stimulators of clathrin assembly , sug - gesting that clathrin assembly is a primary function of epsins ( Dannhauser and Unge - wickell , 2012 ; Dannhauser et al . , 2015 ; Holkar et al . , 2015 ) . Although the data presented here clearly indicate a late - acting and pivotal role for the clathrin - binding motifs of Ent5 , the func - tional importance of adaptor binding is less clear . The loss of adaptor binding by Ent5 impairs Chs3 traffic as much as loss of clath - rin binding , yet loss of adaptor binding does not alter the lifespan of Gga2 structures . This means that although Ent5 – Gga2 interaction is important , it does not play a pivotal role in the maturation of the coat at the level detectable by fluorescence microscopy . One possible function of the Ent5 – Gga2 structures could be explained exclusively by the delay in Ent5 re - cruitment . However , even after Ent5 was recruited , the lifespan was extended , as reflected in an increase in the average time that Ent5 and Gga2 colocalize from 20 s in wild - type cells to 28 s in mutant cells and an increase in the lifespan of Ent5 structures ( Figure 5 , D and E ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the lifespan extension of the Gga2 structures is due to both a delay in the re - cruitment of Ent5 and a delay in the maturation of the structure after Ent5 recruitment . This suggests that even after Ent5 is recruited , the inability of Ent5 to bind clathrin delays endosomal coat formation . This suggests that in addition to regulating recruitment of Ent5 to the endosomal clathrin coat , clathrin binding of Ent5 performs an important function that promotes ECT . DISCUSSION Epsins are an ancient family of proteins that are found in every known eukaryote . They are important for both endosomal and en - docytic clathrin coats . This conservation suggests that epsins per - form a critical function that has been retained during evolution . However , the nature of this function is unknown . Initial studies of epsins either failed to reveal a strong defect in membrane traffic upon depletion or loss of endocytic or endosomal epsins or re - vealed a cargo - selective function ( Duncan et al . , 2003 ; Aguilar et al . , 2006 ; Maldonado - Baez et al . , 2008 ; Chen et al . , 2009 ; Pasula et al . , 2012 ) . This led to the suggestion that epsins act as cargo - specific adaptors and do not play a key role in the formation of the transport carrier . Recent work has clearly established that endocytic epsins play fundamental mechanistic roles in the formation of the transport carrier ( Maldonado - Baez et al . , 2008 ; Messa et al . , 2014 ; Miller et al . , 2015 ; Skruzny et al . , 2015 ) . We now revealed that Ent5 plays a fundamental mechanistic role at the endosome . Based on the lifespan extension observed in cells lacking Ent5 , we propose that Ent5 plays a pivotal role in the formation of endosomal clathrin coats rather than a cargo - specific function . These data further sug - gest that Ent5 plays a role in the late stages of coat assembly , after the recruitment of Gga2 and clathrin . A late - acting function is also supported by the observation that wild - type Ent5 is recruited after clathrin ( Daboussi et al . , 2012 ) . We propose that the key function performed by Ent5 is the stim - ulation of clathrin assembly ( Figure 6 ) . This is consistent with the FIGURE 6 : Model of coat assembly . 1 ) Gga2 accumulates on membranes and recruits clathrin . 2 ) Ent5 , initially recruited via its ANTH domain , is stabilized by interaction with clathrin and Gga2 . This allows the recruitment of Ent5 - specific cargo . 3 ) Ent5 stimulates the formation of the transport carrier , possibly by inducing clathrin polymerization or forming a subclathrin coat . Gga2 helps to increase the amount of Ent5 in the carrier either through initial recruitment of more Ent5 or , as illustrated , by Gga2 indirectly linking Ent5 to the clathrin coat . 1150 | C . - W . Hung and M . C . Duncan Molecular Biology of the Cell Quantitative calcofluor white sensitivity assay To determine the effect of CFW on cells growth , log - phase cells were diluted 100 - fold into yeast extract / peptone / dextrose medium sup - plemented with different concentrations of CFW and then incubated at 30°C for 10 h before measurement of the optical intensity . Growth inhibition was calculated by normalizing to the absorbance reading of untreated cells . The IC50 values—halfway between the maximal and the minimal inhibition—were derived by a sigmoidal dose - re - sponse curve ( variable slope , four parameters ) using GraphPad Prism . Media , antibodies , and reagents Yeast cells were grown in yeast / peptone ( YP ) medium supple - mented with 2 % glucose ( D ) or synthetic medium ( SM ) supple - mented with 2 % glucose and an amino acid mix ( Lang et al . , 2014 ) . Antibodies against Ent5 and Gga2 were described previously ( Aoh et al . , 2011 ) . Antibodies against GFP and monomeric RFP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Dallas , TX ) . Alexa Fluor secondary anti - bodies were from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Peroxidase conjugate antibodies were from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . ECL plus reagent was from Advansta ( Menlo Park , CA ) . Calcofluor white fluorescent brightener and lyticase were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . Whole - cell yeast extracts To generate lysates , log - phase cells were pelleted , resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer ( 2 % SDS , 1 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) , boiled , and lysed by glass - bead mechanical disruption . The lysates were collected after centrifugation . After SDS – PAGE , samples were trans - ferred to nitrocellulose , blocked with 4 % milk in TBS - T ( 137 mM NaCl , 15 . 2 mM Tris - HCl , 4 . 54 mM Tris , 0 . 896 mM Tween 20 ) , and then probed with primary and fluorescent secondary antibodies . Fluorescence signals were detected on a Typhoon imaging system ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) chemiluminescence signals were detected on a Chemi - Doc - It system ( UVP , Upland , CA ) . Protein intensities were quantitated by ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . To determine the correction factor for the antibody against Ent5 , lysates of cells expressing GFP - Ent5 were collected . After the described SDS – PAGE and immunoblotting procedures , parallel samples were detected with antibody against Ent5 and GFP . The correction factor was calculated by determining the ratio be - tween GFP and Ent5 signals . Immunoprecipitation For immunoprecipitation , spheroplasts were first generated by re - suspending cells in 100 mM Tris - SO 4 , pH 9 . 5 , 2 % glucose , and 5 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min . Cells were then resuspended in YP medium supplemented with 0 . 5 % glucose , 10 mM Tris - HCl , 1 . 2 M sorbitol , and 120 U of lyticase . Cells were gently agitated for 30 min at 30°C and then washed in 1 . 2 M sorbitol and resuspended in buf - fer A ( 100 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ) with protease inhibi - tors cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were lysed by glass - bead lysis , followed by the addition of 1 % Triton X - 100 . The lysates were clari - fied by centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C . The lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with 100 μl of 20 % protein A – aga - rose slurry and 3 μl of antibody . The lysates were washed three times with ice - cold buffer A , and the bound proteins were eluted and mixed with SDS sample buffer . Microscopy Before imaging , cells were grown to log phase in SM supplemented with 2 % glucose and amino acids . Cells were briefly centrifuged and mounted on untreated coverslides for imaging . Images were interaction is to dictate how much Ent5 is recruited . Because Gga2 can bind both clathrin and Ent5 at the same time , it may act as a bridge to recruit more Ent5 than clathrin could recruit unaided . In support of such a model , substantially less Ent5 Δ AB is recruited to Gga2 structures than wild - type Ent5 . This reduced recruitment of Ent5 could impair traffic of Chs3 by reducing the amount of Ent5 – Chs3 complexes in the coat . Alternatively , Ent5 binding to Gga2 may be required to productively couple clathrin polymerization to membranes . The requirement for productive coupling in coat as - sembly was demonstrated with in vitro assays of endocytic adaptors ( Dannhauser and Ungewickell , 2012 ) . In these assays , the endocytic adaptor AP180 could promote clathrin cage assembly , but these cages lacked membrane . Intriguingly , Ent5 and AP180 share an N - terminal ANTH domain , which differs from the ENTH domain in ep - sin in its ability to bind lipids with an extended interface ( Duncan and Payne , 2003 ) . Thus Ent5 may require Gga2 to productively couple clathrin assembly to the membrane . Resolving the molecular re - quirement for Ent5 - Gga2 interaction will require examination of the formation of Ent5 - Gga2 coats on liposomes . These results also confirm a crucial role for the ANTH domain in Ent5 localization , consistent with previous reports ( Costaguta et al . , 2006 ) . Mutation of the ANTH domain disrupts Ent5 localization , sug - gesting that the ANTH domain is required for localization . However , how the ent5 - CR mutation disrupts Ent5 localization is unclear . Although many ANTH domains bind phosphoinositides , they can also bind proteins ( Koo et al . , 2011 ; Miller et al . , 2011 ) . Thus the ent5 - CR allele could interfere with either lipid or protein interaction . We have been unable to show specific phosphoinositide - binding defects caused by the ent5 - CR mutation . However , in our hands , Ent5 shows weak nonspecific binding to many phosphoinositides , consistent with previous surface plasmon resonance and vesicle centrifugation analy - sis of Ent5 ( Narayan and Lemmon , 2006 ) . This may be because in vivo Ent5 binds lipids only when associated with a cofactor similar to some endocytic ANTH domains , which require heterodimerization for effi - cient lipid binding ( Skruzny et al . , 2015 ) . Alternatively , the ent5 - CR mutation may abolish an unknown protein interaction . However , the ability of the ANTH domain alone to localize further confirms that the ANTH domain plays a major role in Ent5 localization . In summary , these results demonstrate that Ent5 plays a pivotal role late in clathrin coat formation . All known domains and motifs of Ent5 contribute to the function of Ent5 in Chs3 traffic . Furthermore , all three activities are required for maximal Ent5 recruitment to membranes , although the ANTH domain is the most important for localization . Clathrin binding appears to be uniquely important for the maturation of clathrin coats , whereas adaptor binding appears dispensable for coat maturation but may be important for linking cargo to coats . Together with recent reports of key mechanistic roles for endocytic epsins , these results suggest that epsin family mem - bers are key mechanistic drivers of clathrin coat function . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and plasmids Yeast strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1 . Fluorescent tags and gene deletions were introduced by a standard PCR - based method ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . Strains containing multiple genomic modifi - cations were generated by standard yeast genetics . For point muta - tions , plasmids containing the genomic region of ENT5 were mu - tated using QuikChange mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) . The resulting plasmids were linearized and transformed into SEY 6210 , SEY 6211 , and ent5 Δ cells to replace the ENT5 locus . pSL6 and pSL6 - box en - coding wild - type or chc1 - box mutant were described previously ( Collette et al . , 2009 ) .

The Lumencor LED light engine ( 472 / 20 nm for GFP and 543 / 20 or 575 / 20 nm for mCherry ) was used for fluorophore excitation . Filters used for imaging were , for fluorescence resonance energy transfer and high - resolution colocalization , dual - band excitation filter ET / GFP - mCherry ( 59002x ) , excitation dichroic ( 89019bs ) , and emission - side dichroic ( T560lpxr ) ; and for emission filters , ET525 / 50 m and ET595 / 50 m ( Chroma ) . The puncta per cell were quantitated by counting the foci in a single central plane as described previously ( Aoh et al . , 2013 ) . Measurement of fluorescence intensities of endosomal puncta was conducted using a previously described method ( Aravamud - han et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly a 6 × 6 – pixel box was centered on the brightest four pixels of a manually selected spot in the micro - graph . The pixels within this box were treated as the signal region . To estimate the background fluorescence , a larger 8 × 8 – pixel box was placed concentrically with the signal region . The median value of pixel intensities in the outermost ring of this box was used as the background intensity and subtracted from each pixel in the signal region . The fluorescence signal was then calculated as the sum of all 36 pixels in the 6 × 6 box . These operations were ac - complished using a custom graphical user interface written in MATLAB . Intensity analysis was performed on structures from a minimum of 50 cells . Data shown come from analysis performed on a single day ; intensity variance between days was minimal . For time - lapse microscopy , single - plane images were taken every second for a total duration of 2 min . Nonoverlapping structures from multiple cells were identified .
