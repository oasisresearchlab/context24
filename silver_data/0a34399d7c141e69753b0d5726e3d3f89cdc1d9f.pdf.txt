Keywords : women , gender identity , gender stereotypes , feminism , leadership INTRODUCTION Recent years have seen a proliferation of campaigns promoting gender equality . In 2005 , the web designer Gretchen Cawthon launched a website called “Girls Can’t What ? ” . The website sells merchandise featuring women in counter - stereotypic professions : e . g . , women construction workers , women ﬁreﬁghters , and women scientists . In another campaign , in 2011 , the gender studies department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology promoted women’s greater identiﬁcation with feminism . As part of this campaign , members of the university received bags and badges promoting feminism , and were photographed holding signs saying , “This is what a Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations feminist looks like” 1 . Events like these highlight an increasing recognition that gender disparities are detrimental to societies and economies , and suggest approaches that can be taken to address inequality . Our paper investigates two of these approaches : promoting gender counter - stereotypes , and increasing women’s identiﬁcation with feminism , and looks at the consequences they may have to women’s leadership aspirations . Studies suggest that campaigns stressing feminism and counter - stereotypes may help women to resist gender inequality , and that this is most likely in high women identiﬁers . Generally speaking , those who identify strongly with a group are most likely to protest against group - based inequality ( Abrams and Randsley de Moura , 2002 ; Van Zomeren et al . , 2008 ) . However , as research shows , this is not always the case for gender . In fact past studies have found that high levels of gender identiﬁcation associate with a greater susceptibility to threatening stereotypes , increasing the need for interventions targeting high women identiﬁers in particular . This suggests that additional conditions need to be met , to achieve high women identiﬁers’ greater empowerment . While increased identiﬁcation ( e . g . , with women ) makes identity - related issues more relevant to the individual ( Kaiser and Hagiwara , 2011 ) , and can generally energize and motivate action ( Van Knippenberg , 2000 ; Ellemers et al . , 2004 ) , the exact direction of those e ﬀ ects may depend on several moderators . For instance research on group identiﬁcation has shown that its e ﬀ ects are contingent on salient identity cues ( James and Greenberg , 1989 ; Van Knippenberg , 2000 ) , and on speciﬁc identity content ( Becker and Wagner , 2009 ) that may lead individuals to perceive certain actions ( e . g . , in this case , greater leadership aspirations ) as beneﬁcial for oneself or the in - group ( Van Knippenberg , 2000 ) . In consequence , the energizing e ﬀ ect of group identiﬁcation on women’s empowerment should depend on the salience of gender counter - stereotypic ( vs . stereotypic ) cues ( Hoyt and Murphy , 2016 ) , and on the presence of a politicized identiﬁcation , like feminism , which sees resistance to stereotypic content as beneﬁcial ( Van Breen et al . , in review ) . Based on this premise we asked whether counter - stereotype ( vs . stereotype ) salience , and feminist identiﬁcation can moderate the relationship between women’s identiﬁcation and their leadership aspirations . Counter - Stereotypes and Leadership Aspirations Because leadership is typically associated with agency and masculinity ( Sczesny and Kühnen , 2004 ; Hogue and Lord , 2007 ) and womanhood with nurturance and warmth ( Eagly et al . , 1992 ; Eagly and Karau , 2002 ) , prevalent stereotypes create psychological barriers to women’s participation in leadership ( Eagly and Johnson , 1990 ; Rudman and Glick , 1999 ) . Moreover , a heuristic tendency to prefer leaders that are perceived as embodying the ingroup’s image ( Hogg , 2001 ) makes it di ﬃ cult for women to rise to leadership positions in male dominated domains . As such , stereotypes represent a 1 For the website of the Girls Can’t What campaign follow this link : https : / / www . girlscantwhat . com .

Indeed , past research has shown that exposing women participants to gender stereotypes can dampen their leadership aspirations ( Davies et al . , 2005 ) . Likewise , under stereotype salience women report lower perceived performance , diminished leadership aspirations , diminished feeling of belonging , greater perceived task di ﬃ culty , and feelings of inferiority on leadership task ( Davies et al . , 2005 ; Cheryan et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . Additionally , when gender stereotypes are salient women may fear and / or experience backlash when they display leadership behavior ( Eagly and Carli , 2007 ; Rudman and Fairchild , 2007 ; Amanatullah and Morris , 2010 ; Williams and Tiedens , 2015 ) , leading them to avoid leadership roles to an ever greater extent . Conversely , increasing the salience of counter - stereotypes can maintain and even increase leadership aspirations in women ( provided that these counter - stereotypes do not evoke threatening upward comparisons ; Dasgupta and Asgari , 2004 ; Rudman and Phelan , 2010 ; Hoyt and Simon , 2011 ) , and reduce the tendency to focus on in - group similarity ( e . g . , Leicht et al . , 2014 ) . One reason for these e ﬀ ects may be that counter - stereotypic content signals that it is safe , possible , and perhaps even desirable for women to behave in gender counter - stereotypic ways . Taken together , when counter - stereotypes are salient , high identiﬁcation with gender could energize women and increase their leadership aspirations . But women’s behavior is not merely a function of group identiﬁcation and of stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) salience . Other factors are known to help women break out of stereotypic roles , and overcome disadvantage . This research suggests that women’s reactions to gender issues ( e . g . , gender stereotypes ) are determined not only by gender identiﬁcation , but also by identiﬁcation with feminism ( Van Breen et al . , in review , Van Breen et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . Feminist Identiﬁcation and Stereotype Resistance Gender constitutes one of people’s most salient group identities , giving individuals a sense of belonging , and providing social roles and norms to live by ( Tajfel , 1974 ; Banaji et al . , 1993 ; Abrams and Hogg , 2004 ) . But whilst much research on gender and performance focuses on the extent of women’s gender identiﬁcation ( Kaiser and Hagiwara , 2011 ) , how women construe gender identity is rarely considered . Becker and Wagner ( 2009 ) ( also see Condor , 1986 ) proposed that when studying social identities researchers should consider not only the strength of people’s identiﬁcation , but also speciﬁc identity content ( Becker and Wagner , 2009 ) . This issue may be particularly important in the case of gender identiﬁcation , because as research shows , feeling strong ties with other women does not preclude the perpetuation of gender inequality ( Klandermans , 2014 ) . In an attempt to better understand how women construe their identity in relation to gender , recent research distinguished women’s identiﬁcation with other women from a second , orthogonal factor , namely women’s identiﬁcation with feminism . This research demonstrated that identiﬁcation with feminism and with women constitute distinct and unique social identities , and two independent psychological constructs ( Roy et al . , 2007 ; Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 883 Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations Van Breen et al . , in review ) . Extending those ﬁndings , we propose that in addition to women’s gender identiﬁcation , also identiﬁcation with feminism may shape how women react to gender stereotypes . One possibility in particular , is that when stereotypic content is salient , high levels of feminist identiﬁcation will direct high women identiﬁers’ motivation toward actions that are considered beneﬁcial for the group—such as stereotype resistance ( Van Knippenberg , 2000 ; de Lemus et al . , 2013 ; Van Breen et al . , in review ) . This e ﬀ ect could be similar to what is observed in empowered women . For example , women entrepreneurs ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) and women in high power positions ( Hoyt and Blascovich , 2007 ) have been found to perform better than men when gender divisions are salient . A similar resistance e ﬀ ect may also be observed in high feminist identiﬁers . In other words , it is possible that , when stereotypes are salient and feminist identiﬁcation is high , women’s identiﬁcation may associate with greater leadership aspirations . In sum , our literature review suggests that women’s identiﬁcation should associate with greater leadership aspirations through two di ﬀ erent “routes” ( 1 ) under conditions of counter - stereotype salience ( in all research participants ) and ( 2 ) under conditions of stereotype salience , but only provided that feminist identiﬁcation is also high . This Research As highlighted , gender stereotypes ( vs . counter - stereotypes ) and feminist identiﬁcation could moderate the link between women’s identiﬁcation and leadership aspirations . To test this idea we looked at the association between women’s identiﬁcation with other women and their leadership aspirations under conditions of stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) salience , and in high ( vs . low ) feminist identiﬁers . We predicted that when gender counter - stereotypes are salient , women’s identiﬁcation should associate with greater leadership aspiration regardless of feminism , while when gender stereotypes are salient , women’s identiﬁcation would predict greater leadership aspirations contingent on a high level of feminist identiﬁcation . We chose leadership aspirations as our dependent variable because leadership is counter - stereotypic for women and persistence in this domain signals women’s greater resistance to stereotypic content . For exploratory reasons , we also measured e ﬀ ects to participants’ fear of backlash . PRE - TEST STUDY Before running the main study we developed and pre - tested a novel manipulation of stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) salience . We wanted to manipulate attention to stereotypes ( vs . counter - stereotypes ) without evoking threatening social comparisons ( e . g . , asking participants to think of a highly successful female CEO is potentially threatening , and may wipe out the e ﬀ ect of the counter - stereotype ; Hoyt and Simon , 2011 ) . To achieve this , we decided to present participants with neutral images of women and ask them to focus on how the women targets are portrayed in a stereotypic ( vs . counter - stereotypic ) manner . This type of manipulation , where the content of the image is kept constant across both conditions , has the additional beneﬁt of being “clean” and confound - free . Typical manipulations of stereotype and counter - stereotype exposure ask participants to think of di ﬀ erent targets , for instance Angela Merkel vs . Bill Clinton ( Latu et al . , 2013 ) , or a “female mechanic” vs . a “male mechanic” ( Goc ł owska et al . , 2014 ; Leicht et al . , 2014 ) , potentially confounding stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) exposure with other features of the target ( e . g . , gender ) . Our new paradigm avoids these potential limitations , allowing us to assess the impact of stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) salience and nothing else . We pretested four images of women ( available from authors upon request ) . Image A depicted a woman standing at a large window , image B a woman in front of a laptop holding a cell phone and a baby , image C a woman eating a salad in front of a computer , and imaged D a woman aircraft pilot with a military aircraft in the background . Next , we asked several questions about the target’s stereotypicality and femininity . The ﬁrst goal of the pretest was to select ( for the main study ) two images that are most neutral in terms of stereotypicality and femininity . Using neutral imagery would ensure that the targets used in our manipulation are relevant to all research participants , and that they can be perceived as both stereotypic as counter - stereotypic , depending on instructions used . The second goal was to test the e ﬀ ectiveness of our new stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) attention manipulation . Asking participants to describe the stereotypic ( vs . counter - stereotypic ) features of the ( relatively neutral ) female targets , should change participants’ perceptions of those targets in line with the manipulation . Most likely , focusing on stereotypic ( vs . counter - stereotypic ) content should amplify ratings of stereotypicality and femininity . Competence , likability and attractiveness , emotional reactions and task di ﬃ culty could also potentially be a ﬀ ected , and were thus measured as well . Methods US based MTurk workers ( N = 259 ; 101 male , 157 female , 1 gender not speciﬁed ) took part in an online survey ( M time = 12 min , $ 1 reward ) 2 . Demographic questions indicated that 12 % of participants were students , 13 % were self - employed , 59 % were full or part - time employed , 10 % were homemakers , and 6 % were jobseekers . We also inquired about gender distribution in the research participants’ main organization ( company , university etc . ) . According to participants’ estimates , among “ordinary” workers with no managerial responsibilities 53 % were female , among lower and middle management employees 48 % were female , while among upper management employees 37 % were female . Those numbers seem to conﬁrm the general observation that women are underrepresented in upper management positions . At the beginning of the study participants were allocated randomly to one condition in a 4 ( Image : A vs . B vs . C vs . D ) by 2 ( Attention : counter - stereotypic vs . stereotypic ) between - participants design . Within each condition we asked participants 2 During study completion 16 participants failed attention checks , and their data were excluded from further analysis , leaving a ﬁnal sample of 242 participants ( 96 male , 145 female , 1 gender not speciﬁed ; M age = 38 . 15 , SD = 12 . 74 ) . Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 883 Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations to describe the image they were presented with for at least 90 s . In the stereotypic condition we asked participants to describe the image focusing on its “traditional and female gender stereotypic aspects” , whilst in the counter - stereotypic condition we asked participants to focus on “non - traditional and female gender counter - stereotypic aspects” . After participants described the image , we asked about their perception of the task and of the stimuli . All items were measured on a 7 - point Likert - type scale ( 1 , not at all ; 7 , very much ) . To measure target stereotypicality we used three items : traditional , stereotypic or contrary to what society expects ( α = 0 . 73 ) . Target femininity was measured across various domains ( e . g . , behavior , posture , fashion ; α = 0 . 87 ) . For exploratory purposes we asked participants to indicate how attractive , how competent and how likeable the target was ( we treated those as separate variables ) , and to rate positive ( e . g . , happy , enthusiastic , α = 0 . 89 ) and negative ( e . g . , disappointed , anxious , α = 0 . 90 ) emotions evoked by the target . Finally , we also asked participants to indicate how easy or pleasant the task was ( e . g . , How much did you enjoy describing the image ? How easy it was to describe the image ? ; 5 - item measure , α = 0 . 85 ) . Results Table 1 represents mean ratings and pairwise comparisons of the four types of images . Images di ﬀ ered signiﬁcantly in terms of stereotypicality [ F ( 3 , 238 ) = 29 . 48 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 27 ] and femininity [ F ( 3 , 238 ) = 25 . 76 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 25 ] . Pairwise comparisons ( post - hoc LSD test ) showed that image C ( woman eating a salad ) was perceived as overly stereotypic and feminine , while image D ( woman pilot ) was overly counter - stereotypic and relatively low on femininity . Based on those results we decided to only use Image A ( woman in front of the window ) and Image B ( woman with baby and laptop ) in the main study . Table 2 represents mean image ratings in the counter - stereotypic and stereotypic condition . As we hoped for , images in the stereotypic ( vs . counter - stereotypic ) condition were perceived as more stereotypic [ F ( 1 , 240 ) = 21 . 78 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 08 ] and more feminine [ F ( 1 , 240 ) = 12 . 43 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 05 ] . Additional exploratory analyses demonstrated that the stereotypic condition decreased ratings of competence [ F ( 1 , 240 ) = 8 . 07 , p = 0 . 005 , η 2 = 0 . 03 ] , and positive emotions evoked by the target [ F ( 1 , 240 ) = 7 . 93 , p = 0 . 005 , η 2 = 0 . 03 ] . The manipulation had no e ﬀ ect on ratings of attractiveness or likability or on negative emotions and the perceived task di ﬃ culty . Overall , this set of ﬁndings suggests that our manipulation changed perceptions of targets in line with gender stereotypic ( vs . counter - stereotypic ) content . In addition , targets in the counter - stereotypic condition evoked greater ( positive and negative ) emotion and were seen as more competent . MAIN STUDY Having pre - tested our manipulation and selected the two most neutral images , we set out to run the main study . We asked participants to attend to stereotypic ( or counter - stereotypic ) features of the selected stimuli , and measured leadership aspirations and identiﬁcation with women and with feminism .

Pretest ratings represent aggregated ratings of four images ( A , B , C , and D ) while Study 1 ratings represent aggregated ratings of two images selected from the pretest ( A , B ) . Our goal was to test whether the three - way interaction of women’s identiﬁcation , feminist identiﬁcation and stereotype salience would predict women’s leadership aspirations . Methods Participants , Design , and Procedure Using MTurk , 238 3 female US based workers ( M age = 36 . 06 , SD = 12 . 23 ) were recruited to take part in an online study on “image perception and description , ” and were allocated randomly to the stereotypic or counter - stereotypic attention condition . The questionnaire took , on average , 31 min to complete , and participation was rewarded with $ 1 . 5 . Participants’ professional status was the following : 9 % students , 12 % self - employed , 55 % full or part - time employed , 16 % homemaker , 8 % jobseeker . Also in this sample , gender distribution was perceived as being unequal in the highest ranks in the organization . Among “ordinary” workers with no managerial responsibilities 51 % were thought to be female , among lower and middle management employees 49 % were female , while among upper management employees 38 % were reported to be female . After completing informed consent participants were presented with one of our two selected images . We used and 3 Thirty participants failed the two attention checks included in our experiment and were therefore excluded from our sample , leaving us with a ﬁnal sample of 208 participantsforanalysis ( M age = 36 . 60 , SD = 12 . 46 ) . Conductingtheanalyseswith the full dataset did not change the signiﬁcance of the results . counter - balanced ( between - participants ) two images to ensure greater external validity and generalizability of our ﬁndings 4 . As in the pre - test study we asked participants to identify image elements portraying the woman in a stereotypic / traditional or non - stereotypic / non - traditional way . Participants had to spend at least 90 s on this task ( more time was allowed as well ) . We then measured leadership aspirations . We instructed research participants to imagine a workplace scenario and indicate to what extent they would like to and would feel comfortable taking a leadership role in that situations . For exploratory purposes we also measured participants’ fear of backlash . Both variables were measured in a counterbalanced way , to account for order e ﬀ ects . Following our manipulation and the workplace scenario , we measured several individual di ﬀ erence moderators and covariates . This part of the questionnaire inquired about participants’ gender , their identiﬁcation with women and with feminism , and several individual di ﬀ erence measures related to feminism . To account for individual di ﬀ erences in people’s beliefs about gender ( Morton et al . , 2009 ; Napier et al . , 2010 ; Okimoto and Brescoll , 2010 ) , we asked participants to ﬁll in measures of gender essentialism , gender system justiﬁcation , benevolent sexism and liberal feminist attitudes ( Glick and Fiske , 1996 ; Jost and Kay , 2005 ; Napier et al . , 2010 ; Connelly and Heesacker , 2012 ; Brescoll et al . , 2013 ; de Lemus et al . , 2015 ) . We wanted to use those measures as covariates , to see whether the e ﬀ ects uncovered are speciﬁcally due to feminist identiﬁcation , rather than merely feminist beliefs . If e ﬀ ects of feminist identiﬁcation ( and it’s interaction with other variables ) held regardless of other gender related constructs , this would indicate that our e ﬀ ects are speciﬁc to feminist identiﬁcation . Because this part of the questionnaire came after the manipulation , we took precautions to ensure that participants report their stable beliefs and level of identiﬁcation . Namely , before measuring identiﬁcation and gender - based beliefs we instructed participants ( several times ) to “express to what extent you generally agree with the statements below” and to provide answers based on “your attitudes , beliefs and experiences most of the time in your everyday life . ” Furthermore , we also inspected the data to see whether the manipulation had any e ﬀ ects on the individual di ﬀ erences : none e ﬀ ects were uncovered ( p s > 0 . 52 ) . This ﬁnding is consistent with that of other research measuring identiﬁcation after the manipulation ( Jimenez - Moya et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , we reminded participants of the stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) salience manipulation , and asked them to complete the same measures as in the pre - test , except that this time we treated stereotypicality and femininity as manipulation checks . Dependent Variables All measures in the study were captured using a Likert - type scale with 1 indicating “not at all” and 7 indicating “very much . ” For correlations of all the measures in this study see Table 3 . 4 The study also included a third factor : guided ( vs . unguided ) focus . In the guided condition participants were asked to focus on speciﬁc aspects of the image while focusing on stereotypic or counter - stereotypic features . In the unguided condition no speciﬁc instructions were given . This factor is of little theoretical signiﬁcance , and did not emerge as a signiﬁcant predictor .

We embedded the leadership aspirations and fear of backlash measures in an imagined work scenario . First , we asked participants to think of a place where they frequently are , or have been involved in group projects . We asked them to focus on a place that is most current and relevant to what they do , and to write the name of this place down in the box provided . Common responses given by participants were “work , ” “o ﬃ ce , ” “school , ” “university , ” “college , ” or “church” . On the next page we referred to this location , and asked participants to imagine the following situation : “On a typical day at [ location name provided by research participant ] you were selected to be part of a new project team , responsible for completing a speciﬁc task . You know who your team members are , and you know that all of you have similar expertise and experience on this type of project . ” We then asked participants to answer several questions about their leadership aspirations and fear of backlash in the context of this event . Leadership aspirations were measured by asking participant to indicate on 13 statements whether they would like to take on the leadership role within this group ( e . g . , “I would like to be selected as a leader for this task . ” ) . These statements were mostly self - created , with a few borrowed from previous research ( α = 0 . 95 ) ( Hoyt and Simon , 2011 ) . For an overview of the items see Appendix at the end of this paper . Fear of backlash was also assessed within this imaginary work workplace scenario , however , rather than assessing whether participants would like to take on the leadership role , we asked about participants’ level of ( dis ) comfort in leadership positions . Using four items borrowed from previous research ( Moss - Racusin and Rudman , 2010 ) we asked each participant how ( un ) comfortable she would feel being appointed as a leader ( α = 80 ; e . g . , “I would be concerned that I might be disliked . ” ) . For fear of backlash , the instruction additionally stressed that the research participant was the group member with the highest expertise for the task . Moderators Identiﬁcation with women and with feminists was measured using two parallel sets of items . Three items measured participants’ identiﬁcation with women , ( e . g . , “Being a woman is an important part of who I am” ; α = 0 . 82 ) , and three similar items were used to measure identiﬁcation with feminism , replacing the word “woman” with “feminist , ” α = 0 . 99 ( de Lemus et al . , 2015 ) . Covariates Gender System Justiﬁcation ( GSJ ) , Gender Essentialism ( GE ) , Benevolent Sexism ( BS ) were measured using well - established measures with good reliability , α GSJ = 0 . 72 , α BS = 0 . 91 , α GE = 0 . 83 . ( Glick and Fiske , 1996 ; Jost and Kay , 2005 ; Okimoto and Brescoll , 2010 ) . In order to distinguish between identiﬁcation with feminism , and attitudes toward feminism , we also asked participants to ﬁll in the 14 item Liberal Feminist Attitudes and Ideology Scale ( LFAIS ; α = 0 . 89 ) . Here participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed with statements such as “A woman should have the same job opportunities as a man . ” ( Levonian Morgan , 1996 ) . Manipulation Checks Using items identical to those in the pretest we measured stereotypicality ( α = 0 . 58 ) , femininity ( α = 0 . 85 ) , competence ( one item ) , likeability ( one item ) , and attractiveness ( one item ) of the model as well as positive ( α = 0 . 91 ) and negative emotions ( α = 0 . 91 ) , and task di ﬃ culty Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 6 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 883 Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations ( α = 0 . 85 ) . For correlations between all measures see Table 3 . RESULTS Collinearity Check Gender Identity , Feminist Identity , and Feminist Attitudes Our hypotheses were tested with moderated regression analysis in PROCESS macro ( Hayes , 2013 ) . Before running these analyses , we conducted a collinearity check on our two identity predictors and a content related co - variate of feminist attitudes . This would ensure that gender identiﬁcation , feminist identiﬁcation , and feminist attitudes are distinct constructs . First , we conducted a Factor Analysis with all items from all scales included in the analysis . With a varimax rotation , the analysis revealed a four factor structure explaining 70 . 45 % of variance . The ﬁrst two factors were formed out of the liberal feminist attitudes scale , with all positive phrased items loading on Factor 1 and all negative phrased items loading on Factor 2 . The third factor consisted out of the three gender identiﬁcation items , whereas the fourth factor consisted out of the three feminist identiﬁcation items . Correlation analyses ( see Table 3 ) additionally revealed that the liberal feminist attitude scale was related to feminist identiﬁcation , but not with women’s identiﬁcation or leadership aspirations . In summary , all three scales formed distinct factors that corresponded with our variables , gender identiﬁcation , feminist identiﬁcation , and liberal feminist attitudes , none of the items cross loaded , and correlations were non - signiﬁcant between our two predictor variables , gender identiﬁcation and feminist identiﬁcation . This conﬁrms that feminist identiﬁcation and women’s identiﬁcation are distinct factors , and that that including these variables as predictors and covariates in a regression analysis is not problematic ( Antonakis et al . , 2010 ) . Manipulation Check Results of the manipulation check were very similar to what we found in the pretest . Table 1 ( bottom panel ) shows mean ratings across the two types of images used . As in the pretest , image A and image B did not di ﬀ er signiﬁcantly in terms of stereotypicality or femininity . More importantly to our argument , mean image ratings in the counter - stereotypic and stereotypic condition ( Table 2 ) demonstrated that the manipulation worked as intended . Namely , images in the stereotypic condition were perceived as more stereotypic [ F ( 1 , 206 ) = 49 . 06 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 19 ] and more feminine [ F ( 1 , 206 ) = 14 . 96 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 07 ] . The targets in the stereotypic condition were also seen as less competent [ F ( 1 , 206 ) = 8 . 64 , p = 0 . 004 , η 2 = 0 . 04 ] , and elicited less positive emotions [ F ( 1 , 206 ) = 7 . 26 , p = 0 . 008 , η 2 = 0 . 03 ] . Thus , as intended , our manipulation changed perceptions of targets in line with gender stereotypic ( vs . counter - stereotypic ) content . Hypothesis Test The main goal of our study was to examine under what conditions women’s gender identiﬁcation links with greater leadership aspirations . We tested this idea using the PROCESS macro Model 3 ( Preacher and Hayes , 2008 ) . We entered leadership aspirations as the dependent variable , and gender identiﬁcation , feminist identiﬁcation and attention ( 0 = attention to counter - stereotypic information , 1 = attention to stereotypic information ) as predictor variables .

Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 7 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 883 Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations Leadership Aspirations The analysis revealed a signiﬁcant main e ﬀ ect for gender identiﬁcation , B = 0 . 32 , SE = 0 . 13 , t ( 200 ) = 2 . 50 , p = 0 . 013 95 % CI [ 0 . 07 ; 0 . 57 ] , showing that identiﬁcation with gender was positively associated with leadership aspirations ( also see Table 4 , left panel ) . There were no main e ﬀ ects of feminist identiﬁcation and attention on leadership aspirations ( all p’s > 0 . 46 ) . The e ﬀ ect of gender identiﬁcation was qualiﬁed by a signiﬁcant three - way interaction between gender identiﬁcation , feminist identiﬁcation and attention , B = 0 . 28 , SE = 0 . 11 , t ( 200 ) = 2 . 48 , p = 0 . 01 95 % CI [ 0 . 06 ; 0 . 51 ] , which signiﬁcantly increased the total amount of variance explained , R 2 = 0 . 07 , p = 0 . 03 ; R 2 — change = 0 . 03 , p = 0 . 01 . To break down the interaction term , we split the sample by condition and entered feminist identiﬁcation and women’s identiﬁcation as the independent variables , and leadership aspirations as the dependent variable ( see Figure 1 ) . In the counter - stereotypic condition there was a signiﬁcant main e ﬀ ect of women’s identiﬁcation : B = 0 . 42 , SE = 0 . 18 , t ( 101 ) = 2 . 33 , p = 0 . 02 95 % CI [ 0 . 06 ; 0 . 77 ] , but feminist identiﬁcation and the interaction terms did not emerge as signiﬁcant predictors ( p s > 0 . 22 ) . Notably , inspecting the standardized regression coe ﬃ cients revealed that the e ﬀ ect of women’s identiﬁcation on leadership aspirations was higher in the counter - stereotypic condition ( β = 0 . 239 ) , than in the overall sample ( β = 0 . 186 ) . In other words , women who were highly identiﬁed with other women ( vs . those who were not ) showed increased leadership aspirations after attending to counter - stereotypic information . FIGURE 1 | Leadership aspirations as a function of feminist and women identiﬁcation in the counter - stereotypic condition ( upper ) and in the stereotypic condition ( lower ) . In the stereotypic condition the signiﬁcant three way interaction was explained by a two way interaction between gender identiﬁcation and feminist identiﬁcation : B = 0 . 18 , SE = 0 . 07 , t ( 99 ) = 2 . 34 , p = 0 . 02 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 03 ; 0 . 33 ] . When further broken down , this signiﬁcant interaction in the stereotypic condition resulted in one signiﬁcant slope . Gender identiﬁcation was associated with higher leadership aspirations in the stereotypic condition , however this was only the case if identiﬁcation with feminism was also high , B = 0 . 68 , SE = 0 . 26 , t ( 99 ) = 2 . 66 , p = 0 . 01 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 16 ; 1 . 20 ] . Put di ﬀ erently , while under counter - stereotype salience women’s identiﬁcation associated with greater leadership aspirations regardless of feminism , under stereotype salience women’s identiﬁcation associated with greater leadership aspirations only when feminist identiﬁcation was high . To test for the robustness of those results , we re - run our analyses with Gender System Justiﬁcation , Benevolent Sexism , Gender Essentialism , positive and negative emotions , and the Liberal Feminist Attitudes Scale as covariates ( See Table 4 , right panel ) . When controlling for these variables , the e ﬀ ect of the three - way interaction term of stereotype exposure and women and feminist identiﬁcation was still signiﬁcant : B = 0 . 33 , SE = 0 . 11 , t ( 194 ) = 2 . 86 , p < 0 . 01 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 10 ; 0 . 55 ] . Fear of Backlash For exploratory purposes we conducted identical analyses with fear of backlash as a dependent variable . The analyses revealed a signiﬁcant main e ﬀ ect of feminist identiﬁcation on fear of backlash , B = 0 . 09 , SE = 0 . 04 , t ( 200 ) = 2 . 45 , p = 0 . 02 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 02 ; 0 . 17 ] , so that higher feminist identiﬁcation was associated with greater fear of backlash . There was also a marginal negative e ﬀ ect of gender identiﬁcation , B = − 0 . 20 , SE = 0 . 11 , t ( 200 ) = − 1 . 90 , p = 0 . 06 , 95 % CI [ − 0 . 42 ; 0 . 011 ] . Attention to stereotypes was not signiﬁcant , and there were no signiﬁcant interaction e ﬀ ects ( all ps > 0 . 26 ) . GENERAL DISCUSSION Counter - stereotypes and feminism are thought to inspire and motivate women to challenge gender inequality , and are often used in public campaigns and interventions . Could such means be helpful in raising the leadership aspirations of highly identiﬁed women ? To answer this question we tested whether stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) exposure and feminist identiﬁcation moderate the e ﬀ ect of gender identiﬁcation on women’s leadership aspirations . A review of the literature suggested that high gender identiﬁcation should associate with greater leadership aspirations ( 1 ) under conditions of counter - stereotype salience ( in all research participants ) and ( 2 ) under conditions of stereotype salience , conditional on greater levels of feminist identiﬁcation . Those predictions were based on what we know about women’s reactions to non - threatening counter - stereotypes ( Hoyt and Simon , 2011 ; Latu et al . , 2013 ) , and based on the literature on stereotype resistance ( de Lemus et al . , 2015 ; Van Breen et al . , in review ) . In line with these expectations we uncovered that stereotype ( vs . counter - stereotype ) salience and participant’s identiﬁcation with women and with feminism Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 8 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 883 Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations interacted to predict female participants’ leadership aspirations . The three - way interaction term was further explained by a signiﬁcant e ﬀ ect of women’s identiﬁcation ( regardless of feminist identiﬁcation ) on leadership aspirations in the counter - stereotypic condition , and by a signiﬁcant e ﬀ ect of women’s identiﬁcation on leadership aspirations in the stereotypic condition ( but only in high feminist identiﬁers ) . These ﬁndings are in line with recent research showing that gender identiﬁcation and feminist identiﬁcation are orthogonal identity constructs , and that women’s reactions to gender stereotypes and to counter - stereotypes depend the interaction of these two identities ( de Lemus et al . , 2015 ; Van Breen et al . , in review ) . Our research extends those ﬁndings by showing that women’s and feminist identiﬁcation interact with stereotype salience to a ﬀ ect behavioral intentions such as leadership aspirations . Limitations and Future Directions There are a number of limitations regarding the operationalization of theoretical constructs , as well as the generalizability of the research results . For example , leadership aspirations were measured using self - report , rather than actual leadership behavior . Agreeing with this criticism , we perceive the present set of ﬁndings as a preliminary step , rather than a deﬁnitive statement , about the role that identiﬁcation and stereotypes ( vs . counter - stereotypes ) play in women’s leadership aspirations . We advocate that in the future more research is needed to investigate whether the e ﬀ ects found in the present study carry over to women’s performance on actual leadership tasks , such as tasks that require of women to lead on a team project , or to presenting a speech in front of their team members ( Latu et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , more research on this topic could be conducted in organizational settings and in active women leaders . For example looking at whether in traditional organizations ( where gender stereotypes abound ) women who endorse progressive identiﬁcation are more often promoted to leadership roles would garner more support for and extend the present set of ﬁndings . Although correlational in nature , this type of test would suggest that not only do high women high feminist identiﬁers have greater leadership aspirations , but that they also successfully realize these aspirations . This type of test would allow for a better understanding of the extent to which the processes investigated herein can also be found in “real - life” settings . Theoretical and Practical Implications The current ﬁndings have several implications for theory and practice . First of all , they demonstrate , in line with other social identity research , that higher levels of identiﬁcation with one’s group can fuel individuals’ motivation , but that the direction of those e ﬀ ects depends on variables related to identity salience and to one’s perception of what is beneﬁcial to oneself and the in - group . In line with this reasoning , our results show that the e ﬀ ect of gender identiﬁcation apparent in our study is contingent on the salience of counter - stereotypic or stereotypic identity cues ( James and Greenberg , 1989 ; Worchel et al . , 1998 ; Van Knippenberg , 2000 ; Hoyt and Murphy , 2016 ) , and on a politicized identiﬁcation ( feminism ) that encourages resistance toward stereotypic norms ( Van Breen et al . , in review ) . Altogether these ﬁndings support the idea that counter - stereotypes and feminism can help increase women’s aspirations , and that this is especially the case for women highly identiﬁed with their in - group . Secondly , consistent with recent research on women’s identiﬁcation ( Van Breen et al . , in review ) , our study supports the idea that gender identiﬁcation and feminist identiﬁcation are unique constructs , and that they can shape women’s reactions to stereotypic or counter - stereotypic information . Van Breen et al . ( in review ) proposed that whilst some women have a more traditional gender identiﬁcation , and identify highly with women , but not with feminism ( “traditional women” ) , others have a more progressive understanding of their gender identity , and identify highly with both women and with feminism ( “dual identiﬁers” ) , only with feminism ( “distinctive feminists” ) , or with none ( “low identiﬁers” ) . Interpreting our results through this lens suggests that the distinction between gender and feminist identiﬁcation is especially important in a salient gender stereotypic context . Namely , in this context we see that when stereotypes are salient , progressive women ( who identify highly with women and with feminism ) have greater leadership aspirations than distinctive identiﬁers ( who identifying highly with feminism but not with women ) . This ﬁnding is very interesting as it opens up new interpretations on the role of group identiﬁcation in stereotypic contexts . Stereotype threat literature has shown some pessimistic indications that highly identiﬁed women are at more risk from stereotype threat ( Kaiser and Hagiwara , 2011 ) . While we believe this to be true , we also think that gender identiﬁcation can have beneﬁcial e ﬀ ects for women—provided that it is supplemented with some kind of belief , or a second type of identity , that inoculates women against the debilitating e ﬀ ects of stereotype salience . The present set of ﬁndings suggests that when feminist identiﬁcation is high , stereotypic content fuels leadership aspirations amongst those who are strongly identiﬁed with the group . We believe that this ﬁnding opens up a new and exciting possibility for stereotype threat research : that fostering a feminist identiﬁcation can inoculate women against threatening stereotypic content . Moreover , the current set of ﬁndings may even suggest that feminist identiﬁcation promotes leadership aspirations , as much as counter - stereotypes do . This ﬁnding emphasizes the importance of resistance to stereotypes as a motivated response to protect the interests of the group ( de Lemus et al . , 2015 ; Van Breen et al . , in review ) . At this point in the discussion an inquisitive reader may ask why , in the present study , women’s identiﬁcation was related to leadership aspirations ( contingent on counter - stereotype salience and on feminism ) , but feminism was not . Since feminism is often associated with a greater readiness for collective action ( Bliuc et al . , 2007 ; Klandermans , 2014 ) , and with the endorsement of women in gender counter - stereotypic roles , one might expect a link between women’s feminist identiﬁcation and their greater leadership aspirations . Our study , on the other hand , shows that feminist identiﬁers do endorse greater feminist beliefs ( lower gender system justiﬁcation , gender essentialism and benevolent sexism , and higher level of liberal feminist attitudes ) , but not greater leadership aspirations . In fact , as the correlations in Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 9 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 883 Leicht et al . Counter - Stereotypes , Feminism and Women’s Leadership Aspirations Table 3 indicate , leadership aspirations are not correlated with any of the feminist beliefs or gender beliefs . The only correlation that emerges with gender content is that of a positive relation between leadership aspirations and gender system justiﬁcation . In addition , the data suggests that high leadership aspirations associate with greater perceived liking of the task , greater amount of positive emotions evoked by our image stimuli , and with greater ratings of model likeability . This may suggest that women with greater leadership aspirations are more dominant , conﬁdent and comfortable leaders , and that they see things in a more positive light . Thus , greater leadership aspirations are not directly linked to feminist beliefs , and can even lead to support for greater gender inequality . This observation is consistent with the “Queen Bee” phenomenon , showing that female leaders can sometimes be perpetrators of discrimination ( e . g . , Derks et al . , 2015 ) , and our data seem to support this point . Thus , if anything , leadership aspirations probably reﬂect one’s resilience in light of societally imposed norms or barriers , rather than a politicized motivation to challenge gender inequality . Next to these more theoretical contributions , our research also has several practical implications . It highlights the beneﬁts of recent endeavors of policy makers and practitioners to increase greater the salience of gender counter - stereotypic behavior and women’s identiﬁcation with feminism . While most research focuses on the role of feminism to collective action , hereby we extend the beneﬁts of feminist identiﬁcation to organizational outcomes , such as leadership aspirations . Overall , our ﬁndings indicate that having a more progressive gender identity , that combines identiﬁcation with women and with feminism , could have positive e ﬀ ects women’s career progression , by motivating them to increase engagement in gender counter - stereotypic domains such as leadership .
