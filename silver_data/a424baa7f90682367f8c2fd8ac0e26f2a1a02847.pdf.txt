Although Rac1 recognized as a key player in the formation of lamellipodia , the molecular mechanisms underlying lamellipodial motility are not fully understood . Optogenetic technology enabled us to spatiotemporally control the activity of photoactivatable Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 ) in living cells . Using this system , we revealed the role of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) in Rac1 - dependent lamellipodial motility in PC - 3 prostate cancer cells . Through local blue laser irradiation of PA - Rac1 - expressing cells , lamellipodial motility was reversibly induced . First , outward extension of a lamellipodium parallel to the substratum was observed . The extended lamellipodium then showed ruffling activity at the periphery . Notably , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and WAVE2 were localized in the extending lamellipodium in a PI3K - dependent manner . We confirmed that the inhibition of PI3K activity greatly suppressed lamellipodial extension , while the ruffling activity was less affected . These results suggest that Rac1 - induced lamellipodial motility consists of two distinct activities , PI3K - dependent outward extension and PI3K - independent ruffling .

Therefore , an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell migration is important for developing new therapeutic strategies for preventing tumor invasion and metasta - sis . Cell migration involves the processes of polarized cellular protrusion and adhesion in the direction of movement , cell contraction , disassembly of adhesive foci , and retraction at the periphery of the cell’s trailing edge [ 1 ] . During the tumor cell migration that is associated with cancer metastasis and invasion , metastatic cells exhibit drastic changes in shape . This deformation is caused by actin cytoskeletal remodeling , which is regulated by Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1 . Rho family GTPases behave as molecular switches , cycling between active GTP - bound forms and inactive GDP - bound forms . Rho family GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and inactivated by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) [ 3 ] . Rac1 , a member of the Rho family GTPases , leads to the production of sheet - like protrusions referred to as lamellipodia or membrane ruffles , while Cdc42 , another member of the Rho family , creates spike - like protrusions called filopodia [ 3 ] . Rac1 is hyperactivated in metastatic prostate cancer cells [ 4 ] . Additionally , the inhibition of Rac1 activity blocks the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells [ 5 ] . These studies suggest that Rac1 - mediated lamellipodial formation plays an important role in prostate cancer metastasis . To date , the expression of Rac1 mutants such as the constitutively active ( CA ) Rac1Q61L and the dominant negative ( DN ) Rac1T17N has been widely used for investigating the involvement of Rac1 in lamellipodial formation and ruffling [ 6 ] . However , the cell phenotype data obtained using Rac1 mutants must be interpreted with caution . Due to the effects of irreversible , permanent and global expression in the cells , it is hard to say that the phenotypes of cells expressing Rac1 mutants exactly reflect the protein’s action as a molecular switch . To elucidate the precise role of the spatiotemporal activation of Rac1 , Wu et al . [ 7 , 8 ] recently developed a photo - activatable Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 ) system by fusing a light - oxygen - voltage ( LOV ) domain and a carboxy - terminal helical extension ( J a ) sequence to the amino terminus of a constitutively active Rac1 . LOV is a protein light - switch domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 . In the dark , the flavin - binding LOV domain interacts with J a and blocks the effector binding site of PA - Rac1 by configuring into its closed conformation . Irradiation with light at 400 – 500 nm light induces the dissociation of LOV domain and J a helix , and leads to Rac1 activation . This photo - induced activation is reversible . Using this system , localized Rac1 activation was shown to be sufficient to induce cell motility and determine the direction of cell movement [ 7 , 8 ] . PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e97749 The relationship between Rac1 and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) in the formation of lamellipodia is complicated because PI3K functions both upstream and downstream of Rac1 [ 9 ] . Phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) is known to be bind Rac GEFs and then accelerate actin polymerization through Rac1 activation [ 10 ] . Additionally , a positive feedback loop has been reported between PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and Rac for cell polarity during eukaryotic chemotaxis [ 11 , 12 ] . However , in the regulation of cell protrusion and polarity , reports regarding the function of PI3K downstream of Rac1 are mixed [ 13 , 14 ] . Thus , the precise role of PI3K downstream of Rac1 remains a controversial issue . To clarify the relevance of PI3K to Rac1 - dependent lamellipo - dial motility , we applied the PA - Rac1 system to prostate cancer cells . Photomanipulation of PA - Rac1 activity using a blue laser enabled us to distinguish two lamellipodial motile processes in living cells : lamellipodial extension and peripheral ruffling . Notably , we found that PI3K inhibitors suppressed the initiation of lamellipodial extension but had little effect on peripheral ruffling . The present study revealed that Rac1 - dependent lamellipodial motile processes consist of two dissociable activities : PI3K - dependent lamellipodial outward extension and PI3K - independent peripheral ruffling . Materials and Methods Reagents and cDNA Constructs Fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and RPMI - 1640 were obtained from the Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . The X - tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent was acquired from Roche Diagnostic Systems ( Basel , Switzerland ) . The other reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals ( Osaka , Japan ) or Nacalai Tesque ( Kyoto , Japan ) , unless otherwise indicated . pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1Q61L ( plasmid # 22027 ) and pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1 T17N ( plasmid # 22029 ) were ob - tained from Addgene ( Cambridge , MA ) . Dr . Joel A . Swanson ( University of Michigan ) kindly provided the pmCitrine - AKT - pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) and pmCitrine - Rac1Q61L . The pEGFP - N1 - WAVE2 constructs were generous gifts of Dr . Tadaomi Takenawa ( Kobe University ) . Cell Culture and Transfection PC - 3 human prostate cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) and were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10 % heat - inactivated FBS , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin . The cells were maintained at 37 u C in a humidified 5 % CO 2 incubator . For live - cell imaging , the cells were seeded on 25 mm coverslips in 35 mm dishes at a density of 2 . 0 6 10 4 cells / dish and were incubated overnight before transfection . The X - tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent was used for plasmid transfection according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1Q61L was added to the 35 mm dishes . In the co - transfection treatments , 0 . 01 – 0 . 5 m g of the appropriate plasmids was added to the 35 mm dishes together with 0 . 3 m g of the PA - Rac1 plasmid . Figure 1 .

We used 50 m M LY294002 ( Sigma ) , 100 nM wortmannin ( Sigma ) , and 1 m M ZSTK474 ( Active Biochemicals ) as PI3K inhibitors . LY294002 and wortmannin , which are pan - PI3K inhibitors , are widely used as tools for investigating diverse signal transduction processes involving PI3K . ZSTK474 also inhibits all four PI3K isoforms but does not inhibit PI3K - related kinases such as mTOR and DNA - dependent protein kinase . These inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , stored at 2 20 u C , and applied to the cells at the indicated final concentrations . These inhibitors were usually added to cells 30 min before photoactiva - tion , but in some experiments , they were added during photoac - tivation . For the control treatments , 0 . 1 % DMSO was applied to the cells . Photoactivation and Live - cell Imaging At 12 – 24 hours after transfection , the culture medium was replaced with Ringer’s buffer ( RB ) consisting of 155 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM glucose , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , and 0 . 5 mg / ml bovine serum albumin . The 25 mm cover slips were placed in an RB - filled chamber on a 37 u C thermo - controlled stage ( Tokai Hit INU - ONI , Shizuoka , Japan ) . Photoactivation of PA - Rac1 and live - cell imaging were performed using an Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope equipped with a laser scanning unit ( LSM700 , Zeiss ) , as previously described [ 15 ] . To photoactivate PA - Rac1 , the indicated area of the prostate cancer cells expressing mCherry - PA - Rac1 was repeatedly irradiated using a 5 mW 445 nm laser at 0 . 2 % power for the indicated periods in a photobleaching mode . Live - cell images were acquired through a 63x Plan - Apochromat / N . A . 1 . 4 lens every 15 sec using a 10 mW 555 nm laser at 0 . 5 % – 2 . 0 % power to obtain mCherry fluorescence and bright - field phase - contrast images . To visualize PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or WAVE2 , the cells were cotransfected with pmCherry - PA - Rac1 and the pmCitrine - AKT - PH domain or pEGFP - WAVE2 , respectively . EGFP or mCitrine fluorescence images were acquired only at the first and last time points to avoid unintended photoactivation by the 488 nm laser , as this excitation wavelength slightly overlaps with the photoactivation spectrum [ 8 ] . We adjusted the power of 488 nm laser as low as possible , so that the acquisition of the first frame by the laser would not impact PA - Rac1 activity . Time - lapse images using phase - contrast and fluorescence microscopy were taken at 15 sec intervals and assembled into QuickTime movies using Zen 2009 software ( Carl Zeiss ) . Kymograph analyses were performed using MetaMorph imaging software ( Molecular Devices ) . The image data presented here are representative of the results of at least three independent experiments . Quantitative Image Analysis For quantitative image analysis of the lamellipodial extension due to PA - Rac1 photoactivation in the absence or presence of PI3K inhibitors , we took measurements of cell area increases by subtracting the areas of the cells before photoactivation from those after photoactivation using MetaMorph imaging software . For quantitative analysis of mCitrine - AKT - PH and EGFP - WAVW2 recruitment to photoactivated areas , the fluorescence intensities of the regions of interest were measured using MetaMorph imaging software . The fluorescence intensities of mCitrine and EGFP after 5 min of photoactivation were compared with the fluorescence intensities in the corresponding area before photoactivation using at least 16 cells .

Using the MetaMorph imaging system , the maximum diameters of the cells expressing Rac1Q61L were measured before and after the drug treatments to evaluate the effect of PI3K inhibition on the extended lamellipodial . Similarly , the peripheral ruffles per cell were counted using a fluorescence microscope to evaluate the impact of PI3K inhibition on ruffling activity . Thirty cells in each group were subjected to the quantitative image analysis . Data are presented as the means 6 standard error ( SE ) for the number of cells indicated in the text . Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon t - test feature of Excel 2012 . Figure 3 . PI3K is required for lamellipodial extension but not for peripheral ruffling . ( A ) PC - 3 cells were transiently transfected with pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1 . The cells were subjected to repeated photoactivation in the absence ( control ) or presence of 50 m M LY294002 . The leading edge of the extending lamellipodium is outlined in red . Scale bar , 10 m m . ( B ) The increased cell area due to lamellipodial extension was quantified by subtracting the area of the cell before photoactivation from the area of the cell 7 min after the beginning of PA - Rac1 activation . This increase was verified in 22 PC - 3 cells . The data plot shows the increased area due to lamellipodial expansion that was induced by PA - Rac1 photoactivation in the absence [ LY ( 2 ) ] or presence of LY294002 [ LY ( + ) ] . The significance of the differences between LY ( 2 ) and LY ( + ) was confirmed with the Wilcoxon t - test ( right ) . The increase in the lamellipodial area in the presence of LY294002 was significantly lower than that of the control cells ( p , 0 . 01 ) . ( C ) Kymographic analysis was performed at a two - headed arrow placed across the lamellipodium of a PC - 3 cell expressing mCherry - PA - Rac1 before and after the addition of LY294002 .

Results Local Activation of PA - Rac1 Reversibly Induces Lamellipodial Extension and Ruffling To elucidate the relationship between Rac1 activation and lamellipodial dynamics , we introduced mCherry - fused PA - Rac1 into PC - 3 cells . After confirming the expression of mCherry - PA - Rac1 based on the mCherry signal , we irradiated a peripheral region of the cells using a 445 nm laser during the intervals of image acquisition and acquired phase - contrast images of the live cells every 15 sec by confocal microscopy . Typically , after 1 – 4 min of irradiation with the 445 nm laser , a thin sheet - like protrusion ( i . e . , a lamellipodium ) extending parallel to the substratum was observed at the cell peripheral site that was irradiated by the 445 nm laser . The lamellipodium reached its maximum length after 5 – 6 min of PA - Rac1 activation . At that time , following the outward extension , the fully extended lamellipodium curled up its leading edge to show a peripheral ruffling movement . The ruffling movements continued for the duration of irradiation . After irradiation ceased , both the lamellipodial extension and the peripheral ruffling promptly receded ( Fig . 1 and Movie S1 ) . In our previous study , dorsal ruffling was induced in RAW 264 macrophages by PA - Rac1 activation [ 15 , 16 ] , but dorsal ruffling was not prominent in PC - 3 cells . When we irradiated a different area of the same cell , a lamellipodial extension was generated at the newly irradiated area , suggesting that these phenomena were dependent on local PA - Rac1 activation by light irradiation ( Fig . 2 ) . The overexpression of a GDP - bound ( dominant negative ) mutant of PA - Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 T17N ) did not induce either lamellipodial extension or peripheral ruffling after 445 - nm laser irradiation ( not shown ) . This finding indicated that the morphological changes induced by 445 - nm laser irradiation are dependent on GTP - loaded Rac1 . PA - Rac1 - induced Lamellipodial Extension is Dependent on PI3K To examine the effect of inhibiting PI3K activity on PA - Rac1 - induced lamellipodial motility , we used LY294002 , a synthetic inhibitor of PI3K . We first confirmed that the cells expressing PA - Rac1 exhibited lamellipodial extension and ruffling due to photoactivation . After ceasing photoactivation , we added 50 m M LY294002 to the same cells . When we irradiated the same regions of the cells 30 min after the addition of LY294002 , lamellipodial extension was greatly suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor ( Fig . 3A and Movie S2 ) . We performed the same experiments using 22 PC - 3 cells and quantitatively compared the area increase due to PA - Rac1 activation in each cell before and after treatment with LY294002 ( Fig . 3B ) . The quantitative image analysis demonstrat - ed that the increase of cell area due to PA - Rac1 - induced lamellipodial extension was significantly suppressed by LY294002 ( p , 0 . 01 , n = 22 , Fig . 3B ) . Figure 4 . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in lamellipodia after PA - Rac1 photoactivation in the absence or presence of LY294002 . PC - 3 cells were co - transfected with pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1 and mCitrine - AKT - PH . Phase - contrast , mCherry - PA - Rac1 ( red fluorescence ) , and mCitrine - AKT - PH ( yellow fluorescence ) images were acquired before and after PA - Rac1 photoactivation . PA - Rac1 photoactivation was repeated in the same cell region in the absence ( control ) or presence of 50 m M LY294002 . The levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 were increased in the extending lamellipodium by photoactivation ( arrowheads ) . In the presence of LY294002 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was not increased in the region where PA - Rac1 was photo - activated . The blue - dotted rectangle indicates the photoactivation area . The extending lamellipodium is outlined in red . Scale bars , 10 m m . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0097749 . g004 PI3K in Rac1 - Mediated Lamellipodial Motility PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e97749 Additionally , we conducted kymographic analysis to determine the changes in length of the lamellipodia . After confirming PA - Rac1 - induced lamellipodial extension and ruffling due to PA - Rac1 photoactivation , we added LY294002 to the cells during PA - Rac1 photoactivation . Although the lengths of the lamellipodia were changed due to peripheral ruffling , the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on lamellipodial extension was small . Peripheral ruffling persisted for the duration of irradiation . Immediately after photoactivation ceased , both lamellipodial extension and periph - eral ruffling receded completely . When we re - irradiated the same region , the cells did not show lamellipodial extension ( Fig . 3C ) . These results suggest that the formation of a lamellipodium is more sensitive to PI3K inhibitors than is the maintenance of extended lamellipodia and peripheral ruffling . Similar results were obtained using 100 nM wortmannin or 1 m M ZSTK474 as PI3K inhibitors ( Fig . S1 ) . As a control , the same PA - Rac1 activation experiments were performed using cells treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO , the vehicle of the inhibitors . PA - Rac1 - induced lamellipodial formation was not inhibited by DMSO ( Fig . S2 ) . PA - Rac1 Photoactivation can Locally Activate PI3K and Recruit WAVE2 Because PA - Rac1 - induced lamellipodial extension was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors , we attempted to clarify that PA - Rac1 activation led to PI3K activation . To monitor the production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by PI3K activity , PC - 3 cells were cotransfected with pmCitrine - AKT - PH and pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1Q61L and observed using a Zeiss LSM700 ( Fig . 4 ) . The fluorescence intensity of mCitrine - AKT - PH at the lamellipodial leading edge after 5 min of PA - Rac1photoactivation was measured using MetaMorph imaging software and was quantitatively compared with that of the same region before photoactivation . After 5 min of local activation of PA - Rac1 , the fluorescence intensity of mCitrine - AKT - PH showed a 125 . 4 % 6 22 . 3 % increase ( n = 16 ) compared with that measured before photoactivation , suggesting that the levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the extending lamellipodia were greatly increased by the local photoactivation of PA - Rac1 . In the presence of LY294002 , no cells showed an increase in the fluorescence intensity of mCitrine - AKT - PH after irradiation . This finding suggests that Rac1 photoactivation activates PI3K to produce PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the membrane of the extending lamellipodia . Furthermore , we examined the dynamics of WAVE2 during the lamellipodia - generating process , because WAVE2 plays a major role in Rac1 - induced actin reorganization in association with PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 [ 17 – 19 ] . After 5 min of irradiation with 445 - nm light , EGFP - WAVE2 localized as a dotted line at the leading edge of the extending lamellipodial ( Fig . 5 ) . The fluorescence intensity of EGFP - WAVE2 after photoactivation showed a 315 . 1 % 6 54 . 4 % increase ( n = 17 ) at the leading edge of the extending lamellipodia . After the addition of LY294002 , neither EGFP - WAVE2 recruit - ment nor lamellipodial extension was induced by PA - Rac1pho - toactivation ( Fig . 5 ) . These findings indicate that WAVE2 is recruited by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and contributes to Rac1 - dependent lamellipodial extension through actin polymerization . Figure 5 . PI3K - dependent WAVE2 recruitments to the leading edge of the extending lamellipodium during PA - Rac1 activation . PC - 3 cells were co - transfected with pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1 and pEGFP - N1 - WAVE2 . Phase - contrast , mCherry - PA - Rac1 ( red fluorescence ) , and EGFP - WAVE2 ( green fluorescence ) images were acquired before and after PA - Rac1 photoactivation . PA - Rac1 photoactivation was repeated in the same cell region in the absence ( control ) or presence of 50 m M LY294002 . The yellow arrowheads indicate that WAVE2 was recruited to the leading edge of the extending lamellipodium . In the presence of LY294002 , WAVE2 was not recruited to the periphery of the cells where PA - Rac1 was photoactivated . The blue - dotted rectangle indicates the photoactivation area .

The mCitrine - Rac1Q61L - expressing cells had well - spread lamellipodia around their entire circumferences . When we added 50 m M LY294002 to these cells , the extended lamellipodia shrank only slightly , even after 30 min . Surprisingly , peripheral ruffling activity was markedly enhanced by the PI3K inhibition in the Rac1Q61L - expressing cells ( Fig . 6 and Movie S3 ) . Quantitative analysis of the changes in maximum cell diameter indicated that this factor was not significantly affected by any PI3K inhibitor , whereas the number of peripheral ruffles was greatly increased after 30 min of PI3K inhibition ( Table 1 ) . Discussion Lamellipodia can be classified into three types : the thin leading edge of a cell that extends the membrane along the substratum , the peripheral ruffles formed by the upward bending of the leading edge , and the vertical dorsal ruffles that appear behind the leading edge on the dorsal surface of the cell [ 9 , 20 ] . However , the different mechanisms that regulate these lamellipodial motile processes have not been clarified . PC - 3 cells and other prostate cancer cells do not exhibit dorsal ruffling , which is observed in RAW264 macrophages after PA - Rac1 activation [ 15 ] . This discrepancy is most likely due to the differences between these cell types . PC - 3 cells showed remarkable lamellipodial extension and peripheral ruffling upon PA - Rac1 activation . The present study was undertaken to characterize lamellipodial dynamics and their regulation in PC - 3 cancer cells , as lamellipodial motility plays a central role in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells . Previous reports have noted that the inhibition of PI3K activity hinders all platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) - induced lamelli - podial motile processes in fibroblasts , including extension , peripheral ruffling , and dorsal ruffle formation [ 19 ] . Because PI3K is involved in the early stage of signal transduction from the PDGF receptor in fibroblasts [ 21 ] , all responses to PDGF could be intercepted by PI3K inhibition . However , PI3K activity is reportedly unnecessary for M - CSF - induced ruffling and EGF - induced dorsal ruffling in A431 cells [ 22 , 23 ] . Thus , signaling from distinct receptors leads to ruffle formation in various cell types . In our experiments using the optogenetic control of Rac1 activity , we directly induced Rac1 - mediated lamellipodial activity without upstream signaling from receptors . Because the involvement of PI3K in early signal transduction from different types of receptors could therefore be ignored , we could elucidate the role of PI3K in lamellipodial motility downstream of Rac1 . Using live - cell imaging combined with PA - Rac1 photomanipulation , we could clearly demonstrate that the lamellipodium first extends outward parallel Figure 6 .

After the addition of 50 m M LY294002 , the extended lamellipodium had shrunk only slightly , but the peripheral ruffling was pronounced .

Further - more , we found that the lamellipodial extension induced by PA - Rac1 activation was severely perturbed by PI3K inhibitors while peripheral ruffling was not inhibited . These results suggest that two types of lamellipodial motility , extension and ruffling , are differentially regulated by PI3K - dependent and PI3K - indepen - dent signaling pathways . Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) family proteins are acti - vators of Arp2 / 3 - dependent polymerization [ 17 ] . WAVE family proteins are associated with lamellipodial formation through the Rac1 signaling pathway . To prevent disordered actin polymeri - zation , WAVE family proteins exist as heteropentameric protein complexes that hinder their own active sites . Although WAVEs are functionally activated by GTP - bound Rac1 when actin polymer - ization is initiated , WAVEs cannot bind directly to GTP - bound Rac1 . Instead , IRSp53 ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ) works as a linker molecule to connect Rac1 and the WAVE complex [ 18 ] . GTP - bound Rac1 induces an allosteric change in the WAVE complex that exposes its active site ; WAVE2 then activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , which becomes a nucleus for actin polymerization at the leading edge of the lamellipodium [ 24 – 26 ] . In our PA - Rac1 - activation experiments , WAVE2 was localized to the leading edges of extending lamellipodia . However , neither WAVE2 recruitment nor lamellipodial extension was observed when PI3K activity was inhibited . These results suggest that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is required for WAVE2 recruitment and for lamelli - podial extension . Because WAVE2 has a PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - binding sequence [ 19 ] , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 may recruit WAVE2 to the leading edge . Suetsugu et al . [ 18 ] reported that the activity of the WAVE2 complex was optimized by IRSp53 in association with activated Rac1 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Furthermore , the simultaneous binding of GTP - bound Rac and acidic phospholipids such as PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to WAVE2 is required for the efficient recruitment and activation of WAVE2 [ 17 ] . These previous reports strengthen our assertion that the inhibition of lamellipodial extension by PI3K inhibitors results from the perturbation of WAVE2 recruitment . In this study , the activation of PA - Rac1 induced the production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and the recruitment of WAVE2 when lamellipodial extension was initiated . Furthermore , PI3K inhibitors hindered the recruitment of WAVE2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and suppressed lamellipodial extension . These findings indicate that PI3K plays an essential role in initiating lamellipodial extension . Furthermore , we employed constitutively active Rac1Q61L - expressing cells to observe the response of the extended lamellipodia to the inhibition of PI3K activity . In cells expressing Rac1Q61L , the extended lamellipodia were relatively resistant to PI3K inhibitors . In addition , the PI3K inhibitors actually enhanced the peripheral ruffling activity of the lamellipodia , but rather enhanced this activity . Thus , while PI3K may not be crucial for the maintenance of extended lamellipodia or for ruffling activity , the initiation of lamellipodial extension is highly dependent on PI3K . Notably , PI3K inhibitors also enhanced peripheral ruffling activity in Rac1Q61L - expressing PC - 3 cells , although the mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear . Using EGF - stimulated A431 cells , we have previously shown that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is enriched in the membrane of ruffles , however , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels are elevated only at the closing of circular ruffles into macropinosomes [ 23 ] . Therefore , ruffle formation is likely more dependent on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Because PI3K inhibition results in an increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , it may be hypothesized that this increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enhances ruffling activity . We recently reported that the sequential breakdown of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is also important for the completion of macropinosome formation from membrane ruffling [ 27 ] . Thus , the roles of phosphoinositide metabolism in membrane ruffling and lamellipodial extension are more complicated and important than we previously predicted . Future studies should conduct more detailed examinations of the interactions of each phosphoinositide with its effectors and / or other signaling path - ways . Recently , the overexpression of a Rac1 activator protein ( 14 - 3 - 3 protein zeta ) and several GEFs ( VAV3 , P - Rex1 ) was identified in prostate cancer [ 28 – 30 ] . Moreover , castration - resistant prostate cancer cells , which have a high malignant potential associated with invasion and metastasis , overexpress Rac1 [ 31 ] . These findings suggest that Rac1 overexpression affects the progression of prostate cancer . Although several studies have shown that PI3K inhibitors obstruct the migration of prostate cancer cells as induced by chemical mediators , those studies assumed that PI3K affected the upstream signal transduction of Rac1 [ 32 – 34 ] . To our knowledge , no previous report has examined the relationship between PI3K and Rac1 downstream signal transduction in prostate cancer . In this study , we clearly showed that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and the Rac1 downstream effector protein WAVE2 act in a coordinated manner in lamellipodial extension , which contributes to the migration of prostate cancer cells . Therefore , the inhibition of PI3K activity effectively obstructs the Rac1 - overexpression - mediated migration of prostate cancer cells . Conclusions Optogenetic technology enabled us to spatiotemporally control PA - Rac1 activity in prostate cancer cells . We demonstrated that the inhibition of PI3K activity suppressed lamellipodial extension but had less of an inhibitory effect on peripheral ruffling . The present study indicates that PI3K , acting downstream of Rac1 , has an essential role in the initiation of lamellipodial extension , which underlies prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis . The better understanding and further characterization of the molecular regulation of the lamellipodial motile processes of metastatic prostate cancer cells will provide new insights for the development of cancer therapies .
