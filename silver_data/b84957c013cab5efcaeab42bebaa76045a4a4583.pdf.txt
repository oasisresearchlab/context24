Decolonising discourses teach us that we need to move away from the universalising ‘grand narratives’ of knowledge production and focus on contextualising diverse and situated experiences , epistemologies and narratives . Yet , few contri - butions actively demonstrate what a shift to decolonising PD means in practice . This interactive workshop will invigorate the gap in PD debates of decolonisation by bringing together and demonstrating how participatory designers in diverse global contexts are working with and adapting modes , concepts , methodologies and sensibilities of PD into decolonising practices . These practices not only create new shifts and worldviews , but have potential for developing truly transcultural and transdisciplinary PD approaches CCS CONCEPTS • Human - centered computing → Interaction design ; Human computer interaction ( HCI ) .

Further , it will create insights into the different ways choices are made based on diverse epistemologies , methodologies and continental demarcations . Grounded by the PDC 2020 theme of Participation ( s ) Otherwise , the workshop looks beyond traditional PD narratives towards adoptable PD approaches and methods within a transcultural and transdisciplinary mode . A central aim of the workshop is to gather a diversity of decolonising practices ; methods , concepts and approaches applied in diverse contexts , that demonstrate research and knowledge practices for plural epistemologies , marginalised voices , situated socio - political and historical contexts , through participatory processes . 2 DECOLONISING PARTICIPATORY DESIGN PD has a long history of addressing power relations and issues of democracy and empowerment with special attention to engaging lo - cal and marginalised groups , citizens and organisations in processes of mutual learning and bottom - up development [ 4 . ] . Equally , the ongoing appropriation of PD outside of Scandinavia in particular to the global south , has focused on the inclusion and ‘empower - ment’ of local communities and citizens , but also prompted critical concerns of the original Westernised model’s applicability to the rest of the world [ 22 . , 3 . ] . The cultural lenses chosen determine our approaches to participant engagement as well as the research outcomes . A postcolonial perspective points to the fact that design practices are far from universal , and are still based on Western epistemologies and applied in developing countries without much consideration of the local knowledge systems [ 5 . , 12 . , 11 . , 20 . ] . Thus , one could argue that well intended PD practices intrinsically still 206 PDC ’20 : Vol . 2 , June 15 – 20 , 2020 , Manizales , Colombia Rachel Charlotte Smith et al . promote neocolonial design . Thus , the decolonising design dis - course is of an ontological nature and requires a transdisciplinary and transcultural dialogue to radically transform design [ 12 . , 18 . ] . Yet , there seem to be theoretical and methodological gaps in PD in relation to contemporary discourses of decolonising design [ 20 . , 17 . , 18 . ] . Such gaps are visible also in practice in different domains , from the widespread generalisation of design methods and approaches , to non - profit organisations’ commodification of aid in the underdeveloped world [ 11 . ] , and industry development and distribution of one - size - fits - all tech applications to the global market . 3 DECOLONISATION PRACTICES The workshop examines how participatory designers are respond - ing to the critical calls for humanistic , contextualised and de - westernising approaches to design and development across local and regional research contexts . Based on promising examples of decolonising directions on different continents , described in the following , we aim to create a basis for evolving decolonising PD practices connected to such domains as : Transcultural technology design : Community engagement through a transcultural approach , looks beyond traditional indi - vidual cultures and focuses on transcultural technology design methods that adopt , support and continuously create new mean - ings from diverse settings . A transcultural approach focuses on being culturally aware when designing with culturally diverse com - munities and groups , embracing pluralistic social practices and increased awareness [ 23 . ] . Localisation of knowledge : Through promotion of local con - ferences such as AfriCHI and other initiatives to support strong local research communities . ICT4D though engaged in local initia - tives to support development is often still based on Western ideals and evaluation parameters of the developing world [ 10 . ] . Incorpo - rating local practices and values , such as the suggested afrocentric approach to HCI [ 21 . ] promotes alternative knowledge creations . Humanising emerging technology : An increasing number of debates around inherent biases in AI , cultural variations in the ethical debates of autonomous vehicles and social robots suggest the realisation for action [ 13 . , 8 . ] . Like design , algorithms and intel - ligent systems are important sites of cultural transformation , and participatory designers and researchers are working against the colonial impulse in ubiquitous computing [ 9 . ] , to develop human , ethical and responsible approaches , principles and guidelines for de - colonising emerging technologies in corporate contexts [ 16 . , 17 . , 2 . ] . Participatory action research : Historical traditions such as participatory action research in Latin America echo strong de - colonising practices that focus on the social realities , political strug - gles and empowerment of marginalised communities [ 6 . , 12 . , 14 . ] . Where some contributions suggest the systematisation of experi - ence to validate alternative southern epistemologies , Escobar ar - gues for notions of ‘pluriversal design’ [ 11 . ] ; creating a world in which ‘many worlds fit’ and that allow the emergence of pluriversal ways of worldmaking . Notions of autonomous design are integral and should support the self - realisation of communities based on southern approaches [ 7 . ] . Design anthropology futures : Contributions from design an - thropology offer decolonising approaches to the situated ethics , values and politics of future making [ 22 . , 15 . , 19 . ] . Researchers use anthropological approaches and cultural sensibilities to create ‘cor - respondence’ through a continued engagement and commitment to particular people and lifeworlds [ 15 . ] . Through collaborative explorations of emergent cultural practices , possible futures are cocreated that are deeply aligned with local epistemologies . Such sensitivity relates also to Akama’s [ 1 . ] use of the Japanese concept of Ma , ‘between - ness’ , to explore how designers can work through processes of becoming together . The transdisciplinary and culturally situated approaches to knowledge production have potential for generating new under - standings and practices in the decolonisation of PD . To identify and map possible decolonising practices in transcultural and transdisci - plinary settings , four questions are addressed : • What are state - of - the - art examples of decolonising practices and epistemologies in / for contemporary PD research and practice ? • What can we learn from PD experiences of decolonising practices applied in diverse contexts ; geographical , academic , corporate , not for profit ? • How are theoretical discourses of decolonisation integrated into concrete practices , methodologies , or modes of knowl - edge production in the research ? • What are the future trajectories of decolonising PD practices for pluriversal approaches to design and technology ? 3 . 1 Workshop format Building on the above arguments and directions for decolonisation , this full day workshop has different phases . Phase 1 : PD of a social robot [ [ 2 . ] hours ] : Participants are grouped in smaller groups and immediately engaged in the codesign of a social robot for defined diverse contexts ( be it organisational , community , private or public spaces ) . The design techniques will be “borrowed” from the suggested methods in the position pa - pers and / or prescribed by the organisers such as using “consensus method” in one group , but also allowing the participants to negoti - ate design methods [ [ 1 . ] hour ] . Only once the groups share their design outputs with the rest of the group do they reveal who they are and position their research in relation to their created robots , their personal values and views [ [ 1 . ] hour ] . Phase 2 : Embracing epistemologies dialogue [ 1 . 5 hours ] : The plu - rality of epistemologies in the room are now made explicit triggered by the created artefacts and attached values . Each participant will position themselves , map out their methods or concepts , and ex - press how they create knowledge looking at phase 1 , a research through design approach . Possible decolonisation of PD practices are presented in form of an engaged Bohm dialogue . Phase 3 : Prototype decolonising toolkit [ 1 . 5 hours ] : In groups the participants will prototype a toolkit of methods , techniques , con - cepts and principles of a decolonised PD . The toolkit will be show - cased to a wider PDC audience in an exchange event with other workshop participants . 207 Decolonising Participatory Design Practices : Towards Participations Otherwise PDC ’20 : Vol . 2 , June 15 – 20 , 2020 , Manizales , Colombia Table 1 : Workshop schedule Workshop Activity Time Introduction of workshop format and content by organisers 15 min PD of a social robot in smaller groups 60 min Sharing of products and introduction of participants and organisers 60 min Dialogue embracing epistemologies 90 min Prototype toolkit of methods 90 min Summary conclusion and way forward 30 min 4 PARTICIPANTS RECRUITMENT The minimum number of participants is 5 and the maximum num - ber of participants 25 . Participants will be asked to provide 1 - 2 - page position papers describing examples of rich on - the - ground research cases that demonstrate or conceptualise decolonising approaches and practices to design and technology . The participants are re - quested to elaborate on their own practical experience as well as provide suggestions for possible methods , techniques and concepts aiming at embracing multiple epistemologies in design and knowl - edge production . The aim is to attract diverse participants from different continents , that represent a global community of PD re - searchers working in different contexts and domains . 5 OUTCOME OF THE WORKSHOP The workshop will produce a collection of decolonising approaches and methods from a diverse PD global community . Multiple joint article ( s ) or a journal SI , will be generated after the workshop that discuss and reflect upon this collection and collaborative decolonis - ing toolkit . 6 ORGANISERS The authors represent diverse disciplines and approaches across design , anthropology , technology and innovation , from Africa , Latin America , Europe and the US .
