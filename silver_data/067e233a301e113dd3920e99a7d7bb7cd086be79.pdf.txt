However , a distinguishing feature between slow - growing normal and tumor cells is the hypoxic microenvironment of the latter , which makes them extraordinarily dependent on anaerobic glycolysis for survival . Previously , we have shown that hypoxic tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to inhibitors of glycolysis in three distinct in vitro models . Based on these results , we predicted that combination therapy of a chemotherapeutic agent to target rapidly dividing cells and a glycolytic inhibitor to target slow - growing tumor cells would have better efficacy than either agent alone . Here , we test this strategy in vivo using the glycolytic inhibitor 2 - deoxy - D - glucose ( 2 - DG ) in combination with Adria - mycin ( ADR ) or paclitaxel in nude mouse xenograft models of human osteosarcoma and non - small cell lung cancer . Nude mice implanted with osteosarcoma cells were divided into four groups as follows : ( a ) untreated controls ; ( b ) mice treated with ADR alone ; ( c ) mice treated with 2 - DG alone ; or ( d ) mice treated with a combination of ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG . Treatment began when tumors were either 50 or 300 mm 3 in volume . Starting with small or large tumors , the ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG combination treatment resulted in significantly slower tumor growth ( and therefore longer survival ) than the control , 2 - DG , or ADR treatments ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . Similar beneficial effects of combination treatment were found with 2 - DG and paclitaxel in the MV522 non - small cell lung cancer xenograft model . In summary , the treatment of tumors with both the glycolytic inhibitor 2 - DG and ADR or paclitaxel results in a significant reduction in tumor growth compared with either agent alone . Overall , these results , combined with our in vitro data , provide a rationale for initiating clinical trials using glycolytic inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to increase their therapeutic effectiveness . Introduction In 1930 , Warburg ( 1 ) proposed that all tumor cells undergo accel - erated aerobic glycolysis , but it was not until the advent of molecular biology , particularly the identification of oncogenes , that the essential underlying mechanisms began to be understood . In 1987 , it was reported that Ras or Src oncogene - mediated transformation of fibro - blasts led to up - regulation of glucose transport protein and messenger RNA ( 2 ) . In the early 1990s , hypoxia - inducible factor ( HIF ) was identified as a transcription factor that , under hypoxic conditions , up - regulates genes encoding glucose transporters , glycolytic enzymes , and vascular endothelial growth factor , among others ( 3 – 5 ) . It is well known that most , if not all , solid tumors contain regions of varying degrees of hypoxia . Thus , the accelerated glycolysis observed by Warburg ( 1 ) can now be explained by at least two mechanisms , one driven by malignant transformation , and the other driven by hypoxia . For decades , screening and selection of anticancer agents were based on the more rapid division of tumor cells relative to normal cells . As a result , radiation therapy and most chemotherapy currently used to treat cancer target the rapidly dividing cells of a tumor as well as the most rapidly dividing normal cells that reside in the bone marrow , gastrointestinal regions , and hair follicles . Thus , the main selectivity of these treatments is not between malignant and normal cells but between rapidly and slowly dividing cells . Solid tumors , however , contain regions of slowly proliferating cells and because most normal cells are either resting in G 0 or are dividing slowly , one of the most difficult populations to selectively target are the slow - growing malignant cells . A distinguishing feature between slow - growing tumor and normal cells is that the microenvironment of the former is hypoxic , which contributes to reduced growth rate and drug resistance ( 6 – 8 ) . Under hypoxia , tumor cells must metabolize glucose anaerobically to generate ATP , thereby providing a window of selec - tivity that can be exploited with inhibitors of glycolysis ( 9 – 11 ) . In a recent series of papers using three in vitro models of simulated hypoxia ( 9 – 11 ) , we have shown that cells under hypoxic conditions are more sensitive than cells under aerobic conditions to agents that inhibit glycolysis , such as 2 - deoxy - D - glucose ( 2 - DG ) and oxamate . The basis for this increased sensitivity is that a tumor cell growing under low or no oxygen must rely primarily on glycolysis to produce ATP . Thus , when challenged with a glycolytic inhibitor , ATP syn - thesis is shut off , and the cell succumbs to this treatment . However , in the presence of oxygen , a cell can use alternative sources of energy , such as fats and proteins , to synthesize ATP and hence survive inhibition of glycolysis . Because the slowly proliferating tumor pop - ulation can be selectively killed with glycolytic inhibitors , combining such agents with chemotherapeutic drugs , which target the rapidly dividing aerobic cells , should raise the overall efficacies of these treatments ( 9 – 11 ) . Here , we have designed experiments to test this strategy in vivo using 2 - DG in combination with either Adriamycin ( ADR ) or paclitaxel in two different human tumor types , osteosar - coma and non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , growing in nude mice . Materials and Methods 2 - DG (cid:1) ADR in Human Osteosarcoma Cells in Nude Mice . Nude mice , strain CD1 , approximately 5 – 6 weeks of age and weighing approximately 30 g , received s . c . implantation with 100 (cid:1) l of human osteosarcoma cell line 143b at 10 7 cells / ml . When tumors were approximately 50 mm 3 in size ( 9 days later ) , the animals were pair - matched into four groups ( 8 mice / group ) as Received 10 / 21 / 03 ; accepted 11 / 13 / 03 .

At day 0 , the 2 - DG alone and ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG groups received 0 . 2 ml of 2 - DG i . p . at 75 mg / ml ( 500 mg / kg ) , which was repeated 3 (cid:2) per week ( Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ) for the duration of the experiment . On day 1 , the ADR and ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG groups received 0 . 3 ml of ADR i . v . at 0 . 6 mg / ml ( 6 mg / kg ) , which was repeated once per week for a total of three treatments ( 18 mg / kg ) . This experiment was then repeated ( n (cid:3) 4 / group ) , but treatment was delayed until the tumors were approximately 300 mm 3 . Mice were weighed , and tumor measurements were taken by caliper three times weekly . Tumor measurements were converted to tumor volume by using the formula W (cid:2) L 2 / 2 . Mice were killed when either W or L exceeded 15 mm . At sacrifice , mice were weighed , and tumors were excised and checked histologically for verification of tumor growth . 2 - DG (cid:1) Paclitaxel in Human MV522 Lung Tumor Carcinoma Cells in Nude Mice . Nude female mice , approximately 5 – 6 weeks of age and weigh - ing approximately 20 g , received s . c . implant by trocar with fragments of human MV522 lung tumor carcinoma harvested from s . c . tumors growing in nude mice hosts . When tumors were approximately 70 mm 3 in size ( 11 days later ) , the animals were pair - matched into five groups ( 10 mice / group ) as follows : vehicle - treated control ; paclitaxel alone ; paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 500 mg / kg ) ; paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 1000 mg / kg ) ; and paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 2000 mg / kg ) . An aqueous solution of 2 - DG was delivered twice daily by oral gavage . Doses of 500 and 1000 mg / kg were given for the duration of the experiment , whereas the 2000 mg / kg 2 - DG dose was given twice daily for only 10 days . Paclitaxel was given by i . p . injection at 16 mg / kg once a day for 5 days , beginning 5 days after the first day of 2 - DG treatment . Mice were weighed , and tumor measurements were taken by caliper twice weekly . Tumor measurements were converted to tumor volume using the formula W (cid:2) L 2 / 2 . Mice were killed when their tumor volume exceeded 1000 mm 3 . At sacrifice , mice were weighed , and tumors were excised and weighed . Statistical Analysis . For the osteosarcoma studies , linear regression was used to determine the rate of the log of tumor growth over time for each treatment using the following equation : Log e ( tumor volume (cid:1) 1 ) (cid:3) (cid:2) i (cid:1) (cid:3) i ( time ) (cid:1) (cid:4) ik , where i (cid:3) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 indicates treatment group , and k is an index for each mouse ( k (cid:3) 1 , . . . , n i ) . Faster growth of tumor is represented by larger slopes ( (cid:3) ) in the regression equation , which in turn represent greater rates of disease progression . This model was used to estimate the number of days required to reach specific tumor volumes of 400 , 800 , and 1200 mm 3 . Although the mice in some of the treatment groups survived for more than 4 weeks , the analyses of tumor growth rates were truncated at the time when the control animals began to reach the maximum tumor volume allowed . Multiple comparisons were made between the various treatment groups to determine whether the rates of tumor growth , i . e . , slopes , differed across treatment groups . For the NSCLC study , the time for each individual tumor to grow to 600 mm 3 was determined , and a one - way ANOVA repeated measures test was done to determine whether there was a significant difference in time for any of the groups to reach a tumor size of 600 mm 3 . When a significant difference was found ( P (cid:4) 0 . 050 , a Dunnett’s post hoc comparison was performed to determine whether the combined treatment was significantly different from paclitaxel alone . Data are plotted for each group up until the day when no animals have been sacrificed due to tumor burden . For animals that died prematurely , tumor volumes were set to 1000 mm 3 for all subsequent time points . Results The Effect of 2 - DG and Adriamycin in Osteosarcoma Tumors Growing in Nude Mice . Fig . 1 , A and B , summarize tumor growth rates for mice treated with control vehicle ( saline ) , 2 - DG , ADR , or ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG , and treatment began when the tumors were an average of 50 or 300 mm 3 , respectively . In Fig . 1 , A and B , it can be seen that ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG is clearly more effective in reducing tumor volume as compared with treatment with either ADR alone , 2 - DG alone , or control . In the experiment where treatment began when tumors were 50 mm 3 ( n (cid:3) 8 / mice / group ) , three mice in the ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG group had apparent cures ( tumors regressed slowly with continued treatment and were undetectable at 38 – 80 days ) . No cures were observed in any of the other groups . In Fig . 1 A , where cures are excluded , the ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG treatment is still shown to be more effective than control , 2 - DG , or ADR alone . A statistical analysis of the rate of tumor growth for each treatment type was used so that the cures could be included . This analysis showed that the group treated with ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG had tumors that grew significantly more slowly than the 2 - DG , ADR , or control groups ( P (cid:4) 0 . 0001 for each comparison ) . When the time to achieve tumor volumes of 400 , 800 , or 1200 mm 3 is estimated by linear regression , the longest delay in tumor growth again is in the group of animals treated with ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG for all three tumor volumes ( Table 1 ) . Specifically , the combination of ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG requires 45 days for tumor volume to reach 400 mm 3 , whereas this volume is reached in 19 days with control , 20 days with 2 - DG alone , and 25 days with ADR alone . Similar beneficial results for the combined treatment group are observed for tumor volumes of 800 and 1200 mm 3 ( Table 1 ) . All treatments were well tolerated , as evidenced by similar body weights for all groups throughout the treatment period . In the second experiment , in which treatment began when the tumors were larger ( 300 mm 3 ) , the group receiving the ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG combination treatment again showed smaller average tumor volumes than the 2 - DG , ADR , and control groups at all time points ( Fig . 1 B ) . One of the mice in the combination therapy group had a tumor that regressed slowly , starting at 303 mm 3 and shrinking to 56 mm 3 by day 44 . At day 34 , all of the animals in the combined treatment group had Fig . 1 . Effect of 2 - DG and ADR , alone and in combination , on growth of human osteosarcoma xenografts in nude mice . Average tumor volumes are shown as a function of time after initiation of treatment , when treatment was started when tumors were ( A ) 50 mm 3 or ( B ) 300 mm 3 . On day 0 , the control animals received saline ( i . p . ) , and animals in the 2 - DG alone and ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG groups received 500 mg / kg , 2 - DG ( i . p . ) , which was repeated 3 (cid:2) per week ( Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ) for the duration of the experiment . On day 1 , the ADR alone and ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG groups received 6 mg / kg ADR ( i . v . ) , which was repeated once per week for a total of three treatments ( 18 mg / kg ) . Note the enhanced efficacy of the combined treatment compared with either agent alone . 32 2 - DG INCREASES EFFICACY OF CHEMOTHERAPY Research . on May 3 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from tumor volumes below that which would require sacrifice , whereas all of the animals in the control , ADR , and 2 - DG groups had already been sacrificed due to tumor burden . When the time to achieve tumor volumes of 400 , 800 , and 1200 mm 3 was estimated by linear regression in this experiment , the longest delay in tumor growth was again found in the group of animals treated with ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG for all three tumor volumes ( Table 2 ) . Specifi - cally , this group of animals required approximately 20 days for tumor volume to reach 400 mm 3 , whereas this volume was reached in approximately 2 days with control , 3 days with 2 - DG alone , and 4 days with ADR alone . Similar advantageous results for the combina - tion treatment of 2 - DG (cid:1) ADR were observed when time to reach 800 and 1200 mm 3 tumor volumes were estimated . It should be noted that this second experiment was a more stringent test of the effect of the various treatment regimens because larger tumors are typically more difficult to treat . The data from both studies are consistent in demon - strating that beginning with small or large tumors , there is significant advantage in combination treatment with 2 - DG (cid:1) ADR as compared with treatment with either agent alone . In addition to slowing tumor growth , cures were found or significant tumor shrinkage was observed only in the ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG group . The Effect of 2 - DG and Paclitaxel in NSCLC Tumors Growing in Nude Mice . Tumor growth for NSCLC xenografts in nude mice treated with control , paclitaxel , or paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 500 , 1000 , or 2000 mg / kg 2 - DG ) are shown in Fig . 2 . As observed for the combi - nation of ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG , paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG was more effective in reducing tumor growth in human NSCLC tumors than was paclitaxel alone . Average tumor volume and SE are plotted in Fig . 2 only for groups where no animals had been sacrificed . There were two pre - mature deaths , however , at relatively small tumor volume , one in the paclitaxel group on day 14 , and one in the paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 500 mg / kg ) group on day 19 . These animals’ tumor volumes were set to 1000 mm 3 for all subsequent time points . All treatment regimens were well tolerated , with a maximum body weight loss of 8 % that was of short duration . The time to reach a tumor volume of 600 mm 3 was determined for each individual mouse . The average time to 600 mm 3 was 21 . 0 , 22 . 1 , 29 . 0 , and 33 . 7 days for the paclitaxel , paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 500 mg / kg ) , paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 1000 mg / kg ) , and paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 2000 mg / kg ) groups , respectively . An ANOVA analysis showed that the time for the paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 1000 mg / kg ) and paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 2000 mg / kg ) group tumors to reach 600 mm 3 was significantly longer than that for the paclitaxel and paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 500 mg / kg ) groups ( P (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) . The Paclitaxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 1000 mg / kg ) and pacli - taxel (cid:1) 2 - DG ( 2000 mg / kg ) groups were not significantly different from each other . A statistical analysis was not done on the rate of growth of the NSCLC tumors due to the large reduction in tumor growth rate between 10 and 20 days ( Fig . 2 ) . Combination chemo - therapy with 2 - DG and either ADR or paclitaxel improves therapy over chemotherapy alone in both osteosarcoma and NSCLC xenograft models of cancer in nude mice . It should be noted that an effective dose of 2 - DG was achieved orally in these animals , which offers an important advantage over i . v . delivery of conventional chemothera - peutic agents , if similar results can be obtained in human patients . Discussion The in vivo results reported here demonstrate that combining 2 - DG with either ADR or paclitaxel clearly increases the efficacy of each of these chemotherapeutic agents in retarding tumor growth and prolong - ing survival . This outcome can be explained in part by our previous in vitro results , which illustrated that when oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited by either chemical ( mitochondrial inhibitors ) , genetic ( Rho 0 cells ) , or environmental ( hypoxia ) means , cells must rely on gly - colysis for survival and thus become hypersensitive to inhibitors of glycolysis ( 9 – 11 ) . However , because we could not observe an advan - tage in arresting tumor growth when animals were treated with 2 - DG alone ( although an effect on slowly proliferating hypoxic cells might have been masked by the rapidly dividing cells in the tumor ) , addi - tional factors must account for the enhanced effect we find with combination treatment . One of these factors is that chemotherapeutic agents including paclitaxel and ADR display antiangiogenic and or anti - HIF activity ( 12 – 14 ) . Thus , tumors treated with these agents may become more hypoxic , leading to enhanced efficacy of 2 - DG . Moreover , if anti - HIF agents reduce the overexpression of glycolytic enzymes , then theo - retically , this should reduce the amount of glycolytic inhibitor neces - sary to shut down glycolysis . Therefore , the multiple effects that anti - HIF agents such as 2 - methoxyestradiol ( 15 ) have on tumor me - tabolism in blocking both angiogenesis and reducing the expression of glycolytic enzymes would theoretically increase the effectiveness of 2 - DG or other inhibitors of glycolysis . Another factor that may be contributing to the results presented Table 1 Estimated time in days to reach tumor volumes of 400 , 800 , or 1200 mm 3 Tumor volume ( mm 3 ) a Control 2 - DG ADR ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG 400 19 20 25 45 800 25 25 32 58 1200 28 29 36 66 a Log e ( tumor volume (cid:1) 1 ) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) time ; P (cid:4) 0 . 0001 for comparisons of the rate of tumor growth in the ADR (cid:1) 2 - DG group to each of the other groups ( control , 2 - DG , and ADR ) .

Treatment was started when tumors were 70 mm 3 . Starting on day 1 , animals in the 2 - DG treatment groups were dosed orally , twice daily , with an aqueous solution of 2 - DG at 500 or 1000 mg / kg for the duration of the experiment or with 2000 mg / kg for 10 days . Paclitaxel was given alone or in combination with 2 - DG , by i . p . injection at 16 mg / kg , once a day for 5 days , beginning 5 days after the first day of 2 - DG treatment . Note the increased tumor growth inhibition in the combined pacli - taxel (cid:1) 2 - DG group as compared with the paclitaxel alone or vehicle - treated control groups . 33 2 - DG INCREASES EFFICACY OF CHEMOTHERAPY Research . on May 3 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from here is based on reports that the combination of 2 - DG and cisplatin is more effective than either agent alone when applied to various cell lines that are rapidly proliferating in vitro ( 16 ) . One of the explana - tions for this effect is that cells treated with drugs like cisplatin , which are known to cause DNA damage , cannot repair lesions as readily when their ATP levels are reduced as a result of glycolytic inhibition ( 16 ) . Similar in vitro synergism has been observed with the combi - nation of 2 - DG and ADR in MCF - 7 cells ( 17 ) , however , other studies have reported antagonistic effects ( 18 ) . Thus , further experimentation will be required to determine whether the increased effectiveness of the combination therapy presented here is due to 2 - DG preventing cells from repairing damage caused by ADR or paclitaxel . An alternative explanation for how 2 - DG increases the activity of chemotherapeutic agents is based on the fact that the p - glycoprotein effluxing pumps require ATP for their activity ( 19 ) . If ATP concen - trations are reduced , as has been reported to occur when cells are treated in vitro with 2 - DG ( 16 ) , the pumps will cease to function , and drug accumulation should increase intracellularly , thereby killing the cell . Thus , treating such resistant tumors with a combination of glycolytic inhibitor and any of the numerous anticancer agents known to be recognized by this mechanism ( 19 , 20 ) should provide clinical benefit . Although we reported previously that the osteosarcoma cell line used here expressed low levels of multidrug resistance - related protein ( MRP ) , and the MDR1 protein was undetectable , it remains possible that other effluxing pumps may be present in this cell line as well as in the NSCLC cell line used in these experiments . In summary , regardless of the underlying mechanisms , it is dem - onstrated here that 2 - DG does indeed increase the efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic drugs when applied to human tumors in vivo . We believe that this strategy of inhibiting glycolysis will have broad clinical benefit as an adjunct to cancer therapies . Our approach should be particularly applicable to antiangiogenic treatment and to the new agents tested against HIF , both of which should make the tumor more hypoxic and therefore more sensitive to inhibitors of glycolysis . In conclusion , we anticipate that inhibitors of glycolysis could have widespread application for a variety of tumor types not only in combination with existing anticancer agents but also with emerging new treatments that target the metabolic state of a tumor .
