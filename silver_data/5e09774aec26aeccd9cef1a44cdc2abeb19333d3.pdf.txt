We develop a series of technologies to test for any nuclear - encoded RNAs that are stably attached to the cell surface and exposed to the extracellular space , hereafter called membrane - associated extracellular RNAs ( maxRNAs ) . Results : We develop a technique called Surface - seq to selectively sequence maxRNAs and validate two Surface - seq identified maxRNAs by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization . To test for cell - type specificity of maxRNA , we use antisense oligos to hybridize to single - stranded transcripts exposed on the surface of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) . Combining this strategy with imaging flow cytometry , single - cell RNA sequencing , and maxRNA sequencing , we identify monocytes as the major type of maxRNA + PBMCs and prioritize 11 candidate maxRNAs for functional tests . Extracellular application of antisense oligos of FNDC3B and CTSS transcripts inhibits monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells . Conclusions : Collectively , these data highlight maxRNAs as functional components of the cell surface , suggesting an expanded role for RNA in cell - cell and cell - environment interactions . Keywords : Cell surface , Extracellular RNA , Cell membrane , Single cell , Cell - environment interaction , Monocyte , Endothelial cells Introduction The cell surface is the crucial interface between the interior and exterior of the cell . Bioactive molecules , including proteins , glycans , lipids , and their chemically modified variations , are essential for the cell surface functions , e . g . , extracellular signal sensing , extracellular matrix anchoring , and antigen presentation . In contrast , the contribution of nucleic acids particularly RNAs to the cell surface functions is largely unknown . Typically , the nuclear genome encoded RNAs ( ngRNA ) are not expected to be present on the surface of eukaryotic cells with intact cell membranes [ 1 ] . There have been a few cases suggesting exceptions .

Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s13059 - 020 - 02145 - 6 outside of the damaged membranes from dying cells and became autoantigens [ 1 , 2 ] . Another study showed that some extracellular ngRNAs were weakly attached to the membranes of cultured eukaryotic cells but are easily washed off [ 3 ] . Thus , it was un - clear whether such promiscuous cell surface RNA attachment mediates any biological functions . Several previous studies have alluded to the existence of relatively stable RNA - cell - surface interaction and the possibility of exposing ngRNA fragments to the extracellular surface of intact cells under physiological conditions . The first membrane - bound RNAs were discovered in bacteria [ 4 , 5 ] , and they are non - coding RNAs transcribed from the same operon as the genes encoding transmembrane proteins . Following co - transcription , the non - coding RNA and the transmembrane protein assemble into a ri - bonucleoprotein that gets incorporated into the cell membrane [ 4 , 5 ] . In human cells , it was shown that a few ngRNAs can bind to membrane lipids under physiological ionic conditions [ 6 , 7 ] . Furthermore , atomic force microscopy data suggest that RNAs can coat the surface of artificial phospholipid membranes [ 8 ] . Here , we examined the presence of ngRNAs that are stably associated with the sur - face of the intact mouse and human cells and exposed to the extracellular milieu . We termed these RNAs membrane - associated extracellular RNAs ( maxRNA ) . This defin - ition does not include the RNAs encapsulated within any cellular or extracellular vesi - cles [ 9 ] or cell - free RNAs that are not stably attached to cell membranes [ 3 ] . Furthermore , we characterized the sequences , cell - type specificity , and functional attri - butes of maxRNAs with a focus on those that are present on human peripheral blood - derived mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) as the archetype . Results Surface - seq : characterization of maxRNAs by sequencing To inspect the possible cell surface - presentation of nuclear - encoded RNA , we devel - oped a technology called Surface - seq . Surface - seq is based on a nanotechnology that extracts the plasma membrane from cells and tightly assembles the membrane around polymeric cores to form membrane - coated nanoparticles ( MCNP ) [ 10 – 12 ] . This tech - nology suits our purpose because it retains the inside - outside orientation of the mem - brane by keeping the surface molecules on the membrane facing outwards , as validated by transmission electron microscopy [ 10 , 13 ] . Moreover , the process of cell membrane purification and their stable coating onto the polymeric core ensures the rigorous re - moval of intracellular contents [ 10 – 12 ] . These validated features of MCNP enable the purification of RNAs that are stably associated with the extracellular layer of the cell membrane [ 10 , 12 ] , which are then used as the input of the Surface - seq library con - struction and sequencing . We performed Surface - seq with EL4 cells using 2 technical variations . In variation A , after MCNPs were assembled and washed , RNAs were extracted using phenol - chloroform , quantified , and constructed into a sequencing library ( Fig . 1a , Additional file 1 : Fig . S1 and S2 ) . This variation enriches for all membrane - associated RNA without differ - entiating the sides of the membrane . In variation B , after the MCNP assembly , the RNAs exposed on the outer surface of MCNPs ( which correspond to the outer cell surface ) were directly ligated to a 3 ′ RNA adaptor . The RNA was subsequently purified and ligated with Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 2 of 23 the 5 ′ adaptor . Because the 3 ′ adaptor was selectively ligated to the outside - facing RNA , this technical variation enriches for the outside - facing membrane - associated RNA in the sequencing library ( Fig . 1b ) . We generated 5 Surface - seq libraries from EL4 cells , including 3 replicate libraries from technical variation A ( A1 , A2 , A3 ) and 2 replicate libraries ( B1 , B2 ) from technical variation B ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . Our initial analysis focused on long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) because these have been previously associated with bacterial or Fig . 1 Sequencing and validation of maxRNA from a cell line . a , b The workflow of the two variations of Surface - seq . c A Venn diagram of the noncoding RNAs identified by the 5 Surface - seq experiments , indexed by A1 , A2 , A3 ( based on Surface - seq variation A ) , and B1 , B2 ( based on Surface - seq variation B ) . d Read coverages from the 5 Surface - seq libraries on the MALAT1 gene , indexed by A1 , A2 , A3 , B1 , and B2 .

Probe signals were compared against corresponding controls . * * * p value < 0 . 0001 Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 3 of 23 mammalian cell membrane functions [ 4 , 7 ] . Each sequencing library revealed 200 to 400 lncRNAs with counts per million greater than 2 , and 82 of them , including Malat1 , Neat1 , and Snhg20 , were shared among all 5 Surface - seq libraries ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Taking Malat1 as an example , the Surface - seq reads were not uniformly spread across the en - tire lncRNA , but enriched at specific regions , especially around the center of the tran - script ( Fig . 1d ) . To identify the outside - facing RNAs , we compared the sequencing libraries generated from Variation B ( B1 , B2 ) to those generated from Variation A ( A1 , A2 , A3 ) . A total of 17 lncRNAs were identified ( Benjamini - Hochberg adjustment FDR < 0 . 05 , and fold change > 2 , DESeq2 [ 14 ] ) , including Malat1 ( the scale of the B1 , B2 tracks was larger than the scale of the A1 , A2 , A3 tracks , Fig . 1d ) . These experiments identified candidate maxRNAs that appeared consistently on the outer cell membrane for further validation . Validation of maxRNAs by RNA - FISH on the cell surface ( Surface - FISH ) To validate the localization of candidate maxRNAs , we carried out single - molecule RNA - FISH on the cell surface , which we termed Surface - FISH . This technique was adapted from our previously established protocol [ 15 ] where the cell membrane permeabilization step was skipped . We used a set of five quantum - dot - labeled oligo - nucleotide probes each consisting of 40 nt against the target transcript ( arrows in Fig . 1d , e ) . We tested 2 Surface - seq prioritized lncRNAs , i . e . , Malat1 ( Fig . 1f – l ) and Neat1 ( Fig . 1f ) in EL4 cells . To control for probe specificity , we used probes with six mutated bases at the center of the 40 nt probes designed for testing Malat1 ( mut - Malat1 con - trol ) and Neat1 ( mut - Neat1 control ) , respectively ( Additional file 1 : Table S3 ) . We ex - amined 20 to 30 single cells for each probe - set ( Fig . 1f ) . Nearly all cells treated with Malat1 and Neat1 probes exhibited Surface - FISH signals , ranging from 1 to 10 signal foci per cell , whereas most cells treated with the control probes exhibited no signal ( median = 0 ) ( p values < 0 . 0001 , Wilcoxon rank tests ) ( Fig . 1g – j ) . To confirm that the Surface - FISH signals are not a result of RNA leakage from dam - aged cell membranes , we combined Malat1 Surface - FISH with a transmission - through - dye ( TTD ) microscopic analysis , where only live cells with intact membranes are fluo - rescently labeled [ 16 – 18 ] ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3 ) . Malat1 FISH signals appeared on cells with perfectly intact membranes ( Fig . 1k ) , as indicated by TTD staining of the same cell ( Fig . 1l ) . Together , observations made using various techniques suggest the presence of specific nuclear - encoded transcripts on the surface of intact live cells . Visualization of maxRNA from primary PBMCs as a test for cell - type specificity Based on the concept of guilt - by - association [ 19 – 21 ] , cell - type specificity of maxRNA presentation may suggest the relevance of maxRNA to the functions of the presenting cells . To evaluate this association , we tested whether maxRNAs are present in primary human cells under physiological conditions and whether their presence is cell - type spe - cific . We chose primary PBMCs for these tests , considering their heterogeneity and fre - quent interactions among each other and with other cell types . We collected 120 , 000 PBMCs from each of the 4 human subjects and split each donor ’ s cells into 4 aliquots , each with 30 , 000 cells . The 4 aliquots of PBMCs per donor were used for 1 test and 3 control experiments , as described below . Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 4 of 23 In the test experiment , we probed for putative maxRNAs on PBMCs by hybridization with a randomized library of fluorescence - labeled oligonucleotides of 20 nt ( maxRNA probes ) . Hereafter we will refer to this technique as in situ surface FISH ( isFISH ) ( Fig . 2a ) . After probe incubation and washes , we subjected PBMCs to an imaging flow cytometry ( IFC ) analysis of 6 channels , which detects brightfield , live / dead , cell nuclei ( Hoechst ) , maxRNA , CD14 ( a monocyte marker ) , CD3 ε ( a T cell marker ) , and CD19 ( a B cell marker ) ( Fig . 2b , c , Additional file 1 : Fig . S4 ) . To evaluate any possible fluoro - phore internalization or non - specific membrane attachment , we carried out 3 control experiments . We replaced the 20 - mer probes respectively with one of the following : ( 1 ) a randomized probe library of 6 nt oligonucleotides ( 6 - mer library control ) , ( 2 ) a 20 nt probe against the drosophila Art4 RNA ( dArt4 control ) , and ( 3 ) the fluorophore with - out conjugating any oligonucleotides ( fluorophore only control ) . On average , 4 . 8 % of total PBMCs exhibited isFISH signals , which is at least 27 - fold more than any of the control groups ( Fig . 2d ) ( p value < 0 . 005 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) . At the stereotypical cell type level , on average more than 10 % of CD14 + cells and approxi - mately 3 % of CD3 ε + cells exhibited isFISH signals ( p value < 0 . 005 , t test ) , whereas less than 2 % of CD19 + and CD3 ε − CD14 − CD19 − cells exhibited isFISH signals ( Fig . 2e ) . These data support the presence and cell - type specificity of maxRNA in primary hu - man PBMCs , thereby accumulating evidence towards guilt - by - association [ 19 – 21 ] , i . e . , the relevance of maxRNA to the functions of the presenting cells .

Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 5 of 23 Single - cell transcriptome analysis of maxRNA - presenting cells : additional evidence for cell - type specificity To provide further evidence for the cell - type specific maxRNA presentation , we charac - terized the maxRNA presenting cells by combining isFISH and fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) with single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) . Specifically , after isFISH labeling , we performed FACS on PBMCs and obtained 2 cell populations , i . e . , isFISH + and isFISH − . We then subjected these two populations of cells scRNA - seq on the 10X Genomics platform , which yielded 2486 isFISH + and 9043 isFISH − cells , with on average 21 , 059 reads per cell . The 3 control experiments ( 6 - mer , dArt4 , fluorophore only ) yielded too few positive cells ( Fig . 2d ) to be analyzed by the 10X Genomics scRNA - seq platform . Next , we employed both unsupervised and supervised methods to query whether the isFISH + cells are associated with any known cell types . In the unsupervised analysis , we plotted the single - cell transcriptomes on a tSNE plot ( Fig . 3a ) . isFISH + and isFISH − cells formed two separate clusters on the tSNE plot ( blue and red dots , Fig . 3a ) . The single cells expressing monocyte markers CD14 and LYZ were enriched in the isFISH + cluster and were nearly absent from the isFISH − cluster ( Fig . 3b , c ) . On the contrary , the single cells expressing T cell markers CD3E and CD8A , natural killer ( NK ) cell Fig . 3 Single - cell transcriptomes of maxRNA presenting PBMCs . a – c tSNE plots of 11 , 233 single cells resulted from FACS sorting , including 2486 isFISH + ( pink dots ) and 9043 isFISH − cells ( blue dots ) ( a ) , with CD14 ( b ) , and LYZ ( c ) expression levels color - coded as indicated next to the cell type label . d The classification of the single cells with each color representing a pre - defined cell type . e Association ( measured by log2 odds ratio , x - axis ) of isFISH + cells with each pre - defined cell type ( y - axis ) .

Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 6 of 23 marker NKG7 , and B cell marker MS4A1 were enriched in the isFISH - cluster ( Add - itional file 1 : Fig . S5 ) . For a supervised analysis , we used the trained SingleCellNet classifier [ 22 ] that classi - fies each PBMC into one of its 11 pre - defined PBMC cell types ( Fig . 3d ) . These 11 cell types were defined by training the SingleCellNet with ~ 68 , 000 human PBMC single - cell transcriptomes [ 22 ] . We ranked the 11 pre - defined cell types by their association with isFISH + cells based on odds ratios ( Fig . 3e ) . Two pre - defined cell types , namely CD14 + monocytes and dendritic cells , were enriched in isFISH + cells ( first two col - umns , Fig . 3e ) . The majority ( 87 % ) of the isFISH + cells were classified as CD14 + mono - cytes , as compared to only 0 . 55 % of isFISH − cells classified as CD14 + monocytes ( odds ratio = 1143 , Bonferroni adjusted p value < 0 . 001 ) . Of the other 10 cell types , dendritic cells exhibited a modest enrichment with isFISH + cells ( odds ratio = 7 . 78 ) and the other 9 cell types were relatively depleted in isFISH + cells ( odds ratio < 1 , Fig . 3e ) . Consistent with the unsupervised analysis , this supervised analysis suggests that the majority of maxRNA - presenting cells are monocytes . Collectively , both isFISH imaging flow cy - tometry ( in Fig . 2 ) and isFISH scRNA - seq ( in Fig . 3 ) data suggest that maxRNA are not uniformly present in all cell types , and monocytes are a major maxRNA - presenting cell type in human PBMCs . Antisense purification and sequencing of maxRNAs from primary human cells To interrogate the functional relevance of maxRNAs in PBMCs , we asked what are the maxRNA - producing genes in these cells . To answer this question , we devel - oped Surface - FISHseq to sequence the isFISH - captured candidate maxRNAs . The central idea of Surface - FISHseq is to purify the cell surface RNAs through hybridization with biotin - tagged probes , and then subject the purified RNA for se - quencing ( Fig . 4a ) . Compared to the previously described BrU labeling and Surface - seq , the Surface - FISHseq enables maxRNA capture and purification from primary live cells with minimal perturbation . Additionally , it allows for a micro - scopic examination of probe hybridization at the cell surface before proceeding to the sequencing steps . We reasoned that even if maxRNAs exist , their relative quantity would be signifi - cantly less than intracellular RNAs . Thus , a successful maxRNA purification procedure will have to be highly selective . To this end , we carried out 3 Surface - FISHseq experi - ments . The 3 experiments shared the core Surface - FISHseq experimental pipeline , and each experiment contained an additional selection step to remove non - maxRNA pre - senting cells or intracellular components ( Fig . 4a , Additional file 1 : Table S2 , Fig . S6A ) . We did not anticipate identical results from these 3 experiments due to their differ - ences in RNA - enrichment and membrane collection methods . In the first experiment , we purified the cell membrane before the pulldown of the probe - RNA hybrids ( Surface - FISHseq - membrane ) . We generated 3 Surface - FISHseq - membrane libraries from PBMC samples derived from 3 different donors ( Fig . 4c , e , membrane + tracks in red ) . In parallel , we generated 3 control libraries from total purified membrane RNA from these same PBMC samples ( Membrane control tracks in blue , Fig . 4c , e ) . A comparison of Surface - FISHseq - membrane libraries against control libraries based on DEseq2 [ 14 ] resulted in 5722 RNAs at the Huang et al .

In the second experiment , we used FACS to collect isFISH + cells , followed by maxRNA biotin - purification and sequencing ( Surface - FISHseq - FACS ) . We gener - ated 2 Surface - FISHseq - FACS libraries from 2 PBMC samples of 2 donors ( FACS + tracks in red , Fig . 4c and E ) . Two control libraries were generated from pulldown using the dArt4 probe , from the same 2 PBMC samples ( FACS control tracks in blue , Fig . 4c , e ) . A comparison between the test and the control libraries based on DEseq2 [ 14 ] resulted in 1976 RNAs at the significance level of FDR < 0 . 15 ( green circle , Fig . 4b ) . In the third experiment , we used psoralen to reversibly cross - link with ultraviolet light the hybridized probes to their RNA targets . We then purified probe - bound maxRNA for sequencing ( Surface - FISHseq Psoralen ) . Psoralen only cross - links hybrid - ized nucleic acids and does not cross - link nucleotides with proteins , which , when com - bined with subsequent stringent washes , minimizes indirect interactions or promiscuously attached molecules . In total , 4 libraries were generated for this experi - ment , including 1 targeted maxRNA library ( Psoralen + track in red , Fig . 4c , e ) and 3 control libraries . The first control library is obtained following the same procedure of the targeted maxRNA library , except omitting psoralen during the cross - linking step . The remaining 2 control libraries used a 20 - nt probe against dArt4 in place of the 20 - mer oligo library and were carried out with and without psoralen cross - linking ( psor - alen control tracks in blue , Fig . 4c , e ) . A comparison of the experiment and the control libraries based on DEseq2 [ 14 ] resulted in 1571 RNAs at the significance level of FDR < 0 . 15 ( orange circle , Fig . 4b ) . Pairwise comparisons of the 3 experiments revealed significant overlaps of genes de - tected from each experiment ( odds ratio between experiments 1 and 2 = 4 . 53 , p value < 2 . 2e − 16 ; odds ratio between experiments 1 and 3 = 19 . 65 , p value < 2 . 2e − 16 ; odds ratio between experiments 2 and 3 = 5 . 08 , p value < 2 . 2e − 16 ) . A total of 118 maxRNA genes were identified by all 3 Surface - FISHseq experiments ( intersection , Fig . 4b ) . Taken to - gether , Surface - FISHseq prioritized specific maxRNAs for downstream tests of their possible relevance to cellular functions . Cell - cell interactions are impaired by blocking specific maxRNAs Considering the correlation between maxRNA presentation and monocytes among all PBMC cell types , we evaluated next whether maxRNAs impact cellular functions of the monocytes . We prioritized cell - cell interactions based on the biological functions of monocytes and the requirement of surface molecules in the cell - cell interactions . As one of the major cell types in innate immune and inflammatory response , monocytes have the unique property to interact with a wide range of cell types , including platelets [ 23 ] , vascular endothelial cells ( ECs ) [ 24 ] , and smooth muscle cells [ 25 ] . Among these , monocyte - EC interaction is essential under both steady - state conditions and during in - flammatory responses [ 24 , 26 ] . This process , initiated by surface molecules , can be re - producibly quantified by monocyte - EC adhesion assay [ 24 , 26 ] . Therefore , we chose the monocyte - EC attachment level as a functional readout of the maxRNA . We tested a total of 11 Surface - FISHseq - prioritized candidate maxRNAs , namely IDH1 , NEDD4 , Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 9 of 23 CENPF , ATF1 , QKI , CEP350 , ARL14EP , CRNDE , CMTM6 , CTSS , and FNDC3B on the monocytes isolated from PBMCs ( Fig . 4b ) . To perturb the maxRNA without interfering with the function of the protein encoded by the mRNA of the same gene , we used extracellular hybridization with antisense probes . Specifically , these antisense probes were designed to target regions with high Surface - FISHseq read coverage , which correspond to the exposed regions of the candi - date maxRNAs ( Fig . 4c – f ) . For each maxRNA , we designed a probe - set comprised of 25 antisense oligos ( each 20 nt in length ) to target the parts of the transcripts with Surface - FISHseq read coverage ( test probe - sets ) . We incubated each probe - set with monocytes for 60 min before fluorescent - labeling and seeding them onto confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . The monocyte - EC attachment level was measured by a normalized fluorescent intensity reflecting the number of attached monocytes [ 27 ] . We also included 3 controls in the experiment . The first control was not incubated with any oligo probes ( no - probe control ) . The second control was with a probe - set comprised of 25 antisense oligos ( each 20 nt in length ) against dArt4 ( dArt4 control ) . The third control was a randomized 20 - nt probe - set ( random 20 - mer control ) . As expected , the two control groups did not exhibit a detectable difference in monocyte - EC attachment levels in 8 repeated experiments ( the first two columns , Fig . 4g ) . The probe - sets against IDH1 and NEDD4 did not induce a detectable differ - ence either ( Fig . 4g ) . Although probe - sets targeting CENPF , ATF1 , QKI , CEP350 , ARL14EP , and CRNDE resulted in lower monocyte - EC attachment levels as compared to the controls , none of these differences reached the threshold of Bonferroni - adjusted p value < 0 . 001 . Finally , the monocytes incubated with antisense probes against CTSS , FNDC3B , and CMTM6 exhibited reduced monocyte attachment levels ( Bonferroni - ad - justed p value < 0 . 001 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) ( Fig . 4g ) , suggesting that antisense probes against specific maxRNAs can attenuate the monocyte attachment to vascular ECs . Specific regions of maxRNAs modulate cell - cell interactions To test if any specific region of a maxRNA is responsible for the reduced monocyte at - tachment levels , we repeated the above experiments with individual 20 - nt probes . Based on Surface - FISHseq read coverage , we chose 9 probes from the FNDC3B probe - set for this test , including 4 probes targeting 4 exons ( Exon 22 , 24 – 26 ) and 5 probes targeting the 3 ′ UTR ( probe track , Fig . 4c , d ) . Similarly , we also included two controls , i . e . , a no - probe control and a 20 - nt probe against dArt4 ( dArt4 control ) . As expected , the no - probe control and the dArt4 control did not exhibit any detectable difference ( black and red bars , Fig . 4h ) . No significant difference was detected from 5 out of the 9 tested probes ( E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 , U1 , Fig . 4h ) , suggesting that not all parts of the FNDC3B tran - script were responsible for monocyte - EC attachment . However , each of the other 4 tested probes reduced the monocyte attachment levels as compared to the no - probe control ( Bonferroni - adjusted p value < 0 . 001 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) ( U2 , U3 , U4 , U5 , Fig . 4h ) . All these 4 probes targeted the 3 ′ tail of the 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 4d ) , consistent with a reproducible Surface - FISHseq peak in the 3 ′ portion of the 3 ′ UTR ( pink tracks , Fig . 4d ) . These data suggest that not all parts of a maxRNA are equally im - portant for their cell surface functions . Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 10 of 23 To test whether the above observation could be reproduced with another maxRNA , we repeated the experiment with 11 probes from the CTSS probe - set , in - cluding 1 intronic probe ( E1 ) , 1 exonic probe ( E2 ) , and 9 probes spanning the 3 ′ UTR ( bottom track , Fig . 4e , f ) . Neither the intronic probe ( E1 ) nor the exon probe ( E2 ) resulted in a significant change in the attachment levels ( Fig . 4i ) . The U7 probe at the center and U9 probe at the 3 ′ end of the 3 ′ UTR did not affect the attachment level ei - ther . However , all the other 7 probes targeting 3 ′ UTR of CTSS show a trend towards reduc - tion of monocyte attachment levels , with U2 , U3 , and U8 probes reaching the significance level of Bonferroni - adjusted p value < 0 . 001 ( Kruskal - Wallis test ) . Taken together , monocyte - EC interactions can be modulated by extracellular hybridization of antisense oli - gos targeting towards specific parts of FNDC3B and CTSS transcripts . These data suggest that the exposure of maxRNAs to the extracellular milieu is required for proper cell - cell interactions . Discussion The driving question : does maxRNA exist ? Cells use surface molecules for self - presentation , intercellular recognition , and extracel - lular interactions . Discoveries of cell - surface receptors , glycans , and functional lipids have made fundamental impacts on biology [ 28 – 30 ] . Our driving question is whether there is a class of RNAs that are presented on the cell surface ? And if the answer is yes , what are their functional impacts on the surface - RNA presenting cell ? The difficulty in addressing this question is the lack of information on the genes , cell types , and cellular functions that may be relevant to this question . To address these challenges , we broke the driving question into the following three parts : ( 1 ) existence : is there maxRNA in any cell type ? ( 2 ) specificity : is maxRNA presenta - tion universal to all cell types or preferential to certain cell types ? ( 3 ) function : is there a functional impact of any maxRNA on its presenting cell ? The first question is directly aligned with our driving question , and the answers to the second and third questions can be regarded as extension and validation of the answer to the first question . To test the existence of maxRNA , we identified candidate maxRNAs by Surface - seq and validated specific maxRNAs with RNA - FISH on the cell surface . To test cell - type specificity , we evaluated whether maxRNA correlates with any surface protein markers or cell - type - specific transcripts . To this end , we subjected cells co - stained with maxRNA and other marker proteins to imaging flow cytometry ( Fig . 2 ) analysis . We also subjected maxRNA presenting ( maxRNA + ) and maxRNA - subpopulations to single - cell transcriptome analyses . These analyses suggest that maxRNAs tend to be presented on the cell types that often involve cell - cell contacts , such as monocytes and their dendritic progeny cells . Consistently , the identified genes producing maxRNA included those involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling , such as FNDC3B [ 31 ] and CTSS [ 32 ] . The functions of these genes align with the properties of monocytes in binding and transmigration through the vascular endothelium [ 33 , 34 ] . For functional tests , the abovementioned indications have led us to prioritize the analyses of monocyte - EC in - teractions . Monocyte - EC attachment was attenuated by extracellular perturbation of certain maxRNAs . Collectively , these data indicate the existence of maxRNA . Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 11 of 23 Survival from extracellular RNase Due to the abundance of excreted RNase , unprotected RNA is quickly degraded in the extracellular space [ 35 ] . The remaining extracellular RNA must be protected by either encapsulation in extracellular vesicles or lipoproteins , or the steric hindrance of RNA - binding proteins or lipids [ 36 – 38 ] . maxRNA cannot be protected by encapsulation , leaving steric hindrance the only possible means of protection . Thus , maxRNA is ex - pected to be the small amount of post - RNase processing RNA fragments or small RNAs , protected from further RNase digestion by the steric hindrance of the mem - brane proteins and lipids . Consistent with this expectation , our maxRNA sequencing data revealed RNA fragments rather than full - length transcripts ( Fig . 1d and 4c – f ) . Major remaining questions : origin , stabilization , and the role of maxRNAs Our data nominated nuclear - encoded RNA as a type of cell surface molecules in mam - malian systems . These data have provoked a series of questions worthy of future inves - tigations , especially ( 1 ) how is maxRNA transported to cell surface ? ( 2 ) how is maxRNA anchored on the cell surface ? and ( 3 ) how does maxRNA impact membrane functions ? Hypotheses for maxRNA translocation to the cell surface Like other cell surface molecules , maxRNA does not have to be produced by the sur - face molecule - presenting cell . There are at least three classes of pathways by which a molecule can be translocated and stabilized onto a cell ’ s surface . The first class includes the soluble paracrine or endocrine signaling molecules that are bound to the surface re - ceptors on the target cells . The second class is called trogocytosis , which “ is a process whereby lymphocytes ( B , T and NK cells ) conjugated to antigen - presenting cells extract surface molecules from these cells and express them on their own surface ” [ 39 ] . The third class is the translocation of intracellular molecules onto the cell surface . In all the 3 classes , the molecule - producing cells can be dying cells [ 1 , 39 , 40 ] . In line with the third class of pathways , bacterial ribonucleoprotein complexes are comprised of both RNA and transmembrane proteins and the RNA is required for these complexes to localize to the cell membrane [ 4 ] . Anchoring maxRNA on the cell surface Plausible means of stabilization of maxRNA on the cell surface include ( 1 ) forming a ri - bonucleoprotein complex with a transmembrane protein , ( 2 ) covalently linked with sur - face glycans including glycoproteins and glycolipids , and ( 3 ) bound with membrane lipids . Plausible roles of maxRNAs in membrane functions The next major question is how maxRNAs mediate membrane functions . At least 2 plausible models can be speculated . In the first model , the maxRNA contained with a ribonucleoprotein complex helps to anchor the associated protein on the cell mem - brane to perform its membrane - related function . If this model is correct , we should an - ticipate seeing all of the following : ( 1 ) a membrane - associated protein that is also an mRNA - binding protein [ 41 ] , ( 2 ) the mRNA or a fragment of the mRNA of this protein Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 12 of 23 is a maxRNA , and ( 3 ) this protein ’ s membrane - related function is disrupted if the maxRNA is perturbated . The FNDC3B gene in our analysis meets all these expectations in that ( 1 ) FNDC3B has recently been identified as one of the human mRNA - binding proteins [ 41 ] , ( 2 ) the 3 ′ UTR of FNDC3B mRNA is presented on the surface of Surface - FISH + PBMCs ( Fig . 4c , d ) , and ( 3 ) FNDC3B is a fibronectin protein that binds integrins to facilitate cell adhesion and cell migration [ 42 ] , and perturbation of FNDC3B maxRNA reduced monocyte - EC adhesion ( Fig . 4g , h ) . Thus , the FNDC3B maxRNA ful - fills the expectations of this model . In the second model , the maxRNA may modulate the permeability of the local mem - brane [ 43 ] . In line with this model , synthetic RNAs are shown to be able to bind to the cell membrane , increase membrane permeability to ions and other polar molecules [ 44 ] , sustain temporary hydrate pores [ 44 ] , and form passive transport channels for amino acids [ 45 ] . Limitations of this study We have not visualized maxRNA with sufficient resolution to differentiate the two sides of the plasma membrane . The membrane thickness was estimated to be ap - proximately 3 . 7 nm [ 46 ] , which is smaller than the lateral resolution ( ~ 20 nm ) of the state of art super - resolution microscopy [ 47 ] . Electron microscopy ( EM ) can distinguish the lipid bilayer [ 48 ] . However , EM has a limited throughput due to “ time - consuming sample preparation ( and scanning ) ” [ 49 ] . Considering the small percentage of maxRNA presenting cells in a natural cell population , we anticipate that it will require imaging a large number of cells to obtain a set of reliable EM images of maxRNA . We cannot completely rule out the possibility of endocytosis of the experimental re - agents . However , we employed a series of methods to minimize and control for this possibility . First , all antibody labeling was carried out at 4 °C , a temperature that is gen - erally thought to minimize cellular uptake [ 50 ] . Second , we leveraged the MCNP tech - nology to improve the purity and control for the intra - / extracellular orientation of the collected cell membrane [ 12 ] . Third , we have confirmed a candidate maxRNA on the intact cell membrane by co - staining with Surface - FISH and a membrane - permeable dye ( Fig . 1k , l , Additional file 1 : Fig . S5 ) . Our probe incubation experiments cannot preclude endocytosis . We will discuss the technical constraints and our approach to ameliorate any possible concerns of endo - cytosis to the interpretation of the results . First , our goal of these experiments is to study the cellular functions under physio - logical conditions . Constrained by this goal , we could not apply the methods that sig - nificantly perturb the cell ’ s physiology . In particular , the probe hybridization experiments could not be carried out at 4 °C because 4 °C is approximately the melting temperature of a single pyrimidine base pair . Furthermore , we could not use the endo - cytosis inhibitors due to their interference with membrane protein distribution [ 51 ] and the boundary morphology of the cell [ 52 ] . Second , to minimize the chances of any RNA interference ( RNAi ) to any intracellular mRNA due to probe internalization , our probe incubation time was limited to 1 h . Such a short incubation time without transfection was in sharp contrast to the large number Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 13 of 23 of published RNAi experiments in monocytes . Monocyte RNAi protocols require over - night transfection to affect protein levels [ 53 ] . Furthermore , it is more difficult to change monocyte - EC attachment levels by RNAi . Even for the proteins that govern monocyte - EC interaction , it took 72 h of transduction and puromycin selection to ob - serve a quantifiable change on the monocyte - EC attachment levels [ 27 ] . Third , we used 3 types of controls in the probe incubation experiments . These con - trols provided quantitative assessments to the degree of internalization and non - specific membrane attachment . The isFISH experiments do not require the internalized probes , if any , to hybridize to any intracellular RNA to serve as the controls . Finally , it is difficult to expand the negative controls used in our isFISH experiments . This is because any RNA fragments including the intergenic transcripts have a chance of being maxRNA . Any oligonucleotide that is complementary to any part of the hu - man genome may not be a bona fide negative control . Thus , our 6 - mer random probe control cannot be regarded as absolutely a negative control . However , we expected these 6 - mer probes to yield weaker signals due to their weaker hybridization stability than the 20 - mer test probes . We hope this analysis helps to illustrate the difficulty in further expanding the collection of negative control probes . Conclusions The aforementioned RNA sequencing and RNA - FISH data indicate the presence of maxRNA . There is a large variation across cell types and significant heterogeneity of the cells within each cell type in terms of their maxRNA presentation . Some maxRNA may mediate intercellular interactions . These data suggest an expanded role for RNAs in cellu - lar life beyond previously envisioned . It can be rewarding for future studies to investigate the diversity of cell types , genes , environmental cues , and biogenesis pathways for maxRNA expression and presentation , and their contribution to cellular functions . Methods Cell lines and patient blood samples Cell lines were obtained through ATCC and cultured with their recommending culturing protocol and media . Murine lymphoma EL4 ( RRID : CVCL _ 0255 ) and human leukemia Jurkat T cells ( RRID : CVCL _ 0367 ) were cultured at 37 °C , 5 % CO2 in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) and RPMI 1640 medium ( Corning ) , respectively . Both cell cul - ture media were supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) heat - inactivated FBS , 2 mM glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids , and 100 U / mL each of penicillin G and streptomycin ( ThermoFisher ) . Leukoreduction system white blood cells ( LRS - WBC ) were collected from the healthy do - nors from the San Diego Blood Bank ( UCSD IRB Project # 181004XX ) . cultured in RPMI - 1640 media ( Corning ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) heat - inactivated FBS , 2 mM glutam - ine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , and 1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids ( ThermoFisher ) . Surface - seq analysis of EL4 cells Preparation of membrane - coated nanoparticle EL4 cell membranes were utilized to generate membrane nanoparticles , following the previously described protocol [ 10 ] . EL4 mouse lymphoma cells were cultured in T175 Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 14 of 23 flasks , collected ( ~ 1 . 2 – 1 . 5 billion total cells ) , and washed three times with PBS by cen - trifugation at 500× g for 5 min . Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 33 μ L protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma , # S8830 ) and 10 μ L RNAsin per 10 mL of solution ) and homogenized with a tight - fitting pestle for 20 passes . The homogenate is transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20 , 000× g for 20 min . This centrifugation removes intact cells and membrane - bounded organelles , such as mitochondria , nucleus , lysosomes , Golgi , apparatus , and endoplasmic reticulum . The obtained supernatant is then transferred into another ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100 , 000× g for 35 min . The super - natant containing enzymes , ribosomes , and metabolites are discarded , and the pellet was resuspended with storage buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , and RNa - sin [ Promega , cat . # N2111 ] at 1 : 1000 dilution ) . This step is repeated one more time , and membrane protein was quantified by BCA assay . PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method by adding 1 mL of PLGA ( PLGA - COOH , 0 . 67 dL / g , 10 mg / mL in acetone ) into 4 - mL water , and the or - ganic solvent was evaporated for 2 h . The membrane was diluted in storage buffer to a final protein concentration of 1 mg / mL . The PLGA nanoparticles were diluted to a final concentration of 2 mg / mL in water . Mix 1 mL of the membrane and 1 mL PLGA nano - particle and extrude through a 400 - nm polycarbonate membrane for 11 passes . The membrane - coated nanoparticles ( MCNPs ) are centrifuged at 21 , 000× g for 10 min . The supernatant was collected , and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 , supplemented with RNasin at 1 : 1000 dilution ) . RNA isolation from MCNPs RNA was isolated by adding 500 μ L of phenol ( acid phenol : CHCl 3 5 : 1 solution ( pH 4 . 5 ) ; Ambion cat . # AM9720 ) to 500 μ L of nanoparticle samples ( membrane concentra - tion of 2 mg / mL and PLGA nanoparticles of 4 mg / mL ) and mixed with gentle vortex for 5 s . The sample mix was incubated at 37 °C with a gentle vortex ( ~ 1100 rpm ) for 15 min and transferred to 2 mL Phase Lock Gel Heavy tubes ( Quantabio , cat . # 2302830 ) and centrifuged at 16 , 000× g for 5 min . The upper layer or aqueous phase was transferred to and new 2 - mL Eppendorf tube and 3 M Sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 5 , 1 : 10 ; Ambion ) was added for RNA precipitation followed by 1 . 5 volume of isopropanol . Samples were incubated at − 20 °C overnight and the next day washed twice with 80 % ethanol at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 °C . RNA quantification and quality were assessed using Qubit and Bioanalyzer . End repair of small RNA fragments We carried out end repair of 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of fragmented RNAs for library prepar - ation . End repair was carried out using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase ( NEB , cat . # MO201S ) that catalyzes the transfer and exchange of Pi from the gamma position of ATP to the 5 ′ - hydroxyl termini of the RNA fragment . It also catalyzes the removal of 3 ′ - phos - phoryl groups from 3 ′ - phosphoryl ends . End repair was carried out by adding all the following components in a 1 . 5 - mL Eppendorf tube : 0 . 5 μ L of Murine RNAase inhibitor , 2 μ L of 10X T4 PNK Buffer , 1 μ L of T4 PNK Enzyme , 2 . 5 μ L of Nuclease free water , and 12 μ L of purified small RNAs ( 100 ng ) in a total volume of 18 μ L . The components Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 15 of 23 were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a thermoblock followed by adding 2 μ L of 10 mM ATP . Incubation continued for another 30 min . Nuclease free water was added to complete the volume to 100 μ L for further purification using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit ( Qiagen cat . # 74204 ) . The yield and size distribution of the fragmented RNA was analyzed in the Bioanalyzer RNA Pico Chip . RNA library preparation After end repair , we continue the ligation of the 3 ′ and 5 ′ adaptors . Ligation of the 3 ′ SR adaptor was carried out as follows : 6 μ L of input RNA ( 100 ng ) and 1 μ L of 3 ′ SR adaptor for Illumina in a total volume of 7 μ L . The mix was incubated in a pre - heated thermal cy - cler for 2 min at 70 °C and a transfer tube on ice . After , the following components were added : 10 μ L of 2X 3 ′ Ligation Reaction Buffer and 3 μ L of 3 ′ ligation mix to a final volume of 20 μ L and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in a thermal cycler . To prevent adaptor - dimer for - mation , hybridization of the reverse transcription primer was carried out to remove excess 3 ′ SR adaptors that remain free after 3 ′ ligation reaction by transforming single - stranded DNA adaptor into double - stranded DNA molecule , which is not substrates for ligation - mediated by T4 RNA ligase and therefore does not ligate to the 5 ′ SR adaptor . To hybridize the reverse transcription primer , 1 μ L of the SR RT primer for Illumina was added to the 20 μ L sample and bring the volume to 25 . 5 μ L with 4 . 5 μ L nuclease - free water . Samples were incubated in the thermal cycler as follows : 75 °C / 5 ′ , 37 °C / 15 ′ , and 25 °C / 15 ′ . Ligation of the 5 ′ SR adaptor was carried out as follows : 1 μ L of denatured 5 ′ SR adaptor for Illu - mina , 1 μ L of 10X 5 ′ ligation reaction buffer , and 2 . 5 μ L of 5 ′ ligation mix in a final volume of 30 μ L . The new mix was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in a thermal cycler . Direct 3 ′ adaptor ligation on MCNPs Membrane - coated NPs generated from ~ 250 million suspension cells were centrifuged at 20 , 000× g for 20 min . The MCNP pellet was resuspended in 120 μ L of the 3 ′ ligation reaction mix ( 6 μ L of 3 ′ SR Adaptor , 60 μ L of 3 ′ Ligation Reaction Buffer , 18 μ L of 3 ′ Ligation Enzyme mix , 1 μ L RNase inhibitor , and 35 μ L 1x PBS ) and incubated at 25 °C during 1 h using PCR machine . Once incubation was completed , RNA was isolated using silane magnetic beads and resuspended in 120 μ L RNAse free water . RNA quality was assessed using Bioanalyzer . The isolated RNA was aliquoted in 6 PCR tubes , each with 20 μ L volume . Excess of 3 ′ adaptor was removed by adding 1 μ L of the reverse transcription primer and 4 . 5 μ L of RNA - free water to each PCR tube containing 20 μ L of RNA and incubated using the following program : 75 °C / 5 ′ , 37 °C / 15 ′ , and 25 °C / 15 ′ . The RT primer will hybridize to an unligated 3 ′ adaptor and will prevent the formation of adaptor - dimer formation . The following steps — 5 ′ adaptor ligation , reverse transcrip - tion , and library amplification — were performed using standard library preparation pro - cedures ( NEB cat . # E7300L ) . DNA enrichment was optimized by increasing the RNA input and the number of PCR cycles . Library size distribution was determined using Bioanalyzer and library size selection with Pippin HT . Computational analysis of Surface - seq data Adapter sequences and low - quality reads were trimmed from the raw sequence data with the Trimmomatic package [ 54 ] . Sequence alignment to the mouse genome Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 16 of 23 ( GRCm38 / mm10 ) was performed using STAR ( v2 . 7 . 3a ) [ 55 ] . featureCounts ( v1 . 6 . 4 ) [ 56 ] was used with GENCODE mouse gene annotation ( GRCm38 , release M24 ) to summarize gene read counts . DESeq2 [ 14 ] was used for differential analysis between the libraries from two technical variations . The normalized read counts generated by DEseq2 were used to calculate the counts per million ( CPM ) of each gene . Validation of maxRNA using Surface - FISH Probe design Oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized by IDT to hybridize to maxRNA targets Malat1 and Neat1 . Negative control probes were designed by replacing the middle 6 bases with random N bases . These probes were 35 – 40 nt in length , with simi - lar GC contents and melting temperatures . Conjugation of quantum dots to oligonucleotide probes Oligos were modified at the 5 ′ end with a primary amino group and a spacer of 30 car - bons to minimize the steric hindrance of probe - RNA hybridization . The carboxyl modi - fied quantum dots 605 / 705 ( Invitrogen , cat . # Q22001MP ) were conjugated to the amino group on the probes through EDC ( carbodiimide ) crosslinking reaction . The probes were subsequently purified with 0 . 2 - μ m membrane filtration ( Sartorius cat . # VS0172 ) and 100 , 000 ( Sartorius cat . # VS0141 ) molecular weight cut - off ( MWCO ) . The retentate of the 100 , 000 MWCO was subjected with dynabeads MyOne SILANE purification to remove any remaining unconjugated probes . A subsequent 0 . 2 - μ m membrane filtration was used to remove any final aggregates . Hybridization of suspension cell lines Probe hybridization in fixed EL4 cells was carried out as previously described [ 15 ] with - out the membrane permeabilization step . Briefly , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA , and no permeation was performed . Cells are then added to the previously described hybridization solution with quantum - dot - labeled probes . Cells are then incubated at 37 °C overnight . Cells were subsequently washed twice in wash buffer ( 50 % formamide , 2x SSC ) and resuspended in 1x PBS for imaging . Imaging and analysis Cells were imaged in 1x PBS through wide - field fluorescence imaging using an Olym - pus IX83 inverted microscope at × 60 oil immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 4 ) . Image pro - cessing was carried out as previously described [ 57 ] . Briefly , single transcripts were detected using an automated thresholding algorithm that searches windows of possible cutoff thresholds and selects thresholds where counts do not change within a range . Characterization of PBMCs by isFISH PBMC isolation Ten milliliters of the LRS - WBC samples obtained from the San Diego Blood Bank was transferred to CPT vacutainer tubes ( BD cat . # 362753 ) . Blood samples were mixed by inverting the tube 8 – 10 times immediately before centrifugation . Blood samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 25 min at 1800× g . In the tissue culture hood , open Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 17 of 23 a spun CPT tube and carefully discard the serum . Gently pipet up and down around the top and sides of the gel plug to dislodge and PBMCs that are stuck to it without touching the plug . Transfer to a new labeled 15 - mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 400× g for 5 min . Wash PBMCs twice with PBS or cell media and culture cells for 30 min in suspension flasks before labeling . Antisense library and control probe design Random 20 - mer libraries were generated with 20 random N bases with Alexafluor 647 conjugated to the 3 ′ end from IDT . Random 6 - mer libraries were generated with 6 ran - dom N bases with Alexafluor 647 conjugated to the 3 ′ end from IDT . dArt4 probe / 5Alex647N / TTAATCATAATCGTATTGGG was synthesized from IDT with Alexafluor 647 conjugated to the 3 ′ end . Antisense probe hybridization Oligo libraries were denatured and linearized at 70 °C for 5 min and kept at 37 °C be - fore hybridization . Cells were incubated with probes ( 10 nM final concentration ) at 1 million cells / mL cell media for 1 h at 37 °C . Cells were then washed twice with 1x PBS , stained with a recommended concentration of antibodies at 4C for cell surface markers CD14 ( monocytes ) , CD3 ( T cells ) , CD19 ( B cells ) , live / dead fixable yellow ( BioLegend , cat . # 301806 [ RRID : AB _ 314188 ] , 300406 [ RRID : AB _ 314059 ] , 302230 [ RRID : AB _ 2073119 ] and 423104 ) and nucBlue live cell stain ( Thermo Fisher cat . # R37605 ) . For fluorophore only control Alexafluor 647 Isotype control was used ( Biolegend cat . # 400130 ) . Cells were then washed twice with 1x PBS to remove excess . Imaging and analysis For imaging with microscopy , cells were imaged in 1x PBS through Widefield fluores - cence imaging using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope at × 60 oil immersion ob - jective ( NA = 1 . 4 ) . For imaging with imaging flow cytometry , cells were imaged using the Amnis ImageStreamX Mk II imaging flow cytometer with × 60 magnification . Com - pensation was done using ultracomp beads ( Invitrogen cat . # 01 - 2222 - 41 ) with the cor - responding fluorophores . Image analysis was done using the Amnis IDEAS Software where cells were gated for live / dead using a dye and single - focused cells using the areas and gradient RMS separately . PBMCs were gated for CD14 , CD3 , and CD19 . Surface - FISHseq analysis Single - cell RNA sequencing and analysis PBMCs were isolated either through FACS ( BD FACSAria ™ Fusion flow cytometer ) or biotin pulldown for maxRNA positive and negative cells . We used Chromium Single Cell 3 ′ Reagent kit v3 . 1 ( 10x genomics ) to generate single - cell RNA - seq libraries , which were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq4000 ( IGM Genomics Center , UCSD ) . Single - cell clustering and visualization were done using Seurat 3 [ 58 ] , and the classification of cells was done using the singleCellNet R package [ 22 ] . The training set for singleCell - Net analysis was generated using a published single - cell transcriptome dataset from 68 k PBMCs [ 59 ] . Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 18 of 23 Antisense probe hybridization Oligo probe libraries were denatured at 70 °C , 5 min and kept at 37 °C before hybridization . Cells or PBMCs were suspended in culture media at 1 million cells / mL and were incubated with an oligonucleotide library ( final concentration 10 nM ) for 1 h at 37 °C . Cells were washed three times in 1x PBS and pelleted by centrifuging at 500× g for 5 min . Psoralen cross - linking The cell pellet was resuspended ( ~ 250 million cells ) in 5 mL of ice - cold 4 ′ - Aminomethyl - trioxsalen hydrochloride ( AMT ) solution ( 0 . 5 mg / mL in PBS ; Sigma , cat . # A4330 ) and in - cubated on ice for 15 min . The cell suspension was transferred to a pre - chilled 10 - cm tissue culture dish , which was then placed on ice under a long - wave UV bulb ( 350 nm ) in a UV Stratalinker 2400 ( Stratagene ) . Cells should be approximately 3 – 4 cm away from the light source . Crosslinking of probe - maxRNA chimeras was performed under UV light at maximum power ( 6500 μ W / cm 2 ) for 10 min , with gentle mixing every 2 . 5 min . Cells were then transferred to cold tubes and pelleted at 330× g for 4 min . Membrane isolation Cells were resuspended in 1 mL hypotonic lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH = 7 . 5 , 10 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 33 μ L protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) and 10 μ L RNasin per 10 mL of solution ) and incubated on ice for 15 min . Cell membranes were dis - rupted using a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer with a tight - fitting pestle ( Size B ) for 20 passes . The homogenates were transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 20 min to remove membrane - bounded organelles . In a fresh ultracentri - fuge tube , the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100 , 000× g for 35 min , to pellet the membrane and remove ribosomes , RNAs , and other cytosolic molecules . The pellet was resuspended in storage buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 μ L RNasin per 10 mL of solution ) . Centrifuge at 100 , 000× g for 35 min . Membrane - associated RNA concentration was quantified by Qubit . maxRNA streptavidin bead pulldown Streptavidin C1 ( Invitrogen ) beads were subjected to RNase removal treatment , blocked in BSA / PBST at 4 °C until ready . The beads were washed in B & W buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 1 mM EDTA , 2 M NaCl ) and incubated membrane extracts per at 4 °C for 1 h and RT for 30 min . Beads were washed three times in urea low salt wash buffer ( 8 M Urea , 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 10 % NP - 40 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 50 % SDS ) , three times in high salt wash buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % Tween 20 ) , and once with PNK wash buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl2 ) . Reverse cross - linking were performed in the plate under a short - wave UV bulb ( 265 nm ) in a UV Stratalinker 2400 ( Stratagene ) . maxRNA library generation and sequencing Libraries were generated using the NEB Low Input / Single Cell library prep kit ( NEB cat . # E6420S ) . Paired - end sequencing of the library was performed using Illumina Min - iseq Platform , using the High Output reagent kit ( 150 - cycles ) . Huang et al . Genome Biology ( 2020 ) 21 : 225 Page 19 of 23 Computational analysis of Surface - FISHseq Adapter sequences and low - quality reads were trimmed from the raw sequence data with the Trimmomatic package [ 54 ] . A minimum of 50 - bp read length filter was ap - plied . Sequence alignment to the human genome ( GRCh38 / hg38 ) was performed using STAR ( v2 . 7 . 3a ) [ 55 ] . The resulting bam file was sorted and uniquely mapped reads were counted using featureCounts [ 56 ] with GENCODE human gene annotation ( GRCh38 , release 33 ) . The genes with the normalized counts ≤ 5 were excluded from further analysis . Two sample comparison of the test libraries vs . the control libraries was carried out by using the R / Bioconductor package DESeq2 [ 14 ] requiring the FDR ( Benjamini - Hochberg ad - justment ) > 0 . 15 and fold change > 2 . Pathways analysis was performed using the Toppgene Suite [ 60 ] . Top non - redundant pathways were plotted for genes identified in two or more Surface - FISH - seq experi - ments . Pathways were filtered by FDR and ranked by the ratio between genes from in - put versus total genes in ontology , as indicated on the y - axis . Monocyte attachment assay CD14 + monocytes were isolated directly from human whole blood samples using StraightFrom LRSC CD14 MicroBead Kit ( Miltenyi Biotec , cat . # 130 - 117 - 026 ) , follow - ing the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Cells were stained with Calcein AM ( 2 . 5 μ M , Biole - gend cat . # 425201 ) for 15 min at 37 °C for live - cell fluorescent tracking . Meanwhile , oligonucleotide probes were denatured at 70 °C , 5 min , and kept at 37 °C before hybridization . Cells were washed and resuspended in serum - free RPMI media at 10 6 cells / mL and evenly segregated for hybridization with oligonucleotide probes at an equal molar concentration ( 10 nM ) for 1 h at 37 °C . After incubation , cells were washed thoroughly in PBS for three times and were seeded onto a confluent layer of HUVECs ( RRID : CVCL _ 2959 ) in 96 - well plates pre - pared 48 – 72 h before the experiment . Cells were incubated for 30 min to allow for at - tachment . Unattached cells were removed with PBS washes . Attachment of the fluorescently labeled monocytes was quantified using the SpectraMax i3x Multi - Mode Microplate Reader from 4 wells , with the sum value from 132 read points per well as final fluorescence output . Statistical summary and tests were performed in Prism 8 . P values were generated by Kruskal - Wallis nonparametric test for multiple comparisons against the control groups with Bonferroni adjustments .
