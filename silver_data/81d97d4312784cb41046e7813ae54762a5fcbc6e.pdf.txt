A prime example of this concerns the mouse X - inactivation centre ( Xic ) , which orchestrates the initiation of X - chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) by controlling the expression of the non - protein - coding Xist transcript . The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown . Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon - copy ( 5C ) 2 and super - resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4 . 5 - megabases ( Mb ) region including Xist . We discover a series of discrete 200 - kilobase to 1Mb topologically associating domains ( TADs ) , present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X . TADs align with , but do not rely on , several domain - wide features of the epigenome , such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina - associated domains . TADsalsoalignwithcoordinatelyregulatedgeneclusters . Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal con - tacts and long - range transcriptional misregulation . The Xist / Tsix sense / antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods , with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs , each containingtheirknownpositiveregulators . Weidentify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsixwithin its TAD , which pro - duces a long intervening RNA , Linx . In addition to uncovering a newprincipleofcis - regulatoryarchitectureofmammalianchromo - somes , our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X - inactivation centre . The X - inactivation centre was originally defined by deletions and translocations as a region spanning several megabases 3 , 4 , and contains several elements known to affect Xist activity , including its repressive antisense transcript Tsix and its regulators Xite , DXPas34 and Tsx 5 , 6 . However , additional control elements must exist , as single - copy trans - genes encompassing Xist and up to 460kb of flanking sequences are unable to recapitulate proper Xist regulation 7 . To characterize the cis - regulatorylandscapeofthe Xic inanunbiasedapproach , weperformed 5C 2 across a 4 . 5 - Mb region containing Xist . We designed 5C - Forward and 5C - Reverse oligonucleotides following an alternating scheme 2 , thereby simultaneously interrogating nearly 250 , 000 possible chromo - somal contacts in parallel , with a mean resolution of 10 – 20kb ( Fig . 1a ; see Supplementary Methods ) . Analysis of undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) revealed that long - range ( . 50kb ) con - tacts preferentially occur within a series of discrete genomic blocks , each covering 0 . 2 – 1Mb ( Fig . 1b ) . These blocks differ from the higher - order organization recently observed by Hi - C 8 , corresponding to much larger domains of open or closed chromatin , that come together in the nucleus to form A and B types of compartments 8 . Instead , our 5C analysis shows self - associating chromosomal domains occurring at the sub - megabase scale . The size and location of these domains is identical in male and female mouse ESCs ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and in different mouse ESC lines ( Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Data 1 ) . To examine this organization with an alternative approach , we per - formed three - dimensional DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) in male mouse ESCs . Nuclear distances were found to be sig - nificantly shorter between probes lying in the same 5C domain than in different domains ( Fig . 1c , d ) , and a strong correlation was found between three - dimensional distances and 5C counts ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . Furthermore , using pools of tiled bacterial artificial chro - mosome ( BAC ) probes spanning up to 1Mb and structured illumina - tion microscopy , we found that large DNA segments belonging to the same 5C domain colocalize to a greater extent than DNA segments locatedinadjacentdomains ( Fig . 1e ) , andthis throughout thecellcycle ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) . Based on 5C and FISH data , we conclude that chromatin folding at the sub - megabase scale is not random , and partitions this chromosomal region into a succession of topologically associating domains ( TADs ) . We next investigated what might drive chromatin folding in TADs . We first noticed a striking alignment between TADs and the large blocks of H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 ( ref . 9 ) that are known to exist throughout the mammalian genomes 10 – 13 ( for example , TAD E , Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . We therefore examined 5C profiles of G9a 2 / 2 ( also known as Ehmt2 ) mouse ESCs , which lack H3K9me2 , notably at the Xic 14 , and Eed 2 / 2 mouse ESCs , which lack H3K27me3 ( ref . 15 ) . No obvious change in overall chromatin conformation was observed , andTADs were notaffected eitherin size orposition inthese mutants ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Thus TAD formation is not due to domain - wide H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 enrichment . Instead , such segmental chromatin blocks might actually be delimited by the spatial partitioning of chromosomes into TADs . We then addressed whether folding in TADs is driven by discrete boundary elementsat their borders . 5C was performedin a mouse ESC line carrying a 58 - kb deletion ( D XTX 16 ) , encompassing the boundary between the Xist and Tsix TADs ( D and E ; Fig . 2b ) . We observed ectopic contacts between sequences in TADs D and E and an altered organization of TAD E . Boundary elements can thus mediate the spatial segregation of neighbouring chromosomal segments . Within the TAD D – E boundary , a CTCF - binding site was recently implicated ininsulating Tsix fromremoteregulatoryinfluences 17 . However , align - mentofCTCF - andcohesin - bindingsitesinmouseESCs 18 withour5C data showed that , although these factors are present at most TAD boundaries ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , they are also frequently present within TADs , excluding them as the sole determinants of TAD * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 InstitutCurie , 26rued’Ulm , ParisF - 75248 , France . 2 CNRSUMR3215 , ParisF - 75248 , France . 3 INSERMU934 , ParisF - 75248 , France . 4 ProgramsinSystemsBiologyandGeneFunctionandExpression , DepartmentofBiochemistryandMolecularPharmacology , UniversityofMassachusettsMedicalSchool , Worcester , Massachusetts01605 - 0103 , USA . 5 INSERMU900 , Paris , F - 75248France . 6 Mines ParisTech , Fontainebleau , F - 77300France . 7 InstituteofPathology , Charite´ – Universita¨tsmedizin , 10117Berlin , andInstituteof TheoreticalBiologyHumboldtUniversita¨t , 10115Berlin , Germany . 8 DepartmentofBiochemistryandBiophysics , UniversityofCaliforniaSanFrancisco , SanFrancisco , California94158 - 2517 , USA . 9 DepartmentofReproductionandDevelopment , ErasmusMC , University MedicalCenter , 3000CARotterdam , TheNetherlands . 1 7 M AY 2 0 1 2 | VO L 4 8 5 | N AT U R E | 3 8 1 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Furthermore , the fact that the two neighbouring domains do not merge completely in D XTX cells ( Fig . 2b ) implies that addi - tional elements , within TADs , can act as relays when a main boundary is removed . The factors underlying an element’s capacity to act as a canonical or shadow boundary remain to be investigated . Next we asked whether TAD organization changes during differ - entiation or XCI . Both male neuronal progenitors cells ( NPCs ) and male primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) show similar organization to mouse ESCs , with no obvious change in TAD posi - tioning . However , consistentdifferencesintheinternalcontactswithin TADswereobserved ( Fig . 3a , SupplementaryFigs2and5 ) . Noticeably , some TADs were found to become lamina - associated domains 19 ( LADs ) at certain developmental stages ( Fig . 3b ) . Thus chromosome segmentation into TADs reveals a modular framework where changes in chromatin structure or nuclear positioning can occur in a domain - wide fashion during development . We then assessed TAD organization on the inactive X , by combin - ing Xist RNA FISH , to identify the inactive X , and super - resolution DNA FISH using BAC probe pools on female MEFs . We found that colocalization indices on the inactive X were still higher for sequences belonging to thesameTAD than forneighbouring TADs ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 6a ) . However , the difference was significantly lower for the inactive X than for the active X . Deconvolution of the respective con - tributions of the active X and inactive X in 5C data from female MEFs ( see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) similarly revealed that global organization in TADs remains on the inactive X , albeit in a much attenuated form , but that specific long - range contacts within TADs are lost . This , together with a recent report focused on longer - range interactions 20 , suggests that the inactive X has a more random chromosomal organization than its active homo - logue , even below the megabase scale . We next investigated how TAD organization relates to gene expression dynamics during early differentiation . A transcriptome analysis , consistingofmicroarraymeasurementsat17timepointsover the first 84h of female mouse ESC differentiation was performed ( Fig . 4a ) . During this time window , most genes in the 5C region were either up - or downregulated . Statistical analysis demonstrated that expression profiles of genes with promoters located within the same TAD are correlated ( Fig . 4b ) . This correlation ( median correlation coefficient cc of 0 . 40 ) is significantly higher than for genes in different domains ( ccof 0 . 03 , P , 10 2 9 ) or for genes across the X chromosome in randomly selected , TAD - size regions ( cc of 0 . 09 , P , 10 2 7 ) . The observed correlations within TADs seem not to depend on distance between genes , and are thus distinct from previously described corre - lations between neighbouring genes 21 that decay on a length scale of approximately 100kb ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Our findings indicate that physical clustering within TADs may be used to coordinate gene expression patterns during development . Furthermore , deletion of the boundary between Xist and Tsix in D XTX cells was accompanied by long - range transcriptional misregulation ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , underliningtherolethatchromosomepartitioningintoTADscanplayinlong - range transcriptional control . A more detailed analysis of each domain ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) revealed that co - expression is particularly pronounced in TADs D , E 1 Mb 5C - Forward 5C - Reverse Unused ( repeat ) a 1 Mb Slc16a2 Ftx Jpx Tsx Chic1 Cdx4 Nap1l2 Xist Zcchc13 Rnf12 50 kb Ppnx Tsix Xpr Xite d 3D DNA FISH – Fosmid probes P e r ce n t a g e o f l o c i p a i r s b 100 M b 101 M b 102 M b B F G H I E D C A T A D s 1 μ m 2 98 % of max Median count in 30 - kb window 3D distance ( μ m ) ( ) ( ) n = 100 , P < 10 – 9 * Fosmid probes chrX 99 Mb 100 Mb 101 Mb 102 Mb 99 M b 103 Mb chrX 99 . 5 Mb 100 Mb 100 . 5 Mb 101 Mb 101 . 5 Mb 102 Mb 102 . 5 Mb 103 Mb Ogt Cxcr3Nhsl2 Rgag4Rgag4 Pin4 Ercc6lRps4xCited1 Hdac8 Phka1Phka1 Gm9112Dmrtc1b Gm5166 Dmrtc1c2Dmrtc1c1Dmrtc1c2Dmrtc1c1 1700031F05RikDmrtc1a Gm5126 Nap1l2 4930519F16Rik Cdx4Chic1TsxTsixXistXist Jpx Gm9159FtxZcchc13 Slc16a2Gm6222 Rnf12C77370Mir672 Abcb7 Uprt Zdhhc15 Magee25530601H04Rik2610029G23RikMagee1E530001F21Rik5330434G04RikCypt2 - ps Fgf16Atrx Magt1 Magt1Cox7bAtp7a Tlr13Pgk1 Taf9 b 103 M b BAC probes pool I 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 1008060 40 200 Pool I Pool II Nuclear background Colocalization index ( Pearson’s coefficients ) 3D DNA FISH – BAC probe pools n = 195 , P < 2 × 10 – 12 e 1 μ m * * 0 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 c Pool I Pool II BAC probes pool II 500 kb F G H I E D T A D s Figure 1 | Chromosome partitioning into topologically associating domains ( TADs ) . a , Distribution of 5C - Forward and 5C - Reverse HindIII restriction fragments across the 4 . 5Mb analysed showing positions of RefSeq genes and known XCI regulatory loci . b , 5C data sets from XY undifferentiated mouse ESCs ( E14 ) , displaying median counts in 30 - kb windows every 6kb .

Although correlations are strongest within TADs , there is some correlation between TADs showing the same trend , such as TADs D and F , which are both downregulated during differenti - ation . Only TAD E , which contains Xist and all of its known positive regulators Jpx , Ftx , Xpr / Xpct and Rnf12 5 ( Jpx , Ftx , Xpct and Rnf12 are alsoknown as Enox , B230206F22Rik , Slc16a2 and Rlim , respectively ) is anti - correlated with most other genes in the 4 . 5 Mb region , being upregulated during differentiation ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . The fact that these coordinately upregulated loci are located in the same TAD suggests that they are integrated into a similar cis - regulatory network , potentially sharing common cis - regulatory elements . We therefore predict that TAD E ( , 550kb ) represents the minimum 5 9 regulatory region required for accurate Xist expression , explaining why even the largest transgenes tested so far ( covering 150kb 5 9 to Xist , Fig . 5a ) cannot recapitulate normal Xist expression 7 . The respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lie in two neighbouring TADs with transcription crossing the intervening boundary ( Fig . 2b ) , consistent with previous 3C experiments 22 . Whereas the Xist promoter and its positive regulators are located in TAD E , the promoter of its antisense repressor , Tsix , lies in TAD D , which extends up to Ppnx ( also known as 4930519F16Rik ) / Nap1l2 , more than 200kb away ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , inadditiontothe Xite enhancer , more distant elements within TAD D may participate in Tsix regulation . To test this we used two different single - copy transgenic mouse lines , Tg53 and Tg80 ( ref . 23 ) . Both transgenes contain Xist , Tsix and Xite ( Fig . 5a ) . Tg53 encompasses the whole of TAD D , whereas Tg80 is truncated just 5 9 to Xite ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . In the inner cell mass of male mouse embryos at embryonic day 4 . 0 ( E4 . 0 ) , Tsix transcripts could be readily detected from Tg53 , as well as fromthe endogenous X ( Fig . 5b ) . However , no Tsix expression could bedetected from Tg80 , which lacks the distal portion of TAD D ( Fig . 5b ) . Thus , sequences within TAD D must contain essential elements for the correct developmental regu - lation of Tsix . Within TAD D , several significant looping events involving the Tsix promoter or its enhancer Xite were detected ( Figs 2b and 5a , Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Alignment of 5C maps with chromatin sig - natures of enhancers in mouse ESCs ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) sug - gested the existence of multiple regulatory elements within this region . We also identified a transcript initiating approximately 50kb upstream of the Ppnx promoter ( Fig . 5a ) , from a region bound by pluripotency factors and corresponding to a predicted promoter for a large ( 80kb ) intervening non - coding RNA ( lincRNA 24 , Supplemen - tary Fig . 12 ) which we termed Linx ( large intervening transcript in the Xic ) . Linx RNA shares several features with non - coding RNAs , such as accumulation around its transcription site 25 ( Fig . 5c ) , nuclear enrich - ment and abundance of the unspliced form 26 ( Supplementary Fig . 12 and 13 ) . Linx and Tsix are co - expressed in the inner cell mass of blastocysts from E3 . 5 – 4 . 0 onwards , as well as in male and female mouseESCs ( Fig . 5c ) .

Triple RNA FISH for Linx , Tsix and Xist in differentiating female mouse ESCs ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) revealed that before Xist upregulation , the probability of Tsix expression from alleles co - expressing Linx is significantly higher than from alleles that do not express Linx ( Fig . 5d ) . Furthermore , Linx expression is fre - quently monoallelic , even before Xist upregulation ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) , revealing a transcriptional asymmetry of the two Xic alleles before XCI . Taken together , our experimentsbased on 5C , transgenesis and RNA FISH , point towards a role for Linx in the long - range tran - scriptional regulation of Tsix — either through its chromosomal asso - ciation with Xite and / or via the RNA it produces . This analysis of the Xist / Tsix region illustrates how spatial compartmentalization of chromosomal neighbourhoods in TADs partitions the Xic into two large regulatory domains , with opposite transcriptional fates ( Sup - plementary Fig . 15 ) . In conclusion , our study reveals that sub - megabase folding of mammalian chromosomes results in the self - association of large chromosomal neighbourhoods in the three - dimensional space of the nucleus . The stability of such partitioning throughout differentiation , X inactivation and in cell lines with impaired histone - modifying machineries , indicates that this level of chromosomal organization may provide a basic framework onto which other domain - wide Ppnx / Linx N a p 1 l 2 C d x 4 C h i c 1 T sx T s i x X i s t F t x Z cc h c 13 S l c 16 a 2 R n f 12 C 77370 A b c b 7 U p r t Z d hh c 15 M a g ee 2 Magee2Zdhhc15UprtAbcb7C77370Rnf12Slc16a2Zcchc13FtxXistTsixTsxChic1Cdx4 Nap1l2 same TAD different TADs same random domain 0 + 1 Correlation in transcriptional dynamics – 1 1 0 P p n x / L i n x TADs Correlation in transcriptional dynamics Gene pairs in : D F E * * Mouse ESC early differentiation 0 84 h 6 12 18 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 66 72 Transcriptome time series a b c – 1 Figure 4 | Transcriptional co - regulation within topologically associating domains . a , Female mouse ESCs were differentiated towards the epiblast stem cell lineage for84h .

Our data also point to a role for TADs in shaping regulatory landscapes , by defining theextentof sequences that belong to the same regulatory neighbourhood . We anticipate that TADs may underlie regulatory domains previously proposed on the basis of functional and synteny conservation studies 27 , 28 . We believe that the principles we have revealed here will not be restricted to the Xic , as spatial partitioning of chromosomal neighbourhoods occurs throughout the genome of mouse and human 29 , as well as Drosophila 30 and E . coli 31 . We have shown that TAD boundaries can have a critical role in high - order chromatin folding and proper long - range transcriptional control . Future work will clarify the mechanisms driving this level of chromosomal organization , and to what extent it generally contributes to transcriptional regulation . In summary , our study provides new insights into the cis - regulatory architecture of chromosomes that orchestrates transcriptional dynamics during development , and paves the way to dissecting the constellation of control elements of Xist and its regulators within the Xic .
