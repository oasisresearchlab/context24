Correspondence e - mail : sunando @ iiserb . ac . in Received 1 March 2014 Accepted 16 May 2014 Ras superfamily GTPases regulate signalling pathways that control multiple biological processes by modulating the GTP / GDP cycle . Various Rab GTPases , which are the key regulators of vesicular trafﬁcking pathways , play a vital role in the survival and virulence of the enteric parasite Entamoeba histolytica . The Rab GTPases act as binary molecular switches that utilize the conformational changes associated with the GTP / GDP cycle to elicit responses from target proteins and thereby regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes including cell proliferation , cytoskeletal assembly , nuclear transport and intracellular membrane trafﬁcking in eukaryotes . Entamoeba histolytica RabX3 ( Eh RabX3 ) is a unique GTPase in the amoebic genome , the only member in the eukaryotic Ras superfamily that harbours tandem G - domains and shares only 8 – 16 % sequence identity with other GTPases . Recent studies suggested that Eh RabX3 binds to a single guanine nucleotide through its N - terminal G - domain ( NTD ) , while the C - terminal G - domain ( CTD ) plays a potential role in binding of the nucleotide to the NTD . Thus , understanding the intermolecular regulation between the two GTPase domains is expected to reveal valuable information on the overall action of Eh RabX3 . To provide structural insights into the inclusive action of this unique GTPase , Eh RabX3 was crystallized by successive micro - seeding using the vapour - diffusion method . A complete data set was collected to 3 . 3 A˚ resolution using a single native Eh RabX3 crystal at 100 K on BM14 at the ESRF , Grenoble , France . The crystal belonged to monoclinic space group C 2 , with unit - cell parameters a = 198 . 6 , b = 119 . 3 , c = 89 . 2 A˚ , (cid:2) = 103 . 1 (cid:2) . Preliminary analysis of the data using the Matthews Probability Calculator suggested the presence of four to six molecules in the asymmetric unit . 1 . Introduction The GTP hydrolysis cycle provides a switch mechanism in controlling various cellular processes such as cell proliferation , cytoskeleton organization and intracellular trafﬁcking through Ras - like small GTPases . Members of the Ras superfamily of regulatory proteins , which includes the Ras , Rho , Rab , Arf and Ran subfamilies , are able to bind to and hydrolyze GTP , thereby providing their switching capability . They alternate between GTP - bound and GDP - bound conformations in the cell . The GTP - bound conformation is biologi - cally active and turns on cellular function through interaction with and activation of a speciﬁc effector ( s ) . GTP hydrolysis turns off the GTPase switch by converting it to the inactive GDP - bound confor - mation that has low afﬁnity for the effector ( s ) . The ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP is determined by primary - sequence motifs that have been highly conserved evolutionarily and whose importance has been conﬁrmed through mutational analysis ( Dhar et al . , 1982 ; Valencia et al . , 1991 ; Lowry & Williamsen , 1993 ) . For Ras proteins , the most extensively studied GTPases thus far , the identiﬁcation in tumours of activating mutations that impair GTPase activity revealed a few highly conserved amino acids that are critical for normal hydrolytic function ( Bos , 1989 ; McGrath et al . , 1984 ; Sweet et al . , 1984 ) . Conservation of these amino acids is not limited to the Ras family proteins but extends to the large variety of guanine nucleotide - binding proteins ( G proteins ) with diverse biological functions . Such observations have led to the identiﬁcation of a highly conserved catalytic site that is responsible for GTP hydrolysis . # 2014 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved crystallization communications 934 Kumar Srivastava et al . (cid:3) RabX3 Acta Cryst . ( 2014 ) . F 70 , 933 – 937 The enteric pathogenic parasite Entamoeba histolytica is one of the causative agents of health hazards in tropical countries . It causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscesses in humans . About 50 million cases of amoebiasis and 40 000 – 100 000 deaths are reported annually ( World Health Organization , 2012 ) . The frequency of occurrence of this disease is higher in developing countries where sanitation is poor . Adequate sanitation and good personal hygiene may avert this infection . Various Rab GTPases , which are the key regulators of vesicular trafﬁcking pathways , play a vital role in the survival and virulence of this enteric parasite . Over 100 Rab GTPases have been predicted to exist in the amoebic genome , three quarters of which are unique to the genus . This unique group has been designated as RabX . Some of the RabX proteins lack critical sequence motifs and hence their biochemical properties might deviate from those of their clas - sical homologues ( Kumagai et al . , 2004 ; Saito - Nakano et al . , 2001 , 2005 ) . Entamoeba histolytica RabX3 ( Eh RabX3 ; GenBank Acces - sion No . AB197075 ) is one such unique GTPase which was identiﬁed in an in silico screening for small GTPases in the amoebic genome . The presence of tandem GTPase domains in Eh RabX3 intrigued us and prompted us to investigate the GTP - binding and hydrolytic properties of this novel GTPase . The other proteins that possess double GTPase domains belong to EngA , a distinctive member of the Era subfamily of GTPases , and its homologue the Der family ( Robinson et al . , 2002 ) . These latter groups of proteins bind to two nucleotides , with one in each domain . Recent studies have shown that , unlike its prokaryotic counterpart which binds to GTP with 1 : 2 stoichiometry ( Lamb et al . , 2007 ) , Eh RabX3 binds to only one guanine nucleotide molecule through its NTD ( N - terminal G - domain ) . The CTD ( C - terminal G - domain ) plays an indispensable role in the binding of the nucleotide to the NTD , indicating a disparate protein – nucleotide interaction . In addition , it has been reported that this unique GTPase has extremely low intrinsic GTPase activity and that it could be enhanced by up to 20 - fold upon the introduction of site - speciﬁc mutations ( Chandra et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we report the crystallization and preliminary X - ray diffraction analysis of full - length wild - type Eh RabX3 ( 349 amino acids ) . Struc - tural insights into Eh RabX3 will provide valuable information to aid understanding of the intermolecular regulation between its two GTPase domains as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying the low catalytic activity of Eh RabX3 . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cloning , expression and purification of full - length Eh RabX3 Full - length Eh RabX3 was ampliﬁed from cDNA , extracted from the reference strain E . histolytica HM1 : IMSS cl6 . A single fragment of 1050 base pairs was ampliﬁed from the PCR reaction using Figure 1 Cloning , expression and puriﬁcation of full - length Eh RabX3 . ( a ) PCR ampliﬁcation of full - length Eh RabX3 cDNA . Speciﬁc oligonucleotides designed for the ampliﬁcation of full - length Eh RabX3 cDNAwere used to amplify the 1050 bp single band as indicated by the arrowhead . ( b ) Afﬁnity puriﬁcation proﬁle of 6 (cid:4) His - tagged Eh RabX3 . The whole cell lysate and eluted fractions ( 100 – 250 m M imidazole concentration ) from the afﬁnity column were analyzed using SDS – PAGE . ( c ) Size - exclusion chromatogram of Eh RabX3 . Fractions from afﬁnity - puriﬁed Eh RabX3 were pooled and subjected to a Superdex 75 prep - grade gel - ﬁltration column ( 16 / 60 ) . Eh RabX3 was eluted at a retention volume of 57 . 2 ml , which corresponds to a molecular mass of (cid:5) 40 kDa . ( d ) Fractions ( 24 – 32 ) corresponding to the chromatogram peak were analyzed using SDS – PAGE . Eh RabX3 - speciﬁc primers ( Fig . 1 a ) . To express recombinant full - length Eh RabX3 ( (cid:5) 40 kDa ) , the protein - coding region was subcloned into bacterial cloning vector pET - 28a ( Novagen ) within Bam HI and Xho I restriction sites and expressed as a 6 (cid:4) His fusion protein . The recombinant protein - production information is provided in Table 1 . The reconstructed vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) competent cells . The cells were grown in 2 l Luria broth medium supplemented with 30 m g ml (cid:6) 1 kanamycin at 310 K until the OD 600 reached 0 . 6 . Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl (cid:2) - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 m M . After overnight culture , the cells were harvested by centri - fugation ( 5000 g , 10 min ) at 277 K and the bacterial pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer consisting of 50 m M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 300 m M NaCl , 5 m M (cid:2) - mercaptoethanol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 10 m g ml (cid:6) 1 protease - inhibitor cocktail ( leupeptin hydrochloride , pepstatin A and aprotinin ; Sigma – Aldrich , India ) , 200 m M phenyl - methanesulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ; Sigma – Aldrich , India ) , 100 m M GDP ( Sigma – Aldrich , India ) . After sonication , cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30 000 g for 45 min at 277 K and the supernatant was loaded onto a column containing Ni – NTA metal - afﬁnity resin ( GE Healthcare ) . The column was thoroughly washed with lysis buffer containing 100 – 500 m M salt . Finally , the protein of interest was eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole ( 100 – 250 m M ) in 50 m M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 300 m M NaCl ( Fig . 1 b ) at 277 K . The pooled fractions were further puriﬁed using a Superdex 75 prep - grade ( 16 / 60 ) gel - ﬁltration column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 50 m M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 m M NaCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 5 m M dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 7 % glycerol ( Figs . 1 c and 1 d ) at 277 K . The yield of pure protein was 5 mg per litre of E . coli culture . The puriﬁed protein was concentrated to 10 mg ml (cid:6) 1 using a Centricon Ultra - 10 kDa centrifugal ﬁlter ( Milli - pore , USA ) for crystallization . The concentration of protein was determined by the Bradford assay ( Bradford , 1976 ) after each puri - ﬁcation step . 2 . 2 . Crystallization Crystallization experiments were carried out using the hanging - drop vapour - diffusion method at 293 K . Initial crystallization screening was performed using commercial screens ( Crystal Screen , Crystal Screen 2 and Index from Hampton Research , and Structure Screen 1 , Structure Screen 2 and ProPlex Screen from Molecular Dimensions ) . 2 m l protein solution was mixed with 1 m l reservoir solution and equilibrated against 500 m l reservoir solution . The initial crystallization conditions were set up using different protein crystallization communications Acta Cryst . ( 2014 ) . F 70 , 933 – 937 Kumar Srivastava et al .

After 21 d , bundles of micro - crystals were observed in a drop equilibrated against 1 . 4 M sodium malonate pH 7 . 0 ( ProPlex Screen 2 , Molecular Dimensions ; Fig . 2 a ) . Micro - crystals from this droplet were crushed and used to micro - seed further screening experiments using varying concentrations of sodium malonate ( 0 . 2 – 2 . 0 M ) within the pH range 6 . 0 – 7 . 5 . Optimization around these conditions and micro - seeding with the improved crys - tals led to the production of optimized single crystals ( Figs . 2 b and 2 c ) . Crystallization details are given in Table 2 . 2 . 3 . X - ray diffraction data collection and processing Optimized crystals were brieﬂy soaked in cryoprotectant comprising 2 M sodium malonate pH 6 . 0 , scooped up in a CryoLoop ( Hampton Research ) and then ﬂash - cooled in a stream of cold N 2 ( 100 K ) . Initially , data were collected at the home source to 6 A˚ resolution using a MAR345 detector mounted on a Bruker RU300 Cu K (cid:3) rotating - anode X - ray generator . Subsequently , high - resolu - tion diffraction data to 3 . 3 A˚ resolution were collected from a single crystal with dimensions of around 150 m m on the BM14 synchrotron X - ray beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility , Grenoble , France , using a MAR225 CCD detector . The intensity data were indexed , integrated and scaled using DENZO and SCALE - PACK in the HKL - 2000 suite ( Otwinowski & Minor , 1997 ) . The crystal parameters , data - collection parameters and processing statis - tics are summarized in Table 3 . 3 . Results and discussion In the initial crystallization screening , 400 commercial screening conditions were tested . Precipitate formation and crystal growth were observed in a few of these conditions over three weeks , and these conditions were further optimized to obtain microcrystals .

Figure 4 Self - rotation function calculated using GLRF ( Tong & Rossmann , 1990 ) using the resolution range of 10 – 3 . 5 A˚with radius of integration 25 A˚ . Shown here is the self - rotation function at (cid:5) = 180 (cid:2) . The plot shows two peaks 90 (cid:2) apart , both normal to c * , suggesting 222 point - group symmetry with one twofold noncrystallographic symmetry axis parallel to the space - group symmetry axis . concentration of 6 . 5 mg ml (cid:6) 1 ( 5 m l protein solution : 1 m l reservoir ) using 500 m l reservoir solution ( 0 . 7 M sodium malonate pH 6 . 0 ) , which yielded diffraction - quality crystals within 7 – 10 d . A complete native data set was collected and processed to 3 . 3 A˚ resolution ( Fig . 3 ) using a single native Eh RabX3 crystal on BM14 . The crystal belonged to space group C 2 , with unit - cell parameters a = 198 . 6 , b = 119 . 3 , c = 89 . 2 A˚ , (cid:2) = 103 . 1 (cid:2) . Preliminary analysis of the calculated Matthews coefﬁcient ( Matthews , 1968 ) suggested the presence of six molecules in the asymmetric unit ( V M = 2 . 24 A˚ 3 Da (cid:6) 1 , corresponding to a solvent content of 45 % ) ; however , the existence of four ( V M 3 . 36 A˚ 3 Da (cid:6) 1 , corresponding to a solvent content of 63 % ) or ﬁve ( V M 2 . 69 A˚ 3 Da (cid:6) 1 , corresponding to a solvent content of 54 % ) molecules in the asymmetric unit , cannot be ruled out . To ﬁnd noncrystallographic symmetry within the asymmetric unit we used GLRF ( Tong & Rossmann , 1990 ) to calculate the self - rotation function . The rotation function was calculated at (cid:5) = 60 , 90 , 120 and 180 (cid:2) . Signiﬁcant peaks were observed only at (cid:5) = 180 (cid:2) . The plot clearly indicates two peaks that are 90 (cid:2) apart and both normal to c * ( Fig . 4 ) , which suggests the presence of an oligomer in the asym - metric unit with 222 point - group symmetry , assuming the presence of a twofold noncrystallographic symmetry axis parallel to the space - group symmetry axis . Four molecules per asymmetric unit are also consistent with the relatively high solvent content , resulting in limited diffraction by the Eh RabX3 crystals . Structure determination via the molecular - replacement method employing the CCP 4 suite ( Phaser and MOLREP ) ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) using human Rab4a ( 186 amino acids ; PDB entry 2bmd ; Huber & Scheidig , 2005 ) as search model did not provide an unambiguous solution , probably due to the low sequence identity ( 16 % ) between these two proteins ( Fig . 5 ) . Currently , a selenomethionine derivative of Eh RabX3 is being prepared for experimental phasing . The determination of the three - dimensional structure of Eh RabX3 will be useful to aid under - standing of the molecular basis of intermolecular interaction between the two GTPase domains in this novel protein . The structure would also potentially improve the understanding of nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis by Eh RabX3 and its implications in vesicular trafﬁcking in E . histolytica .
