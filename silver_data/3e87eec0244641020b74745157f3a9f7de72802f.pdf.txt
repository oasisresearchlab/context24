Drawing upon quantitative data for a panel of 89 research - intensive US universities and interview data from two academic licensing ofﬁces , we model the relationship between technology transfer experience , embeddedness in biotechnology industry networks , basic science quality and capacity , and citation impact measures of university life science patents . Technology licensing ofﬁcers draw upon the expertise of corporate partners to evaluate the potential impact of invention disclosures . The information gleaned through network ties to industry enables well - connected institutions to develop higher impact patent portfolios . Reaping the beneﬁts of such connections , however , requires experience in balancing academic and corporate priorities to avoid the danger of ‘capture’ by industrial interests as overly tight connections limit patent impact . This pattern of diminishing returns to connectivity is robust across multiple citation measures of patent quality . © 2003 Elsevier Science B . V . All rights reserved .

Introduction The explosion of academic patenting in the last two decades has spawned an accompanying upsurge in scholarly analysis . Investigations of university in - tellectual property ( IP ) have ranged from textual ex - egesis of matched scientiﬁc publications and patents ( Myers , 1995 ) to sophisticated econometric analyses of the total factor productivity of university licensing endeavors ( Thursby and Thursby , 2002 ) . In between these disciplinary poles lie a number of studies that ∗ Corresponding author . E - mail addresses : jdos @ umich . edu ( J . Owen - Smith ) , woodyp @ stanford . edu ( W . W . Powell ) . examine the increase in university patenting , while considering the relationship between increasing patent volume and the impact of new innovations . Several general trends are apparent in this ﬁeld of research . Investigators interested in the causes and consequences of increased academic commercializa - tion have focused on the evolution of an institutional regime that merges academic and commercial re - ward systems ( Owen - Smith , 2003 ; Owen - Smith and Powell , 2001a ) . Others have emphasized the role of early patenting success in explaining later intellectual property development , suggesting that federal policy changes did not initiate the trend of increasing aca - demic interest in IP ( Mowery et al . , 2001 ) . Both lines of work suggest that growing commercial engagement 0048 - 7333 / $ – see front matter © 2003 Elsevier Science B . V .

Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 has not , thus far , altered the research culture of uni - versities so as to privilege applied orientations at the expense of basic science . 1 A complementary line of inquiry has examined the relationship between the quality and volume of univer - sity patent outputs . Drawing on a patent and citation database developed and maintained at the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) ( Hall et al . , 2001a ) , economists have generated citation - based measures of patent importance and generality that have proven useful for comparisons of academic and non - academic patents . A key component of every issued patent is the list of prior art upon which the protected innovation depends . The number of cita - tions received by a given patent indicates its impact on later technology and can thus serve as a proxy for its market value ( Hall et al . , 2001b ; Trajtenberg , 1990 ) . Drawing on this data , two research groups have investigated the relationship between the quality and impact of university patents . Henderson et al . ( 1998 ) compare university - assigned patents to a 1 % random sample of all US utility patents , ﬁnding that the average impact of university patents declined over time with increasing patent vol - ume , and that the impact gap between academic and non - academic patents was smallest for biomedical technologies . This result has two possible implica - tions ; one based on inexperience , the other on a shift in goals . We consider each in turn . In the wake of the 1980 Bayh – Dole act , an in - creasing number of universities rushed to patent . In their efforts to commercialize the stock of uni - versity knowledge , these inexperienced institutions may have ﬁled for IP protection indiscriminately . These efforts would have increased the volume of university - assigned patents while limiting their aver - age impact . Alternatively , increased academic concern with commercial science may have changed the mix of research at universities , heightening the salience of efforts to develop applications and diverting focus from early stage basic research . To the extent that 1 There may , however , be important and unanticipated second - order effects of increasing university research commercialization , such as new career trajectories , rivalries based on industrial afﬁl - iations , inequalities across research units , and more inﬂuence ex - erted by commercial ﬁrms on university research agendas ( Powell and Owen - Smith , 1998 ; McCray and Croissant , 2001 ; McSherry , 2001 ; Nelson , 2001 ; Owen - Smith and Powell , 2001b ) . early university patents were highly cited because they broke new ground outside the established paths of commercial innovation , shifting research priorities on campus would result in lower impact patents . Mowery et al . ( 2001 ) ﬁnd that for a sample of three institutions ( Columbia , Stanford , and Berkeley ) , academic patenting has not changed the orientations of university scientists . Subsequently , Mowery and Zeidonis ( 2003 ) examined patents issued to both experienced and inexperienced universities and con - cluded that aggregate declines in university patent impact are largely the result of entry rather than of transformations in mission , providing support for one of Henderson et al . explanations for declining uni - versity patent impact . Drawing on a later time series , Mowery et al . ( 2002 ) ﬁnd that the citation impact of patents assigned to inexperienced ( entrant ) universi - ties increases in the early 1990s , suggesting that new patentors learn over time to identify and prosecute more valuable intellectual property . Previous researchers have not , however , been able to specify the mechanisms by which universities learn to commercialize research and develop the capacity to patent effectively . Possible explanations include cu - mulative patenting know - how , dedicated administra - tive staff for technology transfer , and early contractual ties to a patent management ﬁrm ( Research Corpo - ration Technologies ) ; however , none of these factors account for the changing rates of citation to patents is - sued to entrants ( Mowery et al . , 2002 ) . Mowery et al . ( 2002 , p . 88 ) ﬁnd clear indications of learning by en - trant universities , but conclude with a call for further research , speculating that “ . . . a more diffuse learning process may underpin our lack our results . ” We enter this discussion with university level data that sheds more direct light on the questions pur - sued by Henderson , Mowery and colleagues . We fo - cus speciﬁcally on life science patenting by “research one” 2 universities in order to integrate NBER patent citation indicators ( Hall et al . , 2001a ) with information on the volume and citation impact of basic and clinical life science publications . We add data that reﬂect the 2 “Research one” is a designation of research intensity that was previously applied to universities by the Carnegie Foundation . In order to qualify as a research one institution , a campus had to receive at least US $ 40 million per year in federal R & D funding , while granting at least 50 doctorates . J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 1697 differential positions of universities in contractual net - works involving science - based biotechnology ﬁrms . These campus - level measures illuminate several pos - sible mechanisms by which universities might learn to patent , while providing direct insight into the re - lationship between academic and commercial science on research - intensive university campuses . Our focus is on university capabilities ; we do not tackle the larger issue of whether university patenting facilitates or hin - ders scientiﬁc and technological progress . We supplement our quantitative analyses with ex - cerpts from interviews with technology licensing ofﬁ - cers , research administrators , and life science faculty on two university campuses . 3 Taken in conjunction with our inferential ﬁndings , these narrative data en - able us to propose organizational mechanisms that underlie changing university capacities to patent . We begin by discussing our data sources , empha - sizing the points of convergence and divergence with the existing literature while developing some general propositions regarding the processes by which re - search universities learn to patent in the life sciences ﬁeld . We then turn to a more formal discussion of our methods and models , and a description of the ﬁeldwork that supports our use of interview data . Next we present ﬁndings for a set of regressions re - lating our organizational variables to counts of issued patents and citation - based measures of patent impact . Interpretation of those models will rely both on the propositions we develop and on insights derived from our interviews . 2 . Accounting for life science patenting at universities Commercial activity in the life sciences has led the recent explosion in patenting and licensing on US university campuses . At most universities , the bulk of both issued patents and revenues result from innova - tions in the biomedical ﬁeld ( Henderson et al . , 1998 ; Mowery et al . , 2001 ; Powell and Owen - Smith , 1998 , 2002 ) . By 1998 , nearly half ( 49 . 5 % ) of all patents is - sued to research - intensive US universities were based 3 Our cases include a private university with an established and successful technology transfer infrastructure and a public university whose licensing ofﬁce is younger and struggling . on life science innovations . The increase in biomedical patenting on campus , however , may be part of a larger phenomenon . The commercialization of academic life science research is deeply intertwined with the emer - gence of a new industry , biotechnology , which had its origins in university labs . As the industry evolved , its ties to the academy deepened with ‘star’ scien - tists playing central roles in new biotechnology ﬁrms ( Zucker et al . , 1997 ) and in the transfer of new knowl - edge from universities to ﬁrms ( Zucker et al . , 2002 ) . Academic technologies are central to the R & D efforts of these small science - based ﬁrms , and uni - versities are central players in the inter - organizational networks that constitute the industry’s ‘locus of innovation’ ( Powell et al . , 1996 ; Owen - Smith et al . , 2002 ) . Understood in this light , the ﬁnding that there is little difference in importance or generality across academic and industrial life science patents ( Henderson et al . , 1998 ; Mowery et al . , 2002 ) reﬂects the development of a common technological com - munity comprised of multiple types of organizations engaged in ongoing collaborations ( Powell , 1996 ) . The importance for ﬁrms of linkages to universi - ties has been well documented ( cf . Owen - Smith and Powell , 2003 ) , but few investigators have considered the reciprocal effects for universities of ties to ﬁrms . We contend that universities learn to patent and , in particular , to identify and prosecute high - impact patents through their connections to commercial part - ners . Thus , in combination with internal scientiﬁc and technology transfer capacities , university posi - tions in contractual networks with companies should explain the citation impact of academic life science patents . We focus our attention on the 6196 life science - based US utility patents issued to research one uni - versities from 1988 to 1998 . All patents assigned to R1 universities from 1976 to 1998 ( N = 19 , 815 ) were identiﬁed through the United States Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce ( USPTO ) database . These data were matched to the National Bureau of Economic Research patent citations data ﬁle , allowing extraction of all university - assigned patents in the technological cate - gory ‘Drugs and Medicine . ’ The citation - based impact measures associated with these patents provide the de - pendent variables for our analyses . Our independent variables are drawn from a num - ber of sources . University level measures are taken 1698 J . Owen - Smith , W . W .

For ease of discussion , we group individual vari - ables under the more general concepts we take them to indicate . 6 2 . 1 . Dependent variables We ﬁrst describe our dependent variables , which are aggregated to the level of the university . Our concern here is with ﬂows of citations at the level of the insti - tution . Rather than modeling the impact of each patent individually , we choose to analyze the characteristics of yearly patent portfolios . In effect , we examine the conditions under which universities generate streams of patented innovations and the factors that might ac - count for the eventual impact of those patents . Our ﬁrst citation measure is a simple ( forward ) count of citations received by university life science patents . We sum the citations to patents assigned to a university in a given year to provide an aggregate mea - sure of portfolio impact at the organizational level . A second measure , ‘blockbuster , ’ captures the presence or absence in a given year of an extremely high - impact patent . Such a patent is cited 3 standard deviations above the mean for all patents issued in the same technology category in the same year . 7 Less than 2 % ( 112 ) of the patents in our sample meet this criterion . Using these two variables we can examine the aggre - gate impact of innovative ﬂows to universities , and the organizational and network conditions that con - tribute to the development of blockbuster intellectual properties . 2 . 2 . Independent variables Our key independent variables include a set of time - invariant controls that indicate the presence or ab - sence of a medical school , whether or not a university is located in one of the United States’ six major ‘biotechnology clusters’ ( Owen - Smith et al . , 2002 ) , and whether the institution is publicly or privately governed . We expect these three variables to offer broad purchase on variations in the volume and im - pact of academic patent ﬂows . 6 Correlations among these variables are reported in Table A1 . 7 This variant on the ‘ﬁxed effects’ approach to citation rescaling suggested by Hall et al . ( 2001a , b ) , enables us to model a longer time series than is possible with raw citation counts . The presence of an academic medical center on campus reﬂects a possible increase in scientiﬁc capac - ity over universities without medical schools . Clinical and translational research , which is closer to commer - cial application than more upstream basic research , might result in a greater number of patents . More broadly , we have suggested that the integration of the lab and the clinic is a possible source of the domi - nance of the US public research system in worldwide biomedical innovation ( Owen - Smith et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , a productive academic medical center may offer greater opportunities for the development of commer - cially valuable technology , while expanding academic involvement with ﬁrms and increasing the resources available for biomedical research on campus . Similarly , location in an active biotechnology re - gion may confer advantages to universities in terms of the development of intellectual property . Partic - ularly in an industry where ﬁrms and universities are more closely equivalent in terms of the type and impact of the patents they develop , the knowledge spillovers generated in a high - tech cluster ( Jaffe , 1986 ; Romer , 1986 ) , along with extensive informal contacts between university scientists and researchers in local ﬁrms ( Audretsch and Stephan , 1996 ; Zucker et al . , 1997 ) , may beneﬁt universities as they seek to develop higher impact patent portfolios . Despite their expected effects , time - invariant dummy variables are a blunt instrument . Hence , we include more detailed time - varying indicators of technology transfer and scientiﬁc capacity , scientiﬁc impact , and network position for these universities . To illustrate , we describe our simple measure of university experience with technology transfer : the time in years since a campus ﬁrst committed a 0 . 5 full - time staff equivalent to technology transfer ac - tivities . Several recent studies have emphasized the role of the technology licensing ofﬁce as both a locus for organizational learning about technology transfer ( Feldman et al . , 2002 ; Owen - Smith , 2003 ) , and an important factor in licensing success ( Siegel et al . , 2000 ; Kaghan , 2001 ) . We use age as a proxy for experience to reﬂect the possibility that some factors other than direct experience with patent prosecution may be a source of university learning . Similarly , we draw upon a yearly count of successful patent appli - cations to capture the direct effect of experience with patent evaluation and prosecution . 1700 J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 2 . 3 . Scientiﬁc capacity and impact We compiled publication - based measures of the volume and impact of basic and clinical life science re - search on these campuses from the Institute for Scien - tiﬁc Information’s University Indicators database . In particular , we include log - transformed counts of arti - cles published in basic life science and clinical medical journals to indicate the volume of life science research on a university campus . We use a publication - based measure of scientiﬁc capacity , rather than one based on expenditures , because publication counts reﬂect the actual amount of research completed on a univer - sity campus . Invention disclosures made by academic inventors to university technology transfer ofﬁces of - ten take the form of article manuscripts . Research has shown that both organizations and individuals involved with life science commercialization tend to publish more than those that lack such afﬁliations ( Blumenthal et al . , 1996 ; Powell and Owen - Smith , 1998 ) . 8 Thus , we expect a positive relationship between publica - tion volume and patent volume . By the same token , the separation of clinical and basic publications may provide greater insight into the means by which the presence of academic medical centers inﬂuences patenting . As we have noted , the relationship between quality and impact for patents is a tricky one . The difﬁculties are magniﬁed when we consider possible relation - ships between the quality and quantity of scientiﬁc outputs in different institutional systems . Dasgupta and David ( 1987 , 1994 ) remind us that public and pri - vate science represent different institutional regimes for the creation , dissemination , and use of scientiﬁc ﬁndings , which are governed by different rhetorical rules ( Myers , 1995 ) and norms ( Merton , 1988 ; Packer and Webster , 1996 ) . Nevertheless , citation measures for both publications and patents are often taken to reﬂect the ‘fertility’ or importance of new ﬁndings . We turn to standardized measures of citation impact for clinical and basic life science publications to ex - amine the relationship between highly cited articles and the impact of academic patents . 8 Interestingly , this relationship may not hold for physical sci - entists and engineers whose approaches to patenting differ sig - niﬁcantly from life scientists ( Owen - Smith and Powell , 2001a ; Agrawal and Henderson , 2002 ) . The relationship between important articles and patents has not been fully explained . Owen - Smith ( 2003 ) ﬁnds that by the mid 1990s , high - volume patenting by universities is positively related to the citation impact of academic publications . In turn , high - impact science leads to larger volume patenting . Nevertheless , few studies have related publication and patent impact in a speciﬁc ﬁeld . 9 Especially in the life sciences , where new ﬁndings ( for instance , the discovery that a speciﬁc gene is associated with a particular heritable disease ) can simultaneously yield career - making scientiﬁc publications and valuable intellectual properties , 10 both scientists and tech - nology licensing ofﬁcers often presume that higher impact , more ‘fertile’ science yields patents that will be more widely used . Nevertheless , very different processes govern citation strategies in manuscripts and patent applications , with the former governed by reputation - driven peer review processes and the latter by legal strategies and patent examiner’s prior art searchers . These differences may mitigate a direct re - lationship between citation measures in the academic and commercial realms . 2 . 4 . Network measures We include a number of measures of the extent of university embeddedness in contractual networks involving science - based human therapeutic and di - agnostic biotechnology ﬁrms ( DBFs ) . Developed by coding alliances in such industry publications as Bioscan and others for the period 1988 – 1998 , these network measures capture formal contractual rela - tionships of a number of types , including R & D agree - ments , technology licensing , ﬁnancial investments , and commercialization efforts such as clinical trials and marketing . Universities play a central role in these networks at the regional , national , and interna - 9 See Agrawal and Henderson ( 2002 ) who found that high impact patents are positively related with higher volume publication for individual engineers at MIT , and Sine et al . ( 2001 ) who found a positive relationship between a university’s scientiﬁc reputation ( measured by National Research Council rankings ) and licensing returns to intellectual property . 10 Consider , for instance , the recent rapid promotion of James Thomson from assistant to full professor at the University of Wisconsin on the strength of his work with human embryonic stem cells ( Associated Press , 2 December 2002 ) . J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 1701 tional level , while also serving as a source of trained personnel , new technologies , and scientiﬁc expertise . Little effort , however , has been expended to estab - lish the relationship between such university – industry interfaces and the characteristics of academic patent portfolios . The four variables grouped under the ‘network’ heading in Table 1 reﬂect varying levels of university engagement in contractual linkages to dedicated hu - man therapeutic and diagnostic biotechnology ﬁrms . These variables include : ( 1 ) ‘isolate , ’ a dummy vari - able indicating universities with no connections to DBFs in a given year ; ( 2 ) ‘main component , ’ an indi - cator of modest network connection ( at least one tie to the largest weakly connected network component in a given year ) ; 11 and ( 3 ) ‘degree’ a simple measure of centrality which , in the unstandardized form we em - ploy here , is a count of each institution’s contractual ties to DBFs in a given year . 12 We draw on these measures to shed light on another possible mechanism by which universities might learn to develop more and higher impact life science patents . Mowery et al . ( 2002 ) ﬁnd no effect of early ties to a key patent management ﬁrm ( Research Corporation Technologies ) , the commitment of staff resources to technology transfer , or cumulative patenting experi - ence on the citation impact of university patents . We contend that universities may learn the intricacies of patent prosecution and how to identify and pursue high - impact IP through connections with their com - mercial partners . Particularly in life science ﬁelds , where the science gap between universities and ﬁrms is the narrowest and informal ties between academic and commercial organizations are an important con - dition for ﬁrm success , contractual relations between ﬁrms and universities may represent ‘pipes’ through 11 The main component of a network is the largest group of or - ganizations that are , in graph theoretic terms , reachable through indirect paths of ﬁnite length . Thus , a connection to the main component of a network represents the minimum level of connec - tion necessary to enable an organization to search for information through the largest portion of the network . 12 We employ degree centrality rather than some of the more complex measures developed by social network theorists to avoid potential biases introduced by a network dataset that focuses pri - marily on the activities of biotechnology ﬁrms . These data provide no information on ties between R1 universities and organizations other than DBFs , for instance large pharmaceutical ﬁrms , which renders more ‘structural’ centrality measures problematic . which both information and organizational competen - cies might ﬂow ( Burt , 1992 ; Podolny , 2001 ) . 13 Our intuition about the importance of such connections is based on numerous conversations with technology transfer staff . Consider the following comment from a senior licensing associate specializing in life science innovations at a private university : We know it is hard to get information from com - panies because they don’t want to tip their hand . You deﬁnitely value the feedback you can get from your commercial partners , it makes your decision making so much easier . That information gives you something to really substantiate why you are spend - ing money on a patent . Several informants in technology licensing ofﬁces emphasized that the process of technology market - ing often occurs prior to a decision to ﬁle for patent protection . ‘Shopping’ a technology to particular li - censees amounts to a search for information about the potential impact of a new invention . As the com - ments above suggest , however , valuable insights are not always forthcoming from corporations and may sometimes require signiﬁcant parsing by the licens - ing ofﬁcer . Under these conditions , established ties to commercial partners may increase both the volume and reliability of the corporate evaluations on which technology licensing ofﬁcers often base decisions to patent . Seen in this fashion , technology ofﬁcers de - velop skills at translation in which they learn to bal - ance the zeal of enthusiastic university inventors with the more sober and strategic assessments of commer - cial ﬁrms , who do not wish to overpay for access to IP . 13 This diffusion - oriented view of the sources of organizational learning may be even more important as university technology licensing ofﬁces converge toward the ‘marketing model’ ( Neuer , 1995 ; Sampat and Nelson , 2000 ) , pioneered by Neils Reimers at Stanford . Under this organizational model , the primary responsi - bility of a technology licensing ofﬁcer is the marketing of tech - nologies and the management of multiple ongoing relationships with ﬁrms and inventors . With the marketing model , the role of in - tellectual property attorneys is minimized or eliminated and patent prosecution duties are often ‘outsourced’ to external law ﬁrms . As the marketing model becomes more common , we anticipate a lesser effect of prior experience with patenting on later patent impact . We expect ofﬁces oriented toward technology marketing to learn to manage IP more through ties to ﬁrms than from cu - mulative experience . 1702 J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 3 . Models and methods We model two dependent variables to examine the complex relationship between patent volume and impact on university campuses . Focusing ﬁrst on explanations for the impact of patent ﬂows to R1 uni - versities , we examine counts of citations to academic life science patents in an 8 - year ( 1988 – 1995 ) pooled cross - section using a negative binomial speciﬁcation ( Hausman et al . , 1984 ; Cameron and Trivendi , 1998 ) to correct for over - dispersion . In the interest of main - taining statistical power and because patents do not tend to receive the bulk of their citations for 4 – 5 years ( Lanjouw and Schankerman , 1999 ) , we consider ci - tation counts by patent application date ( Hall et al . , 2000 ) . This strategy allows us to maintain a longer time series , while avoiding inclusion of patents that are too ‘young’ to have yet received the bulk of their citations . We employ ﬁxed university and year ef - fects to control for unobserved heterogeneity across time and campuses , modeling the dependent variable ( y i , t ) as y i , t = α i + δ t + J (cid:1) j β j ( x i , t , j ) + ε i , t Where α i is the effect of university i ( i = 1 , . . . , N ) , δ t is the effect of year t ( t = 1 , . . . , 8 ) , and β j is the within university slope for x j pooled over all universities and years . Finally we turn to a dependent variable , ‘blockbuster , ’ that captures the presence or absence of a high - impact patent in a university’s yearly portfolio . Recall that we deﬁne a patent as a blockbuster if it is cited 3 or more standard deviations above the mean for patents issued in the same year and technology category . As our deﬁnition of a blockbuster patent represents a variant of the ‘ﬁxed effects’ approach to rescaling citation measures suggested by Hall et al . ( 2001a , b ) and given the relative sparseness of ‘blockbuster cases , ’ we opt to model the full 12 - year time series ( 1988 – 1998 ) , acknowledging that in the later years ( approximately 1996 – 1998 ) the blockbuster designation may capture patents that were ‘merely’ cited more quickly than their cohorts . Because the dependent variable is dichotomous , we use a conditional logistic regression speciﬁcation to enable the inclusion of ﬁxed university effects ( Allison , 2002 ) . 14 In essence , this special case of the standard logit model eliminates the cases ( 42 ) where there is no change in the dependent variables across time periods ( e . g . where a university is never assigned a blockbuster patent or receives one in every year ) , thus providing a ﬁxed effects model of the year to year likelihood of a university receiving a high - impact patent , conditional on the institution’s ever having received such a patent . An unavoidable side effect of this model speciﬁcation is its inability to include time - invariant independent variables . Hence , we in - clude multiplicative interactions between year and the dummy variables capturing the presence or absence of a medical school , location in a high - tech region , and private governance , to analyze their changing effect over time . 4 . Findings 4 . 1 . Portfolio impact Table 2 presents results from a series of regres - sions on the overall citation impact of yearly academic patent ﬂows in the life sciences . We begin with the most effective regression , model 5 , which ﬁnds a pos - itive and signiﬁcant effect of portfolio size on num - ber of citations . This ﬁnding provides further support for Mowery et al . ( 2002 ) conclusion that the impact of university portfolios , at least in years well after Bayh – Dole , does not decline with increased patent - ing . Note the positive and signiﬁcant effect of net - work degree upon this measure of university patent impact . This variable provides some insight into the mechanisms by which universities might learn to ob - tain high - impact patents . We think spillovers and access to evaluations pro - vided by commercial contacts are key elements in successful technology transfer . Centrality in a sys - tem of contractual network ‘pipes’ provides sources of information that enable universities to more ef - fectively evaluate invention disclosures . Of course , there are limits to connectivity ; too much reliance on a handful of local partners might create cognitive 14 Because our deﬁnition of a blockbuster patent implicitly con - trols for unobserved year - to - year differences in citation rates , we do not include ﬁxed year effects in this model .

Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 ‘lock - in’ or limit licensing staff’s ability to appropri - ately weight those evaluations that are strongly colored by corporate priorities . Accordingly , note the negative quadratic term for network degree , implying decreas - ing returns to centrality for universities . As with other types of learning ( note the pattern of signiﬁcance for our TTage and TTage 2 variables ) , there appear to be diminishing returns to network embeddedness . 15 The implication is that universities learn to patent through ‘diffuse’ channels in addition to simple ex - perience . Seen in this respect , connections to a range of science - based ﬁrms provide academic institutions with the relevant tools to evaluate invention disclo - sures through the eyes of potential partners . Access to such information may allow universities to more ef - fectively evaluate the possible impact of new faculty innovations . The negative quadratic effect , however , indicates that it may be possible to be too connected to a few industrial interests . This ﬂipside of the network effect may represent a form of ‘capture’ of university research endeavors by corporate partners . A university that relies too heavily on input from a small sample of corporate partners or on a narrowly commercial stan - dard of judgment will see a decline in the impact of its patent portfolio . To the extent that this variety of network capture generates change in the research pri - orities of universities , our ﬁnding ﬁts with the results offered by Henderson et al . ( 1998 ) . The apparent challenge for universities is to mine network position for information without becoming overconnected . In this case , successfully navigating network connections means avoiding capture and com - petency traps , while overcoming isolation in the ivory tower . Similar returns to an intermediate level of em - beddedness have been found to be propitious in re - search on industries as disparate as women’s fashion 15 While these models do not explicitly incorporate time lags , we recognize that learning may be attenuated . Hence we conducted several validity tests . We divided our sample of universities into isolate ( no ties ) , moderately embedded ( at or below the mean number of ties ) and highly embedded ( greater than the mean number of ties ) groups at two time periods ( 1988 , 1990 ) and compared 5 - year citation rates from issue date ( Lanjouw and Schankerman , 1999 ) for patents whose applications were ﬁled in the following years . In both instances , the descriptive data were consistent with the ﬁndings reported above . Isolate patents were cited less often than both moderately and highly embedded patents , but the most highly embedded universities subsequently applied for patents that had less impact . ( Uzzi , 1996 , 1997 ) and banking ( Uzzi , 1999 ; Mizruchi and Stearns , 2001 ) . Beyond the network effects , we see a steady rela - tionship between high - volume publication in both ba - sic and clinical life science and the number of patent citations . Increased research productivity in terms of published life science articles creates a larger and more diverse ‘pool’ of ﬁndings that might potentially be patented . 16 Consider the comments of a senior li - censing associate who emphasizes the extent to which learning is a function of the volume of evaluations performed . There is no curriculum for training someone . We try to send people to the AUTM seminars but they are really going to learn more by being here on the job , by going out and meeting with inventors and by sitting in on negotiations . This business is very much learn as you go and the more deals you are involved with , the more quickly you learn . In addition to increasing the volume of potential deals , high - volume publication may reﬂect greater scientiﬁc diversity on campus , yielding more broad ranging invention disclosures . Assessing diverse in - novations on a regular basis may mitigate against ‘competency traps’ ( Levitt and March , 1988 ) , which are a common source of diminishing returns to orga - nizational learning . The importance of academic patent portfolios is at least partially a function of the amount of basic science research that is conducted on campus . Net of publication impact measures , the effect of publication volume on patent portfolio impact suggests that suc - cessful IP development may depend jointly on having access to high - volume ﬂows of scientiﬁc ﬁndings and the network connections and experience that 16 In unreported sensitivity analyses , we included the yearly num - ber of new invention disclosures reported in the Association of University Technology Managers ( AUTM ) survey as an indepen - dent variable . These data are available for a reduced sample of universities across a shorter ( 1991 – 1995 ) time series . When run on this limited sample , however , our model ﬁve remained unchanged and , while it was positive and signiﬁcant , the inclusion of the dis - closure count variable did not qualitatively alter our results . These analyses suggest that disclosure rates have an independent effect on patent quality , perhaps by offering licensing associates greater opportunities to evaluate new technologies . That effect , however , does not alter the positive impact of a deeper pool ( e . g . more publications ) of potential innovations on a campus . J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 1705 enable their evaluation . These models also indicate that highly signiﬁcant academic publications are di - rectly related to high - impact patents . Nevertheless , the small magnitude of the signiﬁcant basic science impact variable suggests a relatively small substantive effect . Table 2 implies that having high - impact patent ﬂows is largely a function of basic knowledge ﬂows , access to information from commercial partners , and expe - rience . Multiple linkages appear to be more valuable than a tight reliance on a few commercial partners . High - impact basic science serves as an entry ticket to the patenting arena for universities ( Owen - Smith and Powell , 2003 ) , but exploiting the potential value of patents is more a function of having access to informa - tion that assists in evaluating the potential economic impact of faculty innovations than of having a small number of industrial partners who tell universities how to commercialize research . These ﬁndings are nicely summed up in the remarks of a technology transfer ofﬁcer who comments on the value of fast access to corporate assessments : We have very good pipelines into the biotech world , we know who is doing what in cancer , who is working in auto - immune , etc . and we go to these companies and get a quick response . There is nothing equivalent on the physical science side . The product life cycles are so short that little com - panies can’t spend time on building relationships with universities . In addition to highlighting the importance of net - works to academic patenting , these comments fur - ther emphasize the distinction between biomedical and engineering approaches to intellectual property and university – industry interactions . 4 . 2 . Accounting for blockbusters On some university campuses , licensing strategies are , out of necessity , oriented more towards garner - ing spectacular ‘home run’ successes than generating stable ﬂows of higher impact patents . This strategy may be particularly salient for late entrants who ﬁnd that a blockbuster is the fastest means to overcome the constraints that accompany limited budgets and underdeveloped network connections . As an illustration of this process , consider re - cent data on licensing from AUTM . Among the 20 universities that earned in excess of US $ 5 million in 1998 licensing income , 10 had 50 or more issued patents . These institutions have routinely appeared at the top of the AUTM revenue list . Their deep patent portfolios stand in sharp contrast to three new en - trant universities ( Florida State , Canegie Mellon , and Tulane ) with 15 or fewer patents . Each of these uni - versities ‘swung for the fences’ and landed a single highly lucrative blockbuster in an otherwise small IP portfolio . Technology transfer capacity develops through experience in evaluating a broad range of invention disclosures . Ample connections to ﬁrms , as well as translational research in medical schools , aid this process by increasing the amount and quality of feed - back universities receive from commercial partners . Technology transfer experience itself may represent not only increased competency in evaluation , but also expanded ﬂexibility in the choice to pursue IP . The director of a young technology transfer ofﬁce at a large public university sums up the challenges of be - ing a new entrant , whose limited budget constrains their ability to patent : Generally speaking , unless we have companies in - terested in a technology , we simply can’t afford to go forward . If that company doesn’t agree to reim - burse us for patenting costs , then that’s the decision right there . The limitations implied above suggest that new academic entrants to the commercial arena face a particularly difﬁcult double bind . Universities may depend on the interest of ﬁrms to justify pursu - ing IP , however , that very dependence may limit a university’s ability to capitalize on the few technolo - gies they succeed in protecting . Under these circum - stances , network connections to ﬁrms may be both necessary and dangerous for universities whose tech - nology transfer infrastructures are not economically self - sufﬁcient . Clearly , linkages to companies are important to evaluating the impact of academic life science patents . But the importance of ﬁrm input to assessments at well - off incumbent institutions and the necessity of corporate buy - in for any patent prosecu - tion at more cash - strapped entrant schools suggests that the relationship between embeddedness and the impact of academic IP portfolios may be contingent on experience . 1706 J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 Most university licensing revenues derive from a very small number of patents . On many campuses , a single patent has accounted for the lion’s share of roy - alty income ( Powell and Owen - Smith , 2002 ) . These inventions are often based in life science research and represent broadly licensed biological processes ( for instance , the Stanford / UCSF gene splicing patent and Columbia’s protein synthesis patent were extremely consequential for those campuses’ early technology transfer success ) , or on therapeutically valuable com - pounds or uses thereof ( such as Florida State’s more recent and highly lucrative Taxol patent ) ( Mowery et al . , 2001 ) . The challenge facing academic technology transfer is whether to “swing for the fences” for a blockbuster that could produce windfall revenues , which would seed broader commercialization efforts , or to bet on a wider range of inventions , generating a steady stream of small successes with the hope that a blockbuster might emerge from this wide portfolio ( Owen - Smith , 2000 ) . Adding to the challenge is the fact that iden - tifying such a blockbuster ex ante is very difﬁcult . Interviews and archival materials suggest that where blockbusters have been realized , few appreciated their potential at an early stage . Nevertheless , the pressure to develop such block - busters is particularly pressing on entrant campuses where technology transfer ofﬁces most often func - tion in the red . Consider the comments of the vice president for research at a large public institution whose licensing efforts have yet to generate signiﬁ - cant returns . His comments suggest both the necessity of scoring a blockbuster and the beneﬁts of such success . What you want is one really big winner , and then you can reinvest and build some other winners off that . Then you are out of the gate . Eventually , we are going to hit one . We’ve got a bunch of tech - nologies that I think have $ 1 billion a year projected markets . Everybody needs to get their ﬁrst hit . We just haven’t yet . We do have some nice stuff in the pipeline , though . This passage implies that landing an initial big hit is viewed as the pathway to viability on some entrant campuses . Technology licensing ofﬁcers at numerous universities have cautioned us , however , that evalu - ating the market potential of an early stage proof of concept technology is risky . 17 A senior licensing as - sociate at a commercially successful private university sums up these difﬁculties : In most cases you don’t even have a prototype , let alone an established market . So going out and say - ing ‘what’s the potential market for this technology , ’ doesn’t work for most of the technologies we deal with . We’re often hard put even to ﬁgure out what the product is going to be , let alone determine mar - ket size . Using that kind of criteria just doesn’t work . We turn to conditional logit models to discern which organizational features are associated with the presence or absence of an extremely highly cited ( > 3 standard deviations above the mean ) patent in a university’s portfolio . 18 As the comments above sug - gest , the search for a blockbuster patent requires the ability to evaluate uncertain and early stage technolo - gies . Table 3 presents ﬁndings from our conditional logit regressions . The results suggest that obtaining “home run” patents has little to do with the impact or volume of science conducted on campus . Instead , this form of success is largely a game of numbers , experience , and embeddedness . As with Table 2 , we ﬁnd a consistently signiﬁcant pattern relating high - volume patenting to a measure of patent impact . All other things being equal , universities that patent more are more likely to generate a very successful patent in any given year . We also note the strongly negative effect of the med - ical school × year interaction , 19 which suggests that the importance of having a medical school on campus has declined over time . 17 Jensen and Thursby ( 2001 ) ﬁnd that that such ‘proof’ patents are much more difﬁcult to license lucratively than are technologies which have reached the prototype stage . 18 Recall that a conditional logit model enables a ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation for universities at the expense of information about institutions that are never issued blockbuster patents . Thus , these coefﬁcients are best understood in terms of the factors that con - tribute to the yearly presence or absence of very high impact patents in the portfolios of institutions that received at least one such patent in any year in our data . 19 Conditional logit models prevent the use of time invariant coef - ﬁcients , but a common strategy is to include interactions between such variables and a year marker . Coefﬁcients for such interac - tions are best understood to indicate the changing effect of the variables over time . J . Owen - Smith , W . W .

The role of technology licensing ofﬁces and network embeddedness in this form of patenting accomplishment is apparent in Table 3 . The strong positive effect of formal technology transfer experi - ence , combined with positive but declining returns to network degree , again suggests the importance of access to information that enables evaluation of invention disclosures , and the capacity to take ad - vantage of such information . The negative quadratic term for degree further implies the possibility that university patenting efforts may be harmed by a very high volume of ﬁrm connections . Particularly for the sort of ‘big hit’ patents we model here , the ability of a technology transfer ofﬁcer to identify ﬁndings that may be very useful to industry , while remaining outside established commercial R & D trajectories is important . Such evaluative skills may require that universities remain connected , but not subservient , to commercial R & D programs . 5 . Conclusion and implications Our qualitative and quantitative ﬁndings combine to present a story of the opportunities and potential pitfalls of university engagement in contractual net - works with biotechnology ﬁrms . We focus here on two patenting outcomes for R1 universities , empha - sizing the extent to which research - intensive cam - puses produce higher impact life science patents for their involvement in university – ﬁrm networks . Both the regressions and the comments of technology li - censing ofﬁcers emphasize the central role that ﬁrms play as a source of information that enables effective evaluation of the potential of often ambiguous faculty innovations . While connections to a commercial network are of great value , too many linkages can preclude the de - velopment of a stable ﬂow of higher impact patents . Moreover , in terms of overall portfolio impact , a 1708 J . Owen - Smith , W . W . Powell / Research Policy 32 ( 2003 ) 1695 – 1711 “Goldilocks” approach of partial embeddedness ( nei - ther too isolated , nor captured ) may generate positive beneﬁts for academic technology transfer efforts . To the extent that such beneﬁts are present , they seem to depend upon an institution’s level of technology transfer experience . The advantages of embeddedness and experience depend upon having both available stocks of basic life science and a higher volume ﬂow of patents . The ﬁndings presented in Table 2 suggest that in the late 1980s and through the 1990s , an increased volume of patenting led to higher impact patent port - folios at US universities . These schools developed increased ability to evaluate the possible value of patents and to discern potentially valuable intellec - tual properties from the broad range of new ﬁnd - ings developed on campus . The ﬁndings presented in Table 3 reiterate this pattern , as high - volume patenting exhibits a positive effect on the devel - opment of blockbuster intellectual properties . The relationship between network connections and both types of patent impact is curvilinear . We contend that the pattern of decreasing returns to connec - tivity highlights both the importance and potential dangers of turning to corporate partners for help in assessing the value of innovations . These ﬁnd - ings reﬂect the extent to which university learning about technology transfer proceeds through diffuse channels , embedded in contractual relations with ﬁrms . We also ﬁnd several mediating factors . The role that medical schools and clinical publications play in explaining the impact of university life science innovations is interesting . Life science research con - ducted in medical centers is closer to commercial needs and thus contributes to both the volume of patents developed by a university and to the over - all value of patent portfolios . Nevertheless , that very intersection makes medical school research less likely to contribute to the development of a block - buster technology , as increasing integration between academic and commercial biomedicine may limit the possibility for developing highly novel ﬁnd - ings outside the established trajectories of corporate research . The complex relationship between published and patented life science research extends beyond aca - demic medical centers . The impact of a university’s patent portfolio depends on the stock of basic life sci - ence ﬁndings ( articles ) developed on campus . The im - pact of those articles , though , affects aggregate ﬂows of prior art citations but does not signiﬁcantly alter the likelihood of developing a blockbuster . In other words , highly fertile publications may serve as an entry ticket to commercialization networks that en - able universities to develop higher impact intellectual property . The academic reputation of university scientists may matter indirectly as researchers who are both highly visible and commercially engaged attract the attention of corporate partners and , in so doing , in - crease the ﬂow of valuable information into university technology transfer ofﬁces . While we do not ﬁnd direct evidence of this phenomenon in our regres - sions , the comments of a very experienced licensing associate suggest the importance of academic accom - plishment for access to ﬁrms : “We have faculty who are well known to companies , who may have done consulting for them , referrals from such professors get us attention . ” If high - impact publications provide an entry ticket to information rich networks in the life sciences , and if access contributes to increasing commercial accomplishment , then scientiﬁc reputa - tion might start universities on a path of increasing returns . Such feedback loops , however , can be dampened by the negative effect of over - embeddeness on patent impact . If highly cited intellectual property helps make universities more attractive to commercial partners , and universities build strong links to a small number of afﬁliates , then connectivity can reduce overall patent impact . In such cases , commercial accomplishment may carry the danger of too much integration across academic and commercial interests . Under these circumstances , the dynamics of entry and movement in complex networks governed by multiple , overlapping institutional regimes may force universities into an uncomfortable position where one outcome of achievement is the diminution of the very characteristics that make university research potentially valuable to industry . In addition to the more straightforward dangers of capture by corporate partners , university involvement in such commer - cial networks may carry unforeseen consequences for both academic and commercial activities on campus .
