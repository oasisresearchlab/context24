Mechanosensation of tissue stiffness activates the Rho / ROCK pathway to increase actomyosin - mediated cellular tension to re - establish force equilibrium . To determine how actomyosin tension affects tissue homeostasis and tumor development , we expressed conditionally - active ROCK2 in mouse skin . ROCK activation elevated tissue stiffness via increased collagen . β - catenin , a key element of mechanotranscription pathways , was stabilized by ROCK activation leading to nuclear accumulation , transcriptional activation and consequent hyperproliferation and skin thickening . Inhibiting actomyosin contractility by blocking LIMK or myosin ATPase attenuated these responses , as did FAK inhibition . Tumor number , growth and progression were increased by ROCK activation , while ROCK blockade was inhibitory , implicating actomyosin - mediated cellular tension and consequent collagen deposition as significant tumor promoters . Introduction Tumors grow in complex environments in which external factors , such as tissue rheology ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ) , influence growth and progression . Despite the association of tissue stiffness with cancer being so well established that palpation and elastography are diagnostic procedures for some tumors , the mechanisms that translate mechanosensation of external conditions to the induction of tumor - promoting responses remain poorly understood . 1 , 6 2 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 4 5 5 1 1 2 1 , 7 1 2 3 4 5 7 6 Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] Rho GTPases act as network hubs that transduce signals from the extracellular environment to proteins that mediate biological responses ( Parsons et al . , 2010 ) . ROCK1 and ROCK2 are essential for RhoA and RhoC - initiated actomyosin contractility through phosphorylation of substrates including LIM kinases ( LIMK ) , myosin regulatory light chains ( MLC2 ) and the myosin - binding subunit of the MLC phosphatase ( MYPT ) , which facilitates cell movement and contributes to cancer metastasis ( Olson and Sahai , 2009 ) . Rho activation was first found after growth factor receptor stimulation ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) , but Rho proteins respond to additional inputs , including external force , to affect cytoskeletal structure and function ( Parsons et al . , 2010 ) . External tensile force results in compensatory Rho / ROCK activation , to increase cellular tension and reestablish force equilibrium ( Wozniak et al . , 2003 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . At the same time , internal cellular tension remains in equilibrium with the external microenvironment through the reorganization , modification and / or synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins ( Chiquet et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2007 ) . In some pathological contexts , force equilibration may not be achieved , resulting in a mechanical autocrine loop that drives rheological changes and consequent tissue stiffness . Skin is a mechanically responsive tissue ( Silver et al . , 2003 ) , which forms a barrier that protects against damaging environmental stresses . Net tension in the skin is a balance between external collagen fibrils and internal actomyosin cellular tension ( Silver et al . , 2003 ) . To maintain barrier integrity , cells are constantly renewed in a tightly controlled process termed epidermal homeostasis ( Blanpain and Fuchs , 2009 ) . Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) develops in keratinocytes that have differentiated and moved from the basal layer , and is the second most common skin cancer ( Xie , 2008 ) . Rho and ROCK signaling are associated with SCC ( Jiang et al . , 2010 ; Lefort et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) , although details of how Rho / ROCK may promote SCC are lacking . In this current study , we investigated how actomyosin cellular tension influences tissue rheology , epidermal homeostasis and tumor growth and progression . Results ROCK activation increases tissue stiffness To investigate how cellular tension affects tissue homeostasis and cancer , we created K14 - ROCK : ER mice ( Samuel et al . , 2009a ) that express a chimeric protein ( ROCK : ER ) consisting of the human ROCK2 kinase domain fused to mutant 17β - estradiol - insensitive estrogen receptor ( ER ) hormone binding domain ( HBD ) ( Littlewood et al . , 1995 ) and enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) under the control of the K14 promoter ( Figures S1A , B ) . Upon HBD binding of tamoxifen or 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( 4HT ) , ROCK : ER is activated and phosphorylates physiological substrates leading to actomyosin - mediated contractility ( Samuel et al . , 2009a ) . K14 - ROCK : ER and a control kinase - dead ( KD ) version ( K14 - KD : ER ) were each targeted to the Hprt locus , leading to expression ~ 15 % of endogenous ROCK2 ( Samuel et al . , 2009a ) . Consistent with previous results ( Samuel et al . , 2009a ) , 4HT treatment of K14 - ROCK : ER mouse skin increased Mlc2 phosphorylation , but not in K14 - KD : ER or Wild - type ( WT ) control mice ( Figure 1A ) . Thr696 phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of the Mlc phosphatase ( pMypt1 ) , which inhibits Mlc dephosphorylation ( Feng et al . , 1999 ) , was also increased by 4HT specifically in K14 - ROCK : ER mouse skin ( Figure 1A ) . To determine how ROCK activation and consequent cellular tension affected tissue rheology , K14 - ROCK : ER and WT skin dorsal skin was given 5 daily 4HT treatments , then subjected to rheological analysis by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Compared to WT skin , ROCK activated skin showed an AFM force map skewed towards high kPa values and significant increase in Young’s modulus , Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] demonstrating increased tissue stiffness ( Figure 1B , C ) . When viewed through orthogonal polarizing filters , ROCK activated skin also had increased picrosirius red fluorescence , indicating increased collagen fiber diameters ( Figure 1B , C ) . Accordingly , second harmonic generation ( SHG ) analysis of 4HT treated K14 - ROCK : ER skin showed increased collagen density and expanded distribution from the epidermal surface to greater depths compared to WT ( Figures 1D , E , Movies S1 , S2 and S3 ) , confirming previous reports of correlations between optical and mechanical properties of collagen in vivo ( Raub et al . , 2010 ; Raub et al . , 2008 ) . These results show that ROCK - induced actomyosin cellular tension is associated with increased collagen fiber diameter and elevated collagen deposition over a broader distribution . Therefore , internal cellular tension drives significant tissue - level compensatory responses . ROCK activation drives epidermal proliferation and skin thickening Within 5 days of daily 4HT treatment , ROCK activated skin was significantly thicker than K14 - KD : ER and WT skin ( Figure 2A , S2A ) , associated with interfollicular epidermal expansion by several cell layers . ROCK - induced epidermal thickening was associated with a significant doubling in BrdU - positive proliferating basal keratinocytes relative to control K14 - KD : ER or WT mice ( Figure 2B , S2B ) . K14 - ROCK : ER keratinocytes cultured in 4HT grew in soft agar , yielding 2 . 5 - fold as many anchorage - independent colonies as K14 - KD : ER keratinocytes ( Figure 2C ) . Y27632 treatment abolished this effect , showing ROCK dependence of the increased anchorage - independent growth . ROCK - induced skin thickening was associated with expansion of the suprabasal interfollicular epidermal cell layer expressing cytokeratin 1 ( K1 ) and ectopic expression of the follicular cytokeratin 6 ( K6 ) by immunofluorescence and FACS analyses ( Figure 2D , S2B , S2C ) . K14 - KD : ER and WT control mice had no skin thickening and retained normal K1 and K6 expression following 4HT treatment ( Figure 2D , S2D ) . Inhibition of lysyl oxidase ( Lox ) with β - aminopropionitrile ( BAPN ) to reduce collagen fibril cross - linking in rigid matrices ( Levental et al . , 2009 ) reversed K6 induction ( Figure 2D ) . K6 expression , which is commonly observed in SCC ( Haass et al . , 2006 ; Khayyata et al . , 2009 ) , has been associated with either epidermal hyperplasia or inflammation ( Kopan and Fuchs , 1989 ; Stoler et al . , 1988 ; Weiss et al . , 1984 ) . However , inflammatory infiltrate as observed in DMBA / TPA papillomas was not evident in ROCK activated skin ( Figure S2E ) . The observations that ROCK activation caused skin thickening , increased proliferation , K6 expression and anchorage independent growth indicate that sustained actomyosin - mediated cellular tension has a pro - proliferative role within the epidermis . ROCK activates β - catenin and elevates transcriptional target expression β - catenin has important roles in epidermal homeostasis and tumorigenesis , regulating progenitor cell proliferation through Tcf / Lef target gene transcription ( Lo Celso et al . , 2004 ; Malanchi et al . , 2008 ; Nguyen et al . , 2009 ; Zhu and Watt , 1999 ) . β - catenin is also a central element in transcription pathways responsive to mechanical stimulation ( Arnsdorf et al . , 2009 ; Sen et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that β - catenin might mediate responses to elevated collagen and tissue stiffness . ROCK activation within the epidermis caused significant increases in expression of the Tcf / Lef target genes CD44 ( Wielenga et al . , 1999 ) , Cyclin D1 ( Shtutman et al . , 1999 ; Tetsu and McCormick , 1999 ) and Lgr5 ( Jaks et al . , 2008 ) at mRNA and protein levels ( Figure 3A , 3B , 3C ) relative to K14 - KD : ER and WT epidermis . CD44 and Cyclin D1 mRNA were also upregulated in primary cultured keratinocytes by ROCK activation ( Figure S3 ) . To confirm Tcf / Lef transcriptional activation , K14 - ROCK : ER and K14 - KD : ER mice were crossed with TOPGAL reporter mice , which express β - galactosidase under the control of an engineered TOP promoter containing 3 tandem Tcf / Lef consensus binding sites , ( DasGupta and Fuchs , 1999 ) . TOPGAL ; K14 - ROCK : ER mice expressed β - galactosidase throughout the interfollicular epidermis upon 4HT Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] treatment , unlike TOPGAL ; K14 - KD : ER mice ( Figure 3D ) . Luciferase - based Tcf / Lef ( TOPFlash ) assays of cultured primary keratinocytes also showed significant 4HT - induced Tcf / Lef transcriptional activity in ROCK : ER expressing cells , comparable to KD : ER or ROCK : ER cells treated with GSK3β inhibitor 6 - bromoindirubin - 39 - oxime ( BIO ) ( Meijer et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 3E ) . These results show that ROCK activation increased β - catenin transcriptional activity and target gene transcription , which could drive interfollicular epidermal cell proliferation . Immunofluorescence of ROCK - activated epidermis revealed re - distribution of β - catenin ( red fluorescence and red trace ) from membrane to cytoplasm ( red arrowheads ) and nucleus ( blue arrowheads ) , compared to identically treated control K14 - KD : ER mice ( Figure 4A , B ) . In contrast , E - cadherin ( green fluorescence and green trace ) , which associates with β - catenin in adherens junctions remained at the cell membrane ( Figure 4A , B ) . An image processing macro ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) developed to quantify nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of β - catenin immunofluorescence showed ~ 2 - fold increase in nuclear β - catenin upon ROCK activation and 5 - fold elevation in total β - catenin relative to K14 - KD : ER epidermis , consistent with β - catenin western blots of epidermal lysates ( Figure 4C ) . β - catenin positive cells were also found increased in ROCK - activated epidermis by FACS analysis of dissociated cells ( Figure 4D ) . Immunofluorescence of ROCK - activated epidermis using an antibody against activated β - catenin ( dephosphorylated at Ser37 and Thr41 ) ( van Noort et al . , 2002 ) revealed that nuclear localized β - catenin is the activated form ( Figure 4E ) , which was associated with increased phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser9 that blocks phosphorylation of substrate such as β - catenin ( Dajani et al . , 2001 ) . BAPN treatment to inhibit Lox activity and collagen cross - linking reversed both the nuclear accumulation of active β - catenin and GSK3β phosphorylation ( Figure 4E ) . These results indicate that the epidermal hyperproliferation in ROCK - activated epidermis is associated with Tcf / Lef transcriptional activity brought about by stabilization and activation of β - catenin . β - catenin deletion abolishes ROCK - induced epidermal hyperproliferation To determine whether β - catenin mediates ROCK - induced hyperproliferation , we crossed K14 - ROCK : ER and K14 - KD : ER mice onto a background homozygous for a conditional floxed β - catenin allele ( Ctnnb1 ) ( Brault et al . , 2001 ) and K14 - driven Cre recombinase / ER fusion protein expression ( K14 - Cre : ER ) ( Vasioukhin et al . , 1999 ) . K14 - ROCK : ER ; β - catenin ; K14 - Cre : ER compound mutant mice treated for 5 days with 4HT exhibited loss of β - catenin within the interfollicular epidermis ( Figure 5A , S4A ) , which did not affect ROCK activation or LIMK activity , as shown by Mypt and cofilin phosphorylation respectively ( Figure S4B ) . β - catenin deletion blocked ROCK - induction of CD44v3 - v10 or Cyclin D1 ( Figure 5B , S4C ) . In the absence of β - catenin , ROCK activation did not induce epidermal hyperproliferation as indicated by reduced Ki67 immunoreactivity or skin thickening ( Figure 5C , S4D ) . Indeed , β - catenin loss completely abolished ROCK - mediated skin thickening ( Figure 5D ) and normalized Ki67 labeling ( Figure 5E ) , but did not affect ROCK - induced collagen deposition ( Figure 5F ) , indicating that elevated collagen is not a consequence of β - catenin activation . β - catenin loss had no effect on epidermal homeostasis in control K14 - KD : ER mice ( Figure S4E ) . Consistent with β - catenin being a driver of epidermal proliferation , K14 - Cre : ER , Ctnnb1 mice expressing a 4HT - inducible version of constitutively active β - catenin ( Harada et al . , 1999 ) exhibited ~ 5 - fold interfollicular epidermal thickening associated with increased β - catenin ( Figure 5G ) . These results indicate that ROCK induced interfollicular epidermal hyperproliferation is β - catenin dependent , associated with increased β - catenin transcriptional activity and expression of β - catenin regulated transcriptional targets , placing ROCK activation and actomyosin - mediated cellular tension in a pathway leading to β - catenin activation . tm2Kem Fl / Fl tm1Mmt / + Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] Actomyosin contractility is required for ROCK - induced epidermal proliferation LIMK1 and LIMK2 are phosphorylated and activated by ROCK , and in turn phosphorylate and inactivate the F - actin severing cofilin proteins ( Scott and Olson , 2007 ) . To determine whether inhibiting mediators of actomyosin contractility would block ROCK induced epidermal hyperproliferation , a selective and non - toxic LIMK inhibitor ( LIMKi ; compound 3 in ( Ross - Macdonald et al . , 2008 ) ) , was applied in combination with 4HT . Staining with phospho - cofilin specific antibody ( Figure S5A ) revealed that a single LIMKi treatment abolished cofilin phosphorylation ( Figure S5B ) . LIMKi application with 4HT for 5 days blocked skin thickening and ectopic interfollicular K6 in K14 - ROCK : ER mice ( Figure 6A white arrows , Figure 6B , S5C ) , accompanied by absence of cofilin phosphorylation ( Figure 6A , Figure S5C ) and reduced β - catenin levels ( Figure 6A yellow arrow ) . Similarly , inhibition of myosin ATPase activity to block actomyosin contraction with daily Blebbistatin ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) application eliminated skin thickening , ectopic interfollicular K6 expression and reduced β - catenin levels ( Figure 6A , B ) . Lox inhibition with BAPN to reduce collagen cross - linking also significantly reduced skin thickening ( Figure 6B ) . LIMKi and Blebbistatin also reduced ROCK - induced BrdU incorporation in 4HT treated K14 - ROCK : ER skin to a level comparable to untreated K14 - ROCK : ER skin ( Figure 6C ) , confirming that ROCK - induced hyperproliferation was reversed by inhibition of actomyosin contractility . In primary cultured keratinocytes , Y27632 or LIMKi reduced ROCK - induced BrdU incorporation to levels observed in untreated cells or 4HT treated control K14 - KD : ER keratinocytes ( Figure S5D ) . ROCK induced collagen deposition also was significantly reduced by LIMKi or Blebbistatin ( Figure 6D ) . These observations indicate that interfollicular epidermal hyperproliferation , β - catenin accumulation and collagen deposition following ROCK activation is dependent upon sustained cellular tension mediated by actomyosin contractility . β - catenin stabilization induced by integrin - responsive signaling pathway Collagen is a major extracellular matrix protein that influences cellular behaviors by promoting integrin clustering and activating downstream signaling ( Egeblad et al . , 2010 ) , with FAK activation being an early response ( Zhao and Guan , 2009 ) . FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr397 was elevated in 4HT treated ROCK : ER skin relative to control KD : ER or WT skin ( Figure 7A ) , while application of the selective FAK inhibitor PF - 562271 ( Roberts et al . , 2008 ) blocked FAK autophosphorylation ( Figure 7A ) . The PI3K / Akt axis has been shown to be important in FAK - mediated signaling downstream of collagen - activated integrins ( Tian et al . , 2002 ) . Akt phosphorylation on an activating Ser473 position was elevated in ROCK - activated skin and reduced by topical application of FAK inhibitor PF - 562271 ( Figure 7B ) . Akt phosphorylates GSK3β on Ser9 , thereby creating a competitive pseudosubstrate that blocks substrate phosphorylation ( Dajani et al . , 2001 ) . ROCK activation increased GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation relative to control 4HT - treated WT or KD : ER skin ( Figure 7C ) , accompanied by decreased β - catenin phosphorylation on GSK3β sites Ser37 and Thr41 ( Figure 7C ) . Both increased inhibitory GSK3β inhibitory Ser9phosphorylation and decreased β - catenin Ser37 and Thr41 phosphorylation were reversed by FAK inhibitor PF562271 ( Figure 7C ) . In support of a FAK > PI3K / AKT > GSK3β pathway being responsible for β - catenin regulation , the increased levels of β - catenin and skin thickening in ROCK activated skin were blocked by FAK inhibitor PF562271 ( Figure 7D , 7E ) . ROCK promotes papillomagenesis To test the effect of cellular tension on tumor growth and progression , we examined how ROCK - activation influenced skin tumors in a 2 - stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol . Syngeneic papillomas are induced in FVB / N mice by one application of the mutagen dimethylbenz [ a ] anthracene ( DMBA ) Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] followed by repeated applications of 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) ( Hennings et al . , 1993 ) . Papillomas arise and reproducibly convert at low frequency to invasive carcinomas by a mechanism involving H - Ras mutations and MAP - kinase activation ( Balmain et al . , 1984 ; Quintanilla et al . , 1986 ) . Tumors produced by this procedure model human SCC and have been used to determine the dependence on genes such as beta ; - catenin ( Malanchi et al . , 2008 ) . K14 - ROCK : ER or K14 - KD : ER mouse cohorts backcrossed at least 10 generations onto the FVB / N background were treated twice weekly with vehicle or 4HT in addition to DMBA / TPA for a total of 15 weeks ( Figure 8A ) , at which point carcinomas were observed and the experiment halted . Significantly increased papillomas were observed in 4HT - treated K14 - ROCK : ER mice compared to 4HT or vehicle - treated K14 - KD : ER mice or vehicle - treated K14 - ROCK : ER mice ( Figures 8B , S6A ) . A shift towards larger papillomas ( Figure 8C ) and increased papilloma incidence ( Figure 8B ) resulted in a significantly greater total papilloma burden ( a function of papilloma volume and number ) in 4HT - treated K14 - ROCK : ER mice relative to vehicle - treated control and to both K14 - KD : ER treatment groups ( Figure 8D ) . Only the ROCK - activated cohort had papilloma to carcinomas conversion within 15 weeks ( Figure 8D ) . SHG analysis of epidermal collagen revealed significantly higher levels in the keratinocyte layer associated with resident papillomas ( Figure 8E ) . Total and nuclear β - catenin were significantly increased in 4HT treated K14 - ROCK : ER papillomas compared to 4HT treated K14 - KDK : ER papillomas , consistent with the increased tumor growth ( Figure 8F , S6B ) . These results show that sustained ROCK activation is sufficient to elevate collagen , activate β - catenin and increase papilloma incidence , growth and progression to carcinoma . The selective ROCK inhibitor Y27632 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) was used to reduce Rock signaling during DMBA / TPA - induced papillomagenesis . Y27632 treatment of DMBA / TPA treated FVB / N mice markedly reduced pMypt levels within hyperproliferative skin and papillomas ( Figure S6C ) , confirming tissue penetration and Rock inhibition . Pure FVB / N cohorts treated with Y27632 ( Figure 8G ) twice weekly during the DMBA / TPA procedure developed significantly fewer ( Figures 8H , S6C ) and smaller papillomas ( Figure 8I ) than control vehicle treated mice , resulting in significantly reduced tumor burden ( Figure 8J ) . Papilloma to carcinoma conversion rate was 6 . 5 % was in the DMBA / TPA - treated cohort , but only 1 . 5 % in the cohort co - administered Y27632 within the 20 week treatment course ( Figure 8J ) . Collagen levels were significantly reduced in the keratinocyte layer associated with resident papillomas as determined by SHG ( Figure 8K ) . Y27632 treated papillomas also exhibited significantly lower Cyclin D1 and Ki67 histoscores compared to vehicle treated papillomas ( Figure S6D ) . Total as well as nuclear β - catenin was significantly reduced in Y27632 treated papillomas , consistent with the reduced tumor growth ( Figure 8L , S6E ) . These results show that Rock inhibition lowered epidermal collagen , reduced papillomagenesis and delayed tumor growth and progression by reducing proliferation , indicating that actomyosin - mediated cellular tension makes crucial contributions to tumor promotion . Human skin tumors exhibit elevated ROCK expression and activity To determine whether ROCK signaling was altered in human skin cancers , immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray derived from 40 cases of human squamous skin carcinomas was carried out with a pan - specific ROCK1 / 2 antibody ( Figure S6F ) and a phospho - specific antibody for the ROCK substrate MYPT as an indicator of ROCK activation . Most skin tumors analyzed ( 90 % ) expressed high ROCK levels relative to phenotypically normal skin ( Table S1 , Figure S6G ) . Positive pixel analysis of SCC samples revealed statistically significant increases in ROCK and pMYPT relative to normal skin samples ( Figure 8M ) , and MYPT phosphorylation correlated significantly with ROCK expression ( Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] Figure 8N ) . These results show that ROCK over - expression correlates with ROCK activation and is a common occurrence in human SCC , suggesting that ROCK activation drives cellular tension to promote human skin cancer . However , pMYPT staining indirectly correlates with MLC2 phosphorylation and actomyosin contractility and as a consequence , inferences should be treated with some caution . Discussion Collagen , a major component of the extracellular matrix , may be increased in density as well as in post - translational modifications that alter the structure and organization of collagen fibers , contributing to variations in tissue stiffness ( Egeblad et al . , 2010 ) . Cells grown in vitro on stiff collagen matrices have been shown to activate Rho and ROCK signaling leading to increased actomyosin contractility , which generates counter - balancing cellular tension in an attempt to balance internal and external forces ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) in a process dubbed “mechanoreciprocity” ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to this outside > inside signaling , there is evidence from cell - based experiments that ROCK - mediated actomyosin contractility inside the cell may , conversely , reorganize extracellular matrix structures or stimulate increased matrix protein synthesis and secretion ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ; Discher et al . , 2005 ; Huang and Ingber , 2005 ; Provenzano et al . , 2008 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . We now show that the conditional - activation of ROCK , the principal driver of actomyosin contractility and cellular tension via MYPT and MLC phosphorylation ( Figure 1A ) ( Samuel et al . , 2009a ) , in murine epidermis results in significant modification of the extracellular matrix through increased collagen deposition leading to increased tissue stiffness . Accompanying the increased tissue stiffness , activation of the mechanically - responsive β - catenin transcriptional co - activator promotes target gene transcription and increased epidermal cell proliferation . These results show that the development of cellular tension profoundly affects the external microenvironment and influences tissue homeostasis . It has long been observed that tumor development is associated with increased tissue stiffness . In fact , cancers such as mammary tumors are often detected by palpation or elastography of the abnormally rigid tissue that surrounds them . Increased stiffness of the cellular microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor cell survival , proliferation and progression ( Egeblad et al . , 2010 ) . During the course of tumor growth and progression , the tissue microenvironment undergoes significant remodeling , which increases the mechanical forces that cancer cells are subjected to evoking compensatory responses via Rho and ROCK activation ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ) . Results from the present study also show that this relationship is reciprocal ; increased ROCK - induced cellular tension in vivo causes alterations in the extracellular matrix and increased tissue stiffness . An important question is whether the increased tissue stiffness induced by elevated cellular tension is sufficient to promote tumor growth and progression . The results from our study show that conditional ROCK activation and consequent increase in collagen deposition did indeed increase tumor growth and progression , while ROCK inhibition reduced these responses . Therefore , in addition to external tissue - level forces modulating cellular responses , mechanical alterations at the cellular - level can influence tissue mechanoproperties that promote cancer . It has generally been assumed that the increased Rho and ROCK activity commonly observed in cancer cells reflects a role in promoting invasion and metastasis ( Olson and Sahai , 2009 ) . However , results from this study indicate that altered expression and / or activity of actomyosin regulators may promote tumor growth by influencing the tumor microenvironment . Therefore , in addition to ROCK inhibition , targeting proteins such as LIMK and myosin that work downstream of ROCK in the regulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton may have anti - tumor therapeutic benefits by counteracting the effects of cellular tension on the microenvironment . While our studies clearly show a role of actomyosin contractility in generating increased tissue stiffness Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] via collagen deposition , further work will be required to determine the relative contributions of tumor and tumor - associated cells such as stromal fibroblasts . Mechanical regulation of β - catenin has been well documented in bone , a tissue often subjected to continuous and repeated strain . Here , mechanical factors lead to β - catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation , which is associated with the activation of a FAK > PI3K / Akt > GSK3β phosphorylation cascade ( Case and Rubin , 2010 ; Santos et al . , 2010 ) , in agreement with the observations in mouse skin . Mechanical activation of the Drosophila β - catenin homologue armadillo as a result of tissue - level forces has also been reported ( Desprat et al . , 2008 ) . Increased β - catenin levels and concentration in cytoplasmic / nuclear compartments have been reported in human cutaneous SCC tumors ( Malanchi et al . , 2008 ; Papadavid et al . , 2002 ) , consistent with the results in hyperproliferative murine skin ( Figure 4 ) . Interestingly , nuclear β - catenin levels are often elevated at the host - tumor interface of invasive colorectal carcinomas ( Brabletz et al . , 2005 ) . These areas would be predicted sites of elevated mechanoresistance leading to increased external forces and consequently sites of high compensatory Rho / ROCK activation . It would also follow that , in contrast to hard - wired genetic or epigenetic alterations , these relatively acute mechanical responses to external tension contribute to the transdifferentiation potential of tumor cells and promote adaptability of tumors to continuously evolving microenvironmental factors , for instance during the process of metastasis . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture Primary keratinocytes were extracted from tail skin as described ( McLean et al . , 2001 ) . Cells were maintained at 37°C / 5 % CO / 3 % O , in keratinocyte growth medium ( KBM - 2 ; Clonetics ) with epidermal growth factor ( 10 ng / ml ) , insulin ( 5 μg / ml ) , hydrocortisone ( 0 . 5 μg / ml ) , bovine pituitary extract protein ( 70 μg / ml ) and 50 μM Ca on collagen - 1 coated dishes ( Becton Dickinson ) . Clonogenic survival assays Primary keratinocytes were seeded on dishes coated with 0 . 9 % agarose / DMEM ( containing 10 % FBS , L - glutamine and antibiotics ) at 2×10 cells / well in DMEM containing 0 . 45 % agarose ± 1 μM 4HT and maintained at 37 °C / 10 % CO . DMEM±1 μM 4HT was added to each well twice weekly . Two weeks post - seeding , colonies > 80 μm in diameter were scored from 5 fields / well . Human Tissue Microarrays Human TMAs were purchased from Protein Biotechnologies , which confirms that all tissue samples were collected under strict IRB approved guidelines / protocols with informed consent . All collected human tissues were treated under strict confidentiality and according to appropriate applicable laws that protect the confidentiality of personal information . No names or any other identity information were revealed during the development of tissue arrays , nor to end users , and as a result are exempt from consideration by the Beatson Institute Committee on Human Subjects in Medical Research due to being anonymized and non - traceable . CRUK guidelines were followed in the handling and analysis of this material . TMAs containing tumor tissue and normal cores from 40 cases of squamous skin cancer were baked for two hours at 60°C prior to immunohistochemistry . Mice K14 - ROCK : ER mice were described previously ( Samuel et al . , 2009a ) . TOPGAL [ Tg ( Fos - lacZ ) 34Efu / J ] mice were from Jackson Labs . All procedures were performed under appropriate licenses and according 2 2 2 + 4 2 Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] to the UK Home Office guidelines . In vivo gene induction and / or activation and enzyme inhibition 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( 4HT , Sigma , 1mg ) in ethanol ( 100 μl ) was applied to shaved dorsal skin and repeated daily for up to 30 days . Inhibitors ( per mouse , Blebbistatin – 23μg ; Y27632 – 25μg ; LIMKi – 32μg ; PF - 562271 – 160μg ; BAPN – 760μg ) were applied topically once daily for 5 consecutive days in appropriate vehicle . Keratinocyte extraction for western and FACS Epidermal tissue was separated as previously described ( Nowak and Fuchs , 2009 ) . Epidermal cells were lysed in 1 × RIPA buffer for western analysis , Trizol ( Invitrogen ) for mRNA extraction or fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for FACS analysis using standard methods . All FACS analyses were carried out by first gating K14 positive cells . Chemical carcinogenesis Chemical carcinogenesis was carried out as described ( Quintanilla et al . , 1986 ) . DMBA ( Sigma , 25 μg ) in acetone ( 150 μl ) was applied directly to shaved dorsal skin . After three days , TPA ( Sigma , 6 . 25 μg ) was applied in acetone ( 150 μl ) and repeated twice weekly for 20 weeks or until a carcinoma developed . Papillomas were counted and measured weekly . Final papilloma burden was calculated by summing the individual products of papilloma number and the square of each papilloma diameter , which was then normalized across cohorts against the K14 - KD : ER average . Carcinoma conversion rate was calculated as percentage of carcinomas observed relative to total number of papillomas . Histology and immunohistochemistry Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed as described ( Samuel et al . , 2009b ) . Antigen retrieval buffer and antibody dilutions used appear in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Slides were imaged using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer NDP slide scanner ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) and Digital Slide Server ( Slidepath ) software . Elastic Modulus Measurements and collagen staining The mechanical properties of fresh frozen skin ( Foutz et al . , 1992 ) were assayed using an MFP3D - Bio inverted optical AFM mounted on a Nikon TE2000 - U inverted phase microscope ( Asylum Research ) . Pyramidal Si N cantilevers with a manufacturer spring constant of 0 . 06N / m fitted with 5 μm borosilicate glass microspheres ( Novascan Tech ) were calibrated using the thermal noise method ( Hutter and Bechhoefer , 1993 ) prior to AFM indentation . Force maps were acquired by sample indentation with a force of 5nN . The Hertz model of impact ( Hertz , 1881 ) was used to calculate the Young’s elastic modulus of resulting force curves . Heat maps were generated using Igor Pro 6 ( Wavemetrics ) . Picrosirius Red staining was carried out as described ( Levental et al . , 2009 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . Acquisition of second harmonic generation ( SHG ) data from collagen Samples of depilated and freshly excised skin were imaged using a 20× 0 . 95 NA water immersion objective on an inverted Nikon TE - 2000 microscope body . The excitation source was a Ti : Sapphire femto - second laser cavity ( Coherent Chameleon Ultra II ) , coupled into a LaVision Biotec Trim - scope scan - head . 890 nm excitation wavelength was used to simultaneously collect SHG signal ( 435±20 nm ) from collagen and auto - fluorescence ( 525±25 nm ) from surrounding tissue . Signal was acquired from 3 4 Actomyosin - mediated cellular tension drives increased tissue stiffness and β - catenin activation to induce interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia and tumor growth http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pmc / articles / PMC3115541 / # FN3 [ 02 / 08 / 2013 11 : 46 : 42 ] three separate volumes measuring 500 × 500 × 200 μm across each sample , in steps of 2 μm imaging depth , with an acquisition time of 30 minutes per volume . Analysis of SHG signal from collagen ImageJ was used to calculate percentage area covered by SHG signal per optical slice within a volume , after conversion to a binary image based upon a manually determined threshold value . Results were expressed as median ± SEM across all data sets for each genotype . A Grey Level Contrast Matrix ( GLCM ) analysis was performed upon optical slices at which maximum coverage was observed for each phenotype using the USB GLCM plug - in for ImageJ . The shown parameters were calculated for varying pixel displacement values . Results were expressed as average ± SEM for each parameter for all genotypes . Statistical analysis Unless indicated , statistical significance was determined by Student’s t - test . Data are shown as means ± SD unless indicated . Box and whisker plots show medians and quartiles with p - values calculated using Mann - Whitney test for comparing medians . In all cases , p < 0 . 05 was used as significance cut - off .
