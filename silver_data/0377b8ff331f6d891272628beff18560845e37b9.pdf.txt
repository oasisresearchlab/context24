Introduction The mechanical properties of living cells can affect their physical interactions with their surrounding extracellular matrix [ 1 , 2 ] , potentially influencing the process of mechanical signal transduction in living tissues [ 3 – 7 ] . Alterations in cell properties are of fundamental importance for a wide range of processes , and changes in cell mechanics are associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis [ 8 ] , asthma [ 9 ] , cancer [ 10 ] , inflammation [ 11 ] and malaria [ 12 ] . The mechanical properties of living cells have been quantified using various testing methods , such as micropip - ette aspiration [ 8 , 13 ] , magnetic twisting cytometry [ 14 ] , optical tweezers [ 15 – 17 ] and nanoindentation [ 18 – 20 ] . Although there are some good review papers on cell mechanics [ 21 , 22 ] , they mainly focus on using micropipette aspiration tech - niques . From the perspective of cell mechanics , one should be aware of what is measured with respect to particular techniques . For example , it is often observed thatthecellappearssofter [ 23 ] duringmicropipetteaspirationscomparedwithcyto - compression [ 24 ] or indentation with a large spherical tip [ 25 ] . During micropipette aspirations , it was observed that the cytoskeletoncan bedisrupted [ 26 , 27 ] . Insuch a case , there is no ( or very limited ) tensile stress in the actin fibres , which significantly contributes to cell stiffness . Therefore , cell mechanics can be approximated , as cyto - sol reinforced with bundles of actin fibres ( with diameter of 9 – 10 nm ) . The weight concentration of actin fibres is 1 – 10 % for non - muscle cells and 10 – 20 % for muscle cells , and the elastic modulus of these actin fibres is 1 . 3 – 2 . 5 GPa [ 28 ] . This paper will shed light on the nanoindentation techniques , because investigation of mechanical properties of living cells at the nanometre ( or sub - micrometre ) scale is essential for understanding how cells interact with the surrounding materials . Cells would sense and respond to the nanoscale ( or microscale ) features on the materials surface . For example , when in contact with implanted devices or scaffold materials , cells interact with nanoscale ( or submicroscale ) surface features in topography [ 29 , 30 ] and surface chemistry [ 31 , 32 ] . Therefore , the nanobiomechanics of the living cells is very important for surface design of the implanted materials and the scaffold materials for tissue engineering . In addition , it also helps us to improve the understanding of cell interaction with nanoparticles , which is important for nanotoxicology [ 33 ] and nanomedicine [ 34 ] . Compared with other measurement techniques , nanoindentation has the advantage of in situ imaging of the indented cells & 2014 The Authors .

It also has the unique feature of map - ping the measured mechanical properties over the investigated surface of the sample [ 35 ] . However , data interpretation for nanoindentation of living cells is often difficult . Despite abundant experimental data reporting nano - biomechanics of living cells , there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on testing with different tip geometries and mechanical models . Therefore , the goals of this study were ( i ) to present the strategy of selecting the right type of indenter tips ; ( ii ) to illus - trate cell mechanics at different test conditions ; ( iii ) to discuss the mechanical models that enable extracting the mechanical properties of living cells during nanoindentation . 2 . Experimental aspects 2 . 1 . Nanoindenter apparatus and atomic force microscope Nanoindentation is also known as depth sensing indentation , in which the indentation load – depth – time ( P – d – t ) profile is recorded . It enables probing the mechanical properties at the nanoscale or microscale . For such a small - scale indentation , there are different approachesto take with respect to the testing instrumentation . In general , we could divide them into nano - indenter apparatus and atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . The key difference between the commercial nanoindentation apparatus and the AFM is on the different transduceroperation mechanisms : the former uses electrical capacitance gages ( figure 1 a ) or magnetic coils to directly drive the indenter into the sample . When a voltage is applied , an electrostatic force is generated between the pick - up electrode and drive plates ( as depicted in figure 1 a ) , resulting in the movement of the pick - up electrode between the drive plates . While the AFM actuates the tip indirectly via the bending of a cantilever , the AFM operates by measuring attractive or repulsive forces between a tip and the sample , which causes vertical deflection of the cantilever . To detect the displacement of the cantilever , a laser is reflected at the back of the cantilever and collected in a photodiode ( figure 1 b ) . In addition to quasi - static loading , a dynamic drive signal can be superposed with the force curve ( figure 1 c ) in both the nanoindenter apparatus [ 36 ] and the AFM [ 37 ] . This enables measurement of the storage modulus , loss modulus and phase angle , which can be converted to the instantaneous modulus , equilibrium modulus and viscosity [ 38 ] . The nanoindenter apparatus allows better control of the indentation force and displacement . The AFM offers the unique advantages of applying very small indentation forces ( below 100 pN ) , but accurate calibration is not easy [ 39 ] . Owing to ultra - high resolutions in force and displace - ment , AFM nanoindentation is particularly useful for probing living cells and subcellular components such as the cell membrane and cytoskeleton . 2 . 2 . Choice of appropriate atomic force microscope tips There are various tip geometries that can be fitted with the AFM cantilever for nanoindentation tests . The advantages and disadvantages of these tips are discussed as follows . The shape of cells can be spherical or spreading in mor - phology , depending on the physiological conditions and microenvironment of the living cells and cell types . The choice of appropriate AFM tips depends on cell morphology , cell type and what is of interest ( cellular mechanics or sub - cellular mechanics ) . This would provide useful guidelines for designing experimental protocols . 2 . 2 . 1 . Flat punch Indentation of cells with a flat - ended cylindrical punch ( figure 2 ) is also known as cytoindentation [ 19 ] . In this case , the size of the flat punch is much smaller than the cell . This type of indenter is preferred for a very soft and fragile cellular or subcellular structure . The advantage is that data inter - pretation is relatively straightforward because it avoids the complication of determining the contact area . The contact area is less likely to be affected by thermal drift or creep . The drawback is the spatial resolution is relatively limited com - pared with the pointed indenter ( e . g . pyramid and conical tip ) ; therefore , it is not suitable to characterize fine features . In addition , there are also other practical concerns for using flat punches , such as alignment , detection of contact point and force concentration around edges . The tips are usually made of silicon or glass . 2 . 2 . 2 . Spherical tip This type of indenter ( figure 3 ) is also ideal for very soft and fragile cellular or subcellular structures .

As the effective strain is related to the ratio of the contact radius and the tip radius , it enables determining the stress – strain curves of the indented materials . The typical spherical tip is made of glass which is easy to manufacture . Similar to the flat punch probe , the spherical glass probe is less likely to cause damage to cells [ 40 ] . Again , this may not be good for probing fine features . The typical radius of the probe for indentation of cells is 2 . 5 – 10 m m . The representative strain for the spherical tip is the ratio of the contact radius over the effective tip radius [ 41 ] . 2 . 2 . 3 . Pyramid tip At a given penetration , the pyramid indenter ( figure 4 ) yields a much smallercontact areacompared with the spherical and flat punchtips . Itisparticularlyusefultoprobefine featuressuchas the cytoskeleton . Owing to the crystalline structure of silicon , it can be easily etched at certain plane directions , enabling mas - sive production of the probes . The drawback is that the sharp edges may damage the fragile cell membrane or nuclear membrane ; therefore , it is not recommended for indentation of living cells . 2 . 2 . 4 . Conical tip Similar to the pyramid tip , the conical tip ( figure 5 ) yields a much smaller contact area compared with the spherical and flat punch tip . Compared with the pyramid tip , it is less likely to cause damage in lateral directions because it does not have sharp edges . It also circumvents complicated data interpretation owing to coupling of anisotropic soft materials and orientation of the pyramid tip . In principle , the semi - included angle of the probe will not affect the measured elastic or plastic properties , if the appropriate models are used . But it affects the relationship between the yield strength and hardness . At a given penetration , the deformation - affected volume is related to the semi - included angle of the probe [ 42 , 43 ] . Therefore , to eliminate the effect of the substrate or the surrounding matrix , one may need to choose a tip with smaller semi - included angle although the increased stress intensity underneath the very sharp tip might cause puncture of the cell membrane . The tip radius also contributes to the effective deformation zone as discussed in [ 42 , 44 ] . But this influence is not that significant if the tip radius is much smaller than the penetration . When using this probe to do indentation at shallow penetration , it would only sense loca - lized properties mainly resulting from the cell membrane with the underlying cortex or individual cytoskeleton . Some - times , it may simply measure the bending stiffness of the cell membrane . In such a case , it is unlikely to obtain the mech - anical properties of the whole cell . For similar geometries such as a cone ( a cylindrical punch can be treated as cone with a semi - apical angle of 90 8 ) and a pyramid , the effective strain is a constant and related to the semi - apical angle ( u ) [ 41 ] . 2 . 2 . 5 . Extended atomic force microscope testing rigs In recent years , another type of indentation , cytocompression [ 45 , 46 ] , has been widely used to assess the mechanical pro - perties of single cells . In principle , this is an extended AFM indentation on top of cytoindentation . The primary difference in the deformation mechanisms for cytoindentation and cyto - compression is in the relative size between the flat punch and the cell . The former has a flat punch diameter well below that of cell . The latter ( figure 6 ) has a flat punch diameter exceeding that of the cell . In such a case , data interpretation is the same as in normal compression tests . The indenter ( i . e . the flat plate ) is often made of glass , which enables in situ observation of cell deformation [ 20 , 47 ] . 2 . 2 . 6 . Summary Tables 1 and 2 summarize the effective contact radius , effec - tive contact stress and representative strain for various tip geometries . Where , d c is the contact depth . Table 3 summarizes brief guidelines of recommended tip geometries of cells with varied morphologies . 3 . Mechanical modelling Estimation of cell mechanics requires the use of analytical models ( or empirical models ) of which there are two princi - pal types , namely structure - based models and continuum models . The former include tensegrity [ 48 , 49 ] and percolation models [ 50 ] , which consider cell mechanics to be dominant by the collective discrete loading bearing element . The latter include linear elastic [ 51 – 53 ] , hyperelastic [ 54 – 56 ] , por - oelastic ( also known as biphasic model ) [ 57 ] and viscoelastic models [ 8 , 58 ] . The continuum model may be interpreted as load - bearing elements that are infinitesimally small relative to the size of the cell . 3 . 1 . Structure - based models 3 . 1 . 1 . Tensegrity model The tensegrity model is based on the use of isolated components under compression inside a net of continuous tension , in such a way that the compressed members ( usually bars or struts ) do Table 1 .

This model was coined by Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s . Such a concept was then introduced by Ingber [ 48 ] to cell mechanics . It assumes that a cell stabilizes its structure by incorporating compression - resistant elements to resist the global pull of the contractile cytoskeleton [ 48 ] . This simple stick and string tensegrity model predicts that a cell appears round when unattached ( owing to the internal ten - sion ) or attached with a very soft substrate , and spreads out when attached to a stiff substrate . All these agree well with experimental observations [ 48 , 61 ] . 3 . 1 . 2 . Percolation models The percolation theory describes the behaviour of connected clusters in a random manner . It was introduced in Table 2 .

Recently , such a theory was introduced to describe the cell structure and its mechanics [ 50 ] . The percolation cluster shown in figure 8 contains substructures of tensegrity on a small scale . These tensegrity substructures are likely to con - tribute to inherent tension in the cytoskeleton . Owing to the random nature of their interconnection , percolation networks are so flexible that they can easily adapt to the dynamic conditions that affect cells [ 50 ] . 3 . 1 . 3 . Summary of structure - based models The percolation and tensegrity models of the cytoskele - ton are not mutually exclusive , but complementary . As commented in [ 50 ] , it is possible that during evolution certain locally ordered tensegrity - type structures may have emerged from more randomly interconnected percolation structures . These structure - based models are very successful at explaining a range of physical observations on cell mech - anics such as cell spreading [ 62 ] , cell migration [ 63 ] , cell detachment [ 64 ] and mechanosensation [ 65 ] , etc . But it is difficult to quantify the mechanical properties of living cells or subcellular structures . 3 . 2 . Continuum models Despite neglecting microstructural features , continuum models enable quantifying the mechanical properties of cells under various conditions that could provide essential information of cellular subpopulations [ 25 ] , disease [ 18 ] , malignant transform - ation and cell – materials interactions [ 2 ] . However , it is worth pointing out that there is no universal mechanical model avail - able to quantify the mechanical properties of living cells at various physiological and microenvironmental conditions , because living cells can dynamically adapt to their environ - ment . The feasible methodology is to choose appropriate models according to testing conditions ( or microenvironment ) for a given cell type . Therefore , this paper will focus on the dis - cussion of the feasibilities of various continuum models at given test conditions . 3 . 2 . 1 . Elastic model If the tests were performed slowly such that the cell reaches equilibrium , then it is reasonable to use elastic models . At relatively small deformation , a simple linear elastic model may be used to find the Young modulus of the cell ( E ) . Evi - dence has been shown that this simple elastic model can still reveal useful insights of cell mechanics such as the stiffness ratio of the nucleus over the cytoplasm [ 51 ] . If the cell undergoes large deformation , then it may reach the nonlinear elastic region . The neo - Hookean ( NH ) model , also known as the Gaussian model , is one of the most widely used nonlinear elastic ( or hyperelastic ) models owing to its simplicity . For example , it has been successfully used to model the deformation of single cells in cytocompres - sion tests [ 66 ] . For incompressible materials , the NH model has the following energy function [ 67 ] W ¼ C 1 ð l 21 þ l 22 þ l 23 (cid:2) 3 Þ ; ð 3 : 1 Þ where W is the strain energy density , l j ( j ¼ 1 , 2 , 3 ) are the three principal stretch ratios . The Young modulus E is given by E ¼ 6 C 1 : ð 3 : 2 Þ Other more sophisticated hyperealstic models have also been developed , such as the polynominal and Ogden models . The strain energy function for the former is given by the flowing equation [ 68 ] : W ¼ X N i þ j ¼ 1 C ij ð l 21 þ l 22 þ l 23 (cid:2) 3 Þ i 1 l 21 þ 1 l 22 þ 1 l 23 (cid:2) 3 ! j : ð 3 : 3 Þ The Young modulus E is given by E ¼ 6 ð C 10 þ C 01 Þ : ð 3 : 4 Þ The Ogden model can describe a wide range of strain - hardening characteristics , and it takes the following form as described in previous studies [ 67 – 69 ] : W ¼ X n i ¼ 1 2 m i a 2 i ð l a i 1 þ l a i 2 þ l a i 3 (cid:2) 3 Þ ; ð 3 : 5 Þ where a i is strain - hardening ( or stiffening ) exponent . The constants m i are related to the initial Young modulus E , by E ¼ 3 X n i ¼ 1 m i : ð 3 : 6 Þ x y z Figure 7 . A schematic tensegrity model of cell structure for a spherical cell [ 60 ] .

Poroelastic model The poroelastic model attributes the time - dependence to the flow of a fluid through an elastic ( or viscoelastic ) porous solid . Such a model was first proposed by Biot [ 70 ] and was based on the assumptions of linearity between the stress ( s ij , p ) and the strain ( e ij , r ) and reversibility of the deformation process . With the respective addition of the scalar quantities p and r to the stress and strain group , the linear constitutive relations can be obtained by extending the known elastic expressions . The most general form for iso - tropic material constitutive behaviour response is described as follows [ 70 ] : 1 ij ¼ s ij 2 G (cid:2) 1 6 G (cid:2) 1 9 K (cid:3) (cid:4) d ij s kk þ d ij p 3 H ð 3 : 7 Þ and r ¼ s kk 3 H þ p M ; ð 3 : 8 Þ where K and G are bulk and shear modulus of the drained elastic solid . The parameters H and M characterize the coupling between solid and fluid stress and strain . This model was originally developed for soil mechanics and it was then applied to describe the mechanics of hydro - gels [ 71 ] and tissues such as bone [ 72 ] and cartilage [ 73 ] . Very recently , it has also been applied to cell mechanics [ 24 ] . When it comes down to cell mechanics , the material properties of interest include the shear modulus G ( or aggregate modulus H A ) , and Poisson’s ratio of the solid matrix and Darcy per - meability k . The permeability could be analogous to the diffusion coefficient , but driven by the mechanical gradient instead of the chemical gradient . During stress relaxation , it gives [ 74 ] P ð t Þ (cid:2) P ð 1 Þ P ð 0 Þ (cid:2) P ð 1 Þ ¼ g ð t Þ ; ð 3 : 9 Þ where P ( 1 ) and P ( 0 ) signify the force at infinite time ( t ¼ 1 ) and t ¼ 0 , respectively . Where the normalized time t is given by t ¼ Dt a 2 ; ð 3 : 10 Þ where a is the contact radius and t is time . The diffusivity D is given by D ¼ 2 ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ 1 (cid:2) 2 v Gk h ; ð 3 : 11 Þ where v , G , k and h are Poisson’s ratio , shear modulus and permeability of the solid matrix and viscosity of the solvent , respectively . The equilibrium Young modulus E is given by E ¼ 2 G ð 1 þ v Þ : ð 3 : 12 Þ The relation between the aggregate modulus and the Young modulus is given by H A ¼ E ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ ð 1 þ v Þð 1 (cid:2) 2 v Þ : ð 3 : 13 Þ This poroelastic model is quite similar to the biphasic theory of the mixture of an incompressible solid and incompressible fluid which was independently developed by Mow et al . [ 75 ] and Bowen [ 76 ] . In addition , by replacing the elastic media with viscoelastic media to account for the intrinsic viscoelastic properties of the actin filaments , a more complex model ( poro - viscoelastic ) [ 77 ] can be used to describe soft tissue or cell mechanics . When the cell is exposed to an ionic solution , the ionic charge also contributes to the mechanical responses of cells . In such a case , a third phase ( i . e . the ionic phase ) can be included in the constitutive equation , which is called the triphasic model [ 78 ] . 3 . 2 . 3 . Spring - dashpot viscoelastic models The basic premise of viscoelasticity of this type is that it replaces some elastic springs with a time - dependent dashpot as shown in figure 9 . These spring - dashpot models usually refer to viscoelastic models . In a general manner , the empiri - cal Prony series [ 79 ] has been used to describe the material’s time - dependent constitutive response in the experimental time domain . For stress relaxation , the relaxation shear modulus G ( t ) in an empirical Prony series is given by G ð t Þ ¼ G 1 þ X G i exp (cid:2) t t i (cid:3) (cid:4) ; ð 3 : 14 Þ where G 1 is the equilibrium shear modulus and the instan - taneous shear modulus G 0 ¼ G 1 þ P G i or creep , the creep compliance J ( t ) in an empirical Prony series is given by J ( t ) ¼ C 0 (cid:2) X C i exp (cid:2) t t i (cid:3) (cid:4) ; ð 3 : 15 Þ where the parameters C i are associated with compliance values ( inverse shear modulus ) . The stress relaxation modulus and the creep compliance are not explicitly inverse in the time domain but are in the Laplace domain ( i . e . G ð s Þ J ð s Þ ¼ s 2 ) . The equilibrium shear modulus ( G 1 ) and the instan - taneous shear modulus ( G 0 ) can be determined by the following equations : G 1 ¼ 1 C 0 ð 3 : 16 Þ Figure 9 .

Power - law rheology Power - law rheology ( G ð t Þ (cid:3) t (cid:2) n , where n is a positive con - stant ) has also been adopted to describe the mechanics of certain cells . For example , it is found that n ¼ 0 . 2 for lung epi - thelial cells during stress relaxation [ 80 ] . The physical basis of this power law may be related to molecular adjustment of the cytoskeleton matrix , which is similar to soft glassy materials close to the glass transition [ 80 ] . Such a model may work better for those cells that do not have a strong cytoskeleton structure . For example , such a power - law rheology model has also been applied to neutrophils and macrophages [ 81 ] . 3 . 2 . 5 . Summary The advantage of the elastic models is that they eliminate the number of elastic parameters , which are easy for empiri - cal curve fitting and numerical simulations . It was argued that poroelastic models provide physical constants related to the material microstructure , compared with the empiri - cal spring - dashpot viscoelastic models . However , it must be pointed out that poroelastic models homogenize the whole structure and may not be able to predict structure reorganiz - ation of the cell during external stimuli ( e . g . cell migration and cell spreading ) compared with those structure - based models ( e . g . tensegrity model ) . Therefore , one should also treat structure - based models and the continuum models as complementary to each other . 4 . Nanoindentation models As mentioned earlier , only the nanoindentation models ( con - tinuum based ) for the tips ( i . e . flat punch , spherical and conical tip ) suitable for testing living cells will be discussed in detail . Once the AFM deflection – displacement curves are converted to force – displacement curves , indentation theories would be applicable . The models below are based on assumptions of small deformation and negligible tip – cell adhesions . More detailed discussion is provided in § 5 , when these assumptions are invalid . 4 . 1 .

Spherical tip : the force – displacement relation is given by the Hertz elastic model [ 83 ] P ¼ 8 3 G 1 (cid:2) v ﬃﬃﬃﬃ R p d 3 = 2 ; ð 4 : 2 Þ where R are the radius of the spherical indenter . Conical tip : the force – displacement relation is given by [ 84 ] P ¼ 4 G tan u p ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ d 2 ; ð 4 : 3 Þ where u is the semi - included angle of the conical indenter . 4 . 2 .

A simpler poroelastic model to describe cell mechanics has been presented in [ 85 , 86 ] , which considers fluid propagates through a cell owing to a local pressure increase in a two - dimensional manner . This model requires other techniques to determine the pore size and viscosity , rather than relying on the analysis of the force – time – displacement curve alone . For pore size , it can be estimated by hindered tracer particle diffu - sion experiments , and for viscosity it can be estimated by a nanoparticle diffusion experiment [ 85 , 86 ] . 4 . 3 . Viscoelastic - nanoindentation models When viscoelastic models were adopted , experimentalists used either the stress relaxation ( for tests performed under displace - ment control ) orcreep ( for tests performed under force control ) period to determine viscoelastic parameters . It is advantageous to use stress relaxation or creep for data analysis because they circumvent the possible complexity in nonlinear changes during ramping . Flat punch : the following force – time andthe displacement – time relations can be obtained by incorporating the viscoelastic model into equation ( 3 . 16 ) Stress relaxation : P ð t Þ ¼ 4 R 3 ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ ð t 0 G ð t (cid:2) t Þ d ð t Þ d d ð t Þ d t d t ; ð 4 : 10 Þ and Creep : d ð t Þ ¼ 3 ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ 4 R ð t 0 J ð t (cid:2) t Þ d P ð t Þ d t d t : ð 4 : 11 Þ More rigorous analytical solutions were given by [ 87 ] , which consider that the elastic components may have different Poisson’s ratios . r s f s . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g I n t e r f a c e F o c u s 4 : 20130055 7 Spherical tip : the force – time and the displacement – time relations are given by [ 88 , 89 ] Stress relaxation : P ð t Þ ¼ 8 ﬃﬃﬃﬃ R p 3 ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ ð t 0 G ð t (cid:2) t Þ d d 3 = 2 ð t Þ d t d t ; ð 4 : 12 Þ and Creep : d 3 = 2 ð t Þ ¼ 3 ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ 8 ﬃﬃﬃﬃ R p ð t 0 J ð t (cid:2) t Þ d P ð t Þ d t d t : ð 4 : 13 Þ Conical tip : the force – time and the displacement – time relations are given by [ 90 ] Stress relaxation : P ð t Þ ¼ 4tan u p ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ ð t 0 G ð t (cid:2) t Þ d ð t Þ d d ð t Þ d t d t ; ð 4 : 14 Þ and Creep : d 2 ð t Þ ¼ p ð 1 (cid:2) v Þ 4tan u ð t 0 J ð t (cid:2) t Þ d P ð t Þ d t d t : ð 4 : 15 Þ For complicated load – time or displacement – time histo - ries , Boltzmann hereditary integrals can be used to find full P – d – t profiles [ 58 , 91 ] . 5 . Discussion It must be pointed out that most researchers compared measured cell mechanical properties across published results without analysing the experimental techniques related to con - trolling factors on cell mechanics . These factors include tip geometry , indentation penetration , cell morphology , cell type and mechanical models . Therefore , it is essential to discuss howthesefactorsaffectthemeasuredcellmechanicalproperties . 5 . 1 . Cell mechanics determined by different models Depending on the models to be adopted , it may affect the values of determined mechanical properties of cells . Table 4 summarizes the elastic properties of bovine articular chon - drocytes determined by the biphasic and spring - dashpot viscoelastic models . It can be seen that these two models give similar results . However , the cell actually experiences large deformation , which was not considered in both models . Although many researchers adopted viscoelastic models to describe the time - dependent behaviour of cell mechanics [ 8 , 25 , 26 , 92 ] , other researchers found that poroelastic models are more appropriate in their experimental test protocols [ 86 , 93 ] . However , it has been shown that neither the poroelastic model nor the viscoelastic model is capable of capturing the complete mechanical responses of cells during creep or stress relaxation [ 94 , 95 ] . A recent paper published in Nature Materials [ 95 ] has demonstrated that the poroelastic model captures the time - dependent mechanics of cells at a short - time scale ( less than 0 . 5 s ) , but the viscoelastic model appears to work better at a long - time scale [ 95 ] . This may suggest that , at a short - time scale , it is fluid diffusion that governsthe time - dependent behav - iour of cells . At a long - time scale , it is likely that the collective viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer - like materials inside cell and cytoskeleton dynamics governs the time - dependent behaviour of the cell . Therefore , a further improved model , poro - viscoelastic model presented in [ 77 , 96 – 98 ] may be more appropriate . If the cell is exposed to an osmotic environment , then it passively swells or shrinks . The poroelastic ( biphasic ) model is limited to describe the effective materials parameters that vary with extracellular osmolality [ 99 ] . The triphasic model [ 78 ] has the capability to better describe the mechano - chemical coupling by introducing both mechanical and chemical parameters in the governing equations , which could betterdescribethemechanochemicalequilibriumofthecells [ 99 ] . It must be pointed out that , in the poroelastic ( biphasic ) model and triphasic model , small deformation and incompres - sible solid matrix are assumed . In a real test or physiological loading , cells may experience large deformation . In addition , the solid matrix in cells may not be incompressible . It would be very complex to include all these in the constitutive equa - tions of poroelastic models and triphasic models . However , for viscoelastic models , it is straightforward to account for the large deformation and compressibility of the solids via the hyperviscoelastic model . The above - mentioned models deal with static loading . Indeed , oscillatory measurement associated with the AFM can be used to determine the viscoelastic properties of the living cell . More details can be found in [ 37 , 100 ] . 5 . 2 . Cell mechanics determined by different indenters As discussed in § 2 , at a given force , the effective deformation zone varies significantly with tip geometry . Consequently , this can affect the measured mechanical properties of cells . In general , when using a pyramid tip with low penetration , the results are more likely to be affected by spatial heterogen - eity , as observed in [ 101 ] . Table 5 summarizes the comparison of elastic moduli ( determined by elastic contact model ) for osteoblastic cells ( spread morphology ) measured by a pyra - midal and spherical tip . It has been shown that elastic moduli measured by a pyramidal tip are about four times higher compared with those measured by a spherical tip . When using a sharp conical or pyramid tip for spreading cells , it senses the region near an actin filament , as observed by Hoh et al . [ 104 ] . In such a case , the probed elastic response Table 4 .

Table 6 summarizes the comparison of elastic moduli ( determined by the elastic contact model ) for lung epithelial cells measured by a pyramidal and a flat punch tip . In this test , large penetration of 3 m m was applied via a pyramid tip , and the indentations were not far from the nucleus . In that case , it probes the overall cell mechanics . That is why it yields a similar result to that determined by a flat punch tip . However , it should be pointed out that the thin - layer effect was not considered in the original paper . Table 7 summarizes the comparison of viscoelastic properties for a single bovine chondrocyte using cytoindentation and cytocompression . The indenter diameter for cytoindentation is 5 m m [ 106 ] , which is almost half of the cell diameter . The penetration for cytoinden - tation is similar to the cell radius ; therefore , it is expected that it senses the properties of the whole cell instead of local cellular properties . In such a case , it would be expected that the elastic properties determined by cytoindentation are similar to those by cytocompression . As shown in table 7 , the equilibrium moduli and viscosity determined by these two indenters are quite similar . However , the instantaneous modulus determined by cytoindentationisover threetimes higher than cytocompres - sion . This may suggest that indenter size might affect the instantaneous mechanical responses of cells . 5 . 3 . Cell morphology on cell mechanics As cells are living materials , they respond to mechanical , physical and chemical stimuli . Cells will change their morphology after being removed from their native environ - ment . Depending on the physical properties or surface chemistry of the substrate that they are seeded on , cells may spread along the substrate or retain a spherical shape . Figure 10 displays a typical example that shows the substrate stiffness regulates the shape of fibroblasts . Table 8 summarizes the mechanical properties of the different cell types and the change in their morphology . In that case , a borosilicate glass sphere ( 5 m m diameter ) probe was used for the AFM nanoindentation [ 107 ] . For all the above - presented models , they assume a sample with infinite thickness and width compared with indentation depth . When probing the spreading cells , if the indentation size is comparable to the local thickness , then it invalidates these assumptions . Therefore , the estimation of cell mechanical properties will be affected by the stiffness of the underlying substrate . In such a case , the thin - layer model proposed by Darling et al . [ 108 ] could be applicable . This model introduces a geometry factor to describe the force – displacement relation . For example , for a spherical tip , the original elastic model can be modified as follows : P ¼ 4 3 E 1 (cid:2) v 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃ R p d 3 = 2 f 1 ð x Þ ; ð 5 : 1 Þ where f 1 ( x ) is geometrical correction factor which is given by f 1 ð x Þ ¼ (cid:5) 1 (cid:2) 2 a 0 p x þ 4 a 20 p 2 x 2 (cid:2) 4 a 20 p 2 a 30 þ 4 p 2 15 b 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) x 3 þ 16 a 0 p 4 a 30 þ 3 p 2 5 b 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) x 4 (cid:6) ; ð 5 : 2 Þ and x ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ R d p h ; ð 5 : 3 Þ where h is the cell thickness , a 0 ¼ (cid:2) 1 : 2867 (cid:2) 1 : 4678 v þ 1 : 3442 v 2 1 (cid:2) v ð 5 : 4 Þ and b 0 ¼ 0 : 6387 (cid:2) 1 : 0277 v þ 1 : 5164 v 2 1 (cid:2) v : ð 5 : 5 Þ This geometry factor f 1 ( x ) can be easily incorporated into the above - mentioned viscoelastic models . For the thin - layer - based poroelastic model , empirical cor - rection parameters can be obtained based on finite - element simulation [ 109 ] . For example , the following empirical Table 6 .

For example , it was found that when indenta - tion was made at a thin region relatively near the edge of the fibroblast , the adhered thin - layer model is more appropriate [ 37 ] . Although when indenting a thin region further from the edge of the fibroblast , the non - adhered thin - layer model may be more suitable [ 37 ] . One needs to be aware that all these thin - layer modelsare valid forcells withapproximatelyuniform thickness ( i . e . well - spread ) . Otherwise , computational models are required , which will be discussed in § 5 . 7 . To minimize the thin - layereffect , atipwith a smallerhalf - angle ispreferred [ 113 ] . When indenting a specimen with finite thickness and finite width , there is complex coupling between the stiffening effect , caused by the underlying substrate , and the softening effect , caused by a free edge in the lateral direction . A typical example is to use a spherical tip indenting into a spherical cell at a large deformation . Thus , another model has been presented to deal with this coupling effect [ 58 ] . The following empirical geometry factor f 2 ( x ) can then be used [ 58 ] : f 2 ð x Þ ¼ 1 þ ax ; ð 5 : 9 Þ and a ¼ 0 : 66 þ 0 : 917 (cid:4) v (cid:2) 2 : 479 (cid:4) v 2 : ð 5 : 10 Þ This geometrical factor can be incorporated into the visco - elastic models [ 58 ] , and it has been successfully applied to extract viscoelastic properties of spherical chondrocytes adherent to a glass plate . 5 . 4 . A special case : cell trapped inside a well Microfabricated well arrays have been proposed to trap cells before nanoindentation [ 113 – 115 ] . This would enable auto - matic indentation for high - throughput screening methods that may prove useful for cells sorting . All the existing contact mechanics - based models only deal with indented materials placed on a flat surface ( i . e . the bottom surface is constrained vertically ) , free from lateral constraint . Little work has been carried out for indented materials placed within a well ( figure 11 ) ; in that case , the assumptions in the classic Hertz model and thin - layer models have been violated . This problem has recently been dealt with by Chen [ 116 ] . Interestingly , it introduces a similar correction parameter to f 2 ( x ) . 5 . 5 . Substrate modulation The substrate physics may affect the cell mechanical proper - ties , even if the cell maintains the same morphology . Table 9 summarizes the comparison of elastic moduli ( deter - mined by the elastic contact model ) for the same murine NIH3T3 fibrobalst cell line ( spread morphology ) cultured on different substrates indented by a spherical tip . Table 10 Table 8 .

In both cases , it is evident that the substrates can significantly regulate cell mechanical properties even if the cell shape is retained . Similar behaviour of the matrix modulating cell mech - anics was also found in a three - dimensional scaffold . For example , when a bovine chondrocyte cell line were seeded in different scaffolds , they maintained a spherical morpho - logy , but different mechanical properties with regard to the three - dimensional scaffold [ 2 ] . 5 . 6 . Cell – tip adhesion Some degree of tip – cell adhesion may be unavoidable in nanoindentation . This would be affected by the composition and surface chemistry of the tip . There are different models that incorporate tip – sample adhesion , such as the Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ( JKR ) [ 118 ] , Derjaguin – Muller – Toporov [ 119 ] and Maugis – Dugdale [ 120 ] models . Among which , the JKR model is appropriate for the indentation of relatively compliant materials with probes of relatively large radii and strong adhesive forces . This would be preferred to compliant materials such as cells , in particular for a spherical indenter in contact with spherical cells [ 121 ] . During unloading , one may observe the negative force resulting from the surface adhesion , as shown in figure 12 . Such a pull - out force is related to the surface energy ( g ) at the cell – tip interface and is given by [ 83 ] P pull ¼ (cid:2) 3 2 p R g : ð 5 : 11 Þ In such a case , one needs to replace the force ( P ) in all the equations above by P þ P pull . More detailed discussions about the adhesive contact during AFM indentation has been summarized by Lin & Horkay [ 122 ] . 5 . 7 . Inverse finite - element analysis All the previous mechanical models work properly when the irregularity of cell shape is negligible . For example , when indenting a spread cell ( with non - uniform thickness ) with a conical tip at small depth , the effective - deformed region is mainly confined within the dotted region , as shown in figure 13 . In that case , the cell can be assumed a regular shape with a single radius , so that the previous models in § 4 are applicable . However , at greater penetration , the effec - tive deformation zone spreads out , and the irregularity of cell shape becomes important . In that case , one should treat the previous thin - layer model with caution , because the non - uni - form thickness and the change of curvature becomes important . Therefore , three - dimensional finite - element analy - sis ( FEA ) with the true cell shape is necessary . Figure 14 displays a flowchart of inverse FEA to determine the mechan - ical properties of cells during nanoindentation . In that case , the three - dimensional model a of cell and its nucleus model can be reconstructed from the sliced images obtained by confocal microscopy [ 123 ] . In addition , in order to obtain the mechanical properties of a subcellular structure of living cells without mechanical or chemically separating them from living cells , FEA is also essential . For example , finite - element simulations have been used to do inverse analysis to obtain the mechanical proper - ties of cytoplasm [ 2 , 51 , 54 ] , nucleus elastic properties [ 2 , 51 , 54 ] or the pericellular matrix [ 114 ] . As living materials , the exter - nal force may trigger passive stress generation in the cell . FEA can be used to investigate how the passive stress may affect the elastic modulus by treating it as residual stress [ 124 ] . 5 . 8 . Summary of strategy of selecting tip geometry and mechanical models Prior to discussing the strategy to select tip geometry and size , it is good to recall the cellular structure . A eukaryotic cell ( excluding the red blood cell ) is composed of cell mem - brane , cytoplasm ( including cytosol , cytoskeleton and other suspended organelles ) and nucleus ( including nucleus mem - brane , nucleoplasm , a structure layer nuclear lamina , nucleus and other suspended organelles ) . In this paper , we discuss the design indentation protocols and the associated indenta - tion models with regard to the cell morphology , because cell morphology will affect the boundary conditions of the inden - tation models . In addition , cell morphology can be regulated by the substrate as shown in figure 10 . Cell type is also important , and we will generally classify the cell as a cell with a strong cytoskeleton ( such as osteoblast , chondrocyte and muscle cells ) , medium strong cytoskeleton ( such as fibro - blast cell , epithelial cell and endothelial cell ) and weak cytoskeleton ( such as fat cell , neutrophils , blebbing cell and mesenchymal stem cell ) . If one is interested in the mechanics of the cell membrane ( with thickness of approx . 7 nm ) , then a very small indenta - tion ( blow 1 nm ) should be made with a conical or pyramid tip with a small semi - included angle . This is due to the fact that the tip with a smaller semi - included angle could restrict the effective deformation zone . A simple mechanical model such as an elastic model is acceptable . If one is interested in the mechanics of cytoplasm , a small indentation , less than 10 % of the vertical distance from the P loading unloading d Figure 12 . Schematic of force – displacement curve for a typical adhesive indentation . ( Online version in colour . ) Figure 13 . Schematic of indenting a spread cell ( with non - uniform thickness ) with a conical tip at small depth ; in that case , the cell can be assumed as regular shape . r s f s . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g I n t e r f a c e F o c u s 4 : 20130055 11 nucleus ( i . e . less than 0 . 1 d as shown in figure 15 ) should be made with a conical tip . The suitable penetration depth varies with the semi - included angle . Alternatively , one can locate the indentation near the edge , away from the nucleus . The poroelastic model is more appropriate . It is also rec - ommended to use a cone with a big angle to prevent high strain - induced nonlinear elasticity . For a typical commercial AFM probe , the tip radius is 4 – 10 nm . One may need to use the modified models for a blunt cone or truncated pyra - mid as discussed by Lin & Horkay [ 122 ] , when penetration is comparable to the tip radius . If one is interested in the mechanics of the whole cell ( mixed responses of cytoplasm and nucleus ) , then a bigger indentation ( more than 0 . 1 d ) should be made with a flat punch or a spherical tip . For a well - spread cell ( i . e . thickness is small ) , a conical tip with a big semi - apical angle is appro - priate . In this case , poroelastic , viscoelastic and more complex poro - viscoelastic models are appropriate for the cells with a strong or medium strong cytoskeleton . If the cell undergoes large deformation , then the hyperviscoelastic model is more appropriate [ 66 ] , particularly for cells with a strong cytoske - leton . The power - law rheology model may be more suitable for cells with a weak cytoskeleton . The guidelines about the relative penetration above are a rough estimation based on a coating / substrate system [ 44 ] ; some dedicated computational modelling is required to further reveal this rule of thumb to better guide the experimentalists to design test protocols . If cells are exposed to osmotic pressure , then the poroelas - tic model ( or poro - viscoelastic models ) should be used . If the ionic charge is important , then a triphasic model is more appropriate [ 78 , 125 ] . If penetration is comparable to the cell thickness ( typically for a spread cell ) , then a thin - layer model in combination with a viscoelastic / poroelastic model should be used . When the contact radius is comparable to cell width and thickness , the model proposed by Chen & Lu [ 58 ] should be used to account for coupling of the free edge effect and the thin - layer effect . 6 . Conclusion and perspectives The exploration of nanobiomechanics of living cells helps us to understand a range of processes such as disease progression and cell – materials interactions . This provides essential information for cellular therapy and tissue engineer - ing . A range of mechanical models has been discussed . The structural models have the advantage in predicting how cells rearrange their structure ( e . g . cell spreading and cell migration ) according to external stimuli . The continuum models enable quantifying the mechanical properties in cells under various conditions that could provide essential information of cellular subpopulations , disease , malignant transformation and cell – materials interactions . It is almost impossible to get an accurate universal phys - ical model to quantify the mechanical properties of cells during indentation , owing to the complex cell structure and the complicated mechanotransduction mechanisms ( e . g . via cytoskeleton and nuclear lamina ) . Therefore , it is more realis - tic to use the averaged continuum model accompanied by appropriate testing protocols if the overall cell mechanics is of interest . One should also treat structure - based models and the continuum models as complementary to each other . Various factors ( e . g . cell morphology , substrate , tip geometry and relative indentation penetration with regard to cell size ) that affect quantifying the mechanical properties of cells have been evaluated . When researchers compare the measured cell mechanical properties across the literature , they should be aware that interpretation of the results can be significantly affected by the mechanical models adopted at given test conditions . Accordingly , this paper presents strategies to select tip geometries and the associated nanoindentation load – displacement curve estimated mechanical properties deformed cell shape by measurement match three - dimensional reconstruction of cell model finite - element model simulated indentation response deformed cell shape by simulation m a t c h Figure 14 .

When the irregu - lar shape of a cell plays an important role in cell mechanics , it violates the boundary conditions of all the analytical and semi - analytical mechanical models . In that case , FEA incorporating the true cell shape is essential . The way that cells sense and respond to the substrate is expected to be temporal in nature [ 126 ] . In addition , passive stresses may be generated in the cell during indentation . There - fore , the outlook for modelling cell mechanics should be to incorporate these dynamic effects to the mechanical modelling and FEA . Acknowledgements .
