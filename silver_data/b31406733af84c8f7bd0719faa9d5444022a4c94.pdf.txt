ARTICLES The nature of the globular - to fibrous - actin transition Toshiro Oda 1 , 2 , Mitsusada Iwasa 2 , Tomoki Aihara 1 , Yuichiro Mae´da 2 , 3 & Akihiro Narita 3 Actin plays crucial parts in cell motility through a dynamic process driven by polymerization and depolymerization , that is , the globular ( G ) to fibrous ( F ) actin transition . Although our knowledge about the actin - based cellular functions and the molecules that regulate the G - to F - actin transition is growing , the structural aspects of the transition remain enigmatic . We created a model of F - actin using X - ray fibre diffraction intensities obtained from well oriented sols of rabbit skeletal muscle F - actin to 3 . 3A˚ in the radial direction and 5 . 6 A˚ along the equator . Here we show that the G - to F - actin conformational transition is a simple relative rotation of the two major domains by about 20 degrees . As a result of the domain rotation , the actin molecule in the filament is flat . The flat form is essential for the formation of stable , helical F - actin . Our F - actin structure model provides the basis for understanding actin polymerization as well as its molecular interactions with actin - binding proteins . Actin was discovered in muscle tissue by Straub in 1942 ( ref . 1 ) . The fibrous ( F ) form of actin is a major component of the thin filament in allmuscletissues . Sincethen , actinhasbeen foundin many eukaryotic cells to be the most abundant cytoskeleton protein , and it performs a broadrangeofimportantcellularfunctionsincellmotilityaswellasinlocatingandtransportingproteincomplexesinthecell . Actin plays these parts through the dynamic assembly and disassembly of struc - tures such as lamellipodia and filopodia , in a process referred to as actin dynamics 2 , 3 . Actin exists in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric G - actin and polymerized F - actin 4 . Actin strongly binds one adenosine nucleotide , and the polymerization involved in the G - to F - actin transition activates the ATPase . The ATPase activity drives actin filament treadmilling 5 , in which polymerization at one end and depolymerization at the other occur at the same time . Treadmilling is regulated by actin regulatory proteins , which mediate the actin dynamics . In 1990 the first crystal structure of G - actin was solved 6 ; the F - actin atomic model wasalso proposed in a back - to - back paper 7 . The model has been widely accepted as an approximate low - resolution struc - ture . However , the conformational changes that occur at the G - to F - actin transition and the accompanying activation of the ATPase have remained elusive . A high - resolution structure is required to understand the detailed interactions between the subunits in the filament and the interactions between F - actin and actin - binding proteins . Here we describe a new high - resolution model for the F - actin structure , based on X - ray fibre diffraction data to 3 . 3 A˚ in the radial direction and 5 . 6 A˚ along the equator , in contrast to the previous atomic models , which were based on fibre diffraction patterns with low resolution to about 8 A˚ 7 – 12 . Our model shows that the essential difference between G - actin and F - actin is the relative rotation of the two major domains by about 20 u , which gives the F - actin subunit a flat conformation . A second difference is the con - formation of the DNase - I binding loop ( D - loop ) in subdomain 2 , which adopts an open loop conformation . There are no other large - scale differences . The flat conformation is also observed in the polymer of the bacterial MreB actin homologue 13 , and thus it seems to be a common characteristic of polymers among actin homologues . The G - to F - actin structural transition can account for a number of previous results about the consequences of modifications and muta - tions of residues 14 , 15 as well as the binding of small molecules 16 , 17 on polymerization . This model also provides a basis for understanding the structural stability of F - actin . Modelling of F - actin Our model of the F - actin structure is based on X - ray fibre diffraction analyses . An X - ray fibre diffraction pattern is essentially a section through the cylindrically averaged diffraction pattern from a single fibrous molecule . By analysing the diffraction , the structure can be deduced in favourable cases . In general , this is done by constructing a model and then calculating the expected diffraction pattern ; by com - paring the calculated and observed diffraction patterns , a better model is eventually arrived at . However , cylindrical averaging leads to a significant loss of information . High resolution is essential for an unambiguous answer . To achieve high resolution , we combined several technical advances : we controlled the filament length by add - ing gelsolin , prepared well - oriented sols of F - actin 18 by the use of an 18 tesla superconducting magnet ( actin filaments are diamagnetic ) , and recorded X - ray fibre diffraction patterns to 3 A ˚ at the SPring - 8 beam lines . From the extracted fibre diffraction data to 3 . 3 A˚ in the radial direction and to 5 . 6 A˚ along the equator , we constructed the model of the F - actin structure by altering the crystal structure of G - actin by use of the normal modes of actin and a molecular dynamics simulation , while monitoring the R - factor - non - fit , an equivalent of the free R - factor ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Figure 1 shows that the diffraction pattern calculated from our F - actin model ( left half of the image ) , especially the peak positions , is consistent with the observed pattern ( right ) . Subunit conformation Actin has a nucleotide - binding cleft enclosed by two major domains ( Fig . 2c ) 6 . In almost all actin crystal structures , the cleft is closed and the two major domains are in a propeller - like twist with each other . This is characteristic of the G - actin conformation ( yellow in Fig . 2a , b ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . In our F - actin model , we found a previ - ously unknown flat conformation , in which the cleft remains closed 1 X - ray Structural Analysis Research Team , RIKEN SPring - 8 Center , RIKEN Harima Institute , 1 - 1 - 1 , Kouto , Sayo , Hyogo 679 - 5148 , Japan . 2 ERATO project ‘Actin - filament dynamics’ , Japan Science and Technology Agency ( JST ) , 1 - 1 - 1 , Kouto , Sayo , Hyogo 679 - 5148 , Japan . 3 Structural Biology Research Center and Division of Biological Science , Graduate School of Science , Nagoya University , Furo , Nagoya 464 - 8601 , Japan .

The two conformations are related by a 20 u rotation of the two major domains around the axis passing along the front of subdomain 1 and the side of subdomain 3 , which was identified using the program DYNDOM 19 ( red line in Fig . 2a , b ) . The relative rotation of the two major domains is achieved by rotations of the dihedral angles of residues 141 – 142 and 336 – 337 ( blue in Fig . 2a ) . Another charac - teristic of our F - actin subunit is an extended D - loop , to fit the surface of the upper subunit along the strand ( Fig . 3b ) . A 20 u relative rotation of the two major domains , together with an extension of the helical D - loop of the tetramethylrhodamine - conjugated actin ( TMR – actin ) crystal structure 20 , would basically account for the peak positions in the low - resolution part of the diffraction pattern , which determine the overall shape of the subunit ( R - factor fit of , 0 . 25 ) . Contacts between subunits Figure 3 displays the contacts between the subunits within our F - actin model . Each residue with a C a atom located within 10 A˚ from any other C a of a contacting subunit is highlighted in red , blue or yellow . Each subunit is labelled with a number , n , n 1 1 or n 1 2 , from the barbed - end side of the filament . The intra - strand interface appears to be extensive ( Fig . 3b ) . The projection 283 – 294 of subunit n 1 2 ( red ) is enclosed by residues 61 – 65 , 200 – 208 and 241 – 247 of subunit n ( blue ) , resembling a ball ( red ) in a socket ( blue ) . Additionally , the D - loop 38 – 49 of subunit n ( blue ) is extended towards the hydrophobic groove of subunit n 1 2 ( red ) between subdomains 1 and 3 : Val 43 and Met 44 of subunit n contact Leu 346 and Phe 375 of subunit n 1 2 . The inter - strand contacts are formed by two projections from subdomain 4 ( Fig . 3c ) . One is the carboxy terminus of the a - helix 191 – 199 of subunit n ( blue ) , which contacts the amino terminus of the a - helix 110 – 115 of subunit n 1 1 ( yellow ) in the opposite strand . The other is the hydrophobic plug 265 – 271 in subunit n 1 1 ( yellow ) , which contacts four regions in the opposite strand , including residues 201 – 203 and 39 – 42 in subunit n ( blue ) and residues 170 – 174 and 285 – 286 of subunit n 1 2 ( red ) . The contacts mediated by thehydrophobic plugare three - bodied . Residues 39 – 42 , 201 – 203 and 286 contribute to both the inter - and intra - strand contacts . Bacterial MreB BacterialMreBisastructuralandfunctionalhomologueofactin 13 , 21 , 22 . MreB usually forms thin , non - helical filaments consisting of two protofilaments or bundles of them , and it rarely forms the two - stranded helical polymers seen in F - actin . The MreB crystal contained a straight , single - stranded protofilament , in which the contacts between the subunits were deduced to be biologically relevant 13 . MreB has a closed cleft and the two major domains are untwisted , and thus it resembles the flat conformation of our F - actin subunit ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . The intra - protofilament contacts are also similar to those of our F - actin model : residues 266 – 275 are enclosed by three segments , 227 – 229 , 235 – 238 and 51 – 59 ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) .

The actin - specificinsertions197 – 204and264 – 272contributetotheinter - strand contacts , which are required to generate the two - stranded helical polymers . Comparison of our F - actin model with previous models One important difference between our model and the original Holmes model 7 ( and refinements based on this model , the Lorenz model 8 ) is the filament diameter . The Holmes model was built to fit the published radius of gyration of 25 A˚ , which is actually too big . This caused the two strands in the Holmes model to be too far apart , Figure 1 | Comparison between the observed ( right half ) and calculated ( left half ) diffraction patterns from our model . The area indicated here , within the outermost boundary of 1 / 3 . 3A˚ 2 1 in the radial direction and of 1 / 5 . 6A˚ 2 1 along the equator , was used for the F - actin modelling . The diffraction pattern was calculated by using a disorientation angle of 2 . 9 u , a repeat distance of 9 , 135A˚ and the selection rule l 52 153 n 1 331 m . The diffraction pattern is divided into three parts ( 1 / 60A˚ 2 1 and 1 / 6 . 5A˚ 2 1 , 1 / 6 . 5A˚ 2 1 and 1 / 5 . 5A˚ 2 1 , and 1 / 5 . 5A˚ 2 1 and 1 / 3 . 3A˚ 2 1 ) by the boundaries indicated in black circles , and the scaling was independently performed for each region . The overall similarities between the observed and calculated intensities are satisfactory : R - factor - fit 5 0 . 143 , R - factor - non - fit 5 0 . 207 and R - factor - non - fit ( overall ) 5 0 . 184 .

All rights reserved ©2009 which necessitated rebuilding of the hydrophobic plug to achieve contact . Our model is substantially smaller , and has a radius of gyra - tion of 23 . 7 A˚ . The smaller filament diameter is clearly substantiated by the three - dimensional map independently reconstructed from cryoelectron micrographs at the resolution of 13 . 8 A˚ , which is con - sistent with our model ( Fig . 3d ) . Holmes et al . arrived at a similar conclusion for their actin model , which was built to fit electron micrographs of decorated actin ( the Holmes 2003 model ) 10 . There seems to be little doubt that the F - actin structure has a smaller dia - meter thanin theoriginal Holmes model . Therefore , it isunlikely that the hydrophobic plug largely alters its conformation upon the G - to F - actin transition because of the narrow inter - strand gap . Nevertheless , in our model the position and the shape of the hydro - phobic plug are adjusted within the narrow inter - strand gap , where the plug has major roles as the inter - strand connector . This role is the same as that in the original Holmes model , which is consistent with the results of the actin mutagenesis experiments 23 . Our new model differs from the original Holmes model , and is much closer to the Holmes 2003 model 10 . However , the Holmes 2003 model does not reach the consistency of our model with our independently reconstructed electron micrograph map ( Supple - mentaryFigs4 and 5andSupplementaryVideos1and2 ) . Thesubunit in the Holmes 2003 model is also flat , but it has a slightly different orientation in the filament and defects in the nucleotide - binding site , probably due to the complex shifts and rotations of each of the four subdomains . This is in contrast to our simple rotation of each of the two major domains . An extra shift of the C terminus applied to the Holmes 2003 model worsens the fitting to our electron micrograph map 24 . Discussion The previous crystal structures of actin and actin - related proteins are classified into the closed and open conformations , in which the two major domains are twisted relative to each other , regardless of bound nucleotides 20 , 25 – 27 . The closed and twisted conformation is the struc - ture of actin that cannot polymerize , and the open and twisted con - formation is found with bovine actin - related protein 3 ( Arp3 ) in the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex 26 , 28 . The opening of the cleft affects the binding modes of nucleotides 26 , and thus the closed - to - open con - formational transition is possibly related to nucleotide release . In contrast , the flat conformation of our F - actin subunit constitutes a new class , together with MreB . The flattening seems to be associated with the polymerization and ATPase activity . The close association between the flattening and the polymeriza - tion is supported by the following experimental results . Latrunculin , a toxin isolated from sea sponge , binds to the cleft between the two major domains and inhibits polymerization 17 . The inhibition of polymerization is accounted for by the blocking of the conforma - tional transition due to the toxin binding . In contrast , the nucleotide - free actin polymerizes more readily than the control 29 . The removal of the nucleotide , which connects the two major domains , must facilitate the flattening , thereby promoting the polymerization . When an actin molecule is incorporated into a filament , the actin ATPase is activated 30 . Gln 137 has a crucial role in the ATPase : the replacement of Gln 137 by alanine markedly reduced the ATPase activity , whereas it promoted the polymerization 31 . The G - actin crys - tal structures indicated that Gln 137 anchors a water molecule that attacks the c - phosphate ( c - P ) of the bound ATP , and the extremely slow ATPase of G - actin seems to be a consequence of the geometry ( the long distance and the shifted orientation ) between the water molecule and the c - P 32 . Gln 137 is located in subdomain 1 , whereas ATP tightly binds to subdomains 3 and 4 ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Thus , the domain rotation that is associated with the G - to F - actin transition moves Gln 137 and the c - P closer to each other , thereby probably allowing the bound ATP to be hydrolysed ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In MreB with bound adenylyl imidodiphosphate ( AMPPNP ) , in fact , the c - P is close ( about 4 A˚ ) to the side - chain of the glutamate residue ( Glu 131 ) , at the position equivalent to Gln 137 of actin . However , it should be noted that our F - actin model does not allow us to discuss a more detailed mechanism of the ATPase . This is because the positions of the side chains are not sufficiently accurate ( see also Methods Summary ) and our model does not include water molecules , which are essential for the ATPase . Therefore , we cannot discuss additional mechanisms that may contribute to the ATPase , such as structural changes in the loop 108 – 111 , as observed in E . coli HSP70 homologue Dnak ( ref . 33 ) , and a shift of the c - P through the rearrangement of the two phosphate - binding loops . Moreover , although it seems probable that the flattening of the actin subunit occurs before the ATP hydrolysis , we cannot exclude the possibility that the flattening occurs subsequent to the phosphate release . The flattening of the actin molecule generates changes in the intra - molecular interactions between the two major domains , especially around the two loops that connect them : the ‘sensor loop’ 71 – 73 ( ref . 25 ) and residues 108 – 111 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . First , Arg206 , Glu72 , Arg183 , Asp187 , methylated ( Me ) His73 , Asp179 and Arg177 form a concatenation of salt bridges , which probably contributetostabilizingtheF - actinconformation . Thehighlycharged MeHis73 residue enters the concatenation as a result of the domain rotation , which is probably the cause for MeHis73 ( refs 34 and 35 ) .

All rights reserved ©2009 detach from the spot around Val 163 and Ile175 in the hydrophobic core of subdomain 3 ( Fig . 2d ) . This allows Leu110 to interact with the subunit in the opposite strand at Thr194 , and this subunit – subunit contact also probably stabilizes the flat conformation . How does the flattening of the actin molecule confer the F - actin formation ? A comparison of our F - actin structure with the two - stranded , non - helical straight polymer observed in the crystal of the formin – actin complex 36 provides the answer . In Fig . 4 , the intra - and inter - strand contacts of the straight polymer are compared with those of our F - actin model by placing the light - cyan - coloured sub - units n at the same rotational position about the helix axes . The flattening moves subdomain 4 of the subunit towards the helix axis by about 4 A˚ , whereas subdomains 1 , 2 and 3 are located at about the same radii from the helix axis . As a result , the C terminus of the a - helix ( 182 – 196 , green ) in subdomain 4 of subunit n moves to the vicinity of the N terminus of the a - helix ( 113 – 126 , yellow ) in subdomain 1 of subunit n 1 1 ( Figs 4a , b ) , facilitating the inter - strand connections . Furthermore , the flattening generates extensive intra - strand connections . In the straight polymer , the loop 286 – 289 ( red and yellow balls ) in the subunit n 1 2 is on residues 200 – 202 of subunit n , and does not contact the loop 242 – 246 ( Fig . 4a ) . In con - trast , in F - actin , the loop 286 – 289 ( red and yellow balls ) in subunit n 1 2 is tightly surrounded by three segments , the residues 200 – 208 , the loop 242 – 246 and the residues 61 – 65 of subunit n ( Figs 4b , c ) . Moreover , the shift of the loop 286 – 289 enables the residues 202 – 203 to contact the hydrophobic plug on the opposite strand at Glu 270 of subunit n 1 1 . This region is the node between the intra - strand and inter - strand contacts . Thus , the flat conformation allows more extensive contacts between the subunits than in the straight polymer . As expected , filament formation is impaired by substitutions or modifications of the residues involved in these contacts , including the double mutation P243K / A204E ( ref . 14 ) , the phosphorylation of Thr 201 to Thr 203 ( ref . 37 ) , the mutations I287S and F200S ( T . A . and T . O . , unpublished data ) and the mutations D286R and D288R ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . The double and triple mutations K61A / R62A , E241A / R244A , D286A / D288A and R290A / K291A / E292A are also lethal in yeast 15 . The previous comparison was made between the non - helical poly - mer in the formin – actin complex and our F - actin model . Even if we use computer modelling to twist the non - helical polymer into a helical polymer , by azimuthally rotating the G - actin structure , the inter - strand contacts are not strengthened and would remain unstable . Actually , the intra - strand contacts in the computer model are closer tothose of the single - stranded , twisted polymer observed in the crystal of actin split by protease from E . coli A2 strain ( ECP - actin ) 38 ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . The helical disposition alone generates one - half of the intra - strand contacts around residues 286 – 289 of our F - actin structure , whereas the other half is completed by the additional flattening of the subunits . Thus , stable F - actin is formed by a combination of the flattening of the individual subunits and the helical disposition of the subunits . Nevertheless , the two factors may not necessarily be tightly coupled . According to molecu - lar dynamics simulations , actin favours the closed and twisted con - formation regardless of the bound nucleotide 39 , and thus the flat conformation in isolation must be less stable . Therefore , the F - actin structure may be influenced by the destabilizing force imposed by the strain of the subunit conformation and the stabilizing effect of the contacts between subunits . We speculate that the balance between the two might induce the multiple local conformations of F - actin , which could account for the dynamics of the F - actin struc - ture , as observed for tubulin and FtsZ 21 , 40 , 41 . METHODS SUMMARY Well - oriented sols of F - actin , which were formed by Ca - actin and length - con - trolled by gelsolin , were prepared according to the procedures described prev - iously 18 . From the sols thus obtained , we recorded X - ray fibre diffraction patterns at BL41XU , BL40B2 and BL45XU - SAX at SPring - 8 ( Fig . 1 in Supplementary Methods ) . From the patterns , the layer - line intensities were extractedandusedformodellingoftheF - actinstructureas‘groupingintensities’ re - indexedbythe selectionrule l 52 6 n 1 13 m . Themodellingwas startedfrom a rigid body refinement of three crystal structures that were aligned in a straight polymer , as observed in the formin – actin complexes 36 . The resulting models were further refined using 12 elastic normal - mode motions of the actin mole - cule , the molecular dynamics refinement and the final minimization of the effective energy term with FX - plor 42 . To estimate the restriction of the reflection term imposed on the structure thus obtained , we examined the effects of struc - turalmodificationsonthe R - factor . The R - factorincreasedby5 % whenashiftof two successive residues by 2A˚ was made along the helix axis or a shift of six successive residues by 3A˚ was made in the plane perpendicular to the helix axis fromtheplausiblepositions .
