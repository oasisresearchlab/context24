Pollard * Departments of * Cell Biology and Anatomy and * Chemical Engineering Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 USA ABSTRACT To evaluate the contributions of cross - linker dynamics and polymer deformation to the frequency - dependent stiffness of actin filament gels , we compared the rheological properties of actin gels with three types of cross - linkers : a weak one , Acanthamoeba a - actinin ( dissociation rate constant 5 . 2 s - 1 , association rate constant 1 . 1 x 1 06 M - 1 s - 1 ) ; a strong one , chicken smooth muscle a - actinin ( dissociation rate constant 0 . 66 s - 1 , association rate constant 1 . 20 x 106 M - 1 s - 1 ) ; and an extremely strong one , biotin / avidin ( dissociation rate constant approximately zero ) . The biotin / avidin cross - linked gel , whose behavior is determined by polymer bending alone , behaves like a solid and shows no frequency dependence . The amoeba a - actinin cross - linked gel behaves like a viscoelastic fluid , and the frequency dependence of the stiffness can be explained by a mathematical model for dynamically cross - linked gels . The stiffness of the chicken a - actinin cross - linked gel is independent of frequency , and has viscoelastic properties intermediate between the two . The two a - actinins have similar association rate constants for binding to actin filaments , consistent with a diffusion - limited reaction . Rigid cross - links make the gel stiff , but make it elastic without the ability to deform permanently . Dynamically cross - linked actin filaments should allow the cell to react passively to various outside forces without any sort of signaling . Slower , signal - mediated pathways , such as severing filaments or changing the affinity of cross - linkers , could alter the nature of these passive reactions . INTRODUCTION The cytoplasm is a viscoelastic material ; it can either deform or rebound in response to an imposed stress ( Bray and White , 1988 ; Elson , 1988 ) . Control of this response is an important part of maintaining cell shape and allowing cell motility . Actin filaments and the proteins that cross - link them and control their size make a major contribution of these me - chanical properties of cytoplasm . We have previously re - ported ( Sato et al . , 1987 ) that the presence of the cross - linking protein a - actinin from Acanthamoeba castellanii affects the physical properties of actin filament gels in a way that may help explain the properties of cytoplasm . At low rates of deformation , the gels containing a - actinin are no stiffer than gels of actin filaments alone , but at high rates of deformation the complex modulus , the measure of resistance to deformation , is far greater in the presence of a - actinin . If this is true in cytoplasm , it would allow the cell to resist deformation if the deformation were rapid , but change shape in response to a slowly imposed force , as has been observed ( Bray et al . , 1986 ; Rappaport , 1967 ) . Janmey et al . ( 1990 ) have reported that another actin cross - linking protein , actin - binding protein ( ABP - 280 ) from human uterine leiomyoma , a smooth muscle tumor , does not have this effect . ABP / actin gels have a higher modulus than gels of actin filaments alone at all frequen - cies . Much lower concentrations of ABP than a - actinin Received for publication 21 October 1993 and in final form 30 December 1993 .

X 1994 by the Biophysical Society 0006 - 3495 / 94 / 03 / 801 / 09 $ 2 . 00 were needed to affect the modulus of actin gels , presum - ably because the ABP binds to actin more tightly . The dis - sociation equilibrium constant of ABP - 280 from leio - myoma for actin filaments is unknown , but that of ABP - 280 from macrophages is 1 , uM ( Gorlin et al . , 1990 ) , while that of amoeba a - actinin is 5 , uM ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . Janmey et al . compared the physical properties of ABP - 280 / actin gels to those of actin gels labeled with bio - tin and cross - linked by avidin . Biotin binds avidin with a dissociation equilibrium constant of 10 - 15 M , near that of a covalent bond ( Green , 1990 ) . The biotin - actin / avidin gel , therefore , is a gel with permanent cross - links , and its physical properties reflect those of the actin filaments themselves . The stiffness of the gel is due to bending or breaking of the filaments , not to sliding of one filaments past another . Janmey et al . showed that the physical prop - erties of an ABP - 280 / actin gel at a particular concentration of cross - linker and rate of deformation were similar to those of a biotin - actin / avidin gel . They argued that rear - rangement of actin filament cross - linking proteins does not account for the physical properties of cytoplasm . However , they did not explore a range of cross - linker concentrations or rates of deformation . We have previously reported ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) that the structure of cross - linked actin filament gels depends strongly on the affinity of the cross - linker for the actin . A weak cross - linker such asAcanthamoeba a - actinin will form bundles of actin filaments , which are stiff and have a high complex modulus but can slip past one another and thus are observed to be fluid rather than solid . A stronger cross - linker , such as a - actinin from chicken smooth muscle , will cross - link the gel into an isotropic network , and the gel will behave as a solid . At higher concentrations of cross - linker , bundles are thermodynamically favored and if the cross - linker can 801 Volume 66 March 1994 dissociate , the filaments can rearrange into bundles . Thus , at high cross - linker concentrations , the gel becomes more fluid - like , while still resisting deformation . Here we show that biotin - actin / avidin gels are fundamen - tally different from a tightly cross - linked actin gel made of smooth muscle a - actinin and actin . The biotin - actin / avidin gels are solid at all frequencies , and high concentrations of avidin do not increase the stiffness of the gel . The smooth muscle a - actinin / actin gels are less stiff , and are solid only at low concentrations . This concentration dependence is due to the fact that the a - actinin binding to actin , while strong , is not permanent ; the smooth muscle a - actinin dissociates from actin filaments with a rate constant of 0 . 66 / s . The fila - ments can still rearrange into bundles as they polymerize , and these bundles can behave like a viscoelastic fluid ( Wachs - stock et al . , 1993 ) . A much weaker cross - linker such as amoeba a - actinin , with a dissociation rate constant of 5 . 25 / s , shows a dramatic frequency dependence which can be modeled by the rapid rearrangement of cross - links during deformation . MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein purification Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle and a - actinin from A . castellanii were purified as described by Maciver et al . ( 1991 ) . a - Actinin from chicken smooth muscle was purified as described by Craig et al . ( 1982 ) . Both a - actinins were dialyzed into Buffer G ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 3 mM NaN3 ) before use . These proteins were stored in Buffer G at 40C and used within 1 week of puri - fication . Avidin was purchased from Pierce Chemical Co . ( Rockford , IL ) as a lyophilized powder and dissolved at 2 mg / ml in 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , and 0 . 3 mM NaN3 be - fore use . Fluorescently labeled chicken smooth muscle ai - actinin actin - binding domain The actin binding domain of smooth muscle a - actinin was purified by a modification ofthe method ofPavalko and Burridge ( 1991 ) . Briefly , chicken smooth muscle a - actinin ( 20 ml at about 3 , M ) was vacuum dialyzed and concentrated to about 2 ml in Buffer G in a MicroProDiCon ( Biomolecular Dynamics , Beaverton , OR ) . It was then incubated with 25 mg of agarose - linked thermolysin ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St Louis , MO ) for 6 h at 370C . The thermolysin agarose was removed by filtration through a Poly - Prep column ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and the digested protein loaded on a 5 - ml Econo - Q column ( Bio - Rad ) equilibrated with Buffer G . Under these con - ditions , the actin binding domain flows through the column and the rod domain is retained . Rhodamine - labeled actin binding domain was prepared by dialyzing against labeling buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 3 mM NaN3 ) overnight at 4°C and adding a 10 - fold molar excess of 25 mM io - doacetyltetramethylrhodamine ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) in dimeth - ylformamide . The solution was rotated slowly in the dark at 4°C overnight , and free dye was removed by gel filtration over Sepharose G - 25 ( Sigma ) . The protein was then digested with thermolysin as above . Modification of actin Iodoacetyl - N ' - biotinhexenediamine ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) was used to label actin by a modification of the method of Janmey et al . ( 1990 ) , the same method commonly used to label actin with iodoacetylpyrene ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1980 ) . Briefly , 24 , uM non - gel - filtered actin ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) was dialyzed into 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 25 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 3 mM ATP , 0 . 3 mM NaN3 and reacted with a 7 - fold molar excess of iodoacetylbiotin ( 40 mM in dimethylformamide ) . The solution was rotated slowly in the dark at 4°C overnight , and the resulting biotinylated poly - merized actin was purified by centrifugation , depolymerization , and gel filtration as described above . The extent of biotinylation was measured by the displacement of 2 - ( 4 ' - hydroxyazobenzene ) benzoic acid from avidin , using a kit from Pierce Chemical Co . ( Rockford , IL ) . The actin used in the experiments described here was 30 % biotinylated , and diluted to 2 % bio - tinylated with unlabeled actin . Rhodamine - labeled F - actin was prepared with iodoacetyltetramethyl - rhodamine using the same method as for biotinylation . Rheology Quantitative physical measurements were made with an R18 cone and plate Weissenberg rheogoniometer ( Sangamo Controls , Bognor Regis , Sussex , England ) in the forced oscillation mode as described by Sato et al . ( 1985 ) . The amplitude of oscillations for all experiments was 8 A±m , for a maximum shear strain of 1 % . Protein samples were mixed and polymerization initiated by adding lOX polymerization buffer to give final concentrations of 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA . The sample was immediately applied to the plates ofthe rheogoniometer and incubated over - night without shearing at 25°C in the instrument . The magnitude of the complex modulus , G * I , was calculated as G * = ( G ' 2 + ( 2 ' nf q1 ) 2 ) 1 / 2 ( Ferry , 1980 ) where G ' is the dynamic shear storage modulus , q ' is the dynamic viscosity and f is the frequency of oscillations in Hertz . The phase angle , 8 , was calculated as tan 8 = 2if q ' / G ' . The magnitude ofthe complex modulus was reproducible to within a factor of 5 and the phase shift within 10 % in repetitions of the rheological experiments . Kinetics of polymerization Polymerization was measured at 25°C by the increase in 900 light scattering at 395 nm . Samples of 1 . 08 ml were mixed in a plastic cuvette and polym - erization initiated by adding 120 Al of 10 X polymerization buffer . Determination of equilibrium dissociation constants Mixtures of actin with the actin binding domain of a - actinin were co - polymerized and centrifuged as previously described ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . Uncentrifuged and supernatant samples were electrophoresed and scanned in a densitometer . The uncentrifuged samples were used to plot a standard curve to determine the free protein concentration . In any given experiment , either the actin or the actin - binding domain concentration was kept constant and used as the concentration of sites in the equilibrium bind - ing equation , bound / sites = free / ( Kd + free ) . The data were fit with the least - squares fitting program , Regression ( Blackwell Scientific , Oxford ) . Fluorescence anisotropy stopped flow The equilibrium fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine - labeled actin - binding domain was measured in an SLM - 4800 fluorescence spectropho - tometer ( SLM Instruments , Urbana - Champaign , IL ) . Briefly , in a fluores - cence anisotropy measurement , the sample is excited with polarized light , and the ratio of parallel and perpendicular polarized emitted light is meas - ured . If the fluorophore is rigid , then the emitted light should be polarized in a fixed direction relative to the incident light . If the fluorophore is rotating more rapidly than the decay time of the fluorescence , the emitted light will be randomly polarized . The anisotropy is A = AO / ( 1 + Tf / T ; ) , where AO is the anisotropy of the immobile fluorophore ; Tf is the fluorescence decay time , about 5 ns for rhodamine ( Haugland , 1985 ) ; and Tr is the correlation time for the rotation ( Cantor and Schimmel , 1980 ) . Thus , rhodamine labeled actin - binding domain , with a Stokes ' radius of 2 . 3 nm ( see below ) , has a Biophysical Journal 802 a - Actinin and Avidin / Biotin in Actin Gels calculated rotational correlation time of 12 ns ( Cantor and Schimmel , 1980 ) and an anisotropy of AO / 1 . 42 . The translation diffusion of actin filaments is near zero ( Tait and Frieden , 1982 ) and filaments 5 , um long ( Burlacu et al . , 1992 ) , have a calculated rotational correlation time of 55 , us ( Cantor and Schimmel , 1980 ) . Thus , a protein bound to an actin filament should be virtually rigid on the time scale of fluorescence decay and should have an anisotropy close to AO . The fraction of actin - binding domain that is bound to actin filaments is proportional to the increase in anisotropy . Stopped - flow measurements were made in the instrument previously described ( Sinard and Pollard , 1990 ) , modified to have an incident vertical polarizing filter ( Melles - Griot , Rochester , NY ) and a 540 - nm short - pass filter ( Oriel , Stratford , CT ) and an emission vertical polarizing filter ( Melles - Griot , Rochester , NY ) and a 570 - nm long - pass filter ( Oriel , Stratford , CT ) . The instrument can only measure one emitted light beam , so the true an - isotropy could not be measured . Instead , we measured only the parallel component ofthe emitted light , which increases when the fluorophore stops rotating , as described above . To measure the association of at - actinin with actin filaments in the stopped - flow machine , polymerized actin in polymerization buffer with Buffer G was mixed 1 : 1 with actin - binding domain in Buffer G . For dis - sociation reactions , actin and rhodamine - labeled actin - binding domain were copolymerized in polymerization buffer with Buffer G . The complex was mixed with five parts of this buffer to initiate dissociation . 500 data points at a sampling interval of 0 . 1 ms for association and 1 ms for dissociation were collected . Determination of Stokes ' radii We determined the diffusion constants for both molecules using the formula D = kT / 67rrqr , where k is Boltzmann ' s constant , T is the absolute tempera - ture , i1 is the viscosity of water , and r is the Stokes ' radius of the molecule . The Stokes ' radius was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 100 ( Sigma ) for the actin - binding domain and Sephacryl S - 300 for a - actinin , using the method of Seigel and Monty ( 1966 ) . Myoglobin , carbonic anhy - drase , bovine serum albumin , 13 - amylase , and apoferretin ( Sigma ) were used to calibrate the columns . Theoretical modeling We used the kinetics simulation program HopKINSIM ( Wachsstock and Pollard , 1994 ) to estimate the rate constants for the binding of the a - actinin actin - binding domain to actin filaments , which was assumed to be a simple one - step bimolecular reaction . The rate constants were constrained to main - tain the calculated equilibrium dissociation constant equal to that found in the pelleting experiments . The increase in the parallel component of the emitted light is proportional to the fraction of actin - binding domain bound to actin . The coefficient was estimated by calculating the concentration of a - actinin bound at equilibrium from the known Kd , and setting that equal to the observed increase at 1 s , when the reaction is essentially complete . We used the approach of Shoenberg ( 1985 ; also Brenner , 1989 ; Brenner , 1991 ) to interpret the rheological data in molecular terms . He showed that a dynamically cross - linked polymer has a stiffness that depends on the velocity of deformation . The force due to the cross - linker in a step defor - mation of length d is ( Shoenberg ( 1985 ) , Eq . 11 ) F = nBKde - , where nBK is the force of the permanently cross - linked network , k is the dissociation rate constant , and t is the time from the deformation . For a two - headed cross - linker like a - actinin , the exponent is - 2kt . An oscillatory motion such as we use in the rheology experiments is a deformation d = do sin wo t , where do is the maximum deformation and X is the frequency of deformation in radians per second . Assuming that superposition is valid , the force equation can be integrated to F = nBKdoo { [ e - 1 ( - 2k cos tot + X sin wt ) + 2k ] / ( 4k2 + W2 ) . At maximum displacement , t = 7r / 2co , and the force is F = nBKdo ( we - kiii + 2k ) / ( 4k2 + c2 ) . The chord stiffness is the force divided by the displacement , S = F / do = Soc ( OQe - kITI + 2k ) I ( 4k2 + co2 ) , where SO is the stiffness of a permanently cross - linked network . We used this theoretical equation to fit the amoeba a - actinin rheological data . This model was developed specifically for myosin crossbridges in muscle . It assumes that all of the time dependence of the force relaxation is due to the rate of dissociation of the cross - linker . This is a very restrictive assumption , and will not be entirely valid in the actin system where some of the time dependence is due to the viscous properties of the filaments and filament bundles themselves ( Zaner and Hartwig , 1988 ; Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . However , the modulus of actin filaments alone is far less dependent on frequency than actin with amoeba ca - actinin , and this difference is pre - sumably due to the cross - linker . Any other cause of frequency dependence is explicitly excluded from the model . The validity of this assumption is supported by the agreement to the experimental data ( Fig . 5 ) but needs further testing . RESULTS We used a step - by - step approach to understand the mechani - cal properties of actin filaments with each of the three cross - linkers . First , we show that avidin / biotin cross - linking , like a - actinin cross - linking ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) , does not affect the kinetics of polymerization of actin ( Fig . 1 ) . Second , we determine the rheological properties of biotin / avidin cross - linked actin filaments and show that they are consistent with those of a permanently cross - linked network ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Third , we determine the rheological properties of actin filaments cross - linked by amoeba a - actinin ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) and show that they are consistent with a dynamic network with a dissociation rate constant of 5 . 25 s - 1 ( Fig . 3 ) . Fourth , we determine the rheological properties of actin fila - ments cross - linked by chicken a - actinin ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) and determine the dissociation rate constant to be 0 . 66 s - 1 ( Fig . 4 ) . Kinetics of polymerization Biotinylation of actin and polymerization in the presence of 0 . 3 , uM avidin do not affect the time course or extent of polymerization of 15 , uM actin ( Fig . 1 ) .

The biotin / avidin increases the magnitude and reduces the phase shift at all frequencies and concentrations . The chicken a - actinin increases the magnitude at all concentrations but not as much , and reduces the phase shift only at certain concentrations . The amoeba a - actinin does not reduce the phase shift and increases the magnitude of the complex modulus only at high concentrations and high frequencies . 20 s as nucleation limits the rate of assembly . This result is strong evidence that biotinylation and avidin have little or no effect on the distribution of filament lengths . It makes it unlikely that either the biotin or avidin nucleates or shortens the filaments . It is known that pyrene labeling actin on cysteine - 374 by this method does not affect its polymeriza - tion ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ; Kouyama and Mihashi , 1980 ) . Rheology of biotin - actin / avidin and actin / lo - actinin gels The magnitude of the complex modulus of a material mea - sures its resistance to an oscillatory deformation as a function of the amplitude of deformation , while the phase shift be - tween the deformation and the response depends on whether the material is solid or fluid . A solid will resist most when the extent of deformation is maximal , and so the stress will be in phase with the deformation . Such a response is elastic ; the material will return to its original shape after the stress is removed . For example , the modulus of steel is 7 . 6 x 1011 dyne / cm2 , with a phase shift of 0 . In contrast , a fluid resists most when the rate of deformation is maximal , so the phase shift is 900 or approximately 1 . 6 radians . Such a response is viscous ; the energy of deformation is lost and the material does not return to its original shape . For example , the modu - lus of water ranges from 1 . 2 X 10 - 2 dyne / cm2 at 0 . 19 Hz to 1 . 9 X 10 - 6 dyne / cm2 at 0 . 0003 Hz , with a phase shift of 1 . 6 radians . Long tangled polymers are viscoelastic ; they will show some recovery and have phase shifts between that of a solid and a fluid . Highly cross - linked rubber has a phase shift of 0 . 2 radians with a modulus of about 108 dyne / cm2 ( Ferry , 1980 ) . Avidin and the a - actinins differ both quantitatively and qualitatively in their effects on the mechanical properties of actin filament gels ( Fig . 2 ) . Actin filaments ( open squares ) have a modulus that varies between 2 and 10 dyne / cm2 de - pending on the frequency of deformation , with a phase shift about 0 . 3 radians ( Figs . 2 , C , D , E , F , open squares ) . Bio - tinylated actin ( Figs . 2 , A and B , open squares ) has rheo - logical properties very similar to those of pure actin . Avidin has a very high affinity for biotin ( Kd approxi - mately 10 - 15 M ( Green , 1990 ) ) , close to that of a covalent bond , so actin filaments cross - linked by avidin are perma - nently cross - linked ( Janmey et al . , 1990 ) . The magnitude of the complex modulus of such gels is very high ( Fig . 2A , filled symbols and open circles ) . The phase shift of these gels is zero at all frequencies ( Fig . 2 B ) . This is the behavior ex - pected of an elastic solid . The elasticity is due to the bending of the filaments , not to any rearrangement of the gel . Chicken smooth muscle a - actinin binds relatively tightly to actin filaments with an intermediate affinity , a Kd of 0 . 6 , uM ( Meyer and Aebi , 1990 ; Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . It increases the magnitude of the complex modulus ( Fig . 2 C ) , but not by as much as avidin . At these concentrations , the number of cross - links per filament is the same for avidin and chicken a - actinin ; the difference in the magnitude of the modulus is due to the ability of the filaments to slip past one another when cross - linked by the weaker a - actinin .

The model assumes that each cross - linker molecule has two independent actin binding sites that can bind actin filaments , be stretched ; = I s - 1 ~ into a high - energy configuration , then relax by dissociating 5 . 2 s l . and rebinding in a less strained configuration . It also assumes that each cross - linker binds actin independently of the other , and that the dissociation rate is independent of the strain . We assumed the actin filaments cross - linked with avidin had a los - r ' stiffness equal to S0 , the stiffness of a permanently cross - linked network . The stiffness S , used in the theoretical analy - sis was assumed to be equal to the magnitude of the complex modulus less the modulus of the actin filaments alone . A dissociation rate constant of 5 . 2 s51 for the complex of 10 Acanthamoeba a - actinin with actin filaments gave the best fit of the data with the theoretical equation by nonlinear least square fitting gives ( Fig . 3 ) . With the previously measured Mnodulus of amoeba equilibrium dissociation constant of 4 . 76 , M ( Wachsstock ithmic scale to better et al . , 1993 ) , this gives an association rate constant of 1 . 1 X st fit of the dynamic 106 M - 1 s - 1 , which is at the low end of the range for a ) nstant of 5 . 2 s - 1 , as diffusion - limited reaction .

( C ) Time course of association of the actin - binding domain to actin filaments and computer simulation of the reaction . Fluorescence units were converted into concentrations of bound actin - binding domain by estimating the equilibrium concentration of bound protein from the equilibrium constant in Fig . 4A and equating that to the final fluorescence intensity in the stop flow experiment . 40 , uM F - actin was mixed one to one with varying concentrations of actin - binding domain . The concentrations labeling the curves are the total final concentration of actin - binding domain . The solid lines are theoretical curves calculated with HopKINSIM for a simple bimolecular binding with an association rate constant of 3 X 106 M - 1 s - 1 and a dissociation rate constant of 57 s - 1 . ( D ) Calculated rate constants for the reaction of actin - binding domain to actin with varying actin concentrations . Stop flow experiments with varying actin and actin - binding domain concentrations were performed and fit to exponentials with Cricket Graph ( Computer Associates , San Jose , CA ) , and the apparent rate constant , kb , , plotted as a function of the actin concentration . Error bars are the standard error of the mean for experiments with constant actin concentration and varying actin - binding domain concentration . Solid symbols are association experiments ; open symbol represents dissociation experiments . The line is the theoretical line for the rate constants from Fig . 4 C ; it is not the best fit through the points . ing rate constants by stopped - flow fluorescence polarization ( Fig . 4 B ) . The best fit to the pooled equilibrium data gave an equilibrium dissociation constant for the actin - binding domain of 19 . 5 , iM ( Fig . 4 A ) . In the stopped - flow experi - ments ( Fig . 4 B ) , fluorescently labeled actin - binding domain was excited with polarized light . The small freely rotating protein emits unpolarized light , but when it is rigidly bound to an actin filament it will mostly emit light polarized parallel to the incident beam . The intensity of the parallel polarized component is then a measure of what fraction of the actin - binding domain is bound to actin filaments . The interaction of the actin - binding domain with actin can be closely mod - eled with rate constants of 3 X 106 M - 1 s - ' for association and 57 s - 1 for dissociation ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . The association rate constant for most biological reactions is proportional to the sum of the diffusion constants for the reactants ( Berg and von Hippel , 1985 ; Northrup and Erikson , 1992 ) . The constant of proportionality is a function of the geometry ofthe interaction . For the purpose of comparing the interaction of actin with a - actinin to that of actin with the actin - binding domain , the geometric factors should be the same , since the same part of the a - actinin molecule is in - teracting in each case . Actin filaments have a very small diffusion constant ( Tait and Frieden , 1982 ) , so the associa - A C ) a ) 0 . Free , ±M m 1 . * Fe 0 . ~ E 0 ' 0 ) 0 . _ a Q 0 . C0 . _ X ' O . C 0 O .

This can be calculated from the Stokes ' radius , as described under Materials and Methods . We meas - ured the Stokes ' radius of a - actinin to be 7 . 4 nm by gel filtration chromatography , and hence the diffusion constant is 2 . 94 X 10 - 7 cm2 / s . Similarly , the Stokes ' radius of the actin - binding domain is 2 . 4 nm and the diffusion constant is 9 . 2 X 10 - 7 cm2 / s . The estimated association rate constant for chicken a - actinin to actin is thus 1 . 20 X 106 M - 1 S - 1 . Using the previously measured equilibrium constant for chicken a - actinin of 0 . 55 , uM ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) the apparent dissociation rate constant is 0 . 66 s - 1 . DISCUSSION Most actin cross - linkers , including the a - actinins and ABP - 280 , have dissociation equilibrium constants in the range of 0 . 1 to 10 , uM . Chicken smooth muscle a - actinin has a Kd of 0 . 55 , uM ; amoeba a - actinin has a Kd of 4 . 7 , M ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) ; macrophage ABP - 280 has aKd of 1 AM ( Gorlin et al . , 1990 ) . Assuming the association is approximately diffusion - limited ( Berg and von Hippel , 1985 ) , the disso - ciation rate constants for these cross - linker - actin complexes will be in the range of 0 . 1 - 50 / s , so the cross - links can re - arrange in biologically relevant time scales . This sort of dy - namic cross - linking may allow the cytoskeleton to rearrange in response to internal or external forces without requiring active signals to sever or polymerize filaments . On the other hand , static cross - linkers such as covalent linkages or biotin / avidin will cross - link the gel into an isotropic solid with no ability to react passively ; they can only deform in response to external forces by being taken apart and re - built . Bending of polymers allows elastic deformation ; when the deforming force is removed , the cell returns to its previous configuration . The quality of this passive reaction can be regulated by changing the nature of the cross - links or the actin fila - ments . The length of the filament can be controlled with severing and capping proteins ( Weeds and Maciver , 1993 ) . Shorter filaments diffuse more rapidly and are more likely to form bundles ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) so a gel of short filaments will behave as a fluid , not a solid . The affinity of the cross - linker affects the properties of the gel ( Wachs - stock et al . , 1993 and this work ) . This affinity could be controlled to allow locomotion or cytokinesis . For ex - ample , the affinity of many cytoplasmic a - actinins can be controlled by the calcium concentration ( Blanchard et al . , 1989 ) . The physical properties of the cytoskeleton can also be controlled by the concentration of the actin and cross - linker ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) , by polymerizing new ac - tin filaments , elongation of actin filaments , or recruiting new cross - linking proteins ( Janmey et al . , 1990 ; Janson et al . , 1992 ; Stossel , 1984 ) . We show here that actin gels cross - linked by a - actinin do not resemble statically cross - linked gels . Actin fila - ments with the weak cross - linker Acanthamoeba a - actinin are viscoelastic fluids ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . The magnitude of the complex modulus depends on the frequency of the deformation , as is predicted for a dynamic cross - linker that can exchange on the time scale studied ( Shoenberg , 1985 ) and this can be used to estimate the dissociation rate constant . As shown previously ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) , actin filaments with chicken a - actinin can either behave as a solid or as a viscoelastic fluid . At low concentrations of a - actinin the mixtures are solids , as Janmey et al . ( 1990 ) found for ABP - 280 . At higher concentrations mixtures are more fluid . At the concentrations of a - actinin tested , the stiffness remained approximately the same . With higher concentrations of a - actinin , the modulus increases ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . An independent method for measuring the kinetics of binding , using stopped - flow fluorescence anisotropy ( Fig . 4 and the analysis under Results ) , gives an association rate constant for chicken a - actinin to actin very similar to that estimpated for amoeba a - actinin from the rheological data . This implies that the binding reactions ofthe two proteins are very similar and that their differences are due to 10 - fold difference in their rates of dissociation . The higher affinity of the smooth muscle a - actinin for actin has two effects on the frequency response . First , it shifts the point of maxi - mum frequency dependence to a lower rate . Second , the filaments in amoeba a - actinin / actin gels are bundled at these concentrations and thus the cross - linkers are aligned with one another , similar to the muscle situation for which the quantitative analysis was developed . The smooth muscle a - actinin / actin gel is isotropic , and the molecules are randomly arranged and experience widely varying strains ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . This variation in strain flattens the frequency dependence curve and make the quantitative analysis uninterpretable . The biotin - actin / avidin gels are permanently cross - linked . They are solid at all frequencies and concentrations , and their mechanical properties are independent of frequency in the range tested . If the frequency dependence of amoeba a - actinin / actin gels were due to bending of the filaments , as suggested by Janmey et al . ( 1988 ) , then it should have been even more pronounced in the static cross - linker case . Therefore , filament bending and breaking do not determine the physical properties of a - actinin - cross - linked actin fila - ments ; these are determined by the nature of the cross - links themselves . ABP - 280 is very different from a - actinin . Nonetheless , the ABP - 280 data of Janmey et al . ( 1990 ) are consistent with a strong dynamic cross - linker that can slowly rear - range . At the low concentrations of ABP - 280 they used , the gel behaved like a solid , but with some creep . Zaner ( 1988 ) observed a similar effect . They did not look at the frequency dependence of their biotin - actin / avidin gels , but our data is suggestive that any dynamic cross - linker , even a strong one that acts like a solid on a second time scale , is very different from a convalently cross - linked network . Wachsstock et al . 807 808 Biophysical Joumal Volume 66 March 1994 Cells contain a variety of actin filament cross - linkers that bind actin with a range of affinities . The cell can con - trol its shape and resistance to deformation by compart - mentalizing the cross - linkers to different parts of the cell . For instance , nonmuscle ABP - 280 is found largely in the cortex ( Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ; Mittal et al . , 1987 ) , while a - actinin is largely in focal adhesions and in actin filament bundles in cultured cells ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ; Geiger , 1989 ) . The high affinity but dynamic nature of the ABP - 280 cross - links would allow the cell to resist outside forces but still rearrange slowly ( Bray et al . , 1986 ; Rappa - port , 1967 ) . The lower affinity a - actinin allows the actin polymerized inside the cell to form stiff filament bundles , which act as a very viscous fluid ( Jockusch and Isenberg , 1981 ; Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . The dynamic nature of a - actinin cross - links in actin gels means that if the cell severs the filaments in only a small part of the cortex , making it more fluid , the cytoplasm can efficiently flow into the gap , allowing locomotion to take place ( Cunning - ham et al . , 1992 ) . The calcium - dependent a - actinin of many nonmuscle cells ( Blanchard et al . , 1989 ) allows an - other level of control of the properties of the cell . By vary - ing the affinity of the cross - linker for actin , the cell can change its cytoplasm from a rigid to a dynamic network . This , combined with calcium - dependent severing proteins like gelsolin ( Cortese and Frieden , 1990 ; Newman et al . , 1991 ) , may give the cell precise control over motility and organelle movement . Note added in proof . - A review submitted when this paper was already in press pointed out that the equation for the analysis for Fig . 3 was integrated over one cycle of oscillation . A more accurate analysis would have inte - grated over infinitely many cycles for a steady - state result , which gives S = Soo ( w2 + k2 ) - 112 . This equation yields an association rate constant for amoeba a - actinin to actin of 1 . 3 X 106 M - 1s - 1 , rather than 1 . 1 X 106M - ls - 1 .
