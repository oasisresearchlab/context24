The physiological consequences of using different actin isoforms , and the 28 molecular mechanisms by which highly conserved actin isoforms are segregated into 29 distinct networks , are poorly known . Here , we sought to understand how a simple 30 biological system , composed of a unique actin and a limited set of actin - binding 31 proteins , reacts to a switch to heterologous actin expression . Using yeast as a model 32 system and biomimetic assays , we show that such perturbation causes drastic 33 reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Our results indicate that defective interaction 34 of a heterologous actin for important regulators of actin assembly limits certain actin 35 assembly pathways while reinforcing others . Expression of two heterologous actin 36 variants , each specialized in assembling a different network , rescues cytoskeletal 37 organization and confers resistance to external perturbation . Hence , while species 38 using a unique actin have homeostatic actin networks , actin assembly pathways in 39 species using several actin isoforms may act more independently . 40 41 3 Introduction 42 A fundamental characteristic of eukaryotic cells is the existence of an organized actin 43 cytoskeleton . Dynamic actin filaments are assembled into diverse architectures which 44 co - exist within one cytoplasm , each of which is involved in the exertion of forces for 45 various cellular functions ( Blanchoin et al , 2014 ) . Key partners are families of actin - 46 binding proteins ( ABPs ) , which interact with actin monomers and filaments to 47 regulate cytoskeletal organization and dynamics ( Moseley & Goode , 2006 ; Pollard , 48 2016 ) . Actin sequence is highly conserved across most eukaryotes , but while some 49 cell types only express a single actin ( for example yeasts ) , other cell types can 50 express several similar actin isoforms ( for example non - muscle mammalian cells 51 express beta - and gamma - actins which are 99 % identical ) , or even very different 52 actin isoforms ( for example , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expresses two actins , IDA5 53 and NAP1 , which are only 65 % identical ) ( Gunning et al , 2015 ; Boiero Sanders et al , 54 2020 ) . An extreme case is plants , which can express a multitude of actin isoforms 55 ( for example , Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana express 21 and 8 actin isoforms , 56 respectively ) . Adding to this complexity , some actins can undergo partial post - 57 translational modifications ( PTMs ) , such as arginylation or acetylation , which modify 58 their biochemical properties ( A et al , 2020 ; Kashina , 2014 ; Boiero Sanders et al , 59 2020 ) . 60 61 Hence , while a number of organisms are able to assemble a complex actin 62 cytoskeleton from one ( or a limited number ) of actin isoforms , other organisms 63 require the presence of multiple actin isoforms to generate such variability . In line 64 with this idea , segregation of actin isoforms is observed in vivo . Results from different 65 mammalian cell lines have found that beta - actin was located mainly in the contractile 66 4 ring , stress fibers , filopodia and cell - cell contacts while gamma - actin was localized 67 primarily in the cortex and lamellipodia ( Dugina et al , 2009 ; Chen et al , 2017 ) . In 68 Arabidopsis thaliana , the main vegetative actin isoforms organize into different 69 structures in epidermal cells ( Kijima et al , 2018 ) . However , it should be noted that 70 expression in mice of a beta - coded gamma - actin , where the nucleotide sequence of 71 beta - actin is modified minimally to express gamma - actin , led to viable mice with no 72 detectable change in behavior ( Vedula et al , 2017 ) . This result indicates that at least 73 in some cases , the absence of an actin isoform can be compensated by the 74 expression of a similar isoform . 75 76 A particular challenge for the field is to understand how small differences at the 77 molecular level lead to a major segregation of actin isoforms at the cellular level . To 78 decipher the underlying mechanisms , it is natural to postulate that actin isoforms 79 bear small yet significant biochemical differences . Our knowledge of the distinctions 80 between actins is limited to a small number of actin orthologs ( mainly S . cerevisiae 81 Act1p , rabbit muscle actin , to a lesser extent beta - and gamma - actins , S . pombe 82 Act1p and plant actins ) . Nonetheless , these studies reveal notable differences in their 83 biochemical properties ( Nefsky & Bretscher , 1992 ; Kim et al , 1996 ; Buzan & Frieden , 84 1996 ; Bryan & Rubenstein , 2005 ; Takaine & Mabuchi , 2007 ; Kijima et al , 2016 ) , in 85 their mechanical properties ( Orlova et al , 2001 ; McCullough et al , 2011 ) , and their 86 ability to interact with the different actin - binding proteins ( Nefsky & Bretscher , 1992 ; 87 Eads et al , 1998 ; Takaine & Mabuchi , 2007 ; Ezezika et al , 2009 ; McCullough et al , 88 2011 ; Kang et al , 2014 ; Kijima et al , 2016 ) , including nucleation factors of actin 89 assembly ( Ti & Pollard , 2011 ; Chen et al , 2017 ) . How such differences account for 90 spatial segregation of actin isoforms on a cellular scale remains unclear . 91 5 92 In this work , we investigated , from a general perspective , the molecular principles by 93 which actin isoforms can be addressed to different networks . Analysis in a model 94 system , that exploits at least two actins to perform various actin functions , would 95 explain a particular mechanism in a relevant physiological context . However , the 96 importance of actin renders genetic manipulations difficult , and the inter - connection 97 of actin networks in such models complicates cellular analysis . Mammalian systems 98 in particular express many ABP isoforms , which makes interpretation of molecular 99 mechanisms combinatorially challenging . Furthermore , co - expression of multiple 100 actin isoforms makes endogenous purification as a single species difficult , although 101 new powerful protocols have been developed in recent years for their expression and 102 purification ( Hatano et al , 2018 , 2020 ) . To overcome these limitations , we decided to 103 adopt an alternative strategy , by determining the consequences of heterologous actin 104 expression in a system normally using a single actin . With this approach , we aimed 105 at measuring the consequences of a perturbation caused by the use of a different 106 actin at the level of the cell and its cytoskeleton . We decided to use the well - studied 107 organism , budding yeast , for the simplicity of its genetics . Another advantage of 108 budding yeast is that actin assembles predominantly into two well - defined structures . 109 These structures are actin patches , which are sites of endocytosis and where actin 110 filaments are short and branched by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and actin cables , which are 111 central for maintenance of cell polarity and intra - cellular trafficking , and where actin 112 filaments are nucleated by the formin family of proteins ( Moseley & Goode , 2006 ) . 113 Lastly , budding yeast allows for clean purification of ABPs in a defined organismal 114 context . 115 116 6 Our results demonstrate that actin functions are regulated both at the nucleotide level 117 where defects in actin expression leads to cell growth defects , and at the amino acid 118 level where expression of heterologous actins induce a massive reorganization of the 119 actin cytoskeleton . We demonstrate that actin isoforms are used with different 120 efficiencies by the distinct actin assembly pathways , resulting in their targeting to 121 particular actin structures . Finally , dissection of the underlying molecular mechanisms 122 allows us to propose an explanation of our results , and a general model of the 123 molecular mechanisms enabling segregation of actin isoforms in cells . 124 7 Results 125 Generation of a library of yeast strains expressing a variety of actin orthologs 126 We created a library of S . cerevisiae strains that express different actin orthologs to 127 evaluate the consequences of actin variation on yeast actin cytoskeleton assembly . 128 In order to ensure that defects were not due to potential misfolding or non - functional 129 actin , we selected a diversity of actins from other species rather than using directed 130 mutations . This approach guarantees that the actin orthologs are functional in a 131 biologically - relevant context , and maintain key physiological properties such as 132 polymerization , depolymerization , nucleotide binding and hydrolysis . 133 We chose 122 different actins from species covering the entire eukaryotic 134 phylogenetic tree for analysis ( Table S1 and Fig . S1 A ) . We also computationally 135 predicted ancestral sequences to extend the range of actin variant possibilities . 136 Because the actin protein sequence is highly conserved across species , ancestral 137 sequence reconstructions score with high confidence ( Fig . S1 B ) . We obtained in 138 total 223 actin sequences ( including 101 ancestral actins ) , from which we selected 15 139 for analysis . These actin orthologs were chosen to cover a spectrum from the most 140 similar to wild - type S . cerevisiae ’s actin ( Act1p ) to very divergent actin orthologs , 141 which represent a wide range of identities ( from 99 to 84 % ) ( Fig . 1A and S1 B - C , 142 Table 1 ) , and to display differences across all domains of the actin fold ( Fig . 1 B - C 143 and S1C ) . 144 We synthesized the actin nucleotide sequences and sub - cloned them in a plasmid 145 created specifically for rapid and robust actin gene replacement under endogenous 146 promoter control in S . cerevisiae ( Fig . S1D ) . With this strategy , we created a library 147 of yeast strains , from which we systematically studied the effect of deleting the actin 148 intron in haploid cells , changing the nucleotide sequence without modifying the final 149 8 actin protein in haploid cells , switching actin protein variants in haploid cells , and 150 expressing copolymers of actin in diploid cells ( Fig . 1 D ) . 151 152 Previous studies have demonstrated that the yeast actin intron is not essential for 153 actin gene transcription and for normal cell growth ( Ng et al , 1985 ) . Indeed , our 154 analysis found that an act1 gene construct without the intron in S . cerevisiae S288C 155 ( ScNI ) does not affect cell growth ( Fig . S2 A and B ) nor actin expression ( Fig . S2 C 156 and D ) . Fixation and phalloidin - labeling of the actin cytoskeleton reveals that the two 157 main structures of actin filaments in yeast , actin patches and actin cables , are well - 158 organized in yeast strains expressing actin in the absence of the intron and 159 indistinguishable from wild type cells ( Sc ) ( Fig S2 , E - G ) . Therefore , all experiments 160 presented in the following sections of this study were conducted on actins expressed 161 in the absence of an intron . 162 163 Cell fitness tolerates reduced wild - type actin expression above a threshold 164 We were concerned that small changes to the actin nucleotide sequence might have 165 consequences on actin expression levels and cell viability ( Hoekema et al , 1987 ; 166 Zhou et al , 2016 ) . In mammals , for instance , nucleotide sequence was shown to 167 differentiate beta and gamma actin functions ( Vedula et al , 2017 ) . Therefore , we 168 expressed wild - type actin from a range of different nucleotide sequences . We used 169 coding sequences from other organisms , which we modified minimally so that the 170 final product remained S . cerevisiae ’s actin at the protein level ( Table 1 ) ( Fig . S2 H ) . 171 Western blot analysis showed that silent mutations affect wild - type actin’s expression 172 level to various extents ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , with a clear correlation between actin 173 expression and the level of conservation of the nucleotide sequence ( Fig . S2 I ) . 174 9 These data also revealed that a sizeable drop of actin expression ( for example , 175 Act _ Sc [ Sp ] , derived from S . pombe’s actin gene , is expressed at 35 % of normal 176 level ) , has little or no effect on cell viability ( Fig . 2 , C - E and S2 J ) nor on the 177 organization ( Fig . 2 , F - H ) or polarity ( Fig . 2 I ) of the actin cytoskeleton . However , a 178 more drastic drop of actin expression ( for example , Act _ Sc [ At ] , derived from A . 179 thaliana ’s ACT8 gene , is expressed at 24 % of normal level ) , affects visibly cell 180 viability ( Fig . 2 , C - E and S2 J ) , the organization ( Fig . 2 , F - H ) and the polarization 181 ( Fig . 2I ) of the actin cytoskeleton . Expressing actin from a gene derived from the 182 nucleotide sequence of H . sapiens ActB , whose nucleotide sequence is even less 183 conserved , is lethal for cells . From these observations , we concluded that the level of 184 expression levels of actin orthologs should be controlled carefully in this study . 185 Nevertheless , these results also indicated that variations in actin expression down to 186 a  35 % threshold generally have negligible effect on cell behavior . 187 188 Actin amino acid sequence variations affect cell fitness and imbalance the 189 linear - to - branched actin network ratio 190 We next focused our attention on the consequences of expressing heterologous actin 191 orthologs in yeast cells . Actin genes were designed based on S . cerevisiae ’s Act1 192 sequence by making point mutations using yeast codon usage . Overall , all coding 193 sequences used in this section are more than 90 % identical to that of S . cerevisiae , 194 which according to the previous section , lowers the risk that actin expression is 195 reduced excessively . Nevertheless , we verified the expression level of each 196 heterologous actin ortholog in haploid strains by western blotting . The expression 197 level of each actin varied , and appeared not to be correlated with the evolutionary 198 relationship ( Fig . 3 , A - B ) . For example , Act _ N1 was only expressed at 39 % despite 199 10 having a 98 . 4 % identity to wild - type actin and showed normal viability and 200 cytoskeletal organization ( Fig . 3 , C - G ) . 201 While yeast strains expressing heterologous actin orthologs similar to S . cerevisiae 202 wild - type actin ( identity > 97 % ) grew well ( Fig . 3 , C - E ) , had normal cytoskeletal 203 organization ( Fig . 3 , F - G ) and were polarized normally ( Fig . 3H ) , yeast strains 204 expressing more distant actins ( identity < 97 % ) showed moderate to severe defects 205 ( Fig . 3 , C - H ) . The strength of the growth phenotypes correlated with the degree of 206 conservation of the actin orthologs ( Fig . 3E ) . Interestingly , consequences on the 207 organization of the actin cytoskeleton was not the same for all mutants . While cells 208 expressing Act _ N2 assembled , on average , an abnormally high number of actin 209 patches , strains expressing Act _ Op or Act _ Ca assembled , on the contrary , a higher 210 number of actin cables and few actin patches ( Fig . 3 , F - G , I ) . Considering that actin 211 networks do not assemble independently in cells , but that homeostatic actin networks 212 share a limited monomeric actin pool ( Burke et al , 2014 ) , the previous observation 213 suggests an imbalanced assembly between branched - and linear - actin structures 214 from the use of different actin variants . We hypothesized that the cellular machinery 215 cannot use Act _ N2 efficiently to assemble actin cables , and cannot use Act _ Op or 216 Act _ Ca to assemble actin patches , thus leading to an overproduction of patches in 217 Act _ N2 cells and an overproduction of cables in Act _ Op and Act _ Ca cells . It is also 218 possible that patch or cable assembly is boosted by the use of a particular actin 219 ortholog , although this hypothesis seems less likely , since it is generally easier to 220 disrupt a function than make it more efficient . 221 Following this hypothesis , we tested whether strains over - assembling actin patches 222 would show acute resistance to Arp2 / 3 perturbations . This was the case , as the 223 strain expressing Act _ N2 showed persistence of actin patches on treatment with the 224 11 small molecule inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex CK - 666 ( Fig . 3J , K ) . Conversely , 225 Act _ Op and Act _ Ca strains were more sensitive to CK - 666 . These results indicate 226 that strains with increased branched network are buffered against Arp2 / 3 227 perturbations . 228 229 A biomimetic assay recapitulates actin ortholog preference for branched - or 230 linear - network assembly 231 We then aimed to understand the molecular principles that allow different actin 232 ortholog to be assembled specifically to certain actin networks , and hypothesized that 233 heterologous actin orthologs may bind defectively to certain ABPs of S . cerevisiae . 234 Because actin assembly into patches and cables involves a large number of proteins 235 in cells , we adopted a reductionist approach based on a reconstituted assay . We 236 considered that the subset of ABPs that are most essential for actin patch or cable 237 assembly in vivo . Beyond formins and the Arp2 / 3 complex , these proteins include : 238 profilin , a small globular protein that favors formin assembly , capping protein , a 239 heterodimer that binds to barbed ends , ADF / cofilin , a small protein that promotes the 240 disassembly of actin filaments , and tropomyosin , a helical coiled - coil protein that 241 binds and stabilizes linear - actin filaments nucleated by formins ( Moseley & Goode , 242 2006 ; Pollard , 2016 ) . 243 In addition to wild - type actin , we purified Act _ N2 and Act _ Ca from cultures of the 244 corresponding yeast strains . We reconstituted in vitro , in a common experimental 245 environment , branched - and linear - actin network assembly , respectively from formin - 246 and WASp - coated beads ( Antkowiak et al , 2019 ) . First , we assessed the capabilities 247 of the three actin orthologs to assemble into such networks . Act _ Ca assembled only 248 into linear - actin networks ( Fig . 4A ) , providing explanation for the inability of Act _ Ca 249 12 cells to assemble actin patches . However , Act _ N2 assembled both into branched - 250 and linear - actin networks similarly to the control condition . We therefore 251 hypothesized that an ABP , involved in the stabilization or disassembly of one of 252 those actin networks , may bind abnormally . We labeled ADF / cofilin , which is known 253 to promote branched - network disassembly by inducing Arp2 / 3 debranching while 254 stabilizing linear - networks ( Michelot et al , 2007 ; Chan et al , 2009 ) . ADF / cofilin bound 255 to linear - actin networks with higher affinity than to the branched - actin networks ( Fig . 256 4B ) , as previously reported ( Gressin et al , 2015 ) . However , ADF / cofilin bound 257 similarly to both actin variants , albeit with reduced affinity compared to wild - type actin 258 ( Fig . 4B ) . We next labeled tropomyosin , which inhibits branched - network assembly 259 and promotes linear - network stabilization ( Blanchoin et al , 2001 ; Bernstein & 260 Bamburg , 1982 ; DesMarais et al , 2002 ; Antkowiak et al , 2019 ) . Tropomyosin bound 261 with higher efficiency to linear - actin networks , as expected ( Fig . 4C ) . Its binding to 262 Act1p and Act _ Ca was similar ; however , tropomyosin was completely absent from 263 actin networks assembled from Act _ N2 ( Fig . 4C ) . This inability to bind to Act _ N2 264 provides a likely explanation why actin patch assembly is favored in Act _ N2 cells . 265 266 Structural analysis provides plausible explanation of defective interactions 267 We searched for a structural understanding of why Act _ N2 and Act _ Ca do not 268 interact properly with specific ABPs of S . cerevisiae . Based on the structural 269 information available of the interactions of actin with its binding partners , we identified 270 actin residues that are within 5 Å of at the actin - actin interface in a filament , or at the 271 interface between G - or F - actin and the ABPs used in our biomimetic assay ( Winn et 272 al , 2011 ) , with the exception of the Arp2 / 3 mother filament which were within 10 Å 273 13 since the coordinates were not released when this study was performed ( Fäßler et al , 274 2020 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . 275 At protomer : protomer interfaces , wild - type actin differed by one residue ( Val287Met ) 276 and two residues ( Ala167Glu and Ser170Ala ) relative to Act _ Ca and Act _ N2 , 277 respectively ( Fig . 5B ) . In particular , the Ala167Glu substitution has been shown to 278 effect actin filament stiffness ( Hocky et al , 2016 ; Kang et al , 2012 ; Scipion et al , 279 2018 ) . Furthermore , four differences were observed in inter - strand contacts relative 280 to Sc ( Ser194Thr and Glu270Asp for Act _ N2 ) and ( Ser201Thr and Thr203Ser for 281 Act _ Ca ) ( Fig . 5B ) . Together , these substitutions may subtly alter the relative filament 282 plasticity , which in turn may have an influence on the association or activity of 283 filament binding and filament nucleating proteins ( McCullough et al , 2011 ; von der 284 Ecken et al , 2015 ) . In addition , we identified 15 non - conserved residues of Act _ N2 or 285 Act _ Ca that are surface exposed on the actin protomer structures and contact a 286 binding partner ( Table 2 ) . Tropomyosin is likely to be particularly susceptible to small 287 changes in the actin filaments , since it loosely associates with the actin filament 288 surface via shape and charge complementarity ( Popp & Robinson , 2012 ; von der 289 Ecken et al , 2016 ) . Particularly , Act _ N2 filament Asp311 potentially places the 290 negative charge at ~ 1 . 5 Å closer to the actin , relative to the Sc and Ca filaments 291 ( glutamic acid ) , which may be inappropriate for tropomyosin binding . Act _ N2 has 292 substitutions in interfaces with all the proteins used in the in vitro assays , including 293 Arp2 / 3 and formin interfaces , which could have impaired the activities of these 294 filament nucleating complexes . Act _ Ca has fewer substitutions in the actin regulating 295 proteins , with the notable exception of Arp2 / 3 . In particular , substitutions in the actin 296 interfaces with Arp2 / 3 subunits in the daughter filament may indicate that the 297 14 nucleation process of the daughter filament is impaired for Act _ Ca with S . 298 cerevisiae ’s Arp2 / 3 . 299 300 Dual expression of a patch and a cable - favoring actin rescues cell viability and 301 cytoskeletal organization 302 The identification of heterologous actin orthologs favoring the specific assembly of 303 actin patches or cables suggested that actin functions could be separated from the 304 use of two carefully selected actin variants ( Fig . 6A ) . To test this possibility , we 305 switched to a diploid yeast cell background . We verified first that both Act _ N2 / Act _ N2 306 and Act _ Ca / Act _ Ca cells display similar phenotypes to their haploid equivalents , with 307 slow growth and unbalanced actin patch and cable assembly ( Fig . 6B - C ) . We then 308 crossed strains in order to express a copy of each actin variant in the same cell . 309 Strikingly , cell growth ( Fig . 6B - C ) , actin cytoskeleton organization ( Fig . 6D - E ) and cell 310 polarity ( Fig . 6F ) were rescued in diploid cells expressing both Act _ N2 and Act _ Ca . 311 Verification that each of the actin structures was enriched by each of the variants is 312 difficult to do in the absence of specific antibodies ; nevertheless , our results indicate 313 that defective actin functions in cells carrying a single actin variant were carried out 314 more normally when the other actin variant was simultaneously expressed . 315 316 F - actin network homeostasis is affected in a two - actin system 317 Generation of yeast strains with partially separated actin functions enabled us to 318 question some differences between species sharing a single actin for multiple cellular 319 functions , and species using different actin variants . We were especially curious to 320 know what the physiological consequences would be on actin network homeostasis 321 for wild type diploid cells and Act _ N2 / Act _ Ca cells , which share the same ratio of 322 15 branched and linear network but possess different actin variants . As expected , 323 addition of CK - 666 in wild - type cells resulted in the disappearance of actin patches 324 and an increase of actin cables ( Fig . 6G - H ) . On the contrary , addition of CK - 666 to 325 Act _ N2 / Act _ Ca cells had a weaker effect , as a large number of actin patches could 326 still be observed ( Fig . 6G - H ) . Together , these results show that while F - actin network 327 homeostasis is preserved in a yeast strain using a single actin ortholog , actin re - 328 distribution from one network to another is less effective in the context of a yeast 329 strain expressing two different actin variants . 330 331 332 Discussion 333 Identification of actin variants that favor branched - or linear - actin networks 334 assembly 335 He we investigated , at the cellular and at the molecular level , the consequences of 336 perturbing a simple system which uses a single actin ortholog and a limited number 337 of regulatory proteins to assemble an organized actin cytoskeleton . We 338 demonstrated that small variations in the actin sequence are sufficient to induce a 339 global reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . This finding highlights the fact that , 340 despite the remarkably high sequence conservation of actin orthologs across 341 species , there are sufficient differences in sequence for cells to segregate multiple 342 actin variants into diverse actin networks . 343 Generally , we found that mutant cells expressing a heterologous actin assemble an 344 abnormal distribution of actin patches and cables . This result is coherent with the 345 literature , which shows particularly in yeast that homeostatic actin networks compete 346 for a limited pool of actin monomers ( Burke et al , 2014 ) ( Fig . 7 top and bottom left ) . In 347 16 this context , it is rational to postulate that the inability of an actin variant to assemble 348 efficiently in a given actin network , leads to an expansion of the other actin networks , 349 provided that those can use this actin normally ( Fig . 7 top middle ) . 350 351 The possibility to rescue yeast cell viability with the simultaneous expression of 352 patch - favoring and cable - favoring actin variants , reinforces the possibility that actin 353 isoforms compensate for the other actin’s lack of efficiency to form a certain structure 354 ( Fig . 7 top right ) . The lack of specific probes that can differentiate between these 355 actin variants prevented us from localizing them in cells and from verifying the extent 356 of segregation . We expect the integration of an actin variant within a particular 357 network to be dependent on its innate ability to assemble in such a network , and also 358 to be affected by relative efficiencies of other co - expressed actin variants to integrate 359 within branched - and linear - actin networks . Such a hypothesis is purely speculative 360 and should be formally tested in the future . Nevertheless , our observations strongly 361 suggest that we were successful in performing a partial separation of function , and in 362 transforming yeast from being an organism that uses a single actin into an organism 363 using two actin variants to perform several actin - based functions . 364 365 Molecular subtleties guide actins to appropriate networks 366 This study was originally motivated to provide a systematic description of the 367 molecular principles by which different actin isoforms could become spatially 368 segregated into different networks . Experiments performed here show that a 369 biomimetic system , using a reduced set of essential proteins for patch and cable 370 assembly , is sufficient to provide basic molecular explanation of differences observed 371 in cells . While one actin ( Act _ Ca ) seems inefficient in nucleating or assembling into 372 17 branched - actin networks , the other actin ( Act _ N2 ) seems to assemble in both types 373 of actin networks . However , Act _ N2 is defective in binding to tropomyosin , which is 374 an essential component for cable stability in cells , as it protects them from the action 375 of disassembly factors such as ADF / cofilin . This result highlights that the segregation 376 of actin isoforms can be influenced after filament nucleation . Although actin 377 nucleators tend to be in the spotlight , it must be stressed that most ABPs have 378 different effects on branched - and linear - actin networks and their influence needs to 379 be taken into account ( Rotty et al , 2015 ; Suarez & Kovar , 2016 ; Antkowiak et al , 380 2019 ) . Proteins like tropomyosin and ADF / cofilin stabilize linear networks of actin 381 filaments , while enhancing disassembly of branched networks . In this context , any 382 actin variant with defective binding to ADF / cofilin or tropomyosin will naturally be 383 more present within branched networks , while absent from linear ones . 384 385 Overall , the principles outlined above should be valid regardless of the mechanism 386 by which variation is brought to the specific actin , whether it is through changes in the 387 peptide sequence or through post - translational modifications . Also , from an 388 evolutionary perspective , the proposed mechanism appears to be efficient in allowing 389 the emergence of new actin isoforms associated with discrete actin functions . Our 390 model implies that a simple actin gene duplication , followed by minimal mutation in 391 one actin copy , which impairs an essential interaction with an ABP , could be 392 sufficient to trigger a global reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , whereby each 393 actin network becomes enriched in one actin isoform or the other . 394 395 We now have precise structural information on how actin interacts with many ABPs 396 ( Pollard , 2016 ; Tanaka et al , 2018 ; Fedorov et al , 1997 ; Shaaban et al , 2020 ; Baek et 397 18 al , 2008 ; Eads et al , 1998 ; Urnavicius et al , 2015 ; Otomo et al , 2005 ; Thompson et al , 398 2013 ; von der Ecken et al , 2015 ) . Careful analysis of actin - actin and actin - ABPs 399 interactions can be a powerful tool to predict which ABPs affect the roles of specific 400 actin isoforms in discrete actin networks . For example , such analysis indicates that 401 most Act _ Ca substitutions affect its interface with the Arp2 / 3 complex , providing 402 potential explanation for defective assembly into branched - actin networks . In parallel , 403 our knowledge of the molecular principles involved in the assembly of the different 404 actin networks of the cell allows us to anticipate the consequences of varying the 405 affinity between actin and an ABP . 406 407 Consequences of multiple functions deriving from a single or multiple actin 408 isoforms 409 Finally , the generation of a yeast strain carrying two different actin variants allowed 410 us to question the main differences between systems using the same actin and 411 systems using several actin isoforms to perform various actin - based functions . We 412 showed that addition of CK - 666 in strains expressing both actins Act _ Ca and Act _ N2 413 did not lead to similar cytoskeletal reorganization as in wild - type strains ( Fig . 7 414 bottom ) . While cells expressing wild - type actin can easily shift actin use from patches 415 to cables , the mechanism was less efficient for a two - actin system , indicating a 416 perturbed homeostasis of actin networks . This observation brings additional evidence 417 that assembly of both actin networks is more independent in a two - actin system . 418 Therefore , it is possible that an important difference highlighted here is that 419 organisms using a single actin for multiple actin functions have the possibility for 420 global reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , where increased assembly of a 421 specific actin network occurs at the expense of others . Conversely , for organisms 422 19 using multiple actin isoforms , the various actin assembly pathways may be 423 modulated separately , allowing for more autonomous actin networks and functions . 424 425 20 Material and methods 426 Reconstruction of ancestral protein sequences and selection of actins 427 Actin amino acid sequences from 122 different species , selected from different 428 branches of the eukaryotic tree of life to cover a wide range of variations , were 429 collected from anotated and reviewed UniProtKB / Swiss - Prot entries . For species 430 encoding more than one actin , the cytoplasmic actin with the most similar sequence 431 to S . cerevisiae actin was selected . The resulting 122 selected sequences from 432 different species were aligned using the Multiple Sequence Alignment program 433 Clustal Omega ( Madeira et al , 2019 ) in Pearson / FASTA format . The phylogenetic 434 tree of the 122 species was created based on the NCBI taxonomy using the 435 phylogenetic tree generator phyloT ( https : / / phylot . biobyte . de / ) . Ancestral actin 436 sequence reconstruction was performed from multiple sequence alignment and 437 phylogenetic tree inputs using FastML ( Ashkenazy et al , 2012 ) . 99 % of the amino 438 acids in the ancestral sequences are predicted with an accuracy > 95 % and uncertain 439 residues correspond to conservative substitutions ( Grantham score < 100 , 440 ( Grantham , 1974 ) ) . 441 442 Generation of plasmids for efficient and rapid actin gene replacement 443 We generated two plasmid backbones , which carried in succession a sequence 444 upstream of the yeast actin promoter ( - 804 to - 467 from act1 gene ) as a first site for 445 homologous recombination , a first selection marker ( URA3 or HIS3 ) , the yeast actin 446 promoter ( - 473 to 0 ) , the act1 coding sequence , a short sequence downstream of the 447 actin gene ( + 1437 to + 1703 ) , a second selection marker ( LEU2 or KanMX3 ) and 448 lastly a sequence downstream of the yeast actin gene as a second site for 449 homologous recombination ( + 1543 to + 2071 ) . The advantage of having two different 450 21 selection markers within the same plasmid is to easily select correct insertions of 451 DNA fragments from partial insertions which are more frequent when targeting an 452 essential gene like actin . These plasmids also contain four unique restriction sites : 453 PacI and XbaI , on each side of the actin gene , allowed to sub - clone easily new actin 454 coding sequences in the plasmid ; Bsu36I and AatII before and after the two sites for 455 homologous recombination , allowed to obtain linear DNA fragments for yeast 456 transformation . 457 458 The new actin genes used in this study were obtained commercially from whole gene 459 synthesis techniques ( Synbio Technologies ) . For analysis of S . cerevisiae ’s actin 460 expression effects from various nucleotide sequences , we selected multiple actin 461 nucleotide sequences from the specified species and we point mutated the 462 corresponding codons so that the translation product is S . cerevisiae ’s actin . For 463 analysis of exogenous actin expression effects , we manually changed the coding 464 sequence of S . cerevisiae ’s actin gene ( act1 ) by changing the specific codons that 465 correspond to amino acid mutations respecting the budding yeast codon usage . All 466 plasmids generated for this study are listed in Table S2 and the actin sequences are 467 given in Fig . S1 C . 468 469 Yeast strain generation 470 Actin gene replacement was performed in diploid cells . S . cerevisiae were 471 transformed using the LiAc / SS carrier DNA / PEG method ( Gietz & Schiestl , 2007 ) and 472 grown on dual selection media . Correct insertion of DNA fragments were verified by 473 PCR for all strains and sequenced . Strains were stored as heterozygous diploids and 474 22 haploid mutant strains were isolated by tetrad analysis for study . Tables S3 and S4 475 list all the haploid and diploid yeast strains used in this study . 476 477 Yeast growth assays on plates 478 For yeast growth assays , yeast cells were grown in YPD ( 2 % bacto - peptone , 1 % 479 yeast extract , 2 % dextrose ) overnight at 25ºC . Equal amounts cells were calculated 480 from log phase growing cultures were serially diluted and spotted on YPD plates . 481 Pictures of plates were taken after 2 days of growth at 25ºC . 482 483 Actin cytoskeleton organization in yeast 484  Yeast cell phalloidin staining and imaging 485 Log phase cultures in YPD medium at 25°C were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde for 2 h . 486 For CK - 666 - sensitivity assays , cells were treated with the indicated concentration of 487 CK - 666 ( Sigma - Aldrich SML0006 ) for 30 min before fixation . After fixation , cells were 488 washed twice in PBS and stained overnight with 250 nM Phalloidin - Alexa568 489 ( Invitrogen , ref . A12380 ) at 25°C . Samples were washed twice with PBS , re - 490 suspended in PBS - 70 % glycerol and directly mounted for imaging . Cells were 491 imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 X White Light Laser confocal microscope equipped 492 with a HC PL APO CS2 100x / 1 . 4NA Oil objective and a hybrid detector . Z - stack 493 images were collected every 0 . 3 µm with Las X 3 . 5 . 5 . 19976 software . 494 495  Data analysis for live imaging 496 Branched - and linear - actin network assembly in medium budded cells was assessed 497 from the intensity of actin patches and cables , respectively . Total cell cable 498 intensities were calculated from maximum intensity z - stack projections using Fiji 499 23 v . 1 . 53a . For total cell endocytic patch intensities , patches were identified using the 500 TrackMate plugin of Fiji ( Planade et al , 2019 ; Tinevez et al , 2017 ) . Patch detection 501 was corrected manually using the spot editing tool and the integrated intensity for all 502 patches was calculated from the analysis table of TrackMate . 503 Fluorescence intensity of phalloidin labeling varied between strains expressing 504 different actin variants . For this reason , the contrast of images showed in the figures 505 was adapted from strain to strain so that both actin structures remained clearly visible . 506 In addition , rather than reporting total intensities , we compared the relative assembly 507 of branched - and linear - actin networks for each strain . This choice is also motivated 508 by the fact that actin networks do not assemble independently but compete for a 509 limited pool of monomeric actin ( Burke et al , 2014 ) . We calculated an in vivo actin 510 network deviation index , defined as in ( Antkowiak et al , 2019 ) : 511 𝐼𝑛 𝑣𝑖𝑣𝑜 Actin Network Deviation Index = I patch I̅ patch , wild−type − I cable I̅ cable , wild−type I patch I̅ patch , wild−type + I cable I̅ cable , wild−type , where I patch ( resp . I cable ) is the total patch ( respectively cable ) fluorescence 512 intensity of the cell of interest , and I̅ patch , Sc ( resp . I̅ cable , Sc ) is the mean total intensity of 513 actin patches ( resp . cables ) in wild type S . cerevisiae ’s cells . This branched - to - linear 514 actin network ratio was calculated for each cell , and compared to in vivo actin 515 network deviation indexes of wild - type S . cerevisiae ’s cells . 516 For cell polarity , number of visible patches in the bud ( 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑠 𝑏𝑢𝑑 ) and in the mother 517 cell ( 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 ) were taken into account to calculate a polarity index : 518 Polarity index = 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑠 𝑏𝑢𝑑 − 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑠 𝑏𝑢𝑑 + 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 519 520 24 Quantification of actin expression levels 521 A mouse anti - Actin C4 primary antibody ( Fisher Scientific , ref . 08691002 ; 1 : 10 , 000 522 dilution ) was selected to recognize actin . Its epitope is located around amino acids 523 50 - 70 , which corresponds to a highly conserved region across all actins used in this 524 study , with the exception of position 70 ( a lysine in Homo sapiens beta actin ; an 525 arginine for all other actins ) . To test the antibody’s sensitivity to this amino acid 526 variability , different amounts of purified rabbit muscle actin , which contains a lysine in 527 position 70 and purified budding yeast actin , which contains an arginine in position 528 70 , were loaded on a 12 % gel . After protein migration , gels were transferred to a 529 nitrocellulose membrane , incubated with mouse anti - Actin C4 primary antibody 530 ( Fisher Scientific , ref . 08691002 ; 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) overnight at 4°C , then incubated 531 with a goat anti - mouse HRP antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , ref . 115 - 035 - 146 ; 532 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) for 1 h at 25°C and revealed with Western lightning plus ECL 533 reagent ( PerkinElmer , Inc . , ref . NEL104001EA ) . After the Western blots were 534 imaged , membranes were incubated with Ponceau S for 10 minutes and imaged 535 again . Immunostaining signals were compared relative to Ponceau staining signals . 536 Value of 12 measurements indicated on average a 1 . 48 - fold stronger signal for rabbit 537 muscle actin compared to S . cerevisiae’s actin . This value was used afterwards as a 538 normalization factor when comparing the expression of Act _ Hs and the expression of 539 other actins in yeast . 540 Total protein samples from S . cerevisiae strains were prepared by trichloroacetic acid 541 precipitation as described in ( Reid & Schatz , 1982 ) . 12 % SDS - PAGE gels were 542 loaded with 15 µg of total protein sample , and transferred to a nitrocellulose 543 membrane after protein migration . Actin was recognized by anti - Actin C4 primary 544 antibody ( Fisher Scientific , ref . 08691002 ; 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) . For our loading control , 545 25 we selected a rabbit anti - alpha tubulin primary antibody ( Abcam , ref . ab184970 ; 546 1 : 20 , 000 dilution ) . Western blots were incubated with goat anti - mouse HRP ( Jackson 547 ImmunoResearch , ref . 115 - 035 - 146 ; 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) and goat Anti - rabbit IgG H & L 548 ( HRP ) ( Abcam , ref . ab205718 ; 1 : 20 , 000 dilution ) secondary antibodies . Western 549 blots were revealed with Western Lightning Plus ECL reagent ( PerkinElmer , Inc . , ref . 550 NEL104001EA ) , on a ChemiDoc MP imaging system ( BioRad ) . We verified the 551 linearity of results obtained with this method over a range of 3 µg to 30 µg of total 552 extract loaded in the gels . Bands intensities were calculated using the Image Lab 553 6 . 0 . 1 software . Actin signals were relativized to the tubulin signals . The same control 554 sample was loaded in all membranes and all values were normalized to this lane . 555 556 Protein purification and labeling 557 Actins . 558 Strains expressing Act1 , Act _ N2 and Act _ Ca were used to purify the respective 559 actins . Large - scale cultures were prepared at 25°C in YPD and harvested by 560 centrifugation . Pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in a steel blender 561 ( Waring , Winsted , CT , USA ) ( Michelot & Drubin , 2014 ) . Actins were affinity - purified 562 on a DNAse I - column ( Goode , 2002 ) . Yeast powder was resuspended in G1 buffer 563 ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) containing protease 564 inhibitors ( Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set IV , Calbiochem , reference 539136 ) , and 565 centrifuged for 30 min at 160 , 000 x g at 4°C . The lysate was passed through a 566 DNase I column . Bound actin was purified and eluted with G1 buffer supplemented 567 with 50 % formamide , and dyalised against G1 buffer with less calcium ( 10 mM Tris - 568 HCl , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) overnight . Rabbit muscle actin was 569 purified from standard procedures ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . 570 26 Actin labeling . 571 G - actin from rabbit muscle was dialyzed against 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 572 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) at 4°C for 12 h . A 6 - fold - excess of Alexa Fluor 568 573 succinimidyl ester dye was added and incubated overnight . F - actin was then 574 centrifugated at 390 , 000 x g for 40 min , pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against 575 G buffer for 2 h at 4°C . Labeled actin was centrifugated at 390 , 000 x g for 40 min to 576 remove insoluble components and labeled actin was eventually loaded into a G25 577 column to remove unbound fluorophore . 578 Formin . 579 S . cerevisiae cells ( MATa , leu2 , ura3 - 52 , trp1 , prb1 - 1122 , pep4 - 3 , pre1 - 451 ) were 580 transformed with a plasmid designed for formin overexpression ( Gst - Bni1 ( 1215 - 581 Cter ) - TEV - 9xHis ) under the control of a GAL1 promoter ) ( Antkowiak et al , 2019 ) ) . 582 The expression was induced with 2 % galactose for 12 h at 30°C . The resulting 583 cultures were centrifuged and cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in a 584 steel blender . For protein purification , 5 g of yeast powder was thawed on ice with 45 585 ml of HKI10 buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ) , 586 supplemented with 50 μl of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set IV and centrifugated at 587 160 , 000 x g for 30 min . The supernatant was collected and then incubated with 500 - 588 μl of Nickel - Sepharose 6 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Piscataway , NJ , 589 USA ) for 2 h at 4°C . Protein bound to Nickel - Sepharose beads was washed with 590 HKI20 buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ) and 591 cleaved from the beads by a 1 h incubation with TEV at room temperature . The 592 protein was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 4 ml device ( Merck4Biosciences ) , 593 dialyzed against HKG buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 6 % glycerol ) , flash 594 frozen and stored - 80ºC . 595 27 596 Arp2 / 3 complex . 597 S . cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from commercially purchased baker’s 598 yeast ( L’Hirondelle ) based on a protocol modified from ( Nolen & Pollard , 2008 ; 599 Doolittle et al , 2013 ; Antkowiak et al , 2019 ) . Yeast powder was prepared by flash 600 freezing droplets of liquid yeast culture in liquid nitrogen and grinding them in a steel 601 blender . 230 g of yeast powder was resuspended in a lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl 602 pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) supplemented with Protease 603 Inhibitor Cocktail Set IV . The mixture was centrifuged at 160 , 000 x g for 30 min and 604 the supernatant was fractioned by a 50 % ammonium sulfate cut . The insoluble 605 fraction was dissolved , dialyzed in HKME buffer ( 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 606 mM EGTA , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM ATP ) overnight at 4°C and loaded onto 607 a 2 - ml Glutathione - Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Piscataway , NJ , 608 USA ) column pre - charged with GST - N - WASp - VCA ( Nolen & Pollard , 2008 ; Doolittle 609 et al , 2013 , 3 ; Antkowiak et al , 2019 ) . The column was washed with HKME buffer and 610 bound Arp2 / 3 was eluted with 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 25 mM KCl , 200 mM MgCl 2 , 1 611 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT . The presence of protein was detected by using the 612 Bradford reagant , fractions containing protein were pooled , concentrated with an 613 Amicon Ultra 4 - ml device ( Merck4Biosciences , Darmstadt , Germany ) , and dialyzed 614 against HKG buffer . Concentrated Arp2 / 3 was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept 615 at – 80°C . 616 617 WASp ( Las17 ) , Capping Protein , ADF / cofilin and Profilin . 618 Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells were transformed with a plasmid designed for S . 619 cerevisiae Las17 ( Gst - Las17 ( 375 - Cter ) - 6xHis ) overexpression . Bacterial cells were 620 28 collected by centrifugation and then lysed in 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 1 621 mM EDTA , 200 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 % glycerol and protease inhibitors 622 ( Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , Roche ) . The lysate was centrifuged at 623 160 , 000 x g for 20 min , the supernatant incubated with Glutathione - Sepharose 624 beads , and the protein was purified from the extract . Bound proteins were then eluted 625 with 100 mM L - glutathione reduced and subjected to a second purification by 626 addition of Nickel - Sepharose beads 6 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , 627 Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . The protein was eluted with HKI500 buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 628 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 500 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ) , concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 4 - 629 ml device and dialyzed against HKG buffer . Protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen 630 and kept at – 80°C . 631 S . cerevisiae capping protein , ADF / cofilin and profilin were purified as in ( Gressin et 632 al , 2015 ) . Briefly , proteins were overexpressed in Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells . 633 Cultures were lysed , centrifuged and supernatant were incubated with Nickel - 634 Sepharose beads 6 Fast Flow in HKI20 buffer ( 20mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 20 635 mM imidazole pH 7 . 5 , 0 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol ) . Proteins were eluted with 636 HKI500 buffer and dyalized against HKG buffer . They were then flash frozen in liquid 637 nitrogen and kept at – 80°C . 638 The labeling of ADF / cofilin was performed using an ADF / cofilin D34C mutant 639 ( Gressin et al , 2015 ) . Yeast ADF / cofilin D34C mutant was bound to Nickel - 640 Sepharose beads 6 Fast Flow as described above for the wild - type protein . A 5 fold - 641 excess of Alexa Fluor 488 C5 - maleimide ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was added 642 overnight at 4°C . Bound protein was cleared from unbound fluorophore before elution 643 in HKI500 buffer , dialyzed against HKG buffer , flash frozen and kept at – 80°C . 644 645 29 Tropomyosin . 646 Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells were transformed with a plasmid designed for S . 647 cerevisiae tropomyosin Tpm1p overexpression . This tropomyosin was modified to 648 contain an Ala - Ser extension at the N - terminal , which mimics its acetylation , and was 649 purified based on a protocol modified from ( Skau et al , 2009 ) . Briefly , bacteria 650 overexpressing tropomyosin were lysed by sonication in a buffer ( 50 mM imidazole - 651 HCl , pH 6 . 9 , 300 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) 652 supplemented with protease inhibitors ( Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , 653 Roche ) ) . Cells were then boiled for 10 min , and the resulting mixture was 654 centrifugated at 300 , 000 x g for 20 min . The supernatant which contains pure 655 tropomyosin was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against a dialysis buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 10 656 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Tpm1p labeling was performed with the 657 same strategy used for fission yeast tropomyosin Cdc8 labeling ( Christensen et al , 658 2017 ) . We mutated tpm1 ' s histidine 114 by site directed mutagenesis to introduce a 659 cysteine ( H114C ) . Immediately after tropomyosin Ala - Ser - Tpm1p H114C purification , 660 the protein was labeled by incubation with a 5 - fold excess Alexa Fluor 488 C5 - 661 maleimide over tropomyosin overnight at 4°C , and separated on a Sephadex G - 25 662 gel filtration column . The purified fluorescent protein was flash frozen in liquid 663 nitrogen and kept at – 80°C . 664 665 Branched - and linear - actin network assembly from microbeads 666 Functionalization of beads . 667 Polystyrene microspheres ( 2 µm diameter , 2 . 5 % solid ( w / v ) aqueous suspension , 668 Polysciences , Inc ) were washed with HK buffer ( 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl ) , 669 diluted 10 times and incubated with 1 µM Las17 for 30 min on ice . Beads were 670 30 saturated with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 15 min , washed and stored on ice 671 in HK buffer supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA . Similarly , glutathione - coated particles 672 ( 4 . 37 µm diameter , 0 . 5 % solid ( w / v ) aqueous suspension , Spherotech , Inc ) were 673 coated with GST - Bni1 ( 1 µM ) and then saturated with 1 % BSA , washed and stored in 674 HK 0 . 1 % BSA . 675 676 Branched and linear network reconstitution . 677 Unlabeled and fluorescent actins were mixed to reach a final concentration of 40 µM 678 and a labeling percentage of 1 % . Actin polymerization was induced by the addition of 679 G - Buffer and 1x KMEI ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole 680 Fluorescence Blank pH 7 . 8 ) for 1 h at RT . Las17 - and Bni1 - coated beads were 681 incubated with F - actin and a minimal set of proteins in a motility buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 5 682 mM Hepes , 2 . 4 mM MgCl 2 ; 4 mM DTT ; 1 mM ATP ; 0 . 36 % methylcellulose 1500 cP 683 and 1 . 5 % BSA ) which triggers actin assembly . Standard optimal protein 684 concentrations were 8 µM F - actin , 15 µM profilin , 1 µM capping protein , 500 nM 685 Arp2 / 3 complex and 600 nM ADF / cofilin . When fluorescent proteins were used , their 686 concentrations were 600 nM for Alexa 488 - ADF / cofilin ( in which case no black 687 ADF / cofilin was added ) and 1 µM for Alexa 488 - tropomyosin . 688 689 Image acquisition , processing and analysis . 690 Images of several beads were acquired 30 min . after the initiation of the experiment 691 on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 equipped with a 100x / 1 . 4NA Oil Ph3 Plan - Apochromat 692 objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash 4 . 0LT camera . Images were acquired with 693 Zen 2 . 3 blue edition using the same light intensity and exposure time . 694 695 31 Data quantification for biomimetic assays . 696 Fluorescence intensity of actin networks and fluorescent ABPs was quantified using 697 Fiji ( Version 1 . 52p ) , and fluorescence of the background was substracted . Similarly 698 to the in vivo actin network deviation index , a linear - to - branched ratio was calculated 699 to compare the efficiency of actin assembly in vitro for both branched - and linear - 700 networks of actin filaments for a given biochemical condition . This index measures 701 how actin assembly between branched and linear networks deviates from the values 702 obtained when S . cerevisiae actin is used . It is defined as follows : 703 𝑰𝒏 𝒗𝒊𝒕𝒓𝒐 𝑨𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒏 𝑵𝒆𝒕𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌 𝑫𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑰𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒙 = 𝑰 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 𝑰 𝑺𝒄 , 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 − 𝑰 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝑰 𝑺𝒄 , 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝑰 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 𝑰 𝑺𝒄 , 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 + 𝑰 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝑰 𝑺𝒄 , 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 Where 𝑰 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 is the average normalized intensity of the branched network for all 704 Las17 beads with a given actin , 𝑰 𝑺𝒄 , 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 is the same value for S . cerevisiae actin , 705 𝑰 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 is the average normalized intensity of the linear network for all Bni beads with 706 a given actin and 𝑰 𝑺𝒄 , 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 is the same value for S . cerevisiae actin . 707 708 Actin - ABP contact analysis 709 The amino acid positions of the substitutions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae 710 ( Act _ Sc ) , Node 2 ( Act _ N2 ) , and Candida albicans ( Act _ Ca ) actin sequences were 711 inspected within high resolution X - ray crystal and cryoEM structures of complexes 712 containing actin . The PDB accession codes are : G - actin ( 1YAG ) ( Vorobiev et al , 713 2003 ) , F - actin ( 6DJN ) ( Chou & Pollard , 2019 ) , ADF / cofilin ( 5YU8 and 1CFY ) ( Tanaka 714 et al , 2018 ; Fedorov et al , 1997 ) ) , Arp2 / 3 daughter filament ( 6W17 ) ( Shaaban et al , 715 2020 ) , profilin ( 1YPR and 3CHW ) ( Baek et al , 2008 ; Eads et al , 1998 ) ; CP / Arp1 716 ( 5ADX ) ( Urnavicius et al , 2015 ) , WH2 ( 5YPU ) , formin ( 1Y64 and 4EAH ) ( Otomo et al , 717 32 2005 ; Thompson et al , 2013 ) and tropomyosin ( 5JLF ) ( von der Ecken et al , 2016 ) . 718 Actin residues that are within 5 Å of the binding protein were identified in the CCP4 719 program CONTACT ( Winn et al , 2011 ) , with the exception of the Arp2 / 3 mother 720 filament which were within 10 Å since the coordinates were not released when this 721 study was performed ( Fäßler et al , 2020 ) . All contacts were visually inspected in 722 COOT ( Emsley et al , 2010 ) . 723 724 Data availability 725 This study includes no data deposited in external repositories . 726 727 Data reproducibility 728 All experiments were repeated at least two times . In all plots , error bars indicate 729 standard deviations . As standard deviations were not similar for all experiments , we 730 used Brown - Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests , with Dunnett’s T3 multiple 731 comparisons tests . P value style : * < 0 . 05 , * * < 0 . 01 , * * * < 0 . 001 . Correlations were 732 computed with a two - tailed p value and a confidence interval of 95 % , correlation 733 coefficients r correspond to Pearson correlation coefficients . 734 For the colony area measurements , colonies were measured from 2 plates , results 735 were normalized to control and pulled together . More than 10 colonies per strain 736 were quantified . For western blot measurements , 2 independent samples per strain 737 were loaded twice each and analyzed . For phalloidin stained cells , 30 cells were 738 measured per strain . For the in vitro polymerization assays , at least 14 beads were 739 measured from two independent experiments , and data presented in the manuscript 740 correspond to the two sets of experiments pulled together . 741 742 33 743 Acknowledgements 744 The authors thank Isabelle Sagot and Emilia Mauriello for their invaluable advice on 745 the project , and Sarah Würbel for her technical help .

( Top ) A model of the molecular 1079 mechanisms by which two actin isoforms may segregate to different actin networks . 1080 On the left , a system carrying wild - type actin is able to generate both the branched - 1081 and linear - networks . On the two central panels , defective interactions of an actin 1082 isoform with one or several ABPs , affect branched - or linear - network assembly . On 1083 the right , combining these two actin variants in one cell should trigger a natural 1084 segregation of actins and rescues the wild type actin organization . ( Bottom ) Effect of 1085 perturbing an actin assembly pathway for cells using one or two actin variants . On 1086 the left , when one actin is shared for two actin functions , the inhibition of one actin 1087 assembly pathway ( for example branched - networks with CK - 666 ) leads to a 1088 reinforcement of the other actin assembly pathway . On the right , when two actin 1089 variants are used for two different actin functions , this effect is limited as both actin 1090 networks assemble more independently . In other words , having a system with two 1091 actin variants can buffer against the addition of the drug . 1092 1093 1094 Supplementary Figures legends 1095 Figure S1 , related to Figure 1 .

C4 actin antibody has a higher affinity for rabbit muscle actin than 1126 for S . cerevisiae actin . ( A ) The binding site of the C4 antibody , indicated as 1127 “C4 _ Epitope” , is found on Act _ Hs and on rabbit muscle actin . In all other actin 1128 variants used in this study , the sequence varies of one amino acid ( called here 1129 “Mutated _ Epitope” ) but is recognized by C4 antibody . ( B ) Western blot with 1130 equivalent amounts of purified yeast actin and rabbit actin . The amount of protein 1131 was revealed by two methods : Ponceau staining and chemiluminescence . The 1132 chemiluminescence signal corresponds to the one produced by the secondary 1133 antibody after incubation with a primary antibody anti - actin C4 and a secondary 1134 antibody conjugated with HRP . ( C ) Quantification of ( B ) indicates that 1135 immunolabeling of rabbit muscle actin with C4 antibody leads to a 1 . 48 - fold more 1136 intense signal than immunolabeling of S . cerevisiae actin . 1137 1138 1139 Tables legends 1140 Table 1 .
