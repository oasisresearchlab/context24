Findings : Based on the parent CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey ( CRISIS ) of 314 females and 514 males aged 5 - 21 , youth with anxiety disorders were more likely to avoid high - risk exposure settings , and those with ADHD ( combined type ) were less likely to follow hygiene practices . In contrast , mask wearing was not associated with youth mental disorders . Meaning : Specific types of disorders in youth may interfere with their ability to employ risk - mitigation strategies that may lead to greater susceptibility to COVID - 19 . Abstract Importance : Although studies of adults show that pre - existing mental disorders increase risk for COVID - 19 infection and severity , there is limited information about this association among youth . Mental disorders in general as well as specific types of disorders may influence their ability to comply with risk - mitigation strategies to reduce COVID - 19 infection and transmission . Objective : To examine associations between specific mental disorders and COVID - 19 risk - mitigation practices among 314 female and 514 male youth . Design : Youth compliance ( rated as “Never , ” “Sometimes , ” “Often , ” or “Very often / Always” ) with risk mitigation was reported by parents on the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey ( CRISIS ) in January 2021 . Responses were summarized using factor analysis of risk mitigation , and their associations with lifetime mental disorders ( assessed via structured diagnostic interviews ) were identified with linear regression analyses ( adjusted for covariates ) . All analyses used R Project for Statistical Computing for Mac ( v . 4 . 0 . 5 ) . Setting : The Healthy Brain Network ( HBN ) in New York City Participants . 314 female and 514 male youth ( ages 5 - 21 ) Main Outcome ( s ) and Measure ( s ) : COVID - 19 risk mitigation behaviors among youth Results : A two - factor model was the best - fitting solution . Factor 1 ( avoidance behaviors ) included avoiding groups , indoor settings , and other peoples’ homes ; avoidance was more likely among youth with any anxiety disorder ( p = . 01 ) . Factor 2 ( hygiene behaviors ) included using hand sanitizer , washing hands , and maintaining social distance ; practicing hygiene was less likely among youth with ADHD ( combined type ) ( p = . 02 ) . Mask wearing , which did not load on either factor , was not associated with any mental health disorder . Conclusion and Relevance : Findings suggest that education and monitoring of risk - mitigation strategies in certain subgroups of youth may reduce risk of exposure to COVID - 19 and other contagious diseases . Additionally , they highlight the need for greater attention to vaccine prioritization for individuals with ADHD . Keywords : risk mitigation , COVID - 19 , youth , CRISIS , anxiety , ADHD .

SARS - CoV - 2 is a highly contagious virus that transmits mainly through inhalation of airborne droplets and transfer from direct contact with surfaces that are contaminated . Public health officials across the world initially responded to this threat by urging people to follow several risk - mitigation strategies to reduce the chance of infection and transmission . Adults and children alike were urged to avoid close contact , maintain at least 6 - feet of physical distance from others , wear face masks in public , engage in frequent and intensive hand washing , adhere to stay - at - home orders , and self - isolate when exhibiting symptoms of infection 1 . Such efforts have been associated with a reduction in COVID - 19 transmission 2 - 4 . There is growing evidence regarding the potential impact of mental health disorders on COVID - 19 risk . Studies of adults show that pre - existing mental disorders are associated with increased risk of COVID - 19 infection 5 , severity 6 - 9 , and mortality 7 - 12 . A recent study showed that individuals with substance use disorders are also at increased risk of COVID - 19 infection , hospitalization , and death 8 , 9 . These findings have been largely confirmed by several meta - analyses 7 - 9 , 13 . Accordingly , the Centers for Disease Control designated mental and behavioral health disorders among the pre - existing conditions that increase vulnerability to COVID - 19 illness . An important effect of this recognition is greater priority in receiving vaccines and boosters as they are rolled out , which help to protect individuals and reduce community spread . Included in this list are disorders that typically affect children , such as neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder and ADHD . However , there is scant research on the role of mental disorders in COVID - 19 vulnerability among youth . One recent study of electronic health records among patients ( aged 2 months to 103 years ) in Israel found that COVID - 19 infection was associated with ADHD ( but no other psychiatric diagnosis examined ) , male gender , age below 20 years , and low - medium SES group 14 . Interestingly , the association between ADHD and COVID - 19 infection in this sample was especially elevated among youth ( ages 5 - 20 ) and untreated ADHD cases of any age . Additional research on youth with a range of mental disorders is needed to understand the potential mechanisms associated with COVID - 19 vulnerability . In particular , the ability of youth to adhere to risk - mitigating practices may differ by the key phenomena underlying mental disorders such as inattention , anxiety , fear , impulsivity , etc . To our knowledge , no studies have investigated COVID - 19 risk - mitigation adherence among youth with mental disorders . The purpose of this study was to examine associations between COVID - 19 risk - mitigation practices and specific mental disorders among female and male youth from the Healthy Brain Network ( HBN ) in the New York City metropolitan area . Methods Sample Participants were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Brain Network ( HBN ) initiative that seeks to create and share a 10 , 000 - participant biobank of data from children and adolescents ages 5 – 21 from the New York City area 15 . Data collected includes psychiatric , cognitive , behavioral , genetic , and lifestyle information as well as MRI and EEG neuroimaging . The HBN collection sites are on Staten Island , in Midtown Manhattan , and in Harlem . As part of the HBN survey battery , participants and their parents / guardians completed a variety of age - based questionnaires assessing basic demographic characteristics , dimensional assessments of domains associated with mental health , substance use , and .

For participants under the age of 11 , a trained research assistant read and explained individual items and collected responses from participants . HBN’s latest data release includes 4139 participants ; data are available to researchers by registering for a data usage agreement ( http : / / fcon _ 1000 . projects . nitrc . org / indi / cmi _ healthy _ brain _ network / Pheno _ Access . html # DUA ) . Between April and July 2020 ( Wave 1 ) , parents of HBN participants were invited to complete the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey ( CRISIS ) 16 about their child via Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) . The CRISIS was designed and piloted at the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic to assess mental and behavioral health , lifestyle behaviors , and sources of stress induced by the COVID - 19 epidemic . In total , parents of 1780 HBN participants completed the Wave 1 survey . Parents were then invited to complete a modified version of the CRISIS in January 2021 ( Wave 2 ) . The Wave 2 modifications included questions on frequency of compliance with COVID - 19 risk - mitigation practices . The current study sample included 314 female and 514 male participants ( ages 5 - 21 ) whose parents completed the CRISIS at Wave 2 . Measures Measures derived from HBN participation included child age at Wave 2 , sex , race / ethnicity , family structure , family socioeconomic status ( SES ) , and consensus diagnosis . Child age , sex , race / ethnicity ( Caucasian , African American , Hispanic , Asian ) , and family structure ( indicator of single caregiver household ) were reported by parents / caregivers during a structured clinical history interview . Family SES was measured by the Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status , which is based on parent / caregiver reports of parent / caregiver education and occupation 17 . Continuous scores are generated with higher scores indicating higher SES . In single caregiver families , scores were based on that caregiver alone . SES scores were subsequently grouped into tertiles to determine low , middle , and high SES . Diagnostic interviews were conducted using the computerized Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia 18 that was administered to parents by an experienced research clinician or social worker . Following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM - 5 ) criteria , consensus lifetime diagnosis was achieved by two study psychiatrists based on these interviews and other symptomatic information such as standardized rating scales . Up to 10 separate diagnoses were allowed per participant . Diagnoses were grouped into the following categories : attention deficit hyperactivity disorder inattentive / hyperactive type [ ADHD - I ) , ADHD combined type ( ADHD - C ) , autism spectrum disorder , any depressive disorder ( major depressive disorder [ MDD ] , persistent depressive disorder [ PDD ] , disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [ DMDD ] , depressive disorder due to another medical condition , unspecified depressive disorder , substance / medication - induced depressive disorder , other specified depressive disorder , other ( or Unknown ) substance - induced disorders ) , any anxiety disorder ( unspecified anxiety disorder , generalized anxiety disorder [ GAD ] , separation anxiety , social anxiety , specific phobia , agoraphobia , panic disorder , selective mutism , other specified anxiety disorder ) , and any other behavior disorder ( oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder , intermittent explosive disorder , or other specified disruptive , impulse - control disorder ) . Seven separate COVID - 19 risk - mitigation practices among youth were measured via parent report at Wave 2 of CRISIS administration . Specifically , parents were asked with respect to the past two weeks “To what extent has your child been taking the following steps to prevent infection or spread of the .

Wearing a mask or face covering in public ; Wearing gloves in public ; Washing hands ; Using hand sanitizer ; Staying at least six feet away from others ; Avoiding visits to other people’s homes ; Avoiding group in - person activities ; Avoiding indoor public places ( e . g . , stores ) when possible . ” Responses were rated as “Never , ” “Sometimes , ” “Often , ” or “Very often / Always . ” Analysis Primary analyses were conducted using the parent CRISIS survey conducted in January 2021 . This survey was limited to the 1578 past HBN participants ( 2015 - 2020 ; total : 3600 ) that completed an initial survey in April - June 2020 ( Wave 1 ) . 955 parents completed the survey in 2021 . Participants that did not complete enough of the HBN study to yield a consensus DSM diagnostic profile based on the KSADS - COMP and licensed clinical evaluators , were removed . Five participants with missing Barratt data were also removed . The final analytic sample comprised 314 female and 514 male participants between ages 5 - 21 years ( N = 828 ) . Sample characteristics did not differ by study - completion status ( see Supplement ) . All statistical analyses were conducted using The R Project for Statistical Computing for Mac 19 . Responses to the 7 risk - mitigation practices were summarized using factor analysis , and model fitness was evaluated by parallel analysis . Associations between the resulting factors and lifetime mental disorders were identified with linear regression analyses . Three models were used in the analysis : unadjusted , adjusted for demographics ( age , sex , SES , single caregiver , and race ) , and additionally adjusted for comorbid mental disorders . Each factor underwent the three - model analysis to examine the associations between specific mental disorders and each derived factor of risk - mitigation behaviors . Results Table 1 presents the number and percentages of youth who “very often / always” engaged in the 7 risk - mitigation behaviors , by demographic characteristics . Overall , the percentage of mask wearing “very often / always” was high ( 90 % ) , and higher in females , African Americans , and Hispanics . The overall percentage of “very often / always” maintaining social distance , using hand sanitizer , and washing hands was 46 % , 46 % , and 59 % , respectively . These behaviors differed significantly by race , as the percentages were elevated among African Americans and Hispanics and lower among Caucasians . Further , maintaining social distancing “very often / always” was positively associated with age and negatively associated with SES , as was washing hands “very often / always . ” The overall percentages of avoiding other people’s homes , avoiding in - person groups , and avoiding indoor public places “very often / always” was 58 % , 46 % , and 43 % , respectively . These were highly similar across demographic factors . The correlations among the risk - mitigation items appear in Figure 1 . All correlations were positive and ranged from 0 . 09 to 0 . 63 . Mask wearing correlated weakly ( r < 0 . 31 ) with all other items . Maintaining social distance correlated moderately ( r = 0 . 38 to r = 0 . 44 ) with using hand sanitizer , avoiding other people’s homes , avoiding in - person groups , and avoiding indoor public places , and washing hands . Using hand sanitizer correlated strongly ( r > 0 . 63 ) with washing hands and weakly ( r < 0 . 14 ) with avoiding other people’s homes , avoiding in - person groups , and avoiding indoor public places . Washing hands correlated weakly ( r < 0 . 21 ) with avoiding other people’s homes , avoiding in - person groups , and avoiding indoor public places . The three avoidance items – avoiding other people’s homes , avoiding in - person groups , and avoiding indoor public places – were moderately to strongly intercorrelated ( r = 0 . 53 to r = 0 . 60 ) . .

That is , a two - factor solution explained more variance than what would be expected due to chance based on a null distribution of eigenvalues . Results from the factor analyses are shown in Figure 3 . The first factor ( avoidance behaviors ) included avoiding groups , indoor settings , and other peoples’ homes . This factor accounted for 27 . 7 % of the cumulative variance . The second factor ( hygiene behaviors ) included using hand sanitizer , washing hands , and maintaining social distance . The addition of this factor increased the cumulative variance explained to 49 . 8 % . Mask wearing loaded poorly on each factor , a finding consistent with the weak individual correlations with this item . Further , its inclusion to the model did not meaningfully improve the fit or the amount of variance explained . For these reasons , mask wearing was analyzed subsequently as a separate item . Table 2 presents the results from the regression analyses examining associations between the two resulting factors ( and , separately , mask wearing ) and mental disorders . The table presents results from the unadjusted model , the model ( a ) adjusted for demographics , and the model ( b ) adjusted for demographic variables and comorbid mental disorders . Focusing on the fully adjusted model ( b ) , several of the demographic variables were significant covariates ( results not shown ) . African American race was positively associated with both avoidance behaviors and hygiene behaviors . Age , Hispanic race , other race , or nondisclosed race were positively associated with hygiene behaviors . Male sex was positively associated with mask wearing . As shown in Table 2 , the two factors were associated with specific mental disorders . The avoidance behaviors were more likely among youth with any anxiety disorder , a finding that was significant in the unadjusted model ( p = . 008 ) , the model that adjusted for demographic variables ( p = . 01 ) , and the model that adjusted for demographics and comorbid disorders ( p = . 01 ) . No other disorder was significantly associated with this factor . The hygiene behaviors were less likely among youth with ADHD - C in the unadjusted model ( p = . 01 ) , the model that adjusted for demographic variables ( p = . 02 ) , and the model that adjusted for demographics and comorbid disorders ( p = . 02 ) . Hygiene behaviors were negatively associated with depression , but only in the unadjusted model ( p = . 04 ) . Analyzed as a separate item , mask wearing was less likely among youth with ADHD - C in the unadjusted model ( p = . 03 ) . However , this association was not significant after adjusting for demographics and comorbid disorders . No other mental disorder was significantly associated with mask wearing . Discussion The importance of risk - mitigation measures in reducing exposure and severe disease have been one of the most important public health measures in response to the prolonged nature of the COVID - 19 pandemic , now entering its third year . Physical distancing , avoiding touch , washing hands frequently and intensively , wearing a face mask in public , staying at home , and maintaining quarantine have been particularly challenging for youth with mental disorders . Here we report two important findings regarding the association between compliance with different risk - mitigation factors with different types of disorders . First , the COVID - 19 risk - mitigation behaviors tended to cluster into two factors : avoidance behaviors ( avoiding groups , indoor settings , and other peoples’ homes ) and hygiene behaviors ( using hand sanitizer , washing hands , and maintaining social distance ) . Second , the tendency to practice these behaviors differed by specific mental disorders . Avoidance was more likely among youth with any anxiety disorder , whereas practicing hygiene was less likely among youth with ADHD - C . Mask wearing was largely unrelated to other risk - mitigation behaviors and , when examined as a separate item , was .

Our findings add to the limited research on the role of mental disorders in COVID - 19 risk among youth , despite ample evidence showing that children and adolescents with mental disorders are at increased risk of myriad physical diseases 20 . In particular , ADHD has been shown increase risk of inflammatory and immune - related disorders including asthma , eczema , certain allergies 21 - 24 , respiratory infections and influenza 12 , and several preventable negative outcomes including sexually transmitted infections , accidental injuries , and injury - related mortality 25 - 27 . Psychosocial stress , anxiety , negative affect , and depression are also associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infections as well as poorer clinical prognosis 28 . Depression has been associated with an increased risk of a developing a wide range of infections 29 including sexually transmitted diseases and poorer outcomes thereof 30 , 31 . Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders are at increased risk of several medical conditions including immunological , gastroenterological , neurological , and other medical complaints 22 . This work provides some insight into the increased risk by showing that youth with specific mental disorders are more ( or less ) likely to engage in certain COVID - 19 risk - mitigation behaviors . There are several potential mechanisms for our findings . Youth with anxiety disorders , who were more likely to practice avoidance behaviors , may be so inclined because avoidance is a central characteristic of many anxiety disorders including social phobia , agoraphobia , social anxiety disorder , and generalized anxiety disorder . Avoidance - related manifestations of anxiety disorder may serve to mitigate COVID - 19 vulnerability by reducing social contacts with others in groups , indoor settings , and other peoples’ homes . The failure to comply with hygiene behaviors among youth with ADHD - C may occur through other mechanisms . Youth with ADHD - C , where both inattention and hyperactivity / impulsivity are present , may be less capable of complying with 6 - foot distance rules and hand - cleaning practices . This may help explain the finding reported by Merzon and colleagues 14 that youth with ADHD are at increased risk of COVID - 19 infection , and that the association was greater for untreated than treated ADHD . Several non - significant findings are notable as well . Although youth with ASD can sometimes struggle with daily living skills including maintaining personal hygiene 32 that may lead to lower compliance with hand washing and using hand sanitizer , we did not observe this finding . Youth with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder , who tend to disregard social rules , were no more or less likely to consistently engage in harm - mitigation behaviors . We similarly found no independent association between depressive disorders and risk - mitigation behaviors . In summary , these interpretations are suggestive and warrant further research . Aside from risk - mitigation compliance , there are other mechanisms by which pre - existing mental and behavioral health disorders may increase COVID - 19 vulnerability . These include increased exposure to COVID - 19 at home or at school due to greater household or community density , greater susceptibility due to enhanced physical disease vulnerability as described above , or poorer general health status related to obesity , physical inactivity , or familial exposure to smoking . Future research on COVID - 19 vulnerability should incorporate the full range of risk factors for COVID - 19 infection as well as compliance with COVID - 19 risk - mitigation behaviors . To further reduce COVID - 19 incidence and community transmission , it is crucial to identify risk factors for COVID infection in youth . Although some research shows that young children are less susceptible to infection than adults 33 - 35 , other research shows that children may be as likely as adults to become .

In fact , a recent epidemiologic study 37 of a pediatric sample in Virginia reported a SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate ( 8 . 5 % ) that was higher than a sample of adults ( 2 . 4 % ) from a similar region and period 38 . Further , children appear to play a role in community transmission through their social interactions and hygienic habits 33 , a finding that underscores the importance of risk - mitigation strategies among youth especially as the COVID - 19 pandemic continues to evolve and become even more transmissible , as in the case of the most recent circulating variant ( Omicron ) . Indeed , a recent experiment found that the Omicron variant survives longer than other variants on plastic and skin , a factor that may have contributed to the rapid community spread of Omicron 39 . Taken together , findings further underscore the importance of being vigilant about risk - mitigation behaviors to combat vulnerability to COVID - 19 infection and transmission . This work provides novel information on the associations between mental disorders and COVID - 19 risk - mitigation behaviors in youth . Reduced practice of prevention measures among those with specific types of disorders highlights the need to gain greater insight into the specific difficulties underlying the reduced compliance observed here . Risk - mitigation education could then be tailored to the specific components of these conditions that reduce compliance efforts . It may also be worthwhile to consider prioritizing vaccinations among individuals with mental and neurodevelopmental disorders 40 that may reduce their ability to prevent exposure . .
