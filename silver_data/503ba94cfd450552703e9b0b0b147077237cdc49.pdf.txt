Talin - vinculin association could reinforce actin anchoring to FAs by controlling actin polymerization . However , the actin polymerization activity of the talin - vinculin complex is not known because it requires the reconstitution of the mechanical and biochemical activation steps that control the association of talin and vinculin and the exposure of their actin - binding domains . By combining kinetic and binding assays with single actin filament observations in TIRF microscopy , we show that the association of talin and vinculin mutants , mimicking different degrees of activation , results in a variety of activities . In particular , mechanically stretched talin and activated vinculin combine to stimulate actin assembly synergistically through a sequential mechanism in which filaments are nucleated , capped and released to elongate . Our findings suggest a versatile mechanism for the regulation of actin assembly in FAs subjected to various combinations of biochemical and mechanical cues . Keywords : adhesion , actin , talin , vinculin 3 Introduction To migrate efficiently in different tissues , cells must sense and adapt to variations of the mechanical properties of their environment . In this adaptive process , focal adhesions ( FAs ) can strengthen their link with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and the actomyosin stress fibers ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2013 ; Gardel et al . , 2010 ; Geiger et al . , 2009 ) . FAs are composed of transmembrane integrins that mechanically couple the ECM to the actomyosin cytoskeleton , via a variety of actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) ( Bachmann et al . , 2019 ; Ciobanasu et al . , 2013 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Romero et al . , 2020 ) . The mechanical coupling of stress fibers to FAs is highly regulated . The anchoring of actin filaments to FAs can be modulated by the degree of engagement of a molecular clutch composed of sliding layers of interacting proteins , including ABPs ( Gardel et al . , 2010 ; Hu et al . , 2007 ) . The regulation of the polymerization of the actin filaments that compose the stress fibers may also determine the level of their mechanical coupling to FAs ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , FAs associated with elongating dorsal stress fibers are associated with low traction forces , whereas FAs associated with non - elongating ventral stress fibers are associated with high traction forces ( Tojkander et al . , 2015 ) . This inverse correlation between the elongation of the actin filaments and the transmission of force to the ECM sheds light on the importance of force - dependent ABPs which control actin assembly in FAs . Biochemical and cellular studies have described a variety of ABPs associated with FAs that regulate the elongation of actin filament barbed ends . Early in vitro studies showed that the vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) nucleates actin filaments and assembles them into bundles ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) . More recent studies demonstrate that VASP can also elongate actin filament barbed ends in a processive manner ( Breitsprecher et al . , 2011 , 2008 ; Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . Similarly , a series of studies suggested that formins are involved in the processive elongation of stress fibers in cells ( Hotulainen and Lappalainen , 2006 ; Tojkander et al . , 2011 ) . Talin and vinculin , which associate in response to the actomyosin force , could link force sensing to the control of actin polymerization in FAs . Vinculin is an autoinhibited ABP in which the single actin - binding domain ( ABD ) , called vinculin tail ( V t ) , is masked by an intramolecular interaction with vinculin head ( V h ) ( Johnson and Craig , 1995 ) . Biochemical studies showed that isolated V t binds actin filaments and assembles them into bundles ( Huttelmaier et al . , 1997 ; Janssen et al . , 2006 ) . We showed that V t also caps actin filament barbed ends and nucleates actin filaments ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . All these activities of V t are masked by V h in the autoinhibited conformation of vinculin . Talin is a large ABP composed of a FERM domain , subdivided into F0 , F1 , F2 , F3 , 4 and a rod domain made of 13 helical bundles ( R1 to R13 ) ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2013 ) . The two major intramolecular interactions F3 - R9 and F2 - R12 keep talin in an autoinhibited form ( Dedden et al . , 2019 ; Goult et al . , 2009 ) . Talin contains three ABDs . ABD1 , ABD2 and ABD3 correspond to the head ( F2F3 ) , the central region ( R4 - R8 ) and the last C - terminal bundle ( R13 ) respectively ( Hemmings et al . , 1996 ) . We previously demonstrated that the N - terminal ABD1 of talin blocks the elongation of actin filament barbed ends in low ionic strength conditions , whereas ABD2 and ABD3 do not affect actin dynamics ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 ) . Full - length talin is inactive because ABD1 is inhibited by the F3 - R9 intramolecular interaction . Biochemical and structural studies revealed the presence of 11 vinculin binding sites ( VBSs ) buried in some of the 13 helical bundles of talin ( Gingras et al . , 2005 ) . The stretching of single molecules of talin revealed that force exposes several of these 11 cryptic VBSs along talin rod domain ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ; Goult et al . , 2018 ; Yao et al . , 2016 ) . Using an in vitro reconstitution approach , we demonstrated that the actomyosin force is sufficient to stretch talin , allowing its binding to vinculin ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2014 ) . The release of talin autoinhibition also favors the low - affinity constitutive binding of vinculin ( Atherton et al . , 2020 ) . In order for the V h domain of vinculin to interact with talin VBSs , it is necessary to release it from its autoinhibitory interaction with V t ( Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) . Although the mechanism of activation of vinculin is not fully understood , several studies show that once vinculin is bound to talin , the interaction of V t with actomyosin keeps vinculin under tension in its open conformation ( Carisey et al . , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ; Grashoff et al . , 2010 ; Hirata et al . , 2014 ; Humphries et al . , 2007 ) . In this mechanism , the actomyosin - dependent talin - vinculin complex acts as a catch - bond that releases V t to strengthen the anchoring to actomyosin whose contraction initially induced its formation ( Atherton et al . , 2015 ; Ciobanasu et al . , 2014 ; Hirata et al . , 2014 ) . Because force is required to trigger vinculin association to talin , and because the two proteins are autoinhibited , it has so far been impossible to determine the ability of the talin - vinculin complex to regulate actin polymerization . Here , we designed a series of talin and vinculin mutants that associate constitutively into a stable complex . By combining kinetic studies in fluorescence spectroscopy , actin binding assays and single actin filament observations in TIRF microscopy , we determined the activities of these mutants and their complexes on actin binding and polymerization . Altogether our data reveal a force - dependent mechanism of actin assembly in FAs . 5 Results The release of the two autoinhibitory contacts of vinculin allows F - actin binding and barbed - end capping but not nucleation . Before starting the study of the talin - vinculin complex , we deciphered the complex mechanism that links the autoinhibition of vinculin and its activities . Indeed , biochemical and structural studies have revealed that the auto - inhibition of vinculin is controlled by two interfaces between V t and the D1 and D4 subdomains of the head ( Bakolitsa et al . , 2004 ; Cohen et al . , 2005 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 1A ) . In order to disrupt specifically both autoinhibitory interfaces , we designed a series of point mutations of amino acids in D1 and D4 that interact with V t . Because the contact surface between V t and D1 is significantly larger than the D4 - V t one , we mutated two separate groups of charged amino acids in the D1 - V t interface : E28K , D33H referred to as V 1a and D110H , R113E referred to as V 1b ( Figure 1A ) . Their combination is referred to as V 1ab . In D4 , we designed a double mutation N773I , E775K called V 4 ( Figure 1A ) . In most of our comparative studies , we used full - length vinculin ( V FL ) , the isolated ABD V t and the following combinations of point mutants : V 1a , V 1ab , V 4 , V 1a4 , V 1b4 , V 1ab4 . We first characterized these vinculin mutants by measuring their binding to actin filaments ( F - actin ) using a cosedimentation assay . As previously reported , the autoinhibited V FL does not cosediment with F - actin ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 1B , Supplementary Figure 1A ) . Among the mutants , V 1a4 and V 1ab4 display the highest affinity for F - actin , close to that of V t , which indicates that V t is almost completely exposed in these mutants ( Figure 1B , Supplementary Figure 1B , C , D ) . In contrast V 4 and V 1b4 do not bind to F - actin ( Figure 1B , Supplementary Figure 1E , F ) . Finally , V 1a and V 1ab display low to intermediate binding levels ( Figure 1B , Supplementary Figure 1G , H ) . Altogether , these data demonstrate that the complete release of the D1 - V t contact is sufficient to partially expose the F - actin binding site of V t , whereas releasing D4 alone is not sufficient . The combined release of D4 and D1 is required to fully expose V t ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We then tested the effect of these vinculin mutants on actin nucleation by measuring the acceleration of the kinetics of pyrenyl - labeled actin assembly in low ionic strength condition , which corresponds to 25 mM KCl , while the salt concentration normally used by the vast majority of laboratories is 50 mM KCl and sometimes 100 mM KCl . Several studies have revealed regulation mechanisms and activities of FA proteins , such as vinculin , talin and VASP , by varying the ionic strength of in vitro assays ( Dedden et al . , 2019 ; Laurent et al . , 1999 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . We first confirmed that V t nucleates actin filament in a dose - dependent manner ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 1C , Supplementary Figure 2A ) . Unlike V t , most vinculin mutants 6 do not show significant actin nucleation activities ( Figure 1C , Supplementary Figure 2B - G , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Although their activities are very weak , the kinetics showed that V 1a4 and V 1ab4 are the only mutants to display a measurable activity ( inset in Figure 1C , Supplementary Figure 2F , G ) , suggesting that the release of V t from both D1 and D4 is necessary to nucleate actin , but not sufficient to fully expose this activity of V t . These two series of experiments lead to an apparent contradiction , since the release of the 2 contacts D1 - V t and D4 - V t is sufficient to expose V t and allow it to bind to F - actin ( Figure 1B ) , but not to nucleate actin filaments ( Figure 1C ) . We hypothesized that , in addition to releasing the D1 - V t and D4 - V t contacts , F - actin , which is present in cosedimentation assays but absent at the beginning of the nucleation assays , contributes to the opening of vinculin by binding to V t . To test this hypothesis , we compared the ability of vinculin mutants to cap preexisting actin filament barbed ends . The effect of vinculin mutants on barbed end capping was first assessed by measuring the inhibition of pyrenyl - labeled actin polymerization in the presence of spectrin - actin seeds ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . Although V FL , V 1a , V 1ab and V 4 display only weak activity ( Figure 1D , Supplementary Figure 3A - D ) , V 1a4 and V 1ab4 strongly inhibit the elongation of preexisting actin filament barbed ends , in agreement with our hypothesis ( Figure 1D , Supplementary Figure 3E , F , Supplementary Table 1 ) . An isolated vinculin - binding domain of talin promotes vinculin binding to F - actin but has no effect on barbed - end capping and nucleation . Before determining the activity of the talin - vinculin complex , it was necessary to determine whether and how the simple binding of talin to vinculin , independently of the activities of talin ABDs , influences the activities of vinculin described above ( Figure 1 ) . We therefore used a short domain of talin , called VBS 1 ( talin 482 - 636 ) corresponding to R1 deleted from its last helix , which exposes one VBS ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . We tested the effect of increasing concentrations of VBS 1 ( 0 - 10 µ M ) on the ability of vinculin mutants to bind to F - actin , using a cosedimentation assay ( Figure 1E ) . VBS 1 induces the binding of vinculin to F - actin with various efficiencies , depending on mutations in vinculin autoinhibitory contacts . VBS 1 induces a near two - fold increase in V FL binding to F - actin ( Figure 1E , Supplementary Figure 5A ) . The weakening of D1 - V t increases the effect of VBS 1 , which results in a three - fold increase in the binding of V 1a to F - actin ( Figure 1E , Supplementary Figure 5B ) . Finally , mutations in D4 , alone or combined with mutations in D1 , conferred to VBS 1 its highest efficiency , as shown by the 5 - 6 - fold increase in V 4 and V 1b4 binding of F - actin ( Figure 1E , Supplementary Figure 5C , D ) . Taken together , our data show that VBS 1 binding to D1 mimics mutations in D1 , explaining why the combination of VBS 1 with mutations in D4 mimics the effect of mutations in both D1 and D4 observed previously in Figure 7 1B ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . VBS 1 did not increase the nucleation activity of vinculin mutants ( Figure 1F , Supplementary Figure 6A - H , Supplementary Table 1 ) , which remains negligible compared to that of V t ( Figure 1F , Supplementary Figure 6I ) . This assay , in which F - actin is initially absent , further supports the importance of F - actin as a co - activator of vinculin . Surprisingly , increasing concentrations of VBS 1 do not change the ability of vinculin mutants to cap actin filament barbed ends in a spectrin - actin seed assay ( Figure 1G , Supplementary Figure 7A - E , Supplementary Table 1 ) . The fact that VBS 1 does not increase the ability of V 4 to inhibit barbed end elongation at the same level as V 1ab4 alone indicates that VBS 1 binding to D1 is less efficient than D1 mutations in this polymerization assay . The fact that VBS 1 activates V 4 in the cosedimentation assay described above ( Figure 1E ) , and not in a kinetic assay ( Figure 1G ) , could be due to the higher concentration of the co - activator F - actin in the cosedimentation assay . Talin with exposed VBSs promotes vinculin - dependent barbed - end capping but has no effect on nucleation . After determining the contribution of an isolated talin VBS to the activity of vinculin , we designed a series of full - length talin constructs ( T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 , T Δ 3 ) in which VBSs are exposed ( Figure 2A , Supplementary Figure 4 ) , in order to study the activity of a constitutive talin - vinculin complex harbouring the ABDs of both proteins . We first designed a construct , referred to as T Δ 1 , in which the helix 5 of the helical bundle R1 is deleted , which exposes the same VBS than that of the construct called VBS 1 used in Figure 1 . Talin T Δ 2 has been designed to expose two consecutive VBSs in R3 , thanks to the deletion of the 2 helices 10 and 13 located on both sides of the two VBSs . Talin T Δ 3 combines the mutations of T Δ 1 and T Δ 2 . We first verified the efficiency of deletions performed in T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 , T Δ 3 using a micropatterning - based binding assay adapted form our previous work ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2015 , 2014 ; Vigouroux et al . , 2020 ) . Hence , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 , T Δ 3 constructs immobilized on micropatterned surfaces recruit the head of vinculin fused to EGFP ( V h - EGFP ) more efficiently than the wild - type T FL ( Figure 2B , C ) . Because it is impossible to distinguish the relative contribution of each protein in the talin - vinculin complex to F - actin binding , we did not perform cosedimentation assays for this part of the study . We already showed that VBS 1 , which does not include the ABDs of talin , is not sufficient to promote vinculin capping activity ( Figure 1G ) . We then determined the contribution of the ABD domains of talin to the barbed - end capping activity of the talin - vinculin complex . To this aim , we combined the talin mutants with the V 1a mutant of vinculin which does not efficiently cap actin barbed ends alone ( Figure 1D ) , nor in the presence of VBS 1 ( Figure 1G ) . In the presence of a fixed concentration of V 1a , 8 addition of increasing concentrations of T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 and T Δ 3 induced a dose - dependent inhibition of barbed - end elongation in a spectrin - actin seed assay ( Figure 2D , Supplementary Figure 8B - D , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Wild - type full - length talin ( T FL ) also induced barbed - end inhibition in the presence of V 1a , but with a lower efficiency than T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 and T Δ 3 ( Figure 2D , Supplementary Figure 8A , Supplementary Table 1 ) . This effect is not due to talin constructs alone and requires the presence of V 1a since T FL , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 and T Δ 3 alone had no effect on barbed end elongation ( Figure 2D , Supplementary Figure 9A - D ) . The fact that the fully autoinhibited V FL does not combine with T FL , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 and T Δ 3 to inhibit barbed end elongation confirms that vinculin activation is required for this activity ( Supplementary Figure 10A - E ) . We then tested the ability of the talin - vinculin complex to stimulate actin assembly by combining the talin mutants with the vinculin mutant V 1ab4 . The mutant V 1ab4 appeared to be the ideal choice here because it is close to the fully open conformation ( Figure 1A ) . We hypothesized that the weak nucleation activity of V 1ab4 , ( Figure 1C , Supplementary Figure 2G ) , could be increased by talin binding to vinculin head and the activity of talin ABDs . However , kinetic assays containing V 1ab4 and T FL , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 or T Δ 3 , do not reveal a significant nucleation activity compared to the activity of V t alone , and it was not higher than that of V 1ab4 alone ( Figure 2E , Supplementary Figure 11A - D , Supplementary Table 1 ) . A talin - vinculin complex , in which all autoinhibitory contacts are released , nucleates actin filaments transiently capped at their barbed ends . The results obtained with the previous talin mutants may only partially reflect the activity of the talin - vinculin complex because talin remains autoinhibited by the F3 - R9 and F2 - R12 contacts ( Dedden et al . , 2019 ; Goult et al . , 2009 ) . We previously demonstrated that the F3 - R9 contact masks the capping activity of talin ABD1 ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that releasing these autoinhibitory contacts in talin may unravel additional activities of the talin - vinculin complex . To test this hypothesis , we designed three talin constructs , called T Δ AI , T Δ 1 Δ AI and T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure 4 ) . T Δ AI corresponds to T FL deleted from the region encompassing the auto - inhibitory ( AI ) modules R9 and R12 . T Δ 1 Δ AI combines the deletion of the AI region ( Δ AI ) and the deletion that exposes a VBS in R1 ( Δ 1 ) . T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 combines the Δ AI and Δ 1 deletions with the deletion of the second actin binding domain ( Δ ABD2 ) . In a spectrin - actin seed assay , increasing concentrations of T Δ AI and T Δ 1 Δ AI stimulated the barbed - end capping activity of V 1a but not that of V FL ( Figure 3B , Supplementary Figure 12A - E , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Altogether these experiments show that releasing the autoinhibitions of talin favors its association with vinculin to form a complex that caps actin filament barbed ends , provided that vinculin autoinhibition is 9 also weakened . The fact that T Δ 1 Δ AI is much more effective than T Δ AI for this activity further indicates that the release of the autoinhibition of talin adds to the VBS exposure in R1 to promote vinculin binding . The strong barbed - end capping activity of the complex made of T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 and V 1a , but not V FL , also indicates that talin ABD2 is not required for this activity ( Figure 3C , Supplementary Figure 13A - C , Supplementary Table 1 ) . The number and position of exposed VBSs influence the barbed end capping activity of the complex since T Δ 2 Δ AI , in which two VBSs are exposed in R3 , and T Δ 3 Δ AI , in which three VBSs are exposed in R1 and R3 , combine efficiently with V FL to cap actin filaments ( Supplementary Figure 14A - E , Supplementary Table 1 ) , in contrast with T Δ 1 Δ AI , in which only one VBS is exposed in R1 ( Figure 3B ) . We then tested the effect of complexes composed of T Δ AI , T Δ 1 Δ AI and T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 and vinculin mutants on actin nucleation . Increasing concentrations of T Δ AI and T Δ 1 Δ AI stimulated actin assembly in the presence of V 1ab4 but not in the presence of V FL ( Figure 3D , Supplementary Figure 15A - D , Supplementary Table 1 ) . As for the capping activity ( Figure 3B ) , T Δ 1 Δ AI is much more effective than T Δ AI for the nucleation activity , indicating that , in addition to the release of talin autoinhibition , VBS exposure is required for talin and vinculin to form a nucleation complex ( Figure 3D , Supplementary Figure 15C , D ) . The number and position of exposed VBSs influence this activity of the complex since a complex made of V 1ab4 and T Δ 3 Δ AI , in which three VBSs are exposed in R1 and R3 , is slightly more active than complexes made of V 1ab4 and T Δ 1 Δ AI or T Δ 2 Δ AI , in which one or two VBSs are exposed respectively ( Supplementary Figure 16A - F , Supplementary Table 1 ) . The fact that combinations of activated vinculin V 1ab4 with auto - inhibited talin ( T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 and T Δ 3 ) do not stimulate actin assembly indicates that autoinhibited ABDs in talin play a critical role in this mechanism . To determine the relative importance of the ABDs of talin and vinculin for the activity of the complex , we tested various constructs of the two proteins deleted for ABDs and we added competitors of ABDs to polymerization reactions . First , we showed that talin ABD2 is not necessary since T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 , lacking ABD2 , efficiently combines with V 1ab4 to stimulate actin assembly ( Figure 3E , Supplementary Figure 17A - C , Supplementary Table 1 ) . We also compared the ability of talin constructs containing VBSs and either ABD1 or ABD3 to stimulate actin assembly in the presence of V 1ab4 . We found that ABD1 and ABD3 can combine with vinculin to stimulate actin polymerization , suggesting redundancy between ABD1 and ABD3 ( Supplementary Figure 18A ) . Interestingly , the addition of the isolated R9 domain of talin to a polymerization reaction containing T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 and V 1ab4 reduces the stimulation of actin assembly ( Supplementary Figure 18B ) . This result confirms that ABD1 , which is masked by R9 in inactive talin ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 ) , is involved in this activity . Finally , combinations of various activated talin constructs with vinculin head ( V h ) , which lacks its ABD V t , failed to block the 10 elongation of actin filament barbed ends or stimulate actin assembly , indicating a critical role of V t in all activities of the talin - vinculin complex ( Supplementary Figure 19A - B ) . Altogether our observations indicate that ABD1 and ABD3 domains of talin , as well as the V t domain of vinculin , are involved in the activities of the complex . To confirm the mechanism by which the talin - vinculin complex regulates actin assembly , we observed in TIRF microscopy the actin filaments produced by the complex made of V 1ab4 and T Δ 1 Δ AI or T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 described above . Representative images and quantifications showed that the T Δ 1 Δ AI - V 1ab4 complex induces the formation of a higher number of actin filaments than T Δ 1 Δ AI alone or V 1ab4 alone ( Figure 4A , C , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . We found the same result for T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 - V 1ab4 complex ( Figure 4B , D , Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Interestingly , the analysis of actin filament elongation showed that they undergo frequent pauses reflecting barbed end capping events ( Figure 4E , F ) . The exponential fit of the distribution of the pause duration gave an estimated dissociation rate constant of 0 . 006 s - 1 ( t 1 / 2 = 110 s ) for T Δ 1 Δ AI - V 1ab4 and 0 . 009 s - 1 ( t 1 / 2 = 75 s ) for T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 - V 1ab4 ( Figure 4G ) . Finally , we followed fluorescent molecules of vinculin , talin and actin in real time during the nucleation and capping of individual actin filaments . We first immobilized pre - formed complexes of T Δ 1 Δ AI - Alexa594 and V 1ab4 - Alexa647 at low concentration on a glass surface passivated with PLL - PEG and added actin - Alexa488 under conditions that allowed nucleation and capping . This experimental setup allowed us to capture sequences of events in which spots , containing both talin and vinculin , associate with actin and release a growing actin filament ( Figure 5A , Supplementary Movie 3 ) . In this experiment , as in FAs that form in cells , talin , and under certain conditions vinculin , are dimers that assemble with high stoichiometry . The observed spots therefore contain several molecules of T Δ 1 Δ AI and V 1ab4 that assemble via the exposed VBS of T Δ 1 Δ AI but also via other VBSs with lower affinity as indicated by the activity of the T Δ AI - V 1ab4 experiments ( Figure 3D ) . The stationary fiduciary marks along actin filaments indicate that the talin - vinculin complex remains associated with the pointed end while the barbed end is free to grow on the other side ( black arrow head , Figure 5A ) . Interestingly , nucleation events are often characterized by the existence of a delay between actin recruitment by a talin - vinculin complex and the elongation of a filament ( Figure 5B , Supplementary Movie 4 ) . In this series of experiments , pre - existing filaments are also captured and capped at their barbed end ( Figure 5C , Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Barbed - end capping is transient as many of the capped filaments are eventually left free to elongate after a delay ( Figure 5D , Supplementary Movie 6 ) . These activities lead to a distribution of talin - vinculin complexes at the pointed end of the filaments , following their nucleation , at the barbed end of the filaments , following their capping , or on the side of the filaments ( Figure 5E ) . Quantification of the delay between actin recruitment and elongation allows to determine a rate ( 0 . 0047 s - 1 , t 1 / 2 = 147 s , Figure 5E ) , that is close to the 11 dissociation rate of the barbed ends from the talin - vinculin complex observed previously ( Figure 4G ) , suggesting that the talin - vinculin complex nucleates filaments initially capped at their barbed end . Altogether , our direct observations reveal a mechanism in which talin and vinculin , in their active conformations , form a complex that nucleates actin filaments transiently capped at their barbed ends before being released and free to elongate ( Figure 6 ) . The talin - vinculin complex may also follow part of this mechanism to cap pre - existing filaments ( Figure 6 ) . Discussion The assembly of the talin - vinculin complex is a key step in the reinforcement of cell - matrix adhesions subjected to a mechanical stimulus such as the force generated by the actomyosin stress fibers . This complex strengthens the link with the tensile actomyosin cytoskeleton to resist the force it applies . However , the mechanisms by which the force - dependent complex acts on actin filaments was poorly understood . The mechanistic study of the talin - vinculin complex has long been limited by the fact that the assembly of the complex depends on the release of multiple autoinhibitory interactions both in talin and in vinculin . Although it is established that force exposes cryptic vinculin binding sites in talin by stretching helical bundles , the mechanisms allowing the release of the additional autoinhibitory interactions between distant domains in talin are not fully understood . The structure of full - length talin in its autoinhibited form has been reported recently and revealed that , in addition to the known interaction between F3 and R9 , the F2 domain interacts with the R12 domain ( Dedden et al . , 2019 ; Goult et al . , 2009 ) . These autoinhibitory contacts mask the binding interface of ABD1 , corresponding to F2 and F3 , with F - actin , while ABD2 , composed of R4 and R8 , is masked by an interaction with R3 ( Atherton et al . , 2020 ; Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 ; Dedden et al . , 2019 ) ( Figure 6 ) . The mechanism by which these contacts are disrupted is unclear . The binding of RIAM and PIP2 to talin F3 is known to disrupt the F3 - R9 autoinhibition ( Yang et al . , 2014 ) . Once these two interdomain interactions are disrupted , talin can be pulled by actomyosin force , which stretches helical bundles to expose cryptic VBSs ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ; Yao et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 6 ) . Force application to the ABD3 / R13 domain of talin could also contribute to disrupting its auto - inhibitions , but no experimental evidence of such a mechanism has been reported to date . This mechanism is possible because the ABD3 domain is exposed , at least partially , in the inactive talin , as suggested by the flexibility of the neighboring domains ( Dedden et al . , 2019 ) . In this study , we show that combining various deletions , including the part of talin that contains the R9 and R12 autoinhibitory domains , with the deletion of individual helices , which exposes VBSs , mimics the open and mechanically stretched conformation of talin ( Figure 6 ) . 12 Our results show that the release of talin autoinhibition is sufficient to allow the binding of vinculin and form a complex that caps and nucleates actin , which explains the observation made by others that a mutation in talin that disrupts the F3 - R9 interaction is sufficient to recruit vinculin in cells ( Atherton et al . , 2020 ) . Our data also support the findings that the association of talin and vinculin without tension is required for efficient nascent adhesion maturation ( Han et al . , 2021 ) . This interaction likely corresponds to a low degree of saturation of the partially exposed VBSs in this open talin structure that has become very flexible . Indeed , exposure of a single VBS motif in R1 significantly increases vinculin binding as evidenced by the enhanced activity of the talin - vinculin complex . Vinculin is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the head ( V h ) and the tail ( V t ) domains . Talin binding to the D1 subdomain of V h is controlled by the D1 - V t interaction ( Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) , whereas F - actin binding to V t is controlled by a more complex mechanism involving interactions of D1 and D4 with both sides of V t ( Cohen et al . , 2005 ; Johnson and Craig , 1995 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . The identification of several intermediate open conformations of vinculin suggests that the level of activation of vinculin is controlled by the number of auto - inhibitory contacts removed ( Chorev et al . , 2018 ) . Our vinculin mutagenesis strategy confirmed that V t activities are controlled by different combinations of V h - V t autoinhibitory contacts . The disruption of D1 - V t is sufficient to induce F - actin binding to V t , but the combination of D1 and D4 mutations provides a higher affinity for F - actin . In the present study we show that the disruption of D1 - V t is not sufficient to expose the capping activity of V t , which requires the combined disruption of D1 and D4 contacts with V t , as previously suggested ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . Early studies showed that the coincidental binding of talin and F - actin to D1 and V t respectively keep vinculin in its open conformation ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . In agreement with this model , full - length vinculin dissociates rapidly from FAs after actomyosin inhibition , whereas V h remains stably associated , demonstrating that tensile actomyosin stress fibers bound to V t maintain the open conformation of talin - bound vinculin ( Carisey et al . , 2013 ; Humphries et al . , 2007 ) . This observation is further explained by the discovery that V t forms a catch bond with F - actin in response to force ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) . It is therefore not surprising that the release of D1 and D4 from V t in our experiments releases the capping activity of vinculin that occurs in the presence of actin filaments , but results in very little actin nucleation initiated without actin filaments . Solving the problem of releasing the auto - inhibitory contacts of talin and vinculin was a prerequisite for determining the activity that results from the combination of their ABDs . It is interesting to remember that the combination of actin - binding proteins within transient complexes is often found in important signal - responsive mechanisms for regulating actin dynamics . However , the results of such combinations cannot be predicted from the activities of the isolated proteins , as exemplified by the formation 13 of branched actin filaments resulting from the combination of WASP and Arp2 / 3 ( Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ) . Here , we show that the combination of talin ABDs with vinculin V t in a complex creates a machinery that nucleates actin filaments transiently capped at their barbed end ( Figure 6 ) . In this mechanism , talin and vinculin cooperate to form a new filament through a mechanism that is not yet understood but which probably involves the stabilization of actin nuclei that form spontaneously in solution by the ABDs of talin and vinculin . This mechanism leads to the transient barbed - end capping of the newly formed actin filaments . After being released from capping , the actin filament elongates by its free barbed end , while the complex remains attached to the side of the filament , near the pointed end ( Figure 6 ) . It would be tempting to attribute to vinculin alone the nucleation and capping activities of the talin - vinculin complex , since V t has these activities ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ; Wen et al . , 2009 ) . However , our previous report indicates that the capping activity of the complex involves the ABD1 of talin ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 ) . The fact that a complex , composed of active vinculin and talin with exposed VBSs but masked ABD1 , does not nucleate , shows unambiguously the importance of ABD1 for nucleation . Although the function of the ABD1 domain of talin is generally restricted to integrin activation in a membrane - bound conformation that does not allow its binding to actin , it is important to recall here that talin is in equilibrium between actin and the plasma membrane as evidenced by its retrograde movement in FAs ( Hu et al . , 2007 ) . ABD2 is not involved in capping or nucleation mechanisms as demonstrated by the strong activities of a mutant that does not contain this domain . However , ABD3 can also combine with V t to nucleate , suggesting a possible redundancy of ABD1 and ABD3 in this mechanism . It is interesting to see that the three domains of talin are redundant for the bundling of actin filaments ( Kelley et al . , 2020 ) , but are involved more selectively in the actin polymerization activities of talin in combination with vinculin . It is very likely that actin filaments nucleated by talin and vinculin will end up forming large bundles , but our microscopy experiments , where the filaments are short and spaced out , disadvantages this activity and we have not explored this direction already widely documented by recent studies ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 2020 ; Kelley et al . , 2020 ) . In the context of a stress fiber anchored to a focal adhesion , where this talin - vinculin complex resides , it is unlikely that this release of actin filaments , occurring with a half - time of 75 s to 110 s , allows the fast processive elongation of a stress fiber . However , this release is fast enough to feed stress fibers with new actin filaments and reinforce stress fibers . It would be interesting to determine how the talin - vinculin complex cooperates with other ABPs in FAs , such as VASP , parvin or tensin , to regulate actin assembly . 14 Material and methods Recombinant cDNA Constructs cDNAs encoding for vinculin 1 - 1066 ( V FL ) , vinculin E28K / D33H ( V 1a ) , vinculin E28K / D33H / D110H / R113E ( V 1ab ) , vinculin N773I / E775K ( V 4 ) , vinculin E28K / D33H / N773I / E775K ( V 1a4 ) , vinculin D110H / R113E / N773I / E775K ( V 1b4 ) , vinculin E28K / D33H / D110H / R113E / N773I / E775K ( V 1ab4 ) were synthezied and subcloned in the NcoI site of pET - 3d by Genscript . cDNAs encoding for vinculin 879 - 1066 ( V t ) , talin - 1 482 – 636 ( VBS 1 ) , talin - 1 1655 – 1822 ( R9 ) , full - length talin - 1 ( T FL ) , full - length vinculin ( V FL ) were described previously ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 , 2015 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . cDNAs encoding for T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 , T F2F3R1R2R3 , T R2R3ABD3 were constructed by different PCR amplifications of the full length talin cDNA and subcloning in a pETM plasmid . N - terminal Strep - tag II , PreScission site and C - terminal His 6 tag were introduced by PCR . cDNAs of T Δ AI , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 , T Δ 3 , T Δ 1 Δ AI , T Δ 2 Δ AI , T Δ 3 Δ AI were constructed and subcloned into pET - 29a + by Genscript . The constructs were verified by sequencing . See Supplementary Figure 4 for the detail of the talin constructs . Protein Purification V FL , V t , V 1a , V 1ab , V 4 , V 1a4 , V 1b4 , V 1ab4 , T FL , T Δ AI , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 , T Δ 3 , T Δ 1 Δ AI , T Δ 2 Δ AI , T Δ 3 Δ AI , T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 , T F2F3R1R2R3 , T R2R3ABD3 and VBS 1 were expressed in E . Coli BL21 as previously described ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , 1mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was used for induction . Bacterial pellets of V FL , V t , V 1a , V 1ab , V 4 , V 1a4 , V 1b4 , V 1ab4 were lysed by sonication in 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 M NaCl , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 10 µg / ml benzamidine and 1 mM PMSF . Lysates of His - tagged vinculin constructs were purified by Ni - NTA - sepharose affinity chromatography ( Ni 2 + - nitrilotriacetic acid , Qiagen ) , followed by a Q - Sepharose ion exchange column . V t was purified as previously described ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . Vinculin proteins were finally dialyzed in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 1mM DTT . Bacterial pellets of T FL , T Δ AI , T Δ 1 , T Δ 2 , T Δ 3 , T Δ 1 Δ AI , T Δ 2 Δ AI , T Δ 3 Δ AI , T Δ 1 Δ AI Δ ABD2 , T F2F3R1R2R3 , T R2R3ABD3 were lysed by sonication in 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 10 µg / ml benzamidine and 1 mM PMSF . Lysates of His - tagged talin constructs were purified by Ni - NTA - sepharose affinity chromatography ( Ni 2 + - nitrilotriacetic acid , Qiagen ) , followed by a gel filtration column ( Superdex 200 , 16 / 600 , GE Healthcare ) . VBS 1 was purified as previously described ( Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . Talin constructs were finally dialyzed in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT . F - actin co - sedimentation assay F - actin co - sedimentation assays were performed to determine the affinity of vinculin constructs for F - actin in the absence and presence of talin VBS 1 . In F - actin co - 15 sedimentation assay with vinculin alone , 2 µM of vinculin ( V FL , V t , V 1a , V 1ab , V 4 , V 1a4 , V 1b4 , V 1ab4 ) was incubated with 0 , 1 . 5 , 3 , 4 . 5 , 6 , 10 , 20 µM F - actin in 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 200 µM ATP , 1 mM DTT during 15 min at room temperature . To test the effect of VBS 1 , F - actin co - sedimentation assays were also performed in the presence of 2 µM of vinculin ( V FL , V 1a , V 4 , V 1b4 ) , 10 µM F - actin , with or without 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 µM VBS 1 in 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 200 µM ATP , 1 mM DTT during 15 min at room temperature . After centrifugation at 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA - 120 . 1 rotor ( Beckman ) during 30 min , the pellets and supernatants were separated and loaded on SDS - PAGE . Gels were scanned and analyzed with the ImageJ software . Polymerization assay Actin polymerization was measured by the increase in fluorescence of 10 % pyrenyl - labeled actin in a SAFAS Xenius spectrofluorimeter ( Safas , Monaco ) . To measure the elongation of actin filament barbed ends , actin polymerization was induced by 100 pM spectrin - actin seeds in 10 % pyrenyl - labeled CaATP - G - actin , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 2 mM EGTA in presence of indicated proteins . The fraction of barbed end elongation was calculated as the ratio between the elongation rates in the presence and absence of proteins of interest . To test the ability of proteins to nucleate actin filaments , spontaneous polymerization was induced by adding 25 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 2 mM EGTA to 10 % pyrenyl - labeled CaATP - G - actin solution in presence of the proteins of interest . Observation of talin , vinculin and single actin filaments in TIRF microscopy Our protocol is a modification of protocols used to study talin and vinculin activities ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2018 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2010 ) . To prevent the nonspecific binding of actin filaments to the surface of the coverslip , we first irradiated coverslips with deep UVs for 3 min and incubated them with 0 . 1 mg / mL PLL - PEG for 1 h at room temperature . The coverslip was then washed extensively with water and dried . Flow cells containing 40 - 60 µl of liquid were prepared by sticking the PLL - PEG - coated coverslip to a slide with double - sided adhesive spacers . In experiments to observe and count single filament number , the chamber was first incubated with washing buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 200 µM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 25 mM KCl ) for 1 min . The chamber was then saturated with 10 % BSA for 5 min and washed with washing buffer . The final reaction was then injected into the chamber . A typical reaction was composed of 1 µM actin ( 5 % Alexa488 - labeleld ) in 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , 200 µM ATP , 1 % methylcellulose , 5 mM 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo ( 2 , 2 , 2 ) - octane , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 200 µM EGTA , 40 mM DTT supplemented with various talin and vinculin mutants . To observe talin , vinculin and actin simultaneously , 0 . 2 µ M T Δ 1 Δ AI ( 78 % Alexa594 - labelled ) and 1 µ M V 1ab4 ( 18 % Alexa647 - labelled ) were first 16 mixed , diluted 20 times to reach final concentrations of 10 nM T Δ 1 Δ AI and 50 nM V 1ab4 , injected on a flow chamber to immobilize T Δ 1 Δ AI - V 1ab4 complexes non - specifically on the surface passivated with PLL - PEG , and finally supplemented with 0 . 8 µ M actin ( 5 % Alexa488 - labelled ) . Finally , we sealed the flow chamber with VALAP ( a mixture of Vaseline , lanolin , and paraffin ) and observed the reaction on an Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope equipped with 60X / 1 . 49NA objective ( Nikon ) . The time - lapse videos were acquired by Metamorph and subsequently analyzed by the ImageJ software . Protein labeling For 3 - color imaging , actin is labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid , succinimidyl ester , which reacts with the NH 2 groups of basic amino acids ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2015 ) . T Δ 1 Δ AI and V 1ab4 are labeled on free cysteines with Alexa Fluor 594 maleimide and Alexa Fluor 647 maleimide respectively . Quantification and statistical analysis All experiments presented in this manuscript were repeated independently two to four times . Where appropriate , data points from two independent experiments are overlaid to demonstrate reproducibility . For unambiguous negative results , a single data set is presented . 17 References Atherton P , Lausecker F , Carisey A , Gilmore A , Critchley D , Barsukov I , Ballestrem C . 2020 .
