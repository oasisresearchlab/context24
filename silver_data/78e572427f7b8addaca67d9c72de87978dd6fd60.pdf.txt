( a ) Immunohistochemical detection of Pinkbar protein ( red ) in human colon . Endogenous Pinkbar protein is strongly expressed in fully polarized intestinal epithelial cells and in newly forming enterocytes . Pinkbar displays punctuate localization close to cell - cell junctions stained with E - cadherin ( upper row ) . Occasionally , Pinkbar also co - localizes with the tight junction protein ZO - 1 ( bottom row ) . Bars : 10 (cid:80) m ( top row ) and 20 (cid:80) m ( bottom row ) . ( b ) In differentiated Caco - 2 cells ( Day 16 ) , Pinkbar protein ( red in merge images ) displays punctuate localization near intercellular junctions ( white arrowheads in upper row ) .

( c ) One day old Caco - 2 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing mCherry - Pinkbar and eGFP - Rab13 . Co - localization in tubular structures was typically observed in cells prior to the formation of cell - cell contacts ( top row ) .

( a ) Binding of the BAR domain of Pinkbar to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich vesicles was examined by its ability to cluster PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the membrane . The BAR domain of Pinkbar quenches the fluorescence of bodipy - PIP 2 , suggesting that this domain binds and clusters PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the membrane , similarly to the I - BAR domains of MIM and IRSp53 . The composition of liposomes used in the assay was POPC : POPE : POPS : PIP 2 : bodipy - PIP 2 ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 9 . 5 : 0 . 5 ) . Error bars indicate s . d . values from three independent experiments . ( b ) The BAR domain of Pinkbar ( 1 - 239 ) induces an increase in steady state DPH anisotropy , further demonstrating that it binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich vesicles and indicating that it inserts into the membrane bilayer . The other domains of Pinkbar did not have detectable effects on DPH anisotropy , suggesting that they are not involved in membrane insertion . The composition of the liposomes used in the assay was POPC : POPE : POPS : PIP 2 ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 ) . Error bars indicate s . d . values from three independent experiments . ( c ) When expressed in U2OS cells , a GFP - fusion of the BAR domain of Pinkbar localizes to cell - cell contacts and to dot - like structures ( white arrowheads in the 1st row ) and to cytoplasmic tubular / sheet - like structures ( white arrowheads in the 2nd row ) . However , this BAR domain does not localize to or induce the formation of filopodia - like plasma membrane protrusions like that of MIM ( white arrowheads in the 3rd row ) . Bottom row displays a eGFP - control . F - actin is visualized with Alexa647 - conjugated phalloidin . Bar : 10 (cid:1167) (cid:80) M .

( a ) The BAR domain of Pinkbar induces an increase in steady state DPH anisotropy , indicating that it inserts into the membrane bilayer . The interaction is enhanced by phosphoinositides , however there is no clear preference for a specific phosphoinositide . The composition of the liposomes used in the assay was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 ) . ( b ) A mutant BAR domain lacking nine N - terminal residues displayed a significantly lower increase in steady state DPH anisotropy compared to the wild - type domain , suggesting defects in the insertion into the membrane bilayer . The composition of the liposomes used in the assay was POPC : POPE : POPS : PIP 2 ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 ) . ( c ) The membrane insertion depth of a tryptophan residue introduced into the N - terminal helix of the BAR domain of Pinkbar at position 9 ( Y9W ) was determined by the quenching of tryptophan fluoresence by phosphatidylcholines brominated along the acyl chains at positions ( 6 , 7 ) , ( 9 , 10 ) , and ( 11 , 12 ) . The results revealed that Trp9 is in proximity with 11 , 12 - bromides , which are at a distance of 6 . 3 Å from the center of the bilayer . The final concentrations of the protein and lipid were 0 . 3 µM and 150 µM , respectively .

( a ) Transmission electron microscopy analysis of small unilamellar vesicles containing 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 incubated with the BAR domains of MIM ( left ) or Pinkbar ( middle ) . Control vesicles in the absence of protein are shown on the right . The vesicles were visualized by negative staining . ( b ) Transmission electron microscopy analysis of thin sections ( 120 nm ) from epon embedded samples of small unilamellar vesicles . The I - BAR domain of MIM ( left ) induced membrane tubulation . In contrast , the BAR domain of Pinkbar promoted the formation of planar membrane surfaces and vesicle aggregation or fusion ( magnification : 18 , 500 ; scale bars : 0 . 2 (cid:541) m ) . ( c ) An overview of GUVs ( giant unilamellar vesicles ) without ( left panel ) and with mCherry - labeled BAR domain of Pinkbar ( right panel ) . Bar : 30 mm . Nature Structural & Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2079 Supplementary Figure 6 Crystallization of the BAR domain of Pinkbar and the origins of helix bending and BAR domain curvature . ( a ) The E . coli expressed BAR domain , dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 250 mM NaCl , seemed to precipitate during protein concentration . However , the precipitate had a sparkly appearance , and when checked under the microscope it was found to consist of a microcrystalline aggregate . This observation immediately suggested that the BAR domain had a tendency to self - associate in an organized fashion . We , therefore , pursued crystallization at low protein concentration ( ~ 1 . 5 mg / ml ) , by limiting crystal nucleation with the addition of glycerol . Two crystal forms were obtained with addition of 5 % ( left ) and 10 % ( right ) glycerol to the dialysis buffer . The crystals obtained with 5 % glycerol diffracted the X - rays significantly better , and were used to determine the structure of the BAR domain of Pinkbar to 2 . 25 Å resolution . ( b ) The three long helices of the BAR domains of Pinkbar , IRSp53 and MIM present a kink in the middle ( contoured black ) . For clarity , we show the two chains of the BAR domain dimer of Pinkbar ( blue and cyan ) , but only one of the chains of the I - BAR domains of IRSp53 ( gold ) and MIM ( magenta ) . Note that the bending is equally pronounced in the two perpendicular orientations shown in the figure . The kink occurs near the edge of the central ‘core’ region , i . e . the region where the antiparallel subunits of the dimer overlap . The helices of the three proteins are kinked to different extents at this point , which in turn determines the overall curvature of their respective BAR domains . As it can be appreciated , the three domains superimpose relatively well within the core region , but substantial differences occur toward the distal ends of the dimers . ( c ) Structure - based sequence alignment illustrating the location of the helical kinks ( K1 - 3 ) and how these kinks effectively split the three helices of each monomer into core ( (cid:68) 1b , (cid:68) 2a , (cid:68) 3b ) and distal ( (cid:68) 1a , (cid:68) 2b , (cid:68) 3a ) regions . The cluster of positively charged amino acids that forms the membrane - binding interface of the I - BAR domain is mainly located within helices (cid:68) 2b ( (cid:68) 2b’ ) , kinks K2 ( K2’ ) and loops L2 ( L2’ ) .

( a and b ) The structure of the BAR domain of Pinkbar suggested that the conspicuously exposed residue Trp141 is involved in the stabilization of the lateral oligomer ( see Fig . 3d in main text ) . Consistent with this prediction , the BAR domain of Pinkbar is in equilibrium between dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers in solution as determined by Multi - Angle Light Scattering . Replacing Trp141 by Ser results in a more soluble protein , which forms only dimers in solution . ( c ) NBD - PC - labeled fluorescent GUVs were mixed with 100 nM mCherry - tagged wild - type BAR domain or W141S mutant BAR domain . After addition of both BAR domain constructs , 10 - 17 % of GUVs remained green and round , suggesting that the BAR domain binds cooperatively to GUVs . Importantly , W141S mutant was significantly less efficient in deforming GUVs compared to wild - type BAR domain of Pinkbar . The fractions of deformed vesicles were counted from three independent experiments in which a total of > 1200 vesicles were counted . Error bars indicate s . d . ( d ) The BAR domain of Pinkbar induces vesicle aggregation as detected by light scattering . Compared to the wild - type protein , the mutant R145A / K146A / R147A defective in PIP 2 - binding induces weaker vesicle aggregation . In contrast , the oligomerization - deficient mutant W141S induces slightly stronger vesicle aggregation than the wild - type domain . The lipid and protein concentrations were 10 µM and 0 . 5 µM , respectively . The composition of large unilamellar vesicles was POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 ) . Nature Structural & Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2079 Supplementary Figure 8 Mutagenesis of the BAR domain of Pinkbar . ( a ) Pinkbar binds phosphoinositide - rich membranes mainly through electrostatic interactions . Quenching of bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 demonstrates that the BAR domain of Pinkbar sequesters PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the membrane , and this activity is salt concentration - dependent . The lipid composition in this assay was POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 / bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 9 . 5 : 0 . 5 ) and the total lipid concentration was 40 (cid:541) M . ( b ) Alignment of Pinkbar sequences from different sources , where the amino acids mutated in this study are numbered and highlighted by a red contour . The background color for amino acids is according to conservation ( dark blue – strictly conserved , light blue – partially conserved , white – non conserved ) . GenBank accession codes are as in Supplementary Figure 1 .

( a ) Co - flotation of wild - type BAR domain , ( b ) R145A / K146A / R147A mutant , and ( c ) purified GFP ( negative control ) with liposomes composed of POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 / rhodamine - PE ( 50 : 15 : 20 : 10 : 5 ) . Sucrose density gradient fractions ( d ) were examined by SDS - PAGE . Liposomes were mostly present in fraction 2 , as detected by fluorescence of rhodamine - PE . The wild - type BAR domain co - floated with liposomes , whereas the R145A / K146A / R147A mutant bound liposomes less efficiently in this assay . Nature Structural & Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2079 SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS Multi - Angle Light Scattering . The oligomerization state of the BAR domain of Pinkbar was analyzed using Multi - Angle Light Scattering ( MALS ) . The molecular species were first separated on a G3000SWXL Size Exclusion Column ( Tosoh Bioscience , Japan ) and their masses were measured using a Dawn Heleos MALS detector and an Optilab rEX refractometer ( Wyatt Technology Corparation , Santa Barbara , CA ) . The column was equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl and a sample volume of 100 (cid:541) l ( at 1 mg / ml ) was injected using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA ) . Before injection , each sample was filtered through a 0 . 45 µm filter . The molecular species separated by SEC chromatography were detected by the refractometer and the 18 - angle MALS detector , equipped with a 50 mV solid - state laser operating at 658 nm . Baseline scattering , peak boundaries and molecular masses were all determined with the Astra software ( Wyatt Technology Corp . , Santa Barbara , CA ) . In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry . Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti - Pinkbar ( 1 : 2000 ; Atlas Antibodies ) , anti - ZO1 ( 1 : 500 ; LifeSpan BioSciences ) or anti - E - cadherin ( 1 : 500 ; BD Transduction Laboratories ) . Human colon tissue sections ( Zyagen Laboratories ) were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C . Goat - anti - mouse IgM Alexa Fluor 488 or goat - anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 ( Molecular Probes ) were used as secondary antibodies . The sections were mounted with Vectashield ( Vector ) and imaged on a confocal microscope ( TCS SP5 ; Leica ) equipped with Leica Application Suite ( LAS AF 2 . 2 . 0 ) at room temperature . The objective used was a HCX APO 63x / 1 , 30 Corr . ( glycerol ) CS 21 . Confocal imaging was performed as previously described 1 . Cell culture , immunofluorescence and Western blotting . For localization studies , full - length wild - type and W141S mutant Pinkbar were cloned into pGFP - N1 and pmCherry - N1 vectors . The open reading frames of human Rab13 , Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab8 , Rab11 , Rab23 , Rab25 , Rab35 were cloned into pEGFP - C1 or pmCherry - N1 vectors . Human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells ( Caco - 2 ) were purchased from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . Caco - 2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium , low glucose , supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone ) , Nature Structural & Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2079 2 mM penicillin , streptomycin and L - glutamine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The cells were polarized on 0 . 4 (cid:80) m polycarbonate membrane filter plates ( Costar Transwell Permeable Support ) until day 16 . Non - polarized Caco - 2 cells were transfected with FuGene HD according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Roche ) . U2OS cell transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . Depending on the application , cells were directly imaged or fixed with 4 % PFA 20 – 30 hrs after transfection . Immunofluorescence was performed as described 1 with the following reagent dilutions : Alexa Fluor 568 and 647 phalloidin ( 1 : 300 ) , anti - Pinkbar ( 1 : 100 / 200 ) , anti - E - cadherin ( 1 : 300 ) , and anti - ZO - 1 , ( 1 : 300 ; BD Transduction Laboratories ) . Microscopy image acquisition and processing were performed as described 2 . Filters were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Invitrogen ) and imaged on a confocal microscope ( TCS SP5 ; Leica ) equipped with Leica Application Suite ( LAS AF 2 . 2 . 0 ) at room temperature . The objective used was a HCX APO 63x / 1 , 30 Corr . ( glycerol ) CS 21 . Confocal imaging and Western blotting with anti - Pinkbar antibody ( 1 : 2000 dilution ) were performed as described 1 , 2 Light Scattering Assay . The intensity of light scattering at 90° from liposomes was monitored at 300 nm using a Perkin - Elmer LS 55 spectrofluorometer with both excitation and emission bandwidths set at 2 . 5 nm . The scattering intensity was measured continuously after the addition of 0 . 5 µM protein samples . The lipid concentration was 10 (cid:541) M . Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by brominated phosphatidylcholines . For this assay a mutant where Trp141 and Trp216 were replaced by Leu and Tyr9 was replaced by Trp was prepared as described above . The sole tryptophan residue was excited at 280 nm , and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm ( averaging three scans ) . Spectra were corrected for the contribution of light scattering in the presence of vesicles . The indicated liposomes with a final concentration of 150 µM were added to 0 . 3 µM protein solution in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 . The differences in the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by ( 6 , 7 ) - , ( 9 , 10 ) - , and ( 11 , 12 ) - Br 2 - PC were used to assess the position of Trp9 in the bilayer . The average Nature Structural & Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2079 bromine distances from the bilayer center are 10 . 8 , 8 . 3 , and 6 . 3 Å for ( 6 , 7 ) - , ( 9 , 10 ) - , and ( 11 , 12 ) - Br 2 - PC , respectively 3 . Co - flotation assays . In vitro co - flotation assays with PIP 2 - containing liposomes were conducted according to 4 with slight modifications . Liposomes were prepared as described 5 . Lipid films were rehydrated in 20 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 3 M sucrose with occasional gentle vortexing . For visualization , liposomes were labeled with 5 % Rhodamine B - conjugated PE ( Avanti polar lipids , Sigma ) . Protein ( 800 nM ) was mixed with 230 (cid:80) M liposomes and incubated at RT for 15 min . Samples were then brought to 30 % sucrose concentration by gentle mixing ( final volume 250 µl ) and overlaid with 200 µl of 25 % sucrose and 0 % sucrose solution each in HEPES buffer . The samples were centrifuged at + 4 °C at 54 000 rpm with Beckman Optima Max using TLS55 rotor for 30 min at 4°C . Fractions of 100 µl were collected from top to bottom and 20 (cid:80) l samples were run on SDS - PAGE . The fluorescence intensity from the same fractions was monitored at 590 nm using a Perkin - Elmer LS 55 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission bandwidths set at 10 nm and 6 nm , respectively . To analyze association of Pinkbar with membranes in cells , Caco - 2 cells were grown until day 4 , harvested , and lysed in a glass douncer in ice - cold 10 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , with 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , and 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 . The lysate ( 525 µl ) was supplemented with 175 µl of 1 M sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at 1000 x g ( 3 min at 4°C ) . The resulting nuclei - free supernatant was subjected to flotation assays according to 4 . Two hundred microliters of the supernatant were diluted to 1 ml with sucrose to a final concentration of 70 % , placed under two cushions of 65 % ( 7 ml ) , 10 % sucrose ( 3 . 5 ml ) , and 0 % sucrose ( 1 ml ) and centrifuged overnight ( 18 hours ) at 4°C at 29 000 rpm with Sorvall Discovery 90SE using AH - 629 rotor and Beckman Polyallomere Centrifugation tubes ( 331372 ) . Fractions ( 1 ml ) were collected from top to bottom : 1 ( 0 % ) , 2 - 4 ( 10 % ) , 5 - 8 ( 65 % ) , and 9 ( 70 % ) Proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) , solubilized in SDS - PAGE sample buffer , pH neutralized with addition of few micro liters of NaOH and analyzed by immunoblotting 2 . Primary antibodies were used with the following dilutions : anti - Pinkbar antibody ( Atlas Antibodies ) at 1 : 1000 , anti - E - cadherin antibody ( BD Transduction Nature Structural & Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2079 Laboratories ) at 1 : 4000 , and secondary antibodies as follows , anti - rabbit IgG - HRP at 1 : 4000 and anti - mouse IgG - HRP at 1 : 5000 , respectively .
