DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE AN ECONOMIC PAYOFF ? A CROSS - COUNTRY INVESTIGATION * S TEPHEN K NACK AND P HILIP K EEFER This paper presents evidence that “social capital” matters for measurable eco - nomic performance , using indicators of trust and civic norms from the World Val - ues Surveys for a sample of 29 market economies . Memberships in formal groups—Putnam’s measure of social capital—is not associated with trust or with improved economic performance . We ﬁnd trust and civic norms are stronger in nations with higher and more equal incomes , with institutions that restrain predatory actions of chief executives , and with better - educated and ethnically ho - mogeneous populations . I . I NTRODUCTION The notion of social capital has attracted great academic and journalistic attention , particularly with the publication of Put - nam’s Making Democracy Work [ 1993 ] , in which the concept is used to explain differences in the economic and government per - formance of northern and southern Italy . We explore in this paper the following issues related to social capital and economic performance : i ) the relationship between interpersonal trust , norms of civic cooperation , and economic performance , and some of the policy and other links through which these dimen - sions of social capital may have economic effects ; ii ) the conﬂicting hypotheses of Putnam [ 1993 ] and Olson [ 1982 ] , on the relationship between associational activity and growth ; and iii ) the determinants of trust and norms of civic cooperation , including levels of associational activity and formal institutions . Trust , cooperative norms , and associations within groups each fall within the elastic deﬁnitions that most scholars have q 1997 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

Coleman [ 1990 , pp . 300 – 301 ] writes that “authority relations , relations of trust , and consen - sual allocations of rights which establish norms” can be viewed as resources for individuals , noting that Loury [ 1977 ] introduced the term “social capital” to describe these resources . Following Granovetter [ 1973 ] , Putnam points to the potential importance of weak ties across kinship groups . Both Coleman and Putnam refer to trust and norms of civic - minded behavior as other manifesta - tions of social capital . Our analysis arrives at three major conclusions . First , trust and civic cooperation are associated with stronger economic per - formance . Second , associational activity is not correlated with economic performance—contrary to Putnam’s [ 1993 ] ﬁndings across Italian regions . Third , we ﬁnd that trust and norms of civic cooperation are stronger in countries with formal institutions that effectively protect property and contract rights , and in coun - tries that are less polarized along lines of class or ethnicity . II . H OW C AN T RUST A FFECT E CONOMIC P ERFORMANCE ? Economic activities that require some agents to rely on the future actions of others are accomplished at lower cost in higher - trust environments . According to Arrow [ 1972 , p . 357 ] , “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust , certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time . It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backward - ness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual conﬁ - dence . ” Trust - sensitive transactions include those in which goods and services are provided in exchange for future payment , em - ployment contracts in which managers rely on employees to ac - complish tasks that are difﬁcult to monitor , and investments and savings decisions that rely on assurances by governments or banks that they will not expropriate these assets . Individuals in higher - trust societies spend less to protect themselves from being exploited in economic transactions . Written contracts are less likely to be needed , and they do not have to specify every possible contingency . Litigation may be less frequent . Individuals in high - trust societies are also likely to divert fewer resources to pro - tecting themselves—through tax payments , bribes , or private security services and equipment—from unlawful ( criminal ) violations of their property rights . Low trust can also discourage innovation . If entrepreneurs must devote more time to monitor - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1252 ing possible malfeasance by partners , employees , and suppliers , they have less time to devote to innovation in new products or processes . 1 Societies characterized by high levels of trust are also less dependent on formal institutions to enforce agreements . Informal credit markets dependent on strong interpersonal trust can facili - tate investment where there is no well - developed formal system of ﬁnancial intermediation , or where lack of assets limits access to bank credit . Interpersonal trust can also provide an imperfect substitute for government - backed property rights or contract en - forcement where governments are unable or unwilling to pro - vide them . Government ofﬁcials in societies with higher trust may be perceived as more trustworthy , and their policy pronouncements as thus being more credible . To the extent that this is true , trust also triggers greater investment and other economic activity . Promises by central bankers that they will not raise interest rates , assurances by ministers of ﬁnance that a nominal ex - change rate anchor is ﬁxed in stone , and guarantees that tax leg - islation will not be rapidly amended are all likely to be more credible in societies where people trust each other more . As a con - sequence , in such societies people adopt more appropriate hori - zons in making investment decisions , and choose production technologies that are optimal over the long , rather than short , run . Trusting societies not only have stronger incentives to inno - vate and to accumulate physical capital , but are also likely to have higher returns to accumulation of human capital . Where trust improves access to credit for the poor , enrollment in second - ary education—which , unlike primary education , has a high cost in forgone income—may be higher [ Galor and Zeira 1993 ] . As shown in Section IV , trust and civic involvement are linked to better performance of government institutions , including publicly provided education [ Putnam 1993 ; La Porta et al . 1997 ; Coleman 1988 ] . Higher - quality schools increase the return to education . Where trust facilitates the enforcement of contracts , the return to specialized education will increase . Finally , in low - trust societies , hiring decisions will be inﬂuenced more by trustworthy personal attributes of applicants , such as blood ties or personal knowledge , DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1253 1 . This assumption is contained in Clague’s [ 1993 ] model of “rule obedience” and organizational performance . and less by educational credentials , than in high - trust societies , reducing the returns to acquisition of educational credentials in low - trust societies . Norms of civic cooperation can be linked with economic out - comes in some of the same ways as trust . Cooperative norms act as constraints on narrow self - interest , leading individuals to con - tribute to the provision of public goods of various kinds . Internal ( e . g . , guilt ) and external ( e . g . , shame and ostracism ) sanctions associated with norms alter the costs and beneﬁts of cooperating and defecting in prisoner’s dilemmas [ Coleman 1990 ] . For many collective action problems , norms leading to coop - erative solutions impose serious negative externalities on non - players . For example , in the classic prisoner’s dilemma game , the payoffs to two cooperating criminals are higher than if they both defect . “Civic norms , ” such as the norm against littering , are de - ﬁned here as those that resolve prisoner’s dilemmas without im - posing substantial external costs on other parties ( unlike cartel arrangements , for example ) . They improve allocative efﬁciency from a societal standpoint : the total beneﬁts to society from at - taining cooperative outcomes far exceed the total costs . To the extent that civic norms effectively constrain opportunism , the costs of monitoring and enforcing contracts are likely to be lower , raising the payoffs to many investments and other economic transactions . In addition to the more direct effects on economic activity outlined above , trust and civic norms may improve economic out - comes indirectly , through political channels . They may improve governmental performance and the quality of economic policies , by affecting the level and character of political participation . Knowledge of politics and public affairs by large numbers of citi - zens , and their participation , are important potential checks on the ability of politicians and bureaucrats to enrich themselves or narrow interests that they are allied with . But self - interested citizens will rationally decline to vote or to acquire information about the performance of ofﬁcials . Civic norms help voters ( prin - cipals ) overcome the collective action problem in monitoring ofﬁcials ( agents ) . Putnam [ 1993 ] has shown that regional govern - ments in the more - trusting , more civic - minded northern and cen - tral parts of Italy provide public services more effectively than do those in the less - trusting , less civic south . Moreover , citizen - initiated contacts with government ofﬁcials in the south tend to involve issues of narrowly personal concerns , while contacts in QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1254 the more trusting regions tend to involve larger issues with impli - cations for the welfare of the region as a whole . 2 Survey evidence from the United States is consistent with these ﬁndings . Among respondents in the 1992 American National Elections Study ( NES ) , interpersonal trust is a signiﬁcant predictor of various participatory attitudes and behaviors . Controlling for income and education , trust is associated with an 8 . 6 percentage - point in - crease in the probability of voting , and with similar increases in interest in political campaigns and in public affairs generally , and with agreement that voting is a civic duty . 3 III . M EASURING T RUST AND C IVIC N ORMS In a critique of Fukuyama [ 1995 ] , Solow [ 1995 ] argues that if social capital is to be more than a “buzzword” its stock “should somehow be measurable , even inexactly , ” but “measurement seems very far away . ” In this study , we use survey indicators that are no doubt inexact—due to translation difﬁculties , sampling er - ror , and response bias—but which produce values that are consis - tent with data from independent sources ( as described below ) . The World Values Surveys contain survey data on thousands of respondents from 29 market economies : 21 in the 1981 sur - veys , and 28 in the 1990 – 1991 surveys , with 29 represented in at least one of these two survey waves . 4 Some groups—for example , city - dwellers and the better - educated—are oversampled in some countries [ Inglehart 1994 ] . As a correction , we use the weight variable provided in the data in computing country - level means . Higher - status groups still tend to be overrepresented , particu - larly in the less developed countries , even with use of the weight variable [ Inglehart 1994 ] . This problem should have the effect DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1255 2 . Political participation can be motivated by groups based on class , ethnic , or other ties seeking to use government for their own ends at the expense of the larger society . Putnam [ 1993 ] implicitly assumes that these inefﬁcient effects of enhanced participation are outweighed by the efﬁcient effects . Our measures of trust and civic norms , as explained below , appear to reﬂect attitudes toward coop - eration more broadly , not only with those one associates or identiﬁes with . 3 . See Knack [ 1992 ] for related evidence . 4 . Both “Britain” and Northern Ireland are included in the surveys . We treat Britain’s values as representing the United Kingdom ( Northern Ireland accounts for less than 3 percent of the latter’s population ) . Many nonmarket economies were included in the 1990 – 1991 surveys . Following Barro [ 1991 ] and others , we have not included them in our analyses , because of the lack of available data on education and other variables , and because economic performance is driven by different processes in nonmarket economies . The Eastern European nations and ex - Soviet republics tend to have low values for our trust measure ; China’s 60 . 3 percent ranks among the highest , however . of attenuating the variation in our measures of trust and civic cooperation—which tend to be positively correlated with income and education levels—making it more difﬁcult to reject null hypotheses involving these variables . The question used to assess the level of trust in a society is : “Generally speaking , would you say that most people can be trusted , or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people ? ” Our trust indicator ( TRUST ) is the percentage of respondents in each nation replying “most people can be trusted” ( after deleting the “don’t know” responses ) . The mean value is 35 . 8 percent , with a standard deviation of 14 percent ( see Data Appendix for coun - try values ) . This trust item is somewhat ambiguous with respect to which “people” respondents have in mind . The term “people” is general enough that responses should not merely reﬂect expecta - tions about the behavior of friends and family . 5 Responses , how - ever , could easily reﬂect a varying mix of two concepts across individuals : how much trust one places in people who are not close friends or relatives , and the frequency of encounters with such persons . People in low - trust environments will transact more with close friends and relatives than with strangers , com - pared with people in high - trust environments . If by “most people” respondents consider most people that they transact with , the variation in our trust measure will be reduced , making it more difﬁcult to reject null hypotheses regarding the effects of trust . The strength of norms of civic cooperation is assessed from responses to question about whether each of the following behav - iors “can always be justiﬁed , never be justiﬁed or something in between . ” a ) “claiming government beneﬁts which you are not enti - tled to” b ) “avoiding a fare on public transport” c ) “cheating on taxes if you have the chance” d ) “keeping money that you have found” e ) “failing to report damage you’ve done accidentally to a parked vehicle . ” QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1256 5 . In 26 countries in our sample , respondents in the 1990 surveys were asked how much they trusted “your family . ” Responses were on a ﬁve - point scale ranging from “trust them completely” to “do not trust them at all . ” Means of this scale were correlated with TRUST across countries at only . 24 . Trust in the family— unlike TRUST , as shown below—is uncorrelated with economic and governmental performance , formal constraints on chief executives , income equality , and ethnic homogeneity . Respondents chose a number from 1 ( never justiﬁable ) to 10 ( al - ways justiﬁable ) . We reversed these scales , so that larger values indicate greater cooperation , and summed values over the ﬁve items to create a scale ( CIVIC ) with a 50 - point maximum . Each of these ﬁve items reﬂects the strength of civic norms as that concept is deﬁned above ; cooperative solutions to these prisoner’s dilemmas impose few or no costs on nonplayers . The mean value for CIVIC is 39 . 4 , with a standard deviation of only 2 . As it is based on multiple survey items , each with numerous response categories , CIVIC may be more discriminating than TRUST , which is based on an item with only two response catego - ries . On the other hand , respondents are likely to be far more reluctant to admit to cheating the government , taxpayers , or other people than to agree that others cheat . This problem may introduce substantial measurement error into CIVIC , likely ac - counting in part for its low variation across countries . We use TRUST as our primary social capital indicator in our empirical tests , because it is more directly relevant to economic activity— as indicated by the greater attention the concept has received in the literature—and because CIVIC exhibits so little variation across countries . However , results for CIVIC are in most cases very similar , and we often report results using both measures . Data from experiments conducted by the Reader’s Digest ( as reported in The Economist , June 22 , 1996 ) provide reassuring be - havioral evidence for the validity of these survey measures . Twenty wallets containing $ 50 worth of cash and the addresses and phone numbers of their putative owners were “accidentally” dropped in each of twenty cities , selected from fourteen different western European countries . Ten wallets were similarly “lost” in each of twelve U . S . cities . The number of wallets returned with their contents intact was recorded for each city . The percentage of wallets returned in each country closely tracks the WVS mea - sures : it is correlated with TRUST at . 67 , and with item ( d ) of the CIVIC index , on the acceptability of “keeping money that you have found” at . 52 ( partial correlations controlling for per capita income are even higher ) . Correlations with the other four CIVIC items are all somewhat lower . This evidence indicates that non - random samples , translation problems , and discrepancies be - tween professed attitudes and actual behaviors do not introduce severe noise into our survey - based measures of social capital . The high correlation of TRUST with the percentage of wal - lets returned ( by strangers ) , and its relatively low correlation DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1257 with trust in family members , indicate that TRUST is primarily capturing “generalized” trust as opposed to “speciﬁc” trust placed in people one has repeated interactions with . Similarly , CIVIC is deﬁned by attitudes toward cooperating with anonymous others in prisoner’s dilemma settings . These characteristics of our social capital measures reduce the chances that they are measuring trust and cooperation largely at the level of limited groups based on kinship , ethnic , or special interest ties , which have potentially large negative effects on economic performance . Cooperation and trust among these limited groups may facilitate their organiza - tion for rent - seeking purposes or even for violent conﬂict . The variables TRUST and CIVIC are in some sense mirror images of each other . The survey item on trust measures expecta - tions of whether others will act opportunistically at one’s ex - pense ; TRUST therefore reﬂects the percentage of people in a society who expect that most others will act cooperatively in pris - oner’s dilemma contexts . Our measure of civic cooperation re - ﬂects respondents’ own stated willingness to cooperate when faced with a collective action problem ; it thus can be thought of as “trustworthiness . ” One would naturally expect trust and trustworthiness to be positively correlated across societies : where fewer people prove to be trustworthy , fewer people will be trusting [ Hardin 1992 , p . 161 ] . Causation likely runs the other way , also , as many people are “conditional cooperators” who act cooperatively only when they have high expectations that others will reciprocate [ Hardin 1982 ] , in contrast to “Kantians” who follow moral rules prescrib - ing cooperation regardless of what others do . Thus , “not only do expectations affect honest behavior , but over time honest behav - ior affects expectations” [ Platteau 1994 , p . 760 ] . Figure I depicts the positive relationship between TRUST and CIVIC in our sample . 6 IV . T RUST , C IVIC C OOPERATION , AND E CONOMIC P ERFORMANCE Little evidence directly connects trust and civic cooperation to economic performance . Narayan and Pritchett [ 1996 ] ﬁnd for a sample of Tanzanian villages that higher levels of associational memberships are related to higher incomes . Economic historians QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1258 6 .

For example , Greif [ 1989 ] shows that the development of formal institutions that promote trust ( self - enforcing agreements ) had a dramatic impact on the spread of long distance trade in the Middle Ages . Helliwell and Putnam [ 1995 ] show that , holding initial in - come constant , regions of Italy with a more developed “civic com - munity” had higher growth rates over the 1950 – 1990 period . They measure “civic community” by a composite index of newspa - per readership , the density of sports and cultural associations , turnout in referenda , and the incidence of preference voting . Us - ing WVS data , Helliwell [ 1996a ] ﬁnds trust ( and group member - ships ) to be signiﬁcantly and negatively related to productivity growth in a sample of seventeen OECD members . 7 We test the impact of trust and civic norms on both growth and investment rates using the WVS indicators described above . To minimize endogeneity problems , we measure performance subsequent to the measurement of trust and civic cooperation DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1259 F IGURE I Civic Cooperation and Trust 7 . His sample omits the poor and middle - income nations for which we report below that trust has the largest effects . He also uses 1990 data on trust , rather than from the early 1980s , and controls only for initial income . wherever possible . As other explanatory variables we include , fol - lowing much of the literature since Barro [ 1991 ] , the proportion of eligible students enrolled in secondary and primary schools in 1960 , per capita income at the beginning of the period , and the price level of investment goods , relative to the United States . 8 The dependent variable in equations 1 – 3 of Table I is average annual growth in per capita income over the 1980 – 1992 period . Our 29 - nation sample over this period behaves similarly to the larger sample and longer time periods used by Barro [ 1991 ] . In - comes converge , conditional on the other variables . School enroll - ment is positively related to growth , and investment goods prices are negatively related to growth . The social capital variables exhibit a strong and signiﬁcant relationship to growth . The coefﬁcient for TRUST in equation 1 indicates that a ten - percentage - point rise in that variable is asso - ciated with an increase in growth of four - ﬁfths of a percentage point . A one - standard - deviation change in trust ( fourteen per - centage points ) is associated with a change in growth of more than one - half ( . 56 ) of a standard deviation , nearly as large as the standardized coefﬁcient for primary education ( . 64 ) . Each four - point rise in the 50 - point CIVIC scale in equation 2 is associated with an increase in growth of more than one percentage point . When both social capital variables are entered together in equa - tion 3 , their coefﬁcients drop slightly but remain signiﬁcant . Equation 4 introduces an interaction term , equal to TRUST * GDP80 . The impact of TRUST on growth should be higher in poorer countries , if trust is more essential where con - tracts are not reliably enforced by the legal system , and where access to formal sources of credit is more limited due to an under - developed ﬁnancial sector . 9 On the other hand , if greater special - ization increases the number of transactions between strangers , and over time and across space [ Platteau 1994 , p . 541 ] , trust should reduce transactions costs more in richer than in poorer countries [ Putnam 1993 , p . 178 ] . The negative and signiﬁcant co - efﬁcient on TRUST * GDP80 in equation 4 provides support for the former argument . For a country with a per capita GDP in 1980 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1260 8 .

The social capital variables are measured near the beginning of our sample period for 21 of our 29 countries . For the other eight , measuring trust in 1990 could introduce reverse causation problems . Deleting these eight reduces the signiﬁcance of all of the regressors , particularly GDP80 , SEC60 , and PI80 . Coefﬁ - cients for the social capital variables rise in most cases when these eight countries are deleted , suggesting that reverse causal - ity is not driving our results . This result is not surprising in light of the fact that for the twenty countries with TRUST values for both 1981 and 1990 , the correlation between the two is . 91 . In equation 5 of Table I we instrument for TRUST to correct for endogeneity problems , or possible measurement error . Sulli - van [ 1991 ] measures the percentage of a country’s population be - longing to the largest “ethnolinguistic” group , where groups are identiﬁed by race , language , or religion depending on which of these appears to be the most important cleavage in a society . As a second instrument , we use the number of law students in 1963 as a percentage of all postsecondary students . 10 Instrumenting for TRUST with these two variables and all of the other right - hand - side variables , TRUST remains a signiﬁcant predictor of growth ( equation 5 ) . 11 We would expect TRUST and CIVIC to affect growth through innovations that increase total factor productivity , and through factor accumulation . When investment’s share of GDP is included QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1262 10 . The source is the 1965 UNESCO Statistical Yearbook . Data are from 1962 – 1964 . Murphy , Shleifer , and Vishny [ 1991 ] used similar measures of law and engineering students . Less trusting , more litigious , and more crime - ridden societies will have a higher demand for lawyers , as will more polarized societies in which special interests lobby governments for rent . But lawyers may also be in higher demand where formal institutions such as courts work better . For example , Putnam [ 1993 , pp . 126 – 127 ] attributes the proliferation of “notaries , lawyers , and judges” in the Italian city - states to the “unusual conﬁdence in written agreements , in negotiation , and in the law” rather than to “contentiousness . ” In our sample , there is a strong , negative relationship between TRUST and lawyers . A Hausman test of the overidentifying restrictions indicates that the homogeneity and law students variables do not belong in the growth regression directly . 11 . Instrumenting for TRUST with distance from the equator , as measured by Hall and Jones [ 1996 ] , produces a 2SLS coefﬁcient estimate for TRUST of . 158 ( SE 5 . 086 ) . Hall and Jones use this variable as a climate indicator , arguing that temperate regions have an advantage over tropical or polar regions ; they ﬁnd empirically , however , that income per worker increases ( roughly ) linearly with latitude over the observable range . This variable is correlated with TRUST in our sample at . 63 . A Hausman test indicates that latitude does not inﬂuence growth independently of its effects on trust in our sample . as a regressor in growth equations , coefﬁcients for TRUST and CIVIC remain positive but are no longer statistically signiﬁcant , suggesting that accumulation is the more important channel . 12 Similar effects are observed with measures of human capital accumulation . When secondary enrollment is omitted from the regressions , TRUST and CIVIC coefﬁcients rise , as expected , given the arguments from Section II that social capital inﬂuences human capital accumulation . Substituting attainment measures for the enrollment variables reduces the TRUST and CIVIC coefﬁcients somewhat . The growth effects of TRUST and CIVIC remain signiﬁcant using literacy rates , or Kyriacou’s [ 1991 ] esti - mates of average years of completed education for 1980 . The so - cial capital coefﬁcients diminish much more using average years of completed education for 1980 as estimated by Barro and Lee [ 1993 ] , 13 but even then the log of TRUST remains a signiﬁcant predictor of growth . 14 Equations 6 and 7 of Table I examine the impact of social capital on investment / GDP , averaged over the 1980 – 1992 period , controlling for other determinants of investment . Trust is posi - tively correlated with investment in equation 6 , but is signiﬁcant at the . 05 level only for a one - tailed test . Each seven - percentage - point rise in trust is associated with a one - point rise in invest - ment’s share of GDP . Civic norms are highly signiﬁcant in equa - tion 7 , with each one - point rise in the index associated with an increase in investment of nearly one percentage point . The results in Table I are fairly insensitive to changes in speciﬁcation , the exclusion of inﬂuential observations , and the in - clusion of additional regressors . These ﬁndings are especially re - markable given the small sample size .

The effects of TRUST and CIVIC prove to be robust to the inclusion of other variables often used in growth regressions , in - DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1265 F IGURE II Partial Regression Plot : Growth ( 1980 – 1992 ) and Trust dicating that they are not merely capturing the effects of impor - tant omitted variables . Table II ( beginning with the fourth row ) indicates how coefﬁcients and standard errors for TRUST and CIVIC change when the indicated additional regressor is in - cluded in the relevant growth or investment equation . Most of the added regressors are signiﬁcant predictors of growth , but not of investment , in our sample . Estimates for TRUST and CIVIC are changed little by add - ing labor force growth , trade openness ( as measured by exports plus imports divided by GDP ) , M 2 / GDP ( the primary measure of ﬁnancial development measure used by King and Levine [ 1993 ] , the black market premium , or the property rights indicator from ICRG ( International Country Risk Guide ) introduced by Knack and Keefer [ 1995 ] . In results not shown in Table II , TRUST and CIVIC also prove insensitive to the inclusion of the mineral sec - tor’s share of GDP , or the government size and political instabil - ity indicators used in Barro [ 1991 ] . Other policy variables affect the social capital estimates to a somewhat greater extent , but in ways that are consistent with our theory . These are policies that are particularly sensitive to social polarization , which we expect to be associated with ( and measured in part by ) low trust and weaker civic norms . For ex - ample , difﬁculty in implementing stabilization programs has been attributed to polarization associated with inequalities in in - come and wealth , and with ethnic tensions [ Berg and Sachs 1988 ; Keefer and Knack 1995 ] . In more polarized societies , groups are more willing to impose costs on society , for example , by failing to compromise on a reform program in a timely way . High inﬂation and government debt could therefore be a product in part of low social cohesiveness . Table II shows that coefﬁcients for TRUST and CIVIC fall—although usually remaining signiﬁcant— when currency depreciation , 16 or international bankers’ evalua - tions of the creditworthiness of governments , are added to the regressions . 17 A more direct approach to social polarization is to examine inequality , a source of polarization that has been linked to unsta - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1266 16 . If trust is reduced by untrustworthy behavior by government ofﬁcials , its impact on economic performance could be associated with policy credibility . This possibility is a second explanation of why the TRUST coefﬁcient may decline when currency depreciation is included in the equation . 17 . These variables are averages over the 1980 – 1990 period . Institutional Investor conducts the survey of international bankers ; this measure of creditwor - thiness is also used in Keefer and Knack [ 1995 ] . ble macro policy and to uncertain property rights . 18 There are theoretical reasons to expect inequality to lower trust and weaken civic norms . ( This issue is addressed in more detail in Section VII . ) The Gini coefﬁcient for income inequality is strongly correlated with TRUST ( r 52 . 65 ) and with CIVIC ( 2 . 43 ) . When this Gini is added to our regressions ( see Table II ) , the TRUST coefﬁcient declines to . 059 ( but remains signiﬁcant at the . 05 level ) , while the CIVIC slope drops to . 099 . Inequality is not sig - niﬁcant in investment equations , however , where it has little impact on TRUST and CIVIC . 19 While there appears to be an im - portant relationship between inequality and social capital , the social capital variables remain signiﬁcant in three out of four cases with inequality in the model , suggesting that TRUST and CIVIC in Table I are not solely capturing redistributional or other effects of inequality . If trust and civic norms are viewed as “culture” variables that change only slowly over time , TRUST and CIVIC as mea - sured in the early 1980s should explain cross - country variation in long - term economic performance , as measured by investment or growth rates over 20 - or 30 - year periods , or even by per capita income levels . This assumption may be reasonable , as TRUST values for 1980 and 1990 are correlated at . 91 . Moreover , changes in TRUST over the decade are uncorrelated with growth rates . However , there are both theoretical and empirical reasons for caution regarding the assumption that trust and the strength of civic norms are stable over long periods of time . Cooperative equi - libria can unravel very quickly , as Yugoslavia demonstrates . The United States , the one country with a long time series on the trust survey measure , shows a steady decline in trust from 55 to 60 percent in surveys from the late 1950s and early 1960s , to the mid - and upper - 30s in the 1990s . With these caveats we report tests of long - term performance below , investigating longer - period growth and investment rates as well as levels of output per worker . The last two rows of Table II show the association of TRUST and CIVIC on investment levels and income growth for the 1970 – 1992 and 1960 – 1992 periods . 20 Investment results are very simi - DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1267 18 .

Figure III depicts the simple correlation of TRUST and investment / GDP for the 1960 – 1992 period . Coefﬁcients in growth regressions fall by more than one - half , relative to the shorter period . The effect of TRUST , but not CIVIC , remains signiﬁcant at the . 05 level for a one - tailed test . 21 The weaker relationship between social capital and growth in the longer periods is driven mainly by three low - trust coun - tries that grew slowly , if at all , in the 1980 – 1992 period , but rap - idly in the 1960s and 1970s—in part through dramatic increases in oil prices in the case of Nigeria , large inﬂows of debt in the case of Brazil , and a combination of the two in the case of Mexico . An ( admittedly ex post facto ) explanation of the experiences of these countries may be consistent with our theory . If trust is weak , leaders are more likely to direct revenue windfalls toward QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1268 F IGURE III Investment / GDP ( 1960 – 1992 ) and Trust 21 . For these longer periods , TRUST and CIVIC remain signiﬁcantly related to investment when additional regressors listed in Table II ( appropriately modi - ﬁed for the longer period ) are added . For growth , TRUST and CIVIC coefﬁcients remain positive in every case but are rarely signiﬁcant when other regressors are added . consumption than toward productive investments . Because of low trust , leaders cannot credibly promise supporters future beneﬁts from worthwhile investments . To maintain support , leaders must divert resources to supporters who , again because of low trust , do not ﬁnd it advantageous to invest these resources in productive investments inside the country—making the country more vul - nerable to crisis . Moreover , once crisis hits , the lack of social cohe - siveness reﬂected in low values of TRUST and CIVIC makes it less likely that a consensus on needed policy reforms can be built . We also analyze the relationship between TRUST and levels of output per worker , physical and human capital per worker , and total factor productivity ( TFP ) , following the levels accounting approach of Hall and Jones [ 1996 ] and using data provided by them . Table III reports the relationship of TRUST with ( 1 ) the log of output per worker , net of mineral production , for 1988 ( from Summers and Heston [ 1991 ] ) , ( 2 ) the Hall and Jones estimate of ( the log of ) capital per worker for 1988 ( using investment data from Summers and Heston ) , ( 3 ) human capital per worker ( the Barro - Lee [ 1993 ] attainment measure for 1985 ) , and ( the log of ) TFP for 1988 , estimated by Hall and Jones as a residual .

Full Hall - Jones model includes latitude ( distance from the equator ) , percent English - speaking , percent speaking an - other “international language , ” a dummy for “capitalist - statist” systems ( as contrasted to “capitalist” ) , frac - tion of years , 1950 – 1994 , with open economy ( from Sachs and Warner [ 1995 ] ) , and the ICRG property rights index ( from Knack and Keefer [ 1995 ] ) . Sample size is 29 . cantly correlated with output , capital , and schooling , while the correlation with TFP is positive but insigniﬁcant . 22 Hall and Jones [ 1996 ] report regressions of each of these four variables on a set of variables ( listed in the note to Table III ) that they contend are exogenous and that measure “basic characteris - tics” of an economy . When TRUST is added to their full model , its coefﬁcient is signiﬁcant only for schooling ( column 2 of Table III ) . Theory and evidence provided elsewhere in this paper strongly suggest that policy is endogenous to trust : accordingly , in column 3 of Table III we delete from the regressions the two policy vari - ables used by Hall and Jones : the ICRG property rights index from Knack and Keefer [ 1995 ] , and the openness measure from Sachs and Warner [ 1995 ] . As in the simple bivariate regressions , output , capital , and schooling are all signiﬁcantly related to TRUST when these policy variables are dropped . The most pow - erful “determinant” of output , factor accumulation , and TFP in Hall and Jones [ 1996 ] is latitude ( distance in degrees from the equator ) , a variable with an ambiguous theoretical interpreta - tion , and which is highly correlated with TRUST . When latitude and the two policy variables are dropped from the models in col - umn 4 of Table III , coefﬁcients for TRUST are all larger than in the bivariate regressions , although still not signiﬁcant in the case of TFP . Causality could go in both directions for income and trust , and for education and trust . For example , trust could be a prod - uct of optimism [ Uslaner 1995 ] generated by high or growing in - comes . But if trust were largely a product rather than a cause of high incomes , it should follow rather than lead per capita income levels . In fact , TRUST is more strongly correlated with per capita incomes in later years , such as 1990 , than with income in earlier years , such as 1970 . Similarly , education may strengthen trust and civic norms , for example , if ignorance breeds distrust , or if learning reduces uncertainty about the behavior of others , or if students are taught to behave cooperatively [ Mueller 1989 , pp . 364 – 365 ) . 23 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1270 22 . Measurement error may be partly responsible for this low correlation , as implausibly high TFP estimates are concentrated among low - trust countries in our sample . For example , TFP estimates are far higher for Mexico , Italy , and Brazil than for Norway , Finland , Denmark , and Sweden ( and higher than for Ger - many , Switzerland , and the United States ) . 23 . The rise of Japan in the late nineteenth century coincided with a government - initiated shift from “limited - group” morality to a more generalized morality , using the system of universal compulsory education as an important tool in this campaign [ Platteau 1994 ] . However , TRUST is more highly correlated with recent than with past measures of attainment or enrollment , suggesting that cau - sality does not run solely from education to social capital . V . A SSOCIATIONAL A CTIVITY AND E CONOMIC P ERFORMANCE The importance of trust in expanding economic activity is perhaps not surprising , although not previously empirically sub - stantiated at the cross - country level . The role of associational ac - tivity is a subject of greater contention . Putnam attributes the economic success and governmental efﬁciency of northern Italy , relative to the south , in large part to its richer associational life , claiming that associations “instill in their members habits of co - operation , solidarity , and public - spiritedness” [ Putnam 1993 , pp . 89 – 90 ] . This cooperation and solidarity is invoked most com - monly to resolve collective action problems at the level of smaller groups , however . If the economic goals of a group conﬂict with those of other groups or of unorganized interests , the overall ef - fect of group memberships and activities on economic perfor - mance could be negative . Adam Smith ( quoted in Granovetter [ 1985 , p . 484 ] ) noted that when “people of the same trade” meet “even for merriment and diversion” the result is often “a conspir - acy against the public” or “some contrivance to raise prices . ” In a more extreme example , Marx blamed the inability of the nine - teenth century French peasantry to overthrow capitalism on the absence of dense networks of social interaction : the peasants did not enter into “manifold relations with one another . . . ” ( quoted in Hardin [ 1982 , p . 189 ] ) . Similarly , Olson [ 1982 ] observes that horizontal associations can hurt growth because many of them act as special interest groups lobbying for preferential policies that impose disproportionate costs on society . Keefer and Knack [ 1993 ] provide some evidence for the con - ﬂicting inﬂuences of associational activity on growth , using a variable from Banks and Textor [ 1963 ] called “interest articula - tion” which assesses ( on a subjective scale ranging from 1 to 4 ) how effectively groups articulate their policy preferences to gov - ernment . Although the ability of groups to articulate their inter - ests is likely to be an important restraint on government , it also provides groups a way to capture private beneﬁts at the expense of society . Consistent with the view that these two effects tend to counteract each other , “interest articulation” proves to be an insigniﬁcant predictor of growth when introduced into Barro - type cross - country tests . DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1271 We obtain a similar result here on the inﬂuence of horizontal associations . Respondents in the World Values Surveys were asked whether they belonged to any of the following types of organizations : a ) social welfare services for elderly , handicapped , or de - prived people ; b ) religious or church organizations ; c ) education , arts , music , or cultural activities ; d ) trade unions ; e ) political parties or groups ; f ) local community action on issues like poverty , employ - ment , housing , racial equality ; g ) third world development or human rights ; h ) conservation , the environment , ecology ; i ) professional associations ; j ) youth work ( e . g . , scouts , guides , youth clubs , etc . ) . 24 Our measure of the density of associational activity ( GROUPS ) is the average number of groups cited per respondent in each coun - try ( see Data Appendix for values ) . This indicator unfortunately does not measure the intensity of participation in groups . Assum - ing that group memberships are correlated with levels of activity , GROUPS constitutes a reasonable approximation of Put - nam’s notion of the density of horizontal networks in a society . 25 Independent data on union memberships as a proportion of the labor force are available from Wallerstein [ 1989 ] , for eighteen of the countries in our sample ( for the late 1970s ) , permitting a check on the reliability of the survey data . The correlation of this variable with item ( d ) on trade union memberships is a reassuring . 68 . In Table IV we test the relationship between GROUPS and economic performance , using models similar to those in Table I . Group membership is not signiﬁcant in either growth or invest - ment equations . 26 An obvious possible explanation for this result QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1272 24 . “Sports and recreation clubs”—of particular interest in Putnam’s work— and other groups were also included in the survey , but for too few countries to be analyzed . Group memberships for most countries are from the 1981 wave of sur - veys , and from the 1990 wave for the others , as with TRUST and CIVIC . 25 . Putnam [ 1995b ] uses similar measures of associations from the WVS and , for the United States , from the General Social Survey . 26 . The sample size drops from 29 in Table I to 26 in Table IV , as there are no data on group memberships for India , Nigeria , or Turkey . The greater mea - sured impact of TRUST and CIVIC relative to GROUPS is not due to the changing sample , however : coefﬁcients for TRUST and CIVIC in Table I actually rise when those three countries are dropped . is that the harmful effects of groups as rent - seeking organiza - tions theorized by Olson [ 1982 ] are offsetting any positive effects posited by Putnam [ 1993 ] . We explored this possibility further by attempting to differ - entiate “Olsonian” from “Putnam - esque” groups . Groups b , c , and j from the above list were identiﬁed as those groups least likely to act as “distributional coalitions” but which involve social inter - actions that can build trust and cooperative habits . The total memberships per respondent in these three “Putnam” categories ( P - GROUPS ) range from . 83 ( for the United States ) to . 06 ( Fin - land ) . Groups d , e , and i were deemed most representative of groups with redistributive goals ; total memberships in these “Olson” groups per respondent ( O - GROUPS ) range from . 76 ( Ice - land ) to . 12 ( Korea ) . Membership in “Olson” groups is not signiﬁcant in either the growth or investment equations ( equations 2 and 4 ) .

Sample size is 26 . “Putnam” groups appear to harm investment ( equation 4 ) . These results are little changed by tinkering with the deﬁnitions of Put - nam and Olson groups , for example , by leaving out religious and church organizations from P - GROUPS , on the grounds that hier - archical religions weaken trust [ Putnam 1993 ] , or by deleting po - litical parties and groups from O - GROUPS , on the grounds that parties may be relatively “encompassing , ” aggregating the prefer - ences of many different groups [ Olson 1982 ] . This attempt at distinguishing types of groups thus provides no empirical support for our conjecture that groups have neutral effects on performance because positive “Putnam” forces are counterbalanced by negative “Olson” inﬂuences . 27 These tests can be regarded as only preliminary , however : the categories of groups are overly broad , it is not clear what some of these groups do , and the depth of involvement is not measured . While TRUST and CIVIC appear to capture generalized trust and norms of civic cooperation , our data on groups do not permit us to convincingly distinguish between socially efﬁcient and inefﬁcient member - ships and activities . VI . A DDITIONAL L INKS FROM T RUST TO G ROWTH This section further explores the channels through which trust might affect economic outcomes . Some of these channels must remain largely unexplored due to data limitations . Following arguments in Section II , we consider two possible channels here : the impact of trust on the strength of property and contractual rights , and the impact of trust on the performance of government . We constructed an index of perceived government perfor - mance from items in the WVS . Respondents were asked “how much conﬁdence” they had in various governmental and societal institutions , with responses ranging from “a great deal , ” to “quite a lot , ” to “not very much , ” to “none at all . ” The index was built from responses to items concerning the education system ( largely government - run in most countries ) , the legal system , the police , and the civil service . For each of these we calculated the percent - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1274 27 . Membership in groups classiﬁed here as “Putnam” groups could simply be proxying stronger preferences for leisure , which might harm measurable eco - nomic performance . Trade associations—“Olson” groups—do more than lobby for legal barriers to entry and tax breaks . They may have positive effects on economic performance by establishing ethical codes and standards [ Bergsten 1985 ] or by reducing transactions costs , e . g . , by spreading information about the identity of cheaters .

The mean of the four percentages is used as a measure of perceived overall government performance ( see Data Appendix for values ) . 28 Equation 1 of Table V regresses this index on TRUST , con - trolling for per capita income and education enrollments . 29 The only signiﬁcant determinant of government performance in this equation is TRUST : each two - percentage - point rise is associated with a rise in conﬁdence of about one percentage point .

Switzerland is the only one from our 29 - country sample in which these questions were not asked . While rankings suggest a certain amount of “face valid - ity” for this index , there are several anomalies . Japan scores poorly ( 46 percent ) and Nigeria scores very highly ( 73 . 1 percent ) . It is unclear to what extent these “conﬁdence” items reﬂect how responsive the government is to the narrowly self - interested demands of respondents , or how effectively it carries out its legally mandated responsibilities , or something else . 29 . Where incomes are higher , governments may have access to more tax revenue to provide better services , and better - educated citizens may place more effective demands on government to provide services efﬁciently . For alternative subjective measures of governmental perfor - mance , we use data from two ﬁrms that evaluate risks to foreign investors . For one index of bureaucratic efﬁciency , we create an additive index from two variables from International Country Risk Guide ( ICRG ) : “corruption in government” and “quality of the bureaucracy . ” The maximum possible value for this index is twelve ; higher scores indicate less corruption and higher - quality bureaucracies . For a second index of bureaucratic efﬁ - ciency , we add two variables from Business Environmental Risk Intelligence ( BERI ) : “bureaucratic delays” and “transportation and communications quality . ” The maximum possible score is eight , with higher scores indicating shorter delays and better infrastructure . 30 These ICRG and BERI variables are shown in Knack and Keefer [ 1995 ] to be strong predictors of investment and growth . Equations 2 and 3 of Table V show that these bureaucratic efﬁ - ciency indexes are positively and signiﬁcantly related to TRUST . This evidence suggests that the relationship between “social capi - tal” and governmental performance Putnam discovered for Italy may generalize across countries . Table V also demonstrates strong relationships between TRUST and two subjective measures of property rights security . In equations 4 and 5 the dependent variable is an index of two ICRG variables , “risk of repudiation of government contracts” and “risk of expropriation” of assets . The maximum possible value is twenty , with higher scores indicating lower risks . In equations 6 and 7 , the dependent variable is “contract enforce - ability , ” a BERI measure with a maximum value of four . Consistent with our tests of the determinants of government per - formance , we control for income and education . 31 In equations 4 and 6 TRUST is signiﬁcantly related to the ICRG and BERI prop - erty rights indicators . Equations 5 and 7 control for formal sources of secure property rights , with “executive constraints , ” a subjective variable coded by Gurr [ 1990 ] in his Polity II data set . Countries are scored on a 1 to 7 scale on the extent to which the executive of a country is able to rule by decree ( coded as 1 ) , or QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1276 30 . These indexes were created using averages over the 1980 – 1990 period for BERI and 1982 – 1990 for ICRG . All countries in our sample are included in ICRG data . Iceland is missing in BERI . 31 . High incomes may proxy the number and size of business transactions , which will be related to the “demand” for enforceable contracts , and may give the government access to more revenue to establish an effective judicial system . must gain the consent of others before acting ( coded 7 ) . The inde - pendent effect of TRUST on the ICRG index is reduced somewhat ( equation 5 ) , but TRUST remains a signiﬁcant determinant of the BERI measure . These preliminary explorations into the links between social capital and growth have provided some suggestive evidence that trust may improve governmental efﬁciency and increase invest - ors’ conﬁdence that contracts will be enforced . The evidence is not entirely unambiguous , however . We have not attempted to develop complete models of governmental performance or of the security of property rights , or enforceability of contracts . The ICRG and BERI measures that are strongly linked to economic performance in Knack and Keefer [ 1995 ] are not signiﬁcant pre - dictors of investment and growth in the small sample used here . The “conﬁdence in government” index constructed from WVS items does not predict investment rates , and is of only borderline signiﬁcance in a growth equation ( slope 5 . 035 ; SE 5 . 019 ) . Thus , we cannot directly explain the paths by which economic perfor - mance is related to TRUST and CIVIC in Table I . Neither have we addressed empirically the possibility of reverse causality , as the behavior of governments can inﬂuence levels of trust and civic cooperation [ Gambetta 1988 , pp . 158 – 163 ; Hardin 1992 ] . For ex - ample , where the police violate trafﬁc laws and norms , coopera - tive equilibria among drivers will tend to unravel . Finally , Table V results are much weaker when CIVIC is substituted for our primary indicator , TRUST . 32 VII . D ETERMINANTS OF T RUST AND C IVIC C OOPERATION Using the survey results and other data sources , we under - take a preliminary investigation of the determinants of trust and civic cooperation , an issue of special interest to policy makers . We test the effects of group memberships , income inequality and ethnic polarization , formal institutions for protecting property and contract rights , per capita income , and education rates . In Section V we argue that associational activity has ambigu - ous effects on economic performance : it may increase trust , but also facilitate rent - seeking . Here , we argue that even the rela - DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1277 32 . When GROUPS is substituted for TRUST in Table V , it is signiﬁcantly and positively related to two of the four dependent variables : “conﬁdence in gov - ernment , ” consistent with Putnam’s [ 1993 ] results , and the BERI contract en - forceability measure . tionship between associations and trust is double - edged . Involve - ment in formal or informal groups and associations ( the density of networks of horizontal association ) may build trust and civic - minded behavior [ Putnam 1993 ] . The underlying idea is that such relationships either break down information asymmetries or create a pattern of repeated interactions that allow self - enforcing agreements to be reached ; people who belong to such networks “trust” others who belong to them , and are more likely to exhibit civic behavior . However , many societies are polarized by ethnic , political , re - ligious , or income differences . Associations in such societies will often form along ( e . g . ) ethnic lines . These relatively homogeneous associations in heterogeneous societies may strengthen trust and cooperative norms within an ethnic group , but weaken trust and cooperation between those groups . This effect creates the poten - tial for a negative relationship between horizontal associations and trust or norms of civic cooperation when measured at the national level . Additionally , participation in formal groups may constitute only a small percentage of the social interactions that can build trust and cooperative norms . We therefore hypothesize that at best horizontal associations are only weakly related to trust or norms of civic cooperation . Even if a positive correlation were found , it could be attributable to reverse causality : high - trust individuals are more likely to join formal associations in which many transactions at least initially will involve interacting with strangers . Social polarization is a second possible determinant of trust and civic cooperation . Polarization by deﬁnition implies greater distances between preferences of individuals in a society . Individ - uals and groups in such a society have a greater incentive to re - nege on policy agreements [ Keefer and Knack 1995 ] . When policy coalitions are unstable , trust relations among individuals often break down . 33 In polarized societies , individuals are less likely to share common backgrounds and mutual expectations about be - havior , so it is more difﬁcult to make self - enforcing agreements . Platteau [ 1994 ] discusses examples of the importance of reli - gious and linguistic homogeneity in facilitating trade in West QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1278 33 . Weingast [ 1993 ] provides multiple examples , including the former Yugo - slavia , arguing that institutional guarantees of policy bargains related to inter - ethnic distributional issues disappeared with the fall of communist regimes , leading in short order to the breakdown of trust between individuals from differ - ent ethnic groups . Africa . Finally , polarization can increase rent - seeking activi - ties—whether legal , through the political system , or illegal , through theft—that undermine trust . Through any of these vari - ous channels , polarization can erode trust and weaken coopera - tive norms . We proxy for polarization using income inequality and ethnic homogeneity . A third possible determinant of trust and civic norms is the formal institutional structure of a country . Where these institu - tions restrain arbitrary behavior by government leaders , for ex - ample , government policies are likely to be more credible ( or trustworthy ) . If formal institutions enforce private agreements and laws more effectively , trust and adherence to civic norms among private citizens may be strengthened : 34 “In a Hobbesian view . . . trust is underwritten by a strong government to enforce contracts and to punish theft . Without such a government , coop - eration would be nearly impossible and trust would be irrational” [ Hardin 1992 , p . 161 ] . There is little empirical or theoretical research to provide guidance as to other determinants of trust and the strength of civic norms . 35 We control here for 1980 per capita income , and school enrollment in 1960 , recognizing that causality is likely not unidirectional . Tables VI and VII report results on the determinants of trust and civic cooperation . The effect of income is always positive , as expected , and is signiﬁcant in most of the TRUST equations . The effect of secondary education is uniformly positive , and often sig - niﬁcant . Coefﬁcients for primary education are always negative , and sometimes signiﬁcant . DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1279 34 . The relationship between trust and civic cooperation , on the one hand , and property rights and government performance on the other , is likely to be com - plex , with each inﬂuencing the other . Formal institutions can be substitutes for— as well as causes of—trust and civic cooperation . Societies with low trust require more robust formal institutions if they are to undertake the exchanges that are crucial to growth . 35 . Using individual - level data on group memberships for the United States , Germany , and Sweden from the WVS and other sources , Stolle and Rochon [ 1996 ] ﬁnd memberships increase trust , controlling for age , education , and income . They ﬁnd mixed evidence on whether groups that are more diverse ( in terms of age , socioeconomic status , ideology , and sex ) produce more trust among members . They acknowledge that their results could be inﬂuenced by self - selection . Helli - well [ 1996b ] , using individual - level WVS data for the United States and Canada , ﬁnds group members are more trusting , controlling for education and region . He ﬁnds no difference in the strength of this effect across different types of groups . Note that such individual - level analyses , unlike our aggregate - level analysis , can - not capture the external effects of group memberships on the trust and trustwor - thiness of nonmembers .

As Putnam [ 1995b ] has noted , there is a strong bivariate re - lationship between trust and group memberships across coun - tries . 36 However , we ﬁnd in equations 1 and 2 of Table VI that horizontal associations have no signiﬁcant effect on TRUST or CIVIC when income and education are controlled for , consistent with the ambiguities noted above on the effects of group member - ships . A possible explanation for this result is that groups with social goals are better than those with political goals at building trust and cooperative habits . In equations 3 and 4 we investigate this possibility using the distinction made in Section V between Putnam groups and Olson groups . Memberships in the more po - litically oriented “Olson” groups are associated , surprisingly , with stronger trust and cooperative attitudes , while the “Putnam” DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1281 TABLE VII D ETERMINANTS OF T RUST AND C IVIC C OOPERATION : P OLARIZATION Equation 1 2 3 4 Dependent variable TRUST CIVIC TRUST CIVIC Constant 57 . 938 47 . 704 25 . 717 39 . 883 ( 12 . 108 ) ( 2 . 112 ) ( 4 . 645 ) ( 1 . 710 ) GDP80 1 . 341 0 . 054 1 . 776 0 . 224 ( 0 . 516 ) ( 0 . 143 ) ( 0 . 473 ) ( 0 . 150 ) PRIM60 2 24 . 228 2 5 . 509 2 25 . 660 2 8 . 305 ( 7 . 137 ) ( 1 . 511 ) ( 8 . 219 ) ( 1 . 766 ) SEC60 17 . 425 0 . 906 5 . 968 1 . 313 ( 9 . 566 ) ( 2 . 667 ) ( 9 . 350 ) ( 2 . 413 ) Gini ( income ) 2 0 . 453 2 0 . 099 ( 0 . 173 ) ( 0 . 027 ) Ethnic 0 . 349 0 . 064 homogeneity ( 0 . 107 ) ( 0 . 023 ) Lawyers ( 1963 ) 2 1 . 254 0 . 012 ( 0 . 194 ) ( 0 . 068 ) Adj .

However , the marked decline in trust in the United States since the 1960s has not been accompanied by a decline in group memberships . Even if the two variables were correlated , causality arguably runs primarily from trust to groups rather than the other way around , as more trusting individuals may have a greater propensity to afﬁliate with strangers in groups . groups have no effect on trust ( equation 3 ) and appear to reduce civic cooperation ( equation 4 ) . 37 “Executive constraints” is positively and ( marginally ) sig - niﬁcantly related to both TRUST ( equation 5 ) and CIVIC ( equa - tion 6 ) . Each one - point rise in the seven - point Executive Constraints scale is associated with a rise in TRUST of 1 . 5 per - centage points . As a second proxy for formal institutions , we use a variable called “Independence of the courts” from Humana [ 1987 ] . This variable is a four - point scale , with higher numbers indicating greater independence of the judiciary from the chief executive . It is strongly related to TRUST ( equation 7 ) , with each one - point rise associated with an eight - percentage - point increase in TRUST . There is no relationship between independence of the judiciary and CIVIC , however ( results not shown ) . These results on formal institutions , although perhaps fraught with multiple directions of causation , constitute important evidence for the in - teraction of formal and informal institutions . Table VII analyzes the relationship between polarization and our measures of social capital . The Gini coefﬁcient for income in - equality is strongly associated with lower trust and civic coopera - tion ( equations 1 and 2 ) . Both TRUST and CIVIC increase sig - niﬁcantly with ethnic homogeneity ( equations 3 and 4 ) . With each three - point increase in the percentage belonging to the largest ethnic group , TRUST rises by one point . Each ﬁfteen - point in - crease in homogeneity increases CIVIC by one point . 38 Lawyers are also associated with low trust , whether as a signal of so - cial polarization or through some other channel . Each one - percentage - point increase in law students ( as a percentage of all postsecondary students in 1963 ) is associated with a decline in TRUST of more than one percentage point ( equation 3 ) . Lawyers are unrelated to CIVIC , however ( equation 4 ) . This section offers evidence for the following propositions . In - come equality and checks on executive power are associated with higher levels of trust and stronger norms of civic cooperation . Ethnic and linguistic divisions coincide with weakened trust and QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1282 37 . These results—as with those in Section V on group memberships and economic performance—are not sensitive to deleting religious organizations from P - GROUPS . 38 . Using individual - level WVS data , Helliwell [ 1996b ] found that U . S . and Canadian respondents classifying themselves ﬁrst in terms of ethnicity ( e . g . , Asian - American or French - Canadian ) and only secondarily in terms of nationality ( e . g . , American or Canadian ) were less trusting , controlling for education and region . civic norms . 39 Group memberships , in contrast , are unrelated to trust and norms . We also explored the effects of several other possible determi - nants of trust and civic cooperation which are less well - developed conceptually here for reasons of space . Urbanization , population , population density , and government size all proved insigniﬁ - cant . 40 Putnam [ 1993 ] views “hierarchical” religions such as Ca - tholicism as being inimical to horizontal ties and trust . Inglehart [ 1990 ] and Fukuyama [ 1995 ] , citing Weber , link Protestantism to higher trust . La Porta et al . [ 1997 ] report that trust is lower in countries with “dominant hierarchical religions” as measured by percent of the population that is Catholic , Orthodox Christian , or Mos - lem . We ﬁnd that Protestantism is associated with signiﬁcantly greater trust : each ﬁve - percentage - point rise in the number of Protestants ( from Taylor and Jodice [ 1983 ] ) is associated with a one - point rise in TRUST . When percent Protestant , percent Cath - olic , and percent Moslem are all included in a TRUST regression , coefﬁcients for the latter two regressors are signiﬁcantly nega - tive , while percent Protestant is positive but not signiﬁcant . 41 VIII . C ONCLUSION AND P OLICY I MPLICATIONS The notion of social capital is emerging with greater fre - quency in discussions of development , whether of poor countries or of chronically poor areas of industrialized countries . The elas - ticity of the term social capital has made progress in these discus - sions difﬁcult . Nevertheless , all concepts have in common the idea that trust and norms of civic cooperation are essential to well - functioning societies , and to the economic progress of those societies . This paper makes three contributions to these discus - sions . First , it provides some idea of the importance of these di - mensions of social capital , supplying the strongest evidence to date that trust and civic cooperation have signiﬁcant impacts on aggregate economic activity . Our second contribution is a negative one . Disputes about DOES SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A PAYOFF ? 1283 39 . As discussed above , the WVS indicators appear to measure generalized trust and civic norms . Inequality and ethnic heterogeneity may well strengthen cooperation and trust within certain limited groups . 40 . Taylor [ 1976 ] claims that large governments “crowd out” norms . Bu - chanan [ 1965 ] among others argues that the force of ethical rules weakens with larger numbers . 41 . Results are available on request . the role of social capital arise when one attempts to deﬁne how trust and norms of civic cooperation in a society can be strength - ened . Putnam [ 1993 ] has suggested that dense horizontal net - works reinforce trust and civic norms . However , we ﬁnd that horizontal networks—as measured by membership in groups— are unrelated to trust and civic norms ( controlling for education and income ) and to economic performance . The stronger impact on economic performance of trust and civic norms suggests that if declining social capital in the United States has adverse impli - cations for growth , it is the erosion of trust and civic cooperation as documented by Knack [ 1992 ] that are of greater concern than the decline in associational life emphasized by Putnam [ 1995a , 1995b ] . 42 Our third contribution is to demonstrate the importance of two sources of trust and civic norms . Low social polarization , and formal institutional rules that constrain the government from acting arbitrarily , are associated with the development of cooper - ative norms and trust . These results carry several implications for policy . Trust’s re - lationship to growth in our study is especially large in poorer countries , which may be attributable to their less well - developed ﬁnancial sectors , insecure property rights , and unreliable en - forceability of contracts . Interpersonal trust seems to be more im - portant in facilitating economic activity where formal substitutes are unavailable . This ﬁnding suggests that where interpersonal trust is low and unlikely to improve rapidly , institutional reforms providing better formal mechanisms for the reliable enforcement of contracts and access to credit are even more important than where trust is higher . Promoting horizontal associations through encouraging the formation of and participation in groups may be counterproduc - tive , according to our ﬁndings . Group memberships are not di - rectly related to economic performance , and are unrelated to trust . On the positive side , secondary education is shown here to be associated with trust , although determining causality is prob - lematic . Reforms in this area , already strongly supported by in - ternational agencies and donors for other reasons , may improve QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 1284 42 . Moreover , survey evidence indicates that membership in groups has been fairly stable in recent years in the United States . Putnam’s “decline” results from adjusting for the rise in education levels over time , which he justiﬁes on the basis of a positive cross - sectional relationship between years of education and group memberships .
