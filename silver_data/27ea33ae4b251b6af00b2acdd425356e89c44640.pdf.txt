Clathrin - mediated 25 endocytosis ( CME ) shows elevated actin assembly dependence under high membrane tension . 26 Why actin assembly at CME sites occurs heterogeneously even within the same cell , and how 27 assembly forces are harnessed , are not fully understood . Here , endocytic dynamics , actin 28 presence , and geometry of CME proteins from three different functional modules , were analyzed 29 using three - dimensional ( 3D ) super - resolution microscopy , live - cell imaging , and machine - 30 learning - based computation . When hundreds of CME events were compared , sites with actin 31 assembly showed a distinct signature , a delay between completion of coat expansion and vesicle 32 scission , indicating that actin assembly occurs preferentially at stalled CME sites . N - WASP is 33 recruited to one side of CME sites where it is positioned to stimulate asymmetric actin assembly . 34 We propose that asymmetric actin assembly rescues stalled CME sites by pulling vesicles into 35 the cell much like a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap . 36 37 Introduction 38 Formation of clathrin - coated vesicles requires forces to first bend the membrane into a 39 sphere or tube , and to then break the thin neck that connects the vesicle to the plasma membrane . 40 These forces are generated through the combined actions of actin filament assembly and proteins 41 that directly bend the membrane 1 – 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Several studies have demonstrated 42 that dependence of CME on actin assembly increases under elevated membrane tension 6 – 9 . 43 Interestingly , actin does not assemble at all CME sites in mammalian cells , suggesting highly 44 localized differences in requirement for actin assembly , that nature of which are obscure 10 – 12 . A 45 detailed understanding of how actin forces are harnessed to aid vesicle formation and scission , 46 3 and whether and how actin assembly might mediate an adaptive response to the opposing forces 47 such as membrane tension and turgor pressure , depends on understanding which CME sites 48 assembly actin , where filament assembly occurs around the endocytic membrane and when . In 49 yeast cells , where turgor pressure is particularly high , super - resolution data suggest that actin 50 assembles symmetrically around CME sites and indicate that actin regulators including Las17 , 51 which is yeast WASP , are present in a ring surrounding the base of the clathrin coat 52 symmetrically 13 . On the other hand , studies on fixed mammalian cells raised the possibility that 53 actin assembly may at least in some cases be initiated asymmetrically at clathrin coats 14 , 15 . 54 However , methods used for these studies prevented analysis of large numbers of sites , and 55 suffered from possible loss of actin filaments during unroofing and extraction of the cells . Which 56 CME sites assemble actin , and how actin networks are organized with respect to CME sites , has 57 not been determined systematically , in a large - scale , unbiased manner , particularly in live 58 mammalian cells . This information is essential to understanding how and why actin assembly 59 forces are harnessed for CME . 60 Here , by combining fixed and live - cell imaging of triple - genome - edited , human induced 61 pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) , and newly developed machine - learning - based computational 62 analysis tools , we report that N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex localize at one side of the coat and 63 neck of invaginating endocytic sites until the scission , similar to what was proposed 64 previously 14 , 15 . Most importantly , by comparing recruitment dynamics of proteins from three 65 distinct endocytic modules for over one thousand endocytic events , we found that branched actin 66 assembly occurs predominantly at sites that have stalled between coat expansion and scission . 67 We propose that these branched actin networks rescue stalled CME . 68 69 4 Results 70 Super - resolution imaging reveals asymmetric actin distribution around endocytic sites 71 To investigate the physiological roles and spatiotemporal regulation of actin assembly at 72 CME sites in mammalian cells , we applied genome - editing techniques to generate a human iPSC 73 line ( hereafter referred to as ADA cells ) that co - expresses a TagRFP - T fusion of the mu1 subunit 74 of the AP2 adaptor complex ( AP2M1 ) , a TagGFP2 fusion of dynamin2 ( DNM2 ) , and a HaloTag 75 fusion of the ARPC3 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex as representatives of the CME coat , 76 scission and actin modules respectively 2 , 16 , 17 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary Video 1 , 77 2 ) . Previous studies showed that endogenously tagged AP2M1 , DNM2 and ARPC3 can serve as 78 reliable markers of these CME functional modules that avoid disruption of physiological 79 spatiotemporal organization of the process as might be caused by overexpression of fluorescently 80 labeled proteins 12 , 18 – 21 . We observed dynamic CME events on the basal plasma membrane of the 81 genome - edited cells using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy 82 ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Consistent with previous studies , AP2 is recruited at early CME stages 83 while DNM2 is recruited in two phases 10 , 16 , 20 , 22 . At the early stage of CME , a relatively small 84 amount of DNM2 is recruited to CME sites . Shortly before the end of a CME event , the DNM2 85 recruitment rate increases rapidly with DNM2 levels reaching a peak concomitant with vesicle 86 scission 16 , 20 , 23 ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . This later rapid - recruitment phase represents the 87 assembly of the dynamin helix on the highly curved neck of the budding vesicle after the U to Ω 88 shape transition of the endocytic membrane 20 , 23 – 27 . 89 Super - resolution imaging of fixed human skin melanoma SKMEL cells observed asymmetry 90 of actin arrangement around CME sites 7 , consistent with observations from previous studies 14 , 15 . 91 To analyze how actin networks are organized at CME sites in iPS cells , we first performed two - 92 5 color 3D Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy ( STORM ) imaging 28 on fixed ADA 93 cells , localizing either AF647 phalloidin - labeled actin filaments 29 or HaloTag - fused ARPC3 at 94 CME sites . Due to the dense phalloidin labelling of cortical actin filaments under the plasma 95 membrane , it was often challenging to unambiguously identify the CME - specific actin structures 96 in iPSCs . However , in regions with thinner cortical actin layers , we observed that actin was 97 typically distributed asymmetrically around CME sites ( Fig . 1a , b ) , consistent with what has 98 been observed in different mammalian cell lines by STORM or EM imaging approaches 7 , 15 . 99 Antibody labeling of ARPC3 - Halotag in the ADA cells had the advantage of a less complex 100 staining pattern . Besides being highly concentrated in lamellipodia , ARPC3 was associated with 101 CME sites asymmetrically , like actin ( Fig 1c , d ) . These data suggest an asymmetric Arp2 / 3 - 102 mediated actin network arrangement around CME sites . 103 104 Asymmetric branched actin networks assembled at CME sites persist through scission 105 We next used ADA cells to investigate actin assembly at CME sites in live cells , which has 106 several advantages over studies in fixed cells . During the fixation and subsequent sample 107 preparation , actin structures may not be faithfully preserved . In addition , in fixed cells it is very 108 difficult to identify the stage of the CME , so the timing , geometry and dynamics of actin 109 assembly cannot be related to the endocytic stage . More importantly , only by using live cells is it 110 possible to trace a single CME event from start to finish , and to therefore identify those CME 111 events wherein no detectable actin is ever assembled so key parameters can be compared 112 between events with and without associated actin assembly . 113 By visualizing endogenously tagged AP2M1 to mark the coat and CME initiation , and 114 DNM2 to mark the neck and scission , together with ARPC3 to specifically label Arp2 / 3 - 115 6 nucleated , branched actin filaments ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , we were able to precisely study the 116 spatial and temporal regulation of actin assembly during CME . Three - color labeling and analysis 117 of the displacement between markers for the three modules allowed us to distinguish bona fide 118 asymmetric actin assembly from events that artificially might appear asymmetric because the 119 invaginations were elongated and tilted ( Fig2 a ) . Using TIRF live - cell imaging , we observed 120 ARPC3 - labeled branched actin networks at lamellipodia and a subpopulation of CME sites ( Fig . 121 2b , c ) . Dynamic actin assembly and disassembly occurred at CME sites with different spatio - 122 temporal characteristics , including discrete CME sites , clathrin plaques and at clathrin coat 123 splitting sites , as previously reported 14 ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . In the analysis 124 described below , we focus on the discrete CME events and not the more complex ones ( plaques 125 and splitting events ) . Analysis of these events with 1s / frame temporal resolution revealed that 126 ARPC3 is most robustly recruited during the late stages of CME shortly before scission 12 ( Fig . 127 2c , d ) . Interestingly , we observed clear spatial displacement between ARPC3 ( actin module ) and 128 AP2 ( coat module ) as well as between ARPC3 and DNM2 ( neck ) before vesicle scission ( Fig . 129 2d ) . This observation supports the conclusion that asymmetric branched actin networks provide 130 forces at endocytic sites through the time of scission . Imaging fluorescent beads using the same 131 settings indicates that the displacement is not an artifact caused by misalignment between 132 different imaging channels ( Supplementary Video 3 and Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . 133 To analyze the intrinsic recruitment order and timing for up to three endocytic proteins at 134 CME sites quantitatively and systematically , we developed an automated , high - throughput 135 method that avoids bias because it does not involve manual selection of CME sites ( see Materials 136 and Methods ) . Briefly , AP2 tracks were identified using standard particle - tracking algorithms 30 . 137 Novel filtering methods then extracted DNM2 - positive events marked by one or more DNM2 138 7 burst . The AP2 and DNM2 tracks were decomposed into dynamic features describing the events’ 139 position and brightness . These features were used for clustering via unsupervised machine 140 learning , which enabled grouping of similarly - behaved tracks ( Supplementary Fig . 3a and b ) . 141 DNM2 - positive events were refined by a detection scheme that determined the number of DNM2 142 peaks using various characteristics of a single DNM2 - peak : the peak height , width , and 143 minimum peak - to - peak distance ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . Events with a single DNM2 peak were 144 analyzed as described below . The method detects low signals from endogenously tagged CME 145 proteins , such as the low - level recruitment of DNM2 at the early stages of CME , and accurately 146 reveals the different CME stages ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . 147 Next , the timing of actin network assembly at CME sites was determined using ARPC3 as a 148 branched actin filament marker by analyzing over one thousand CME events . Although actin 149 appearance early in CME has been reported 14 , determining the actin assembly timing is 150 challenging because it is difficult to distinguish newly assembled branched actin at CME sites 151 from the nearby cortical actin filaments or actin filaments attached to other vesicles or 152 organelles . Also , whether actin functions during the early stage of CME has not yet been shown 153 conclusively due to the potential side effects such as changes in membrane tension caused by 154 actin inhibitors . Our endogenous ARPC3 tagging and large - scale computational analysis 155 approach sidesteps these problems . We classified ARPC3 positive CME events into two groups : 156 one group with ARPC3 appearance early in CME , and the other with late appearance in CME 157 ( Fig . 3a ) . We observed that in most of the events ( N = 1 , 385 , 67 . 8 % ) a sharply increasing ARPC3 158 signal appears with similar timing to the rapid - recruitment phase of DNM2 concomitant with the 159 U to Ω membrane shape transition . This timing is consistent with previously proposed role for 160 actin in membrane invagination , as studies showed that actin inhibitors block the U to Ω 161 8 endocytic membrane shape transition 6 , 14 . In some cases ( N = 657 , 32 . 2 % ) we detected ARPC3 162 signals at early CME stages . To test whether random overlap between nearby actin structures and 163 CME sites might be responsible for the apparent early actin recruitment , we generated a 164 randomized data set by pairing ARPC3 images with AP2 and DNM2 images from an unrelated 165 movie ( Fig . 3b ) . In this data set , we detected early “assembly” of actin in the majority of ARPC3 166 positive CME events ( N = 17 , 282 , 72 . 9 % ) , and the intensity profiles of these events resembled the 167 early - actin CME events we observed in the real data set ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Therefore , we conclude that 168 the presence of actin early in CME is very likely due to unrelated nearby actin structures 169 overlapping with CME sites . 170 Our live - cell analysis allowed the timing of branched actin network assembly to be 171 compared to the scission timing , and the spatial offset between the clathrin coat and the 172 associated actin network to be determined . Super - resolution imaging of yeast CME sites 173 suggested that actin and actin nucleators localize symmetrically in a ring around CME sites , and 174 computational modeling suggested that an asymmetric actin arrangement would not provide 175 sufficient force for the membrane invagination during yeast CME 13 . In contrast , in mammalian 176 cells , which require less actin force production during CME , imaging of fixed cells suggested 177 that actin structures associate adjacent to apparent flat clathrin coats . However , these studies 178 proposed that at the later CME stages the actin structures become larger and more symmetric to 179 provide sufficient force for membrane deformation and scission 14 , 15 . Surprisingly , in our live cell 180 studies designed to highlight sites of new actin assembly , we observed off - centered branched 181 actin networks at CME sites throughout even the latest CME stages ( Fig . 2d ) . Furthermore , most 182 ARPC3 - positive CME sites accomplish scission within 30s from the initiation of ARPC3 183 recruitment ( Fig . 3c ) . The actin networks were off center from the coat and neck signals by 184 9 approximately 150nm at the time of vesicle scission ( Fig . 3d ) . Given the temporal separation 185 between channel acquisition and the movement of AP2 spots , the separation between channels 186 can be attributed in part to an imaging artifact . Therefore , when we measured the average 187 movement of AP2 spots leading up to scission as a control , we found that over 95 % of the events 188 had AP2 - ARPC3 separations that exceed the frame - to - frame motility of AP2 ( Supplementary 189 Fig 4 ) . Also , the uncertainties measured by a standard deviation , when measuring the fitted 190 position of AP2 , range up to 40 nm . Therefore , we include the AP2 - DNM2 separation as a basis 191 for comparison to the AP2 - ARPC3 and DNM2 - ARPC3 separations ( Fig 3d ) . These results 192 further support our conclusion that branched actin networks assemble asymmetrically at CME 193 sites through the time of scission ( Fig 2d ) . This observation is consistent with the observation 194 that ring - shaped actin structures at clathrin coats were rarely observed in the high - resolution , 195 live - cell imaging in a previous study 31 . In total , these live - cell data suggest that in mammalian 196 cells , asymmetric actin network assembly can provide enough force to assist membrane 197 deformation and scission during the late stages of CME . 198 199 Asymmetric branched actin networks facilitate CME at stalled sites 200 To gain additional insights into the function of this asymmetric actin network assembly , we 201 quantitatively compared kinetics of CME events with or without ARPC3 recruitment . We 202 observed that about 30 % of CME events are completed in the absence of detectable actin 203 assembly , which is consistent with the hypothesis that in mammalian cells actin assembly is 204 required for CME only under relatively high membrane tension , which can vary regionally 205 within cells 6 , 7 , 9 . Consistent with the possibility that increased membrane tension stalls membrane 206 deformation during CME 4 , 8 , 9 , 32 – 34 , CME lifetimes were markedly longer for ARPC3 positive 207 10 events compared to the ARPC3 negative events ( Fig . 4a ) . In addition , when the AP2M1 intensity 208 vs time profiles were compared between ARPC3 positive and negative CME sites , a plateau , 209 which lasts for approximately 10 seconds , was observed for the ARPC3 positive events ( Fig . 4b ) . 210 Based on these observations and previous experimental and computational modeling data 4 , 6 , 7 , we 211 propose that this plateau in branched actin - positive CME events represents stalled membrane 212 bending due to an unfavorable local membrane environment , such as higher membrane 213 tension 4 , 32 , 33 . 214 We next tested the hypothesis that the asymmetric actin network might affect the lateral 215 movements of endocytic coats on the plasma membrane . Interestingly , the ARPC3 positive CME 216 sites showed significantly slower , but more directional lateral movement before the scission 217 compared to the ARPC3 negative CME sites ( Fig . 4c , d ) . After scission both ARPC3 positive 218 and negative vesicles showed fast , apparently random movements ( Fig . 4c , d ) . These data 219 suggest that the asymmetric actin can stabilize the forming endocytic coat while pushing it in the 220 plane of the plasma membrane with a lateral directional force . 221 222 N - WASP is recruited asymmetrically to the stalled CME sites 223 To further explore how the asymmetrical assembly of actin networks at CME sites is 224 regulated , we endogenously tagged N - WASP , an actin nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) that 225 plays roles in CME , in AP2M1 - tagRFP - T / DNM2 - tagGFP2 genome - edited iPSCs ( hereafter 226 referred to as ADW cells , Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Quantitative imaging of budding 227 yeasts demonstrated that initiation of productive actin assembly at CME sites requires the 228 accumulation of yeast WASP or WIP to a certain amount 35 . In our genome - edited iPS cells , we 229 observed that N - WASP is recruited asymmetrically to CME sites mostly at the late stage of CME 230 11 ( Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Fig . 5b , c ) . Longer lifetimes and a plateau in the AP2 intensity vs 231 time plot were observed specifically in the N - WASP positive CME events ( Fig . 5d , e ) , similar to 232 the ARPC3 positive events ( Fig 4 a , b ) . These data indicate that asymmetric NPF recruitment 233 underlies the asymmetric architecture of branched actin networks at CME sites . 234 235 Discussion 236 Using large - scale , comprehensive analysis of thousands of CME sites in unperturbed live 237 cells , our study demonstrates that in mammalian cells coat assembly dynamics predict which 238 sites will assemble actin , and show that at apparently stalled sites , actin assembles 239 asymmetrically to facilitate successful vesicle formation . 240 Based on the data presented here , we propose an updated model for actin assembly at 241 mammalian CME sites in which , beyond global tension - dependent changes in requirement for 242 actin assembly , highly localized differences give rise to heterogeneity even within the same 243 patch of plasma membrane in the same cell ( Fig . 6 ) : ( 1 ) Where the local membrane tension is 244 lower ( Fig . 6 upper scenario ) , the membrane can undergo flat - U - Ω shape transitions without 245 actin assembly in a relatively short time . When the coat grows large enough to form a Ω - shaped 246 bud , sufficient dynamin can be recruited to perform scission , and there is little delay between 247 coat expansion and scission ; ( 2 ) Where the local conditions are not favorable , presumably under 248 high membrane tension and possibly other impediments , the coat protein - membrane interaction 249 does not generate sufficient force to curve the membrane ( Fig . 6 lower scenario ) . Here , extra 250 force generation from actin assembly is required 4 , 6 . Asymmetric N - WASP recruitment activates 251 actin nucleation mostly at one side of the clathrin coat , generating an asymmetric force that pulls 252 the membrane into the cell with a similar action to a bottle cap opener . We speculate that this 253 12 asymmetrical force contributes to asymmetric membrane deformation at endocytic sites observed 254 by high - speed atomic force microscopy 36 and may act with dynamin 37 to twist the clathrin pit to 255 promote scission at the neck . CME events with associated actin assembly have longer lifetimes , 256 likely due to a delay between coat expansion and scission , requiring adaptive recruitment of actin 257 regulators followed by actin network assembly and membrane remodeling . This result reinforces 258 the conclusion from previous studies 6 – 9 that increased membrane tension enhances the 259 requirement for actin assembly during CME , but also establishes that site - to - site heterogeneity in 260 actin dependence and involvement can be observed without manipulating membrane tension . 261 Future computational modeling studies of how asymmetric actin network assembly provides 262 forces for vesicle formation and membrane remodeling will deepen our understanding of actin ' s 263 functions in a host of actin - mediated processes . 264 Our model provides further insights into the basis for inconsistent effects of actin drugs on 265 CME 6 , 14 , 18 , 38 – 43 . Actin plays crucial roles in membrane shaping , cell adhesion , and membrane 266 tension . Global disruption of actin dynamics is expected to dramatically change membrane 267 tension and the available pool of actin and associated proteins and therefore to have both direct 268 and indirect effects on CME . Here , we focused on in - depth analysis of the unperturbed process 269 and detected preference for actin assembly at stalled CME events . 270 The results presented here may prove relevant to the constant coat area vs constant coat 271 curvature debate for how the clathrin coat assembles and develops curvature 32 , 44 – 48 . In the 272 constant area model , flat clathrin coats grow close to their final size before curvature develops as 273 a vesicle forms . In the constant curvature model , clathrin coats grow with a fixed curvature . Our 274 observations suggest that coat expansion and curvature generation may be regulated via distinct 275 mechanisms , with different actin requirements . At actin - positive CME sites , actin assembles 276 13 primarily at the late stage of CME when coat assembly is mostly complete ( Fig . 3 and 277 Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . If the constant curvature model holds , actin should only be associated 278 with clathrin coats with highly curved dome and spherical shapes ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . 279 However , actin associated with flat or shallow clathrin coats has been observed in multiple 280 studies 7 , 15 , which supports the constant area model at actin - positive CME sites ( Supplementary 281 Fig . 6c ) . On the other hand , mathematical modeling predicts that at actin - negative CME sites , 282 where coat and other curvature - promoting proteins provide sufficient force to bend the 283 membrane 23 , the membrane is smoothly and continuously shaped by these proteins into a budded 284 morphology as the coat area increases 4 , which follows the constant curvature model . Perhaps the 285 constant area model applies primarily for actin - negative sites and the constant area model applies 286 primarily for actin - positive sites , which we have shown here are mostly stalled CME sites . We 287 suggest that in future studies the constant coat area and constant coat curvature models be tested 288 at individual CME events to test the possibility that both mechanisms operate in the same cell . 289 14 Acknowledgments : MJ was funded by American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship 290 ( 18POST34000029 ) .

Cultures were passaged with Gentle Cell 315 Dissociation reagent ( StemCell Technologies , Cat # : 100 - 0485 ) twice every week . 316 317 Genome - editing 318 The AP2M1 gene was edited in WTC10 hiPSCs as previously described using TALENs 319 targeting exon 7 of the AP2M1 gene 49 . Both alleles of AP2M1 were tagged with tagRFP - T . The 320 Cas9 - crRNAtracrRNA complex electroporation method was used sequentially to edit DNM2 and 321 ARPC3 gene in AP2M1 - tagRFP - T genome - edited hiPSCs , as previously described 12 , 18 . The 322 same method was used to edit the WASL gene in AP2M1 - tagRFP - T / DNM2 - tagGFP2 genome 323 edited hiPSCs . S . pyogenes NLS - Cas9 was purified in the University of California Berkeley QB3 324 MacroLab . TracrRNA and crRNA that target CCTGCTCGACTAGGCCTCGA ( DNM2 ) , 325 CCTGGACAGTGAAGGGAGCC ( ARPC3 ) and AGCTCATGGTTTCGCCGGCG ( WASL ) , 326 were purchased from IDT . Gibson assembly ( New England Biolabs ) was used to construct donor 327 plasmids containing DNM2 5’ homology - ggtaccagtggcggaagc - tagGFP2 - DNM2 3’ homology , 328 ARPC3 5’ homology - ggatccggtaccagcgatccaccggtcgccacc - HaloTag - ARPC3 3’ homology , and 329 WASL 5’ homology - HaloTag - agcgatccaccggtcgccaccggatcc - WASL 3’ homology sequences , 330 respectively . Three days after electroporation ( Lonza , Cat # : VPH - 5012 ) of the Cas9 - crRNA - 331 tracrRNA complex and donor plasmid , the tagGFP2 or HaloTag positive cells were single cell 332 16 sorted using a BD Bioscience Influx sorter ( BD Bioscience ) into Matrigel - coated 96 - well plates . 333 Clones were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the genomic DNA locus around the 334 insertion site . Both alleles of DNM2 and ARPC3 were tagged with tagGFP2 and HaloTag , 335 respectively , and one allele of WASL was tagged with HaloTag in the hiPSC lines used in this 336 study . 337 338 Western blotting 339 Cells were dissociated from the well using Gentle Cell Dissociation reagent ( StemCell 340 Technologies , Cat # : 100 - 0485 ) . Total proteins were extracted by adding 1ml of cold 10 % TCA 341 to the cell pellets , incubated on ice for 30min , and spun down by centrifuging at 4 °C , 12000rpm 342 for 10min . Protein pellets were dissolved in loading buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM 343 NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 5 % BME , 5mM DTT and protease inhibitor ) and loaded onto an 344 acrylamide gel for SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting . 345 Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies targeting Tag ( CGY ) FP ( 1 : 2000 346 dilution in 1 % milk , Evrogen , Cat # : AB121 ) , HaloTag ( 1 : 1000 dilution in 0 . 5 % milk , Promega , 347 Cat # : G9211 ) , GAPDH ( 1 : 100 , 000 dilution in 0 . 5 % milk , Proteintech , Cat # : 10494 - 1 - AP ) , 348 respectively , and subsequently incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1hr with secondary 349 antibodies . 350 351 TIRF live - cell imaging 352 Two days before imaging , hiPSCs were seeded onto Matrigel - coated 4 - well chambered cover 353 glasses ( Cellvis ) . Halotag was labeled by JF635 - HaloTag ligand 50 . Cells were incubated in 354 StemFlex medium with 100 mM JF635 - HaloTag for 45min and the unbound ligands were 355 17 washed away by three washes with 5 min incubation in prewarmed StemFlex medium . Cells 356 were imaged on a Nikon Ti - 2 inverted microscope fitted with TIRF optics and a sCMOS camera 357 ( Hamamatsu ) . Cells were maintained at 37 °C with a stage top incubator ( OKO Lab ) in 358 StemFlex medium with 10mM HEPES . Images were acquired with Nikon Elements . Channels 359 were acquired sequentially at a 1 sec interval and 300ms exposure time over 4 minutes . 360 361 TIRF image processing 362 Four generalized processing steps were applied identify of clathrin - coated pits with single 363 DNM2 peaks : track feature abstraction , feature dimensionality reduction , event clustering , and 364 DNM2 - peak detection . First , tracks that are defined by fitted positions and intensities for single 365 events were generated using cmeAnalysis 30 . Then , AP2 and DNM2 tracks were decomposed into 366 dynamic features describing the dynamics of the events’ position and brightness . The mapping of 367 each track to discrete features was done to generalize the dynamics of tracked events into a set of 368 interpretable coordinates . These features were clustered after feature scaling to normal 369 distributions , dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis , and Gaussian mixture 370 modeling . DNM2 - positive events represented a distinct cluster of tracks that had detectable 371 DNM2 throughout the event , were long lived , and were below the threshold of motility expected 372 for transient , non - CME - derived clathrin - coated vesicle “visitors” at the TIRF field . Single 373 DNM2 - peak events were found by searching over a range of values set for the minimum DNM2 374 peak height , width , and peak - to - peak temporal distance . After finding single - peaked events in a 375 fixed peak - parameter combination , the lifetime distribution of single peak events’ lifetimes were 376 fit to the expected underlying distribution , a Rayleigh distribution 51 , where the best - fitting 377 parameter combination was chosen to identify single - peaked events . Single DNM2 - peaked 378 18 events were kept as CME sites for the remainder of the analysis . All code associated with this 379 analysis , generating Figures 3 - 5 , and a detailed step - by - step protocol , are available at 380 https : / / github . com / DrubinBarnes / Jin _ Shirazinejad _ et _ al _ branched _ actin _ manuscript . 381 382 Two - color 3D STORM imaging 383 12 mm round coverslips were sonicated in distilled water and sterilized for 20 min in 70 % 384 ethanol , air - dried and coated with Matrigel in 24 - well plates . Cells were seeded onto Matrigel - 385 coated coverslips two days before fixation . For clathrin and actin two - color imaging , cells were 386 fixed first for 1 min in 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde ( GA ) solution containing 0 . 25 % ( v / v ) Triton in 387 cytoskeleton buffer ( CB : 10mM MES , 150mM NaCl , 5mM EGTA , 5mM Glucose , 5mM MgCl 2 , 388 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , pH 6 . 1 ) and then immediately fixed for 20 min in 2 % ( v / v ) GA solution in CB . 389 Both solutions were prepared fresh from a 10 % GA stock ( Electron Microscopy Science , cat 390 # 16120 ) . After fixation , samples were incubated twice for 5 min in freshly prepared 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) 391 NaBH4 in PBS . For clathrin and ARPC3 - HaloTag imaging , cells were fixed for 20 min in 4 % 392 ( v / v ) PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Cat # : 15710 ) in CB . Subsequently , both types of 393 samples were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS . Samples were then blocked for 20 min in 394 blocking buffer [ 3 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) Saponin in PBS ] . Clathrin light chain 395 ( Invitrogen , Cat # : MA5 - 11860 , 1 : 200 dilution ) and Halotag ( Promega , Cat # : G9281 , 1 : 200 396 dilution ) antibodies were used in blocking solution . Primary antibody immunostaining was 397 performed overnight at 4°C . On the next day , samples were washed three times in washing 398 buffer ( 0 . 1x blocking buffer in PBS ) for 10 min . Samples were incubated with secondary 399 antibody in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and were washed three 400 times for 10 min in washing buffer , and then three times for 10 min in PBS . Homemade mouse 401 19 secondary antibody - CF680 ( 1 : 50 ) was used to stain clathrin and actin samples . Commercial 402 mouse secondary antibody - AF647 ( ThermoFisher , cat # A32787 ; 1 : 400 ) and homemade rabbit 403 secondary antibody - CF680 ( 1 : 50 ) were used to stain the clathrin and ARPC3 - HaloTag . Clathrin 404 and actin samples were then stained with 0 . 5µM Phalloidin - AF647 ( Fisher Scientific , Cat # : 405 A22287 ) in PBS and kept at room temperature in the dark for 2 hours . Samples were washed 406 three times with PBS before STORM imaging . 407 408 STORM imaging was performed as previously described on a homebuilt STORM setup 7 , 52 . 409 Samples labeled by AF647 and CF680 were excited by an 647nm laser . The emission of both 410 AF647 and CF680 was then split into two light paths as two channels using a dichroic mirror 411 ( Chroma , cat # T685lpxr ) , and each channel was projected onto one - half of an EMCCD camera 412 ( Andor iXon Ultra 897 ) . Color assignment of each localization was based on its intensity in the 413 two channels . A cylindrical lens was inserted into the transmitted channel to acquire 3D 414 localization 28 . 3D position of each localization was determined from the ellipticity of each point 415 spread function . 416 417 20 418 Fig . 1 : Two - color , 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) shows that 419 actin structures are off - centered with respect to clathrin coats . a , b , Two - color 3D STORM 420 image of bottom membrane of ADA cells immunolabeled with clathrin light chain antibody 421 ( clathrin , CF - 680 , magenta ) and phalloidin ( actin , AF647 , rainbow ) . c , d , Two color 3D STORM 422 21 image of the bottom membrane of ADA cells immunolabeled with clathrin light chain antibody 423 ( clathrin , AF647 , magenta ) and HaloTag antibody ( ARPC3 - HaloTag , CF - 680 , rainbow ) .
