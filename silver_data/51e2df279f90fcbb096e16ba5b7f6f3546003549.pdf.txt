Because integrins are mechanotransducers that regulate cell fate , we asked whether tissue stiffness could promote malignant behavior by modulating integrins . We found that tumors are rigid because they have a stiff stroma and elevated Rho - dependent cytoskeletal tension that drives focal adhesions , disrupts adherens junctions , perturbs tissue polarity , enhances growth , and hinders lumen formation . Matrix stiffness perturbs epithelial morphogenesis by clustering integrins to enhance ERK activation and increase ROCK - gener - ated contractility and focal adhesions . Contractile , EGF - transformed epithelia with elevated ERK and Rho activity could be phenotypically reverted to tissues lacking focal adhesions if Rho - generated contractility or ERK activity was decreased . Thus , ERK and Rho constitute part of an integrated mechanoregulatory circuit linking matrix stiffness to cytoskeletal tension through integrins to regulate tissue phenotype . Introduction Tumors are frequently detected through physical palpation as a rigid mass residing within a compliant tissue . Indeed , screen - ing for tumors by monitoring for tissue stiffness is widespread , and strategies to image differences in tissue compliance have been exploited for cancer screening ( Khaled et al . , 2004 ) . Al - though patients with fibrotic “stiff” lesions have a poor progno - sis ( Colpaert et al . , 2001 ) , the relationship between tissue rigid - ity and tumor behavior at the molecular level is unclear . Tumor rigidity likely reflects an elevation in interstitial tissue pressure and solid stress due to a perturbed vasculature and tumor expansion ( Padera et al . , 2004 ) , an increase in the elastic modulus of transformed cells mediated by an altered cytoar - chitecture ( Beil et al . , 2003 ) , and matrix stiffening linked to fi - brosis ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ) . Tumor rigidity could influ - ence treatment efficacy ( Netti et al . , 2000 ) and may enhance tumor metastasis ( Akiri et al . , 2003 ) . Whether tissue stiffness could actively promote malignant transformation—and how it could do so—have yet to be assessed . S I G N I F I C A N C E By examining the significance of the relationship between tissue rigidity and tumor behavior at the molecular level , we showed that tissue rigidity reflects matrix stiffening and elevated Rho GTPase - dependent cytoskeletal tension . We found that matrix stiffness ( exogenous force ) and cytoskeletal tension ( endogenous force ) are functionally linked through ERK and ROCK and that they coop - erate to modulate tissue behavior by regulating FA formation and GF signaling . Matrix stiffness influences tissue growth and morpho - genesis by modulating cell contractility , and tensional homeostasis appears to be necessary for normal tissue behavior . These findings provide a fresh perspective for appreciating the role of the tissue microenvironment in differentiation and tumorigenesis , and for identifying tumor therapies .

Matrix compliance influences cell contractility ( cytoskeletal tension ) , Rho activity , and ERK - dependent growth ( Wang et al . , 1998 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) , and cytoskeletal tension promotes growth ( Roovers and Assoian , 2003 ) and focal adhesion ( FA ) assembly ( Burridge and Wennerberg , 2004 ) . This suggests that cell behavior , matrix stiffness , Rho , and cell contractility are functionally linked . Consistently , Rho - dependent cytoskeletal tension is implicated in branching morphogenesis ( Moore et al . , 2002 ) , and ROCK disrupts adherens junctions ( AJs ) ( Sahai and Marshall , 2002 ) . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) culture studies emphasize the importance of matrix compliance for normal tis - sue differentiation ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ) and imply that matrix stiffness regulates cell fate by modulating growth factor ( GF ) signaling and Rho GTPase function ( O’Brien et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 1998 ) .

Therefore , tissue stiff - ening could drive transformation by increasing Rho - generated cytoskeletal tension . Integrins are transmembrane ECM receptors that can func - tion as mechanotransducers ( Bershadsky et al . , 2003 ) , inte - grins regulate Rho - and GF - ERK - dependent growth ( Lee and Juliano , 2004 ) , and ERK influences ROCK and myosin activity ( Huang et al . , 2004 ; Vial et al . , 2003 ) . Exogenous force can activate integrins ( Tzima et al . , 2001 ) , drive adhesion assembly ( Galbraith et al . , 2002 ) , and influence FA formation ( Riveline et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , Rho - generated cytoskeletal tension pro - motes FA assembly and drives ERK - dependent growth ( Chrza - nowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) , and cytoskeletal rein - 242 CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 forcement of integrins is required for FAK pY397 phosphorylation ( Shi and Boettiger , 2003 ) . Furthermore , integrin expression is higher in epithelia on rigid two - dimensional ( 2D ) substrata than on a compliant 3D matrix ( Delcommenne and Streuli , 1995 ) , and matrix rigidity increases integrin expression ( Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , tissue stiffness could drive expression of a malig - nant phenotype through force - dependent regulation of integrin expression , activity , or adhesions . Indeed , integrin levels and signaling are altered in “stiff” tumors ( Guo and Giancotti , 2004 ) , and integrins and Rho GTPases can modify the tumorigenic behavior of a tissue ( Liu et al . , 2004 ; White et al . , 2004 ) . Here , we asked if and how tissue stiffening could drive malignant behavior of a tissue through Rho - dependent integrin modu - lation . A R T I C L E Figure 2 .

Results Matrix rigidity regulates growth , morphogenesis , and integrin adhesions The mammary gland develops within a fat pad and represents one of the more compliant tissues in the body ( Figure 1A ) . We reasoned that mammary differentiation and tissue homeostasis would be most favored by a soft tissue microenvironment and that breast desmoplasia and tissue stiffening that accompany mammary tumor development might therefore actively promote malignant behavior of the gland ( Azar et al . , 2001 ) . To test this possibility , an electro - mechanical indentor was used to con - duct unconfined compression analysis of normal and ma - lignant breast tissues from MMTV - Her2 / neu , Myc , and Ras transgenic mice . Normal mammary tissue was found to be ex - tremely soft , whereas the stromal matrix adjacent to the trans - CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 243 formed cells and the tumor itself was quite stiff ( Figure 1C ) . Reconstituted ECMs , such as 1 mg / ml collagen ( COL ) gels and basement membrane ( BM ) gels , that support normal mammary tissue morphogenesis in culture were also very soft , with elastic moduli virtually identical to normal mammary tissue . COL gels used to study branching morphogenesis had an intermediate stiffness , and gels and substrata that do not support normal tis - sue morphogenesis such as polystyrene ( tissue culture plastic ) and soda lime glass were exceedingly rigid ( Callister , 2000 ) . To explore the role of matrix stiffness in mammary tissue be - havior , BM / COL I gels were produced with constant BM ( to permit laminin [ LN ] - dependent acini morphogenesis ) , and the COL levels were varied to recapitulate the range of stiffness between normal mammary gland and tumors . When BM / COL compliance was matched to that of a normal mammary stroma ( compare 167 to 170 Pa ) , nonmalignant MCF10A ( Figures 1A A R T I C L E Figure 3 .

Regardless of cell or matrix type , cells in - teracting with a soft matrix assemble focal com - plexes and express high amounts of total and active Src family kinase , whereas on a stiff mat - rix cells spread and assemble stress fibers , acti - vate more ERK in response to growth factors , and form FAs with FAK pY397 and vinculin . Experiments reported for D – F and H are mean ± SEM of three experiments . and 1B ) and HMT3522 S - 1 MECs ( data not shown ) formed small growth - arrested and polarized acini with AJs and a central lumen ( compare tissue acinus to acini formed in a 1 mg / ml floating BM / COL gel ) . Yet , even a small increase in mat - rix stiffness ( 170 – 1200 Pa ) significantly increased EGF - depen - dent growth ( Figure 1B ) , compromised tissue organization , in - hibited lumen formation , and destabilized AJs ( indicated by diffuse β - catenin [ Figure 1A ] and triton - extractable and nonco - localized β - catenin and E - cadherin [ data not shown ] ) . Interest - ingly , disruption of basal polarity , visualized by diffuse β 4 inte - grin localization , required a substantial increase in matrix rigidity ( compare 170 to 1200 Pa ; Figure 1A ) . Because integrins are mechanotransducers that relay ECM cues , the effect of matrix stiffness on integrin function was ana - lyzed by assessing colocalization of components involved in 244 CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 mechanosignaling with ( α 3 ) β 1 integrin . MECs interacting in 3D with a soft ( 175 Pa ) and stiff ( 1200 Pa ) BM , and in 2D with a stiff BM ( 1 – 2 GPa ) , formed ( α 3 ) β 1 integrin adhesions , indicated by FAK pY861 ( Figure 1D ) and talin ( data not shown ) that coloca - lized with β 1 integrin . However , MECs could only phosphory - late FAK pY397 and recruit vinculin to their ( α 3 ) β 1 integrin adhe - sions when interacting in 2D or 3D with a rigid BM ( Figure 1D ) . These data indicate that a stiff matrix , whether in 2D or 3D , is incompatible with normal tissue morphogenesis and that mat - rix stiffness may modulate integrin adhesions . Because a sim - ilar correlation between tissue stiffness and FAK pY397 and vin - culin expression in normal and malignant tissues in vivo was also observed ( Figure 1E ) , this suggests that tissue stiffness could contribute to aberrant epithelial tissue behavior by influ - encing integrin adhesions .

G : Model of force - dependent FA assembly . Matrix stiffness modulates integrin adhesions to regulate MEC growth and behavior COL gels are inherently variable , and elevating matrix stiffness by increasing COL concentration could confound data inter - pretation through altered integrin occupancy . To address this , we used BM - crosslinked polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels ( BM gel ) with calibrated elastic moduli of 150 , 400 , 675 , 1050 , and R 5000 Pa . Similar to MECs inside a 3D BM ( 3D BM ; Weaver et al . , 2002 ) or on top of a thick BM overlaid with BM ( 3D over BM ; Debnath et al . , 2003 ) , by 16 – 20 days MECs on a compliant PA BM gel overlaid with BM ( 3D BM gel ) formed growth - arrested acini with cell - cell localized β - catenin , basally polar - ized β 4 integrin , and apical - lateral cortical actin and assembled an endogenous LN - 5 BM ( Figure 2C ) . Similar to results with 3D COL gels , increasing matrix rigidity ( from 150 to 400 to 675 to 1050 ) progressively increased EGF - dependent ERK activation CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 245 and colony size ( Figures 2B and 2I ) , hindered lumen formation , destabilized AJs , and perturbed tissue polarity ( absence of β - catenin / E - cadherin colocalization and triton - extractable β - catenin [ Figure 2C and inset ] , disrupted localization of β 4 in - tegrin and LN - 5 , and progressive filling of the spheroid lumens ; Figure 2C ) . Intriguingly , actin stress fibers were not observed in any of these cultures until matrix rigidity increased to 5000 Pa , toward that measured in tumors ( z 4049 Pa ) and in MECs on highly rigid 2D substrata ( 1 – 2 GPa ; Figures 1 and 2D , phalloidin ) . Because MEC colonies initiate clonally , the effect of matrix compliance on MEC behavior and integrin adhesions in iso - lated cells was examined . Within 12 hr of plating , MECs spread significantly more on stiff versus soft BM gels ( Figure 2A ) . Yet , MECs adhered rapidly , activated β 1 integrin ( Figure 2H ) , and recruited talin and FAK pY861 to β 1 integrin adhesions ( Figures 2D – 2F ) equally on soft and stiff BM gels , indicating that MECs A R T I C L E Figure 5 .

In - deed , MECs on soft BM gels had higher levels of total and activated Lyn pY507 and Lck pY505 kinases than MECs on stiff gels ( Figure 2G ) , and MECs grew and survived in 3D quite well , consistent with integrin activation , FAK pY861 , and adhesion as - sembly ( Arias - Salgado et al . , 2003 ) . Because cells suspended in the absence of ECM also lacked FAK pY861 and FAK pY397 , but could phosphorylate FAK pY861 upon antibody - induced or polymerized ligand - mediated integrin clustering ( Supplemental Data ; Shi and Boettiger , 2003 ) , this suggests that MECs on soft BM gels likely assemble focal complexes as opposed to FAs . Indeed , only MECs interacting with a stiff BM gel , or a stiff tissue stroma , could phosphorylate FAK pY397 and recruit vin - culin to ( α 3 ) β 1 integrin adhesions ( Figures 1D , 1E , and 2D – 2F ) , suggesting that matrix stiffness is necessary for FA assembly or stabilization . Consistently , MECs on stiff gels activated and sustained more ERK and grew better in response to EGF ( Fig - ure 2I ) , comparable to fibroblasts on a rigid fibronectin ( FN ) substrate that sustain ERK activity only when FAs are present ( Roovers and Assoian , 2003 ) . Matrix rigidity regulates cell behavior by inducing FAs To understand how ECM rigidity could regulate integrin adhe - sions , the effect of matrix compliance on α 5 β 1 integrin - FN ad - hesions and fibroblast behavior was also assessed . Identical to MECs on BM gels , fibroblasts on soft and stiff FN - cross - linked PA gels ( FN gel ) adhered and recruited talin and FAK pY861 comparably at α 5 β 1 integrin adhesions ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , only fibroblasts interacting with a stiff FN gel assem - bled actin stress fibers , phosphorylated FAK pY397 , and re - cruited vinculin to α 5 β 1 integrin adhesions ( Figures 3B – 3D ) . Fi - broblasts also spread significantly better on stiff versus soft FN gels ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , fibroblasts adhered equally to soft and stiff FN gels ( Figure 3E ) , and when adhesion strength was measured using a spinning disc apparatus ( Shi and Boet - tiger , 2003 ) fibroblasts detached with virtually the same force per cm 2 from soft and stiff FN gels ( Figure 3F ) , suggesting that they adhere with the same strength regardless of matrix com - pliance . Consistently , ectopic expression of neither wild - type α 5 integrin ( Yeung et al . , 2005 ) , nor wild - type β 1 integrin ( Figure 3G ) , nor even a constitutively active G429N β 1 integrin glycan wedge mutant ( Luo et al . , 2004 ) could increase FAK pY397 or drive fibroblast spreading on a soft FN gel . Instead , α 5 β 1 inte - grin adhesions were much larger in fibroblasts spread on stiff FN gels ( Figure 3H ) , implying that cells on compliant gels form focal complexes and that a stiff matrix alters cell behavior by promoting FAs ( Figure 3I ) .

CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 247 matrix stiffness modulates cell contractility ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) , and Rho - induced cytoskeletal tension clusters integrins ( Chr - zanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) . Consistently , traction force microscopy ( TFM ) showed that contractility ( integral of the force magnitudes ) , cell spreading ( cell area ) , and FAK pY397 ( data not shown ) positively correlate with matrix rigidity ( Fig - ures 4A and 4B ) , confirming that force is likely required for FA assembly and / or stabilization . To directly test this prediction , fibroblasts on soft FN gels were subjected to an exogenous shear force , and a correlation between force magnitude and the timing of the appearance of FAs and cell spreading was assessed . A 5 min shear force of 100 – 140 dynes was sufficient to increase the size of α 5 β 1 integrin adhesions and induce FAK pY397 and cell spreading ( Figures 4C – 4F ) . Yet , integrin clus - tering preceded rather than followed the appearance of FAK pY397 and cell spreading ( lag time 20 – 30 min ; Figures 4C – 4F ) , implying that force - dependent integrin aggregation ( an - isotropy ) promotes FA assembly ( Nicolas et al . , 2004 ) . Integrin clustering enhances ERK activation and induces cell tension to perturb tissue behavior Because force - dependent integrin aggregation preceded FA assembly , β 1 integrin mutants with increased transmembrane molecular associations were generated to test whether integrin anisotropy could drive FA formation . Hydrophobic valine 737 was replaced with hydrophilic asparagine ( V737N ) , or neutral glycine 744 was replaced with asparagine ( G744N ) , to promote integrin self - association through enhanced hydrogen bonding in the transmembrane domain ( Li et al . , 2003 ) , and cells ex - pressing the mutant integrins were assayed for their behavior on compliant gels . Untagged ( data not shown ) and EGFP - tagged wild - type and mutant V737N ( Figure 5B ) and G744N ( data not shown ) β 1 integrin expressed equally well in MECs and fibroblasts ( data not shown ) , colocalized with integrins at sites of matrix adhesion ( Figure 5B ) , adhered similarly ( data not shown ) , and had comparable levels of cell surface β 1 and β 4 integrin ( data not shown ) and ligand bound integrin ( Supple - mental Data ) . Enhancing integrin associations did not induce integrin clustering when cells were plated on a rigid matrix ( e . g . , tissue culture plastic ; Luo et al . , 2005 ) ; however , on soft gels ( analogous to cells in suspension with no tension ; Li et al . , 2003 ) , V737N β 1 integrin - expressing cells spread significantly more ( Figures 5D and 5E ) , formed larger integrin adhesions ( Figures 5C and 5D ) with more FAK pY397 ( Figure 5G ) , and acti - vated more ERK in response to GF stimulation ( Figure 5H ) . V737N β 1 integrin - expressing cells exerted greater force ( Fig - ure 5F ) , and V737N β 1 integrin - expressing MECs exhibited ab - errant morphogenetic behavior , in response to a compliant ma - trix ( V737N β 1 integrin MECs formed larger , nonpolarized colonies lacking AJs and assembled spheroids lacking a com - pletely cleared lumens ; Figures 5G and 5I ) , but the abnormal A R T I C L E phenotype could be phenotypically reverted if ERK activity was repressed ( Figures 5G and 5I ) . These data extend previous work highlighting the existence of a functional link between cy - toskeletal tension - regulated FA assembly and ERK - dependent growth to show that matrix compliance ( exogenous force ) can influence tissue phenotype by regulating integrin aggregation to enhance GF - dependent ERK activation , induce cell tension ( endogenous force ) , and drive or stabilize FA assembly . Matrix stiffness induces integrin clustering to enhance GF - dependent ERK activation and Rho - generated force , thereby modifying tissue growth and morphology Integrins regulate Rho GTPases , cells employ myosins for con - tractility , and myosin activity is regulated by Rho ( Burridge and Wennerberg , 2004 ) . We found that matrix rigidity increases Rho activity ( Figure 6B ) , and inhibiting ROCK using Y - 27632 , or my - osins using ML - 7 or Blebbistatin ( data not shown ) , significantly reduces cell - generated force ( Figure 6A ) . Moreover , expressing a constitutively active V14Rho elevates cell - generated force ( Figure 6C ) , increases the number and size of FAs ( Figure 6E ) , and significantly increases cell spreading on a soft gel ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . V14Rho also increases the size of EGF - dependent mammary colonies in BM ( Figure 6G ) , increases FAs ( see vin - culin and FAK pY397 ; Figure 6F ) , and compromises MEC mor - phogenesis ( diffuse β - catenin and absence of cleared lumens ; Figure 6F ) . Nevertheless , the aberrant V14Rho tissue pheno - type could be phenotypically normalized by inhibiting EGF - dependent ERK activation ( using the U0126 MEK inhibitor ) or by inhibiting cell contractility ( using a myosin II inhibitor , Bleb - bistatin ) , and ERK inhibition decreased cytoskeletal tension ( endogenous force ) and reduced ROCK levels ( Figures 6H and 6I ; see also Supplemental Data ) . This indicates that matrix compliance ( exogenous force ) - dependent integrin clustering regulates GF - dependent ERK activation to control cell growth and tissue behavior by influencing Rho - generated cytoskeletal tension and FA formation . GF signaling , Rho - dependent tension , FAs , and the malignant phenotype Similar to primary normal and malignant MECs , nonmalignant EGF - dependent S - 1 MECs from the HMT3522 tumor pro - gression series assemble acini in BM , whereas their EGFR - transformed T4 - 2 progeny form continuously growing , disorga - nized , and invasive colonies ( Figure 7F , compare S - 1 to T4 - 2 ) . Yet , these T4 - 2s , which form abundant FAs ( Figure 7B ) and have elevated EGF - dependent ERK activity , can be phenotypi - cally reverted to form polarized and growth - arrested acini if β 1 integrin , EGFR , or ERK activity is inhibited ( Wang et al . , 1998 ) . Consistent with a model in which an ECM compliance ( exoge - nous force ) - integrin - GF - ERK - Rho signaling circuit links cy - toskeletal tension to cell growth and tissue phenotype , T4 - 2s spread more ( Figure 7E ) and exert significantly higher force on a soft BM gel , as compared to S - 1s ( Figures 7C and 7D ) . T4 - 2s also have higher Rho activity ( Figure 7A ) , and inhibiting Rho or myosin activity by expressing a dominant - negative N19Rho ( Figure 7B ; green inset ) , or by treatment with Y - 27632 or Bleb - bistatin , significantly represses T4 - 2 contractility and cell spreading ( compare T4 - 2s to N19Rho , Y - 27632 , and Blebbi - statin T4 - 2s ; Figures 7B – 7D ) . Reducing Rho - ROCK - dependent cytoskeletal tension in these mammary tumors also reduces FAK pY397 , reestablishes tissue polarity ( basal β 4 integrin and 248 CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 LN - 5 ) , restores cell - cell interactions ( less diffuse β - catenin ) , permits lumen formation , and reduces colony size ( Figures 7B , 7F , and 7G ) . Normalizing tumor cytoskeletal tension also re - duces ROCK expression and ERK activity ( Figure 7J ) and lowers total and activated EGFR ( Figure 7I ) , which could ex - plain the significant reduction in proliferation and cytoskeletal tension also observed ( Figures 7C , 7D , and 7H ) . Thus , although in tumors integrin and GF - dependent ERK activation can be - come uncoupled from exogenous force cues ( matrix stiffness ) , some transformed cells do retain functional links between cy - toskeletal tension and Rho signaling , such that normalizing mechanosignaling can repress their malignant phenotype . Discussion Tissue stiffness can predict the presence of a tumor or the de - velopment of pathology with a heightened risk of malignant transformation , yet the relevance of tissue rigidity to tumor pathogenesis has been largely ignored . We showed that tumor rigidity reflects an increase in stromal stiffness and tumor cell tension . We found that even a small increase in matrix rigidity will perturb tissue architecture and enhance growth by induc - ing Rho - generated cytoskeletal tension to promote FA assem - bly and increase GF - dependent ERK activation . We deter - mined that a highly contractile , EGFR - transformed epithelium with elevated Rho and ERK activity can be phenotypically re - verted to form differentiated acini lacking FAs with reduced EGFR activity if Rho - generated cytoskeletal tension or ERK ac - tivity is decreased . Accordingly , these data underscore the po - tential existence of a mechanoregulatory circuit that functions to integrate physical cues from the ECM ( exogenous force ) with FA assembly through ERK - and Rho - dependent cytoskeletal contractility to regulate cell and tissue phenotype ( Figure 8 ) . Thus , tensional homeostasis may be essential for normal tissue growth and differentiation , and increasing tissue rigidity by stiffening the matrix ( fibrosis ) or by elevating Rho signaling through , for example , oncogene ( Ras ) - driven ERK activation , could induce cytoskeletal contractility to enhance integrin - dependent growth and destabilize tissue architecture ( Zhong et al . , 1997 ) . As such , conditions that induce tissue fibrosis ( matrix stiffening ; Akiri et al . , 2003 ) or situations that amplify oncogene activity to enhance ERK could facilitate malignant transformation by increasing cell contractility through Rho . Be - cause we found that transformed cells can retain a functional link between Rho - dependent cytoskeletal tension , integrins , and growth regulation , pharmacological inhibitors that target ROCK , ERK , or integrin adhesions could temper the malignant behavior of some tumors by normalizing activity through the cellular mechanocircuitry . Pertinent to the study of cancer biology is an understanding of how normal tissue differentiation is achieved . Three - dimen - sional ECM culture models have highlighted the importance of matrix compliance for tissue - specific differentiation and imply that cells in 3D might respond differently to growth , polarity , and death stimuli ( O’Brien et al . , 2002 ; Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 1998 ; Weaver et al . , 2002 ) . We found that matrix compliance differs dramatically between 2D and 3D cul - tures , and normal versus tumor tissue in vivo , and that faithful recapitulation of normal tissue morphogenesis is favored by matrix conditions with an elastic modulus that corresponds with normal tissues in vivo . Our observations are consistent A R T I C L E Figure 6 .

We also identified a plausible mecha - nism for these effects by showing how matrix compliance can influence cell fate by regulating Rho - generated cytoskeletal ten - sion to induce FA assembly and enhance integrin - dependent GF - induced activation of ERK . Moreover , we determined that some transformed cells have altered tensional homeostasis , which could partly explain why some malignant cells can grow and CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 249 survive in the absence of exogenous matrix tension ( i . e . , in sus - pension ) , fail to undergo differentiation in compliant 3D ECMs , and have elevated FAK pY397 in culture and in vivo ( Lark et al . , 2005 ; McLean et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . By illustrating how exogenous force and cytoskeletal tension are integrated , and how they could cooperate to influ - ence integrin adhesions and GF - dependent activation of ERK , our studies offer a fresh perspective for understanding the mo - lecular basis of tissue differentiation and tumor formation .

Model of tensional homeostasis and force - dependent malignant transformation ECM and form integrin adhesions that reflect the compliance of the matrix and the inherent activity of their contractile ma - chinery ( Bershadsky et al . , 2003 ) . We showed that matrix stiff - ness drives FA assembly to modify GF signaling and cell phe - notype by regulating ERK and Rho activity to modulate cell contractility . Using matrices of defined compliance and an ex - ogenous shear force , we showed that a force threshold exists that favors integrin aggregation and FA assembly . Because we found that integrin clustering precedes and is sufficient for ten - sion - dependent ERK and Rho activity and FA assembly , our data provide compelling evidence in support of the anisotropy adhesion model . This model maintains that the biochemical re - sponse of adhesions to cytoskeletal tension originates from the stress - induced elastic deformation of the adhesion site , such that the growth of FAs is mediated by the local density of pro - teins within the junction via force - initiated interactions ( Nicolas et al . , 2004 ) . Malignant transformation is characterized by a reactive stroma , altered stromal - epithelial interactions , and changes in integrins ( Guo and Giancotti , 2004 ; Zahir et al . , 2003 ) . Given that integrins facilitate tumor metastasis and can influence ex - I : Representative immunoblot of total and phospho - EGFR compared to E - cadherin in control ( Control ) , N19Rho - expressing ( N19Rho ) , and ROCK - inhibited ( Y - 27632 ) T4 - 2 MEC colonies .

CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 251 pression of the malignant phenotype ( Wang et al . , 1998 ; White et al . , 2004 ) , it is important to understand how integrins be - come altered to contribute to malignant transformation . We found that oncogene - induced tumors and their adjacent stroma are significantly stiffer than normal tissue and that mat - rix rigidity clusters integrins to enhance GF - dependent ERK ac - tivation and promotes growth and FA assembly through Rho - dependent cytoskeletal tension . Yet , we also determined that the aberrant morphological structures formed by GF - trans - formed or V14Rho - expressing cells with elevated ERK - and Rho - dependent cytoskeletal tension can be phenotypically normalized by treatment with either a MEK or myosin II inhibi - tor . Because inhibitor - mediated phenotypic reversion of these aberrant morphologies was associated with reduced cell force generation ( cytoskeletal tension ) and reduced ROCK expres - sion , this implies that a functional regulatory circuit exists be - tween integrins , ERK , Rho , and cytoskeletal tension to control cell and tissue behavior . By showing that exogenous force and endogenous force cooperate to regulate cell behavior through FA assembly / stabilization , we maintain that the type of integrin adhesion in a tumor may be more significant than the level of integrins expressed ( McLean et al . , 2004 ) . Rho activity is frequently elevated in tumors ( Fritz et al . , 1999 ) , and ROCK can destabilize AJs ( Sahai and Marshall , 2002 ) and promote tumor invasion and angiogenesis in vivo ( Croft et al . , 2004 ; Fritz et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , patients with inflammatory breast cancer who have elevated ROCK activity show high levels of metastasis and have the worst prognosis ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ) . Despite these data , the current paradigm maintains that Rho is a tumor suppressor because it promotes stable FAs that impede cell migration . According to this model , the invasive phenotype of Ras - transformed cells hinges upon their ability to downregulate ROCK and reduce cell contractility to destabilize FAs and permit cell migration ( Sahai et al . , 2001 ) . Yet , most studies examining the role of Rho in transformation have been conducted on tissue culture plas - tic ( highly stiff ) , which greatly enhances Rho activity , GF - depen - dent ERK activation , FA formation , and cytoskeletal tension . Given that balanced Rac and Rho activity is required for opti - mal cell migration , culture conditions that elevate Rho - depen - dent tension could distort experimental observations . By using matrix conditions that match the compliance of normal and transformed tissues in vivo , our data indicate that malignant transformation likely precedes along an exogenous and endog - enous force continuum . This paradigm implies that tissue ho - meostasis is favored by a compliant matrix and low integrin - ERK - Rho - cytoskeletal tension , whereas tumorigenic behavior initiates when the matrix becomes chronically stiffer and / or in - tegrin - ERK - Rho activity rises appreciably and remains elevated for protracted periods of time . A highly stiff matrix or exceed - ingly high integrin - ERK - Rho signaling would theoretically an - tagonize tumor invasion because it would promote the assem - A R T I C L E bly of multiple stable FAs . This model could explain why MMTV - Ras and Myc mammary tumors typically form encapsu - lated and highly rigid tumors that do not readily metastasize , and why early passages of Ras - transformed fibroblasts form abundant stress fibers with numerous FAs and fail to migrate on tissue culture plastic , until ROCK levels decrease ( Vial et al . , 2003 ) . In conclusion , ERK and Rho appear to be part of an integ - rated mechanoregulatory circuit that functions to link physical cues from the stromal ECM through integrin adhesions to mo - lecular pathways that control cell growth and tissue phenotype . A chronic increase in cytoskeletal tension , mediated by sus - tained matrix stiffness ( a prolonged injury or chronic inflamma - tory response ) , or through elevated ERK activity ( oncogene amplification ) if of sufficient magnitude and duration , could drive the assembly / stabilization of FAs to enhance growth and perturb tissue organization , thereby promoting malignant trans - formation of a tissue .

ROCK inhibitor was Y - 27632 ( 40 (cid:1) M ; Calbiochem ) , and myosin inhibitor was Blebbistatin ( 50 mM ) ; MEK - 1 inhibitors were PD 98059 and U0126 ( 12 . 5 (cid:1) M ; BIOMOL ) . Cell culture The HMT3522 and MCF10A MECs and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained as described ( Debnath et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , 1998 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . Mouse manipulations FVB - TgN ( MMTV - c - myc , Her2 / neu , and H - ras ) mice were maintained in ac - cordance with the guidelines of Laboratory Animal Research at the Univer - sity of Pennsylvania . Once tumors formed ( 12 – 24 weeks ) , mice were sacri - ficed , and the inguinal mammary glands were excised and analyzed . Tissues were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , and paraffin sections were stained with H & E for histopathological evaluation . Gel manipulations ECM - crosslinked PA gels were prepared and mechanically analyzed as de - scribed ( Reinhart - King et al . , 2003 ) . For more details , see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures available with this article online . Materials properties of tissues and natural gels An electromechanical computer - controlled indenter comprised of a minia - ture linear stepper motor ( minimal displacement 0 . 0032 mm ) , force trans - ducer ( load capacity 1 . 47 N ) , and a linear variable displacement transducer was used to measure the material stiffness of mammary tissue and ECM gels . The tangent elastic modulus of the unconfined stress - strain curve ( slope ) was calculated between 5 % and 15 % constant strain ( Gefen et al . , 2003 ) . 252 CANCER CELL : SEPTEMBER 2005 tfm Images of cells on PA gels containing fluorescent beads were collected before and after trypsinization using a Nikon Inverted Eclipse TE300 micro - scope and a Photometric Cool Snap HQ camera ( Roper Scientific ) . TFMs were calculated based on differences in bead displacement induced by substrate deformation and relaxation using a software analysis program ( Reinhart - King et al . , 2003 ) . Shear force manipulations Cells on FN - crosslinked PA ( 450 G # ) gel - coated coverslips were subjected to a centrifugal shear force ( room temperature [ RT ] ) and analyzed for mor - phology , integrin adhesions , and FAK . Because the strain field increases with radius from the center of the disk according to the equation τ = 0 . 800r O ( ρ (cid:1) ω 3 ) , where τ is the shear stress exerted on a cell , ρ is the density , (cid:1) is the buffer viscosity , and ω is the rotational speed , the force applied to each cell was calculated based upon its radial position on the disk and the applied RPM . Cell attachment strength was assessed based upon the τ 50 , which corresponds to the shear stress required to detach 50 % of the ad - hered cells ( Shi and Boettiger , 2003 ) . For more details , see the Supplemen - tal Experimental Procedures . Immunofluorescence Cells were extracted by CSK buffer and fixed or directly fixed using 2 % paraformaldehyde ( RT ) or methanol ( −20°C ) . Some cultures were embed - ded in sucrose and frozen in Tissue - Tek OCT compound , and 20 (cid:1) m sec - tions were immunostained . Paraffin - embedded tissue sections ( 4 (cid:1) m ) were subjected to antigen retrieval ( citrate buffer ) prior to immunostaining . All samples were incubated with primary mAb followed by Alexa - conjugated secondary Abs . Nuclei were counterstained with diaminophenylindole ( DAPI ; Sigma ) . Cells were visualized using a Bio - Rad MRC 1024 laser scan - ning confocal microscope attached to a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope . Images were recorded at 120× magnification . Morphometric analysis Cell area was calculated by tracing phase images of fixed cells , and colony size was determined by tracing colony diameter of live colony images using a Nikon Inverted Eclipse TE300 microscope and a Photometric Cool Snap HQ camera ( Roper Scientific ) and ImagePro software ( Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . To quantify integrin adhesion size , Z - stacked images of integrin adhesions were acquired using a Bio - Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope , and images were processed with a computer - based analysis package , Image - Pro ( Zajaczkowski et al . , 2003 ) , and statistically analyzed using a two - tailed Student’s t test . Proliferation Cell proliferation was measured by calculating the percent Ki67 - labeled nu - clei ( Weaver et al . , 2002 ) . Quantification of integrin activity and cell adhesion Cell adhesion was assessed using a fluorescence attachment assay ( Zahir et al . , 2003 ) , and integrin activity was quantified by immunoblotting ( Tzima et al . , 2001 ) . Immunoblot analysis Equal RIPA or Laemmli lysate was separated on SDS - PAGE gels , immu - noblotted , and detected with an ECL system ( Amersham ) . Vector description Myc - tagged V14RhoA and EGFP - tagged N19RhoA in LZRS - IRES - blastici - din were used directly ( Zahir et al . , 2003 ) . The constitutively active human β 1 integrin glycan wedge mutant G429N in pEF1 / V5 - His has been charac - terized ( Luo et al . , 2004 ) . V737N and G744N mutations were generated using the QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene ) from the full - length human β 1 integrin cDNA ( gift of Z . Werb ) , and constructs were fused by PCR to EGFP at the C terminus or expressed bicistronically with EGFP in the Tet off system . Ectopic gene expression Retrovirus was produced in 293 or Phoenix ampho cells ( G . Nolan ) , and cells were selected using G418 , puromycin , or blasticidin . Transfections A R T I C L E with wild - type β 1 in pcDNA 3 . 1 , G429N β 1 integrin in pEF1 / V5 - His , and EGFP in PRC CMV plasmid DNA were with Lipofectamine ( Gibco BRL ) . Rho GTPase activity Cells were lysed in G protein buffer , and Rho GTPase activity was assayed using purified GST - Rhotekin and a Rhotekin pulldown assay ( Tzima et al . , 2001 ) .
