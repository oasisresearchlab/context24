However , little has been learned about the impact of data quality ( DQ ) on decision performance . This study explores the effects of contextual DQ and task complexity on decision performance . To examine the effects of contextual DQ and task complexity , a laboratory experiment was conducted . Based on two levels of contextual DQ and two levels of task complexity , this study had a 2 x 2 factorial design . The dependent variables were problem - solving accuracy and time . The results demonstrated that the effects of contextual DQ on decision performance were significant . The findings suggest that decision makers can expect to improve their decision performance by enhancing contextual DQ . This research extends a body of research examining the effects of factors that can be tied to human decision - making performance . 1 . Introduction In the knowledge management literature , data are viewed as simple facts that become information as they are combined into meaningful structures [ 17 ] . In the IS literature , information quality is one of two major dimensions for evaluating the success of information systems [ 6 , 7 ] and decision quality is a function of information quality [ 15 ] . While the effects of information quality and the importance of information have been studied in IS literature , little has been learned about the impact of data quality ( DQ ) on decision performance . Thus , the purpose of this study is to empirically examine the relationship between data quality ( DQ ) and decision performance . According to Wang and Strong [ 19 ] , data quality must be considered within the context of the task at hand . Specifically , they define high - quality contextual data as data that can add value because it is relevant , timely , complete , and appropriate in terms of amount . Strong et al . [ 16 ] studied 42 data quality projects and found contextual DQ problems in practice . Their closer examination revealed three underlying causes for data consumers’ complaints that available data does not support their tasks : missing data , inadequately defined or measured data , and data that could not be appropriately aggregated . Since it is not well understood whether these contextual DQ problems affect problem - solving performance in decision - making settings , it would be worth investigating the effects of contextual DQ . In addition , the three causes for data consumers’ complaints could increase the level of task complexity , which in turn has a negative impact on decision performance . Therefore , this study , which is part of a larger study , empirically explores how contextual DQ and task complexity simultaneously affect decision performance . 2 . Theoretical background and hypothesis development 2 . 1 . Contextual information Contextual information is most useful for not only information retrieval ( IR ) functions [ 3 , 4 ] , but also browsing tasks [ 8 , 12 ] . According to Brown and Jones , the use of contextual information leads to improvements in precision and retrieval speed . Jul and Furnas [ 10 ] also asserted that contextual information plays an important role for effective information retrieval because each retrieval process takes place in a particular information environment and is tied to the specificity of the environment . Dourish et al . [ 8 ] studied two information systems , one paper - based and one electronic , managing similar information within the same organization . In addition to the fact that the 149 0 - 7803 - 9093 - 8 / 05 / $ 20 . 00 ©2005 IEEE . availability of contextual information makes browsing much more productive , they also found that information retrieved from these systems is interpreted subjectively by individuals , and point to contextual information contributing to this interpretation . Since this interpretation is critical in decision - making , it must be perceived to be correct and pertinent if information is to be of use to an individual . Based on these views , it could be possible to infer that decision - makers can benefit from high - quality contextual information because it can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of browsing and retrieval processes , as well as information interpretation processes . Therefore , when a person is given high - quality contextual data for the experimental problem - solving tasks , a positive effect of contextual data quality on decision performance is expected . Based on the discussion above , the following hypotheses are proposed . H1 : Regardless of the levels of task complexity , subjects with high - quality contextual data will require less time than subjects with low - quality contextual data . H1a : Subjects with high - quality contextual data for a simple task will require less time than subjects with low - quality contextual data for a simple task . H1b : Subjects with high - quality contextual data for a complex task will require less time than subjects with low - quality contextual data for a complex task . H2 : Regardless of the levels of task complexity , problem - solving with high - quality contextual data will lead to an increase in problem - solving accuracy compared to problem - solving with low - quality contextual data . H2a : Problem - solving with high - quality contextual data for a simple task will lead to an increase in problem - solving accuracy compared to problem - solving with low - quality contextual data for a simple task . H2b : Problem - solving with high - quality contextual data for a complex task will lead to an increase in problem - solving accuracy compared to problem - solving with low - quality contextual data for a complex task . 2 . 2 . Task complexity Task complexity is defined as the degree of cognitive load or mental effort required to identify and / or solve a problem [ 13 ] . According to Campbell’s [ 5 ] concept of task complexity , tasks that increase information load and information diversity are considered as complex tasks . Wood [ 20 ] suggests that complexity is a function of the number of acts that must be executed and the number of information cues that must be processed when performing a task . Thus , tasks are considered more complex as the number of acts and information cues increases . In an information retrieval context , task complexity increases as the number of potential solutions increases because decision makers must evaluate each potential solution if they want to get the most effective or accurate result [ 11 ] . Rossano and Moak [ 14 ] also suggest that mental workload increases as more data are evaluated and retained in working memory . Based on the discussion above , the following hypotheses are proposed . H3 : Regardless of the levels of contextual data quality , subjects with a simple task will require less time than subjects with a complex task . H3a : Subjects with high - quality contextual data for a simple task will require less time than subjects with high - quality contextual data for a complex task . H3b : Subjects with low - quality contextual data for a simple task will require less time than subjects with low - quality contextual data for a complex task . H4 : Regardless of the levels of contextual data quality , subjects with a simple task will make more accurate decisions than subjects with a complex task . H4a : Subjects with high - quality contextual data for a simple task will make more accurate decisions than subjects with high - quality contextual data for a complex task . H4b : Subjects with low - quality contextual data for a simple task will make more accurate decisions than subjects with low - quality contextual data for a complex task . 3 . Research methodology 3 . 1 . Experimental design To examine the effects of contextual data quality ( DQ ) and task complexity , a laboratory experiment was conducted . Based on the two factors , contextual DQ ( high vs . low ) and task complexity ( simple vs . complex ) , a 2 x 2 factorial design was implemented to test the hypotheses . The various attributes of data quality ( e . g . , aggregated data , missing ( incomplete ) data , and irrelevant data ) were used to map to the data type . Each subject’s decision performance was assessed based on predetermined measurement , and decision performance referred to solution time and the accuracy of problem - solving . A Web - based simple system to deliver the contextual data to the subjects was developed using the latest version of Web programming languages , Hyper Text Markup Language ( HTML ) , and Practical Extraction and Report Language ( PERL ) . 150 3 . 2 . Procedures The subjects were assigned randomly to one of the four treatments . The experimental task and a set of data were given to them . The task for this study asked subjects to solve a decision problem . In order to help subjects understand the decision - making rules for the task , an example to simulate the decision - making rules was provided . After that , the subjects were provided with an answer sheet to record their solutions as they performed the task . Next , with the data set and the task , the subjects made decisions . Finally , this study observed the effects of the various treatments on decision performance . 3 . 3 . Independent variables Two levels of task complexity and two levels of contextual DQ were operationalized as independent variables . 3 . 3 . 1 . Task complexity . The decision task created by Jarvenpaa [ 9 ] was used for this laboratory experiment , with some minor adjustments . It asks subjects to select a site for the construction of a Chinese restaurant . While the complex task asked subjects to select a site from among five alternative sites in which to locate a Chinese restaurant , the simple task asked subjects to select a site from among three alternative sites . The complex task had five factors for each site , while the simple task had three factors for each site . The factors were very important in deciding where the restaurant should be located . The scores for the factors were predetermined . 3 . 3 . 2 . Contextual data quality . The subjects supported with an appropriate amount of relevant , complete , and aggregated data in the form of tables were considered as being assigned to the experimental treatment of high - quality contextual data . On the other hand , the subjects considered as being assigned to the treatment of low - quality contextual data were given a limited amount of contextual data in the form of tables . That is , no aggregated data was given to them . In addition , they used irrelevant and incomplete data . For example , a couple of numbers in the data set given to the subjects was missing . Therefore , the subjects had to go through extra steps to infer the information necessary to make decisions . 3 . 4 . Dependent variables The dependent variable of this study is decision performance . Decision performance was operationalized as the accuracy of problem - solving and solution time . Problem - solving accuracy was measured by the number of correct answers from the correct solutions . Solution time was measured from the time when the subjects began working on the task until they recorded their solutions on their answer sheet and logged out of the system . Time pressure decreases decision accuracy [ 21 ] and can impair the performance of some decision makers more than others [ 1 ] . Because time factors , pressure or constraints , affect decision - making [ 1 , 2 , 21 ] , subjects were not informed of any time expectation for this experiment . 3 . 5 . Pilot study To test the experimental procedure and task complexity manipulations , two rounds of a pilot testing were conducted . A total of eight undergraduate students participated . The results of the pilot study indicated that there were ambiguities in the decision - making rules for the complex task . For the complex task , the subjects were asked to rank site alternatives from most desirable to least desirable , based on the decision rules defined in the task and criterion factors that were weighted . That is , the decision rules and the weighted scores of the factors formed the basis for the subject’s decision . The results indicated that the subjects assigned to the complex task were more likely to misunderstand the decision rules although an example to simulate the decision rules was provided . The examinations of the results led to make two adjustments . First , subjects were instructed with a revised example to help them understand the decision rules easily . Second , to reduce the degree of task complexity for the complex task , the numbers of factors and alternative sites in the complex task were reduced from 7 and 6 to 5 and 5 , respectively . 4 . Research findings A total of 40 undergraduate students from various academic programs at California State University , Fullerton , and California State Polytechnic University , Pomona , participated in the experiment . Of the participants , 65 percent were male , and 60 percent were younger than age 25 . The average age of participants was 24 . 6 years . The number of years in college was 2 . 8 years . Two - thirds of the participants were majoring in business administration . Problem - solving accuracy and time were each analyzed with two - way ANOVAs . The tests were carried out at a 95 % confidence level . The descriptive statistics for the dependent variables are summarized in Table 1 . 151 Table 1 . Descriptive statistics for problem Table 1 .

That means , more time was needed for both simple and complex tasks with low contextual DQ than for those tasks with high contextual DQ . The potential explanation for these results probably lies in the low quality contextual data used . The low quality contextual data used in this study includes irrelevant and incomplete data . In addition , no aggregated data was provided . As a result , subjects using the low quality contextual data needed additional time to deal with the low quality contextual data as well as the decision tasks . In addition , the results of the two - way ANOVA for time showed that the main effects of task complexity ( p = . 000 ) and contextual DQ ( p = . 000 ) were significant ( see Table 2 ) . Since the interaction effect on problem - solving time was significant , two one - way ANOVAs were performed for these variables . The one - way ANOVAs for time confirmed the significant main effects of task complexity ( F = 108 . 549 , p = . 000 ) and contextual DQ ( F = 17 . 712 , p = . 000 ) . The results indicated that the simple task was solved more quickly than the complex task . Therefore , H3 was supported ( see Table 4 ) . Also consistent with expectations , subjects using high contextual DQ took less time than subjects using low contextual DQ . Therefore , H1 was supported ( see Table 4 ) . Table 2 .

However , the ANOVA on problem - solving accuracy found a significant main effect for contextual DQ ( p = . 000 , see Table 3 ) . Therefore , H2 was supported ( see Table 4 ) . Surprisingly , the results showed that there was no significant main effect of task complexity for problem - solving accuracy ( p = . 438 , see Table 3 ) . Subjects completing the complex task had comparable problem - solving accuracy to those completing the simple task . Thus , H4 was rejected ( see Table 4 ) . This insignificant main effect of task complexity on problem - solving accuracy might lead to the insignificant interaction between task complexity and contextual DQ despite the significant contextual DQ effect on problem - solving accuracy .

These confounding results suggest that because there was no time constraint , that is , there was no specific allotment of time for making a decision , 152 subjects used as much time as they needed to complete the complex task while keeping problem - solving accuracy as high as possible .

Conclusions and discussion According to the theory of cognitive fit [ 18 ] , when there is a complete fit of representation and task type , each representation ( e . g . , tables or graphs ) will lead to both quicker and more accurate problem - solving . Vessey [ 18 ] states : “Spatial representations therefore best support the solution of spatial tasks ; similarly , symbolic representations best support the solution of symbolic task ( p . 227 ) . ” The task used in this study can be viewed as a symbolic task since it is best accomplished using precise data values . As mentioned previously , contextual DQ was found to influence problem - solving performance . This indicates that although there was a cognitive fit between representation ( e . g . , tables ) and task type ( e . g . , symbolic task ) , using high contextual DQ to solve the task resulted in more accurate outcomes than using low contextual DQ . In other words , when subjects used low contextual DQ , low contextual DQ detrimentally affected problem - solving performance by increasing cognitive complexity , despite a fit between representation and task type . Based on a review of knowledge management literature , this research assumed that data is a prerequisite for information and information can be created from its raw data . DeLone and McLean [ 6 , 7 ] postulated that system quality , information quality , and service quality singularly and jointly affect both system use and user satisfaction that are direct antecedents of “net benefits . ” Thus , based on DeLone and McLean’s model and the assumption mentioned above , this study predicted that improved data quality would positively affect information quality , which affects both system use and user satisfaction , which in turn have an impact on net benefits . The results of this study showed that the effect of contextual DQ influences problem - solving efficiency and effectiveness . Thus , the results of this study partially support the IS success model [ 6 , 7 ] in suggesting that information quality has an impact on user performance that is part of net benefits . That means , the analyses of research show that data quality as an antecedent of information quality has an impact on user performance . However , what is lacking is a detailed model for describing how data ( quality ) is transformed into information ( quality ) , the strength of the relationship between data ( quality ) and information ( quality ) , and the strength of the relationship between information ( quality ) , once transformed , and user performance . One area for future research would be to develop a model examining the transformation of data ( quality ) into information ( quality ) . Figure 1 presents a model for extending the IS success model by recognizing and including the contextual aspect of DQ into the model .

IS success model with contextual DQ Figure 1 . IS success model with contextual DQ Figure 1 . IS success model with contextual DQ The observed main effect of contextual DQ on problem - solving performance has practical implications for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of problem - solving . In order to improve users’ ability to make decisions , systems designers and managers should not only make data available to users , but also enable users to access better ( high - quality ) data . To accomplish this , it is recommended that systems designers and managers should support the task by providing users with high - quality contextual data that are complete and relevant to the task . As organizations increasingly adopt distributed repositories such as data warehouses , it seems clear that various kinds of valuable information can be dispersed across the information systems in an organization . Strong et al . [ 16 ] also found some DQ 153 problems caused by integrating data across distributed systems . Thus , in order to enable users access high - quality data , systems designers , builders , and database administrators should ensure the integrity of data in such distributed data warehouses . A number of limitations should be considered in terms of the methods used when interpreting the findings . It is almost impossible to control the influence of all potential extraneous variances by the nature of the experimental setting , the subject population , the subjects’ capability and characteristics , the decision support applications , the task type , and the set of data used in this study . In addition , data were collected from a small sample of 40 students . Furthermore , since the subjects were undergraduate students , the findings of this study might not generalize to a broader population . Because a single empirical study is not sufficient to validate the findings , further research should address these limitations and apply the findings of this study in specific contexts , population , and decision support technology as a whole . 6 .
