By John Seely Brown E ven those of us who haven’t been teaching very long don’t have to be told that today’s college students engage with the world differ - ently than we did when we were in school . Today’s students are comfortable satisfying their immense curiosity on their own . This capacity for independent learning is essential to their future well - being , since they are likely to have multiple careers and will need to continually learn new skills they were not taught in college . Our students will need to feel comfortable working in cross - disciplinary teams that encompass multiple ways of knowing . These chal - lenges require that we re - conceptualize parts of our educational system and at the same time find ways to reinforce learning outside of formal schooling . Luckily , successful models of teaching and learning already exist that we could emulate and build on . In the architecture studio , for example , all work in progress is made public . As a consequence , every student can see what every other student is doing ; every student witnesses the strategies that others use to develop their designs . And there is public critique , typi - cally by the master and perhaps several outside practitioners . The students not only hear each other’s critiques , but because they were in some sense peripheral par - ticipants in the evolution of each other’s work , they also have a moderately nuanced understanding of the design choices and constraints that led to the final result . As a result , the critique has substantial signifi - cance for them all—not just for the student whose project is under review . Now compare the efficiency of the professor’s use of time in this situation with that in a typical office hour . Also consider how students in studios start to John Seely Brown is director emeritus of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and a senior fellow of the Annenberg Center at the University of Southern California .

Think about how they start to practice the social and intellectual skills that enable them collectively to become a reflective practicum . They are , in short , becoming acculturated into the practice of architecture . Another current model worth emu - lating : the Technology Enhanced Active Learning ( TEAL ) project at the Massa - chusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , created by John Belcher , a professor of physics who was concerned with the low attendance and high attrition rates in his department’s electricity and magnetism course . This course used to be very efficient at convincing most students who thought they wanted to become physicists or engineers that the grass might be greener elsewhere . So Professor Belcher set out to build a studio for learning about electricity and magnetism—a bold move , consider - ing how theoretical this subject matter tends to be . A subject that traffics in field equations expressed as partial dif - ferential equations does not lend itself to intuitive mental models . Based on a studio physics course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , the TEAL classroom originally had 13 tables with nine students per table . Most of the students’ work involved building , running , and experimenting with simula - tion models and then solving problems . Although there was some recitation , there was no real lecturing . Instead , the professor and teaching assistants walked from table to table , looked at what in - teresting issues were unfolding , and oc - casionally interrupted the entire studio to discuss some glitch a particular table had encountered . The model didn’t work as well as Belcher had hoped . After the second year , he and his team began to real - ize that while they were all skilled at lecturing to 800 people , new teaching practices were required for this new kind of learning environment . Toward this end , they held a summer workshop to help faculty understand how to be successful mentors in a studio—for instance , how to produce activity - based learning rather than lecturing . From the workshop , a new set of practices started to emerge , and the course was redesigned using and perfecting these new practices . Assessment research on TEAL has shown that students who study in the TEAL format significantly improve their conceptual understanding of the various complex phenomena as - sociated with electromagnetism—with the net gain of the low - achieving students being the highest ( Dori & Belcher , 2004 ) . Because of its suc - cess , the TEAL studio model now has been extended to all of MIT’s freshman physics courses and has influenced teaching and learning practices in other departments at MIT . For example , the business school has built an interactive learning space in a new building to sup - port this technology - enabled pedagogy . Learning to Be If you look at the learning outcomes for the architecture studio and Professor Belcher’s physic classes , it is evident that in both environments , students move from “learning about” something to “learning to be” something—a cru - cial distinction . Lecturing can be a very effective way of communicating infor - mation about physics , but it is often not until graduate school that a student becomes an apprentice and learns what E X P L O R I N G T H E E D G E 20 Change ● September / October 2006 it means to be a physicist or a mathema - tician or a humanist . I was a second - year graduate stu - dent in mathematics at the University of Michigan taking a course from Pro - fessor Paul Halmos when I got my first glimpse of what it meant to be a mathematician . Somebody in our class asked him a question that he couldn’t immediately answer , and we all had the chance to watch him struggle with it . He was doing mathematical research ; he was exhibiting the practice of being a mathematician . I had spent six years studying theoretical mathematics and had never had the slightest glimpse of what it meant to be a practicing research mathematician . That one moment gave me that insight . I was spellbound . We need more of such spellbinding moments . We have to find ways for our students to “learn to be” much earlier in their educations . Today’s students want to create and learn at the same time . They want to put content to use immedi - ately . They want knowledge that is situ - ated and able to be acted on—all aspects of learning to be , an identity - forming activity . By proceeding along this path , a student bridges the gap between knowl - edge and knowing . Jean Lave’s theory of situated cogni - tion focuses on learning as enculturation into a practice , often through the process of “legitimate peripheral participation” in a laboratory , studio , or workplace set - ting . Although this term is often thought of as equivalent to apprenticeship learn - ing , it is a more general concept . In an apprenticeship , the student is there to learn a practice under a master who , if he or she is good , has carefully meted out a set of increasingly challenging activities for the student to perform . In peripheral participation the student is engaged in real work , fully participating in the tech - nical and social interchanges . He or she is able not only to learn to do the job , but also to pick up , as though through osmo - sis , the sensibilities , beliefs , and idiosyn - crasies of the particular community of practice . Learning happens seamlessly as part of an enculturation process as the learner moves from the periphery to a more central position in the community . Needless to say , each community is itself embedded in a broader epistemic frame ( a term coined by David William - son Shaffer ) , which suggests what prob - lems are considered interesting , what an elegant solution is like , what warrants are acceptable in an argument , and so forth . The frame is often only implicit , but being in a community of practice enables the learner to intuit and embody it . Underlying this all is the notion of en - gaging in productive inquiry , that aspect of any activity in which we deliberately seek what we need in order to do what we want to do . Learning to Speak Digital We now have tools and resources for engaging in productive inquiry and learning that we never had before . In today’s Internet environment , learning to be literate in multiple media is an important tool in learning to be . When we’re looking at new ways to teach , fac - ulty must understand how to foster this new literacy . In doing so , it helps to un - derstand the new vernacular of students who grew up digital . Much of the lan - guage is derived from film . Digital na - tives are interested in how cuts function , how montages create emotional tension , and how flashbacks and nonlinear nar - ratives can fold into linear time . There is also a language of interactivity that comes from the game world , especially from the massive , multiplayer role - play - ing games . In addition , our digitally literate stu - dents ( and hence we ) also must learn the skill of navigation . They develop , in a way , a sense of smell—they can sniff their way through the Web at blinding speed . They have an intuitive knack for locating resources within the vast reach - es of the Internet that those of us who speak digital as a second language labor to find—a skill that serves them well in the context of productive inquiry . All of these components come together to enable rich immersive , in - teractive genres that can be extremely expressive . In a conversation between George Lucas and Elizabeth Daley in the provost’s office at the University of Southern California ( USC ) , Lucas succinctly described the nature of this new literacy : “To tell a story now means grasping a new kind of language , which includes understanding how graphics , color , lines , music and words combine to convey meaning . ” Daley ( and USC more generally ) fol - lowed up on this insight by creating an Institute of Multimedia Literacy to ex - periment with how to provide both stu - dents and faculty the chance to develop these new literacy skills . The program has touched nearly every department at the university , including women’s studies , political science , religion , and even a course in quantum mechanics . Its purpose is not to teach about the tools of multimedia but rather to focus on new expressive practices enabled by these tools . For example , we all know how to make arguments in text , but how should we make an argument visually ? More generally , how can we communicate effectively using image , text , sound , movement , sequence , and interactivity ? Such skills are crucial today , given how challenging it has become to capture and hold someone’s attention . The success of this program has been due , in part , to a two - week summer work - shop that professors who want to be a part of the institute’s program must take . As in MIT’s studio - based learning efforts , it is of critical importance that professors and their teaching assistants experiment ahead of time with the medium , since a key part of using the tools of the institute in a course is that students must “write” their final papers in multiple media and publicly present them . Another aspect of the workshop is that the faculty bring along course syllabi and engage in some - thing like storyboarding to get a sense of the flow of the course content , as well as what kinds of multimedia assignments make sense and how to stage them . Re - flecting on courses from this point of view leads to some provocative discus - sions among the faculty in the workshop . Learning to Teach Digital Natives In addition to learning the digital ver - nacular , it is important that faculty ad - dress some key questions about today’s college - age students . How do they learn ? How do they like to learn ? How do they solve problems ? And most importantly , what creates meaning for them and helps them to construct their sense of self ? One way to answer these questions is by looking at video and computer games . The first thing you realize is that most video games are incredibly difficult to master . If you’re not extremely good at pattern recognition , sense - making in confusing environments , and multitask - ing—and if you’re afraid to constantly explore and push the limits—then you won’t do well in the game world . In this world you immerse yourself in an immensely complex , information - rich , dynamic environment where you must sense , infer , decide , and act quickly . When you fail , you must learn from that failure and try again and again and again . Continuous decision - making in conditions of uncertainty is the essen - tial skill . In addition , the gaming generation turns out to very bottom - line oriented . They want their performance to be mea - sured . They want to learn and , without metrics , they can’t tell if and how much they are learning . Surprising as it may sound , many gamers say that if they’re not learning , it isn’t fun ! It turns out that using excellent pedagogical principles in constructing a game—for instance , re - quiring that players tackle challenges that get increasingly more demanding , but at just the right pace—makes for great play . So game designers must know how to de - sign good learning environments . The more I study computer games , the more I think about the term “serious play . ” A story about a 16 - year - old boy named Colin might help explain what I mean . His dad was trying to convince him to take his history lessons about Rome more seriously . Colin’s knee - jerk reaction was , “I don’t want to study Rome . Heck , I build Rome every day in my online Cesar 3 game” ( or it could have been Civilization 3 ) . Then Colin and his dad started talking about class in our society . About halfway through the conversation the dad stopped and asked Colin , “What does class mean to you ? ” Colin thought for a moment and said , “You know , in Rome , your class was reflected by how close you lived to the Senate” ( only somewhat true ) . “I think today in the United States it probably reflects how close you are to a senator . ” Clearly Colin is forming some Change ● September / October 2006 21 22 Change ● September / October 2006 kind of model of the social dynamics in both Rome and today . At a minimum , he is engaged in pattern recognition and sense - making and is willing to apply those patterns to novel situations or questions . Let’s look at World of Warcraft , one of the most popular online multiplayer role - playing games in the world . ( The morning it was released in Beijing , 150 , 000 kids lined up outside to get it . Now , a year later , there are over 4 . 5 million players ) . Those who aspire to become guild leaders must build a guild , and those who don’t must join one , since nearly all of the quests that players go on to become more power - ful and to build up rank ( remember in games , everything is measured ) require multiple players . Quests are complex , require careful planning and training , and require amazing skill across a va - riety of roles . A high - level quest can - not be carried out by just warriors , for example . Healers and spell - casters are also needed , and all these players must function as a well - organized and prac - ticed team or a complex quest won’t be successful . So to build a guild , you must be able to attract , train , and retain other players to be part of it . I’ve now had the chance to study several of the best guild masters in the World of Warcraft and to explore the leadership skills that are necessary to being a guild leader . Stephen Gillett , one of the people I interviewed and watched , told me that guild leaders must create a vision and a set of values that attract other players . Next , they must find , evaluate , and recruit players who have a diverse set of skills that fit with the quest’s goals . Then they have to create an apprenticeship program to train new people very quickly . Next they have to orchestrate group strate - gies for the quest . But the biggest chal - lenge is to keep the guild running . To do this , they have to create , sell , and adhere to the governing principles of the guild and to adjudicate disputes and find equitable ways to split up the spoils of any successful quest . Since there can be as many as 40 people on a given quest , they may even need to persuade another guild to join forces . Isn’t this the skill set that a CEO , the creator of a startup company , or the leader of a non - profit organization needs to have ? People who write about game play seldom talk about the social life around the edge of the game , but here is where most of the thinking , planning , trading of arcane bits of knowledge , and learning actually transpire . Stephen has a very senior management role in one of the largest Internet companies in the Bay area , and he attributes his meteoric rise in management to the skills he learned in game play . Of course , one case hardly proves the rule , but the more I probe , the more I believe that his story is not all that unusual . These games were not designed to be vehicles for learning ; the kind of learning that Colin and Stephen expe - rienced is an accidental effect of the game . Might it be possible to create games whose primary aim is to enhance this kind of learning ? Note we are not talking about games designed to teach something explicitly but rather games the playing of which results in the de - velopment of useful social , technical , or managerial skills . Douglas Thomas at the Annenberg School of Communication at USC is currently designing such a multiple - player role - playing game , called Mod - ern Prometheus . But unlike World of Change ● September / October 2006 23 Warcraft , this game is designed to be a classroom : His course in culture , history , and ethics , based on Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein , will he held in the game space . In it , students will experience ethical dilemmas that emerge as unintended consequences of the decisions they make in playing the game . Each decision either opens up or closes off later choices in the game . Students can better understand the com - plexities of ethical judgment and better evaluate the choices they make if they see the effects of those choices . They can also play a variety of roles , which allows them to identify with different perspectives and experience directly how each set of choices affects a variety of people . Learning to Network Since , as the previous examples suggest , learning can be a powerfully social act , there are ways to blur the distinction between formal and infor - mal learning . In the networked age , communities organize themselves around the Internet , forming their own distributed learning milieus . A kind of learning to be emerges from joining and becoming a full participant in a com - munity of practice , which requires the participant to assimilate the sensibilities and ways of seeing the world embodied in that community . This is also what happens when someone joins an open - source commu - nity . Although each has its own unique constitution and style of working , near - ly all of them have certain key practices in common . For example , code is writ - ten so that it can be read , improved upon , and extended by others and is thoroughly tested by the creator before being submitted to the community . New members nearly always begin by writ - ing and patching non - kernel code . Hav - ing made enough contributions that are robust , useful , and done in the style of the community , neophytes are eventual - ly allowed to make contributions to the kernel operating system code—a real achievement . That is how they become recognized as key members of the community . This process trains thousands of par - ticipants about good software practices . Said differently , what has emerged is a powerful “distributed cognitive ap - prenticeship” that functions across the world . Today there are about one million people engaged in developing and refining open - source products , and nearly all are improving their skills by being part of these networked commu - nities . The key to learning here is that all contributions are subject to scrutiny , comment , and improvement by others . And there is social pressure to take the feedback seriously . Although there is no formal credentialing process , it in - formally exists . Being asked to join the governing council of an open - source community or to oversee what code gets accepted and installed in the kernel of an open - source system is the mark of an advanced practitioner . Compare this to traditional academic training in computer science . In my own education , those of us who could tried to write “clever” code—code that was so mysteriously and compactly written that very few could figure it out . Although we often learned from each other , there were certainly no mechanisms that supported the social aspects of learning , and it never felt as though we were joining a learning com - munity . The open - source movement has changed this and transformed how many people learn to be computer pro - fessionals . Furthermore , this “openly share and improve as a community of practice” principle has been applied broadly in education to transform learn - ing and teaching in various ways ( Iiyoshi , 2005 ) . Demand - Pull Learning In the 20th century , the approach to education was to focus on learning - about and to build stocks of knowledge and some cognitive skills in the student that would be deployed later in ap - propriate situations . This approach to education worked well in a relatively stable , slowly changing world where a student could expect to use one set of skills throughout life . But the concept of lifelong learning—a term used all too glibly—is now more important than ever . When technical jobs change , we can no longer send a person back to school to be re - trained or to learn a new profession , because by the time the for - mal educational process is completed , the domain is apt to have morphed yet again . A different approach is called for , an approach suggestively called a “demand - pull” rather than the tradition - al “supply - push” strategy . In the new approach , the focus in education moves from building up stocks of knowledge ( learning - about ) to enabling students to participate in flows of action , where the focus is on learning to be through en - culturation and on collateral learning . This is Dewey for the digital age : a profoundly social construction of understanding enabled by the Internet . The demand - pull approach draws stu - dents into a rich ( sometimes virtual ) learning community built around a practice . It is passion - based learn - ing , intrinsically motivated by either wanting to become a member of that community of practice or just wanting to learn about , make , or perform some - thing . Formal or informal , learning hap - pens in part through a kind of reflective 24 Change ● September / October 2006 practicum , but here the reflection comes from being embedded in a social milieu supported by both a physical and virtual presence and inhabited by both amateurs and professionals . A demand - pull approach to learn - ing seems to be extremely resource intensive . After all , lecture halls that handle 800 students correspond to an industrial model of efficiency , the goal of supply - push . The demand - pull form has no such streamlined equivalent ; its efficiencies come from the degree to which participants educate themselves and each other , as they carry out studio - based practica . The Internet is quickly becoming a vast resource for supporting demand - based learning , and there is a rapidly growing amount of open courseware . A number of powerful instruments and simulation models running on super - computers also now exist that can be remotely accessed by learning communities both in and out of school . Social software enables communities to form and find each other , to learn through remixing , tinkering , and shar - ing artifacts using the rich media now available . Multiplayer game platforms are becoming interesting experimental platforms for the social sciences , open to anyone who wants to participate . In the arts , we have digital movie - mak - ing , digital photography , and music - making with programs such as Garage Band . What we end up with is a vast and relatively unexplored “learning - scape . ” This is a new kind of experien - tial learning or an experiential medium for learning through participation . Suppose we consider a hybrid model of learning wherein we combine the power of passion - based participa - tion in niche communities of practice , with a limited core curriculum for teaching the rigorous thinking and argumentation specific to a particular field . ( Designing such a core would require an elegant minimalism . ) With the nearly infinite number of niche communities that exist on the Internet , it is reasonable to expect any student of any age to find something that he or she is passionate about . For middle - and high - school students , finding and joining such communities might happen outside of formal schooling and might actually become a new role for public libraries . College students might join such communities through their own or another institution . We might also see learning that begins in one community but then branches as students develop interests and skills , thus weaving a tapestry of niche com - munities of interest and core curricula . Each community would help ground and complement the others . Such an experience would certainly be a great foundation for lifelong learning in a world of accelerating change . Dori , Y .
