There is a broad recognition that much of the design proceeds by modiﬁcation of previous ideas ( e . g . , Oxman , 1990 ) and that experts amass collections of examples and precedents to employ in design ( e . g . , Lawson , 2004 ) . In - deed there are attempts to introduce students to relevant design prece - dents ( e . g . , Heylighen and Verstijnen , 2003 ) . However , much of the previous research has tended to focus on reference , recall , and reason - ing , and to neglect the vital role of explicit external sources of inspiration in triggering and guiding designers’ activities . It appears that many at - tempts at computer support and most research starts with conceptual design ; this paper reports on research which attempts to investigate the even earlier gathering of sources of inspiration and exploration of ideas and hence to understand the mechanisms by which inspiration is harnessed ( see also Eckert and Stacey , 2000 ) .

The work examines how sources of inspiration ( such as photo - graphs , images , previous garments , art work , swatches , artefacts or natural objects ) are gathered and transformed into practical designs , i . e . , into commercially viable products . Current practice and ‘received wisdom’ are often based on myths and misunderstandings of the crea - tive process ( Billings and Akkach , 1992 ; Eckert and Stacey , 1994 ) . An understanding of the mechanisms by which inspiration is harnessed is necessary for the development of better design environments ( including appropriate computer support tools for designers ) and for the improve - ment of design education . The focal questions of the reported research were the following : 1 . What is the nature of sources of inspiration , and how are they used ? 2 . Is there commonality of behaviour among designers in the early de - sign process with respect to use of sources of inspiration ? 3 . Are there discernable design ‘sub - processes’ in common use ? The research was largely elicitative and descriptive and therefore com - bined methods in order to explore the use of sources of inspiration from diﬀerent perspectives and hence enable triangulation . The ques - tions were addressed in a progressive series of three empirical studies : ( i ) targeted in situ observation and semi - structured interviews to under - stand design activities in their natural context ( related to the ‘cog - nitive ethnography’ characterised by Ball and Ormerod , 1998 ) ; leading to ( ii ) constrained design tasks in order to study the use of visual sources of inspiration by diﬀerent designers in comparable settings , and us - ing outcomes from those studies to derive cognitive accounts to guide ( iii ) computational modelling of portions of the spatial abstraction and transformation processes , in order to assess the suﬃciency of the emergent accounts of design behaviour . This three - phase , multiple method approach allowed us limited ver - iﬁcation of the ﬁndings . Inductive analysis was undertaken in order to derive accounts of this very early design activity from observed and reported behaviour . From the descriptive accounts , we 2 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 2 / 41 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F proposed possible cognitive accounts of underlying reasoning , por - tions of which we implemented in computational models .

This paper presents the results of the design studies . The next section jus - tiﬁes the choice of domain . The three phases of empirical study are de - scribed in turn , with methods , ﬁndings , and discussion presented for each . Finally , discussion and summary sections consider overall ﬁndings . 1 Why knitwear design ? Knitwear is an example of ‘practical design’ in a fast - moving and highly competitive manufacturing industry that makes both technical and aes - thetic demands of the designer . It is a constrained , tractable design do - main , typically involving individual designers designing independent , low - resolution , static artefacts . The fast design turn - around ( driven by an annual cycle of fashion ‘seasons’ ) provides opportunities to observe the design cycle in a limited period . Because of the technical and manufacturing factors and the need for eﬀective hand - over from designer to technician , the mechanisms for realising design d for taking it from the conceptual stage through manufacture d are well - established ( albe - it little articulated ) procedures . Knitwear designers have a cultural openness about what the sources of inspiration are , and so the sources , and their adaptation , are relatively accessible to external observation . The nature of knitwear imposes particular design constraints , because the stitches are discrete , forming a relatively coarse matrix to support the colours and textures of the yarn which will produce the ﬁnal pattern . The choice of yarn ( i . e . , its weight and texture ) may introduce distor - tions into that matrix . Manufacturing constraints are also tight , because of physical limitations of yarns , technical considerations of the machine knitting process , low unit costs ( and hence cost controls leading to lim - itations on yarns , numbers of colours , and even the development of new stitch patterns ) , and fast turn - around ( with as many as six collections presented by a company in a single year ) . The design must be suitable to be knitted d and then suitable to be worn . Hence , the use of sources of inspiration can involve a variety of trans - formations that can give insight into aspects of design reasoning . For ex - ample , the transformation from one form to another : transformation into a design motif typically requires transferral from a continuous me - dium ( e . g . , a continuous painting or photograph ) to a ‘granulated’ form ; Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 3 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 3 / 41 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F transformation from a natural object requires translation from a three - dimensional object to an eﬀectively ‘two - dimensional’ fabric ; the low resolution of knitted fabric means that even the simplest transplanta - tions of motifs tend to require some kind of abstraction or simpliﬁca - tion . Many transformations require spatial reasoning . Knitwear shares important characteristics with other design domains : (cid:1) typically involving external sources of ideas and re - use or re - interpre - tation of ideas , (cid:1) requiring consideration of technical constraints within the earliest de - sign phases and throughout the design process , (cid:1) involving spatial reasoning in several interlocking problem spaces ( e . g . , the design of the motif or surface pattern d subject to the constraints of the knitwear matrix , the design of the fabric structure or stitch pat - tern d subject to the constraints of the yarns and knitting machines , the design of the garment shape d subject to the constraints of the fab - ric and construction , especially with regard to knitted - in shaping ) , (cid:1) subject to market and marketing pressures . The project sought , within the context of practical design , to identify and model the processes by which sources of inspiration are identiﬁed , assessed , and adapted . Knitwear was selected as an appropriate domain because it shares key similarities with other domains while including constraints that make it relatively accessible for study . Further , prag - matically , members of the project team had knowledge of the industry and access to expert designers in it . 2 Phase 1 : observation and interviews 2 . 1 Methodology for phase 1 In the ﬁrst phase , knitwear designers at work in industry on real product lines were interviewed and observed , with particular attention to design - ers’ source - gathering activities . This encompassed 18 companies in - volved in knitwear design in the UK , Italy , and Germany , plus one hand - knitting designer . Observations d shadowing staﬀ designers as they were available d were conducted over a number of days in three companies . In two of these three cases , it was possible both to follow particular designers at intervals throughout the period of observation and to follow a number of diﬀerent designers for shorter periods . In the third case , a single designer was 4 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 4 / 41 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F shadowed intensively over a two - week period . In addition , short obser - vations ( i . e . , within a single day ) were conducted in three other compa - nies , each with additional time for interviews . Observations included watching people through the design process , listening to conversations among designers , and attending to the workspace and broader environ - ment . The extent of observation was constrained by how much access was permitted by the companies ; hence , it was determined pragmatically . Semi - structured interviews were conducted in all 18 companies , often with more than one designer . The interviews focused on three areas are as follows : (cid:1) the general design process ( including time , constraints , decision making ) , (cid:1) research activity and use of sources of inspiration , (cid:1) use of materials ( e . g . , samples , boards , workspaces ) . Data were collected in ﬁeld notes , and using audio or video recordings and photographs where permitted . Some participants allowed us to gather design materials . Most of the data collection was done by Dr . Claudia Eckert , the project’s Research Fellow , who is multi - lingual . The observation and interview phase allowed us to collect examples of how designers behaved and how they reported their activity . It allowed us to see design activities in context , and to focus our questions and shape our subsequent design studies . Analysis was delayed until all data were collected , to help us avoid anticipating parallels and allow us to observe each company in its own terms . Analysis of the observa - tion and interview data followed vectors of enquiry d that is , analysis focused on key issues about the nature , use , and adaptation of sources of inspiration . The intention was to understand the range of behaviour observed and to note patterns within it , to note interactions with the work environment , to examine the relationship between observed be - haviour and reports , and to identify clues to phenomena requiring fur - ther investigation ( such as reports of instantaneous whole designs , or transformation to a gridded design ) . 2 . 2 Findings from phase 1 : observation and interviews The research conﬁrmed that there is discernible commonality within the individual variation in the early design process for knitwear , and that in - dividual practices incorporate common patterns which can be codiﬁed .

Often , designs based on sources of inspiration are implemented through re - use of existing patterns which emulate the overall eﬀect ( since re - use is cheaper than development of new structure patterns ) . Many dimensions of design d yarn , shape , colour , complexity of motif , fabric structure d are constrained by what is feasible and aﬀordable to produce on knit - ting machines . The patterns of behaviour we report were consistent through the inter - views and through the observations ( and they were corroborated subse - quently by the constrained tasks , described below ) . Similar behaviours were seen in diﬀerent contexts , both in short visits and in the longer ob - servations . Sometimes , activities mentioned in interviews or during short visits were observed in the more intensive sessions , so that there was considerable comparability of behaviour and report . The transition from source of inspiration to its interpretation in a design is something that typically happens quickly , and so was observable both in shorter and longer visits . This consistency and the breadth of the interview coverage give us con - ﬁdence in the representativeness of the observations , even though ( for pragmatic reasons ) they were not as extensive as we would have wished . 2 . 2 . 1 Sources of inspiration Designers immerse themselves in environments rich in inspiration : col - lecting examples , amassing libraries , pinning notes and images around their workspaces , and so on . They engage in a continual search for and collection of sources of inspiration ( despite that they often do so without management recognition or support ) . The sorts of sources ob - served in use by professionals include (cid:1) other garments from market leaders and competitors , from their own past collections , and from history ; (cid:1) representations of garments , including sketches , photographs , descrip - tions , and patterns .

The use of sources of inspiration was observed in all companies and all designers . 2 . 2 . 2 Designers’ design research Each design season begins with design research ( Eckert , 1997 ) . During the research stage , designers set the context for the garments to be de - signed , setting a theme , selecting yarns , and designing colour palettes ( typically 5 e 7 colours ) . Setting context is heavily inﬂuenced by fashion forecasts and customer proﬁles . Once the ‘look and feel’ are sketched out through themes , yarns , and colour palettes , designers produce a ‘de - sign framework’ which speciﬁes which garments a collection will con - tain : numbers of garments , types of design , styles and proportions . For example , a nautical theme might be reﬂected in a ‘mood board’ that includes a lighthouse and boat watercolour , some fabric swatches and paint chips reﬂecting colours selected from the watercolour , some yarn and cord samples , and some photographs of ﬁshermen at work and of boats . The ‘look and feel’ might be characterised by selected colours and yarns that derive from the ‘mood board’ . The corresponding collec - tion might include speciﬁed numbers of men’s and women’s cardigans and pull - overs , some single - colour with speciﬁed textures , some plain - knit with multiple colours and motifs ; including variations in neckline and details ( such as pockets and buttons ) , all loosely proportioned . 2 . 2 . 3 Use of sources Designers use sources of inspiration primarily to plan the conceptual de - sign of a future season’s collection , or for relatively direct translation into a particular garment design ( e . g . , a patterned cardigan intended for a male golfer ) . Diﬀerent , even disparate , sources can be combined in one garment . Designers use sources of inspiration to serve diﬀerent functions in the design process : (cid:1) they provide a context for the fashion to be designed , bringing into play awareness of the external physical and social environment ( e . g . , austerity tailoring in war - time ) , of fashion trends in general ( e . g . , ‘Annie Hall’ and ‘grunge’ were pervasive styles ) , and of broad themes that might shape a collection ( e . g . , military dress , or ‘ﬂower power’ ) ; (cid:1) they provide information about the ranges and capabilities of compet - itors , by providing examples of styling and design , trade - oﬀs between materials and pricing , and use of manufacturing technologies ; Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 7 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 7 / 41 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F (cid:1) they are used as the source of features , such as necklines or proportions ; (cid:1) they provide a basis for adaptation for detailed designs , suggesting el - ements , features , and ideas that can be incorporated into a particular design ( e . g . , reﬂecting a nautical theme in an anchor pocket motif ) ; (cid:1) they provide a means of conveying design ideas by making reference to the source , that is , designers point to examples to explain what they mean , e . g . , pointing to a physical garment to indicate a detail of construction . 2 . 2 . 4 Visualisation Interviews suggest that designers rely heavily on mental visualisations of designs . Many designers report mental images which they perceive as ‘complete’ designs , typically as worn on a human body . The perception of ‘completeness’ may be misleading ; elaboration of these images often includes indeterminacies and variabilities . It appears that they can visu - alise fabric pieces accurately in their minds , and that they explore op - tions through visualisation . They can answer questions from their mental images ( e . g . , does it have a peplum or not ? ) , and they describe altering aspects of their images ( e . g . , revising a neckline or sleeve length ) and focusing on details ( e . g . , how many buttons ) . Their images can in - clude colour and texture . 2 . 2 . 5 Sketching Sketching is also crucial . The nature of the sketching activity suggests that it is both expressive and reﬂective : often designers sketch quickly and without hesitation , erasing little ; sometimes they conﬁrm lines by going over them repeatedly , tidying the sketch without adding informa - tion . Designers normally work on one part of the design at a time ( e . g . , border , then central motif ) . They appear to hold only a small number of features in mind at any one time , and then select new ones at need . Sometimes they study the source before each design . Often they go straight to the next design without any delay . This dual function is cor - roborated by the designers’ self - reports ; they talk about ‘getting it down’ and also about evaluating balances of colour and pattern based on sketches . Many designers mentioned using a knitwear computer - aided design ( CAD ) system to ‘sketch’ in a comparable way . 2 . 2 . 6 Designs in communication Designers often discuss designs by reference and analogy to previous de - signs d so that sources of inspiration provide a sort of ‘index of 8 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 8 / 41 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F communication’ . In other words , the labelled designs themselves con - tribute to a design description language based on reference . At each stage of the knitwear design process , designers may refer explicitly to sources of inspiration to capture and communicate their design inten - tions ( e . g . , to other designers , to buyers , to technicians , to clients ) . For example , theme boards often contain sources of inspiration ( e . g . , images , artefacts ) to help convey the ‘feel’ or unifying idea . Design frameworks may be conveyed through design sketches , swatches , yarn samples , and clippings of previous garments or designs . Designers some - times rationalise the inspiration process for marketing presentations . 2 . 3 Phase 1 discussion We undertook an inductive analysis of the designers’ self - reports , iden - tifying commonalities and regularities , and distilling design processes . The next section describes four accounts of design processes emerging from that analysis . The subsequent section then relates these accounts to observed design behaviour . Finally , the accounts are related to other notions and models in the literature . 2 . 3 . 1 Four possible accounts from designers’ reports Working from the designers’ reports of their design processes , we de - rived four possible accounts of their design processes ( including use of sources of inspiration ) : ( i ) The holistic account , that designers produce whole designs con - ceived instantaneously in reaction to a source of inspiration ; the vi - sualised garment is experienced subjectively as a complete design , although details may not be fully resolved . ( ii ) The decision cascade account , in which the design emerges from the processes enacted as the consequence of a sequence of decisions , or decision cascade : decisions ( which initiate design procedures ) have consequences constraining and requiring subsequent decisions , etc . ( iii ) The goal - and - cliche´ account , that designers decide on high - level goals which are realised through a series of design cliche´s ( i . e . , schemas or templates ) , and that the cliche´s in turn inﬂuence the decision space . ( iv ) The plan and procedure account , that designers make a high - level plan ( e . g . , key structural decisions ) and then ﬁll in the details through a series of design procedures ( encompassing goal , selec - tion , and realisation , e . g . , ‘to make a border , . ’ ) or cliche´s . The last three accounts ( which we will call the ‘decision sequence ac - counts’ ) have much in common ( in each , early decisions change the Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 9 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 9 / 41 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F context for subsequent decisions ) , but are distinguished for this discus - sion in order to highlight their distinct emphases : the decision cascade account is a sequence that emphasises increasing constraint without working from an overall plan or goal ; in the goal - and - cliche´ account , de - sign is driven by a hierarchical goal structure : as known design solutions are associated with goals , new sub - goals may be generated or the goal - structure adjusted ; the plan and procedure account is plan - ( rather than goal - ) driven , and the plan is elaborated by design procedures ( or heu - ristics ) as well as by implementation of known solutions . The ‘odd one out’ is the holistic account , which is included because some designers reported that complete designs appear instantly in their minds when they see sources of inspiration . This description has similarities with the ‘aha ! ’ phenomenon investigated by Akin and Akin ( 1996 ) among others , who highlight the fact that what they call a ‘sudden men - tal insight’ does not arise from nothing , but from certain preparation which creates the conditions conducive to creativity . Hence , apparently ‘instant’ design relies on earlier mental preparation . We speculate that , in their continual collection of sources of inspiration , designers are building repertoires . It seems plausible that they are ana - lysing and designing as they are gathering : responding to the sources and mentally building ‘stubs’ or partial designs , classifying examples and associating them with other material of that class , toying with de - sign ideas even when they are not working on a particular collection . These ‘stubs’ may be added to the designer’s repertoire of ‘cliche´s’ . This is corroborated by many designers’ own accounts . Hence the ‘ho - listic account’ can be understood as analogous to Japanese brush - stroke painting , in which considerable mental preparation and contemplation are externalised in a ﬂuid , almost instantaneous rendering . This speculation re - casts and de - mystiﬁes the holistic account in a way that has more evident similarity to the other accounts that associate ex - isting design solutions and ideas with goals or plans . Both the goal - and - cliche´ account and the plans and procedures account may be understood as drawing on a repertoire derived in part from analysis of sources of inspiration . 2 . 3 . 2 Relating these accounts to observed designer behaviour These accounts are based on what designers report of their experiences and thinking through the early design process .

Typically , a given design example showed indications consis - tent with more than one account . So , it appears that any one designer employs more than one strategy , and that multiple strategies may be em - ployed within a single design example . For example , designers often sketch quickly and without hesitation , sug - gesting that they are externalising a design which they hold ‘whole’ in their minds d they talk about ‘getting it down’ . This is consistent with the holistic account , but it is also consistent with the goal - and - cli - che´ account . Designers normally work on one part of the design at a time ( e . g . , bor - der , then central motif ) . This is consistent with the three ‘decision se - quence accounts’ , where the initial selection of focus ( the choice of which part to work on ) may be arbitrary , goal - driven , or plan - driven . It emphasises that much design is focused on simple decisions in a con - text of previous choices . Designers appear to hold only a small number of features in mind at any one time , then select new ones at need . Again , this is consistent with the three ‘decision sequence accounts’ d and in - consistent with the holistic account . Designers talk about evaluating balances of colour and pattern based on sketches . The use of iterative evaluation supports a ‘decision sequence account’ , especially the decision cascade account . In summary , the ﬁndings highlight certain aspects about the design process : (cid:1) At many points in a sequence of design decisions ( i . e . , a design pro - cess ) , the decisions are simple ones , concerning a limited focus on particular features . (cid:1) Each design decision contributes to a developing context for the sub - sequent design decisions , and designers display sensitivity to this de - veloping context .

Many models have been proposed of the design process ( see Cross , 1989 for an overview ) . Of these , one of the simplest is shown in Figure 1 . The general idea in all of these models is that the design follows an iterative process of generation and modiﬁ - cation d as we , too , have observed d until it is evaluated as being sat - isfactory , after which it can be communicated to those who will fabricate the object . This is consistent with both reported and observed behaviour in this study . The model admits the notion of partial instantiation , al - lowing a design to develop from an initial conceptual scheme ( with few details of the parts or even their precise relations ) through gradual or part - wise instantiation as design decisions are made . We observed de - sign behaviour consistent with this model : designers appear to hold only a small number of features in mind at any one time , selecting additional features or re - focussing their attention at need ; and designers tend to work on part of the design at a time . The emergent decision sequence accounts , based on designer self - report and clariﬁed through observa - tion of designer behaviour , are compatible with this model of the design process . 2 . 3 . 3 . 2 Cognitive perspectives . The emergent decision sequence ac - counts also map onto existing cognitive perspectives on design activity and sub - processes . Those perspectives are themselves based on empiri - cal investigations in a variety of design domains . Hence , notions of ‘plan’ , ‘procedure’ , and ‘cliche´’ used in our emergent accounts follow GENERATION EVALUATION COMMUNICATION Figure 1 A simple process model of design 12 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 12 / 41 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F usage in other domains ( e . g . , in software design , as described in Gilmore and Green , 1988 ) . Bartlett ( 1932 ) suggested that memory takes the form of schemata which provide a mental framework for understanding and remembering . In general , the term ‘schema’ is used to indicate a form of mental template which organises cognitive activity such as memory , reasoning , or behav - iour . Key characteristics or elements in the schema have ‘slots’ in the mental template : the slots represent the range of values acceptable for those key characteristics . Schemata may be of varying levels of complex - ity and abstraction ; their importance is in providing structure and economy . Hence , our ‘procedures’ and ‘cliche´s’ may be understood as schemata . The decision sequence accounts concern how schemata are accessed and employed during the design process . Simon ( 1973 ) observes that , when a task is ill - deﬁned , users resort to pre - existing concepts : stereo - types , schemata , or other knowledge . Cole and Kuhlthau ( 2000 ) see the use of schemata as fundamental to sense - making at the outset of problem solving : the problem - solver invokes a schema or model of the problem in order to create a frame of reference and hence to identify the initial problem state . Similarly , Lawson ( 2004 ) discusses the way schemata are used by experts to recognise design situations for which gambits and precedents are available . We have seen that designers draw on sources of inspiration to help structure the problem and estab - lish an overall strategy . The emergent decision sequence accounts em - body strategies that can be understood as successive employment of design schemata . 2 . 3 . 3 . 3 Mental imagery . Self - report suggests that designers rely heavily on mental imagery incorporating indeterminacies and variability as well as the abilities to manipulate design components and to alter mental focus . Selection of focus appears to be an important mechanism : designers appear to work on one part of the design at a time and to focus on a small subset of features . Designers appear to be able to visualise past designs readily and hence to draw them into their mental design imagery . Logie ( 1989 ) provides an explanation of how this might be achieved . He describes an economy of images in memory , through which access to previously unrelated bits of information might be achieved : many infor - mative elements are integrated together in a structural whole , increasing the available amount of information in working memory . Hence remem - bered rich images are encoded in some way , so that they can be referred Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 13 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 13 / 41 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F to economically . The resultant juxtaposition of the rich images in mental imagery can generate new associations and insights . In this way , mental imagery is associated with insight . For example , An - derson and Helstrup ( 1993 ) argue that mental imagery is a source of dis - covery and synthesis . Bartlett ( 1927 ) wrote that imagery leads into bypaths of discovery . 2 . 3 . 3 . 4 Shared referents . Logie’s notion might also help to illuminate the observed use of sources of inspiration d of images d as an index of communication . The use of images as referents allows designers to index into rich visual memory . The labelling of those images or referents al - lows designers to externalise their associations and to communicate them to other designers , turning them into shared referents . Meaningful discourse requires shared referents . Using sources of inspiration as an index of communication is a mechanism by which shared referents can be established . 3 Phase 2 : constrained design tasks 3 . 1 Methodology for phase 2 The second phase focused on designers performing realistic but con - strained design tasks with supplied resources . It aimed to gather evi - dence on the use of sketching , on decision sequences , on spatial manipulation and reasoning , and on mental imagery . The tasks were constrained in a way that removed some design considerations ( like shape design ) while preserving realistic complexity of others ( like motif design ) d hence facilitating our identiﬁcation of abstraction and trans - formation activities . This is not unrealistic ; for example , designers at company M ( an anonymised designation ) design with just such a separa - tion , ﬁrst creating the Jacquard woven pattern for the fabric without re - gard to shape , and then designing the shape using the patterned fabric . Designers talked aloud during the tasks after concurrent verbalisation instruction and practice . The sessions were videotaped from two angles , in order to capture the designers’ actions and gestures in the environ - ment , and to capture their handling of the materials when scanning and sketching . All of the products of the design process ( e . g . , sketches , samples , mood boards ) were collected in the sequence in which they were produced . Each designer was interviewed after the design tasks , in - cluding some review of the videotaped session ; we were interested in elic - iting their phenomenological perceptions of their design processes . 14 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 14 / 41 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F The design task was to produce one or more sketched sweater designs ( to any level of ﬁnish ) for a prescribed , simple shape ( see Figure 2 , i . e . , to produce designs for the motif or surface pattern ) from a given source . The task was performed with two diﬀerent sources : a photograph of a Persian carpet ( Figure 3 ) and a print of a William Morris wall hang - ing design ( Figure 4 ) . The sources were chosen to be diﬀerent from each other in style in order both to accommodate diﬀerences in designers’ own preferences , and to mitigate against bias arising from the source . The sources were chosen to mimic sources observed in use by designers and to provide suﬃcient richness to inspire a variety of designs . Design - ers were given about 30 min for each source . This was largely an elicita - tion exercise , aimed at gathering information about : ( a ) selection and manipulation actions observed in the transforma - tion from source to product ( to be gathered into an informal ‘catalogue’ ) , ( b ) decision sequences ( in order to plot the ‘trajectory’ of selection , de - cision , and action ) , and ( c ) mental imagery ( from which we hoped to elicit some indication of how complete and detailed designers’ mental images of designs are ) . The study was conducted with three cohorts : ( i ) 11 professional knitwear designers from various companies ( our fo - cal group ) ; ( ii ) 9 M . Sc . knitwear design students ( allowing us to make some com - parison between their behaviour and that of professional designers ; note that such students typically have industrial experience of tasks of this sort through placement schemes or prior experience ) ; ( iii ) 4 non - designers ( used as pilot subjects and to provide some insight into the signiﬁcance of design education and experience ) .

Designers intermix these strategies ﬂuidly , in no particular se - quence . Strategies associated with each sort are elaborated below . 3 . 2 . 1 Selection strategies The analysis ( an earlier version is presented in Eckert , 1998 ) reveals a va - riety of selection strategies by which designers identify elements in the source and select them for transformation and placement onto the de - sign . For example , (cid:1) Selection of interesting features ( source - driven ) : The designer picks in - teresting features from the source and look for opportunities to use them in the design . Features may include design elements ( e . g . , mo - tifs , shapes , patterns ) , colours , and relationships ( e . g . , combinations , proportions , juxtapositions , spacing ) . (cid:1) Mirroring using salience priority ( source - driven ) : The designer puts the most salient feature from the source onto the garment in a similar role ( e . g . , a central motif ) . Then the designer seeks other features in the source that complement that usage , often continuing to echo the conﬁguration in the source ( e . g . , taking a diamond shape from the source in Figure 3 as the central motif , and scattering smaller horse shapes around it ) . (cid:1) Essence extraction ( source - driven ) : The designer analyses the source for its key characteristic elements ( e . g . , complex borders ) and rela - tionships ( e . g . , proportions or combinations ) and then tries to express these in the design , possibly translating them into traditional patterns or interpreting them as stitch structures . (cid:1) Instantiation of class ( design - driven ) : Designers have in mind a class of usage , for example a portion of the layout ( such as an overall pat - tern or a border ) or a structure ( e . g . , an intarsia panel ) and look in the source for suitable design elements to fulﬁl that class . This is like ‘ﬁlling in gaps’ : ‘I have this class of usage , and I need ‘one of these kinds of elements’ to ﬁll it’ . When the design nears completion , this sort of selection may indeed be ‘gap - ﬁlling’ . (cid:1) Role fulﬁlment ( design - driven ) : This is similar to instantiation of class , but reﬂects attention to aesthetics or ‘feel’ of the design , rather than to the layout . The designer seeks design elements that fulﬁl an aesthetic role in the design , e . g . , providing contrast with other fea - tures , adding colour , adding ‘life’ . (cid:1) Realisation of concept ( concept - driven ) : The designer selects design el - ements and relationships which reﬂect the essence of a concept or 18 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 18 / 41 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F theme , e . g . , the crucial or ‘signature’ constituents of Arts and Crafts style . 3 . 2 . 2 Kinds of adaptation The analysis ( Eckert , 1998 ) identiﬁed kinds of adaptation executed by the designers ( see Figure 5a e f for examples ) : (cid:1) Literal : No adaptation is intended ; the source element is copied as di - rectly as possible into the design ( although the constraints on knitted fabric usually entail some simpliﬁcation or change of resolution ) . (cid:1) Simpliﬁcation : Deliberate simpliﬁcation , e . g . , to reduce the number of colours or the complexity of detail ; selection of some details and omission of others . (cid:1) Abstraction , leading to a design which captures the essence of the source , but not the speciﬁc elements . The abstraction may maintain key visual properties of the source or may retain only abstract prop - erties ( e . g . , complexity , relationships , pattern structure ) . (cid:1) Modiﬁcation or variation through re - arrangement , replacement , or re - combination of elements , or through introduction of other material . (cid:1) Association with other elements or ideas which are visually similar , which originate in a similar context , which have similar properties in a diﬀerent context , or which remind the designer of related ideas .

Human strategies for creative design which are similar to those observed in our constrained tasks have been identiﬁed and discussed by others . For example , Rosenman and Gero ( 1993 ) , in their discussion about the use of prototypes in creative design , suggest two basic approaches to creating new structural elements . One d not mirrored in our obser - vations d is ‘building from ﬁrst principles’ , creating a design from basic ‘building blocks’ . The other is to build on previous designs and modify them using any of three creative design processes : (cid:1) combination ( bringing elements from previous designs and combin - ing them in novel ways to create a new design ) ; (cid:1) mutation ( modiﬁcation of the structure of a single existing element ) ; and (cid:1) analogy ( generalising through functional attributes to artefacts out - side the current domain ) . Our observed adaptations have similarities to these processes . Sim - pliﬁcation is a form of design by mutation . Association and deviation are forms of design by analogy , although the association may not be based on functional attributes but on aesthetic notions or on experi - ential resonances ( that may seem arbitrary to an observer ) . Modiﬁca - tion includes some design by mutation but , since it may involve introduction of other material , it also relates to design by analogy . The purpose of both abstraction and literal is not to produce a new structure but simply to transport the source of inspiration to the knit - ted garment and so falls outside Rosenman and Gero’s description . Gero ( 1994 ) identiﬁes an additional creative design process d emergence d whereby new , previously unrecognised properties are perceived in an existing design . Cross , too , uses all four of these processes in his analysis of the ‘creative leap’ in the design of a bicycle luggage rack ( Cross , 1997 ) . Emergence was not explicit in the observed adaptations , but it could be implicit in any of them except literal . What the designers are identifying to extract and adapt may be an emergent property . 3 . 2 . 3 Transformation mechanisms The transformation mechanisms identiﬁed are familiar forms of spatial manipulation ( like those available in most drawing programs ) : (cid:1) translation ( moving to another position ) , (cid:1) reﬂection ( mirroring ) , 20 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 20 / 41 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F (cid:1) rotation ( turning around a point ) , (cid:1) scaling ( changing size proportionately ) , (cid:1) attenuation or other distortion ( e . g . , stretching , twisting ) , (cid:1) truncation ( cutting oﬀ a part or edge ) . These are augmented by repetition and combination d sometimes producing ‘emergence’ . The ﬁndings suggest that the source - to - design transformation process uses a repertoire of relatively few , simple mechanisms for selecting and adapting design elements from inspirational sources . 3 . 3 Discussion of phase 2 d a combinatorial account based on ‘parts’ and ‘relations’ From the activities we saw designers conduct and describe in phase 2 , we identiﬁed strategies of selection , adaptation , and transformation . These are collections of simple strategies of limited scope . These simple strat - egies , when used in combination , can produce complex and sophisti - cated designs d and designer behaviour . Further , we see that these strategies combine , through their successive or combined application , to produce a developing context within a given garment design . From these ﬁndings , we derive an account of the design activity ob - served in phase 2 that encompasses these strategies and suggests how some of the observed complexity results : a combinatorial account , based on ‘parts’ and ‘relations’ . One can view an object as being characterised by a set of constituent parts , and by the relations which establish how those parts are conﬁgured . Thus , design is a process in which designers identify constituent parts of the artefact they are trying to create , and assemble these under appropriate relations to produce a new whole . The key to the parts - and - relations view is that it lifts the focus from vis - ible design elements to more abstract design elements . What designers ‘select’ may not be a part ( e . g . , a visual element ) , but may instead be a re - lation ( e . g . , an essence , a conﬁguration ) . So the parts - and - relations view accounts not just for direct translations , but also for more abstract inter - pretations of sources of inspiration . Thus , some designs may be novel because they put together new combinations of components in estab - lished ways ( Figure 6a ) . Others may be novel because known sets of com - ponents have been assembled in new relations ( Figure 6b ) . The observed selection , adaptation and transformation strategies can be understood as means for ﬁnding and using interesting parts and relations Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 21 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 21 / 41 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F from the source , in order to place them ( and possibly re - conﬁgure them ) into the new design . In general , the early design process involves selection of parts and relations , the recognition and understanding of emergent re - lations , and the setting of new relations and understanding of their con - sequences . So early design negotiates ( both creating and comprehending ) a developing context with both designed and emergent relations . Further , this proposed combinatorial account helps us to explicate many interesting characteristics of the design process and its outcomes observed in phase 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 Closing the loop on the design accounts The decision sequence accounts derived in phase 1 d and speciﬁcally the aspects of the design process which they highlight d can be understood in terms of this parts - and - relations view of design . (cid:1) The simple design decisions on which each of the accounts is based correspond to identifying constituent parts of the artefact and assem - bling them under appropriate relations . The emphasis on simple deci - sions provides a mechanism for limiting focus . (cid:1) The sequence of decisions corresponds to the accumulation of parts - and - relations combinations . The sequence provides a developing de - sign context , that is , the accumulated relations d and their develop - ing inter - relations d provide a backdrop against which subsequent parts - and - relations decisions are made .

The evaluation of deci - sions leads to iteration through the developing structure of decisions . 3 . 3 . 2 Complexity through combination Given that the set of available components is large ( as we can see that the number of components one might identify even in our two sources is large ) , the possible combinations of those parts are huge . Complexity here is in terms of size of the combinatorial space d the number of pos - sible parts and relations . And the complexity is ampliﬁed because the simple combinations can in turn be composed into other combinations . In addition to the sheer scale of the space of possible solutions , there is the eﬀect of interactions among elements and combinations . Each design decision ( e . g . , each new selection and relation of parts ) contributes to a growing context for the design . Complexity arises here not just from numbers of possibilities but from interactions among design choices . The assembled parts may have emergent properties not possessed by their components . That is , more complexity is introduced because of new properties that arise from the interactions among elements . For ex - ample , unrelated parts in relation can start to look like something else ( e . g . , fried eggs and sausage on a plate looking like a face ) ; parts in rela - tion may assume a dominance in the balance of the overall design that the parts would not command individually ; parts in repeated combination may suggest a rhythm or pattern in the overall design ( e . g . , a repeated let - ter ‘c’ d ccccccccc d suggesting a scalloped pattern or waves ) ; and so on . In other words , simple combination of simple elements leads to complexity . 3 . 3 . 3 Managing complexity by restricting focus The parts - and - relations view not only provides an insight into how read - ily complexity can arise from a sequence of simple decisions , but also provides an insight into a mechanism for managing complexity by re - stricting focus . Complexity is sustained through the whole network of relations , but the designer can treat the division into parts as a way of ‘modularising’ the design space . As observed , designers normally work on one part of the design at a time , for example handling the cen - tral motif separately from the border . 3 . 3 . 4 An index of communication Having a repertoire ( a body of experience of design ) allows a designer to use known solutions in new contexts .

Naming provides a means of access , allowing objects to be spoken about , referred to , and related to similar objects , both current and from prior experience ( e . g . , a 1940’s peplum jacket , a nautical central motif , last year’s autumn theme ) . We observed earlier that designers use labelled designs as an ‘index of communica - tion’ . Naming may adapt existing vocabulary to current activity and ex - perience ( e . g . , use of metaphor ) , or may create new vocabulary ( e . g . , grouping instances or forming new associations ) . By naming we allow a parts - and - relation combination to be referred to as an entity . It also allows that entity to be related to other entities . Giving names is part of forming abstractions d the name can represent an abstraction over a group of related instances ( i . e . , a group of similar parts - and - relations combinations , e . g . , sawtooth borders ) . And of course , naming can form abstractions over abstractions , thus creating a conceptual hierarchy ( e . g . , repeated geometric borders ) . So , for example , a designer in our study might name parts of the carpet design : chevron , diamond , horse , bract . Names might be given to classes of parts , such as repeated geo - metrics , joined - together ﬂowers , or complex diamonds . Names might be given to parts in context : repeated chevrons border , three - diamond central motif , Greek key border enclosing a complex motif . Hence , nam - ing provides a way of categorising and structuring a repertoire ( i . e . , or - ganising it into a conceptual structure of design abstractions ) and accessing the repertoire . 3 . 3 . 5 Design inspiration This combinatorial parts - and - relations view provides an insight into de - sign inspiration e designers relate what they ‘see’ in sources of inspira - tion to their whole repertoire of design knowledge . Hence , selection and adaptation from a given source may be direct d or it may incorpo - rate this interaction with the repertoire to produce something indirect or unexpected . This provides a context for understanding the ‘creative leap’ , about which Cross ( 1989 , 1997 ) suggests that the ‘perceptual act underlying creative insight in design is more akin to ‘bridging’ than ‘leaping’ the chasm between problem and solution’ . 3 . 3 . 6 Cliche´s and design signatures The parts - and - relations viewpoint allows us to understand design signa - tures ( individual , company , style , cultural , etc . ) in terms of ‘palettes’ or ‘repertoires’ or ‘preferences’ of particular elements and combinations and conﬁgurations . For example , Edwardian buildings may be charac - terised crucially by key architectural elements and proportions . 24 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 24 / 41 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000 1001 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 1007 1008 1009 1010 1011 1012 1013 1014 1015 1016 1017 1018 1019 1020 1021 1022 1023 1024 1025 1026 1027 1028 1029 1030 1031 1032 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F Some designers produce designs which identify them like a signature . This may involve using the same kind of materials ( such as stainless steel columns in architecture ) or a particular range of values for a given de - sign parameter ( such as a particular palette of colours in clothing de - sign ) . Or it may involve the emergent properties of the whole , as in the ‘sweeping’ awning coverings of the Richard Rogers’ buildings . The implication is not that a designer repeats designs , but that , in the terms developed here , certain elements and / or relational sub - structures may recur throughout the designer’s work . The description given here allows a distinction to be made between cli - che´s determined by the inclusion of given sets of elements , and cliche´s determined by the relational structure between elements . The advantage of using cliche´s ( i . e . , design schemas or templates ) is that they provide well - known structures and sub - structures as entities ( perhaps named en - tities ) at their own hierarchical levels , but they do not necessarily pre - empt original combinations of the cliche´d elements with other elements or sub - structures . 3 . 3 . 7 Provisionality The parts - and - relations account accommodates not just bottom - up de - sign but also design working down from abstractions or higher levels of granularity . Higher - level relational structures may be decided ( e . g . , a jumper will have a motif and border structure ) before the lower - level parts - and - relations are ﬁlled in . This supports both the exploration of diﬀerent instantiations of a selected higher - level structure ( and possible iteration during that exploration ) , and the accommodation of indeter - minacies and variabilities during design . This is supported by naming , which allows a design element ( whether a structural element such as a border or sleeve , or a surface pattern ) to be referred to without going into detail . Naming allows reference to be made to design abstractions such as style or categories of design elements without a particular instantiation having been decided ( e . g . , ‘a Fair Isle pattern’ when the particular pattern is yet to be decided ; ‘a 1940’s peplum jacket’ , when the cut and dimensions of the peplum have yet to be speciﬁed ) . Hence , it is not necessary that a design is fully instantiated at any par - ticular time . The importance of ‘provisionality’ and the ability to retain indeterminacies during the design process has been stressed in other design contexts as well , e . g . , typographic design ( Hewson , 1994 ) , Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 25 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 25 / 41 1033 1034 1035 1036 1037 1038 1039 1040 1041 1042 1043 1044 1045 1046 1047 1048 1049 1050 1051 1052 1053 1054 1055 1056 1057 1058 1059 1060 1061 1062 1063 1064 1065 1066 1067 1068 1069 1070 1071 1072 1073 1074 1075 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F architecture ( Akin , 1978 ) , and software design ( Petre and Blackwell , 1997 ) . 4 Phase 3 : computational modelling 4 . 1 Methodology for phase 3 Based on the results of the ﬁrst two phases , we proposed a simple com - putational model divided into four steps : selection of ‘interesting’ graph - ical objects ; adaptation of those objects ; placing of the resulting objects onto the garment shape ; and evaluation of the resulting garment . All phases are regarded as iterative , whether singly or in combination . In human performance , these steps appear to be bundled up in continuous multiple cycles of selection , adaptation and transformation , placement and evaluation . Our designers were continually selecting , re - selecting , transforming , placing and moving , and evaluating their designs as they sketched and re - sketched ideas . To assess the viability of this model , we programmed it in C CC and our strategy was pragmatic : to use the simplest interpretations and imple - mentations feasible . We therefore implemented the ﬁrst three steps : se - lection , adaptation and transformation , and placement . The earlier studies made clear that evaluation is crucial in design , however we made the strategic and pragmatic decision not to incorporate evaluation into the computational model . First , the model concentrated on the transformation - from - source and therefore on generation activities . Sec - ond , our earlier studies concentrated on the reported and observed de - sign process and did not elicit evaluation heuristics . Third , our focus was on the viability of the model . Therefore , our assessment was based on whether the model could generate reasonable proportions of plausi - ble , aesthetically pleasing designs according to human judges , not whether it generated only good designs . Indeed , even our human profes - sional designers produced unpleasing designs ( by their own estimation ) . We used the implementation of our model to produce designs for the same simple knitted shape , using the same sources of visual inspiration as in the constrained tasks . Our focus was on the viability of the model , i . e . whether it could possibly reproduce designs comparable to those we had observed in our studies . 4 . 1 . 1 Selection Human perception is a complex activity which is the subject of other , so - phisticated modelling eﬀorts ( e . g . , Gero , 1992 ; Kolodner and Wills , 1996 ; Souﬁ and Edmonds , 1996 ) and is outside the scope of our work . 26 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 26 / 41 1076 1077 1078 1079 1080 1081 1082 1083 1084 1085 1086 1087 1088 1089 1090 1091 1092 1093 1094 1095 1096 1097 1098 1099 1100 1101 1102 1103 1104 1105 1106 1107 1108 1109 1110 1111 1112 1113 1114 1115 1116 1117 1118 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F Therefore , the ﬁrst step in implementing our model was to deﬁne a sim - ple process analogous to human perception that could be automated . We employed a technique for identifying blocks of pixels which could be identiﬁed as ‘one element’ in the source . This consisted of four steps : 1 . digitise the sources of inspiration ; 2 . identify high contrast pixels . The technique of thresholding was em - ployed . ‘Thresholding’ identiﬁes objects on the basis of whether or not the intensity of a pixel exceeds a given threshold value . This value can be calculated automatically ( Johnson and Simon , 2001 ) ; 3 . identify horizontal runs of high contrast pixels ; 4 . identify contiguous horizontal runs which can be aggregated to form a polygon . This process of translating a set of pixels into a polygon is illustrat - ed in Figure 7 ; the resulting polygons were taken as the ‘interesting objects’ to be placed on the garment shape . The parameters for the size of horizontal runs and the number of con - tiguous runs could be varied by the user . The eﬀect of this was to identify diﬀerent elements from the source and therefore to create diﬀerent images . 4 . 1 . 2 Adaptation and transformation For each individual ‘interesting object’ extracted from the source , our implementation could apply two adaptations : literal ; or modiﬁcation through re - arrangement or combination . In addition , simpliﬁcation through reducing the number of colours and losing detail was a by - prod - uct of the selection strategy adopted , and was therefore supported automatically . The transformations that could be applied were : translation ( moving to a diﬀerent location ) , reﬂection ( about a vertical axis ) , rotation ( through 90 (cid:2) ) , and scaling ( half size or double size ) . 4 . 1 . 3 Placement Placement strategies were not identiﬁed explicitly from phase 2 . However , designers’ selection strategies included some placement mechanisms : central motif , overall pattern or border . Our implementation used place - ment strategies of horizontal stripe ; vertical stripe ; all - over design , with Figure 7 Translating a set of pixels into a polygon Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 27 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 27 / 41 1119 1120 1121 1122 1123 1124 1125 1126 1127 1128 1129 1130 1131 1132 1133 1134 1135 1136 1137 1138 1139 1140 1141 1142 1143 1144 1145 1146 1147 1148 1149 1150 1151 1152 1153 1154 1155 1156 1157 1158 1159 1160 1161 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F objects placed randomly ; all - over design , with objects placed on a ran - domly - sized grid ; single motif , placed centrally ; single motif , placed ran - domly ; and border ( around the bottom of the body and the end of the sleeves ) . In our program , each ‘interesting object’ that had been selected for in - clusion in the design was associated with a ‘placement’ in an object - placement pair , and these were then instantiated onto the garment shape . However , apart from the border and central motif placements , no account was taken of the exact location where objects would be placed on the shape . For example , when generating the random grid for an all - over design , no action was taken to make sure that the pattern row ﬁnished with a complete object at the neckline , or sleeve edge . In this sense , the placement strategy was unsophisticated . The overall plan for a given knitwear design was speciﬁable by the user or determined randomly by the program , in terms of (cid:1) the number of objects ; (cid:1) the speciﬁc objects and their placements ; (cid:1) a speciﬁc combination of object - placement pairs , ( e . g . , combining one object in a border with another in a central motif ) ; and (cid:1) the colours to be used . Our observations from phase 2 also indicated that placing objects onto a garment shape is context - dependent . It is inﬂuenced by the overall plan for the garment , so that designers tend to place objects in classiﬁ - able positions . Object placement is also context - dependent because it is inﬂuenced by the prior placements of other elements . We modelled this behaviour in part with three heuristics : (cid:1) for certain kinds of objects ( ‘open’ shapes which partially enclosed a space , such as a ‘C’ shape ) , placement would be repeated with the object reversed ; (cid:1) any open spaces would be ﬁlled ; (cid:1) the ‘all - over’ placement excluded any other placements . 4 . 2 Findings from phase 3 : computational modelling Having tried a variety of values for the parameters determining which objects would be chosen , the parameters used were set at threshold 64 for the carpet and 32 for the wall hanging ; for the majority of the design 28 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 28 / 41 1162 1163 1164 1165 1166 1167 1168 1169 1170 1171 1172 1173 1174 1175 1176 1177 1178 1179 1180 1181 1182 1183 1184 1185 1186 1187 1188 1189 1190 1191 1192 1193 1194 1195 1196 1197 1198 1199 1200 1201 1202 1203 1204 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F generation , we used 50 ! 50 as the size of the object . The threshold ﬁg - ures varied because of the relative contrast in each image . Although the system allowed the user to specify the overall plan for a garment by manipulating four constraints ( number of objects , speciﬁc object - placement pairs , combinations of object - placement pairs , and colours ) , and we explored numerous variations of those constraints , our assessment concentrated on designs generated with minimal human intervention . We did this in order to test fully the viability of our model , since if the user were to choose the object - placement pairs , for example , then an element of human design is introduced into the process . Hence , in the designs below , the program was entirely responsible for the design decisions . Leaving constraints unspeciﬁed meant that the full range of design heuristics built into the implementation were em - ployed , including the heuristics for making decisions in the context of a developing design . The assessment focused on viability d on the abil - ity of the program to produce reasonable numbers of designs compara - ble to those produced by the observed designers d and hence the trials focused on designs generated substantially by the implemented model . This paper concentrates on those examples ( see Figures 8 e 11 ) . The software generated some designs that are comparable with design - ers’ output , for example , Figure 8a and b shows comparable pairs of de - signs , one generated by a designer and one generated by the computational model . Figure 8b shows an example of comparable liter - al adaptation . The resolution of the images taken from the sources meant that when they were increased in size the pattern became fuzzy , but it is still possible to see that the central motif chosen is the owl . As another example consider Figure 9 . The designer’s sketch shows a ca - ble feature . The software’s version produces a similar eﬀect using an all - over pattern on a grid . Not surprisingly the machine - generated designs are not able to produce designs deliberately using abstraction , but some of the randomly - gener - ated designs create interesting juxtapositions and overlaps that might be the basis of further inspiration , and result in emerging properties . For example see Figure 10 . Other automatically - generated designs that have a ‘designerly’ quality are shown in Figure 11 .

This model uses simple techniques for selection and adaptation , and simple contextual strategies . These techniques and strategies were based on those observed by our de - signers in phase 2 . Some of the designs produced by our model are chaotic and would not be chosen for further development by human designers ( indeed , they would never be sketched in the ﬁrst place ) .

Although the automatically - generated designs are typically less sophisticated than those produced by professional designers , they nevertheless display some comparability d people recognise them as plausible and ‘pleasing’ designs .

As discussed above the model does not take into account various aspects of the design process we observed in our studies : 1 . It does not include all the adaptation and transformation strategies observed ; 2 . The strategy for placing objects on the garment shape is not sophisticated ; 3 . The computational model does not include any evaluation . Future work on the model could include adding capabilities to ad - dress these three areas . A key aspect of future work on the compu - tational model is to focus on evaluation , which we discuss below . 4 . 4 . 1 Evaluation The evaluation problem may be thought of as combining two diﬀerent aspects : ﬁrst that of identifying suitable criteria for judgment of ‘good - ness’ and second that of searching through the space of possible designs in order to identify designs that are good enough . The technical constraints on performing a search through a large design space are relatively easy to formulate and will not be discussed here , but the aesthetic constraints are much more diﬃcult to deﬁne , and much more controversial . Since we come at this from a computational per - spective , our ﬁrst task is to formulate properties of designs which can be recognised by the machine . These must relate to human criteria , but in the ﬁrst instance may seem very ordinary compared to the dis - course of a human designer . The designs we have generated suggest some criteria for evaluation , each of which could be ‘computed’ auto - matically . For example , 1 . Symmetry Symmetry is an important organising principle in design . Devising an operational deﬁnition of symmetry for automatic recognition has sig - niﬁcant pattern recognition problems . However , patterns laid out on a grid may have underlying symmetry which could be useful . Otherwise various axes of symmetry could be established , and one side of the axis be reﬂected to the other for matching . In the simplest case one could deﬁne a measure of symmetry based on numbers of matching pixels . Better would be to deﬁne symmetry in terms of matching objects 32 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 32 / 41 1334 1335 1336 1337 1338 1339 1340 1341 1342 1343 1344 1345 1346 1347 1348 1349 1350 1351 1352 1353 1354 1355 1356 1357 1358 1359 1360 1361 1362 1363 1364 1365 1366 1367 1368 1369 1370 1371 1372 1373 1374 1375 1376 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F made up from pixels . These measures could be further reﬁned by con - sideration of colour . 2 . Regularity / Randomness Some of the images we generated left large areas with no pattern . Certain - ly this is a striking visual feature , which can be recognised automatically . 3 . Shape repetition Some of our designs used a single shape to create patterns while others used many abstracted shapes . 4 . Colour combinations and contrasts Colour is obviously an important aspect of a design , and colours come and go from fashion as much as shapes and geometric arrangements . The numbers of diﬀerent coloured pixels can be counted , and they can be reﬁned with reference to objects . Contrasts can also be computed , with pixels of one colour close to pixels of another , or areas of one col - our being close to areas of another . From a technical viewpoint the search selection mechanism could be done on the ﬂy , applied to populations of designs , or both . Evaluation of a single design on the ﬂy has the lowest computational complexity . Evaluation of designs from populations may have higher computational complexity , for example if every design were compared with every other the number of comparisons would be of the order of the square of the number of designs . If the population contained in a small number of de - signs , say 10 , then 100 comparisons would probably be computationally feasible . If the population contained a million designs , the implied ( 1 , 000 , 00 ! 1 , 000 , 000 ) / 2 calculated could be too many to compute in the available time . The following discussion considers a few of the many search techniques available to aid selection of the ‘best’ designs . 1 . Hill climbing and gradient descent The idea in hill climbing is that , from a given design , one examines oth - er designs and if they are better discard the current design to retain the better design . This means that one is always getting better . If the other designs being evaluated come from the same part of the search space , one may end up with a local optimum which , nonetheless , is not very good from a global perspective . For example , our research has shown that some designers become ﬁxated so that all their designs have some Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 33 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 33 / 41 1377 1378 1379 1380 1381 1382 1383 1384 1385 1386 1387 1388 1389 1390 1391 1392 1393 1394 1395 1396 1397 1398 1399 1400 1401 1402 1403 1404 1405 1406 1407 1408 1409 1410 1411 1412 1413 1414 1415 1416 1417 1418 1419 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F common theme or property . This ﬁxation limits the design space these designers will examine and they may miss much better options available to less ﬁxated designers . However , it may be that subspace to which they are ﬁxated contained particularly good designs which are close to the global optimum . The problem with this kind of search is that you do not know whether you are in a good part of the search space or not . Of course the market may help in this , but not always , and not always predictably . 2 . Genetic algorithms This approach is based on an evolutionary analogy . In this case ‘good’ designs can ‘breed’ new designs . The approach involves representing the design as a sequence of symbols , for example abcdef where a may be a shape property , b a colour property , and so on . Then another de - sign encoded , say , vwxyz could breed with abcde to produce , for exam - ple , the oﬀspring abxzw and vwcde . This new population is then evaluated and the ‘ﬁttest’ go through to breed a new generation of de - signs . Mutation is an important feature of this approach . For example , abxyz might arbitrarily be mutated to give abmyx , with the oﬀspring having properties possessed by neither parent design . This corresponds to a ‘new idea’ of innovation . This approach is attractive because there is evidence that design does indeed follow an evolutionary path follow - ing innovations ( Steadman , 1981 ) . Designers following an evolutionary approach attempt to ﬁnd selection criteria which will eventually match the selection criteria of the market where designs and the reputation of designers literally live or die . 3 . Simulated annealing The idea in simulated annealing is that you jump around the search space rather wildly at ﬁrst , but the jumps become less wild as time goes on . This is done by setting a probability for accepting less good de - signs , and reducing the probability until the search becomes a hill climb . For example , a designer may try something completely new which gives a horrible result . But instead of rejecting it , the designer may make some modiﬁcations which in turn may also be horrible , or may result in some - thing more aesthetically pleasing . This approach is relevant at the gen - eration stage , when novelty is an important consideration . 4 . Neural networks Although neural networks are not strictly speaking a search technique , they are included here because they may be very useful in implementing search and selections . In particular they can learn from examples . Neu - ral networks are input e output devices , and they can be thought of as 34 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 34 / 41 1420 1421 1422 1423 1424 1425 1426 1427 1428 1429 1430 1431 1432 1433 1434 1435 1436 1437 1438 1439 1440 1441 1442 1443 1444 1445 1446 1447 1448 1449 1450 1451 1452 1453 1454 1455 1456 1457 1458 1459 1460 1461 1462 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F pattern - recognisers . To be used the design has to be represented by a se - quence of numbers , perhaps associated with the descriptive features de - ﬁned previously . This is the input to the network . The output could be a number representing a judgement such as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ , but is more likely to be something like ‘good balance’ or ‘good shape’ . Neural net - works oﬀer a bridge between the abstract computational model , and the expert knowledge and judgment of a human designer . Give a partic - ular design , the computer can generate a numerical representation , and the human designers can give an assessment of the goodness / badness of the design on various dimensions . More recently others have used computational methods to search aes - thetic spaces . Kelly ( 2002 ) has used genetic algorithms to search colour space for aesthetically pleasing colour combinations . Glaze ( 1994 ) used a rule - based system to decide that designs were ‘bad’ or ‘not bad’ . The subtlety of this is that violating a single rule can make some designs ab - solutely bad . Designs which do not break any rules are ‘not bad’ with respect to those rules , but not necessarily good with respect to other cri - teria . Often the judgement of ‘good’ depends on interacting criteria which may be very hard to compute . Of course , expert designers break rules deliberately for eﬀect or emphasis , producing better rather than worse designs . 5 Summary discussion Our ﬁndings suggest that the source - to - design transformation process uses a repertoire of relatively few , simple mechanisms for selecting and adapting design elements from inspirational sources . Our simple cognitive accounts are based on a view of designs as elements in combi - nation and conﬁguration . Simple mechanisms may be employed in se - quences or combinations . Complexity in the overall design arises from combination and conﬁguration , so that simple design elements may stand in a complex network of relationships , from which new design properties may emerge . Hence , design expertise requires skill at least (cid:1) in the selection of elements that satisfy the design constraints , and (cid:1) in the construction of appropriate relationships among elements . Design expertise requires the management of the design solution space in accordance with external constraints ( such as those imposed by mar - ket , medium , and manufacture ) and design choices ( which create a con - text of design decisions and may be treated as the self - imposition of Complexity through combination : an account of knitwear design 35 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 35 / 41 1463 1464 1465 1466 1467 1468 1469 1470 1471 1472 1473 1474 1475 1476 1477 1478 1479 1480 1481 1482 1483 1484 1485 1486 1487 1488 1489 1490 1491 1492 1493 1494 1495 1496 1497 1498 1499 1500 1501 1502 1503 1504 1505 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F constraints ) . We speculate that expertise also requires insight into when to strengthen or relax constraints . Under these accounts , the ‘magic’ of design resides in the evaluation heuristics that allow designers to con - strain , search , and reformulate the solution space eﬀectively . (cid:1) In the design of most physical objects , the inspiration is visual , and the transformation of inspiration to design involves spatial reasoning . Design comprises the rapid alternation of the synthesis of designs by juxtaposing and transforming design elements , with analytical critical thinking about resultant relationships , and with the evaluation of the designs according to sets of constraints ( e . g . , Tovey , 1986 ; Lawson , 1990 ) . Producing designs involve combinations of designing sub - tasks and problem - solving sub - tasks ( e . g . , Stauﬀer and Ullman , 1991 ) . The interaction between design constraints , design processes ( such as transformation operations ) , and evaluation ( based on both aesthetic and technical criteria ) is of crucial interest . Previous work has ob - served processes in which quickly - generated conceptual designs are ﬁltered by making rapid evaluations based on aesthetic and technical criteria ( in knitwear design , Eckert and Stacey , 1995 ) ; in architectural design ( Lawson , 1990 ; Scho¨n and Wiggins , 1992 ) . Drawing on our observations of professional knitwear designer behav - iour , we have modelled processes involved in the use of inspirational sources in the design of knitwear motifs or surface patterns . This mod - elling , although simple , implements a variety of aspects of spatial rea - soning and manipulation , including election of design elements from a source ; abstraction and transformation of the selected elements for use in a new design ; combination of selected or transformed elements into new elements ; and context - sensitive placement of elements in an overall design . The use of sources of inspiration can be understood as the identiﬁcation of elements and relationships within the source , the selection for a design purpose , and the re - application of those elements and relationships in a new design context . The ‘disassembly’ of sources may sometimes lead to discovery of latent relational structure not deliberately designed in . 5 . 1 Limitations Of course , the studies reported here have limitations , not least because of the chosen domain of study , knitwear . The very qualities that make knitwear a tractable domain for study also limit the conclusions we can draw from its study . However , the characteristics knitwear shares 36 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 36 / 41 1506 1507 1508 1509 1510 1511 1512 1513 1514 1515 1516 1517 1518 1519 1520 1521 1522 1523 1524 1525 1526 1527 1528 1529 1530 1531 1532 1533 1534 1535 1536 1537 1538 1539 1540 1541 1542 1543 1544 1545 1546 1547 1548 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F with other design domains ( as enumerated in Section 1 ) make it reason - able to generalise with care from these studies , particularly with respect to the issues of uses of sources of inspiration , uses of visual elements , and spatial reasoning . Similarly , various choices in the study designs might well have an impact on the design outcomes . The sources used , although chosen to be rich , representative , and diﬀerent from each other , are a potential limitation . It is conceivable that diﬀerent sources might yield diﬀerent outcome . The use of the simple garment shape , too , may have simpliﬁed the be - haviours . It is possible that a more complex shape might require more complex strategies . We have proposed a simple model and demonstrated reasonably its abil - ity to account for observed design behaviour . However , although plau - sible , it is not necessarily the true or the only account for that behaviour . Its importance lies in exposing the power of the parts - and - relations view , and the associated notion of complexity through combination of simple mechanisms to account for design complexity . The model d and the studies that underpin it d provides a foundation from which we propose some generalisations to be investigated through further studies . 5 . 2 Future work The previous section suggests several ways in which the work could be developed within knitwear design , using diﬀerent sources , diﬀerent tasks , diﬀerent garment shapes . Future work might investigate not just use of visual elements , but feasibility as a knitted garment and how it hangs on a human body . Clearly , it could also be developed in other design domains , where use of sources of inspiration and re - use of design might take diﬀerent forms . But for us the most important direction for further work is evaluation . The simple implementation of the computational model sidesteps the evaluation issue , in part by embodying some design knowledge ( e . g . , the deﬁnitions of the placements , use of a single , ﬁxed shape ) . An imme - diate further step would be to weaken the design knowledge embodied in the implementation , to eliminate implicit and tacit knowledge that has crept into it , and to implement only what is explicitly part of the model . This would force us to expand the computational model to encompass parts of the process which were not yet implemented and to begin to ad - dress evaluation and in particular to articulate and formalise evaluation mechanisms .

In the introduction , we posed three questions which this research has addressed : 1 . What is the nature of sources of inspiration , and how are they used ? We found that designers create and immerse themselves in inspira - tion - rich environments , including a huge variety of diﬀerent types of sources . They use these sources extensively in conceptual design in a wide range of ways from literal adoption through various forms of selection and translation , to essence abstraction . They draw on both parts ( elements of the source ) and structures ( relations between the elements ) . 2 . Is there commonality of behaviour among designers in the early design process with respect to use of sources of inspiration ? We did ﬁnd broad commonality in the use of sources of inspira - tion . The designers we observed all collect , use and share multiple sources of inspiration . They also draw on the repertoire of their own experiences and they discuss design in terms of common rep - ertoires of known solutions . The design process is typically itera - tive and incremental . Designers often focus on one part at a time and make simple decisions . They maintain an awareness of con - text and how each decision changes the design context . Designers use sketching extensively in design . The nature of the sketching activity suggests that it is both expressive and reﬂective . 3 . Are there discernable design ‘sub - processes’ in common use ? Through our sequence of studies we have identiﬁed and analysed some of the constituent behaviours in using sources of inspiration in knitwear design : selecting , adapting , and transforming . We have articulated some of these formally through computational modelling . Through this research , we have oﬀered some simple general accounts of observed design behaviour and have shown how a simple parts - and - re - lations account can explicate aspects of both subtlety and complexity in design . 38 Design Studies Vol - - No . - - Month 2005 ARTICLE IN PRESS JDST405 _ proof (cid:1) 8 October 2005 (cid:1) 38 / 41 1592 1593 1594 1595 1596 1597 1598 1599 1600 1601 1602 1603 1604 1605 1606 1607 1608 1609 1610 1611 1612 1613 1614 1615 1616 1617 1618 1619 1620 1621 1622 1623 1624 1625 1626 1627 1628 1629 1630 1631 1632 1633 1634 UNC O R R E C T E D P R O O F Acknowledgements The project was funded by ESRC Award L127251030 under the title ‘MIND : Mechanisms of Inspiration in Novel Design’ .
