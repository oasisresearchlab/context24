We show here by in vivo fate mapping that brown but not white fat cells arise from precursors that express myf5 , a gene previously thought to be expressed only in the myogenic lineage . Notably , the transcriptional regulator , PRDM16 controls a bidirectional cell fate switch between skeletal myoblasts and brown fat cells . Loss of PRDM16 from brown fat precursors causes a loss of brown fat characteristics and promotes muscle differentiation . Conversely , ectopic expression of PRDM16 in myoblasts induces their differentiation into brown fat cells . PRDM16 stimulates brown adipogenesis by binding to PPAR γ and activating its transcriptional function . Finally , PRDM16 - deficient brown fat displays an abnormal morphology , reduced thermogenic gene expression and elevated expression of muscle - specific genes . Taken together , these data indicate that PRDM16 specifies the brown fat lineage from a progenitor that expresses myoblast markers and is not involved in white adipogenesis .

Adipose tissues contain two distinct types of fat cells , white and brown . White fat cells are specialized for the storage of chemical energy as triglycerides , while brown fat cells dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat1 . Most fat depots can be characterized as either brown or white but some brown fat cells can also be found dispersed throughout white fat depots in rodents and humans2 – 4 .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t patterns of gene expression between the two fat cell types has led most investigators to assume that they share a common developmental origin5 – 7 . Until quite recently , brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) was thought to be of metabolic importance only in smaller mammals and infant humans . Recent studies using PET scanning , however , suggest that adult humans have several discrete areas of metabolically active BAT8 . BAT may thus play a much more important role in human metabolism than was previously appreciated . The manipulation of fat stores is an obvious therapeutic dream , but disruption of the normal differentiation or development of white adipose tissues ( WAT ) causes ectopic lipid storage and severe pathology ( lipodystrophy ) in both humans and experimental animals . Promotion of increased BAT development in humans , however , offers the possibility of increasing energy expenditure without necessarily causing dysfunction in other tissues . Indeed , experimental increases in BAT in animals have been associated with a lean and healthy phenotype4 , 9 – 11 . By contrast , loss of BAT function is linked to obesity and metabolic disease12 . The ability to alter BAT development in a measured way depends upon a thorough understanding of the regulatory systems that control determination in this cell type . Several transcriptional suppressors of BAT development have been identified , including pRB , p107 and RIP14013 – 15 . Positive transcriptional regulators include FOXC29 and PRDM1616 , but only PRDM16 has been shown to determine brown fat cell fate in a cell - autonomous manner . This protein , which contains several zinc fingers and a PR domain , can turn on a full set of BAT - selective genes when expressed in WAT precursors in culture or in vivo , while turning off the expression of several white fat - enriched genes16 , 17 . These actions of PRDM16 are , at least partly , mediated by its interaction with other transcriptional co - regulators , PGC - 1 α and PGC - 1 β and do not require DNA binding of PRDM16 . In this report , we show that PRDM16 can powerfully control a robust , bidirectional switch in cell fate between skeletal myoblasts and brown fat cells . Furthermore , lineage tracing studies in vivo show that depots of BAT but not WAT arise from myf5 - expressing precursors that brown fat shares with skeletal muscle . Results Knockdown of PRDM16 in brown fat cells induces skeletal myogenesis To examine in detail the cellular and molecular consequence of PRDM16 depletion , we used adenoviral vectors to express a sh - SCR ( scrambled ) control or a shRNA targeting PRDM16 in primary brown fat preadipocytes . PRDM16 protein was virtually undetectable in cultures expressing the sh - PRDM16 construct ( Fig . 1a ) . By day 4 of adipogenic differentiation , cultures expressing the scrambled shRNA had undergone normal brown fat cell differentiation ( Fig . 1b ) . In striking contrast , sh - PRDM16 - expressing cultures contained long tube - like cells interspersed amongst fat cells that were strongly marked by GFP which was co - expressed from the adenoviral vector . In fact , the cells that adopted this morphology were those that had preferentially taken - up and expressed the sh - PRDM16 construct ( Fig . 1b ) . Immunohistochemistry using a pan - skeletal myosin heavy chain ( MyHC ) antibody unequivocally identified these cells as skeletal myocytes ( Fig . 1c ) . The myoctes were noted here but not previously16 because these studies achieved a more complete knock - down of PRDM16 ; and because the presence of the GFP gene in the adenoviral vector allowed a more focused examination of the transduced cells . Gene - expression analysis showed that knockdown of PRDM16 completely ablated the expression of brown fat cell - selective genes such as UCP1 , CIDEA and elovl3 / cig30 ( Fig . 1d ) . Moreover , reduction of PRDM16 was associated with a large increase in the expression of myogenic genes , including : myod , myogenin ( myg ) , myosin light chain ( MLC ) , muscle creatine kinase ( MCK ) and MyHC . Knockdown of PRDM16 induced the expression of these genes to between 5 – 25 % of their levels in C2C12 myotubes , a result generally consistent with the MyHC protein expression observed immunocytochemically in approximately 10 – 15 % of the cells in these cultures . These results Seale et al . Page 2 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2008 November 17 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t strongly suggest that PRDM16 functions in brown fat precursors to restrict skeletal muscle gene expression and development . Brown fat and skeletal muscle but not white fat arise from myf5 - expressing progenitors The induction of skeletal muscle in cultures of brown fat preadipocytes suggested a surprising developmental relationship between these two cell lineages . To directly address this question , we performed lineage tracing experiments in mice . Knock - in mice expressing cre recombinase from the regulatory elements of the skeletal muscle - specific myf5 gene18 were crossed with indicator mice that express YFP from the rosa26 gene locus ( R26R3 - YFP ) in a cre - dependent manner . Myf5 is a myogenic regulatory factor that is expressed in committed skeletal myogenic precursors that were previously thought to give rise exclusively to skeletal muscle . Recombination at the rosa26 locus induced by cre recombinase is heritable and irreversible allowing the developmental progression of myf5 - expressing descendents to be traced by YFP expression19 ( Fig . 2a ) . Importantly , these myf5 - cre knock - in mice have been successfully used to drive skeletal muscle - specific cre expression in other studies20 – 22 . To examine the potential contribution of myf5 - expressing progenitors to the adipose anlagen , immunohistochemistry with anti - GFP antibodies was used to localize expression of the YFP reporter gene in skeletal muscle , BAT and WAT from the interscapular region of 2 – 3 month old Myf5 - Cre : R26R3 - YFP mice . In myf5 - cre negative ( control ) mice that harbor the R26R3 - YFP reporter , YFP was not expressed in any tissues ( Fig . 2b ) . However , in myf5 - cre expressing mice , YFP was readily detected in skeletal muscle and BAT but not in WAT . YFP protein was also strongly expressed in the perirenal BAT ( Figure S1 - A ) but not in any classic WAT depots ( not shown ) . Moreover , real - time PCR showed that YFP mRNA was induced only in BAT depots and in skeletal muscle from myf5 - cre expressing mice , and at comparable levels ( Fig . 2c and Fig . S1 - b ) . YFP mRNA expression was not activated in other tissues examined including the gluteal , inguinal and epididymal WAT depots ( Fig . 2c and Fig . S1 - b ) . These results indicate that myf5 - expressing cells specifically gave rise to skeletal muscle and brown fat cells . Notably , myf5 mRNA itself was not detected in mature BAT ( Fig . S1 - c ) , indicating that it was transiently expressed at an earlier developmental stage . In newborn mammals , BAT is apparent at distinct anatomical sites including the interscapular , perirenal and axillary depots . It is also well established that brown fat cells emerge in WAT in response to chronic cold exposure or prolonged β - adrenergic stimulation2 , 4 , 23 . To determine whether these β - adrenergic induced brown fat cells in WAT are also derived from myf5 - expressing precursors , we treated adult myf5 - cre : R26R3 - YFP mice with a selective β 3 - adrenergic agonist , CL 316 , 243 , for 7 days , and examined whether the newly formed brown fat cells expressed YFP . As shown in Fig . 2d , this treatment induced the development of numerous clusters of UCP1 - expressing brown fat cells in epididymal WAT . However , these brown fat cells did not express the YFP reporter gene ( Fig . 2d ) , whereas the interscapular brown fat cells from the same mice were readily marked by YFP expression ( Fig . 2d ) . These results suggest that the brown fat cells that develop in WAT in response to β - adrenergic signaling have an independent developmental origin from the distinct and classic BAT depots that develop before birth . PRDM16 induces brown adipogenesis in C2C12 and primary myogenic cells BAT depots arise from myf5 - expressing cells during development . To investigate whether PRDM16 is sufficient to specify brown fat fate in skeletal myogenic progenitors , we ectopically expressed PRDM16 in the C2C12 myoblast cell line . First , C2C12 myoblasts were transduced with control or PRDM16 - expressing retroviruses , and then exposed to pro - myogenic culture conditions to induce terminal myocyte differentiation . C2C12 cells expressing the control virus differentiated efficiently into multinucleated MyHC - expressing myotubes ( Fig . S2a ) . Seale et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2008 November 17 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t PRDM16 - expressing cells , however , failed to undergo myogenic differentiation ( Fig . S2a ) . Gene expression analysis showed that PRDM16 blocked the induction of myotube - specific genes including : myod , myogenin ( myg ) , mrf4 , MyHC and MCK ( Fig . S2b ) . Control and PRDM16 - expressing C2C12 myoblasts were also stimulated to undergo adipogenesis using adipogenic inducers . Under these conditions , the control cultures differentiated into multinucleated skeletal myotubes , while the PRDM16 - expressing cells uniformly differentiated into lipid filled adipocytes , as shown by Oil - Red - O staining ( Fig . 3a ) . Gene expression studies showed that PRDM16 expression increased the mRNA levels of adipocyte - specific genes , including a 20 - fold increase in PPAR γ and 250 - fold elevation of aP2 / FABP4 , along with decreased levels of myogenic genes such as myod and myg ( Fig . 3b ) . Importantly , adipocytes induced by PRDM16 expression also expressed elevated levels of brown fat cell - specific genes such as elovl3 and CIDEA ( more than 30 , 000 - fold ; Fig . 3c ) , as well as the thermogenic genes UCP1 and PGC - 1 α ( Fig . 3d ) . Moreover , as in real brown fat cells , UCP1 and PGC - 1 α were further induced in PRDM16 - derived adipocytes by elevating cAMP levels through forskolin treatment ( Fig . 3d ) . These data demonstrate that PRDM16 expression alone is sufficient to drive brown adipocyte differentiation in committed and clonal skeletal myogenic cells . To further explore the adipogenic action of PRDM16 , we ectopically expressed PRDM16 in primary mouse myoblasts isolated from postnatal skeletal muscle . As observed in C2C12 cells , control vector ( ctl ) – expressing cells differentiated into multinucleated myotubes in response to an adipogenic induction cocktail . By contrast , PRDM16 - transduced myoblasts differentiated at near 100 % efficiency into fat - storing adipocytes ( Fig . 3e ) . Consistent with their morphological differentiation , PRDM16 - transduced cultures expressed elevated mRNA levels of pan - adipocyte specific genes , such as PPAR γ , aP2 and adiponectin ( Fig . 3f ) . Moreover , adipocytes derived from PRDM16 - expressing myogenic precursors strongly activated the expression of brown fat cell - specific genes including : elovl3 , CIDEA , PGC - 1 α and a 1000 - fold increase in UCP1 levels ( Fig . 3f ) . By western blot analysis , PRDM16 - derived adipocytes expressed the brown fat cell selective UCP1 and CIDEA proteins to levels comparable with that in bona fide brown fat cells ( Fig . 3g ) . Altogether , these results demonstrate that PRDM16 activates a complete program of brown fat cell differentiation in muscle precursor cells . PRDM16 binds to PPAR γ and coactivates its transcriptional function To explore mechanisms that could explain the pro - adipogenic actions of PRDM16 , we used an unbiased approach to identify binding partners of PRDM16 . To this end , the PRDM16 protein complex was immunopurified from fat cells and analyzed by mass spectrometry ( Table S1 ) . Of particular interest was the identification of PPAR γ as a near - stoichiometric component of the PRDM16 complex ( Fig . 4a ) . PPAR γ was the only DNA - binding transcriptional component found in the PRDM16 complex . Independent co - expression assays in COS - 7 cells again showed PPAR γ in a complex with PRDM16 ( Fig . 4b ) . This interaction is likely to be direct , since a full - length GST - PPAR γ 2 fusion protein purified from baculovirus infected insect cells bound to in vitro translated PRDM16 ( Fig . 4c ) . PRDM16 and PPAR γ 2 interacted in a non - ligand dependent manner , since the binding was equivalent with or without the addition of PPAR γ ligand , rosiglitazone , to the binding reaction . Steroid receptor coactivator - 1 ( SRC - 1 ) , by contrast , interacted with purified GST - PPAR γ only in the presence of rosiglitazone ( Fig . 4c ) . Domain mapping experiments using GST immunoaffinity assays identified two regions in PRDM16 that bound to PPAR γ corresponding to zinc - finger - 1 ( ZF1 ) and zinc - finger - 2 ( ZF2 ) ( Fig . 4d ) . PPAR γ is the master regulator of adipogenic differentiation being both absolutely necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis24 – 26 . Furthermore , overexpression and activation of PPAR γ was previously shown to promote adipogenic conversion of myoblasts27 . We therefore Seale et al . Page 4 Nature .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t investigated whether PRDM16 could enhance the transcriptional activity of PPAR γ . As shown in Fig . 4e , the expression of PRDM16 stimulated the activity of a luciferase reporter gene controlled by three tandem repeats of a PPAR binding site ( 3 × DR1 - Luciferase ) by 15 - fold . The reporter gene was further induced by PRDM16 in cells treated for 24 hours with 1 μ M rosiglitazone . In PPAR γ − / − cells , PRDM16 expression induced transcription of the reporter gene only in the presence of exogenously added PPAR γ ( Fig . S3 ) . While the binding of PRDM16 to PPAR γ was not ligand - dependent in vitro , the coactivation function of PRDM16 in cellular assays was augmented by ligand . We also examined whether PRDM16 could interact with PPAR α , a related PPAR family member that is expressed at higher levels in brown versus white fat cells and has been implicated in UCP1 gene regulation28 . In COS - 7 cells , PRDM16 bound to PPAR α with similar efficiency both in the absence and presence of the PPAR α ligand , WY - 14643 ( Wy ) ( Fig . S4a ) . As observed with PPAR γ , PRDM16 also activated the transcriptional function of PPAR α in a ligand - dependent manner ( Fig . S4b ) . These data indicate that PRDM16 can bind and coactivate the transcriptional function of both PPAR α and PPAR γ . The strong coactivation of PPAR γ transcriptional function by PRDM16 suggests that this is a key mechanism by which PRDM16 promotes adipogenesis . In this regard , PRDM16 is unable to promote adipogenesis in PPAR γ - deficient fibroblasts ( data not shown ) . Significantly , the adipogenic conversion of C2C12 ( Fig . S5a ) and primary myoblasts by PRDM16 was largely dependent on the presence of rosiglitazone , a highly specific agonist for PPAR γ . In C2C12 cells , PRDM16 induced the expression of adipocyte - related genes like aP2 and adiponectin as well as brown fat cell - specific markers , UCP1 and CIDEA in a ligand - dependent manner ( Fig . S5b ) . These results indicate that PPAR γ activation is required for the adipogenic function of PRDM16 . We next examined whether expression of any potent coactivator of PPAR γ could induce adipogenesis in C2C12 myoblasts . Interestingly , PGC - 1 β a strong activator of PPAR α and PPAR γ ( 29 and unpublished results ) had no ability to promote adipogenesis or induce adipocyte - specific genes in C2C12 myoblasts ( Fig . S6 ) . It was however , able to induce several mitochondrial gene targets . These data suggest that the coactivation of PPAR γ by PRDM16 is selectively potent in stimulating the adipocyte differentiation program in myogenic cells . Furthermore , PRDM16 was not pro - adipogenic in other non - myogenic cell types , including C3H10T1 / 2 cells , NIH - 3T3 and several types of preadipocytes16 . These data therefore suggest that the pro - adipogenic action of PRDM16 may be somewhat dependent on other factors present in myoblasts . An important question arising from these studies was whether adipocytes derived from myoblasts through PPAR γ function per se would always display a brown fat phenotype . To address this question , we compared the adipogenic activity of ectopically expressed PRDM16 and PPAR γ 2 in C2C12 myoblasts . In these experiments , PRDM16 stimulated adipocyte development with equal , if not better , efficiency as compared to PPAR γ 2 ( Fig . S7a ) . Interestingly , adipocytes formed from PRDM16 - expressing cells had a uniform round shape ; were smaller in size and contained numerous small lipid droplets . PPAR γ - driven adipocytes were larger , irregularly shaped and contained large lipid droplets . Both PRDM16 and PPAR γ 2 induced the expression of pan - adipocyte genes such aP2 and adiponectin ( Fig . S7b ) . However , only PRDM16 induced a complete brown fat differentiation program ( Fig . S7b ) . These data demonstrate that PPAR γ can convert myogenic cells into adipocytes but PRDM16 expression additionally commits cells to the brown fat fate . Seale et al . Page 5 Nature .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Dysregulated gene expression in PRDM16 - deficient brown fat PRDM16 belongs to a family of 16 PR - domain containing proteins , some of which display an overlapping expression pattern with PRDM16 . The effect of global PRDM16 - deficiency on mouse and brown fat development has not been examined . Mice deficient for PRDM16 were created by targeted insertion of a gene - trap cassette into intron 2 of the gene . The creation and general phenotypic characterization of this mouse model will be described elsewhere . Notably , mice homozygous for the gene - trap insertion ( PRDM16 cGT / cGT ) die at birth . We therefore analyzed the phenotype of putative BAT pads from wildtype ( Wt ) , heterozygous carriers and homozygous PRDM16 mutant ( knock - out , KO ) late - stage embryos ( E17 ) . First , we established that PRDM16 mRNA was decreased in heterozygous BAT and virtually undetectable in the putative KO BAT ( Fig . 5a ) . By hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining , the putative BAT from the KO animals had an unusual morphology , including substantially larger lipid stores ( white areas in tissue ) as compared to Wt BAT ( Fig . 5b ) . No obvious muscle tissue was observed in these fat pads . Gene expression studies showed that Wt and KO BAT expressed similar levels of the pan - adipocyte markers aP2 and adiponectin ( Fig . 5c ) . The PRDM16 - deficient BAT , however , expressed significantly lower levels of essentially all BAT cell - selective and thermogenic genes ( Fig . 5d ) . This included a 50 % reduction of UCP1 mRNA levels , 75 % reduction of elovl3 , 50 % reduction of CIDEA and a significant reduction of PGC - 1 α and mitochondrial target genes , cytochrome - c ( cyc ) and cox8b . Strikingly , the PRDM16 - deficient BAT also exhibited large increases in the expression of skeletal myogenic genes including 4 – 6 fold elevated levels of myod , myogenin , MCK and myf6 ( Fig . 5e ) . These data document a genetic requirement for PRDM16 in the appropriate development and gene expression program of BAT . Discussion Most models of fat development have suggested that brown and white fat cells arise from a common adipogenic precursor cell5 – 7 . Given the ability of PRDM16 to drive a complete brown fat gene program16 ; we had thus expected that brown fat cells lacking PRDM16 would adopt a white phenotype . However , very surprisingly , loss of PRDM16 from brown fat cells caused an increase in myogenic gene expression and bona fide skeletal muscle differentiation . Furthermore , this dependence on PRDM16 was bi - directional . Increased PRDM16 expression converted both immortalized and primary skeletal muscle myoblasts into brown fat cells . By tracking the fate of cells that express the myoblast - specific myf5 gene , we provide evidence for a very close developmental relationship between skeletal muscle and BAT . Significantly , our analysis reveals that WAT and BAT depots arise from independent lineages and presumably have fundamentally distinct mechanisms of determination ( Fig . S8 ) . Cells with the morphology and molecular phenotype of brown fat can also be induced in WAT of rodents and humans by chronic cold exposure or by β - adrenergic stimulation2 , 4 , 23 , 30 . In our studies , the brown fat cells that emerged in the WAT of mice treated with a β 3 - adrenergic agonist were not derived from myf5 - expressing precursors . Notably , genetic studies by Kozak and colleagues suggest that brown fat cell formation in WAT versus BAT is controlled by distinct mechanisms31 , which is consistent with the view that these two types of brown fat cells have separate developmental origins . The identity of the cells in WAT that give rise to brown adipocytes remains unknown . It is still reasonable to speculate that a common white / brown fat progenitor exists in some / all WAT depots . The genetic tracing experiments here do not determine whether a single Myf5 + cell gives rise to both BAT and skeletal muscle , or whether separate populations of Myf5 + progenitors exist . However , the interconversion between muscle and BAT induced through modulation of PRDM16 levels in culture suggest that bipotent muscle - brown fat precursors may give rise to both lineages ( Fig . S8 ) . Future studies addressing the exact nature of the muscle - brown fat Seale et al . Page 6 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2008 November 17 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t precursor cell compartment ( s ) are needed . Interestingly , UCP1 - expressing brown adipocytes have been localized in skeletal muscle and are correlated with resistance to obesity32 . Our results suggest that myogenic precursor cells could be the source of these “ectopic” brown fat cells . In this regard , muscle stem cells called satellite cells can undergo adipogenesis under certain experimental conditions33 , 34 ; though whether they assume a brown fat phenotype has not been examined . Some recent experiments had hinted that BAT and muscle share important features . Timmons et al . showed that brown fat cell precursors express a wide array of muscle - related genes35 . Lineage tracing experiments by Atit et al . , revealed that embryonic BAT along with skin and muscle was derived from a population of Engrailed - 1 ( En1 ) expressing cells in the dermomyotome36 . The contribution of En1 - expressing cells to WAT depots was however not studied . En1 is expressed early in mouse development and marks a variety of other cell lineages including specific neuronal pools , thus a direct connection between muscle and BAT was not evident . The ontogenic relationship between BAT and skeletal muscle may explain why brown fat cells are specialized for lipid catabolism rather than storage much like oxidative muscle . Further , BAT and skeletal muscle are both highly responsive to sympathetic nerve activity and have the capacity to perform adaptive thermogenesis . PRDM16 appears to function in brown fat cells via its ability to coregulate the activity of other transcription factors and coactivators ( Fig . S8 ) . The action of PRDM16 is almost certainly dependent on its interaction with PPAR γ since PRDM16 stimulated adipogenesis in a PPAR γ - ligand dependent manner , and PPAR γ is known to be absolutely required for adipogenesis in cultured cells and in vivo 24 , 25 . Our previous study indicated that an important contribution of the ability of PRDM16 to stimulate a brown fat phenotype in white fat precursors was through its association with PGC - 1 α and PGC - 1 β . It seems extremely likely that PRDM16 interacts with other factors , as yet undefined . At a mechanistic level , it remains to be determined how PRDM16 is able to stimulate the function of the PGC - 1s and PPARs . While the siRNA - mediated depletion of PRDM16 from cultured brown fat preadipocytes almost completely ablated their ability to differentiate into brown fat cells , chronic loss of PRDM16 in mice caused a significant but more modest reduction in brown fat cell character . Skeletal muscle gene expression was readily apparent in the KO tissue but no overt muscle fibers were observed . It is likely that one or more of the other 15 PR - domain containing family members can partially compensate for the loss of PRDM16 from BAT in vivo . It will be important to examine whether any of these family members has overlapping functions with PRDM16 . The PRDM16 - deficient mice die at birth , thereby precluding functional analyses of the mutant BAT in response to cold or its effect on energy balance . Tissue - selective ablation of PRDM16 will be required to address these issues . The role of BAT in regulating energy balance and fighting obesity in rodents is well established . Humans have BAT and recent data suggests that it might play a more significant role in the physiology of adult humans than was previously recognized8 . Since PRDM16 can function as a dominant regulator of the brown fat cell fate it will be important to investigate whether it can be used therapeutically . For example , it may be possible to use PRDM16 to drive the formation of brown - fat precursor type cells from myoblast or white fat precursors for autologous transplantation into fat tissues . Alternatively , identifying compounds that induce the expression of PRDM16 in white fat or muscle progenitors could be powerful in fighting obesity . Seale et al . Page 7 Nature .

For adenoviral infection of primary brown fat precursors , 70 % confluent cell cultures were incubated with sh - PRDM16 or sh - SCR – expressing adenovirus ( moi = 100 ) overnight in complete growth medium . The medium was then replaced and cells were maintained in complete growth medium for an additional 24 hours before inducing adipogenic differentiation . Muscle differentiation was induced by culturing cells in 2 % horse - serum / DMEM . To stimulate cAMP - induced thermogenesis in cells , 10 μ M forskolin was added to cultures for 4 hours . Oil - Red - O staining was performed as described previously26 . All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated . Animals All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or in accordance with the University of Ottawa regulations for animal care and handling . CL316 , 243 , at 1 mg / kg was injected intraperitoneally into 8 – 10 week old male mice daily for 7 days ( n = 5 mice per genotype ) . Immunostaining Paraffin embedded sections of brown fat and white fat tissues were subjected to citrate based antigen retrieval ( Vector Labs ) and incubated with anti - rabbit GFP ( Abcam ) or anti - UCP1 ( Abcam ) antibodies for 30 min at room temperature . For fluorescent detection , sections were incubated with Alexa fluor 647 labeled anti - rabbit antibodies ( Invitrogen ) for 30 min and counterstained with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . For horseradish - peroxidase - based detection , samples were processed using the Dako - Envision + system and counterstained with hematoxylin ( Vector Labs ) . Cell cultures were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , followed by permeabilization in 0 . 3 % Triton - X 100 . Fixed cells were incubated with anti - Myosin Heavy Chain ( MF20 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank [ DSHB ] , Iowa ) or anti - Myogenin ( F5D , DSHB ) antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature . Secondary detection was performed with goat anti - mouse Alexa fluor 594 ( Invitrogen ) , and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI . Samples were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope ( Nikon Imaging Center , Harvard Medical School ) . Digital images were acquired by a Haramatsu orca 100 Cooled CCD camera and Metamorph image analysis software ( Molecular Devices ) . Binding studies For affinity purification of the PRDM16 transcriptional complexes , PPAR γ - deficient fibroblasts stably expressing PPAR γ 2 , were infected with vectors expressing Flag - tagged PRDM16 or a control vector . These cells were grown to confluence and induced to differentiate for 4 days . Nuclei were isolated by homogenizing cells in hypotonic solution ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 10 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 ) . Nuclear proteins were extracted in hypertonic solution ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 20 % glycerol ) and dialyzed against binding buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 150 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 20 % glycerol ) . The PRDM16 complex was purified using Flag M2 agarose ( Sigma ) , washed in the binding buffer ( 150 mM KCl ) , and eluted with 3× Flag peptide ( Sigma ) . The eluted materials were separated by SDS - PAGE and visualized by silver staining or coomassie blue dye . Gel - resolved proteins were excised , digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI - reTOF mass spectrometry ( UltraFlex TOF / TOF ; BRUKER ) as described40 . To examine the interaction of PRDM16 with PPAR α and PPAR γ 2 , COS - 7 cells were co - transfected with expression plasmids for PRDM16 and either Flag - PPAR α or Flag - PPAR γ 2 . Whole - cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti - rabbit PRDM16 or anti - Flag M2 ( Sigma ) overnight at 4°C . Immunoprecipitates were washed 3x with washing buffer ( 20 mM Seale et al .

For GST immunoaffinity assays , GST - PRDM16 fusion proteins were purified from bacteria and GST - PPAR γ 2 ( full - length ) was purified from baculovirus infected SF9 cells on glutathione sepharose beads as described before44 . 35 S - labeled and in vitro translated PRDM16 , SRC1 and PPAR γ 2 were prepared using the TNT Coupled Transcription / Translation System ( Promega ) . Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins ( 2 μ g ) were incubated overnight at 4°C with in vitro translated proteins in binding buffer ( 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 7 , 300 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 05 % NP40 , 1 mM DTT , 10 % glycerol ) . The sepharose beads were washed 5× with binding buffer . Bound proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography . Reporter Gene Assays COS - 7 cells or PPAR γ − / − fibroblasts were transfected with 50 ng PPAR γ 2 or PPAR α and 50 ng RXR α or empty vector together with 250 ng PRDM16 expression plasmid or vector control and 100 ng of 3× DR1 - Luciferase reporter in 12 well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual - Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) . Rosiglitazone or WY - 14643 ( 1 μ M ) was added to some wells for 24 hours prior to harvesting cells . Firefly luciferase reporter gene measurements were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity . Expression analysis and western blotting Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells and tissue using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) or RNeasy columns ( Qiagen ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Real - time PCR oligo sequences are provided in Table S2 . For western blot analysis , cells or tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - Cl [ pH 7 . 5 ] ) .
