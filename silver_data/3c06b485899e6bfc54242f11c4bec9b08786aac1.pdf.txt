ADF / Coﬁlin Binds Phosphoinositides in a Multivalent Manner to Act as a PIP 2 - Density Sensor Hongxia Zhao , * Markku Hakala , and Pekka Lappalainen Institute of Biotechnology , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland ABSTRACT Actin - depolymerizing - factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlins have emerged as key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics in cell motility , morphogenesis , endocytosis , and cytokinesis . The activities of ADF / coﬁlins are regulated by membrane phospholipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vitro and in cells , but the mechanism of the ADF / coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction has remained controversial . Recent studies suggested that ADF / coﬁlins interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through a speciﬁc binding pocket , and that this interaction is depen - dent on pH . Here , we combined systematic mutagenesis with biochemical and spectroscopic methods to elucidate the phosphoi - nositide - binding mechanism of ADF / coﬁlins . Our analysis revealed that coﬁlin does not harbor a speciﬁc PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket , but instead interacts with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through a large , positively charged surface of the molecule . Coﬁlin interacts simul - taneously with multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups in a cooperative manner . Consequently , interactions of coﬁlin with membranes and actin exhibit sharp sensitivity to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . Finally , we show that coﬁlin binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is not sensitive to changes in the pH at physiological salt concentration , although the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering activity of coﬁlin is moderately inhibited at elevated pH . Collectively , our data demonstrate that ADF / coﬁlins bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups through a multivalent , cooperative mecha - nism , and suggest that the actin ﬁlament disassembly activity of ADF / coﬁlin can be accurately regulated by small changes in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density at cellular membranes . INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton underlies multiple cell biological processes , such as motility , cytokinesis , endocytosis , phago - cytosis , and intracellular signal transduction . Many human diseases , including cancer and neuronal and cardiovascular diseases , exhibit abnormalities in actin - dependent processes such as cell division and adhesion , as well as in the motile and invasive properties of a cell ( 1 , 2 ) . The structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are regulated both spatially and temporally by a wide array of actin - binding proteins ( 3 , 4 ) . ADF / coﬁlins are among the most central proteins that promote actin dynamics during cell motility ( 5 , 6 ) , cytokinesis ( 7 ) , and endocytosis ( 8 ) . These small ( molecular mass ¼ 15 – 20 kDa ) proteins are present in all eukaryotes and they bind both ﬁlamentous and monomeric actin with high afﬁnity , with a preference for ADP - actin ( 9 – 11 ) . ADF / coﬁlins alter the conformation of actin ﬁla - ments ( 12 ) and increase actin dynamics by accelerating the dissociation of actin monomers from the ﬁlament pointed end ( 13 ) and by severing actin ﬁlaments ( 14 ) . In addition , ADF / coﬁlins accelerate the dissociation of phosphate from ADP - Pi ﬁlaments and promote the debranching of the Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin ﬁlament network ( 15 , 16 ) . The activities of ADF / coﬁlins are tightly regulated by phosphorylation , acidity , and interactions with other proteins and phosphoinositides ( 17 ) . Phosphoinositides are multi - functional lipids that modulate many cellular events , such as membrane trafﬁc , intracellular signaling , cytoskeleton organization , and apoptosis ( 18 , 19 ) . ADF / coﬁlins bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with relatively high afﬁnity , but they do not interact with IP 3 , the inositol head - group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 20 , 21 ) . The actin - binding and F - actin disassembly activities of ADF / coﬁlins are efﬁciently in - hibited by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 both in vitro and in cells ( 20 , 22 , 23 ) . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding of ADF / coﬁlins has also been re - ported to be sensitive to pH ( 24 ) . Despite extensive studies , the molecular mechanism of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - interaction by ADF / coﬁlins has remained contro - versial ( 21 , 24 – 28 ) . Two peptides corresponding to residues D9 - T25 and P26 - V36 at the N - terminus of chick coﬁlin were shown to decrease the ability of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to abrogate coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction , suggesting that these peptides bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 28 ) . Mutagenesis studies on budding yeast and Acanthamoeba ADF / coﬁlins indicated that several different regions of the protein interact with phosphoinositi - des ( 21 , 25 ) . However , in marked contrast to those works , a recent NMR study of vertebrate coﬁlin suggested that the protein binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through a speciﬁc binding pocket and may also interact with the acyl chains of the lipids ( 27 ) . Thus , further studies were necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ADF / coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction and to reveal whether different ADF / coﬁlins bind phosphoi - nositides through conserved or distinct mechanisms . In addition , the mechanism by which ADF / coﬁlins can sense relatively small changes in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration at the plasma membrane in cells , and why these proteins do not interact with IP 3 , remained unknown .

Bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was purchased fromEchelon ( SaltLakeCity , Utah ) . 1 - Palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phos - phatidylcholine ( POPC ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidyleth - anolamine ( POPE ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidylserine ( POPS ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - ( 6 , 7 - dibromo - stearoyl ) phosphatidylcholine ( ( 6 , 7 ) - Br 2 - PC ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - ( 9 , 10 - dibromostearoyl ) phosphatidyl - choline ( ( 9 , 10 ) - Br 2 - PC ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - ( 11 , 12 - dibromostearoyl ) phosphatidylcholine ( ( 11 , 12 ) - Br 2 - PC ) , and L - a - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate were pur - chased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . Pyrenyl - actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc . ( Denver , CO ) . Protein puriﬁcation Wild - type and mutant mouse coﬁlin - 1 were expressed as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - fusion proteins and were enriched using glutathione agarose beads as described previously ( 29 ) . GST was cleaved with thrombin ( 10 U / mL ) , and coﬁlins were puriﬁed with a Superdex - 75 gel ﬁltration column ( Pharmacia Biotech ) . Circular dichroism measurements Ultravioletcirculardichroismspectrafrom250to190nmwererecordedwith a JASCO J - 810 instrument . The spectra were measured using a 0 . 1 - cm path length quartz cell . The coﬁlin - 1 concentration was 10 m M in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 . The data are presented as the averages of ﬁve scans . Vesicle cosedimentation assay Lipids in desired concentrations were mixed and then dried under a stream of nitrogen , and the lipid residue was subsequently maintained under reduced pressure for at least 4 h . The dry lipids were then hydrated in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl to obtain multilamellar vesicles . To obtain unilamel - lar vesicles , vesicles were extruded through a polycarbonate ﬁlter ( 100 - nm pore size ) using a mini extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . Proteins and lipo - somes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 100 , 000 rpm with a Beckman rotor ( TLA 100 ) for 1 h . The ﬁnal concentra - tions of coﬁlin and liposomes were 2 m M and 500 m M , respectively , in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 buffer ( with or without 100 mM NaCl ) . Equal propor - tions of supernatants and pellets were loaded for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and after electrophoresis the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue . The intensities of the coﬁlin bands were quan - tiﬁed with the use of the Quantity One program ( Bio - Rad ) . F - actin binding assays Pyrene - labeled actin ( 20 m M ) was polymerized for 30 min in F - buffer ( 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and 100 mM KCl ) . After polymerization the actin ﬁl - ments were diluted at 1 m M in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 , for ﬂuorescence measurements . Liposomes with different PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - densities ( buffer alone was used as control ) were incubated with coﬁlin for 10 min before they were added to the actin ﬁlament solution . The excitation and emission wavelengths for pyrene were 365 and 406 nm , respectively . Both the excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 10 nm . An F - actin cosedimentation assay was carried out using rabbit muscle actin as described previously ( 21 ) . Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments All ﬂuorescence measurements were performed in quartz cuvettes ( 3 - mm path length ) with a Perkin - Elmer LS 55 spectrometer . Emission and excita - tion band passes were set at 10 nm . Fluorescence anisotropy for DPH was measured with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm . Tryptophan ( Trp ) ﬂuorescence was excited at 290 nm , and the emission spectra were re - corded by averaging ﬁve spectra from 310 to 420 nm upon addition of different concentrations of liposomes . Spectra were corrected for the contri - bution of light scattering in the presence of vesicles . Bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ﬂuorescence was excited at 547 nm and the emission spectra were recorded from 555 to 600 nm in the presence of different concentrations of coﬁlin - 1 . Data were analyzed as described by Ward ( 30 ) . The apparent dissociation constant , K d , was calculated by the following equation : D F ¼ D F max (cid:2) ½ PIP 2 (cid:3) T K d þ ½ PIP 2 (cid:3) T where D F is the ﬂuorescence quenching at a given PIP 2 concentration , D F max is the total ﬂuorescence quenching of coﬁlin - 1 saturated with PIP 2 , and [ PIP 2 ] T is the total accessible concentration of PIP 2 . D F max is estimated by curve - ﬁtting the binding data using the Hyperbol . ﬁt program in Microcal Origin . The stoichiometry of binding , p , was derived according to Stinson and Holbrook ( 31 ) . For the acrylamide quenching assay , Trp was excited at 295 nm and the data were analyzed according to the Stern - Volmer equation ( 32 ) , F 0 / F ¼ 1 þ K sv [ Q ] , where F 0 and F represent the ﬂuorescence intensities in the absence and the presence of the quencher ( Q ) , respectively , and K sv is the Stern - Volmer quenching constant , which is a measure of the accessibility of Trp to acrylamide . Collisional quenching of Trp by brominated phospho - lipids ( Br 2 - PCs ) was introduced to assess the localization of this residue in the bilayer ( 33 ) . RESULTS Binding of coﬁlin to membranes is dependent on the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - density Coﬁlin - 1 is the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed ADF / coﬁlin in mammals , and the corresponding isoform has been widely used to investigate interactions between ADF / coﬁlins and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 23 , 27 ) . In this work , vesicle co - sedimentation and ﬂuorometric assays were applied to assess the binding of mouse coﬁlin - 1 to lipid membranes . The only Trp of mouse coﬁlin - 1 ( Trp - 104 ) locates at the hydrophobic core of the protein ( 34 ) . Our data show that upon PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding , this residue is exposed to a more hydrophilic envi - ronment , which causes its ﬂuorescence emission to decrease ( Fig . S1 in the Supporting Material ) . Quenching of Trp ﬂuo - rescence thus provides a tool for examining the coﬁlin - 1 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction by a ﬂuorometric method . Both vesicle cosedimentation and Trp ﬂuorescence assays showed weak binding of coﬁlin - 1 to vesicles containing only PC / PE / PS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) . However , in the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the binding of coﬁlin - 1 to membranes was signiﬁcantly enhanced ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . The afﬁnity ( K d ) of coﬁlin for 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane was ~ 4 m M , as calculated from Trp ﬂuorescence assay ( see Fig . 3 A ) . Cosedimentation and ﬂuorometric assays carried out using vesicles with different PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 densities ( 0 – 20 % ) revealed that coﬁlin binding is sensitive to the spatial PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density in the membrane ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density - dependent binding curve showed a typical sigmoidal shape indicative of cooperative binding . The half - maximal binding in both vesicle cosedimentation and ﬂuorometric Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2327 – 2336 2328 Zhao et al . binding assays was observed at ~ 6 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Of note , the F - actin binding activity of coﬁlin - 1 , as detected by steady - state quenching of pyrenyl - actin ﬂuores - cence by coﬁlin - 1 , also displayed a similar dependence on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density ( Fig . 1 C ) . The inhibition curve was sigmoidal , showing a sharp threshold between 4 % and 9 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Thus , interaction of coﬁlin - 1 with membranes and inhibition of its F - actin binding activity are dependent on the spatial PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density in the membrane . Coﬁlin clusters PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules at the membrane surface Because the interaction of coﬁlin with membranes is depen - dent on the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density , we next investigated whether coﬁlin could simultaneously bind multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mole - cules in the membrane . For this purpose , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 labeled with bodipy - TMR at the sn - 1 position of the acyl chains was applied for a ﬂuorometric PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering assay . This ﬂuorescent probe has highly superimposable absorption and emission spectra , and exhibits self - quenching properties when two or more molecules are brought together in close proximity . We experimentally tested whether coﬁlin - 1 could induce self - quenching of bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 when the ﬂuorescent lipid was incorporated into the vesicles at a concentration below the level at which self - quenching occurs without proteins ( 35 ) . Of importance , strong quench - ing of bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ﬂuorescence was detected upon coﬁlin binding , indicating an increased proximity of neighboring bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules sequestered by coﬁlin - 1 ( Fig . 2 A ) . The degree of bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ﬂuorescence quenching was similar to that previ - ously reported for I - BAR domains , which are efﬁcient PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering molecules ( 36 ) . The stoichiometry of the binding derived from the graph indicates that ~ 2 , 6 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules are bound per one coﬁlin molecule . Therefore , this assay demonstrates that coﬁlin simultaneously binds multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules and induces their clus - tering in the membrane . Coﬁlin - 1 interacts with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through electrostatic interactions and does not insert into the lipid bilayer When the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering assay was carried out at different NaCl concentrations , we noticed that the lateral sequestration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 decreased as the salt concentration A B C FIGURE 1 Coﬁlin - 1 is a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - density sensor . ( A ) A vesicle cosedi - mentation assay shows that the binding of coﬁlin - 1 to membranes is depen - dent on the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . The sigmoidal binding isotherm demonstrates that coﬁlin - 1 binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cooperatively when the density of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane is augmented . POPE and POPS were included at 20 % . PIP 2 was included at 0 % , 2 % , 4 % , 6 % , 8 % , 10 % , and 20 % , and the POPC concentration was varied accordingly . For 0 % PIP 2 , vesicles composed of POPC / POPE / POPS ( 6 : 2 : 2 ) were used . The ﬁnal concentrations of coﬁlin - 1 and liposomes were 2 m M and 500 m M , respectively , in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 buffer . Each data point represents the mean of triplicate measure - ments , with the error bars indicating 5 SD . ( B ) Membrane binding of coﬁ - lin - 1 was also examined by quenching of Trp ﬂuorescence . The percentage of quenching shows a sigmoidal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding isotherm , revealing that coﬁlin - 1 binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cooperatively and that the interaction is dependent on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . The coﬁlin - 1 concentration was 1 m M in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 , and total lipid concentration was 140 m M . Lipid composition was as described in panel A . ( C ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibits the binding of coﬁlin - 1 to actin ﬁlaments , and inhibition is PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - density dependent . Pyrene - labeled actin ( 20 m M ) was polymerized for 30 min in F - buffer ( 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and 100 mM KCl ) . The actin ﬁlaments were diluted to 1 m M in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 , for ﬂuores - cence measurements . Liposomes with different PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 densities ( buffer alone was used as control ) were incubated with coﬁlin - 1 for 10 min before addition of the actin ﬁlament solution . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was quenched upon coﬁlin - 1 binding to actin ﬁlaments . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 containing lipsomes in - hibited the binding of coﬁlin - 1 to actin ﬁlaments , as detected by the decreased quenching of pyrene ﬂuorescence . The ﬁnal coﬁlin - 1 concentra - tion in the assay was 0 . 2 m M . Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2327 – 2336 Interaction of ADF / Coﬁlin with PIP2 2329 was increased ( Fig . 2 A ) . We further examined the salt sensitivity of the coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction by vesicle co - sedimentation and ﬂuorometric binding assays . The results revealed that the coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction is indeed salt - sensitive ( Figs . 2 , A and B , and 3 A ) . These data indicate that the interaction between coﬁlin and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes is mediated by electrostatic interactions . However , a previous study suggested that coﬁlin may penetrate into the lipid bilayer upon PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ( 27 ) . To examine whether coﬁlin - 1 is capable of inserting into the membrane bilayer , we monitored the steady - state ﬂuores - cence anisotropy of a membrane probe , DPH . DPH locates at the hydrophobic core of a lipid bilayer without affecting the physical properties of the membranes . It can thus be applied to monitor changes in the rotational diffusion of acyl chains in the membrane interior ( 37 ) . In contrast to the I - BAR domain of missing - in - metastasis protein , which inserts into the lipid bilayer ( 36 ) , coﬁlin - 1 did not induce detectable changes in the DPH anisotropy ( Fig . 2 C ) . We further inves - tigated membrane insertion of coﬁlin - 1 by quenching Trp ﬂuorescence using lipids that are brominated at different positions along the lipid acyl chains and can thus be used to estimate the depth of Trp insertion into the bilayer ( 36 ) . Consistent with the DPH anisotropy data , no further ﬂuores - cence quenching of Trp - 104 was observed by means of the brominated lipids ( Fig . 2 D ) . Together , these data provide evidence that coﬁlin - 1 binds solely PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups at the membrane surface without inserting into the hydro - phobic core of the lipid bilayer . The microenvironment of Trp - 104 of coﬁlin - 1 became more hydrophilic upon PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding because its ﬂuores - cence was signiﬁcantly quenched ( Fig . 3 A ) . We further examined the change in the microenvironment of Trp - 104 due to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by performing assays with an aqueous quencher acrylamide . Collisional quenching of Trp ﬂuorescence by acrylamide provides information con - cerning the accessibility of Trp to this quencher ( 38 ) . Maximum quenching occurs when Trp is freely accessible to the quencher . However , when Trp is protected by ligand binding , ﬂuorescence quenching by acrylamide is expected to decrease . The Trp ﬂuorescence intensity was quenched by acrylamide in a concentration - dependent manner in the absence and presence of liposomes ( Fig . 3 B ) . Of interest , the value for K sv was signiﬁcantly smaller in the presence of liposomes ( K sv ¼ 0 . 69 vs . K sv ¼ 2 . 3 in the absence of lipo - somes ) , suggesting that Trp - 104 was protected by membrane A B C D FIGURE 2 Coﬁlin simultaneously binds multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules on the membrane surface and does not insert into the lipid bilayer . ( A ) Quench - ing of bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 demon - strates that coﬁlin - 1 sequesters PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the membrane , and this activity is salt - sensitive . The lipid com - position in this assay was POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 / bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 50 : 20 : 20 : 9 . 5 : 0 . 5 ) and the total lipid concentration was 40 m M . Salt inhibits PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering by coﬁlin - 1 , sug - gesting electrostatic interactions be - tween coﬁlin - 1 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . ( B ) A vesicle cosedimentation assay reveals that the coﬁlin - 1 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction is inhibited in the presence of high salt , indicative of electrostatic interac - tions between coﬁlin - 1 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The assay was carried out under the same conditions ( excluding the varia - tion in the salt concentration ) as in Fig . 1 A . Each data point represents the mean of three independent assays , with the error bars indicating 5 SD . A t - test was used to analyze p - values ( * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 01 ) . ( C ) Coﬁ - lin - 1 does not display detectable effects on DPH anisotropy , suggesting that co - ﬁlin - 1 does not insert into the lipid bilayer upon membrane binding . The I - BAR domain of missing - in - metastasis protein ( 36 ) was used as a positive control in this assay . The lipid composition in the assay was POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 5 : 2 : 2 : 1 , DPH is incorporated into liposomes at a molar ratio of 1 : 500 ) and the total lipid concentration was 40 m M . The assay was carried out in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 . ( D ) Trp ﬂuorescence of coﬁlin - 1 is not affected by lipids that are brominated at different positions along the acyl chains , indicating that coﬁlin - 1 does not interact with the acyl chains of the lipids . The lipid composition in this assay was POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 / brominated phosphatidylcholine ( 2 : 2 : 2 : 1 : 3 ) . The coﬁlin - 1 concentration was 1 m M . Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2327 – 2336 2330 Zhao et al . binding and became less accessible to the aqueous quencher . Together , these data suggest that Trp - 104 is located at the bilayer interface close to the polar PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups when coﬁlin - 1 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes . Identiﬁcation of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site of coﬁlin - 1 Several techniques , including NMR and native gel electro - phoresis , have been applied to map the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site of ADF / coﬁlins . However , both methods have technical limitations , which may explain the discrepancies in the results . The NMR chemical shift experiments were carried out with water - soluble di - C 8 forms of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , whereas the native gel electrophoresis assays were performed under nonphysiological ionic conditions ( 21 , 27 ) . To unambigu - ously identify the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site of ADF / coﬁlins , we carried out a systematic mutagenesis of mouse coﬁlin - 1 combined with cosedimentation and ﬂuorometric PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering assays . Because our analysis demonstrated that the interaction between coﬁlin - 1 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is mainly electro - static , we mutated nine positively charged clusters of mouse coﬁlin - 1 to alanines and glutamates , and all of the mutants were properly folded ( Fig . 4 and Fig . S2 ) . The data revealed that the positively charged clusters K95 , K96 ; K112 , K114 ; and K125 , K126 , K127 of coﬁlin - 1 are most critical for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding ( Fig . 5 , A and C ) , because substituting these residues with either alanines or glutamates resulted in statistically signiﬁcant defects in the vesicle cosedimentation assay ( Fig . 5 , A and C ) . In addition , residues K132 , H133 and K144 , R146 appear also to be located at the binding interface , because substitution of these residues by gluta - mates signiﬁcantly reduced binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich vesi - cles ( Fig . 5 C ) . However , substitution of K132 , H133 and K144 , R146 clusters by alanines resulted in only small defects in the vesicle cosedimentation assay , and these were not statistically signiﬁcant . This suggests that K132 , H133 and K144 , R146 make only a minor contribution to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ( Fig . 5 A ) . Of importance , the bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 quenching assay demonstrated that the same residues that have a central role in PIP 2 binding also play an important role in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering ( Fig . 5 , B and D ) . Together , these data show that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site of mouse coﬁlin - 1 is a large , positively charged surface located on one face of the molecule ( Fig . 6 A ) . Modulation of coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction by pH It was recently reported that phosphoinositide binding of ADF / coﬁlin is pH - sensitive , with diminished binding at a high pH . His - 133 , which is located at the previously proposed PIP 2 - binding pocket of coﬁlin , was shown to play a central role in the pH sensitivity of phosphoinositide binding by coﬁlin ( 24 ) . Because our data revealed that ADF / coﬁlins do not contain a speciﬁc phosphoinositide - binding pocket , but instead interact with multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups through a large , positively charged interface ( see above ) , we reexamined the pH dependency of phosphoi - nositide binding by ADF / coﬁlins . Both the Trp ﬂuorescence and vesicle cosedimentation assays revealed that at physio - logical ionic conditions , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding of wild - type coﬁ - lin or a coﬁlin mutant ( K132A , H133A ) were not affected by changes in the pH ( Fig . 7 , A and B , and Fig . S3 ) . However , in the absence of NaCl , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding was pH - sensitive for wild - type coﬁlin and to a somewhat lesser extent for the K132A , H133A mutant ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) . Although no pH sensitivity was detected for coﬁlin binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by Trp ﬂuorescence quenching or vesicle cosedimentation assays at physiological salt , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering activity of wild - type coﬁlin displayed a clear defect at elevated pH ( Fig . 8 A ) . At identical conditions , the K132A , H133A mutant showed no pH dependency in its ability to cluster PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 8 B ) , suggesting that His - 133 indeed contrib - utes to the pH sensitivity of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering activity of coﬁlin - 1 .

( A ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding quenches the Trp ﬂuo - rescence of coﬁlin - 1 , suggesting that the environment of Trp - 104 is altered due to the binding . Salt inhibits the coﬁlin - 1 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction , as de - tected by the decreased quenching of Trp ﬂuorescence .

Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2327 – 2336 Interaction of ADF / Coﬁlin with PIP2 2331 DISCUSSION By applying a combination of biochemical , biophysical , and mutagenesis methods , we were able to reveal several new important aspects concerning the mechanism by which ADF / coﬁlin family proteins bind to and are regulated by phosphoinositides . We found that 1 ) , ADF / coﬁlins simulta - neously bind multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups in a cooperative manner ; 2 ) , ADF / coﬁlins act as sensors of spatial PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density at the membrane ; 3 ) , ADF / coﬁlins do not interact with the acyl chains of lipids or insert into the membrane bilayer ; 4 ) , ADF / coﬁlins do not contain a speciﬁc phosphoi - nositide - binding pocket , but instead interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups by unspeciﬁc electrostatic interactions through a large , positively charged interface of the protein ; and 5 ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering activity of ADF / coﬁlins is diminished at elevated pH . Our work reveals a large , positively charged interface of coﬁlin that simultaneously interacts with multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups , and thus provides an explanation for earlier A C D B FIGURE 5 Determination of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site of coﬁlin - 1 . ( A ) Vesicle cosedimen - tation assay for examining the effects of various coﬁlin - 1 mutants ( alanine substitution ) on its PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding activity . This assay suggests that the positively charged clusters K95 , K96 ; K112 , K114 ; and K125 , K126 , K127 play important roles in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by coﬁ - lin - 1 . The assay was carried out under the same conditions described in Fig . 1 A . Each data point represents the mean value of three measurements , with the error bars indicating 5 SD . A t - test was applied to analyze p - values ( * * p < 0 . 01 ) . ( B ) A bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 quenching experiment to examine the effects of various coﬁlin - 1 mutants ( alanine substitu - tion ) for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering . This assay re - vealed the importance of the three positively charged clusters ( K95 , K96 ; K112 , K114 ; and K125 , K126 , K127 ) in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interactions with coﬁlin - 1 . The lipid composition in the assay was POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 5 : 2 : 2 : 1 ) and the total lipid concentration was 40 m M . Each data point represents the mean of triplicate measurements . ( C ) The vesicle cosedimentation assay with coﬁlin - 1 mutants ( glutamate substi - tution ) suggests that K95 , K96 ; K112 , K114 ; and K125 , K126 , K127 are the most critical residues in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . Each data point represents the mean of triplicate measurements , with the error bars indicating 5 SD . A t - test was applied to analyze p - values ( * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 , 01 , * p < 0 , 05 ) . ( D ) In similarity to the vesicle cosedimentation assay , the bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 quenching experiment with coﬁlin - 1 mutants ( glutamate substitution ) also revealed the importance of the same positively charged clusters ( K95 , K96 ; K112 , K114 ; and K125 , K126K , 127 ) on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . Each data point represents the mean of triplicate measurements . FIGURE 4 Multiple sequence alignment of selected ADF / coﬁlins . The residues mutated in mouse coﬁlin - 1 in this study are indicated by lines above the sequences . The mutated residues that displayed severe ( red ) or moderate ( yellow ) defects in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding assays are high - lighted . The conserved Trp , Trp - 104 , is also highlighted ( black ) . Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2327 – 2336 2332 Zhao et al . studies demonstrating that ADF / coﬁlins do not bind IP 3 with detectable afﬁnity ( 20 , 21 ) . Because coﬁlin binding to membranes displays a sharp sensitivity to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density , coﬁlin is not expected to bind soluble IP 3 molecules that are not aligned into lateral clusters . Of importance , as previously proposed for N - WASP ( 39 ) , ADF / coﬁlins can function as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - density sensors at the plasma membrane . Thus , our work provides a biochemical explanation for the results of previous cell biology studies in which a relatively small decrease in the plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration upon EGF stimulation efﬁciently activated ADF / coﬁlin in carcinoma cells ( 22 ) . It is also important to note that the binding threshold of coﬁlin occurs at 3 – 8 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which is similar to that reported recently for N - WASP and close to the estimated physiological PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density at the plasma membrane ( 39 , 40 ) . Thus , ADF / coﬁlins bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head - groups in a multivalent manner and sense the density of phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane . Therefore , the F - actin disassembly activity of ADF / coﬁlins can be efﬁ - ciently regulated by small changes in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concen - tration or spatial distribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane . Our mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site of coﬁlin - 1 overlaps extensively with both G - actin and F - actin binding sites of ADF / coﬁlin ( 17 , 41 ) ( see also Fig . S4 ) , which explains why the actin - binding activities of ADF / coﬁlins are inhibited by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 6 ) . However , in contrast to the previous NMR study performed with water - soluble di - C 8 forms of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 27 ) , our work revealed no speciﬁc PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket ( s ) in coﬁlin - 1 . Although neutralization of the three positively charged clusters signiﬁcantly decreased the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding and - clustering afﬁnities of coﬁlin - 1 , none of the mutants completely abolished PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . The lack of speciﬁc phosphoinositide - binding pocket in ADF / coﬁlins also explains the lack of phosphoinositide speciﬁcity in this family of actin - binding proteins . It is important to note that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding residues identi - ﬁed here for mouse coﬁlin - 1 are relatively well conserved in all eukaryotic ADF / coﬁlins , and that all ADF / coﬁlins contain a similar positively charged interface that is also crit - ical for actin binding ( Figs . 4 and 6 ) . Furthermore , a similar positively charged interface in yeast coﬁlin was previously suggested to contribute to phosphoinositide binding ( 21 ) . Therefore , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding mechanism identiﬁed here for mouse coﬁlin - 1 likely represents a general PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding mechanism of all ADF / coﬁlins . In our Trp ﬂuorescence and vesicle cosedimentation anal - yses , the coﬁlin - 1 interaction with membranes did not display a detectable pH dependency at physiological salt concentra - tion , although PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering was inhibited at elevated pH ( Figs . 7 and 8 , and Fig . S3 ) . Thus , it is possible that the previously reported pH sensitivity of the coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction is detectable only at nonphysiological low - salt conditions . It is also important to note that a mutation in the previously identiﬁed pH - sensor residue H133 ( 24 ) resulted only in relatively small defects in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding and clus - tering . Thus , H133 and its neighboring residues do not form A B C FIGURE 6 A schematic model for the interaction of coﬁlin with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes .

Residues that are critical for interaction with F - actin , but not G - actin , are in cyan ( 42 – 44 ) . The view on the right represents a 90 (cid:4) clockwise rotation around the long axis of the protein . ( C ) A schematic model for the interaction of coﬁlin - 1 with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes . The residues that are critical for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binding are indicated in red and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups are indicated in blue . Trp - 104 is indicated in magenta . Coﬁlin - 1 simultaneously binds multiple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroups through its large , positively charged inter - face , and thus induces clustering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the membrane . Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2327 – 2336 Interaction of ADF / Coﬁlin with PIP2 2333 an important PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket as previously proposed ( 27 ) . Furthermore , the corresponding histidine is not conserved in invertebrate , plant , or yeast ADF / coﬁlins . Thus , protonation - deprotonation of H133 is unlikely to have a general role in regulating ADF / coﬁlin - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inter - actions in cells . Taken together , our results show that ADF / coﬁlins can act as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - density sensors that bind and stabilize PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6 C ) . Because the large , positively charged phosphoinositide - binding site over - laps with the G - actin / F - actin binding sites of ADF / coﬁlins , the activity of these proteins is inhibited at PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes . Thus , a relatively small increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density at the plasma membrane can signiﬁcantly inhibit ADF / coﬁlin - induced ﬁlament severing and depolymeriza - tion . Furthermore , an increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density will lead to the activation of N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 - promoted actin ﬁlament assembly ( 39 ) . These biochemical results are in agreement with recent ﬁndings that an increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration at the plasma membrane promotes actin ﬁlament assembly in mammalian cells ( 45 , 46 ) . It is important to note that the binding of ADF / coﬁlins to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes appears to be transient , and their dissociation from the membranes can be further facilitated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis ( 22 , 23 ) . Therefore , unspeciﬁc , multivalent electrostatic interactions of ADF / coﬁlins with phosphoinositide - rich membranes appear to be ideally suited for down - regulating the activity of this protein .

( A and B ) The bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 quenching assay reveals that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering by wild - type coﬁlin - 1 ( A ) displays moderate pH sensitivity , whereas the K132A , H133A mutant ( B ) shows no detectable pH sensitivity at physiological ion strength . The ﬁnal concentration of liposomes was 40 m M in a total reaction volume of 100 m L in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 .

The K132A , H133A mutant showed no pH dependency in its ability to cluster PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , suggesting that His - 133 indeed contributes to the pH sensitivity of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering activity of coﬁlin - 1 .
