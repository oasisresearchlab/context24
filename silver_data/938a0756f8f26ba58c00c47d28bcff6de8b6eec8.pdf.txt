Pollard , 2 Dorit Hanein 1 * The seven - subunit Arp2 / 3 complex choreographs the formation of branched actin networks at the leading edge of migrating cells . When activated by Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex initiates actin (cid:222)lament branches from the sides of existing (cid:222)laments . Electron cryomicroscopy and three - dimensional reconstruction of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Sac - charomyces cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complexes bound to the WASp carboxy - terminal domain reveal asymmetric , oblate ellipsoids . Image analysis of actin branches indicates that the complex binds the side of the mother (cid:222)lament , and Arp2 and Arp3 ( for actin - related protein ) are the (cid:222)rst two subunits of the daughter (cid:222)lament . Comparison to the actin - free , WASp - activated complexes suggests that branch initiation involves large - scale structural rearrangements within Arp2 / 3 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is the cellular factor that generates new filaments in a site - directed , signal - controlled fashion at the leading edge of motile cells ( 1 ) and forms identical branch - es in vitro ( 2 ) . The complex binds the sides and slow - growing ( pointed ) ends of actin filaments ( 3 ) . The dendritic actin networks generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex have been thought to be critical for producing the force that drives lamellipodia protrusion . Con - served among eukaryotes , this seven - subunit complex consists of two actin - related pro - teins , Arp2 and Arp3 , and five novel proteins . Structural models of the Arps ( 4 ) suggested that the complex provides a nucleation site for a new actin filament . The COOH - terminal region of WASp family members containing the WASp homology 2 ( W ) and acidic ( A ) domains , together with preassembled actin filaments , activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , thus promoting barbed ( fast - growing ) end nucle - ation of new ( daughter ) filaments ( 5 â€“ 8 ) . Elec - tron microscopy , chemical cross - linking , yeast genetics , sedimentation , and hydrody - namic modeling provided evidence for the organization of the complex and identified subunits that interact with actin , WA , and profilin [ reviewed in ( 9 ) ] . Crystallography has not yet provided direct information on the structure of the complex . We used electron cryomicroscopy and single - particle analysis to obtain the structure of WA - bound Arp2 / 3 complex at 3 . 2 nm resolution . Im - age analysis of actin filament branches formed by the Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that the Arps form the first two subunits in the daughter filament . A large conforma - tional change , involving one of the Arps and at least one small subunit , appears to occur during branch formation . Unstained , fully hydrated Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex bound to the WA domain of Scar , a WASp - like protein , was imaged in vitrified buffer ( Fig . 1A ) ( 10 ) . Three indepen - dent three - dimensional ( 3D ) reconstructions were calculated ( 11 ) , and the high similarity among these reconstructions ( . 92 % correla - tion ) verified the reliability of the structure . The 0 . 5 Fourier shell correlation criterion ( 12 ) indicates a resolution of 3 . 2 nm ( Fig . 1C ) . Gold labeling was used to localize the NH 2 - terminus of WA within the reconstruc - tion ( 13 ) . Single - particle analysis of Acan - thamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex without the WA domain bound did not converge to a consis - tent 3D reconstruction . It is conceivable that the WA domain stabilizes the free complex and locks it into a narrow range of conforma - tions . Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 com - plex bound to the WA domain of yeast Bee1 , a member of the WASp family , was imaged in uranyl acetate stain after air - drying ( Fig . 1A ) ( 14 ) . Processing of this yeast data set converged to a 3D reconstruction similar to the Acanthamoeba structure ( Fig . 1D ) . The Fourier shell correlation indicates a resolu - tion of about 3 . 9 nm for the yeast reconstruc - tion ( Fig . 1C ) . The correlation between the yeast and the Acanthamoeba structures at 3 . 9 nm resolution is 90 % . Thus , at this resolu - tion , the complexes are nearly identical as anticipated from the conserved sequences of their subunits . When contoured at a threshold containing 100 % of the molecular mass ( 220 kD ) , WA - bound Arp2 / 3 complexes are oblate ellipsoids with dimensions of 13 nm by 9 nm by 5 nm ( Fig . 1D ) . Contouring at a higher threshold reveals a region of lower density between two large lobes , giving the reconstructions a horseshoe shape . This is similar to images of shadowed complexes , which indicate a cleft between two domains of the complex ( 2 , 15 ) . Electron cryomicroscopy was used to im - age frozen - hydrated actin filament branches produced by Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex activated by Scar - WA ( 16 ) . Individual actin monomers and extra density at branch sites were clearly visible in filtered images ( Fig . 2A ) . From the unfiltered images , 167 branch - es were selected and used to generate a two - dimensional ( 2D ) image of the projection view . This 2D reconstruction clearly reveals subunits in both actin filaments ( Fig . 2B ) and is fully compatible with quick - frozen , deep - etched , rotary - shadowed samples of the same preparation ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Fourier - space analysis suggests a resolution of ; 2 . 8 nm for the branch reconstruction . Myosin decoration of the branches formed by the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of Bee1 - WA ( 17 ) verified that the pointed ends of both fila - ments are directed toward the branch ( Fig . 2E ) , as they are in extracted cells ( 18 ) . This confirms that Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin filaments that grow at their barbed ends ( 2 ) . In the 2D reconstruction , the mother filament continues unaffected through the branch , and an analysis of the diffraction pattern of the mother filament alone shows an undisturbed helical actin symmetry . These two findings indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is not in - serted into the mother filament . The helical structure of the daughter filament starts about 6 nm from the side of the mother filament . Three bridges of density connect the pointed end of the daughter filament to three actin subunits in the mother filament . The density distribution in the connecting region indicates a thickness of about 5 nm . The quick - frozen , shadowed samples provide evidence that the contact occurs slightly out of plane ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . The helical symmetry of actin filaments and their defined polarity allowed us to fit atomic models of actin ( 19 ) unambiguously into the 2D reconstruction of both the mother and daughter filaments ( Fig . 3A ) . If one as - sumes that all of the subunits of the mother and daughter filaments are actin , the remain - ing projection density at the branch junction is insufficient to accommodate the entire Arp2 / 3 complex . On the other hand , if two of the filament subunits are Arps [ as postulated ( 20 ) ] , the complete complex can be accom - 1 The Burnham Institute , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 2 Structural Biology Laboratory , Salk Institute for Bio - logical Studies , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 3 Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 4 Department of Cell Biology , Washing - ton University , School of Medicine , St .

This is reason - able on structural grounds , because Arps share high sequence identity to actin and are about the same size as actin , thus are likely to be folded similarly ( 4 ) . In our model ( Fig . 3A ) , the Arps are the first two subunits of the daughter filament . The available structural data cannot distinguish whether Arp2 is at the pointed end of the daughter filament or in the second position . However , the pattern of con - served surface residues between actin and Arp2 ( 4 ) leads us to speculate that Arp2 makes the majority of contacts with actin at the growing , barbed end of the daughter fil - ament and Arp3 is positioned at the pointed end of the branch ( Fig . 3A ) . In this model , three subunits ( p40 , p35 , and p14 ) of the complex make contact with subdomain 1 of actin subunits in the mother filament . This arrangement is fully consistent with previous cross - linking ( 2 , 15 ) , biochemical ( 8 ) , and genetic ( 21 ) studies . After adding Arp2 / 3 complex to preformed actin filaments , we sawâ€”in both frozen - hydrated and freeze - etched , quick - frozen samplesâ€”masses at - tached to the sides of the filaments whose size and shape ( Fig . 3B ) correspond very closely to those of the Arp2 / 3 complex model built from the 2D branch - junction reconstruc - tion ( Fig . 3 , A and C ) . Because the filaments were polymerized before addition of Arp2 / 3 complex , our observation of the complex bound to their sides is consistent with the hypothesis that branches form on the side of mother filaments ( 22 ) , and it does not support the hypothesis that one of the Arps is incor - porated into the mother filament and the other into the daughter filament ( 23 ) .

The reason for this is that two Arps arranged along the genetic helix of the actin filament cannot fit into the planar struc - ture of the free Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 , D through F ) . Thus , at least one of the Arps must rearrange to fit into the projection view of the actin - bound structure . Although it is possible to postulate reasonable subunit re - arrangements that are consistent with the available data , molecular details of this con - formational change will require an atomic structure of the complex and additional anal - ysis . A conformational change coupled to branching nucleation is consistent with the observation that preformed actin filaments are secondary activators of nucleation ( 8 , 20 , 23 â€“ 25 ) . The reconstructions support the mod - el ( 9 ) that activation of Arp2 / 3 involves re - arrangement of the subunits in the complex to bring the Arps together in a filamentous ar - rangement . Interestingly , gold labeling places the WA domain close to the interface be - tween the mother filament and Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 3 , E and F ) , suggesting that WA and the mother filament may cooperate to facilitate the rearrangement of subunits in the complex , bringing the Arps together in a conformation suitable for barbed - end nucle - ation of the branch .

Shadowed specimens were prepared as described ( 2 ) . Handedness of the shadowed specimen was determined using the 5 . 1 - nm left - handed actin repeat and the 37 . 5 - nm right - handed half - twist crossover repeat , both visible in the images ( Fig . 2D ) . 11 . Image processing of single particles of Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex . Interactive selection from 46 images yielded 4414 particles ( Fig . 1A ) . The particles were processed and analyzed using the EMAN ( 28 ) and COAN ( 29 ) software packages . A correction for the contrast transfer function was applied for all images . Absolutescalingwasperformedusingtheknownhelicalsymmetryofactin(cid:222)lamentspresentinthesameim - ages . For 3D reconstruction , particles were aligned to each other using the reference - free method , classi(cid:222)ed into 20 to 25 classes , and averaged . Brie(cid:223)y , particles that appear to be similar ( by dot product ) to one another were grouped together into a prede(cid:222)ned num - ber of groups , and then the particles within each group were mutually aligned and averaged . This generated a class average for each group that should represent one characteristic view of the particle . Several of these averages were then selected manually and passed to a Fourier common - lines routine that determines the rel - ativeorientations ( Eulerangles ) ofallselectedaverages , which are then combined to calculate an initial 3D model . This initial model was then iteratively re(cid:222)ned against the data . Convergence was achieved when the Fourier shell correlation between successive iterations stabilized . Threeindependentstartingmodelsweregen - erated from different subsets of the Acanthamoeba data set . Several rounds ( 15 to 25 ) of re(cid:222)nement were performed for each of these models using the complete data set . The three calculations converged to the same structure ( Fig . 1D ) , as suggested by the high correlation values . 12 . B . Boâ€¹ttcher , S . A . Wynne , R . A .

Scar WA - Cys , containing a single cysteine residue at its NH 2 - terminus , was puri(cid:222)ed as described ( 22 ) and then reacted with equimolar monoamino Nanogold ( Nanoprobes ) in 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM NaPO 4 ( pH 7 . 0 ) for 16 hours at 4Â¡C . Nanogold - labeled WA was further puri(cid:222)ed by S - 100 gel (cid:222)ltration chroma - tography in 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , and 2 mM DTT . Images of frozen - hydrated Arp2 / 3 complex labeled with nanogold - labeled WA were recorded in focal pairs at 0 . 5 and 2 . 5 m m defocus using low - dose conditions . The position of the gold label within the reconstruction was calculated by backprojection from 10 class averages of gold - deco - rated particles ( generated by superposition of the focal - pair images ) after alignment to projections cal - culated from the undecorated reconstruction . 14 . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex was puri(cid:222)ed as described ( 30 ) . Bee1 - WA , the 125 COOH - terminal residues of yeast Beep1 was puri(cid:222)ed as described ( 31 , 32 ) . Phalloidin - stabilized actin (cid:222)laments were incubated with 25 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 50 nM Bee1 - WA domain in UBA buffer [ 50 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP ] for 5 min at 22Â¡C . The pellet containing actin (cid:222)laments and attached com - plexes was resuspended in UBA buffer and applied to copper grids coated with triafol holey carbon (cid:222)lms ( pelleting : Beckman - Coulter TLA - 100 rotor at 70 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â¡C ) . The samples were stained with aqueous uranyl acetate , air - dried , and imaged at 2 m m defocus . The yeast data set consisted of 1157 particles selected from 13 images , and was processed following the procedure described for Acanthamoeba ( 11 ) , which yielded a reconstruction very similar to that of Acanthamoeba ( Fig . 1D ) . 15 .

Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle ace - tone powder ( 33 ) and further puri(cid:222)ed by gel (cid:222)ltration on Sephacryl S - 300 in Ca - G buffer ( 22 ) . Branches were prepared by polymerizing 4 m M Mg - ATP actin in the presence of 50 nM Arp2 / 3 and 200 nM Scar WA in Mg - G buffer [ 2 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 200 m M ATP , 100 m M MgCl 2 , 500 m M DTT ] containing 1 3 KMEI [ 50 mM KCl , 100 m M MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) ] for 2 min at 22Â¡C followed by addition of 4 m M phalloidin 1 min before applica - tion to the Quantifoil grids . For the reconstruction of the branch junction , 167 clearly visible branches were interactively selected from 127 images . A reference - free alignment of these images gave class averages with branch angles of ; 70Â¡ . The class with the clearest de(cid:222)nition of actin monomers in the (cid:222)la - ments was selected for reference - based alignment . To overcome the blurring of details due to small differences in branching angles , we generated three references emphasizing different portions of the structure . One reference focused on the mother (cid:222)l - ament , one on the daughter (cid:222)lament , and one on the central density of the branch junction . The complete data set was aligned to each of the references . Inde - pendent 2D averages were calculated and then merged ( Fig . 2B ) . Atomic models of actin (cid:222)laments ( 19 ) were (cid:222)tted to the projection density of the mother and daughter (cid:222)laments using COAN ( 29 ) . 17 . For myosin decoration , actin (cid:222)laments were poly - merized in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 25 nM ) and Bee1 - WA domain ( 50 nM ) in UBA buffer ( 32 ) . Samples were applied to the triafol grids and incu - bated with expressed smooth muscle myosin cata - lytic domain ( no light chains ) ( 34 ) prior to staining . 18 . T . M . Svitkina , A . B .

Trans - Suppression of Misfolding in an Amyloid Disease Per Hammarstroâ€¹m , Frank Schneider , Jeffery W . Kelly * The transthyretin ( TTR ) amyloid diseases , representative of numerous mis - folding disorders , are of considerable interest because there are mutations that cause or suppress disease . The Val 30 3 Met 30 ( V30M ) TTR mutation is the most prevalent cause of familial amyloid polyneuropathy in heterozygotes , whereas a Thr 119 3 Met 119 ( T119M ) mutation on the second TTR allele protects V30M carriers from disease . Here , we show that the incorporation of one or more T119M TTR subunits into a predominantly V30M tetramer strongly stabilized the mixed tetramer against dissociation . Dissociation is required for amyloid formation , so these (cid:222)ndings provide a molecular explanation for intragenic trans - suppression of amyloidosis . The data also suggest a potential therapeutic strategy , provide insight into tissue - speci(cid:222)c deposition and amyloid compo - sition , and support the validity of the amyloid hypothesis in human disease . The amyloidoses are a large group of protein misfolding diseases ( 1 â€“ 3 ) . The 80 transthyre - tin ( TTR ) amyloid diseases are representative of those where a full - length protein composes the fibrils . The TTR familial amyloid poly - neuropathy ( FAP ) mutations ( e . g . , V30M ) make TTR more susceptible to dissociation and the conformational changes that enable amyloid deposition and pathology . Com - pound heterozygotes having V30M and T119M TTR mutations on different alleles have few , if any , manifestations of FAP ( 4 , 5 ) , suggesting that the incorporation of a stabilizing subunit in an oligomeric protein such as TTR can protect against misfolding and disease . Previous studies document the increased stability of T119M - containing TTR and the decreased stability of the V30M - containing TTR , relative to the wild type ( WT ) ( 6 â€“ 8 ) . Here , we evaluate the amyloidogenicity and stability of individual tetramers with defined V30M and / or T119M subunit composition to explain the T119M trans - suppression that pro - tects compound heterozygotes from disease .
