We demonstrated that WASH , a recently identified WASP family protein , colo - calizes on endosomal subdomains with the cargo - selective complex ( CSC ) of the retromer , where it regulates retrograde sorting from endosomes in an actin - dependent manner . How - ever , the mechanism of WASH recruitment to these retromer - enriched endosomal subdo - mains is unclear . Here we show that a component of the WASH regulatory complex ( SHRC ) , FAM21 , which contains 21 copies of a novel L - F - [ D / E ] 3 - 10 - L - F motif , directly interacts with the retromer CSC protein VPS35 . Endosomal localization of FAM21 is VPS35 dependent and re - lies on multivalency of FAM21 repeat elements . Using a combination of pull - down assays and isothermal calorimetry , we demonstrate that individual repeats can bind CSC , and binding affinity varies among different FAM21 repeats . A high - affinity repeat can be converted into a low - affinity one by mutation of a hydrophobic residue within the motif . These in vitro data mirror the localization of FAM21 to retromer - coated vesicles in cells . We propose that multi - valency enables FAM21 to sense the density of retromer on membranes , allowing coordina - tion of SHRC recruitment , and consequent actin polymerization , with retromer sorting do - main organization / maturation . INTRODUCTION Actin dynamics plays a central role in numerous cellular processes , such as migration , adhesion , and vesicle trafficking ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Firat - Karalar and Welch , 2011 ) . Members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family , including WASP , N - WASP , WAVE ( 1 - 3 ) , WHAMM , JMY , and WASH , control actin dynamics by activating the ubiquitous Arp2 / 3 complex ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Rottner et al . , 2010 ) . A conserved C - terminal VCA domain , found in all WASP family pro - teins , binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas distinct N - termini allow individual members of the WASP family to integrate into unique protein complexes with different cellular functions . WASH , a recently identified member of the WASP family , is found in all genetically characterized eukaryotic organisms except yeast and Arabidopsis ( Linardopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Veltman and In - sall , 2010 ) . WASH localizes to sorting domains on endosomes , where it is suggested to regulate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) trafficking , as well as the recycling of transferrin receptors and α 5 β 1 integrins to the cell surface ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ; Zech et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , we recently dem - onstrated that WASH regulates actin - dependent retrograde sorting of cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) to the trans - Golgi network ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) .

Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Fam21 links the WASH complex to retromer | 2353 terial toxins ( Bonifacino and Hurley , 2008 ; Burd , 2011 ; Cullen and Korswagen , 2011 ) . Mammalian retromer consists of two loosely linked complexes . One is a trimeric assembly of VPS35 , VPS29 , and VPS26 , known as the cargo - selective complex ( CSC ) , responsible for recognizing mem - brane - bound cargo proteins ; the other is formed by sorting nexin ( SNX ) proteins ( SNX1 / 2 / 5 / 6 ) , important for membrane deformation through their BAR domains ( Bonifacino and Hurley , 2008 ; Wassmer et al . , 2009 ; Burd , 2011 ; Cullen and Korswagen , 2011 ) . Recent studies indicate an interaction between FAM21 and the CSC component VPS35 , suggesting that SHRC recruitment to endosomes involves direct binding to retromer ( Harbour et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . However , it remains unclear how SHRC recruitment could be coordi - nated with the assembly of retromer on membranes to ensure appropriate mem - brane dynamics and consequent endo - somal trafficking . Here we show that FAM21 contains 21 repeats of a novel L - F - [ D / E ] 3 - 10 - L - F motif ( referred to hereafter as the LFa motif ) , which binds directly to the VPS35 subunit of the retromer CSC . Adjacent motifs can act cooperatively to bind multiple CSCs , although there is significant variability in the affinities of different motifs for ret - romer . Multivalency of FAM21 is requisite for endosomal localization of SHRC . Taken together , these observations lead to a model for SHRC recruitment to CSC - en - riched endosomal subdomains in which multivalency enables FAM21 to bind membrane - associated CSC with high cooperativ - ity and thus sense the organization and / or density of retromer on membranes . This mechanism would couple SHRC recruitment with maturation of retromer sorting domains . RESULTS FAM21 contains multiple copies of a novel leucine - phenylalanine - acidic motif FAM21 can be divided into two distinct regions : a “head” domain consisting of the N - terminal ∼ 220 amino acids , which is responsible for incorporation into the SHRC , and a largely disordered “tail” con - taining the remaining ∼ 1100 amino acids ( Figure 1A ) . The FAM21 tail harbors at least 21 copies of a novel motif , which contains 3 – 10 acidic residues flanked by two hydrophobic Leu – Phe residues ( Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure S1 ) . We term this the leucine - phenylalanine - acidic ( LFa ) motif . Leucine in the LFa motif is occa - sionally replaced with similar hydrophobic residues , such as isoleu - cine , valine , or methionine ; some other residues , in particular serine , are frequently found within the acidic stretch . Enriched with hydro - phobic and acidic residues , the LFa motif is reminiscent of sorting motifs that are recognized by adapter proteins and Golgi - localized , γ - ear - containing , Arf - binding ( GGA ) proteins ( Bonifacino and Traub , 2003 ) . However , FAM21 is not a cargo protein , and , to our knowl - edge , the LFa motif is distinct from known protein – protein interac - tion motifs . WASH exists in cells in a stable complex known as the WASH regulatory complex ( SHRC ) , which includes four additional proteins : FAM21 , strumpellin , SWIP , and CCDC53 ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ) . A combination of se - quence , biochemical , and structural data has shown that the SHRC is homologous to the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , a pentam - eric assembly containing the WASP protein WAVE . WASH , strumpel - lin , SWIP , and CCDC53 are predicted to be largely ordered in the SHRC , based on analogy to the WRC structure ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , FAM21 integrates into the SHRC through only its N - terminal 220 residues . The C - terminal ∼ 1100 residues of FAM21 , which are unrelated to WRC elements , are predicted to be mostly unstructured . This C - terminal tail of FAM21 plays a key role in controlling SHRC localization ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . It is necessary for WASH targeting to endosomes and can bind endo - somes independent of the remaining SHRC subunits ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Moreover , FAM21 - dependent SHRC targeting is requisite for efficient CI - MPR sorting ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . However , the mechanism by which FAM21 is recruited to endosomal membranes remains ill defined . We recently showed that the SHRC colocalizes strongly with retromer - enriched endosomal subdomains ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . The retromer is a conserved protein complex that controls the retrograde transport of a wide range of endosomal cargoes ( Seaman et al . , 1998 ) . Retromer is required for lysosomal mor - phology and function , Wnt signaling , and transport of certain bac - FIGURE 1 : FAM21 directly interacts with retromer CSC .

( D ) HeLa cells were transfected with shFAM21 / HA - YFP - FAM21 rescue vectors expressing HA - YFP - FAM21 fusion proteins ( amino acids 1 – 356 or R 1 - 21 ) , which were analyzed for association with VPS35 and WASH via immunoprecipitation . 2354 | D . Jia et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell To confirm that the FAM21 tail is impor - tant for retromer binding in cells , we sup - pressed endogenous FAM21 and reex - pressed the C - terminal tail containing the LFa motifs ( R 1 - 21 ) or the head domain involved in SHRC assembly ( amino acids 1 – 356 ) . Only FAM21 R 1 - 21 was able to coimmunoprecipi - tate with endogenous VPS35 , whereas the SHRC - interacting N - terminus did not ( Figure 1D ) . Together , these data suggest that the FAM21 tail interacts with retromer . Interaction between FAM21 and CSC is mediated by LFa motifs and VPS35 FN , FM , and FC can each bind the CSC . Yet these fragments have little similarity except for harboring multiple LFa motifs . Thus we examined whether the motifs could mediate interaction with CSC . We generated three additional FAM21 tail fragments : one is de - void of motifs ( noR ) ; the other two ( R 15 - 20 and R 17 - 20 ) contain six and four repeats , re - spectively . Similar to the FC fragment , both R 15 - 20 and R 17 - 20 could effectively retain CSC . In contrast , the noR fragment failed to interact with CSC ( Figure 2B ) . Thus CSC binding is likely mediated by the LFa motifs in the FAM21 tail . We next tested whether FAM21 could in - teract with an individual protein of the CSC or required the intact trimer . Individual VPS35 , VPS26 , and VPS29 proteins were used in pull - down assays with immobilized FC . Both VPS35 and the trimeric CSC , but not VPS26 or VPS29 , were effectively retained by FC ( Figure 2C ) . Therefore VPS35 is necessary and sufficient to interact with FAM21 . VPS35 regulates FAM21 and SHRC localization We previously showed that FAM21 and SHRC colocalized with ret - romer and that suppression of FAM21 had no effect on the localiza - tion of retromer components ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . To deter - mine whether retromer CSC regulates the localization of FAM21 , we suppressed VPS35 using RNA interference ( RNAi ) and examined lo - calization of FAM21 ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . Consistent with a pre - vious report ( Harbour et al . , 2012 ) , suppression of VPS35 resulted in significant dissociation of FAM21 from endosomal membranes and concomitant cytosolic dispersal of the protein . FAM21 localization could be rescued by reexpression of RNAi - resistant yellow fluores - cent protein ( YFP ) – VPS35 , which displayed strong colocalization with endogenous FAM21 ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . Because FAM21 has the potential to target the entire SHRC to endosomes ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) , we conclude that FAM21 and SHRC localization to retromer - enriched endosomal subdomains is VPS35 dependent . Both the quality and the quantity of LFa repeats are important for interaction with retromer CSC in vitro The FAM21 tail contains 21 LFa motifs , each with a distinct se - quence ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Because the FC fragment dem - onstrated the most robust binding to VPS35 , we used this region of FAM21 to better understand the LFa - CSC interaction . Specifically , we sought to learn which motifs could bind CSC most tightly , the stoichiometry of binding , and which residues of the LFa motifs con - tribute most significantly to binding . We tested several immobilized FAM21 directly interacts with retromer CSC We previously showed that the FAM21 tail was important for endo - somal localization of SHRC ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . To learn how FAM21 is targeted to endosomes , we took an unbiased ap - proach to identify binding partners of the FAM21 C - terminus . We engineered a fragment encompassing LFa repeats 1 – 6 of FAM21 ( FN ) and another containing repeats 15 – 21 ( FC ; Figure 1A ) . The 19 - residue CapZ - binding motif of FAM21 ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) was re - moved from FC . The two FAM21 fragments were expressed as glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusions , immobilized , and incu - bated with bovine brain extracts . Three different bands were spe - cifically retained by FN or FC fragments but not by GST control ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that they corresponded to adaptor protein 2 α 2 ( AP2 α 2 ) , WAFL / FKBP15 , and the retromer CSC component VPS35 . The interac - tions of FAM21 with AP2 α 2 and WAFL / FKBP15 have been re - ported ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Viklund et al . , 2009 ; Harbour et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Pan et al . , 2010 ) , and we focused on the interaction with VPS35 . In cells VPS35 is constitutively associated with VPS26 and VPS29 to form the CSC ( Hierro et al . , 2007 ) . To determine whether the in - teraction between FAM21 and CSC was direct , we performed pull - down assays with purified recombinant proteins . Purified CSC was incubated with GST - FN , - FC , and - FM ( a middle fragment of the FAM21 tail containing repeats 7 – 14 ) . As shown in Figure 1B , all three GST - FAM21 fragments could efficiently pull down CSC . FC retained more CSC than FN and FM , and untagged FC could com - pete with FM for CSC binding ( Figure 1C ) . These results demon - strate that different fragments of FAM21 can directly interact with a common site ( s ) on the CSC .

Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Fam21 links the WASH complex to retromer | 2355 of 6 . 8 and 3 . 2 μM for each site in R 19 - 20 and R 20 - 21 , respectively ( although these values should be viewed as approximate , as de - scribed in Materials and Methods ) . The data for the FC fragment can also be fitted to a single K d of 2 . 4 μM for each site and stoichi - ometry of 2 . 38 : 1 ( 1 / N = 2 . 38 ; stoichiometry for a system with seven potential binding sites should be viewed as highly approxi - mate ) , supporting the notion that in solution the interactions between FC and retromer CSC are mediated primarily by the last three repeats , which exhibit high affinity for CSC . Due to the stoichiometry of the interaction , it is likely better to titrate CSC into Fam21 frag - ments ; however , the high concentration of CSC required ( at least 200 μM ) makes such an experiment unfeasible . Finally , ITC data on the FN fragment , which contains six repeats predicted to have low affinity for CSC , could be fitted to a single K d of 11 . 5 μM for each site and stoichiometry of ∼ 3 : 1 . This affinity is lower than that of the FC fragment , in agreement with our pull - down results ( Figure 1B ) . Taken together , our biochemical data indi - cate that the LFa motif is the minimal CSC - binding element but that different motifs have quite different affinities for CSC . As described in the Discussion , it is likely that when retromers are bound to membranes , avidity effects involving both high - affinity and low - affinity sites in the FAM21 tail will afford high overall affinity of the SHRC for membranes . Both the quality and the quantity of FAM21 repeats are important for its endosomal localization We next determined how the number and quality of LFa repeats col - lectively contribute to endosomal localization of FAM21 . We used a suppression / reexpression system to deplete endogenous FAM21 and reexpress YFP - tagged FAM21 truncation mutants ( Figures 4A and 5A ) . As we showed previously ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) , wild - type YFP - FAM21 had a punctate localization juxtaposed with the early endosome marker EEA1 ( Figure 4B ) . Similarly , FAM21 retained robust endosomal localization when up to five repeats were deleted from the N - terminus of FAM21 ( R 5 - 21 ) . However , when we made additional N - terminal deletions ( R 6 - 21 , R 7 - 21 , R 9 - 21 ) , the colocalization of FAM21 mutants with EEA1 diminished appreciably , although not completely . Finally , FAM21 was redistributed from endosome membranes to the cytosol when 10 repeats were deleted from the N - terminus ( R 11 - 21 ) . Consistent with the importance of R 20 and R 21 in binding retromer in vitro , we found that FAM21 became cytosolic with deletion of both C - terminal repeats ( R 5 - 19 ) , and deletion of only R 21 substantially diminished FAM21 localization ( R 5 - 20 ) . Last , deletion of R 11 - 14 in the context of R 5 - 21 ( R 5 - 19 / Δ R 11 - 14 ) also resulted in consider - ably diminished endosomal localization . These experiments suggest that the endosomal localization of FAM21 requires a combination of multiple repeats of high and low affinity . Therefore both the number of FAM21 repeats ( which will likely afford avidity when retromer is at membranes ; see later discussion ) and the exact repeat sequence ( which determines the affinity of any particular repeat ) collectively contribute to the FAM21 distribution between cytosol and endo - somal membranes . fragments derived from FC , consisting of one to seven repeats , for their ability to retain recombinant CSC ( Figure 3 , A and B ) . We used the same total repeat concentration in each assay ( rather than the same protein concentration ) , to normalize for the different number of repeats in each fragment . The retromer - binding ability of these FAM21 fragments varied substantially , with fragments bearing re - peats 19 , 20 , or 21 interacting strongly and other fragments only weakly ( if at all ) . Two different single - repeat constructs—R 20 and R 21 —were able to retain CSC , but R 17 was not . Similarly , the double - repeat fragments R 19 - 20 and R 20 - 21 retained significantly more CSC than any of the single - repeat fragments , but fragment R 17 - 18 failed to retain any protein . Moreover , several of the larger fragments— namely R 17 - 20 , R 17 - 21 , and FC—retained CSC to an extent similar to the double - repeat fragments R 19 - 20 and R 20 - 21 , whereas the triple - repeat fragment R 17 - 19 retained a comparable amount of CSC to single - repeat R 20 ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , in solution - phase interactions ( see Discussion ) the final three repeats ( 19 – 21 ) make the most im - portant contributions to binding the FC fragment . We note that re - peats 19 – 21 are three of the four LFa repeats within FAM21 that contain a hydrophobic residue at the sixth position of the repeat ( Supplemental Figure S1C ) , suggesting that this might be a feature that contributes to increased affinity for VPS35 ( see later discussion of Figure 6 ) . Next we used isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) to quantify the interaction between FAM21 and CSC ( Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S4 ) . Different FAM21 - derived fragments were titrated into CSC . ITC experiments showed that R 21 binds CSC with K d of 16 . 6 μM and ∼ 1 : 1 stoichiometry . Moreover , titrations of the double - repeat fragments R 19 - 20 and R 20 - 21 , when fitted to a model that as - sumes identical repeats within a fragment , showed that these frag - ments can bind to CSC in a ∼ 2 : 1 manner ( 1 / N = 2 . 56 and 2 . 04 for R 19 - 20 and R 20 - 21 , respectively ) . These data yielded apparent K d values FIGURE 3 ; Different FAM21 repeats show different efficiencies of CSC binding . ( A ) Schematic representation of FAM21 constructs used . ( B ) GST pull - down of retromer CSC using FC and its derived fragments . Shown is Coomassie blue – stained gel of input and bound samples from GST pull - down assays . Each input sample , except for GST control , contained 700 pmol of total LFa motifs and 800 pmol of retromer CSC . 2356 | D . Jia et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Mutagenesis of the FAM21 repeat sequence The LFa motif comprises three elements : two Leu – Phe or Ile – Phe dipeptides and one acidic stretch . We mutated each of the three elements in the context of the R 21 repeat and tested the interac - tion with CSC ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . As shown in Figure 3 , wild - type R 21 retained CSC on the solid support . However , when the first IF dipeptide motif was mutated to AA ( mt1 ) the interaction with CSC was abolished ; the single F - to - A mutant ( mt2 ) behaved similarly . In contrast , mutation of F to A ( mt5 ) in the second di - peptide element only weakly affected binding . Changing the central residues from DD to KK ( mt3 ) or PL to DD ( mt4 ) also dra - matically decreased CSC binding ( Figure 6B ) . Last , a single L - to - D mutation ( mt6 ) of the hydrophobic residue at position 6 resulted in a significant loss of binding ( Figure 6 , A and C ) . Simi - lar conclusions are supported by mutagenesis of double - repeat FAM21 fragments ( Supplemental Figure S5 , A – E ) . Taken to - gether , these data demonstrate that the LF / IF dipeptide motifs , as well as the acidic charged region , are critical to CSC interac - tion and support the notion that the hydrophobic residue at po - sition 6 , which is found in R 19 - R 21 , may contribute to increased affinity for VPS35 . Because R 5 - 21 but not R 5 - 19 can localize to early endosomes ( Figures 4 and 5 ) , we tested whether addition of the four N - termi - nal repeat motifs onto R 5 - 19 ( R 1 - 19 ) would affect localization . Impor - tantly , R 1 - 19 partially rescued endosomal localization ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . Thus the addition of lower - affinity repeats to the N - terminus can partially rescue FAM21 localization , confirming that a combination of low - affinity interactions can support endosomal targeting . Inter - estingly , although FC can efficiently bind retromer CSC in vitro , a YFP - tagged FAM21 - FC * ( asterisk indicates that it contains the CAPZ - binding motif ) construct was unable to localize to endosomal mem - branes , suggesting that the high - affinity binding repeat motifs found in this region are insufficient to cause membrane targeting ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . To test whether the number of repeats could affect subcel - lular localization , we created a fusion protein of FC * and R 11 - 21 frag - ments of FAM21 , which each individually does not localize to endo - membranes . Significantly , this fusion protein ( FC * / R 11 - 21 ) relocalized to EEA1 + endosomes , consistent with the idea that both the number and the strength of retromer CSC - binding interactions contribute to FAM21 targeting to endosomes ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . Thus , varying the LFa motif number and sequence can shift the distribution of FAM21 between endosomes and cytosol .

In addition , the SHRC might control actin cytoskeletal dynamics on specific en - dosomal regions , which could be important in organizing / stabilizing these subdomains or concentrating recycling cargoes for effi - cient trafficking ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . Identifying which regions of the sorting / recycling endosome where the SHRC and retromer are functioning will be important for fully elucidating their cellular activities . It re - mains possible that some retromer - depen - dent cargoes may be trafficked independent of the SHRC , whereas others are SHRC de - pendent . This might result from the fact that the classical retromer complex is believed to consist of retromer - associated SNXs for membrane tubulation and the cargo recogni - tion complex . We previously showed that WASH puncta were strongly coincident with YFP - VPS29 , whereas SNX1 / 2 puncta were in - stead more often adjacent to WASH puncta ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Consistent with this , we do not observe endogenous SNX1 / 2 staining in cells strongly superimposed with endogenous VPS35 staining . Instead , they more often exhibit adjacent staining ( unpub - lished data ) . This suggests that although the CSC and SNXs functionally cooperate , they are likely not always complexed during the sorting process . Thus , de - pleting SNXs , CSC , or SHRC could result in differential effects on sort - ing . However , our data presented here suggest that depletion of SHRC should phenocopy depletion of retromer CSC . The relationship between WASH and retromer during trafficking of cargo proteins from endosomes may be analogous to that of N - WASP and clathrin during endocytic processes . During clathrin - mediated endocytosis , N - WASP is recruited transiently to clathrin - coated pits ( Benesch et al . , 2005 ) . There , N - WASP controls actin dynamics , which is important for both membrane invagination and vesicle scission ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , we previously showed that during retromer - mediated trafficking events , SHRC is recruited to retromer - coated structures , where it generates Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin required for retromer - depen - dent sorting events ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Actin polymer - ization on these structures , promoted by WASH , could provide a mechanism to concentrate retromer cargoes and / or generate the force for tubulation and scission of retromer - coated tubules . The recruitment of N - WASP and WASH to membranes is also analo - gous , despite differences in detailed mechanism . No direct interac - tion has been observed between N - WASP and clathrin . instead , N - WASP is recruited to clathrin - coated pits indirectly via multiple SH3 - containing adaptor proteins . These adaptors , which are be - lieved to form arrays on membranes ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) , can en - gage the multiple proline - rich motifs in N - WASP . WASH is directly linked with retromer - containing structures via binding to FAM21 . Unlike other WASP - family members , WASH does not have a large proline - rich region to bind multiple SH3 domains . Yet , in the con - text of the SHRC , the FAM21 tail can play an analogous role , with multiple LFa motifs engaging arrays of retromer on membranes . In both mechanisms , the recruitment of a WASP family member to membrane surfaces at high density will result in increased affinity DISCUSSION The SHRC can be directly localized to endosomal membranes through an interaction with retromer ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Harbour et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . Here we showed that this interaction is mediated by the LFa motifs within the C - terminal tail of FAM21 , which directly bind the VPS35 subunit of the retromer CSC . FAM21 harbors > 20 copies of this novel motif , which consists of 3 – 10 acidic residues flanked by two hydrophobic dipeptides . Both acidic and hydrophobic residues within the motif are important for interaction with the CSC . Individual LFa motifs bound CSC with varying affini - ties . Multiple repeats are required for the proper localization of FAM21 to endosomes , and localization can be mediated by various combinations of high - and low - affinity motifs . WASH complex directly interacts with retromer Retromer mediates both endosome - to – trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and endosome - to - plasma membrane trafficking ( Cullen and Korswagen , 2011 ; Temkin et al . , 2011 ) . The direct interaction be - tween retromer and FAM21 suggests that the SHRC is likely impor - tant for both trafficking processes as well . Indeed , WASH depletion compromises the transport of CI - MPR , a membrane cargo that is transported to TGN in a retromer - dependent manner ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . A more recent study implicates the WASH com - plex in the trafficking of α 5 β 1 integrins through the endosomal pathway to the leading edge of migrating cells ( Zech et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , the β 2 adrenergic receptor ( β 2AR ) localizes to distinct endosomal subdomains that are enriched with retromer as well as the WASH complex , Arp2 / 3 , and actin ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ; Temkin et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , β 2AR recycling depends on ret - romer and actin dynamics ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ; Temkin et al . , 2011 ) . An attractive idea is that the β 2AR , as well as α 5 β 1 integrins , is recognized in a sequence - specific manner by the retromer and FIGURE 6 : All three elements of the FAM21 motif contribute to binding the CSC .

Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Fam21 links the WASH complex to retromer | 2359 the retromer coat . Such coordination is likely needed for proper maturation of the retromer subdomain , vesicle scission , and endo - cytic trafficking . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and plasmids Reagents were from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) unless specified . Anti - HA Affinity Matrix and anti – hemagglutinin ( HA ) - horseradish peroxidase were from Roche ( Indianapolis , IN ) . We used monoclonal anti - EEA1 ( BD Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) and fluo - rescently conjugated secondary reagents from Molecular Probes ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Anti - FAM21 and anti - WASH were as described ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Anti - VPS35 was generated by immunizing rabbits with GST fusion protein containing the AA461 end of hVPS35 ( Cocalico Biologicals , Reamstown , PA ) . The dual shFAM21 / HA - YFP - FAM21 rescue vector system was as described previously ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . We also generated a sh - VPS35 / HA - YFP - VPS35 rescue vector system using shVPS35 ( CAGAG - CAGATTAACAAACA ) and VPS35 cDNA made short hairpin RNA resistant via standard mutagenesis ( CtGAaCAaATcAAtAAACA ) . Cell culture , transfection , immunoprecipitation , and GST pull - down assays HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 % fetal bovine serum , 5 % fetal calf serum , and 4 mM l - glutamine and were trans - fected using electroporation as described ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . For immunoprecipitations , cells were lysed in NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 25 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7 . 9 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 μg / ml leupeptin , 5 μg / ml aprotinin ) , and 500 – 1000 μg was prepared and analyzed by im - munoblot as described ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . GST pull - down experiments were performed by mixing 700 pmol of GST or for the Arp2 / 3 complex and thus enhanced actin assembly ( Padrick et al . , 2008 , 2011 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . The direct , multiva - lent , low - affinity interaction between FAM21 and retromer could provide an important mechanism that regulates the maturation of retromer - coated endosomal regions for membrane tubulation , scission , and trafficking . Maturation of retromer - coated tubules Formation of a coated vesicle can be regarded as a three - step process ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2009 ) : assembly of the coat protein complex on the membrane through contacts with membrane - bound cargoes and GTPases ( e . g . ; Rab7 - GTP ; Rojas et al . , 2008 ; Seaman et al . , 2009 ; Figure 7A ) , formation of a coated bud , and scission of the coated bud . Little is known about how the matura - tion of retromer - coated tubules is regulated . Our study demon - strates that FAM21 binds multiple retromer molecules , each with low affinity , through its highly multivalent tail . Similarly , when ret - romer is arrayed on a membrane surface it functions essentially in multivalent manner . Thus the retromer – FAM21 interaction can be viewed as that between two multivalent entities . In such systems , affinity can increase sharply with valency due to increasing avidity effects ( Hogg and Winzor , 1985 ) and also with density of the mem - brane - bound component ( Yang et al . , 2003 ) . Consequently , the recruitment of FAM21 , and thus the SHRC , should be sensitive to the number of repeat motifs , as we observe . In addition , recruit - ment should be sensitive to the density of retromer CSC on endo - somal membranes ( Figure 7 , A and B ) . The low LFa motif – retromer affinity suggests that SHRC will not bind appreciably to retromer in solution or when retromer is only sparsely arrayed on membranes . Only when retromer accumulates on membranes to high density will the SHRC be recruited . The nature of the FAM21 tail and its interactions with retromer could thus provide a mechanism to coordinate actin polymerization with assembly and maturation of FIGURE 7 : Model of SHRC interaction with retromer on membranes . ( A ) We propose that the CSC of the retromer is recruited to the endosomal membrane through mechanisms involving GTP - bound Rab 7 and cargo proteins that are destined to enter the retromer - mediated sorting pathway . When retromer accumulates to high density on the endomembrane , the SHRC is then recruited through cumulative binding of higher - affinity ( * ) and lower - affinity FAM21 repeats with VPS35 proteins , thus facilitating the cargo enrichment process and promoting subsequent F - actin – mediated maturation of the retromer subdomain , vesicle scission , and trafficking .

Molecular Biology of the Cell and glutathione – Sepharose 4B resin ( 100 μl ) in 20 ml of pull - down buffer ( PB2 ; 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . The resin was washed four times with 1 ml of PB2 after incubation and eluted with reduced glutathione . Protein bands were excised from SDS – PAGE gels , digested with trypsin , and identified by nano – liquid chromatog - raphy – tandem mass spectrometry methods at the Protein Chemistry Core Research Facility of UT Southwestern Medical Center or the Protein Chemistry and Proteomics Shared Resource of Mayo Clinic . Isothermal titration calorimetry All microcalorimetry experiments were carried out using a VP - ITC MicroCalorimeter ( MicroCal , Northampton , MA ) at 20°C . Proteins were dialyzed extensively or purified by gel filtration chromatogra - phy in the ITC buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM β ME ) . FAM21 proteins ( 100 – 380 μM ) were injected into the sample cell containing retromer CSC ( 10 – 16 μM ) . Each experiment involved one injection of 2 μl followed by 35 injections of 8 μl , with 240 s between injections . Data were analyzed with the Origin 7 . 0 software package ( OriginLab , Northampton , MA ) by fitting the “one - set - of - sites” model to the binding isotherm , yielding a single K d value for all binding events . We also fitted the data according to two other models for the double - repeat fragment R 20 - 21 : two K d values for two sites , both fitted ; and two K d values for two sites , one fixed to 16 . 6 μM ( the value for R 21 alone ) . The one - set - of - sites model yielded a single K d value of 3 . 2 μM and stoichiometry of 0 . 49 , suggesting two retromer binding sites . The second model yielded K d values of 2 . 5 and 8 . 8 μM but was not a statistically better fit of the data accord - ing to an F test . The third model yielded a second K d value of 3 μM but was also not a better fit than the one - set - of - sites model . From these data we conclude that there are likely two binding sites in the R 20 - 21 construct , with K d values in the range 2 . 5 – 16 . 6 μM . More spe - cific statements about the affinities ( e . g . , regarding cooperativity in solution binding ) are not warranted by the data . Titrations of CSC into Fam21 fragments , which could in principle give better data , were not possible due to the limited solubility of retromer CSC . different GST - FAM21 proteins , 800 pmol of purified retromer CSC , and 30 μl of glutathione Sepharose 4B resin in 1 ml of pull - down buffer ( PB ; 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 % [ wt / vol ] glycerol , 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol [ β ME ] ) . After gentle mixing at 4°C for 20 min , the resin was washed four times with 1 ml of PB , followed by elution with reduced glutathione . Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS – PAGE and visualized with Coomassie blue . Immunofluorescence HeLa cells were grown directly on coverslips , fixed in 4 % paraformal - dehyde , and prepared for immunofluorescence as described ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Images were obtained with an LSM - 710 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Protein purification DNA encoding full - length human VPS35 was inserted in a modified pGEX vector , resulting in a N - terminal GST tag followed by a to - bacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease site . Full - length VPS29 and residues 9 – 327 of VPS26A were expressed as N - terminal TEV - cleavable hexahistidine ( His 6 ) - tagged fusions . VPS35 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) - T1R ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and expressed at 16°C overnight . Both VPS26 and VPS29 were expressed at 20°C overnight . Cell pellets from 1 l of VPS35 , 1 l of VPS29 , and 2 l of VPS26 were mixed and colysed by high - pressure homogenization in buffer containing 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 5 mM β ME . VPS35 is the limiting component in this procedure . The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation and subjected to glu - tathione – Sepharose 4B affinity ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) chromatography . The bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione and cleaved with TEV protease . The cleaved proteins were further purified by Source Q ion exchange ( GE Healthcare ) and gel filtration ( Superdex 200 ; GE Healthcare ) chromatographies , resulting in the 1 : 1 : 1 : trimeric retromer CSC . For purification of individual protein within the CSC , GST - VPS35 was purified similarly , and the GST fusion was cleaved and removed by Source Q ion exchange chromatography . VPS26 was purified with nickel - nitriloacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) agarose resin ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Isolated VPS26 had more severe degradations than complexed protein . The degradations probably occurred on the C - terminus of VPS26 , as they were able to bind to Ni - NTA agarose resin . VPS29 was expressed as a maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) fusion and puri - fied using amylose resin ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) . FAM21 proteins were expressed with an N - terminal GST fusion and purified by glutathione – Sepharose 4B affinity and ion exchange chromatographies . FN and FC also have a C - terminal His 6 tag and were purified by glutathione – Sepharose 4B affinity , Ni - NTA agarose affinity , and gel filtration ( Superdex 200 ) chromatographies . For ITC experiments , R 19 - 20 , R 20 - 21 , and R 21 were expressed with an N - termi - nal , TEV - cleavable MBP tag and a C - terminal , noncleavable His 6 tag . A tryptophan residue was inserted between FAM21 and the His 6 tag to facilitate the determination of protein concentration . The proteins were first purified by Ni - NTA agarose affinity resin and eluted with imidazole . The eluted proteins were cleaved with TEV during dialysis ( in order to remove imidazole ) , and MBP was removed by loading back to Ni - NTA resin . The proteins were finally purified by gel filtra - tion ( Superdex 75 ; GE Healthcare ) chromatography . Identification of FAM21 - binding proteins from bovine brain extract Preparation of bovine brain extract was described previously ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) . Extract containing ∼ 75 mg of total protein was incu - bated at 4°C for 1 h with 0 . 15 mg of purified GST - FN or - FC proteins ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank members of the Rosen and Billadeau laboratories and Ryan Potts for helpful discussions .
