General , Artistic and Scientific Creativity Attributes of Engineering and Music Students Christine Charyton and Glenn E . Snelbecker Temple University ABSTRACT : The purpose of this research was to investigate similarities and differences in general , artistic , and scientific creativity between engineering versus music students , as 2 groups respectively representing scientific and artistic domains . One hundred music and 105 engineering students from a large , Northeastern university completed measures of general creativity , music creativity , engineering creativity , and a demographic questionnaire . Results indicated that musicians scored higher in general and artistic creativity , with no significant differences in scientific creativity . Participants had higher levels of creativity , compared with normative data from previous studies . Gender , age , and specialization within major yielded no significant differences . Implications for creativity measures are discussed , including cognitive risk tolerance . Snow ( 1959 ) noticed some attributes of scientists and artists that made them seem to be living in two different cultures , although also sharing some common qualities . Prospects for identifying crea - tivity attributes among scientists , as well as artists , have been explored periodically by various authors ( Feist , 1999 ; Feist and Barron , 2003 ; Helson 1996 ) , and have indicated a need for further investigation of creativity in these two cultures . Questions that motivated our investigation included the follow - ing : What similarities and differences are there in general , artistic , and scientific creativity among engineering and music undergraduate students ? How do these engineering and music majors compare with published normative test infor - mation ? To what extent are there similarities and differences within each major ? What creativity dif - ferences are functions of demographic characteris - tics ( gender , ethnicity and age ) among engineering and music students ? The Nature of Artistic and Scientific Creativity Simonton , as quoted in Kersting ( 2003 ) , seemed to acknowledge the existence of differences , as well as possible similarities in creativity between scien - tist and artists when he stated : ‘‘Science has to be constrained to scientific process , but there’s a lot less constraint on artists . Many artists come from more chaotic environments , which prepares them to create with less structure’’ ( p . 40 ) . Accord - ing to Simonton ( 1999 ) , ‘‘Researchers often treat creativity as a single , relatively homogeneous phenomenon’’ ( p . 639 ) . Somewhat in contrast , Gardner ( 1999 ) stated , ‘‘People are creative when they can solve problems , create products , or raise issues in a domain in a way that is initially novel Christine Charyton is now at Department of Psychology , the Ohio State University at Newark .

Gardner’s views seem to support the idea that creativity can take different forms in different domains . Thus , it may be conceptually and practically important to know about differ - ences , as well as similarities , of creativity among engineers versus musicians . Cognitive and disposition profiles tend to vary according to the type of creative achievement ( Feist , 1999 ; Simonton , 1999 ) . Larson , Thomas , and Leviness ( 1999 ) noted the possibility that creativity in engineering might be different from creativity in literature , painting , and other profes - sions . ‘‘A distinguishing feature is that the engineer has an eye on function and utility . Therefore , there may be a creative engineer versus a creative sculp - tor , painter , poet or musician’’ ( p . 2 ) . Weisberg ( 1995 ) stated that the basis for creativity is prob - lem solving . This problem solving process is com - mon in both artistic and scientific fields , although it may take different forms . Some researchers have attempted to under - stand similarities and differences regarding artistic versus scientific creativity by focusing on person - ality attributes . ‘‘Certain personality traits con - sistently covary with creativity , yet there are some domain specificities’’ ( Feist , 1999 , p . 289 ) . As a result of meta - analysis , Feist ( 1999 ) ident - ified social and nonsocial traits in art and science domains from recent theories of Eysenck ( 1994 ) , Russ ( 1993 ) , Busse and Mansfield ( 1984 ) , and the five - factor model . Social traits for the artist included norm doubting , nonconformity , inde - pendence , hostility , aloofness , unfriendliness , and lack of warmth . Social traits of scientific crea - tive personality included dominance , arrogance , hostility , and high self - confidence . It appears that aesthetic taste and a lack of convention - ality are common characteristics of creativity in both domains ( Feist , 1998 , 1999 ; Simonton , 1999 ; Sternberg , 1986 ) . Helson ( 1996 ) , MacKinnon ( 1962 ) , and Simonton ( 1999 ) are some of the researchers who had investigated art and science domain differences . MacKinnon , an earlier researcher , reported that the creator in scientific creativity acts as a mediator between externally defined needs and goals , but in artistic creativity , the creator exter - nalizes something of himself or herself into the public field . When studying artists and scientists , MacKinnon emphasized architects and mathema - ticians , because architecture design requires the practitioner to be both an artist and a scientist . Helson , using the Holland ( 1966 ) hexagon system for analyzing occupational potential , reported that creativity was most likely to be found among people with artistic interests , followed by investi - gative , social , and enterprising personalities . According to Helson , creativity is least likely in realistic and conventional personalities . From her research , it would seem reasonable that engineering students may be less likely than music students to display creativity . According to Simonton , ‘‘creative scientists tend to exhibit traits that fall somewhere between those of the creative artist and those of the average human being’’ ( p . 639 ) . One logical extention , beyond what Helson and Simonton stated , would be to predict that engineers and musicians may differ in some attributes that are specific , respectively , to science and art domains . Feist and Barron ( 2003 ) , from a longitudinal study starting when respondents were graduate students , found that creative individuals tended to be more autonomous , introverted , open to new experiences , norm - doubting , self - confident , and self - accepting . They concluded , ‘‘The parti - cipants who became the most creative over the course of their lives were self - controlling , inde - pendent , self - assured , spontaneous , responsible , tried to make a good impression on others , rela - tively low in hypomania and hostility’’ ( p . 80 ) . Feist and Barron ( 2003 ) observed that ‘‘these find - ings contradict other studies that have reported arrogance and hostility to be associated with cre - ative scientists’’ ( p . 81 ) . It is plausible that some of these creativity attri - butes may be common in both engineering and music domains ( Charyton , 2005 ) . Perhaps literature has emphasized differences ; however , similarities in scientific and artistic creativity may also be preva - lent . Therefore , in our study , we chose to investigate potential similarities , by using measures of general creativity attributes , and potential differences by also using domain specific creativity measures . Furthermore , risk taking may be an attribute that affects creativity , thus we included a measure of cognitive risk tolerance for assessment . Farley C . Charyton & G . E . Snelbecker 214 Creativity Research Journal ( 1991 ) commented that ‘‘creativity in science , art and many fields , [ is ] the sort of productive risk taking [ that ] has been a hallmark of America from its beginnings’’ ( p . 375 ) . The concept of risk toler - ance has been central to decision making in finance , investments , and financial planning ( Roszkowski & Snelbecker , 1990 ) . Snelbecker , Roszkowski , and Cutler ( 1990 ) proposed a con - ceptual model and developed a set of scales to assess investors’ risk tolerance and return aspira - tions ( Roszkowski , Snelbecker , & Leimberg , 1989 ) . A measure of cognitive risk tolerance ( Snelbecker , McConlogue , & Feldman , 2001 ) was developed as an extension of that model and set of scales . Feldman ( one of the creators of the cog - nitive risk tolerance scale ) noted : ‘‘ [ Cognitive risk tolerance is ] an individual’s ability to formulate and express one’s ideas despite the threat of nega - tive assessment regarding : reputation , integrity , credibility , honor and intelligence’’ ( Feldman , 2003 , p . 6 ) . Using the Cognitive Risk Tolerance Survey , Feldman ( 2003 ) found cognitive risk toler - ance to be moderately related to , but different from , two so - called positive psychology variables : academic hardiness and emotional intelligence . Additionally , the present authors viewed cognitive risk tolerance as a potentially relevant attribute or component of creativity . In previous research ( Feldman , 2003 ) , the Cognitive Risk Tolerance Scale was also moderately correlated with two other positive psychology attributes , academic hardiness and emotional intelligence . Risk taking has been described by others ( Farley , 1991 ) as a necessary component of creativity . However , our series of literature reviews did not reveal relevant research findings about the risk taking in general , nor of cognitive risk tolerance in particular , for creativity . In our study , cogni - tive risk tolerance was included as a construct to be measured in regard to general creativity . Although various authors have mentioned risk as a component of influence on creativity , the only cognitive risk tolerance instrument found during the literature reviews was the research version of the Cognitive Risk Tolerance Survey ( Snelbecker , McConologue , & Feldman , 2001 ) . Therefore , it seems plausible that cognitive risk tolerance might be related to creativity among engineers as well as musicians . Measurement of Musicians’ and Engineers’ Creativity Initially , we attempted to identify existing scientific creativity and artistic creativity measures , but were not very successful in finding such ins - truments . Various resources were reviewed to identify potentially useful measures , respectively , of engineers’ and musicians’ creativity . In addition to conducting literature searches of psychology , social science , technology , education , and other databases , we also contacted relevant faculty members , specialized librarians , and others who might provide leads to such instruments . Wherever feasible , we contacted authors or vendors of instruments that might be useful for this study . We first searched for information about crea - tivity measures for musicians , because it seemed likely that more measures might be available for musicians’ creativity than for engineers’ crea - tivity . Despite extensive searches , we found very few appropriate instruments . Music creativity researchers apparently have tended to utilize the divergent versus convergent thinking processes or have focused on creative products ( Hickey , 2001 ; Hong , Milgram , & Gorsky , 1995 ; Runco , 1986 ) . According to Hickey , consensual assessment is one approach that has been used to assess the extent to which music products or outcomes are ‘‘creative’’ ; consensual assessment involves the extent to which there is interrater agreement of a creative product . However , Hickey notes that the ‘‘use of consensual assessment for measuring musi - cal creativity is recent and limited’’ ( p . 236 ) . There are similarly limited measures designed specifically to assess engineers’ creativity . Resear - chers ( Goodman , Furcon , & Rose , 1969 ; Sprecher , 1963 ) made early attempts to assess engineering creativity , with productivity surveys and tests , but no generally accepted measure of engineers’ creativity resulted from that work . Larson , Thomas , and Leviness ( 1999 ) used the Myers Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) and Torrance tests to assess engineers’ creativity , but apparently they were not satisfied with the MBTI as a measure of creativity . A series of literature reviews revealed that some attempts had been made to measure engineers’ scientific creativity or engineering crea - tivity , but only limited reports were found and General , Artistic , Scientific Creativity Creativity Research Journal 215 efforts to contact those researchers were not suc - cessful ( Gupta , 1988 ; Majumbar , 1975 ; Shukla & Sharma , 1987 , 1986 ) . After review of the infor - mation that could be found , the present authors concluded that the Purdue Creativity Test , designed to measure the potential of engineers to be creative in their career ( Lawshe & Harris , 1960 ) , was an appropriate measure for this study . Larson ( one of the researchers cited above ) indi - cated both support for and interest in our project and our selected measures . Based on his own research and professional experiences , Larson sug - gested that that both originality and practicality ( or , usefulness ) might be a unique attribute of engineering creativity ( M . Larson , personal com - munication , August 14 , 2003 ) . Measurement of General Creativity Based on information from previous research , the present authors hypothesized that engineers and musicians would demonstrate approximately equivalent levels of general creativity , that engi - neers would demonstrate higher levels of scientific creativity , and that musicians would demonstrate higher levels of artistic creativity . Normative data and demographic information ( where available ) were used to provide some perspective about the levels of creativity indicated by respondents in this research . Additionally , it was expected that stu - dents with some specializations ( i . e . , within the engineering major and within the music major ) might display more creativity than other speciali - zations , respectively , within each major . Methodology Participants Data were collected from 105 engineering stu - dents and 100 music students from a large North - eastern university . First , Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the research . School = college administrators and faculty mem - bers reviewed the proposal and granted permission for recruiting engineering and music students . Instructors of the courses were contacted after communicating with these departments to solicit permission to administer the instruments . Missing data were handled by pairwise deletions . The num - ber of missing cases per variable ranged from 0 ( the Harmonic Improvisation Readiness Record , Purdue Creativity Test , Creativity Personality Scale , Creativity Temperament Scale ) to 8 ( Cogni - tive Risk Tolerance Scale ) . Procedure Participants were provided oral and written descriptions of the nature of the study and given opportunities to ask questions . They were infor - med that participation was strictly voluntary and anonymous , with the provision that they could ref - use to participate at any time . Participants were instructed to return consent forms separately , prior to test administration , to maintain confiden - tiality . Each set of materials was coded with a number to ensure objectivity and anonymity . All measures were administered according to the instructions for each test . Last , participants were thanked and given light refreshments for their time , as a token of appreciation . Instruments A questionnaire was administered requesting demographic information . This included age , gender , ethnicity , major , and specialization area within the major . Additional questions for all participants addressed the extent expected to be creative in their particular career , whether they typically would follow instructions or develop their own design , and whether they were in the band or choir in high school . Creative personality scale ( CPS ) . The CPS of the Adjective Checklist ( ACL ; Gough , 1979 ) was administered to assess creativity attributes . This test for creative thinking was chosen because it is highly regarded , reliable and widely used as a creativity test . For example , Plucker and Renzulli ( 1999 ) stated , Oldham and Cummings ( 1996 ) in a comparison of per - sonality traits , environmental characteristics , and pro - duct ratings , found evidence that people with specific personality traits ( i . e . , as judged by Gough’s [ 1979 ] C . Charyton & G . E . Snelbecker 216 Creativity Research Journal Creativity Personality Scale ) produced creative products when challenged by their work and supervised in a sup - portive ‘noncontrolling fashion’ ( p . 609 ) , ( p . 46 ) . Creative temperament scale ( CT ) . The CT adapted from the California Psychological Inven - tory ( CPI ; Gough , 1992 ) was designed to assess personality characteristics and predict what people will say and do in specific contexts . The CT is one of the special purpose scales of the CPI . Gough , gave permission to extract the CT from the CPI ( H . Gough , personal communication , June 28 , 2003 ) . Split - halves reliability indicated . 73 . Items were found to correlate with observers’ rating of creativity ( . 44 ) . Gough ( 1992 ) stated that ‘‘the CT scale correlated with . 33 with the overall com - posite for creativity [ and ] the overall rating of creativity for this sample correlated . 47 with the scores of the CT’’ ( p . 245 ) . Ratings of creativity of engineering honor students also pooled yielded a correlation of . 53 with the CT ( Gough , 1992 ) . Cognitive risk tolerance survey ( CRT ) . The CRT ( Snelbecker , McConolgue , & Teitlebaum , 2001 ) consists of 35 self - report items to assess an individual’s ability to formulate and express one’s ideas despite potential opposition . Responses are on a Likert Scale ranging from 0 ( very strongly dis - agree ) to 9 ( very strongly agree ) . Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive risk tolerance . The CRT was developed as an extension of an ear - lier risk tolerance model developed by Snelbecker and colleagues ( Roszkowski , Snelbecker , & Leimberg , 1989 ; Snelbecker , Roszkowski , & Cutler , 1990 ) . Reliability of this psychometric instrument has proven to be adequate with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient at . 76 during Feldman’s ( 2003 ) pilot study with 78 respondents , and a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of . 78 during the main section of her dissertation study with 84 respondents . Harmonic improvisation readiness record ( HIRR ) . Gordon ( 2000 ) stated that ‘‘improvis - ation began to sustain the serious interest of music educators and psychologists , primarily under the guise of creativity , near the middle of the century’’ ( p . 5 ) . Kiehn ( 2003 ) stated , ‘‘Music composition and improvisation activities are considered develop - mentally important and a part of a comprehensive music program’’ ( p . 278 ) and furthermore , that ‘‘there is a need for more research that focuses on music improvisation and related assessment proce - dures’’ ( p . 279 ) . Gordon ( 2000 ) operated on the premise that ‘‘all improvisation to some extent involves creativity , and all creativity to some extent involves improvisation’’ ( p . 8 ) . Therefore , we pur - sued using Gordon’s measure as an appropriate indi - cator of music creativity . Gordon’s ( 1998 ) HIRR is a paper and pencil test designed for students grades 3 and above to determine a student’s ability to audiate harmonic patterns and predict a student’s potential ( apti - tude ) to improvise harmonically . Means , standard deviations , standard errors , reliability coefficients ( split - halves and Kuder - Richardson ) , item dif - ficulty , and item discrimination levels were reported in the test manual . Item difficulty ranges from . 85 to . 20 for the HIRR . Gordon ( 2000 ) indi - cated a validity coefficient of . 45 of the HIRR with students’ recorded improvisations . Purdue creativity test . The Purdue Creativity Test was developed ‘‘to aid in the selection and placement of engineering personnel who must pro - duce original ideas to solve problems in their jobs’’ ( Lawshe & Harris , 1960 , p . 1 ) . Internal consistency and scoring reliability were reported by two scorers for 64 professional engineers . In our study , we selected the Form G , because the authors sta - ted that both versions ( Form G and Form H ) could be used interchangeably . Reliability esti - mates regarding internal consistency were flexi - bility ( 12 items ) , r ¼ . 86 ; fluency ( 8 items ) , r ¼ . 93 ; and the total score ( 20 items ) , r ¼ . 95 ( Lawshe & Harris , 1960 ) . Reliability estimates regarding interscorer agreement were flexibility ( agreement in categorizing decisions about differ - ent types of responses ) , r ¼ . 87 , and total scores ( Flexibility þ 12 Fluency ) , r ¼ . 97 . ( Interscorer reliability for fluency was not reported because it is a count of responses . ) Concurrent validity evidence was based on the extent to which Purdue Creativity Test scores were predictive of their supervisors’ ratings of high versus low on - the - job creativity ( e . g . , produce new and original ideas when confronted with problem situations ) . Data were obtained from each of three engineer groups—Group 1 , 33 auto product General , Artistic , Scientific Creativity Creativity Research Journal 217 engineers ; Group 2 , 29 process engineers , and Group 3 , 42 automotive design engineers . Chances of high on - the - job creativity ratings from high ver - sus low test scoring engineers were 63 % versus 35 % for Group 1 , 74 % versus 29 % for Group 2 , and 62 % versus 52 % for Group 3 . Results Similarities and Differences Between Engineers and Musicians Similarities and differences in general , scientific , and artistic creativity among engineering and music undergraduate students were examined . A MANOVA was used to detect differences between engineering and music students in terms of three general creativity measures ( creative attributes , creative temperament , and cognitive risk tolerance ) . Separate ANOVAs were used to detect differences between engineering and music students in terms of music ( HIRR ) , and engineering creativity ( Purdue Creativity Test ) . All participants took both engineering and music creativity measures . Table 1 contains means and standard deviations , respectively , for the engineering and music stu - dents for the CPS , CT , CRT , HIRR , and Purdue Creativity Test . A two - way MANOVA was calculated examin - ing the effect of major ( engineering and music ) on general creativity measures . A significant effect was found , Lambda ( 3 , 192 ) ¼ 7 . 17 , p ¼ . 000 , indi - cating that musicians had higher levels of general creativity . A one - way ANOVA was calculated comparing engineers and musicians in music ( artistic ) creativity . A significant difference was found , F ( 1 ) ¼ 23 . 30 , p ¼ . 000 , indicating that musicians had higher levels of music creativity . A one - way ANOVA was calculated comparing engineers and musicians in engineering ( scientific ) creativity . No significant difference was found , F ( 1 ) ¼ . 32 , p ¼ . 574 , in terms of engineering creativity . Our Data Compared with Normative Data Sets Data from these samples of engineering and music majors were compared with published nor - mative test information for general , artistic , and scientific creativity . In general , all four groups in our sample had higher or equivalent levels of creativity than the published norms . Where stan - dard deviations and means were provided for the respective test norms , one - way ANOVAs were used to analyze statistical differences between the present four groups and the normative data . Where percentiles were included , respective samples of this study were compared with these normative percentiles . Table 2 compares normative data with the means and standard deviations of the sample data . The Purdue Creativity Test normative data included the scores associated with each percentile , but did not provide means and standard devia - tions . The creativity scores at the 5th , 50th , and 95th percentiles for our four groups were com - pared with the 5th , 50th , and 95th percentiles’ Purdue Creativity Test normative data . The CRT did not have available normative data . CPS A one - way ANOVA indicated a significant dif - ference among engineers , musicians and CPS norms , F ( 2 ) ¼ 23 . 36 , p ¼ . 000 . Tukey posthoc analysis indicated that only the male musicians Table 1 .

Purdue Creativity Test The Purdue Creativity Test Technical Manual provided values of scores at selected percentiles but did not include other descriptive statistics .

General , Artistic , Scientific Creativity Creativity Research Journal 219 females 5th ( 20 . 00 ) , 50th ( 68 . 00 ) , and 95th ( 137 . 75 ) . In the absence of statistical tests , all four groups tended to be lower than the norms at the 5th percentile , higher than the norms at 50th per - centile , and clearly seemed to be higher at the 95th percentile . In our study , all four groups tended to cover a wider range than did the norm group . At both extremes ( 5th and 95th percen - tiles ) , all four groups tended to cover a more expansive range : both lower and higher than the norms , respectively . Comparison of Specializations Within Each of the Two Majors Attempts were made to detect possible differ - ences across specializations within each of the two majors , Engineering and Music . This was done because , as noted above in the literature review , it seems plausible that some engineers might be expected to be more creative than other engineers , and that some musicians might be more creative than other musicians . However , our orig - inal attempts to find independent indicators of expected levels of creativity yielded somewhat con - tradictory views . Thus , we decided to detect whether specializations within each of the majors might show differences in creativity . Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for differ - ences among engineering specialization groups ( electrical , mechanical , and civil = environmental = chemical = marine ) , and among music specializa - tions ( education , jazz = composition , opera = performance = voice , and Other : therapy = technology ) . Groups were identified based on similarities in content and sample sizes per group . For the three general creativity measures , separate two - way MANOVAs were calculated examining the effect of specialization within each major in terms of general creativity measures ( CPS , CT , and CRT ) . No significant effect was found for engineering specializations , Lambda ( 6 , 176 ) ¼ 1 . 05 , p ¼ . 398 , nor for music specializa - tions , Lambda ( 9 , 173 ) ¼ 1 . 63 , p ¼ . 111 . For engineering and music creativity , separate two - way ANOVAs were calculated , respectively , across music specializations and across engineer - ing specializations in terms of music creativity ( HIRR ) .

Demographic Characteristics of Participants Levels of general , artistic , and scientific crea - tivity were investigated in regard to demographic characteristics ( gender , ethnicity , and age ) . Sepa - rate MANOVAs were used to investigate demographics ( gender , ethnicity , and age ) inde - pendently . A MANOVA was used to detect differ - ences between engineering and music students in each demographic attribute separately ( gender , ethnicity , or age ) in three creativity measures ( creative attributes , creative temperament , and cognitive risk tolerance ) . Separate ANOVAs were used to detect differences in engineering and music majors for artistic ( HIRR ) , and engineering creativity ( Purdue Creativity Test ) within each separate demographic variable ( gender , ethnicity , or age ) .

Age . Table 5 provides descriptive statistics for differences within each major ( engineering and music ) across age groups ( 18 – 20 , 21 – 25 , 26 – 30 and 31 þ ) , based on sample sizes per group . A two - way MANOVA was calculated examining the effect of age groups ( 18 – 20 , 21 – 25 , 26 – 30 and 31 þ ) on general creativity measures ( CPS , CT , CRT ) ; no significant effect was found , Lambda ( 9 , 453 ) ¼ . 52 , p ¼ . 864 . A two - way ANOVA was cal - culated comparing age ( 18 – 20 , 21 – 25 , 26 – 30 and 31 þ ) in music creativity ( HIRR ) ; no significant difference was found , F ( 3 ) ¼ 1 . 25 , p ¼ . 293 . A two - way ANOVA calculated comparing age groups ( 18 – 20 , 21 – 25 , 26 – 30 and 31 þ ) on engin - eering creativity ( Purdue Creativity Test ) revealed no significant differences ( F ( 3 ) ¼ . 88 , p ¼ . 452 ) . Instrument Correlations Correlations among the instruments were conducted to identify their relationships with each other . Table 5 shows that the CPS , CT and CRT are moderately related to each other ( r ¼ (cid:1) . 35 , p < . 01 , r ¼ . 34 , p < . 01 , r ¼ . 36 , p < . 01 ) . The HIRR had very low correlations with the other instruments . The Purdue Creativity test had slightly lower correlations with the general creativ - ity measures than were the correlations among the general creativity measures . Discussion Our first research question concerned differ - ences between engineers and musicians in terms of general , artistic , and scientific creativity . First , as anticipated , the musicians had statistically higher levels in all three attributes of general crea - tivity : creative attributes , creative temperament , and cognitive risk tolerance . However , the average scores on all three measures of general creativity were not exceptionally different for engineers ver - sus musicians . Second , as anticipated , musicians had higher levels of music creativity than did engi - neers . However , again the differences between these two groups were modest . Third , although we anticipated that engineers would have higher levels of scientific creativity than musicians , there was no significant difference between groups on this variable . As was noted above , various authors ( Helson , 1996 ; Kersting , 2003 ; Simonton , 1999 ) have contended or suggested that artists have higher creativity levels than do scientists and engineers . But the present findings , although showing statisti - cally significant differences on some measures , do not indicate that there are substantial creativity differences between engineers and musicians . Thus , it seems reasonable to explore whether some engineers or scientists may have higher levels of creativity , using the present measures , or through other measures . Based on the present results , and consistent with conclusions by Larson , Thomas , and Leviness ( 1999 ) , there are serious questions about ( a ) the extent to which existing mea - sures adequately detect creativity types and levels among engineers and ( b ) whether we have been able to identify or designate where differences among engineers or engineering specializa - tions may reflect need for creativity .

Snelbecker 222 Creativity Research Journal instruments yet to be developed may actually reveal higher levels of engineering creativity than are reflected in the present study . Analyses for the second research question showed that both engineers and musicians had higher than respective norm groups regarding general , artistic and scientific creativity . There were some within - major across - gender differences on some creativity variables . Male engineers and musicians had higher levels of creativity tem - perament than the normative data , but female engineers’ and musicians’ levels of creativity tem - perament were not higher than the norms . Male musicians ( but not male engineers ) , as well as female engineers and female musicians , had signifi - cantly higher artistic ( music ) creativity than the norms . Like Gordon’s ( 2000 ) results with college students , our college students ( engineers and musi - cians ) had higher means than Gordon’s ( 1998 ) high school student norm data regarding music creativity . Only percentile data ( but not means or standard deviation data ) were available for the Purdue Creativity Test norms , thus limiting the kinds of comparisons that could be done . The engineers ( as well as the musicians ) had particularly high levels and a wider range of engin - eering creativity as compared with normative information . However , it must be noted that the most recent Purdue Creativity Test norm data that are available were published in 1960 ; thus we don’t know whether updated norms would or would not be different today . The third research question addressed potential differences with each major ( within the engineer group and within the musician group ) . Feist ( 1998 ) suggested that there is a need to investigate whether there may be within - group differences in creativity . Larson , Thomas , and Leviness ( 1999 ) found that some types of engineers exhibited higher levels of creativity than other engineers . In the present study , no differences were detec - ted across engineering specializations or across musician specializations . Our fourth research question concerned potential creativity differences as a function of demographic characteristics ( gender , ethnicity , and age ) among engineers and musicians . No sig - nificant differences were detected in general , artis - tic , or scientific creativity between males and females , or across age groups . These findings contradict former statements by Greenacre ( 1960 ) that females tend to have inferior creativity abilities . The present results support more recent findings of Hassler , Nieschlag , and de la Motte ( 1990 ) , indicating that females display equivalent levels of creativity with their male counterparts . Our study indicated that Caucasians had signifi - cantly higher levels of general creativity than min - ority groups . However , Caucasians and minorities did not differ in relation to music creativity levels . Through our literature reviews , we did not find other previous studies with which we could compare our findings about general , artistic , and scientific creativity regarding age and ethnicity , specifically . Relationships were examined among measures of the creativity variables addressed in this study . Relationships between the creative personality and the creative temperament measures are of interest for practical , as well as conceptual , reasons because they often have been used to measure creativity in studies through administration of the CPI or the ACL ( Feist , 1998 ; Feist & Barron , 2003 ; Gough , 1979 ; Gough & Bradley , 2002 ; Helson , 1996 ; Helson , Roberts , & Agronick , 1995 ) . The moderate correlation between these two measures suggests that researchers might obtain different results , depending on which measure is used . Additionally , it is of interest that cognitive risk tolerance was correlated with these two variables at about the same level that CPS and CPT are correlated with each other . We pro - pose that cognitive risk tolerance may be a component of general creativity that is likely to be moderately related to , but different from , other general creativity measures . Other relationships among the creativity are also reported but did not seem to reveal any particularly important information . Conclusions and Implications The present authors agree with Simonton’s ( 1999 ) concern that ‘‘researchers often treat creativity as a single , relatively homogenous phenomenon’’ ( p . 639 ) . Our study was founded on the premises that ( a ) creativity may involve General , Artistic , Scientific Creativity Creativity Research Journal 223 different types ( general , artistic , and scientific creativity ) , ( b ) certain types of creativity may be different across different professional groups ( engineers and musicians ) or domains , ( c ) some forms of creativity may exist generally without regard to domain , and ( d ) it is important to include both general and specific measures of creativity when comparing professional groups and other groups of people in society . It should be noted that the present study did not address measures of creative products or performance measures , but rather focused on attitudes and views that can be useful indicators of differing levels of creativity among people , both within and across domains . The present authors propose that CRT may constitute a necessary and useful addition to usual conceptions and measures of general creativity . It is noteworthy that engineering and music faculty members emphasized both the need for and interest in assessing creativity within their respective domains . The present authors attempted to find the most appropriate , reliable , and valid instruments that were available . The instruments that were selected did provide some useful infor - mation , but experiences during this study also raise questions about the status of these instru - ments and other currently available creativity measures . Music creativity did not seem to be as closely related to the other creativity measures as had been expected . Similarly engineering creativity had significant yet low correlations with the general creativity measures . The fact that there were no statistically signi - ficant differences between engineers and musicians in terms of engineering creativity is puzzling . The present study’s results may accurately reflect the nature of these types of creativity and their interrelationships . However , it is also plausible that the existing instruments were simply not adequate for assessing engineering and music creativity . For example , existing measures may not adequately detect the kinds of creativity that are very important for design engineers , which may be different or the same across engineering subdomains and specializations . Problems and limitations encountered during the present study indicate the need for instruments that , respectively , address music creativity and engineering creativity both within those domains and in multiple domain areas . The need for asses - sing engineering creativity and for assessing music creativity still exist , both for practical reasons and for understanding the nature of creativity in all of its forms .
