Recently , membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and endosomes have emerged as important players in endosomal protein sorting , dynamics and motility . Here , we show that PDZD8 , a Synaptotagmin - like Mitochondrial lipid - binding Proteins ( SMP ) domain - containing ER transmembrane protein , utilizes distinct domains to interact with Rab7 - GTP and the ER transmembrane protein Protrudin and together these components localize to an ER - late endosome MCS . At these ER - late endosome MCSs , mitochondria are also recruited to form a three - way contact . Thus , our data indicate that PDZD8 is a shared component of two distinct MCSs and suggest a role for SMP - mediated lipid transport in the regulation of endosome function . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 OPEN 1 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of California Davis , Davis , CA , USA . 2 National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules , CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules , Institute of Biophysics , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , China . 3 College of Life Sciences , University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , China . 4 Department of Biomolecular Sciences , Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot , Israel . 5 Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry , Tel - Aviv University , Tel Aviv - Yafo , Israel . 6 Present address : Department of Molecular Genetics , Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot , Israel . 7 These authors contributed equally : Yuting Guo , Nadav Segev , Michal Harel . ✉ email : yael . elbaz . alon @ gmail . com ; jmnunnari @ ucdavis . edu NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3645 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; T he endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a vast organelle that extends throughout the cell and has a central role in pro - tein biogenesis , and lipid and ion homeostasis . To conduct these functions , the ER forms physical contacts with essentially all other membranous organelles through membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) . MCSs are regions where the membranes of two orga - nelles are brought into close apposition ( 10 – 30 nm ) by a protei - naceous tether to form subdomains that specialize in non - vesicular lipid transfer and ion transfer , and function as signaling hubs and in the control of organelle dynamics 1 – 4 . Several types of ER MCSs between the ER and membranes of the endocytic pathway have been identi ﬁ ed 5 – 7 . The endocytic pathway functions to control the fate of material that enters cells via endocytosis and thus governs many cellular and physiological processes , including immunity , signaling , nutrient availability , and organelle quality control 8 . The membrane compartments that arise from the fusion of endocytic vesicles are collectively known as endosomes , which undergo a process of maturation and spe - cialization from early to late endosomes and to lysosomes to promote protein sorting and degradation 8 . Endosomal matura - tion requires the sequential recruitment and activation of Rab GTPases , which function as molecular switches that cycle between the GDP and GTP bound state in a spatially and tem - porally regulated manner via GTPase - activating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors . The Rab switch involves the coordinated dissociation of Rab5 on early endosomes and recruitment and activation of Rab7 , which drives the biogenesis of late endosomes via interactions with its large number of inter - actors / effectors . The Rab switch is coupled to endosomal acid - i ﬁ cation and lipid composition remodeling , including PIP lipids , which transition from an early endosome enrichment of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P2 and recruit speci ﬁ c subsets of proteins to drive endo - somal maturation 8 , 9 . PI ( 3 ) P synthesis is mediated by the Beclin1 - Vps15 - Vps34 complex ( PI3K complex ) , which is recruited by Rab5 10 , 11 . As endosomes mature , PI ( 3 ) P is converted into PI ( 3 , 5 ) P2 by the PIKFYVE kinase that is recruited through its PI ( 3 ) P - binding FYVE - domain , and phosphatases of the myotubularin ( MTM ) family are also recruited via a FYVE - domain to deplete PI ( 3 ) P 12 , 13 . In addition , PIP conversion is regulated by the Rab7 effector , WDR91 , which is recruited to late endosomes , where it inhibits PI3K activity , preventing the generation of PI ( 3 ) P , to promote early to late endosomal maturation 14 . ER - endosome MCSs have emerged as regulators of endosomal function and behavior , including endosomal dynamics , posi - tioning , and motility 5 , 7 , 15 , 16 and the propensity to form ER - endosome MCS increases as endosomes mature 17 . Several com - ponents of ER - endosome MCSs have been described . These include members of the family of ER integral VAMP - associated proteins ( VAPs ) , which participate in diverse ER - MCSs via their ability to interact with proteins containing a short FFAT motif 5 , 6 , 15 . VAPs interact with multiple proteins at the ER - endosomal membrane contact site , including the cholesterol transfer proteins STARD3 18 and ORP1L 19 , 20 , which sense and regulate the ﬂ ow of cholesterol to and from the ER via non - vesicular transport activity . ER - late endosome MCSs also serve to integrate the motility of late endosomes on microtubules with cellular status , such as cholesterol levels , by regulating their association with the plus and minus end motors , kinesin - 1 and dynein , respectively 15 , 19 – 22 . Rab7 controls this bidirectional endosome movement through the recruitment of adapters for dynein and kinesin - 1 , RILP and FYCO1 , respectively 19 , 23 , 24 . At ER - late endosome MCSs , under conditions of low cholesterol , cytosolic ORP1L engages with GTP - Rab7 on late endosomes and VAPs at the ER and negatively regulates the association of late endosomes with the minus end Dynein microtubule motor complex 20 , 21 . ER - endosomal MCSs also positively regulate plus - ended microtubule endosomal transport via the ER protein Protrudin . Protrudin localizes to endosomal membranes via interactions with both endosomal PIP lipids and Rab7 , where it also interacts with VAPs via an FFAT motif 22 , 25 . At ER - late endosomes MCSs , Protrudin is thought to promote the associa - tion of kinesin - 1 with FYCO1 to mediate transport of late endosomes to plus end of microtubules 22 . Thus , a picture is emerging in which a diverse set of ER - endosome MCSs create microdomains at the endosomal surface that integrate cellular status with the spatiotemporal regulation of endosomal dynamics , maturation , and motility 3 , 15 , 26 . Here we report an ER - late endosomal contact site comprised of the multi - domain integral ER proteins , PDZD8 , which is a Synaptotagmin - like Mitochondrial lipid - binding Proteins ( SMP ) domain - containing protein , and Protrudin , and the late endoso - mal Rab GTPase , Rab7 . Structure - function analysis indicates that distinct domains of PDZD8 mediate interactions with Protrudin and Rab7 and that PDZD8 and Protrudin are independently recruited to ER - late endosome MCSs . PDZD8 was previously identi ﬁ ed as a component of an ER - mitochondria MCS , although the identity of its mitochondrial partner is not known 27 . Con - sistent with this , we also observe that mitochondria can be recruited to PDZD8 - enriched ER microdomains at ER - late endosome MCSs to form a three - way contact . Our observations are consistent with the idea that ER - late endosomal contact sites are dynamic plastic structures that regulate endosomal behavior . Results PDZD8 binds Protrudin and is recruited to late endosomes . The ER protein , PDZD8 , was recently identi ﬁ ed as an ER - mitochondria membrane contact site protein , however , the molecular nature of this MCS is not known 27 . To address this and further investigate the mechanism of action of PDZD8 , we identi ﬁ ed interacting proteins by mass spectrometry based ana - lysis of endogenous PDZD8 , isolated from crosslinked human HCT116 cell extracts using validated anti - PDZD8 antibodies 28 . Mass spectrometry analysis of crosslinked endogenous PDZD8 immunopuri ﬁ cations revealed that the predominant interactor was Protrudin , an integral ER protein previously shown to reside at ER - late endosome MCSs 22 ( Fig . 1a , left panel ; list provided in Supplementary Dataset 1 ) . Consistently , mass spectrometry analysis of reciprocal immunopuri ﬁ cations of endogenous Pro - trudin from crosslinked cell extracts using a validated anti - Protrudin antibody revealed that its predominant interactor was PDZD8 ( Fig . 1a , right panel ; list provided in Supplementary Dataset 2 ) . Immunoprecipitation and western analysis of extracts from HEK293 cells co - overexpressing PDZD8 - GFP and Protrudin - mCherry also indicated that these components inter - act , which further validated the PDZD8 - Protrudin interaction detected using antibodies directed against the endogenous tag - less versions of these proteins ( Fig . 1b ) . Thus , our data indicate that PDZD8 and Protrudin interact in cells . Published work indicates that Protrudin localizes to ER - late endosome MCSs primarily via its PIP lipid - binding FYVE domain , where it functions to facilitate the regulation of endosomal motility 22 , 29 . Given the stable interaction we observed between Protrudin and PDZD8 , we considered whether PDZD8 was also recruited to endosomal MCSs . To address this question , we transiently transfected GFP - tagged PDZD8 and performed live - imaging of GFP - tagged PDZD8 ( PDZD8 - GFP ) in human U2OS cells . For all live - cell imaging of transiently expressed tagged constructs , we transfected cells with the minimal amount of plasmid suf ﬁ cient for microscopy detection to avoid protein overexpression artifacts . Under these conditions , we estimate that PDZD8 - GFP was ~ 10 - fold overexpressed compared to ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3645 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications endogenous protein ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . PDZD8 - GFP primarily localized diffusely in the ER ( Fig . 1c ; whole - cell projection ) , however , at a lower frequency , we also observed PDZD8 - GFP localized at a signi ﬁ cantly higher intensity to spherical structures , suggesting an enrichment of PDZD8 at speci ﬁ c ER subdomains ( Fig . 1c ; single plane image ) . We co - overexpressed PDZD8 - GFP with mCherry tagged markers of early endosomes ( Rab5 ) , late endosomes ( Rab7 ) , and lysosomes ( LAMP1 ) to test whether these PDZD8 - enriched subdomains were associated with endosomes . PDZD8 - GFP did not co - localize with either Rab5 or LAMP1 - labeled endosomal structures ( Fig . 2a ) . In contrast , in cells co - expressing PDZD8 and Rab7 , we observed that PDZD8 - GFP spheres co - localized with mCherry - Rab7 - labeled endosomes and that there was a sig - ni ﬁ cant increase in the number of PDZD8 - GFP labeled spheres per cell , as compared to the diffusely ER - localized and relatively rare PDZD8 - GFP spheres observed in cells overexpressing PDZD8 alone ( compare Fig . 1c with Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 2 , 2 . 5 ± 1 . 5 per cell compared to 65 . 7 ± 27 . 4 per cell , n = 20 cells ) . To test whether Rab7 - colocalized PDZD8 spheres re ﬂ ected the recruitment of PDZD8 - GFP enriched ER co - localized with late endosomes , we imaged cells co - expressing PDZD8 - GFP and mCherry - Rab7 and the general ER marker , BFP - Sec61 β . Con - sistently , at regions of co - localization of PDZD8 - GFP with mCherry - Rab7 - labeled endosomes , we also observed BFP - Sec61 β - labeled ER spheres tightly associated with late endosomes ( Fig . 2b ) . Although the increased number of PDZD8 - enriched ER subdomains associated with late endosomes was dependent on overexpressing both PDZD8 and Rab7 ( Figs . 1c and 2a , and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , endogenous PDZD8 in U2OS cells , as detected by indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence of PDZD8 , using a validated anti - PDZD8 antibody 28 , was also observed in spherical structures , and in cells overexpressing Rab7 - mCherry PDZD8 - structures colocalized with Rab7 - labeled endosomes ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In addition , we observed that Rab7 peptides were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in immunopuri ﬁ cations from crosslinked cellular fractions of endogenous PDZD8 and Protrudin , ( Fig . 2d ) . These data suggest that ER - associated PDZD8 is recruited to late endosomes in a Rab7 - dependent manner . 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 Intensity plot 2 Distance ( μ m ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 Intensity plot 1 Distance ( μ m ) R e l a t i v e ﬂ uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y Z - stack projection Single plane 1 2 PDZD8 - GFP PDZD8 - GFP Mitochondria Merge c – – 1 – + 2 + + 3 – – 4 – + 5 + + 6 Total kDa - 170 - 72 - 43 α GFP - IP pCMV - PDZD8 - GFP pCMV - Protrudin - mCh PDZD8 - GFP Protrudin - mCh Actin – Log S t uden t ’ s T - t e s t p - v a l ue – Log S t uden t ’ s T - t e s t p - v a l ue 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 – 12 – 10 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 – 12 – 10 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 Log2 ratio ( control - bait ) Log2 ratio ( control - bait ) Protrudin PDZD8 Protrudin PDZD8 PDZD8 Protrudin b a Fig . 1 PDZD8 interacts with Protrudin and is enriched in ER subdomains . a Endogenous PDZD8 and Protrudin interact .

Activated GTP - bound Rab7 is recruited to the late endosome membrane and recruits additional proteins to the membrane that act as effectors and control endosomal maturation and motility 9 . We further tested the role of Rab7 in recruiting PDZD8 - enriched ER domains to endosomes by assessing the guanine nucleotide speci ﬁ city of Rab7 in PDZD8 endosome recruitment . ER - localized PDZD8 was recruited to endosomes in cells expressing the constitutively GTP - bound Rab7Q67L , but not the GDP - bound Rab7T22N ( Fig . 2e ) .

Together these data indicate that ER - localized PDZD8 is recruited to late endosomes in a manner dependent on GTP - activated Rab7 . These observations are consistent with a recent study published while this work was in review reporting that PDZD8 and Rab7 - GTP are enriched at ER - late endosome contact sites 30 . Distinct PDZD8 domains bind Protrudin and late endosomes . We exploited the increased number of PDZD8 - enriched ER subdomains associated with late endosomes under conditions of co - overexpression of PDZD8 and Rab7 to robustly determine the PDZD8 domains important for ER recruitment to endosomes . Given that PDZD8 is a multidomain containing protein , we generated and analyzed truncated versions of PDZD8 - GFP with different domain compositions ( Fig . 3a , schematic ) . As expected , expression of truncated constructs containing the single N - terminal transmembrane ( TM ) domain were localized to the ER in cells whereas constructs lacking the TM were localized to the cytosol ( Fig . 3b , Δ CC : 1 - 1000 , Δ C1 Δ CC : 1 - 470 and TM + SMP : 1 - 300 versus Δ TM : 27 - 1154 , Δ TM Δ SMP : 300 - 1154 , C1CC : 800 - 1154 , SMP + PDZ : 27 - 470 , and SMP : 90 - 300 , respectively ) . However , in the absence of the TM , constructs containing the C1 and coiled - coil domains were also localized to spherical structures in cells , similar to those observed at low frequency in cells overexpressing full length PDZD8 - GFP ( Figs . 1c and 3b , Δ TM : 27 - 1154 , Δ TM Δ SMP : 300 - 1154 , C1CC : 800 - 1154 ) . In contrast , constructs lacking the TM and the C1 and coiled - coil domains , were strictly localized in a diffuse manner in the cytosol ( Fig . 3b , SMP + PDZ : 27 - 470 , SMP : 90 - 300 ) . Expression of either the C1 : 800 - 1000 or CC : 1000 - 1154 regions was not detected in cells . Our obser - vations suggest that the C1CC : 800 - 1154 portion of PDZD8 is suf ﬁ cient for PDZD8 recruitment to late endosomes . Consistent with this , we observed that PDZD8 C1CC : 800 - 1154 co - localized with mCherry - Rab7 - labeled endosomes in cells ( Fig . 3b ) . In addition , the CC domain of PDZD8 was also necessary for the recruitment of PDZD8 to Rab7 - labeled late endosomes , as a construct lacking the CC domain localized diffusely to the ER membranes in cells under conditions of Rab7 overexpression ( Fig . 3b , Δ CC : 1 - 1000 ) . Consistent with this , we observed a decrease in the ef ﬁ ciency of co - immunoprecipitation of PDZD8 Δ CC with Rab7Q67L by western blot analysis ( Fig . 2f ) . Thus , our data suggest that recruitment of an ER PDZD8 subdomain to late endosomes is mediated via the PDZD8 C terminal C1 / CC regions in a GTP - Rab7 - dependent manner . Our results indicate that endogenous PDZD8 and Protrudin interact ( Fig . 1a ) . Protrudin has been previously shown to reside at ER - late endosome MCSs 22 . To test whether ER - localized PDZD8 and Protrudin are recruited together to late endosomes in Rab7 - dependent manner , we co - expressed BFP - Rab7 , PDZD8 - GFP , and Protrudin - mCherry in cells . Consistently , both PDZD8 - GFP and Protrudin - mCherry were co - localized with Rab7 - labeled late endosomes ( Fig . 4a ) . Thus , our results suggest that PDZD8 , Protrudin , and Rab7 interact together at ER subdomains associated with late endosomes in cells . We tested which domains of PDZD8 are required for its interaction with Protrudin using anti - GFP immunoprecipitations from HEK293T cells co - expressing PDZD8 - GFP constructs ( Fig . 3a , schematic ) and Protrudin - mCherry ( Fig . 4b ) . Consistent with the observed reciprocal interactions of endogenous PDZD8 and Protrudin in immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 1 ) , full - length overexpressed PDZD8 - GFP ef ﬁ ciently co - immunoprecipitated with Protrudin - Cherry ( Fig . 4b , compare no PDZD8 - GFP , lane 1 with ( full length ) - GFP , lane 2 ) from cell extracts . In contrast , PDZD8 constructs lacking the TM domain were not ef ﬁ ciently co - immunoprecipitated with Protrudin from cell extracts ( Fig . 4b , compare ( full length ) - GFP , lane 2 with ( 27 - 1154 ) - GFP and ( 27 - 470 - GFP ) , lanes 3 and 7 , respectively ) . The PDZD8 construct containing only the N - terminal TM and SMP domains was also ef ﬁ ciently co - immunoprecipitated with Protrudin ( Fig . 4b compare ( full length ) - GFP , lane 2 , with ( 1 - 300 ) - GFP , lane 4 ) . Given that this construct lacks the C1 and CC regions that were suf ﬁ cient for the recruitment of PDZD8 to endosomes ( Fig . 3b ) , this observation suggests that PDZD8 utilizes distinct domains for interacting with Protrudin and GTP - Rab7 - labeled late endosomes . These data also suggest that the PDZD8 - Rab7 - endosome interaction occurs in a Protrudin - independent manner : the PDZD8 construct lacking the TM domain failed to co - immunoprecipitate with Protrudin , but retained its ability to be recruited in a Rab7 - dependent manner to the late endosomal membrane ( Figs . 3b and 4b , compare ( full length ) - GFP , lane 2 , with ( 27 - 1154 ) - GFP , lane 3 ) and the PDZD8 1 - 1000 lacking the C - terminal CC domain ef ﬁ ciently co - immunoprecipitated with Protrudin , but failed to be recruited to endosomes in a Rab7 - dependent manner ( Figs . 3b and 4b , compare ( full length ) - GFP , lane 2 , with ( 1 - 1000 ) - GFP , lane 6 ) . To more directly test whether PDZD8 and Protrudin are independently recruited to late endosomes , we examined the localization of Protrudin - GFP in a previously characterized HeLa Fig . 2 PDZD8 - GFP interacts with GTP - Rab7 . a PDZD8 co - localizes with late endosomes .

This observation is consistent with our immunoprecipitation data indicating that PDZD8 lacking the CC region retained its ability to interact with Protrudin at the ER membrane ( Fig . 4b , lane 6 ) . Collectively , these results support a model where , at the ER membrane , PDZD8 and Protrudin interact and in ﬂ uence each others recruitment to late endosomes , but each can also be independently targeted to ER - late endosomes subdomains via Rab7 - GTP and PIP lipids , respectively . Mitochondria are recruited to PDZD8 - Rab7 contact sites . Membrane contact sites are unique cellular structures mediated by proteins in adjacent organelle membranes that tether orga - nelles in close proximity ( estimated 10 – 30 nm apart ) to enable non - vesicular transfer of lipids and solutes . To test whether the PDZD8 - GFP ER subdomains colocalized with Rab7 - labeled endosomes are bona - ﬁ de membrane contact sites , we analyzed regions of co - localization at high resolution using correlated light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) . In areas where PDZD8 - GFP and mCherry - Rab7 were co - localized , as inferred from the ﬂ uorescence signals , we observed regions of ER in contact with late endosomes , as evidenced by the presence of multivesicular bodies ( Fig . 5a inset 1 ) . In addition , the distance between the ER and late endosome membrane measured ~ 15 nm , characteristic of a membrane contact site ( Fig . 5a , inset 1 , arrow heads ) . Thus , our data indicate that the PDZD8 - GFP ER subdomains associated with late Rab7 - labeled endosomes represent ER - endosome membrane contact sites . In many regions of PDZD8 - GFP and mCherry - Rab7 co - localization , where we observed an ER - late endosome contact site , we also observed a mitochondrion ( Fig . 5a , inset 2 ) , whose shape was co - altered with associated ER adjacent to an endosome ( Fig . 5a , inset 3 ) . This observation suggests that PDZD8 - late endosomal MCSs may recruit mitochondria in cells . To further test this possibility , we assessed the proximity of mitochondria to Rab7 - labeled endosomes in U2OS cells overexpressing PDZD8 - GFP or PDZD8 Δ CC - GFP , which either contain or lack PDZD8 ER subdomains localized to Rab7 - labeled endosomes , respectively ( Fig . 3b ) . Mitochondrial proximity was quanti ﬁ ed by the number of overlaps observed between thresholded images of mCherry - Rab7 labeled late endosomes and mitochondria , labeled using Mitotracker Deep Red FM ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ; Supple - mentary Fig . 4 , left and right panels , respectively , representative thresholded images , n = 8 cells for each condition ) . Based on this analysis , cells expressing PDZD8 - GFP , had a higher fraction of the Rab7 - labeled endosomes in proximity to mitochondria as compared to cells expressing PDZD8 Δ CC - GFP ( Supplementary Fig . 4 , bottom panel ) . We also performed Grazing Incidence Structured Illumination Microscopy ( GI - SIM ) super resolution live - cell imaging and examined the relative movement of PDZD8 - labeled ER and Rab7 - labeled endosomes . Analysis of movement of Rab7 - labeled endosomes and the ER using either the general ER marker mEmerald - Sec61 β , PDZD8 - GFP or PDZD8 Δ CC - GFP revealed that PDZD8 - GFP , but not PDZD8 Δ CC - GFP overexpression , signi ﬁ cantly decreased endosome motility relative to endosomes in cells expressing mEmerald - Sec61 β , consistent with our observation that co - overexpression of PDZD8 and Rab7 results in the formation of multiple highly associated ER - endosomal regions in cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5 , temporally color - coded map over 50 s , upper panel : mEmerald - Sec61 β ; middle panel : PDZD8 - GFP ; lower panel : PDZD8 Δ CC - GFP , and corresponding Supplementary Movies M1 – M3 ) . In addition , GI - SIM imaging also indicated that PDZD8 - labeled ER subdomains associated with Rab7 - labeled endosome were stably localized adjacent to mitochondria ( Fig . 5b , arrows , and Supplementary Movie M2 ) , consistent with CLEM analysis ( Fig . 5a ) and proximity analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In total , our data suggest that over - expression of PDZD8 and Rab7 facilitates the formation of contacts between both ER - endosomes and ER - mitochondria in the context of a three way MCS , consistent with previous work indicating that PDZD8 is a component of an ER - mitochondria tether 27 . The Rab7 effector , WDR91 , marks PDZD8 - associated endo - somes . The early to late endosome maturation process consists of an intertwined complex series of steps , which include endosomal acidi ﬁ cation , a Rab5 to Rab7 switch , an interdependent conver - sion of membrane PIP from PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P2 and an alteration of the lipid composition as late endosomes become depleted in phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and rich in the unique phospholipid lysobisphosphatidic acid ( LBPA ) 31 – 33 . To gain insight into what endosomal maturation stage the PDZD8 - mediated ER - late endosome MCS forms , we co - expressed in U2OS cells PDZD8 - GFP and BFP - Rab7 with either mCherry - Rab5 or LAMP1 - mCherry . LAMP1 is a membrane protein that is targeted from the Golgi to lysosomes through a lysosomal targeting motif 34 . Rab7 and LAMP1 have been shown to co - localize on late endosomes and lysosomes 9 . In cells overexpressing both PDZD8 and Rab7 , however , Rab7 - labeled endosomes that possessed regions of associated PDZD8 - labeled ER were not labeled by LAMP1 ( Fig . 6a ) . When PDZD8 and Rab7 were co - expressed with the early endosomal marker Rab5 , the endosomal population that was labeled by PDZD8 and Rab7 also showed no overlap with Rab5 labeled early endosomes ( Fig . 6b ) . We next co - expressed PDZD8 - GFP and BFP - Rab7 with mCherry - WDR91 , a Rab7 effector that controls the phosphoinositide conversion step in endosomal maturation and serves as a marker for the PIP con - version step 35 . When co - expressed in cells , WDR91 and PDZD8 were localized together on late endosomes uniformly labeled with Rab7 in a mutually exclusive pattern ( Fig . 6c ) , which has not been previously observed for WDR91 35 . The localization of WDR91 and PDZD8 to the same population of late endosomes suggests that the PDZD8 ER - endosome MCS may form at an endosomal maturation stage during the PIP conversion step in which the Rab5 to Rab7 switch is complete . Although we do not know the mechanism underlying the mutually exclusive localization pattern of PDZD8 - GFP and mCherry - WDR91 associated with Rab7 - lableled endosomes , we exploited it to resolve the localization of mitochondria relative to the PDZD8 ER subdomains associated with Rab7 - labeled endo - somes . In cells co - expressing BFP - Rab7 , mCherry - WDR91 , and PDZD8 - GFP , mitochondria were observed more frequently in close proximity to the PDZD8 - associated portion of Rab7 - endosomes ( Fig . 6c , bottom panel ) . We analyzed the fraction of total BFP - Rab7 and Mitotracker pixels that overlapped , and then calculated how many of these pixels also overlapped with either PDZD8 - GFP or mCherry - WDR91 pixels ( Fig . S6 , magenta colored pixels in left and right panels , respectively ) . This analysis revealed that a majority of the contact area between Rab7 - labeled - endosomes and mitochondria occurs adjacent to PDZD8 - GFP co - localized with Rab7 - labeled endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 6 , bar graph ) , consistent with our previous observations ( Fig . 5 ) . GI - SIM live imaging of cells expressing mCherry - WDR91 , BFP - Rab7 , and PDZD8 - GFP supported this conclusion as mitochondria are persistently localized over time to portions of Rab7 - endosomes that are associated with PDZD8 - ER subdomains ( Supplementary ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3645 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Movie M4 ) . Thus , these data support the conclusion that mitochondria localize with PDZD8 ER subdomains associated with Rab7 - labeled endosomes in cells . Discussion The ER is the most extensive eukaryotic endomembrane system , spreading throughout the cell and connecting with virtually all other organelles via MSCs , which function as hubs to control and coordinate organellar functions with cell status 4 . Our results identify the ER membrane proteins , PDZD8 and Protrudin , together with the late endosomal protein Rab7 , as components of an ER - late endosome MCS in mammalian cells . In cells , over - expression of PDZD8 and Rab7 is suf ﬁ cient to increase the number contacts between the ER and late endosomes ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , suggesting that PDZD8 and Rab7 are parts of an active MCS tether , as de ﬁ ned by the community of scientists working on membrane contact sites 36 . Our data suggest a model where this ER - late endosome contact site is created via an interaction between the C1 and CC regions of the ER - anchored PDZD8 and GTP - Rab7 ( Figs . 3 and 6d ) .

Thus , our data support a model in which PDZD8 utilizes its distinct domains to separately interact with Rab7 - endosomes and with Protrudin . Although PDZD8 can recruit Protrudin to Rab7 - endosomes , Protrudin is also independently recruited to endosomes via its FYVE region , presumably via an interaction with PI ( 3 ) P 22 . We speculate that this redundant , but interdependent PDZD8 - Protrudin - Rab7 - late endosome interaction network serves to form a highly speci ﬁ c and regulatable ER - late endosome MCS .

Another proposed ER - late endosome tether is composed of the ER protein ORP5 and the endosomal mem - brane protein NPC1 37 . The relative roles each of these pre - sumably distinct tethers play at the ER - late endosome remains an outstanding question . Future work is required to understand the functional role of the ER PDZD8 - Protrudin / Rab7 - endosome MCS . One possibility is that this MCS functions to promote endosomal maturation . This is potentially supported by the co - localization of the Rab7 effector WDR91 , which facilitates the conversion of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P during maturation , on the population of PDZD8 / Pro - trudin / Rab7 - labeled endosomes , which also lack LAMP1 , a marker that localizes to Rab7 endosomes at a later maturation stage . The PDZD8 - mediated ER - late endosome MCS forms selectively with activated GTP - Rab7 , which suggests that it is dynamic , and temporally regulated during maturation . Maturing endosomes undergo dramatic changes in membrane composition such as the depletion of phosphatidylserine from late endosomes and the enrichment of LBPA 32 , 33 . PDZD8 is one of only six proteins in the human proteome that harbors a Synaptotagmin - like Mitochondrial lipid - binding Proteins ( SMP ) domain . SMP domain proteins characterized to date have been shown to loca - lize exclusively to membrane contact sites in human cells , as well as in yeast 38 , 39 and structural analyses indicate a general role of SMP domain proteins in interorganellar phospholipid transfer 39 . Thus , it is possible that PDZD8 functions in phospholipid transfer , similar to all characterized SMP domain proteins , to promote endosomal maturation . Protrudin is thought to control late endosome motility by facilitating the transfer of kinesin - 1 from the ER to late endosomes 22 . Our mass spectrometry analysis of immunopuri ﬁ ed endogenous Protrudin supports previous reports of its interactions with kinesin - 1 and the VAP family proteins ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Dataset 2 ) . Thus , it is also possible that ER PDZD8 - Protrudin / Rab7 - endosome MCS func - tions to regulate late endosomal motility and distribution , which is intimately linked to endosomal maturation . PDZD8 has been suggested recently to mediate the formation of ER - mitochondria contact sites 27 , although the mitochondrial partner is yet unknown . Our data are consistent with PDZD8 as an ER - mitochondrial tether : high resolution CLEM , and ﬂ uor - escence microscopy ( FM ) , including super - resolution GI - SIM analyses suggest that mitochondria are recruited to the PDZD8 ER subdomain associated with Rab7 - endosomes . The signi ﬁ cance of this observation at present is not clear . It is possible that the relatively high concentration of PDZD8 on the ER subdomain associated with Rab7 endosomes observed under our over - expression conditions drives via mass action the interaction with mitochondria . Alternatively , but not exclusively , the endosome may somehow be required for the formation of a PDZD8 - dependent ER - mitochondria contact , which would suggest a role for mitochondria in endosomal function / maturation . It is also possible that PDZD8 ’ s lipid transfer domain may function as a conduit for phospholipid transfer between the ER , endosomes , and mitochondria to drive endosomal maturation . Our observation of two contact sites serving to link three organelles suggests a mechanism for interorganellar communication . Methods Mammalian cell growth and transfection .

In all , 10mg of total protein per sample were diluted in lysis buffer to a 1 - ml volume and used as starting material for each pull - down condition . In total , 2 μ g of appropriate anti - body were added to the lysate and incubated in constant rotation for 1h at 4°C , 100 μ l mMACS ™ protein G magnetic microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) were added and incubated for 4h at 4°C . Columns were placed in the Multi ™ MACS M96 separator , equilibrated in lysis buffer , then pull - down samples were loaded onto columns and let ﬂ ow . Columns were washed ﬁ ve times in 500 μ l wash buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 50mM Tris - Cl pH7 . 5 ) . Elution of samples from column was achieved through on - column trypsinization by 30 min incubation in 25 μ l Elution buffer I ( 2M Urea , 50mM Tris - Cl pH7 . 5 , 1mM DTT , 5mg / ml Trypsin ) , followed by the addition of 100 μ l Elution buffer II ( 2M Urea , 50 mM Tris - Cl pH7 . 5 , 5mM Chloroacetamide ) . Eluate was collected in a new tube and allowed continued trypsin digestion overnight . Peptide were acidi ﬁ ed with TFA followed by puri ﬁ cation on C18 stageTips 40 . Peptides were then loaded onto 50 - cm - long EASY - spray PepMap columns ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) and separated using a 140 - min gradient of buffer A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid ) and 7 – 28 % buffer B ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) on the EASY - nLC1000 UHPLC system ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) that was coupled to the Q - Exactive Plus or HF mass spectrometers ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) 41 via the EASY - Spray ionization source . All MS measurements were done in a data - dependent mode using a top - 10 method . Data were acquired using Xcalibur software ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . Raw MS ﬁ les were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1 . 5 . 6 . 9 and the Andromeda search engine . MS / MS spectra were searched against the UniprotKB ( version 2016 _ 04 ) database . All statistical tests and calculations were done using the Perseus software 42 on the label free quanti ﬁ cation ( LFQ ) intensity values after log2 transformation 43 . Data analysis was performed for each pull down separately after ﬁ ltering for valid values in at least two samples of the pull down group . Data were imputed based on the assumption that missing values indicate low abundance ; missing values were replaced with random values that create a Gaussian distribution with a downshift of 1 . 6 or 1 . 7 standard deviations and a width of 0 . 4 of the original distribution . To identify potential interactors one - sided Student ’ s t test was performed between the control and each pull down with permutation - based FDR q value < 0 . 05 and S0 = 0 . 1 44 . The proteomic datasets that support these analyses are available in the PRoteomics IDEnti ﬁ cations ( PRIDE ) database via ProteomeXchange with identi ﬁ er PXD015523 . Sample preparation for correlative light and electron microscopy . Samples were prepared for electron microscopy as previously described in 45 with minor modi ﬁ cations . In brief , U2OS cells ( ATCC ) were seeded on 3 - mm carbon - coated sapphire disks ( Wohlwend GmbH , Switzerland ) and allowed to settle for 12 – 18 h . The cells were transfected as described above and ﬁ xed by high pressure freezing ( HPF ) using the Leica EM ICE ( Leica Microsystems GmbH , Germany ) . For HPF , the cells were washed in FluoroBrite - DMEM media ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) supplemented , with 20 % FBS ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , as cryo - protectant and placed between two aluminum planchettes ( Wohlwend GmbH , Switzerland ; Part : # 242 and # 389 ) . Freeze - substitution and resin embedding were performed using a temperature - controlled device , AFS2 ( Leica Microsystems GmbH , Germany ) as previously described in McDonald et al . 46 . In brief , the HPF - ﬁ xed samples were placed in 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate in dry acetone at − 90 °C for 10h . The temperature was then raised to − 45 °C ( 5 °C / h ) , and held for 5h followed by three acetone washes . In ﬁ ltration with Lowicryl HM20 ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , USA ) was carried out with increasing concentrations of 10 % , 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % , for 2h each . In ﬁ ltration with 10 % and 25 % was performed at − 45 °C , and at 50 % and 75 % temperature was raised to − 35 °C and − 25 °C , respectively ( 5°C / hour ) . Next , temperature was held at − 25 °C for 30 h with 3 exchanges of 100 % Lowicryl HM20 every 10 h , followed by polymerization of the resin under UV for additional 48h at − 25°C . The temperature was then raised to 20°C ( 5°C / h ) , and further polymerization of the resin under UV for 12 h . In all , 500 - nm - thick sections were cut using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems GmbH , Germany ) mounted with a diamond knife ( Diatome , Biel , Switzerland ) and picked onto carbon - coated 200 mesh copper EM grids ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hat ﬁ eld , PA ) . 50nm TetraSpeck microspheres ( diluted 1 : 160 in PBS ; Life Technologies ) , serving as ﬁ ducial markers for the correlation , were absorbed to the sections by placing the EM grids onto a 10µl drop for 10 min , followed by three washes in DDW . Fluorescence microscopy of resin embedded samples . Imaging of EM grids by FM prior to electron tomography acquisition was performed as described in Kukulski et al . 47 . The EM grids were placed on a drop of water sandwiched between two glass coverslips ( Menzel - Gläser , # 1 . 5 ) , sealed with grease , and imaged with the sections facing toward the objective in an Olympus IX83 ﬂ uorescence microscope controlled via VisiView software ( Visitron Systems GmbH ) and equipped with CoolLED pE - 4000 light source ( CoolLED Ltd . , UK ) , an UAPON 100 ×1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective , and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera ( Pho - tometrics ) . Fluorescence excitation and emission were detected using ﬁ lter - sets 470 / 40 nm and 525 / 50nm for GFP , 560 / 40nm and 630 / 75 nm for mCherry , and 620 / 60 nm and 700 / 75 nm MitoTracker Deep Red FM ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Electron tomography . Electron tomography ( ET ) was performed as previously described 48 Tomographic ﬁ ducial markers ( 15 nm protein A - coupled gold beads ) were adsorbed to both sides of the EM grids . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images for correlation , and Scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) tilt series were acquired using a Tecnai F20 ( Thermo Fischer Scienti ﬁ c ) at 200 kV , using SerialEM 49 . The TEM images for correlation were acquired at 4 . 47 nm pixel size using an UltraScan 4000 camera ( Gatan ) . Tilt series were acquired over a 60° to − 60° tilt range ( 1° increment ) at 1 . 67nm pixel size in nanoprobe mode using the bright - ﬁ eld detector , with a 10 - µm C2 aperture and 320 mm camera length . The tomograms were reconstructed using IMOD software package ( versions 4 . 9 . 4 ) 50 . Correlations of ﬂ uorescence and TEM images were performed using the ec - CLEM plugin with the Icy software 51 . Immunoprecipitation analysis for cellular protein interactions . HEK293 cells were seeded in 6 - well plates and transiently transfected as described above . Eigh - teen hours post transfection cells were scraped and washed once in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Cell pellet was lysed for one hour at 4°C in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris - Cl pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , protease inhi - bitors and either 1 % Lauryl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol ( LMNG ; Anatrace ) or 0 . 5 % Triton x - 100 . Lysate was then spun 10min at 8000× g , 4°C and pellet discarded . Lysate was incubated with 15µl GFP - Trap ® agarose beads ( ChromoTek ) for two hours in rotation at 4°C . Agarose beads were then washed three times in buffer containing 50mM Tris - Cl pH7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl and 0 . 1 % LMNG or 0 . 1 % Triton x - 100 . Protein was eluted from beads by incubating in 50 µl Laemmli sample buffer at 70°C for 15 min . Samples from lysate ( input ) and eluate ( pull - down ) were loaded on either 4 – 20 % mini - PROTEAN ® ( Bio - Rad ) or 9 % Laemmli gels 52 and separated using SDS - PAGE . Proteins were detected using western blot . Brie ﬂ y , proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans - Blot ® - Turbo ™ system ( Bio - Rad ) , followed by blocking in SEA BLOCK buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Membrane was then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C , washed three times in TBST , stained with secondary antibody , washed three times in TBST then once in PBS . Signal was detected using the LI - COR ® Odyssey imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Primary antibodies used were anti - GFP ( abcam , ab290 ) , anti - Rab7A ( Cell Signaling Technology , D95F2 ) , anti - Protrudin ( Proteintech 12680 - 1 - AP ) , and anti - Actin ( abcam , ab8224 ) . Secondary antibodies used were IRDye ® 800CW Goat anti - Rabbit IgG and IRDye ® 800CW Goat anti - Mouse IgG ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Immunoprecipitation experiments from three biological replicates and representative blots are shown . Grazing incidence structured illumination microscopy . GI - SIM was performed in the previously described system 53 . Brie ﬂ y , GI - SIM was built based on an inverted ﬂ uorescence microscope ( IX83 , Olympus ) . The light beams from a laser combiner equipped with 405 nm ( LBX - 405 - 300 - CSB - PPA ) , 488 nm ( Coherent , Genesis Max 488 - 500 STM ) , 560 nm ( MPB Communications , VFL - P - 500 - 560 ) , and 642 nm ( MPB Communications , 2RU - VFL - P - 500 - 642 ) lasers were passed through an acousto - optic tunable ﬁ lter ( AOTF ; AA Quanta Tech , AOTFnc - 400 . 650 - CPch - TN ) , which was used to dynamically adjust the excitation laser power coupled into backwards light path . The laser beam from AOTF was then expanded to a 1 / e diameter of 15mm and sent to a phase - only modulator con - sisting of a polarizing beam splitter , a achromatic half - wave plate ( HWP ; Bolder Vision Optik , BVO AHWP3 ) , and a ferroelectric spatial light modulator ( SLM ; Forth Dimension Displays , SXGA - 3DM ) . The light diffracted by the grating pat - tern displayed on SLM passed through a polarization rotator consisting of three pairs of segmented HWP , which rotates the linear polarization of the diffracted light so as to maintain the S - polarization necessary to maximize the pattern con - trast for all pattern orientations . The ﬂ uorescent image generated by the applied excitation pattern of each phase and orientation was collected by a high numerical aperture objective ( Olympus APON 100XHOTIRF 1 . 7 NA ) , and then separated by a dichroic beam splitter ( Chroma , ZT405 / 488 / 560 / 647tpc ) , and focused by a tube lens onto a sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu , Orca Flash 4 . 0 v3 ) . The nine raw images consisting of 3 - orientation and 3 - phase for each time point were reconstructed into a super - resolution ( SR ) image . COS - 7 cells were plated on collagen coated high - NA coverslips and transfected on the following day . The typical acquisition speed for each multi - color GI - SIM super - resolution imaging were 1 frame / s under 50W / cm 2 excitation intensity . Cells were imaged in a microscope stage top micro incubator to maintain the 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . When cells were transfected with Snap - OMM plasmids , the specimen was labeled with 647 - SiR substrate ( S9102S , NEB ) for 20 min , and then imaged immediately . Statistics and reproducibility . Immunoprecipitation / mass spectrometry experi - ments were performed in three different human cell lines : HCT116 , HEK293 , and human ﬁ broblasts , each with three biological replicates . All remaining immuno - precipitation experiments were from three biological replicates and representative blots are shown . Live imaging of transiently transfected cells expressing full length PDZD8 - GFP / PDZD8 - mCherry was performed in multiple cell lines : U2OS , COS7 and HeLa . Cells expressing PDZD8 - GFP / mCherry were imaged in over 70 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3645 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17451 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications independent live - cell imaging sessions , cells expressing Protrudin - GFP / mCherry were imaged in 55 different sessions and cells expressing different PDZD8 trun - cated constructs were each imaged between 4 and 25 different sessions . GI - SIM imaging of cells was conducted from 2 to 8 times in independent live imaging sessions . Images from indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence of native PDZD8 using anti - PDZD8 antibodies in cells expressing Rab7 - GFP represent are representative from four biological replicates . In all cases , the number of cell analyzed for each imaging condition was greater than n = 100 . Reporting summary .
