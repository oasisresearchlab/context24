Albright , Salk Institute for Biological Studies , La Jolla , CA , and approved May 4 , 2009 ( received for review January 13 , 2009 ) The hypothesized role of rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep , which is rich in dreams , in the formation of new associations , has remained anecdotal . We examined the role of REM on creative problem solving , with the Remote Associates Test ( RAT ) . Using a nap paradigm , we manipulated various conditions of prior expo - sure to elements of a creative problem . Compared with quiet rest and non - REM sleep , REM enhanced the formation of associative networks and the integration of unassociated information . Fur - thermore , these REM sleep beneﬁts were not the result of an improved memory for the primed items . This study shows that compared with quiet rest and non - REM sleep , REM enhances the integration of unassociated information for creative problem solv - ing , a process , we hypothesize , that is facilitated by cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation during REM sleep . human (cid:1) implicit (cid:1) memory (cid:1) remote - associates (cid:1) sleep ‘‘T he night before Easter Sunday of that year I awoke , turned on the light , and jotted down a few notes on a tiny slip of paper . Then I fell asleep again . It occurred to me at 6 o’clock in the morning that during the night I had written down something most important , but I was unable to decipher the scrawl . The next night , at 3 o’clock , the idea returned . It was the design of an experiment to determine whether or not the hypothesis of chemical transmission that I had uttered 17 years ago was correct . I got up immediately , went to the laboratory , and performed a single experiment on a frog’s heart according to the nocturnal design . ’’ Otto Loewi , 1938 German , Nobel laureate for his work on the chemical transmission of nerve impulses . Creativity has been defined as ‘‘the forming of associative elements into new combinations which either meet specified requirements or are in some way useful’’ ( 1 ) . It has been further proposed that creative problem solving is reached in four successive phases : first , intense but unsuccessful confrontations with the elements of the problem ; second , a decision to put the problem aside ; third , a dormant period with no further conscious work on the problem , e . g . , incubation ; and finally , a ‘‘flash of insight’’ in which the solution suddenly enters consciousness while the individual is dreaming or engaged in idle thought ( 2 – 4 ) . Evidence for the role of these phases in creative problem solving ( e . g . , a dormant period or incubation ) , however , is inconsistent ( 5 – 7 ) . Yet , it has been long hypothesized that creative problem solving is enhanced by states of mind , such as sleep or quiet reflection , which foster insights . Furthermore , several famous anecdotes attribute creative revelations to dreaming in particular , ranging from musical compositions to insightful advances in scientific discovery ( 8 ) . Evidence for the role of sleep in creative problem solving has been suggested by prior research , but the most critical questions about this effect remain unanswered . First , sleep appears to enhance creative and associative memory processing compared with wake , but the underlying mechanisms , such as sleep stages , have not been explored ( 9 – 12 ) . The seminal article by Wagner and colleagues ( 12 ) suggested that sleep might facilitate ‘‘cog - nitive flexibility’’ and lead to increased occurrences of insight ; however , information about the operative sleep stage was not provided . Second , no study has demonstrated that REM [ a potentially more facilitative state of mind than non - REM ( NREM ) ] enhances creativity more than wake , NREM , or simply the passage of time ( i . e . , incubation ) ( 13 , 14 ) . Circadian confounds in the timing of testing periods may be a possible reason for the lack of difference between the REM group and wake controls . Last , although these studies suggest that exposure to the elements of a problem before sleep is necessary for insights to occur , they do not successfully distinguish between improved memory and enhanced creative processing as the cause of better performance on these associative tasks ( 15 ) . In conclusion , prior studies suggest that sleep , particularly REM , may enhance the formation of associative networks and the integration of unas - sociated information , but no study to date has shown REM to enhance creative processing directly more than any other sleep or wake state . The present study ( i ) directly compared REM , NREM , and wake controls while using a nap paradigm to control for circadian effects , and ( ii ) probed contributions of both memory and associative processing in creative problem solving . We compared incubation and sleep on three forms of prior exposure to the elements of a creative problem ( repeated exposure , no exposure , or priming ) on the Remote Associates Test ( RAT ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Using a nap paradigm allowed us specifi - cally to compare sleep with or without REM with incubation . In the creativity task ( RAT ) , subjects are required to produce a word that is associated with three test words that are seemingly unrelated to each other ( 1 ) . The exposure conditions were designed to access three different methods for creative problem solving . First , the repeated - exposure condition examined the role of incubation on creative problem solving . Second , the priming condition examined whether stimulation of information nodes by an unrelated source can increase solutions to creative problems . Last , the no - exposure condition examined whether general creative problem solving can be enhanced with repeti - tion of the same type of task . We hypothesized that : ( i ) incubation alone would increase creative associations in the repeated condition ; ( ii ) sleep , spe - cifically REM , is required for associating information primed in an unrelated task to the solutions for a creativity task ; and ( iii ) creative problem solving requires prior exposure to problem - related information , such that no benefit would be seen for items in the no - exposure condition . To reduce interference effects that occur during normal waking , a quiet rest group with EEG moni - toring was used instead of uncontrolled wake or sleep deprivation groups .

Subjects were first tested on the RAT at 9 AM and retested at 5 PM . To compare sleep and the passage of time , subjects were administered the same RAT in both the morning and afternoon sessions . No differences were found between groups ( P (cid:1) 0 . 67 , 1 - way ANOVA ) ( Fig . 2 ) , and post hoc analysis showed that all three groups , NREM sleep , REM sleep , and quiet rest , improved similarly on the repeated items compared with the morning baseline performance [ confidence interval ( CI ) 95 % , 6 . 5 – 38 . 3 % ; CI 95 % , 10 . 6 – 50 . 2 % ; and CI 95 % , 2 . 4 – 71 . 0 % for the REM , NREM , and rest groups , respectively ] . These results indicate that passage of time ( i . e . , incubation ) was sufficient to increase creative problem solving . This is consistent with the theory of incubation in which solutions to problems will emerge spontaneously after not actively working on the problem for some time ( i . e . , allowing the problem to incubate ) ( 16 ) . REM Sleep , Not Incubation nor NREM Sleep , Improved Solutions After Priming . We tested whether priming of associative networks would improve creative problem solving with the primed items and whether REM sleep would enhance this effect compared with NREM sleep or quiet rest . After the morning RAT , subjects completed a set of analogies ( e . g . , CHIPS : SALTY ; CANDY : S (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) ) in which half of the answers ( e . g . , SWEET ) were also the answers to the afternoon RAT items ( e . g . , HEART , SIXTEEN , COOKIES ; answer : SWEET ) . In contrast to the incubation results , subjects that had REM sleep displayed a significant improvement above NREM sleep and quiet rest groups ( Fig . 3 ; P (cid:1) 0 . 04 , 1 - way ANOVA and post hoc analysis ) . Strikingly , although the quiet rest and NREM sleep groups received the same priming , they displayed no improvement on the primed RAT items , whereas the REM sleep group improved by almost 40 % above the morning performance . Although naps with REM typically had longer total sleep time ( TST ) ( see Table 1 ) , surprisingly , TST was not correlated with performance on the primed RAT items ( r (cid:1) . 104 , P (cid:1) 0 . 53 , Fig . 4 ) . We also separated subjects by their TST with a median split of the data and compared low TST with high TST on the priming results , which was nonsignificant ( t (cid:1) 1 . 4 , P (cid:1) 0 . 17 ) . Thus , it is unlikely that the REM results were the result of TST differences in the nap . Consistent with previous studies reporting a benefit Fig . 1 . Experimental design . Subjects were administered the creative prob - lem solving test in the morning and then a word analogy priming task . After an intervening polysomnographically recorded sleep or quiet rest period , subjects were tested on the three prior exposure conditions : repeated expo - sure ( white box ) , primed exposure ( gray box ) , or no exposure ( black box ) . Memory tests for the analogy solutions followed . Fig . 2 . Incubation - dependent improvements in performance are indepen - dent of sleep .

These results suggest that REM en - hanced the formation of associative networks and the integration of unassociated information , compared with quiet rest and NREM sleep . Creative Problem Solving Requires Prior Exposure . Because daytime sleep has been shown to increase alertness and improve a range of cognitive functions ( perceptual , verbal , and motor learning ; declarative and implicit memory ) ( 18 , 21 – 24 ) , we tested whether sleep or quiet rest might enhance general creativity on new RAT items . Baseline assessments were measured on the morning RAT . In the PM session , subjects were tested on new RAT items . Surprisingly , no group ( NREM , REM , quiet rest ) differences were found on the new RAT items ( P (cid:1) 0 . 261 1 - way ANOVA ) ( Fig . 5 ) , and no improvement in PM performance above baseline was observed in the three groups ( CI 95 % , (cid:4) 13 . 0 to 41 . 2 % ; CI 95 % , (cid:4) 16 . 0 to 35 . 4 % ; and CI 95 % , (cid:4) 15 . 4 to 51 . 0 % for the REM , NREM , and rest groups , respectively ) . Although daytime sleep has been shown to improve performance on some cognitive tasks and to increase alertness and restore homeostatic drive , neither NREM nor REM sleep improved general creative problem solving in the absence of prior exposure ( e . g . , priming ) . REM Improvements in Creative Problem Solving Are Not Caused by Improved Memory . Previous studies have shown that sleep facil - itates the retention of declarative memories ( 25 – 27 ) . We , there - fore , examined whether enhancement on the RAT items after priming and REM sleep was caused by memory of the answers in the priming task . To address memory , recognition and cued recall were assessed for answers to the morning analogies during the afternoon session . The process dissociation procedure ( 28 ) was also used to investigate how sleep may act on implicit and explicit memory processes . Surprisingly , yet consistent with the incubation findings , no difference was observed among the three groups ( NREM , REM , and quiet rest ) for any of the memory measures , including recognition ( P (cid:1) 0 . 283 , 1 - way ANOVA ) , cued recall ( P (cid:1) 0 . 353 , 1 - way ANOVA ) , explicit ( P (cid:1) 0 . 435 , 1 - way ANOVA ) , and implicit ( P (cid:1) 0 . 229 , 1 - way ANOVA ) . Interestingly , all three groups ( rest , NREM naps , REM naps ) had (cid:5) 90 % correct on the recognition test , suggesting that all groups formed memories of the answers from the morning analogies , i . e . , priming . NREM sleep , REM sleep , and quiet rest groups were indistinguishable on the memory measures [ recognition ( P (cid:1) 0 . 28 , 1 - way ANOVA ) , cued recall ( P (cid:1) 0 . 35 , 1 - way ANOVA ) , explicit ( P (cid:1) 0 . 43 , 1 - way ANOVA ) , and implicit ( P (cid:1) 0 . 22 , 1 - way ANOVA ) memory ] . Performance on these memory measures was not correlated with performance on the primed RAT items ( Fig . 6 ) . Importantly , although all groups had similar memory for primed answers , only subjects with REM sleep promoted generalization of the analogy answers to new and useful solutions on an unrelated creative problem - solving task . Discussion Here , we report that REM sleep can improve creative problem solving . We found that : ( i ) the passage of time ( i . e . , incubation period ) improves problem solving for previously exposed items , and this was independent of the sleep condition ; ( ii ) sleep enhanced creative problem solving for items that were primed before sleep , but this was only true for naps that included REM sleep ; ( iii ) REM sleep improvements in creative problem solving Fig . 4 . Amountofsleepdoesnotcontributetocreativeproblemsolving . TST and improvement on primed RAT items were not signiﬁcantly correlated ( r (cid:1) 0 . 104 , P (cid:1) 0 . 53 , trend line shown ) . Fig . 5 . REM sleep does not improve creative problem solving without prior exposure . No group differences were found on the new RAT items ( P (cid:1) 0 . 261 1 - way ANOVA ) , and PM performance was not different from baseline in the anyofthethreegroups ( CI95 % , (cid:4) 13 . 0to41 . 2 % ; CI95 % , (cid:4) 35 . 4to16 . 0 % ; and CI 95 % , (cid:4) 51 . 0 to 15 . 4 % for the REM , NREM , and rest groups , respectively ) . Although daytime sleep has been shown to improve a range of cognitive functions ( perceptual , verbal , and motor learning ; declarative and implicit memory ) and to increase alertness and restore homeostatic drive , neither NREM nor REM sleep improves general creative problem solving in the ab - sence of prior exposure ( e . g . , priming ) . Fig . 6 . REM sleep improvements in creativity are dissociated from memory . Creative problem solving performance in the priming condition ( y axis ) and memory tasks ( cued recall and recognition ) are shown . The three groups performequallywellonallmemorytasks , althoughREMsleepimprovements in creativity are only seen in performance for primed unrelated items . Cai et al . PNAS Early Edition (cid:1) 3 of 5 P S Y C H O L O G Y N E U R O S C I E N C E are not the result of selective improvements in memory ; and ( iv ) general problem - solving abilities were not improved in wake or sleep conditions . These findings have important implications for how sleep , specifically REM sleep , might foster the formation of associative networks . A longstanding , critical issue in sleep and cognition research is whether improvements in behavioral performance are the result of sleep - specific enhancement or reduction of interfer - ence . Experiences during waking have been shown to interfere with memory consolidation ( 29 ) . Thus , performance benefits observed after sleep may be the result of lack of interference . For example , a recent study found that a quiet wake interval pro - vided benefits for auditory tone sequence learning similar to those from a sleep interval , and both were better than the active wake interval ( 30 ) . Our methods control for interference effects by comparing sleep periods with quiet rest periods . Subjects were relaxed on a recliner , with polysomnographic monitoring , and they listened to instrumental music of their choice for a time interval equal to the naps . By controlling for verbal input , we can be confident that performance across sleep and wake groups was not caused by a difference in verbal interference during the nap , but specifically by processes occurring during incubation . Current models for why we sleep posit an important role of sleep in memory consolidation ( 31 – 34 ) . While controlling for circadian effects , the present study found that sleep specifically enhanced the associative network for primed solutions but did not improve memory consolidation . Although other studies have reported that sleep enhances explicit verbal memory ( 22 , 35 ) , our memory measures were not comparable with these recall tasks because exposure to the verbal material was primed and not explicitly presented . Furthermore , not only were NREM sleep , REM sleep , and quiet rest groups indistinguishable on the memory measures , performance on these memory measures was not correlated with performance on the primed RAT items . This indicates that the improvement on the primed RAT was not a consequence of the REM sleep group simply remembering the primed words better than the other groups . These results are consistent with the previous finding that memory strength of previously encountered insight problems is not directly related to the solution acquisition to those problems ( 36 ) . The results support the hypothesis that the brain is subcon - sciously spreading activation of previously activated nodes . Prior literature suggests that during a ‘‘dormant period’’ between two active encounters with a problem , the memory trace of a target item , and the progression of this target through other relevant stored information generate spreading activation through a network ( 16 ) . For example , by priming the solution SWEET before sleep , the SWEET node is activated , and during subse - quent REM sleep , the associative nodes ( in this case HEART , SIXTEEN , COOKIE ) are more likely to be activated and increased above threshold . Therefore , when the three words that were previously unrelated ( HEART , SIXTEEN , COOKIE ) are seen , there will be an increased probability of the node SWEET being chosen as the solution . We propose that the most optimal dormant period occurs during REM sleep , which provides the most spreading of activation . One possible mechanism for the spreading - activation model involves cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs specifically during REM sleep . During wake , higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connec - tions in the neocortex . During REM sleep , however , high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from hippocampus to the neocortex , whereas lower levels of acetyl - choline and norepinephrine in the neocortex could facilitate the spread of activity within neocortical areas without strong hip - pocampal influence ( 37 ) . This is supported by behavioral evi - dence from amnesiacs that activation of this associative network during sleep is independent of the medial temporal lobe struc - tures and may reflect reactivation of remote memories that are less dependent on the hippocampus ( 38 ) . In this theoretical framework , REM sleep would allow neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies , in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes . We propose that REM sleep is important for assimilating new information into past experience to create a richer network of associations for future use . Fluid interpretation is a hallmark of a creative mind , from idle word play to the abstraction of shapes that led to the solving of neurochemical transmission or the structure of the benzene ring . These findings on the role of REM sleep in creative problem solving underscore the Nobel Laureate Friedrich A . Kekule’s recommendation : ‘‘Let us learn to dream . ’’ Experimental Procedures General procedures are outlined in this section . Deviations from this proce - dure are described in each section . Subjects . A total of 77 native English speakers between the ages of 18 and 35 withnopersonalhistoryofneurological , psychological , orotherchronicillness gaveinformedconsenttoparticipateintheexperiment , whichwasapproved bytheInstitutionalReviewBoardoftheUniversityofCaliforniaatSanDiego . Subjects were required to sleep an average of 6 h per night for the 5 days leadinguptotheexperimentaldayandatleast6 . 5hthenightbeforethetest day . Subjects ﬁlled out sleep diaries and wore actigraphs 5 – 7 days before testing as subjective and objective measures of sleep – wake activity . Subjects were restricted from consuming caffeine and alcohol 24 h before and during the experiment day . Materials RAT is a paper - and - pencil task adapted from Mednick ( 1 ) . Each RAT item contains a triplet of words presented horizontally along with a blank space . Each item requires the subject to combine or relate the three words drawn from mutually remote associative clusters ( e . g . , COOKIES , SIXTEEN , HEART : (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) ) . The subject is required to ﬁnd a fourth word that could serve as an associative link between these three words . The answer to this item is SWEET ( cookies are sweet , sweet sixteen , sweetheart ) . The three test words HEART , SIXTEEN , COOKIE are associated with the solution SWEET by formation of a compound ( sweetheart ) , by a syntactic association ( sweet sixteen ) , and by a semantic relationship ( cookies are sweet ) . Thus , reaching a solution requires ‘‘creative thought’’ because the ﬁrst , most highly probable associate to each of the items is often not correct , so the solver must think of more distantly related information to connect the three words . Performance on the RAT correlates reliably with other established insight problems ( 39 ) . * Subjects were read the instructions aloud and given four practice items to ensure understanding of the task . The score was calculated as the proportion ofitemsansweredcorrectly . SubjectscompletedtwoversionsoftheRAT , one in the morning and one in the afternoon . The two versions were counterbal - ancedacrosssessions . Inthemorningsession , subjectscompletedtheAMRAT , and AM scores were used as baseline . Analogies . Analogies ( e . g . , FAST : SLOW as HARD : E (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) ) , were administered in the AM session . The ﬁrst letter of each answer was given . Half of the analogy answers served as primes for the answers to the RAT administered during the PM session . There was no time limit for completing the analogies . The mean logHALwordfrequency ( 40 ) forallwordsusedintheanalogieswas1 . 58 ( SD (cid:1) 0 . 73 ) . The mean word length was 5 . 36 letters ( SD (cid:1) 1 . 75 ) . General Method .
