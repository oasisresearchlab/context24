However , detailed knowledge of peri - implantation lineage developments 32 as well as underlying mechanisms remain obscure . Using 3D - cultured human embryos , 33 herein we report a complete cell atlas of the early post - implantation lineages and 34 decipher cellular composition and gene signatures of the epiblast and hypoblast 35 derivatives . In addition , we develop an embryo - like assembloid ( E - assembloid ) by 36 assembling naive hESCs and extraembryonic cells . Using human embryos and 37 E - assembloids , we reveal that WNT , BMP and Nodal signaling synergistically , but 38 functionally differently , orchestrate human peri - implantation lineage development . 39 Specially , we dissect mechanisms underlying extraembryonic mesoderm and 40 extraembryonic endoderm specifications . Finally , an improved E - assembloid is 41 developed to recapitulate the epiblast and hypoblast developments and tissue 42 architectures in the pre - gastrulation human embryo . Our findings provide insights of 43 the human peri - implantation development , and the E - assembloid offers a useful model 44 to disentangle cellular behaviors and signaling interactions that drive human 45 embryogenesis . 46 47 3 Introduction 48 In humans , the blastocyst , a hollow round structure comprising ~ 200 cells , 49 implants into the uterine wall to initiate post - implantation development at embryonic 50 day 6 - 7 ( E6 - 7 ) . In the late blastocyst , the inner cell mass ( ICM ) segregates into the 51 hypoblast ( HB ) , which gives rise to the yolk sac , and the epiblast ( EPI ) , which 52 differentiates into the three definitive germ layers to form the embryo proper . Despite 53 their critical roles in human development , we still have very limited knowledge of 54 post - implantation development of the HB and EPI lineages . Recently , we and others 55 have successfully developed in vitro human embryo culture systems , extending growth 56 of human blastocysts towards the pre - gastrulation stage 1 - 4 . However , the precise cell 57 atlas , lineage specification and developmental signals during the peri - implantation 58 human development , especially those related to the HB and EPI derivatives , remain 59 obscure 5 . 60 The use of human embryos for investigating peri - implantation development is 61 fraught with ethical concerns and hampered by technical barriers , such as genetic 62 manipulation in specific lineages and reproducible embryo development 5 . Stem 63 cell - based embryo models provide a more practical alternative in place of human 64 embryos to decode early human development . Previous studies used primed human 65 pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) to model some embryonic phenotypes associated with 66 post - implantation EPI development such as embryoid body , micropatterned colony , 67 asymmetric human epiblast models ( 3D epiblast model and post - attached embryoid ) , 68 gastruloid , sequential somite - like structures ( Axioloid or Segmentoid ) and amniotic 69 sac embryoid 6 - 16 . However , these embryoids could not recapitulate the specification 70 and development of the extraembryonic mesoderm ( ExM ) and HB lineages , only 71 mimicked some aspects of human postimplantation EPI development such as 72 anteroposterior symmetry breaking , anterior - posterior axial patterning , somitogenesis , 73 dorsal – ventral patterning and amniogenesis . Although several recent reports showed 74 that human blastocyst - like structures ( blastoids ) are generated from naive hPSCs or 75 human extended pluripotent stem cells ( hEPSCs ) or primed - to - naïve intermediates or 76 by reprogramming fibroblasts , these blastoids showed a poor developmental potential 77 through implantation 17 - 23 . To our knowledge , some vital 3D tissue structures in human 78 peri - implantation embryos , such as the amniotic cavity and yolk sac , are not well 79 recapitulated in extended cultured human blastoids . 80 4 To fill the knowledge gap of human peri - implantation development , herein we 81 provided a complete cell atlas of early post - implantation embryonic lineages in 3D 82 cultured human blastocysts . Furthermore , we successfully created a human 83 embryo - like assembloid ( E - assembloid ) that recapitulates developmental landmarks , 84 3D cellular organization and lineage composition of human peri - implantation embryo , 85 thus establishing a novel embryo model for studying human early post - implantation 86 development . Using human embryos and E - assembloids , our study unravels the 87 transcriptional states of HB and EPI derivatives and functional roles of WNT , BMP and 88 Nodal signaling in mediating their lineage specifications . 89 90 Results 91 Single - cell transcriptional profiling of 3D - cultured human embryos 92 Although some cell types in the peri - implantation human embryo have recently 93 been characterized 3 , 4 , 24 , a complete cell atlas of the post - implantation HB and EPI 94 derivatives and their corresponding gene expression profiles , especially for amniotic 95 epithelium ( AME ) , extraembryonic mesoderm ( ExM ) , visceral / yolk endoderm 96 ( VE / YE ) and anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) , are still lacking . To address this 97 knowledge gap , we first generated a complete cell atlas for 3D - cultured human 98 embryos 4 from embryonic day ( E10 - 14 ) ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1a ) using 99 the 10X Genomics platform . Different cell types , including trophoblast ( TrB ) , EPI , 100 ExM and extraembryonic endoderm ( XEN , an HB derivative ) , emerged successively 101 between E10 - 14 in the single - cell RNA - sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) data ( Fig . 1a , b ; 102 Supplementary information , Fig . S1b ) . To focus on EPI and HB lineage developments , 103 we removed TrB cells from the scRNA - seq data . Remaining cells were subclustered 104 into 11 different populations , including post - implantation early and late EPI 105 ( PostE−EPI and PostL−EPI ) , undefined cells ( UC ) , AME1 and 2 , primitive streak 1 106 and 2 ( PS1 and 2 ) , ExM1 and 2 , VE / YE and AVE ( Fig . 1c , d ; Supplementary 107 information , Fig . S1c ) . 108 We next analyzed gene expression signatures of these lineages and identified 109 molecular markers useful for discerning different cell types in the peri - implantation 110 human development . As expected , both PostE−EPI and PostL−EPI express core 111 pluripotency genes POU5F1 , NANOG and SOX2 . PostE−EPI expresses greater levels 112 of naive genes UTF1 , FGF4 and NODAL , whereas PostL−EPI shows higher 113 5 expression of primed genes IGFBP2 , USP44 , CD24 and DNMT3B ( Fig . 1e , f ) . KEGG 114 ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) pathway analysis revealed that 115 PostE−EPI and PostL−EPI are enriched with genes for ‘oxidative phosphorylation’ 116 and ‘glycolysis’ , respectively ( Fig . 1f ) , suggesting a metabolic shift during EPI 117 development . We also examined expression of genes associated with the formative 118 pluripotency state 25 , 26 ; there is greater expression of DPPA2 and GDF3 , but lower or 119 similar expression of SOX11 , OTX2 and ZNF genes in PostE−EPI , compared to in 120 PostL−EPI ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1d ) , suggesting that there are 121 differences between formative hPSCs and embryonic epiblast in gene expression 122 profiles . The UC cluster weakly expresses pluripotency genes and is enriched with 123 genes for ‘apoptosis’ , suggesting their apoptotic EPI identity ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Compared 124 with the AME2 , the AME1 shows lower expression of AME markers but higher 125 expression of pluripotency genes ; compared with the EPI , the AME1 shows lower 126 expression of pluripotency markers but higher expression of amnion genes , indicative 127 of a transitional AME state ( Fig . 1e , f ) . RNA velocity map and clustering further 128 reveal the similar identities of AME1 and AME2 ( Fig . 1g , h ) . PS1 and PS2 share early 129 primitive streak genes TBXT , SP5 , HOXA1 , EOMES and NODAL , with PS2 highly 130 expressing CDX1 , CDX2 , MIXL1 , MESP1 , HAND1 and GATA6 ( Fig . 1e , f ) . ExM1 131 and ExM2 upregulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition genes VIM and SNAI2 ; in 132 addition to KDR 4 and COL6A1 27 , we identified FLT1 , MEIS2 , COL3A1 , NID2 and 133 FOXF1 as potential markers of ExM ( Fig . 1e ; Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) . 134 Unexpectedly , POSTN , a specific AVE marker in marmoset 28 , is exclusively 135 expressed in the ExM2 ( Fig . 1e ; Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) . Expressions 136 of GATA4 , GATA6 , PDGFRA , FN1 and COL4A1 are all upregulated in the ExM 137 ( ExM1 and ExM2 ) and XEN ( VE / YE and AVE ) , in contrast to APOA1 29 , IHH 30 , 138 OTX2 29 , FOXA1 27 , FOXA2 , HNF4A and SOX17 , which are specific to XEN ( Fig . 1e ; 139 Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) . AFP , TTR , APOA4 , APOC3 and MTTP show 140 upregulated expression in VE / YE . Conversely , LHX1 , HHEX , EOMES , GSC , CER1 , 141 LEFTY1 , LEFTY2 and NOG are mainly expressed in AVE ( Fig . 1e ; Supplementary 142 information , Fig . S1e ) , suggesting that human AVE is conserved to secret inhibitors 143 of WNT , BMP and Nodal signaling . 144 We further performed immunostaining for E13 human embryos and confirmed 145 that XEN cells are positive for GATA6 , SOX17 , FOXA1 , PODXL1 , N - Cadherin and 146 6 OTX2 , and ExM cells are positive for GATA6 , KDR , SNAIL and COL3A1 but 147 negative for SOX17 , FOXA1 , PODXL1 , OTX2 or pluripotency markers 148 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1f , g ) , consistent with the scRNA - seq data ( Fig . 1e ; 149 Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) . We also observed a few OCT4 – KDR + ExM 150 cells without GATA6 expression ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1f , g ) . Based on 151 these data , we identified OCT4 – SOX2 – KDR – SOX17 + FOXA1 + PODXL1 + cells as 152 XEN cells and OCT4 – SOX2 – SOX17 – FOXA1 – KDR + as ExM cells . 153 We also performed KEGG pathway analysis to reveal signaling pathways 154 involved in lineage developments . The AME , PS , ExM , VE / YE and AVE clusters are 155 enriched with genes associated with BMP and WNT signaling ( Fig . 1f ) , suggesting 156 the important roles of BMP and WNT signaling in the post - implantation EPI and HB 157 lineage specifications . Specifically , BMP2 and BMP4 are highly upregulated in the 158 XEN and ExM , respectively , whereas BMP target genes ID1 , ID2 , ID3 and ID4 are 159 mainly expressed in the AME and PS ( Fig . 1f ; Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) , 160 implying potential roles of XEN and ExM in inducing AME and PS specifications , 161 which is further confirmed by intercellular communication analysis ( Fig . 1i ) . WNT6 is 162 specifically expressed in AME , while WNT3 , WNT5A and WNT5B are mainly 163 expressed in PS ( Fig . 1f ; Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) . Interaction analysis 164 also showed that AME and PS are the major senders of WNT signaling 165 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1h ) . Interestingly , WNT inhibitors DKK1 , SFRP1 166 and SFRP2 are mainly upregulated in ExM , AVE and EPI , respectively 167 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1e ) ; however , DKK1 and SFRP1 are mainly 168 expressed in monkey AVE and EPI , respectively 28 , 31 , suggesting different regulatory 169 patterns of WNT signaling in humans and monkeys . 170 171 Derivation of naive hESCs under normoxia condition 172 To model post - implantation HB and EPI lineage developments , we sought to 173 establish an embryoid using naive hPSCs , which are the in vitro counterparts of the 174 pre - implantation EPI ( Pre - EPI ) . Naive hPSCs have been derived using t2iLGö , 5i / LAF 175 or HENSM medium conditions under 5 % O 2 32 - 34 . Such a low oxygen level , however , 176 causes pluripotency loss and cell death in human embryos cultured through the 177 implantation stage 1 . We thus first sought to derive naive hPSCs in normoxia ( 21 % O 2 ) . 178 In the previous works , we established the AIC medium , which is composed of modified 179 7 N2B27 medium supplemented with AIC ( Activin - A , IWP2 and CHIR99021 ) , and 180 supports efficient derivation and long - term expansion of primed hPSCs through 181 single - cell passage 35 . Naive hPSCs grown in the t2iLGö proliferate more rapidly and 182 are karyotypically more stable than those cultured in 5i / LAF 36 - 38 . We therefore singled 183 out the key components of t2iLGö for the maintenance of naive pluripotency , including 184 the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 , the protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6983 and human LIF 185 39 , which were incorporated into the AIC medium to establish a new culture system , 186 termed AIC - N medium ( Fig . 2a ) . AIC - N allows isolation and expansion of naive 187 hESCs from blastocysts or their conversion from conventional primed hESCs in 188 normoxia ( Fig . 2b ) . AIC - N hESCs could be expanded for at least 50 passages in AIC - N 189 and retained pluripotency properties similar to naive hPSCs established under 5 % O 2 , 190 in terms of their expression of pluripotency markers , transcriptome , methylation and 191 potential to differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic lineages ( teratomas , 192 blastoids and trophoblast lineages ) ( Fig . 2c - h ; Supplementary information , Fig . S2a - h ) 193 32 - 34 , 40 - 42 . 194 195 Generation and development of human E - assembloids 196 We next attempted to aggregate AIC - N hESCs with either human trophoblast stem 197 cells ( hTSCs ) 43 or naive hESC - derived trophectoderm - like cells ( nTEs ) 41 , 42 in a basal 198 medium diluted with half hTSC medium ( termed M1 ) supplemented with 1 % Matrigel , 199 for the development of an integrated embryo model . However , poor ( ~ 3 % ) integrations 200 of AIC - N hESCs with either hTSCs or nTEs were observed ( Fig . 3a - c ; Supplementary 201 information , Fig . S3a - d ) . We then considered inducing trophoblast differentiation from 202 primed AIC - hESCs 35 by sequential treatment of the cells with BMP4 / SB431542 and 203 the hTSC medium ( Supplementary information , Fig . S3e ) 43 . The resulting cells , herein 204 termed BMP4 - induced cells ( BICs ) , could be expanded over 10 passages and gradually 205 acquire a hTSC - like identity over culture ( Supplementary information , Fig . S3f , g ) . 206 Gene expression patterns suggest that BICs undergo a fate transition to 207 post - implantation trophoblast - like state over culture after exhibiting a transient 208 amnion - like phenotype ( Supplementary information , Fig . S3h - k ) . Interestingly , when 209 assembling AIC - N hESCs and BICs different days after induction in M1 supplemented 210 with 1 % Matrigel , the wrapping capacity of BICs for AIC - N hESCs decreased with 211 their extended culture , with D2 BICs showing the highest envelopment efficiency ( over 212 8 90 % ) concomitant with efficient cell survival ( Fig . 3a - c ; Supplementary information , 213 Fig . S3l ) . 214 WNT and BMP signaling play key roles in early human embryonic development 215 9 , 14 , 31 , 44 - 46 . To investigate whether the extraembryonic tissues regulate the development 216 of embryonic compartment by secreting WNT and BMP signals , we analyzed the WNT 217 and BMP signaling interactions between extraembryonic and embryonic compartments 218 in 3D - cultured human embryos before E10 . As expected , the peripheral TrB and XEN 219 send WNT and BMP signals to the internal EPI , respectively ( Supplementary 220 information , Fig . S4a , b ) . Similarly , D2 BICs , intermediates that express amnion 221 markers transiently during trophoblast induction , show upregulated expression of 222 WNT and BMP ligands ( Supplementary information , Fig . S4c ) , suggesting that they 223 may have a regulatory function of extraembryonic tissue for embryonic compartment . 224 Together , even though it is unclear the counterpart of D2 BICs in the natural human 225 embryo , they express key signaling ligand genes and provide an extraembryonic - like 226 nest for AIC - N hESC clump , similar to the strategy reported in two recent studies using 227 cells from hESCs induced by BMP4 to instruct epiblast development into early 228 gastrulation cell types 10 or experimentally engineered morphogen signaling centre that 229 functions as an organizer to instruct development of embryo - like entities ( embryoids ) 230 47 . We thus termed D2 BICs signaling nest cells ( SNCs ) , and the embryo - like 231 assembloid generated through integrating SNCs and naive hESCs were termed 232 E - assembloid . 233 We next examined the developmental potential of E - assembloids . Under the M1 234 condition , E - assembloids embedded in Matrigel droplets gradually grew in size ( Fig . 235 3d - f ) . On D3 , a large number of T + / CDX2 + cells ( putative primitive streak - like cells , 236 PSLCs or amniotic epithelium - like cells , AMELCs ) , and GATA6 + ExM - like cells 237 ( ExMLCs ) that expressed ExM markers KDR and COL6A1 , but not XEN markers 238 FOXA1 , OTX2 and EOMES , emerged in E - assembloids ( Fig . 3g , h ; Supplementary 239 information , Fig . S4d , e ) . The E - assembloids generated from different cell lines 240 showed similar results ( Fig . 3h ) . To confirm cell lineage origins , E - assembloids were 241 generated using female SNCs and male AIC - N hESCs . Single - cell gene expression 242 analysis of Y - chromosome specific gene RPS4Y1 and lineage markers showed the 243 presence of ExMLCs and PSLCs / AMELCs and their origins from AIC - N hESCs 244 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S4f ) , which was further confirmed by 245 9 immunofluorescence staining of E - assembloids constructed from SNCs and 246 mCherry - labeled AIC - N hESCs ( Supplementary information , Fig . S4g ) . To 247 characterize D3 E - assembloids , the scRNA - seq data from E10 - 14 human embryos 248 were used as a reference for comparative transcriptome analysis . UMAP analyses 249 revealed a clear distinction between SNC and TrB populations , which was further 250 confirmed by differential expressions of trophoblast and amnion marker genes in the 251 two populations ( Supplementary information , Fig . S4h , i ) . Thus , SNCs in 252 E - assembloids fail to recapitulate the development of TrB - related cell lineages . To 253 determine how AIC - N hESC derivatives in E - assembloids correspond to their 254 embryonic counterparts , we excluded the TrB and SNC populations from the 255 scRNA - seq data of embryos and E - assembloids , respectively . Consistent with the 256 immunostaining results , further integrated UMAP analyses showed that AIC - N hESC 257 derivatives consisted of cells with molecular profiles comparable to PostE - EPI 258 ( 28 . 6 % ) , UC ( 1 . 1 % ) , AME ( 6 . 7 % ) , PS ( 17 . 9 % ) and ExM ( 45 . 6 % ) , but lacked 259 PostL - EPI - like cells and XEN - like cells ( XENLCs ) ( Fig . 3i , j ; Supplementary 260 information , Fig . S4j ) . In the E - assembloids , there are no XENLCs , but a large 261 number of ExMLCs ( Fig . 3j ) , suggesting these ExMLCs as progenies of EPILCs , 262 consistent with a recent study 46 . Together , E - assembloids cultured in the M1 condition 263 recapitulate the development of human ExM , PS and AME but not PostL - EPI and XEN 264 ( Fig . 3k ) . 265 266 WNT and BMP signaling orchestrate post - implantation lineage development 267 In contrast to E - assembloids , most of AIC - N hESC clumps grown alone in the 268 M1 condition maintained pluripotency even on D9 ( Supplementary information , 269 Fig . S4k , l ) , suggesting that there are inductive signals from SNCs to drive 270 E - assembloid development . Since SNCs express WNT and BMP ligands 271 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S4c ) , and the specifications of ExM , PS and amnion 272 are closely related to WNT and BMP signaling 8 - 10 , 14 , 46 . To investigate whether the 273 SNCs provide WNT and BMP signals to induce embryonic and extraembryonic lineage 274 differentiation in E - assembloids , we analyzed the intercellular communication 275 networks in D3 E - assembloids by single - cell transcriptomes , and confirmed that BICs 276 do produce WNT and BMP signals that are received by epiblast - like cells ( EPILCs ) 277 10 and other types of cells ( Fig . 3l , m ) . We therefore manipulated WNT and BMP 278 signaling to assess their effects on the developments of E - assembloids , AIC - N hESC 279 clumps and human embryos . Specifically , we first inhibited WNT and BMP pathways 280 using chemical inhibitors during extended culture of E - assembloids ( Fig . 4a ) . 281 Contrary to the development of E - assembloids in the M1 condition , inhibition of 282 either WNT or BMP signaling in E - assembloids largely delayed EPILC development 283 toward embryonic and extraembryonic lineages , specifications of which were even 284 completely blocked by dual inhibitions of WNT and BMP signaling ( Fig . 4a , b ; 285 Supplementary information , Fig . S5a , b ) . Notably , both WNT and BMP inhibitions 286 significantly reduced ExM specification , but with differential effects on AME and PS 287 specifications ( Fig . 4a - d ; Supplementary information , Fig . S5a , c , d ) . WNT inhibition 288 abolished PS specification but promoted AME development . In contrast , BMP 289 inhibition abolished AME development and reduced PS specification ( Fig . 4a - d ; 290 Supplementary information , Fig . S5a , c , d ) . Consistent with chemical inhibition 291 assays , developments of ExM , AME and PS were significantly inhibited in 292 E - assembloids generated from BMP4 - / - / 7 - / - SNCs ( Fig . 4e , f ; Supplementary 293 information , Fig . S5e , f ) . To further validate the functions of WNT and BMP signals , 294 different combinations of WNT and BMP agonists and inhibitors were used to treat 295 AIC - N hESC clumps that were not wrapped in SNCs ( Fig . 4g ) . The results showed 296 that ExM specification required dual activation of WNT and BMP signaling , and PS 297 and AME specifications required activation of WNT and BMP signaling , respectively 298 ( Fig . 4h ; Supplementary information , Fig . S5g ) . Finally , we used 3D - cultured human 299 embryos 4 to further confirm that dual activation of WNT and BMP signals is 300 indispensable for ExM specification ( Supplementary information , Fig . S5h ) . Together , 301 our results demonstrated that ExM specification required both WNT and BMP 302 signaling , whereas WNT or BMP signaling is required for PS or AME development , 303 respectively ( Fig . 4i ) . 304 305 Signaling regulatory mechanisms controlling extraembryonic endoderm 306 specification 307 Even with modulated WNT and BMP signaling and extended culture , 308 E - assembloids and AIC - N hESC clumps did not give rise to XENLCs ( Fig . 4d , f , h ) . 309 11 Since Nodal signaling is activated in XEN ( Fig . 5a , b ) , we asked whether the presence 310 of Activin / Nodal inhibitors ( A83 - 01 + SB431542 , AS ) in the M1 medium might have 311 blocked XENLC specification in E - assembloids and AIC - N hESC clumps . To this end , 312 we first induced 2D differentiation of AIC - N hESCs with or without AS ( Fig . 5c ) , with 313 results showing that CHIR + BMP4 induced differentiation of AIC - N hESCs into a 314 heterogeneous population containing both ExMLCs and XENLCs ( Fig . 5d , Conditions 315 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) . Importantly , inhibition of endogenous Nodal signaling with AS blocked 316 XENLC specification ( Fig . 5d , Conditions ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) ) . Interestingly , the effect of 317 CHIR + BMP4 treatment was time - dependent : a transient ( 2 days ) induction of 318 CHIR + BMP4 was beneficial for XENLC specification ( Fig . 5d , e , Condition ( 3 ) ) , 319 whereas their continuous ( 4 days ) treatment promoted ExMLC differentiation at 320 expense of XENLCs ( Fig . 5d , Condition ( 2 ) ) . Notably , activation of WNT or BMP 321 signaling alone was ineffective in specifications of XENLCs and ExMLCs ( Fig . 5f ) , 322 suggesting that their specifications require a synergy between WNT and BMP 323 signaling . Together , effective differentiation of AIC - N hESCs into XENLCs requires 324 short - time activation of both WNT and BMP signaling in a Nodal - dependent manner 325 ( Fig . 5g , h ) . 326 327 Establishment of an improved E - assembloid by regulating signaling pathways 328 Based on the principle of specifications of embryonic and extraembryonic 329 lineages involving WNT , BMP and Nodal signaling ( Fig . 4i and 5g , h ) , we established 330 an improved Protocol for assembly and extended culture of E - assembloids ( Fig . 6a ) . 331 The improved Protocol was based on the M1 minus Activin / Nodal inhibitors and 332 included three steps : ( 1 ) lineage induction by endogenous signals secreted from SNCs 333 and exogenous WNT agonist ( 1 μ M CHIR ) from D0 to D2 ; ( 2 ) inhibition of excessive 334 ExM specification by blocking endogenous BMP signals with LDN and removing 335 exogenous WNT agonist ( CHIR withdrawal ) from D2 to D4 ; and ( 3 ) spontaneous 336 lineage specification and self - organization without exogenous signal interference from 337 D4 onwards ( Fig . 6a ) . This improved Protocol allowed E - assembloids to progressively 338 grow and develop with similar sizes to 3D - cultured human embryos ( Fig . 6b ; 339 Supplementary information , Fig . S6a ) . Remarkably , immunostaining for lineage 340 markers revealed dynamic development of XENLCs and ExMLCs in E - assembloids 341 ( Fig . 6c , d ; Supplementary information , Fig . S6b - d ) . On D1 , no XENLCs or ExMLCs 342 12 were observed ( Fig . 6d ; Supplementary information , Fig . S6b ) . On D2 , abundant 343 GATA6 + OCT4 weak NANOG weak cells and small numbers of SOX17 + BLIMP1 + cells 344 were detected in over 90 % of E - assembloids ; few FOXA1 + , OTX2 + , 345 SOX2 – FOXA1 – KDR + and OCT4 weak KDR + cells also were specified in approximately 346 10 % , 20 % , 10 % and 10 % E - assembloids , respectively ; and no PODXL1 + GATA6 + 347 XENLCs and BST2 + ExMLCs were observed ( Fig . 6d ; Supplementary information , 348 Fig . S6b - d ) , implying an initial XENLC and ExMLC specifications . On D3 , more than 349 90 % of E - assembloids produced abundant SOX17 + OTX2 + and GATA6 + PODXL1 + 350 XENLCs and a few OCT4 weak / – KDR + ExMLCs , and approximately 80 % of 351 E - assembloids gave rise to small numbers of BST2 + ExMLCs . On D4 , almost all 352 E - assembloids contained abundant GATA6 + , FOXA1 + , SOX17 + BLIMP1 + , 353 PODXL1 + GATA6 + XENLCs that surrounded OCT4 + EPILC compartment , 354 accompanied by specification of SOX2 – KDR + ExMLCs ( Fig . 6d ; Supplementary 355 information , Fig . S6b ) . Together , during XENLC and ExMLC specifications in 356 E - assembloids , GATA6 is first activated ; followed by SOX17 and BLIMP1 ; and 357 OTX2 , FOXA1 , KDR , PODXL1 and BST2 are activated last . 358 On D8 , > 90 % of E - assembloids contained two expanded cavities , the yolk 359 sac - like and amniotic cavity - like structures , surrounded by ExMLCs ( Fig . 6b - d ) . In > 360 90 % of E - assembloids , notably , we observed XENLCs expressing CER1 and LEFTY1 361 ( Fig . 6e , f ) , suggestive of an AVE - like identity 24 , 31 . Similar results were obtained from 362 the E - assembloids constructed from two different cell lines ( Supplementary 363 information , Fig . S6e ) . These results demonstrated that the XENLC deficiency in 364 E - assembloids was solved by the improved Protocol ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , AMELCs 365 were specified at the prospective dorsal pole of the amniotic cavity - like structure , and 366 PGCLCs were detected within AME - like tissue or near the junction of EPILCs and 367 XENLCs ( Fig . 6g - i ; Supplementary information , Fig . S6f , g ) . In addition , in 368 approximately 20 % of E - assembloids , some T + putative PSLCs are observed 369 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S6h , i ) . However , in addition to being at the putative 370 posterior junction of the yolk sac - like structure and EPILC compartment , some of these 371 putative PSLCs , which co - expressed CDX2 , also appeared on opposite side of the 372 putative posterior domain ( Supplementary information , Fig . S6f ) , exhibiting a 373 disorganized localization . To answer whether the effects of BICs can be simulated by 374 adding exogenous agonists of WNT and BMP signaling , we transiently treated AIC - N 375 13 hESC clumps with CHIR + BMP4 for 12 hours ( Supplementary information , Fig . S6j ) , 376 and resulted in the generation of a large number of embryonic and extraembryonic 377 lineages on D6 , including EPILCs ( OCT4 + NANOG + SOX2 + ) , PSLCs and AMELCs 378 ( T + CDX2 + and TFAP2A + ) , XENLCs ( GATA6 + FOXA1 + ) and ExMLCs 379 ( GATA6 + FOXA1 – and SOX2 – KDR + ) ( Supplementary information , Fig . S6k , l ) , 380 showing exogenous activation of WNT and BMP signaling could partially simulate 381 the induction effect of BICs . However , in these resulting AIC - N hESC spheres , the 382 different types of cells are mostly arranged irregularly ( Supplementary information , 383 Fig . S6k ) . Therefore BICs , in addition to their effect of inducing different lineage 384 specifications , may also provide mechanical effects that favor ordered organization of 385 different cell lineages . 386 To further characterize D8 E - assembloids , comparative transcriptome analysis of 387 integrated scRNA - seq data of 3D - cultured human embryos and D8 E - assembloids was 388 conducted ( Supplementary information , Fig . S7a ) . UMAP plots and differential 389 expressions of trophoblast and amnion marker genes reveal an obvious difference 390 between SNC and TrB populations ( Supplementary information , Fig . S7a , b ) , but 391 similar compositions of HB - and EPI - related lineages in human embryos and 392 E - assembloids , including postE - EPI , postL - EPI , UC , AME2 , PS1 / 2 , ExM1 / 2 , VE / YE 393 and AVE ( Fig . 7a ; Supplementary information , Fig . S7c , d ) . AME1 , however , was not 394 detected by scRNA - seq in E - assembloids ( Fig . 7a ) . We further split the integrated 395 UMAP data of 3D - cultured human embryos according to different developmental time 396 points and found that the D8 E - assembloids are similar to the E13 / 14 embryos in terms 397 of cell lineage compositions ( Supplementary information , Fig . S7e ) . Although AFP , 398 TTR , APOA4 , APOC3 and MTTP were only expressed in a small number of 399 VE / YE - like cells ( VE / YELCs ) in E - assembloids , very similar expression patterns of 400 lineages and signaling regulatory genes were observed in other populations between 401 human embryos and E - assembloids ( Fig . 7b , c ; Supplementary information , Fig . S7f ) . 402 For BMP and WNT signal ligands , BMP2 was mainly expressed in VE / YELCs and 403 AVELCs ; BMP4 in ExMLCs , PSLCs and AMELCs ; WNT5A in ExM1LCs and 404 PS2LCs ; WNT5B in PSLCs ; and WNT6 in AME2LCs ( Fig . 7c ) . Intercellular 405 communication analysis further showed that ExMLCs , AMELCs , XENLCs and PSLCs 406 are the main senders of BMP signaling , while AMELCs and PSLCs are also the main 407 senders of WNT signaling ( Supplementary information , Fig . S7g ) . For antagonists of 408 14 WNT , BMP and Nodal signalling , HHEX , CER1 , NOG and LEFTY1 / 2 were mainly 409 expressed in AVELCs ; SFRP1 in AVELCs ; and SFRP2 in EPILCs ( Fig . 7c ) . These 410 results suggest that extensive intercellular interactions between different cell lineages 411 exist in E - assembloids , similar to the human embryos ( Fig . 1i ; Supplementary 412 information , Fig . S1h and S7g ) . Interestingly , in the ExM2 / ExM2LC populations , we 413 observed a population of special cells , which were negative for POSTN , BMP4 and 414 BMP2 , but highly expressed SOX17 , HHEX and haemato - endothelial markers KDR , 415 S100A6 , PECAM1 , MEF2C , CD34 and CDH5 ( Fig . 7d ; Supplementary information , 416 Fig . S7h ) , possibly suggesting a initial hematopoiesis in both human embryos and 417 E - assembloids . 418 419 Discussion 420 In this study , we provided a complete cell atlas of peri - implantation embryonic 421 lineages and identified XEN and ExM markers . Our data can serve as a resource useful 422 for benchmarking human embryo models and embryonic / extraembryonic lineages in 423 vitro . The bi - laminar disc , amniotic cavity , yolk sac and outer ExM are vital tissue 424 structures in human pre - gastrulation embryos , but how these tissues develop together 425 remains unclear . Amniotic sac embryoids developed by Zheng et al . reconstructe the 426 formation of amniotic cavity or bipolar embryonic sac , and the specifications of early 427 gastrulating cells and hPGCLCs , but cannot recapitulate the development of yolk sac 428 and ExM ( Fig . 7e ) 14 . Although the recently reported post - attachment embryoid ( also 429 known as embryo assembloid ) provide a novel strategy for studying the anteroposterior 430 symmetry breaking and onset of gastrulation in the human epiblast , this model cannot 431 mimic the formation and specification of amniotic cavity , yolk sac and ExM ( Fig . 7e ) 432 10 . Our E - assembloid , a model of peri - implantation human development , can 433 recapitulate developmental hallmarks and 3D structures of human pre - gastrulation EPI 434 and HB derivatives , especially the bilaminar embryonic disc consisting of the amniotic 435 cavity and the yolk sac , and the surrounding ExMs , which have never been presented 436 simultaneously in previous embryo models ( Fig . 7e , f ) . These advanced features place 437 our E - assembloid as an important model for decoding developmental mechanisms of 438 human peri - implantation embryogenesis , such as the interactions between embryonic 439 and extraembryonic tissues , pluripotent state transitions in the epiblast 48 , XEN 440 specification , BMP signal source that drives amnion specification , and functions of 441 15 specific genes and signaling pathways . Human ExM is specified prior to gastrulation 442 and its origin remains currently unclear 49 , 50 . In 3D - cultured human embryos , RNA 443 velocity map appeared to support EPI or early PS origin of ExM ( Fig . 1g ) , but 444 clustering showed that ExM is more closely related to XEN ( Fig . 1h ) . Our results and 445 a recently reported study have shown that EPILCs can differentiate into ExMLCs 446 without XENLC specification ( Fig . 3k , 4i , 5g ) 46 ; however , whether ExM can 447 originate from XEN is still unknown . With abundant XENLCs and ExMLCs ( Fig . 7f ) , 448 combined with live imaging and lineage tracing , our E - assembloid will provide an 449 important platform for deciphering the developmental origin of ExM . Due to the low 450 efficiency of trophoblast - related cells in wrapping naive hESCs , SNCs were used to 451 construct E - assembloid . Thus , E - assembloid is not suitable for modeling 452 peri - implantation human trophoblast development . Compared to complete human 453 embryo models such as blastoids 17 - 23 , a lack of trophoblast - related cell lineages in 454 E - assembloids makes the model less ethically concerning . Therefore , whether the 455 E - assembloid can continue to develop and mimic human gastrulation and 456 organogenesis is well worth further exploring . 457 Using 3D - cultured human embryos and E - assembloids , as well as 2D and 3D 458 differentiation of AIC - N hESCs , we systematically dissected the functions of WNT , 459 BMP , and Nodal signaling on the specifications of PS , AME , ExM and XEN , and 460 deciphered the mechanisms underlying XEN and ExM specifications ( Fig . 4i , 5g , h ) . 461 Our findings will be useful for improving differentiation protocols of naive hPSCs into 462 XENLCs 44 or ExMLCs 46 . In contrast to ExMLCs , our data show that specification of 463 XENLCs functionally requires endogenous Nodal signaling , consistently with high 464 Nodal expression in human XEN ( Fig . 5a , b ) 51 . Although it has been reported that 465 Nodal inhibition does not affect the number of GATA6 + cells in human and marmoset 466 preimplantation embryos 45 , 52 , another study has shown that SOX17 + hypoblast cells 467 are undetectable in Nodal inhibitor - treated human blastocysts 53 . These seemingly 468 conflicting results may be caused by different choices of markers - SOX17 marks 469 hypoblast / XEN more specifically than GATA6 54 . 470 Our study has several limitations . First , the mechanisms affecting the capacity 471 of extraembryonic cells ( xEMs ) to wrap naive hESC clumps are not revealed . A 472 previous study proposed that robust patterning during tissue morphogenesis results 473 from cellular self - organization based on a combinatorial adhesion code instructed by 474 16 morphogen - directed gradient 55 . The view is in line with the hypothesis about the cell 475 sorting model of differential adhesion proposed by Steinberg in 1970 56 and has 476 recently been further validated in mouse synthetic embryos 57 . Therefore , detecting 477 differential adhesion molecules between naive hESCs and xEMs may be beneficial to 478 answer why SNCs , rather than hTSCs and nTEs , efficiently wrap naive hESC clumps . 479 Second , although SNCs can gradually acquire a hTSC - like identity in hTSC medium 480 43 under 2D culture condition , they cannot effectively give rise to TrB - related lineages 481 in the extended cultured E - assembloids and therefore fail to recapitulate TrB 482 development in human embryos . The results show that the fate of SNCs is influenced 483 by the culture conditions and growing environment , but the underlying molecular 484 mechanisms are unknown . Finally , in the extended cultured E - assembloid , it is not 485 fully understood how the endogenous signals secreted by SNCs and exogenous signal 486 interference truly represent signaling events during human peri - implantation 487 development . These limitations are largely due to the lack of in vitro counterparts of 488 human trophectoderm ( TE ) and HB . The establishment of faithful in vitro 489 counterparts of TE and HB , combined with the strategy of mouse ETX embryo 490 approach 58 , may help overcome the current challenges in developing complete human 491 embryo model . 492 In conclusion , this study offers important information for advancing knowledge 493 of human embryology and reproduction , and the E - assembloid provides a useful 494 model for future exploration of lineage diversification , signalling interactions and 495 tissue patterning during human peri - implantation development . 496 497 Acknowledgements 498 This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development 499 Program of China ( 2022YFA1103100 and 2021YFA0805700 ) , the National Natural 500 Science Foundation of China ( 32130034 , 82192874 and 82160294 ) , the National Key 501 Research and Development Program of China ( 2020YFA0112700 ) , Major Basic 502 Research Project of Science and Technology of Yunnan ( 202102AA100007 , 503 202001BC070001 and 2019FY002 ) , the Joint Special Funds for the Department of 504 Science and Technology of Yunnan Province (cid:2) Kunming Medical University 505 ( 202101AY070001 - 260 and 202301AY070001 - 298 ) .

All donated embryos were 914 supernumerary frozen embryos after IVF clinic treatment . The informed consent 915 process for embryo donation complied with International Society for Stem Cell 916 Research ( ISSCR ) Guidelines ( 2016 / 2021 ) and Ethical Guidelines for Human 917 Embryonic Stem Cell research ( 2003 ) jointly issued by Ministry of Science and 918 Technology and Ministry of Health of People’s Republic of China . All the donor 919 couples had signed the informed consent for voluntary donations of supernumerary 920 embryos for this study . No financial inducements were offered for the donations . 921 All experiments of in vitro culture for human E - assembloids complied with the 922 2016 / 2021 ISSCR Guidelines 59 , 60 . All E - assembloids were terminated by no later 923 than Day 9 and did not develop beyond the appearance of primitive streak or generate 924 the initial nervous system , meeting the internationally recognized ethical limit for 925 human embryo model 59 , 60 . The research was approved by the Medical Ethics 926 Committee of Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research . 927 Embryo manipulation 928 To control the variability of the blastocysts , we evaluated the quality of the 929 embryos before use . According to the Gardner’s scoring system 61 , thawed blastocysts 930 were given numerical scores from 1 to 6 based on their expansion degree and hatching 931 status . The blastocysts with expansion and hatching status above 3 and with visible 932 inner cell mass above grade B were used in the study . Frozen - thawed human 933 blastocysts ( 5 - 6 days post - fertilization ) were gently treated by acidic Tyrode’s 934 solution ( Sigma , T1788 ) to remove the zona pellucida 4 . In vitro 3D culture , frozen 935 section staining and single - cell isolation of human embryos were performed according 936 to previously published methods 4 . To verify the function of WNT and BMP signaling , 937 IWP2 ( 2 μ M , Selleck , S7085 ) and LDN193189 - 2HCl ( LDN , 200 nM , Selleck , S7507 ) 938 were used during 3D - culture of human embryos from embryonic day ( E6 - 14 ) 939 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S5h ) . 940 33 In this study , 3D - cultured human embryos were selected for 10x sequencing 941 according to previously established two criteria : 1 ) obvious expansion over culture ; 942 and 2 ) absence of obvious cell death or fragmented phenotype 4 . The numbers and the 943 size of human embryos used for 10x sequencing are shown in Supplementary 944 information , Fig . S1a . 945 Derivation and culture of naïve hESC lines in 21 % O 2 946 Blastocysts were seeded on mouse embryonic fibroblast ( Millipore , PMEF - CFL ) 947 feeder cells ( hereafter referred to as feeders ) inactivated by mitomycin C ( Sigma , 948 M0503 ) . After 48 hours , hESC - like outgrowths became visible in the attached 949 embryos , was mechanically transferred into 50 % TrypLE ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 950 12605 - 028 ) and incubated for 10 - 15 min at 37 (cid:2) . Alternatively , if the hESC - like 951 outgrowth was invisible , the whole attached embryo was incubated with 50 % TrypLE 952 for 10 - 15 min at 37 (cid:2) . Next , the digested hESC - like outgrowth ( or whole embryo ) 953 was transferred into a drop of AIC - N medium and dissociated into single cells by 954 mildly pipetting up and down with a finely drawn Pasteur pipette . All dissociated 955 single cells were scattered onto feeders . After 3 - 5 days , some obvious naïve hESC 956 colonies were observed and further dissociated into single cells by 50 % TrypLE for 957 passaging .

According to the expression pattern 1271 of lineage markers , these structures are divided into three types ( Fig . 3b ) . The 1272 percentage of different types of structures were quantified manually using the 1273 confocal microscope ( Leica SP8 ) . Statistical analysis and plotting were performed 1274 with GraphPad Prism 9 . 1275 To quantify the proportion of different types of cells or embryoids , and number 1276 of specific cell types in embryoids , 2D cell cultures and frozen sections of different 1277 types of embryoids were stained with indicated markers . The percentage of different 1278 types of cells or embryoids , and number of specific cell types in embryoids were then 1279 quantified manually using the confocal microscope ( Leica SP8 ) . Statistical analysis 1280 and plotting were performed with GraphPad Prism 9 . 1281 To measure the diameters of developing E - assembloids , E - assembloids at 1282 different time points were fixed in 4 % PFA , and randomly photographed by phase 1283 contrast microscope after Matrigel was depolymerized . Images were processed and 1284 diameters of E - assembloids were measured with Image J software . Statistical analysis 1285 and plotting were performed with GraphPad Prism 9 . 1286 RNA sequencing and data analysis 1287 Adherently growing cells ( BICs grown on Matrigel and hTSCs grown on Col IV ) 1288 were collected by dissociating into single cells with 50 % TrypLE . For AIC - N hESCs 1289 and hTSCs grown on feeders , the colonies were detached from feeders by exposure to 1290 44 Collagenase type IV for 60 - 90 min , and the detached colonies were collected . For 1291 differentiated AIC - N hESC clumps embedded in Matrigel droplets , the cultures were 1292 subjected to Cell Recovery Solution ( Corning , 354253 ) at 4 (cid:2) for 1 h . After Matrigel 1293 was depolymerized , the differentiated AIC - N hESC clumps were collected . All 1294 cultures were washed twice in PBS . Total RNA of AIC - N hESCs , hTSCs , BICs and 1295 differentiated AIC - N hESC clumps was isolated with the TRIzol™ Reagent ( Thermo 1296 Fisher Scientific , 15596018 ) . The 2×150 bp paired end libraries were sequenced with 1297 Illumina HiSeq X Ten instrument . Library construction and sequencing were 1298 performed by Annoroad Gene Technology ( http : / / www . annoroad . com / ) . The 1299 published data used in this study are from reset hPSCs 33 , 3iL hPSCs 64 , human EPS 1300 cells 65 , 66 , 5i / LAF hPSCs 67 , AIC - hPSCs 35 , NHSM4i hPSCs 68 , 69 , 1301 HENSM / HENSM - ACT hPSCs 34 , HNES cells 70 , human rsESCs 71 and conventional 1302 ( primed ) hPSCs . Reads were mapped to human genome hg38 using HISAT2 ( v2 . 2 . 1 ) 1303 with GENECODE v30 . The counts and FPKM values for each gene were calculated 1304 with tringTie ( v2 . 1 . 1 ) . We identified the most variable genes through fitting a 1305 non - linear regression curve between average log 2 ( FPKM ) and the square of 1306 coefficient of variation according to the methods described 41 , 54 . Principal components 1307 analysis was performed using princomp function from the R stats package based on 1308 the covariance matrix .

We calculated the average gene expression level of different cell 1313 types using the AverageExpression function in the Seurat . Then , specifific thresholds 1314 were applied along the x - axis ( average log 2 FPKM > 5 ) and y - axis ( log CV 2 > 0 . 2 ) to 1315 identify the most variable genes . Finally , the remaining genes are used to calculate the 1316 Pearson correlation among different cell types . 1317 Bisulfite sequencing and data analysis 1318 Paired - end sequencing was performed on HiSeq X Ten platform ( Illumina ) . 1319 Library construction and sequencing were completed by Annoroad Gene Technology 1320 ( http : / / www . annoroad . com / ) . 1321 The sequencing quality of paired end 150bp raw reads were checked by FastQC 1322 45 ( v0 . 11 . 8 ) ( https : / / www . bioinformatics . babraham . ac . uk / projects / fastqc / ) . Reads were 1323 then aligned to human reference genome ( GRCh38 ) using BSMAP ( v2 . 7 . 4 ) allowing 1324 2 mismatches ( - v 2 ) , up to one multiple hits ( - w 1 ) , map to all four possible strands 1325 ( - n 1 ) 72 . Methylation levels over each cytosine were calculated using BSMAP ( v2 . 7 . 4 ) 1326 methratio . py script . Methylation levels over different genomic regions were extracted 1327 using a customized Python script 1328 ( https : / / github . com / MoPie / 20210607LTQProject / extractMeth . py ) . Promoters were 1329 defined as upstream 1kb and downstream 1kb of transcription start sites . CpG islands 1330 ( CGIs ) coordinates were downloaded from UCSC genome browser 1331 ( http : / / hgdownload . cse . ucsc . edu / goldenpath / hg38 / database / cpgIslandExt . txt . gz ) . 1332 Promoter CGIs on chromosome X were calculated using Bedtools intersect function 1333 with default parameter 73 . Promoter non - CpG islands were defined as promoter with 1334 no CGIs . Random 2kb bins were permutated with Bedtools shuffle function by 1335 excluding CGIs and promoter regions 73 . Data were then visualized in R with boxplot ( ) 1336 function and pheatmap ( ) function from pheatmap package 1337 ( https : / / cran . r - project . org / web / packages / pheatmap / ) . Global comparison of 1338 methylation between samples was calculated by averaging CpG methylation levels 1339 over indicated windows using the bisulfite feature methylation pipeline in SeqMonk . 1340 Pseudocolour scatter plots of methylation levels over indicated windows were 1341 generated using R . 1342 Single cell dissociation , RNA sequencing and data processing 1343 Single cell dissociation of 3D - cultured human embryos was optimized based on 1344 our previous work and other report 4 , 74 . Briefly , embryos were washed in PBS three 1345 times , washed with TrypLE two times and incubated in TrypLE at 37 (cid:2) for 25 - 30 min . 1346 The embryos were dissociated into single cells by mouth pipetting in 1 % DFBS / PBS . 1347 E - assembloids grown in indicated conditions at different time points were subjected 1348 to Cell Recovery Solution at 4 (cid:2) for 1 h . After Matrigel was depolymerized , 1349 E - assembloids were transferred into TrypLE containing 1 mg / ml Dispase ( Corning , 1350 354235 ) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C . E - assembloids were gently dissociated 1351 into single cells by pipetting up and down , filtered through a 20 μ m cell strainer , 1352 centrifuged , suspended in PBS containing 0 . 04 % BSA and counted using a 1353 hemocytometer . Single cell suspension of E - assembloids and embryos were loaded 1354 46 into the 10x Genomics Chromium system within 30 minutes after dissociation . 10x 1355 Genomics v3 or v3 . 1 libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s 1356 instructions . Libraries were sequenced with a minimum coverage of 30 000 raw reads 1357 per cell on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten with 150 - bp paired - end sequencing , which was 1358 performed by Annoroad Gene Technology ( http : / / www . annoroad . com / ) . Sequencing 1359 data was aligned and quantified using the Cell Ranger Pipeline v3 . 0 . 1 ( 10x Genomics ) 1360 against the GRCh38 reference genome . Data from 10x Genomics for E - assembloids 1361 or 3D - cultured embryos were filtered based on number of expressed genes and 1362 expression level of mitochondrial genes ( below 20 % ) . Cell doublets were removed by 1363 DoubletFinder ( v2 . 0 . 3 ) with assuming multiplet rate according to the loaded cells 1364 number ( refer to Multiplet Rate Table provided in the 10x Genomics User Guide ) . 1365 Further analyses were performed using Seurat package ( v 4 . 0 . 3 ) 75 . The raw 1366 counts were normalized and scaled with default parameters . Top 2000 most variable 1367 genes were identified and used for dimensionality reduction with PCA and followed 1368 with non - linear dimensionality reduction using UMAP . Cell types were defined based 1369 on the lineage markers and clusters identified through FindClusters function . Data 1370 was visualized with the UMAP dimensionality reduction . DEGs were identified with 1371 the FindAllMarkers ( ) function in Seurat and filtered with ( P adj of Wilcoxon’s 1372 rank - sum test < 0 . 05 , log 2 ( FC ) (cid:2) > (cid:2) 0 . 25 and expressed in > 25 % of cells of the 1373 given cluster . E - assembloidE - assembloid 1374 For 10x Genomics data from E - assembloids , RPS4Y1 expression was used to 1375 help determine the source of the cells as the two cell lines used to construct 1376 E - assembloids are of different genders . The male AIC - N hESC derivatives were 1377 further filtered with RPS4Y1 expression ( normalized and natural - log ( log1p ) 1378 transformed value > 1 ) , the remaining cells were integrated with epiblast or hypoblast 1379 derivatives from 3D - cultured embryos . Data integration was performed with 1380 IntegrateData ( ) function . Cells from E - assembloids were classified based on 10x 1381 Genomics data of 3D - cultured human embryos with the TransferData ( ) function in 1382 Seurat , and predicted cell types were displayed on UMAP of integrated Seurat object . 1383 The intercellular communication networks of 3D - cultured human embryos and 1384 E - assembloids were analysed following the published method 76 implemented in 1385 CellChat ( https : / / github . com / sqjin / CellChat ) , the netVisual _ signalingRole function 1386 was used to visualize the communication pattern among different cells . VlnPlots of 1387 47 different genes were plotted with VlnPlot function of Seurat R package . 1388 1389 Statistical analysis 1390 Statistical tests were performed on GraphPad Prism 9 software and Microsoft 1391 office Excel 2019 . Data were checked for normal distribution and equal variances 1392 before each parametric statistical test was performed . Where appropriate , t - tests were 1393 performed with Welch’s correction if variance between groups was not equal . ANOVA 1394 tests were performed with a Dunnett ' s multiple comparisons test if variance between 1395 groups was not equal .
