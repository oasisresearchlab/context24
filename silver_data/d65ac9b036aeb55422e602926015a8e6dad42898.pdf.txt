Think aloud and interview were conducted during and after the creative design task to understand the content of the memorising precedents , association , and combination of information processes . The 71 creative designs were then assessed by five experts in creative design . The results from this study revealed that participants who generated high - creativity design tend to memorize various topic - related precedents , associate items based on topic - related information , and combine topic - related information with products . Participants who generated low - creativity design tend to memorize characteristics of a specific space of the design topic , associate items based on specific topic - related information , and add the topic - related pattern to a product .

Although designers have various design strategies , most of the strategies included divergent thinking and convergent thinking processes ( Childs et al . , 2022 ) . Divergent thinking processes allow designers to generate various ideas while convergent thinking processes allow designers to select the best ideas ( Dubberly , 2012 ) . Some researchers tried to integrate convergent and divergent phase of creative design processes ( Houzangbe et al . , 2022 ) ; While the others tended to understand the relations between convergent and divergent phase as iteration and considered the iteration of design processes is a divergent and convergent thinking iteration process ( Cross , 2021 ) . Divergent thinking mainly happens in the idea generation process under design areas ( Shah et al . , 2012 ) . This idea - generation process is related to cognitive memorising precedents ( Kim & Kim , 2015 ) , association ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) , and combination of information ( Liu et al . , 2020 ; Luo et al . , 2021 ) . In an idea - generation process , designers need to seek inspiration from external examples or internal design experience and knowledge ( Xue et al . , 2020 ) . Memorising precedents can be divided into two conditions ( Tulving , 1984 ) . The first condition is memorising semantic precedents which are related to facts and concepts constructed by data or organized knowledge ( Tulving , 1984 ) . The other condition is memorising episodic precedents which are related to events and specific perceptible experiences ( Tulving , 1984 ) . Researchers have revealed that in an idea - generation process memorising episodic precedents can help designers generate more initial ideas while memorising semantic precedents allow designers to develop the ideas in a more comprehensive way ( Chrysikou et al . , 2016 ; Mertens et al . , 2020 ; Xue et al . , 2020 ) . The ability of cognitive association of information is defined as the linking of two or more elements and defining the relations . It can be divided into remote association , ( the ability to linking of two or more irrelated elements ) and common association ( the ability to linking of two or more related elements ) ( Yin et al . , 2022 ) . Remote association is considered one of the methods to generate creative ideas ( Beda et al . , 2020 ) . Combination is also considered an essential process for generating creative ideas in divergent thinking processes ( Wan & Chiu , 2002 ; Beda et al . , 2020 ) . If the concepts used to combine are ordinary , the results of conceptual combination may be ordinary too . To increase the variety of conceptual combination , designers need to combine different elements , which is also called remote combination ( Wilkenfeld & Ward , 2001 ) . Although researchers have identified the relations between the creative results and cognitive memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes , this identification is mainly based on separate research . Also , studies are mainly related to detecting how the ability on memorising precedents , association , or combination of information affects the idea generation process instead of the creative design processes . This loss of context is one of the reasons why existing studies cannot identify how these abilities on memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes affected the creative design quality . Therefore , this study aims to identify how the ability on memorising precedents , association , or combination of information affects the creative design processes , especially the creative design quality . 2 METHODOLOGY To achieve the research aim , think aloud and interview were conducted to identify the performance of cognitive abilities ( memorising precedents , association , or combination of information ) in a creative design process . Then , the creative design generated from think aloud process were assessed . ICED23 3057 2 . 1 Data collection study 2 . 1 . 1 Participants Seventy - one design - background participants ( 23 male , 48 female ; aged from 20 - 29 ) were recruited . All participants have experience in using think aloud method in research and can use hand - drawing methods to express their ideas . 2 . 1 . 2 Method In the study , participants were asked to finish a creative design task . During the task , participants were asked to use think - aloud method to report their cognitive processes . After the design task , participants were asked to conduct an interview , where they need to detailed explain which information they have memorized , associated and combined . 2 . 1 . 3 Creative design task The creative task ( designing a product using the provocation of the word ‘fish’ within one hour ) that the participants need to finish is selected from the 2019 China design - major graduate - student admission exam tasks . The reason why this creative design task is selected is out of the consideration that the task is a common topic and participants do not have barriers to understanding the task . Also , the results of the creative task will be assessed by experts in creative design areas . The creative task , thus , should be a common task that can be assessed by general experts in creative design areas . THINK ALOUD Think aloud is a common method used in reporting mental processes of participants ( Lewis , 1982 ; Peskin & Ellenbogen , 2019 ) . In this creative task process , think - aloud method is used to collect participants ' cognitive process on memorising precedents , association , and combination of information . In the think - aloud process , participants were first explained what is memorising precedents , association , and combination of information . Memorising precedents is explained as memorising previous experience , concepts , or facts . Association is explained as associating two or more related or irrelated concepts . Combination is explained as two or more concepts being mentally synthesised . Then , participants were asked to report the three processes during their creative design processes . The instruction of think - aloud method used in this study can be seen in Figure 1 . Although participants may have different visualization skills , they have been announced that their outputs will not be justified by the visualization skills ; instead , their design will be assessed based on the creativity quality levels . 2 . 1 . 4 Interview Think aloud can report participants ' cognitive thinking process in real time . However , sometimes researchers may expect a deeper explanation of cognitive thinking processes . Interrupting participants in a creative design process may also interrupt participants thinking processes . Therefore , after the think - aloud , an interview was conducted as a supplement to understand which information has been memorised , associated , and combined by participants during creative design processes . The questions asked in interview are included in Figure 1 . 2 . 1 . 5 Protocol Figure 1 is an overview of the protocol . Before the study , participants were sent the information sheet and the consent form . They can ask any questions they have . If there are no questions , they need to sign the consent form . At the beginning of the study , participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire which was built up by Qualtrics . This questionnaire collected participants basic information such as educational background and design experience . The online questionnaire was sent through email . Participants need around 5 minutes to fill out the questionnaire . Then , participants were introduced the think - aloud method and the cognitive processes that they need to report . After participants were ensured they understand how to conduct a think aloud in a creative design and what they need to report , participants were asked to design a product using the provocation of the word ‘fish’ in one hour and report the cognitive process through the think - aloud method . 3058 ICED23 Participants need to draw one product as their final solution on A4 paper , but they were open to sketching anything they want on the paper too . Participants were also announced that they were free to draw their ideas in a colorful or black - and - white form . They will not be justified by whether their ideas are colorful or not . As soon as the creative design task was finishes , participants were asked to conduct the interview to deeply explain what they have memorised , associated , and combinated . Participants can access their designs as a reminder to recall their cognitive processes . After the interview , participants need to identify whether they have expressed their solutions clearly . Participants were allowed to add annotations to explain their ideas but were not allowed to change what they have drawn . The think - aloud and interview processes were recorded by audio with the permission of participants . Figure 1 . An overview about the data collection study protocol 2 . 2 Data assessment study After the data collection study , the creative design quality of the solutions generated from participants needs to be assessed . 2 . 2 . 1 Participants Five experts ( 3 females and 2 males , aged 31 - 40 ) , who have more than 10 - year experience in creative design , were selected as judges ( Baer et al . , 2004 ) . Also , the judges should have experience in assessing creative design sketching in the past year . 2 . 2 . 2 Method Judges were asked to assess the 71 creative design outputs using Consensual Assessment Technique ( CAT ; ( Amabile , 1982 ) . CAT ( Amabile , 1982 ) is a no - criteria assessment method . This method recommends that judgers should be experts who are familiar with the relative domain areas . It commonly asks judgers to give a creativity score from 1 to 5 based on their understanding of creativity without explaining why they give this score . CAT has been widely used and verified ( Christiaans , 2002 ) . Its inter - rater reliabilities are usually more than 0 . 70 ( Amabile , 2018 , Baer et al . , 2004 ) . However , one limitation of CAT is that the assessment relies on experts in relative domains . If the creative tasks involve several different domains ( such as poems , designs , and stories ) , the conditions will be complex and hard to recruit raters ( Kaufman et al . , 2008 , Baer , 1991 ) . ICED23 3059 Considering the judges were all from China , where the grading levels are mainly divided into six levels , the CAT was adapted into six levels correspondingly . Also , the explanation on each assessment level was displayed to judgers at the beginning of the assessment ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 . The explanation on adjusted CAT method . Level Explanation on the creative quality of the creative design A The creative design is not creative B The creative design is creative but just in a very low level C The creative design is creative but just in slightly low level D The creative design is creative E The creative design is in a high creative level F The creative design is in an excellent creative level 2 . 2 . 3 Protocol Before the study , participants were sent the information sheet and the consent form . They can ask any questions they have . If there are no questions , they need to sign the consent form . At the beginning of the study , judges were asked to complete an online questionnaire which was built up by Qualtrics . This questionnaire collected judges basic information such as educational background and design assessment experience . The online questionnaire was sent through email . Judges need around 5 minutes to fill out the questionnaire . Only the judges who have more than 10 - year experience in creative and have experience in assessing creative design sketches during the past year can move the assessment task . Judges who satisfied the selection requirement were then sent the assessment task questionnaire which was also built up by Qualtrics . In this questionnaire , participants were first introduced to how to assess the creative design using CAT . To be specific , participants were asked to select one level from A to F to represent the creativity quality level of each creative design . Also , they were asked that their assessment should base on the ideas instead of the visualization skills . Then , participants were introduced that these creative design were generated from the creative design task " design a product using the provocation of the word ‘fish’ in one hour " . Participants have seven days to finish the assessment . They were suggested to pause the assessment when they felt bored or tired , but they need to ensure that their justification was fair for the 71 creative designs . 3 RESULTS To identify how the ability on memorising precedents , association , or combination of information affects the creative design quality , the content of memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes and the creative design quality was identified . Then , the two datasets were combined to answer the research questions . 3 . 1 Content of memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes Thematic analysis was used to analyse the content of the memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes . Nvivo ( Version 12 ) , a software developed for qualitative data analysis ( Phillips & Lu , 2018 ) , was applied to assist the thematic analysis processes . Thematic analysis results were shown in Table 2 . Four themes , 12 second codes , and 28 third codes were summarized . Table 2 .

Level A was assigned Score 6 ; Level B was assigned Score 5 ; Level C was assigned Score 4 ; Level D was assigned Score 3 ; Level E was assigned Score 2 ; Level 6 was assigned Score 1 . Minimum values , maximum values , mean values , and standard deviation ( SD ) of creative outputs assessment data were first calculated ( Table 3 ) . Coefficient alpha for the results was 0 . 708 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 585 – 0 . 803 ) , which indicated a reliable level internal consistency . The average score of five judges for a specific design was used to represent the creative design quality of this design . Subjectively , if the creative design quality ranged between Score 3 to Score 6 ( including Score 3 ) , the corresponding creative design was considered a high - creativity design . If the creative design quality ranged between Score 1 to Score 3 ( not including Score 3 ) , the corresponding creative design was considered a low - creativity design . Based on this grouping method , 42 designs were grouped as high - creativity design while 29 designs were grouped as low - creativity design . The examples of high - creativity and low - creativity designs are shown in Table 4 . ICED23 3061 Table 3 .

Table 4 is an overview of the combined results . 4 . 1 Relations between content of memorising precedents and creative design quality Most of the participants ( 65 ) memorizing precedents at the beginning of a creative design process , which indicated that memorising precedents is a necessary process in design . Precedents related to the design topic and precedents related to products were the two kinds of precedents mainly memorised . As for the participants who generated a high - creativity design , they tended to memorize topic - related precedents . Participants have reported that they memorized characteristics of fish ( design topic ) , conditions of usage , fish products they have met before , and cartoon fish . Participants who generated a low - creativity design were more likely to memorize the characteristics of fish ( design topic ) . Although both of the groups ' participants memorized characteristics of the design topic , the content of memorising was different . Participants who generated a high - creativity design memorized various precedents which they thought 3062 ICED23 may have the potential to be the sources of their ideas while participants who generated a low - creativity design were more likely to focus on a specific space of fish ( design topic ) , such as the sharks and goldfish . When memorizing precedents related to products , the participants who generated a low - creativity design have the tendency to memorize the topic - related products , such as the function or shape of the topic - related products . However , as for the participants who generated a high - creativity design , they preferred to memorize various products which they thought may have the potential to be the source of ideas . Although they also memorized the function or shape of the topic - related products , they did not limit themselves to topic - related areas . 4 . 2 Relations between content of information association and creative design quality Information association often happens after memorizing processes . This indicated the association processes are based on the results of memorizing . Some participants who generated low - creativity design do not report their association processes in a creative design . This may be because these people have decided which product they will design and the appearance of the product . Therefore , what they need to do was to select a good topic - related shape and combine it with the product that they have decided to design . In information association processes , participants who generated high - creativity design may associate based on fish - related ( topic - related ) information , such as shapes similar to fish , where the fish can be used , the meaning of fish , products related to fish ( such as boats ) , places where fish live ( such as oceans ) , and fish - related lectures , presentations , or films . As for the participants who generated low - creativity design , what they associated was mainly with different kinds of fish and fish - related biology ( such as birds , flowers , water plants , and shells ) . Also , there were some association results similar to participants who generated high - creativity design , such as places where fish live , the shape of fish , and fish - related products . During this association , both common association and remote association may happen . However , considering the unclear boundary between remote association and common association , this association forms results were less reliable . For example , some participants ( mainly participants who generated high - creativity design ) thought the association between fish to the ocean was a common association while some other participants ( mainly participants who generated low - creativity design ) thought it was a remote association . The association results of participants who generated high - creativity design were mainly related to products while that of participants who generated low - creativity design were related to topic information . This may explain why some participants can generate high - creativity design . The creative task is limited to product design . If participants associate more product - related information , they may have more ideas on what they can design . 4 . 3 Relations between content of information combination and creative design quality Information combination processes are often based on memorizing precedents and information association . Therefore , logically , combination processes happen after memorizing precedents and information association . Participants who generated high - creativity design tended to combine topic - related information from memorizing precedents and information association with products . Although participants have tried to combine information in a remote combination way , this remote combination was hard to be achieved . Participants who generated low - creativity design tended to add the topic - related pattern to a product . This difference in combination may be from the different cognitive working load capabilities . Participants who generated low - creativity design may have a lower working memory capacity . This means participants were curbed to extract useful information on topic - related information and products at the same time , which curbed them to take advantages of information they have associated with and memorized effectively . 4 . 4 Limitation This study focused on how memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes affected creative design quality . However , the other factors that may also affect creative design quality were not included such as the environment , the cultural background , idea expression ICED23 3063 ability , and experience in creative design . In the future , the influence of other factors also needs to be identified . In addition , the study adapted CAT as the creative design quality assessment method . Although CAT is a popular assessment method in product creativity , it only includes limited creativity levels and may not distinguish the creative design quality in an effective way . Finally , the study divided the creative design quality subjectively based on the creative scores of creative design . Whether this division method is reliable needs to be further identified . In the future , more division methods will be attempted . 5 CONCLUSION The study identified the relations between creative design quality and content of memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes . 71 participants were recruited to finish a creative design task . During the task , participants were asked to use think - aloud method to report their memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes . After the study , participants were asked to have an interview to deeply explain these processes . 71 creative designs were then assessed by five experts in creative design . The results from this study revealed that participants who generated high - creativity design tend to memorize various topic - related precedents , associate based on topic - related information , and combine topic - related information with products . Participants who generated low - creativity design tend to memorize characteristics of a specific space of design topic , associate based on specific topic - related information , and add the topic - related pattern to a product . The study revealed different content of memorising precedents , association , or combination of information processes and linked it with creative design quality . The results of this study can be used to help designers and researchers to better understand which kind of cognitive performance can lead to higher creative design quality . Also , the study can be used as a cue to help researchers and designers to develop creative design models from cognitive levels and considered how to stimulate creative quality of design .
