TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM SIZE , CEO DOMINANCE , AND FIRM PERFORMANCE : THE MODERATING ROLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL TURBULENCE AND DISCRETION JERAYR HALEBLIAN SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN University of Southern California Adopting an information - processing perspective and drawing on work in social psychology , this study examined the effects of top management team size and chief executive officer ( CEO ) dominance on firm perfor - mance in different environments . Data from 47 organizations revealed that firms with large teams performed better and firms with dominant CEOs performed worse in a turbulent environment than in a stable one . In addition , the association between team size and CEO dominance , and firm performance , is significant in an environment that allows top managers high discretion in making strategic choices but is not signif - icant in a low - discretion environment . Scholars in strategic management have recently emphasized the role of top management teams in strategy formation and organizational perfor - mance ( Hambrick & Mason , 1984 ) . In explaining the choices top managers make , scholars taking this perspective often emphasize the importance of understanding such demographic characteristics as the ages , organizational tenures , functional backgrounds , and educations of top managers as well as the distributional properties of those variables . Empirical work on the asso - ciation between top team demographics and firm performance is not abun - dant , even though there is evidence that they are related ( Norburn & Birley , 1988 ) . For example , several researchers have examined the association be - tween functional backgrounds and firm performance ( Gupta & Govindarajan , 1984 ; Michel & Hambrick , 1992 ) . Murray ( 1989 ) extended this work by ex - amining temporal and occupational heterogeneity , reporting mixed results . Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven ( 1990 ) and Cooper and Bruno ( 1977 ) , studying new ventures , reported associations between top team demographics and sales growth . Finally , in a study of bankrupt and survivor firms in a matched - pair sample , Hambrick and D ' Aveni ( 1992 ) found that average top management team tenure and functional experience in marketing , opera - tions , and R & D were lower in bankrupts than in survivors . We would like to thank Gregory Dess and Yong Min Kim for their valuable comments on earlier drafts of this article . 844 Haleblian and Finkelstein This brief review indicates that important aspects of group composition have been somewhat underexplored ; those aspects include both the extent to which a firm ' s chief executive officer ( CEO ) dominates the distribution of power within its top management team and the size of the team . CEO dom - inance and team size , both potentially important constructs because of their impact on the information - processing capabilities of top management teams , were the focus of this study . A top management team can be considered the information - processing center of an organization in its relationship with its environment ( Thomp - son , 1967 ) . Environments vary in their degree of turbulence or stability ( Dess & Beard , 1984 ) and in the degree of managerial discretion they permit ( Ham - brick & Finkelstein , 1987 ) . Although environments can be characterized along several dimensions , in this study we focused on turbulence and dis - cretion because of their expected impact on the relationship between top management team characteristics and performance . Turbulence refers to volatility or difficult - to - predict discontinuities in an environment ( Aldrich , 1979 ; Dess & Beard , 1984 ; Keats & Hitt , 1988 ) . Turbulent environments increase both an organization ' s external linkages and the rate of change in those linkages ( Aldrich , 1979 ; Emery & Trist , 1965 ) . In contrast , stable environments are more predictable , with a more estab - lished set of relatively unchanging actors . Team size and power distribution help determine the nature of a top team ' s information - processing capabili - ties . Largeness provides increased capabilities and viewpoints , and a bal - anced power distribution facilitates information sharing and idea exchange , all of which can be critical in turbulent environments . Hence , an underlying premise to this study was that firms that match information - processing ca - pabilities to environmental requirements do better than those that do not . Managerial discretion refers to the latitude of action top management teams have in making strategic choices ( Hambrick & Finkelstein , 1987 ) . Al - though discretion can be conceptualized at individual , organizational , and environmental levels of analysis , in this study we focused only on environ - ment - level discretion , henceforth called environmental discretion . Because environments differ in the extent to which they confer discretion to top managers , managerial characteristics will not always predict organizational outcomes . As a result , we would expect team size and CEO dominance to be related to performance when environmental discretion is high , but not when it is low . BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES Top Management Team Size There has been relatively little work on the effects of team size in the research literature on top management teams , and team size has typically been modeled as a control variable ( Bantel & Jackson , 1989 ; Jackson , Brett , Sessa , Cooper , Julin , & Peyronnin , 1991 ; Wagner , Pfeffer , & O ' Reilly , 1984 ; Wiersema & Bantel , 1992 ) . In one of the few studies that modeled team size 1993 845 Academy of Management Journal as a predictor variable , Hambrick and D ' Aveni ( 1992 ) found that firms near - ing bankruptcy tended to have smaller teams than matched - paired survi - vors . In addition , two studies of founding teams in high - technology firms reported that team size was associated with growth , ostensibly because larger teams provided more capabilities ( Cooper & Bruno , 1977 ; Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven , 1990 ) . In contrast to the researchers studying top teams , social psychology scholars have been studying the effects of group size for some time . This work is informative because , although top teams are unique in terms of their level of decision - making responsibility and impact on the organizations , they are also similar to other groups in some fundamental ways . For exam - ple , other groups are " integrated by direct communication demands , inter - act [ ing ] functionally and continuously towards the achievement of an end " ( James , 1951 : 475 ) , just as top teams are ( Keck , 1990 ) . Steiner ( 1972 ) argued that group productivity is composed of potential productivity minus losses resulting from faulty process . He defined poten - tial group productivity as the " maximum level of productivity that can occur when an individual or group employs its supply of resources to meet the task demands of the work situation " ( 1972 : 68 ) . However , evidence on how group size affects process gains and losses is conflicting . Several scholars have argued that large groups are superior to small ones because big groups have more capabilities and resources with which to solve group tasks ( Hill , 1982 ; Jackson , 1992 ; Shull , Delbecq , & Cummings , 1970 ) . Large groups can enhance problem - solving capabilities by ( 1 ) increasing the number of items of information that can be absorbed and recalled , ( 2 ) in - creasing the number of critical judgments available to correct errors in inference and analysis , ( 3 ) increasing the number of potential solution strat - egies , and ( 4 ) increasing the range of perspectives brought to bear on a problem ( Harrison , 1975 ; Hoffman & Maier , 1961 ; Shaw , 1981 ; Shull et al . , 1970 ) . Such an increase in capabilities and resources may help account for the higher - quality decisions sometimes reported in large groups ( Cummings , Huber , & Arendt , 1974 ; Ziller , 1957 ) . For example , a group ' s performance has been found to be a positive function of its members ' abilities ( Hoffman , 1979 ; Shaw , 1976 ) , with increases in team size expanding the resources available to solve a problem ( Hare , 1976 ) . This view is consistent with Hambrick and D ' Aveni ' s argument that " at a basic level , the resources available on a team result from how many people are on it " ( 1992 : 1449 ) . It is also the logic that Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven ( 1990 ) used in discussing why large teams were advantageous in the new ventures they studied . Hence , large top man - agement teams have greater information - processing and decision - making ca - pabilities than small teams . Although the advantages of large groups are considerable , their size also tends to create coordination and communication problems that smaller groups do not have ( Blau , 1970 ; Shaw & Harkey , 1976 ) . Small groups tend to be more cohesive , and their members experience more satisfaction than is common in large groups ( Shaw , 1981 ; Swap , 1984 ) . They also tend to make 846 August Haleblian and Finkelstein decisions and reach consensus faster than large groups ( Shull et al . , 1970 ; Thomas & Fink , 1963 ) . So , although decision quality in small groups tends not to match that in large groups , small groups may be more appropriate when problem - solving tasks are relatively easy ( Hare , 1952 ) . Environmental Turbulence as a Moderator Although existing research is split on the relative merits of large and small top management teams , the team size that is appropriate may very well depend on an organization ' s environment . The degree of environmental tur - bulence or stability greatly influences the information - processing require - ments of a top team and the complexity of managerial work . In much the same way that the nature of a group ' s task moderates the relationship be - tween group size and productivity ( Goodman , Ravlin , & Schminke , 1987 ) , the turbulence of an organization ' s environment moderates the association between top team size and firm performance . The more turbulent the envi - ronment , the more varied and fragmented the nature of managerial work ( Mintzberg , 1973 ) and the greater the information - processing demands on the top team ( Daft , Sormunen , & Parks , 1988 ) . As Galbraith argued , " The greater the task uncertainty , the greater the amount of information that must be processed among decision makers during task execution in order to achieve a given level of performance " ( 1973 : 4 ) . Turbulent environments increase information - processing needs by creating new opportunities and crises that often necessitate strategic and structural adaptations ( Galbraith , 1973 ) . Hence , as an environment grows more turbulent and a firm ' s deci - sion - making tasks grow more difficult , managers have greater information - processing requirements . Under these conditions , there is great need for large teams to cope with the added unpredictability of the environment ( Thompson , 1967 ; Tushman & Keck , 1990 ) . The greater information - processing capabilities of large teams ( e . g . , Shull et al . , 1970 ) are needed to help firms adapt to the greater infor - mation - processing requirements of turbulent environments . The benefits that accrue from the enhanced capabilities of large teams are likely to out - weigh the costs associated with the communication and coordination prob - lems that also arise in large teams . As Miller noted , " The hiring of more managers to reduce the burden of the CEO " ( 1992 : 162 ) may be needed in turbulent environments . Hence , we would expect firm performance to be positively associated with top team size in turbulent environments . In contrast , although all top managerial jobs are characterized by some complexity , information - processing requirements are not as intense in stable environments ( Ancona , 1990 ) . For example , Kotter found that top manage - rial information and decision - making requirements in stable environments were " more standardized and routine " than in turbulent environments ( 1982 : 29 ) . Stable environments tend to attenuate learning requirements ( Tushman & Keck , 1990 ) , making problem solving more systematic than it is in turbulent environments ( Eisenhardt , 1989 ) . Thus , firms in stable environ - ments cannot benefit as much from increases in top managerial inputs as 1993 847 Academy of Management Journal firms in turbulent environments . Yet , because such firms are prone to the same inefficiencies associated with increases in team size as firms in more turbulent environments , the costs associated with increases in team size may outweigh the benefits , creating process losses in excess of process gains . Hence , top teams in a stable environment may be more efficiently managed with a small group at the top . Hypothesis 1 : Top management team size will be more positively associated with firm performance in a turbu - lent environment than in a stable environment . Distribution of Power Within Top Management Teams and CEO Dominance Power is defined here as the capacity of individual actors to exert their will . This definition is consistent with other scholars ' views ( Pfeffer , 1981 ) and lends itself to an analysis of relative power among top managers in organizations . Although power often carries negative connotations ( Pfeffer , 1981 ) , there is no reason to expect any particular distribution of power , whether it conveys power to one person or distributes it more equally to many , to be more advantageous than another in a general sense . However , following our earlier arguments on team size , we considered it likely that the association between top team power and firm performance would depend on the nature of the environment . Dominant CEOs tend to restrict the flow of information in " high - velocity " environments ( Eisenhardt & Bourgeois , 1988 ) . Such restriction may happen when a dominant CEO nullifies the contribution of a member with less power ( Diesing , 1962 ) or when other team members fear reporting information or ideas that run counter to those preferred by a dominant CEO ( Hambrick & D ' Aveni , 1992 ) . Alternatively , a top group may spend much of its time either supporting or rejecting the ideas of a powerful person , such as the CEO , rather than searching for alternative solutions to a problem ( Maier & Hoffman , 1961 ) . When information - processing requirements are low , as is generally true in more stable environments ( Ancona , 1990 ) , top teams with dominant CEOs may minimize process loss by restricting unnecessary com - munication and conflict . In addition , CEOs may be more likely to have sufficient information with which to make high - quality decisions in stable environments . In a review of the group size literature , Hill concluded that when tasks are relatively simple , as they would be in a stable environment , " Performance was often determined by one competent individual " ( 1982 : 529 ) . In contrast , because problems in a turbulent environment require sub - stantial information processing ( Daft et al . , 1988 ) , information restriction can lead to poor performance . When the distribution of power within a top team is balanced , the broader participation and information sharing needed to process complex decisions in turbulent environments is more likely to exist , enhancing firm performance . Hence , the impact of CEO dominance on firm performance is expected to differ in turbulent and stable environments . 848 August Haleblian and Finkelstein Hypothesis 2 : CEO dominance will be more negatively associated with firm performance in a turbulent environ - ment than in a stable environment . Environmental Discretion as a Moderator Hypotheses 1 and 2 are based on the idea that environmental turbulence moderates the association between team size and CEO dominance , and firm performance . However , environments differ in the degree of discretion they confer to top management teams ( Hambrick & Finkelstein , 1987 ) . In high - discretion environments , top teams have a high degree of control over out - comes , so it makes sense to posit team effects on performance . But when environmental discretion is low , it is not clear that team characteristics such as size and power distribution get translated into performance outcomes . This logic suggests that the expectations summarized in Hypotheses 1 and 2 may only be supported in a high - discretion environment . As a result , an alternative hypothesis that recognizes the restricted latitude of options top teams face in low - discretion contexts is possible . Namely , when an environ - ment constrains the range of choices top managers face , as low - discretion environments do , the effects of such factors as CEO dominance and team size on firm performance are likely to be attenuated . Hence , the following hy - pothesis underlines how environmental discretion serves as a complemen - tary perspective to environmental turbulence by positing significant top team effects in a high - discretion environment , but not in a low - discretion environment . Hypothesis 3 : CEO dominance and team size will be sig - nificantly associated with firm performance in an envi - ronment allowing top managers a high level of discretion in strategic decision making but will not be significantly associated with firm performance in a low - discretion en - vironment . METHODS Study Group Interested in studying two industries that varied significantly in envi - ronmental turbulence and discretion , we chose the computer industry , which is characterized by continuous product innovation , high growth rates , and high product differentiation , as the turbulent , high - discretion environ - ment , and chose the natural gas distribution industry , which is governed by regulations controlling pricing and capital acquisition , as the stable , low - discretion environment . 1 To confirm that those characterizations were cor - 1 Although we considered industries in which turbulence and discretion did not covary , it was problematic to identify such industries . Some of the factors that promote discretion , such as product differentiability and demand growth , may also be related to turbulence . Neverthe - less , all hypotheses are testable in the two industries we studied . 1993 849 Academy of Management Journal rect , we compared measures of environmental stability and environmental discretion across industries . Our two indicators of turbulence - stability were performance risk , measured as the average coefficient of variation of firms ' return on assets from 1978 to 1982 , and demand instability , measured as the average coefficient of variation of firms ' sales from 1978 to 1982 . The values of both indicators were significantly greater in the computer industry than in the natural gas industry , supporting our classification of those industries in terms of environmental turbulence . 2 To measure environmental discretion , we relied on work by Hambrick and Finkelstein ( 1987 ) . We computed the following indicators of environ - mental discretion for each industry studied : ( 1 ) the average advertising in - tensity , ( 2 ) the average R & D intensity , ( 3 ) the average annual sales growth , ( 4 ) the standard deviation of annual sales growth , and ( 5 ) the degree of regula - tion . The regulation indicator was based on the percentage of articles about either industry cited in Funk & Scott Predicasts that emphasized regulatory issues . These items corresponded to the environmental determinants of dis - cretion Hambrick and Finkelstein ( 1987 ) discussed , with advertising inten - sity and R & D intensity signifying product differentiability , sales growth rep - resenting market growth , the standard deviation of sales growth representing sales instability , and the degree of regulation capturing regulatory con - straints . We standardized these five indicators ( x = 0 ; s . d . = 1 ) and averaged them to yield an overall measure of environmental discretion ; the degree of regulation was reverse - scored ( a = . 80 ) . The computed index score was . 54 in the computer industry and - . 63 in the gas industry ( t = 9 . 07 , p < . 001 ) , supporting our classification of those industries in terms of environmental discretion . The names of 47 firms ( 26 computer and 21 natural gas distribution companies ) for which data were available for all top management team mem - bers between 1978 - 82 were drawn from Ward ' s Directory of 50 , 000 Largest U . S . Corporations . With pooling , which is discussed below , there were 235 observations ( 47 firms for five years ) . The study group was restricted to large firms because ( 1 ) a fairly homogenous set of firms was required to ensure comparability and ( 2 ) it was difficult to obtain data on CEO dominance for smaller firms . Given our focus on top teams as groups , we thought it important to study a relatively small set of managers at the top rather than a more diffuse cluster of top managers that might not really be a group . As a result , we defined a top management team as all corporate officers who were also board members ( D ' Aveni & Kesner , 1993 ) . A manager ' s sitting on a firm ' s board of di - rectors is an objective and formal indicator of membership in its dominant coalition , the group of top managers in the inner circle of an organization 2 The means for performance risk and demand instability were 93 . 04 and 23 . 98 for firms in the computer industry and 42 . 56 and 14 . 22 for firms in the natural gas industry . The corre - sponding t - statistics were 3 . 05 ( p < . 001 ) for performance risk and 2 . 47 ( p < . 01 ) for demand instability . 850 August Haleblian and Finkelstein that has ultimate responsibility for setting policy ( Cyert & March , 1963 ; Thompson , 1967 ) . In addition , such inside board membership represents an absolute cutoff point between top managers and other managers that is anal - ogous across firms and industries . The study excluded all firms with only one inside board member because power distribution measures are not meaningful in such organizations . Data were gathered from multiple sources . We collected data on top managerial characteristics from corporate proxy statements , Standard & Poor ' s Directory of Directors , and Dun & Bradstreet ' s Reference Book of Corporate Management . Data on firm characteristics were collected from COMPUSTAT , Moody ' s Manual , and Standard & Poor ' s Directory of Corpo - rations . Measures Firm performance . Three indicators of performance were used : return on assets , return on sales , and return on equity . Following the recommen - dations of Venkatraman and Ramanujam ( 1986 ) , we standardized these three indicators ( x = 0 , s . d . = 1 ) and averaged their values to create a composite measure of firm performance . Correlations among these performance mea - sures ranged from . 75 to . 89 , with the global measure yielding a Cronbach alpha of . 93 . Top management team size . We counted the number of corporate offic - ers who were also board members in each firm for each year . The average size of the top management teams so defined was 3 . 39 , with a standard deviation of 1 . 46 . CEO dominance . To assess CEO dominance for the large study group used here , we relied on ten objective measures of power that were thought to cumulatively explain overall power . Attempting to " provide a reasonably good approximation of the distribution of power " ( Pfeffer , 1981 : 59 ) , we created an overall index of power by averaging the standardized ( x = 0 , s . d . = 1 ) coefficients of variation for each of ten indicators of power over all top team members in each firm in each year . When the coefficient of variation is high , power is unevenly concentrated in a firm ' s CEO , so CEO dominance is high . 3 When the coefficient of variation is low , power is relatively evenly distributed among team members ; the distribution of power in such firms is balanced . The indicators we used were based on work by Finkelstein ( 1992 ) . A brief description of each indicator follows , but we refer readers to Finkel - stein for a fuller discussion of these measures and their validation . 4 3 Actually , a high coefficient of variation only suggests that power is unevenly distributed and concentrated in one particular team member . However , when we examined teams with the highest coefficient of variation scores ( the upper 20th percentile ) , we found that it was the CEO who scored highest in every case . 4 We did not use the ownership variables described in Finkelstein because " ownership power may not translate into active involvement in strategic decision making " ( 1992 : 530 ) . Given that our focus was on strategic decision making , it was important to include only those ( continued ) 1993 851 Academy of Management Journal Percentage with higher titles was the percentage of individuals in a top team with higher official titles than a focal executive . The CEO is rated 0 on this variable , and the least powerful members of the top team are rated highest . Hence , this item was reversed in computing the CEO dominance index . Compensation was defined as the total cash compensation an executive received divided by the compensation of the highest paid manager in the same firm ( Hambrick & D ' Aveni , 1992 ) . In the case of the top earner in a firm , we divided by the pay of the second highest paid manager to avoid restrict - ing the maximum score to 1 . 00 . Formal titles was operationally defined as the number of official titles a manager had . The values for this variable ranged from 1 to 3 , with more titles signifying greater power ( Harrison , Torres , & Kukalis , 1988 ) . Corporate boards was the number of corporate boards of which a focal top manager was a member . The number of board directorships an individ - ual holds is an important indicator of external reputation ( D ' Aveni , 1990 ) . In addition , directorships provide access to important information ( Pennings , 1980 ) and important people in the " managerial elite " ( Useem , 1979 ) , en - hancing a manager ' s prestige . Wade , O ' Reilly , and Chandratat ( 1990 ) used this measure to assess managerial reputation . Nonprofit boards was the number of boards of nonprofit corporations a focal manager sat on . Service to the community is an important aspect of a manager ' s membership in the managerial elite ( Useem , 1979 ) . Average board rating was the average stock rating from Standard & Poor ' s Stock Surveys for all firms for which a manager was an external director . The rating is a further indicator of the prestige associated with external directorships . Elite education is based on the rated prestige of the academic institu - tions a focal manager attended . The variable was coded as follows : 0 , no formal higher education ; 1 , undergraduate and graduate schools are both nonelite ; 2 , undergraduate or graduate school ( but not both ) is elite ; 3 , both undergraduate and graduate schools are elite . Expertise was based on the notion that managers who can cope with critical environmental contingencies will be powerful ( Pfeffer , 1981 ) . There were three steps involved in creating this variable . First , we determined the key environmental requirements in each industry . Adapting measures used by Hambrick ( 1981 ) , we specified four types of environmental requirements corresponding to different sources of uncertainty in the task environment : inputs , representing an emphasis on supply conditions as a source of un - certainty ; outputs , representing an emphasis on demand conditions ; throughputs , representing an emphasis on production processes ; and regu - indicators of power that are likely to affect the phenomenon of interest . Including alternative indicators of power that might not be relevant to strategic decision making might have rendered the CEO dominance measure less effective . 852 August Haleblian and Finkelstein latory concerns , representing an emphasis on regulatory conditions . We identified key environmental requirements by counting the number of arti - cles cited in Funk & Scott Predicasts that emphasized each of the four con - tingencies . Second , all functional areas that managers had direct experience in were identified . And third , we assessed managerial expertise by matching func - tional experience with environmental requirements as follows : purchasing , personnel , and exploration corresponded to inputs ; sales and marketing and product R & D corresponded to outputs ; operations , accounting , and process R & D corresponded to throughputs ; and government service and law corre - sponded to regulatory concerns ( Hambrick , 1981 ) . The actual measure was computed by summing the proportion of articles cited featuring each envi - ronmental requirement for which a manager had corresponding functional experience . For example , the distribution of cites from the Funk & Scott analysis in the computer industry was inputs , . 10 ; outputs , . 63 ; throughputs , . 18 ; and regulatory concerns , . 09 ; hence , a manager with functional experi - ence in marketing and law would score . 72 . Functional areas was a count of the number of different functional areas a manager had experience in . It is a broader measure of experience that does not limit itself to the functional areas deemed important by Funk & Scott . Positions in firm , defined as the number of different positions a manager has had in a firm , captured interactions with environmental actors . The wider a manager ' s external contacts , the greater his or her power ( Thomp - son , 1967 ) . Control Variables Although many variables may help explain firm performance , it is not possible to include them all . Our approach was to select control variables that appeared to be related to performance at multiple levels of analysis . We included control variables at the environmental level , the firm level , and the top management team level . Environment . As we discussed above , the computer industry was char - acterized by significantly more environmental turbulence and discretion than the natural gas industry . We used one industry dummy variable , coding firms in the computer industry as 1 and firms in the natural gas industry as 0 ( Dess , Ireland , & Hitt , 1990 ) . 5 Firm size . The size of a firm was included as a control variable because , given Hypothesis 1 , it was important to ensure that team size was not con - founded with firm size . To reduce " heteroscedasticity " ( Kerlinger , 1973 ) , we defined firm size as the natural logarithm of annual sales expressed in 1983 dollars . Strategic unrelatedness . The nature and type of firm diversification may be related to firm performance ( Bass , Cattin , & Wittink , 1977 ) . Strategic 5 Results using the actual turbulence and discretion scores discussed earlier were identical to those reported below using an industry dummy variable . 1993 853 Academy of Management Journal unrelatedness was measured as the percentage of industries in which a firm was operating that were different from the company ' s primary industry ; all industries were defined by two - digit Standard Industrial Classification codes . Similar measures of diversification based on product counts have been used for some time ( Montgomery , 1982 ) , and they have recently been recommended for use in research that models diversification as a control variable , as this study did ( Hoskisson , Hitt , Johnson , & Moesel , 1993 ) . Efficiency . Cost factors may be important to success in the natural gas distribution industry ; hence , we included a control for efficiency . To mea - sure this construct , we standardized ( x = 0 , s . d . = 1 ) and summed nonpro - duction overhead costs ( selling , general , and administrative expenses to sales ratio , an indicator of cost inefficiency ) and inventory levels ( invento - ries to sales ratio , an indicator of lack of asset parsimony ) , and multiplied the results by - 1 to bring the score in line with efficiency . Several previous studies have used nonproduction overhead and inventory levels to measure efficiency ( e . g . , Hambrick , 1983 ) . Borrowing capacity . Borrowing capacity , defined as equity over debt , represents the extent to which a firm has not tapped into potential sources of leverage . As such , it is a commonly used indicator of organizational slack ( Bourgeois , 1981 ) . When a firm ' s balance sheet reflects unused borrowing capacity , its debt payments tend to be lower , directly affecting performance . Given that firms in the natural gas industry in particular are highly capital - intensive , borrowing capacity may be an important determinant of firm per - formance . Tenure heterogeneity and functional heterogeneity . At the top team level , we examined two team composition variables to control for team ef - fects and to ensure that the power distribution and team size variables were not confounded with demographic heterogeneity . Tenure heterogeneity was measured as the coefficient of variation of tenure in a firm for top team members . Functional heterogeneity was measured with the formula 1 - Spi2 ( Blau , 1977 ) , where p was the weighted proportion of each func - tional background represented on a team ( weighted by the number of func - tions each manager had experience in ) and i was the number of different areas of functional experience on the team . Data Analysis The data were pooled across firms and years . Although pooling yields more precise estimates because it makes a larger sample possible , the result - ing observations are no longer independent because enduring individual firm characteristics are correlated over time . Hence , we used modified gen - eralized - least - squares ( GLS ) models to control explicitly for autocorrelation ( Hannan & Young , 1977 ) . We tested Hypotheses 1 and 2 by conducting moderated regression analysis to assess the form of the relationship between team size and CEO dominance and firm performance ( Arnold , 1982 ) . Mod - erated regression analysis is an appropriate test of these hypotheses because they are relational . We used subgroup analysis to test Hypothesis 3 because 854 August Haleblian and Finkelstein it predicts a significant effect in one industry but not the other . Subgroup analysis was the preferred analytical technique because Hypothesis 3 was nonrelational , making it necessary for us to independently test for main effects within each industry . RESULTS Table 1 presents means , standard deviations , and correlations among variables . Although we note significance levels , they should be interpreted with caution because the data have been pooled . Although there were sev - eral significant correlations among independent variables , the magnitude of those associations is not large ( r < . 50 ) , indicating multicollinearity did not present a significant problem and that all the independent variables could be included in the GLS regressions . 6 Table 2 presents regression analysis results . Because we used GLS re - gressions , the coefficients reported are not biased . Model 1 reports coeffi - cients for control variables and main effects . Of note here are the significant coefficients for team size ( p < . 05 ) and CEO dominance ( p < . 10 ) . Hypothesis 1 predicts that team size will be more positively related to performance in the computer industry than in the natural gas industry . To test this hypothesis , we added the interaction of team size and the computer industry dummy variable to the base model . As is evident from model 2 of Table 2 , this interaction term was positive and significant , supporting Hy - pothesis 1 . 7 Hypothesis 2 predicts that CEO dominance will be more negatively associated with firm performance in the computer industry than in the nat - ural gas industry . To test this hypothesis , we added the interaction of CEO dominance and the computer industry dummy to the base model . As model 3 indicates , the coefficient for this interaction term was negative and signif - icant , supporting Hypothesis 2 . Hypothesis 3 predicts that top team characteristics will be significantly associated with firm performance in the computer industry but not in the natural gas industry . We tested this idea by conducting two regression analyses , one for each industry . As the results reported in Table 3 indicate , the coefficients for team size and CEO dominance were significant in the computer industry but not in the natural gas industry , supporting Hypoth - esis 3 . 6 Although correlations among independent variables were generally small , the association between firm size and strategic unrelatedness was . 49 . To ensure multicollinearity was not a problem , we conducted the same analyses reported below dropping each of these two variables in successive regression equations . Results did not change , indicating the correlation between firm size and strategic unrelatedness did not bias results . 7 We also tested the possibility that the relationship between team size and firm perfor - mance was curvilinear , with performance increasing with size up to a point and then decreasing because of process problems . When we added a squared term for team size to the model , the coefficients were not significant , indicating that , at least in our data , firm performance was a positive function of team size . 1993 855 TABLE 1 Means , Standard Deviations , and Correlations for All Variablesa Variables Means s . d . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 .

Our finding that large teams and teams with less dominant CEOs were more profitable in a turbulent envi - ronment ( the computer industry ) than in a stable environment ( natural gas distribution ) was consistent with our conceptualization of team size and CEO dominance as important information - processing variables . The second major finding of this study was that top management team effects were not significant in the natural gas distribution industry . This industry is not only a stable one ; it also constrains the choices available to top teams operating in it . With only a restricted level of discretion available to top managers , information processing within a top team may be of less consequence to performance than historical norms , standard operating pro - cedures , and the actions of regulatory agencies ( Hambrick & Finkelstein , 1987 ) . 8 Finkelstein and Hambrick ( 1990 ) suggested that top management 8 To test the idea that performance differences in a low - discretion industry may be due to historical , firm - specific factors that change little over time , we added binary variables for 20 of 21 natural gas firms and redid the analysis reported in Table 3 . We found 6 of 20 binary ( continued ) 1993 857 Academy of Management Journal TABLE 3 GLS Regression Estimates by Industrya Natural Gas Computer Industry Distribution Industry Variables b s . e . b s . e .

Environmental turbulence and discretion appear to operate as comple - mentary constructs . Turbulence and discretion are two important environ - mental dimensions that affect the relationship between top management team attributes and firm performance . However , these constructs are also complementary because predictions based on the impact of environmental turbulence were supported only when environmental discretion was high . In contrast , top team attributes were not predictive of outcomes when tested in a low - discretion environment . Hence , these results illustrate how envi - ronmental turbulence and discretion represent complementary explanations for the association between team size and CEO dominance , and firm perfor - mance . Theoretical Implications , Limitations , and Directions for Future Research The reported results have two important theoretical implications . First , it appears the increased capabilities and resources a large team brings to the strategic decision - making process are more advantageous in turbulent envi - ronments than in stable ones . Although this finding is consistent with re - variables were significant at 5 percent or better , providing some support for this idea . Hence , it may be that firms that have done well in the past continue to do well because of inertial tendencies in the natural gas industry . For comparative purposes , we followed the same pro - cedure in the computer industry by adding a series of binary variables for firms . In this case , only one firm binary variable was significant , supporting our supposition that it is organiza - tional inertia that accounts for the significant binary variables in the natural gas industry . 858 August Haleblian and Finkelstein search on group processes in social psychology , its implications for top teams and strategic decision making is new . In addition , this result suggests that team size , usually modeled as a control variable , may be a construct of some theoretical importance in research on top management teams . The second important implication concerns the results for CEO domi - nance . Our findings are consistent with those of Eisenhardt and Bourgeois ( 1988 ) , who found that top teams with dominant CEOs , which they referred to as " centralized , " contributed to poor performance in a turbulent ( high - velocity ) environment . Given that precedent , the results of this study con - firm that top managerial power is an important construct to model in re - search on top teams and strategic decision making ( Finkelstein , 1992 ) . Several limitations of the study warrant discussion . First , our data were restricted to large firms , and our findings therefore may not be generalizable to small firms . Managerial effects may be more intense in small firms be - cause they are less constrained by organizational inertia ( Miller , Kets de Vries , & Toulouse , 1982 ) . Second , although we stated our hypotheses in associational terms , the logic behind them implies that team size and CEO dominance " cause " performance . Unfortunately , even with multiple years of data it was not possible to completely disentangle causal direction . Third , our discussion of team size and CEO dominance focused on their effects on decision quality and firm performance . However , we did not ex - plicitly consider the implementation process , which may affect outcomes , although it is complex ( Nutt , 1989 ) . Hence , our hypotheses should be con - sidered ceteris paribus . Finally , to study team size and CEO dominance more effectively requires data on a greater number of industries . Important patterns emerged in our examination of two widely disparate industries , but our study of only two industries leaves considerable opportunity for other researchers . Both top management team size and CEO dominance hold considerable promise as future research topics . The literature on group size in social psychology may help clarify issues of relevance to researchers on top man - agement teams . For example , if large top management teams offer greater capabilities but also greater coordination and communication problems than small teams , managing team interactions to minimize process losses be - comes critical . However , little research on top teams has addressed such process issues . CEO dominance also warrants further study . Although we found that CEO dominance influenced firm profitability differentially across environments , future work could focus on the strategic implications of CEO dominance . Questions of interest include the following : Do dominant CEOs seek firm growth above other objectives , such as profits ? How do dominant CEOs affect top management team staffing and succession processes ? Under what conditions could boards of directors remove dominant but underper - forming CEOs ? There are abundant research opportunities for scholars in - terested in learning more about such understudied top management team attributes as team size and CEO dominance . Hopefully , this article will help encourage such work . 1993 859 Academy of Management Journal REFERENCES Aldrich , H . E . 1979 . Organizations and environments .
