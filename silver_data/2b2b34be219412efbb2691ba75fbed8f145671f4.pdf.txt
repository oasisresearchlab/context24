Weitz , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , and approved October 9 , 2012 ( received for review June 12 , 2012 ) Here we report a micro ﬂ uidics method to enrich physically deform - able cells by mechanical manipulation through arti ﬁ cial microbar - riers . Driven by hydrodynamic forces , ﬂ exible cells or cells with high metastatic propensity change shape to pass through the micro - barriers and exit the separation device , whereas stiff cells remain trapped . We demonstrate the separation of ( i ) a mixture of two breast cancer cell types ( MDA - MB - 436 and MCF - 7 ) with distinct deformabilities and metastatic potentials , and ( ii ) a heterogeneous breast cancer cell line ( SUM149 ) , into enriched ﬂ exible and stiff sub - populations . We show that the ﬂ exible phenotype is associated with overexpression of multiple genes involved in cancer cell motility and metastasis , and greater mammosphere formation ef ﬁ ciency . Our observations support the relationship between tumor - initiating ca - pacity and cell deformability , and demonstrate that tumor - initiating cells are less differentiated in terms of cell biomechanics . cell mechanics | cytoskeleton | genomic pro ﬁ ling C ell deformability is commonly measured using magnetic twist - ing cytometry , particle tracking rheometry , optical tweezers , micropipette aspiration , atomic force microscope , and other de - rivative cell stretching or poking methods ( 1 – 4 ) . Applications of these methods to stem cells have revealed the greater deformability of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton in less differentiated cells , whereby deformability generally decreases during differentiation to mature cells ( 5 – 8 ) . Research on cancer cell deformability has also consistently revealed that increased deformability is correlated with increased metastatic potential ( 9 – 15 ) . Despite the success achieved using cell deformability measure - ments , isolation of cells with differential deformabilities remains a great challenge ( 10 , 16 ) . Microfabrication - assisted technology , using microscale arrays of round or rectangular posts , channels , or other simple patterns , has the potential to solve this problem ( 17 – 27 ) . Here , we focused on the mechanical properties of cancer cells in designing a unique cell puri ﬁ cation system for the purpose of generating subpopulations enriched in highly deformable cells . We used microfabrication technology and obtained a subpopulation of SUM149 breast cancer cells with stem - cell – like deformability and mammosphere formation capability . The separation device , a mechanical separation chip ( MS - chip ) , employs arti ﬁ cial microbarriers in combination with hydrodynamic force to separate deformable from stiff cells ( Fig . 1 A ) . Both the microbarrier structures and the ﬂ uidic parameters are essential to the cell - enrichment process . The most notable feature of the device is the precise placement of the microbarriers to impede the passage of stiff cells . Published in vivo observations suggest that the mini - mumcrossablebarrierforcancercellsis ∼ 8 μ morless ( 28 , 29 ) . Here , we took those barrier dimensions into account in designing the MS - chip to separate cells based on perfusion through constrictions . As depicted in Fig . 1 , the gaps between posts range in size from 15 to 7 μ m , following the direction of ﬂ uid ﬂ ow ; this allows continuous optimization of separation ef ﬁ ciency . The rectangular , matrix - like arrangement of the microbarriers ensures that the most ﬂ exible cells are able to seek alternate routes in the event of a blockage . The secondimportantfeature isthe placementof wide channels between post arrays ( Fig . 1 B ) . The main bene ﬁ ts of those channels are to prevent obstructionthat couldeasily occur incontinuously repeating arrays of posts and regulate and equalize hydrodynamic pressure throughoutthechip . Thus , thecellsactuallyhaveachancetoreorient themselves before continuing and adopt an alternative path before passing through another set of post arrays . Using the MS - chip , we demonstrate the separation of : ( i ) an ar - ti ﬁ cial mixture of two breast cancer cell types ( MDA - MB - 436 and MCF - 7 ) with distinct deformabilities and metastatic potentials , and ( ii ) a heterogeneous breast cancercellline ( SUM149 ) , intoenriched ﬂ exible and stiff subpopulations . We have demonstrated that the ﬂ exible phenotype is associated with overexpression of multiple genes involved in cancer cell motility and metastasis . We have also assayed the tumorigenicity of the ﬂ exible and stiff subpopulations of SUM149 cells using the mammosphere formation ef ﬁ ciency assay . Our study provides an example of application of a micro ﬂ uidics - based approach to cancer cell metastasis research . Results and Discussion Chip Design and Operation . In a typical experiment , the MS - chip was fabricated using standard polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) micro - ﬂ uidics technology ( 30 ) . Suspended cells were then applied to the MS - chip via a Tygon tube connected to the chip inlet . The ﬂ ow of cells was controlled by nitrogen pressure , normally at 5 – 10 psi ( 34 – 69 × 10 3 Pa ) , for a total ﬂ ow rate of 1 – 2 mL / h . Cells applied to the MS - chip were imaged by ﬂ uorescence microscopy . The separated subpopulations were then subjected to gene - expression analysis , ﬂ ow cytometry , or mammosphere formation assays . On - Chip Cell Separation . To demonstrate the capacity of the MS - chip to separate cells based on ﬂ exibility , we tested the separation of a mixture containing two different breast cancer cell types . We used a less ﬂ exible , nonmetastatic breast cancer cell line , MCF - 7 / GFP , which expresses GFP , and a more ﬂ exible metastatic breast cancer cell line , MDA - MB - 436 / RFP , which expresses red ﬂ uo - rescent protein ( RFP ) ; ﬂ uorescent proteins had been introduced into the cells with lentivirus . Mesenchymal - like breast cancer cell lines [ such as MDA - MB - 231 ( 9 ) and MDA - MB - 436 ] and epithe - lium - like breast cancer cell lines ( such as MCF - 7 ) were previously shown to have signi ﬁ cantly different deformabilities , quanti ﬁ ed by optical deformability assays . Typically , the mesenchymal - like cells Author contributions : N . T . U . , J . C . , and L . Q . designed research ; W . Z . , D . S . C . , H . W . , and L . Q . performed research ; W .

As a proof - of - concept study , MCF - 7 / GFP and MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells were cultured separately and then mixed in equal amounts at a ﬁ nal density of 1 × 10 6 cells / mL . These two cell types express different levels of cytoskeletal pro - teins , with MCF - 7 having the stiffer cytoskeleton ( 31 ) . We char - acterized the higher deformability of MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells compared with MCF - 7 / GFP cell using atomic force microscopy indentation and examined cytoskeletal organization after staining of cytoskeletal protein ( Figs . S1 – S4 and SI Materials and Methods ) . Cells trapped on MS - chip were imaged by ﬂ uorescence mi - croscopy ( Fig . 2 and Fig . S5 ) . The proportion of the two cell lines varied along the length of the chip . At the inlet , equal amounts of green MCF - 7 and red MDA - MB - 436 ﬂ uorescent cells were ob - served . In this region , channels were much wider than the diameter of thecells , resulting in no signi ﬁ cant separation of ﬂ exible and stiff cells . In the direction of ﬂ ow , MCF - 7 / GFP cells were consistently trapped but MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells passed through the gaps more frequently , as seen in Fig . 2 . The smallest relative numbers of MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells were in the center of the chip , where the gap sizes ranged from 11 to 9 μ m at the ﬂ ow direction . The results of statistical analysis of data derived from three independent experiments are presented in Fig . S6 . These data demonstrate the overall ef ﬁ ciency of separation of the two cell lines in the MS - chip . The ef ﬁ ciency of separation was lower in the rear part of the chip . Two factors may aid in the interpretation of this observation . First , sorting in the front and middle parts of the chip resulted in an increased proportion of MDA - MB - 436 cells , and therefore a higherproportion of MDA - MB - 436 cellsto MCF - 7 cells presented when the mixture reached the rear part of the chip . Second , after sorting in the front and middle parts of the chip , the cells that were able to reachtherear partof thechip showedsimilar deformability , regardless of cell type . Fig . 3 A shows representative images of cells input at the inlet and collected at the outlet , and Fig . 3 B shows the proportion of red to green cells after the enrichment process . The fraction of MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells in the mixture was increased from 50 % to 73 % ( mean value from three experiments ) . It should be noted that cellular heterogeneity does exist within the cell types and affects the quality of the separation ; speci ﬁ cally , a proportion of MCF - 7 / GFP cells were released from the chip , and some MDA - MB - 436 / RFP were retained . MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells had a wider size distribution , with a mean size of 282 μ m 2 , compared with MCF - 7 / GFP cells , which had a mean size of 184 μ m 2 . These two cell types showed slightly decreased size after separation , but still preserved distinct mean sizes relative to each other ( Fig . S7 ) . These data indicate that cell size has little effect in the mechanical separation of cancer cells in MS - chip . Analyses of the Enriched Cell Subpopulation . Given that the MS - chip can enrich cells with high deformability and metastatic potential from a complex cell mixture , we next explored the mechanical subtype of SUM149 cells in detail . The SUM149 cell line is known for its intrinsic heterogeneity ( 32 ) , and it is a well - established in vitro model of in ﬂ ammatory breast cancer that we have studied previously ( 33 , 34 ) . The evaluation of the heterogeneous deformability of SUM149 cells is shown in Movies S1 and S2 . These two movie clips record the cancer cells as they cross MS - chip post arrays . Fig . 4 is a mag - ni ﬁ ed ﬁ eld showing the deformed cells . The green arrow points to a stiff cell with limited deformability trapped in a gap between posts , despite the hydrodynamic force of ﬂ uid ﬂ ow . The red arrow points to a malleable cell that changes shape and is highlighted in a time sequence analysis on the right ( L - shaped in the top frame , Fig . 1 . ( A ) Scheme ( Upper ) and photograph ( Lower ) of MS - chip . ( B ) Optical microscopicimagesoftheMS - chip . ( C ) Scanningelectronmicroscopicimageof the post array taken at an angle . The post height is ∼ 13 μ m . The microscale geometry of the ﬂ ow channels and post arrays ensures that ﬂ uid ﬂ ow is lam - inar , resulting in continuous cell movement and deformation in this device . Fig . 2 .

Green , red , and merged channels are shown in the ﬁ rst three columns to demonstrate cell types trapped on the MS - chip . Higher magni ﬁ cation images of the merged image are on the right , indicating the ef ﬁ ciency of separation through gaps ranging in size from 15 to 7 μ m . 18708 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1209893109 Zhang et al . dumbbell - shaped in the second , and bowling pin - shaped in the two lower frames ) . This cell was able to pass through the post arrays because of its high degree of deformability . The cell indicated by theyellow arrowpassedhalfwaythrough thedevice , demonstrating intermediate deformability . During this experiment , cell size played a less important role , as indicated by the observation that a smaller stiff cell was trapped ( green arrow ) , but a much larger , but ﬂ exible , cell passed through ( red arrow ) . Fig . 4 B indicates the deformation and partial recovery of a cell in the MS - chip . Multiple examples of cell deformation are shown in Movie S3 . After ﬂ exible and stiff SUM149 cells were separated based on deformability ( Movie S3 ) , the cells were immediately lysed ( Movie S4 ) , RNAwasextracted , andgenome - widegene - expressionanalysis was conducted using the Affymetrix HG - U133 plus 2 . 0 GeneChip with 54 , 675 probe sets . Based on cell number and quantitation of RNA from duplicate samples in two experiments , we estimated that ∼ 10 % of applied cells successfully ﬂ owed through the MS - chip and 90 % were retained . Intotal , seven sets ofgene - expressiondata were collected and analyzed . Samples from the ﬁ rst of three independent cell - sorting experiments ( Exp . 1 ) were performed onthreetechnical replicates and those from others ( Exps . 2 and 3 ) were performed on two technical replicates . For bioinformatic analysis of gene - expression data , all seven sets of data were processed together . To further evaluate whether the enriched ﬂ exible subpopulation exhibits stem cell - like deformability , we examined expression of cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal ﬁ lament protein genes ( Fig . 5 A ) . The expression pro ﬁ le of the enriched ﬂ exible SUM149 cell sub - population shows underexpression of epithelial cytokeratins , actins , and lamins , as well as overexpression of vimentin . These properties could be indicators of greater ﬂ exibility and a less differentiated state ( 5 – 8 , 35 ) , providing support for the proposed mechanism of MS - chip separation . The pro ﬁ les of genes differentially expressed in ﬂ exible and stiff cells also demonstrate greater cell motility in the ﬂ exible cells . The 288 most highly overexpressed genes in ﬂ exible cells ( > threefold change , P < 1 × 10 − 4 , and false - discovery rate < 0 . 1 % ) were map - ped by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) ( Datasets S1 and S2 ) . The results indicate that 53 highly expressed genes are relevant to cell motility and 30 regulate the migration of tumor cells , as shown in the heat map in Fig . 5 B . The upper gene panel contains mole - culesinvolvedincytoskeletalreorganization , whichiscritical incell motility and tumor progression ; examples include Cdc42 , CD44 , c - Raf , and PIK3C2A ( 35 – 38 ) . This panel in Fig . 5 also includes ITG β 1 , TGF β R1 , SMAD4 , and EGFR , which are known to drive tumor invasion and metastasis ( 39 , 40 ) . To further explore the relationship between stem cell - like deformability and tumor - initiating features , we next analyzed expression of thetumor - initiating cell ( TIC ) markersCD44 , CD24 , and claudins , and assessed TIC function by examining colony - forming capacity in mammosphere culture .

The representative image of input cells ( cell sample before loading into the MS - chip ) shows approximately equal numbers of green and red cells ( Lower , Left ) , and the representative image of output cells ( cells that passed through the entire MS - chip and were collected at the outlet ) shows a signi ﬁ cantly enriched population of red cells ( Lower Right ) .

In agreement with this observation , ﬂ ow cytometric analysis con ﬁ rmed a signi ﬁ cant enrichment of the CD44 + / CD24 − ( or CD44 high / CD24 − ) population in the ﬂ exible cells ( Fig . 5 C and D , Figs . S8 – 10 , and SI Results ) . Here , we have used mammo - sphere formation ef ﬁ ciency under conditions of serum - free growth in suspension culture as an assay of tumorigenicity . Less than 1 % of tumor cells are able to survive under these culture conditions and the surviving cells are capable of self - renewal , differentiation , and tumor formation upon transplantation ( 41 ) . The mammosphere formation assay demonstrated that ﬂ exible cells show higher growth ef ﬁ ciency ( Fig . 5 E ) and generate larger mammospheres ( Fig . S11 ) , providing functional evidence of TIC enrichment . Under mammosphere cul - tureconditions , rarequiescentandslowlydividingcellsretainPKH26 ﬂ uorescence , but rapidly growing cells lose ﬂ uorescence by dilution with each proliferative cycle ( Fig . 5 F ) . Conclusions Overall , the enriched population of ﬂ exible SUM149 cells has a gene - expression pro ﬁ le indicative of greater cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal deformability and motility ( Figs . 4 and 5 A and B ) , aswell asmultiplecharacteristics thatde ﬁ neTICs ( Fig . 5 A , and C – E ) . Using cell separation , gene - expression analysis , and tumori - genicity assay , we have demonstrated the relationship between mechanical deformability and ef ﬁ ciency of mammosphere forma - tion in breast cancer cells , which suggests that TICs preserve the mechanical deformability of normal stem cells . Our TIC - enrich - ment approach using a unique micro ﬂ uidic cell - sorting technology will contribute to the advance of TIC research and the devel - opment of TIC - targeted therapy in a variety of cancer cell types . The MS - chip could be used to purify stem cells and TICs based on their unique mechanical characteristics and thereby identify mo - lecular signatures and genes essential fortumor initiation . MS - chip separation will be particularly useful in other types of cancer for which TIC biomarkers have not yet been discovered . Materials and Methods Materials and Reagents .

The microchip pattern was designed with AutoCAD ( Autodesk ) . TwosizesofMS - chipwereproducedto ﬁ teithera75 × 25 - mmor75 × 50 - mmglassslides . The75 × 25 - mmMS - chipdesignconsistsoffour independent working rows running in parallel between the same inlet and outletthrough200 - μ mchannels . Eachworkingrow ( ∼ 41mminlengthand5 . 3 mm in width ) consists of two types of regions : post - array regions ( n = 30 ) and wide - channel regions ( n = 30 ) . These two types of regions alternate on the chip . Each post - array region spans the entire width of the working row con - sisting of ∼ 800 posts ( 40 μ m in diameter ) that are sectioned into eight or nine setsofposts ( dependingongapsizes ) ; eachofthesesetsconsistof9 × 10arrays of posts . The gaps between posts decrease from a maximum of 15 μ m to a minimum of 7 μ m from left to right across the chip ( see the gap size distri - bution in Fig . 2 : column 1 of post arrays , 15 μ m ; column 2 , 14 μ m ; column 3 , 13 μ m ; columns 4 – 6 , 12 μ m ; columns 7 – 10 , 11 μ m ; columns 11 – 16 , 10 μ m ; col - umns 17 – 22 , 9 μ m ; columns 23 – 26 , 8 μ m ; columns 27 – 30 , 7 μ m .

The design and examples of use of early generations are shown in Fig . S12 and Movie S5 . PDMSelastomerdeviceswere fabricated using standardphotolithography and molding technology ( 30 ) . A high - resolution chrome mask with the de - sign pattern purchased from Photo Sciences was used for photolithography .

The height of the mold was designed to be slightly smaller than the average diameter of breast cancer cells ( e . g . , MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 436 , and SUM149 ) for these experiments . Changes in the mold speci ﬁ cations are easily made by photo - lithography . A lower spin - coating rate will result in increased photoresist thickness and , thus , the height of the mold . The positive structure on the silicon wafer was then used to fabricate the PDMS layer . The mold and PDMS layer were then baked at 80 °C for 2 h and the cured PDMS was cut and removed from the mold . The holes for the inlets and outlets were punched using needle sizes compatible with the size of the ﬂ uid input / output pins . The PDMS layer was then cleaned by brie ﬂ y rinsing with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water and dried with nitrogen gas . After treatment with oxygen plasma , the PDMS layer was bonded immediately to a glass slide . Finally , the bonded device was baked for 2 h at 80 °C . CellCulture andSynchronization . TheSUM149cellline ( estrogen receptor - and progesterone receptor - negative ; EGFR - and HER2 - low ) was purchased from Asterand . The cells were grown in Ham ’ s F - 12 medium supplemented with 5 % ( vol / vol ) FBS , 1 % ( wt / vol ) penicillin - streptomycin , 5 μ g / mL insulin , and 1 μ g / mL hydrocortisone in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air at 37 °C . The cell lines MCF - 7 / GFP and MDA - MB - 436 / RFP , which stably express GFP and RFP , respectively , were purchased from Cell Biolabs ; the GFP and RFP genes had been introduced using lentivirus . Fluorescent proteins are widely used to visualize cancer cells in vivo and in vitro and have minimal effect on the characteristics of the cells ( 43 , 44 ) . These cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , and 2 μ g / mL blasticidin under the same conditions as above . Cellculturesweregrowninserum - freemediumfor48htosynchronizethe cells . Nutrition supply was cut off by serum - free medium for minimizing RNA synthesis in cells during separation experiment . This process minimizes sampling errors between ﬂ exible and stiff cells for downstream microarray analyses . After synchronization , the medium was aspirated and cells were washedtwicewithPBSandtreatedwithtrypsinfor ∼ 5min . Immediatelybefore the on - chip experiment , cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min , counted , and resuspended in serum - free DMEM at a concentration of 10 6 cells / mL . The mixture of MCF - 7 / GFP and MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells contained 5 × 10 5 cells / mL of each cell type . Cell Sorting on MS - Chip . MS - chip pretreatment . The channels in the MS - chip were ﬁ rst wetted with PBS and then treated with a 10 % ( vol / vol ) BME so - lution in PBS for 1 h . BME represents a more physiological microenvironment thanthenativePDMSsurface . Thechannelswerethenwashedwith0 . 5 % BSA in PBS for 1 h and loaded with 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS . BSA blocks the surface and further prevents the nonspeci ﬁ c adhesion ofcells toPDMS . The chipwas kept on ice during pretreatment . Cell - sorting process . The mixture of MCF - 7 / GFP and MDA - MB - 436 / RFP cells was separated on a 75 × 25 - mm MS - chip . Cell suspension ( 0 . 25 mL ) was loaded into plastic Tygon tubing ( inner diameter 0 . 02 in ) with a 1 - mL syringe and the tubing was connected to the MS - chip by a ﬂ at steel pin ( outer diameter of 0 . 025 in ) . During the ﬂ ow experiment , compressed nitrogen gas was applied to the cell suspension at a pressure of ∼ 5 psi . In this discussion on this experiment , “ input cells ” and “ output cells ” refer to the samples that were loaded into the MS - chip and that were collected at outlets . A typical sepa - ration lasted ∼ 15 min , and the average ﬂ ow rate was controlled at ∼ 1 mL / h . The ﬂ uorescence images of cell mixtures before and after sorting were taken with an Olympus IX81 inverted ﬂ uorescence microscope ( Fig . 3 A ) . Paraformalin solution [ 4 % ( wt / vol ) ] was injected into the MS - chip with a 3 psi pressure . The whole chip was then scanned on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with an image stitching function . The stitching function allowed the generation of large images covering the entire device , permitting con - tinuous cell counts based on ﬂ uorescence signal . The sorting of SUM149 cells was performed on a 75 × 50 - mm MS - chip ( Movie S3 ) . The chip size was enlarged from 75 × 25 to 75 × 50 mm to in - crease throughput and generate a suf ﬁ cient amount of cells for downstream analyses , including microarray , FACS , and mammosphere formation assay . The larger chip can process approximately a half million cells , at least twice as many as the 75 × 25 - mm chip . The ﬂ ow at the inlet is split evenly so that the ﬂ ow pressure is uniformly distributed . The design change did not appear to affect cell separation ef ﬁ ciency . The 75 × 50 - mm chip requires more space in both inlet and outlet area to distribute ﬂ ow pressure . To ﬁ t the device into the 75 - mm length , three sets of post arrays were killed for a 3 - mm space . The rear arrays were removed because their separation ef ﬁ ciency is negligible comparing to front ones , as shown in the proof of concept ex - periment ( Fig . S5 ) . Because the ﬂ ow pressure was carefully distributed to all functional areas of the chip , the separation ef ﬁ ciency was consistent . The cell suspension ( 0 . 5 mL ) was applied to the chip as described above . A mean ﬂ owratewascontrolledat2mL / hbyadjustingappliednitrogenpressure . The duration of the separation was roughly 15 min . The ﬂ exible cells were collectedfromtheoutletandthestiffcellsremainedinsidetheMS - chip . Thestiff cellswerecollectedformammosphereculturebyback - ﬂ ushingcellstotheinlet . Cell lysis . Flexible and stiff cells were lysed for mRNA analysis immediately after separation . Flexible cells were immediately centrifuged and lysed with RNeasy lysis buffer ( Qiagen ) . Stiff cells inside the device were lysed by per - fusing lysis buffer through the chip ( Movie S4 ) . The time difference between lysis of the two sets of cells was less than 5 min . Serum - free culture medium was used to deplete the nutrient supply and minimize RNA synthesis . This strategy minimizes error because of differences in sampling the two pop - ulations of cells . Empirical evidence indicates that 12 – 13 μ g RNA can be extracted from 1 millionbreastcancercellsusingtheQiagenRNeasyMicroKit . Inthisstudy , 5 μ g RNA were obtained from the lysate of stiff cells and 0 . 5 μ g RNA from ﬂ exible cells . Thus , we estimated that 380 , 000 – 410 , 000 stiff cells and 38 , 000 – 41 , 000 ﬂ exible cells had been lysed . Image Acquisition and Analysis . Whole - slide images ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S5 ) were scanned and stitched using a Nikon A1 laser confocal microscope equipped with NIS - Elements microscope imaging software . The ﬂ uorescence images were taken with an Olympus IX81 inverted ﬂ uorescence microscope . Analytical Flow Cytometry . Cells were suspended in cold HBSS containing 2 % FBS ( HBSS + ) at 50 , 000 cells / mL for antibody staining . Antibodies CD44 - APC and CD24 - PeCy7 ( both from BD Bioscience ) were diluted 1 : 20 and 1 : 100 , respectively . After staining on ice , the cells were washed twice with cold HBSS + and kept in HBSS + on ice until FACS analysis . Isotype control anti - bodies were used as the gating control . Mammosphere Formation Assay . After the separation experiments , cells were maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium containing 2 % FBS ( MEGM + ; Lonza ) on ice . Flexible and stiff cells showed similar viability in four groups of independent experiments , with respective values of 89 % , 89 % , 84 % , and 75 % , and 84 % , 85 % , 83 % , and 78 % . For each group of experiments , six pairs of mammosphere cultures were characterized based on number and size , and the means and SDs were calculated . Forthemammosphereassay , cellswereseededat2 , 000viablecellsperwell in 24 - well plates ( six wells per group ) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmo - sphere of 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air . After 2 wk , the mammospheres were counted using GelCount ( Oxford Optronix ) . Mammoshpere size was evaluated by optical images . Gene Expression Array and Analysis . Total RNA was extracted from lysates of the ﬂ exible and stiff SUM149 subpopulations ( 0 . 5 μ g and 5 μ g , respectively ) using the Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit . cDNA was prepared from 50 ng total RNA with the Nugen WT - Ovation Pico RNA ampli ﬁ cation system , generating 250 - fold amounts of cDNA . The OD 260 / OD 280 ratios were ∼ 2 , indicating a pure preparation of DNA . Five micrograms of cDNA from each sample were labeled with biotin using the Nugen FL - Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 . The labeled , single - stranded cDNA probes were hybridized to Affymetrix HG - U133 plus 2 . 0 Genechips .

Data from ﬂ exible and stiff cells were compared using two - class unpaired analysis . The restrictions on the proportion of false discoveries were 0 . 01 for a maximum proportion of false discovery and 90 % for a con ﬁ dence level . Withaprobability of90 % , thetotalsetofdifferentially expressed genes containsnomorethan1 % falsediscoveries . Coreanalysiswasusedtointerpret thegene expression datainthecontextofbiologicalpathways , functions , and networks using IPA ( Ingenuity Systems , www . ingenuity . com ) . The stricter cri - teria of > threefold change , 0 . 001 maximum allowed proportion of false - pos - itive genes , and 90 % con ﬁ dence level of false - discovery rate assessment were applied to reduce the number of up - regulated genes for analysis ; 688 genes satis ﬁ ed the criteria and were submitted to the IPA software . Of these , 288 genes were mapped by IPA pathways , functions , and networks analysis ( Dataset S1 ) . Signi ﬁ cance of the biofunctions and the canonical pathways was assessed by P values obtained using the Fisher Exact test . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Ms . Stephanie Mena and Mr .
