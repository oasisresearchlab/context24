Copyright 2007 Psychonomic Society , Inc . 890 One remarkable aspect of human intelligence is the abil - ity to reason flexibly based on context . For example , if told that ducks have a novel gene , one might be willing to infer that a taxonomically related animal such as vultures would also have the gene , but an ecologically related animal , such as beavers , would not . However , if told that ducks have a novel disease one might be more willing to infer that bea - vers and other ecologically related animals might also be susceptible . Underlying these qualitatively different pat - terns of inference are two different kinds of knowledge about the domain of animals : knowledge about taxonomic relations relevant to the distribution of genes , and knowl - edge about ecological relations relevant to the distribution of diseases . Context - sensitive property induction depends on the ability to call upon different kinds of knowledge to support reasoning about different kinds of properties . Psychologists have empirically verified that reasoning in category - based induction tasks flexibly draws upon differ - ent kinds of knowledge in different inductive contexts ( e . g . , Coley , Vitkin , Seaton , & Yopchick , 2005 ; Heit & Rubin - stein , 1994 ; Ross & Murphy , 1999 ; Shafto & Coley , 2003 ; Shafto , Kemp , Baraff , Coley , & Tenenbaum , 2005 ) . For ex - ample , Heit and Rubinstein ( 1994 ) showed that reasoning about novel anatomic properties is predicted by taxonomic similarity alone , but reasoning about novel behavioral prop - erties is predicted by both taxonomic and behavioral simi - larity . Similarly , in the domain of foods , Ross and Murphy ( 1999 ) showed that reasoning about novel nutrients is pre - dicted by taxonomic relations among foods whereas reason - ing about novel social uses is predicted by script relations . These results show that across domains , context - sensitive reasoning is guided by many different kinds of knowledge . However , not all knowledge in a domain is equally ac - cessible . For example , Ross and Murphy ( 1999 ) showed that taxonomic categories ( e . g . , meat ) are more accessible than script categories ( e . g . , dinner foods ) for foods ( e . g . , steak ) . In one experiment , priming a food’s taxonomic cat - egory had no effect on the speed or accuracy of category verification relative to neutral priming , whereas priming a food’s script category increased both speed and accuracy of verification . More recently , Vitkin and Coley ( 2005 ) have shown that unprimed judgments of taxonomic cat - egory membership are faster and more accurate than simi - lar judgments of script category membership . These results suggest that though many kinds of domain knowledge may coexist , they may vary in accessibility , and some kinds of knowledge—in particular , taxonomic knowledge—may have a privileged status ( see also Barsalou , 1982 ) . We have argued that context - sensitive reasoning de - pends on the ability to call upon different kinds of knowl - edge , and that different kinds of knowledge vary in their relative accessibility . If so , then manipulating accessibility of knowledge should influence context - sensitive reason - ing . We examine this question by investigating the effects of time pressure on context - sensitive reasoning in the do - main of biology . Biology provides an interesting domain in which to investigate this question for several reasons . First , there is evidence of context - sensitive reasoning in Effects of time pressure on context - sensitive property induction P ATRICK S HAFTO Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts AND J OHN D . C OLEY AND D AVID B ALDWIN Northeastern University , Boston , Massachusetts Past research suggests that category - based induction flexibly draws on different kinds of knowledge in differ - ent contexts , and that different kinds of knowledge may differ in accessibility . The present study investigates the degree to which knowledge accessibility mediates context - sensitive induction by examining the effects of time pressure on inferences about novel properties of animal species . Participants were told about a novel gene or a novel disease that was true of one category of animals , then rated the likelihood that taxonomically , ecologically , and unrelated animals had the same property , under speeded or delayed conditions . Property effects were ob - served for taxonomically related species independent of time pressure , but were only observed for ecologically related species in the delayed condition . These results suggest that time pressure selectively restricts access to ecological knowledge , and that knowledge access is critical for context - sensitive inductive reasoning .

Design We manipulated three independent variables in the property in - duction task . Participants were randomly assigned to reason about novel genes or diseases , and to do so under speeded or delayed tim - ing conditions . As described above , premise - conclusion pairs were related via taxonomy , ecology , or unrelated . Thus , the experimental design was a 2 ( property : gene vs . disease ) (cid:19) 2 ( timing : speeded vs . delayed ) (cid:19) 3 ( item type : taxonomic vs . ecological vs . unrelated ) ; property and timing were manipulated between subjects , and item type was manipulated within subjects . Procedure The experiment consisted of two parts : a property induction task followed by a belief - assessment task . Both parts of the experiment were conducted on a computer using PsyScope ( Cohen , MacWhin - ney , Flatt , & Provost , 1993 ) . In the induction task , participants were shown all 57 items in random order , given information about one member of the pair , and asked about the second member . In the gene conditions , participants were asked , e . g . , “Tigers have a gene . How likely is it that parrots have the same gene as tigers ? ” In the disease conditions , the word “disease” was substituted for “gene . ” Partici - pants responded using a 1 – 7 scale , where 1 indicated “very unlikely” and 7 indicated “very likely . ” Participants in the delayed condition were instructed to “Please take your time and think carefully about each item before typing your response . When the text turns white , you may enter your re - sponse . ” The question text initially appeared in red . After 15 sec , the text turned white . Participants were unable to enter their response until after the 15 - sec period had passed . Participants in the speeded condition were instructed , “When the text turns white , you may enter your response . Please try to respond as quickly as possibly after the text turns white , without sacrificing accuracy . ” The question text initially appeared in red , but turned white after only one second . The duration of the speeded condition was arrived at by considering an estimate of the minimal length of time it would take to read the ques - tion , fixations of about 250 msec / word ( Rayner , 1998 ) , plus time to saccade , minus considerations for words that are repeated across trials . The delayed condition duration was then set to be long enough to allow reading the question and require participants to have a no - ticeable lag before responding . The difference in duration cannot guarantee that participants think about the questions more deeply in the delayed condition , of course , but it sets conditions that encour - age or discourage detailed consideration of the problem . In the belief - assessment task , participants were shown each item again in random order and asked “Do these animals live in the same habitat ? ” and “Do these animals belong to the same biological cat - egory ? ” They answered “yes , ” “no , ” or “don’t know , ” but were in - structed to use the final option sparingly . Participants responded “don’t know” to a mean of 5 . 5 items for the ecological question ( 9 . 7 % ) and 2 . 4 items for the taxonomic question ( 4 . 2 % ) . RESULTS Each participant was assigned three scores , reflecting average likelihood ratings for taxonomic , ecological , and unrelated items . These were submitted to a 2 ( timing : de - layed vs . speeded ) (cid:19) 3 ( item type : taxonomic vs . ecologi - cal vs . unrelated ) (cid:19) 2 ( property : disease vs . gene ) mixed ANOVA . Overall , taxonomic inferences ( M (cid:21) 4 . 61 ) were rated more likely than ecological inferences ( M (cid:21) 3 . 25 ) , which in turn were rated as more likely than unrelated in - ferences [ M (cid:0)(cid:21) 2 . 46 , F ( 2 , 120 ) (cid:21) 197 . 24 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 385 , p (cid:12) . 0001 , p rep (cid:14) 0 . 99 , (cid:104) p 2 (cid:21) 0 . 77 ] . 1 We also observed property effects for both taxonomic and ecological inferences , but biology among novice adults and children ; reasoning about novel physiological properties like genes is guided by taxonomic knowledge exclusively whereas reasoning about novel diseases is also guided by causal / ecological knowledge ( e . g . Coley et al . , 2005 ; Shafto et al . , 2005 ) . Second , there is also evidence that although novice adults can demonstrate context - sensitive reasoning in some cases , reasoning based on taxonomic knowledge appears to be a robust default strategy , and taxonomic inferences are far more likely than causal / ecological inferences ( Coley , Shafto , Stepanova , & Baraff , 2005 ; López , Atran , Coley , Medin , & Smith , 1997 ; Osherson , Smith , Wilke , Lopez , & Shafir , 1990 ; Shafto & Coley , 2003 ) . To examine the effects of knowledge accessibility on inductive reasoning , we employed a novel speeded / delayed inductive reasoning task . As in a standard category - based induction task , we taught a novel property about a premise category and queried participants about the likelihood that it would also be true of a conclusion category . We varied the property ( gene versus disease ) and the relations be - tween premise and conclusion ( taxonomic , ecological , or unrelated ) . Our innovation was to vary time pressure by manipulating how long participants had to make their in - ference . Participants were either speeded ( urged to respond one second after an item appeared ) or delayed ( forced to wait 15 sec before responding ) . Based on past research , we expected inferences to taxonomically related conclu - sions ( hereafter , taxonomic inferences ) to be rated more likely for novel genes than for novel diseases . Conversely , we expected inferences to ecologically related conclu - sions ( hereafter , ecological inferences ) to be rated more likely for novel diseases than for novel genes . We made two sets of related predictions about the effects of time pressure . First , time pressure should disproportionately affect inferences based on less accessible knowledge . If so , we expect ecological inferences to be rated less likely in the speeded conditions than in the delayed conditions , whereas taxonomic inferences and inferences to unrelated conclusions should be unaffected . Second , time pressure should disproportionately affect the context - sensitive use of less accessible knowledge to guide inferences . If so , we expect equivalent property effects on taxonomic inferences in both timing conditions , but more pronounced property effects on ecological inferences in the delayed condition . METHOD Participants Sixty - four university undergraduates participated in exchange for course credit . Sixteen participants were randomly assigned to each of four conditions : speeded gene , delayed gene , speeded disease , delayed disease . Materials Materials consisted of 57 pairs of labeled photos of animals . Seventeen pairs were related taxonomically ( same superordinate category , different habitat , e . g . , tiger / camel ) , 15 were related eco - logically ( different superordinate category , same habitat , e . g . , tiger / parrot ) and 25 were unrelated . Pictures were realistic photos of ani - mals ( with backgrounds removed ) found on the Internet , and labeled with common folk - generic names . We used pictures combined with labels to maximize the likelihood that our biologically novice popu - 892 S HAFTO , C OLEY , AND B ALDWIN latedness was unrelated to likelihood ratings [ R 2 (cid:21) 0 . 908 F ( 2 , 56 ) (cid:21) 268 . 06 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 13 , p (cid:12) . 0001 , p rep (cid:14) . 99 ] . As seen in Figure 2 , however , results were very different in the delayed disease condition ; not only did both taxonomic and ecological relatedness make independent contributions to not unrelated inferences [ F ( 2 , 120 ) (cid:21) 17 . 79 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 385 , p (cid:12) . 0001 , p rep (cid:14) 0 . 99 , (cid:104) p 2 (cid:21) 0 . 22 ] . 2 As anticipated , taxo - nomic inferences were rated more likely for gene ( M (cid:21) 4 . 95 ) than for disease [ M (cid:21) 4 . 27 , t ( 62 ) (cid:21) 3 . 53 , p (cid:21) . 0008 , p rep (cid:21) . 99 , d (cid:21) 0 . 44 ] , whereas ecological inferences were rated more likely for disease ( M (cid:21) 3 . 56 ) than for gene [ M (cid:21) 2 . 93 t ( 62 ) (cid:21) 2 . 96 , p (cid:21) . 0043 , p rep (cid:21) . 97 , d (cid:21) 0 . 38 ] . To test specific predictions about the effects of time pres - sure on context - sensitive reasoning we conducted 2 ( prop - erty ) (cid:19) 2 ( timing ) ANOVAs on mean likelihood ratings separately for taxonomic , ecological , and unrelated items . Results are presented in Figure 1 . For taxonomically related items , as predicted , we observed no effect of time pressure ; the finding reported above , that taxonomic inferences were stronger in the gene condition than the disease condition , held for both speeded and delayed conditions [ F ( 1 , 60 ) (cid:21) 12 . 45 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 591 , p (cid:12) . 001 , p rep (cid:21) . 99 , (cid:104) p 2 (cid:21) 0 . 17 ] . 3 In contrast , for ecologically related items , as predicted , inferences were rated more likely in the delayed condi - tion ( M (cid:21) 3 . 49 ) than in the speeded condition ( M (cid:21) 3 . 00 [ F ( 1 , 60 ) (cid:21) 6 . 27 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 617 , p (cid:21) . 015 , p rep (cid:21) . 4 , (cid:104) p 2 (cid:21) 0 . 09 ] . 4 Moreover , as predicted , property effects depended on timing . As seen in Figure 1 , participants in the de - layed conditions rated inferences to ecological matches as more likely for disease ( M (cid:21) 4 . 05 ) than gene ( M (cid:21) 2 . 93 ) , whereas participants in the speeded conditions showed no difference [ M disease (cid:21) 3 . 07 , M gene (cid:21) 2 . 92 , F ( 1 , 60 ) (cid:21) 6 . 17 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 617 , p (cid:21) . 016 , p rep (cid:21) . 94 , (cid:104) p 2 (cid:21) 0 . 09 ] . 5 For the unrelated items , as depicted in Figure 1 , neither time pressure nor property influenced likelihood ratings , thereby demonstrating that delaying responses had a spe - cific effect on the accessibility of ecological knowledge when relevant , rather than a general effect of increasing likelihood ratings across the board . We also examined the degree to which beliefs about taxo - nomic and ecological relatedness of the stimulus pairs im - pacted inductive strength judgments . To do so , we excluded “don’t know” responses and computed the proportion of positive responses to the questions about the taxonomic and ecological relatedness of each species pair . We also calcu - lated the mean inductive strength score for each item , sepa - rately for each of the four groups of participants . We then conducted four multiple regression analyses by item , using beliefs about taxonomic and ecological relatedness to pre - dict inductive strength in each of the four conditions . Stan - dardized regression coefficients are presented in Figure 2 . All four regressions were highly significant . In both the speeded gene condition [ R 2 (cid:21) 0 . 899 , F ( 2 , 56 ) (cid:21) 241 . 35 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 20 , p (cid:12) . 0001 , p rep (cid:14) . 99 ] and the speeded disease condition [ R 2 (cid:21) 0 . 882 , F ( 2 , 56 ) (cid:21) 202 . 26 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 15 , p (cid:12) . 0001 , p rep (cid:14) . 99 ] , inferences were based almost entirely on taxonomic knowledge ( see Figure 2 ) . In both speeded con - ditions , taxonomic relatedness showed a very strong predic - tive relation to inductive strength , and ecological relatedness made a much smaller , but nevertheless significant , contri - bution . In contrast , participants in the delayed conditions showed a clear pattern of differential recruitment of taxo - nomic and ecological knowledge based on property . In the delayed gene condition , taxonomic relatedness was highly predictive of inductive projections , whereas ecological re - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Speeded Delayed Taxonomic Items M e a n L i k e li h oo d R a t i n g 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Speeded Delayed M e a n L i k e li h oo d R a t i n g 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Speeded Delayed M e a n L i k e li h oo d R a t i n g Ecological Items Unrelated Items Timing Condition Gene Disease Gene Disease Gene Disease Figure 1 .

T IME P RESSURE AND P ROPERTY I NDUCTION 893 than in the speeded condition . Forcing participants to take more time to make decisions seems to have increased ac - cess to ecological knowledge allowing differential recruit - ment of knowledge as a function of the property being projected . Specifically , in the speeded condition , the rela - tive contributions of taxonomic and ecological beliefs were the same for inferences about genes and disease . In contrast , in the delayed condition , inferences about genes were exclusively predicted by taxonomic beliefs whereas inferences about disease were equally informed by beliefs about taxonomic and ecological relatedness . We have proposed that time pressure influenced reason - ing by selectively affecting access to ecological knowl - edge . However , a possible alternative interpretation is that arguments that are relatively weak to begin with are simply weakened further when evaluated under time pressure . Spe - cifically , taking the delayed condition as a baseline , is the decrease in ecological - disease ratings in the speeded con - dition attributable to the relatively weak baseline ratings , rather than to decreased access to ecological knowledge ? 6 Our evidence suggests this is unlikely for two reasons . First , we observed no effects of time pressure on unrelated or taxonomic inferences , suggesting that only ecological inferences were rendered less likely in the speeded condi - tion . Second , taxonomic and ecological inferences about disease received comparable likelihood ratings in the delayed condition ( M (cid:21) 4 . 22 and 4 . 05 , respectively ) . If time pressure further weakens arguments that are weak to begin with , then both taxonomic and ecological inferences about disease should be weaker in the speeded condition . However , only the ecological ratings decreased under time pressure , consistent with our argument that time pressure selectively affects access to knowledge . Taken together , these results support the idea that knowledge accessibility is critical for inductive inference in general and for context - sensitive induction in particular and provide specific evidence that for these participants taxonomic knowledge was highly accessible whereas ecological knowledge , albeit present , was less accessible ( Shafto , Coley , & Vitkin , 2006 ) . Furthermore , this work has provided a general method for investigating the rela - tionship between knowledge and reasoning . By combin - ing reasoning under time pressure with assessments of knowledge , we have shown how reasoning changes over time , and attributed those changes to differential access to knowledge . This combination provides a potentially use - ful tool for investigating how knowledge affects reasoning across experience , domains , and tasks . These results are consistent with previous findings showing effects of knowledge accessibility on category use , and showing an advantage for taxonomic over other kinds of knowledge ( e . g . , Barsalou , 1982 ; Ross & Murphy , 1999 ; Vitkin & Coley , 2005 ) . Specifically , inferences to taxonomically related species were rated more likely than inferences to ecologically related or unrelated species , and beliefs about the degree of taxonomic relatedness between premise and conclusion species were strongly predictive of reasoning in all conditions . These results underscore the salience and accessibility of taxonomic knowledge . We have also replicated previous studies showing that induc - explaining inductive strength ratings , but these contribu - tions were of equivalent magnitude [ R 2 (cid:21) 0 . 703 , F ( 2 , 56 ) (cid:21) 63 . 83 , MS e (cid:21) 0 . 28 , p (cid:12) . 0001 , p rep (cid:14) . 99 ] . DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate the importance of knowledge ac - cessibility for category - based property induction . For taxo - nomically based arguments , time pressure had no effect on rated argument strength , and we observed robust property effects suggesting an impact of the context of the inference . For ecologically based arguments , time pressure had a dra - matic effect such that these arguments showed no property effects when responses were made under time pressure , but showed clear property effects when responses were delayed . Importantly , there were no effects of time pressure or prop - erty on unrelated items . These results were corroborated by regression analyses that showed when under time pressure , inferences about both genes and disease were overwhelm - ingly influenced by taxonomic knowledge , whereas under conditions in which participants were given time to con - sider the arguments , inferences about disease were equally informed by taxonomic and ecological knowledge . These results are the first to our knowledge to address the time course of category - based induction . They show that relatively accessible taxonomic knowledge was used to guide inferences in a context - sensitive manner inde - pendent of time pressure , whereas context - sensitive use of less accessible ecological knowledge required additional time . Moreover , our results provide evidence that time pressure affects reasoning by restricting access to eco - logical knowledge ; participants’ beliefs about ecological relatedness predicted strength ratings much more strongly when reasoning about diseases in the delayed condition 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 Speeded Gene Speeded Disease Delayed Gene Delayed Disease TaxonomicBeliefs EcologicalBeliefs S t a n d a r d i z e d R e g r e ss i o n C o e ff i c i e n t Condition / Property * * * * * * * * * * * * * Figure 2 .

( Manuscript received September 4 , 2006 ; revision accepted for publication November 7 , 2006 . ) tive inferences are sensitive to the property being projected ( e . g . , Heit & Rubinstein , 1994 ; Ross & Murphy , 1999 ) ; inferences to taxonomically related species were higher for gene than for disease , whereas the reverse was true for inferences to ecologically related species . However , our results also qualify previous demonstrations on inductive selectivity by showing how such selectivity is contingent on both possession of and access to relevant knowledge . The present results raise questions about the effects of experience on accessibility of different kinds of knowl - edge . Several studies document increased use of ecologi - cal reasoning among biologically experienced populations relative to biologically naive undergraduates ( e . g . , Lopez et al . , 1997 ; Proffitt et al . , 2000 ; Shafto & Coley , 2003 ) . We have shown that ecological knowledge is less acces - sible than taxonomic knowledge among a biologically in - experienced population . It remains to be seen whether folk biological experience increases the accessibility of eco - logical knowledge ; if so , we would expect effects of time pressure to disappear for experts . Alternatively , perhaps taxonomic knowledge remains relatively more accessible regardless of experience , and previous work with experts is equivalent to our delayed condition . The present results also have implications for models of category - based reasoning and semantic knowledge . Specifically , models must take into account the impact of independent and dissociable kinds of knowledge on induc - tive inference , and moreover , differences in relative acces - sibility of that knowledge . Approaches based on structured theories may provide a framework in which to explain these effects ( Shafto , Kemp , Baraff , et al . , 2005 ; Shafto , Kemp , Bonawitz , et al . , 2005 ; Shafto et al . , 2006 ; Tenenbaum , Kemp , & Shafto , in press ) . These models posit separable knowledge structures that explain reasoning in different contexts , but because they are computational - level models do not address processing issues such as the time course of accessing knowledge . In conclusion , we have begun to explore the time course of category - based induction . We have shown that time pressure influences the context - sensitive use of ecological knowledge in induction , whereas the context - sensitive use of taxonomic knowledge was impervious to time pressure . We have ar - gued that these results demonstrate the impact of differential accessibility of ecological and taxonomic knowledge about animals on inductive inferences . This work contributes both a set of theoretical and empirical constraints on viable ac - counts on human inductive reasoning , and a novel method - ology to further explore those constraints .
