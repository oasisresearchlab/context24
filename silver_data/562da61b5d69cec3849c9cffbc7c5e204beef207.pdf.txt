The online version of this article contains supplemental material . Introduction When the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is mechanically injured , Ca 2 + infl ux triggers a rapid repair process that involves exocytosis ( Reddy et al . , 2001 ; McNeil , 2002 ; McNeil et al . , 2003 ) . Although the precise repair mechanism is still unknown , current hypotheses propose that resealing is directly mediated by the delivery of intracellular membrane to the cell surface . These mod - els suggest that Ca 2 + - dependent exocytosis acts by providing a membrane patch ( McNeil et al . , 2000 ) or by relieving plasma membrane tension , which facilitates resealing ( Togo et al . , 2000 ) . However , such models cannot explain the process by which cells repair the stable protein - lined transmembrane lesions caused by pore - forming proteins ( Campbell and Morgan , 1985 ; Browne et al . , 1999 ; Walev et al . , 2001 ; Keefe et al . , 2005 ) . Experiments using the complement membrane attack com - plex ( Morgan and Campbell , 1985 ) or the bacterial toxin strepto - lysin O ( SLO ; Walev et al . , 2001 ) found that membrane resealing after pore formation is also Ca 2 + dependent . Despite this common requirement , until now , the repair of transmembrane pores was largely viewed as a process distinct from the resealing of mechani - cal wounds and was assumed to involve considerably longer periods of time . In this study , we show that SLO - permeabilized cells reseal with the same fast kinetics previously reported for the repair of mechanical wounds ( Steinhardt et al . , 1994 ; Reddy et al . , 2001 ) and demonstrate that both processes involve a rapid form of Ca 2 + - dependent endocytosis . Results and discussion Our initial observations showed that SLO - permeabilized cells reseal signifi cantly faster than previously reported ( Walev et al . , 2001 ) . In the presence of Ca 2 + , normal rat kidney ( NRK ) cells ex - posed to SLO excluded the membrane - impermeant dye propidium iodide ( PI ) after 4 min ( Fig . 1 A ) . Cells permeabilized without Ca 2 + only resealed after Ca 2 + addition ( Fig . S1 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200708010 / DC1 ) , and pores formed at high SLO concentrations were less effi ciently repaired ( Fig . 1 A ) . Resealing was similar in NRK ( rat ) , HEK - 293 , and HeLa ( human ) cells and was inhibited after ATP depletion ( Fig . 1 B ) . To determine the precise kinetics of SLO pore repair , time - lapse video microscopy was performed in cells loaded with the Ca 2 + - sensitive dye Fluo - 3 . Upon SLO permeabilization , cells showed transient increases in intracellular fl uorescence , refl ecting an influx of Ca 2 + followed by resealing ( Video 1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200708010 / DC1 ) . Under normal conditions , [ Ca 2 + ] i returned to baseline in (cid:2) 30 s , whereas it remained elevated in cells pretreated with ATP - depleting agents ( Fig . 1 C ) . The fast kinetics of SLO pore repair was confi rmed by imaging cells stained with the lipophilic dye C a 2 + inﬂ ux through plasma membrane lesions triggers a rapid repair process that was previously shown to require the exocytosis of lysosomal organelles ( Reddy , A . , E . Caler , and N . Andrews . 2001 . Cell . 106 : 157 – 169 ) . However , how exocytosis leads to membrane resealing has remained obscure , particularly for stable lesions caused by pore - forming proteins . In this study , we show that Ca 2 + - dependent resealing after permeabilization with the bacte - rial toxin streptolysin O ( SLO ) requires endocytosis via a novel pathway that removes SLO - containing pores from the plasma membrane . We also ﬁ nd that endocytosis is similarly required to repair lesions formed in mechanically wounded cells . Inhibition of lesion endocytosis ( by sterol depletion ) in - hibits repair , whereas enhancement of endocytosis through disruption of the actin cytoskeleton facilitates resealing . Thus , endocytosis promotes wound resealing by removing lesions from the plasma membrane . These ﬁ ndings provide an im - portant new insight into how cells protect themselves not only from mechanical injury but also from microbial toxins and pore - forming proteins produced by the immune system .

SLO pores trigger rapid endocytosis in the presence of Ca 2 + . ( A – C ) Live confocal imaging showing rapid endocytosis in HeLa cells expressing YFP - GPI ( green ) on the plasma membrane . ( A ) After exposure to 250 ng / ml SLO and PI ( red ) , the two cells analyzed initiated endocytosis 5 – 15 s after 909 PLASMA MEMBRANE RESEALING BY ENDOCYTOSIS • IDONE ET AL . FM1 - 43 infl ux was blocked in < 30 s , confi rming that SLO - per - meabilized cells reseal within this period ( Fig . 1 D and Video 2 ) . Thus , transmembrane pores can be repaired with the same rapid kinetics previously observed for the resealing of mechanical wounds ( Steinhardt et al . , 1994 ; Reddy et al . , 2001 ) . SLO pore formation is strictly dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol . The process is initiated by the bind - ing of toxin monomers to the plasma membrane followed by oligomerization and a conformational change that drives mem - brane insertion , resulting in a pore of (cid:2) 30 nm in diameter ( Tweten , 2005 ) . Resealing requires removal or disassembly of the transmembrane pores . Disassembly is unlikely to be responsible for restoring plasma membrane integrity because pore resealing is rapid and strongly dependent on target cell ATP . Studies of cells permeabilized by complement suggested that pore removal might occur by two possible mechanisms : ( 1 ) release in the form of plasma membrane blebs ( Morgan , 1989 ) and / or ( 2 ) internalization ( Carney et al . , 1985 ; Morgan et al . , 1987 ) . Investigating the fi rst possibility , we imaged cells stained with FM1 - 43 during SLO exposure . In the presence of Ca 2 + , prominent plasma membrane blebs formed in HEK - 293 ( Video 2 and Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200708010 / DC1 ) , HeLa , and NRK cells ( not de - picted ) . However , instead of being released , the blebs retracted back into the cell body ( Fig . S2 , A and B ; and Video 2 ) . In all cells examined , bleb formation followed by retraction involved > 1 min ; this is slower than plasma membrane resealing , which occurs in < 30 s . Moreover , resealing still occurred after bleb - bing was blocked with cytochalasin D ( Fig . S2 C and Video 3 ; Charras et al . , 2006 ) , showing that blebs are not responsible for pore removal . Blebbing may result from Ca 2 + - induced dis - ruption in the cortical cytoskeleton , with retraction refl ecting recovery of the contractile actin cortex after resealing ( Charras et al . , 2006 ) . Next , we investigated whether SLO pores were removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis . Within 4 min of adding SLO in the presence of Ca 2 + and a membrane - impermeable fl uorescent dextran , numerous endosomes containing the tracer were detected . Without SLO , dextran uptake was only faintly visible after a similar period , which is consistent with the slow constitutive endocytosis rate of these cells . Without Ca 2 + , SLO - permeabilized cells did not reseal , and the tracer entered the cyto - sol ( Fig . 2 A ) . The lysosomal marker Lamp1 was detected on a few SLO / Ca 2 + - induced endosomes ( Fig . 2 B ) , whereas more extensive colocalization was seen with the early endosome marker EEA1 ( Fig . 2 C ) . To determine whether this form of en - docytosis was dynamin dependent , we expressed the dominant - negative K44A mutant of dynamin - 2 that inhibits endocytosis of clathrin - coated vesicles , caveolae , and some types of lipid raft – dependent vesicles ( van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . Dynamin - 2 K44A strongly reduced trans - ferrin uptake but did not inhibit the formation of SLO / Ca 2 + - triggered endosomes ( Fig . 2 D ) or cell resealing ( Fig . 2 E ) . The endosomes formed in response to SLO / Ca 2 + were good candidates for removing SLO pores from the plasma mem - brane . Because membrane repair after SLO pore formation occurs within 10 – 30 s ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) , we investigated whether the kinetics of endocytosis coincided with this period . The plasma membrane of HeLa cells was labeled with a transduced YFP - GPI adenovirus construct ( YFP - GL - GPI ; Keller et al . , 2001 ) , and confocal images were rapidly acquired . Within 5 – 15 s after SLO permeabilization , numerous vesicles containing YFP - GPI were observed inside the cells . In contrast , there was minimal inter - nalization of YFP - GPI in cells not permeabilized by SLO ( Fig . 3 , A and B ; and Videos 4 and 5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200708010 / DC1 ) . To visualize the early dynamics of the toxin in contact with cells , active Cherry - tagged SLO was generated ( Fig . S1 B ) . When locally added to cells , Cherry - SLO permeabilized cells within 12 – 14 s ( assessed by FM1 - 43 infl ux ; unpublished data ) . In the absence of Ca 2 + , a condition that causes full cell permeabilization ( Fig . S1 B ) , the toxin remained associated with the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 C and Video 6 ) . In contrast , when Ca 2 + was present , plasma mem - brane – associated Cherry - SLO rapidly partitioned into dynamic peripheral spots , some of which colocalized with recently formed YFP - GPI endosomes ( Fig . 3 C and Video 7 ) . Thus , SLO / Ca 2 + triggers the formation of endosomes containing GPI - anchored molecules and SLO within the few seconds involved in restora - tion of plasma membrane integrity . Although these observations do not directly demonstrate the presence of functional SLO pores in the endosomes , they are consistent with endocytosis being the mechanism for pore removal . The number of endocytic vesicles within the cells was sig - nifi cantly increased in the presence of Ca 2 + . These vesicles were large ( mean diameter of 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 μ m ) and often contained mem - brane invaginations ( Fig . 4 A ) . Peripheral endosomes of similar size and morphology were detected in cells wounded by scraping ( Fig . 4 B ) . As observed in SLO - permeabilized cells , the absence of Ca 2 + during wounding resulted in markedly less vesicles con - taining the endocytic tracer ( Fig . 4 B ) . Ca 2 + - dependent large endosomes were also observed by EM in cells wounded by electroporation ( unpublished data ) . Our observation of YFP - GPI partitioning into SLO - induced endosomes ( Fig . 3 ) and the fact that SLO interacts with membrane cholesterol during pore formation ( Tweten , 2005 ) sug - gested a role for cholesterol - rich membrane domains in this endocytic mechanism . Taking advantage of the fact that Ca 2 + - dependent endosomes are also induced in scrape - wounded cells , we investigated the effect of acute cholesterol depletion in endo - cytosis and plasma membrane repair .

Characterization of the molecular machinery involved in generating injury - dependent endosomes should provide powerful new tools for further dissecting the fundamental process of plasma membrane repair . Materials and methods Plasma membrane repair assays Cells were cultured at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 in high glucose DME and 10 % FBS containing penicillin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . SLO was puriﬁ ed from BL21 Escherichia coli expressing 6 × histidine - tagged SLO ( cloned into pTrcHisA ; Invitrogen ; plasmid provided by R . Tweeten , University of Oklahoma , Norman , OK ) . Cherry - SLO plasmid was constructed by inserting mCherry ( Shaner et al . , 2004 ) N terminal to SLO in pTrcHisA - SLO . mCherry was ampliﬁ ed by PCR from mCherry - pRSET - B ( Shaner et al . , 2004 ) with primers 5 (cid:3) - ACGCGTCGACGGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - ACGC - GTCGACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG - 3 (cid:3) to append SalI sites onto each end . After SalI digestion , mCherry was ligated into a unique engineered SalI site in pTrcHisA - SLO at 282 – 961 bp . Cell monolayers ( 60 % conﬂ uence ) were washed at 4 ° C with Ca 2 + - free DME containing 5 mM EGTA followed by two more washes in Ca 2 + - free DME . SLO was bound to target cells in Ca 2 + - free DME for 5 min at 4 ° C , and pore formation was triggered by replacing the medium with 37 ° C DME containing or not containing1 . 8 mM Ca 2 + . Experiments per - formed in buffers containing identical concentrations of free Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + ( Rodriguez et al . , 1997 ) demonstrated that 1 μ M Ca 2 + ( but not 1 μ M Mg 2 + ) was sufﬁ cient to promote resealing . After 4 min at 37 ° C , cells were stained for 1 min with 50 μ g / ml PI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , ﬁ xed in 4 % PFA , and imaged by a microscope ( Axiovert 200 ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) equipped with a camera ( CoolSNAP HQ ; Roper Scientiﬁ c ) and MetaMorph software ( MDS Analyti - cal Technologies ) or by a confocal microscope ( LSM500 ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . For FACS assays , 2 × 10 6 trypsinized cells were incubated with SLO in suspension for 5 min at 4 ° C in 250 μ l of Ca 2 + - free DME followed by re - suspension in 37 ° C medium containing or not containing Ca 2 + and PI staining ( 4 - min total incubation time ) . In scrape wounding assays , cells were re - moved from the dish at 37 ° C with a rubber policeman ( Becton Dickinson ) , and PI was added either during scraping or after 4 min at 37 ° C in the presence or absence of Ca 2 + ( Ca 2 + - free medium contained 10 mM EGTA ) . After ﬂ ow cytometry ( FACSCalibur ; Becton Dickinson ) of at least 10 , 000 cells , the data were analyzed using FlowJo v6 . 3 software ( Tree Star , Inc . ) . Drug treatments ATP was depleted by pretreating cells for 1 h with 10 mM sodium azide and 20 mM 2 - deoxyglucose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in glucose - free DME . Cytochalasin D or latrunculin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the incubation medium at 1 μ g / ml for 45 min and maintained at the same concentration during the assays . Cholesterol was extracted by pretreating cells with the indicated concentrations of M (cid:2) CD in DME , 0 . 2 % BSA , and 10 mM Hepes / NaOH , pH 7 , for 45 min . Live time - lapse imaging Subconﬂ uent cells plated on glass - bottom dishes ( Mattek ) were loaded with Fluo - 3 ( Invitrogen ) as described previously ( Reddy et al . , 2001 ) or were in - cubated with 4 μ M FM1 - 43 ( Invitrogen ) before exposure to SLO in 37 ° C DME containing or not containing Ca 2 + ( Invitrogen ) . Dishes were placed on a heated stage ( 37 ° C ) , and time - lapse imaging on an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ camera or an LSM510 confocal microscope was initiated immediately at 1 - ( Fluo - 3 ) or 6 - s ( FM1 - 43 ) inter - vals for 5 min . Quantitative analysis of intracellular ﬂ uorescence was per - formed using MetaMorph software . Confocal spinning disk microscopy ( PerkinElmer ) was performed in cells transduced with adenovirus encoding YFP - GL - GPI ( Keller et al . , 2001 ) on a 37 ° C heated stage as previously of endocytosis and plasma membrane resealing was ob - served after cholesterol extraction with methyl – (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ( M (cid:2) CD ; Fig . 4 , B and C ) , providing a direct link between injury - induced endocytosis and plasma membrane repair . The rapid endocytosis induced by SLO / Ca 2 + was enhanced after treatment with drugs that interfere with actin polymerization , cytochalasin D ( Fig . 5 A ) , or latrunculin A ( not depicted ) . Cyto - chalasin D enhanced Ca 2 + - dependent endocytosis in cells injured by SLO or scraping , as shown by quantitative quench protection ( Fig . 5 B and Fig . S3 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200708010 / DC1 ) and EM assays ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . Importantly , cytochalasin D treatment also increased the mean size of endosomes ( Fig . 5 , C and E ; and Fig . S3 B ) and enhanced resealing in cells injured by both conditions ( Fig . 5 F ) . These results demonstrate a direct correlation between the ex - tent of endocytosis and that of plasma membrane repair . Consistent with our fi ndings , an earlier study reported the rapid formation of EEA1 - positive endosomes in target cells per - meabilized by the cytotoxic T lymphocyte pore - forming protein perforin ( Keefe et al . , 2005 ) . However , because perforin requires Ca 2 + to form pores , the Ca 2 + requirement of this endocytic process could not be directly assessed . Ca 2 + infl ux induced by ionomycin failed to induce endocytosis , leading Keefe et al . ( 2005 ) to conclude that perforin - induced endocytosis was not triggered by Ca 2 + and , thus , was unrelated to the target cell resealing mechanism . However , it is important to note that Ca 2 + ionophores cause irre - versible cellular damage , including a rapid ATP depletion ( Gmitter et al . , 1996 ) that can explain the block in endocytosis . Because SLO forms pores with or without Ca 2 + ( Fig . S1 A ) , we could di - rectly demonstrate that both endocytosis and plasma membrane repair require extracellular Ca 2 + . Thus , it is likely that the pore - induced Ca 2 + - dependent endocytosis we describe here also medi - ates plasma membrane repair in cells subjected to CTL attack . Ca 2 + infl ux into injured cells triggers lysosomal exocytosis , a response required for effi cient plasma membrane resealing ( Rodriguez et al . , 1997 ; Reddy et al . , 2001 ; McNeil et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , the rapid endocytosis induced by SLO or scraping in the presence of Ca 2 + may represent a compensatory response to lysosomal exocytosis . Compensatory endocytosis , although mostly studied in specialized neurosecretory cells ( Gundelfi nger et al . , 2003 ) , is detected after exocytosis in several cell types ( Ninomiya et al . , 1996 ; Cocucci et al . , 2004 , 2007 ) . Collectively , our fi ndings suggest that injury - induced endo - cytosis represents an important cellular defense mechanism against pore - forming proteins generated endogenously ( comple - ment and perforin ) or exogenously ( bacterial toxins ) . Moreover , rapid endocytosis also appears to participate in the removal of lesions created by mechanical tears . In future studies , it will be important to determine whether defects in this endocytic pathway occur in genetic syndromes showing defi cient plasma membrane number / size ( clear vesicles ; arrows ) is apparent in cytochalasin D – treated cells .

Before imaging , cells were treated for 20 min with 50 μ g / ml cycloheximide to avoid detection of intracellular newly synthesized YFP - GPI . SLO was locally added using a microinjection system ( Eppendorf ) . 2D compressed confocal stack images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Kymographs were generated by uploading raw images ( a time course of 2D compressed confocal stacks ) into iQ software ( Andor Technology ) , drawing a line along the pe - riphery of a selected cell , and displaying the pixel intensity over time for each pixel along the line at each time point . Endocytosis assays To visualize endocytic vesicles , cells were exposed to AlexaFluor555 transfer - rin ( Invitrogen ) or SLO in Ca 2 + / DME containing 2 . 5 mg / ml of lysine - ﬁ xable 10 - kD Texas red ( TR ) dextran ( Invitrogen ) . After 4 min at 37 ° C , cells were ﬁ xed , mounted in SyberGold ( Invitrogen ) , and examined by confocal micros - copy on an LSM510 microscope . Cells expressing dynamin - 2 wild - type or K44A GFP constructs in pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . ) were exam - ined by confocal microscopy for dextran or transferrin uptake 18 h after trans - fection ( Lipofectamine ) . For immunoﬂ uorescence , cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % PFA in DME and 10 mM Hepes / NaOH , pH 7 , permeabilized in PBS , 0 . 05 % sapo - nin , and 1 % BSA , and stained for 1 h with anti – rat Lamp1 mAb ( LYIC6 ; pro - vided by I . Mellman , Genentech , South San Fransisco , CA ) or anti - EEA1 mAb ( BD Biosciences ) . Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or Sytox green ( Invitrogen ) . Endocytosis was quantiﬁ ed by FACS after SLO or scrape wounding using a trypan blue ﬂ uorescence quench assay ( Fig . S3 A ; Pearson et al . , 2003 ) . Cells were stained on the plasma membrane with 1 μ g / ml wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) – FITC for 1 min on ice , washed three times in PBS , wounded by scraping or by incubation with SLO , and incubated for 2 min at 37 ° C with 0 . 2 % trypan blue before washing and FACS analysis . EM Cells treated with SLO for 4 min at 37 ° C or scraped from the dish and fur - ther incubated for 4 min at 37 ° C in Ca 2 + / DME containing BSA - gold ( OD of 520 nm = 200 ; Slot and Geuze , 1985 ) were processed for transmission EM as previously described ( Rodriguez et al . , 1997 ) . Quantiﬁ cation was performed by counting all vesicles containing BSA - gold ( including clathrin - coated vesicles , which corresponded to < 7 % of all vesicles found after 4 min ) in 20 cell sections / sample ( which contained 60 – 200 vesicles in the Ca 2 + conditions ) . The area of all vesicles found in the sections was mea - sured using the outline function of ImageJ . Online supplemental material Fig .

Video 1 shows the transient Ca 2 + inﬂ ux caused by SLO pores . Video 2 shows the rapid Ca 2 + - dependent block in FM1 - 43 inﬂ ux after SLO permeabilization , reﬂ ecting plasma membrane repair . Video 3 shows the rapid block in FM1 - 43 inﬂ ux after SLO / Ca 2 + in cells treated with cytochalasin D , a treatment that blocks blebbing . Videos 4 and 5 show that endosomes form a few seconds after SLO permeabilization . Video 6 shows that Cherry - SLO remains associated with the plasma membrane in the absence of Ca 2 + . Video 7 shows that Cherry - SLO is internalized in the presence of Ca 2 + . Online supplemental material is available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200708010 / DC1 .
