Thisreviewdescribesthemechanismsunderlyingthemajorstepsofmigrationand the signaling pathways that regulate them , and outlines recent advances investigating the nature of polarity in migrating cells and the pathways that establish it . O ur liaison with cell migration , as hu - mans , begins shortly after concep - tion , accompanies us throughout life , and often contributes to our death . Although migratory phenomena are apparent as early as implantation , cell migration orchestrates morphogenesis throughout embryonic devel - opment ( 1 ) . During gastrulation , for example , large groups of cells migrate collectively as sheets to form the resulting three - layer em - bryo . Subsequently , cells migrate from vari - ous epithelial layers to target locations , where they then differentiate to form the specialized cells that make up different tissues and or - gans . Analogous migrations occur in the adult . In the renewal of skin and intestine , fresh epithelial cells migrate up from the basal layer and the crypts , respectively . Mi - gration is also a prominent component of tissue repair and immune surveillance , in which leukocytes from the circulation mi - grate into the surrounding tissue to destroy invading microorganisms and infected cells and to clear debris . The importance of cell migration however , goes far beyond humans and extends to plants and even to single - celled organisms ( 2 ) . Migration contributes to several important pathological processes , including vascular dis - ease , osteoporosis , chronic inflammatory dis - eases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple 1 Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , Royal Free and University College School of Medicine , London W1W 7BS , UK . 2 Departments of Microbiology and Biomed - ical Engineering , Cardiovascular Research Center and Mellon Prostate Cancer Research Institute ; 3 Depart - ment of Microbiology ; 4 Department of Cell Biology ; University of Virginia School of Medicine , Charlottes - ville , VA 22908 , USA . 5 Department of Cell and Devel - opmental Biology and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC 27599 , USA . 6 Section of Cell and Develop - mental Biology , Division of Biological Sciences and Center for Molecular Genetics , University of Califor - nia , San Diego , 9500 Gilman Drive , La Jolla , CA 92093 – 0634 , USA . 7 Department of Cell Biology , The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 8 Department of Cel - lular and Molecular Biology , Northwestern University , School of Medicine , Chicago , IL 60611 , USA .

Thus , understanding the fundamental mechanisms un - derlying cell migration holds the promise of effective therapeutic approaches for treating disease , cellular transplantation , and the prepa - ration of artificial tissues . Over the past few years , immense progress has been made in understanding cell migration , including the establishment of polar structures , the regulation of the dynamic processes of actin and microtubule polymerization , and the regu - lation of spatial and temporal signal transduc - tion . This review summarizes and highlights some of these advances in the context of the need to integrate and coordinate the many cel - lular events that compose migration . The Migration Cycle Our present understanding of cell migration is a composite derived from studies of different cell types and environments . In general , cell migra - tion can be usefully conceptualized as a cyclic process ( 3 ) . The initial response of a cell to a migration - promoting agent is to polarize and extend protrusions in the direction of migration . These protrusions can be large , broad lamelli - podia or spike - like filopodia , are usually driven by actin polymerization , and are stabilized by adhering to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or adjacent cells via transmembrane receptors linked to the actin cytoskeleton . These adhe - sions serve as traction sites for migration as the cell moves forward over them , and they are disassembled at the cell rear , allowing it to detach . Interestingly , the movement of cell sheets shows some features of single - cell mi - gration ; however , the polarization extends across the sheet . Although many aspects of this picture are shared among different cell types , the details can differ greatly . For example , these steps are observed most distinctly in slow - moving cells such as fibroblasts , but are not as obvious in fast - moving cells such as neutrophils , which seem to glide over the substratum . In addition , a cell’s migratory behavior depends on its en - vironment . Somitic cells migrating in vivo , for example , show large single protrusions and highly directed migration , in contrast to the multiple small protrusions they display on pla - nar substrates ; and cancer cells can modify their morphology and nature of migration in re - sponse to environmental changes ( 4 , 5 ) . The Protrusive Machinery Actin filaments are intrinsically polarized with fast - growing “barbed” ends and slow - growing “pointed” ends , and this inherent polarity is used to drive membrane protrusion . However , the organization of filaments depends on the type of protrusion : In lamellipodia , actin fila - ments form a branching “dendritic” network , whereas in filopodia they are organized into long parallel bundles ( 6 ) . Actin polymerization in lamellipodia is mediated by the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , which binds to the sides or tip of a pre - existing actin filament and induces the forma - tion of a new daughter filament that branches off the mother filament ( 6 , 7 ) . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is localized by WASP / WAVE family members , which are themselves activat - ed at the cell membrane ( 6 ) ( see below ) . Push - ing of the membrane , the actual protrusive event , is believed to occur not by elonga - tion of the actin filament per se but by an “elastic Brownian ratchet” mechanism , in which thermal energy bends the nascent short filaments , storing elastic energy . Un - bending of an elongated filament against the leading edge would then provide the driving force for protrusion ( 7 ) . Several actin - binding proteins regulate the rate and organization of actin polymerization in protrusions by affecting the pool of available monomers and free ends ( 7 , 8 ) . For example , profilin prevents self - nucleation by binding to actin monomers and also serves to selectively target monomers to barbed ends . Filament elon - gation is terminated by capping proteins , there - by restricting polymerization to new filaments close to the plasma membrane . In addition , dis - assembly of older filaments , which is needed to generate actin monomers for polymerization at the front end , is assisted by proteins of the ADF / cofilin family , which sever filaments and promote actin dissociation from the pointed end . Other proteins play supporting roles in the den - dritic network : Cortactin stabilizes branches , whereas filamin A and (cid:1) - actinin stabilize the entire network by cross - linking filaments ( 6 ) . Filopodial protrusion is thought to occur by a filament treadmilling mechanism , in which actin filaments within a bundle elon - gate at their barbed ends and release actin monomers from their pointed ends ( 6 ) . The long and unbranched filament organization is consistent with assembly occurring by elon - gation rather than by branched nucleation . Many proteins are enriched at filopodial tips , including Ena / VASP proteins , which bind barbed ends of actin filaments and antagonize both capping and branching , thereby allow - ing continuous elongation of filaments and fascin , which bundles actin filaments and might thereby generate the stiffness needed to allow efficient pushing of the plasma mem - brane in filopodia ( 6 ) .

Biophys - ical considerations suggest that the dendritic organization of lamellipodia provides a tight brush - like structure that is able to push along a broad length of plasma membrane ( 7 ) . Through localized activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , the lamellipodium could be induced to grow in a particular direction , providing the basis for directional migration . In con - trast , filopodia , with their parallel bundle or - ganization , are particularly well designed to serve as sensors and to explore the local environment , although they are not essential for chemotaxis . Rho family proteins : Central regulators of protrusion . Rho family small guano - sine triphosphate ( GTP ) – binding proteins ( GTPases ) are pivotal regulators of actin and adhesion organization and control the forma - tion of lamellipodia and filopodia . They are conformationally regulated by the binding of GTP and GDP : When bound to GTP , they are active and interact with their downstream target proteins , which include protein ki - nases , lipid - modifying enzymes , and activa - tors of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 9 ) . Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and inactivated by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) . Of the Rho GTPases , Rac , Cdc42 , and RhoG are required for protrusion of lamellipodia and filopodia . The major targets for Rac and Cdc42 that mediate actin polymerization in protrusions are the WASP / WAVE family of Arp2 / 3 complex activators . Rac stimulates lamellipodial exten - sion by activating WAVE proteins ( 10 ) . Cdc42 binds to WASP proteins , and in vitro this stim - ulates the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce dendritic actin polymerization ( 6 ) . However , this inter - action may not account for Cdc42’s ability to induce filopodia , because cells lacking WASPs are still able to form filopodia ( 11 ) ; and , as described above , filopodia contain parallel actin filaments and not a dendritic network . RhoG does not interact directly with WASPs but ap - pears to act upstream of Rac by binding to and activating a Rac - GEF complex ( 12 ) . WAVE / WASP proteins may themselves regulate the activity of Rac and Cdc42 by binding to GAPs and GEFs ( 13 – 15 ) , and could thereby generate positive or negative feedback loops to regulate the extent of Cdc42 / Rac - induced actin polymerization . WAVE / WASP proteins can also be regulated by other stimuli apart from Cdc42 and Rac , including Src family kinases , the adaptor pro - teins Nck and WIP , and phosphoinositides ( 7 , 14 , 16 – 19 ) . Polarizing the Cell : A Keystone of Migration For a cell to migrate , it must be polarized , which means that the molecular processes at the front and the back of a moving cell are different . Establishing and maintaining cell polarity in re - sponse to extracellular stimuli appear to be me - diated by a set of interlinked positive feedback loops involving Rho family GTPases , phospho - inositide 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) , integrins , microtu - bules , and vesicular transport ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Although the following discussion synthesizes information from multiple cell systems , the rel - ative contributions of the various signals depend on the cell type and the specific stimulus . Cdc42 : A master regulator of cell polar - ity . Cdc42 is a master regulator of cell polar - ity in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to humans . Cdc42 is active toward the front of migrating cells ( 20 ) , and both inhi - bition and global activation of Cdc42 can disrupt the directionality of migration ( 9 ) . One way in which Cdc42 influences polarity is by restricting where lamellipodia form ( 21 ) ( see below ) . Cdc42 can also affect polarity by localizing the microtubule - organizing center ( MTOC ) and Golgi apparatus in front of the nucleus , oriented toward the leading edge . Cdc42 - induced MTOC orientation may con - tribute to polarized migration by facilitating microtubule growth into the lamella and microtubule - mediated delivery of Golgi - derived vesicles to the leading edge , provid - ing membrane and associated proteins needed for forward protrusion ( 9 , 22 ) . Reorganiza - tion of the MTOC appears to be more important for the migration of slow - moving cells , because in fast - moving cells such as neutrophils and T cells , it is usually located behind the nucleus ( 23 ) . The effects of Cdc42 on MTOC position appear to be exerted mainly through a path - way involving the Cdc42 effector PAR6 , which exists in a complex with PAR3 and an atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) ( 24 ) . The molecular mechanism by which the PAR6 / PAR3 / aPKC complex orients the MTOC is incompletely understood , but recent evidence suggests that it could occur as a result of local capture of microtubules at the leading edge via APC , a protein that binds tubulin and localizes to the ends of microtubules ( 9 ) , via CLIP170 and IQGAP ( 22 ) and / or via the microtubule - based dynein / dynactin motor protein complex ( 24 ) . A downstream target of Cdc42 , the kinase PAK1 , can itself mediate Cdc42 activation downstream of heterotrimeric GTP - binding pro - tein ( G protein ) – coupled receptors , which are activated by many chemoattractants . These in - teractions define a positive feedback loop be - tween Cdc42 and PAK1 , resulting in high Cdc42 activity at the leading edge ( 25 ) . Other feedback loops involving integrins may also contribute to maintaining local Cdc42 activation ( 9 , 26 ) . PI3Ks and PTEN : The gradient amplifiers . A surprising aspect of chemotaxis is the ability of cells to respond directionally to very shallow chemoattractant gradients ( less than a 10 % dif - ference in the concentration of chemoattractant between the front and rear of a cell ) ( 27 ) . Such a small difference in signaling between the front and rear needs to be amplified into steeper intracellular signaling gradients in order to gen - erate a cellular response . The phosphoinosi - tides PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( PIP 3 ) and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 [ PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ] are key signaling molecules that be - come rapidly and highly polarized in cells that are exposed to a gradient of chemoattractant ( Fig . 2 ) . This amplification process involves both localized accumulation and activation of PI3Ks , which generate PIP 3 / PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and the phosphatase PTEN , which removes them . In Dictyostelium , for example , PI3Ks rapidly accu - mulate at the leading edge of cells in response to a chemoattractant , whereas PTEN becomes re - stricted to the sides and the rear ( 27 , 28 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Cells with altered PI3K or PTEN activity can usually migrate but exhibit a significantly re - duced ability to move directionally up a che - moattractant gradient . Although it is not yet clear what regulates the localization of PI3Ks , Cdc42 activation is implicated in PTEN exclusion from protrusions in leukocytes , and PIP 3 appears to be required for localizing Cdc42 activity ( 25 ) . These results imply that there is a network of positive feedback loops between Cdc42 , PI3K products , and PTEN that work together to initi - ate and maintain the polarity of migrating cells , although a Cdc42 paralog has not yet been iden - tified in Dictyostelium . Localized Rac activation : Initiating and maintaining protrusion . How do Cdc42 and PI3Ks lead to activation of the actin polymeriza - tion machinery required for active protrusion ? The key event appears to be defining where Rac is active ( Fig . 1 ) . This is probably achieved by activating or delivering a Rac exchange factor locally , and indeed several Rac GEFs are acti - vated by PI3K products ( 29 ) . Once Rac is active , several feedback loops have been identified that help maintain directional protrusion . First , Rac can itself stimulate the recruitment and / or acti - vation of PI3Ks at the plasma membrane , which then act upstream of Rac by PIP 3 - sensitive Rac GEFs ( 21 , 29 ) . Second , microtubules and Rac may form a positive feedback loop in which microtubule polymerization activates Rac , and Rac in turn stabilizes microtubules ( 22 ) . Third , integrin engagement leads to Rac activation and membrane targeting ( 30 ) , and so new adhesions formed at the leading edge will stimulate Rac , which in turn induces recruitment and clustering of activated integrins to the edge of lamellipodia ( 31 , 32 ) . PIP 3 also contributes to integrin activa - tion ( 33 ) and may thereby further enhance the positive feedback to Rac . Defining the tail . Is restriction of PIP 3 , ac - tive Cdc42 , and Rac to the front of the cell sufficient to make the back of the cell follow the front ? In several cell types , inhibition of Rho leads to the formation of an extended tail , possibly because actomyosin - based contractili - ty in the body of the cell is decreased . Rho may R E V I E W S 5 DECEMBER 2003 VOL 302 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1706 on M a y 2 , 2018 h tt p : / / sc i en c e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m also act in the tail by stabilizing microtubules , which would then promote focal adhesion turn - over ( see below ) ( 22 , 34 ) . One model for how migrating cells maintain polarity is based on the fact that Rho and Rac are mutually antagonistic , each suppressing the other’s activity ( 35 ) . Ac - tive Rac at the leading edge of cells would suppress Rho activity , whereas Rho would be more active at the sides and rear of the cell and suppress Rac activity , thereby preventing Rac - mediated protrusion at sites other than the lead - ing edge ( 36 , 37 ) . However , active Rac has been implicated in detachment at the rear of migrating cells ( 38 ) , and also Rho can lead to Rac activation ( 39 ) . Integrins and Adhesion in Migration For migration to occur , a protrusion must form and then stabilize by attaching to the surroundings . Although many different re - ceptors are involved in the migration of different cell types , the integrins are a ma - jor family of migration - promoting recep - tors . These receptors act as the “feet” of a migrating cell by supporting adhesion to the ECM or other cells and by linking via adapters with actin filaments on the inside of the cell . As described above , integrins activate migration - related signaling mole - cules . They are also recipients of “inside - Fig . 2 . Steps in cell migration . Polarity is intrinsic to a migrating cell ( A ) . Cdc42 , along with Par proteins and aPKC , are involved in the generation of polarity . Several additional proteins are implicated in polarity , which results in directed vesicle trafﬁcking toward the leading edge , organiza - tion of microtubules ( in some cells ) , and the localization of the MTOC ( in some cells ) and Golgi apparatus in front of the nucleus . In the presence of a chemotactic agent , PIP 3 is produced at the leading edge through the localized action of PI3K , which resides at the leading edge , and PTEN , a PIP 3 phosphatase that resides at the cell margins and rear . PTEN and myosin II are implicated in restricting protrusions to the cell front . The migration cycle begins with the formation of a protrusion ( B ) . WASP / WAVE proteins are targets of Rac and Cdc42 and other signaling path - ways and regulate the formation of actin branches on existing actin ﬁlaments by their action on the Arp2 / 3 complex . Actin polymerization , in turn , is regulated by proteins that control the availability of activated actin monomers ( proﬁlin ) and debranching and depolymerizing proteins ( ADF / coﬁlin ) , as well as capping and severing proteins . Protrusions are stabilized by the formation of adhesions . This process requires integrin activation , clustering , and the recruitment of structural and signaling components to nascent adhesions . Integrins are activated by talin bind - ing and through PKC - , Rap1 - , and PI3K - mediated pathways . Integrin clustering results from binding to multivalent ligands and is regulated by Rac . At the cell rear , adhesions disassemble as the rear retracts ( C ) . This process is mediated by several possibly related signaling pathways that include Src / FAK / ERK , Rho , myosin II , calcium , calcineurin , calpain , and the delivery of components by microtubules . Many of these molecules may also regulate the disassembly of adhesions at the cell front , behind the leading edge .

The integrins are heterodimeric recep - tors consisting of (cid:1) and (cid:2) chains with large ligand - binding extracellular domains and short cytoplasmic domains . The binding of ligands to the extracellular portion of inte - grins leads to conformational changes in the receptors by changing interactions be - tween the (cid:1) - and (cid:2) - chain cytoplasmic do - mains ( 41 ) and to integrin clustering . This combination of occupancy and clustering initiates intracellular signals such as pro - tein tyrosine phosphorylation , activation of small GTPases , and changes in phospholip - id biosynthesis that regulate the formation and strengthening of adhesion sites , the organization and dynamics of the cytoskel - eton , and cell polarity during migration ( 40 ) . Although integrins themselves do not have any catalytic activity , signals are trans - mitted through direct and indirect interactions with many partners of integrins . Activated integrins preferentially local - ize to the leading edge , where new adhe - sions form ( 31 ) . Integrin affinity is regulat - ed in large part by alterations in the con - formation of the integrin extracellular do - mains that result from interactions at the integrin cytoplasmic tail ( 42 ) . Activation of key intermediates such as the GTPase Rap1 or PKC increase integrin affinity . Con - versely , activation of Raf - 1 kinase often suppresses integrin activation ( 43 ) . The cy - toskeletal linker protein talin promotes in - tegrin activation by binding to a subset of integrin (cid:2) - subunit tails and disrupting inte - grin (cid:1) - (cid:2) – subunit tail interactions ( 42 , 44 ) . The signaling potential of integrins can also be modified by posttranslational mod - ifications of the cytoplasmic domains . For example , integrin (cid:1) 4 phosphorylation on serine blocks the binding of paxillin , a signaling adapter protein . In migrating cells , (cid:1) 4 phosphorylation at the leading edge ( Fig . 1 ) and the consequent release of bound paxillin are required to maintain sta - ble lamellipodia of cells migrating on li - gands for integrin (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) 1 ( 45 ) . Formation of adhesions . The mecha - nism by which adhesions assemble in mi - grating cells is a major challenge that is only beginning to be addressed . Presum - ably it begins with small - scale clustering due to the multivalent nature of the ECM to which the cell is adhering . Some cells , particularly rapidly migrating ones such as leukocytes , have few visible integrin clus - ters , and thus very small submicroscopic adhesions are probably important for their migration . In other cells , small adhesions known as focal complexes can be observed at the leading edge . Formation of these adhesions depends on Rac and Cdc42 , and these adhesions stabilize the lamellipodium by mediating attachment to the ECM , thereby contributing to efficient migration . However , cells with large integrin clusters ( “focal adhesions” ) are tightly adherent and are typically either nonmigratory or move very slowly . The assembly of focal adhe - sions involves Rho as well as myosin - in - duced contractility . During their formation , some protein components enter adhesions with similar kinetics , which suggests that they exist in preformed cytoplasmic complexes ( 46 ) . However , other components enter adhe - sions with very distinct kinetics , which is consistent with a model in which a regula - tory event initiates the serial addition of different proteins . Paxillin , for example , is present in nascent adhesions , whereas (cid:1) - ac - tinin appears more prominently in “older” adhesions ( 46 ) . Tractional forces . By connecting the ECM to the intracellular cytoskeleton , in - tegrins serve as both traction sites over which the cell moves and as mechanosen - sors , transmitting information about the physical state of the ECM into the cell and altering cytoskeletal dynamics ( 3 , 47 , 48 ) . Because migrating cells must be able to detach , yet exert traction on the substratum , migration speed is a biphasic function of the strength of cell attachment . The latter is determined by the density of adhesive li - gands on the substrate , the density of adhe - sion receptors on the cells , and the affinity of the receptors for the adhesive ligands ( 3 ) . Thus , shifts in any of these parameters can have a dramatic effect on migration . The force transmitted to sites of adhe - sion derives from the interaction of myosin II with actin filaments that attach to these sites . Myosin II activity is regulated by myosin light - chain ( MLC ) phosphoryl - ation , which is either directly positively regulated by MLC kinase ( MLCK ) or Rho kinase ( ROCK ) or negatively regulated by MLC phosphatase , which is itself phospho - rylated and inhibited by ROCK . Whereas MLCK is regulated by intracellular calcium concentration as well as by phosphoryl - ation by a number of kinases , ROCK is regulated by binding Rho - GTP ( 49 ) . MLC phosphorylation activates myosin , resulting in increased contractility and transmission of tension to sites of adhesion . In migrating cells , the strongest forces have been reported to be transmitted to the focal complexes at the leading edge and the retracting regions at the rear ( 47 ) . In con - trast , in more adhesive cells , force trans - mitted through a focal adhesion to the sub - stratum is proportional to the adhesion’s cross - sectional area ( 50 ) . It is striking that the tractional forces measured in many studies far exceed what should be needed for cell translocation . One explanation is that cells in tissue culture may be respond - ing to a “wound” environment , which acti - vates Rho and thus stimulates contractility . Because traction forces are unevenly dis - tributed over migrating cells , integrin sig - naling is a means of reporting these force differences to the cell . Adhesion disassembly at the front . Ad - hesion disassembly is observed both at the leading edge , where it accompanies the for - mation of new protrusions , and at the cell rear , where it promotes tail retraction . At the front of migrating cells , adhesions at the base of a protrusion disassemble as new adhesions form at the leading edge ( 46 ) . However , some adhesions persist and ma - ture into larger , more stable structures . Lit - tle is known about adhesion disassembly versus maturation ; however , targeting of microtubules has been implicated as one factor that promotes adhesion disassembly ( 34 ) . Both protein kinases and phospha - tases also appear to be central to the regu - lation of adhesion turnover and stability ( 51 ) . For example , cells lacking the ty - rosine kinases FAK or Src have more and larger adhesions and migrate poorly ( 46 , 52 ) . The interaction of FAK with Src and the adapter proteins Cas and Crk , which in turn activate Rac - specific GEFs , appears to regulate adhesion turnover . Adhesion turn - over in migrating cells is also regulated by a complex of Rac - associated proteins ( 53 ) and by the mitogen - activated protein kinase ERK ( 54 ) . The emerging evidence favors a model for adhesion turnover in which acti - vation of the protein tyrosine kinases FAK and Src accompanies the formation of an adhesion signaling complex that in turn mediates the localized activation of Rac and ERK . These signals then contribute to the turnover of adhesions at the leading edge . Adhesion disassembly and retraction at the rear . At the rear of migrating cells , adhesions must also disassemble . In fibro - blasts , the rearmost adhesions often tether the cell strongly to the substratum , result - ing in a long tail to the site of anchorage . The tension can be sufficient to physically break the linkage between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton , with the result that in - tegrin is left behind while the rest of the cell moves on ; a similar behavior has been observed in vivo ( 3 ) . High tension exerted on the rear adhesions contributes to detach - ment ( 3 ) . Several lines of evidence point to a role for myosin II in this event as well as in the maintenance of polarity . Dictyosteli - um cells deficient in myosin II or its regu - lator PAKa show impaired retraction and the formation of multiple pseudopodia along the sides of the cell ( 55 ) . A similar phenotype is seen in monocytes or neutrophils in which myosin II assembly is blocked through inhibition of Rho or Rho kinase ( 36 , 37 ) .

FAK , Src , and the other regulators of adhesion turnover at the front appear to work at the rear as well . In addition , intra - cellular calcium levels are implicated in the disassembly of adhesions at the rear . The tension generated in migrating cells by strong adhesions in the rear can be suffi - cient to open stretch - activated calcium channels ( 56 ) . Potential targets for calcium are the calcium - regulated phosphatase cal - cineurin and the calcium - activated protease calpain , which is also activated by ERK and has the potential to cleave several focal ad - hesion proteins , including integrins , talin , vinculin , and FAK ( 57 , 58 ) . A Molecular Model for Cell Migration The information discussed above can be assembled into an emerging model for how cells polarize and migrate ( Fig . 2 ) . Cells migrate directionally in response to a vari - ety of cues , including gradients of chemo - kines , growth factors , or ECM molecules . These factors engage cell surface receptors , initiating a cascade of events , including the activation of G proteins or tyrosine kinases , the stimulation of GEFs for Cdc42 , and the activation of lipid kinases and the subse - quent recruitment of activated Rac . The local activation of Rac and / or Cdc42 , in concert with other regulators such as WASP / WAVE family proteins and the Arp2 / 3 complex , stimulates the formation of a branching actin filament network at the leading edge , which in turn induces a pro - trusion in the direction of migration . The polymerization of actin is regulated by pro - teins that cap growing filaments , sever old - er portions of existing filaments , and con - trol the availability of activated actin monomers . Localized activation of Cdc42 and Rac decreases Rho activity and enhanc - es PI3K activity and the production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 / PIP 3 at the leading edge . Cdc42 also contributes to cell polarization by me - diating reorientation of the MTOC toward the cell front , leading to growth of micro - tubules and delivery of vesicles into this region . Integrins and other adhesion mole - cules are activated by PI3Ks , PKCs , and / or Rap via talin , and they stabilize the protru - sion via structural connections to the actin filaments . They also signal to Rac , which promotes recruitment of additional inte - grins and the formation of adhesions . New adhesions at the leading edge in turn rein - force high Rac , Cdc42 , and PI3K activity , whereas the formation of a gradient of Rho activity that is low at the leading edge and higher at the rear and sides further con - strains Rac activity to the front . Polariza - tion is often accompanied by sensitization of receptors at the leading edge , thus favor - ing continued movement in the same direc - tion . Adhesions transmit propulsive forces and serve as traction points over which the cell moves . The migration cycle is complet - ed as adhesions disassemble and the rear retracts . The disassembly of adhesions is controlled by pathways that include FAK , ERK , Src , and the protease calpain , as well as microtubule dynamics . Retraction at the rear requires Rho kinase and is a myosin - dependent process . The release of adhe - sions at the rear and front appear to share some common mechanisms and are coupled to the formation of protrusions at the front . Moving Ahead in Migration Research into the molecular basis of cell migration has progressed rapidly over the past few years . Key regulatory molecules have been identified and the mechanisms of component processes elucidated , providing potential targets for therapeutic interven - tion in diseases involving cell migration . However , there are still many unresolved issues regarding how cells establish and maintain their polarity , how adhesions form and disperse , how cells migrate in vivo , and how cells recognize their targets . In addi - tion , we know little about how the spatially segregated component processes are inte - grated temporally and spatially across the cell . This will require technologies that can recognize , quantify , and perturb localized signals , as well as methods to visualize and characterize the dynamics of localized events that are below the resolution of the light microscope . Other challenges include determining when and where important molecular complexes form and disperse , elucidating the structures of the supramo - lecular complexes that drive migration , ac - cumulating quantitative data on molecular dynamics and concentrations , and develop - ing models of the component processes and their integration . Ultimately , we will have to study these molecular details in cells migrating in vivo . Although some of these questions and challenges seem daunting at present , the future looks bright as imaging , structure , molecular , and transgenic tech - nologies continue to improve .
