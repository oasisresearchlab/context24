In addition to orchestrat - ing the appropriate combination of regulators and actin - binding proteins , different actin - based structures must insulate themselves from one another to maintain spec - iﬁcity within a crowded cytoplasm . Actin speciﬁcation is particularly challenging in complex eukaryotes where a multitude of protein isoforms and actin structures oper - ate within the same cell . Fission yeast Schizosacchar - omyces pombe possesses a single actin isoform that functions in three distinct structures throughout the cell cycle . In this review we explore recent studies in ﬁssion yeast that help unravel how different actin structures operate in cells . Introduction Fission yeast provides an important model for studying actin function . The ﬁssion yeast actin cytoskeleton is com - paratively simple , relying on only three actin structures for growth – actin patches , actin cables , and the contractile ring ( Figure 1 ) [ 1 ] . An additional actin structure is also used during mating ( Box 1 ) . Work from numerous labs has iden - tiﬁed most of the key components required for the regula - tion , assembly , maintenance and disassembly of these structures ( Figure 1c ) . Identiﬁcation of the important players in ﬁssion yeast has beneﬁted from genetic screens and a small genome with low redundancy . Modiﬁcation of the genome using homologous recombination allows for easy genetic manipulation and precise localization of ﬂuorescently tagged proteins expressed at endogenous levels ( Box 2 ) . Localization studies have been extremely powerful in recent years with the emergence of sophisticated imaging techniques permitting high spatial and temporal resolution tracking of protein dynamics ( Box 2 ) . This review summarizes insights gleaned from in vivo experi - ments , and from sophisticated in vitro studies with puri - ﬁed components ( Box 3 ) , that are beginning to shape our understanding of how different actin structures function in cells . Actin patches – endocytosis Actin patches assemble at sites of endocytosis , accompa - nying polarized cell growth at the tips of interphase cells and at the centers of dividing cells [ 2 – 4 ] . This suggests that endocytic actin patch function accompanies cell wall syn - thesis and remodeling . However , the identity of the cargo endocytosed by actin patches in ﬁssion yeast is not known . In budding yeast , endocytic cargo includes membrane receptors , transporters , permeases , and SNAREs [ 5 , 6 ] . In contrast to animal cells , endocytic internalization in yeast strictly depends on Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin assembly and does not rely on dynamin activity [ 5 , 7 , 8 ] , although the dynamin - like Vps1 plays a role in budding yeast endocytosis [ 9 ] . As in animal cells , actin assembly cooperates with BAR ( Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ) and F - BAR proteins to promote membrane invagination and scission [ 5 , 7 , 10 ] . Strict dependence of yeast endocytosis on actin assembly is proposed to reﬂect the need to overcome turgor pressure in yeast cells [ 11 ] . Initiation of actin patch assembly Elegant work in budding yeast revealed that actin patch components assemble in a strictly ordered fashion [ 7 , 12 , 13 ] . Fission yeast express homologs of virtually all proteins present in budding yeast actin patches , and those that have been investigated assemble into patches with a similar timing as in budding yeast [ 14 , 15 ] . Comparison of endocytic pathways between the two yeast and animal cells is important for identifying general principles [ 5 , 7 ] . Patch assembly starts with recruitment of early patch components that are thought to promote initial membrane invagination , including clathrin , Ede1 , Yap1801 , the epsin Ent1 [ 16 ] , and the F - BAR protein Syp1 ( Figure 2 ) . Thirty to forty clathrin molecules are recruited 1 – 2 minutes before internalization and form a cap at the tip of endocytic invagi - nation [ 15 ] . Approximately one minute after clathrin ap - pearance , patches begin to accumulate the endocytic adaptor proteins Sla1 , End3 , End4 / Sla2 and Pan1 that link early endocytic components to actin assembly . Because End4 and Pan1 are the only endocytic adaptors examined in ﬁssion yeast [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] , dissecting the other components presents a challenge for future research . End4 is essential for endocytic internalization and polarized growth , whereas Pan1 is essential for viability . End4 localizes to patches independently of actin and is likely to use its C - terminal Review Corresponding authors : Kovar , D . R . ( drkovar @ uchicago . edu ) ; Sirotkin , V .

Actin cables : tropomyosin favors myosin - V Myo52 - directed motility on formin For3 - nucleated straight parallel filaments . Contractile rings : lower concentrations of fimbrin allow limited cofilin severing by partially inhibiting tropomyosin . Tropomyosin also favors myosin - II Myo2 - mediated compaction of the formin Cdc12 - nucleated straight antiparallel filaments .

Pan1 contains a WH2 domain expected to bind actin and a CA ( central - acidic ) region expected to bind to Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 complex activation The ability of the Arp2 / 3 complex to drive actin assembly is stimulated by one of the three nucleation promoting fac - tors , Eps15 - like Pan1 , WASp Wsp1 and myosin - I Myo1 , which are thought to have distinct but overlapping func - tions [ 15 , 19 , 20 ] . Consistent with its role as an adaptor , Pan1 arrives more than 20 s before the Arp2 / 3 complex and is not sufﬁcient to drive endocytosis in the absence of Myo1 and Wsp1 [ 15 , 19 ] . As in budding yeast , Myo1 is a weaker Arp2 / 3 complex activator than Wsp1 and lacks the WH2 domain needed to Box 1 . Mating in fission yeast In addition to interphase actin patches and cables , and the mitotic contractile ring , fission yeast also utilizes the actin cytoskeleton for mating . Upon nitrogen starvation , cells of opposite h + and h (cid:2) mating types grow projection tips towards each other by polarizing their actin cytoskeleton in response to diffusible signaling pheromones ( Figure I ) [ 101 ] . Upon contact of their projection tips , localized cell wall degradation allows mating cells to fuse . Dramatic F - actin rearrange - ments occur throughout the polarization and conjugation process [ 101 ] . The actin nucleation and elongation factor formin Fus1 localizes to the projection tip after mating cells contact , and is required for actin filament accumulation / maintenance and for subsequent localized cell wall degradation and cell fusion [ 102 , 103 ] . However , before cell – cell contact the initial accumulation of actin filaments at the tips of polarized mating cells does not require Fus1 [ 102 ] . The organization of individual actin filaments at the mating projection tip and during cell fusion is not known . F - actin and actin - binding proteins localize to structures that resemble actin patches in the mating projection tip [ 101 ] , suggesting that these structures are analogous to interphase actin patches composed primarily of branched actin filaments . Multiple actin regulators in interphase actin patches have also been implicated in mating by localization and / or genetic phenotypes , including fimbrin Fim1 , actin - capping protein Acp1 / 2 , and the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 31 , 63 ] . However , in addition to the formin Fus1 , other proteins that primarily localize to long - straight actin filaments in actin cables and contractile rings are also implicated in mating , including tropomyosin Cdc8 and the type V myosin Myo51 [ 104 , 105 ] . Therefore , a reasonable speculation is that the mating projection tip and subsequent cell fusion require both patch - like and cable - like actin filament structures . Elucidating how actin is as - sembled during mating and its role in cell fusion will require improved visualization of the organization and dynamics of the associated actin filaments , as well as a complete list of the associated actin - binding proteins .

Key in vivo methods Manipulating the genome by gene targeting The efficiency of S . pombe homologous recombination allows gene deletions , truncations , point mutations , inducible promoters , or protein tags to be quickly engineered anywhere in the genome . Precise analysis of phenotypes or protein localization patterns and dynamics dictates the use of endogenous protein levels if one is to avoid artifacts associated with multicopy plasmids or overexpression . However , tagging is not always ideal because bulky tags can sterically interfere with protein function . Genetic , physiological and morpholo - gical tests can be used to determine if the tagged protein is fully functional . A good example here is actin ( Figure Ia ) , where N - or C - terminal GFP tags at the endogenous locus are lethal when tagged actin is expressed as the sole actin source . The reason for the lethality is that GFP – actin incorporates into actin patches assembled by the Arp2 / 3 complex but is unable to incorporate into cables and rings assembled by formins . In this case , expression of the tagged protein at a low level from a construct integrated into a nutritional marker locus , in addition to endogenous unlabeled protein , allows visualiza - tion of actin dynamics in patches . Visualizing actin organization and dynamics in cables and rings requires other approaches such as immunofluorescence , rhodamine – phalloidin labeling or a GFP – calpo - nin - homology - domain fusion protein ( GFP – CHD ) . Quantitative cell biology Actin - based processes in fission yeast rely on strictly controlled assembly of proteins with highly ordered , reproducible timing and dynamics . Careful quantitation of endogenous protein behavior allows one to compare dynamic processes such as the speed of contractile ring constriction in different backgrounds ( Figure Ib ) , where co - localization with a spindle marker allows the timing of constriction to be assessed relative to mitotic progression . Quantita - tive approaches are also used to define the transient co - localization of proteins at endocytic actin patches ( Figure Ic ) , or rapid movement of proteins along cables . Use of FRAP ( fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ) allows further classification based on the ability of a protein to exchange between an actin structure and the cytoplasm . In addition to defining the role of a protein , precise in vivo quantitation has been used to determine protein concentrations and formulate mathematical models [ 15 , 26 , 47 , 87 , 106 ] .

Myo1 activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is stimulated by WIP / verprolin Vrp1 which contains a WH2 domain . However , Vrp1 fails to localize to patches in the absence of Wsp1 and probably functions in patch assembly in a complex with Wsp1 [ 14 ] . Myo1 loca - lizes at the base of the invaginating plasma membrane where it remains upon patch internalization [ 14 ] . Thus , Myo1 could activate Arp2 / 3 complex in a distinct region around endocytic invagination or play other roles in endo - cytosis ( Figure 2 ) . Patch localization and the function of Myo1 depend on F - actin and on ATP - dependent motor activity which is regulated by phosphorylation of the Myo1 motor domain [ 19 , 22 , 23 ] . Patch internalization requires myosin - I motor activity in both budding and ﬁssion yeast [ 21 , 22 ] . Myo1 also plays a role in organization of sterol - rich membrane domains , but how this relates to the role of Myo1 in endocytosis is unclear [ 24 ] . Experiments involving deletion of the domains in Pan1 , myosin - I and WASP that are responsible for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex have suggested that WASP is the primary Arp2 / 3 complex activator driving actin assembly for patch internalization in budding and ﬁssion yeast ( [ 21 , 22 , 25 ] ; V . S . , unpublished data ) . Mathematical modeling indicates that branched actin assembly driven by a wave of active Wsp1 can account for the time course of actin assembly in cells ( Figure 2 ) [ 26 ] , but requires that the rate of binding of the ternary complex of Wsp1 – Arp2 / 3 complex – actin to actin ﬁlaments is 400 times faster in cells than in vitro [ 27 ] . One potential link between membrane deformation and Arp2 / 3 complex activation is provided by BAR and F - BAR proteins which could cooperate with actin to promote membrane invagination and scission via their ability to stabilize or promote membrane tubulation ( Figure 2 ) [ 28 ] . There are four BAR and seven F - BAR proteins annotated in the ﬁssion yeast genome , but not all are involved in endocytosis . The F - BAR protein Cdc15 directly interacts with Myo1 [ 29 ] . The BAR protein amphiphysin Hob1 inhi - bits Wsp1 and depends on Wsp1 for localization to patches [ 30 ] . These interactions could direct Wsp1 and Myo1 activ - ity to speciﬁc locations around the endocytic site , providing a potential feedback mechanism between membrane de - formation and actin assembly . Other proteins , including Lsb1 , Lsb4 , Ldb17 and Bbc1 which interact with WASP or myosin - I in budding yeast , could help to regulate Myo1 and Wsp1 in ﬁssion yeast . Actin patch assembly and disassembly In ﬁssion yeast , Wsp1 and Myo1 arrive to patches 10 s before internalization and within seconds recruit and acti - vate Arp2 / 3 complex , which stimulates a burst of branched actin ﬁlament assembly culminating in patch internaliza - tion [ 14 ] . Mathematical models indicate that at the peak of assembly , patches contain a network of (cid:3) 150 branched ﬁlaments that are 100 – 200 nm in length [ 15 , 26 ] . Filaments are short as a result of rapid capping by capping protein [ 31 , 32 ] . How the actin network is arranged around the endocytic site to promote endocytosis is not clear . With the exception of coronin Crn1 , all actin - binding proteins accumulate in patches with the same timing as Arp2 / 3 complex . At peak , each patch contains 900 ﬁmbrin Fim1 molecules that crosslink or bundle ﬁlaments com - posed of (cid:3) 7000 actin subunits [ 15 ] . Fimbrin could strengthen the actin network around the endocytic invagi - nation , explaining why patch internalization fails in ﬁm1 D cells [ 33 ] . Other actin - binding proteins , including transge - lin Stg1 and drebrin App1 , could help to stabilize the actin network [ 34 ] . The abundance of ﬁmbrin in patches is striking and plays an important role by preventing patch Box 3 . Key in vitro methods Combining in vitro approaches with a genetically tractable system can be particularly insightful . Significant progress has recently been made towards understanding mechanistic details of the fission yeast actin cytoskeleton by utilizing in vitro approaches such as ( Figure Ia ) total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy of individual actin filaments [ 31 – 33 , 35 , 36 , 55 , 107 ] , and ( Figure Ib ) myosin motility assays [ 23 , 56 , 58 , 61 , 108 ] .

In vitro methodology . ( a ) TIRF microscopy allows direct observation of individual filaments assembling from a pool of fluorescently labeled actin monomers near the surface of a slide or coverslip . Whereas traditional ‘bulk’ actin biochemistry techniques such as the Pyrene – actin assembly assay only detect the concentration of polymer , TIRF microscopy provides the filament number , elongation rate at both ends , and filament architecture ( e . g . , bundles , branches , severing ) . For example , the fission yeast cytokinesis formin Cdc12 shown in ( a ) nucleates the assembly of straight actin filaments , and then remains processively associated with the elongating barbed end while dramatically slowing the elongation rate compared to a neighboring control filament without formin [ 107 ] . Moreover , multi - color TIRF microscopy allows simultaneous visualization of more than one component in complex reactions containing several factors that more closely recapitulate in vivo processes . ( b ) In addition to employing bulk actin - activated ATPase assays to measure actin binding and motor activity , utilization of in vitro motility assays is also helpful . Motility assays require relatively small amounts of myosin and allow measurement of actin binding and myosin - driven actin filament gliding rates utilizing epifluoresecence microscopy . The approach can be adapted to estimate motor duty ratios and processivity , and also provides a convenient means to test important parameters including ATP concentration and ionic strength .

Upon patch internalization , the actin network disas - sembles in 10 s to allow vesicle fusion with endosomes and to recycle actin ( Figure 2 ) . Mathematical modeling sug - gests that rapid disassembly requires severing of ﬁlaments into short fragments that diffuse away [ 26 ] . Coﬁlin severs ﬁlaments and dissociates Arp2 / 3 complex - anchored actin branches [ 35 , 36 ] . The yeast coﬁlin homolog Gmf1 also promotes debranching [ 37 , 38 ] . Coronin arrives 5 s later than actin [ 15 ] and , as in budding yeast , could cooperate with coﬁlin and Aip1 in patch disassembly [ 39 – 41 ] . After internalization , patches undergo directed movement that depends on their stochastic association with actin cables and seemingly undirected movement independent of cables [ 42 ] . Contractile ring – cytokinesis Although it is well established that actomyosin rings drive cytokinesis [ 43 – 45 ] , we are only now beginning to under - stand how these complex structures work . The late 1990s saw a revolution in our understanding of cytokinesis with the completion of a number of genetic screens in budding and ﬁssion yeast that identiﬁed the fundamental players [ 46 ] . These proteins include actin , myosin - II , and a host of other cytoskeletal and signaling proteins conserved from yeast to man . With key components in hand , the next challenge lies in understanding their function , regulation , and how they interface with one another and the cell cortex to control ring assembly and constriction . Mechanisms of ring assembly Quantitative analysis of assembling rings and genetic studies have led to the proposal of two independent but complementary mechanisms of ring assembly ( Figure 3 ) . The ﬁrst – ‘search , capture , pull , and release’ ( SCPR ) – is based on the arrival and dynamics of different components at assembling rings ( Figure 3b ) [ 47 , 48 ] . The anillin - like Mid1 ( Dmf1 ) provides the spatial cue for ring placement in this model [ 49 , 50 ] , emerging approximately 1 h before cells enter mitosis as (cid:3) 65 cortical nodes surrounding the nucle - us at mid - cell [ 47 , 51 , 52 ] . Immediately before the onset of mitosis these nodes recruit additional Mid1 from the nu - cleus [ 50 , 53 ] , followed by IQGAP Rng2 , myosin - II Myo2 , F - BAR protein Cdc15 , formin Cdc12 and a - actinin Ain1 [ ( ) TD $ FIG ] Clathrin ( from - 100 s ) Wsp1 - Vrp1 Myo1 Ede1 Ent1Yap1801 Pan1 End3Sla1End4 - 30 sec - 10 sec - 5 sec 0 sec + 3 sec Syp1 Arp2 / 3 Acp1 / 2 Actin Fim1 BAR : Bzz1 , Cdc15 , Hob1 / 3 Bbc1Lsb1 Ldb17Lsb4 ?

Upon entering mitosis , formin Cdc12 nucleates the growth of actin ﬁlaments that associate with tropomyosin Cdc8 and undergo rapid elongation [ 55 ] . These ﬁlaments contact other nodes and their Myo2 motors . Ring compac - tion is driven by repeated cycles of Myo2 - mediated tugging and release by coﬁlin Cof1 - mediated ﬁlament severing [ 33 , 47 , 54 , 56 , 57 ] . Multiple layers of regulation appear to converge on Myo2 . The conserved UCS ( Unc45 - / Cro1p - / She4p - related ) protein Rng3 works with Hsp90 to activate Myo2 upon its recruitment to the division site [ 58 – 60 ] , whereas regulatory light chain phosphorylation and tropo - myosin Cdc8 enhance Myo2 motility , favoring ring com - paction [ 56 , 61 ] . a - Actinin Ain1 is presumably responsible for the crosslinking of actin ﬁlaments into short antiparal - lel bundles [ 62 , 63 ] . The second mechanism of ring assembly ( the ‘leading cable’ model ) functions in conjunction with the SCPR model . Primary evidence for a second mode of ring assem - bly is that cytokinesis and growth are supported in mid1 D cells lacking pre - ring nodes [ 49 , 64 , 65 ] . Ring assembly by the leading cable model relies on the septation initiation network ( SIN ) [ 64 , 65 ] , and this explains why rings can be tricked into assembling in interphase by ectopic activation of the SIN [ 64 – 66 ] . This model stems from the observation that under certain conditions actomyosin cables coalesce into rings following growth from a single spot on the cortex ( Figure 3c ) [ 62 , 67 ] . The SIN is a conserved signal trans - duction pathway that triggers ring constriction and sep - tum formation at the end of anaphase ( Figure 3a ) [ 68 ] . Although SIN activity peaks at the time of ring constric - tion , signiﬁcant activity is still evident earlier in mitosis and ensures that forming rings are compact and homoge - neous [ 64 , 69 ] . In the absence of pre - ring nodes ( mid1 D cells ) rings are misplaced and disorganized , and this often leads to cytokinesis failure [ 49 , 50 ] . However , defects in organization ( but not placement ) can be suppressed by delaying septum formation ( Figure 3 ) . This ﬁnding indi - cates that the assembly defects in the absence of Mid1 / nodes are due to initiation of septation before an organized actomyosin ring has had a chance to form , as opposed to an inherent inability to support ring assembly . Rings fail to assemble in the absence of both Mid1 and SIN function [ 64 ] , highlighting the overlapping roles of the two mechan - isms . Communication between the cell cycle and the ring Two key ring components ( Cdc15 and Myo2 ) are known substrates of the SIN - dependent Cdc14 family phospha - tase ( Clp1 / Flp1 ) [ 70 , 71 ] . Cdc14 phosphatases move from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm where they dephosphory - late cyclin - dependent kinase substrates , and this favors cytokinesis and mitotic exit [ 68 ] . Phosphorylation of Clp1 by the terminal SIN kinase Sid2 promotes its retention in the cytoplasm via an interaction with the 14 - 3 - 3 protein Rad24 [ 72 , 73 ] . When ring integrity is compromised , Clp1 activates a cytokinesis checkpoint , during which Clp1 activity is also utilized to stabilize ring structures [ 74 ] . The N - terminal F - BAR domain of Cdc15 recruits formin Cdc12 during ring assembly and self - assembles into ﬁla - ments that are thought to deform membranes [ 29 , 75 ] . The C - terminal SH3 domain of Cdc15 recruits additional pro - teins that stabilize the ring [ 76 – 78 ] . Consistent with being a downstream target , Cdc15 is dephosphorylated upon SIN activation and relies on the SIN for localization at the ring [ 64 ] . cdc15 mutants also phenocopy SIN mutants in failing to form homogenous rings [ 64 ] . Amazingly , more than 33 different phosphorylation sites have been identiﬁed in the central region of Cdc15 , eleven of which are thought to be Clp1 targets [ 75 ] . Dephosphorylation of this region ( by Clp1 and unidentiﬁed phosphatases ) promotes an open [ ( ) TD $ FIG ] Figure 3 . Mechanisms of contractile ring assembly .

( c ) Schematic summarizing ring assembly from actomyosin cables ( red ) by the SIN - dependent ‘leading cable’ mechanism . The contribution of this mechanism to ring assembly becomes most apparent in a mid1 D cps1 - 191 double mutant when the spatial organization of Mid1 - dependent nodes is removed and septum formation is delayed by the cps1 mutation [ 65 ] . This delay ensures that ring assembly finishes in time to provide a tight spatial landmark for deposition of the septum . A mechanism by which the SIN communicates with the ring is outlined ( inset ) : SIN promotes Clp1 phosphatase activity in the cytoplasm which ( in conjunction with other unidentified phosphatases ) dephosphorylates Cdc15 [ 70 – 73 ] . Dephosphorylation promotes self - assembly , membrane deformation , recruitment of formin Cdc12 [ 29 ] , and associations with paxillin Pxl1 and the C2 - domain - protein Fic1 to promote ring stability [ 78 ] . Review Trends in Cell Biology March 2011 , Vol . 21 , No . 3 182 conformation facilitating self - assembly and association with binding partners ( Figure 3c ) [ 75 ] . Mutagenesis of phosphorylation sites showed that premature dephosphor - ylation favors interphase assembly of Cdc15 and other key components ( e . g . , Rng2 and Myo2 ) at mid - cell . Thus , cell cycle - speciﬁc dephosphorylation of Cdc15 during mitosis appears to drive ring assembly in the leading cable model . Although the Myo2 tail is phosphorylated at S1444 [ 61 , 79 ] , mutagenesis of this site causes only minor defects [ 61 ] . Summary Contractile ring assembly relies on two overlapping path - ways : one built on the spatial organization of ring compo - nents provided by the nodes , the other on signaling from the SIN which promotes the function of Cdc15 . The fact that Mid1 anchors Clp1 at assembled rings suggests direct cooperation between the two pathways may occur during ring assembly [ 70 ] . Nevertheless , many key questions remain . How does Mid1 recruit Myo2 and Rng2 during ring assembly ? How do Cdc15 ﬁlaments impact the cortex ? How is the formin Cdc12 regulated ? The IQGAP Rng2 is a multi - domain actin - binding protein essential for cytokine - sis [ 80 , 81 ] , but how does it work ? What are other key targets of the SIN pathway ? Although we have learned a tremendous amount about ﬁssion yeast cytokinesis in recent years , there are many more questions than answers . Actin cables – polarity Actin cables are the third major actin - ﬁlament - based structure , and these provide polarized tracks for type V myosin - directed delivery of vesicles and organelles to the expanding cell tips ( Figure 4 ) . Actin cables are composed of bundles of short parallel actin ﬁlaments , which are assem - bled by the actin nucleation and elongation factor formin For3 , whose barbed ends are oriented towards the cell cortex ( Figure 4 ) [ 82 – 84 ] . Less is known about the assem - bly , maintenance and disassembly of actin cables com - pared with actin patches and contractile rings . However , genetic , cellular and mathematical modeling studies have provided a working model for For3 - mediated actin cable assembly ( Figure 4 ) [ 85 – 87 ] . Fission yeast actin cables are a wonderful example of cytoskeletal crosstalk because their assembly site is ini - tially established by microtubules [ 88 – 92 ] . The general scheme is that the polarity factor Tea1 – Tea4 complex is transported to the cell tip by microtubule plus ends via a + TIP complex consisting of EB1 Mal3 , CLIP - 170 Tip1 and kinesin Tea2 . Upon deposition at the cell tip through the Mod5 receptor , the Tea1 – Tea4 complex recruits polari - some complex polarity factors including the formin For3 and the For3 activators Rho - GTPase Cdc42 , Bud6 and Pob1 [ 86 , 89 , 93 ] . Establishment of the actin cable assembly site is further complicated by the existence of parallel / overlapping pathways with several positive feedback loops , including signaling through the small Rho - family GTPase Cdc42 [ 88 ] . Upon activation , For3 is believed to initiate rapid pro - cessive actin ﬁlament assembly as do other formins . Tag - ging with three tandem copies of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) revealed that in cells For3 has surprisingly tran - sient dynamics [ 85 ] . For3 remains associated with the cell cortex for only a few seconds before moving inwards by retrograde ﬂow with the elongating actin cable at the same rate as actin assembly [ 85 ] . Therefore For3 could facilitate actin ﬁlament assembly for only a few seconds before becoming partially inactivated – such that it remains associated with the ﬁlament but does not promote further elongation . Partially inactive For3 and its ﬁlament are subsequently carried into the cell interior by actin ﬁlament assembly mediated by other fully activated For3 molecules at the cell tip ( Figure 4 ) . The speciﬁc mechanisms by which For3 is activated , partially inactivated , and fully inacti - vated are not known . Unlike actin patches and the contractile ring , the list of actin ﬁlament binding proteins that localize to actin cables is surprisingly small ( Figure 1c ) .

Interphase cells contain (cid:3) four dynamic microtubules whose plus - ends periodically interact with the cell tip , and deliver polarity factors that direct actin cable assembly [ 92 ] . Actin cables are polarized tracks utilized by myosin - V motors to deliver materials to cell tips [ 99 , 100 ] . Actin cables are bundles of short parallel actin filaments assembled by the formin For3 [ 82 – 84 ] . ( b ) Model for actin cable assembly .

F , Actin cables are disassembled distal to the cell tip by an unknown mechanism , and inactive For3 and actin monomers are subsequently recycled back to the tip . Review Trends in Cell Biology March 2011 , Vol . 21 , No . 3 183 components include the ﬁlament - stabilizing protein tropo - myosin Cdc8 and coronin Crn1 [ 42 ] . Although it is possible that other factors are absent , it is ( i ) more likely that they are present at low concentrations , and ( ii ) the negative impact of their genetic loss / reduction on cables has been difﬁcult to interpret given the notorious difﬁculty of imag - ing actin cables in live cells . One obvious missing compo - nent is an actin ﬁlament crosslinker ( Figures 1c and 4 ) , which is likely to be ﬁmbrin Fim1 , a - actinin Ain1 , or transgelin Stg1 . Furthermore , nothing has been reported about the mechanisms by which actin cables are disas - sembled at the cell interior . Presumably the actin - severing factor coﬁlin Cof1 plays a role , but this has not been established . Determining how Cof1 and other factors dis - assemble old actin ﬁlaments away from the cell tip , but not new actin ﬁlaments near the cell tip , is certain to be a fascinating story that could depend on both spatial and temporal differences of an extending actin cable . Global regulation and self - organization of the ﬁssion yeast actin cytoskeleton Endocytic actin patches , the contractile ring , and polariz - ing actin cables are each tailored for a particular cellular function in part by unique compositions of actin - binding proteins that determine the arrangement and dynamics of their actin ﬁlaments . Actin patches , whose lifetimes are less than 1 min , are composed of short - branched ﬁlaments ( Figure 2 ) . Contractile rings and actin cables , composed of straight ﬁlaments bundled in antiparallel or parallel fash - ion , persist much longer than patches ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . How cells assemble and maintain these functionally di - verse actin ﬁlament structures within the same cytoplasm is a largely unanswered question . Actin ﬁlament organization is partly determined by the nucleation factor . For example , in patches the Arp2 / 3 complex produces branched ﬁlaments with barbed ends oriented towards the membrane where its activators are located ( Figure 2 ) . Similarly , the actin cable formin For3 produces parallel ﬁlaments because For3 is activated exclusively at the cell cortex ( Figure 4 ) . The contractile ring formin Cdc12 produces anti - parallel ﬁlaments in the ‘search , capture , pull and release’ model because it is activated from randomly arranged pre - ring nodes . How - ever , differences in actin nucleation factors alone are not sufﬁcient to produce functionally diverse actin ﬁlament structures . Filaments within patches , cables and rings are bound by partially overlapping sets of biochemically diverse actin - binding proteins that are integral to the establishment , maintenance , and disassembly of the ac - tin ﬁlaments within these structures ( Figure 1c ) . There - fore , a major challenge is to determine how speciﬁc subgroups of actin - binding proteins co - localize to a par - ticular structure and collectively inﬂuence actin ﬁlament organization and dynamics . We hypothesize that by im - printing actin ﬁlaments with particular physical confor - mations [ 94 ] , actin nucleation factors are necessary and sufﬁcient to initiate the recruitment of speciﬁc sets of actin - binding proteins . A hierarchy of actin - binding pro - tein recruitment to actin ﬁlaments subsequently ensues , wherein upstream factors regulate the association of downstream factors . Our recent studies revealed that the actin ﬁlament - bundling protein ﬁmbrin Fim1 and the stabilizing protein tropomyosin Cdc8 are key factors that differentially regu - late actin - binding protein recruitment to actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 1d ) [ 23 , 33 ] . Although both Fim1 and Cdc8 bind with similar sub - micromolar afﬁnity to the side of actin ﬁlaments [ 55 , 81 , 95 ] , their distribution is quite different ( Figure 1c , d ) . Fim1 primarily localizes to actin patches , whereas Cdc8 primarily localizes to actin cables and the contractile ring . We found that Fim1 inhibits Cdc8 binding to actin ﬁlaments , and thereby prevents Cdc8 from associ - ating with actin patches [ 33 ] , and this has important functional consequences ( Figure 1d ) . First , inhibition of Cdc8 by Fim1 ‘deprotects’ actin ﬁlaments from being sev - ered by coﬁlin , allowing rapid ﬁlament turnover in actin patches and limited ﬁlament turnover in the assembling contractile ring [ 33 ] . Second , Fim1 relieves the type - I motor Myo1 from Cdc8 - mediated inhibition , ensuring max - imal Myo1 activity in actin patches [ 23 ] . Therefore , in addition to actin ﬁlament crosslinking , Fim1 is also an actin - binding ‘selector’ protein that promotes the access of other proteins to actin ﬁlaments by inhibiting Cdc8 [ 33 ] . Future work will undoubtedly uncover many other mechanisms that contribute to the self - organization of diverse actin ﬁlament structures within the same cyto - plasm . For example , acetylation of the N - terminal methio - nine of tropomyosin Cdc8 inﬂuences its cellular localization and ability to regulate myosin motors [ 96 ] . Interpretation of actin - binding protein localization and mutant phenotypes Interpreting actin - binding protein localizations and mu - tant phenotypes can be difﬁcult because of the close prox - imity of actin structures to each other , and because actin structures are interconnected by direct interactions and / or indirect feedback mechanisms . For example , there have been several reports that myosin - I Myo1 and Arp2 / 3 com - plex are localized in the contractile ring , and it was pro - posed that patches contribute to ring assembly [ 24 , 29 , 97 ] . In fact , mutations in actin patch components do reduce the speed of ring constriction [ 33 , 48 , 97 ] . However , high - reso - lution images revealed that Arp2 / 3 complex and other patch proteins , except Cdc15 , are present in dynamic patches in close proximity to the ring but never in the ring itself ( Figure 2c ) , suggesting that actin patch mutants cause cytokinesis defects via feedback between endocytosis and ring constriction and do not play a direct role in ring assembly [ 57 ] . Given that actin structures compete for the same actin monomer pool [ 57 ] , it is also possible that disruption of patch components indirectly affects other structures by modifying the amount of available actin monomers . For example , disruption of patch components glia maturation factor - like protein Gmf1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex leads to more abundant cables [ 8 , 38 ] , whereas disruption of the patch component actin - capping protein Acp1 / 2 causes cy - tokinesis and actin cable defects [ 31 ] . Similarly , misloca - lization of proteins upon disruption of other actin - binding proteins needs careful consideration . For example , tropo - myosin accumulates ectopically in actin patches in the absence of ﬁmbrin [ 33 ] . Actin patch abnormalities in the Review Trends in Cell Biology March 2011 , Vol . 21 , No . 3 184 absence of ﬁmbrin had been attributed to the absence of ﬁmbrin - mediated ﬁlament bundling [ 63 , 98 ] . However , re - duction of Cdc8 in ﬁm1 D cells substantially corrects patch abnormalities , suggesting that the ectopic presence of Cdc8 is largely responsible [ 33 ] . It could therefore be necessary to determine how disruption of one actin - binding protein affects the localization of others before mechanisms can be accurately ascribed . Fortunately , utilizing the genetically tractable ﬁssion yeast , where proteins can be tagged and expressed at endogenous levels from their native loci ( Box 2 ) , gives researchers the tools to sort out these com - plicated interactions .
