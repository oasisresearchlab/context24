One idea is that cancer cells are plastic and adopt different mechanical phenotypes under 19 different geometries that aid in their survival . Thus , an attractive goal , is to disrupt the cancer cells’ ability 20 to adopt multiple mechanical states . To begin to address this question , we aimed to quantify the diversity 21 of these mechanical states using in vitro biomimetics to mimic in vivo 2D and 3D extracellular matrix 22 environments . Here , we used two modalities Brillouin microscopy ( ~ GHz ) and broadband frequency ( 3 - 23 15kHz ) optical tweezer microrheology to measure microscale cell mechanics . We measured the response 24 of intracellular mechanics of cancer cells cultured in 2D and 3D environments where we modified substrate 25 stiffness , dimensionality ( 2D versus 3D ) , and presence of fibrillar topography . We determined that there 26 was good agreement between two modalities despite the difference in timescale of the two measurements . 27 These findings on cell mechanical phenotype in different environments confirm a correlation between 28 modalities that employ different mechanisms at different temporal scales ( Hz - kHz vs . GHz ) . We also 29 determined that observed heterogeneity in cell shape that is more closely linked to the cells’ mechanical 30 state . We also determined that individual cells in multicellular spheroids exhibit a lower degree of 31 mechanical heterogeneity when compared to single cells cultured in monodisperse 3D cultures . Moreover , 32 the observed decreased heterogeneity among cells in spheroids suggested that there is mechanical 33 cooperativity between cells that make up a single spheroid . 34 3 Introduction 35 Cancer cells encounter many different biochemical and physical cues within the organ 36 microenvironment . These cues are anisotropic and undergo temporal evolution within the 37 microenvironment milieu [ 1 ] . As part of an intricate feedback mechanism , cancer cells sense environmental 38 cues , which evokes a modulation in cellular behavior , which in turn regulates secretion of extracellular 39 cytokines , alterations in tissue architecture and remodeling of cell mechanics [ 1 , 2 ] . Thus , there is an 40 emergence of distinct microenvironments during cancer progression . Simply , the cues at a stage of 41 transition from normal to malignant may be distinct from those present at stages of invasive growth into 42 surrounding tissues due to the continuous tissue remodeling . [ 2 , 3 ] . Understanding the interplay between 43 dynamic tissue reciprocity and the emergence of heterogeneous cell phenotypes is critical for our 44 understanding of why some cancer cells remain indolent and why some are aggressively invasive . 45 This dynamic reciprocal cross talk may also drive phenotypic changes that might select for clones with 46 enhanced survival , motility , and drug resistance [ 4 - 8 ] . These phenotypes can be classified by genetic , 47 metabolic , and physical traits [ 9 , 10 ] . The latter is often referred to as the mechanical phenotype . The 48 cellular constituents spanning a multiplicity of length scales , enzymatic activity , cell cycle stage collectively 49 regulate the physical phenotype of the cell [ 11 ] . In the last decade , mechanical phenotypes have been 50 posited as critical determinants of cancer progression [ 12 - 18 ] . Specifically , the mechanical phenotype can 51 regulate a cell’s response to external forces such as those encountered during invasion and transit within 52 conduits during circulation [ 19 , 20 ] . Mechanical phenotype also is an important determinant of motility 53 strategies such as amoeboid , mesenchymal and “piston” driven modes of migration that are needed to 54 navigate complex 3D structures [ 21 , 22 ] . Finally , mechanical phenotype also influences the homotypic and 55 heterotypic cell - cell interactions that occur within the tumor and interactions with stromal and immune cells 56 [ 23 , 24 ] . These cellular couplings such as cancer cell - cancer associated fibroblasts , cancer cell - cancer 57 associated macrophages and clusters of cancer cells have all been shown to facilitate tumor outgrowth , 58 escape , invasion , extravasation , and colonization of distant organs [ 25 ] . Our understanding of the 59 4 environmental regulation of these states necessitates technical expertise to resolve mechanical phenotypes 60 in complex environments . 61 The mechanical phenotype can be defined by several metrics such as a viscoelasticity , cell shape , 62 cell deformability and adhesion properties . Of these metrics , single cell viscoelasticity provides a metric to 63 assess the material properties of individual cells . Microrheology is a common metric that is used to quantify 64 material properties [ 26 - 28 ] . These material properties are defined by combinatorial contributions due to 65 cellular components that show energy dissipation and elastic properties . Novel tools such as atomic force 66 microscopy , optical tweezers , magnetic twisting cytometry and micropipette aspiration have been utilized 67 for characterization of cellular material properties [ 10 , 29 , 30 ] . However , it remains technically difficult to 68 assess cells in complex environments with microscale resolution . To address this technical need , we 69 methodically probed the single cell mechanics for a range of in vitro assays as a function of dimension , 70 anisotropy and multicellular organization using two optical based techniques that can access the mechanical 71 properties of cells in complex 3D environments . We employed Brillouin microscopy [ 31 , 32 ] which is 72 sensitive to material properties at the GHz timescale and broadband frequency multiplexed optical tweezer 73 microrheology ( 3 - 15kHz ) [ 33 , 34 ] . These techniques allowed us to probe microscale mechanical properties 74 and serve as a platform for comparative studies at the same length scale , in different frequency regimes . 75 Materials and Methods 76 Cell culture 77 Human glioblastoma cells - U87 ( ATCC® HTB­14™ ) were obtained from ATCC , MCF10CA1h cells 78 [ 35 ] were received from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute ( Detroit , MI , USA ) , and they were 79 cultured as previously described . Briefly , the U87 cells were cultured in DMEM – Dulbecco’s Modified 80 Eagle Medium ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 11995065 ) that was supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum 81 ( FBS ) ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 11995065 ) and 50 U / mL penicillin and 50 µg / ml streptomycin ( Thermo 82 5 Fisher , 15070 - 063 ) . MCF10CA1h cells were cultured in the complete medium : DMEM / F12 ( 11330 - 032 , 83 Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 5 % horse serum ( 16050 - 122 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 5 ng / ml EGF ( AF - 100 - 84 15 - 1MG , Peprotech ) , 0 . 5 mg / ml Hydrocortisone ( H0888 - 1G , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 100 ng / ml Cholera toxin 85 ( C8052 - 2mg , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 µg / ml insulin ( I1882 - 100MG , Sigma - Aldrich ) and 1x 86 penicillin / streptomycin solution ( 15070 - 063 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Cells were cultured at 37˚C , in 5 % 87 CO 2 . Cell propagation was performed by detaching adherent cells using Trypsin ( 0 . 25 % for U87 cells 88 ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 80 - 2101 ) and 0 . 05 % for MCF10CA1h cells ( 25 - 052 - Cl , Corning ) ) as previously 89 described . All experiments were performed using cells with passage number less than 19 . Cell medium was 90 changed every 2 - 3 days . 91 Preparation of polyacrylamide substrates 92 Polyacrylamide gels of varying stiffness were fabricated using previously reported protocols [ 36 ] . 93 Briefly , 35mm glass bottom dishes ( Ibidi , 81158 ) were incubated with 0 . 1 M sodium hydroxide ( Sigma - 94 Aldrich , 72068 ) . Then , 200 µl APTMS was added to the dishes for 3 min ( Sigma - Aldrich , 281778 ) , 95 followed by 400 µl of 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 30 min ( Sigma - Aldrich , G6257 ) to ensure polyacrylamide 96 attachment to the treated glass . The stiffness of polyacrylamide gels can be altered by tuning the relative 97 ratios of acrylamide to bis - acrylamide . First , a mixture of 40 % acrylamide ( Sigma - Aldrich , A4058 - 100ml ) , 98 2 % bis - acrylamide ( Sigma - Aldrich M1533 - 25ml ) , phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( ThermoFisher 99 Scientific , 14190 - 144 ) , TEMED ( Sigma - Aldrich , T7024 - 25ml ) , and 10 % w / v ammonium persulfate 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich , 215589 ) were thoroughly mixed . In these experiments , we fabricated gels that 101 corresponded to a shear modulus ( G’ ) of 0 . 1 kPa ( soft gels ) and 32 kPa ( stiff gels ) . For soft gels , the final 102 concentrations were 5 % acrylamide , and 0 . 04 % bis - acrylamide . For stiff gels , the final solution contained 103 18 % acrylamide , and 0 . 4 % bis - acrylamide . In each case , a total volume of 500 µl was prepared . 30 µl of 104 the gel solution was added to the pre - treated 35mm glass bottom dish and covered with a round coverslip 105 18 mm round coverslips ( # 1 , thickness ) to create a circular gel . This coverslip was pre - treated with RainX 106 ( Illinois Tool Works ) for 5 minutes to make them less adhesive to the polyacrylamide gels . After 15 min , 107 6 2 ml of PBS was added to the dish . After an additional 15 min , the glass coverslip was gently dislodged 108 using tweezers , leaving a polyacrylamide gel ~ 100 µm in thickness . 109 Cells do not attach to biologically inert polyacrylamide and require coating the gel surface with an 110 extracellular matrix protein to promote attachment . First , the polyacrylamide gels were treated with 0 . 25 111 mg / ml Sulfo - SANPAH ( ThermoFisher ) in 50 mM HEPES ( ThermoFisher ) . They were coated with 200 µl 112 of the sulfo - SANPAH solution and placed under the UV lamp ( UVP , Blak - Ray B100AP , 100W , 365nm ) 113 for 6 min . This step was repeated twice . The gels were then gently washed with 50 mM HEPES buffer 114 twice and covered with a solution of fibronectin ( Milipore Sigma FN010 ) - 10 µg / ml in HEPES for 12 115 hours at 4˚C . Afterwards the gels were washed twice with PBS . Next , 2 ml solution of 50 , 000 cells in the 116 serum free medium was added to the gels . Gels were then placed in the incubator overnight to facilitate cell 117 attachment . 118 Preparation of cells on 2D and in 3D culture 119 Cells cultured on top ( 2D ) and embedded in 3D laminin rich extracellular matrix were prepared as 120 previously described [ 37 ] . Briefly , we coated the bottom of a chilled 4 well µ - Slide ( Ibidi , 80427 ) with 100 121 µl of ice - cold Matrigel ( Corning , 356231 , lot 8232015 ) . The slide was then incubated at 37˚C for 5 minutes 122 for the Matrigel layer to solidify . For seeding cells in 2D , 50 , 000 cells were added directly to the well in 123 500 µl of serum free medium . For seeding cells in 3D , 430 µl Matrigel was mixed on ice with 50 µl of 2 × 124 10 6 cells / ml solution of cells ( 10 5 cells total ) in serum free medium , and 12 µl of serum free cell medium . 125 The mixture was added on top of the previously gelled layer of Matrigel and incubated at 37˚C for 30 126 minutes for complete gelation . After 30 minutes , 350 µl of serum free medium was added each well . Cells 127 were used imaged the following day . 128 Preparation of fibrillar topography ( FT ) in 3D culture 129 Aligned magnetic self - assembled fibrillar matrices were fabricated using a previously reported protocol 130 [ 37 - 39 ] . First , human fibronectin ( Milipore Sigma , FN010 ) was fluorescently labelled using the DyLight™ 131 7 488 Microscale Labeling Kit ( Thermo Scientific , 53024 ) according to the supplier protocol . Concentration 132 of the fluorescently labeled protein was measured using a spectrophotometer ( Nanodrop 2000c ) and kept 133 for up to 4 weeks at 4˚C . Fluorescently labelled human fibronectin was conjugated to the carboxylated 134 magnetic polystyrene beads ( Ademtech Carboxy - Adembeads Coupling Kit , 02820 ) according to the 135 manufacturer protocol . Magnetic beads , 300 nm diameter were washed three times in the activation buffer . 136 The beads were resuspended at the concentration of 0 . 5mg / 100µl . Activation of the beads was achieved by 137 incubation in a 2 mg / ml solution of EDC at room temperature for one hour . Then , 20 µg of fluorescently 138 labelled protein was added to 100 µl of the activated beads and incubated at room temperature overnight 139 under gentle shaking . The next day , the conjugated beads were washed three times with storage buffer and 140 kept at 4˚C for up to 1 week at concentration of 10 mg / ml . 141 The fibrillar topography in 3D ( FT ) sample was prepared similarly to the 3D Matrigel encapsulation of 142 cells as described above . 430 µl of ice - cold Matrigel was mixed with 12 µl of FN - conjugated beads ( 10 143 mg / ml ) , and 50 µl of the cell solution ( total 10 5 cells in serum free medium ) and added to the well of the 4 - 144 well Ibidi slide that had a layer of 100 µl of Matrigel previously polymerized on the bottom . To induce 145 alignment , the slide was then placed on ice - cold magnet ( KJ Magnetics , BX8X8X8 - N52 ) for 15 minutes . 146 After 15 minutes , the beads assemble in a fibrillar topography . Sample was then immediately placed in the 147 incubator at 37˚C for 30 minutes for Matrigel to solidify . Afterwards 350 µl of serum free medium was 148 added to the well . A control sample ( FT control ) was prepared in the same way , but incubated on ice for 15 149 minutes , in a separate ice bucket . The FN - conjugated magnetic beads were uniformly dispersed through the 150 3D gel for the FT control sample . 151 Sample preparation for optical tweezer experiments 152 Cells were detached from the culture flask using 10mM EDTA solution . Cells were resuspended in 153 fresh medium at concentration of 1 . 5 ×10 6 cells / ml . Cells were then mixed with a solution of polystyrene 154 beads ( 1 µm diameter , 2 % solids , Invitrogen , F8816 ) in proportion of 100 µl beads / 500µl cell solution , and 155 incubated at 37˚C , 5 % CO 2 for 30 minutes with gentle mixing for 30 - 45 min at 37ºC . This step resulted in 156 8 internalization of beads by the cell through the process of phagocytosis . The cells were then centrifuged at 157 150g for 5 min ( same as during cell passaging ) and resuspended in PBS to remove excess beads . They were 158 centrifuged and resuspended once more to obtain the needed concentration ( 2 × 10 6 cells / ml ) in the serum 159 free medium . This suspension of cells with internalized beads was then used for preparing the 2D and 3D 160 culture samples as described above . 161 Spheroid morphogenesis assay in 3D on - top Matrigel culture 162 We followed established protocols to grow tumor - like spheroids of MCF10CA1h cells [ 40 , 41 ] . Briefly , 163 to create spheroids from cells seeded in the on - top configuration of , first 200 µl of ice - cold Matrigel 164 ( Corning , 356231 ) was added to a chilled 2 - well imaging slide ( Ibidi , 80287 ) . Matrigel was spread evenly 165 on the bottom of the glass using the pipette tip . The imaging slide was placed in the incubator for 30 min 166 for the Matrigel layer to solidify . Cells were detached from the T25 flask as described above and suspended 167 in fresh assay medium . Assay medium is the low - serum version of the complete medium : containing only 168 2 % horse serum , while all the other ingredients are the same . Cells in suspension were mixed thoroughly 169 with a pipette to ensure single cell suspension . Cell concentration was estimated using a hemocytometer , 170 and 20 , 000 cells were added to the 500 µl of fresh assay medium . This cell solution was slowly and evenly 171 pipetted into the 2 - well on top of the solid Matrigel bed . The imaging slide was placed in the incubator for 172 30 min during which the cells settled on top of the Matrigel layer . Next , another 500 µl of assay medium 173 containing 10 % of Matrigel was added on top to create final concentration of 5 % Matrigel in the well . Cells 174 form in colonies over several days . Every 2 days the medium in the well was carefully aspirated and 175 replaced with fresh 5 % Matrigel containing assay medium . 176 Brillouin Microscopy 177 Brillouin microscopy is a spectroscopic technique that measures the inelastic scattering of light from 178 thermal density fluctuations inside the material ( spontaneous Brillouin scattering ) [ 31 , 42 , 43 ] . The 179 scattered light undergoes a characteristic frequency shift when it scatters from these thermal phonons , and 180 9 this frequency shift depends on the index of refraction n , mass density ρ and the longitudinal elastic modulus 181 𝑀 ′ of the probed material : 182 𝜈 𝐵 = 2𝑛 𝜆 √ 𝑀 ′ 𝜌 sin ( 𝜃 2 ) , 183 where 𝜈 𝐵 is the measured Brillouin shift , and θ is the scattering angle an experimental constant ( 180° in our 184 experimental setup ) . Longitudinal modulus M’ is the elastic constant defined as the constant that relates the 185 uniaxial stress and uniaxial strain during compression . Therefore , Brillouin shift is an all - optical and high 186 resolution measurement of local mechanical properties of a given material [ 31 ] . Following the current 187 practice , in this study we report the value of Brillouin shift in GHz as a proxy measurement of the 188 mechanical properties of live cells , with the assumption that the 𝑛 √𝜌 factor does not vary significantly in 189 biological materials [ 44 - 46 ] . 190 Brillouin imaging . Brillouin microscopy of cells was performed as described before [ 32 , 44 ] . We used 191 60x , 0 . 7 NA objective ( Olympus LUCPLFLN60X ) to illuminate the sample with a light from a 660 nm 192 laser ( 20 - 30 mW ) . The backscattered light was coupled into a single mode fiber and analyzed using the two 193 VIPA cross - axis spectrometer with additional spectral purification elements ( apodization and coronography 194 [ 32 ] ) . Each pixel in Brillouin images comes from one acquired Brillouin spectrum ( Figure 1 A ) . In the 195 VIPA spectrometer the frequencies of the light are separated in space and imaged on a high sensitivity 196 EMCCD camera ( Andor iXon 897 ) . Stray light from elastic scattering was blocked using adjustable slits in 197 the spectrometer . Region that contains anti - Stokes Brillouin scattering peak and Stokes peak of the next 198 diffraction order was collected . 5 pixels were averaged in the direction perpendicular to the spectral 199 dispersion axis to obtain the intensity vs . frequency ( in pixels ) graph that contains the two Brillouin peaks 200 ( Anti - Stokes and Stokes of next diffraction order ) . Each of the two peaks was fitted with a Lorentzian 201 function in a custom MATLAB program using nonlinear least squares fitting to localize peak centers . The 202 distance between two peaks was calculated and used in further analysis to remove effects of laser frequency 203 drift throughout the experiment . To calibrate the spectrometer , we measured the average of 500 Brillouin 204 10 spectra of water and methanol collected with exposure time of 10 ms . By using the known literature values 205 of Brillouin shift of water and methanol the spectral dispersion parameter ( GHz per pixel ) and the effective 206 free spectral range ( FSR ) of the spectrometer were calculated . Calibration was performed at least once and 207 hour and after each experimental condition . Exposure time ( pixel dwell time ) used in cell imaging was in 208 the range 20 and 50 ms , depending on the imaging depth . Typically , each measurement has shift precision 209 of approximately 8 MHz ( 0 . 13 % ) . Samples were placed on a 3D motorized stage and scanned across the 210 stationary laser focus . For each imaged cell , we mapped Brillouin shift in a single horizontal or vertical 211 plane passing through the middle of the cell . 212 Brillouin image analysis protocol . The culture media and Matrigel show a lower shift than cells . We 213 identified the cell in Brillouin maps by separating it from the shift of the culture media . We did this by 214 manually selecting a set of pixels containing the surrounding medium and keeping only pixels that at least 215 3 standard deviations larger than the average value of Brillouin shift of the medium . However , for 216 conditions where cells are cultured on polyacrylamide gels and in gels with fibronectin coated nanoparticle 217 fibrils , the boundary between the cell and the polyacrylamide gels or fibrils was manually selected in the 218 Brillouin shift maps using the imfreehand function in MATLAB . In these cases , a vertical slice is always 219 mapped through the cell , to differentiate the gel and the fibrils in the Brillouin images . Cells cultured on 220 top of polyacrylamide gels were imaged inside a microscope stage incubation chamber at 37˚C , 5 % CO 2 . 221 The rest of the cells were imaged at room temperature conditions . Measurement of each sample was done 222 within 1 hour of taking the cells out of the incubator . 223 In the case of measuring suspended cells , we added suspended cells to the glass bottom imaging dish 224 immediately after harvesting from a T25 flask . We allowed 2 - 3 minutes for the cells to settle down on the 225 glass bottom of the imaging dish . We then imaged large horizontal regions ( ~ 150 µm by 150 µm ) that 226 include many cells . All measurements were performed within 20 min of adding cells to the dish , before cell 227 attachment occurs [ 47 ] . We confirmed that within this time cell height does not change significantly by 228 imaging vertical xz Brillouin shift slices through cells . To speed up the imaging process we also sampled 229 11 the images with a larger 2 µm step size . Cells were identified in these Brillouin shift images by thresholding 230 at a fixed threshold of 6 . 15 GHz ( approximately > 3σ from the value of Brillouin shift of the medium ) . 231 Images were further transformed using watershed transform to separate cells from the background and to 232 split isolated objects into individual cells ( Figure 4 . A ) . This automated image processing allowed a higher 233 throughput measurement with around 60 suspended cells per dish . 234 In the case of Brillouin imaging of spheroids , one horizontal slice was mapped approximately through 235 the middle of the spheroid . Individual cell masks were manually selected in each Brillouin image ( Figure 4 236 D ) in MATLAB . Centroid of each selected cell region was recorded , as well as the average Brillouin shift 237 in that region . We quantified the mechanical variability of cells within a spheroid as a standard deviation 238 of the Brillouin shifts of all selected cell within a spheroid . For each spheroid measured , we also calculated 239 the Brillouin shift difference between each pair of cells . To create the plot in Figure 4 F , we plotted those 240 differences as a function of the distance between cell centroid locations in the Brillouin images . 241 Optical Tweezer based active microrheology 242 Optical tweezer experiments were performed on the experimental setup as described previously [ 33 , 243 34 ] . Briefly , the experimental setup consists of a detection part ( detection laser 975 nm and quadrant 244 photodetector QPD ) , and trapping part ( trapping laser 1064 nm , 100 mW power ; 2D acousto - optic deflector 245 ( AOD ) ; piezoelectric translation stage ) . 246 Sample Measurement . The condenser of the microscope was placed in the Kohler illumination and the 247 sample was put in focus . The bead of interest is positioned precisely in the center of the optical trap . This 248 is achieved by optically scanning across the bead in 3 directions ( x , y , and z ) using a piezo XYZ nano - 249 positioning stage ( Prior , 77011201 ) and recording the voltages on the detection path QPD . Specific relation , 250 between voltage and nm - position β was measured in situ by fitting the central linear region of the detector 251 response to bead position . This allows for precise localization of the bead during trap oscillation , as 252 previously described [ 49 ] . To perform active microrheology measurements on the correctly positioned 253 12 bead , the trap beam is oscillated while recording both the optical trap QPD signal ( force ) and the detection 254 QPD signal ( position ) . The oscillation of the trap beam is multiplexed as a superposition of sine waves of 255 differing phase and frequency with the same amplitude ( 25 . 4 nm ) . Twenty frequencies are deliberately 256 chosen as co - prime numbers in the range of 3Hz - 15kHz , to avoid interference and to allow for multiplexed 257 measurement at each frequency . The waveform is pulsed for 2 s , followed by 2s with the trap stationary . 258 and the sequence is repeated 7 times . Before collecting the active microrheology measurement a 10 second 259 passive bead spectrum is recorded . Instrument control and data acquisition are performed using custom 260 programs ( National Instruments , LabVIEW ) . 261 Estimation of the local complex shear elastic modulus . Before measuring the viscoelastic constant at 262 the location of each bead , the optical trap stiffness is calibrated in situ based on the combination of the 263 passive and active power spectra of the bead position [ 50 , 51 ] . Viscoelastic response of the material in the 264 linear regime at the bead location is modeled by a generalized Langevin equation with additional terms : a 265 harmonic term for the applied optical trap force and memory terms for viscoelastic friction 𝛾 1 , 𝑈 and 266 hydrodynamic memory effects 𝛾 2 , 𝑈 [ 51 - 54 ] . The equation of motion of an undriven bead is given by 267 𝑚𝑥̈ 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐹 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑘𝑥 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) − ∫ 𝛾 1 , 𝑈 ( 𝜏 ) 𝑥̇ 𝑈 ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑𝜏 − ∫ 𝛾 2 , 𝑈 ( 𝜏 ) 𝑥̈ 𝑈 ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑𝜏 ∞ 0 ∞ 0 , 268 where , 𝑥 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑥̇ 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) , and 𝑥̈ 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) are the undriven bead position , velocity , and acceleration respectively ; t is 269 time , τ is correlation time , F random ( t ) is the Langevin noise term , k is the stiffness of the optical trap , m is the 270 mass of the trapped bead , and γ 1 , U ( τ ) and γ 2 , U ( τ ) are the time - dependent memory functions representing 271 friction and hydrodynamic memory effects respectively . The equation of motion for a bead driven by 272 moving the position 𝑥 𝐿 ( 𝑡 ) of the laser is given by : 273 𝑚𝑥̈ 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐹 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑘 ( 𝑥 𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑥 𝐿 ( 𝑡 ) ) − ∫ 𝛾 1 , 𝐷 ( 𝜏 ) 𝑥̇ 𝐷 ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑𝜏 − ∫ 𝛾 2 , 𝐷 ( 𝜏 ) 𝑥̈ 𝐷 ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) 𝑑𝜏 ∞ 0 ∞ 0 274 where 𝑥 𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑥̇ 𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) , and 𝑥̈ 𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) the driven bead position , velocity , and acceleration respectively ; and 275 γ 1 , D ( τ ) and γ 2 , D ( τ ) are the time - dependent memory functions representing friction and hydrodynamic 276 13 memory effects respectively in the driven case . Onsager’s regression hypothesis which is a consequence of 277 the fluctuation - dissipation theorem allows us to assume that the friction relaxation spectrum is equal in the 278 driven and undriven system γ 1 , U ( τ ) = γ 1 , D ( τ ) and γ 2 , U ( τ ) = γ 2 , D ( τ ) [ 50 - 54 ] . This is valid in the case when the 279 driven motion of the bead is on the same scale as the passive motion of the bead due to the Brownian 280 motion . The spectrum of the actively driven bead is defined as 𝑅 𝐿 ( 𝜔 ) ≡ 𝑥̃ 𝑑𝑟 ( 𝜔 ) −𝑖𝜔𝑥̃ 𝐿 ( 𝜔 ) , where 𝑥̃ 𝑑𝑟 ( 𝜔 ) and 281 𝑥̃ 𝐿 ( 𝜔 ) are the Fourier transforms of the positions as a function of time of the trapped bead and the trapping 282 laser , respectively , that are recorded while the trap is oscillating . The active driven spectrum 𝑅 𝐿 ( 𝜔 ) can be 283 used to estimate the friction relaxation function 𝛾 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) ≡ 𝛾̃ 1 , 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) + 𝑖𝜔𝛾̃ 2 , 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) according to the following 284 equation 285 𝛾𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) + 𝑖𝜔𝑚 = 𝑘 𝑖𝜔 ( 1 𝑖𝜔𝑅 𝐿 ( 𝜔 ) + 1 ) 286 where ω is the trap oscillation frequency in rad / s , and ~ indicates Fourier transform . The optical trap 287 stiffness can be determined from the real part of the active power spectrum and the passive power spectrum 288 and is given by 𝑘 = 𝑅𝑒 { 𝑅 𝐿 ( 𝜔 ) } 𝑃 𝑈 ( 𝜔 ) , where 𝑃 𝑈 ( 𝜔 ) = 〈 | 𝑥 𝑈 ( 𝜔 ) | 2 〉 , and 𝑥̃ 𝑈 ( 𝜔 ) is the Fourier transform of the 289 position of the of the undriven bead’s as a function of time while the trapping laser is stationary . The friction 290 relaxation spectrum 𝛾 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) is related to the complex viscoelastic modulus of the surrounding 291 microenvironemnt by the generalized Stokes - Einstein relation 𝐺 ∗ ( 𝜔 ) = 𝑖𝜔𝛾 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) 6𝜋𝑎 , where m is bead mass , 292 and a is the hydrodynamic radius of the bead . The complex viscoelastic modulus can be written as 293 𝐺 ∗ ( 𝜔 ) = | 𝐺 ∗ | 𝑒 𝑖𝛿 = 𝐺’ + 𝑖𝐺” 294 where | G * | = ( G’ 2 + G” 2 ) 1 / 2 is the magnitude and δ is the loss tangent tan ( δ ) = G” / G’ and they encode 295 rigidity and hysteresivity , respectively . The real part G’ represents the storage ( elastic ) modulus and the 296 imaginary part G” represents the loss ( viscous ) modulus . 297 14 Data analysis and statistics . For each cell analyzed , 3 - 5 beads were measured at different locations 298 within the cell . Only cells exceeding ~ 30 µm from the coverslip were analyzed in accordance with Faxen’s 299 law . Between 7 and 10 cells were analyzed per sample in each experiment , and three independent 300 experiments were performed ( for 3 independent samples fabricated across different days and across 301 different cell passage numbers ) . Data were analyzed using custom MATLAB and GraphPad Prism 302 programs . 303 The measurements of the modulus magnitudes | G * ( ω ) | , G’ , and G” for each single bead are distributed 304 according to the log - normal distribution . The mean value of these magnitudes from the repeated 305 measurements on the same bead are calculated using the maximum - likelihood estimate for the mean of the 306 log - normal distribution [ 33 ] . 307 µ = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [ 1 𝑛 ∑ ln ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) + 1 2 [ 1 𝑛−1 ∑ | ln ( 𝑥 𝑗 ) − 1 𝑛 ∑ ln ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑛𝑖 = 1 | 2 𝑛𝑗 = 1 ] 𝑛𝑖 = 1 ] , 308 The maximum - likelihood estimate of the log - transformed variance is given by 309 𝜎 2 = µ 2 [ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [ 1 𝑛−1 ∑ | ln ( 𝑥 𝑗 ) − 1 𝑛 ∑ ln ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑛𝑖 = 1 | 2 𝑛𝑗 = 1 ] ] . 310 In case of the loss tangent which is normally distributed we use arithmetic mean and standard deviation as 311 estimates of central tendency and dispersion among measurements . 312 We assume beads measurements within each cell and cells within the cell population are normally 313 distributed . Active microrheology data are presented as mean complex , storage , or loss moduli vs frequency 314 from 7 Hz to 15 kHz of all beads in a single cell . Average values of the G’ and G’’ for all cells in one dish 315 ( one experiment ) were collected from three independent experiments . These ( n = 3 ) values were compared 316 across all frequencies and presence of statistically detectable differences was analyzed with a two - way 317 ANOVA test with Tukey’s post hoc correction . 318 15 Cell shape analysis 319 Brightfield images of each cell sampled by Brillouin microscope was used to identify cell shape . Cell 320 shape was detected using a custom - built MATLAB semi - automatic cell detection GUI program . Each 321 image intensity was normalized and images were sent through an edge detection protocol [ 48 ] that created 322 a binary gradient mask based on the Sobel algorithm . This binary image was dilated to connect edges , holes 323 were filled , and the binary image was eroded ( to undo the dilation while preserving the large objects – 324 cells ) . Each detected preliminary cell shape was inspected and manually edited to select the correct cell 325 region in the field of view using MATLAB’s imfreehand function . The edge detection protocol depends on 326 the contrast of the brightfield images , and it is not always perfectly accurate , especially when there are 327 multiple objects in the image in addition to the cell – e . g . , aligned fibrils . For this reason , we manually 328 inspected and corrected each image . Binary images of cells were analyzed in MATLAB to extract the 329 relevant shape parameters : area , major and minor axis of fitted ellipse , and perimeter . We quantified the 330 aspect ratio as the ratio of minor to major axis of the fitted ellipse , and circularity as perimeter 2 / ( 4π × 331 area ) . 332 Results 333 Brillouin shift correlates with modulation of cell mechanics in cells cultured on 2D substrates 334 The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be a key regulator of the mechanical properties of cells . We 335 first assessed the Brillouin shift of cancer cells cultured in 2D in the presence and absence of a cytochalasin 336 D , pharmacological inhibitor of actin [ 44 , 55 - 58 ] . We determined that the average Brillouin shift of cancer 337 cells decreases by 30 MHz ( Fig . 1 A , C ) when treated with 1 µM cytochalasin D for 30 min . Cells can 338 modulate their internal mechanical properties , morphology , and organization of the cytoskeleton in 339 response to substrate stiffness [ 59 - 61 ] . We next asked if there are differences in Brillouin shifts for cells 340 cultured on different substrate stiffnesses . We determined that there is a distinct difference in Brillouin shift 341 16 for cells grown on soft versus stiff substrates . Cells cultured on hard ( 32 kPa ) polyacrylamide gels adopted 342 Brillouin shift 75 MHz higher than cells cultured on soft polyacrylamide gels ( 0 . 1 kPa ) . We calculated the 343 average Brillouin shift of a whole cell ( gray points in Figure 1 D and E ) and used those to estimate the mean 344 Brillouin shift of cells in each condition ( color points in Figure 1 D and E , one for each independent 345 experiment ) . 346 347 Figure 1 . ( A ) Schematic of the experimental setup . Cells are prepared in an in vitro 348 microenvironment ( 2D or 3D ) . Cells are illuminated with a 660 nm laser , and backscattered 349 light from the confocal volume is analyzed using the VIPA Brillouin spectrometer . For 350 each pixel of the image , the spectrum is analyzed , and Brillouin frequency shift is recorded . 351 ( B ) Brillouin shift maps and brightfield images of live U87 cells : control and treated with 352 cytochalasin D .

( C ) Average Brillouin shift of cells treated with cytochalasin 357 D ( red ) with respect to the control ( blue ) in three independent experiments .

( D ) Average Brillouin shift of cells cultured on top of polyacrylamide gels 360 of different stiffness in the same plot as in ( C ) . Unpaired t - test was performed on the 361 average values of independent experiments . 362 Cells cultured on top of hydrogels and embedded in hydrogel share similar mechanical 363 phenotype 364 The effects of substrates with different properties ( e . g . stiffness or ligand density [ 62 ] ) on cell have 365 been extensively studied . However , the effects of distance and boundary conditions on cells’ ability to sense 366 a physical cue such as substrate stiffness is less understood . Specifically , if a cell is plated on top of a soft 367 flat hydrogel ( ~ 100 Pa ) of a given thickness on a glass dish surface ( > GPa ) , do cells behave comparably to 368 a boundary condition where the soft substrate is infinite and isotropic in every direction ? In other words , 369 what is the boundary condition that governs mechanical phenotype of cells . We take advantage of the ability 370 of Brillouin microscopy to non - invasively map mechanical properties of cells in 3D to address this question . 371 We measured live cells embedded in 3D laminin rich hydrogel ( Matrigel ) and compared them to the cells 372 grown on top of a flat hydrogel of the same composition . Cell morphological analysis using brightfield 373 images revealed a diversity of shapes where some cancer cells in 3D were spherical and some adopted 374 elongated shapes . Comparative analysis for cells grown on a 2D laminin rich ECM hydrogel show the 375 characteristic elongated and flat morphology . Even though cells respond differently to 3D and 2D 376 configurations , we consistently find no difference in Brillouin shift of cells in these two conditions . 377 18 378 Figure 2 . ( A ) Illustration of the two geometries in which we cultured U87 cells : on top of 379 bulk Matrigel – 2D , and inside bulk Matrigel – 3D .

The white 381 rectangles indicate the location of the x - y confocal slices in which Brillouin shift was 382 mapped . ( C ) Brillouin shift of cells grown in 2D vs 3D conditions . Unpaired t - test was 383 performed on the average values of independent experiments ( color points ) . ( D ) Example 384 brightfield images of U87 cells with internalized 1 µm diameter polystyrene beads used in 385 the optical trap measurements in 2D and 3D .

( F ) Viscous component ( G’’ ) of the shear modulus measured by 389 19 the optical trap as a function of frequency ranging from 9 Hz to 15 kHz of cells in 3D ( blue ) 390 and 2D ( red ) . ( G ) Example shear modulus ( G’ ) and loss modulus ( G’’ ) at a single frequency 391 denoted by arrows in ( D ) and ( F ) . Each gray point is average of all the beads probed inside 392 a single cell . Each color point is the average of an independent experiment . Two - way 393 ANOVA was used to compare the 2D and 3D the average values for G’ and G’’ across 394 three independent experiments and all frequencies . ( H ) Illustration of the fibrillar 395 topography experiment in which we cultured U87 cells in presence of the fibrillar 396 topography ( FT ) and in presence of homogeneously dispersed fibronectin coated magnetic 397 beads ( FT control ) . ( I ) Brillouin shift of cells grown in FT and FT control conditions . 398 Unpaired t - test was performed on the average values of independent experiments ( color 399 points ) . 400 To independently investigate the mechanics of cells in these two configurations , we performed the same 401 experiments using high - frequency optical tweezer microrheology . This technique can probe complex elastic 402 modulus of live cells directly in three dimensions by actively driving 1 µm beads embedded in the cell 403 cytoplasm across frequencies ranging from 7 Hz to 15 kHz [ 33 , 34 ] . ( See Materials and Methods . ) We again 404 determined that the complex elastic modulus of cells cultured in in 3D and 2D configurations were 405 comparable across all measured frequencies . The measured shear modulus at 19 Hz was G’ ( 3D ) = 39±11 Pa , 406 and loss modulus G’’ ( 3D ) = 25±7 Pa . 407 Fibrillar structures are present in vivo and alter cancer cell migration [ 63 ] . Cells can sense the fibrillar 408 topography in their environment independently of the adhesion ligands that the fibrils present to the cell 409 [ 37 ] . Using Brillouin microscopy , we set out to investigate whether cells also alter their mechanics in the 410 presence of the fibrillar topography in 3D . Here , we used a model previously developed in our lab to 411 fabricate fibrillar architecture in 3D [ 37 - 39 ] . We used magnetic nanoparticles coated with human 412 fibronectin that in presence of magnetic field align into 1 - 2 µm thick fibrils that are embedded in the 3D 413 hydrogel ( Matrigel ) together with cells . We previously determined that the overall mechanical and diffusive 414 20 properties of the hydrogel were not altered due to the presence of the aligned particles . Instead , the presence 415 or absence of cell protrusions were dictated by the aligned fibrils [ 37 ] . As mechanical phenotypes of cells 416 are responsive to tissue anisotropy , we next asked if the mechanical phenotype is also altered . We 417 determined that the mechanical phenotype of cells cultured in presence of fibrillar architecture and control 418 conditions was similar as measured by quantifying the Brillouin shift . 419 Cell mechanical state is a variable parameter that correlates to cell morphology 420 Within a given sample , cells adopt morphogenetic heterogeneities [ 64 , 65 ] . We next asked if we can 421 further identify sub types of mechanical phenotypes based on classification of different morphologies . First , 422 we used the brightfield images of all cells which we imaged with Brillouin microscopy to determine cell 423 morphology . To remove the underlying variability in mechanical properties of cell subpopulations in the 424 data , we devised a classification scheme based on the circularity and aspect ratio of cell shapes . Circularity 425 is defined as the ratio of the shape area and the square of its perimeter . It is normalized in such a way to be 426 in the range between 0 and 1 , where perfect circle has circularity of 1 . Similarly , the aspect ratio is a measure 427 of deviation from the perfectly round morphology . Here we define as the aspect ratio as the ratio of minor 428 to major axis of the fitted ellipse to the shape boundary . This ensures that the aspect ratio also falls in the 429 range from 0 to 1 . By combining these two parameters , we can identify cells that either have comparable 430 values of aspect ratio and circularity , or cells that have low circularity but intermediate or high value of 431 aspect ratio . Within the first subset of cells that have comparable circularity and aspect ratio , we further 432 divide those into two groups : round cells and elongated but not protrusive ( type A : round cells AR > 0 . 75 , 433 and type B : elongated cells AR < 0 . 75 ) . The remaining subset of shapes with very low circularity for the 434 given aspect ratio ( circularity – AR > 0 . 2 ) revealed cells of very long perimeter which indicated 435 morphologies with an abundance of protrusions ( Type C ) . 436 21 437 Figure 3 . ( A ) Example brightfield images of U87 cells and the shape outlines ( green line ) 438 ( B ) Scatter plot of circularity vs . aspect ratio ( minor / major axis ) of all cells . Cells were 439 classified by type according to the region of the scatter plot in which they fall . Type C 440 ( irregular ) cells are defined as cells that are more than 2 standard deviations away from the 441 identity line . The rest of the cells is classified in type A and type B cells . Type A ( round ) 442 cells are identified as cells that have aspect ratio larger than 0 . 75 ( 3 / 4 ) . Type B cells 443 ( elongated ) have aspect ratio less than ( 3 / 4 ) . ( C ) Plot of average Brillouin shift of cells 444 measured in the four conditions described in Fig 2 . , separated by cell type . Within some 445 conditions there are differences in Brillouin shift of cells of different types . ( D ) 446 Comparison of 3D vs . 2D and aligned vs . non - aligned Brillouin shift of all cells within a 447 single cell morphology type . In type B group , Brillouin shift of 3D cells is lower than the 448 Brillouin shift of 2D cells , while cells grown in presence of fibrillar topography ( FT ) have 449 higher shift than the cells grown in an isotropic matrix ( FT control ) . Unpaired t - test for 450 22 comparing 3D versus 2D , and FT vs FT control conditions in each category with at least 3 451 cells . 452 Using this classification , we identified detectable differences in Brillouin shift among these three shape 453 types ( Fig 3 . C ) . We then focused on one morphological classification and asked if culture conditions then 454 determined the Brillouin shift . We determined for the type B cells – elongated but not protrusive – adopted 455 a higher Brillouin shift when cultured in 2D environment than when cultured in 3D ( 0 . 0559 ± 0 . 023 GHz ) . 456 Moreover , cells of the same type B also adopted a higher shift in the presence of the fibrillar topography 457 than in the homogeneous 3D environment ( - 0 . 0333 ± 0 . 0131 GHz ) . 458 Cell mechanical properties in multicellular systems 459 To investigate cell mechanical properties in the context of 3D culture that includes cell - cell interactions , 460 we turn to the in vitro method of 3D culture of breast epithelial cell spheroids . This method is well 461 established and allows for repeatable formation of mammary gland like spheroids using laminin rich ECM 462 ( Matrigel ) . Here , we employed the MCF10CA1h ( M3 ) , a human breast cancer line . This cell line forms 463 robust spheroids when cultured in laminin rich extracellular matrix ( lrECM ) using the “3D on - top” method 464 [ 40 , 41 ] . Using Brillouin microscopy , we mapped the mechanical properties of individual cells in 465 suspension and longitudinally from day0 - day 5 during growth of spheroids . The heterogeneity of Brillouin 466 shifts is smaller in spheroids when compared to single cells . The heterogeneity among spheroids is similar 467 to the heterogeneity of single cells within those spheroids . To investigate the mechanical state of cells , we 468 take advantage of the high - resolution nature of Brillouin microscopy to identify single cells in the Brillouin 469 maps ( Fig 4 E ) . By manually selecting each cell in each image , we can estimate the Brillouin shift of only 470 the cells within the spheroid and thus remove effects of differential cell packing , or any cell - free spaces 471 inside the spheroid . To check if the mechanical cooperativity is stronger between neighboring cells versus 472 cells at the distant part of the spheroid , we looked at differences in Brillouin shift between each cell pair 473 within a given spheroid . Plotting this data for all day 5 spheroids of M1 cells , we find that the average 474 23 Brillouin shift difference for a pair of cells in a spheroid is constant function of pairwise distance between 475 cells ( Fig . 4 F ) . 476 477 Figure 4 . ( A ) Example Brillouin image and corresponding brightfield image of suspended 478 cells in a dish . Individual cells were identified in the Brillouin shift images by thresholding 479 and watershed transform ( see Materials and Methods ) . ( B ) .

( C ) Average Brillouin shift of cells and 481 whole spheroids ( gray points ) in three independent experiments ( color points ) . Each 482 experiment is average of multiple spheroids ( n = 7±2 spheroids ) , and in case of suspended 483 cells ( day 0 ) ( n = 58±3 cells ) . Statistical difference was detected using one - way ANOVA 484 24 with Tukey correction performed on the average values of the three independent 485 experiments ( n = 3 ) . ( D ) Illustration of the process of identifying single cells within the 486 spheroid . Single cells are manually selected in the Brillouin shift maps , and shift in each 487 cell is averaged . ( E ) Standard deviation of measured Brillouin shifts of cells in three cases : 488 across all single cells measured in an independent experiment ( n = 58±3 cells ) , across all 489 spheroids in an independent experiment ( n = 7±2 spheroids ) , and across cells within a single 490 spheroid ( averaged over all spheroids in given experiment , n = 17±6 cells , n spheroids = 7±2 ) . 491 Dotted black line denotes instrumental precision of Brillouin shift measurements . ( F ) 492 Absolute difference in Brillouin shift versus cell distance for all pairs of cells within single 493 spheroids , across all day 5 spheroids of MCF10CA1h cells ( n pairs = 7266 , Pearson correlation 494 coefficient ρ = 0 . 025 ) . Color of scatter plot denotes the density of points . Distances were 495 binned in the bins of size 2 µm and average shift ( solid red line ) and 1σ error ( dashed red 496 line ) as a function of cell pair distance are plotted . Shift values at distances > 60 µm were 497 smoothed with a 5 - bin moving average to remove out the noise due to a small number of 498 pairs in those bins . 499 Discussion 500 Cancer cells exhibit distinct mechanical properties compared to those measured for the normal 501 counterparts that are context dependent [ 2 , 28 , 66 , 67 ] . One promising idea is to use mechanical phenotype 502 to predict metastatic potential and drug responsiveness in order to aid diagnosis and treatment . However , 503 the measured mechanical properties are determined by environmental factors such as availability and 504 chemical identity of ligands [ 68 ] , nearest neighbor interactions with cells [ 23 ] , and ECM components [ 69 ] . 505 In addition , the measured values of the cellular mechanical properties depend on the length and temporal 506 scales at which the measurements are performed [ 26 , 33 , 70 ] . Thus , what is needed is the ability to measure 507 mechanical properties of cells within native tissue microenvironments . Here , we employed a non - contact , 508 25 label free technique , Brillouin microscopy to probe modulation of mechanical properties of cells in complex 509 microenvironments . Furthermore , we employed broadband frequency range optical tweezers to probe the 510 microrheology of cells to provide complementary sub - micron scale measurements to validate our Brillouin 511 microscopy results in 3D complex in vitro system . We applied these techniques to established in vitro 512 models which recapitulate in vivo basement membrane stoichiometry and tissue anisotropy . We find good 513 agreement between two independent methods : optical trap and Brillouin microscopy for probing single cell 514 mechanics . Here , we demonstrated that live cell - Brillouin microscopy revealed shifts that are sensitive to 515 environmental conditions and pharmacological perturbations . We also longitudinally mapped mechanical 516 changes as a function of spheroid formation from single cell to multicellular structures . We show that this 517 technique is sensitive to heterogeneities that arise due to nearest neighbor effects and due to differences in 518 cell morphology . 519 Mechanical phenotyping of tissues at multiple length scales have been of great interest in the field 520 of mechanobiology . Optical based techniques such as optical stretchers [ 71 ] , optical and magnetic tweezer - 521 based modalities [ 33 , 72 , 73 ] , real time deformation cytometry [ 74 ] have been employed to probe from nm 522 scale to µm scale . However , many of these techniques for assessing material properties are unable to probe 523 microscale mechanics for cells embedded in complex 3D tissues . We and others recently employed optical 524 tweezer based active microrheology to map microscale mechanical properties in 3D culture models and in 525 a living animal [ 33 , 75 - 77 ] . Several technological advancements such as the in - situ trap stiffness calibration , 526 and high sensitivity localization of the probe bead have enabled the applications in 3D cultures and in living 527 animals [ 34 ] . Additionally , broad - band frequency analysis allows quantitation of distinct viscoelastic 528 profile such as individual cell stiffnesses and hysteresivity , or relative liquid - or solid - like behavior . Access 529 to the higher frequencies also can be used to probe additional rheological metrics such as a power law 530 dependence in different materials . However , this and similar methods are limited to the use of introduced 531 probes such as polystyrene beads or intrinsic components such as organelles to infer the underlying 532 mechanical properties . In the case where external probes are introduced into tissue , these probes must be 533 26 introduced in numbers and densities that do not compromise cellular integrity and function . This then results 534 in under sampling of the cell interior at the level of single cells . In the latter case , the intrinsic organelles 535 may be of different sizes and shapes which makes it difficult to translate underlying deformation of tissue 536 to a rheological value . Moreover , the application of forces to these organelles may drive an unwanted 537 perturbation in physiological function . Thus , a non - invasive method to map the mechanical properties of 538 tissue with high resolution is desirable . Brillouin microscopy is an all - optical and purely non - invasive 539 method . Thus , it provides an attractive and complementary approach to address this need . 540 Brillouin shift is a measure of the longitudinal elastic modulus , provided that we know the index of 541 refraction and mass density of the material . In typical biological materials such as cells or tissues these 542 parameters are not always known or directly measurable , and for that reason this and majority of other 543 studies report values of Brillouin shift in GHz , rather than the value of the longitudinal modulus . 544 Interestingly , for most cells and tissues the ratio of the refractive index and the square root of the density 545 remains constant , since both index of refraction and density vary together , and the dominant contribution 546 to Brillouin shift comes from the changes in M’ . Therefore , Brillouin shift is used as a proxy measurement 547 of the local longitudinal elastic modulus [ 44 - 46 ] . In most cells and tissues this assumption is valid , but there 548 are exceptions like the lipid - rich samples where the mass density and index of refraction have dramatically 549 different values [ 78 , 79 ] . 550 In contrast to the Young’s and shear moduli which are defined in terms of the specific engineering 551 strains , longitudinal modulus is defined as uniaxial deformation due to uniaxial stress [ 43 ] . This elastic 552 constant includes a volume change and therefore it is many orders of magnitude larger in incompressible 553 materials . Furthermore , Brillouin scattering probes the longitudinal modulus on the GHz timescale [ 43 ] , 554 therefore the Brillouin derived longitudinal modulus is a fundamentally different elastic constant from the 555 traditional measurements of Young’s modulus or shear modulus . However , we and others have previously 556 shown empirical relationships between changes in the Brillouin shift and changes in the stiffness obtained 557 using traditional rheological methods in cells and tissues , which have to be ascribed to a common 558 27 dependence of the two moduli to underlying structural and biophysical factors [ 44 , 80 , 81 ] . Importantly , 559 Brillouin scattering probes material mechanical properties with spatial scale of a few hundred nanometers 560 which is determined by the characteristic length scale of the thermal density fluctuations [ 82 , 83 ] ; therefore , 561 there is a mismatch between the length scales obtained between the Brillouin microscopy and AFM or bulk 562 rheology measurements . Here , we experimentally compare Brillouin shift with a complimentary 563 microrheology measurement at the same length scale using the optical trap method , which probes the 564 material stiffness on the scale of ~ 400 nm . However , there are two important differences between these 565 methods . They measure different rheological parameters ( shear versus longitudinal moduli ) , and they probe 566 the mechanical properties at different timescales ( Hz - kHz versus GHz ) . The observed good agreement of 567 microscale properties between the two modalities at different timescales points to the fact that the 568 underlying material structure of the live cell can be probed in different rheological experiments , and that 569 cell’s mechanical phenotype determined in such a way can be used as a biomarker of the overall cell state . 570 Cells adopt different morphologies in different tissue environments [ 36 , 84 ] . It has been postulated that 571 cell morphology is linked to cell fate and may also be linked to predicting metastatic potential [ 65 ] . These 572 studies have implicated physical traits such as cell morphology , mechanical phenotype , and migration as 573 determinants of aggressiveness of many types of cancers such as breast , pancreatic , osteosarcomas , and 574 prostate cancers [ 85 - 87 ] . These studies have also performed combinatorial morphometrics and 575 transcriptomics in efforts to yield predictions of metastasis [ 60 , 65 , 88 ] . Differences in cell morphology 576 point to the differences of overall cell state which may also reflect differences in mechanical properties [ 20 , 577 44 , 66 , 89 ] . Hence , here we compared the cell mechanics as a function the environment as a function of the 578 cell morphology . Here , we determined that for similar morphologies , cells adopt different mechanical 579 phenotypes due to environmental conditions . Our findings support the idea that physical parameters such 580 as the mechanical properties can also be a proxy for cell state in a context dependent manner . However , 581 this and other data suggest that combinatorial analysis of multiple physical parameters such as morphology 582 and mechanical properties will be needed to increase predictive capacity of cell fate and function . 583 28 Tissues are multicellular units that can be homogenous cell types or combinatorial organization of 584 different types of cells . Organoid and 3D culture models allow the recapitulation of microtissues observed 585 in vivo for a multitude of epithelial organs [ 25 , 41 , 90 - 93 ] . Moreover , they can also recapitulate the 586 progressive disordered architectures associated with the malignant transformation [ 94 , 95 ] . Dynamic cell 587 behaviors such as coherent rotation [ 96 ] , cell - cell adhesion turnover [ 23 ] and coordinated cell - ECM 588 interactions [ 5 , 6 , 97 ] are important in the establishment of glandular tissues and become dysregulated in 589 the malignant transformation . However , it is less understood how cells regulate crosstalk across multiple 590 spatial and temporal scales . One idea is that there is a mechanical coupling that acts a feedback mechanism 591 to facilitate multicellular growth . We recently determined that there is a microscale coupling between 592 normal cells and matched organ ECM microenvironment using optical trap based active microrheology 593 [ 33 ] . We also determined that there was a mismatch between intracellular cell mechanics with that of the 594 surrounding matrix environment that was dependent on chemical specificity of the ECM hydrogel . This 595 technique can be employed for longitudinal mapping of multicellular spheroids . However , in case of 596 determination of multi - cellular coupling , the measurement throughput is limited as it heavily relies on the 597 optimized introduction of external probes in every cell within a spheroid . Here , Brillouin microscopy 598 rapidly determined the mechanical properties of individual cells and reveals co - operative behavior during 599 the establishment of spheroids across multiple days . For single cells in 2D and 3D , cell shape in 2D 600 brightfield images is a good approximation of the real cell shape . On the other hand , in spheroids cells are 601 tightly packed and take complex shapes . In confocal Brillouin slices , cell boundaries can be easily 602 distinguished , and we take advantage of this to approximate the Brillouin shift of each cell by manually 603 selecting them . Note that , without imaging a full volume of the spheroid which is still impractical due to 604 limited speed of acquisition ( ~ 10 - 15 min per confocal slice of the spheroid ) , we cannot get an estimate of 605 the complex cell shapes inside the spheroids . For this reason , we quantify the variance of average Brillouin 606 shifts on the level of individual cells . The decreased heterogeneity among cells in spheroids points to the 607 existence of mechanical cooperativity between cells that make up a single spheroid . It is important to note 608 here , that the shift heterogeneity within spheroids is still larger than the instrumental precision of Brillouin 609 29 shift , which means that we are still sable to detect cell - to - cell variability ( ~ 20 MHz ) which is smaller than 610 the variability of single cells ( ~ 45 MHz ) . Furthermore , we find that this variance is spatially constant across 611 the spheroid as the differences in the mechanical properties of any two cells do not depend on their distance 612 within the spheroid . It is important to note that the cell colonies start growing from single cells , and the 613 uniformity in mechanical properties could be explained by their clonal nature . 614 In summary , using all - optical methods we quantify the mechanical properties of single cells and 615 multicellular structures in 3D environments that were not accessible before . In 3D spheroids , we observed 616 a lower variance of Brillouin shifts as compared to single cells . In addition , we have shown that the 617 mechanical state of the cell is dynamic and changes depending on the context . In the future , it will be 618 interesting to investigate the relationship between the expression of key cell - cell and cell - ECM interaction 619 proteins in the spheroids in relation to the mechanical heterogeneity of cells , to elucidate the role of 620 mechanical coupling of cells in multicellular systems . 621 Acknowledgements 622 We thank Dr .
