We therefore investigated the effect of various concentrations of inspired oxygen on pentanal and hexanal exhalation and serum interleukin concentrations in 30 Sprague Dawley rats mechanically ventilated with 30 , 60 , or 93 % inspired oxygen for 12 h . Pentanal exhalation did not differ as a function of inspired oxygen but increased by an average of 0 . 4 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 3 ; 0 . 5 ) ppb per hour , with concentrations doubling from 3 . 8 ( IQR : 2 . 8 ; 5 . 1 ) ppb at baseline to 7 . 3 ( IQR : 5 . 0 ; 10 . 8 ) ppb after 12 h . Hexanal exhalation was slightly higher at 93 % of inspired oxygen with an average difference of 0 . 09 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 002 ; 0 . 172 ) ppb compared to 30 % . Serum IL - 6 did not differ by inspired oxygen , whereas IL - 10 at 60 % and 93 % of inspired oxygen was greater than with 30 % . Both interleukins increased over 12 h of mechanical ventilation at all oxygen concentrations . Mechanical ventilation at high inspired oxygen promotes pulmonary lipid peroxidation and systemic inﬂammation . However , the response of pentanal and hexanal exhalation varies , with pentanal increasing by mechanical ventilation , whereas hexanal increases by high inspired oxygen concentrations .

Introduction High inspired oxygen concentrations may cause toxicities , including oxidative stress , hyperoxic vasoconstriction , and resorption atelectasis [ 1 , 2 ] . Furthermore , reactive oxygen species promoted by high oxygen concentrations attack cell components , including lipids , proteins , and DNA—all of which provoke local and systemic inﬂammation [ 3 ] . While prolonged hyperoxia undoubtedly causes lung damage , the extent of hyperoxia - induced injury during short - term mechanical ventilation , such as might occur during surgery , is controversial [ 2 ] . The lowest inspired oxygen concentration used for intraoperative mechanical ventila - tion is about 30 % , usually resulting in only slight hyperoxemia because mechanical ventila - tion causes a degree of shunt and dead - space ventilation . Nevertheless , higher inspired oxygen concentrations are frequently used , either out of necessity to maintain a suitable arterial oxygen saturation , or simply to provide pulmonary oxygen reserve in the case of an airway problem . To assess the clinical tradeoff between additional safety and potential hyperoxia - induced lung injury , the effects of different inspired oxygen concentrations on pulmonary oxidative stress and systemic inﬂammation are thus of considerable interest .

The pro - cess releases volatile products , including the two aldehydes , pentanal and hexanal [ 5 ] , both of which have been proposed as possible breath biomarkers for pulmonary pathologies , such as lung cancer [ 6 , 7 ] and ventilator - induced lung injury [ 8 ] . Hyperoxia produces reac - tive oxygen species in lung tissue with a consequent increase in lipid peroxidation [ 9 , 10 ] . Other volatile lipid peroxidation products , especially ethane and pentane , consistently increase in the breath of hyperoxic animals and humans [ 11 – 14 ] . However , the inﬂuence of inspired oxygen on pentanal and hexanal exhalation in mechanically ventilated subjects remains to be determined for a valid interpretation of these newly proposed biomarkers . We , therefore , evaluated pentanal and hexanal exhalation in rats mechanically venti - lated for 12 h with various inspired oxygen concentrations . We simultaneously determined interleukin serum concentrations as a measure of systemic inﬂammation . Speciﬁcally , we tested the primary hypothesis that high - and medium - inspired oxygen concentrations provoke more pentanal and hexanal exhalation than lower concentrations in rats . Secon - darily , we tested the hypothesis that high inspired oxygen concentrations increase serum cytokine concentrations . 2 . Results 2 . 1 .

Discussion We expected the exhalation of both pentanal and hexanal to increase at high inspired oxygen concentrations . Instead , responses differed , with hexanal exhalation increasing by high inspired oxygen concentrations , whereas pentanal exhalation gradually increased over 12 hours of mechanical ventilation , but unrelated to inspired oxygen . Hyperoxia produces reactive oxygen species in lung tissue with a consequent in - crease in lipid peroxidation [ 9 , 10 ] . Hexanal exhalation was consistently greater at high inspired oxygen concentrations . Likewise , previous studies reported increased exhalation of ethane and pentane in hyperoxic individuals [ 11 – 14 ] . Thus , available data suggest that high - inspired oxygen concentrations induce pulmonary lipid peroxidation . Breath analy - sis may , therefore , facilitate the early detection of hyperoxic lung injury , and may be es - pecially helpful for investigating specific treatments that potentially reduce hyperoxic lung injury . Mechanical ventilation increased pentanal exhalation over time , with concentrations almost doubling over just 12 hours . As lung distension promotes injury [ 15 , 16 ] , we used tidal volumes of 8 mL / kg , which falls within the broadly accepted range of 6 – 9 mL / kg commonly used in humans [ 17 ] and rodents [ 18 , 19 ] . However , even with moderate tidal volumes , mechanical ventilation damages the cell membrane and activates cellular repair mechanisms [ 20 ] , which include transferring lipids to the cell membrane to enlarge the cell surface and help maintain its integrity [ 21 ] . Sufficiently high tidal volumes can over - come cellular repair mechanisms , leading to membrane defects , followed by apoptosis or necrosis [ 20 ] . Cell death seems unlikely with the ventilator settings we used , but sublethal cellular membrane damage may expose polyunsaturated fatty acids to oxidative pro - cesses , and thus increase pentanal exhalation . This theory is consistent with in vitro stud - ies , showing that pentanal is the predominant volatile aldehyde generated by oxidizing lipid membranes exposed to mechanical stress through sonication [ 22 ] and by oxidizing isolated polyunsaturated fatty acids [ 23 ] . The observed gradual increase in pentanal exhalation over 12 hours of mechanical ventilation is consistent with our previous finding that exhaled pentanal is highly sensi - tive to volutrauma [ 8 ] . Based on the biological background presented above , we Figure 3 . Cytokine serum concentrations . Data presented as medians and interquartile ranges . IL - 6 at 1 h was 0 for all animals .

Discussion We expected the exhalation of both pentanal and hexanal to increase at high inspired oxygen concentrations . Instead , responses differed , with hexanal exhalation increasing by high inspired oxygen concentrations , whereas pentanal exhalation gradually increased over 12 h of mechanical ventilation , but unrelated to inspired oxygen . Hyperoxia produces reactive oxygen species in lung tissue with a consequent increase in lipid peroxidation [ 9 , 10 ] . Hexanal exhalation was consistently greater at high inspired oxygen concentrations . Likewise , previous studies reported increased exhalation of ethane and pentane in hyperoxic individuals [ 11 – 14 ] . Thus , available data suggest that high - inspired oxygen concentrations induce pulmonary lipid peroxidation . Breath analysis may , therefore , facilitate the early detection of hyperoxic lung injury , and may be especially helpful for investigating speciﬁc treatments that potentially reduce hyperoxic lung injury . Mechanical ventilation increased pentanal exhalation over time , with concentrations almost doubling over just 12 h . As lung distension promotes injury [ 15 , 16 ] , we used tidal volumes of 8 mL / kg , which falls within the broadly accepted range of 6 – 9 mL / kg commonly used in humans [ 17 ] and rodents [ 18 , 19 ] . However , even with moderate tidal volumes , mechanical ventilation damages the cell membrane and activates cellular repair mechanisms [ 20 ] , which include transferring lipids to the cell membrane to enlarge the cell surface and help maintain its integrity [ 21 ] . Sufﬁciently high tidal volumes can over - come cellular repair mechanisms , leading to membrane defects , followed by apoptosis or necrosis [ 20 ] . Cell death seems unlikely with the ventilator settings we used , but sublethal cellular membrane damage may expose polyunsaturated fatty acids to oxidative processes , and thus increase pentanal exhalation . This theory is consistent with in vitro studies , showing that pentanal is the predominant volatile aldehyde generated by oxidizing lipid membranes exposed to mechanical stress through sonication [ 22 ] and by oxidizing isolated polyunsaturated fatty acids [ 23 ] . The observed gradual increase in pentanal exhalation over 12 h of mechanical venti - lation is consistent with our previous ﬁnding that exhaled pentanal is highly sensitive to volutrauma [ 8 ] . Based on the biological background presented above , we previously postu - lated that stretch - induced cell membrane damage exposes membrane lipids to oxidative processes , thereby increasing the exhalation of pentanal . In contrast , hexanal concentrations did not increase over 12 h , although hexanal and pentanal are likely generated by similar mechanisms [ 5 ] . The relatively low vapor pressure of hexanal may have contributed [ 24 , 25 ] , Molecules 2021 , 26 , 2752 5 of 9 but it is non - obvious why hexanal did not increase . Future studies may clarify reasons for the differential response of pentanal and hexanal to mechanical ventilation . Inspired oxygen concentrations greater than 30 % did not increase exhaled pentanal , probably because even that amount of oxygen is sufﬁcient to oxidize all available membrane lipids from which pentanal arises . Our lowest inspired oxygen concentration was 30 % since lower concentrations are rarely used for mechanical ventilation . Our results , therefore , well characterize the effects of supplemental oxygen during mechanical ventilation . The current study consistently showed that pentanal increases due to mechanical ventilation and adds the important ﬁnding that exhaled pentanal is a potential breath biomarker that can be interpreted independently from inspired oxygen . Pentanal and hexanal are potential biomarkers of lung , breast , and gastrointestinal cancers in humans [ 6 , 7 , 26 , 27 ] . Cancer causes cell death , for example , by tumor growth , exceeding supply with nutrients , attacks by immune cells , or by the inﬂammation and destruction of surrounding tissues . Cell death is accompanied by cell membrane break - down , exposing lipids to oxidation , and may thus prompt the exhalation of aldehydes . As might , therefore , be expected , lung cancer increases pentanal and hexanal exhalation [ 6 , 7 ] . Furthermore , acute respiratory distress syndrome increases both pentanal and hexanal concentrations in blood [ 28 ] . Taken together , pentanal and hexanal seem to be general markers of cell membrane damage , and our ﬁndings suggest that exhaled pentanal also increases when lung tissue is mechanically stressed . Interleukin serum concentrations increased over 12 h of mechanical ventilation , with only IL - 10 being greater at higher inspired oxygen concentrations . Helmerhorst et al . reported that IL - 6 serum concentrations remain similar at various inspired oxygen con - centrations over 12 h of mechanical ventilation in mice , but IL - 10 concentrations in bron - choalveolar ﬂuid substantially increase [ 16 ] . However , others reported no inﬂuence of oxygen on the mRNA expression of IL - 10 in mouse lungs [ 29 , 30 ] . Consistent with inﬂamma - tion accruing over time , lung tissue IL - 6 mRNA increases after 48 h of hyperoxia [ 31 ] . High inspired oxygen concentrations induce cytokine gene expression in alveolar macrophages of surgical patients , reﬂecting local pulmonary inﬂammation [ 32 ] . However , IL - 6 was less affected by hyperoxia than other cytokines , and IL - 10 was not measured [ 32 ] . Taken together , the available data suggest that high - inspired oxygen induces a slight systemic inﬂammatory response during up to 12 h of mechanical ventilation . The most obvious limitation of our study is that lipid peroxidation , cell membrane components , and antioxidative capacities presumably differ among species . However , lipid peroxidation is fundamental to oxidative stress . It is , therefore , likely that results in humans are qualitatively similar , although presumably quantitatively different . We did not conduct a formal sample - size estimate because the treatment effect was non - obvious . We also note that anesthetic drugs could have inﬂuenced our results , as propofol has antioxidative properties and may inhibit lipid peroxidation processes [ 33 – 35 ] . We did not include a control group ventilated with 21 % oxygen because , in previous studies , this concentration resulted in hypoxemia and even death . Finally , our results are speciﬁc to mechanical ventilation ; results likely differ with spontaneous ventilation . In summary , mechanical ventilation and high inspired oxygen promote pulmonary lipid peroxidation and systemic inﬂammation . However , the response of pentanal and hexanal exhalation varies , with pentanal increasing in response to mechanical ventilation and hexanal increasing in response to high concentrations of inspired oxygen . Our results suggest that exhaled pentanal , a potential biomarker for lung injury , can be interpreted independent of the inspired oxygen concentration during mechanical ventilation . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Animals Experiments were conducted in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act and with approval from the responsible Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Molecules 2021 , 26 , 2752 6 of 9 ( Landesamt für Soziales , Saarland , Saarbrücken , Germany , No . 28 / 2018 , date of approval : 01 . 08 . 2018 ) . Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats ( 280 – 380 g body weight , age 8 – 10 weeks ) were obtained from Charles River Laboratory International ( Sulzfeld , Germany ) and kept in our institutional animal facility under controlled conditions ( temperature 20 ± 2 ◦ C and 50 ± 5 % relative humidity ) . The rats had free access to water and standard pellet food . Monitoring and preparation were performed , as previously described [ 36 ] . No speciﬁc inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied . Animals were included as long as the experimental protocol was adequately followed and in the absence of poor welfare signs ( e . g . , wounds , secretion of harderian gland , signs of dehydration , diarrhea , isolation from others , itching ) . 4 . 2 . Anesthesia Anesthesia was induced with sevoﬂurane ( Baxter , Unterschleißheim , Germany ) and maintained with intravenous propofol ( Fresenius Kabi , Bad Homburg , Germany ) starting at 25 mg / kg / h with hourly reductions of 0 . 5 mg / h until a minimal rate of 15 mg / kg / h was reached . Ketamine ( Rotexmedica , Trittau , Germany ) was added with 25 mg / kg / h throughout the experiment for analgesia . Neuromuscular blockade was induced by a bolus of 10 mg / kg rocuronium ( Grünenthal , Stolberg , Germany ) and maintained by a continuous infusion of 25 mg / kg / h rocuronium . Animals were observed for 12 h and then killed by exsanguination . 4 . 3 . Ventilation Oxygen was produced by a concentrator ( Compact 525 , Devilbiss , NY , USA ) with a maximum output of 93 ± 3 % , mixed with generated nitrogen ( Genius , Peak Scientiﬁc , Inchinnan , Scotland , UK ) and puriﬁed by activated charcoal ﬁltration . Inspired oxygen was constantly monitored and adapted to maintain concentrations at 30 % or 60 % within a range of ± 1 % ( sensor : GGA 370 , device : GMH 3695 , Greisinger , Regenstauf , Germany ) . For the highest oxygen group , the maximum output of the oxygen concentrator was used , resulting in a concentration of 93 ± 3 % . Ten rats each were randomly assigned to three different fractions of inspired oxygen : 30 % , 60 % , and 93 % . Animals were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 based on a computer - generated list . Investigators were not blinded during the experiments , but allocation was concealed during post - experimental analysis . Animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 mL / kg , a respi - ratory rate of 63 breaths / min , and a PEEP of 2 cmH 2 O ( VentStar small animal ventilator , RWD Life Sciences , Shenzhen , China ) . The respiratory rate was reduced by 10 % when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was less than 28 mmHg . Similarly , the respiratory rate was increased by 10 % when partial pressure exceeded 45 mmHg . 4 . 4 . Breath and Blood Samples Blood for gas analyses was sampled after 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 h to monitor ventilation ( Radiometer ABL 800 Basic , Willich , Germany ) . Ten milliliters of exhaled air were sampled and analyzed with two multi capillary columns—ion mobility spectrometers ( MCC - IMS by B & S Analytik , Dortmund , Germany ) in 15 - minute intervals , as previously described [ 36 ] . The MCC - IMS was calibrated by pentanal and hexanal standards ranging from 0 . 1 to 50 ppb ( analytical standard , Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , as previously described [ 23 ] . Arterial blood samples of 600 µ L were collected after 1 and 12 h . Plasma was stored at − 75 ◦ C . Interleukin 6 and 10 serum concentrations were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Positive controls of each cytokine were measured routinely with each assay ( ELISA Antibodies BD OptEIA ; BD Biosciences Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) . 4 . 5 . Statistics Statistical analyses were carried out with R 4 . 0 . 2 ( R Core Team , 2020 ) using the pack - ages geepack ( Højsgaard , Halekoh , and Yan , 2006 ) and broom ( v0 . 7 . 5 ; Robinson , Hayes and Molecules 2021 , 26 , 2752 7 of 9 Couch , 2021 ) . Figures were created with SigmaPlot 12 . 5 ( Systat Software GmbH , Erkrath , Germany ) . Normality was assessed by visual inspection of histograms and quantile - quantile plots . Most data were not normally distributed . Therefore , all results are presented as medians and interquartile ranges . Inﬂuences of inspired oxygen and mechanical ventila - tion time on aldehyde exhalation were assessed by linear generalized estimating equations regression to account for within - subject correlations . The inﬂuence of inspired oxygen on interleukin concentrations was assessed by linear generalized estimating equations regression combined with a Wald statistic . Interleukin concentrations after 1 and 12 h were compared over all groups by a Wilcoxon signed - rank test . A two - sided p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . There was no a priori sample size estimate since the expected effect sizes and the clinical signiﬁcance of increases in aldehyde exhalation through supplemental inspired oxygen are essentially unknown . Supplementary Materials : The following are available online , Supplementary File 1 ( including Figure S1 : Vital parameters and Table S1 : Results of blood gas analysis ) ; Supplementary File 2 : Pentanal and hexanal exhalation ; Supplementary File 3 : Interleukin serum concentrations .
