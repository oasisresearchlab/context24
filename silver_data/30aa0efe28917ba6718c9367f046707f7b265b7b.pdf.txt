Formation of these carriers requires membrane defor - mation at multiple steps , including the generation of membrane curvature to form a bud , extension of the bud to form the tubule or vesicle , and scission to release the carrier ( Anitei and Hoflack , 2011 ) . These steps require motor - dependent forces along micro - tubules and actin filaments ( F - actin ; Anitei and Hoflack , 2011 ) . Theoretical models for vesicle scission predict that actin polymerization and / or myosin motor activity generates forces that facilitate membrane fission ( Liu et al . , 2006 ; Simunovic et al . , 2017 ) . In cells , F - actin dynamics coincide with and promote the release of tubular intermediates from the plasma membrane ( Römer et al . , 2010 ) , whereas myosin II ( perhaps with myosin Vb ) contributes to the fission of TGN - derived tubules ( Miserey - Lenkei et al . , 2010 ; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Myosin VI ( Myo6 ) has also been proposed to participate in fission events at the TGN ( Warner et al . , 2003 ) or the plasma membrane ( Buss et al . , 2001 ) , but a direct role for Myo6 has not yet been demonstrated . Whether actin and associated myosins remodel the membrane to sup - port the physical separation of the transport intermediate from the source membrane is not understood . Additionally , whether such severing activity might affect organelle function remains to be determined . Myo6 is unique among mammalian myosin motors in that it moves toward the minus end of F - actin ( Wells et al . , 1999 ) . Importantly , Myo6 does not only move membrane carriers , but also tethers them to the actin cytoskeleton ( Altman et al . , 2004 ) . Myo6 supports critical functions at multiple cellular sites via different adaptors that target it to plasma membrane – derived vesicles ( Dab2 and GIPC ; Dance et al . , 2004 ; Naccache et al . , 2006 ; Spudich et al . , 2007 ) or to endosomes , autophagosomes , or Golgi ( e . g . , LMTK2 , TOM1 , and optineurin ; Sahlender et al . , 2005 ; Au et al . , 2007 ; Chibalina et al . , 2007 ; Tumbarello et al . , © 2018 Ripoll et al .

Among them , optineurin is a multidomain protein that can modulate signaling pathways as well as various trafficking events ( Slowicka et al . , 2016 ) . For example , Myo6 cooperates with opti - neurin and controls Golgi morphology and post - Golgi trafficking ( Sahlender et al . , 2005 ) , plasma membrane fusion of secretory vesicles ( Bond et al . , 2011 ) , autophagosome – lysosome fusion ( Tumbarello et al . , 2012 ) , or endosomal cargo sorting ( Au et al . , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , the molecular mechanisms underlying the various cellular activities of Myo6 are still poorly characterized , and whether optineurin is needed to recruit Myo6 onto mem - branes or to modulate its activity is not understood . Lysosome - related organelles ( LROs ) are cell type – specific membrane - bound compartments that share features with endosomes and lysosomes and fulfill physiologically important functions ( Marks et al . , 2013 ) . Melanosomes , the LROs of skin epidermal melanocytes and eye pigment cells , function in the synthesis and storage of melanin pigments . Within melano - cytes , melanosomes originate from endosomes and progressively mature into fully pigmented organelles ( Raposo et al . , 2001 ) that are ultimately secreted and transferred to neighboring epidermal keratinocytes ( Delevoye , 2014 ; Wu and Hammer , 2014 ) . Melano - somes are unique in that the melanin biopolymer deposited on a rigid proteinaceous matrix , and filling their lumen , may impose a particular stiffness to their limiting membrane . On the other hand , melanosomes are dynamic sorting stations that resemble endosomes ; they constantly receive membranous components from endocytic and secretory pathways ( Marks et al . , 2013 ; Patwardhan et al . , 2017 ) and recycle materials such as SNA RE proteins through tubular carriers ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) . Although actin polymerization and myosins are thought to contribute to the remodeling of stiff membranes ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) , how the melanosome reshapes its membrane to recycle components is unknown . Moreover , the morphologi - cal features of these melanosomal recycling tubules , the mecha - nisms underlying their formation and fission , and their function during pigmentation are not well understood . We previously showed that Myo6 associates with pigmented melanosomes where it regulates local actin dynamics ( Loubéry et al . , 2012 ) . Myo6 does not move melanosomes along F - actin but rather controls melanosome maturation through an unknown process ( Loubéry et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we show that Myo6 con - trols the fission of membrane tubules from melanosomes that were previously shown to function in SNA RE recycling ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) . Severing of the tubules requires the constriction of the neck at specific melanosomal subdomains , which is medi - ated by Myo6 motor activity . Pinching of the tubules involves the cooperation of optineurin and the activity of actin nucle - ation machineries such as the WASH ( Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein and SCAR homolog ) and Arp2 / 3 complexes . This process not only facilitates cargo export for melanosome mat - uration but also ensures its homeostasis and function , includ - ing the secretion and transfer of melanin pigment to recipient keratinocytes . This study thus uncovers an unprecedented role for Myo6 and actin dynamics in the constriction of membranes required for the fission of tubular transport intermediates and organelle function . Results Myo6 promotes the release of melanosomal tubules We first investigated the role of Myo6 in melanosome mem - brane remodeling by addressing the dynamics of the SNA RE VAMP7 , the only membrane component known to recycle from melanosomes via tubular intermediates ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) . As described in mouse melanocytes ( Jani et al . , 2015 ; Dennis et al . , 2016 ) , exogenously expressed mCherry - VAMP7 ( mCh - VAMP7 ) in MNT - 1 human melanoma cells localized primarily to melano - somes ( Fig . 1 A , arrows ) and colocalized with the melanogenic enzyme Tyrosinase - related protein - 1 fused to GFP ( GFP - TYRP1 , Fig . S1 , A and B , arrowheads ; Pearson’s correlation coefficient , P = 0 . 88 ) . Also , mCh - VAMP7 was frequently detected in a single tubular structure ( Fig . 1 B and Video 1 , arrowheads ) emerging from the melanosome core ( Fig . 1 B and Video 1 , arrows ) . These tubules were recently defined as intermediates in cargo recy - cling from melanosomes ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) and , as shown in Fig . 1 B , they separated from melanosomes ( red arrow ) within a few seconds of their formation ( Fig . 1 C ; 4 . 7 ± 0 . 9 s ) . Strik - ingly , siRNA - mediated depletion of Myo6 ( Fig . S1 C ) increased twofold , relative to controls , the total number of mCh - VAMP7 + tubules that associated with melanosomes ( Fig . 1 , D and E , arrow - heads ; and Video 2 , arrowheads ; siMyo6 , 8 ± 1 . 1 ; siCtrl ; 4 ± 0 . 6 ) . Among these tubules , the number that formed during a 40 - s live acquisition was not statistically different in control and Myo6 - depleted cells ( Fig . S1 D ) . This indicates that the initiation or the emergence of melanosomal tubules was not affected by Myo6 depletion . Rather , the percentage of tubules that detached from melanosomes during the acquisition was threefold lower upon Myo6 depletion ( Fig . 1 , F – H ; siCtrl , 32 ± 5 . 9 % ; siMyo6 , 9 . 7 ± 0 . 5 % ) . Importantly , in Myo6 - depleted cells , the increased number of tubules and the defect in tubule release were both largely rescued by the reexpression of an siRNA - resistant full - length Myo6 fused to GFP ( GFP - Myo6 R ; Fig . 1 , E and F ) . To determine whether Myo6 is present at the site of tubule release , we assessed the localiza - tion of full - length Myo6 fused to GFP ( GFP - Myo6 ) relative to the mCh - VAMP7 + melanosomal tubules . GFP - Myo6 decorated punc - tate structures associated with mCh - VAMP7 + melanosomes ( Fig . S1 E , arrows ) from which the tubules emerged ( Fig . S1 E , arrow - heads ) . Its presence at the intersection between the melanosome core and its associated tubule ( see also below ) is consistent with a potential role for Myo6 during tubule fission and release . Of note , the dynamic release ( Fig . S1 F , red arrow ) of mCh - VAMP7 + tubules ( Fig . S1 F , arrowheads ) from melanosomes occurred precisely at the GFP - Myo6 + subdomains ( Fig . S1 F , arrows ; and Video 3 ) . Together , these data indicate that Myo6 controls the fission and / or release of melanosomal recycling tubules . To determine whether tubule release requires Myo6 motor function , we treated cells with 2 , 4 , 6 - triiodophenol ( TIP ) , a specific inhibitor of its ATPase activity ( Heissler et al . , 2012 ) . Although TIP treatment did not alter Myo6 expression ( Fig . S1 G ) , the number of mCh - VAMP7 + tubules associated with mela - nosomes increased twofold as compared with treatment with vehicle ( Fig . 1 , I and J ; and Video 4 , arrowheads ; DMSO , 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 tubules ; TIP , 5 . 3 ± 0 . 8 tubules ) or with another drug as control , the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin ( Fig . S1 H ; Straight et al . , 2003 ; Limouze et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , TIP treatment dramatically Ripoll et al .

Ripoll et al . Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2712 reduced the fraction of tubules that detached from melanosomes over time ( Fig . 1 K ; DMSO , 19 . 4 ± 3 . 5 % ; TIP , 6 . 1 ± 1 . 1 % ) without affecting their formation ( Fig . S1 I ) . As an alternative approach , we tested the effect of expressing the motorless Myo6 C - terminal cargo - binding domain ( GFP - Myo6 - CBD ) , which localizes to membranes ( Aschenbrenner et al . , 2003 ; Altman et al . , 2004 ) , including melanosomes ( Loubéry et al . , 2012 ) , without binding to F - actin . As observed in Myo6 - depleted or TIP - treated cells ( Fig . 1 , D and I ) , GFP - Myo6 - CBD + melanosomes ( arrow ) exhibited mCh - VAMP7 + tubules ( arrowhead ) that appeared stably associated with melanosomes over time ( Fig . 1 L and Video 5 , arrowheads ) , further suggesting that Myo6 activity on F - actin is required for tubule release . Similar to GFP - Myo6 ( Fig . S1 , E and F ) , GFP - Myo6 - CBD localized to discrete puncta , many of which associated with mCh - VAMP7 + ( P = 0 . 56 ) or TYRP1 - RFP + ( P = 0 . 73 ) melanosomes ( Fig . 1 , L and M ; and Fig . S1 , J and K , arrowheads ) . In addition , using multifocal structured illumination superresolution fluo - rescence microscopy ( SR - FM ; Materials and methods ; York et al . , 2012 ) , GFP - Myo6 - CBD localized precisely on melanosomes to the core / tubule intersection ( Fig . 1 , N and O , arrow and arrow - head , respectively ) . Altogether , these data show that Myo6 motor activity promotes the fission and / or release of VAMP7 - contain - ing tubules from melanosomes . Optineurin cooperates with Myo6 during the release of melanosomal tubules We next assessed Myo6 localization in MNT - 1 cells and normal human melanocytes ( NHMs ) using superresolution immunoflu - orescence microscopy ( SR - IFM ; Figs . 2 A and S2 A ) . As observed for GFP - Myo6 or GFP - Myo6 - CBD ( Fig . 1 , L – O ; Fig . S1 , E , F , and J ; and Fig . S2 , B and C ) , endogenous Myo6 associated with discrete subdomains ( Fig . 2 , A and B ; and Fig . S2 A , arrowheads ) on nearly 90 % of melanosomes labeled with TYRP1 ( Fig . 2 C ; 86 ± 2 . 1 % ) . On average , each positive melanosome harbored approximately two Myo6 subdomains ( Fig . 2 D ; 1 . 82 ± 0 . 04 ) . Myo6 functions on different membranes together with spe - cific adaptors ( Tumbarello et al . , 2013 ) , among which optineurin associates with lysosomes and autophagosomes ( Tumbarello et al . , 2012 ; Sundaramoorthy et al . , 2015 ) . Like Myo6 ( Fig . 2 A ) , endogenous optineurin is detected by SR - IFM on punctate struc - tures ( Fig . 2 , E and F , arrowheads ) that associated as subdomains with TYRP1 + melanosomes in MNT - 1 cells ( Fig . 2 G ; 79 ± 4 . 2 % ) or NHMs ( Fig . S2 D , arrowheads ) . Consistently , optineurin associ - ated with TYRP1 + pigmented melanosome - enriched subcellular fractions of MNT - 1 cells ( Fig . S2 E , siCtrl , Mel lane ) . By SR - IFM , approximately two optineurin + puncta ( 1 . 87 ± 0 . 05 ) were detected per melanosome ( Fig . 2 H ) that partially overlapped with Myo6 ( Fig . 2 I , arrowheads ; Manders overlap coefficient = 0 . 4 ) on > 80 % of GFP - Myo6 - CBD + melanosomes ( Fig . 2 J , 85 ± 4 . 4 % ) . Additionally , GFP - Myo6 - CBD immunoprecipitate ( IP ) was enriched in optineurin relative to GFP - IP ( Fig . 2 K ) , suggesting that optineurin and Myo6 associate with each other on melano - somal subdomains . We further explored whether optineurin contributes to the recruitment and / or association of Myo6 with melanosomes . Depletion of optineurin in MNT - 1 cells did not affect the asso - ciation of Myo6 with melanosomes by subcellular fractionation ( Fig . S2 , E and F ) . Also by live imaging , GFP - Myo6 - CBD localized as puncta associated with mCh - VAMP7 + melanosomes in control - or optineurin - depleted cells ( Fig . S2 , G – I , arrowheads ) . Next , we addressed whether optineurin contributes to the release of melanosomal tubules . As in Myo6 - depleted or TIP - treated cells , optineurin depletion in MNT - 1 cells doubled the total number of mCh - VAMP7 + tubules ( arrowheads ) associated with melano - somes ( Fig . 2 , L and M , arrows ) , without increasing the number of tubules that emerged from melanosomes during the acquisi - tion ( Fig . S2 J ) . This reflected a dramatic reduction in the num - ber of tubules that detached from melanosomes over the time of acquisition ( Fig . 2 N ; siCtrl , 32 ± 5 . 9 % ; siOptn , 9 . 7 ± 0 . 4 % ) . Although optineurin does not recruit Myo6 , our data suggest collectively that it could control Myo6 activity to promote the efficient release of recycling tubules from melanosomes . Myo6 constricts the neck of recycling melanosomal tubules To establish how Myo6 controls the release of melanosomal tubules , we analyzed MNT - 1 cells expressing GFP - Myo6 - CBD by correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) . Cells were immobilized by high - pressure freezing ( HPF ) to preserve mem - branes in their native state ( Murk et al . , 2003 ) and then pro - cessed for CLEM analysis ( Materials and methods ; Kukulski et al . , 2011 ; Heiligenstein et al . , 2014 ; Delevoye et al . , 2016 ; Hurbain et al . , 2017 ) . Thick sections ( 300 nm ) postlabeled with Hoechst dye ( blue ) to reveal nuclei were observed by wide - field fluo - rescence microscopy and screened for GFP ( green ) + structures associated with photon - dense pigmented melanosomes in bright field ( Fig . 3 A , merge , boxed area , arrows ) . Low - magnification EM micrographs of cells of interest were acquired and overlaid to the light microscopy images ( Paul - Gilloteaux et al . , 2017 ; Fig . 3 B ) . Chosen areas consisting of GFP - Myo6 - CBD + pigmented melano - somes ( Fig . 3 B , boxed area ) were processed by double - tilt 3D electron tomography to reveal their 3D ultrastructure ( Fig . 3 C ; Hurbain et al . , 2008 ) . The corresponding 3D model of one such area ( Fig . 3 D and Video 6 ) showed a tubule ( Fig . 3 D , arrowhead ) in continuity with the limiting membrane of the melanosome ( Fig . 3 D , arrow ) . Using eC - CLEM software ( Paul - Gilloteaux et al . , 2017 ) , we estimated that the registration accuracy of the flu - orescent signal within that area was 41 nm . This suggests that GFP - Myo6 - CBD likely localizes to the neck of the tubule ( Fig . 1 , N and O ) , as predicted for a role for Myo6 in tubule fission . To further characterize the ultrastructure of the melano - somal carriers , we performed conventional 2D - EM analyses of nontreated , control , and Myo6 - depleted MNT - 1 cells immobi - lized by HPF . While control cells harbored typical round or ovoid pigmented melanosomes ( Fig . 3 E , arrows ) , Myo6 - depleted cells contained numerous melanosomes with large tubular extensions ( Fig . 3 , E and F ; and Fig . S3 A , arrowheads ) . Importantly , con - nected tubular extensions were also observed in siCtrl or non - treated cells ( Figs . 3 F and S3 B , arrowheads ) , but at a much lower frequency than in Myo6 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3 G ) . In addition , quantification showed that the tubular structures in Myo6 - de - pleted cells were longer ( Fig . 3 H ; siMyo6 , 155 ± 4 nm ; siCtrl , 124 ± 10 nm ) and their necks were wider ( Fig . 3 I ; siMyo6 , 143 ± 4 ; siCtrl , 114 ± 9 nm ) than in control cells . Also , a plot of the distri - bution of the neck width showed that whereas highly constricted Ripoll et al .

Melanin polymerizes on elongated and rigid amyloid fibril - lary sheets that deform melanosomes to their ovoid shape ( Bissig et al . , 2016 ) . We reasoned that melanized sheets might enter the lumen of the enlarged tubules of Myo6 - depleted cells and pro - vide a rigid internal scaffold to prevent their constriction . How - ever , in any tested condition , we rarely observed melanin + sheets within tubules , suggesting that they are actually excluded from the recycling melanosomal tubules ( Fig . 3 , E and F ; and Fig . S3 , A – D ) . Moreover , the tubules in control or Myo6 - depleted cells often oriented parallel to the long axis of the polymerized sheets ( Fig . S3 , E and F ) . This suggests that the inherent mechanical properties of melanin + fibrillary sheets might define the site of tubule formation and Myo6 - driven fission . Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation supports melanosomal tubule fission Given that Myo6 is an actin - based motor and that branched F - actin plays an important role in endosomal membrane dynamics ( Gautreau et al . , 2014 ) , we assessed the role of F - actin and Arp2 / 3 in melanosomal tubule fission . We first asked whether branched F - actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex could be detected by SR - IFM in proximity to melanosomes . We labeled cells with antibodies to the p34 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex or to endogenous cort - actin , a class II nucleation - promoting factor that interacts and codistributes with Arp2 / 3 and used here as a branched F - actin reporter ( Schnoor et al . , 2018 ) . Both cortactin ( 78 ± 2 . 8 % ) and p34 ( 79 . 8 ± 3 % ) associated with a majority of TYRP1 + melano - somes ( Fig . 4 , A – F , arrowheads ) , and they decorated approxi - mately two subdomains per melanosome ( Fig . 4 , E – H ; cortactin , 1 . 7 ± 0 . 04 ; p34 , 1 . 7 ± 0 . 05 ) that codistributed with Myo6 ( Fig . S4 , A – D , arrowheads ) . We next tested whether Arp2 / 3 activity is required for tubule formation using CK - 666 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) , a small - molecule inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 activity that stabilizes the complex in its inactive state and thus prevents the nucleation of branched F - actin ( Hetrick et al . , 2013 ) . Similar to TIP - treated cells or to the depletion of Myo6 or optineurin , treatment of mCh - VAMP7 – expressing MNT - 1 cells with CK - 666 increased twofold the num - ber of mCh - VAMP7 + tubules ( Fig . 4 , I and J , arrowheads ; DMSO , 3 . 3 ± 0 . 9 ; CK - 666 , 6 . 9 ± 1 . 0 ) associated with melanosomes ( Fig . 4 I and Video 7 , arrows ) . Also , the percentage of tubules that detach over time was reduced ( Fig . 4 K ) , with no effect on the rate of Figure 4 . Fission of melanosomal tubules requires the Arp2 / 3 complex activity .

Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2716 new tubules emerging from melanosome ( Fig . S4 E ) . In contrast , tubule formation in cells treated with an inhibitor of formin - mediated actin polymerization , SMI FH2 ( Rizvi et al . , 2009 ) , was comparable to that in the vehicle - treated controls ( Fig . S4 F ) . Moreover , CK - 666 treatment did not alter Myo6 expression or localization to melanosomes ( Fig . S4 , G and H , arrowheads ) . These data show that Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation of branched F - actin contributes to the fission of melanosomal tubules . The WASH complex contributes to the constriction and fission of melanosomal tubules The WASH complex is another actin nucleation – promoting fac - tor that contributes to the fission of endosomal tubular carri - ers by activating Arp2 / 3 and promoting local branched F - actin nucleation ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Using SR - IFM , nearly 70 % of TYRP1 + melanosomes associated with the WASH1 subunit ( Fig . S4 I ; 67 . 4 ± 3 . 5 % ) that similarly dec - orated approximately two subdomains per melanosome ( Fig . S4 J ; 1 . 6 ± 0 . 04 ) . These subdomains partially overlapped with F - actin ( labeled by cortactin ; Fig . S4 , K and L , arrowheads ) or with Myo6 ( Fig . S4 , M and N , arrowheads ; Manders overlap coefficient = 0 . 33 ) on > 50 % of GFP - Myo6 - CBD + melanosomes . Interestingly , anti - GFP coimmunoprecipitation assays on transfected MNT - 1 cell lysates showed that the WASH complex subunit strumpellin , but not WASH1 , was enriched in GFP - Myo6 - CBD IPs compared with the GFP control . As a positive control , both subunits were highly enriched in IPs from cells expressing GFP - Vps35 , a subunit of the retromer complex that interacts directly with the WASH complex ( Harbour et al . , 2012 ; Fig . S4 O ) . Therefore , this suggests together that a fraction of Myo6 associates weakly and / or tran - siently with the WASH complex to melanosomes . In addition , and as observed for Myo6 depletion or Arp2 / 3 inhibition , destabilization of the WASH complex by depletion of WASH1 ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Fig . S4 P ) increased the percent - age of melanosomes that associated with mCh - VAMP7 + tubules relative to control without affecting their formation ( Fig . 5 , A and B ; Fig . S4 Q ; and Video 8 ) . Importantly , the proportion of tubules undergoing fission in WASH1 - depleted cells decreased relative to control ( Fig . 5 C ) . Conventional 2D - EM analysis of high - pres - sure frozen WASH1 - depleted MNT - 1 cells revealed numerous tubular extensions in continuity with the limiting melanoso - mal membrane ( Figs . 5 D and S4 R , arrowheads ) , as observed in Myo6 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , these tubular extensions were more abundant and longer and their necks were wider than those in control cells ( Fig . 5 , E – G ; length , siWASH1 : 157 ± 6 nm and siCtrl : 124 ± 10 nm ; width , siWASH1 : 157 ± 5 nm and siCtrl : 114 ± 9 nm ) . Finally , tubules with a constricted neck ( < 50 nm ) were barely detected ( Fig . 5 H ) . Our data show that WASH deple - tion recapitulates the phenotype of Myo6 - depleted melanocytes and support a model in which Myo6 and WASH - mediated actin polymerization cooperate to constrict the melanosomal tubule before fission . Myo6 , WASH , and optineurin are required for melanosome homeostasis and function We have previously shown that depleting Myo6 in melano - cytes led to increased melanin content and the accumulation of TYRP1 on melanosomal membranes by immuno - EM ( IEM ; Loubéry et al . , 2012 ) . To validate and extend this result , we first confirmed that Myo6 - , WASH1 - , and optineurin - depleted cells ( Figs . 6 A and S5 A ) had increased melanin pigment con - tent ( Figs . 6 B and S5 B ; siMyo6 , 1 . 21 ± 0 . 05 ; siWASH1 , 1 . 13 ± 0 . 03 ; siOptn , 1 . 21 ± 0 . 08 and normalized to siCtrl ) . Consis - tently , depletion of Myo6 , WASH1 , or optineurin increased the amount of TYRP1 and also VAMP7 detected in melanoso - mal subcellular fractions ( Fig . 6 , C and D ; and Fig . S5 , C and D ) , indicating that increased melanin content correlates with increased melanosomal cargo content . IEM analysis showed that depletion of Myo6 or WASH1 increased the percentage of GFP - VAMP7 + pigmented melanosomes as well as the num - ber of GFP - VAMP7 – associated gold particles ( Fig . 6 E , arrow - heads ) per melanosome ( Fig . 6 , E – G ) . These data suggest that the homeostasis of melanosomes is perturbed after depletion of Myo6 , WASH1 or optineurin . To investigate alteration in homeostasis , we monitored the luminal pH of melanosomes by incubating control - or Myo6 - depleted cells with the weak base 3 - ( 2 , 4 - dinitroanilino ) - 3′ - amino - N - methyldipropylamine ( DAMP ) , which accumulates and labels acidic compartments ( Anderson et al . , 1984 ; Raposo et al . , 2001 ) . Myo6 depletion resulted in increased DAMP codistribution with TYRP1 by IFM ( Fig . S5 E , arrowheads ) and increased DAMP labeling within pigmented melanosomes by IEM ( Fig . S5 , F and G , arrow - heads ) , indicating acidification of the melanosomal lumen . Together , these data indicate that the Myo6 - , WASH - , and optineurin - driven fission of recycling tubules is necessary to maintain the homeostasis of melanosomes . Given that organelle homeostasis is tightly linked to organ - elle function , we investigated if depleting Myo6 affects mela - nosome physiology . In skin , melanosomes support two critical tasks regarding pigmentation : ( 1 ) the synthesis and storage of melanin pigments within melanocytes and ( 2 ) the dispersion of melanin pigments throughout the epidermis after secretion and transfer to neighboring keratinocytes ( Delevoye , 2014 ) . As Myo6 depletion resulted in increased intracellular melanin content ( Fig . 6 B ) , we examined whether pigment release was affected . We first quantified melanin release into the medium by control - or Myo6 - depleted MNT - 1 cells treated with forsko - lin , a permeable activator of adenylyl cyclase that raises cAMP levels in melanocytes , and thus stimulates their pigmentation and secretion capacities ( Brenner and Hearing , 2008 ) , and observed a 32 ± 8 % decrease in pigment secretion upon Myo6 depletion ( Fig . 6 H ) . Then , using control - , Myo6 - , WASH1 - , or optineurin - depleted NHMs ( Fig . S5 H ) co - cultured with normal human keratinocytes ( NHKs ) , we evaluated the melanin transfer by IFM analysis ( Fig . 6 I and S5 I ; using labeling for amyloid fibrils with HMB45 antibody ; see Materials and methods ; Singh et al . , 2008 ) . Depletion of any of these components in NHMs decreased the frequency of HMB45 + NHKs ( Fig . 6 J ; siCtrl , 83 ± 5 % ; siMyo6 , 60 ± 1 % ; siWASH1 , 71 ± 3 % ; siOptn , 64 ± 1 % ) , and the co - cultured NHKs also harbored less melanin fluorescent signal than NHKs co - cultured with siCtrl - treated NHMs ( Fig . 6 K ) . Thus , the Myo6 - , WASH - , and optineurin - driven fission of recycling melanosomal tubules impacts the fate of melanosomes likely by regulating their homeostasis and function . Ripoll et al . Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2717 Discussion To maintain their identity and function , intracellular organelles constantly receive and export contents through membranous transport intermediates . Myosins and / or actin dynamics have been implicated in fission events at endosomes ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) , mitochondria ( De Vos et al . , 2005 ) , the TGN ( Miserey - Lenkei et al . , 2010 ) , and the plasma membrane during endocyto - sis ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Römer et al . , 2010 ; Taylor et al . , 2012 ) , but whether they remodel the membrane to promote severing is not known . Here , we report that the constriction and fission of tubules from melanosomes for cargo retrieval is mediated by Myo6 activity in collaboration with optineurin and WASH - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation . By releasing transport inter - mediates from melanosomes loaded with specific components , Myo6 - driven fission tunes the content , maturation , and ulti - mately secretion of melanosomes . Myo6 is a multitasking motor that can move organelles or vesi - cles along actin tracks or tether them to the cytoskeleton ( Altman et al . , 2004 ) . In melanocytes , Myo6 does not appear to facilitate melanosome movement but rather likely organizes and / or sta - bilizes F - actin ( Loubéry et al . , 2012 ) . Our data show that Myo6 codistributes with branched F - actin at melanosomal subdomains , suggesting that Myo6 can cross - link the melanosome to F - actin through its CBD and motor domain , respectively . Our CLEM and SR - IFM data suggest that Myo6 localizes most likely to the neck of emerging melanosomal tubules . Also , our functional data show that tubule constriction and fission are impaired by Myo6 deple - tion , inhibition of its motor activity , or expression of a motorless form . A mechanism for membrane fission named friction - driven scission has been recently proposed ( Simunovic et al . , 2017 ) and relies on the frictional forces generated by proteins at the neck of elongated tubules , which can then conduct their fission . Thus , by exerting forces on the actin network at the base of an elon - gated structure , Myo6 is ideally placed to constrict melanosomal tubules and to lead to their fission and release . Why would Myo6 and branched F - actin be specifically required for tubule constriction ? In mammals ( and in contrast to yeast ; Liu et al . , 2006 ; Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ) , actin is dispensable during clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis ( CME ) , except when cells internalize large particles , like pathogens ( Cureton et al . , 2009 ) , or when the plasma membrane is highly rigid ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) , as suggested for the apical plasma mem - brane in polarized cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , Myo6 Figure 5 . The WASH complex promotes melanosomal tubules constriction and fission .

Ripoll et al . Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2719 functions during the internalization of some bacteria ( Bonazzi et al . , 2011 ; Brooks et al . , 2017 ) and in CME , specifically at the apical membrane of polarized cells ( Buss et al . , 2001 ) , where tension is twofold higher than at the basolateral membrane ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Myo6 and F - actin might thus function in the remodeling of membranes with a large size and / or rigidity . Pigmented mela - nosome are 0 . 5 µm in length and filled with melanin polymer on a rigid amyloid matrix . Such a matrix might create an internal pressure imposing high stiffness to its limiting membrane that would be then difficult to remodel . The melanosomal tubules are unusually large compared with endosomal tubules and orient along the long axis of melanin - laden amyloid fibrils , suggesting that the membrane may be more deformable at the poles of the melanosome . Thus , Myo6 and actin might be required to exert high forces on a rigid membrane to complete tubule constriction , scission , and release . The WASH complex promotes the Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization on early endosomes to facilitate the release of recycling tubular intermediates in most cell types ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . In melanocytes , the WASH complex can be recruited to early endosomes ( Tyrrell et al . , 2016 ) but does not participate in the anterograde delivery of cargoes from endosomes to melanosomes ( Delevoye et al . , 2016 ; Ripoll et al . , 2016 ) . Consistently , gene targeting of the WASH complex subunit strumpellin in mice does not lead to hypopig - mentation ( Tyrrell et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , we show that Myo6 could interact with strumpellin in melanocytes . Also , the WASH complex associates with melanosomes and cooperates with Myo6 during the constriction and fission of recycling melanosomal tubules . Therefore , this might suggest that two coexisting WASH complexes can function in melanocytes to distinct organelles of endocytic origins , such as early endosomes and melanosomes . Proper cargo sorting from endomembranes ( Au et al . , 2007 ; Chibalina et al . , 2007 ; Carnell et al . , 2011 ; King et al . , 2013 ; Seaman et al . , 2013 ; Buckley et al . , 2016 ) and homeostatic regula - tion of lysosome and autophagosome size ( Chibalina et al . , 2007 ; Derivery et al . , 2012 ; Duleh and Welch , 2012 ; Tumbarello et al . , 2012 ) require branched F - actin polymerization , WASH activity , or Myo6 expression . Indeed , our previous study showed that melanosomes from Myo6 knockout mice are enlarged and hyper - pigmented ( Loubéry et al . , 2012 ) . This likely reflects , at least in part , the enrichment of components such as TYRP1 and VAMP7 and the failure to retrieve membrane via tubulation . The latter is consistent with studies showing that WASH or Myo6 depletion leads to enlarged endosomes devoid of tubules ( Chibalina et al . , 2007 ; Gomez et al . , 2012 ) . We hypothesize that a primary defect in membrane fission might secondarily result in cargo missort - ing leading to loss of organelle homeostasis and increased organ - elle size . Such aberrant organelles might ultimately be unable to recruit the machinery required for tubule initiation , perhaps explaining the defects in endosomal tubule formation observed in other cell types depleted of Myo6 or impaired for F - actin polymerization . Skin pigmentation and photoprotection depend on the trans - fer of pigmented melanosomes from melanocytes to keratino - cytes ( Delevoye , 2014 ; Wu and Hammer , 2014 ) . Here , we reveal a novel maturation step for melanosomes that impacts their extracellular release . Given that Arp2 / 3 , Myo6 , and optineurin control the docking and / or pore opening of secretory vesicles fusing with plasma membrane ( Gasman et al . , 2004 ; Bond et al . , 2011 ; Tran et al . , 2015 ) , it was conceivable that they might play a direct role during melanosome secretion in melanocytes . However , neither excessive melanosomes association with the plasma membrane nor unresolved fusion profiles were observed at the ultrastructural level in cells with Myo6 or WASH deple - tion , making their direct involvement in melanosome secretion unlikely . Rather , the data support the conclusion that exporting components from melanosomes is required before their matura - tion and secretion . How might recycling from melanosomes affect their secre - tion ? In addition to cargoes and melanin accumulation , we show that impairing the Myo6 - driven export pathway lowers the intraluminal pH of pigmented melanosomes . In melanocytes , neutralization of acidic early stage melanosomes by transporter such as OCA2 is required for melanization ( Bellono et al . , 2014 ) . Consequently , mature pigmented melanosomes become neutral ( Raposo et al . , 2001 ) and competent for secretion . Interestingly in Dictyostellium discoideum , lysosomes destined for exocytosis alkalinize their lumen through a WASH - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent retrieval of cargoes , including the vacuolar ATPase ( Carnell et al . , 2011 ; King et al . , 2013 ; Thomason et al . , 2017 ) . The export of vacuolar ATPase , which associates with melanosomes ( Tabata et al . , 2008 ) , might serve to raise the pH of melanosomes and promote their secretion . Other ion pumps and / or channels might also and nonexclusively follow this export route , such as the two - pore channel 2 that has been shown to regulate melanosome size , pH , and pigmentation ( Ambrosio et al . , 2016 ; Bellono et al . , 2016 ; Patwardhan and Delevoye , 2016 ) . Whether Myo6 cooperates with other motors during mem - brane constriction from melanosomes is not known . The micro - tubule and actin cytoskeletons aid the formation , elongation , and scission of tubular recycling intermediates from endosomes ( Delevoye et al . , 2016 ) . Similarly , the extension and delivery of melanosomal tubules to their target membranes likely requires microtubules and the pulling force exerted by kinesins or dynein . Moreover , additional myosins might cooperate with Myo6 to provide sufficient force for tubule fission from melanosomes . Interestingly during CME , type I myosins like the mammalian myosin 1E contributes , together with Arp2 / 3 and F - actin , to the internalization of cargo molecules ( Krendel et al . , 2007 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ) , perhaps by constricting the neck of the endocytic vesicles before scission as illustrated in yeast ( Idrissi et al . , 2012 ) . For instance in melanocytes , myosin Vc has been also proposed to regulate both melanosome cargo composition and melanosome secretion ( Bultema et al . , 2014 ) . Whether these myosins might operate at a similar step as Myo6 remains to be explored . The melanosomal tubules described here are very likely the same as those that we previously characterized to retrieve VAMP7 from melanosomes in mouse melanocytes ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) . Those require for their formation the biogenesis of LRO complex - 3 ( BLOC - 3 ; Dennis et al . , 2016 ) , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the cell type – specific RAB GTPases RAB32 and RAB38 ( Gerondopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , we previously showed that GFP - RAB38 and its effector , VARP , localize to one Ripoll et al . Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2720 subdomain on melanosomes from which the tubules emerged ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , Myo6 , optineurin , WASH and branched F - actin decorate around two subdomains on melanosomes . Some of them that label for optineurin or WASH do not contain Myo6 , suggesting that not all subdomains are productive ‘hot - spots’ for releasing tubules . The molecular details controlling local Myo6 recruitment and / or activity at the melanosome are not totally understood . However , whereas optineurin does not actively contribute to Myo6 recruitment , it likely regulates its activity . Therefore , it would be interest - ing to determine if RAB32 , RAB38 and / or VARP play a role in positioning Myo6 and / or its partners for the fission of mel - anosomal tubule . Thus , our data lead us to propose the following model ( Fig . 6 L ) in which Myo6 is precisely positioned at the neck of emerging melanosomal tubules , formed after the activation of RAB38 and / or RAB32 on melanosomes by BLOC - 3 . The WASH complex then directly activates locally the Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin nucleation on melanosomes , allowing Myo6 to cross - link F - actin at the neck . Myo6 activity here might be positively regulated by optineurin and produces the necessary force to constrict and pro - mote the fission and release of the tubule . The released tubules recycle VAMP7 for its possible reuse ( Dennis et al . , 2016 ) and likely also export additional components to allow for further mel - anosome maturation . We propose that such maturation may be required for late events in melanosome biology , including trans - fer to keratinocytes . Altogether , our current work identifies a new function for Myo6 and branched F - actin in the constriction of membranes , leading to the fission and release of transport carriers required for the function of organelles . Understanding if Myo6 can sim - ilarly remodel membranes others than at melanosomes , how membrane rigidity could impact Myo6 function , and whether such constricting activity might be targeted in diseases deserve further scrutiny in future studies .

To inhibit myosin II activity , cells were incubated 60 min with 50 µM para - nitroblebbistatin ( Optopharma ; a gift from S . Miserey - Lenkei , Institut Curie , Paris , France ) . For the incubation with DAMP , cells were starved 30 min with serum - free medium ( Opti - MEM ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , incubated 30 min with 30 µM DAMP ( Invitrogen ) at 37°C , and then washed with cold medium before fixation . Western blot Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 10 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 2 ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Lysates were incubated with sample buffer , boiled 5 min , loaded on 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gels ( Nu - PAGE ; Invitrogen ) , and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were blocked in PBS / 0 . 1 % Tween with 5 % nonfat dried milk , incubated with indicated primary and secondary antibodies diluted in PBS / 0 . 1 % Tween . Western blots were developed using the ECL SuperSignal West Pico or Dura ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The presented immunoblots were representative of at least three independent experiments . Immunoprecipitation MNT - 1 cells seeded on 10 - cm dishes ( two per condition ) were transfected with respective GFP - fusion protein encoding plas - mids . The day after , cells were lysed 20 min on ice in 1 ml IP buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , 50 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , pH 7 . 4 , and supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ; Roche ) . Cells were scrapped and the lysates were centrifuged 15 min at 13 , 200 rpm ( 4°C ) . 50 µl of the postnuclear supernatant was collected ( input ) , whereas the rest was incubated for 2 h under rotation ( 4°C ) with 10 µl prewashed GFP - Trap _ A beads ( Chromotek ) . Then , beads were washed three times in IP buffer , and inputs and beads were incubated with 50 µl and 40 µl of sample buffer , respectively , and boiled for 5 min . The presented immunoblots are representative of at least three independent experiments . Melanosome isolation MNT - 1 cells seeded on 10 - cm dishes ( two per condition ) were col - lected , pelleted , and suspended in melanosome buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 M EGTA , and 0 . 02 % sodium azide , pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 0 . 25 M sucrose and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer . Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 600 g ( 4°C ) , and the supernatant was collected and loaded on 2 M sucrose diluted in melanosome buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 11 , 000 g ( 4°C ) . The melanosome - enriched fraction was carefully recovered and centrifuged 60 min at 100 , 000 g ( 4°C ) . The pellet was suspended 20 min in lysis buffer on ice , the pro - tein concentration was measured ( Pierce BCA protein assay kit ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and samples were diluted to obtain similar concentration before Western blot analysis . The pre - sented immunoblots are representative of at least three inde - pendent experiments . Melanin estimation For intracellular melanin content , MNT - 1 cells seeded on 6 - cm dishes were sonicated in melanin buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 2 mM EDTA , and 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Melanin was pelleted for 15 min at 16 , 000 g ( 4°C ) , rinsed in ethanol / diethyl ether ( 1 : 1 ) , and dis - solved in 2 M NaOH / 20 % DMSO at 60°C . The optical density at 490 nm was measured to estimate melanin content . For extracel - lular melanin , MNT - 1 cells were seeded on 10 - cm dishes at day 1 , transfected with siRNAs on days 3 and 5 , and incubated with 30 µM forskolin on day 5 . Supernatants were recovered before each siRNA transfection and pooled on day 8 before centrifuga - tion for 10 min at 600 g ( 4°C ) . Melanin was pelleted for 15 min at 16 , 000 g ( 4°C ) , washed carefully with ethanol / diethyl ether ( 1 : 1 ) , and dissolved in 2 M NaOH / 20 % DMSO at 60°C . The opti - cal density at 490 nm was measured and normalized to protein concentration . Intracellular melanin was quantified as well , and the secreted melanin corresponds to the ratio between extra - and intracellular melanin . IF and superresolution microscopy MNT - 1 cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 30 s in PBS / 0 . 02 % Saponin to extract the cytosol and then fixed for 15 min at RT with 4 % PFA . Cells were incubated with PBS / 2 % BSA ( blocking buffer ) and permeabilized in PBS / 2 % BSA / 0 . 1 % saponin ( permeabilization buffer ) before primary and second - ary antibody incubation in permeabilization buffer . Cells were washed in permeabilizing buffer and then in blocking buffer , and coverslips were mounted in DAB CO medium . Coverslips were analyzed on a wide - field microscope ( Eclipse 80i Upright ; Nikon ) equipped with a CCD camera ( CoolSNAP HQ2 ; Photo - metrics ) using a 100× 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apo objective lens . Z images series were acquired every 0 . 2 µm with the piezoelectric motor ( Physik Instrumente ) using MetaMorph software ( version 7 . 8 . 13 ; MDS Analytical Technologies ) . Raw images were decon - volved with Meinel algorithm ( PICT - IBiSA imaging platform at Institut Curie ) . For transfer assay , coverslips were acquired on a wide - field microscope ( Eclipse 90i Upright ) equipped with a CCD camera ( CoolSNAP HQ2 ) and using a 60× 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apo objective lens . Z images series were acquired every 0 . 2 µm with the piezoelectric motor ( Physik Instrumente ) using MetaMorph software ( version 7 . 8 . 13 ) . For superresolution microscopy , images were acquired on a spinning disk system ( Gataca Systems ) based on an inverted microscope ( Ti - E ; Nikon ) equipped with a sCMOS camera ( Prime 95B ; Photometrics ) , a confocal spinning head ( X1 ; Yokogawa ) , a 100× 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apo objective lens , and a super - resolution module ( Live - SR ; Gataca systems ) based on structured illumination with optical reassignment technique and online processing leading to a two - time resolution improvement ( Roth and Heintzmann , 2016 ) . The method , called multifocal structured illumination microscopy ( York et al . , 2012 ) , allows combining the doubling resolution together with the physical optical sectioning of confocal microscopy . The maximum resolution is 128 nm with a pixel size in superresolution mode of 64 nm . For live - cell super - resolution , cells were imaged in Opti - MEM medium at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 using MetaMorph software ( version 7 . 8 . 13 ) . Ripoll et al . Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2722 Live - cell imaging MNT - 1 cells were seeded on a FluoroDish ( World Precision Instruments ) and imaged in Opti - MEM medium on an inverted microscope ( Ti - E ) with a confocal spinning head ( X1 ) equipped with an EMC CD camera ( iXon 897 ; Andor Technology ) , a 100× 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apo objective lens , and a temperature and CO 2 control system ( 37°C and 5 % CO 2 ; Life Imaging Service ) . The acquisition parameters used were 200 - ms exposure for GFP and mCherry channels . Movies were acquired on a single z plane for 40 s in stream mode , allowing acquisition at very fast rates , using MetaMorph software ( version 7 . 8 . 13 ) . EM MNT - 1 cells cultured on carbonated sapphire disks or CryoCap - sules ( CryoCapCell ; Heiligenstein et al . , 2014 ) were transfected with control , Myo6 , or WASH siRNAs or treated for 60 min with 25 µM DMSO or TIP . Cell were high - pressure frozen with HPM100 ( Leica Microsystems ) or HPM Live μ ( CryoCapCell ) and then freeze substituted in anhydrous acetone containing 1 % OsO4 / 2 % H 2 O for 64 h in a freeze substitution system ( AFS ; Leica Microsystems ) . Cells were embedded in epon 812 ( TAAB Laboratories Equipment ) and processed for sectioning and con - trasting with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . Ultrathin sections were observed at 80 kV transmission electron microscope ( Tec - nai Spirit G2 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) equipped with a QUE MESA CCD camera ( EMS IS ) using iTEM software ( EMS IS ) . For ultrathin cryosections and immunogold labeling , MNT - 1 cells were grown on six - well plates and fixed with 2 % PFA / 0 . 2 % glu - taraldehyde / 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer . Cells pellets were embedded in 10 % gelatin and infused in 2 . 3 M sucrose . Gelatin blocks were frozen and processed for ultracryomicrotomy . Ultrathin sections ( 90 nm ) were double - immunogold labeled using PAG 10 or 15 nm and analyzed by EM as described above . CLEM MNT - 1 cells were grown on CryoCapsules ( Heiligenstein et al . , 2014 ) and transfected with GFP - Myo6 - CBD . The day after , cells were high - pressure frozen using HPM100 ( Leica Microsystems ) and freeze - substituted for 12 h with 0 . 01 % uranyl acetate / 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde / 1 % H 2 O in anhydrous acetone ( Hurbain et al . , 2017 ) . Cells were embedded in Lowicryl and processed for sec - tioning . 300 - nm - thick sections were mounted with Hoechst con - taining PBS / 50 % glycerol and analyzed with an epifluorescence microscope ( Te2000 ; Nikon ) equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera using 60× 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apo objective lens . The fluo - rescent images were processed on ImageJ Fiji using the Smooth and Subtract Background commands , and the Extended Depth of Fields plugin . Sections were then acquired at the electron micro - scope , and fluorescent signal and electron micrograph were over - laid using eC - CLEM software ( Paul - Gilloteaux et al . , 2017 ) on Icy . Electron tomography Thick sections were randomly labeled on the two sides with PAG 10 nm . Tilt series ( two perpendicular series , angular range from −60° to + 65° with 1° increment ) on area containing a GFP - Myo6 - CBD + melanosome were recorded using EMtools ( TVI PS ) on a 200 - kV transmission electron microscope ( Tecnai 20 LaB6 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and used for reconstructing tomo - grams . Projection images ( 2 , 024 × 2 , 024 pixels ) were acquired with CCD camera ( Temcam F214 ; TVI PS ) . After acquisition of the first tilt series , the grid was rotated over an angle of 90° and the second tilt series of the same area was recorded . Tilt series alignment and tomogram computing ( resolution - weighted back projection ) were performed using eTomo ( IMOD ) software . PAG 10 nm at the surface of the sections was used as fiducial markers . Manual contouring of the melanosomal membrane of the tomo - grams was performed using IMOD . Melanin transfer assay NHMs seeded in 10 - cm dishes at day 1 were transfected twice with control or Myo6 siRNAs at day 3 and day 5 . At the end of day 5 , NHMs were trypsinized , counted , and same amount were co - cultured with NHKs ( 1 : 1 ) on coverslips . NHKs alone were cul - tured on coverslips to estimate steady - state melanin content ( see below ) . Because of the faster division rate of NHK as compared with NHMs , the NHM / NHK ratio is ∼ 1 : 5 at day 8 . Cells were then fixed with 4 % PFA and processed for IFM using anti - HMB45 ( red ; recognizing fibrils onto which melanin is deposited ) and anti - EGFR ( green ; EGF receptor expressed only in NHKs ) antibodies to label melanin and NHKs , respectively . Z - stacks images from bottom to top of NHK were acquired using wide - field microscope ( see above ) . Maximum - intensity z projections of the stacks were generated for the two channels and background fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the total intensity . In the green channel , regions of interests were drawn to delineate NHKs , duplicated in the red channel to measure the mean intensity of fluorescence of HMB45 ( ImageJ Fiji ) . Measurements were done in co - culture experiments and in single NHK culture . The mean intensity of HMB45 fluorescence obtained in single NHK culture was subtracted from the HMB45 fluorescence intensity measured in co - culture experiments . Percentage of HMB45 + NHKs was defined as the number of NHKs with at least one HMB45 fluorescent spot divided by the total number of NHKs per experiment . Image analysis and quantification Analysis and quantification of mCh - VAMP7 + tubules mCh - VAMP7 – expressing MNT - 1 cells were analyzed on a spin - ning - disk microscope and acquired in stream mode for 40 s ( 200 frames at 200 - ms exposure ) . Using ImageJ Fiji , 100 × 100 – pixel ( 256 - µm 2 ) regions were selected at cell periphery to detect isolated melanosomes . Images were processed using subtract background ( 50 - pixel radius ) and Smooth commands . The rel - ative number of mCh - VAMP7 + melanosomal tubules was man - ually counted during the 40 - s acquisitions ( corresponding to 200 frames of 0 . 2 s ) in which they were observed . Among these tubules , the respective number of tubules that were detected as emerging ( referred as tubules emerging from melanosomes ) and / or detaching ( referred as tubules undergoing fission ) from melanosomes was quantified . The time of release corresponds to the mean number of frames per experiment during which the tubules were detected until their detachment from melano - somes and multiplied by 0 . 2 s ( duration time of each frame ) to obtain temporal values ( s ) . The percentage of released tubules Ripoll et al . Myosin VI constricts the membrane of tubular carriers Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201709055 2723 was measured by dividing the number of tubules detaching from melanosomes by the total number of tubules detected per experiment . Linescan analysis MNT - 1 cells coexpressing GFP - Myo6 - CBD and mCh - VAMP7 were analyzed by live SR - FM . On mCh - VAMP7 + melanosomes positive for GFP - Myo6 - CBD and harboring a tubule , a line selection of 30 pixels ( 1 , 920 nm ) was drawn across the melanosome and its asso - ciated tubule on ImageJ Fiji . Linear pixels values were measured using Plot Profile function and presented as percentage of the maximum value . For fixed cells analyzed by SR - IFM , a line selec - tion of 30 pixels ( 1 , 920 nm ) was drawn across a TYRP1 + melano - some and one associated spot of the indicated protein . Spot detection Spots of endogenous Myo6 , optineurin , WASH1 , p34 , or cortac - tin per melanosome were detected using Spot Detector plugin on Icy . 15 - pixel ( 960 - nm ) - diameter circles were drawn around TYRP1 + melanosomes and the number of detected spots per circle was measured . The percentage of melanosomes + for spots cor - responds to the number of melanosomes with at least one spot divided by the total number of melanosomes analyzed per cell . Pearson’s correlation coefficient Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two channels was quantified using JACoP plugin of ImageJ Fiji from one frame of the live - cell acquisition . As a negative control , similar mea - sures were performed after 30° rotation of the GFP channel on the same images . GFP - Myo6 - CBD spots associated with melanosome MNT - 1 cells transfected with GFP - Myo6 - CBD and mCh - VAMP7 were analyzed by spinning - disk microscopy . Images were pro - cessed using the Subtract Background command ( 3 - and 10 - pixel radius for GFP and mCherry channels , respectively ) on ImageJ Fiji . A random selection of GFP - Myo6 - CBD + spots were analyzed per cell and considered as associated with melanosome if they displayed overlapping pixels with mCh - VAMP7 . The number of GFP - Myo6 - CBD spots that associated with melanosomes was then divided by the total number of spots analyzed per cell and was expressed as a percentage . Overlapping spots at melanosome and Manders overlap coefficient MNT - 1 cells expressing GFP - Myo6 - CBD were processed by SR - IFM using anti - TYRP1 ( blue ; to label melanosomes ) and anti – optineurin or anti – WASH1 ( red ) antibodies . Z - stacks images were acquired every 0 . 15 µm . 15 - pixel ( 960 - nm ) – diameter circles were drawn around melanosomes positive for Myo6 / optineurin or Myo6 / WASH1 . Maximum intensity z projections of three stacks were generated for the three channels in the 15 - pixel circles . Number of these melanosomes with overlapping pixels between green and red channels was measured , and this number was then divided by the total number of quantified melanosomes per cell and expressed as a percentage . On these melanosomes , the Manders overlap coefficient was quantified using JACoP plugin on ImageJ Fiji and corresponds to the fraction of the green signal ( Myo6 ) overlapping with the red signal ( optineurin or WASH1 ) . Quantification and analysis of tubules on EM sections Quantification of tubules was based on their ultrastructure ; a tubular membrane in continuity with the limiting membrane of melanosome was defined as a tubule connected to melanosome . Number of melanosomes with tubule per cell was quantified manually and divided by the total number of pigmented mela - nosomes per cell and was expressed as a percentage . The length of tubules was measured by drawing a line from the base to the extremity of the tubule , and the width of the neck by drawing a line covering the base ( corresponding to the neck ) of the tubule . To determine the orientation of the melanosomal tubule relative to the internal fibrils , two lines were drawn : one along the long axis of the internal fibrils within melanosome ( and referred to 0° ) and a second crossing the tubule along its maximum length . The angle between the two lines was measured using Icy . Tubules from control or Myo6 - depleted cells were analyzed . Immunogold labeling Quantification of immunogold labeling on ultrathin cryosections was performed by counting the number of gold particles per pig - mented melanosome . Pigmented melanosomes were defined by their morphology and the presence of electron dense melanin in their lumen ( Raposo et al . , 2001 ) . Number of melanosomes stained with at least one gold particle was divided by the total number of melanosomes counted per cell and per section . The count was performed on randomly selected cells . Immunoblot quantification Quantification of protein expression levels on immunoblot was performed using ImageJ Fiji software and intensities were nor - malized to the siCtrl bands . Quantifications were from at least three independent experiments . Statistical analysis Statistical data are presented as mean ± SEM . Statistics were calculated using unpaired Student’s t test , or ordinary one - way ANO VA when specified , in GraphPad Prism . Significant differ - ences between control or treated samples are indicated ( * * * * , P < 0 . 0001 ; * * * , P < 0 . 001 ; * * , P < 0 . 01 ; * , P < 0 . 05 ) . Only P < 0 . 05 was considered as statistically significant . Online supplemental material Fig .
