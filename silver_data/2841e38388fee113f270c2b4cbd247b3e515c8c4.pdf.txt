Here , we dissect subcellular 16 roles of actin in ciliogenesis by focusing on actin networks nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex in 17 the powerful ciliary model , Chlamydomonas . We find the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for the 18 initial stages of ciliary assembly when protein and membrane are in high demand but cannot yet 19 be supplied from the Golgi complex . We provide evidence for Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent 20 endocytosis of ciliary proteins , an increase in endocytic activity upon induction of ciliary growth , 21 and relocalization of plasma membrane proteins to newly formed cilia . Our data support a new 22 model of ciliary protein and membrane trafficking during early ciliogenesis whereby proteins 23 previously targeted to the plasma membrane are reclaimed by Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent 24 endocytosis for initial ciliary assembly . 25 3 INTRODUCTION 26 The cilium of the unicellular , green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has long been used 27 as a model due to its structural and mechanistic conservation relative to mammalian cilia . Cilia 28 consist of microtubules that extend from the cell surface and are ensheathed in plasma 29 membrane . Their assembly relies on microtubule dynamics and trafficking of protein and 30 membrane ( Nachury et al . , 2010 ) , as well as intraflagellar transport ( IFT ) , a motor - based 31 transport system that moves tubulin and other cargo through the cilium ( Pedersen and 32 Rosenbaum , 2008 ) . 33 Although cilia are composed of microtubules and depend on them for assembly , the 34 mechanisms governing ciliary maintenance and assembly extend to other cytoskeletal proteins , 35 like actin . The microtubule organizing center , the centrosome , from which cilia are nucleated 36 functions as an actin organizer ( Farina et al . , 2016 ; Inoue et al . , 2019 ) . In mammalian cells , 37 cortical actin disruption results in increased ciliary length and percentage of ciliated cells ( Kim et 38 al . , 2010 ; Park et al . , 2008 ) , and when ciliogenesis is triggered by serum starvation , preciliary 39 vesicles are trafficked to the centriole where they fuse to form a ciliary vesicle around the 40 budding cilium . In intracellular ciliogenesis , when Arp2 / 3 complex - branched actin is lost , vesicle 41 fusion defects lead to depletion of preciliary vesicles at the centriole , suggesting a role for 42 branched actin in intracellular ciliogenesis ( Wu et al . , 2018 ) . Further , actin itself has been found 43 within cilia , suggesting that actin is a key protein in ciliary maintenance and assembly ( Kiesel et 44 al . , 2020 ) . 45 Chlamydomonas cells are ideal for tackling the question of actin - dependent ciliary 46 trafficking due to their lack of a cortical actin network and their ability to undergo consistent and 47 robust ciliogenesis without requiring serum starvation . In Chlamydomonas , disruption of actin 48 networks with Cytochalasin D resulted in short cilia ( Dentler and Adams , 1992 ) and disruption 49 with Latrunculin B ( LatB ) , which sequesters monomers leading to filament depolymerization , 50 resulted in short cilia and impaired regeneration ( Avasthi et al . , 2014 ; Jack et al . , 2019 ) . 51 Chlamydomonas actin networks are required for accumulation of IFT machinery at the base of 52 cilia and for entry of IFT material into cilia ( Avasthi et al . , 2014 ) , as well as for trafficking of post - 53 Golgi vesicles to cilia , synthesis of ciliary proteins , and organization of the ciliary gating region 54 ( Jack et al . , 2019 ) . Many advances in our understanding of the relationship between cilia and 55 actin were discovered using Chlamydomonas . 56 The actin cytoskeleton of Chlamydomonas contains two actin genes : IDA5 , a 57 conventional actin with 91 % sequence identity to human b - actin ; and NAP1 , a divergent actin 58 that shares only 63 % of its sequence with human b - actin ( Hirono et al . , 2003 ; Kato - Minoura et 59 al . , 1998 ) . We consider NAP1 to be an actin - like protein as opposed to an actin related protein 60 ( ARP ) because it has a higher sequency identity to actin than to conventional ARPs and 61 because it is able to functionally compensate for the conventional IDA5 ( Jack et al . , 2019 ; 62 Onishi et al . , 2019 , 2018 , 2016 ) . Under normal , vegetative conditions , IDA5 is the primary actin 63 expressed , but when cells are treated with LatB , the LatB - insensitive NAP1 is upregulated 64 ( Hirono et al . , 2003 ; Onishi et al . , 2018 , 2016 ) . This separability of the two actins led to the 65 discovery that they can compensate for each other in ciliary maintenance and assembly ( Jack et 66 al . , 2019 ) . Studies of actin’s role in ciliary assembly used global disruption , knocking out either 67 one of the filamentous actins or acutely knocking out both , yet actin networks have diverse 68 compositions and topologies that lead to specific subfunctions within cells . 69 Actin networks rely on actin binding proteins that contribute to the formation , 70 arrangement , and function of the networks . One such actin binding protein is the Arp2 / 3 71 complex , which nucleates branched or dendritic networks . These networks are often involved in 72 membrane remodeling functions , like lamellipodia and endocytosis ( Campellone and Welch , 73 2010 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of 7 subunits : Arp2 , Arp3 , and ARPC1 - 5 ( Figure S1 ) . Each 74 subunit plays a specific role of varying importance in the nucleation process . ARPC2 and 75 ARPC4 form the complex core and the primary contacts with the mother filament , Arp2 and 76 4 Arp3 serve as the first subunits of the daughter filament , and ARPC1 and ARPC3 play a role in 77 nucleation but are not critical for branch formation ( Gournier et al . , 2001 ; Robinson et al . , 2001 ) . 78 Each of these subunits is found in Chlamydomonas , but they have a range of sequence 79 homologies compared to conventional Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Figure S1 ) . The ARPC5 subunit has 80 yet to be found in Chlamydomonas . ARPC5 is thought to be important for the association of 81 ARPC1 to the complex , but a mammalian complex lacking ARPC5 and ARPC1 maintains some 82 nucleating and branching activity and is able to cross - link actin ( Gournier et al . , 2001 ) . 83 Here , using the chemical inhibitor CK - 666 to inhibit the nucleating function of the Arp2 / 3 84 complex ( Hetrick et al . , 2013 ) and a genetic mutant of a critical Arp2 / 3 complex member , 85 ARPC4 ( Cheng et al . , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2019 ) , we take a more delicate approach to investigating 86 the actin’s in ciliary assembly by separating different actin networks into their subfunctions 87 based on topology . Specifically , we probe the involvement of actin networks nucleated by the 88 Arp2 / 3 complex in ciliary maintenance and assembly . This approach in these cells has allowed 89 us to propose a new model implicating a subset of filamentous actin in redistribution of 90 membrane and proteins for the initial stages of ciliogenesis . 91 92 RESULTS 93 Loss of Arp2 / 3 complex function inhibits normal regeneration and maintenance of cilia : 94 To investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin networks in ciliary assembly , 95 we used two tools . First , we used the chemical inhibitor CK - 666 which blocks the nucleating 96 ability of the Arp2 / 3 complex by binding the interface between Arp2 and Arp3 and locking the 97 complex in an inactive state ( Hetrick et al . , 2013 ) . The Arp2 and Arp3 subunits of the 98 Chlamydomonas Arp2 / 3 complex are 75 . 1 % and 61 . 5 % similar to mammalian Arp2 / 3 complex 99 respectively ( Figure S1 ) . This , along with the ability of CK - 666 to recapitulate the effects of a 100 genetic mutant of the Arp2 / 3 complex , suggest that CK - 666 can target Chlamydomonas Arp2 / 3 101 complex . Second , we obtained a loss of function mutant of the critical Arp2 / 3 complex member , 102 ARPC4 from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center ( Cheng et al . , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2019 ) . The 103 arpc4 mutant was confirmed via PCR and further evaluated using a genetic rescue where a V5 - 104 tagged ARPC4 construct is expressed in arpc4 mutant cells , arpc4 : ARPC4 - V5 . This was 105 confirmed via PCR , western blot , and immunofluorescence ( Figure S1C - E ) . While we can 106 confirm the presence of ARPC4 - V5 with immunofluorescence , the actual localization of ARPC4 - 107 V5 is not discernable due to diffuse signal ( Figure S1E ) . This could be because all ARPC4 - V5 108 in the cell is not being incorporated into active Arp2 / 3 complexes . 109 We probed the requirement for the Arp2 / 3 complex in maintenance of cilia by treating 110 cells with CK - 666 or the inactive control CK - 689 for 2 hours until cilia reached a new steady 111 state length . Consistent with previous results ( Avasthi et al . , 2014 ) , CK - 666 decreased ciliary 112 length ( Figure 1A ) . We saw no changes with the inactive CK - 689 ( Figure 1A ) or when arpc4 113 mutant cells lacking a functional Arp2 / 3 complex were treated with CK - 666 ( Figure 1A ) . 114 Untreated arpc4 mutant cells recapitulate the CK - 666 result , showing decreased ciliary length 115 when compared to wild - type cells ( Figure 1B ) . This defect in ciliary length was rescuable with 116 ARPC4 - V5 ( Figure 1B ) . Overall , this suggests the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for normal ciliary 117 maintenance . 118 Next , we explored the involvement of the Arp2 / 3 complex in ciliary assembly where 119 protein and membrane both from existing pools and from synthesis are in high demand ( Diener 120 et al . , 2015 ; Jack et al . , 2019 ; Nachury et al . , 2010 ; Rohatgi and Snell , 2010 ; Wingfield et al . , 121 2017 ) . Cells were deciliated by low pH shock and allowed to synchronously regenerate cilia at 122 normal pH ( Lefebvre , 1995 ) . arpc4 mutant cells were slow to regenerate cilia , and roughly 60 % 123 of cells did not regrow cilia ( Figure 1C - D ) . This phenotype was rescued by with ARPC4 - V5 124 ( Figure 1C - D ) . Importantly , the most severe defect in assembly is in initial steps when existing 125 protein and membrane are being incorporated into cilia . 126 5 The striking decrease in ciliary assembly is puzzling because loss of the Arp2 / 3 127 complex , and therefore only a subset of actin filaments , results in a more dramatic phenotype 128 than nap1 mutants treated with LatB , which lack all filamentous actins ( Jack et al . , 2019 ) . 129 However , in arpc4 mutant cells , a functional Arp2 / 3 complex never exists . In nap1 mutant cells 130 treated with LatB , treatment begins shortly after deciliation resulting in an acute perturbation . 131 Further , LatB functions by sequestering actin monomers to promote filament disassembly , and 132 the effects may not be immediate ( Spector et al . , 1989 ) . Thus , there is likely a brief window 133 where actin filaments can assert their initial role in ciliary regeneration before being 134 depolymerized . To avoid this , we began LatB treatment in nap1 mutants 30 minutes before 135 deciliation , which allowed us to observe what happens when actin is not present immediately 136 after deciliation . We see slightly decreased ciliary length consistent with the acute treatment but 137 dramatically decreased percent ciliation , which is consistent with the arpc4 mutant results 138 ( Figure 1E - F ) . 139 Treatment with CK - 666 , an Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor , gives a similar result . In cells 140 treated with CK - 666 immediately following deciliation , the Arp2 / 3 complex may assert its role in 141 assembly before being inhibited by CK - 666 . By pre - treating cells with CK - 666 for 1 hour before 142 deciliation , we can observe what happens when Arp2 / 3 complex function is lost immediately 143 following deciliation . When we do so , we see a more dramatic defect in ciliary length and 144 percent ciliation than we do with just acute CK - 666 treatment ( Figure 1G - H ) , suggesting the 145 Arp2 / 3 complex is required for a very early initial step of assembly that occurs before we have a 146 chance to treat the cells . 147 148 6 149 Figure 1 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for normal ciliary maintenance and assembly .

For every time point P > 0 . 0001 between 162 DMSO and treated samples , except 30min ( 10µM LatB ) which is ns . G - H ) Wild - type cells were pre - treated with CK - 163 666 or the inactive CK - 689 ( 100µM ) for 1 hour before deciliation of treated with CK - 666 or the inactive CK - 689 ( 100µM ) 164 following deciliation . Ciliary length ( G ) and percent ciliation were measured ( H ) . Error bars represent 95 % confidence 165 interval ( G ) or standard deviation ( H ) . n = 30 ( G ) or n = 100 ( H ) for 3 separate experiments . 166 167 The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for the incorporation of existing membrane and proteins 168 for ciliary assembly : 169 There are several actin - dependent steps of ciliary assembly , including incorporation of 170 existing protein and membrane and synthesis and trafficking of new protein for cilia . Using a 171 method to label nascent peptides , we found that loss of ARPC4 did not prevent upregulation of 172 translation following deciliation ( Figure S3 ) . In this experiment , we halt translation and 173 fluorescently label newly translated polypeptides . Wild - type and arpc4 mutant cells were tested 174 using this reaction either before deciliation , following deciliation and one hour of regrowth , or 175 following deciliation and one hour of regrowth in cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which inhibits protein 176 synthesis by blocking the elongation step of protein translation . Wild - type and arpc4 mutant 177 cells displayed an increase in cell fluorescence following deciliation , especially around the 178 nucleus , indicating an increase in protein synthesis following deciliation ( Figure S3 ) . 179 Importantly , this increase in cell fluorescence was not significantly different between wild - type 180 and arpc4 mutant cells , suggesting loss of Arp2 / 3 complex function does not prevent 181 upregulation of protein synthesis following deciliation . This also indicates arpc4 mutant cells are 182 aware their cilia were lost , as they respond with increased protein synthesis . 183 Given that arpc4 mutant cells respond to deciliation with protein synthesis , another 184 possible role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in ciliary assembly is the incorporation of a pool of existing 185 proteins and membrane , which is actin - dependent ( Jack et al . , 2019 ) . Further , disruption of 186 Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin networks results in slow initial ciliary assembly , when it is likely 187 that existing protein is being incorporated . We tested this by treating cells with cycloheximide 188 ( Figure 2A , S2 ) ( Rosenbaum et al . , 1969 ) . Without protein synthesis , there is no trafficking or 189 incorporation of new proteins . So , any ciliary growth we see is due to incorporation of existing 190 protein alone . Normally , cells that are deciliated and treated with cycloheximide grow cilia to 191 about half - length within 2 hours ( Figure 2B ) . In arpc4 mutant cells treated with cycloheximide , 192 cilia display minimal growth ; throughout a 5 - hour period , only 6 % of cells grew cilia ( Figure 2B ) . 193 This suggests the Arp2 / 3 complex is indispensable for incorporation of existing protein and 194 membrane during ciliary assembly . 195 We suspected arpc4 mutant cells either lacked the normal pool of ciliary precursor 196 proteins or were unable to incorporate it . However , the inability of the genetic mutants to 197 regenerate in cycloheximide prevents us from doing the typical studies testing new protein 198 synthesis , precursor pool size , and new protein incorporation outlined in Jack et al . 2018 as they 199 require regeneration in cycloheximide . To get around this , we used an acute perturbation , 200 chemical inhibition in wild - type cells that have a normal ciliary precursor pool ( as evidenced by 201 their ability to grow to half - length in cycloheximide ) . Cells were deciliated and then CK - 666 was 202 added ( in addition to cycloheximide ) only for regrowth . Thus , the CK - 666 could not affect 203 precursor pool size . Cells treated with CK - 666 and cycloheximide could not incorporate the 204 precursor pool we know exists in these wild - type cells into cilia , while cilia of cells treated with 205 8 only cycloheximide or cycloheximide and the inactive control , CK - 689 grew to half length 206 ( Figures 2C - D , S2 ) . This suggests the problem with incorporation in cells lacking a functional 207 Arp2 / 3 complex lies outside of availability of the precursor pool . 208 209 210 Figure 2 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for incorporation of existing protein during ciliary assembly . A ) 211 Treating cells with cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis , which means only incorporation of existing protein into the 212 cilia is observed . B ) Wild - type cells and arpc4 mutants were deciliated and allowed to regrow in 10 µ M CHX . The 213 percentages above the lines represent the percent of cells with cilia at the indicated time points . The mean is shown 214 with error bars representing 95 % confidence interval . n = 30 for each strain and each time point in 3 separate 215 experiments . For every time point besides 0 min , P < 0 . 0001 for both length and percent ciliation . C ) Wild - type cells 216 were deciliated and then treated with a combination of 10 µ M cycloheximide ( CHX ) and CK - 666 ( 100 µ M or 250 µ M ) or 217 CK - 689 ( the inactive control , 250µM ) at the same concentration during regrowth . The mean is shown with error bars 218 representing 95 % confidence interval . n = 30 for each strain and each time point in 3 separate experiments .

D ) The length of cilia after 2 hours of treatment and regrowth . Superplot 221 shows the mean of 3 separate experiments with error bars representing standard deviation . n = 30 for each treatment 222 group 3 separate experiments . 223 224 Cilia of arpc4 mutant cells resorb faster in the absence of the Golgi : 225 Because we see defects in ciliary assembly and maintenance when cells are likely 226 incorporating existing protein , and we know the protein needed for assembly is in excess due to 227 our acute perturbations with CK - 666 , we next investigated the membrane required for assembly . 228 This is of particular interest as the Arp2 / 3 complex is often involved in membrane remodeling . 229 Typically , the Golgi is thought to be the main source of membrane for cilia ( Nachury et al . , 2010 ; 230 Rohatgi and Snell , 2010 ) , and ciliary membrane , membrane proteins , and some axonemal 231 proteins are transported in or attached to vesicles in cytosol ( Wood and Rosenbaum , 2014 ) . In 232 Chlamydomonas , this has been demonstrated by the ciliary shortening of cells treated with 233 Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , a drug that causes Golgi collapse by interfering with ER to Golgi transport 234 ( Dentler , 2013 ) . To determine if the Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in trafficking of new protein from 235 the Golgi to cilia , we examined the Golgi following deciliation using transmission electron 236 microscopy in arpc4 mutants ( Figure S4A ) . The Golgi appeared grossly normal , had the same 237 A Synthesis Trafficking Incorporation CHX T B C CHX wild - type arpc4 mutant 67 % 59 % 61 % 61 % 58 % 66 % 81 % 2 % 4 % 3 % 6 % 3 % C ili a r y Leng t h ( (cid:43) m ) a t 2h r po s t - de c ili a t i o n CHX CK - 689 CK - 666 - - - + 250 (cid:43) M - + - 100 (cid:43) M + - 250 (cid:43) M + - - 024681012141618 20 ns P = 0 . 0062 P < 0 . 0001 D Pre 0 30 60 90 120 02468101214161820 Time ( min ) C ili a r y Leng t h ( (cid:43) m ) CHXCHX + CK - 689 ( 250 M ) CHX + CK - 666 ( 100 M ) CHX + CK - 666 ( 250 M ) Pre 0 60 120 180 240 300 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Time ( min ) C ili a r y Leng t h ( (cid:43) m ) 9 number of cisternae , and did not show an accumulation of post - Golgi membrane as previously 238 reported when perturbing filamentous actin ( Jack et al . , 2019 ) ( Figures S4A - B ) . 239 Alternative pathways for delivery of ciliary material have also been found in 240 Chlamydomonas . In one experiment , surface proteins were biotinylated and then cells were 241 deciliated , so the membrane and proteins within cilia were lost . When cilia were allowed to 242 regrow , biotinylated proteins were found within the new cilia suggesting they came from the 243 plasma membrane ( Dentler , 2013 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that due to its role in membrane 244 remodeling in other organisms , the Arp2 / 3 complex may be part of an endocytic pathway that 245 provides membrane to cilia ( Figure 3A ) . To test if membrane could be coming from an 246 endocytic source , we treated cells with BFA to collapse the Golgi and block exocytosis forcing 247 cells to utilize other sources of ciliary membrane . Wild - type cilia treated with BFA resorb , but 248 arpc4 mutant cells resorb faster ( Figures 3B and D , S2 ) , and the number of cells with cilia in 249 arpc4 mutant cells dramatically decreased with BFA treatment ( Figure 3C ) . Meanwhile , cells 250 treated with other known ciliary resorption - inducing drugs that do not specifically target Golgi 251 traffic , 3 - isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine ( IBMX ) ( Pasquale and Goodenough , 1987 ) or sodium 252 pyrophosphate ( NaPPi ) ( Lefebvre et al . , 1978 ) show an increased velocity of resorption in wild - 253 type cells compared to arpc4 mutant cells ( Figure S5 ) , so the faster resorption of arpc4 mutant 254 cells in BFA is specific to the effects of BFA . Thus , wild - type cells are more capable of 255 maintaining cilia without membrane supply from the Golgi , suggesting there must be another 256 source for membrane that is dependent upon the Arp2 / 3 complex , perhaps the cell body plasma 257 membrane . 258 259 260 Figure 3 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for ciliary maintenance in the absence of intact Golgi . A ) Treating cells 261 with Brefeldin A ( BFA ) causes the Golgi to collapse meaning any membranes and proteins used to maintain the cilia 262 must come from other sources .

Dentler 2013 . 272 Surface proteins were biotinylated , then cells were deciliated . After the cilia regrew for 5 hours , 273 they were isolated and probed for biotinylated protein ( Figure 4A ) . Any biotinylated protein 274 present in newly grown and isolated cilia must have come from a pool in the plasma membrane . 275 First , we noticed differences in the biotinylated proteins found in wild - type cilia and arpc4 mutant 276 cilia before deciliation , suggesting there are overall differences in the composition of wild - type 277 and arpc4 mutant cilia ( Figure 4C ) . If ciliary membrane proteins are coming from the cell body 278 plasma membrane in an Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent manner as we hypothesize , this must be 279 the case , as this would mean wild - type and arpc4 mutant cells have differences in the trafficking 280 10 pathways that bring ciliary material to cilia . More specifically , there are biotinylated proteins 281 present in wild - type cells that are never present in arpc4 mutant cells , so there is a mechanism 282 for delivery of proteins to the cilia from the plasma membrane that absolutely requires the 283 Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 4B - C ) . There are also some proteins that are present to a higher 284 degree in our arpc4 mutants . We suspect this could be due to compensation by other pathways 285 or defects in turnover of proteins in the cilia , perhaps through an exocytic mechanism . Next , 286 looking at the cilia post - deciliation . Cilia were harvested 5 hours following deciliation because 287 the arpc4 mutant cilia regrow quite slowly . This means that cells might have time to employee 288 other trafficking methods for getting material to cilia , but we still see striking differences . We 289 found that while some proteins returned in both wild - type and arpc4 mutant cells , some 290 appeared to a lesser degree in arpc4 mutant cells compared to wild - type cells ( Figures 8B - E , 291 black arrow and black bars ) and some returned to a higher degree in arpc4 mutant cells 292 ( Figures 8B - E , grey arrow and grey bars ) . This suggests there are multiple paths to the ciliary 293 membrane , some of which are Arp2 / 3 complex - independent and some that are Arp2 / 3 complex - 294 dependent . This may represent lateral diffusion and endocytosis respectively . Importantly , this 295 assay tells us that membrane proteins can and do come to the cilia from the cell body plasma 296 membrane . 297 298 299 Figure 4 .

SAG1 is a membrane protein important for mating in 314 Chlamydomonas cells ( Belzile et al . , 2013 ; Ranjan et al . , 2019 ) .

This relocalizaiton of SAG1 is thought to 317 occur through internalization and internal trafficking on microtubules ( Belzile et al . , 2013 ; Ranjan 318 et al . , 2019 ) . 319 We examined whether actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex were required for transport of HA - 320 tagged SAG1 to the cell apex and cilia during mating ( Figure 5A ) . We observed cells treated 321 with either LatB to depolymerize IDA5 or CK - 666 to perturb the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 5 , S2 ) . 322 Before induction , SAG1 - HA localized to the cell periphery ( Figure 5B , top ) . 30 minutes after 323 induction with db - cAMP , SAG1 - HA relocalized to the cell apex and to cilia in untreated cells 324 ( Figure 5B , left ) . In both LatB and CK - 666 treated cells , this apical enrichment decreased 325 ( Figure 5B , middle and right ) . We took line scans through the cell from the apex to the basal 326 region ( Figures 5C - D ) and calculated the percentage of cells with apical enrichment . Untreated 327 cells had a higher percent of apical enrichment when compared with LatB or CK - 666 treated 328 cells ( Figure 5E ) . Thus , cells with perturbed Arp2 / 3 complex or filamentous actin show 329 decreased efficiency of SAG1 - HA relocalization . 330 We asked if this decrease in relocalization in cells with actin and Arp2 / 3 complex 331 inhibition could be due to a decrease in internalization of SAG1 - HA through a process that 332 seems to require endocytosis . We used a method first described by Belzile et al . 2013 , where 333 cells were induced and treated with a low percentage ( 0 . 01 % ) of trypsin , which hydrolyzes 334 exterior proteins but cannot enter the cell . In untreated cells , we see an increase in SAG1 - HA 335 protein levels following induction because SAG1 - HA is internalized and becomes protected from 336 trypsin ( Figure 5F ) . In cells treated with either LatB or CK - 666 we see a decrease in this trypsin 337 protection ( Figure 5F ) . We quantified this by subtracting the amount of protein before induction 338 from the amount of protein present after induction , which gives a value representing the amount 339 of SAG1 - HA protected from trypsin due to internalization ( Figure 5G ) . The decrease in SAG1 - 340 HA following induction in LatB or CK - 666 treated cells indicates a role for Arp2 / 3 complex and 341 actin in internalization of this specific ciliary membrane protein . 342 343 12 344 Figure 5 .

Line represents mean of 3 separate experiments . 357 358 Apical actin dots are dependent on the Arp2 / 3 complex : 359 Since ciliary membrane proteins can come from the Golgi or the plasma membrane and 360 arpc4 mutant cells have a more severe defect in incorporating ciliary proteins from non - Golgi 361 sources , we asked if Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin networks might be responsible for plasma 362 membrane remodeling in Chlamydomonas as it is in other organisms . Thus , we looked at the 363 effects of loss of Arp2 / 3 complex function on actin structures . Using new protocols for 364 visualizing actin in Chlamydomonas ( Craig et al . , 2019 ) , we stained wild - type cells and arpc4 365 Induction A C Sag1 HA G B D E F I ndu c ed U n i ndu c ed Untreated Untreated LatB LatB CK - 666 CK - 666 Anti - HA Total Protein ( Coomassie ) Sag1 - HA Uninduced Induced Untreated LatB CK - 666 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 C e ll s w i t h ap i c a l en r i c h m en t ( % ) UninducedInduced * * * * * * * 0 20 40 60 80 100120140160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Length ( pix ) 0 20 40 60 80 100120140160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Length ( pix ) 0 20 40 60 80 100120140160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Length ( pix ) G r e y v a l ue ( A U ) U n t r ea t ed La t B C K - 666 - 10000 0 10000 20000 30000 I ndu c ed - U n i ndu c ed ( A U ) Induced : Trypsin : Untreated LatB CK - 666 + - + + LatB CK - 666 Untreated + - + + + - + + + - + + + - + + + - + + 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 kDa 13 mutant cells with fluorescent phalloidin . In wild - type cells , apical dots reminiscent of endocytic 366 actin patches in yeast are seen near the base of cilia ( Figure 6A ) . We quantified the presence 367 of dots in the wild - type cells compared to arpc4 mutant cells ( Figure 6A - B ) . While about 70 % of 368 wild - type cells contain the dots , less than 5 % of arpc4 mutant cells had dots ( Figure 6B ) , 369 suggesting the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for formation of this structure . Expression of the 370 ARPC4 - V5 construct in arpc4 mutant cells rescued the dots ( Figure 6C ) . Because ARPC4 - V5 371 staining showed diffuse signal throughout the cell , we are not able to determine whether or not 372 active Arp2 / 3 complex localizes to the dots ( Figure S1C ) . However , the reliance of this structure 373 on the Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that the Arp2 / 3 complex is definitely involved in this structure . 374 This led us to question whether these dots could represent membrane remodeling . 375 376 377 Figure 6 .

Scale bars represent 2 µ m . 386 387 388 389 14 Endocytosis occurs in Chlamydomonas : 390 The Arp2 / 3 complex is thought to be involved in endocytosis in cell - walled yeast to 391 overcome turgor pressure ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Basu et al . , 2014 ; 392 Carlsson and Bayly , 2014 ) . Chlamydomonas cells also have a cell wall and since the actin dots 393 resemble yeast endocytic pits ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Goode et al . , 394 2015 ) , we hypothesized that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent endocytosis might be occurring in 395 Chlamydomonas though this process has not yet been directly demonstrated in this organism . 396 To determine what kind of endocytosis likely occurs in these cells , we compared the 397 endocytosis - related proteins found in mammals and plants to those in Chlamydomonas ( Figure 398 7A ) . Chlamydomonas lacks much of the important machinery for almost all typical endocytosis 399 processes , including caveolin for caveolin - mediated endocytosis , flotillin for flotillin - dependent 400 endocytosis , and endophilin for endophilin - dependent endocytosis ( Figure 7A ) . However , 401 clathrin - mediated endocytosis is conserved to a higher extent than other endocytic 402 mechanisms . 403 We aimed to probe the likelihood of endocytosis occurring in Chlamydomonas , but a 404 mutant for the proteins involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis does not currently exist and 405 methods of targeted mutagenesis in Chlamydomonas are not yet reliable . So , we turned to our 406 best alternative PitStop2 , which inhibits the interaction of adaptor proteins with clathrin , halting 407 clathrin endocytosis , despite reported off - target effects on global endocytosis in mammalian 408 cells ( Willox et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure S2 ) . We also used the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore , which is 409 thought to block endocytosis by inhibiting the GTPase activity of dynamin ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) , 410 although this inhibitor has also been found to affect actin in some mammalian cells ( Mooren 411 Olivia L . and Schafer Dorothy A . , 2009 ; Park et al . , 2013 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . Although both 412 PitStop2 and Dynasore are reported to have off - target effects in different pathways , their 413 intended target is in the same pathway . Therefore , by using both we hope to reduce concerns of 414 off - target effects . To further minimize off - target effects , this experiment was done in a fast time 415 scale and at the lowest concentration possible . For this experiment , we used the fixable 416 lipophilic dye FM 4 - 64FX ( Cochilla et al . , 1999 ; Gachet and Hyams , 2005 ) , which is 417 impermeable to the plasma membrane but is endocytosed into cells showing bright foci where 418 dye is enriched in endocytic compartments . We incubated the dye for 1 minute to allow enough 419 time for internalization into endosomes but not enough for incorporation into various cellular 420 membrane structures . The ability of cells to internalize membrane was measured by calculating 421 the total cell fluorescence inside the cell after dye internalization ( Figure 7B ) . Cells treated with 422 PitStop2 or Dynasore internalized significantly less membrane dye ( Figure 7C ) , which supports 423 the idea that endocytosis is occurring in these cells and that it is likely clathrin - mediated . 424 Next , we tested whether endocytosis is Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent by using this 425 membrane internalization assay on arpc4 mutant cells compared to wild - type cells and CK - 666 426 treated cells compared to CK - 689 treated cells . arpc4 mutant cells and cells treated with CK - 427 666 have decreased total cell fluorescence ( Figure 7D - F ) suggesting endocytosis in 428 Chlamydomonas is Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent . 429 15 430 Figure 7 .

We returned to the Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin dots that are reminiscent of 448 endocytic pits in yeast . Because ciliary membrane and proteins can come from the plasma 449 membrane ( Dentler , 2013 ) , we suspected there would be an increase in actin dots following 450 deciliation . We used phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton of wild - type cells before and 451 immediately following deciliation , as well as 10 minutes later ( Figure 8A ) . We saw an increase 452 in both the percentage of cells with dots and the number of dots per cell immediately following 453 deciliation that returned to normal by 10 minutes ( Figures 8A , D ) . This is consistent with the 454 results in Figures 1E - F and confirms that the defect in ciliary assembly is due to an event 455 occurring very early in ciliary assembly , within the first few minutes after deciliation . 456 In the arpc4 mutant cells dots were never observed , before or after deciliation ( Figure 457 8B , D ) , confirming these dots are Arp2 / 3 complex dependent . Next , we investigated if the dots 458 were due to endocytosis by treating cells with PitStop2 and looking for this same increase in 459 dots . This treatment almost fully blocked the appearance of dots following deciliation and 460 eliminated the presence of cells with 3 or more dots ( Figure 8C - D ) , suggesting an Arp2 / 3 461 complex - dependent endocytic mechanism is related to these dots that occur immediately 462 following endocytosis when ciliary material is in high demand . 463 464 17 465 Figure 8 .

For wild - type , the total number 472 of cells with dots is significantly different for the 0 min time point ( * * ) and the number of dotted cells with 3 or more dots 473 is significantly different for the 0 time point ( * * * * ) . 474 475 476 DISCUSSION 477 In this study , we investigate the Arp2 / 3 complex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that 478 functions to maintain and assemble cilia . This complex potentially lacks the ARPC5 subunit , 479 although it is possible that a divergent ARPC5 exists . In yeast , deletion of any of the genes 480 encoding Arp2 / 3 complex members causes severe defects , but these defects differ in severity 481 18 depending on the complex members deleted , suggesting complex members have varying 482 degrees of importance in Arp2 / 3 complex function ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) . The role of ARPC5 in 483 actin nucleation is being investigated , but some groups have found it unnecessary for function 484 of the complex ( Gournier et al . , 2001 ; von Loeffelholz et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , our data show 485 that knocking out function of the ARPC5 - less Chlamydomonas Arp2 / 3 complex results in 486 various phenotypes , suggesting the wild - type complex is active . In this paper , we study the 487 Arp2 / 3 complex using 2 main perturbations : genetic inhibition of the ARPC4 member of the 488 complex and chemical inhibition with the inhibitor CK - 666 . CK - 666 is designed for mammalian 489 cells , but we believe that CK - 666 is functional in Chlamydomonas because it can recapitulate 490 the effects of the genetic mutant . Regardless , we used both the genetic perturbation and the 491 chemical perturbation for nearly every experiment looking at the role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in 492 these phenotypes . Additionally , if we treat the arpc4 mutant with CK - 666 we do not see these 493 same phenotypes , again suggesting that CK - 666 is acting to block the same functions as the 494 genetic arcp4 mutant ( Figure 1A ) . Because the Arp2 / 3 complex has known functions in 495 membrane dynamics and because of our data demonstrate a role for the Arp2 / 3 complex of 496 Chlamydomonas in membrane and membrane protein internalization , this led us to pursue 497 models of Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent membrane trafficking to cilia . 498 Previously , three models of membrane protein trafficking to cilia have been proposed 499 regarding where ciliary vesicles fuse relative to a diffusion barrier composed of septins ( Hu 500 Qicong et al . , 2010 ) , which delineates ciliary membrane and cell body plasma membrane 501 ( Nachury et al . , 2010 ) . The first is that Golgi vesicles containing ciliary proteins fuse with the 502 ciliary membrane inside the cilium . Proteins , both membrane and soluble , have been found to 503 travel from the Golgi to the cilia on or in cytoplasmic vesicles ( Wood and Rosenbaum , 2014 ) . 504 Second , Golgi vesicles containing ciliary proteins fuse outside but near the cilium still within the 505 diffusion barrier ( Nachury et al . , 2007 ; Papermaster et al . , 1985 ; Zuo et al . , 2009 ) . In 506 Chlamydomonas , mastigoneme proteins travel from the Golgi and are exocytosed for use on 507 the exterior of the cell ( Bouck , 1971 ) . In the third model , Golgi vesicles containing proteins fuse 508 with the plasma membrane outside the diffusion barrier where they move in the plane of the 509 plasma membrane across this barrier , perhaps through lateral diffusion that requires remodeling 510 or passing through the diffusion barrier . Evidence for this path was shown using Hedgehog 511 signaling protein Smoothened , which relocalizes in a dynamin - independent manner from the 512 plasma membrane to the cilia immediately after stimulation in pulse labeling studies ( Milenkovic 513 et al . , 2009 ) . 514 Our data all together support a fourth model , likely occurring in concert with other 515 models , in which membrane and membrane proteins are recruited to the cilium from a reservoir 516 in the cell body plasma membrane . We show that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for ciliary 517 assembly from zero - length ( Figure 1 ) ; we show that ciliary membrane proteins can and do 518 come from the cell body plasma membrane , both generally ( Figure 4 ) and for a specific protein 519 ( Figure 5 ) ; we show that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for endocytosis ( Figure 7 ) and for the 520 formation of actin dots reminiscent of endocytic pits or patches ( Figures 6 , 8 ) ; and finally we 521 show an endocytosis - dependent increase in Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin dots immediately 522 following deciliation ( Figure 8 ) . Thus , we hypothesize that ciliary membrane proteins and 523 membrane targeted to the plasma membrane of the cell outside the diffusion barrier can be 524 endocytosed and trafficked to cilia , either within or outside of the diffusion barrier in an actin and 525 Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent manner . 526 Although our data do not eliminate the possibility of Arp2 / 3 complex function in supply of 527 ciliary membrane and protein stored in other endosomal compartments , ciliary localization of 528 proteins initially labeled on the cell surface with biotin ( Figure 8 ) suggests some ciliary 529 membrane proteins incorporated during assembly are coming from the plasma membrane itself . 530 One limitation to this study is the time frame . We isolated cilia following 5 hours of regrowth to 531 get a measurable amount of arpc4 mutant cilia , which have very defective growth . This means 532 19 that compensatory mechanisms such as synthesis and slower trafficking may be involved . We 533 also cannot rule out an additional role for the Arp2 / 3 complex in delivery of existing soluble 534 proteins to cilia . An in - depth analysis of soluble protein recruitment and incorporation would be a 535 useful next step to determine if the Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in other ciliary assembly related 536 processes . Our data also does not preclude Arp2 / 3 complex function in other membrane 537 dynamics . However , all the data in this paper together support a model involving membrane 538 remodeling and endocytosis . An endocytic mechanism of trafficking in intracellular ciliogenesis 539 has been investigated in mammalian RPE1 cells . The ciliary pocket found at the base of primary 540 and motile cilia formed intracellularly has been found to be an endocytically active region ( Molla - 541 Herman et al . , 2010 ) but clathrin - mediated endocytosis was not required for ciliogenesis in 542 those cells . The Bardet Biedl Syndrome complex ( BBsome ) , which is involved in regulation of 543 ciliary membrane protein composition , has been shown to interact with clathrin directly at the 544 ciliary pocket to facilitate membrane sorting in trypanosomes ( Langousis et al . , 2016 ) . Further , 545 some BBsome complex members resemble coat proteins such as clathrin ( Jin et al . , 2010 ) 546 suggesting a direct role for the this cilium regulatory complex in membrane functions . It has also 547 been found that disruption of recycling endosomes reduces the localization of polycystin - 2 to 548 cilia , suggesting a role for recycling endosomes in the localization of proteins to the cilia ( Monis 549 et al . , 2017 ) . In Chlamydomonas , clathrin heavy chain has been found to localize at the base of 550 cilia ( Kaplan et al . , 2012 ) . While the mechanism was unknown , it has been shown that plasma 551 membrane surface - exposed proteins are relocalized to cilia during ciliary regeneration ( Dentler , 552 2013 ) , a result we recapitulated and demonstrated depends , in part , upon the Arp2 / 3 complex . 553 Altogether , this leads us to hypothesize that the role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in ciliary 554 assembly is through endocytic recruitment from a ciliary protein reservoir in the plasma 555 membrane before newly synthesized protein and Golgi - derived membrane can supply additional 556 materials ( Figure 9B ) . While this model provides a possible route that some ciliary proteins and 557 membranes take to the cilia , we believe this is one of several paths that can be taken to the 558 cilia . This could be further investigated by determining specific proteins that may take these 559 different paths to the cilia . Trafficking to cilia is likely cargo - and time - dependent , and which path 560 proteins take may tell us the order and speed in which they populate the cilium for subsequent 561 function . 562 563 20 564 Figure 9 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for membrane and protein delivery via a Golgi - independent , 565 endocytosis - like process . A ) Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin networks are required for ciliary assembly in Chlamydomonas 566 particularly during the initial stages . These actin networks are also required for endocytosis , and for the endocytosis - 567 like relocalization of a ciliary protein from the plasma membrane to the cilia . Finally , a large endocytic event occurs 568 immediately following deciliation that is Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated . B ) Proposed model of membrane protein and 569 membrane transport from the plasma membrane to the cilia through endocytosis . 570 571 METHODS 572 Strains : 573 The wild - type Chlamydomonas strain ( CC - 5325 ) and the arpc4 mutant ( LMJ . RY0402 . 232713 ) 574 are from the Chlamydomonas resource center . The arpc4 : ARPC4 - V5 strain was made by 575 cloning the gene into pChlamy4 ( Chlamydomonas resource center ) . Colonies were screened for 576 the absence ( in the case of the mutant ) or presence ( in the case of the rescue ) by PCR using 577 the primers AAAAGAATTCATGGCGCTCTCACTCAGGCCATA and 578 Early ciliary assembly is Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent PitStop2 T Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent endocytosis occurs in Chlamydomonas Relocalization of a plasma membrane protein to cilia is Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent endocytic event occurs during early ciliary assembly loss of Arp2 / 3 complex T SAG1 loss of Arp2 / 3 complex T loss of Arp2 / 3 complex T A B 21 AAAATCTAGACAGAAGGCAAGGGAGCGCAGGAA . The SAG1 - HA strain was a gift from 579 William Snell . Cells were grown and maintained on 1 . 5 % Tris - Acetate Phosphate Agar ( TAP ) 580 plates ( Chlamydomonas resource center ) under constant blue ( 450 - 475 nm ) and red light ( 625 - 581 660 nm ) . For experiments , cells were grown in liquid TAP media ( Chlamydomonas resource 582 center ) overnight under constant red and blue light with agitation from a rotator . To induce 583 gametes for mating for the SAG1 - HA experiments , cells were grown in liquid M - N media 584 ( Chlamydomonas resource center ) overnight with constant red and blue light and agitation . 585 586 Ciliary studies : 587 For steady state experiments , cells were treated with specified drugs [ either 100 µ M CK - 666 , 588 250 µ M CK - 666 ( Sigma , 182515 ) 250 µ M CK - 689 ( CalBiochem , 182517 ) , 10 µ M LatB ( Sigma , 589 L5288 ) , 10 µ M CHX ( Sigma , C1988 ) , or 36 µ M BFA ( Sigma , B7651 ) all diluted in DMSO ( Sigma , 590 D2650 ) ] and incubated with agitation for the allotted times . Following any incubation ( as well as 591 a pre sample ) , cells were diluted in an equal volume of 2 % glutaraldehyde ( EMS , 16220 ) and 592 incubated at 4º Celsius until they sediment ( within 24hrs ) . Following sedimentation , cells were 593 imaged using a Zeiss Axioscope 5 DIC microscope with a 40X objective ( 0 . 75 numerical 594 aperture ) at room temperature with no immersion media or imaging media . Images were 595 acquired using Zeiss Zen 3 . 1 ( blue edition ) . Cilia were then measured using the segmented line 596 function in ImageJ . One cilium per cell was measured and 30 cilia total were measured . 597 598 For regeneration experiments , a pre sample was taken by adding cells to an equal volume of 599 2 % glutaraldehyde . Then cells were deciliated with 115 µ L of 0 . 5N acetic acid for 45 seconds . 600 After this short incubation , the pH was returned to normal by adding 120 µ L of 0 . 5N KOH . A 0 - 601 minute sample was again taken by adding cells to an equal volume of 2 % glutaraldehyde . Then 602 cells were incubated with agitation and allowed to regrow cilia for the allotted time period with 603 samples taken at the indicated time points by adding cells to an equal volume of 2 % 604 glutaraldehyde . Cells in glutaraldehyde were allowed to incubate at 4º Celsius until 605 sedimentation ( within 24hrs ) . Then , cells were imaged using the same Zeiss DIC microscope 606 with a 40X objective and the same software . Cilia were then measured using the segmented 607 line function in ImageJ . One cilium per cell was measured and 30 cilia total were measured . 608 609 ARPC4 Rescue : 610 The ARPC4 genetic sequence was isolated from Chlamydomonas cDNA using PCR with the 611 Q5 DNA Polymerase ( NEB , M0491L ) . The resulting fragment and the pChlamy4 plasmid 612 ( Thermofisher , A24231 ) were digested with EcoRI ( NEB , R0101S ) and XhoI ( NEB , R0146S ) for 613 1 hour followed by heat inactivation . Then , the fragment and vector were mixed in a 5 : 1 ratio 614 and ligated with T4 DNA Ligase ( NEB , M0202L ) overnight at 16˚C . The vector was then 615 transformed into One Shot TOP10 chemically competent cells ( Invitrogen , C404003 ) following 616 the product protocol . The transformed competent cells were plated on LB plates with 100 µg / mL 617 ampicillin ( IBI Scientific , IB02040 ) and grown overnight at 37˚C . The following morning colonies 618 were screened using DreamTaq DNA Polymerase ( Thermo , EP0702 ) and the forward primer 619 AAAAGAATTCATGGCGCTCTCACTCAGGCCATA and the reverse primer 620 AAAATCTAGACAGAAGGCAAGGGAGCGCAGGAA . Positive colonies were grown in liquid LB 621 with 100 µg / mL ampicillin overnight at 37˚C . Plasmid DNA was isolated from bacterial cells and 622 sequenced . 623 624 Plasmids containing the ARPC4 DNA were then transformed into Chlamydomonas cells . First , a 625 5 mL liquid culture of arpc4 mutant cells was grown overnight with agitation and constant light in 626 TAP . The following day 25 mL of TAP was brought to an OD 730 of 0 . 1 using the 5 mL culture . 627 This was incubated with agitation and under constant light overnight . The culture reached an 628 22 OD 730 of 0 . 3 - 0 . 4 for the transformation . Once this occurred , the plasmid was linearized using 629 ScaI ( NEB , R3122L ) . Meanwhile , the 25 mL culture was centrifuged at 500xg to pellet the cells . 630 The TAP was removed and replaced with 5 mL of Max Efficiency Transformation Reagent for 631 Algae ( Invitrogen , 100021485 ) . This was repeated 2 times . After the final centrifugation , the 632 cells were resuspended in 250 µL of Max Efficiency Transformation Reagent . This was then 633 split in two . 1000 µg of linearized plasmid was added to each . This was then electroporated 634 using a BioRad Electroporator at 500V , 50 µF , and 800 W in a 4 mm cuvette . The cells were 635 removed from the cuvette following electroporation , suspended in 7 mL of TAP + 40 mM 636 sucrose , and incubated overnight in the dark . The following day the cells were pelleted and 637 streaked on TAP + Zeocin ( 10 µg / mL ) plates , then incubated in constant light for approximately 638 1 week or until colonies formed . 639 640 Colonies were screened using DreamTaq DNA Polymerase ( Thermo , EP0702 ) and the same 641 primers as above . Positive colonies were streaked onto new plates and allowed to grow up . 642 Expression of ARPC4 - V5 was confirmed with a western blot . Liquid cultures of cells were grown 643 overnight , then pelleted at 500 xg for 1 minute . Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [ 5 % 644 glycerol ( ) , 1 % NP - 40 ( ) , 1mM DTT ( ) , 1X protease inhibitors ( Thermo , 1861281 ) ] and lysed 645 using bead beating . Cell debris was spun down at 14000xg for 15 minutes . An equal amount of 646 protein was loaded to a NuPAGE 10 % Bis - Tris gel ( Invitrogen , NP0316 ) . The resulting gel was 647 transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore , IPVH00010 ) which was then blocked with 5 % milk in 648 PBST . The blot was incubated with rabbit anti - V5 primary antibody ( Cell Signaling , D3H8Q ) 649 diluted to 1 : 1000 in 1 % BSA , 1 % milk overnight at 4˚C to probe for V5 . The following day blots 650 were washed 3 times in 1X PBST , then incubated with HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit 651 secondary ( Thermo , G - 21234 ) diluted to 1 : 5000 in 1 % milk 1 % BSA for 1 hour at room 652 temperature . The blot was washed again 3 times with 1X PBST . Then the blot was probed with 653 West Pico Chemiluminescent Pico Substrate ( Invitrogen , 34580 ) . The same membrane was 654 stripped of antibody and total protein was determined with Coomassie ( Sigma , B0149 ) staining . 655 Band intensity was measured in ImageJ and normalized to total protein . 656 657 Click - iT OPP Protein Synthesis Assay ( Invitrogen , C10457 ) : 658 Cells were grown overnight in TAP . The following day cells were deciliated as described above 659 and allowed to regrow either with or without cycloheximide ( 10µM ) to block protein synthesis . 1 660 hour following deciliation , cells were mounted onto poly - lysine ( EMS , 19321 - B ) coverslips . Cells 661 on coverslips were incubated with Click - iT OPP reagent containing the O - propargyl - puromycin 662 ( OPP ) which is incorporated into nascent polypeptides for 30 minutes . OPP was removed and 663 cells were washed once in PBS . Cells were then fixed with 4 % PFA ( EMS , 15710 ) in 1X HEPES 664 ( Sigma , 391338 ) for 15 minutes , then permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton - X 100 in PBS for 15 665 minutes . Cells were washed twice with PBS . Detection was performed by incubating coverslips 666 with 1X Click - iT OPP Reaction Cocktail that includes 1X Click - iT OPP Reaction Buffer , 1X 667 Copper Protectant , 1X Alexafluor picolyl azide , and 1X Click - iT Reaction Buffer Additive for 30 668 minutes protected from light . This was removed and Reaction Rinse Buffer was added for 5 669 minutes . This was removed and coverslips were washed twice with PBS , allowed to dry fully , 670 and mounted with Fluormount - G ( Invitrogen , 00 - 4958 - 02 ) . 671 672 Cells were then imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E microscope with a Yokogawa , two - camera , 673 CSU0W1 spinning disk system with a Nikon LU - N4 laser launch at room temperature with a 674 100X oil - immersion objective ( 1 . 45 numerical aperture ) . Images were acquired using Nikon 675 Elements and analyzed using ImageJ as follows . Z - stacks were obtained then combined into 676 sum slices for quantification of maximum intensity projections for viewing . In the summed 677 images , the integrated density and area of individual cells was obtained , as well as the 678 23 background fluorescence . These were then used to calculate CTCF , which was then normalized 679 to the “Pre” sample for each cell . 680 681 Phalloidin staining and quantification : 682 Procedure adapted from ( Craig et al . , 2019 ) . Cells were mounted onto poly - lysine coverslips 683 and fixed with fresh 4 % paraformaldehyde in 1X HEPES . Coverslips with cells were then 684 permeabilized with acetone and allowed to dry . Cells were rehydrated with PBS , stained with 685 Phalloidin - Atto 488 ( Sigma , 49409 - 10NMOL ) , and finally washed with PBS and allowed to dry 686 before mounting with Fluormount - G ( Craig et al . , 2019 ) . Cells were imaged using the Nikon 687 Spinning Disk Confocal discussed above . Z - stacks were obtained in Nikon Elements , and in 688 ImageJ , maximum intensity projections were created for viewing . Publication quality images 689 were acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan with two photomultiplier tubes , a GaAsP 690 detector , and a transmitted light detector . Images were taken at room temperature using a 100x 691 ( 1 . 46 numerical aperture ) oil - immersion lens . Images were acquired using Zeiss Zen ( black 692 edition ) and prepared for publication using ImageJ . 693 694 Electron microscopy : 695 Cells ( 1mL of each strain ) were deciliated via pH shock by adding 115 µ L of 0 . 5N acetic acid for 696 45 seconds followed by 120 µ L of 0 . 5N KOH to bring cells back to neutral pH . Cells were 697 allowed to regrow cilia for 30 minutes . A pre sample and a 30 - minute post - deciliation sample 698 were fixed in an equal volume of 2 % glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature . 699 Samples were then pelleted using gentle centrifugation for 10 minutes . The supernatant was 700 removed , and cells were resuspended in 1 % glutaraldehyde , 20mM sodium cacodylate . Cells 701 were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then overnight at 4º Celsius . This protocol 702 was first reported in ( Dentler and Adams , 1992 ) . A JEOL JEM - 1400 Transmission Electron 703 Microscope equipped with a Lab6 gun was used to acquire images . Images were quantified in 704 ImageJ . 705 706 SAG1 - HA Immunofluorescence : 707 Procedure adapted from ( Belzile et al . , 2013 ) . SAG1 - HA cells were grown overnight in M - N 708 media to induce gametes . These cells were then treated with either 10 µ M LatB for 1 hour or 709 250 µ M CK - 666 for 2 hours . Following treatment , mating was induced by adding db - cAMP 710 ( ChemCruz , Santa Cruz , CA ) to a final concentration of 13 . 5mM and incubating for 30 minutes . 711 Cells were adhered to coverslips and fixed with methanol . Cells were then dried and rehydrated 712 with PBS and incubated with 100 % block ( 5 % BSA , 1 % fish gelatin ) for 30 minutes . The 100 % 713 block was replaced with new 100 % block containing 10 % normal goat serum for another 30 - 714 minute incubation . The rabbit anti - HA primary antibody ( Cell Signaling , C29F4 ) was diluted 715 1 : 1000 in 20 % block in PBS . Coverslips were incubated at 4º Celsius in a humidified chamber 716 overnight . The primary antibody was removed and washed away with 3 10 - minute PBS washes . 717 The Alexafluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary ( Invitrogen , A - 10088 ) was added and 718 coverslips were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour . This was followed by 3 more 10 - 719 minute PBS washes and finally mounting with Fluoromount - G . Cells were imaged using the 720 Nikon Spinning Disk Confocal microscope , lens , and software discussed previously . Z - stacks 721 were obtained , and maximum intensity projections were created for visualization and sum slices 722 were created for quantification using ImageJ . 723 724 Images were quantified by using line scans from the apex of the cells to the basal region of the 725 cells farthest away from the apex . Line scans were then normalized , and background subtracted 726 before being combined into single graphs . Using the line scans , the intensity of signal at the 727 basal region of the cells was subtracted from the signal at the apical region . Finally , cells with a 728 24 difference over 30 were considered to be apically enriched and this was quantified as 729 percentage of cells with apical staining . 730 731 SAG1 - HA western blot : 732 Procedure adapted from ( Belzile et al . , 2013 ) . SAG1 - HA cells were grown overnight in M - N 733 media to induce gametes . These cells were then treated with either 10 µ M LatB for 1 hour or 734 250 µ M CK - 666 for 2 hours . Following treatment , mating induction was done by adding db - cAMP 735 ( ChemCruz , SC - 201567B ) to a final concentration of 13 . 5mM and incubating for 10 minutes . 736 Cells were then treated with 0 . 01 % trypsin ( Sigma , T8003 ) for 5 minutes , pelleted ( at 500xg for 737 2 minutes ) , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 5 % glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 1mM DTT , 1X protease 738 inhibitors ) , and then lysed with bead beating . A western blot was carried out as described above 739 using rabbit anti - HA primary antibody ( Cell Signaling , C29F4 ) diluted to 1 : 1000 in 1 % BSA , 1 % 740 milk and HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary ( Thermo , G - 21234 ) diluted to 1 : 5000 in 1 % 741 milk 1 % BSA . 742 743 Chlamydomonas mating : 744 SAG1 - HA ( mating type plus ) and arpc4 mutants ( mating type minus ) were incubated in M - N 745 media ( minimal media without nitrogen ) for 8 hours to induce gamete formation . The two liquid 746 cultures were then mixed and allowed to incubate under white light without agitation overnight . 747 The next day the pellicle was transferred to a 4 % TAP plate . This was incubated under white 748 light overnight , then covered in foil and placed in a dark drawer for 5 - 7 days . After 5 - 7 days , the 749 zygospores were transferred individually and manually from the 4 % TAP plate to a 1 . 5 % TAP 750 plate using a dissecting microscope ( Zeiss ) . This plate was incubated in white light overnight . 751 The following day the zygospores that had split into tetrads were dissected . These were then 752 allowed to grow before being screened via PCR for a colony containing the arpc4 mutant and 753 SAG1 - HA . 754 755 Membrane stain : 756 Cells were treated with either PitStop2 ( Sigma , SML1169 ) or Dynasore hydrate ( Sigma , D7693 ) 757 for 1 hour . Meanwhile , FM 4 - 64FX membrane stain ( Invitrogen , F34653 ) was diluted to a stock 758 concentration of 200µg / mL . Cells were adhered to poly - lysine coverslips . After a 5 - minute 759 incubation , cells were tilted off and 5µg / mL of ice - cold stain in Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution 760 ( HBSS ) without magnesium or calcium was added for 1 minute . The stain was tilted off and cells 761 were fixed with ice cold 4 % paraformaldehyde in HBSS without magnesium or calcium for 15 762 minutes . Coverslips were then rinsed 3 times for 10 minutes each in ice cold HBSS without 763 magnesium or calcium . Finally , cells were mounted with Fluoromount - G and imaged using the 764 Nikon Spinning Disk Confocal microscope , lens , and software discussed previously . Z - stacks 765 were taken and combined into sum projections using ImageJ . The background corrected total 766 cell fluorescence was then calculated by taking the integrated density and subtracting the sum 767 of the area and the mean background intensity . 768 769 Biotin ciliary isolation : 770 Procedure adapted from ( Dentler , 2013 ) . 100mL of cells were grown in TAP for each condition 771 until they reached an OD 730 of 1 . 6 or above . Cells were then spun down and resuspended in M1 772 media and allowed to grow overnight . The next day cells were spun down at 1800rpm for 3 773 minutes and resuspended in HM Media ( 10mM HEPES , 5mM MgSO4 , pH 7 . 2 ) . Solid biotin 774 ( Thermo , 21335 ) was added to 20µg / mL for each strain and incubated for 5 minutes with 775 agitation . Cells were diluted with 10 volumes of fresh M1 media before being spun down at 776 1800rpm for 3 minutes . After all cells were pelleted , they were washed with fresh M1 media 777 three times . A pre sample was set aside ( 100mL ) and the remainder of the cells were 778 resuspended in 4 . 5 pH M1 media for 45 seconds before being spun down again at 1800rpm for 779 25 3 minutes . Cells were then resuspended in pH 7 . 0 media and allowed to regrow their cilia for 4 780 hours . A sample was taken pre - biotinylation to use as a control for non - specific streptavidin 781 binding . 782 783 Meanwhile , the cilia were isolated from the pre sample . The samples were centrifuged for 3 784 minutes at 1800rpm . Supernatant was drained and each pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of 785 10mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . This was repeated 2 times . Then each pellet was resuspended in 1 mL 786 of fresh ice - cold 4 % HMDS ( 10mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 5mM MgSO4 , 1mM DTT , 4 % w / v sucrose ) . 787 Cells were deciliated by incubating with 25mM dibucaine for 2 minutes . Then ice cold HMDS 788 with 0 . 5mM EGTA was added ( 1mL per 1 . 5mL of cells ) . This was then centrifuged for 3 minutes 789 at 1800rpm . Supernatant was collected for each sample . Then HMDS with 25 % sucrose was 790 layered beneath the supernatant ( 2 mL of 25 % HMDS for 1mL of supernatant ) to create an 791 interface . This was centrifuged at 4º Celsius for 10 min at 2400rpm with no brake to avoid 792 disrupting interface where cilia should now be located . Cilia were removed , pelleted at 21130xg 793 for 30 minutes , then resuspended in lysis buffer ( 5 % glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 1mM DTT , 1X 794 protease inhibitors ) . This was repeated with the post samples 4 hours following deciliation . 795 Protein gel electrophoresis and blotting was performed as described as above using an HRP - 796 conjugated streptavidin ( Thermo , S911 ) . 797 798 Homology modeling and sequence studies : 799 Arp2 / 3 homology model was created using the Modeller plugin in UCSF Chimera . The template 800 used was 1U2Z ( Nolen et al . , 2004 ; Pettersen et al . , 2004 ; Sali and Blundell , 1993 ) . Percent 801 identity and similarity is calculated in relation to the human Arp2 / 3 complex members using a 802 MUSCLE alignment in Geneious . The homology model was visualized and conservation was 803 mapped on the protein surface using Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . 804 805 Statistical analysis : 806 Statistical analyses were done if GraphPad Prism Version 9 . Superplots were created using the 807 method in ( Lord et al . , 2020 ) . For any experiments comparing 2 groups ( Figure 3D , 5C , and 808 5E ) an unpaired student’s t - test comparing the means of the 3 biological replicates was used to 809 determine P value . For experiments comparing multiple samples ( Figure 1A , 1B , 1C , 1D , 2B , 810 2C , 3B , and 6E ) , an ANOVA was used comparing the means of the 3 biological replicates . This 811 was followed by a multiple comparisons test ( Tukey’s ) . For any percentages shown ( Figure 812 7D ) , Chi - squared analysis was performed .

Resorption of cilia with NaPPi and IBMX is not increased in the arpc4 mutant as it is with BFA . A ) 1138 Cells were treated with 1mM IBMX and allowed to resorb their cilia . After 3 hours , IBMX was washed out and cells 1139 were allowed to regrow cilia . n = 30 in 3 separate experiments . B ) The velocity of IBMX resorption was determined by 1140 fitting a line to the first 4 points during regeneration and determining the slope in 3 separate experiments . P = 0 . 0158 . 1141 C ) Cells were treated with 20mM NaPPi and allowed to resorb their cilia . After 3 hours , NaPPi was washed out and 1142 cilia were allowed to regrow . n = 30 in 3 separate experiments . D ) The velocity of NaPPi resorption was determined by 1143 fitting a line to the first 4 points of resorption and determining the slope in 3 separate experiments . P = 0 . 0945 . The 1144 slightly slower velocities of resorption in the arpc4 mutant may be due to the fact that these cells start with shorter 1145 cilia and therefore have less to resorb or it may be due to problems in endocytosis that is thought to be required for 1146 resorption of cilia ( Saito et al . , 2017 ) . 1147 1148 1149 I B M X N a PP i A B C D Pre 1 2 3 4 5 6 02468101214161820 Time ( hr ) C ili a r y Leng t h ( (cid:43) m ) Wild - type arpc4 mutant Pre 1 2 3 4 5 6 0246 8101214161820 Time ( hr ) C ili a r y Leng t h ( (cid:43) m ) W il d - t y pe a r p c 4 m u t an t 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 V e l o c i t y o f r e s o r p t i on ( (cid:43) m / h r ) w il d - t y pe a r p c 4 m u t an t 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 V e l o c i t y o f r e s o r p t i on ( (cid:43) m / h r ) * ns
