Defocus parameters are estimated by fitting a model of the microscope ' s contrast transfer function ( CTF ) to an image ' s amplitude spectrum . Here we describe modifications to the algorithm which make it significantly faster and more suitable for use with images collected using modern technologies such as dose fractionation and phase plates . We show that this new version preserves the accuracy of the original algorithm while allowing for higher throughput . We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled .
