INSERM 348 , Hoˆpital Lariboisie ` re , 8 rue Guy Patin , 75475 Paris Cedex 10 , France Thromboxane A 2 ( TxA 2 ) is a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist . Pharmacological studies have de - fined two classes of thromboxane receptors ( TPs ) in hu - man platelets ; sites that bind the agonist 1 S - ( 1 , 2 ( 5 Z ) , 3 - ( 1 E , 3 S ) , 4 ) - 7 - 3 - ( 3 - hydroxy - 4 - ( 4 * - iodophenoxy ) - 1 - butenyl ) - 7 - oxabicyclo - 2 . 2 . 1 - heptan - 2 - yl - 5 - heptenoic acid ( I - BOP ) with high affinity support platelet shape change , whereas low affinity sites that bind irreversibly the an - tagonist GR 32191 transduce platelet aggregation . As the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in platelet aggregation begin to be elucidated , few results concern those involved in platelet shape change , which is independent of the engagement of GPIIb / IIIa . To elu - cidate the respective role of the two classes of pharma - cological binding sites of TPs in shape change , platelets were incubated with I - BOP at low concentrations or stimulated by I - BOP at high concentrations after pre - treatment with GR 32191 or activated with low concen - trations of 8 - epi - prostaglandin F 2 a . Under these three conditions , there is a rapid stimulation of protein tyro - sine phosphorylation of the 80 / 85 - kDa doublet identified as the cytoskeletal protein cortactin . Tyrosine phospho - rylation of cortactin is kinetically correlated with the occurrence of shape change . These biochemical and morphological events are both inhibited by SQ 29548 , a TP antagonist , indicating the specificity of the signal . Since tyrosine kinase Syk was activated early during platelet activation , we examined the possibility that cor - tactin is a potential substrate of Syk in TxA 2 - induced platelet shape change . p72 Syk phosphorylation and ki - nase activity took place during the period when plate - lets were changing shape upon low concentrations of I - BOP stimulation . Furthermore , cortactin was associ - ated with Syk , and this association increases along with the level of phosphorylation . These data suggest a novel pathway for a G protein - coupled TxA 2 high affinity re - ceptor to the protein - tyrosine kinase Syk , which is asso - ciated with cortactin in the very early steps of platelet activation . Thromboxane ( TxA 2 ) 1 is the principal autacoid among arachidonic acid metabolites responsible for vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation activities ( 1 ) . It also stimulates mito - genesis and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells ( 2 , 3 ) . Its mimetics induce apoptosis of immature thymocytes and may regulate thymocyte differentiation and development ( 4 ) . These actions are attributed to TxA 2 interacting with its spe - cific receptors , which belong to the heptahelical superfamily of G protein - coupled receptors . Platelet TxA 2 receptors ( TPs ) have been reported to couple to G a q G a 12 and G a 13 and G ai 2 ( 5 – 7 ) . Because of the chemical instability of TxA 2 , a number of stable agonists have been synthesized , such as U 46619 and I - BOP . Evidence suggests that two different TPs within the platelets or two different affinity states of the same receptor may exist . Analysis of the binding of 125 I - labeled I - BOP by platelet membranes indicates two platelet binding sites of high affinity ( K d 5 270 6 60 p M ) and low affinity ( K d 5 3 . 9 6 1 – 2 n M ) ( 8 ) . The K d values correspond to the EC 50 values for I - BOP to induce shape change and aggregation . Thus , the binding of I - BOP to low affinity receptors induces secretion and aggrega - tion , whereas its binding to high affinity receptors induces shape change ( 8 ) . Similarly , a TP antagonist such as GR 32191 shows noncompetitive inhibition of platelet aggregation but competitive inhibition of platelet shape change , consistent with the existence of two subtypes of receptors ( 9 ) . One possible explanation for the pharmacological evidence for distinct plate - let thromboxane binding sites is that the affinity of a single receptor type can be modulated by the type of G proteins that the receptors are coupled to . Allan et al . ( 10 ) provide evidence that the affinity state of the TP can be altered by G a 13 and G a q when cotransfected with G a 13 and G a q into COS - 7 cells . Stimulation of TPs leading to platelet aggregation involves ( i ) an activation of phospholipase C b and subsequent genera - tion of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol ( 5 ) ; ( ii ) an in - crease in intracellular free Ca 2 1 , phosphorylation of the myosin light chain of 20 kDa and of pleckstrin of 47 kDa through activation of myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C , respectively ( 9 , 11 ) ; and ( iii ) exposure of glycoprotein IIb / IIIa binding sites for fibrinogen and subsequent induced pathways such as tyrosine kinases ( 11 ) . As the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in plate - let aggregation begin to be elucidated , few results concern those involved in platelet shape change ( 12 ) .

To enhance under - standing of the signal transduction that occurs in the absence of integrin engagement and that leads to morphological changes , we used thromboxane analogues that only induce the first steps of platelet activation . To elucidate the respective roles of the two classes of pharmacological binding sites of TP in thromboxane - mediated platelet shape change , platelets were ( i ) incubated with I - BOP at low concentrations ; ( ii ) stim - ulated by I - BOP at high concentrations after pretreatment with GR 32191 , a TP antagonist that dissociates very slowly , if at all , from the low affinity binding sites ( 9 ) ; or ( iii ) activated with low concentrations of 8 - epi - PGF 2 a . This isoprostane is synthesized mostly independently of the activity of cyclooxyge - nase ( in vivo ) through the free radical - catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid and may be active as a partial platelet acti - vator at high concentrations ( 14 – 16 ) . Therefore , by using appropriate concentrations of thrombox - ane analogues that only induce shape change , we found that a 80 / 85 - kDa protein , cortactin , a substrate involved in the cy - toskeletal reorganization , is tyrosine - phosphorylated in plate - lets , and cortactin associates with the tyrosine kinase Syk . We demonstrated that both Syk kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin are kinetically correlated with platelet shape change , which is the earliest platelet response .

GR 32191 was a kind gift from Dr . B . Bain ( Glaxo Laboratories ) . Sheep anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase - conju - gated IgG , protein A - Sepharose , ECL reagents , and Hyperfilm - ECL were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ( Les Ulis , France ) .

[ g - 32 P ] ATP was from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc . ( Costa Mesa , CA ) . Tyrphostin A23 and tyrphostin A1 were from Biomol ( Plym - outh Meeting , PA ) . Preparation of Human Platelets— Human blood was taken from healthy volunteers after informed consent in accordance with the French Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine . Blood was obtained by venipuncture on ACD - C ( 130 m M citric acid , 124 m M Na 3 citrate , 110 m M glucose ; 1 volume for 9 volumes of blood ) in the presence of 1 m M acetylsalicylic acid to prevent TxA 2 endogenous synthesis . Platelet - rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 120 3 g for 15 min at room temperature . For some experiments , part of the platelet - rich plasma was incubated with 1 m M GR 32191 , a TP antagonist , for 30 min at room temperature to block the TP low affinity binding sites , with the other part serving as control . Platelets were isolated by centrifugation at 1 , 200 3 g for 15 min , resuspended in washing buffer , pH 6 ( 140 m M NaCl , 5 m M KCl , 12 m M Na 3 citrate , 10 m M glucose , 12 . 5 m M sucrose ) in the presence of 0 . 1 m M prostaglandin E 1 and recentrifuged for 15 min at 1 , 200 3 g before resuspension in Hanks’ buffer , pH 7 . 4 ( 0 . 44 m M KH 2 PO 4 , 137 m M NaCl , 5 . 4 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 34 m M Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 . 5 m M glucose , 1 . 8 m M CaCl 2 ) . Aggregation and Shape Change Assays— Platelets ( 0 . 4 ml , 3 3 10 8 platelets / ml ) were preincubated without stirring for 1 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of SQ 29548 ( 10 m M ) , an antagonist of TP . Platelet activation was initiated in an aggregometer cuvette with con - stant stirring , by the addition of ( i ) a low concentration of I - BOP ( 1 n M ) , ( ii ) 8 - epi - PGF 2 a ( 5 m M ) , or ( iii ) a high concentration of I - BOP ( 10 n M ) to platelets pretreated with 1 m M GR 32191 , as described in the previous section . These three different stimulations only induce shape change . In some experiments , platelets were preincubated for 2 min with 100 m M cytochalasin D , 1 m M tyrphostin A23 or A1 , or an equivalent volume of Me 2 SO . The addition of a high concentration of I - BOP to platelets not treated with GR 32191 at the platelet - rich plasma level led to aggrega - tion , which was monitored by light transmission in a Chronolog aggre - gometer and expressed as the percentage change in light transmission with the blank sample ( buffer without platelets ) defined as 100 % . Shape change , which takes place within the first 30 s after the I - BOP addition as a decrease in light transmission , was measured as a major deflection and expressed in millimeters . The electrical sensitivity of the recorder was increased to quantify the shape change better . Stimulation was stopped each time with 100 m l of lysis solution ( 2 % SDS , 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M sodium orthovanadate , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 50 m M NaF , 0 . 5 m M Pefabloc ) , and samples were stored at 2 20 °C . Immunoblotting Studies— Platelet lysates were heated for 30 min at 60 °C in the presence of b - mercaptoethanol ( 5 % w / v ) . Proteins were separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7 % polyacryl - amide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer system ( Hoeffer ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech . ) . Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating membranes with TBS ( 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 137 m M NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) containing 5 % ( w / v ) low fat powder milk before the incubation with anti - phosphoty - rosine mAb ( 1 : 5000 ) for 60 min at room temperature . After washing with TBS , bound primary antibodies were detected after incubation with sheep anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase - conjugated IgG for 60 min . Membranes were further washed in TBS and treated with ECL reagents . Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemilumines - cence according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Tyrosine - phosphorylated protein bands were measured by laser den - sitometry ( Ultroscan XL ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Phosphoryl - ation intensity was expressed in arbitrary units in - fold over basal level at time 0 . Immunoprecipitation Studies— Platelet suspensions ( 0 . 4 ml , 6 3 10 8 platelets / ml ) , obtained as described above , were lysed in an equal vol - ume of ice - cold modified radioimmune precipitation buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 150 m M NaCl , 0 . 5 % deoxycholic acid , 1 m M EGTA , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 m M Pefabloc , 50 m M NaF ) . Insoluble cell fractions were removed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 3 g at 4 °C for 10 min . Cortactin ( p80 / 85 ) was immunoprecipitated using 5 m g of mouse anti - cortactin mAb and 5 m g of rabbit anti - mouse IgG pAb . After a 1 - h incubation at 4 °C , protein A - Sepharose was added for 3 h at 4 °C . Syk kinase was immunoprecipitated using 3 m g of rabbit anti - Syk kinase pAb under similar conditions . After three washings in modified radio - immune precipitation buffer , immunoprecipitates were recovered in Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions , subjected to SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane , and immunoblotted with ( i ) anti - phosphotyrosine mAb ( 1 : 5000 ) , ( ii ) anti - cortactin mAb ( 1 : 1000 ) , or ( iii ) anti - Syk pAb ( 1 : 1000 ) . In Vitro Syk Kinase Assay— Syk kinase activation was evaluated as autophosphorylation activity as described previously ( 17 ) . Following stimulation with I - BOP , platelets ( 1 . 2 ml ; 6 3 10 8 platelets / ml ) were lysed in a buffer containing 10 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 50 m M NaCl , 1 m M sodium orthovanadate , 1 m M Pefabloc , 30 m M sodium pyrophosphate , 50 m M NaF ) . Clarified platelet lysates were immunoprecipitated with 3 m g of anti - Syk pAb for 1 h at 4 °C . To examine the autophosphorylating activity of Syk kinase , the immuno - precipitates were washed in the same buffer twice ; washed once in 10 m M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 100 m M NaCl , 5 m M MnCl 2 ; and then incubated in 25 m l of kinase assay buffer ( 10 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 5 m M MnCl 2 , 1 m M ATP ) containing 10 m Ci of [ g - 32 P ] ATP for 15 min at 25 °C . The reaction was stopped by washing with 1 ml of ice - cold buffer B . Immunopre - cipitates were recovered in Laemmli sample buffer before being sub - jected to 7 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane . Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography . RESULTS I - BOP - induced Platelet Activation— The addition of 10 n M of I - BOP to washed platelets for 2 min with constant stirring caused the platelets to aggregate . Fig . 1 shows that the light transmission after 2 - min stimulation was about 40 % . The in - crease in light transmission was preceded by a decrease in light transmission in the 10 first seconds , which corresponded to a shape change ( Fig . 1 A ) . In contrast , the addition of 1 n M of Phosphorylation of Syk - associated Cortactin 23611 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 22 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m I - BOP only induced the shape change in the absence of any aggregation ( Fig . 1 A ) . Fig . 1 B shows the shape change at high and low concentra - tions of I - BOP . The addition of the TP antagonist SQ 29548 ( Fig . 1 C ) inhibited the I - BOP - induced platelet aggregation and the shape change , which was observed whether the I - BOP concentration was high or low . Effect of I - BOP and 8 - epi - PGF 2 a on Tyrosine Phosphoryla - tion— In the absence of I - BOP ( Fig . 2 ) , only a few proteins were significantly phosphorylated at tyrosine residues , including the 60 - kDa protein previously identified as the Src kinase and the 64 - and the 130 - kDa bands . After 20 - and 90 - s stimulation with 10 n M I - BOP , phosphorylation of these substrates increased and additional tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins appeared with molecular masses of 80 / 85 , 100 / 105 , and 130 kDa . The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the in - crease in platelet aggregation , which reached about 40 % at 90 s ( Fig . 2 ) . In the absence of platelet aggregation , 20 – 90 - s stimulation with 1 n M of I - BOP resulted in a shape change of 16 mm . Under these conditions , we only observed the additional tyrosine - phosphorylated band of 80 kDa , which slightly decreases at 90 s ( Fig . 2 ) . The treatment of platelets with SQ 29548 inhib - ited the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by low or high concentrations of I - BOP . This inhibition was accompanied by the inhibition of shape change and aggregation . Two other conditions induced platelet shape change in the absence of aggregation . Platelets were stimulated either with high concentrations of I - BOP after pretreatment with GR 32191 or with 5 m M of 8 - epi - PGF 2 a ( Fig . 3 B ) . Fig . 3 A shows that when platelets were pretreated with GR 32191 before the ad - dition of 10 n M I - BOP ( middle ) , or when they are stimulated with 8 - epi - PGF 2 a for 30 s ( bottom ) , the tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of 80 - kDa substrate was the major substrate obtained . As in the presence of 1 n M I - BOP , the addition of SQ 29548 inhib - ited both the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80 - kDa substrate ( Fig . 3 A ) and the shape change observed under these conditions ( Fig . 3 B ) . Quantification by densitometry demonstrates that the level of phosphorylation of 80 kDa is increased by about 10 - fold upon stimulation with low concentrations of I - BOP , 8 - fold with 8 - epi - PGF 2 a , or 5 - fold upon high concentrations of I - BOP after pre - treatment with GR 32191 . However , this represents a much lower level of phosphorylation than that obtained upon stimu - lation with high concentrations of I - BOP ( 30 - fold over the basal level ) ( Fig . 3 C ) . The results confirm that tyrosine phosphoryl - ation of the 80 - kDa band is subjected to two different waves of phosphorylation , the second one due to the integrin engage - ment ( 13 ) . Immunoprecipitation of Cortactin— The 80 - kDa band ap - peared as the main phosphorylated substrate obtained during the early steps of platelet activation . Cortactin is a cytoskeletal tyrosine - phosphorylated protein that migrates as a doublet within the 80 - kDa range and was reported previously to be tyrosine - phosphorylated in activated platelets ( 13 ) . We in - tended to analyze further whether the 80 kDa corresponded to cortactin . We thus immunoprecipitated I - BOP - ( 1 n M ) and 8 - epi - PGF 2 a - activated platelet lysates with a mAb specific for cortactin , followed by Western blot analysis with an anti - phos - photyrosine Ab ( Anti - PY ) . Fig . 4 ( top ) shows that an 80 / 85 - kDa phosphorylated doublet corresponding to cortactin was obtained in platelets stimulated by I - BOP or 8 - epi - PGF 2 a , whereas it was strongly abolished when platelets were pretreated with SQ 29548 . No phospho - rylated doublet was observed either in resting platelets ( I - BOP and 8 - epi , Fig . 4 , top ) or in the presence of SQ 29548 alone ( not shown ) . Blotting of the immunoprecipitates with the anti - cor - tactin mAb showed constant distribution of cortactin protein under the different conditions ( Fig . 4 , bottom ) . Effect of Protein - tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor A23 and Cytocha - lasin D on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cortactin and Shape Change— Shape change was induced either by low concentra - tions of 8 - epi - PGF 2 a or I - BOP . Preincubation of platelets with the protein - tyrosine kinase inhibitor , tyrphostin A23 at 1 m M inhibited both platelet shape change and tyrosine phosphoryl - ation of the cortactin ( Fig . 5 A ) . Scanner densitometry indicates that upon stimulation by 8 - epi - PGF 2 a or I - BOP , the level of phosphorylation of cortactin returns to the basal level in the presence of A23 , whereas the structurally inactive analogue tyrphostin A1 slightly decreases the level by 25 % ( Fig . 5 C ) . By preincubation of platelets with 10 m M cytochalasin D , which induces depolymerization of cytoplasmic actin , cortactin phos - phorylation and shape change induced by I - BOP were also inhibited ( Fig . 5 B ) . I - BOP - induced Syk Kinase Phosphorylation and Activity : As - sociation of Cortactin with Syk— The kinase activities respon - sible for the phosphorylation of cortactin are not well defined in platelets activated with thromboxane analogues . We wondered whether the 72 - kDa Syk tyrosine kinase , which exhibits early activation during platelet activation ( 18 ) , would be a potential candidate for cortactin phosphorylation throughout I - BOP - in - duced shape change . We first examined whether I - BOP activated Syk in platelets . After I - BOP stimulation , platelets were solubilized as de - F IG . 1 . Effect of two concentrations of I - BOP on platelet shape change and aggregation . 10 n M I - BOP induced platelet aggregation and shape change ( A and B , respectively ) , whereas 1 n M I - BOP only induced shape change . SQ 29548 ( 10 m M ) , the TP antagonist , inhibited platelet aggregation and shape change at both I - BOP concentrations ( C ) .

Fig . 6 A shows that Syk is tyrosine - phosphorylated in response to low concentrations of I - BOP ( 1 n M ) at early times ( 10 and 20 s ) followed by a slight dephosphorylation ( line 1 ) . Then an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Syk kinase activity was in - creased at 10 and 20 s after I - BOP stimulation and then F IG . 2 . Time - and concentration - de - pendent effects of I - BOP on protein tyrosine phosphorylation of human platelets . Platelets were incubated alone ( control ) or in the presence of 1 n M of I - BOP or 10 n M of I - BOP . When indicated , platelets were pretreated with 10 m M SQ 29548 , the TP antagonist . Total platelet lysates were analyzed directly for tyrosine - phosphorylated substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Values corresponding to shape change or aggre - gation are indicated for each concentration of I - BOP and time stimulation . These re - sults are representative of four similar experiments . F IG . 3 . Detection of the tyrosine - phosphorylated substrate of 80 kDa ( arrowhead ) under three conditions of platelet shape change : tyrosine phosphorylation ( A ) , shape change ( B ) , and quantification of the tyro - sine phosphorylated substrate of 80 kDa ( C ) . A , tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80 - kDa band . Platelets were stimu - lated for 30 s in the presence of either low concentrations of I - BOP ( 1 n M ) ( top ) , or high concentrations of I - BOP ( 10 n M ) be - fore and after pretreatment of platelets with GR 32191 ( middle ) or 5 m M 8 - epi - PGF 2 a ( bottom ) . In each case , the addi - tion of SQ 29548 prior to the addition of the thromboxane analogue inhibited tyro - sine phosphorylation of the 80 - kDa sub - strate . B , shape change is induced by high concentrations of I - BOP ( 10 n M ) after pre - treatment of platelets with GR 32191 or 5 m M of 8 - epi - PGF 2 a . In each case , the ad - dition of SQ prior to the addition of the thromboxane analogue inhibited the shape change . C , quantification of the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80 - kDa band under different conditions . Auto - luminograms were scanned with a laser densitometer , and results were expressed as described under “Experimental Proce - dures . ” Values are the means 6 S .

To address the relation between Syk activation and phosphorylation of cortactin , the same blots were immunoblotted with anti - cortactin antibody . Line 3 shows that there was an increased association of cortac - tin at early times ( 10 and 20 s ) after stimulation , whereas the association decreased at 90 s . It is noteworthy that cortactin seems to be associated with Syk even in the absence of stimu - lation by I - BOP ( Fig . 6 A , line 3 ) . The amount of precipitated Syk did not change throughout the time course judging from the immunoblot analysis with anti - human Syk mAb ( Anti - Syk ) ( line 4 ) . In our experiments , Syk could not be detected in the immu - noprecipitates with anti - cortactin mAb . One possibility is that the anti - cortactin mAb destabilized cortactin - Syk complexes . A similar observation was described in K 562 cells ( 29 ) . Finally , SQ 29548 inhibited Syk phosphorylation at all times ( Fig . 6 B ) , indicating the specificity of the signal sent by the activated TP receptor . We have shown previously that A23 inhibited cortactin phos - phorylation upon stimulation by low concentrations of I - BOP . We wondered if the tyrosine kinase inhibitor would affect the association of cortactin with Syk . Fig . 6 C shows that A23 in - hibits not only the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk in response to low concentrations of I - BOP at early times ( 20 s ) ( line 1 ) but also the association of cortactin , which was previously detected ( line 2 ) . The amount of precipitated Syk did not change throughout the different conditions ( line 3 ) . DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrate that upon stimulation of plate - lets by low concentrations of I - BOP or by high concentrations in platelets pretreated with GR 32191 ( which blocks the low af - finity sites involved in aggregation ) or 8 - epi - PGF 2 a , there is a rapid stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of the F IG . 4 . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin after immuno - precipitation from I - BOP - and 8 - epi - PGF 2 a - activated platelets for 30 s .

Immunoprecipitates were im - munoblotted using an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( Anti - PY ) ( top ) . Immunoblot analysis with an anti - cortactin mAb ( Anti - cortactin ) ( bot - tom ) was performed to check the efficiency of cortactin immunoprecipi - tation .

Phosphorylation of Syk - associated Cortactin 23614 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 22 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 80 / 85 - kDa doublet identified by immunoprecipitation as the cytoskeletal protein cortactin . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cor - tactin is kinetically correlated with the occurrence of shape change . These effects therefore appear to be mediated by re - ceptors with high affinity for I - BOP . The molecular basis for this functional segregation of phar - macological TP receptors subtypes is unclear . A single gene encodes the human TP receptor ( 19 ) , of which there are two identified splice variants , TP a and TP b ( 20 ) . Although mRNA for these isoforms has been described in human platelets ( 21 ) , there was no information that related either TP a or TP b to the subtypes of TPs that have been defined pharmacologically as high or low affinity receptors . However , it has recently been shown that TP a was the major isoform expressed in platelets and that rapidly induced phosphorylation of the TP a by high I - BOP concentrations appeared to involve low affinity binding sites . However , neither low I - BOP concentrations ( which in - duce platelet shape change ) nor high agonist concentrations on platelets pretreated with GR 32191 ( which blocks the low af - finity sites ) cause TP a phosphorylation ( 22 ) . The inhibition of both tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin as well as platelet shape change by SQ 29548 ( 23 ) demon - strates the role of the TP receptor inducing these biochemical and morphological events . Cortactin was initially described as a 80 / 85 - kDa p60 c - Src substrate . It was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in v - Src - transformed chicken embryo cells ( 24 ) . In normal cells , cortac - tin is known to be phosphorylated in response to various stim - ulants including growth factor and thrombin ( 25 – 27 ) . In platelets , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and activation of Syk were induced by thrombin treatment both in the pres - ence or absence of integrin engagement ( 13 , 28 ) . Moreover , a direct association between Syk and cortactin has been demon - strated at an early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation in K 562 cells upon TPA stimulation ( 29 ) . The following evidence suggests here that cortactin could be a substrate for Syk at low I - BOP concentrations . ( i ) p72 Syk phosphorylation took place during the period when platelets were changing shape ( 10 – 30 s ) . This phosphorylation is accom - panied by a kinase activity . ( ii ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is kinetically correlated with the activation of Syk kinase . ( iii ) Cortactin is associated with Syk , and this associa - tion increases along with the level of phosphorylation . A slight association of cortactin with Syk is already detected before I - BOP stimulation . The same results were observed when K 562 cells were stimulated with 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( 29 ) . Thus , these data indicate that the kinase activity and tyro - sine phosphorylation of p72 Syk can be induced through a G protein coupled to TP receptors of high affinity . TP receptors of human platelets are known to couple endogenously to at least four G proteins ( G a q , G a 12 , G a 13 , and G a i2 ) . The low affinity platelet TP receptor that mediates platelet aggregation seems to be regulated via G a q ( 6 ) , but no data were available for possible G proteins mediating platelet shape change via the apparent high affinity TP receptor . Allan et al . ( 10 ) present the first pharmacological evidence that at least two of the G a proteins ( G a q and G a 13 ) thought to interact with the human platelet TP receptors are capable of regulating the affinity state of the megakaryocyte - like HEL cell TP receptor . G a 13 appears to increase the affinity of the HEL TP receptor for 125 I - labeled I - BOP , although G a q does not increase the affinity to the same extent . Moreover , platelets from mice deficient in G a q can still change shape but do not aggregate after the addition of U 46619 , a thromboxane analogue , therefore emphasizing the coupling of the low affinity TP receptors to G a q ( 30 ) . Taking into account these two observations , it is suggested that high affinity TP receptors could be regulated via G a 13 . This novel pathway would lead to Syk activation necessary for the phos - phorylation of cortactin , a specific substrate that accompanies platelet shape change . It is noteworthy that Syk activation , cortactin phosphorylation , and shape change are kinetically correlated . What would be the role of cortactin phosphorylation within F IG . 6 . Activation of Syk kinase in response to stimulation by I - BOP and association of cortactin with Syk : Effect of A23 , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor . A , platelets were stimulated by 1 n M I - BOP and solubilized at the indicated times . Syk was immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti - human Syk pAb . Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti - phosphotyrosine mAb ( anti - PY ) ( line 1 ) . Each immunoprecipitate was submitted to an in vitro kinase assay ( line 2 ) . To detect the association of cortactin with Syk , the Syk immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti - cortactin mAb ( line 3 ) . Each immunoprecipitated sample was immunoblotted with anti - human Syk pAb to control for efficiency of Syk immunoprecipitation ( line 4 ) . B , platelets were stimulated for 20 and 90 s by 1 n M I - BOP in the absence ( 2 ) or presence ( 1 ) of SQ 29548 . Syk was immunoprecipitated with an anti - human Syk pAb , and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with an anti - PY mAb . SQ 29548 incubated with platelets prior to the addition of I - BOP inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk at 20 and 90 s . C , platelets were stimulated for 20 s by 1 n M I - BOP in the absence or presence of A23 . Syk was immunoprecipitated with anti - human Syk pAb , and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with an anti - PY mAb ( line 1 ) . To detect the association of cortactin with Syk , the Syk immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti - cortactin mAb ( line 2 ) . Line 3 shows the control for efficiency of Syk immunoprecipitation . All of these experiments were done on the same sample and were replicated three times .

Cortactin is an F - actin - binding protein primarily localized at cortical structures and is thought to be important for microfilament - membrane interactions ( 13 ) . Cortactin also has an F - actin cross - linking activity and is implicated in cy - toskeletal reorganization . According to Huang et al . ( 31 ) , cor - tactin may act as an important mediator for intracellular tyro - sine kinases in regulating cytoskeletal reorganization in vivo . The same authors provide evidence for the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the migration of endo - thelial cells ( 32 ) . Furthermore , there is recent evidence for important roles of cortactin in the formation and regulation of cell - cell adhesion and communication during growth , differen - tiation , and tumorigenesis ( 33 ) . All of these cellular processes involve dramatic changes in the cortical cytoskeleton and emphasize the role of cortactin in cell morphological changes . In platelets , actin polymerization and membrane cytoskele - ton depolymerization are required for early shape change ( 34 , 35 ) . Previous data have also demonstrated that an early pool of phosphorylated cortactin translocates to the cytoskeleton ( 36 ) . This suggests that cortactin could play a role in cytoskeletal movements that support shape change . Our data indicate that phosphorylation of cortactin is dependent on the formation of actin skeleton , since its disruption by cytochalasin D signifi - cantly inhibits both phosphorylation and shape change . Our data also point to a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the induction of shape change elicited by high affinity TP receptor activation , since a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , tyrphostin A23 , inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin together with shape change , whereas the inactive analogue , tyrphostin A1 , had no inhibitory activity . It is also noteworthy that cortactin does not any more associate to Syk in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation . Besides the role of cortactin in the cytoskel - etal reorganization , it is also possible that tyrosine phospho - rylation may promote its binding to cellular proteins contain - ing Src homology 2 domains . Lastly , the structure of cortactin contains several potential signaling motifs including Src ho - mology 3 domain at the distal C terminus ( 37 ) . A novel cortac - tin - binding protein ( cortactin - binding protein 1 ) expressed pre - dominantly in brain tissue and colocalized with cortical actin filaments in fibroblasts has recently been identified . The Src homology 3 domain of cortactin was found to direct this inter - action ( 37 ) . All of these observations strongly suggest that cortactin mediates formation of the multiprotein complexes within the cortical cytoskeleton and may serve as a cortical actin - specific docking protein for binding partners . In conclusion , we describe a novel pathway for a G protein - coupled TxA 2 high affinity receptor to the protein - tyrosine ki - nase Syk , which associates with a specific protein substrate , cortactin , involved in the very early steps of platelet activation , such as shape change and which requires cytoskeletal reorganization . The tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk raises the problem of its activation . Gao et al . ( 28 ) indicate that engagement of the integrin GPIIb / IIIa causes an increase in the catalytic activity of the tyrosine kinase Src required for induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk . However , Syk activation does not seem to be strictly dependent on Src kinases under all conditions ( 38 , 39 ) . How Syk undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in the ab - sence of fibrinogen binding to GPIIb / IIIa and aggregation re - mains to be elucidated . REFERENCES 1 . Halushka , P . V . , Allan , C .
