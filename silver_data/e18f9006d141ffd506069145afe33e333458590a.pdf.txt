Introduction Advance - purchase discounts ( introductory offers , early - booker discounts ) have frequently been used in the sale of products such as holiday packages , hotel rooms , rental car hires , airline tickets , and conferences . While one may argue that , in these examples , a ﬁrm’s pricing policy is affected by limited capacity , capacity constraints are largely absent in the digital economy where the use of advance - purchase discounts is also common . For example , amazon . com offers large discounts for pre - release orders of DVDs . Similarly , Apple’s iTunes offers exclusive bonus tracks for pre - release orders of music albums . A theory of advance - purchase discounts that is applicable to the digital economy should therefore not rely on limited capacity . In this paper , we provide such a theory , based on price discrimination . The starting point of our theory is the observation that consumers are likely to face uncertainty about their valuation when the time of consumption is far ahead in the future . Consider the following two - period problem of a monopolist selling a product with a ﬁxed consumption or delivery date and committing to a price path . Consumers can buy either at the early date ( before individual uncertainty is resolved ) or at the late date ( after individual uncertainty is resolved ) . At the early date , consumers only know their expected valuation . Suppose that all consumers have the same expected valuation ( but differ in their ex - post valuations ) . By selling the good at the early date only ( “advance selling” ) , the monopolist can extract all of the expected consumer surplus ( namely , by charging an advance - selling price equal to consumers’ common expected valuation ) . Such an advance - selling policy is clearly proﬁt - maximizing , provided it is ex - post efﬁcient to sell to all consumers . However , if the ex - post valuation of some consumers is lower than the unit cost of producing the good , it might be better for the monopolist to sell the good at the late date only ( “spot selling” ) . While spot selling does not allow the monopolist to extract all of the consumer surplus ( because of heterogeneity in ex - post valuations ) , it yields an ex - post efﬁcient allocation conditional on a given level of output . As shown by Courty [ 3 ] , the optimal pricing policy of the monopolist consists in advance selling if the unit cost of production is below a certain threshold and in spot selling otherwise . Advance - purchase discounts ( where some consumers purchase at the early date and others at the late date ) cannot be optimal in this simple setting because consumers are ex - ante identical . In our model , consumers differ in their expected valuations . If the monopolist offers an advance - purchase discount ( i . e . , an increasing price path ) , consumers face a trade - off : they can either buy early at a discount or else wait and make their purchasing decision dependent on the actual realization of their valuation . Consumers with a high expected valuation will optimally purchase the good at the early date whereas consumers with a low expected valuation will buy the good at the late date ( provided their ex - post valuation exceeds the price of the good at that date ) . That is , by offering an advance - purchase discount , the monopolist effectively discrimi - nates between consumers on the basis of their expected valuations . 3 We provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition under which the monopolist’s optimal intertemporal pricing policy involves such an advance - purchase discount . In the next section , we present our baseline model where the ( binary ) distribution of “shocks” to consumers’ valuations is the same for all consumers , independently of their expected valu - ations . That is , we focus on consumer heterogeneity in expected valuations , abstracting from 3 For this discrimination to be effective , secondary markets should be closed down by the monopolist unless they can operate only at high costs for consumers . For instance , if the contract is personalized , a secondary market cannot be active . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 143 heterogeneity in the degree of uncertainty . In Section 3 , we allow the monopolist to choose amongst simple pricing policies : advance selling ( where all sales occur at the early date ) , spot selling ( where all sales occur at the later date ) , and advance - purchase discounts ( where some sales occur at the early date and some at the later date ) . We show that – even though all consumers face the same type of demand uncertainty – the monopolist may optimally use advance - purchase discounts . We provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for this to be the case . In Section 4 , we consider an extended model where the shock to consumers’ valuations is a function of the expected valuation . This allows us to analyze heterogeneity in the degree of uncertainty , while retaining the assumption that the distribution of consumer types is one - dimensional . In addition , we extend the model by introducing gradual resolution of uncertainty : consumers receive signals about their ex - post valuations at some intermediate date ( s ) . This al - lows us to analyze whether the monopolist may want to further discriminate between consumers based on such signals . Adopting a mechanism design approach , we show that the optimal mech - anism can always be implemented by a simple pricing policy at which sales are made only at an early date or at a late date ( or both ) but not at intermediate dates . We provide a neces - sary and sufﬁcient condition for the optimality of each one of the three simple pricing policies ( advance - purchase discounts , advance selling , and spot selling ) . In particular , advance - purchase discounts are optimal if consumer heterogeneity is sufﬁciently large ; in that sense , the optimality of advance - purchase discounts emerges as the “normal” case . Related literature . Our paper contributes to the literature on intertemporal pricing . Previous work has identiﬁed a large class of economic environments in which , absent capacity costs , a monopolist will optimally sell all units at the same price ( Riley and Zeckhauser [ 15 ] ; Wilson [ 16 ] ; Courty [ 3 ] ) . Advance - purchase discounts emerge as the optimal pricing policy in a number of economic environments where capacity is scarce and the aggregate level of demand is uncertain ( Gale and Holmes [ 10 , 11 ] , Dana [ 6 – 9 ] ) . Our paper is the ﬁrst to show the optimality of advance - purchase discounts in a setting in which neither scarce capacity nor aggregate demand uncertainty play any role . 4 Our paper is closely related to the analysis of refund contracts by Courty and Li [ 4 ] . However , the techniques of Courty and Li do not apply , in particular , because the distribution of shocks to consumer preferences is continuous in their model but discrete in ours . In Courty and Li , before the individual uncertainty is resolved , consumers choose from a menu of contracts which may include ﬁxed - price contracts and contracts with full or partial refunds . If a consumer has chosen a contract with full or partial refund , he has the option of returning the product for refund after learning his actual valuation . Courty and Li show that the optimal menu of contracts involves both full and partial refund contracts . 5 In this paper , we focus instead on simple intertemporal pricing policies that are relevant in many real - world markets . In Courty and Li’s setting , these simple intertemporal pricing policies correspond to menus that do no contain partial refund contracts . In real - world applications , simple pricing policies have an important advantage over contracts with partial or full refunds : a transaction takes place at one date only ( the date of purchase ) rather 4 In independent recent work , Möller and Watanabe [ 14 ] consider a model with two consumer types in which the seller can ex ante commit to her capacity . They show that advance - purchase discounts can be the preferred pricing policy if capacity costs are zero . 5 Such refund contracts are , in effect , equivalent to option contracts , where a speciﬁed payment at the early date gives the consumer the right to exercise his option to buy the product at a predetermined price at the later date . 144 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 than at two dates ( the date of contracting and the date at which the good is returned ) . 6 We show that these simple pricing policies implement the optimal mechanism in a setting in which the monopolist can pick any , possibly stochastic , mechanism . Hence , the monopolist does not have an incentive in offering more sophisticated contracts even if they were available . However , as we discuss in the paper , this last result does rely on the assumed binary nature of information . In contrast to Courty and Li [ 4 ] , we also allow for gradual resolution of uncertainty and show that the monopolist optimally refrains from using noisy information at some intermediate date . Our paper is also related to the literature on monopoly bundling ( see , e . g . , McAfee , McMillan , and Whinston [ 13 ] ) as one can interpret the consumption of the same good in different states as amounting to consuming different goods . By purchasing the good at the early date ( before the preference shock is realized ) , a consumer effectively buys a consumption bundle , namely the right to consume the good in all states of nature . Advance - purchase discounts are , therefore , akin to mixed bundling . Relating our paper to the literature on information acquisition ( see , e . g . , Cremer and Khalil [ 5 ] , Lewis and Sappington [ 12 ] , and , in particular , Bar - Isaac , Caruana and Cunat [ 2 ] ) , the price difference between the late and the early date can be interpreted as the information acquisi - tion cost that a consumer has to incur so as to learn his willingness - to - pay . Hence , in our setting , the information acquisition cost is endogenous and controlled by the monopolist . In situations in which the monopolist optimally chooses advance - purchase discounts , the proﬁt - maximizing information acquisition cost takes a strictly positive ( and ﬁnite ) value . 2 . A simple model Consider a monopolist ( “she” ) who can choose to sell a product at two different dates , t = 0 and t = 1 , at prices p 0 ∈ R + ∪ { ∞ } and p 1 ∈ R + ∪ { ∞ } , respectively , and , prior to t = 0 , publicly commits to a price path ( p 0 , p 1 ) . We write p t = ∞ if she does not make the product available at date t . The monopolist can produce any quantity of the good at constant marginal cost c (cid:2) 0 . There is a unit mass of consumers with unit demand . A consumer is described by his type r , which denotes the expected valuation of the good . The consumer’s ex - post valuation of the good is a random variable v ( r ) with conditional expectation E [ v ( r ) | r ] = r . The random vari - able v ( r ) can take one of two values , a high value v H ( r ) with probability λ H and a low value v L ( r ) < v H ( r ) with the remaining probability λ L = 1 − λ H . 7 We assume v z ( r ) = r + α z for z ∈ { L , H } . That is , we assume here that the “shock” to the consumer’s valuation , α z , is indepen - dent of the consumer’s type r , where , by construction , the expected value of the shock is zero , λ L α L + λ H α H = 0 , and α H > 0 > α L . An alternative and equivalent interpretation is that the consumer derives a non - random utility from consumption of the good but that the value of the next - best alternative ( the consumer’s outside option ) is uncertain . ( Think of the chance of being invited to a party as an alternative to a concert for which you consider buying a ticket . ) We assume that the realization of the random variable is independent across consumers . That is , there is no aggregate uncertainty . At t = 0 , each consumer privately learns his own type r . At 6 Another advantage is that consumers contract sequentially under advance - purchase discounts . Thus , consumers who were initially not aware of the good can still purchase the good at a later date . Our formal analysis can be extended to allow for this possibility . 7 While the binary nature of uncertainty may feel special , consumers often face uncertainty of the yes / no - type in the real world . For example , the utility I get from attending a concert may greatly depend on whether or not my date shows up . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 145 t = 1 , each consumer privately learns the realization of his valuation v ( r ) . Consumption takes place after t = 1 . If a consumer with valuation v purchases the good ( at either date ) at price p , his ( ex post ) surplus from consuming the good is v − p . If he does not purchase the good , the surplus is zero . Consumers differ in their expected valuation r . The cumulative distribution function over r is denoted by F : R + → [ 0 , 1 ] . We assume that F is continuous on R + and has a density f which takes values f ( r ) > 0 for all r ∈ ( r , r ) and f ( r ) = 0 for all r / ∈ [ r , r ] , and is continuous on [ r , r ] . Note that we allow for f ( r ) and f ( r ) to be zero or strictly positive . The upper bound of the support may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite : r ∈ ( r , ∞ ) ∪ { ∞ } . To avoid negative realizations , we assume that r (cid:2) − α L . Furthermore , the distribution of r has a ﬁnite mean : (cid:2) rr rf ( r ) d r < ∞ . Throughout this paper we make the monotone hazard rate assumption with respect to F . Assumption . The hazard rate f ( · ) / ( 1 − F ( · ) ) is strictly increasing in r on the support of F . The monotone hazard rate assumption is satisﬁed if and only if 1 − F is strictly log - concave and holds for a variety of parametric distribution functions ( see e . g . Bagnoli and Bergstrom [ 1 ] ) . Taking limits of the inverse hazard rate , we deﬁne φ ≡ lim r ↓ r 1 − F ( r ) f ( r ) and φ ≡ lim r ↑ r 1 − F ( r ) f ( r ) . Under the monotone hazard rate assumption , φ ∈ R + ∪ { ∞ } and φ ∈ R + with 0 (cid:3) φ < φ . Note that f ( r ) > 0 implies φ = 0 . To make the standard monopoly pricing problem at date t = 0 well deﬁned and non - trivial , we assume r > c + φ . 3 . Optimal intertemporal price discrimination The strategy of the monopolist is given by the price path ( p 0 , p 1 ) . Each price path is an element of one of three “classes” of simple pricing policies . First , an advance - purchase discount ( APD ) policy is deﬁned by prices p 0 < p 1 that induce strictly positive demand at both dates . Second , an advance - selling policy is deﬁned by an increasing price path ( p 0 , p 1 ) with p 0 < p 1 that induces positive demand at t = 0 only . This advance - selling policy is payoff - equivalent to ( p 0 , ∞ ) , that is , the monopolist sells the product at t = 0 only . Third , a spot - selling policy is deﬁned by a decreasing price path , ( p 0 , p 1 ) with p 0 (cid:2) p 1 . A decreasing price path necessarily induces positive demand at t = 1 only . This spot - selling policy is payoff - equivalent to ( ∞ , p 1 ) , that is , the monopolist sells the product at t = 1 only . In the following , we ﬁrst characterize the proﬁt - maximizing APD policy . We then compare this policy to the proﬁt - maximizing advance - selling and spot - selling policies . Furthermore , we provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition under which the monopolist’s optimal simple pricing policy involves advance - purchase discounts . Finally , we brieﬂy discuss the welfare effects of prohibiting APD policies . We ﬁrst derive the monopolist’s optimal APD policy . Suppose that consumers face an in - creasing price path p 0 < p 1 . If a consumer of type r purchases the good at t = 0 , his ex - pected surplus is r − p 0 . Since the price at date 0 is lower than the price at date 1 , a rational consumer of type r will delay his purchasing decision until t = 1 only if he does not in - tend to buy the good in the event when v ( r ) = v L ( r ) . If r < p 1 − α H , the consumer will not buy the product even when v ( r ) = v H ( r ) . If instead r (cid:2) p 1 − α H , the consumer will purchase the product at t = 1 if and only if v ( r ) = v H ( r ) , and so his expected surplus is 146 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 λ H ( r + α H − p 1 ) . The gain in expected surplus from delaying the purchasing decision until t = 1 is therefore (cid:5) ( r ) ≡ λ H ( r + α H − p 1 ) − ( r − p 0 ) , which is strictly decreasing in r . Let ˜ r = [ p 0 − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) ] / ( 1 − λ H ) denote the consumer type who is indifferent between pur - chasing at t = 0 and delaying the purchasing decision , i . e . , (cid:5) ( ˜ r ) = 0 . If r > ˜ r , the consumer will optimally purchase the product at t = 0 ; if r ∈ [ p 1 − α H , ˜ r ] , he will purchase at t = 1 if and only if v ( r ) = v H ( r ) ; otherwise , if r < p 1 − α H , he will not buy at all . Thus , demand at date 0 is 1 − F ( ˜ r ) , while demand at date 1 is λ H [ F ( ˜ r ) − F ( p 1 − α H ) ] . The monopolist’s proﬁt is π ( p 0 , p 1 ) = ( p 0 − c ) (cid:3) 1 − F ( ˜ r ) (cid:4) + λ H ( p 1 − c ) (cid:5) F ( ˜ r ) if p 1 (cid:3) r + α H , [ F ( ˜ r ) − F ( p 1 − α H ) ] otherwise . ( 1 ) We claim that any proﬁt - maximizing price at date 1 satisﬁes p 1 (cid:2) r + α H . To see this , suppose otherwise . But then the monopolist could increase her proﬁt by raising both prices such that ˜ r ( and , therefore , demand in each period ) remains constant . Lemma 1 . Consider the set of prices p 0 and p 1 such that demand at both dates is posi - tive , i . e . , p 0 < p 1 < min { p 0 + α H , [ p 0 − ( 1 − λ H ) r ] / λ H + α H } . If ∂π ( p 0 , p 1 ) / ∂p 0 < 0 , then ∂π ( p (cid:10) 0 , p 1 ) / ∂p 0 < 0 for all p (cid:10) 0 (cid:2) p 0 . That is , π is quasi - concave in its ﬁrst argument . Proof . Note ﬁrst that ∂π ( p 0 , p 1 ) ∂p 0 = 1 − F (cid:6) p 0 − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H (cid:7) − (cid:8) p 0 1 − λ H − λ H p 1 1 − λ H − c (cid:9) f (cid:6) p 0 − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H (cid:7) . ( 2 ) This expression is negative if and only if (cid:8) p 0 1 − λ H − λ H p 1 1 − λ H − c (cid:9)(cid:5) f ( p 0 − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) 1 − F ( p 0 − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) (cid:10) > 1 . ( 3 ) If ∂π ( p 0 , p 1 ) / ∂p 0 < 0 , then the term in square brackets is positive and strictly increasing in p 0 . The term in curly brackets is positive and , from the monotone hazard rate assumption , strictly increasing in p 0 . Hence , if ∂π ( p 0 , p 1 ) / ∂p 0 < 0 , then ∂π ( p (cid:10) 0 , p 1 ) / ∂p 0 < 0 for p (cid:10) 0 (cid:2) p 0 . (cid:2) The following lemma characterizes the unique candidate of the proﬁt - maximizing APD policy ( ˆ p 0 , ˆ p 1 ) . Lemma 2 . If c − α H > r − φ the candidate for the proﬁt - maximizing APD policy , ( ˆ p 0 , ˆ p 1 ) , is uniquely determined by ˆ p 1 = c + 1 − F ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) f ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) ; ( 4 ) ˆ p 0 = c + λ H 1 − F ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) f ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) + ( 1 − λ H ) (cid:8) 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) (cid:9) . ( 5 ) If c − α H (cid:3) r − φ the candidate for the proﬁt - maximizing APD policy , ( ˆ p 0 , ˆ p 1 ) , is uniquely determined by V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 147 ˆ p 1 = r + α H ; ( 6 ) ˆ p 0 = λ H ( r + α H ) + ( 1 − λ H ) (cid:8) c + 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 − λ H r 1 − λ H ) f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H r 1 − λ H ) (cid:9) . ( 7 ) In both cases , if the price path of the optimal pricing policy induces positive demand at each date , ( ˆ p 0 , ˆ p 1 ) constitutes the optimal APD policy . Proof . The two ﬁrst - order conditions of proﬁt maximization yield ˆ p 0 − c = λ H ( ˆ p 1 − c ) + ( 1 − λ H ) (cid:8) 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) (cid:9) ( 8 ) and ˆ p 1 − c = ( ˆ p 0 − c ) f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) + ( 1 − λ H ) [ F ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) − F ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) ] λ H f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) + ( 1 − λ H ) f ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) . ( 9 ) Inserting ( 8 ) into ( 9 ) , and simplifying , we obtain ( 4 ) . Recall that the optimal APD policy must be such that ˆ p 1 ∈ [ r + α H , r + α H ) . Note that the LHS of ( 4 ) is strictly increasing in ˆ p 1 , while ( by the monotone hazard rate assumption ) the RHS is strictly decreasing in ˆ p 1 . Continuity then implies that if ˆ p 1 ∈ [ r + α H , r + α H ) , it is uniquely determined by Eq . ( 4 ) . Inserting ( 4 ) into ( 8 ) yields Eq . ( 5 ) . By deﬁnition , an APD policy involves positive demand at both dates , i . e . , ˜ r = [ ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) ] / ( 1 − λ H ) ∈ ( ˆ p 1 − α H , r ) . The LHS of ( 5 ) is strictly increasing in ˆ p 0 , while ( by the monotone hazard rate assumption ) the RHS is strictly decreasing in ˆ p 0 . Continu - ity then implies that if ˜ r ∈ ( ˆ p 1 − α H , r ) , ˆ p 0 is uniquely determined by Eq . ( 5 ) . Note also that the monotone hazard rate assumption implies that ˆ p 0 < ˆ p 1 . To see this , suppose otherwise that ˆ p 0 (cid:2) ˆ p 1 . From ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , it follows that 1 − F ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) f ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) (cid:3) 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) . From the monotone hazard rate assumption , ˆ p 1 − α H (cid:2) [ ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) ] / ( 1 − λ H ) , i . e . , ˆ p 1 (cid:2) ˆ p 0 + α H , contradicting that ˆ p 0 (cid:2) ˆ p 1 . The unique solution to ( 4 ) satisﬁes ˆ p 1 > r + α H if and only if c − α H > r − φ . Otherwise , if c − α H (cid:3) r − φ , then ˆ p 1 must be given by the corner solution ˆ p 1 = r + α H . Substituting ˆ p 1 in ( 8 ) and rewriting yields ( 7 ) . The RHS of ( 7 ) is strictly increasing in ˆ p 0 , while ( by the monotone hazard rate assumption ) the RHS is strictly decreasing in ˆ p 0 for ˆ p 0 (cid:3) λ H r + ( 1 − λ H ) r . If ˜ r ∈ ( r , r ) , continuity implies that ˆ p 0 is uniquely determined by ( 7 ) and ˆ p 0 < ˆ p 1 . 8 (cid:2) It can easily be veriﬁed that the price path ( ˆ p 0 , ˆ p 1 ) induces positive demand at both dates only if c < r − α L , i . e . , only if it is efﬁcient to sell to the highest type ( s ) even when v ( r ) = v L ( r ) . 8 We also note that , evaluated at ˆ p 0 = r , the RHS of ( 7 ) is greater or equal to the LHS since c − α H (cid:3) r − φ . Note also that the RHS of ( 7 ) evaluated at ˆ p 0 = r + α H is λ H [ r + α H − c ] + ( 1 − λ H ) [ 1 − F ( r + α H ( 1 − λ H ) ) ] / f ( r + α H ( 1 − λ H ) ) , which is smaller than r + α H − c if and only if r + α H > c + [ 1 − F ( r + α H ( 1 − λ H ) ) ] / f ( r + α H ( 1 − λ H ) ) . Because of the monotone hazard rate assumption , this is implied by r + α H > c + φ . 148 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 We now turn to the characterization of the proﬁt - maximizing advance - selling policy where , by deﬁnition , demand at t = 1 is zero . Under such an advance - selling policy , the monopolist’s proﬁt can be written as π ( p 0 , ∞ ) = ( p 0 − c ) (cid:3) 1 − F ( ˜˜ r ) (cid:4) where ˜˜ r = p 0 denotes the consumer type who is indifferent between purchasing at t = 0 and not purchasing at all . Accordingly , the monopolist solves a standard monopoly problem with demand function 1 − F ( p ) . Let p a ≡ argmax p 0 π ( p 0 , ∞ ) denote the proﬁt - maximizing advance - selling price . Lemma 3 . The proﬁt - maximizing advance - selling price p a is uniquely determined by p a = (cid:5) c + 1 − F ( p a ) f ( p a ) if c > r − φ , r otherwise . ( 10 ) Proof . The ﬁrst - order condition of proﬁt maximization can be rewritten as Ψ ( p 0 ) ≡ 1 f ( p 0 ) ∂π ( p 0 , ∞ ) ∂p 0 = 1 − F ( p 0 ) f ( p 0 ) − ( p 0 − c ) = 0 . Note that lim p 0 ↓ r Ψ ( p 0 ) > 0 if and only if c > r − φ . Further , lim p 0 ↑ r Ψ ( p 0 ) = φ − r + c , which is strictly negative by assumption . By the monotone hazard rate assumption , Ψ is strictly decreasing in p 0 ∈ ( r , r ) . Hence , p a is uniquely determined by Ψ ( p a ) = 0 if c > r − φ , and p a = r otherwise . (cid:2) Intuitively , the monopolist will prefer APD over advance selling ( i ) if marginal cost is high ( since , in this case , it is inefﬁcient to sell to low types when z = L ) and ( ii ) if consumers face a large negative shock , i . e . , − α L is large ( since , in this case , it becomes attractive for the monopo - list to sell to low types only when z = H ) . The following lemma conﬁrms this intuition . Lemma 4 . There exists an APD policy that yields strictly larger proﬁts to the monopolist than the optimal advance - selling policy ( p a , ∞ ) if and only if r − φ < c − α L . Proof . Suppose ﬁrst that c > r − φ , so that p a > r . In this case , the proﬁt from advance selling is equal to π ( p a , p a + α H ) . We show that lim p 1 ↑ p a + α H [ ∂π ( p a , p 1 ) / ∂p 1 ] < 0 : starting from p 0 = p a and p 1 = p a + α H ( where demand at t = 1 is zero ) , the monopolist can increase her proﬁt by marginally reducing her price at date 1 and thereby making sales at date 1 . lim p 1 ↑ p a + σ ∂π ( p a , p 1 ) ∂p 1 = d dp 1 (cid:8)(cid:3) p a − c (cid:4)(cid:8) 1 − F (cid:6) p a − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H (cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11) p 1 = p a + α H + d dp 1 (cid:8) λ H ( p 1 − c ) (cid:8) F (cid:6) p a − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H (cid:7) − F ( p 1 − α H ) (cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:11) (cid:11)(cid:11) p 1 = p a + α H = (cid:3) p a − c (cid:4) λ H 1 − λ H f (cid:3) p a (cid:4) + λ H (cid:3) p a + α H − c (cid:4)(cid:8) − λ H 1 − λ H f (cid:3) p a (cid:4) − f (cid:3) p a (cid:4)(cid:9) = − α H λ H 1 − λ H f (cid:3) p a (cid:4) < 0 . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 149 Suppose now that c (cid:3) r − φ , so that p a = r . Again , the proﬁt from advance selling is equal to π ( p a , p a + α H ) , but now with p a = r . We show that lim p 0 ↓ r [ ∂π ( p 0 , r + α H ) / ∂p 0 ] > 0 if and only if c + α H λ H / ( 1 − λ H ) > r − φ : starting from p 0 = r and p 1 = r + α H ( where demand at t = 1 is zero ) , by marginally increasing her price at date 0 ( and thereby making sales at both dates ) , the monopolist can increase her proﬁt if and only if c + α H > r − φ . To see the “if” part , note that lim p 0 ↓ r ∂π ( p 0 , r + α H ) ∂p 0 = 1 − (cid:8) r − c − λ H 1 − λ H α H (cid:9) f ( r ) , which is positive if and only if c − α L > r − φ ( since − α L = α H λ H / ( 1 − λ H ) ) . To see the “only if” part , note that the assumption that c (cid:3) r − φ implies c − α H < r − φ , and so the candidate for the optimal APD policy is such that p 1 = r + α H . Hence , this policy and the optimal advance - selling policy differ only in the price at date 0 . The assertion then fol - lows from our earlier observation that π is quasi - concave in p 0 for a ﬁxed p 1 ( Lemma 1 ) : if lim p 0 ↓ r [ ∂π ( p 0 , r + α H ) / ∂p 0 ] < 0 , then ∂π ( p 0 , r + α H ) / ∂p 0 < 0 for all p 0 (cid:2) r . (cid:2) Note that if f ( r ) is sufﬁciently small so that φ is sufﬁciently large , there exists an APD policy that necessarily yields higher proﬁts than advance selling . We now turn to the characterization of the proﬁt - maximizing spot - selling policy where , by deﬁnition , demand at t = 0 is zero . Under such a spot - selling policy , the monopolist’s proﬁt can be written as π ( ∞ , p 1 ) = λ H ( p 1 − c ) (cid:12) 1 − F ( p 1 − α H ) (cid:13) + ( 1 − λ H ) ( p 1 − c ) (cid:12) 1 − F ( p 1 − α L ) (cid:13) . Let p s ≡ argmax p 1 π ( ∞ , p 1 ) denote the proﬁt - maximizing spot price . Lemma 5 . The proﬁt - maximizing spot - selling price p s can be characterized as follows . If p s (cid:2) r + α L , the proﬁt - maximizing spot price p s is uniquely determined by p s = (cid:5) c + 1 − F ( p s − α H ) f ( p s − α H ) if c − α H > r − φ , r + α H otherwise . ( 11 ) If p s < r + α L , the proﬁt - maximizing spot price p s satisﬁes p s = c + ( 1 − λ H ) [ 1 − F ( p s − α L ) ] + λ H [ 1 − F ( p s − α H ) ] ( 1 − λ H ) f ( p s − α L ) + λ H f ( p s − α H ) . ( 12 ) Proof . Suppose ﬁrst that p s (cid:2) r + α L , i . e . , each consumer buys the good only when v ( r ) = v H ( r ) if at all . In this case , the monopolist’s proﬁt can be rewritten as π ( ∞ , p 1 ) = λ H ( p 1 − c ) (cid:12) 1 − F ( p 1 − α H ) (cid:13) . By the monotone hazard rate assumption , π ( ∞ , p 1 ) is strictly quasi - concave in p 1 . From the ﬁrst - order condition , the proﬁt - maximizing spot price p s satisﬁes p s = (cid:5) c + 1 − F ( p s − α H ) f ( p s − α H ) if c − α H > r − φ , r + α H otherwise . Suppose now that the spot price satisﬁes p s < r + α L ( i . e . , there are some consumer types that consume independently of the realization of the shock ) . In that case , the monopolist’s proﬁt is given by π ( ∞ , p 1 ) = ( p 1 − c ) (cid:14) λ H (cid:12) 1 − F ( p 1 − α H ) (cid:13) + ( 1 − λ H ) (cid:12) 1 − F ( p 1 − α L ) (cid:13)(cid:15) , 150 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 where F ( p 1 − α H ) = 0 and f ( p 1 − α H ) = 0 if p 1 < r + α H . From the ﬁrst - order condition , the proﬁt - maximizing spot price satisﬁes p s = c + ( 1 − λ H ) [ 1 − F ( p s − α L ) ] + λ H [ 1 − F ( p s − α H ) ] ( 1 − λ H ) f ( p s − α L ) + λ H f ( p s − α H ) . (cid:2) Note that , if p s (cid:2) r + α L , the spot price coincides with the price at t = 1 under the optimal APD policy , p s = ˆ p 1 , as can be seen from Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) . The following lemma shows that spot selling yields higher proﬁts than advance - purchase discounts if and only if it is socially efﬁcient to serve even a consumer of type r only when v ( r ) = v H ( r ) . Lemma 6 . There exists an APD policy that yields strictly larger proﬁts to the monopolist than the optimal spot - selling policy ( ∞ , p s ) if and only if c − α L < r − φ . Proof . Suppose ﬁrst that p s < r + α L . Since π ( ∞ , p s ) = π ( p s , p s ) , spot selling is not optimal if lim p 0 ↑ p s ∂π (cid:3) p 0 , p s (cid:4)(cid:16) ∂p 0 < 0 , i . e . , if introducing a small advance - purchase discount , holding the date - 1 price ﬁxed at p s , in - creases the monopolist’s proﬁt . From ( 2 ) we have lim p 0 ↑ p s ∂π ( p 0 , p s ) ∂p 0 = 1 − F (cid:3) p s − α L (cid:4) − (cid:3) p s − c (cid:4) f (cid:3) p s − α L (cid:4) . This expression is negative if and only if p s − c > 1 − F ( p s − α L ) f ( p s − α L ) . Using ( 12 ) , this inequality can be rewritten as ( 1 − λ H ) [ 1 − F ( p s − α L ) ] + λ H [ 1 − F ( p s − α H ) ] ( 1 − λ H ) f ( p s − α L ) + λ H f ( p s − α H ) > 1 − F ( p s − α L ) f ( p s − α L ) , which is equivalent to 1 − F ( p s − α H ) f ( p s − α H ) > 1 − F ( p s − α L ) f ( p s − α L ) . This inequality is implied by the monotone hazard rate assumption . Suppose second that p s (cid:2) r + α L . We distinguish between two cases : ( i ) r − c + α L > φ , and ( ii ) r − c + α L (cid:3) φ . We begin with case ( i ) , r − c + α L > φ . We show that , starting from any spot - selling policy ( ∞ , p 1 ) , the monopolist can increase her proﬁt by selling to the highest types ε - close to r at date t = 0 at price ˜ p 0 = ( 1 − λ H ) ( r − ε ) + λ H ( p 1 − α H ) while holding the date - 1 price ﬁxed at p 1 , provided ε is sufﬁciently small . To see this , note that ∂π ( ˜ p 0 , p 1 ) ∂p 0 = 1 − F ( r − ε ) − (cid:8) r − ε − λ H α H 1 − λ H − c (cid:9) f ( r − ε ) = 1 − F ( r − ε ) − [ r − ε + α L − c ] f ( r − ε ) . Rearranging and taking the limit as ε → 0 , the RHS becomes negative if and only if r + α L − c < φ ≡ lim r ↑ r 1 − F ( r ) f ( r ) , V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 151 which holds by assumption in case ( i ) . Hence , it cannot be optimal for the monopolist to sell at date t = 1 only if c − α L < r − φ . We now turn to case ( ii ) , r − c + α L (cid:3) φ . We show that , starting from any APD policy ( ˜ p 0 , ˜ p 1 ) – which ( by deﬁnition ) induces positive demand at each date – the ﬁrm can increase its proﬁt by slightly raising the date - 0 price while holding ﬁxed the date - 1 price . From Eq . ( 3 ) , we have ∂π ( ˜ p 0 , ˜ p 1 ) / ∂p 0 > 0 if and only if ˜ r − c + α L < 1 − F ( ˜ r ) f ( ˜ r ) , where ˜ r = [ p 0 − λ H ( p 1 − α H ) ] / ( 1 − λ H ) ∈ ( r , r ) . The LHS is increasing in ˜ r while , by the monotone hazard rate assumption , the RHS is strictly decreasing in ˜ r and converges to φ as ˜ r → r . Hence the inequality is implied by r − c + α L (cid:3) φ , as postulated . By continuity of π , we thus have π ( ˜ p 0 , ˜ p 1 ) < π ( ˜ p 1 , ˜ p 1 ) = π ( ∞ , ˜ p 1 ) (cid:3) π (cid:3) ∞ , p s (cid:4) , i . e . , any APD policy yields strictly lower proﬁts than the optimal spot - selling policy . (cid:2) Using Lemmas 2 , 4 , and 6 , we obtain the main result of this section . Proposition 1 . The monopolist’s unique optimal simple pricing policy involves advance - purchase discounts , characterized in Lemma 2 , if and only if r − φ < c − α L < r − φ . Proof . By Lemma 4 there exist APD policies that yield higher proﬁts than the proﬁt - maximizing advance - selling policy if and only if r − φ < c − α L ; by Lemma 6 there exist APD policies that yield higher proﬁts than the proﬁt - maximizing spot - selling policy if and only if c − α L < r − φ . This implies that the optimal pricing policy must induce positive demand at each date . In this case the monopolist’s optimal pricing policy is the APD policy ( ˆ p 0 , ˆ p 1 ) , which is characterized in Lemma 2 . (cid:2) The proposition implies that , for advance - purchase discounts to be the monopolist’s optimal pricing policy , there must be sufﬁcient heterogeneity in the expected valuation r . In the limit as r → − α L and r → ∞ , the proﬁt - maximizing pricing policy is necessarily an APD policy . In contrast , as heterogeneity in the expected valuation disappears , r − r → 0 , advance - purchase discounts are never optimal . 9 We now brieﬂy discuss the welfare consequences of prohibiting APD policies . We begin by providing a sufﬁcient condition under which such a prohibition is undesirable . Proposition 2 . Suppose that r − φ < c − α H and c − α L < r − φ , the inverse hazard function [ 1 − F ( · ) ] / f ( · ) is weakly convex in r , and the optimal spot - selling price satisﬁes p s (cid:2) r + α L . Then , prohibiting advance - purchase discounts reduces consumer surplus and total surplus ( and makes no consumer better off ) . Proof . Note that since r − φ < c − α H < c − α L < r − φ , by Proposition 1 , the monopolist’s optimal pricing policy involves advance purchase discounts . First , we compare the prices under 9 This conﬁrms the ﬁnding by Courty [ 3 ] who considers the case where all consumers have the same expected valuation , which corresponds to r = r . 152 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 an APD policy with the price under advance selling . We claim that consumers are better off under an APD policy than under advance selling , provided c − α H > r − φ and the inverse hazard function [ 1 − F ( · ) ] / f ( · ) is weakly convex . To prove this claim , we ﬁrst show that ˆ p 1 < p a + α H . To see this , recall from Lemma 3 that the proﬁt - maximizing advance - selling price ( when c − α H > r − φ ) is given by p a = c + 1 − F ( p a ) f ( p a ) . ( 13 ) Evaluating the RHS of this equation at p a = ˆ p 1 − α H yields c + 1 − F ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) f ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) . But , from Lemma 2 , this expression is equal to ˆ p 1 , which is larger than p a at p a = ˆ p 1 − α H . That is , p a < c + 1 − F ( p ) f ( p ) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11) p a = ˆ p 1 − α H . The LHS of the equation is increasing in p a , while the RHS is decreasing in p a ( by the monotone hazard rate assumption ) . Hence , there exists a unique p a > ˆ p 1 − α H that satisﬁes Eq . ( 13 ) . This means that all those consumers with types ˆ p 1 − α H < r < p a − α L are strictly better off under APD than under advance selling . From Lemma 2 , the date - 0 price of the proﬁt - maximizing APD policy is given by ˆ p 0 = λ H (cid:8) c + 1 − F ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) f ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) (cid:9) + ( 1 − λ H ) (cid:8) c + 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) f ( ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) 1 − λ H ) (cid:9) . ( 14 ) We claim that ˆ p 0 (cid:3) p a if the inverse hazard function [ 1 − F ( · ) ] / f ( · ) is weakly convex ( with strict inequality under strict convexity ) . To see this , note that the RHS of Eq . ( 14 ) is a weighted average of c + [ 1 − F ( r (cid:10) ) ] / f ( r (cid:10) ) and c + [ 1 − F ( r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) ] / f ( r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) with weights λ H and 1 − λ H , respectively , and with r (cid:10) = ˆ p 1 − α H and r (cid:10)(cid:10) = [ ˆ p 0 − λ H ( ˆ p 1 − α H ) ] / ( 1 − λ H ) . The same weighted average of r (cid:10) and r (cid:10)(cid:10) is equal to ˆ p 0 : λ H r (cid:10) + ( 1 − λ H ) r (cid:10)(cid:10) = ˆ p 0 . If the inverse hazard function is linear ( which is the case if the distribution of types is uniform ) , it follows that Eq . ( 14 ) can be rewritten as ˆ p 0 = c + [ 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 ) ] / f ( ˆ p 0 ) . Comparing this equation with ( 13 ) , we obtain that ˆ p 0 = p a . More generally , if the inverse hazard function is weakly convex , the RHS of Eq . ( 14 ) is weakly larger than c + [ 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 ) ] / f ( ˆ p 0 ) , so that ˆ p 0 (cid:2) c + [ 1 − F ( ˆ p 0 ) ] / f ( ˆ p 0 ) . By the monotone hazard rate assumption , there exists a unique ˆ p 0 (cid:3) p a that satisﬁes Eq . ( 14 ) . This means that no consumer is worse off under APD than under advance selling . Second , we compare the prices under an APD policy to the price under spot selling . From Lemmas 2 and 5 , it follows that the date - 1 APD price is always equal to the spot - selling price if the optimal spot - selling price satisﬁes p s (cid:2) r + α L . This implies that consumers are better off if the monopolist uses the optimal APD policy rather than the optimal spot - selling policy because some consumers prefer to buy at a discount under APD . (cid:2) Note that the conditions c − α H > r − φ and p s (cid:2) r + α L hold for marginal costs sufﬁciently large . In general , however , the welfare effects of prohibiting APD policies are ambiguous . This may not be too surprising in light of the fact that the welfare effects of second - degree price discrimination are generally ambiguous . For instance , to compare APD with advance selling , V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 153 consider the case c < r − φ In that case , ˆ p 0 > p a = r . Since also ˆ p 1 = r + α H = p a − α H , it is straightforward to see that all consumers are worse or equally well off under APD than under advance selling . As to comparing APD with spot selling , it is possible to show that , if p s < r + α L , at least some consumers are worse off when the monopolist chooses an APD policy . 4 . A mechanism design perspective In this section , we extend the model in two directions . First , we allow for a more general shock structure in which the shock v z ( r ) − r can depend ( in an afﬁne - linear fashion ) on the consumer’s type r . Second , we consider gradual resolution of uncertainty such that the consumer obtains an informative signal about his ex - post valuation at an intermediate date τ . We analyze the extended model by adopting a mechanism design approach . Most importantly , we show that the optimal mechanism can always be implemented by one of our three simple pricing policies – APD , advance selling , spot selling – and provide necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the optimality of each of these policies . In particular , it is not optimal for the monopolist to sell the good to some consumers at the intermediate date τ . 4 . 1 . Model extension In the baseline model , we assumed v z ( r ) = r + α z for z ∈ { L , H } and all r , i . e . , the shock v z ( r ) − r is independent of r . We now generalize by assuming that the shock is an afﬁne - linear function of r : v z ( r ) = α z + β z r , z ∈ { L , H } . Since E [ v ( r ) | r ] = r , we have λ L β L + λ H β H = 1 and λ L α L + λ H α H = 0 . The retained assump - tion that v H ( r ) > v L ( r ) (cid:2) 0 for all r ∈ [ r , r ] imposes additional restrictions on the values of the α z ’s and β z ’s . 10 In the baseline model , we assumed that there are only two selling dates : t = 0 , where each consumer only knows his type ( expected valuation ) r , and t = 1 , where each consumer knows his ex - post valuation v ( r ) . We now extend this model by assuming that each consumer obtains an informative signal s ∈ { l , h } about his ex - post valuation v ( r ) at some intermediate date τ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . The question of interest is whether the monopolist optimally sells the good to some consumers at that date . State s = h occurs with probability ρ h and state s = l with probability ρ l . Conditional on obtaining the signal s , the probability that consumer r ’s ex - post valuation is v z ( r ) is denoted λ sz ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , where λ sL = 1 − λ sH by construction and λ hH > λ lH by the informativeness of the signal , and so λ hL < λ lL . Moreover , Σ s ∈ { l , h } λ sz ρ s ≡ λ z for z ∈ { L , H } . 4 . 2 . A mechanism design analysis We now adopt a mechanism design approach to analyze the extended model . First , we de - scribe a set of direct mechanisms which we obtain when we impose only a part of the relevant incentive compatibility constraints and the ex - ante individual rationality constraint . Then , we 10 In the baseline model , v H ( r ) > v L ( r ) (cid:2) 0 for all r and λ L α L + λ H α H = 0 implied α H > 0 > α L . This is no longer the case here . 154 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 use this larger set of direct mechanisms ( which contains all incentive compatible mechanisms and some that are not incentive compatible ) to derive an upper bound on the proﬁt attained by the optimal incentive compatible mechanism . In the next subsection , we show that this upper bound on proﬁt can always be attained by one of the three simple pricing policies ( APD , advance selling , spot selling ) that do not involve selling at the intermediate date τ . Since consumers obtain information sequentially , we consider the following ( direct ) sequen - tial mechanism . 11 Each consumer ( agent ) announces his type ˆ r ∈ [ r , r ] at date 0 , his signal ˆ s ∈ { l , h } at date τ , and the state of his ex - post valuation ˆ z ∈ { L , H } at date 1 . After observing r , the agent has , at date 0 , the option not to play the mechanism and to obtain an outside value of zero ( individual rationality ) . After date 1 , the consumer is allocated the good with probability q ( ˆ r , ˆ s , ˆ z ) and has to make a payment t ( ˆ r , ˆ s , ˆ z ) to the monopolist ( principal ) . A consumer’s ( pure ) strategy is a collection of functions ˆ r ( r ) ∈ [ r , r ] , ˆ s ( ˆ r | r , s ) ∈ { l , h } and ˆ z ( ˆ r , ˆ s | r , s , z ) ∈ { L , H } de - scribing how previous announcements and information map into announcements . Prior to date 0 , the monopolist commits to a mechanism { q ( ˆ r , ˆ s , ˆ z ) , t ( ˆ r , ˆ s , ˆ z ) } . A consumer’s realized net surplus is u = qv − t ; the monopolist’s proﬁt from this consumer is π = t − qc . We now focus on mechanisms that satisfy the incentive - compatibility constraints at date 0 only , ignoring the constraints at dates τ and 1 . The date - 0 incentive - compatibility constraints are given by E (cid:12) q ( r , s , z ) v − t ( r , s , z ) (cid:11)(cid:11) r (cid:13) (cid:2) E (cid:12) q (cid:3) ˆ r ( · ) , ˆ s ( · ) , ˆ z ( · ) (cid:4) v − t (cid:3) ˆ r ( · ) , ˆ s ( · ) , ˆ z ( · ) (cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:11) r (cid:13) ( 15 ) for any r and any functions ˆ r ( r ) , ˆ s ( ˆ r | r , s ) , ˆ z ( ˆ r , ˆ s | r , s , z ) . Necessary for ( 15 ) is that the inequality holds for the speciﬁc functions ˆ s ( ˆ r | r , s ) = s and ˆ z ( ˆ r , ˆ s | r , s , z ) = z , i . e . , in the case where the agent always reveals the information he obtains at dates τ and 1 truthfully , E (cid:12) q ( r , s , z ) v − t ( r , s , z ) (cid:11)(cid:11) r (cid:13) (cid:2) E (cid:12) q ( ˆ r , s , z ) v − t ( ˆ r , s , z ) (cid:11)(cid:11) r (cid:13) ( 16 ) for any r and any ˆ r . Eq . ( 16 ) can be written as (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz (cid:12) q ( r , s , z ) v z ( r ) − t ( r , s , z ) (cid:13) (cid:2) (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz (cid:12) q ( ˆ r , s , z ) v z ( r ) − t ( ˆ r , s , z ) (cid:13) . ( 17 ) Deﬁne Q ( r ) ≡ (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz β z q ( r , s , z ) , S ( r ) ≡ (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz (cid:12) t ( r , s , z ) − α z q ( r , s , z ) (cid:13) and T ( r ) ≡ (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz t ( r , s , z ) . 11 Since the revelation principle applies , we can restrict attention to direct mechanisms without loss of generality . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 155 Then , using the linear structure of v z ( r ) , Eq . ( 17 ) becomes Q ( r ) r − S ( r ) (cid:2) Q ( ˆ r ) r − S ( ˆ r ) . ( 18 ) After interchanging the roles of r and ˆ r , we obtain Q ( ˆ r ) ˆ r − S ( ˆ r ) (cid:2) Q ( r ) ˆ r − S ( r ) . ( 19 ) Note that ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) together imply (cid:12) Q ( r ) − Q ( ˆ r ) (cid:13) r (cid:2) S ( r ) − S ( ˆ r ) (cid:2) (cid:12) Q ( r ) − Q ( ˆ r ) (cid:13) ˆ r ( 20 ) which can be satisﬁed only if Q ( r ) is weakly increasing . Monotonicity of Q ( r ) implies that Q ( r ) must be differentiable almost everywhere . Moreover , E [ q ( r , s , z ) v − t ( r , s , z ) | r ] = Q ( r ) r − S ( r ) is continuous for any r ∈ [ r , r ] . 12 After dividing Eq . ( 20 ) by r − ˆ r and letting ˆ r → r , we obtain for almost all r that Q (cid:10) ( r ) r − S (cid:10) ( r ) = 0 . After integrating ( and using continuity of Q ( r ) r − S ( r ) ) , we get S ( r ) = Q ( r ) r − (cid:2) rr Q ( ρ ) d ρ − [ Q ( r ) r − S ( r ) ] . Rewriting yields the following condition on the expected transfer : T ( r ) = (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz q ( r , s , z ) v z ( r ) − r (cid:18) r (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz β z q ( ξ , s , z ) d ξ − E (cid:12) q ( r , s , z ) v − t ( r , s , z ) (cid:11)(cid:11) r = r (cid:13) . ( 21 ) We thus obtain the following lemma : Lemma 7 . A necessary condition for incentive compatibility is that Eq . ( 21 ) is satisﬁed for all r ∈ [ r , r ] . We now derive an upper bound on proﬁt attained by the optimal mechanism . To this end , we consider mechanisms with allocation rule q ( r , s , z ) and transfer function t ( r , s , z ) that satisfy the necessary condition for incentive compatibility from Lemma 7 and individual rationality .

Letting w z ( r ) ≡ v z ( r ) − c − 1 − F ( r ) f ( r ) with w z ( r ) = v z ( r ) − c − φ and w z ( r ) = v z ( r ) − c − φ , we obtain an upper bound on proﬁt : Π (cid:3) r (cid:18) r (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz q ( r , s , z ) w z ( r ) f ( r ) d r (cid:3) r (cid:18) r (cid:17) ( s , z ) ∈ { l , h } × { L , H } ρ s λ sz max (cid:14) w z ( r ) , 0 (cid:15) f ( r ) d r ≡ Π .

If there exists an incentive - compatible mechanism for which q ( r , s , z ) ⎧⎨ ⎩ = 1 if w z ( r ) > 0 , ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] if w z ( r ) = 0 , = 0 if w z ( r ) < 0 ( 25 ) and E (cid:12) q ( r , s , z ) v − t ( r , s , z ) (cid:11)(cid:11) r = r (cid:13) = 0 , ( 26 ) then this mechanism maximizes the monopolist’s proﬁt . Moreover , if an incentive - compatible mechanism satisfying Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) exists , then any optimal ( proﬁt - maximizing ) mechanism must satisfy these equations ( Eq . ( 25 ) almost everywhere ) . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 157 4 . 3 . Implementing the optimal mechanism through simple pricing policies Assuming that w z ( r ) is strictly increasing in r for z ∈ { L , H } , which is implied by β z (cid:2) 0 , we now show that the upper bound on proﬁt can always be obtained by a simple pricing policy ( p 0 , p τ , p 1 ) that does not involve selling at the intermediate date τ . We distinguish three cases . Case 1 : w L ( r ) (cid:2) 0 . In this case , w z ( r ) (cid:2) 0 for all r , s , and z . Hence , the monopolist always wants to sell to all consumers . Setting the probability q ( r , s , z ) = 1 and the transfer t ( r , s , z ) = E [ q ( r , s , z ) v | r = r ] is an incentive - compatible mechanism that satisﬁes Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) . Note that the mechanism is constant , i . e . , q ( r , s , z ) and t ( r , s , z ) do not depend on r , s , and z . Advance selling at price p 0 = r implements this mechanism ( and trivially satisﬁes the neglected incentive compatibility constraints ) while other simple selling policies do not and are therefore not optimal . For instance , for spot selling to yield q ( r , s , z ) = 1 for all r , s , and z , the spot - selling price would have to be set at p 1 = v L ( r ) < r , i . e . , t ( r , s , z ) = v L ( r ) , implying that the date - 0 individual rationality constraint is slack even for the lowest type . But this violates Eq . ( 26 ) . Case 2 : w L ( r ) (cid:3) 0 . In this case , w L ( r ) (cid:3) 0 for all r and s . Hence , the monopolist never wants to sell to consumers who turn out to be in state z = L , i . e . , q ( r , s , L ) = 0 and t ( r , s , L ) = 0 for all r and s . However , the monopolist wants to sell with probability one to those consumers who turn out to be in state z = H and who are of sufﬁciently high type r (cid:2) ˜ r ≡ min { r | w H ( r ) (cid:2) 0 } , and never to consumers with r < ˜ r : q ( r , s , H ) = (cid:5) 1 if r (cid:2) ˜ r , 0 if r < ˜ r . Inserting these probabilities into Eq . ( 21 ) yields the transfer payments : t ( r , s , H ) = (cid:5) v H ( ˜ r ) if r (cid:2) ˜ r , 0 if r < ˜ r . It can easily be checked that this mechanism satisﬁes Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) . Spot selling with date - 1 price p 1 = v H ( ˜ r ) implements this mechanism ( and satisﬁes the neglected incentive compatibility constraints ) , while other simple pricing policies do not and are therefore not opti - mal . Case 3 . w L ( r ) < 0 and w L ( r ) > 0 . In this case , the monopolist wants to sell to the highest types with probability one , independently of the realization of s and z , never to the lowest types , and to intermediate types only in state z = H , independently of the realization of s : q ( r , s , L ) = (cid:5) 1 if r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , 0 if r < ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , q ( r , s , H ) = (cid:5) 1 if r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10) , 0 if r < ˜ r (cid:10) , where ˜ r (cid:10) ≡ min { r | w H ( r ) (cid:2) 0 } and ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ≡ min { r | w L ( r ) (cid:2) 0 } . Since w H ( r ) > w L ( r ) , we have ˜ r (cid:10) < ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) . Inserting these probabilities into Eq . ( 21 ) yields the transfer payments : t ( r , s , L ) = (cid:5) λ H v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) + λ L v L ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) if r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , 0 if r < ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , 158 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 t ( r , s , H ) = ⎧⎨ ⎩ λ H v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) + λ L v L ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) if r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) if ˜ r (cid:10) (cid:3) r < ˜ r (cid:10) , 0 if r < ˜ r (cid:10) . It can easily be checked that this mechanism satisﬁes Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) . An APD policy with a price path given by Lemma 2 implements this mechanism and also satisﬁes the neglected incentive compatibility constraints . Again , it is straightforward to verify that other simple pricing policies do not implement the optimal mechanism . These insights are summarized in the following proposition : Proposition 4 . Suppose that w z ( r ) is strictly increasing in r for z ∈ { L , H } . The optimal mech - anism can always be implemented by a simple pricing policy with sales at dates 0 or 1 only . Speciﬁcally , the optimal mechanism is implemented by : 1 . an advance - selling policy if w L ( r ) (cid:2) 0 , 2 . a spot - selling policy if w L ( r ) (cid:3) 0 , and 3 . an APD policy otherwise . Spot selling and advance selling emerge only as special cases of the optimal mechanism . The “normal” case is the one where an APD policy is optimal . To see this , note that w L ( r ) < 0 < w L ( r ) if the support of r is sufﬁciently large ( in that r is sufﬁciently small and r sufﬁciently large ) and β L > 0 . However , if all consumers have ( almost ) the same ex - post valuation conditional on suffering a negative shock z = L , and this valuation is less than the marginal cost c , then spot selling implements the optimal mechanism : Assuming α L < c , we have w L ( r ) < 0 for β L sufﬁciently small but positive . What is the intuition for our main result ? By Proposition 3 , any mechanism that induces a proﬁt level equal to the upper bound Π has the following two properties : it gives zero expected utility to a consumer of type r = r and is characterized by two thresholds in the type space , ˜ r (cid:10) = w − 1 H ( 0 ) and ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) = w − 1 L ( 0 ) , with ˜ r (cid:10) < ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) . If r ∈ [ ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , r ] , the consumer should always obtain the good ( condition I ) . If r ∈ [ ˜ r (cid:10) , ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) , the consumer should obtain the good only in the event z = H ( condition II ) . Whether condition I is met depends only on the consumer’s date - 0 in - formation . Whether condition II is met can be decided only after the consumer has learned his date - 1 information . The monopolist’s objective is , thus , to sell to the consumer at date 1 if con - dition II is satisﬁed , and at date 0 if condition I is satisﬁed . It is always possible to achieve this objective through a simple pricing policy : Suppose that the monopolist faces at date 1 only those consumers with r ∈ [ r , ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) because consumers with r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) already obtained the good at date 0 . Condition II is satisﬁed if and only if a consumer obtains the good when his realized valuation v z ( r ) is larger than v 1 ≡ c + ( 1 − F ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) ) / f ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) . 13 Hence , the monopolist needs to screen only the consumer’s realized valuation . This can be achieved by offering the consumer the option to buy the good at date 1 for a ﬁxed price v 1 . It follows that a consumer with r (cid:3) ˜ r (cid:10) obtains zero expected utility . It remains to be veriﬁed that consumers with r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) can be screened at date 0 . Since E [ v ( r ) | r ] = r , this amounts to screening expected date - 0 valuations . As a con - sumer with r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) has a positive option value of postponing his purchasing decision until date 1 , 13 Equilibrium requires w H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) = 0 , implying v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) = c + ( 1 − F ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) ) / f ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) . As v H ( · ) is strictly increasing , the value of an agent with z = H is larger than v 1 = v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) if r (cid:2) ˜ r (cid:10) . Moreover , since equilibrium requires w L ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) = 0 , it follows that v L ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) = c + ( 1 − F ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) ) / f ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) < c + ( 1 − F ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) ) / ˜ r (cid:10) = v 1 . As v L ( · ) is strictly increasing , we have v L ( r ) < v 1 for any r ∈ [ r , ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 159 λ H ( v H ( r ) − v 1 ) , the monopolist has to grant him a discount in order to incentivize him to buy already at date 0 . The desired screening level is obtained by offering him the option to buy at date 0 at price ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) − λ H ( v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) − v 1 ) = λ H v H ( ˜ r (cid:10) ) + λ L v L ( ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) ) . 14 We conclude this section by highlighting some properties and extensions which build upon this intuition : Remark 1 . Why can the private information z be handled as if it were public ? In the proof of Proposition 3 , we consider the case where the realization of z is public information , although we are interested in the case where it is private information to the consumer . We use this benchmark case to derive an upper bound on welfare . In Proposition 4 we then show that there exists a mechanism which attains this upper bound . In this mechanism , a consumer with z = L does not buy the good at the date - 1 price . It follows that it cannot be optimal for a consumer with z = H to mimic , at date 1 , a consumer with z = L . As a consequence , the monopolist can elicit z without having to pay an information rent to the consumer . While the monopolist’s desired allocation depends on z , the constructed sequential screening mechanism allows the monopolist to obtain the private information z at date 1 “for free” . Remark 2 . Note that the logic of the proof of Proposition 3 does not rely on the speciﬁc structure of the information at an intermediate date τ . For instance , it might be continuous or non - binary . Any kind of information at the intermediate date attains the same upper bound on welfare as derived in the proof of Proposition 3 . Moreover , if this upper bound is attainable by some mecha - nism which does not make use of this information , the corresponding mechanism must be optimal for any such information . It follows that , under the conditions of Proposition 4 , the speciﬁc struc - ture of the information at date τ does not matter for the result . Remark 3 . Why is there no trade at the intermediate date τ ? This is for the same reason why the monopolist does not want to use a stochastic mechanism in the two - period model ( without any information at an intermediate date ) . In the proof of Proposition 3 , we assume that the mo - nopolist learns the realized z for each consumer and we derive the optimal mechanism under this assumption . In the two - period model , she could construct a random variable s , correlated with z . Similarly , in the extended model with gradual resolution of uncertainty , the monopolist could use any given random variable s , correlated with z . Since she has no incentive to use the random variable s in the former case , she has no incentive to use it in the latter . Remark 4 . Do our optimality results require binary date - 1 information ? If date - 1 information is non - binary , it is typically no longer the case that the monopolist needs to screen only valuations at date 1 . By proceeding in an analogous fashion to Proposition 3 , we can derive an allocation that is optimal if it is also implementable in the case where z is private information . In contrast to the case of binary information at date 1 , with non - binary information , it may happen that , for the same value of v z ( r ) , the monopolist desires different allocations . More precisely , there may exist consumers ( r 1 , z 1 ) and ( r 2 , z 2 ) such that v z 1 ( r 1 ) = v z 2 ( r 2 ) , but where the good is optimally allocated to only one of them . 15 However , since the consumer’s utility depends on 14 If r = ˜ r (cid:10)(cid:10) , the agent just pays his ( expected ) valuation minus his option value . If r > r (cid:10)(cid:10) , he is strictly better off buying early . 15 As an example , consider the case where z has three possible realizations L , M and H . Moreover , suppose that c = 0 , r ∼ U [ 0 , 1 ] , λ L = λ M = λ H = 1 / 3 , α L = α M = α H = 0 , β L = 1 / 2 , β M = 1 and β H = 3 / 2 . Then the monopolist wants 160 V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 his information only indirectly through his valuation , he will for the same valuations undertake the same decisions ( unless he is indifferent ) . Since simple pricing policies are only capable of implementing allocations where the same valuations lead to the same decisions , they are ( in general ) not capable of implementing the reference allocation . 16 Hence , our strategy of proof does not work for the non - binary case since date - 1 information can no longer be handled as if it were public . The monopolist may want to use “more” of the date - 0 information at later dates ( for instance , through option contracts ) and she may want to use “less” date - 1 information to reduce information rents . Moreover , in the case with gradual resolution of uncertainty , trading at intermediate dates or conditioning on intermediate information may become beneﬁcial . Remark 5 . Although we assumed that there is only an individual rationality constraint at date 0 , there always exists an implementation of the optimal mechanism such that giving the consumer also an outside option of zero at dates τ and 1 does not alter the conclusion . One such implemen - tation is the optimal simple pricing policy . Remark 6 . From the fact that simple pricing policies strictly dominate stochastic mechanisms , it follows that the monopolist does not want to ration consumers by committing to a price - quantity path ( p 0 , q 0 ; p 1 , q 1 ) if such rationing is inefﬁcient ( in the sense that higher types are rationed with a probability strictly between zero and one , as in the case of proportional rationing ) . More - over , as we now argue , the monopolist does not want to ration consumers if the rationing rule is efﬁcient . To see this , suppose ﬁrst that the monopolist rations consumers at date 0 . Consider the following deviation : the monopolist slightly increases price p 0 , keeping quantity q 0 ﬁxed . Since this will leave unchanged the set of consumers that buy at either date , the deviation increases the monopolist’s date - 0 proﬁt without affecting her date - 1 proﬁt . Suppose second that the mo - nopolist rations consumers at date 1 . Consider the following deviation : The monopolist slightly increases quantity q 1 , keeping price p 1 ﬁxed . Under efﬁcient rationing , this will not affect the set of consumers that buy at date 0 ( as these are high types who would not be rationed at date 1 ) and , hence , will not affect the monopolist’s date - 0 proﬁt but increases her date - 1 proﬁt . To summarize , the optimal simple pricing policy strictly dominates any price - quantity path ( p 0 , q 0 ; p 1 , q 1 ) that induces consumer rationing , independently of the rationing rule . Remark 7 . The above analysis relies on the assumption that β z (cid:2) 0 for z ∈ { L , H } . A rather different result obtains when β L < 0 < β H . Suppose that w L ( r ) is decreasing in r . ( Indeed , if the to implement the following allocation : If r ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 4 ) , the consumer does not obtain the good ; if r ∈ [ 0 . 4 , 0 . 5 ) , he obtains the good only if z = H ; if r ∈ [ 0 . 5 , 2 / 3 ) , he obtains the good if only if z = H or z = M ; and if z ∈ [ 2 / 3 , 1 ] , he always obtains the good . Let r 1 ∈ ( 1 / 3 , 0 . 4 ) and r 2 ( r 1 ) = 3 / 2 r 1 , so that v H ( r 1 ) = v M ( r 2 ) . Although both consumers ( r 1 , H ) and ( r 2 , M ) have the same ex - post valuation , the optimal allocation is such that the good is allocated only to ( r 2 , M ) . 16 There exist some special cases where simple pricing policies are still capable of implementing the reference alloca - tion : ( i ) If we adjust the example in Footnote 15 by deﬁning β M ≡ 1 + x and β H ≡ 1 / 2 − x with x ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) , then there exists a single x - value , x = 1 / 5 , for which the monopolist needs to screen only valuations at date 1 . Hence , in this case , there exists a simple pricing policy which is capable of implementing the reference allocation . ( ii ) For speciﬁc forms of gradual information revelation , simple pricing policies with trade at more than two dates may be capable of implementing the reference allocation . As an example , consider again the case where z can assume three values , as de - scribed in Footnote 15 . If the consumer learns at an intermediate date whether z = L or z (cid:11) = L , the construction for the binary case can be “applied iteratively” . This way , a simple pricing policy is constructed where consumers buy at date 0 if r ∈ [ 2 / 3 , 1 ] and z ∈ { L , M , H } ; at date τ if r ∈ [ 0 . 5 , 2 / 3 ) and z ∈ { M , H } ; and at date 1 if r ∈ [ 0 . 4 , 0 . 5 ) and r = H . V . Nocke et al . / Journal of Economic Theory 146 ( 2011 ) 141 – 162 161 hazard rate of r is ﬁnite everywhere , then w L ( r ) is decreasing in r for β L sufﬁciently negative . ) 17 Then , an APD policy implements the optimal mechanism if and only if w L ( r ) > 0 > w L ( r ) . In contrast to the APD policy considered above , however , it will be the low types that buy the good at t = 0 and the high types that buy the good at t = 1 whenever z = H . To understand this , note that the high types face much greater uncertainty than the low types when w L ( r ) is decreasing in r . The optimal mechanism , in this case , prescribes selling to the high types only when z = H and selling to the low types independently of z . ( The same result would obtain if consumers differed only in the degree of uncertainty they face but not in their expected valuations . ) 5 . Conclusion In this paper , we have provided a novel theory of advance - purchase discounts in which advance - purchase discounts serve as a pure price discrimination device . In contrast to exist - ing explanations of advance - purchase discounts , our theory does not rely on scarce capacity or aggregate demand uncertainty . The key feature of our theory is that consumers face individual uncertainty over their future valuation for the good and this uncertainty is resolved over time . This allows a monopoly seller to charge different prices for the same product at different dates prior to consumption . Consumers with a high expected valuation will purchase the product in ad - vance at a discount , while consumers with a low expected valuation will delay their purchasing decision and buy at the regular price only when their realized valuation turns out to be high . As - suming that the distribution of shocks to consumer preferences is binary , we obtain a necessary and sufﬁcient condition under which advance - purchase discounts implement the monopolist’s optimal mechanism . This implies , in particular , that more complicated contracts such as partial refund contracts cannot lead to higher proﬁts . Our analysis has been motivated by the pricing policies for holiday packages , hotel rooms , rental car hires , and conferences . Another group of examples are tickets for the soccer world cup and other sports or cultural events . For instance , consider the ticket sale for a particular match . Consumers are willing to pay a premium in the event that their favorite team or player makes it into this match . Thus , the organizers of the tournament can use advance - purchase discounts as a price discrimination strategy ( provided secondary markets can be dried out , which may be achieved by “personalizing” tickets as in the 2006 soccer world cup ) . Relatedly , active partici - pation in a sports event ( such as a mass running event ) typically requires personal registration . Our analysis also extends to the introduction of new experience goods where consumers face uncertainty about the product’s characteristics . For our theory to be directly applicable , this un - certainty must reﬂect horizontal taste heterogeneity . In such a setting , consumers with a high expected valuation tend to buy early , while those with a lower expected valuation wait and buy only if the actual product characteristics ﬁt their taste . 18 References [ 1 ] M . Bagnoli , T . Bergstrom , Log concave probability and its applications , Econ . Theory 26 ( 2005 ) 445 – 469 . 17 Otherwise , if w L ( r ) is not monotonic in r , the optimal mechanism may not be implementable through simple pricing policies . Note that w L ( r ) is always monotonic in r if F is uniform . 18 An example is the practice by premium vineries to post subscription prices for wine ; that is , consumers are offered to buy the vintage at a discount before it is bottled . A buyer who buys such a subscription cannot rely on taste tests and recommendations since the product does not yet exist . 162 V .
