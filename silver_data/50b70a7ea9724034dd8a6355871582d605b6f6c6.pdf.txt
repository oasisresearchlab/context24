Evidence from live - cell imaging and super - resolution microscopy of 15 mammalian cells suggests an asymmetric distribution of actin fibres near the clathrin - coated pit , which 16 induces asymmetric pit - closing rather than radial constriction . However , detailed molecular mechanisms of 17 this ‘asymmetricity’ remain elusive . Herein , we used high - speed atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that 18 CIP4 , a multi - domain protein with a classic F - BAR domain and intrinsically disordered regions , is necessary 19 for asymmetric pit - closing . Strong self - assembly of CIP4 via intrinsically disordered regions , together with 20 stereospecific interactions with the curved membrane and actin - regulating proteins , generates a small actin - 21 rich environment near the pit , which deforms the membrane and closes the pit . Our results provide 22 mechanistic insights into how disordered and structured domain collaboration promotes spatio - temporal actin 23 polymerisation near the plasma membrane . 24 25 Introduction 26 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is necessary for several cellular processes , including low - density 27 lipoprotein uptake , epidermal growth factor receptor signalling transduction , synaptic vesicle formation , and 28 cell migration 1 - 3 . Clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery is highly disciplined in recruiting and 29 disassembling over 60 endocytic proteins in an ordered sequence 4 . Clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) initiation 30 requires the assembly of several adaptors and scaffold proteins , including the Fes / Cip4 homology 31 Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) domain - only protein , Eps15 , AP2 complex , and intersectin 5 - 10 . Polymerised 32 clathrin forms a hexagonal lattice that curves the plasma membrane and gradually drives CCP invagination 11 . 33 In the late CME stage , highly invaginated CCPs are detached from the membrane via dynamin - mediated 34 constriction and scission and then transported to the cytosol for further processing 12 , 13 . 35 The pit - closing step of CME has recently attracted much research attention owing to the series of 36 processes involved , including membrane deformation , fusion , and scission . In addition to a canonical 37 dynamin - dependent constriction mechanism , actin is crucial to the endocytic progression in yeast and 38 mammals 14 . In yeast cells , actin assembles symmetrically at the base of the CCP in a radial distribution and 39 constricts the membrane tubule 15 . In mammalian cells , actin functions as a force generator that counteracts 40 3 / 46 membrane tension , elongates the membrane tubules , and assists in forming deeply - invaginated vesicles 16 - 18 . 41 Furthermore , actin coordinates other endocytic proteins , such as dynamin and BAR domain proteins , to 42 promote the constriction and scission of the membrane tubules before vesicle translocation 19 - 21 . 43 Asymmetric distribution revealed via total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is an 44 interesting characteristic of the actin cytoskeleton around CCP 22 . Recent progress in super - resolution 45 techniques further revealed that many endocytic proteins possess unique localisation around the clathrin 46 lattice 23 and that actin and some associated proteins , including the neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein 47 ( N - WASP ) and actin - related proteins - 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , asymmetrically assemble near the CCP 24 . 48 Correspondingly , live - cell imaging with ion conductance microscopy revealed a membrane bulge that 49 asymmetrically formed around the CCP and gradually covered that area 25 . 50 Correlative imaging of high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) and confocal laser - scanning 51 microscopy ( CLSM ) is powerful for investigating the morphological changes of the plasma membrane during 52 endocytosis 26 . Our previous study using this technique has revealed a good correlation between the progress of 53 membrane invagination and the clathrin signal accumulation supporting the hotly debated ‘constant curvature 54 model 27 , 28 ’ . Moreover , we observed an asymmetric closing process dependent on Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin 55 polymerisation 27 . A lateral constriction is energetically more favourable for membrane fusion than a radial 56 constriction 29 . Therefore , the actin - dependent asymmetric closing mechanism seems crucial in CME ; 57 however , the detailed molecular mechanism generating the asymmetric assembly of actin machinery remains 58 elusive . 59 Herein , we studied the molecular mechanism underlying asymmetric actin assembly and the 60 consequent generation of the membrane bulge near the CCP . We used live - cell HS - AFM and fluorescence - 61 based imaging to examine the involvement of F - BAR domain - containing proteins ( CIP4 , FBP17 , and 62 Syndapin 2 ) , which carry structured domains to interact with actin regulatory proteins and long , disordered 63 domains in CME . Our results provide mechanistic insights into how a multi - domain protein can spatio - 64 temporally recruit and orchestrate the actin machinery near the CCP via phase separation of disordered 65 domains and stereospecific interactions between structured domains . 66 67 Results 68 4 / 46 Asymmetric CCP closing 69 Using HS - AFM , CME was described as a group of near - circular invaginations with diameters of 150 – 400 nm 70 and lifetimes of 40 to ~ 300 s 27 . This prior observation revealed various dynamic plasma membrane processes 71 during the CME . Three different closing patterns , namely , ‘asymmetric’ , ‘symmetric’ , and ‘undetermined’ , 72 were identified ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 1a – 1c ) . The asymmetric pattern is the dominant closing pattern 73 that corresponds to ~ 71 % of total closing events ( Fig . 1b ) , in which a membrane bulge emanates from one 74 side ( or a limited area ) of the CCP and covers the pit at the end ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 1a , 75 Supplementary Video 1 ) . The diameter of the pit plummeted within 10 – 20 s before complete closing ( Figs . 1a , 76 1c , Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . In the symmetric pattern ( ~ 18 % of total events , Fig . 1b ) , the pit slowly shrank 77 isotropically and completely closed with a weak membrane bulge ( Figs . 1a , 1c , Extended Data Fig . 1b , 78 Supplementary Video 2 ) . A small portion of the pits ( ~ 10 % of the total events , Fig . 1b ) closed within 10 – 20 s 79 but without detectable bulges ( Figs . 1a , 1c , Extended Data Fig . 1c , Supplementary Video 3 ) . Moreover , 80 scanning with a higher time resolution ( 0 . 5 frames / s ) did not reveal a membrane bulge around these pits 81 ( Extended Data Fig . 1d ) ; therefore , they were classified as ‘undetermined’ . 82 The asymmetric bulge grew faster ( increase in the membrane height per unit time ) , higher ( the 83 maximum height of the bulge ) , and continued for a longer period ( duration of the bulge ) than did the 84 symmetric bulge ( Fig . 1d ) . However , CCPs with the asymmetric or symmetric closing patterns had a similar 85 total lifetime ( Fig . 1d ) . The closing rate ( reduction in the diameter per unit time ) also differed : the asymmetric 86 pattern ( 8 . 3 ± 3 . 9 nm / s ) was faster than the symmetric one ( 3 . 9 ± 1 . 8 nm / s ) ( Fig . 1d ) , suggesting that the pit - 87 closure is accelerated more by the asymmetric bulge than the symmetric bulge . Treatment with CK666 , an 88 Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor 30 , and knockdown ( KD ) of N - WASP ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) , an upstream activator 89 of Arp2 / 3 31 , promoted the frequency of newly formed CCPs while reducing the frequency of asymmetric and 90 symmetric bulges to ~ 17 % and 0 % , respectively ( Fig . 1b , Extended Data Figs . 1f , 1g ) . This result 91 demonstrates that N - WASP - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation is required for bulge formation . 92 93 CIP4 is necessary for asymmetric bulge formation 94 We further identified the proteins that potentially mediate the asymmetric closing process . F - BAR domain - 95 containing proteins were ideal candidates to coordinate actin reorganisation with membrane deformation 96 5 / 46 during CME owing to their membrane deformation and actin - associated properties 32 , 33 . CIP4 , Syndapin 2 97 ( Synd2 , also called Pacsin2 ) , and FBP17 are classic F - BAR domain proteins localised at CCPs 22 , and Cos7 98 cells express all these proteins ( Extended Data Figs . 2a , 2b ) . The time - lapse fluorescence observations of 99 Cos7 cells expressing mCherry - fused CIP4 , Synd2 , or FBP17 with an enhanced green fluorescent protein 100 ( EGFP ) - fused clathrin light chain B ( CLTB ) revealed different timings and kinetics of their assembly at the 101 CCP ( Fig . 2a , Extended Data Fig . 3a – 3c ) . When the disappearance of the clathrin signal was set as time 0 , 102 CIP4 , Synd2 , and FBP17 appeared at the CCP at - 26 . 0 ± 7 . 4 , - 16 . 0 ± 5 . 5 , and - 10 . 5 ± 4 . 0 s and disassembled 103 at - 5 . 0 ± 2 . 3 , - 7 . 8 ± 4 . 4 , and - 2 . 0 ± 6 . 0 s , respectively ( Fig . 2b ) . CIP4 KD with two siRNA species ( one for the 104 coding region , siCIP4 _ coding ; one for the 3 ′ untranslated region , siCIP4 _ 3 ′ UTR ) in Cos7 cells reduced the 105 frequency of the asymmetric bulges ( from ~ 74 % to < 30 % ) and increased the undetermined pattern ( ~ 70 % ) 106 ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Fig . 2c – 2e ) . Moreover , overexpression of EGFP - fused CIP4 in CIP4 - KD 107 ( siCIP4 _ 3 ′ UTR ) cells rescued the asymmetric bulge ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Fig . 2d ) . By contrast , Synd2 or 108 FBP17 KD did not markedly affect any closing patterns ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Figs . 2c , 2d ) . Nevertheless , 109 the overall frequency of CME was unaffected ( Extended Data Fig . 2f ) . These results demonstrate that CIP4 , 110 but not FBP17 or Synd2 , is necessary for the asymmetric bulge . 111 Correlative imaging of HS - AFM and CLSM revealed a clear correlation between the assembly of 112 CIP4 and the bulge formation . When the disappearance of the clathrin signal was set as time 0 , CIP4 was 113 observed at - 33 . 9 ± 6 . 50 s under CLSM , and the membrane bulge formed at - 30 . 0 ± 8 . 16 s under the HS - AFM 114 ( Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 2g ) , indicating a strong association between CIP4 and bulge formation . 115 The relative position of CIP4 and the clathrin signal was determined using time - lapse super - 116 resolution structural illumination microscopy ( SIM ) to confirm the asymmetric localisation of CIP4 . The CIP4 117 signal started to appear at the determined position offset from clathrin , with a centre - to - centre distance within 118 the first 5 s of 126 . 8 ± 66 . 6 nm ( N = 160 ) ( Figs . 2e , 2f , Extended Data Fig . 2h ) . As the CIP4 signal increased , 119 the centre - to - centre distance fluctuated with a decreasing tendency until both signals disappeared ( Fig . 2e , 120 Extended Data Fig . 2h ) . Thus , we concluded that CIP4 was asymmetrically assembled at the CME site . 121 122 Flanking disordered region is vital for CIP4 assembly in CCP 123 6 / 46 The CIP4 domain required for self - assembly around CCP was subsequently determined . CIP4 and FBP17 124 belong to the same subfamily of F - BAR proteins and have conserved F - BAR and SH3 domains at the amino - 125 and carboxyl - termini , respectively ( Extended Data Figs . 3d , 3e ) . The middle region between these conserved 126 domains is less conserved and mostly disordered without any known binding motifs for other endocytic 127 proteins ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Figs . 3d , 3e ) . In CIP4 and FBP17 , but not Synd2 , the middle - disordered 128 region is intervened by a conserved G protein - binding homology region 1 ( HR1 ) ; therefore , it is named the 129 flanking disordered region ( FDR ; Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . 130 The CIP4 assembly at the CCP was unaffected by SH3 domain deletion ( CIP4 ( ∆ SH3 ) ; Fig . 3a – 3c , 131 Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . BAR domain and the FDR were insufficient for CIP4 assembly ( Fig . 3b ) , indicating 132 that the F - BAR domain and FDR are necessary for CIP4 to assemble at the CCP . Notably , the assembly of 133 chimeric molecules carrying the Synd2 - BAR and CIP4 - FDR ( SCC and SC chimaeras in Fig . 3a ) to the CCP 134 starts at a time point similar to that of full - length CIP4 ( Figs . 3b , 3c , Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . By contrast , the 135 CS mutant , which carries the CIP4 - BAR and Synd2 - IDR ( Fig . 3a ) , did not assemble at the CCP ( Fig . 3b ) . 136 Therefore , these results demonstrate that the FDR of CIP4 is a major determinant of the self - assembly at the 137 CCP . However , the BAR domain is also necessary . 138 139 SH3 domain is required for membrane bulge formation 140 In contrast to the assembly at the CCP , the SH3 domain was required to form the membrane bulge . The SC 141 chimaera expression , which could assemble at the CCP ( Fig . 3b ) , failed to rescue the CIP4 - KD phenotype ; the 142 frequency of the asymmetric membrane bulge was not recovered by the SC mutant expression ( Fig . 3d ) . By 143 contrast , the SCC chimaera , which also carries the SH3 domain of CIP4 , could rescue the KD phenotype ( Fig . 144 3d ) , indicating that the SH3 domain was necessary for forming the membrane bulge after the assembly at the 145 CCP . 146 CIP4 binds and activates N - WASP via the SH3 domain 34 . The activated N - WASP interacts with 147 Cdc42 through its GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) ( Extended Data Figs . 4b , 4c ) and recruits the Arp2 / 3 148 complex to promote actin polymerisation 35 . In our experimental system , the assembly of N - WASP at the CCP 149 was also observed ; it appeared at the CCP immediately after CIP4 ( Extended Data Figs . 4d , 4e ) . Therefore , we 150 examined whether the interaction between CIP4 and N - WASP is necessary for the asymmetric bulge . A point 151 7 / 46 mutation in the SH3 domain of Toca1 ( W518K ) inhibited the interaction with N - WASP 36 . Mutating the 152 corresponding residue in the CIP4 - SH3 domain ( W524K ) also reduced the interaction with N - WASP ( Fig . 3e , 153 Extended Data Fig . 4f ) . In agreement with this finding , the SCC chimaera carrying the W524K mutation 154 failed to rescue the CIP4 - KD phenotype ( Fig . 3d ) , indicating that the interaction with CIP4 - SH3 and N - WASP 155 is necessary for forming the asymmetric bulge . 156 157 Cdc42 recruits CIP4 to the CCP site 158 Next , we examined FDR’s involvement in the asymmetric assembly of CIP4 at the CCP . We first focused on 159 the interaction with Cdc42 36 . A pull - down assay demonstrated that the CIP4 - FDR had a higher affinity to the 160 active ( GTPγS - loaded ) form of Cdc42 than to the FBP17 - FDR and the IDR of Synd2 ( Fig . 4a , Extended Data 161 Fig . 5a ) . Substitutions of three amino acids within HR1 ( MGD to IST , Extended Data Fig . 5b ) , which abolish 162 the interaction with Cdc42 in Toca1 - HR1 35 , also attenuated the interaction with Cdc42 ( Fig . 4a , Extended 163 Data Fig . 5a ) . The assembly of full - length CIP4 carrying the MGD - IST mutation at the CCP started at - 12 . 5 ± 164 5 . 2 s ( Figs . 4b , 4c , Extended Data Fig . 5c ) , which was delayed compared to that of the wild - type ( WT ) , 165 indicating that the activated Cdc42 is required for CIP4 assembly at the CCP . 166 The interaction with active Cdc42 was important for CIP4 assembly at the CCP and asymmetric 167 bulge formation . The overexpression of a dominant - negative form of Cdc42 ( T17N ) , but not the WT , severely 168 impaired the asymmetric bulge ( to ~ 25 % ) compared to that of the non - transfected cells ( Fig . 4d ) . In addition , 169 the SCC chimaera carrying the MGD - IST mutation failed to rescue the CIP4 - KD phenotype ( Fig . 4d ) . These 170 results indicated that activated Cdc42 recruits CIP4 to the CCP site , which further induces asymmetric bulge 171 formation . 172 173 FDR self - assembly generates ‘asymmetric’ CIP4 distribution 174 The interaction between Cdc42 and CIP4 is crucial in CIP4 assembly at the CCP ; however , it does not explain 175 how ‘asymmetricity’ is produced . A possible mechanism could be the cooperativity of the assembly . The 176 structural prediction based on the amino acid sequence suggested that the HR1 of CIP4 forms a helical coil 177 composed of two antiparallel α - helices ( Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . To examine the secondary structure of CIP4 - 178 HR1 , we measured the circular dichroism spectrum of recombinant HR1 , which fitted well with that of the 179 8 / 46 reference curve of α - helix ( Extended Data Fig . 6b ) , demonstrating a strong propensity of α - helix in HR1 . 180 Therefore , we speculated that it forms a multimer and the association proceeds cooperatively . To test this 181 hypothesis , purified HR1 was subjected to gel - filtration chromatography to estimate the molecular size . We 182 observed that HR1 existed mainly as a dimer , and any multimers could not be detected under a physiological 183 condition ( Extended Data Figs . 6c , 6d ) . A similar result was obtained by treating purified HR1 with 184 bis ( sulfosuccinimidyl ) suberate ( BS 3 ) crosslinkers and analysing using SDS - PAGE . Adding crosslinkers 185 induced an extra band corresponding to the HR1 dimer , but not higher - order multimers ( Extended Data Fig . 186 6e ) . Thus , these results demonstrate that HR1 multimerisation is not the major driving force of asymmetricity . 187 Another possibility could be the self - assembly and phase transition of FDR via electrostatic 188 interaction between IDRs . The HR1 domain of CIP4 and FBP17 is flanked by positively and negatively 189 charged IDRs at the amino and carboxyl sides , respectively ( Fig . 5a , Extended Data Fig . 6f ) . By contrast , the 190 charge segregation of Synd2 IDR is not so prominent ( Extended Data Fig . 6f ) . It has been well - established 191 that a polymer with segregated charges ( i . e . , block polyampholyte ) exhibits stronger liquid – liquid phase 192 separation ( LLPS ) than the chain with the same number of charges randomly distributed ( i . e . , random 193 polyampholyte ) 37 , 38 , and the pattern of charge blocks is an important determinant of LLPS properties 39 . These 194 properties strongly suggest that the FDR self - assembles to undergo LLPS via charge - block interaction among 195 IDRs ( Fig . 5a ) . To test this possibility , the purified recombinant protein was subjected to an in vitro droplet 196 assay in the presence of polyethene glycol as a crowder . CIP4 - FDR formed protein droplets , unlike the IDR of 197 Synd2 ( Fig . 5b ) . Quantification of protein droplets based on the turbidity revealed that the saturation 198 concentration of CIP4 - FDR was similar to that of the FBP17 - FDR but remarkably lower than that of the 199 Synd2 - IDR ( Figs . 5b , 5c ) , indicating that CIP4 - FDR and FBP17 - FDR has a stronger propensity for LLPS than 200 Synd2 - IDR . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis revealed that the protein droplet 201 was in a liquid - like state ( Fig . 5d ) . Deletion of either IDR ( ΔIDR1 or ΔIDR2 ) from CIP4 - FDR severely 202 attenuated the LLPS ( Figs . 5c , 5e ) , demonstrating that the interaction between charge blocks is essential in the 203 LLPS of FDR . 204 Deleting one of the IDRs of CIP4 - FDR did not completely abolish LLPS ( Fig . 5e ) . Therefore , we 205 speculated that HR1 also contributes to LLPS . HR1 deletion from FDR ( ΔHR1 ) partly , but significantly , 206 reduced the LLPS propensity ( Figs . 5c , 5e ) . To substantiate this idea , intensive mutations were introduced into 207 9 / 46 HR1 to reduce dimer formation . We observed that substitutions of four hydrophobic residues ( L347 , L401 , 208 Y408 , and W411 labelled in Extended Data Fig . 6a ) by serine ( 4S ) disrupted the HR1 - dimer without affecting 209 the interaction with Cdc42 ( Fig . 4a , Extended Data Figs . 5a , 6c ) . As expected , the LLPS propensity of the 210 CIP4 - FDR ( 4S ) mutant was lower than that of the WT ( Figs . 5c , 5e ) , indicating that HR1 dimerisation 211 promotes the FDR - dependent assembly of CIP4 . To test whether FDR - driven LLPS is essential in CIP4 212 assembly at the CCP , we analysed the assembly rate of CIP4 through live - cell fluorescence imaging . SH3 213 deletion ( CIP4 ( ∆ SH3 ) ) did not affect the assembly rate of CIP4 at CCP ( Fig . 5f ) . Interestingly , further 214 deletion of IDR2 ( ∆ IDR2 / SH3 ) , which reduces the LLPS propensity of CIP4 - FDR ( Figs . 5c , 5e ) , reduced the 215 assembly rate by ~ 70 % ( Fig . 5f , Extended Data Fig . 6g ) , implicating the role of phase separation in driving 216 CIP4 assembly at CCP . Similarly , the 4S mutation in the full - length CIP4 almost completely abolished the 217 assembly ( Extended Data Fig . 6h ) , which was more severe than the IDR2 deletion . In agreement with this 218 finding , the SCC chimaera carrying the 4S mutation did not rescue the CIP4 - KD ( Extended Data Fig . 6i ) . 219 These observations indicated that the FDR - dependent LLPS is critical in CIP4 assembly at the CCP . 220 As we demonstrated , CIP4 assembly is closely associated with Cdc42 and N - WASP . We then 221 investigated whether these two regulators or effectors potentially affected the LLPS propensity of CIP4 . 222 Cdc42 ( WT and constitutively active form Q61L ) did not undergo LLPS or enhance CIP4 - FDR LLPS ( Figs . 223 5c , 5g ) . These results demonstrate that the Cdc42 - CIP4 interaction does not contribute to the LLPS of CIP4 . 224 However , N - WASP exhibited strong LLPS ( C sat : ~ 10 μM ) ( Fig . 5c ) . Therefore , we examined whether N - 225 WASP and CIP4 co - exist in the same droplet or exclude each other . N - WASP and full - length CIP4 co - existed 226 in the same droplet ( Fig . 5h ) . The same result was obtained with CIP4 - FDR and N - WASP ( Figs . 5g , 5h ) . 227 These results indicate that both proteins have a strong propensity for LLPS and tend to co - exist in the same 228 droplet . 229 230 Actin amasses and polymerises in a liquid phase of CIP4 - FDR 231 We examined whether a liquid phase formed by CIP4 - FDR could accelerate actin polymerisation . Alexa488 - 232 labelled CIP4 - FDR was mixed with polyethene glycol to induce LLPS , and then rhodamine - labelled G - actin 233 was added ( Fig . 5i ) . The time - lapse observation under a fluorescence microscope revealed that actin rapidly 234 10 / 46 moved into the droplet ( Fig . 5i ) . The concentration of actin was ~ 100 times higher in the droplet than in the 235 external medium , demonstrating that actin accumulated in the CIP4 - FDR droplet . 236 We then tested whether actin polymerisation also occurs in the droplet . ATP and Mg 2 + and a low 237 concentration of G - actin ( 45 μg / mL ) were added to the droplet solution of CIP4 - FDR to induce actin 238 polymerisation in the droplet ( Figs . 5i , 5j ) . Under this condition , actin polymerisation rarely occurred in the 239 diluted phase , owing to the low actin concentration . However , fibrous actin was frequently observed in the 240 droplet ( Fig . 5j ) . ATP depletion almost completely abolished it ( Fig . 5j ) , demonstrating that actin 241 polymerisation occurs in the droplet . Thus , these results demonstrate that CIP4 self - assembles via FDR to 242 form a liquid - like phase and concentrates G - actin in the liquid phase to accelerate the polymerisation . 243 244 Discussion 245 Herein , we used various live - cell imaging techniques and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that the 246 BAR domain - containing protein CIP4 is critical in the actin - dependent asymmetric closing process of CME . 247 CIP4 interacts with curved membrane and actin - related proteins such as Cdc42 and N - WASP through its 248 distinct structured domains ( i . e . , BAR , HR1 , and SH3 ) . Our results demonstrated that the asymmetricity was 249 generated during the self - assembly of the disordered regions between those structured domains . This describes 250 an intriguing molecular mechanism of how a multi - domain protein , such as CIP4 , spatio - temporally recruits 251 and orchestrates the actin machinery at a specific cell position . Strong self - assembly , phase separation of 252 IDRs , and stereospecific interactions between structured domains induce a local burst of branched actin fibres 253 nearby the CCP . It has been proposed that unstructured amino acid chains sense the curved lipid bilayer via 254 entropic or electrostatic mechanisms , determined by their length and net charge 40 . Recently , the IDRs of 255 membrane - bound , - anchored , and - embedded proteins , including AP180 , Amphiphysin 1 , FBP17 , CALM , and 256 Epsin , are gaining more research attention for supporting or enhancing the membrane - bending or curvature - 257 sensing properties of the structured domains 41 - 45 . Therefore , our findings provide a novel perspective for 258 understanding the role of disordered proteins in CME progression . 259 Four members of F - BAR domain - containing proteins are CIP4 , FBP17 , Synd2 , and Toca1 . CIP4 , 260 FBP - 17 , and Synd2 assemble at the CCP at different times during CME ( Fig . 2b ) and have different cellular 261 functions 32 , 46 despite their similar domain structures . This could partly be attributed to the slightly different 262 11 / 46 curvature of the three - dimensional structures of the BAR domains 46 . Herein , we demonstrated that the middle - 263 disordered regions between the BAR and SH3 domains had different self - assembly properties . The FDRs of 264 CIP4 and FBP17 , but not the IDR of Synd2 , had high LLPS propensity , and both disordered regions were 265 required for CIP4 phase separation ( Figs . 5c , 5e ) . However , when either of the disordered regions was deleted 266 ( ΔIDR1 or ΔIDR2 ) , a certain level of LLPS propensit y was preserved ( Fig . 5e ) , suggesting that HR1 267 dimerisation may also promote the LLPS of FDR . These results clearly explain the functional diversity among 268 Synd2 , CIP4 , and FBP17 in CME and possibly other cellular processes in which they are involved . 269 In contrast to Synd2 , the FBP17 - FDR has a similar charge distribution pattern to that of CIP4 270 ( Extended Data Fig . 6f ) and exhibits a similar phase behaviour in vitro ( Figs . 5b , 5c ) ; however , they greatly 271 diverge regarding their functions and localisations . During CME , CIP4 assembles at the CCP before complete 272 pit - closure ( Fig . 2d ) , which is remarkably earlier than that of FBP17 ( Fig . 2b ) . Moreover , an in vitro pull - 273 down assay revealed that CIP4 - FDR had a higher ability to bind to Cdc42 than does the FDR of FBP17 ( Fig . 274 4a , Extended Data Fig . 5a ) ; this implies that disordered regions have a role in Cdc42 interactions . In dendritic 275 neurons , FBP17 displayed an intracellular distribution different from that of CIP4 due to its poly PxxP region 276 within the first IDR 47 . These observations implicate the underestimated role of disordered regions in 277 regulating nearby stereospecific interactions . 278 CIP4 strongly self - assembled and underwent LLPS in vitro ( Fig . 5b ) ; nonetheless , the intracellular 279 concentration of endogenous CIP4 , estimated from the total intracellular amount ( ~ 20 nM , Extended Data Fig . 280 6j ) , was far lower than the saturation concentration ( ~ 6 µ M , Fig . 5c ) . These results suggested that in addition 281 to the charge block - driven LLPS of FDR , a certain mechanism which assembles CIP4 near the CCP for 282 ‘nucleation’ is required to initiate LLPS . One important factor in this nucleation can be stereospecific 283 interactions involving the structured domains ( F - BAR , HR1 , and SH3 ) . 284 In the absence of the CCP , CIP4 binds to active Cdc42 anchored to the plasma membrane via PIP 2 285 through the HR1 domain ( Fig . 6a ) . CIP4 also binds to N - WASP via the SH3 domain , allowing the interaction 286 between N - WASP and Cdc42 , and ternary complexes form among CIP4 , N - WASP , and Cdc42 ( Fig . 6b ) . 287 However , at this stage , the local concentration of CIP4 may not be sufficient to initiate LLPS ( Fig . 6b ) . When 288 the ternary complex occasionally approaches the CCP , the BAR domain recognises the curvature of the pit 289 membrane and binds to it ( Fig . 6c ) . The BAR domain multimerises on the membrane 48 ; therefore , it 290 12 / 46 accelerates CIP4 assembly near the CCP . In good agreement with this finding , the LLPS propensity of full - 291 length CIP4 is higher than that of FDR ( Fig . 5c ) , suggesting the involvement of the BAR domain in LLPS 292 progression . 293 Recent studies reported ‘membrane - supported’ LLPS at the plasma membrane and other intracellular 294 membrane organelles 49 , 50 , where membrane - anchored or - inserted proteins assemble on the membrane and 295 ‘nucleate’ for LLPS . This two - dimensional system can considerably accelerate LLPS compared to a dispersed 296 system and initiate LLPS regardless of the bulk ( cytoplasmic ) protein concentration being below the 297 threshold . We speculate that these stereospecific interactions ( Cdc42 - HR1 , F - BAR - F - BAR , and F - BAR - 298 membrane ) contribute to CIP4 nucleation near the CCP . 299 Once CIP4 nucleates near the CCP , it undergoes ‘charge block - driven LLPS’ via FDR and 300 condenses—a major driving force of ‘asymmetric’ CIP4 assembly ( Fig . 6d ) . The F - BAR domain multimerises 301 and forms a helical structure around the tubulated membrane in vitro 48 , 51 . However , it is insufficient for the 302 assembly at the CCP , as we have demonstrated in this study ( Fig . 3b ) . Furthermore , it does not provide a 303 structural basis for the ‘asymmetric’ distribution at the CCP . Instead , we speculate that LLPS is key to 304 forming the ‘asymmetric’ assembly of CIP4 because the emergence of a condensed phase proceeds in a non - 305 continuous manner when the local protein concentration is above the threshold . Therefore , F - BAR - and HR1 - 306 driven nucleation and FDR - driven LLPS synergistically work for the fast assembly of CIP4 at the CCP . This 307 finding is consistent with the results of a previous study demonstrating that disordered domains enhance the 308 affinity of BAR domains to the curved membrane 41 . 309 Our chimeric molecule between CIP4 and Synd2 demonstrated that the BAR domain was functionally 310 exchangeable ( SCC chimaera , Fig . 3a – 3c , Extended Data Fig . 4a ) , implying that the curvature - sensing by the 311 BAR domain is not critical during this step of the CME and IDR is more important . The SH3 domain was 312 unnecessary for CIP4 assembly ( Fig . 3a – 3c , Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . However , it is necessary to recruit N - 313 WASP and subsequently form the asymmetric bulge . 314 A CIP4 - rich condensate near the CCP is then supposed to recruit other related proteins into the 315 condensate ( Fig . 6d ) . Compared to HR1 , GBD of N - WASP has a higher affinity to Cdc42 and will completely 316 displace the HR1 to interact with Cdc42 , which further exposes the C - terminal acidic region , allowing the 317 further recruitment and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex 52 . We demonstrated that N - WASP also had a high 318 13 / 46 LLPS propensity and co - existed with CIP4 in the same droplet in vitro ( Figs . 5c , 5h ) , suggesting that the CIP4 319 condensate recruits and accommodates N - WASP . Consequently , the local concentration of the active Arp2 / 3 320 complex also increases , which accelerates actin polymerisation ( Figs . 6d , 6e ) . A similar process had been 321 demonstrated using Toca1 , a subfamily member of CIP4 with conserved HR1 and SH3 domains 36 , 52 , 322 suggesting a conserved role of CIP4 subfamily proteins in mediating Cdc42 - WASP - Arp2 / 3 actin signalling . 323 Moreover , recent studies revealed that actin - associated proteins with a long IDR , such as vasodilator - 324 stimulated phosphoprotein and actin - binding LIM protein 1 , formed liquid droplets under physiological 325 conditions and promoted actin polymerisation and bundling 53 , 54 . Our in vitro assay demonstrated that G - actin 326 preferred to localise in the condensed phase of CIP4 - FDR ( Fig . 5i ) , implying that the concentration of free G - 327 actin increases in the CIP4 - rich phase near the CCP , which also promotes actin polymerisation . 328 We speculate that ‘branched actin’ , not the CIP4 condensate , generates the mechanical force to 329 deform the plasma membrane . CK666 inhibited actin polymerisation , which consequently inhibited the 330 membrane protrusion ( Fig . 1b , Extended Data Fig . 1f ) , indicating that the major driving force of the 331 protrusion is Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation . Electron microscopic observations revealed that branched 332 actin fibres near the CCP are highly anisotropic 17 . However , Arp2 / 3 produces branched fibres with a fixed 333 angle ( ~ 70° ) . This finding suggests that actin fibres expand in a radial orientation and push the nearby 334 membrane , resulting in membrane bulge ( upward ) and fusion ( lateral ) ( Fig . 6e ) . It may also generate a 335 downward force to push the CCP toward the cell interior , as suggested by another group 55 . Further studies are 336 required to elucidate this mechanism . 337 The BAR / F - BAR scaffolds interplay with dynamin during the membrane scission process 56 . One 338 classic example is the opposite role of Sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) and Amphiphysin in regulating the activity of 339 dynamin at the late stage of endocytosis . SNX9 recruits dynamin and promotes the assembly - stimulated 340 GTPase activity of dynamin by stabilising the dynamin - membrane interaction 57 , 58 ( Fig . 6f ) . By contrast , 341 Amphiphysin is recruited by dynamin and inhibits the dynamin ring formation by destabilising the dynamin - 342 membrane interaction 59 , 60 ( Fig . 6f ) . Current evidence is not yet sufficient to illustrate the functional interplay 343 between CIP4 or CIP4 - mediated actin polymerisation and dynamin . Nevertheless , we have observed that 344 dynamin depletion 27 and actin inhibition did not completely abolish CME progression ( Fig . 1b , Extended Data 345 Fig . 1f ) , suggesting that actin - and dynamin - driven pit - closing may function as relatively independent 346 14 / 46 mechanisms and either could be dominant depending on free actin abundance ( Fig . 6f ) . However , membrane 347 tabulation induced by the F - BAR domain could be antagonised by dynamin - and membrane - associated actin 348 cytoskeleton 61 . Moreover , each dynamin helix can capture 12 – 16 actin filaments and align them into 349 bundles 62 . Therefore , it is also reasonable to propose that dynamin may further potentiate the CIP4 - induced 350 actin cytoskeleton reorganisation , which promotes dynamin - dependent scission processes such as the super 351 twist of the dynamin helix 63 . However , these speculations should be further studied . 352 353 Methods 354 Plasmids 355 Mammalian expression vectors encoding pEGFP - N1 - CLTB and pmCherry - C1 - CLTB were constructed as 356 described previously 27 .

Similarly , the SCC chimaera fragment was obtained by amplifying 366 and ligating the nucleotide sequence corresponding to Synd2 ( a . a . 1 – 275 ) and CIP4 ( a . a . 258 – 547 ) . The DNA 367 fragments corresponding to CIP4 - SH3 ( a . a . 490 – 547 ) and Synd2 - SH3 ( a . a . 429 – 486 ) were deleted from the 368 SCC or CSS fragments , respectively , using PrimerSTAR ® Max DNA Polymerase ( Takara Bio Inc . , Shiga , 369 Japan ) to obtain the fragments of SC and CS chimaera . CIP4 - FDR ( ∆ HR1 ) fragment was obtained by deleting 370 the nucleotide sequence corresponding to CIP4 - HR1 ( a . a . 339 – 425 ) using PrimerSTAR ® Max DNA 371 Polymerase . 372 15 / 46 Single and multiple amino acid mutations were introduced using PrimerSTAR ® Max DNA Polymerase .

Vectors encoding the recombinant proteins were constructed 386 as described in the previous section and introduced into the BL21 - CondonPlus ( DE3 ) - RIL competent cells 387 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) via heat shock at 37 °C for 30 s . The expression of the 388 recombinant protein was induced using 0 . 5 mM isopropylthio - β - D - galactoside at 16 °C for 16 h . Bacterial 389 cells expressing hexa - histidine - tagged or GST - tagged recombinant proteins were harvested and resuspended 390 with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 ; 391 pH 7 . 4 ) containing lysozyme ( 0 . 2 mg / mL ) , DNaseI ( 20 µ g / mL ) , MgCl 2 ( 1 mM ) , and 392 phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride ( 1 mM ) . The cells were subjected to freeze – thaw cycles thrice and 393 homogenised via sonication . Insoluble cell debris was removed via centrifugation at 13 , 000 g , 4 °C for 15 394 min . The cleared lysate was then mixed with nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) - agarose beads ( QIAGEN , 395 Hilden , Germany ) or glutathione ( GSH ) Sepharose 4B beads ( Cytiva , Marlborough , MA , USA ) , and 396 incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation to collect tagged proteins . The Hexa - histidine - and GST - tagged 397 proteins were eluted with Elution buffer A ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM DTT , and 400 mM 398 Imidazole ; pH 7 . 4 ) and Elution buffer B ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM DTT , and 200 mM GSH ; 399 16 / 46 pH 7 . 4 ) , respectively , and dialysed against a buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) at 400 4 °C for 6 h . Proteins were concentrated using AmiconUltra ( M . W . 3 , 000 Da ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , 401 USA ) and stored at - 80 °C before use . 402 403 Pull - down assay 404 The recombinant proteins ( ~ 5 µ g ) were immobilised on ~ 20 µL of Ni - NTA agarose or GSH Sepharose 4B 405 beads . EGFP - fused Cdc42 and EGFP - fused N - WASP were expressed in HEK293T cells . The cell pellet was 406 resuspended with PBS containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( 0 . 5 % , Nacalai Tesque , Inc . , Kyoto , Japan ) and 407 Triton - X - 100 ( 0 . 25 % ) on ice for 10 min . The cell lysate containing EGFP - Cdc42 ( WT or T17N ) was 408 incubated with GTP γ - S or GDP as described previously to activate Cdc42 65 . The cell lysate was mixed with 409 the purified recombinant protein and Ni - NTA or GSH beads and incubated at 4 °C for 25 min , and the bound 410 fraction was eluted with 400 mM imidazole or 100 mM GSH in Elution Buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM 411 HEPES , 0 . 2 mM DTT ; pH 7 . 4 ) , respectively . Approximately 20 % of the bound and 10 % of the unbound 412 fraction were analysed using immunoblotting and SDS - PAGE , respectively . 413 414 Cell culture and transfection 415 Monkey kidney - derived fibroblast - like cells ( Cos7 cells ) purchased from the Cell Engineering Division in 416 RIKEN BioResource Center ( RBC0539 ; Ibaraki , Japan ) were cultured in high - glucose Dulbecco’s modified 417 Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fo etal bovine serum at 37 ℃ with 5 % CO 2 . For HS - AFM 418 observation , slide glasses ( Matsunami Glass Ind . , Ltd . , Osaka , Japan ) or 0 . 15 CG pierced slide glass ( ToA 419 Optical Technologies , Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) were coated with 0 . 01 % poly - L - lysine solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 420 and incubated at 37 ℃ for 1 h . Cos7 cells were seeded on the glass , incubated overnight , and subjected to HS - 421 AFM observation the next day . CK666 ( Abcam , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) was added to the culture 422 medium to a final concentration of 100 µM 30 min before the observation . Polyethyleneimine ( M . W . 40 , 000 , 423 Polyscience , Niles , IL , USA ) was used to introduce the expression vectors into Cos7 cells . 424 425 RNA interference 426 17 / 46 Cos7 cells were transfected with siRNA using the HiPerfect reagent ( QIAGEN ) according to the 427 manufacturer’s protocol . siRNA against CIP4 ( ID : s17814 , 5ʹ - GGAGAAUAGUAAGCGUAAATT - 3ʹ ) , 428 FBP17 ( ID : s22916 , 5ʹ - CAACCUAAAAAGAACUCGATT - 3ʹ ) , or Synd2 ( ID : s22216 , 5ʹ - 429 AGAUGUUCUUAAGACCAAATT - 3ʹ ) were purchased from Ambion Inc . ( Austin , TX , USA ) . siRNA 430 targeting the 3 ′ UTR sequence of CIP4 was customised at Thermo Fisher Scientific ( Waltham , MA , USA ) . 431 siRNA against N - WASP ( siGENOME SMART pool ) was purchased from Dharmacon Inc . ( Lafayette , CO , 432 USA ) . The cells were treated with trypsin 48 h after the transfection and seeded on slide glasses for HS - AFM 433 observation or directly harvested and analysed using SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting . The rescue 434 experiment was performed by transfecting Cos7 cells with siRNA against CIP4 48 h before the observation 435 and transfecting the cells with vectors encoding mCherry - tagged SC chimaera 24 h before the observation . 436 437 HS - AFM imaging and image analyses 438 A tip - scan type HS - AFM system ( BIXAM TM ; Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) combined with a confocal 439 microscope ( FV1200 , Olympus Corporation ) 27 , 66 , 67 was used for AFM imaging . The HS - AFM system uses a 440 tapping mode with a phase feed - back control . An electron beam - deposited ultra - short cantilever ( USC - F0 . 8 - 441 K0 . 1 - T12 - x66 - 10 ; Nonoworld Corporation , Neuchâtel , Switzerland ) with a spring constant of 0 . 1 N m - 1 was 442 used for scanning . We performed all imaging using a cantilever amplitude of 85 – 92 % of its free amplitude . 443 Images were acquired every 2 s to analyse the detailed morphological characteristics of the undetermined 444 closing pattern . Images were acquired every 10 s owning to the mutual compensation between scanning speed 445 and scanning area to observe clathrin pits generally . When images were acquired every 10 s , the total scanning 446 area was 6000 × 4500 nm 2 and was displayed in 320 pixels × 240 pixels images . All observations were 447 performed at 28 ℃ . The correlative imaging of HS - AFM and confocal microscopy was performed as 448 described previously 22 . 449 Time - lapse HS - AFM images were acquired using AFM Scanning System Software Version 1 . 6 . 0 . 12 450 ( Olympus Corporation ) . The diameter , duration , and height of the membrane bulge were analysed using the 451 Gwyddion software ( ver 2 . 55 ; http : / / gwyddion . net / ) and GIMP software ( ver 2 . 10 . 18 ; https : / / www . gimp . org / ) . 452 The highest point of the plasma membrane at the CCP area was recorded and compared with the surrounding 453 plasma membrane to record the height of the membrane bulge . The lowest position in the HS - AFM image was 454 18 / 46 set as ‘0’ automatically . The duration of the membrane bulge was counted from the first image with the visible 455 membrane bulge to its complete disappearance . Regarding the pit’s size , its maximum diameter during the 456 entire CME process was measured by first doing a cross - section and measuring the distance between one side 457 of the pit and the other . Concerning cases with no detectable membrane bulge ( undetermined pattern ) , the 458 height and duration were set as ‘0 µm’ and ‘0 s’ , respectively . By plotting the change of membrane height at 459 the pit area and pit diameter against time , the slope of the ascending part of the height - time plot was used to 460 obtain the growth rate of the membrane bulge . By contrast , the slope of the descending part of the diameter - 461 time plot was used to obtain the closing rate of CCPs . 462 463 Immunoblotting 464 The total cell lysate from Cos7 cells expressing EGFP - fused CIP4 , FBP17 , or Synd2 and from Cos7 cells 465 subjected to single KD of CIP4 , FBP17 , or Synd2 was separated using 12 % SDS - PAGE gel , transferred to a 466 polyvinylidene difluoride membrane , blocked in 5 % skimmed milk in tris buffered saline ( 5 mM Tris , 13 . 8 467 mM NaCl , 0 . 27 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) containing 0 . 1 % Tween ( Nacalai Tesque , Inc . ) , and incubated with a 468 primary antibody for 1 h . The following antibodies were used : rabbit anti - CIP4 ( 1 : 1000 ; Bethyl Laboratories 469 Inc . , Montgomery , TX , USA ) , rabbit anti - pacsin2 ( 1 : 1000 ; Novus Biologicals LLC , Centennial , CO , USA ) , 470 rabbit anti - FNBP1 ( 1 : 1000 ; Novus Biologicals LLC ) , rabbit anti - N - WASP ( 1 : 1000 ; Cell Signaling 471 Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , rabbit anti - GFP ( 1 : 1000 ; Medical & Biological Laboratories Co . , Ltd . , 472 Nagano , Japan ) , and mouse anti - β - actin ( 1 : 1000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . The blot was then incubated with a 473 secondary antibody : goat anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) antibody ( 1 : 5000 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or Goat anti - 474 mouse IgG ( H + L ) antibody ( 1 : 5000 ; Cytiva ) at 27 °C for 1 h . The immunoreactive bands were visualised 475 using Chemi - Lumi One Super Kit ( Nacalai Tesque ) under a LAS - 3000 Imager ( Fujifilm , Tokyo , Japan ) . 476 477 Live - cell fluorescence microscopy 478 A confocal laser - scanning microscope ( FV3000 , Olympus Corporation ) equipped with a stage incubator 479 ( TOKAI HIT Corporation , Shizuoka , Japan ) was used for live - cell imaging . The lateral spatial resolution is 480 ~ 200 nm under optimised operation . All observations were performed at 37 °C , under 5 . 0 % CO 2 . Cos7 cells 481 were seeded on a 30 - mm glass - bottom dish with 40 % density and transfected with the vectors mentioned 482 19 / 46 earlier 24 h before imaging . Time - lapse fluorescence images were captured every 5 s and analysed with 483 ImageJ ( ver 1 . 52a ; https : / / imagej . nih . gov ) and the GIMP software ( ver 2 . 10 . 18 ) . 484 485 Super - resolution SIM live - cell imaging 486 Super - resolution SIM was performed using Elyra 7 with Lattice SIM 2 ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . The 487 lateral spatial resolution was ~ 60 nm under optimised operation conditions . Regarding two - colour live - cell 488 imaging , Cos7 cells with 40 % cell density were seeded on a 30 - mm glass - bottom dish and transfected with 489 vectors encoding EGFP - fused CLTB and mCherry - fused CIP4 24 h before imaging . The culture medium in 490 the dish was exchanged with the phenol red - free DMEM ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 30 min before imaging . Images 491 were taken every 0 . 5 s and processed with the Zeiss Enz 3 . 6 blue edition software . The images were analysed 492 with ImageJ ( ver 1 . 52a ) . 493 494 Circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy 495 The CD spectra were acquired with a JASCO J - 805 spectropolarimeter ( JASCO Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) 496 using 1 . 0 mL quartz cuvettes with a 5 - mm path length . The purified HR1 domain was diluted with 1×PBS to 497 the final concentration of 0 . 2 mg / mL . The measurements were performed at 25 °C in the 280 – 198 nm range 498 with a data point interval of 0 . 2 nm . The obtained spectra were analysed using the Spectra Manager software 499 ( ver 1 . 0 , JASCO Corporation ) , and the reference spectra were provided by Dr . Yang , J . T 68 . 500 501 Crosslinking assay 502 BS 3 crosslinkers ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were dissolved in distilled water , added to the protein solution to 503 a final concentration of 2 mM , and incubated at 28 ℃ for 30 min . Recombinant His - CIP4 - HR1 treated with 504 crosslinkers was subjected to SDS - PAGE and silver staining using Silver Stain II Kit ( Fujifilm ) according to 505 the manufacturer’s instruction . 506 507 Gel - filtration chromatography 508 Gel - filtration chromatography was performed with the AKTA purifier system ( GE Healthcare , Chicago , IL , 509 USA ) controlled by the Unicorn 5 . 1 software . The running buffer contains 20 mM NaCl , 25 mM HEPES , and 510 20 / 46 0 . 2 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol . Superdex 75 10 / 300 GL column ( Cytiva ) with a void volume ( Vo ) of 7 . 2 mL was 511 used . The calibration curve was obtained by plotting the molecular weight of marker proteins against the 512 partition coefficient ( K av ) . K av was calculated with the equation : K av = ( Ve - Vo ) / ( Vt - Vo ) . Ve : elution volume ; 513 Vo : void volume ; Vt : total volume . 514 515 Phase separation assay 516 Hexa - histidine - tagged recombinant proteins of CIP4 - FDR , FBP17 - FDR , and Synd2 - IDR were used for the 517 phase separation assay . The purified protein ( ~ 10 mg / mL ) was incubated with ATTO488 - maleimide ( Thermo 518 Fisher Scientific ) at 28 °C for 1 h . The reaction was quenched using 4 mM DTT . Droplet formation was 519 induced by adding 5 % polyethene glycol and imaged using fluorescence microscopy ( FV3000 , Olympus 520 Corporation ) . For examining interaction with actin , purified actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . , Denver , CO , USA ) and 521 rhodamine - labelled actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) were reconstituted with the following buffer : 5 mM Tris - HCl 522 ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 5 % ( w / v ) sucrose . Rhodamine - labelled and non - labelled actin 523 were mixed at 1 : 20 to a final concentration of 450 μ g / mL and pre - incubated with Mg 2 + ( 50 μM ) and EGTA 524 ( 0 . 2 mM ) at 28 °C for 4 min .

Mg 2 + - charged actin was then added to 45 μ g / mL and observed using a fluorescence 527 microscope ( FV3000 ) . 528 529 Turbidity assay 530 Recombinant proteins of hexa - histidine - tagged CIP4 - FDR , FBP17 - FDR , Synd2 - IDR , CIP4 - FDR - 4S , CIP4 - 531 HR1 , CIP4 - HR1 ( 4S ) , CIP4 - FDR ( ∆ HR1 ) , CIP4 - FDR ( ∆ IDR1 ) and CIP4 - FDR ( ∆ IDR2 ) were used in the 532 turbidity assay . Purified proteins were serially diluted with a Dilution Buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 100 533 mM NaCl ) , mixed with an equal volume of Droplet Buffer ( 30 % polyethene glycol , 50 mM HEPES , 100 mM 534 NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min . The mixture was then transferred to a micro - cuvette 535 ( BRANDTech Scientific Inc . , ESSEX , CT , USA ) , and the optical density was measured at 600 nm using a 536 spectrophotometer ( JASCO V - 630 ) . The saturation concentration ( C sat ) was obtained by fitting the data with 537 the following equation using OriginPro ( v . 9 . 8 ) : 538 21 / 46 OD 600 = OD max C n / ( C satn + C n ) , 539 where C represents protein concentration . 540 541 Multiple sequence alignment 542 Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the T - Coffee test 54 . Sequence similarity was determined 543 using EMBOSS Needle ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / Tools / psa / emboss _ needle / ) . 544 545 Three - dimensional protein structure predictions 546 The three - dimensional protein structure was predicted using ColabFold ( v . 1 . 5 . 2 : AlphaFold2 using MMseqs2 ) 547 ( https : / / colab . research . google . com / github / sokrypton / ColabFold / blob / main / AlphaFold2 . ipynb ) 69 , 70 . The amino 548 acids sequence of CIP4 - HR1 used for the prediction is shown in Extended Data Figs . 3d . 549 550 Statistical analysis 551 To analyse the closing patterns of CCPs , relatively equal numbers of CCP images were collected from four 552 different Cos7 cells .

Membrane - bound and activated 941 Cdc42 recruits CIP4 via direct interaction with HR1 ( a ) . CIP4 recruits and activates N - WASP to form a 942 ternary complex ( b ) . When the membrane - bound complex approaches a CCP , the F - BAR domain of CIP4 943 recognises and assembles on the curved membrane ( c ) . This increases the chance of interaction between FDRs 944 and initiates phase separation , resulting in an asymmetric assembly nearby the CCP ( d ) . Meanwhile , activated 945 N - WASP further recruits and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , initiating actin polymerisation ( d ) . The condensed 946 phase of CIP4 - FDR concentrates G - actin and accelerates the local actin polymerisation , which creates an 947 actin - rich environment ( d , e ) . Activated N - WASP may co - separate with CIP4 in the condensed phase , 948 accelerating Arp2 / 3 recruitment . Consequently , polymerised actin accumulated rapidly and asymmetrically 949 around CCP which deforms the plasma membrane and promotes the complete closing of the CCP ( e ) . 950 f , Schematic illustration of the potential correlation between actin - and dynamin - driven pit - closing . 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 37 / 46 961 38 / 46 Extended Data Fig . 1 Asymmetric closing pattern of the CCP . 962 a – c , Additional examples of the time - lapse HS - AFM images of asymmetric ( a ) , symmetric ( b ) , and 963 undetermined ( c ) closing patterns obtained from Cos7 cells .
