Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . INTRODUCTION This paper explores the relationship between the openness of ﬁrms’ external search strategies and their innovative performance . Chesbrough ( 2003a ) suggests that many innovative ﬁrms have shifted to an ‘open innovation’ model , using a wide range of external actors and sources to help them achieve and sustain innovation . A central part of the innovation process involves search for new ideas that have commercial potential . Firms often invest considerable amounts of time , money and other resources in the search for new innovative opportunities . Such investment increases the abil - ity to create , use , and recombine new and exist - ing knowledge . Accordingly , a variety of empir - ical studies have indicated that the character of a ﬁrm’s internal search strategy within a tech - nological trajectory can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence its Keywords : openness ; innovative search ; search strategies ; innovation ; innovative performance * Correspondence to : Ammon Salter , Tanaka Business School , Imperial College London , South Kensington Campus , London SW7 2AZ , U .

However , Chesbrough’s work on the ‘open inno - vation’ model has not yet been empirically exam - ined using a large - scale dataset and the previous literature on innovative search has not yet inves - tigated the role of search among external actors and sources . In this paper , we follow the work of Cohen and Levinthal , who argue that the ability to exploit external knowledge is a critical component of innovative performance ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 : 128 ) . Extending Cohen and Levinthal , we investigate the inﬂuence of search strategies for external knowledge . In doing so , we develop the concepts of breadth and depth as two compo - nents of the openness of individual ﬁrms’ external search strategies . We link empirically the breadth and depth of external search to innovative per - formance , exploring how differences in search strategies among ﬁrms inﬂuence their ability to achieve different levels of novelty in their innova - tive activities . We ﬁnd that ﬁrms who have open search strategies—those who search widely and deeply—tend to be more innovative . However , we Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

Salter ﬁnd that the beneﬁts to openness are subject to decreasing returns , indicating that there is a point where additional search becomes unproductive . We explore the implications of this ﬁnding for theories of managerial attention and for innovative perfor - mance . The research is based on a statistical analysis of the U . K . innovation survey . The survey explores the innovation process inside ﬁrms and it con - tains a sample of 2707 manufacturing ﬁrms . The method of analysis is a double - truncated Tobit model where the dependent variable is innovative performance , which is explained by a ﬁrm’s exter - nal search strategies , R & D intensity and a number of control variables , such as market orientation and size . The paper is organized into ﬁve sections . The ﬁrst section explores the literature and exam - ines the inﬂuence of external search on innova - tive performance , describing the hypotheses that drive the analysis . The next two sections outline the database and describe the model . The fourth section reports the results and the ﬁnal section con - tains the discussion and conclusions . CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND The role of networks , communities , and link - ages has come to the fore in investigations of innovative performance . The early Schumpeterian model of the lone entrepreneur bringing innova - tions to markets has been superseded by a rich picture of different actors working together in iter - ative processes of trial and error to bring about the successful commercial exploitation of a new idea ( Schumpeter , 1942 / 87 ; Rosenberg , 1982 ; von Hippel , 1988 ; Freeman and Soete , 1997 ; Tidd , Bessant , and Pavitt , 2000 ) . These newer models of innovation have highlighted the interactive charac - ter of the innovation process , suggesting that inno - vators rely heavily on their interaction with lead users , suppliers , and with a range of institutions inside the innovation system ( von Hippel , 1988 ; Lundvall , 1992 ; Brown and Eisenhardt , 1995 ; Szu - lanski , 1996 ) . In this respect , innovators rarely innovate alone . They tend to band together in teams and coalitions based on ‘swift trust , ’ nested in communities of practice and embedded in a dense network of interactions ( Scott and Brown , 1999 ; Brown and Duguid , 2000 ) . A recent example of research regarding the inter - active , distributed , and open nature of innovation can be seen in Chesbrough’s ‘open innovation’ model ( Chesbrough , 2003a , 2003b ) . This model suggests that the advantages that ﬁrms gain from internal R & D expenditure have declined . Accord - ingly , many innovative ﬁrms now spend little on R & D and yet they are able to successfully inno - vate by drawing in knowledge and expertise from a wide range of external sources . The erosion in the strategic advantage of internal R & D is related to the increased mobility of knowledge workers , making it difﬁcult for ﬁrms to appropriate and control their R & D investments . Chesbrough argues that open innovators commercialize external ideas by deploying outside ( as well as in - house ) path - ways to the market ( Chesbrough , 2003b ) . This pro - cess redeﬁnes the boundary between the ﬁrm and its surrounding environment , making the ﬁrm more porous and embedded in loosely coupled networks of different actors , collectively and individually working toward commercializing new knowledge . At the center of the open innovation model and other similar conceptualizations of innova - tion is how ﬁrms’ use ideas and knowledge of external actors in their innovation processes . Ches - brough ( 2003b ) suggests that ﬁrms that are ‘too focused internally’ are ‘prone to miss a num - ber of opportunities because many will fall out - side the organization’s current business or will need to be combined with external technologies to unlock their potential . ’ An example of this open innovation model can be seen in Proctor & Gamble’s ( P & G’s ) approach to R & D . In order to ensure greater exploitation of external ideas and actors , P & G shifted its R & D strategy toward ‘con - nect and develop’ rather than focusing on internal R & D . P & G appears to be opening itself up to a wide range of external sources of innovative ideas , explicitly drawing in the ideas of others . The ‘connect and develop’ model is based on the idea that external sources of ideas may often be more valuable than internal ones ( Sakkab , 2002 ) . Accordingly , open innovators are those that inte - grate these external sources into their innovation processes and competitive strategy ( Chesbrough , 2003b ) . The focus on openness and interaction in studies of innovation reﬂects a wider trend in studies of ﬁrm behavior that suggest that the network of rela - tionships between the ﬁrm and its external environ - ment can play an important role in shaping per - formance . For instance , Shan , Walker , and Kogut ( 1994 ) ﬁnd an association between cooperation and Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) Open for Innovation 133 innovative output in biotechnology start - up ﬁrms . Ahuja ( 2000 ) ﬁnds that indirect and direct ties inﬂuence the ability of a ﬁrm to innovate , but that the effectiveness of indirect ties is moderated by the number of the ﬁrm’s direct ties . Rosenkopf and Nerkar ( 2001 ) explore the role of boundary - spanning searches for both organizational and tech - nological boundaries and ﬁnd that search processes that do not span over organizational boundaries generate lower effects on subsequent technological evolution , indicating that the impact of explorative search is greatest when the search spans both orga - nizational and technological boundaries . Powell , Koput , and Smith - Doerr ( 1996 ) investigate interor - ganizational collaboration in biotechnology and assess the contribution of collaboration to learn - ing and performance , showing that ﬁrms embedded in beneﬁt - rich networks are likely to have greater innovative performance . In sum , all these studies point to the importance of open behavior by ﬁrms in their search for innovative opportunities and they suggest that performance differences between organizations can be ascribed to this behavior . Research in evolutionary economics also sug - gests that a ﬁrm’s openness to its external envi - ronment can improve its ability to innovate . Evo - lutionary economists highlight the role of search in helping organizations to ﬁnd sources of vari - ety , allowing them to create new combinations of technologies and knowledge ( Nelson and Win - ter , 1982 ) . Such variety provides opportunities for ﬁrms to choose among different technologi - cal paths ( Metcalfe , 1994 ) . Search strategies are also strongly inﬂuenced by the richness of techno - logical opportunities available in the environment and by the search activities of other ﬁrms ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Levinthal and March , 1993 ) . In industries , with high levels of technological oppor - tunities and extensive investments in search by other ﬁrms , a ﬁrm will often need to search more widely and deeply in order to gain access to criti - cal knowledge sources . In contrast , in industries where there are low technological opportunities and modest investments in search by other ﬁrms , a ﬁrm has weaker incentives to draw from exter - nal knowledge sources and may instead rely on internal sources ( Klevorick et al . , 1995 ) . Investigating search has also become a key ele - ment in efforts to explain innovative performance . Using patent evidence from the robotics and chem - ical sectors , Katila ( 2002 ) and Katila and Ahuja ( 2002 ) investigate the link between search strategy and innovative performance . These studies demon - strate that the age of knowledge and the depth and scope of search processes can inﬂuence the potential for innovation . Together these studies shift attention toward the role of search strate - gies in explaining innovative performance and sug - gest that the conventional explanatory variables of innovation performance , such as size and R & D expenditure , need to be complemented by investi - gation into how differences in search strategy give rise to performance heterogeneity . Our approach builds on and extends previous lit - erature in three ways . First , whereas Katila ( 2002 ) and Katila and Ahuja ( 2002 ) focus on search inside the ﬁrm and along a technological trajec - tory ( as reﬂected in patent citations ) , we focus on the ﬁrm’s external innovative search efforts . We seek to examine how different strategies for using external sources of knowledge inﬂuence innovative performance . Our approach focuses on the search channels , such as suppliers , users , and universities , that ﬁrms use in their search for innovative oppor - tunities . The concept of search channels shifts attention toward the type and number of pathways of exchange between a ﬁrm and its environment rather than toward the degree of its interaction within each of these search channels . In doing so , it focuses attention on the variety of channels used by the ﬁrm in its search activities . Following Scott and Brown ( 1999 ) and Brown and Duguid ( 2000 ) , our approach sees each of these channels as a sep - arate search space , encompassing different insti - tutional norms , habits , and rules , often requiring different organizational practices in order to render the search processes effective within the particular knowledge domain . For example , working with a private research laboratory often involves a very different process of exchange than working with a university , including different contractual rules , norms of disclosure and cultural attitudes ( Das - gupta and David , 1994 ) . Our approach provides a mechanism to explore the relationship between openness of ﬁrms to different knowledge domains and its innovative performance . A limitation of the approach is that it does not allow for the analysis of the importance of breadth and depth of exter - nal search to innovative performance within each channel or knowledge domain . Second , the preceding studies of search and innovation say relatively little about the way in which ﬁrms draw external ideas into their innova - tion processes . These studies are largely based on Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) 134 K . Laursen and A . Salter analysis of patent citation data and patents have several serious shortcomings as indicators of inno - vation and innovative search . Patents can reﬂect inventive activities , but may at the same time be the outcome of the appropriability strategy of the ﬁrm ( Teece , 1986 ; Chesbrough , 2003a ) . In addi - tion , most patents are not commercialized and they are widely acknowledged to be a partial indica - tor of the innovation process only , since many innovations are only partly covered by patent pro - tection—or not patented at all ( Levin et al . , 1987 ; Klevorick et al . , 1995 ) . Patents citations may also reﬂect technological similarities in technological proﬁles of different ﬁrms , rather than search activ - ities ( Patel and Pavitt , 1997 ) . Moreover , many of the citations in patents are added by the Patent Ofﬁce , rather than by the patentee , and in those cases the citations in patents itself says little about the importance of different sources of innovation ( Alcacer and Gittelman , 2004 ) . Like the Yale sur - vey ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ) , our study is based on a questionnaire survey of managers in manufacturing ﬁrms , asking them directly about what sources of knowledge they rely upon in their innovation activities . This approach allows us to examine the nature of external search strategy , highlighting the range of choices ﬁrms make about how best to exploit external sources of knowledge . Third , by using the U . K . innovation survey , it is possible to investigate the impact of search on different types of innovation . The U . K . innovation survey provides estimates of the degree of novelty of innovation achieved by the ﬁrm and therefore it is possible to analyze whether search affects different types of innovative activity . By exploring the relationship between search and the degree of novelty in innovation , it is possible to investigate the inﬂuence of the product life cycle on the relationship between search and performance . HYPOTHESES External search breadth and depth A central component in the movement toward open or interactive innovation models is a change in the way ﬁrms go about searching for new ideas and technologies for innovation . Product search can be deﬁned as an ‘ [ o ] rganization’s problem - solving activities that involve the creation and recombi - nation of technological ideas’ ( Katila and Ahuja , 2002 : 1184 ) . The product development process is itself a form of problem - solving activity and associated search processes involve investments in building and sustaining links with users , suppliers , and a wide range of different institutions inside the innovation system ( von Hippel , 1988 ) . The use of different knowledge sources by an individual ﬁrm is partly shaped by the external environment , including the availability of tech - nological opportunities , the degree of turbulence in the environment , and the search activities of other ﬁrms in the industry ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ; Klevorick et al . , 1995 ) . Despite the impor - tance of the external environment in shaping the search behavior , the search activities of differ - ent ﬁrms in an industry are subject to consid - erable variety and this variety is a product of different ( past and present ) managerial choices about how best to organize the search for , and the development of , new products . In this respect , an organization’s search processes are rooted in its previous experience as past success condi - tions future behavior . According to Levinthal and March ( 1993 ) , organizations build ‘inventories’ or ‘storehouses of information and experience both within the organization and outside it . . . They stockpile knowledge about products , technolo - gies , markets and political contexts . They develop networks of contacts with consultants and col - leagues’ ( Levinthal and March , 1993 : 103 ) . More - over , future expectations as perceived by managers may differ when facing the same opportunity set ( Shane , 2003 ) . Since search strategies are rooted in the past experiences and future expectations of managers , it is difﬁcult for many organiza - tions to determine the ‘optimal’ search strategy in terms of being ‘broader and deeper’ , espe - cially in situations where there is turbulence in the knowledge base of the ﬁrm ( Levinthal and March , 1993 : 103 ) . Those organizations that invest in broader and deeper search may have a greater ability to adapt to change and therefore to innovate . In order to examine the inﬂuence of broader and deeper exter - nal search on performance , we develop two con - cepts . The ﬁrst concept refers to external search breadth , which is deﬁned as the number of exter - nal sources or search channels that ﬁrms rely upon in their innovative activities . The second concept refers to external search depth and it is deﬁned in terms of the extent to which ﬁrms draw deeply from the different external sources Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) Open for Innovation 135 or search channels . Together the two variables represent the openness of ﬁrms’ external search processes . Two previous studies are especially pertinent to our approach . First , Katila ( 2002 ) explores how the age of technological knowledge from within and outside the industry shapes product search and innovative performance in the robotics industry . The study ﬁnds that differences in innovative per - formance are based on differences in how ﬁrms deploy knowledge from different industries and over time . Second , Katila and Ahuja ( 2002 ) exam - ine how search depth , i . e . , how the ﬁrm reuses its existing knowledge , and search scope , i . e . , how widely the ﬁrm explores new knowledge , inﬂuence innovative performance . They suggest that these concepts provide an extension of March’s ( 1991 ) distinction between exploration and exploitation , contrasting the differences between local and dis - tant search processes . In their study , search depth is measured by the ‘number of times a ﬁrm repeat - edly used the citations in the patents it applied for’ and search scope is measured as ‘share of citations found in a focal year’s citations that could not be found in the previous ﬁve years’ list of patents and citations by the ﬁrm’ ( Katila and Ahuja , 2002 ) . They ﬁnd that a ﬁrm’s innovative performance is in part a function of its search behavior and that there is a curvilinear relationship—taking an inverted U - shape—between depth and scope on the one hand and innovative performance on the other , indicating that some ﬁrms have a tendency to ‘over - search’ ( Katila and Ahuja , 2002 ) . The ﬁrst of our key concepts is external search breadth . Extending on Katila and Ahuja , we hypothesize that external search breadth inﬂu - ences innovative performance . Recall that exter - nal search breath is deﬁned as the number of different search channels that a ﬁrm draws upon in its innovative activities . Accordingly , organiza - tions often have to go through a period of trial and error to learn how to gain knowledge from an external source . It requires extensive effort and time to build up an understanding of the norms , habits , and routines of different external knowledge channels . This process of learning to absorb external knowledge is subject to consid - erable uncertainty in the sense that ex ante it is difﬁcult for managers to know which exter - nal source will be the most rewarding before engaging in the relationship . Accordingly , in some organizations , past unrewarding experiences may create a myopia toward the potential of using different external sources ( Levinthal and March , 1993 : 103 ) , and in turn this experience may lead them to turn inward , relying on their own resources and capabilities to develop new prod - ucts . Although we hypothesize that external search breadth is associated with innovative performance , we also argue that ﬁrms may ‘over - search’ and that this will have negative consequences for their innovation performance . Given that search strate - gies are rooted in the past experiences and future expectations of managers , such experience and expectations may lead ﬁrms to over - search the external environment with a detrimental outcome as the result . Koput ( 1997 ) provides three related reasons why over - searching may have a nega - tive inﬂuence on performance . First , there may be too many ideas for the ﬁrm to manage and choose between ( ‘the absorptive capacity prob - lem’ ) . Second , many innovative ideas may come at the wrong time and in the wrong place to be fully exploited ( ‘the timing problem’ ) . Third , since there are so many ideas , few of these ideas are taken seriously or given the required level of attention or effort to bring them into implementation ( ‘the attention allocation prob - lem’ ) . As implied by the name , the attention alloca - tion problem is the key element in attention - based theories of the ﬁrm ( Simon , 1947 ; Ocasio , 1997 ) . This theory suggests that managerial attention is the most precious resource inside the organiza - tion and that the decision to allocate attention to particular activities is a key factor in explain - ing why some ﬁrms are able to both adapt to changes in their external environment and to intro - duce new products and processes . Central to this approach is to highlight the pool of attention inside the ﬁrm and how this attention is allo - cated . According to the theory , decision - makers need to ‘concentrate their energy , effort and mind - fulness on a limited number of issues’ in order to achieve sustained strategic performance ( Oca - sio , 1997 : 203 ) . Consequently , the theory sug - gests that a poor allocation of managerial attention can lead to ﬁrms engaging in too many ( or too few ) external and internal communication chan - nels . Both Koput’s model of innovative search and the attention - based theory of the ﬁrm suggest that there is a point at which external search breadth Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) 136 K . Laursen and A . Salter becomes disadvantageous . In sum , the hypothesis can be stated as : Hypothesis 1 : External search breadth is curvi - linearly ( taking an inverted U - shape ) related to innovative performance . Search for new ideas is not just about scanning a wide number of sources ; it also involves drawing knowledge heavily from these sources . Innovative ﬁrms often draw deeply from a small number of external sources . Key sources for innovators are often lead users , suppliers , or universities ( von Hippel , 1988 ) . For each of these sources , ﬁrms need to sustain a pattern of interaction over time , building up a shared understanding and common ways of working together . Assessing the depth of a ﬁrm’s contacts with different external sources provides a mechanism for understanding the way ﬁrms search deeply within the innovation system and how these external sources are integrated into internal innovative efforts . Recall that our concept of external search depth is deﬁned as the extent to which ﬁrms draw inten - sively from different search channels or sources of innovative ideas . Hence , it reﬂects the impor - tance of deep use of key sources to the internal innovation process . We expect ﬁrms that draw deeply from external sources to be more innova - tive , because they are able to build and sustain virtuous exchanges and collaborations with exter - nal actors . However—as in the case of search breadth—we expect to ﬁnd that some ﬁrms can become too deeply reliant on external sources for innovation . Maintaining deep links with external resources requires resources and attention . There - fore , we expect to ﬁnd that if a ﬁrm relies on too many deep relationships with many exter - nal sources , it will exhibit lower innovative per - formance . Accordingly , the hypothesis can be stated as : Hypothesis 2 . External search depth is curvi - linearly ( taking an inverted U - shape ) related to innovative performance . Novelty of innovation It is common in studies of innovation to explore the differences in the innovation process for inno - vations associated with different degrees of novelty ( Freeman and Soete , 1997 ) . A variety of empirical studies have shown that the level of novelty of an innovation strongly inﬂuences the factors that shape innovative performance ( Garcia and Calan - tone , 2002 ) . Taxonomies of novelty of innovation span from radical and truly revolutionary , such as the microchip , to the incremental , such as chang - ing packaging on existing products ( Henderson and Clark , 1990 ; Freeman and Soete , 1997 ; Tidd et al . , 2000 ) . Radical innovations seem to offer the great - est opportunity for performance differences ( Mar - sili and Salter , 2005 ) . Tushman and Anderson clas - sify radical innovation in terms of ‘competence - enhancing’ or ‘competence - destroying’ , reﬂecting the different ways novel innovations alter patterns of industrial competition among ﬁrms working within the industry ( Tushman and Anderson , 1986 ; Anderson and Tushman , 1990 ) . To achieve radical innovation , ﬁrms often need to make a consider - able investment in R & D and the chances of success are lower as the rewards are great . As Schumpeter stated , radical innovation offers ‘the carrot of spec - tacular reward or the stick of destitution’ ( Schum - peter , 1942 / 87 ) . In contrast , incremental innova - tion is more common and the reward is smaller . It requires less effort and its performance implica - tions appear to be more modest ( Marsili and Salter , 2005 ) . To our knowledge little work has been carried out on the relationship between the degree of nov - elty of the innovation and the breadth and depth of ﬁrms’ innovative search strategies , let alone ﬁrms’ external innovative search strategies . Rad - ical innovation may involve a higher degree of discontinuity in the sources of innovation , since knowledge sources previously used may be obso - lete in the new context ( Abernathy and Utterback , 1975 ; Christensen , 1997 ) . Accordingly , we expect the use of a few new sources of innovation—used intensively—to be important in the case of radical innovations . Empirical research has shown that in the early phase of the product life - cycle innova - tions come from a narrow range of sources—in many cases only one—in particular from users , suppliers , and from universities ( Rothwell et al . , 1974 ; Urban and von Hippel , 1988 ; von Hippel , 1988 ) . A recent example of a single source being of utmost importance in the context of radical innovation is biotechnology , where universities are arguably the key source to innovation ( Zucker , Darby , and Brewer , 1998 ) . Another example is scientiﬁc instruments , where lead users played the key role to the extent that close to 50 percent of Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) Open for Innovation 137 the innovations came from such users ( Riggs and von Hippel , 1996 ) . For more incremental innovations , however , after a dominant design has emerged ( Abernathy and Utterback , 1975 ; Utterback , 1994 ) , we expect that a broad variety of sources may be impor - tant . After a dominant design has emerged , ﬁrms focus on ‘ﬁne - tuning’ the product by means of incremental improvements which are inspired by many different sources of innovation . As the prod - uct matures and the market expands , the num - ber of actors with speciﬁc knowledge of vari - ous aspects of the technology increases . In these diverse knowledge environments , ﬁrms need to be able to work with many different actors in the innovation system ( Pavitt , 1998 ) . In other words , radical innovators are likely to draw more deeply from external sources of innovation than ﬁrms that are not radical innovators , while incremental inno - vators are likely to draw more broadly ( but less intensively ) than non - innovators . These arguments can be stated in the following two hypotheses : Hypothesis 3 : The more radical the innovation , the less effective external search breadth will be in inﬂuencing innovative performance . Hypothesis 4 . The more radical the innovation , the more effective external search depth will be in inﬂuencing innovative performance . Openness and absorptive capacity The Not Invented Here ( NIH ) syndrome suggests that greater attention to external sources may con - front internal resistance from at least some of the company’s technical staff . The NIH syndrome can be deﬁned as ‘the tendency of a project group of stable composition to believe that it possesses a monopoly of knowledge in its ﬁeld , which leads it to reject new ideas from outsiders to the detri - ment of its performance’ ( Katz and Allen , 1982 : 7 ) . Accordingly , the NIH syndrome is a behav - ioral response that will induce a substitution rela - tionship between the use of external sources and internal R & D activities . 1 In contrast , Cohen and Levinthal ( 1989 , 1990 ) argue that R & D has two faces : not only does R & D generate genuinely new knowledge ; it also enhances the ﬁrm’s ability to assimilate and exploit existing knowledge from the 1 We are grateful to a referee for making this point . external environment , both in terms of the ﬁrm’s ability to imitate new processes or product innova - tions , and in terms of the ﬁrm’s ability to exploit knowledge of a more intermediate sort that pro - vides the basis for subsequent applied research and development . Since absorptive capacity and R & D spending are closely linked according to Cohen and Levinthal , we expect—while noting the coun - tervailing NIH syndrome—that ﬁrms with high levels of R & D intensity are better able to exploit a host of search channels in terms of breadth and depth . In sum , we hypothesize : Hypothesis 5 . The R & D intensity of the ﬁrm is complementary to external search breadth and depth in shaping innovative performance DATA AND METHODS Sample The data for the analysis are drawn from the U . K . innovation survey . The survey was imple - mented in 2001 and is based on the core Eurostat Community Innovation Survey ( CIS ) of innova - tion ( Stockdale , 2002 ; DTI , 2003b ) . The method and types of questions used in innovation sur - veys are described in the Organization for Eco - nomic Co - operation and Development’s ( OECD ) Olso Manual ( OECD , 1997 ) . CIS data have been used in over 60 recent academic articles , mainly in economics ( for recent prominent contributions using CIS data ; see Cassiman and Veugelers , 2002 ; Mairesse and Mohnen , 2002 ) . CIS surveys of inno - vation are often described as ‘subject - oriented’ because they ask individual ﬁrms directly whether they were able to produce an innovation . The interpretability , reliability , and validity of the sur - vey were established by extensive piloting and pre - testing before implementation within different European countries and across ﬁrms from a variety of industrial sectors , including services , construc - tion and manufacturing . The CIS questionnaire draws from a long tradi - tion of research on innovation , including the Yale survey and the SPRU innovation database ( for examples , see Levin et al . , 1987 ; Pavitt , Robson , and Townsend , 1987 , 1989 ; Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ; Klevorick et al . , 1995 ) . CIS data provide a useful complement to the traditional measures of innovation output , such as patent statistics ( Kaiser , Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) 138 K . Laursen and A . Salter 2002 ; Mairesse and Mohnen , 2002 ) . CIS data offer ‘a direct measure of success in commercializing innovations for a broad range of industries . . . that more traditional measures may not capture’ ( Leiponen and Helfat , 2003 ) . The questionnaire asks ﬁrms to indicate whether the ﬁrm has been able to achieve a product innovation . Product inno - vation is deﬁned as : . . . goods and services introduced to the market which are either new or signiﬁcantly improved with respect to fundamental characteristics . The inno - vations should be based on the results of new technological developments , new combinations of existing technology or utilization of other knowl - edge by your ﬁrm . ( DTI , 2003a ) Firms are then asked to state what share of their sales can be ascribed to different types of innova - tions , such as innovations new to the world . Along - side these performance questions , there are a num - ber of questions about the sources of knowledge for innovation , the effects of innovation , intellec - tual property strategies and expenditures on R & D , and other innovative activities . The U . K . innovation survey is 12 pages long and includes a page of deﬁnitions . The sample of respondents was created by the Ofﬁce of National Statistics ( ONS ) . It was sent to the ﬁrm’s ofﬁcial representative for ﬁlling in information on the ﬁrm’s activities , such as surveys for calculating the U . K . Gross Domestic Product and R & D expendi - tures . It was normally completed by the Managing Director , the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , or by the R & D manager of the ﬁrm . The implementation of the survey was administered by the ONS and to guide respondents a help service was provided ( Stockdale , 2002 ) . The survey was sent to 13 , 315 business units in the United Kingdom in April 2001 and a sup - plementary sample of 6287 was posted the survey in November 2001 . It received a response rate of 41 . 7 percent ( Stockdale , 2002 ) . The second mail out was designed to top up the number of regional responses to the survey . The responses were volun - tary and respondents were promised conﬁdentiality and that the survey would be used to shape gov - ernment policy . The sample was stratiﬁed by 12 Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation ( SIC ) classes and includes all main sectors of the U . K . economy , excluding public bodies , retail , and hotels and restaurants . The response rates for different sec - tors , regions , and size are largely consistent with the overall response pattern ( Stockdale , 2002 ) . Our subsample of the survey includes 2707 manufac - turing ﬁrms and draw from the entire U . K . manu - facturing sector . Descriptive results Using the U . K . innovation survey , we explore the knowledge sources for innovation in the United Kingdom . Table 1 lists all 16 external sources listed in the U . K . survey . Each ﬁrm was asked to indicate on a 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 scale the degree of use for each source . On the survey , the sources are grouped together under four different head - ings ( market , institutional , other , and specialized ) . Table 1 presents the results for the entire range of sources for U . K . manufacturing ﬁrms . Over - all , the results indicate that the most important source is suppliers of equipment , materials , and components , followed closely by clients and cus - tomers ( or ‘users’ ) . Alongside customers and sup - pliers , a range of standards , such as health and safety standards , are among key sources of inno - vation . As might be expected ( see von Hippel , 1988 ) , the results indicate that U . K . ﬁrms’ inno - vation activities are strongly determined by rela - tions between themselves and their suppliers and customers . In Table 2 , we examine the level of external search breadth and depth across industrial sectors . We also examine the level of R & D intensity and percentage of radical innovators in each indus - try . Overall , we ﬁnd that ﬁrms cite seven exter - nal sources of knowledge for innovation . Chem - icals , electrical and machinery industries exhibit the highest level of external search breath , indi - cating that ﬁrms in industries with medium to high levels of scientiﬁc and technological activity search widely . In contrast , ﬁrms in low - technology sectors , such as paper and printing , have the lowest levels of external search breadth . External search depth is by deﬁnition less com - mon . On average , ﬁrms draw deeply from only one source . Search depth is greatest in the machinery , chemicals , and transport industries . Firms in tex - tiles and wood product industries have little exter - nal search depth . Both the level of external search breadth and depth are highest in industries with high levels of R & D intensity and rates of inno - vation . For example , the chemical and electrical industries exhibit the highest rates of openness , the greatest percentage of radical innovators , and Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat .

However , there is no simple one - to - one relationship between innovativeness and openness at the industry level . This is reﬂected in the fact that some industries , such as basic metals , exhibit low rates of innovation , and broad and deep search patterns . One explanation for the dif - ference between patterns of search and innova - tiveness across industries may be related to the complexity of technological knowledge bases in different industries . In industries where there are simple technologies but high levels of innovation , patterns of innovative search may be narrower than in industries where there are complex technologies but low rates of innovation . Accordingly , more research on the sources and determinants of exter - nal search at the ﬁrm and industry level will be required in the future to better understand the com - plex relationship among innovativeness , search , and R & D intensity .

Salter Measures Dependent variable We use three proxies aimed at reﬂecting various types of innovative performance by ﬁrms . First , we use a variable aimed at indicating the ability of the ﬁrm to produce radical innovations . This variable is measured as the fraction of the ﬁrm’s turnover relating to products new to the world mar - ket ( INNWORLD ) . In addition , we add two vari - ables as proxies for incremental innovation . First , we include a variable expressing the fraction of the ﬁrm’s turnover pertaining to products new to the ﬁrm ( INNFIRM ) and another variable express - ing the fraction of the ﬁrm’s turnover pertaining to products signiﬁcantly improved ( INNIMP ) . The two latter variables are mutually exclusive since they—together with unchanged or only marginally modiﬁed products—add up to 100 % . Independent variables As determinants of innovative performance , we introduce two new variables reﬂecting openness in terms of external search strategies of ﬁrms . 2 The ﬁrst new variable is termed BREADTH and is constructed as a combination of the 16 sources of knowledge or information for innovation listed in Table 1 of this paper . As a starting point , each of the 16 sources are coded as a binary variable , 0 being no use and 1 being use of the given knowledge source . Subsequently , the 16 sources are simply added up so that each ﬁrm gets a 0 when no knowledge sources are used , while the ﬁrm gets the value of 16 , when all knowledge sources are used . In other words , it is assumed that ﬁrms that use higher numbers of sources are more ‘open’ , with respect to search breadth , than ﬁrms that are not . Although our variable is a relatively simple construct , it has a high degree of internal consistency ( Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient = 0 . 93 ) . External search depth is deﬁned as the extent to which ﬁrms draw intensively from different search channels or sources of innovative ideas . Accordingly , the second variable is named DEPTH and is constructed using the same 16 sources of knowledge as those used in constructing 2 However , a very similar variable to that of the variable measur - ing search breadth has been used by Laursen and Salter ( 2003 ) as a predictor of the propensity of ﬁrms to use knowledge devel - oped at universities . Also Leiponen and Helfat ( 2003 ) use a similar search breadth variable . BREADTH . In this case each of the 16 sources are coded with 1 when the ﬁrm in question reports that it uses the source to a high degree and 0 in the case of no , low , or medium use of the given source . As in the case of BREADTH , the 16 sources are subsequently added up so that each ﬁrm gets a score of 0 when no knowledge sources are used to a high degree , while the ﬁrm gets the value of 16 when all knowledge sources are used to a high degree ( Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient = 0 . 76 ) . Again , it is assumed that ﬁrms that use higher numbers of sources are more ‘open’ with respect to search depth than ﬁrms that are not . As a test of the robustness of the results for the measure of external search depth , we calculate an alternative measure ( DEPTH COLLAB ) by look - ing at whether or not the ﬁrm in question has for - mal innovation collaboration links with different external sources . This variable is based on a sub - sequent question on the U . K . innovation survey . The survey lists eight different external partners , including : ( 1 ) suppliers , ( 2 ) clients or customers , ( 3 ) competitors , ( 4 ) consultants , ( 5 ) commercial laboratories / R & D enterprises , ( 6 ) universities or other higher education institutes , ( 7 ) government research organizations , or ( 8 ) private research institutes . As in the case of BREADTH and DEPTH , the eight dummies are subsequently added up so that each ﬁrm gets a score of 0 when no partners are used , while the ﬁrm gets a value of 8 when the ﬁrm is collaborating with all potential collaboration partners ( Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient = 0 . 83 ) . Although the list of sources on the questionnaire is not fully comprehensive , it is extensive and the items are not mutually exclusive . It reﬂects a wide range of sources of innovation , including suppliers , clients , and competitors as well as general institu - tions operating inside the innovation system , such as regulations and standards . The sources listed in the survey overlap with the resources and insti - tutions that are considered part of the national innovation system ( Lundvall , 1992 ; Nelson , 1993 ; Spencer , 2001 ) . Although the introduction of any variable into a well - established area of research is always contentious , the introduction of the two new variables to reﬂect the openness of innovative search does enable researchers to better explore the link between innovative search and innovative performance . Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) Open for Innovation 141 Control variables We include a measure of R & D intensity ( RDINT ) , measured as ﬁrm R & D expenditure divided by ﬁrm sales , in order both to control the effect on R & D on innovative performance and in order to test Hypothesis 5 . The numerator is taken from the U . K . innovation survey , while the denomina - tor ﬁrm turnover or sales is based on Ofﬁce of National Statistics register data , supplied with the survey data . Given that many studies of innovation have found that a key source for innovations are lead users , we include a variable reﬂecting the use of lead users in innovation ( Rothwell et al . , 1974 ; Urban and von Hippel , 1988 ; von Hippel , 1988 ) . The variable ( USER ) is constructed based on the ‘clients or customers’ source of knowledge for innovation listed in Table 1 . Simply the variable takes the value of 1 when the ﬁrm indicates that it uses clients or customers to a high degree as sources of information and knowledge for inno - vation activities , and 0 otherwise . Moreover , we include ﬁrm size and whether or not the ﬁrm was a recent start - up . Firm size ( expressed in loga - rithms ) is measured by the number of employ - ees ( LOGEMP ) . Whether or not the ﬁrm was a start - up in the period 1998 – 2000 ( STARTUP ) is based on a question on the survey concern - ing whether or not the ﬁrm was established dur - ing that period . In addition , we control for the size of the perceived product market ( GEOMAR - KET ) . The variable measures whether the largest market of the ﬁrm is perceived to be local , regional , national , or international . This variable takes the values from 1 to 4 , with 1 corresponding to ‘local’ and 4 corresponding to ‘international’ . Furthermore—and using a binary variable—we control for whether or not ﬁrms engaged in col - laboration arrangements on innovation activities ( COLLAB ) , a supplementary question on the sur - vey . Finally , we include 13 industry controls to account for different propensities to innovate across industries . Statistical method and results The dependent variable in the regression model is ( double ) censored , since the variable is the percent - age of innovative sales and therefore by deﬁnition ranges between 0 and 100 . Accordingly , a Tobit analysis is applied ( see Greene , 2000 : 905 – 926 ) . However , the assumption of normality of residu - als in the standard Tobit model is not satisﬁed in our case . Under these conditions , the maximum likelihood estimators of the standard Tobit model are not consistent . Alternative speciﬁcations of the Tobit model have been formulated that account for departures of the distributions from normality ( see Greene , 2000 : 916 ) . The variables reﬂecting the innovative performance of ﬁrms are highly skewed and , accordingly , the pattern observed in the empirical distribution is better represented by lognormal distributions . Other studies , facing sim - ilar problems in terms of similar characteristics of skewness and departure from normality , have proposed a log - transformation of the Tobit model with a multiplicative exponential error term ( Fil - ippucci , Drudi , and Papalia , 1996 ; Papalia and Di Iorio , 2001 ) . We apply this approach to the study of innovative performance and assume a lognormal distribution for the residuals of the Tobit model . 3 This model introduces a latent variable , INN ∗ , as a logarithmic transformation of an observed measure of innovative performance , INN : that is , INN ∗ = ln ( 1 + INN ) . It is then assumed that the latent variable of innovative performance of a ﬁrm i is a function of a number of explicative variables . Descriptive statistics are given in Table 3 . From the table it can be seen that on , average , 2 . 81 percent of ﬁrms’ turnover can be attributed to products new to the world ( INNWORLD ) , while 4 . 94 percent of ﬁrms’ turnover pertain to inno - vations new to the ﬁrm ( INNFIRM ) . 4 . 72 per - cent can be attributed to turnover in signiﬁcantly improved products ( INNIMP ) . Moreover , on aver - age , ﬁrms use about seven sources of knowl - edge for their innovative activities , but they use only about one source deeply . Simple correlations between our explanatory variables can be found in the Appendix . The results of the Tobit regression analy - sis can be found in Table 4 . We ﬁnd strong support for the hypothesis asserting that exter - nal search breadth is curvilinearly—taking an inverted U - shape—related to innovative perfor - mance ( Hypothesis 1 ) . First , the parameter for external BREADTH is signiﬁcant and positive for all degrees of novelty of innovation ( INNWORLD , 3 However , it should be noted that the lognormal transformation neither changes the signs nor the signiﬁcance of parameters for the key variables in the subsequent estimations . Nor does the transformation change the relative sizes of the parameters for the search variables . Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) 142 K .

Second , the parameter for BREADTH squared is signiﬁcant as well , showing that when ﬁrms use too many sources in their search for innova - tion there are decreasing returns . From Figure 1 it can be seen that , in the case of innovations new to the world ( INNWORLD ) , the point where search appears to have negative consequences for performance—what could be called the ‘tipping point’—is at 11 sources , so that if ﬁrms use more than 11 sources of external knowledge for their innovative activities negative returns set in . How - ever , although the model predicts negative returns , we can only conclude that there are decreasing returns from a negative and signiﬁcant squared term , since the downward bend of the curve may not be statistically signiﬁcant . In order to inves - tigate this issue , we estimate a model where we replace BREADTH with a set of dummies , where the benchmark dummy is one , when BREADTH Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

Predicted relationship between innovative performance and the breadth of search through external sources of innovation takes the values of 9 – 14 ( i . e . , a range around the ‘tipping point’ ) ; 0 otherwise . 4 In a similar fashion , we create dummies for the ranges of 0 sources ; 1 – 4 sources ; 5 – 8 sources ; and for 9 – 16 sources . The results of this exercise are reported in Table 5 , Model IV ( for reasons of space , the results are reported for INNWORLD only ) . The results show that the dummies below the benchmark all have a negative sign—as expected—but only the dummy for the value of 0 is signiﬁcant . The dummy above the benchmark is positive but insigniﬁcant . Fur - ther experimentation with dummies reveals that if a dummy for the value of 16 sources is created separately ( not shown for reasons of space ) , such a dummy gets a negative sign , but it is not sig - niﬁcantly different from the benchmark at a con - ventional level of signiﬁcance . The results indicate that while there are decreasing returns in innova - tion for increased openness in terms of breadth , no negative returns are to be detected . We ﬁnd rather strong support for the hypothesis that external search depth—the extent to which ﬁrms draw intensively from different sources of innovative ideas—is curvilinearly ( taking an inverted U - shape ) related to innovative performance ( Hypothesis 2 ) , since the variable measuring the DEPTH of openness and the squared term are both signiﬁcant and have the expected 4 We are grateful to Bronwyn Hall for the suggestion of this econometric approach . signs for INNWORLD and INNFIRM . However , for INNIMP the parameters are not signiﬁcant . From Figure 2 it can be seen that in the case of INNWORLD the ‘tipping point’ is three sources , so that if ﬁrms use more than three sources of external knowledge deeply in their innovative activities , decreasing returns are likely to set in . As in the case of BREATH , we cannot be sure that there are statistically signiﬁcant negative returns , although such returns are predicted by our model . In order to test for negative returns , we again use the dummy variable approach . In the case of DEPTH , we create a benchmark for the values 2 – 4 sources . The two dummies created for values below the benchmark are for 0 and for 1 source respectively , while the dummies above the benchmark are for 5 – 8 sources and for 9 – 16 sources . The results of this analysis are also reported in Table 5 , Model IV . The results show that below the benchmark the dummy for 0 sources is negative and signiﬁcant . The dummies above the benchmark are both negative , but only the dummy for the value of 9 – 16 sources is signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level . Accordingly , the results indicate that while there are decreasing returns in innovation for increased openness in terms of external search depth , there are negative returns for 9 – 16 sources only .

Consequently , this additional analysis gives further support to Hypothesis 2 . As an additional robustness check , we examine whether recoding DEPTH , so that it does not only include the importance of a given source being ‘high , ’ but also being ‘medium , ’ will affect the results . In Table 5 , Model VI , we ﬁnd that the results are indeed robust to such a change in speciﬁcation . Again we ﬁnd a positive impact , but with decreasing returns . With respect to our hypothesis stating that the more radical the innovation , the less effective external search breadth will be on innovative performance ( Hypothesis 3 ) , we do ﬁnd some evidence for the hypothesis from Table 4 , Models I – III . In particular , the parameter for BREADTH in the case of INNWORLD is the smallest ; INN - FIRM is higher ; and the parameter for INNIMP is the highest . In other words , while the parameter for BREADTH is signiﬁcant and positive for all degrees of novelty of innovation , the parameter is smaller the more radical the level of innovation . However , we need to ﬁnd out whether or not the observed differences in parameter sizes are signif - icantly different . As a starting point , one would like to use an incremental F - test—utilizing the information in the constrained and unconstrained sum of squares—or a Wald test , utilizing the esti - mated coefﬁcients and the variances / covariances of the estimates from the unconstrained model .

Predicted relationship between innovative performance and the depth of search through external sources of innovation compare the sizes of parameters within the same regression model . Yet , in this case , we have coef - ﬁcients for the same independent variables , but we have different dependent variables—and hence three separate regression models . Accordingly , we cannot use a conventional incremental F - test or a Wald test . We solved this potential problem by esti - mating three models where the dependent variables are the difference between the initial dependent variables ( not shown for reasons of space ) . The outcome of this exercise shows that the size of the parameter in Model I ( where the dependent variable is INNWORLD ) for BREADTH is sig - niﬁcantly smaller than the parameter in Model III ( where the dependent variable is INNIMP ) at the 1 percent level and that the parameter in Model I is signiﬁcantly smaller than the parameter in Model II . Although the parameter in Model II is not sig - niﬁcantly smaller than the parameter estimated in Model III , it can be concluded overall that the ﬁnd - ings are largely consistent with Hypothesis 3 of this paper . The hypothesis afﬁrming that the more radical the innovation the more effective external search depth will be in shaping innovative performance ( Hypothesis 4 ) ﬁnds support as well . The param - eter for DEPTH of openness is the highest in the case of INNWORLD , while INNFIRM is lower and the parameter for INNIMP is the smallest to the extent that it is insigniﬁcant . Again we exam - ine whether the parameters in the three models are signiﬁcantly different . The results show that in the case of INNWORLD ( Model I ) the parameter for DEPTH is signiﬁcantly larger than for INNIMP ( Model III ) at the 5 percent level . The parameter for DEPTH in Model II is larger than the corre - sponding parameter in Model III ( 5 per cent level ) , but the parameter in Model I is not signiﬁcantly larger than the parameter in Model II . Neverthe - less , it can be concluded that , overall , the ﬁndings are generally consistent with Hypothesis 4 . We do not ﬁnd support for the hypothesis sug - gesting that the R & D intensity of the ﬁrm is com - plementary to external search breadth and depth in shaping innovative performance ( Hypothesis 5 ) . In fact , from Model VII in Table 5 , it can be seen that the interaction effects between R & D intensity and both BREADTH and DEPTH are signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level , but they have negative signs , indicating a substitution effect between internal R & D and openness . The ﬁnding is the same when INNFIRM and INNIMP are included as dependent variables ( the results of these estimations are not displayed for reasons of space ) . One likely inter - pretation of this result is that it is the product of the NIH syndrome—that greater attention to openness for external sources confronts internal resistance from some of the company’s technical staff . More - over , it may also be the result of an additional attention allocation problem , since ideas are pro - duced both internally and externally . Of our control variables , the parameters for R & D intensity ( RDINT ) , the scope of the market ( GEOMARKET ) , and collaboration in innovative activities ( COLLAB ) are consistently positive and signiﬁcant in explaining the proportion of sales due Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

The parameters for lead users ( USER ) are signiﬁcant for radical and well as for incremental innovation , but not for the intermedi - ate category ( INNFIRM ) . The size of the ﬁrm only seems to matter for the two incremental types of innovation ( INNFIRM and INNIMP ) , with larger ﬁrms having greater sales of new products as com - pared to smaller ﬁrms . For radical innovation , the size of the ﬁrm appears to have no bearing on its innovative performance . This ﬁnding is consistent with the ﬁndings from previous studies ( see Cohen , 1995 ; Laursen and Foss , 2003 ) . Whether or not the ﬁrm is a start - up has no positive inﬂuence on inno - vative performance , no matter whether or not this is conditional on the R & D intensity of the ﬁrm . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Firms are increasingly drawing in knowledge from external sources in their innovative activities . Mod - ern innovation processes require ﬁrms to master highly speciﬁc knowledge about different users , technologies , and markets . To deepen our under - standing about how ﬁrms draw knowledge from external sources , the present study examined the role of external search strategies in shaping inno - vative performance . In order to do so , we sought to extend conceptual understanding of innovative search processes . In particular , we introduced two new concepts— external search breadth and exter - nal search depth —to describe the character of a ﬁrm’s strategies for accessing knowledge from sources outside of the ﬁrm . We have argued that ﬁrms who are more open to external sources or search channels are more likely to have a higher level of innovative performance . Openness to external sources allows ﬁrms to draw in ideas from outsiders to deepen the pool of technologi - cal opportunities available to them . As Chesbrough suggests , ﬁrms that are too internally focused may miss opportunities , as many knowledge sources necessary to achieve innovation can only be found outside the ﬁrm . The lack of openness of ﬁrms to their external environment may reﬂect an orga - nizational myopia , indicating that managers may overemphasize internal sources and under empha - size external sources . Indeed , the results strongly suggest that searching widely and deeply across a variety of search channels can provide ideas and resources that help ﬁrms gain and exploit innova - tive opportunities . Innovation search is , however , not costless . It can be time consuming , expensive , and laborious . Although we use a different approach , we con - ﬁrm Katila and Ahuja’s ﬁnding that ‘over - search’ may indeed hinder innovation performance . It appears that there are moments or tipping points after which openness—in terms of breadth and depth—can negatively affect innovative perfor - mance . The possibility of over - search helps to create a more nuanced view of the role of open - ness , search , and interaction . The optimistic view of search ascribed great importance to openness of ﬁrms to external sources in the development of new innovative opportunities . Our research sup - ports this view , but it suggests that the enthusiasm for openness needs to be tempered by an under - standing of the costs of such search efforts . It suggests external sources need to be managed care - fully so that search efforts are not dissipated across too many search channels . To gain further insight into the role of external search on innovative performance , we examined the importance of external search breadth and depth for different types of innovation . We found that external search depth is associated with radical innovation . In early stages of the product life cycle when the state of technology is in ﬂux , innovative ﬁrms need to draw deeply from a small number of key sources of innovation , such as lead users , component suppliers , or universities . In these early stages , only a few actors may have knowledge of the key technologies underlying the evolution of the product . Innovators need to cling to these sources , drawing deeply from their knowledge and experience . As the technology and market mature and the network supporting innovation expands , more and more actors inside the innovation system retain specialist knowledge . In order to access the variety of knowledge sources in these networks , innovative ﬁrms need to scan across a wide number of search channels . In doing so , they seek to ﬁnd new combinations of existing technologies to enable them to make signiﬁcant improvements in their existing products . To examine the relationship between the open - ness to external search activities and internal R & D , we interacted the measures of openness with R & D intensity . Our results indicate the existence of a substitution effect between the two activities . Accordingly , we have provided empirical content Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) Open for Innovation 147 to the often cited , but seldom - quantiﬁed , NIH syn - drome ( however , see Chesbrough and Tucci , 2004 , in a different context ) . Limitations and future research The analysis of large - scale databases ( such as the U . K . innovation survey ) poses many questions that cannot be investigated without more direct obser - vational research methods . As Katila suggests , much greater knowledge is needed about how ﬁrms organize their search for external ideas for innova - tion . Most of the literature on search is based on indirect data and infers relationships from data and existing theoretical models . Yet the empirical base underlying these models is relatively slight and it would be extremely useful to develop a number of studies of how different organizations organize their search processes . In - depth case studies and observational research may allow for a more full description of how ﬁrms become trapped in the position of under - or over - search . New strategies for drawing in external knowledge , such as Proc - tor & Gamble’s connect and develop , appear to provide promising approaches for enhancing inno - vative performance . As pointed out earlier in this paper , a limita - tion of the framework proposed here is that it does not allow for the analysis of the importance of breadth and depth of external search to innova - tive performance within each individual knowl - edge channel . Future research should examine this issue by developing several ﬁne - grained items for each of the knowledge sources . A further limita - tion of the present paper has to do with the fact that we have focused on the distinction between incremental and radical innovations only . For this reason , it remains unclear how the complexity of an innovation shapes the way ﬁrms search for new innovation opportunities . Past research sug - gests that ﬁrms producing simple or discrete tech - nologies that are artefactually simple , that is , they involve relatively few components and clear inter - faces between modules , or that rely on a small number of knowledge bases , will tend to search more narrowly than ﬁrms involved in the design and development of complex technologies ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . Complex technologies , such as aeroengines , often require ﬁrms to master a wide number of different knowledge bases and to under - stand the interfaces and integration of a range of different components ( Brusoni , Prencipe , and Pavitt , 2001 ) . Also , the literature on architectural innovation suggests that changes in the integration and interfaces between modules may require ﬁrms to change their search strategies given that their past search activities are ill suited to understand - ing the new product architecture ( Henderson and Clark , 1990 ) . Future research on the relationship between innovative search and complexity could yield a new understanding of the cognitive and managerial challenges of organizational responses to signiﬁcant technological change . Another future research challenge is to under - stand changes in innovative search over time . Our approach focuses on innovative search and per - formance in one period and this remains a severe limitation of the study . However , with future inno - vation surveys , it will be possible to examine whether the search behavior of innovative ﬁrms has changed over time as suggested by Ches - brough . It may be too early to determine whether ‘open innovation’ represents a new model of the innovation process or whether it simply reﬂects a transitional strategy by a small number of rela - tively large U . S . - based ﬁrms . Indeed , it would be interesting to explore whether changes in the tech - nology base of industries are reﬂected by changes in the search patterns of individual ﬁrms . It is possible to imagine that ﬁrms who are able to alter their search strategies to respond to major changes will exhibit better performance than ﬁrms who maintain the same search strategy over the same period . It may be that the ability of the ﬁrm to reconﬁgure its search strategies over time as a result of changes in the external environment is the key managerial challenge faced by ‘open innova - tors . ’ Until greater research is undertaken on the nature of search over time , the full implications of the movement towards ‘open innovation’ will not be fully understood . While the present study examined different external search strategies for innovative ideas across different knowledge sources , it did not investigate the role of the type and nature of the technological trajectory that a ﬁrm may be exploring ( as in the case of Katila and Ahuja ) and how its approach to this trajectory may inﬂuence its innovative performance . Future studies should relate external search across knowledge sources to internal technological search within different technological trajectories . In this context , Fleming and Sorenson’s ( 2001 ) attempt to classify patent citations by different sources—such as academic Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 27 : 131 – 150 ( 2006 ) 148 K . Laursen and A . Salter papers—may be a proﬁtable starting point . Such research may allow for the integration of research on the external search strategies among different knowledge sources and search within different technological trajectories .
