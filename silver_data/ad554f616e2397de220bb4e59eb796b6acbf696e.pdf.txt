Upon ligand - mediated activation , GR translocates to the nucleus , and regulates gene expression related to metabolism , acute - phase response and innate immune response . GR ﬁ eld of research has evolved considerably in the last decades , providing varied mechanisms that contributed to the understanding of transcriptional regulation and also impacted drug design for treating in ﬂ ammatory diseases . Liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) in cellular processes represents a recent topic in biology that conceptualizes membraneless organelles and microenvironments that promote , or inhibit , chemical reactions and interactions of protein or nucleic acids . The formation of these molecular condensates has been implicated in gene expression control , and recent evidence shows that GR and other steroid receptors can nucleate phase separation ( PS ) . Here we brie ﬂ y review the varied mechanisms of transcriptional control by GR , which are largely studied in the context of in ﬂ ammation , and further present how PS can be involved in the control of gene expression . Lastly , we consider how the reported advances on LLPS during transcription control , specially for steroid hormone receptors , could impact the different modalities of GR action on gene expression , adding a new plausible molecular event in glucocorticoid signal transduction .

TYPE Mini Review PUBLISHED 14 April 2023 DOI 10 . 3389 / fendo . 2023 . 1160238 cortex that regulate metabolism and immune responses . Potent anti - in ﬂ ammatory responses are mediated through the GC receptor ( GR ) ( 1 – 3 ) . While GRs mediate crucial homeostatic control in higher vertebrates , the fact that therapeutic GR agonists are employed as potent anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs cannot be neglected , for instance Dexamethasone played a signi ﬁ cant role in the treatment of COVID - 19 critical patients worldwide . GR activation by steroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs limit key cytokines production , including IL - 1 b , TNF - a and IL - 6 ( 4 – 12 ) . GCs are cell membrane permeable and bind to GR in the cytosol , leading to nuclear translocation of the ligand - receptor complex , where GR binds to DNA and nuclear proteins , regulating gene expression ( 7 , 13 , 14 ) . It was recently described that GR , when interacting with chromatin , forms condensates , which might be related to liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) ( 15 , 16 ) . The concept of LLPS has already been studied in the ﬁ eld of biology for some years ( 17 – 21 ) , and it is the main type of phase - separation ( PS ) characterized in cell biology . This thermodynamic process consists of separating into two coexisting liquid phases , one dense ( condensates ) and the other dilute . It is well described that LLPS potentiates intracellular reactions , hijacks molecules or promotes molecular complexes . Recently , this process has been linked to transcriptional control and consequently impacts gene expression ( 22 ) . In the steroid receptor ( SR ) pathways , this proposal has already been analyzed . In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that LLPS is not formed upon deletion of certain domains of these NRs ( 15 , 23 ) . Transcriptional regulation caused by LLPS in GR pathways has not yet been analyzed in depth . Here we review the key elements of GR control on gene expression , which is predominantly studied in an in ﬂ ammatory context , and select information associated with the participation of PS into molecular events that determine transcription control by SRs . Finally , we propose analogous modes of LLPS events that could contribute to the regulation of proin ﬂ ammatory responses through GR . The aim of this short review is to outline the major molecular events that take place during varied modes of GR action on gene expression , and to suggest a place for LLPS in some of these key processes . Glucocorticoid receptors Human GR ( hGR ; of ﬁ cial symbol : NR3C1 ) , such as main isoforms a and b , are part of the NR superfamily comprised by ligand - induced transcription factors that can transrepress ( – ) or transactivate different genes . Prototypical hGR a is composed of multiple domains , which , altogether , determine the concerted varied molecular interactions induced by GC signaling ( Figure 1A ) ( 24 , 25 ) . Once GCs become available in the cytoplasm and interact with GR coupled with HSP70 , HSP90 , p23 and FKBP51 , profound changes in the protein complex promote the exposure of the two nuclear localization sequences present in GR . This enables GR translocation to the nucleus , which was thought to migrate in its dissociated form , but recent evidence suggests that the chaperone complex is necessary for ef ﬁ cient translocation [ reviewed in ( 13 ) ] . In this compartment , canonical GR activity on gene expression through DNA binding is mediated by the formation of a GR homodimer ( GR + GR ) , although tetrameric binding has also been suggested ( 26 ) ( Figure 1B ) . After binding to GRE sites , GR act as a transcription factor ( TF ) and recruits primary cofactors . In consequence , p160 superfamily member steroid receptor coactivator - 1 [ SRC - 1 ; a . k . a . nuclear receptor coactivator - 1 ( NCOA1 ) ] coordinates the clustering of secondary coactivators NCOA2 and p300 . Their counterparts , cAMP - responsive element - binding protein ( CREB ) - binding protein ( CBP ) , and CBP / p300 associated factor ( pCAF ) are recruited , playing signi ﬁ cant roles in chromatin remodeling , transcriptional initiation complex recruitment and RNA polymerase II activation . Examples of canonical simple GRE transcribed genes through GR homodimer binding that downregulate in ﬂ ammation include : ANXA1 ( Lipocortin I ) , NFKBIA ( I k B a ) , DUSP1 ( MKP - 1 ) , TSC22D3 ( GILZ ) , and ZFP36 ( TPP ) . Coactivators recruited by GR dimers ( e . g . , p300 / CBP ) are also coactivators of TFs of pro - in ﬂ ammatory pathways such as nuclear factor ( NF ) - k B and activator protein ( AP ) - 1 . Thus , a second modulation mechanism attributed to GR would be to compete for the recruitment of coactivators , leading to lower expression of genes associated with these other TFs ( 27 – 32 ) . The contribution of these mechanisms to GCs anti - in ﬂ ammatory actions is signi ﬁ cant , but often outshined by direct interference with NF - k B and AP - 1 transcription factors . From the perspective of mechanisms of repression / inhibition of gene expression , initial evidence indicated that GR binds to negative GREs ( nGREs ) sequences , which are inverted repeat sequences where GR monomers are arranged in a head - to - tail orientation ( 4 , 33 ) ( Figure 1B ) . These nGREs , which have been found in several metabolic and in ﬂ ammatory gene promoters ( e . g . IL6 , IL20 , STAT3 ) , recruit nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCOR1 ) and NCOR2 that inhibit transcription ( 4 , 7 , 27 , 33 , 34 ) . Interestingly , nGRE sites were not con ﬁ rmed by DNA footprinting in IL6 promoter , for instance , and are not well characterized for this gene repression by the GR agonist Dexamethasone ( 30 , 35 , 36 ) . Conversely , GR can also bind to regions of DNA called “ composite sites ” that comprise both GRE and responsive elements to other TFs , and in consequence , GR interferes with these TFs . In another alternative model that explains repression , GR form protein - protein interactions with TFs ( tethering ) , as demonstrated for NF - k B , AP - 1 , and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) , ultimately reducing proin ﬂ ammatory genes expression . Both mechanisms , in speci ﬁ c contexts , can generate inhibition or increase in the expression of certain genes ( Figure 1B ) ( 10 , 33 , 36 – 40 ) . Popularized as a repression mechanism independent of DNA - binding , the classical model of tethering has been revisited , as recent experiments with cell lines have shown that GR recognize cryptic GRE sites within , or near , AP - 1 or NF - k B response elements ( TREs or k BRE ) , leading to modulation of the transactivation activity of these TFs ( 41 ) . In summary , profound differences in GR modes of action will be achieved by multimeric , dimeric or monomeric forms , depending on the gene and GR binding sites ( 26 , 42 ) . The physiological role of monomeric GR has been discussed for a while and little is known about its exact functioning . While discussions and evidence of a predominant role are emerging ( 43 ) , Pinheiro et al . 10 . 3389 / fendo . 2023 . 1160238 Frontiers in Endocrinology frontiersin . org 02 others have reported that monomeric GR binds weakly to chromatin and thus cannot activate or repress genes ( 44 ) , pointing out that , in vivo , the GR structure is predominantly dimeric . The dimerization state may present cell - speci ﬁ c characteristics , and may present different oligomerization states depending on the origin of the stimulus , endogenous or exogenous ( 45 ) . For a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and roles of GR , we suggest dedicated reviews ( 7 , 13 , 46 ) . The interactions described above , which are involved in the different mechanisms mediated by GRs , can promote PS events that may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression associated with GCs . Phase separation The relevance of PS for understanding signal transduction relies on a higher level of molecular interaction and function control . Also known as coacervation , PS is a spontaneous and reversible process in which intracellular molecules , such as proteins and nucleic acids , begin to interact more with each other than with the surrounding environment , forming membraneless organelles [ e . g . , stress granules , processing bodies ( P - bodies ) , Cajal bodies , and nucleolus ] ( 47 – 51 ) . This is often caused by the increase in the local concentration of these molecules above a critical point , and by physical changes in the cells , such as changes in temperature or pH . When certain molecules exceed their concentration threshold , it becomes thermodynamically more favorable for them to unite and interact with each other , de - mixing until the free energy of the medium stabilizes ( 52 ) . Thus , biomolecular condensates are products of this physicochemical phenomenon , and consequently , promote local changes on key molecules availability , or interfere with the stability of molecular complexes that relay or block effector signals . Most intracellular condensates are composed of proteins that have stretches of low - complexity sequences , called intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) . These regions are formed by polar and charged amino acids residues , such as glycines , serines , prolines , lysines and arginines ( 53 , 54 ) , and , interspersedly , have aromatic residues such as tyrosine and phenylalanine . Thus , these sequences allow proteins to make weak bonds , such as pi - pi , cation - pi , dipole - dipole or cation - anion ( 55 ) , which are some of the interactions responsible for allowing the PS of protein - RNA complexes , even in a system where entropy tends to favor homogeneity ( Figure 2A ) . Post - translational modi ﬁ cations ( 57 , 58 ) , binding interactions ( 59 – 62 ) and environmental conditions ( 63 – 65 ) regulate interactions between the proteins and other macromolecules in the condensate . Regarding their conformation , condensates could vary according to their composition , types of interactions and the surrounding environment , and they may appear as droplets ( liquid ) , colloids ( gel - like ) , ﬁ bers or crystals ( solid ) ( 66 – 68 ) . LLPS rapidly emerged as a proposed model for the formation of membraneless organelles ( biomolecular condensates ) , however , a word of caution is necessary because it has been argued that many studies super ﬁ cially analyzed whether this paradigm applies for in vivo conditions , where other drivers of macromolecular concentration A B FIGURE 1 GR overview .

Nevertheless , LLPS predominates as the proposed process where molecules interact with each other through multivalent interactions promoted by IDRs , generating condensates that have liquid - like structural characteristics , such as spherical structure , high fusion power by contact and dynamism ( 47 , 71 ) , and because they are highly dynamic , there is a constant exchange of molecules between the condensate and its envelope . However , even though they are classi ﬁ ed as similar , condensates will differ from their surrounding system , as LLPS products are highly viscous and have their own surface tension , resulting in dense droplets capable of melting ( 21 , 47 ) . Due to the high concentration of molecules inside , biomolecular condensates are related to the potentiation of intracellular reactions , such as bonds between molecules and catalysis of reactions in consequence of the concentration of enzymes and substrates . For instance , as it occurs in the carboxylation of the RuBP protein ( ribulose bi - phosphate ) by the enzyme Rubisco ( RuBP carboxylase / oxygenase ) in the carbon ﬁ xation process of photosynthesis ( 72 , 73 ) , or in the process of pathogen DNA recognition by cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( GMP ) - adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) synthase ( cGAS ) through binding , causing increased intracellular cGAMP levels and innate immunity activation ( 74 ) . Condensates may also act in the suppression of some pathways , as in RNA granules , where there is an increase in mRNA deadenylation ( 75 ) . Furthermore , recent studies associate the condensates formed from LLPS to transcriptional control , promoting the activation or repression of speci ﬁ c genes ( 16 , 76 ) . To explain the process of transcriptional regulation in which PS is involved , we ﬁ rst need to look at the keystone of this process : TFs .

Pinheiro et al . 10 . 3389 / fendo . 2023 . 1160238 Frontiers in Endocrinology frontiersin . org 04 DBDs allow the recognition of enhancers or promoter sequences , and IDRs present in TFs will promote the nucleation of these complexes / condensates , generating regions of foci ( 77 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Due to the surface tension generated from the nucleation of these condensates , these regions will reciprocally recognize each other and coalesce , promoting the recruitment of the Mediator complex ( which mediates the communication between transcriptional activators and the transcriptional machinery ) and RNA pol II . Therefore , this DNA - protein interaction de ﬁ nes the so - called transcriptional condensate , or initiation condensate ( 78 – 87 ) . By transitioning from the initiation phase to the elongation phase , RNA pol II will have its C - terminal domain ( CTD ) phosphorylated by cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) 7 and CDK9 , allowing it to separate from the initiation condensate and begin to interact with elongation factors ( EFs ) and with a pre - mRNA , undergoing a new PS ( 78 , 81 , 83 ) ( Figure 2B ) . Subsequently , P - TEFb ( positive transcription elongation factor b ) will enter the new condensate , promoting CTD hyperphosphorylation of RNA pol II , accelerating transcription elongation . The now hyperphosphorylated RNA pol II will interact with factors present in RNA splicing regions , and as the concentration of new mRNA molecules increases , the splicing condensate breaks down and RNA pol II returns to the initiation condensate ( 88 ) , [ reviewed in ( 22 , 52 ) ] . Altogether , transcription machinery is highly dependent on LLPS events that orchestrate the molecular dynamics involved in gene expression at chromatin level . A closing thought for this subject is the idea that LLPS can promote a nuclear domain where TFs can easily ﬁ nd their binding sites in DNA or other proteins . For instance , Wagh et al . discuss that TFs search for DNA binding sites and random encounters would be very ineffective , a situation improved by molecular con ﬁ nement in condensates . LLPS can ef ﬁ ciently connect enhancers and promoters and recruit the transcriptional machinery ( 52 ) . Complementary , nuclear condensates may also repress gene expression ( next section ) . Phase separation associated with other steroid receptors ( AR , ER , MR and PR ) A growing number of proteins involved in transcription were reported to perform LLPS , such as Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) , transcriptional co - activator with PDZ - binding motif ( TAZ ) , TP53 and b - catenin , which are proteins associated with TFs functions involved in cell - cycle , proliferation or differentiation ( 87 , 89 , 90 ) . Remarkably , some SRs , such as androgen receptor ( AR ) , estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) were also identi ﬁ ed as susceptible to PS in the context of transcriptional regulation ( 15 , 23 , 52 , 56 , 78 , 82 , 91 – 101 ) . This process can happen through the protagonism of different domains according to each speci ﬁ c SR , even though there is considerable similarity between these NRs , both in terms of structure and physico - chemical propensy to LLPS formation ( 56 ) . These domains can be considered more relevant when their inhibition / ablation impairs LLPS formation , or redundant if their inhibition can only prevent LLPS in the absence of another domain ( 56 , 97 ) . Like GR , the majority of other SRs need IDRs to stabilize the interaction with co - regulators of this process , such as Med - 1 , p300 / CBP , PCAF , and NCOA1 ( 92 , 97 , 102 ) . This fact points to a common , and probably conserved , mechanism of LLPS that is critical for some of SRs functions as transcriptional regulatory molecules . Although the majority of studies suggests that ER is a receptor that forms liquid condensate related to transcriptional regulation ( 52 , 82 , 98 , 99 ) , still a minority of others point out that most of the ER pool would not be related to the transcriptional function of the receptor ( 103 ) . Likewise , GR foci was presented to be possibly non - transcriptional by a study published in 1995 ; however , subsequent studies indicated a plausible role of GR foci in GR ’ s transcriptional regulation ( 15 , 23 , 56 , 104 , 105 ) . Similarly , condensates modulated by AR are described as active transcriptional regions that depend on AR ’ s multi - domain , a marked feature of GR LLPS and other transcription factors . The splice variant AR - v7 that lacks LBD and is incapable of forming foci reveals that this domain mediates critical interaction in AR - mediated LLPS ( 93 , 106 ) . Not surprisingly , PS with PR has also been proposed as a molecular event involved in transcriptional regulation , which was corroborated by evidence that PR dimers act as important functional units , similarly to what happens with GR ( 100 ) . Notably , the promotion of GR LLPS has a domain - dependent pro ﬁ le , comparable to AR , as observed in a robust study performed by Stortz and collaborators ( 15 ) . A fundamental domain is LBD , since its removal generates a noticeable decrease in GR foci formation , conversely , the absence of NTD only leads to an alteration of its stability , possibly due to the presence of IDRs in this region . It ’ s important to underscore that the induced monomeric structure of GR generates less foci density , and that constitutively tetrameric mutant - GR has an improved potential of forming condensates in comparison to both , monomeric and dimeric forms , indicating that there ’ s a dependency on quaternary structures in order to lead to a more effective foci formation . Ultimately , the similarity between the formation of these SRs ’ condensates point out to a common function of these NRs ’ LLPS in active transcriptional sites . Possible implications of GR - mediated phase separation Since GR - LLPS has been reported only recently , experimental data is still lacking in order to determine how condensates are implicated in the different GR actions . Some of the evidence that makes plausible a GR - LLPS contribution to transcriptional regulation is the DNA - dependence on GR foci formation . In addition , GR condensates retain the ability to bind sequence speci ﬁ c DNA , as demonstrated by GRE - DNA probes recruitment to GR / TIF2 foci along with the presence of coactivators ( 15 , 23 , 104 , 105 ) . NCOA2 condensate ( a . k . a . TIF2 ) , containing p300 and PCAF , has been reported to be co - localized with GR condensate at its target sites ( 104 , 105 ) . In addition , the co - localization of GR condensates Pinheiro et al . 10 . 3389 / fendo . 2023 . 1160238 Frontiers in Endocrinology frontiersin . org 05 with Med - 1 corroborates the suggestion that GR LLPS is involved in transcriptional regulation ( 15 , 23 ) . Thus far , the relationship between GR and Pol - II has been questioned due to partial colocalization evidence . Nevertheless , recent studies involving GR LLPS have indicated that there may be a transcriptional relationship between these two molecules , a subject that still needs clari ﬁ cation ( 23 , 56 ) . Altogether , the similarity between GR and other SRs , as well as NCOA2 and Med - 1 participation in the generation of GR condensate , strongly suggest that GR LLPS is involved in transcriptional regulation ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , composite sites and nGREs are two interaction mechanisms of GR that have been recently described to improve the intensity of GR condensates in vitro associated with its co - regulator ( i . e . , G9a ) when compared to canonical GRE sites . In contrast , greater increase in GR - Med - 1 condensates ’ intensity is a feature of presence of GREs ( 23 ) . While much has been understood concerning GR LLPS involving GRE sites , the other mechanisms of GR interaction still lack information related to PS ( Figure 2C ) . Taking to account the function of GR in respect of in ﬂ ammatory regulation , it is inevitable to question whether there is a relation between condensates of GR - homodimers and coactivators with GREs that promote the transcription of anti - in ﬂ ammatory genes ( e . g . , I k B a / NFKBIA , GILZ / TSC22D3 , MKP - 1 / DUSP1 ) , and if this process would be optimized by the formation of GR condensate . Nevertheless , this question requires a great set of studies in order to be slightly more elucidated , especially towards gene expression . Concluding remarks and future directions GR regulates the expression of metabolic and proin ﬂ ammatory genes through multiple mechanisms that take place in the nucleus . After binding to DNA , GR have the ability to nucleate LLPS through IDRs present in GR and its molecular partners , forming condensates that coalesce , resulting in a large DNA - protein complex . These events seem to be required for transcription of GR - dependent genes , and some of these genes promote downregulation of proin ﬂ ammatory signaling pathways . GR condensates are also predicted to repress transcription . Although this repression may be inapplicable to hamper pro - in ﬂ ammatory gene expression regulated by GR , it could be a relevant target for curbing GCs side - effects . Knowledge in this ﬁ eld will depend not only on mechanistic studies involving LLPS and transcription of GCs - responsive genes , including those related to in ﬂ ammation , but also on new experimental settings that overcome the limitations of nucleus imaging and cell - free systems that only suggest liquid - like properties of manipulated condensates .
