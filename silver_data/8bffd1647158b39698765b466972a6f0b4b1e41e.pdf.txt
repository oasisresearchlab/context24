Introduction Sepsis , an uncontrolled host inflammatory response to infection with the presence of organ dysfunction , is still the main cause of death in noncoronary intensive care units , with a mortality rate as high as 30 % – 50 % ( 1 ) . Although the specific molecular pattern of sepsis is unclear , it is widely accepted that dysregulation of the host response and consecutive defects in homeostasis are critical in the progress of sepsis ( 2 ) . The concept of hyperinflammatory syndrome , which has dominated septic pathology over the past 2 decades , is currently challenged ( 3 ) . Clinical trials have demonstrated that the therapeutic outcome of using substances to inhibit inflammation is disappointing ( 4 ) . Recently , a new definition for sepsis and septic shock named sepsis - 3 has eliminated the concept of systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) ( 1 ) . On the other hand , the inci - dence of sepsis is increasing in the aging population that have impaired immunity due to immunosenescence ( 5 ) . Indeed , most septic patients manifest significant immunosuppression or immunoparalysis , as represented by an impaired activation of immune responses and hypoinflammation ( 6 ) , which may contribute directly or indirectly to the inability of individuals to ward off the lethal effects of septic challenge ( 7 ) . Of all the sepsis - responsive cells , macrophages play a critical role in promotion of the innate immune response and initiation of the adaptive immune response ( 8 ) , and depletion of macrophages in septic mice increases mortality ( 9 ) . However , macrophages isolated from a late - phase septic individual exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype ( 10 ) . Typically , phagocytic impairment within the innate immune response of macrophages is an important contributor to septic dysfunction ( 11 , 12 ) . Moreover , T cells , which are crucial regulators of macrophage function , are profoundly lost and dysfunctional in sepsis , making the sus - tained hyperactivation of macrophages difficult ( 3 ) . Therefore , understanding the mechanisms contributing to immunosuppressive or hyporesponsive characteristics of macrophages during sepsis is important . Swiprosin - 1 , also known as EF hand domain - containing protein D2 ( EFhd2 ) , was first identified in human lymphocytes , predominantly in CD8 + T lymphocytes ( 13 ) , and was later identified in imma - ture resting or activated B cells ( 14 , 15 ) and in nonlymphoid tissues ( 16 , 17 ) . The high expression of Despite the fact that many therapeutic strategies have been adopted to delay the development of sepsis , sepsis remains one of the leading causes of death in noncoronary intensive care units . Recently , sepsis - 3 was defined as life - threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection . Here , we report that swiprosin - 1 ( also known as EFhd2 ) plays an important role in the macrophage immune response to LPS - induced or cecal ligation and puncture – induced ( CLP - induced ) sepsis in mice . Swiprosin - 1 depletion causes higher mortality , more severe organ dysfunction , restrained macrophage recruitment in the lung and kidney , and attenuated inflammatory cytokine production ( including IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , TNF - α , IL - 10 , and IFN - γ ) . The immunosuppression caused by swiprosin - 1 deficiency is manifested by impaired bactericidal capacity and decreased HLA - DR expression in macrophages . Swiprosin - 1 affects the activation of the JAK2 / STAT1 / STAT3 pathway by regulating the expression of IFN - γ receptors in macrophages . Our findings provide a potential target for the regulation of the macrophage immune response in sepsis . 2 insight . jci . org https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1172 / jci . insight . 95396 R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E swiprosin - 1 in T cells and its participation in BCR - induced apoptosis in immature B cells suggests that swiprosin - 1 may be involved in the regulation of the immune response ( 15 ) . Meanwhile , swi - prosin - 1 modulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL - 3 and IL - 8 ) in mast cells , and an increased expression of swiprosin - 1 is also found in the model tissues of passive cutaneous - anaphy - laxis and atopic dermatitis ( 18 ) . However , the expression and function of swiprosin - 1 in macrophages are largely unknown . Here , we found that swiprosin - 1 was abundantly expressed in macrophages and responded to LPS challenge . More importantly , we observed that more swiprosin - 1 – KO mice died of LPS - induced sepsis . Based on these findings , we hypothesized that swiprosin - 1 participated in the pathogenesis of sepsis by regulating the immune response of macrophages . In our study , we used swiprosin - 1 – deficient mice and an LPS - and CLP - induced septic model to identify the effect of swiprosin - 1 in experimental sepsis . Consequently , we assessed systemic and local inflammation , the immune state , tissue injury , macrophage recruitment , and the activation of relative signaling pathways . Finally , we discussed the possible mechanism of swiprosin - 1 in regulating the mac - rophage immune response . Results Swiprosin - 1 deficiency leads to increased mortality associated with the phenotypes of immunosuppression in LPS - and CLP - induced sepsis . Mortality increased in swiprosin - 1 – KO mice treated with an i . p . injection of a lethal dose of LPS ( 40 mg / kg ) compared with that in WT mice ( Figure 1A ) . Although there was no significant difference in the serum levels of IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - α between the KO and WT mice , the concentrations of these proinflammatory factors were significantly decreased in the KO mice compared with the WT mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 1B ) . Meanwhile , the higher septic lethality and mild proinflammation response of the KO mice were also verified in another clinically relevant sepsis model induced by CLP ( Figure 1 , C and D ) . Given that IL - 10 can negatively regulate proinflammatory factors upon inflammatory stimulation ( 19 ) , we next examined the production of IL - 10 in the serum of the KO mice . Unexpectedly , IL - 10 levels were also significantly decreased in the KO mice versus WT mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 1E ) . Knowing that macrophages are critical drivers of the innate immune response during infection and inflammation , we used clodronate liposomes ( CLOPs ) to deplete macrophages in C57BL / 6J mice . Twenty - four hours after an i . v . injection of CLOPs ( 0 . 1 ml / 10 g ) , 87 % of the splenic macrophages were depleted , which confirmed the efficiency of macrophage deprivation ( Supplemental Figure 1A ; sup - plemental material available online with this article ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1172 / jci . insight . 95396DS1 ) . To examine the importance of macrophages in LPS - induced sepsis , 3 × 10 7 peritoneal macrophages were returned to the macrophage - depleted mice before the i . p . LPS treatment . Compared with the 75 % survival rate of the control mice , the macrophage - deprived mice all died within 30 hours , whereas 25 % of the macrophage - complement mice survived at 4 days ( Supplemental Figure 1B ) . Subsequently , the macrophages isolated from KO and WT mice were returned to macrophage - deprived mice . Although all the mice in these 2 groups died , the survival time in the KO group was significantly shorter than that in the WT group ( Figure 1F ) . As impaired bacterial clearance is a significant manifestation of sepsis - induced immune dysfunction , we assessed whether swiprosin - 1 deletion affected the bactericidal ability of septic mice . More bacterial burden was observed in the blood of KO mice than in that of WT mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 1G ) . Similar - ly , more bacterial burden was also found in the blood and peritoneal lavage fluid in KO mice than in those of WT mice after CLP ( Figure 1H ) . These data suggest that swiprosin - 1 deletion – increased septic death may be due to immune deficiency rather than an inflammatory factor storm . Swiprosin - 1 deficiency aggravates lung and kidney injuries in septic mice . Since sepsis - induced death is associated with severe organ dysfunction , we subsequently examined the pathological changes in the lungs and kidneys of septic mice . After LPS stimulation , inflammatory cell infiltration , edema , hem - orrhage , and alveolar septal thickening were observed , while inflammatory cell infiltration and hemor - rhage were more severe in KO mice ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . The lung wet / dry ( W / D ) weight ratio in the KO mice was higher than that in the WT mice after i . p . LPS , which also demonstrated that pulmonary edema was more severe in the KO mice ( Figure 2C ) . Similarly , more severe lung lesions were also observed in the KO mice after CLP ( Figure 2 , D – F ) . Unexpectedly , the levels of IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - α in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) were significantly decreased in the KO mice compared with the WT mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 2G ) . 3 insight . jci . org https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1172 / jci . insight . 95396 R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Subsequently , a kidney histological examination showed that the septic mice demonstrated excessive inflammatory cell infiltration , RBC trapping , glomerular congestion , and loss of proximal tubular brush border after i . p . LPS . Furthermore , glomerular congestion was more severe in KO mice than in WT mice ( Figure 3 , A and B ) . Moreover , the blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and creatinine ( Cr ) levels in the KO mice were higher than those in the WT mice after i . p . LPS , which demonstrated that the KO mice exhibited more severe renal damage ( Figure 3C ) . Similarly , the kidney lesions were more severe ( Figure 3 , D and E ) and the Cr level was higher in the KO mice after CLP ( Figure 3F ) . Conversely , the concentrations of IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - α in the kidney homogenates were significantly decreased in the KO mice compared with the WT mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 3G ) . Swiprosin - 1 deficiency restrains macrophage recruitment and inflammatory factor production . Monocyte / mac - rophage infiltration is one of the most important factors leading to excessive inflammation . Next , we assessed whether swiprosin - 1 affected macrophage recruitment in the target tissues of septic mice . There was less F4 / 80 + macrophage recruitment in the lungs and kidneys of the KO mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 4A ) or CLP ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . A decreased percentage of F4 / 80 + CD11b + macrophages in the peritoneal lavage fluid or spleen was also observed in the KO mice after i . p . LPS ( Figure 4B ) . Further , we confirmed that the restrained macrophage recruitment was due to inhibited cell migration rather than impaired cell viability ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . Knowing that macrophages are an important source of inflammatory factors , we assessed whether swiprosin - 1 affected cytokine production in vitro . The mRNA and protein expressions of swiprosin - 1 in the macrophages were increased in a time - dependent manner after LPS treatment ( Figure 4C ) . Subse - quently , the mRNA ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) and protein ( Figure 4D ) levels of IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - α were significantly decreased in the supernatant of peritoneal macrophages isolated from the KO mice after Figure 1 . Swiprosin - 1 – KO mice exhibited higher mortality and immunosuppression after LPS - and CLP - induced sepsis . ( A ) Survival curves after i . p .

IL - 10 levels also significantly decreased in the supernatant of peri - toneal macrophages isolated from the KO mice after LPS treatment ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) , which was consistent with the result in vivo , indicating that the decreased production of proinflammatory factors was not due to IL - 10 . Hence , we postulated that swiprosin - 1 per se participated in the expression of proinflam - matory cytokines . Stable clones with swiprosin - 1 overexpression ( OE ) and GFP control RAW264 . 7 cells were treated with LPS . The concentrations of IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - α were significantly increased in the swiprosin - 1 OE RAW264 . 7 cells ( Figure 4E ) . These results indicated that swiprosin - 1 plays a critical role in modulating proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages . Swiprosin - 1 deficiency inhibits the IFN - γ / JAK2 / STAT1 / STAT3 pathway in LPS - stimulated macrophages . NF - κ B , MAPKs , and JAK / STAT are recognized as the 3 main inflammatory signaling pathways in mac - rophages , and the activation of these pathways plays a key role in regulating the production of proinflam - matory mediators ( 20 ) . Here , we found that the NF - κ B ( phosphorylation of I κ B α , IKK α / β , and p65 ) and MAPKs ( phosphorylation of p38 , JNK , and ERK ) pathways were both activated regardless of the presence or absence of swiprosin - 1 ( Supplemental Figure 6 ) . However , the activation of the JAK / STAT pathway ( phosphorylation of JAK2 , STAT1 , and STAT3 ) was significantly decreased in the swiprosin - 1 KO macro - phages compared with the WT macrophages after LPS treatment ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , OE of swipros - in - 1 remarkably augmented the phosphorylation of JAK2 , STAT1 , and STAT3 ( Figure 5B ) . Since IFN - γ is an important activator of the JAK / STAT pathway , we further examined IFN - γ production in septic mice . Compared with the WT mice , there was less IFN - γ production in the serum of the KO mice after LPS treat - ment ( Figure 5C ) . Although macrophages are not the main cells releasing IFN - γ , they can produce autocrine IFN - γ . We therefore detected the level of IFN - γ produced by macrophages . Similarly , IFN - γ production and gene expression were significantly decreased in the KO macrophages after the LPS treatment ( Supplemental Figure 7A ) . Moreover , given that IFN - γ is mainly released by T cells , we also observed IFN - γ production in the T cells isolated from the KO mice . The IFN - γ concentration was also significantly lower in the KO T cells after LPS treatment ( Supplemental Figure 7B ) . In contrast , swiprosin - 1 had no effect on the mRNA expression of LPS pattern recognition receptors TLR4 / CD14 ( Supplemental Figure 8 ) . Figure 2 .

Administration of IFN - γ ( 50 ng / ml ) eliminated the decreased expression of IL - 1 β in KO macrophages compared with WT macrophages with or without LPS ( Figure 5D ) . However , IL - 6 levels were still significantly decreased in the KO macrophages under IFN - γ stimulation combined with LPS ( Figure 5D ) . Moreover , the TNF - α level was still lower in the KO macrophages after IFN - γ treat - ment with or without LPS ( Figure 5D ) . Then , we assessed the activation of the JAK / STAT pathway after IFN - γ treatment . Neither IFN - γ alone nor LPS plus IFN - γ could eliminate the insufficient acti - vation of JAK2 / STAT1 / STAT3 due to the absence of swiprosin - 1 ( Figure 6A ) . These results suggest that IFN - γ could not effectively recover the swiprosin - 1 deletion – induced decrease in proinflammatory response in macrophages . As IFN - γ activates the JAK / STAT pathway by binding to the IFN - γ receptor ( IFN - γ R ) , we further examined whether swiprosin - 1 deletion affects IFN - γ R expression . The results showed that LPS significantly upregulated IFN - γ R α and IFN - γ R β , while the upregulation of IFN - γ R in KO macrophages was significantly lower than that in WT macrophages ( Figure 6B ) . Nevertheless , the coimmunoprecipitation result showed that the IFN - γ R α did not directly interact with swiprosin - 1 ( Figure 6C ) . Furthermore , human macrophage THP - 1 cell showed an upregulation of swiprosin - 1 under LPS treatment ( Supplemental Figure 9A ) . In addition , knockdown of swiprosin - 1 in THP - 1 cells using siRNA reduced the levels of IL - 6 and TNF - α in the supernatant after LPS treatment ( Supplemental Figure 9B ) . Furthermore , the activation of the JAK / STAT pathway was also reduced in siRNA - treated THP - 1 cells ( Supplemental Figure 9C ) . These results further confirmed the role of swiprosin - 1 in regulating human mac - rophages’ response to LPS . Swiprosin - 1 deficiency impairs the LPS - induced immune response . Sepsis is accompanied by an immunosup - pressive response , and IFN - γ plays an important role in initiating and modulating macrophage immune Figure 3 .

Although sepsis is accompanied by an inflammatory storm , the clinical outcomes from many antiinflammatory agents for sepsis therapy indicate that cytokine levels are poorly correlated with mortality ( 22 ) . Our study showed that swiprosin - 1 deficiency increased sepsis - associated mortality and decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines . Interesting - ly , a similar phenomenon was also seen in Park7 – / – mice and Stat2 – / – mice . In Park7 – / – mice , the increased mortality was mainly associated with aggravated lung injury and immunosuppression , along with the impaired bactericidal ability of macrophages ( 23 ) . Here , we also found that swiprosin - 1 deletion caused severe lung and kidney injury and immune paralysis , including impaired bacterial clearance and decreased HLA - DR in the macrophages . Hence , we still observed the expression of Park7 in the macrophages isolat - ed from swiprosin - 1 – / – mice , whereas no difference was found in the control ( Z . Wang , unpublished obser - vations ) . In Stat2 – / – mice , the mortality increased , and the inflammatory response decreased , both of which were associated with hepatitis , peritonitis , and inflammatory cell extravasation ( 24 ) . We mentioned above that swiprosin - 1 deletion affected the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 activated by type II IFN ( IFN - γ ) . However , STAT2 is an essential transcription factor in type I IFN – mediated antiviral and antipro - liferative signaling ( 25 ) . Therefore , the association between swiprosin - 1 and STAT2 was not discussed here . Swiprosin - 1 has been reported to affect cell migration by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton ( 26 – 28 ) . Our results showed that swiprosin - 1 deletion restrained macrophage recruitment , which partly explained the attenuated proinflammatory cytokine production in the local tissues . In vitro , decreased proinflamma - tory factors caused by swiprosin - 1 deletion reflected the impaired response of macrophage to LPS stim - ulation . Similarly , Munoz reported that LPS - stimulated macrophages from septic patients had profound decreases in the production of TNF - α , IL - 1 β , and IL - 6 ( 29 ) . However , the immune state of swiprosin - 1 – KO mice was not exactly the same as that in the immunosuppressive phase of septic patients and animals . Here , Figure 5 .

By contrast , the antiinflammatory response in the late stage of sepsis , which yields immu - noparalysis , typically involves the production of IL - 10 ( 30 ) . Further , we confirmed that swiprosin - 1 directly participated in cytokine production through a JAK / STAT – dependent pathway . More recently , accumulating evidence indicates that immune paralysis appears at the early stage of sepsis , and this stage seems to be responsible for macrophage activation and inflammatory cyto - kine production ( 31 ) . A low expression of HLA - DR in monocytes is an important symbol of impaired monocyte function , including insufficient TNF - α and IL - 1 β release in response to pathogens ( 32 , 33 ) . Furthermore , low monocyte HLA - DR expression is related to an increased risk of nosocomial infec - tions and death ( 34 , 35 ) . Here , decreased HLA - DR α expression and impaired bactericidal ability in LPS - stimulated KO macrophages indicated a potential immunosuppression status , which might impair the ability of macrophages against invading pathogens and result in death . IFN - γ , a potent macrophage activator , has been reported to produce encouraging results in septic patients with decreased mono - cyte HLA - DR expression and reduced amounts of TNF - α after LPS stimulation ( 36 ) . In our work , we demonstrated that swiprosin - 1 deletion decreased IFN - γ production , which might subsequently impair macrophage activation , suggesting that swiprosin - 1 might act as a potential regulator of the macro - phage immune response activated by IFN - γ . Furthermore , characteristics of immune paralysis were observed in our sepsis model of swiprosin - 1 – KO mice , suggesting that it might serve as an ideal animal model for studying the immunosuppression of sepsis . The JAK / STAT signaling pathway regulates numerous processes , such as cell proliferation , dif - ferentiation , migration , and survival . IFN - γ activates the JAK / STAT signaling pathway by binding to IFN - γ R . Our study revealed that swiprosin - 1 deletion attenuated LPS - induced IFN - γ R expression . IFN - γ R consists of 2 heterodimeric subunits , IFN - γ R α ( ligand binding subunit ) and IFN - γ R β ( sig - nal - transducing subunit ) . IFN - γ R α partly colocalizes with the ganglioside GM1 , a marker of lipid - rafts ( 37 ) . The IFN - γ R complex is located within the intact lipid raft microdomain and controls its signal transduction . The depletion or sequestration of cholesterol from the disrupted plasma membrane rafts not only affects the IFN - γ – inducible phosphorylation of STAT1 , but also disturbs transcriptional sig - naling ( 38 ) . Swiprosin - 1 is identified as a potentially novel lipid raft involved in the detergent - resistant membrane – regulated ( DRM - regulated ) transduction of BCR signals ( 14 , 39 ) . Swiprosin - 1 deletion attenuated IFN - γ R expression and inhibited JAK / STAT signaling , which might be correlated with the Figure 6 . Swiprosin - 1 deficiency attenuates the expression of IFN - γ R in LPS - treated peritoneal macrophages .

However , our conjecture remains to be further confirmed . In summary , our study demonstrated that swiprosin - 1 plays an important role in the macrophage immune response to LPS - and CLP - induced sepsis . Swiprosin - 1 depletion caused higher mortality and more severe tissue injuries , restrained macrophage recruitment in the lung and kidney , and attenuated inflam - matory cytokine production . The immunosuppression caused by swiprosin - 1 deficiency was manifested by decreased bactericidal capacity and reduced HLA - DR expression in the macrophages . In addition , swipros - in - 1 affected the activation of JAK2 / STAT1 / STAT3 pathway by regulating the expression of IFN - γ R . We speculate that this may be due to the regulation of lipid rafts by swiprosin - 1 , which needs further study . Methods Supplemental Methods are available online with this article . Materials .

Swiprosin - 1 – KO mice were con - structed by Tong - Hui Ma ( Dalian Medical University , Dalian , China ) and Wei - Heng Su ( Jilin University , Jilin , China ) . Chemicals were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co . Animals . Male C57BL / 6J mice ( 18 – 22 g ) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co . The swiprosin - 1 – KO mice were generated as described previously ( 40 ) . All mice were kept under an auto - mated 12 - hour dark - light cycle at a controlled temperature of 22°C ± 2°C and a relative humidity of 50 % – 60 % with free access to standard dry diet and tap water ( Shanghai Puluteng Biological Technology Co . ) . Sepsis model . Sepsis was induced by a single i . p . injection of LPS ( 40 mg / kg ) or CLP , as described pre - viously ( 41 ) . The mice were completely anesthetized with 0 . 75 % pentobarbital solution ( 10 μ g / g ) , and a midline abdominal incision was performed . The ileocecal valve was ligated on the distal 3 / 4 of the cecum . The cecum was perforated with 2 holes by a through - and - through puncture with a 21 - gauge needle in a sterile environment , and a droplet of feces was extruded from holes to induce polymicrobial peritonitis . The abdominal wall was sutured in 2 layers and injected s . c . with 1 ml of a 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution for fluid resuscitation . The animals in the sham group underwent laparotomy and bowel manipulation without ligation and perforation . All mice had free access to food and water after recovery from anesthesia . Measurement of bacterial burden . Twelve hours after i . p . injection of LPS ( 40 mg / kg ) or 18 hours after CLP , the mice were sacrificed to collect blood samples and peritoneal fluid . The diluted specimens were plated onto an LB agar plate and were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours . The results are presented as CFU / ml . Tissue injury study . Mice were sacrificed 6 hours after i . p . LPS ( 40 mg / kg ) or 18 hours after CLP . The wet weight of the whole lung was measured , and the lung was then desiccated at 65°C for 72 hours to deter - mine the dry weight . BUN and Cr were measured on a HITACHI 7600 - 120 system ( HITACHI ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The tissues were cut into 5 - μ m sections and H & E stained . The histolog - ical characteristics of the lung injury — including alveolar edema and hemorrhage , the number of infiltrat - ing leukocytes , and the thickness of the alveolar wall and epithelium — were evaluated . Kidney injury was observed with respect to excessive inflammatory cell infiltration , RBC trapping , glomerular congestion , and loss of the proximal tubular brush border . Each histological characteristic was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 3 ( 0 , normal ; 1 , mild ; 2 , moderate ; 3 , severe ) . Generation of stable clones of the swiprosin - 1 OE - RAW cell line . Swiprosin - 1 - OE lentiviruses were produced as described previously ( 40 ) .

Mice splenocytes were suspended in RPMI medium containing 10 % FBS and were then applied to a nylon fiber column ( Polysciences ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , scrubbed nylon fibers were placed into a 30 - ml syringe and were then autoclaved for sterility . The columns were equilibrated with 30 ml of RPMI culture media , sealed , and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . The spleens were removed , ground through a 70 - μ m cell strainer , washed with HBSS , and treated with RBC lysis buffer . A total of 1 × 10 8 cells were resuspended in 3 ml of warm RPMI and loaded onto the column . The column was sealed and incubated at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for 1 hour . Then , the cells were eluted with 10 ml of warm RPMI . Preparation of the peritoneal macrophages . The peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the mice after i . p . injection of 3 ml of 3 % thioglycolate as described previously ( 42 ) . Briefly , the mice were sacrificed , and the macrophages were isolated by lavage with 5 ml of RPMI ( Gibco ) , washed twice with PBS after 3 hours of adherence , cultured in RPMI at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 , and finally stimulated with 1 μ g / ml LPS to harvest the whole cell lysates and supernatants .
