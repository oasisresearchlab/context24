INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 47 : 1034 - 1042 , 2015 1034 Abstract . Cortactin is upregulated in various cancers including breast cancer , head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer . However , the role of cortactin in the pathogen - esis of colon cancer remains unclear . mRNA expression of cortactin in colon cancer samples and cell lines was detected by quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) , while protein expression of cortactin in colon cancer tissues and adjacent non - cancer tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry . The role of cortactin in regulation of the proliferation of colon cancer derived cells were investigated both in vitro and in vivo . In the total of 60 paired colon cancer specimens , compared with the adjacent non - cancer tissues , the expression of cortactin mRNA was upregulated in 45 ( 75 . 0 % ) . Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly increased cortactin expression in colon cancer ( 42 / 60 , 70 . 0 % ) compared to control tissues ( 18 / 60 , 30 . 0 % ) . Overexpression of cortactin promoted HCT116 cellular colony formation and tumor growth . Conversely , cortactin knockdown inhibited these effects in SW480 cells . Mechanistic analyses indicated that cortactin was able to acti - vate the EGFR - ERK signaling pathway . Additionally , cortactin expression was associated with tumor size , tumor stages and lymphatic invasion , increased cortactin expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer . In summary , cortactin demonstrated the promotive effect in human colon cancer cell growth and tumorigenicity . These results indicated that cortactin may serve as an effective target for gene therapy . Introduction Colon cancer is the most common gastrointestinal cancer worldwide , with the incidence increasing in most countries over the past 20 years ( 1 ) . Colon cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage , leading to a poor prognosis ( 2 - 5 ) . As the current clinical procedures utilized for disease diagnosis are invasive , unpleasant , and inconvenient , the development of simple blood tests that can be used for early detection would be beneficial for ultimately controlling and preventing colon cancer ( 2 , 4 , 5 ) . Serum tumor markers , such as carcinoembry - onic antigen ( CEA ) and carbohydrate antigen 199 ( CA19 - 9 ) , greatly improve diagnosis . However , their application is limited to surveillance postsurgery , and they are not suitable for the early detection of colon cancer , as their sensitivity and specificity are very low ( 6 - 8 ) . Therefore , it is vital to identify new clues to understand the pathogenesis of colon cancer and to explore effective therapeutic strategies . Cortactin protein was first identified in chicken cells trans - formed by the src oncogene . Human cortactin , encoded by the CTTN / EMS1 gene , is a v - Src substrate localized with cortical actin at the plasma membrane ( 9 ) , cortactin is enriched in cortical structures such as membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , and plays key roles in the microfilament - membrane interac - tions as well in transducing signals from the cell surface to the cytoskeleton ( 10 , 11 ) . Cortactin overexpression results from the 11q11 . 3 chromosomal region amplification in various cancers , such as head and neck squamous carcinoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , breast and bladder cancer , and correlates with poor patient prognosis and decreased survival ( 12 - 15 ) . Clark et al demonstrated that cortactin expression levels in HNSCC cells correlate with the formation of invadopodia and associated with the invasive potential of tumor cells ( 16 ) . In addition , Wei et al revealed that cortactin overexpression promoted EGFR expression and confers a more malignant phenotype to gastric cancer cells ( 17 ) . Despite the many previous studies that were carried out , cotactin expression in colon cncer is still not completely known . Therefore , the present study examined the role of cortactin in colon cancer development , and our results indi - cated that cortactin is markedly upregulated in colon cancer and can significantly promote colon cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo . These data may suggest that cortactin acts as a promoter of colon cancer cell growth and may constitute a potential therapeutic target in colon cancer . Materials and methods Tissue specimens .

Cell lysates were prepared using cold lysis buffer containing 25 mmol / l Tris - Cl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 5 mmol / l EDTA , 1 % SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma , USA ) . After boiling for 5 min , samples were subjected to electropho - resis in 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane , and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5 % blocking buffer . The membranes were washed three times with 0 . 1 % Tris - buffered saline with Tween - 20 ( TBST ) and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4˚C . The membranes were washed again and then incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h . Primary antibodies used in this study included : rabbit anti - cortactin polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - EGFR polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - ERK polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - pERK polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 500 ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - cyclin D1 polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ) and rabbit anti - β - actin polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ) . Proteins were detected using an ECL Western blotting detection system ( Pierce ) by enhanced chemiluminescence . Patient follow - up . The total of 60 patients underwent resec - tion of colon cancer with curative intent at the Department of General Surgery , Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University between March 2009 and February 2010 . Curative resection was considered as complete resection of tumor mass , with the tumor margins free , and resection of the regional lymph nodes . Patients with distant metastasis were eliminated from this study . The patients were followed from March 2010 to February 2015 . The detailed clinicopathological characteris - tics of the 60 patients with colon cancer are listed in Table I . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18 . 0 and Graphpad Prism 5 . 0 software . Quantitative data were recorded as mean ± SD . Differences between two groups were assessed by Student ' s t - test ( two - tailed ) . Categorical data were evaluated by the χ 2 test . Survival rates were assessed by the Kaplan - Meier method . The log - rank test was used to compare significance . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results Cortactin expression in colon cancer tissues and colon cancer cell lines . Quantitative real - time PCR was performed to measure the cortactin mRNA expression levels in colon cancer and adjacent non - cancerous tissues from 60 patients . The results indicated that cortactin mRNA was increased in 45 ( 75 % ) of 60 colon cancer specimens compared with the matched normal colon tissues ( Fig . 1A ) . We performed immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) to evaluate cortactin protein expression in colon cancer specimens and paired normal colon tissues in the same 60 matched samples . Of these specimens , 42 / 60 ( 70 . 0 % ) of cancerous specimens showed positive staining , whereas 18 / 60 ( 30 . 0 % ) of normal colon tissues showed positive staining ( Fig . 1C ) . Furthermore , we evaluated the expression of cortactin in 6 colon cancer cell lines using quantitative real - time PCR . Cortactin mRNA was significantly increased in all colon cancer derived cell lines ( HCT116 , HT29 , DLD1 , LS180 , SW480 and SW620 ) compared with normal human colon epithelial cells ( NCM460 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . In summary , the collective data showed that cortactin is increased in colon cancer . Correlation of cortactin expression with the patient clinico - pathological features . To investigate whether the increased expression of cortactin was associated with the clinicopatho - logical features such as age , gender , depth , tumor size , tumor stages and lymphatic invasion , we classified the patients into two groups on the basis of our qRT - PCR results for cortactin : weak expression ( - ) and strong expression ( + ) . As shown in Table I , those patients with tumor size ( ≥3 cm ) had a signifi - Table I . Expression of cortactin in human colon cancer according to clinicopathological features of patients .

NI et al : CORTACTIN PROMOTES COLON CANCER PROGRESSION 1037 cantly higher expression of cortactin compared with those patients with tumor size ( < 3 cm ) . In addition , in stages Ⅲ / Ⅳ , expression of cortactin was dramatically higher than stages Ⅰ / Ⅱ . Furthermore , lymphatic invasion was significantly corre - lated with a strong cortactin expression , whereas no significant difference was observed in terms of the patient age , gender and tumor depth . In summary , cortactin functions as an oncogene accelerator in colon cancer . Increased expression of cortactin predicts poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer . Out of the 60 cases , there were 52 patients with definite follow - ups . A total of 34 patients died , of whom 23 showed strong expression of cortactin , 11 showed weak expression of cortactin . The 5 - year OS rates of patients with strong cortactin expression were 16 . 9 % , which were lower than those of patients with weak cortactin expression ( 51 . 1 % ) ( Fig . 1D ) . Overexpression of cortactin promotes proliferation and colony formation in HCT116 cells . To overexpress cortactin , the recombinant pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin was transfected into the HCT116 cells . We performed western blotting to evaluate cortactin protein expression in HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin 48 h post - transfection . Cortactin protein expression in pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin transfected cell was significantly higher than in pcDNA1 . 1B transfected cell ( Fig . 2A ) . To investigate the promotive effects in pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin transfected cell , cellular growth was monitored for 5 days . The pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin transfected HCT116 cells showed a significant increase in cellular growth compared with pcDNA1 . 1B transfected cells ( Fig . 2B ) . HCT116 cells with upregulated cortactin expression were subjected to colony formation assay . As shown in Fig . 2C , overexpression of cortactin in HCT116 cells resulted in significant promotion of colony formation as compared with HCT116 cells transfected Figure 1 .

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 47 : 1034 - 1042 , 2015 1038 with pcDNA1 . 1B , and the majority of clones were larger than those of control cells . We then used a soft agar assay for colony formation , which is the most stringent assay for detecting the proliferative ability of cells . We observed enhanced forma - tion of colonies in soft agar ( Fig . 2D ) that had been seeded with HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin compared with pcDNA1 . 1B transfected cells . Knockdown of cortactin inhibits proliferation and colony formation in SW480 cell line . To knockdown cortactin , the recombinant p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin was transfected into SW480 cells . Western blot analyses were performed to assess the efficiency of cortactin knockdown in SW480 cells trans - fected with p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin 48 h post - transfection . Cortactin protein expression in p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin transfected cells was significantly lower than that in sh - NC transfected cells ( Fig . 3A ) . The p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin transfected SW480 cells showed significant suppression of cellular growth compared with sh - NC transfected cells ( Fig . 3B ) . SW480 cells with downregulated cortactin expres - sion were subjected to colony formation assay . As shown in Fig . 3C , decreased expression of cortactin in SW480 cells resulted in significant suppression of colony formation as compared with cells transfected with sh - NC . We also observed inhibited formation of colonies in soft agar ( Fig . 3D ) when seeded with SW480 cells transfected with p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin compared with sh - NC transfected cells .

NI et al : CORTACTIN PROMOTES COLON CANCER PROGRESSION 1039 on the tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells in vivo were also evaluated . HCT116 cells overexpressing cortactin and SW480 with downregulated cortactin expression were injected subcutaneously into BALB / c nude mice ( 500x10 6 cells / mouse , 4 mice in each experimental group ) . Tumor size was measured every third day after injection . After 3 weeks , mice were sacrificed and photographed , and the tumors were removed and weighed . In comparison with the mice injected with HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA1 . 1B , the mice injected with HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin displayed larger tumors during the same time period , and the average tumor volumes and weights were significantly higher than those in the control group ( Fig . 4A , C and E ) . Compared with the mice injected with SW480 cells transfected with p - SUPER - sh - NC , the mice injected with SW480 cells trans - fected with p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin showed an obvious decreased capacity for tumorigenesis ( Fig . 4B , D and F ) . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that cortactin acts as an promotor of tumor cell growth and tumorigenicity in vivo . Differential expression of cortactin influences the EGFR - ERK signaling pathway related proteins . To study the mechanism by which cortactin enhances the growth of colon cancer , the EGFR , ERK , p - ERK , cyclin D1 protein levels were detected by western blotting . As shown in Fig . 5 , the levels of EGFR , p - ERK and cyclin D1 were increased in the pcDNA1 . 1B - cortactin transfected HCT116 cells compared with the pcDNA1 . 1B transfected HCT116 cells , and no difference in the tERK protein levels were observed between the two cell groups . The levels of EGFR , p - ERK , cyclin D1 were decreased in the p - SUPER - shRNA - cortactin transfected SW480 cells compared with the sh - NC transfected SW480 cells . Similarly , the expression of tERK was not different between the cell Figure 3 . Knockdown of cortactin inhibits proliferation and colony formation .

These results indicate that cortactin overexpression enhances the EGFR expression and in turn constitutively activates the EGFR - ERK signaling pathway . Discussion Recurrence and metastasis remain the major causes of treat - ment failure and poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer , and it is a multistage process that involves the motility and migration of cells and proliferation in a new site ( 18 ) . Cortactin is a multidomain protein consisting of an NH2 - terminal acidic region , which binds the actin related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex , a repeat region , which associates with filamentous actin , and a COOH - terminal src homology ( SH ) 3 domain , which recruits a variety of cellular proteins ( 19 ) . One cellular role for cortactin is to bridge the endocytic machinery with components and regulators of the actin cytoskeleton ( 20 ) . This interaction has recently been shown to participate in receptor - mediated endo - cytosis ( 20 - 22 ) . The gene encoding cortactin , EMS1 , localizes to chromosomal locus 11q13 , a region commonly amplified in breast cancers and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( 23 , 24 ) . Since cortactin overexpression increases the motility of fibroblasts and endothelial cells ( 25 , 26 ) , enhances bone metastasis of MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells in a nude mouse model ( 27 ) and promotes gastric cancer cell SGC - 7901 proliferation ( 17 ) . In the present study , we first determined the expression of cortactin in colon cancer , and further investigated its role in colon cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo . EGFR is frequently implicated in cancer cell proliferation , inhibition of apoptosis and tumor - induced neovascularization via the activation of downstream signaling pathways . EGFR is often overexpressed in various types of tumors , such as salivary gland carcinomas , non - small cell lung cancer , biliary tract cancer , and gastric cancer ( 28 - 32 ) . One of the most frequent targets downstream of EGFR and other receptor tyro - sine kinases is the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) kinase signal transduction pathway . This pathway is involved in proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , and angiogenesis ( 33 ) . It is constitutively active in a variety of solid tumor models , including lung , pancreas , and breast ( 33 ) . Elevated levels of activated ERK are frequently seen in carcinoma cell lines ( 34 , 35 ) . Activation of the ERK pathway regulates the activity of a number of substrates through phosphorylation ( 36 ) . In this study , we first determined the expression of EGFR and ERK in colon cancer cells , it revealed that cortactin enhances EGFR expression and ERK phosphorylation . Sustained ERK activity can upregulate cyclin D1 expression . In conclusion , our findings show that cortactin is signifi - cantly upregulated in colon cancer , while ectopic cortactin expression promotes cell proliferation , colony formation , soft agar colony formation and tumorigenicity . Further investigation revealed that cortactin stimulates the EGFR - ERK signaling pathway . This study is the first to discover that cortactin expression plays an important role in colon cancer progression , but further studies are required to identify the detailed interac - tion between cortactin and EGFR - ERK signaling pathway in colon cancer , and whether cortactin could act as a therapeutic agent for colon cancer patients should be investigated .
