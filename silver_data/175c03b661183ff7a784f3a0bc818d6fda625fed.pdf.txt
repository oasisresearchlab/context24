Korn , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , and approved January 31 , 2006 ( received for review September 21 , 2005 ) The cellular cytoskeleton is a complex dynamical network that constantly remodels as cells divide and move . This reorganization process occurs not only at the cell membrane , but also in the cell interior ( bulk ) . During locomotion , regulated actin assembly near the plasma membrane produces lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia . There - fore , most in vitro experiments explore phenomena taking place in the vicinity of a surface . To understand how the molecular ma - chinery of a cell self - organizes in a more general way , we studied bulk polymerization of actin in the presence of actin - related protein 2 (cid:1) 3 complex and a nucleation promoting factor as a model for actin assembly in the cell interior separate from membranes . Bulk polymerization of actin in the presence of the verprolin homology , coﬁlin homology , and acidic region , domain of Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein , and actin - related protein 2 (cid:1) 3 complex results in spontaneous formation of diffuse aster - like structures . In the presence of fascin these asters transition into stars with bundles of actin ﬁlaments growing from the surface , similar to star - like structures recently observed in vivo . The transition from asters to stars depends on the ratio [ fascin ] (cid:1) [ G actin ] . The polarity of the actin ﬁlaments during the transition is preserved , as in the transition from lamellipodia to ﬁlopodia . Capping protein inhibits star formation . Based on these experiments and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations , we propose a model for the spontaneous self - assembly of asters and their transition into stars . This mechanism may apply to the transition from lamellipodia to ﬁlopodia in vivo . actin self - assembly (cid:2) asters (cid:2) cellular protrusions (cid:2) Monte Carlo simulations (cid:2) stars D uring cellular migration , regulated actin assembly takes place at the plasma membrane ( 1 – 3 ) , with continuous disassembly deeper in the cell interior . The site - directed actin polymerization at the plasma membrane results in the extension of cellular protrusions in the form of lamellipodia and filopodia . Although most cultured animal cells assemble both lamellipodia and filopodia , some cells , like keratocytes , emphasize lamelli - podia , whereas dendritic cells are dominated by filopodia . One open question is how does a cell ‘‘choose’’ between the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia and what dictates the preference of one structure over the other . For that , it is essential to under - stand the self - assembly of these actin - based structures and the factors controlling these processes . Although protrusions of lamellipodia and filopodia are tightly coupled to actin polymerization , the distinct organization and generation of filaments in each structure uses a different mech - anism to produce mechanical force . In the lamellipodia , the actin filaments organize into a flat 2D branched network ( 2 , 4 ) , whereas bundles of parallel actin filaments support filopodia ( 5 ) . In the lamellipodia , the branched nucleation is driven by acti - vation of the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 6 ) by the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein family ( 7 – 8 ) , followed by filament elongation and barbed - end capping by capping protein ( CP ) ( 9 ) . Formin and Ena (cid:1) vasodilator - stimulated phosphopro - tein proteins concentrated at the tips of filopodia ( 3 , 5 , 10 ) are believed to protect the barbed ends of the filaments from capping and thus to enable persistent filament elongation ( 3 , 11 ) . Competition between branching , capping , and bundling rates governs the type of protrusion . These rates are expected to be regulated by the local abundance of certain regulatory proteins including Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , CP , and bundling proteins such as fascin ( 12 ) . Biomimetic systems provide a simplified controlled environ - ment for characterizing the role of constituent proteins and identifying the fundamental physical principles underlying cel - lular motility . Most in vitro experiments explore phenomena in the vicinity of surfaces ( 13 – 18 ) . To understand how the nano machinery of a cell self - organizes in a more general way , we studied self - assembly in a bulk sample of purified proteins isolated from the influence of cell membranes . The reconstituted medium contained the major proteins participating in the as - sembly of lamellipodia and filopodia : ( i ) the constitutively active verprolin homology , cofilin homology , and acidic region ( VCA ) ( 16 ) ( or WA 6 ) domain of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein , which activates Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ; ( ii ) Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ; ( iii ) heterodimeric CP , which blocks the barbed ends of actin fila - ments ; and ( iv ) fascin , which crosslinks actin filaments of the same polarity into bundles in filopodia . This biomimetic system enabled us to control the concentrations of the various proteins and observe the time course of self - assembly by light microscopy . We studied the formation and maturation of various mesoscopic structures , particularly asters and stars , similar to those recently observed in vivo ( 11 ) . Results Arp2 (cid:1) 3 Complex Controls Self - Organization of Asters . First , we ex - plored the role of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex on the dynamical self - assembly of actin in bulk . When activated by VCA , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex induces the spontaneous self - assembly of actin into diffuse 3D aster - like structures ( Fig . 1 a and b ) . Asters formed over a wide range of concentrations of actin ( 0 . 52 – 7 . 28 (cid:1) M ) , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 20 – 200 nM ) , and VCA ( 40 – 850 nM ) . Fully grown asters appeared in (cid:1) 2 min after initiating a reaction with 100 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , 200 nM VCA , and 7 . 28 (cid:1) M actin monomers . This time is similar to the time required for actin polymerization as measured by biochemical assays ( 6 ) , therefore nucleation of highly branched microstructures by Arp2 (cid:1) 3 com - plex and their reorganization into asters occurs simultaneously . We studied the effect of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex on the number of asters formed per unit area within the 1 - (cid:1) M section of the bulk sample that we observed . The density of asters , (cid:1) (cid:2) , was evaluated by measuring the characteristic distance between two asters (cid:3) , where (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) 2 .

The density (cid:1) (cid:2) increases monotonically ( roughly linearly ) with x ( data not shown ) , implying that the number of asters generated per unit area depends linearly on [ Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ] , for a constant actin concentration . Fig . 1 d shows the intensity fluorescence profile I ( r ) along an aster . The intensity decreases monotonically and symmetrically from the aster’s center toward its periphery , reflecting the decreasing density of actin filaments . The next section discusses this behavior of the density profile and the polarity of the growing filaments along the growing aster . Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy , we followed the evolution of asters close to a glass surface , where we could observe the formation of individual asters and filament branches over time ( Fig . 2 a ) . These experiments were conducted at low concentrations of actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , 1 (cid:1) M and 10 nM , respectively , along with 200 nM activator . Asters first appeared as fluorescent points , which subsequently grew by elongation and formation of branches ( 6 ) ( Fig . 2 a ) . On average , filaments grow with their barbed ends facing outward from the aster center , as can be assessed by analyzing the growth direction of the branches . The branch marked by an arrow in Fig . 2 a grows away from the aster’s center . The angle between this branch and its mother filament is (cid:5) 70° , typical to an Arp2 (cid:1) 3 branching angle ( 6 ) . In Fig . 2 b we can clearly observe an aster with the branches ( marked in red ) pointing outward , reflecting the tendency of barbed ends to grow outward . Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulation of Aster Formation . Fig . 3 shows 2D projections of 3D snapshots from a kinetic Monte Carlo simu - lation of actin aster growth in the presence of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . In these simulations the aster evolves from a nucleus consisting of a single actin filament . After several generations of branching mediated by Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , the aster is a roughly spherical globule of some radius r 0 , which may be referred to as the aster’s core . We shall refer to the filaments emanating from this core as ‘‘primary’’ filaments . As time evolves , filaments elongate and branch , resulting in structures similar to those observed exper - imentally ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The calculated volume fraction , (cid:2) , occupied by polymerized actin after all actin monomer has been consumed and cluster growth was completed ( Fig . 3 f Lower ) is similar to the fluores - cence profile in Fig . 1 d . The farthest regions of the aster can be reached only by primary filaments , whose barbed ends point radially , and possibly also by a few , newly born branches . Because branching takes place along all , old and new filaments , the actin density is maximal in the oldest regions of the aster , i . e . , near and around its core , and gradually decreases toward its periphery . The polarity of the growing filaments can be expressed by the ‘‘orientational order parameter’’ (cid:4) ( r ) (cid:4) (cid:6) cos (cid:5) (cid:7) . The averaging here is over all filament branches originating at r , with (cid:5) denoting the angle between the filament direction and the radius vector connecting the aster’s center and the filament’s origin ( i . e . , its pointed end ) . Consistent with the qualitative analysis above , Fig . 3 f shows that as r increases , the actin density (cid:2) ( r ) decreases , whereas (cid:4) ( r ) increases monotonically , as discussed in more detail below . At any moment during an aster’s growth , the tips ( i . e . , the barbed ends ) of the primary filaments reached the farthest distance , r * , from the core’s center . There are no pointed ends Fig . 1 . Confocalimagesofasters . Conditionswereactinmonomer ( 3 . 78 (cid:1) M ) , GST - VCA ( 50nM ) , andArp2 (cid:1) 3complex ( 25nM ) .

Mostlikely , verysmall spontaneously nucleated seeds act as nucleation points from which Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex rapidly forms branches autocatalytically . The initial seeds are smaller than the optical resolution and thus appear as points at the center of the aster . Formation of a new branch ( (cid:5) 70° is characteristic to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 branching ) marked by a white arrow in the two last frames shows that the actin ﬁlaments barbed ends ( (cid:8) ) point outward . ( b ) An image of the aster part that is close to the coverslip surface clearly shows branches pointing away from the aster center , three of them are marked in red . The growth direction is thus from the pointed ( (cid:3) ) end to the barbed ( (cid:8) ) end . Haviv et al . PNAS (cid:2) March 28 , 2006 (cid:2) vol . 103 (cid:2) no . 13 (cid:2) 4907 B I O P H Y S I C S at r * . Slightly inward , however , we find a few ‘‘young’’ first - generation branches ( daughter filaments emerging from the primary filaments ) . On average , these branches are still oriented radially , and the contribution of their pointed ends to (cid:4) ( r ) is about cos ( 70 o ) (cid:5) 0 . 3 . Indeed , the highest - order parameter is at the aster’s periphery , reaching (cid:4) ( r ) (cid:5) 0 . 3 ( Fig . 3 f ) . Further inward , as r decreases , we always find the primary filaments and , in addition , an increasing number of daughter filament gener - ations . The fraction of uncorrelated filament orientations thus that contributes to (cid:4) ( r ) increases as r decreases , resulting in smaller (cid:4) ( r ) . Fig . 3 f shows how the average spacing , d ( in monomer units ) , between adjacent branches on the same mother filament , varies with r ( calculated at the end of an aster’s growth ) . The spacing is calculated as d ( r ) (cid:4) N F ( r ) (cid:1) 2 N P ( r ) , where N F ( r ) is the number of polymerized actin subunits and N P ( r ) is the number of branching points ( or , equivalently , of pointed ends , because all pointed ends in our model emerge as a result of branching events ) within a spherical shell at distance r from the aster’s nucleation center . The factor of 2 arises because each new branch on the side of an existing filament creates one new end but results in two F - actin segments originating at this branch point . As expected , d ( r ) , increases rapidly with r . The simulation is based on a simple kinetic model involving only two rate processes : monomer addition at barbed ends and branching from nonterminal filamentous subunits . We focus here on the structural evolution of single asters , not the process of nucleating multiple asters , or transition of asters to stars . In this simple simulation , actin monomers and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complexes are the only relevant species . The simulation box consists initially of a single polymerization seed ( an actin dimer ) , embedded in a solution containing N G ( 0 ) actin monomers and N Arp ( 0 ) Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complexes . To account for the experimental fact that many asters grow simultaneously in solution , the box volume V is chosen as the average volume per aster , as observed experimen - tally in a system with the initial concentrations (cid:2) G ( 0 ) (cid:4) N G ( 0 ) (cid:1) V and (cid:2) Arp ( 0 ) (cid:4) N Arp ( 0 ) (cid:1) V . This result is equivalent to the assump - tion that each cluster is embedded in a certain volume containing given total numbers of actin monomers and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complexes . For the results shown in Fig . 3 we used the initial concentrations [ actin monomer ] (cid:4) 7 . 47 (cid:1) M and [ Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ] (cid:4) 100 nM and set V (cid:4) 2 , 500 (cid:1) m 3 . In the simulations , actin filaments are modeled as linear rigid polymers composed of flat - cylindrical monomers stacked one on top of another . The monomer diameter is 9 nm , corresponding to the diameter of an actin filament , and its height is set to 2 . 57 nm . Branching can take place from any subunit in a filament except the terminal subunit , unless it is already occupied by a daughter branch . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , forming the nucleus of a new branch , is modeled as an actin dimer , initiating a filament at an angle of 70° with the mother filament . We impose an azimuthal angle difference of n ( 13 (cid:1) 2 (cid:6) (cid:1) 28 ) between a branch originating n monomers away from the first branch along that filament . We explicitly account for excluded volume interactions between actin filaments . To ensure that filaments do not inter - sect each other , we allow actin monomers and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex to add only if the new particle does not intersect an existing filament . Monomeric actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex are assumed to be uniformly distributed in solution , with time - dependent con - centrations (cid:2) G ( t ) and (cid:2) Arp ( t ) . This approximation is justified in view of the slow rates of actin polymerization and branching as compared with monomer diffusion ( 19 , 20 ) . In the simulations the probabilities of polymerization and branching are proportional to the rates of these processes , R pol ( t ) (cid:4) k pol ( t ) (cid:1) N b ( t ) and R br ( t ) (cid:4) k br ( t ) (cid:1) N m ( t ) , respectively , where N b ( t ) and N m ( t ) stand for the numbers of barbed ends and middle ( i . e . , nonterminal ) F - actin monomers available for branching , respectively . Their time rate of change is governed by the kinetic equations dN b (cid:9) t (cid:10) dt (cid:7) k br (cid:9) t (cid:10) (cid:1) N m (cid:9) t (cid:10) dN m (cid:9) t (cid:10) dt (cid:7) (cid:3) k br (cid:9) t (cid:10) (cid:1) N m (cid:9) t (cid:10) (cid:8) k pol (cid:9) t (cid:10) (cid:1) N b (cid:9) t (cid:10) .

The initial concentrations are similar to those used experimentally : 7 . 47 (cid:1) M G actin and 100 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . 4908 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0508269103 Haviv et al . Here k pol ( t ) (cid:4) k pol ( 2 ) (cid:2) G ( t ) and k br ( t ) (cid:4) k˜ br (cid:2) Arp ( t ) (cid:2) G ( t ) 2 are ( pseudo unimolecular ) rate constants for polymerization and branching . More explicitly , k pol ( t ) (cid:4) k pol ( 2 ) (cid:2) G ( t ) , where k pol ( 2 ) is the bimolecular rate constant for actin polymerization at the barbed end . For the branching rate constant we use the commonly accepted form k br ( t ) (cid:4) k˜ br (cid:2) Arp ( t ) (cid:2) G ( t ) 2 , which assumes that branching can occur only after binding of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 with two G - actin monomers ( 21 ) ; k˜ br is the rate constant corresponding to the attachment of this complex to an F - actin monomer . To facilitate the simulations we set k pol ( 0 ) (cid:4) 1 (cid:1) (cid:9) MC and scale all rates relative to this ( largest ) rate constant ; (cid:9) MC denotes the simulation ( Monte Carlo ) time step , i . e . , the average time interval between successive polymerization events at the barbed end , corresponding to the actin monomer concentration at t (cid:4) 0 . Experiments suggest that for the initial concentrations considered here , namely [ actin monomer ] (cid:4) 7 . 47 (cid:1) M and [ Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ] (cid:4) 100 nM , k br ( 0 ) (cid:4) 1 . 05 (cid:11) 10 (cid:3) 4 k pol ( 0 ) 21 . In the simulations we thus set k br ( 0 ) (cid:4) 1 . 05 (cid:11) 10 (cid:3) 4 (cid:9) MC (cid:3) 1 . We do not include depolymerization of barbed ends , because it is slow . We do not include debranching , because it is relatively slow and any dissociated branches will be constrained by the meshwork and continue to grow at their barbed ends . Aster growth ends when all actin monomers are consumed . For the conditions used in our simulations 99 % of actin monomers were consumed after (cid:5) 100 s of growth , similar to the experiments described above . Also , (cid:5) 40 % of the initial Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex remains in solution at the end of aster growth . Star Formation , Role of Fascin , and CP . Inclusion of fascin in a reaction mixture containing actin monomers , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , and VCA resulted in spontaneous self - assembly of actin into structures with radial spokes that we call stars ( Fig . 4 ) . In the early stages of this process the spokes condensed out of a low density cloud of actin surrounding the dense core ( Fig . 4 a ) . Under similar conditions , but without fascin , fully grown asters formed in (cid:1) 2 min , as described above . Stars grew outward from the original aster center , indicating that the polarity is preserved , with the barbed ends pointing outward . We thus conclude that on short time scales actin monomers organize into asters ( the process is too rapid for observation with our current setup ) . Bundles appear only at longer time scales , after the actin filaments have elongated significantly , thus allowing their crosslinking by fascin with only a relatively small bending energy penalty ( 22 ) (cid:10) E (cid:5) 8 k B T ( Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . About 5 min later the cloudy corona turned into a fully developed star ( Fig . 4 b ) ; the diffuse actin cloud disappeared , turning into long actin bundles emanating from the dense Arp2 (cid:1) 3 branched network core . Experiments with fluorescent VCA showed that it was present in the core but not in the star bundles ( data not shown ) , so the concentration of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is likely to be low in bundles relative to the core . Inclusion of CP in the reaction mixture inhibited the gener - ation and growth of bundles ( Fig . 4 c ) . The addition of nM levels of CP to the solution of actin , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , and VCA resulted in the generation of condensed actin asters instead of large diffuse asters ( data not shown ) . Adding nM levels of CP to the solution of actin , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , VCA , and fascin inhibited star growth . Stars still appeared for [ CP ] (cid:4) 15 nM ( data not shown ) but the spokes were shorter than in a system free of CP , where typical bundle lengths were L (cid:5) 10 – 30 (cid:1) m ( Fig . 4 b ) . Upon increasing [ CP ] to 40 nM the stars became even smaller and developed only few short and straight bundles of typical length L (cid:5) 2 (cid:1) m ( Fig . 4 c ) . Inhibition of star growth by CP confirmed that the barbed ends of filaments are at the ends of the spokes ( Fig . 4 c ) . Under the conditions of Fig . 4 c reducing the concen - tration of fascin to 25 % that of actin completely abolished the formation of stars ( data not shown ) . The Role of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 Complex in Star Formation . Polymerization of actin under our standard conditions but without Arp2 (cid:1) 3 com - plex generated an isotropic mesh of entangled filament bundles rather than stars ( Fig . 4 d ) . This fact shows that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 is required for star formation . Polymerization of actin without Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex but with fascin produced long actin filament bundles ( tens of micrometers long , Fig . 4 d ) . In the presence of fascin , branching points of actin bundles were routinely observed ( short white arrows , Fig . 4 d ) . The bundling and splitting process is , of course , not a unique property of single bundles , but also occurred when several bundles were involved ( long white arrow , Fig . 4 d ) . Fig . 4 .

( c ) Addition of 40 nM CP results in inhibition of star formation . The number of stars is decreased and their bundles are shorter ( (cid:5) 2 (cid:1) m ) . ( d ) Stars are not formed in the absence of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ; instead , an entangled network of ﬁlament bundles is observed .

Theinitialaveragegrowthrateofbundles is v (cid:1) (cid:4) 2 . 27 (cid:12) 0 . 80 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min . ( f ) Star pairs also form . Their bundles growth rate is the same as for individual stars . Haviv et al . PNAS (cid:2) March 28 , 2006 (cid:2) vol . 103 (cid:2) no . 13 (cid:2) 4909 B I O P H Y S I C S We performed the quantitative data analysis of star growth at half the concentrations of actin and fascin used in Fig . 4 a and b . Under such conditions , the stars are smaller and overlapping effects between neighboring stars are reduced . At the rapid growth step , which typically lasts up to 5 min ( Fig . 4 e ) , the bundles elongate at an average velocity v (cid:1) (cid:4) 2 . 27 (cid:12) 0 . 80 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min ( 14 subunits per s ) . Elongation would be faster with the initial actin monomer concentration of 3 . 64 (cid:1) M ; however , much of the free actin is consumed during the first step of aster formation . In fact , this velocity is comparable to the growth rate of filopodia in vivo ( 11 , 23 ) . As more actin monomer was consumed , elongation of the bundles slowed and eventually halted . Addition of fresh actin and fascin to the solution re - started the nucleation and growth of new bundles and the elongation of preformed ones ( unpublished results ) . Discussion Polymerization of actin in the presence of activated Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex leads to the self - assembly of asters that transition into stars providing that a crosslinking protein ( fascin in our exper - iments ) is present ( Fig . 5 ) . After the spontaneous nucleation of an actin seed ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complexes bind to short actin filaments , initiating an autocatalytic process of branch formation and filament growth ( Fig . 5 a ) . After a few generations of branching the cluster growth becomes isotropic , resulting in an aster with roughly spherical symmetry . The growth of the network advances with the barbed ends of the peripheral actin filaments ( (cid:8) in Fig . 5 a ) pointing on average outward , as seen in the simulation result of (cid:4) ( r ) ( Fig . 3 f ) . The transition of an aster into a star in the presence of a crosslinking protein is a natural consequence of the growth of the aster . ‘‘Older’’ regions of the aster are denser than ‘‘new’’ regions , so the actin filament density falls with the distance from the center , r ( Fig . 1 d ) and (cid:2) ( r ) ( Fig . 3 f ) . In addition , the separation of neighboring branches [ d ( r ) in Fig . 3 f ] increases with r , resulting in longer filaments at the periphery of the growing aster . Longer , less densely packed filaments bend more easily than short filaments . Therefore , fascin bundles actin filaments in regions remote from the aster core , where the gain in fascin binding energy compensates for the actin filament bending energy penalty . At the end of this process , the star is composed of a more or less isotropic core of dense actin filaments network with short bundles emanating outward from this core ( (cid:8) in Fig . 5 b ) . In the final step of star formation these bundles elongate by continuous actin polymerization while new bundles continue to emerge close to the star core ( Figs . 4 e and 5 c ) . In the course of aster - to - star transition the directionality of actin filaments is maintained , with the barbed ends pointing outward . This finding contrasts with another biomimetic system containing latex beads coated with an Arp2 (cid:1) 3 activator ( 17 ) . In this system the generation of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex – actin network takes place at the bead’s surface with the filaments’ barbed end pointing toward the bead , whereas the addition of fascin resulted in the growth of bundles with their barbed end pointing away from the bead surface . In living cells , on the other hand , barbed ends of actin filaments in both lamellipodia and filopodia point toward the plasma membrane where they polymerize , meaning that the directionality of actin filaments is maintained during the transition from lamellipodia to filopodia . The presence of CP in a solution of actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex resulted in the formation of compact asters of dense branched network . Termination of barbed end elongation by CP results in shorter filaments , preserving the pool of actin monomers to make more branches . Deforming these short , constrained actin filaments requires more energy than bending long filaments ( Supporting Text ) , so fascin induces fewer filament bundles around each of these compact asters ( Fig . 4 c ) . The impact of capping on bundle formation illustrates why persistent elongation is an important factor for the assembly of actin filament bundles in cells . In a network of branched actin filaments nucleated by Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , CP limits filament length , precluding bundling . On the other hand , formins allow persistent growth of barbed ends even in the presence of CP . Formins at the tips of growing filopodia may contribute to the persistent growth of the actin filaments , preventing the CP from blocking their growth ( 24 ) . In cells the number and the length of filopodia were shown to depend on CP levels ( 11 ) and formin expression level ( 24 ) . Our observations in vitro are consistent with the effect of depleting CP from cultured cells ( 11 ) . Depletion of CP resulted in spontaneous reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with loss of the leading edge , redistribution of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex into the cell interior , and explosive formation of filopodia and star - like structures composed of actin filaments . Mejillano et al . ( 11 ) found that the same proteins complex ( Ena (cid:1) vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein (cid:1) formin ) at the bundle tips in filop - odia and stars . In both cases , bundles of actin filaments emerged from branched networks preserving the actin filament polarity during the transition . Thus , in vivo stars and filopodia are very similar except for their symmetry . Filopodia elongate from a more or less planar surface ( i . e . , cell membrane ) , whereas star bundles grow radially from their nucleation center . Fig . 5 . The transition from asters to stars . ( a ) The ﬁrst polymerization step begins by spontaneous nucleation of an actin seed . This step is followed by binding of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complexes to nascent actin ﬁlaments , initiating an autocatalytic process of branch formation and ﬁlament growth . With time growth of the cluster becomes isotropic , resulting in an aster of roughly spherical symmetry . The growth of the network advances with the barbed ends of the actin ﬁlaments ( (cid:8) ) pointing outward . ( b ) The transition of an aster into a star is initiated by the reorganization of the network structure into bundles . The star is now composed of a dense network of actin ﬁlaments with short bundles emanating with their barbed ends pointing outward ( (cid:8) ) from beyond this core . ( c ) In the ﬁnal step of star formation , the bundles elongate by continuous actin polymerization in the outward direction while new bundles continue to emerge close to the star core . During the growth process the density of the star core continues to increase because of the continuous nucleation of new Arp2 (cid:1) 3 - actin branches . 4910 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0508269103 Haviv et al . The stars that self - assemble in vitro highly resemble those generated in vivo ; the star core is composed of a branched network and the filaments in bundles emerging from this core have their barbed ends outward . Lamellipodia are 2D asters with the barbed ends of the filaments directed toward the membrane . If the filaments grow long enough , they can be bundled by crosslinking proteins , spontaneously forming parallel bundles similar to filopodia . Our minimal model system of pure proteins confirms that actin , activated Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , fascin , and CP can mimic complex events at the leading edge of cells . Compared with a cell this system is simple and controlled , making it possible to characterize the roles of a limited set of proteins in the higher - order assembly of actin filaments . The asters and stars in the in vitro system are equilibrium self - assembled structures . This fact is in contrast to the reorganization of asters and vortices by motor proteins ( 25 – 28 ) , which is considered to be an ‘‘active’’ process leading to steady - state structures that depend on ATP hydrolysis to maintain their shape . Materials and Methods Protein Purification . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal mus - cle acetone powder ( 29 ) . Recombinant Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein – VCA ( 16 ) and fascin ( 30 ) were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins . Recombinant mouse CP was purified from E . coli ( 31 ) . Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex was purified from bovine thymus ( 32 ) . Actin labeled on Cys - 374 with Alexa 568 or 488 was purchased from Molecular Probes . Motility Assay . The motility medium contained 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 7 ) , 1 . 7 mM Mg - ATP , 5 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 12 mM 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( an antibleaching reagent ) , 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % BSA , and various concentrations of G actin , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , VCA , CP , and fascin . No vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein was needed . Microscopy . Actin assembly was monitored for (cid:5) 1 h by fluores - cence with an Olympus IX - 71 microscope using intermittent illumination from a mercury lamp . The labeled actin fraction was 1 (cid:1) 26 and the temperature was 22°C . Time - lapse images were acquired by using a Coolsnap HQ camera ( Photometrics , Tuc - son , AZ ) . Data analysis was performed with METAMORPH ( Uni - versal Imaging , Downingtown , PA ) . Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy . We observed actin polymerization , aster generation , and aster growth on the surface of a glass slide with total internal reflection evanescent wave illumination on an Olympus IX70 microscope ( 33 ) . The protein concentrations were 10 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , 200 nM GST - VCA , and 1 (cid:1) M actin with 30 % labeled at Cys - 374 with Oregon green ( 34 ) . We thank A .
