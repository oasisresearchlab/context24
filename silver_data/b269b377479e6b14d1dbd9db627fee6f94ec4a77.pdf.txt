Pontrello and Iryna M . Ethell * Biomedical Sciences Division and Neuroscience program , University of California Riverside , USA Abstract : Dendritic spines are actin - rich structures that accommodate the postsynaptic sites of most excitatory synapses in the brain . Although dendritic spines form and mature as synaptic connections develop , they remain plastic even in the adult brain , where they can rapidly grow , change , or collapse in response to normal physiological changes in synaptic ac - tivity that underlie learning and memory . Pathological stimuli can adversely affect dendritic spine shape and number , and this is seen in neurodegenerative disorders and some forms of mental retardation and autism as well . Many of the molecu - lar signals that control these changes in dendritic spines act through the regulation of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , some through direct interaction with actin , and others via downstream effectors . For example , cortactin , cofilin , and gelsolin are actin - binding proteins that directly regulate actin dynamics in dendritic spines . Activities of these proteins are precisely regulated by intracellular signaling events that control their phosphorylation state and localization . In this review , we dis - cuss how actin - regulating proteins maintain the balance between F - actin assembly and disassembly that is needed to stabi - lize mature dendritic spines , and how changes in their activities may lead to rapid remodeling of dendritic spines . 1 . INTRODUCTION Excitatory postsynaptic sites in the brain are usually formed on dendritic spines , small protrusions on the surface of dendrites that are enriched in actin [ 1 - 5 ] . Dendritic spines form and mature as synaptic connections develop in the brain , and their morphogenesis directly correlates with syn - apse formation and maturation . The most widely - held view of dendritic spine formation suggests that dendritic spines originate from dendritic filopodia - like protrusions both in vitro and in vivo [ 6 - 15 ] . Although mature dendritic spines can also emerge from the dendritic shaft , it is widely ac - cepted that long , thin filopodia - like morphologies are fea - tures of immature pre - cursors to spines , while mature spines are characterized by mushroom - like or stubby shapes [ 16 - 18 ] . Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function [ 19 - 26 ] . While immature thin spines with smaller heads are flexible and can rapidly enlarge or shrink in response to changes in synaptic activity [ 19 - 22 ] , mature mushroom - shaped spines with larger heads are less likely to change , but show higher sensitivity to glutamate than immature thin spines [ 23 - 26 ] . These differences in synaptic strength are suggested to relate to the number of neurotransmitter receptors . Mature spines have a large spine head area that is proportional to postsyn - aptic density ( PSD ) and synapse size , as well as receptor complement ( Fig . 1 ) . Two - photon glutamate uncaging stud - ies have shown that the mature mushroom - like spines have large PSDs with a high number of Î± - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepro - pionic acid ( AMPA ) receptors [ 23 ] . Indeed , numbers of AMPA receptors and N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors directly correlate with PSD size [ 27 , 28 ] . Spine head volume and PSD size are also propor - tional to the number of neurotransmitter - containing vesicles * Address correspondence to this author at the Biomedical Sciences Division and Neuroscience program , University of California Riverside , USA ; Tel : ( 951 ) 827 - 2186 ; Fax : ( 951 ) 827 - 7121 ; E - mail : iryna . ethell @ ucr . edu at the presynaptic bouton [ 29 ] and the amount of neuro - transmitter released at the synapse [ 30 ] . Mature dendritic spines also contain elements of endoplasmic reticulum , called the spine apparatus , and provide means for compart - mentalization within the neuron , which results in localized control over factors such as intracellular Ca 2 + concentration [ 31 ] and local protein synthesis [ 32 ] . Dendritic spines remain plastic in the adult brain and can rapidly grow , change , or collapse in response to normal physiological changes in synaptic activity that underlies learning and memory . Long - term potentiation ( LTP ) can result in spine head enlargement [ 19 , 20 ] , whereas long - term depression ( LTD ) has been reported to induce shrinkage of dendritic spine heads and spine elimination [ 33 ] . Synaptic activity was also shown to shape dendritic spines in area CA1 of the hippocampus [ 8 ] , and long - lasting synaptic en - hancement leads to new spine development [ 34 ] . Although changes in synaptic activity may not always lead to struc - tural remodeling [ 35 ] , experience - dependent motility of spines and change in their morphology has been reported using various learning paradigms in developing rat barrel cortex [ 36 ] , motor cortex [ 37 ] , and hippocampus [ 38 , 39 ] . Pathological stimuli can also lead to changes in dendritic spine shape and number in the developing and adult brain . Immature dendritic spine profiles are found in subjects with Fragile X , Down and Rett syndromes , whose brains exhibit many long , thin spines and filopodia - like protrusions [ 40 , 41 ] . Moreover , dendritic spine loss is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases , and may also contribute to im - paired brain function in these diseases [ 42 ] . The ability of spines to rapidly turnover can lead to recovery from damage [ 43 ] and stressors such as sleep deprivation [ 44 ] . 2 . ACTIN DYNAMICS IN DENDRITIC SPINES Many molecular signals that control the changes in den - dritic spine morphology act through the regulation of F - actin , some through direct interaction with actin , and others via downstream effectors [ 5 ] . Actin dynamics at the leading 68 The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 Pontrello and Ethell edge in motile cells [ 45 ] and in growth cones [ 46 ] control cell locomotion and axon pathfinding , respectively . There is also a tight regulation of actin dynamics within dendritic spines and filopodia - like protrusions . While the stabilization of mature spines is required for synapse maintenance , F - actin remodeling underlies synaptic plasticity and may result in spine turnover , triggering both formation of new spines and filopodia , as well as pruning of existing spines [ 47 , 48 ] . As globular actin ( G - actin ) monomers join together to form actin filaments ( F - actin ) , there is a bidirectional polymeriza - tion that is biased toward what is known as the plus end or barbed end [ 49 ] . In this way , the F - actin barbed end is fast - growing , while the opposite pole of the filament , the minus end or pointed end , elongates more slowly . The constant turnover of the actin filaments in spines results from a steady - state of actin treadmilling , in which G - actin mono - mers are added quickly to the barbed end and are disassem - bled from the pointed end of F - actin filaments , while ex - changing ATP for ADP [ 50 - 53 ] . However , this F - actin treadmilling may or may not lead to changes in dendritic spine shape and size . 3 . PROTEINS REGULATING ACTIN DYNAMICS IN DENDRITIC SPINES Actin assembly regulatory proteins are responsible for shifting the balance between spine assembly and disassem - bly that is required for normal synaptic function . Some regu - late spine morphology through direct interaction with actin , while others control actin dynamics indirectly [ 54 - 56 ] . It is the interplay among many of these proteins that defines the rate of growth or disassembly of actin , and ultimately the morphology of dendritic spines and development of syn - apses . In this review , we discuss the role of actin - binding proteins that are found in dendritic spines and influence den - dritic spine formation , maintenance or remodeling , including proteins that regulate elongation , branching , and bundling of actin filaments and those that trigger actin severing and de - polymerization .

Arp2 / 3 Complex Promotes Nucleation and Branch - ing of Actin Filaments The Actin - Related Protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex is com - prised of seven proteins [ 57 - 59 ] and is responsible for nucle - ating branches from the sides of existing actin filaments and capping the pointed ends , thus creating additional fast - growing barbed ends for further actin polymerization and elongation ( Fig . 2 ) [ 60 - 62 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex contributes to the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for a variety of cellular functions , including cell migration and outgrowth [ 63 ] . It can be found in protruding lamellipodia of fibroblasts [ 64 ] and at the leading edge of carcinoma cells , where its branching activity is needed for lamellipodia extension [ 65 ] . In dendritic spines , Arp2 / 3 is sparsely distributed in the PSD , and more concentrated in a specific domain that lies midway between the plasma membrane , the spine center , the PSD , and the spine neck [ 66 ] . This specificity of Arp2 / 3 localiza - tion suggests a restricted spine region dedicated to actin branching . In cooperation with members of the Ena / VASP family , Arp2 / 3 nucleates actin polymerization and branching for pathogenic bacteria motility [ 67 ] and growth cone protru - sion [ 68 ] . Other cell functions that rely on F - actin assembly , including endocytosis [ 69 ] , internal receptor trafficking [ 70 ] , integrin - mediated cell adhesion [ 71 ] , and phagocytosis [ 72 ] are also mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . In maintaining the balance between assembly and disas - sembly of actin filaments , there are some proteins and fac - tors that compete against the Arp2 / 3 complex , while others work in cooperation ( Fig . 3 ) . Tropomyosin inhibits the branching activity of Arp2 / 3 [ 73 ] , and ATP hydrolysis also acts to antagonize its activity by de - branching older actin filaments [ 74 ] . Conversely , the Arp2 / 3 complex acts in co - operation with gelsolin as it polymerizes actin in the pres - ence of gelsolin - capped filaments [ 75 ] ; and cortactin acti - vates Arp2 / 3 and stabilizes new branch points on actin fila - ments [ 76 ] . The actin - severing protein ADF / cofilin dissoci - ates Arp2 / 3 from actin filaments [ 77 ] , but also uses its sever - ing activity to increase the number of preferred ends for Arp2 / 3 nucleation [ 78 ] . Moreover , the Arp2 / 3 complex acts in opposition to ADF / cofilin in lamellipodia by cross - linking actin filaments and capping pointed ends , thus stabilizing actin filaments and preventing depolymerization [ 79 ] . Phosphorylation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is necessary for its nucleating activity and cellular localization [ 80 ] . Phos - Fig . ( 2 ) . Arp2 / 3 nucleates new branches from existing actin filaments , creating fast - growing barbed ends . 70 The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 Pontrello and Ethell phorylation of Arp2 / 3 can be achieved by such proteins as MAPK - activated protein kinase 2 ( MAPKPK2 ) [ 81 ] and the p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) [ 82 ] . Proteins of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) family , Neural - WASP ( N - WASP ) , Scar , and the WASP - family verprolin - homolo - gous protein ( WAVE ) , are well - known to bind to and acti - vate the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 83 ] , each stimulating a different rate of actin nucleation [ 84 ] . Cdc42 , a member of the Rho family of small GTPases , and Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) stimulate Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity through WASP activation [ 85 - 88 ] . Moreover , the overex - pression of actin - binding protein Abp1 , which is similar to cortactin in structure [ 89 ] and can activate N - WASP [ 90 ] or phosphorylate Arp2 / 3 directly , increased the length and den - sity of mature spines and synapses , whereas RNA interfer - ence ( RNAi ) - mediated knock - down of Abp1 reduced the number of mushroom - shaped spines and synapses in cul - tured hippocampal neurons [ 91 ] . In addition , EphB receptors were found to promote dendritic spine maturation through the Cdc42 - N - WASP pathway , suggesting an involvement of the Arp2 / 3 complex in dendritic spine development [ 92 ] . The role of N - WASP in regulating spine morphogenesis was further supported by findings that show a decrease in the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons with reduced N - WASP expression [ 93 ] . The changes in spine number and morphology following N - WASP knock - down were similar to those of the RNAi - mediated decrease of the Arp3 protein [ 93 ] , suggesting that activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is a mechanism by which N - WASP promotes the formation of mature spines and synapses . A decrease in number of mature dendritic spines was also seen with knock - down of WAVE1 by RNAi in primary hippocampal neurons , and in mouse striatal sections of WAVE1 knock - out mice [ 94 ] . Synaptic plasticity , as well as learning and memory , were also impaired in mice with a targeted WAVE1 muta - tion and in WAVE1 knock - out mice [ 95 , 96 ] , suggesting a role of the WAVE1 pathway in regulating synaptic plastic - ity . Knock - down of Arp2 / 3 through siRNA - targeting of the p34 subunit was recently shown to promote filopodia - like protrusions , while decreasing the number of mushroom , thin , and stubby spines and the overall protrusion density in hip - pocampal neurons [ 97 ] . This is similar to the effect seen when Arp2 / 3 localization was altered by expression of the Scar1 - WA fragment , which further suggests an important role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in promotion of mature dendritic spine phenotype [ 97 ] . It will be interesting to determine whether the Arp2 / 3 complex and its regulatory proteins are also involved in the assembly of the postsynaptic scaffold and in glutamate receptor trafficking . Taken together , these results suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex is tightly regulated in dendritic spines and contributes to spine morphogenesis , inducing formation of mature dendritic spines and synapses , as well as regulating synaptic plasticity . 3 . 1 . 2 . Cortactin Promotes Branching and Stabilization of Actin Filaments Another protein that can bind to and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex is cortactin [ 76 , 98 ] . It was discovered as a cortical protein that binds to actin [ 99 ] and promotes branching and stabilization of actin filaments [ 100 ] . Cortactin is located at sites of actin assembly in lamellipodia [ 101 ] , and is likely involved in endosomal movement in fibroblasts [ 102 ] . It is also implicated in controlling shape - changes of folliculostel - late cells of the anterior pituitary [ 103 ] , and in aberrant cell motility , such as cancer cell migration and invasion [ 104 , 105 ] . In the brain , cortactin is enriched in dendritic spines , where it co - localizes with F - actin . There is a large cortactin pool in the actin core within the dendritic spine , which is implicated in regulating its shape , and a smaller pool near the PSD that may be involved in the regulation of synaptic function [ 106 ] . Cortactin has been implicated in spine morphogenesis in studies using gain - and loss - of - function approaches [ 107 ] . While overexpression of cortactin in hip - pocampal cultures led to spine elongation , knock - down of cortactin with small - interfering RNA ( siRNA ) resulted in loss of spines [ 107 ] . Cortactin interaction with the large GTPase dynamin - 3 variant , Dyn3baa , also promoted filopo - dial extension in cultured rat hippocampal neurons [ 108 ] . The ability of cortactin to use its actin - branching and elonga - tion activity for filopodia formation and outgrowth suggests its important role in spine morphogenesis . In addition , cortactin regulates spine morphology by me - diating the interaction between actin and microtubules . While stable microtubules that express microtubule - associated protein 2 ( MAP2 ) are concentrated in dendritic shafts [ 109 ] , dynamic microtubules can enter dendritic spines and affect actin dynamics [ 110 ] . Microtubule - associated protein EB3 , which is located on the plus - end of dynamic microtubules , may act through a p140Cap - Src pathway to promote cortactin activity and mature dendritic spines . Knock - down of EB3 with shRNA induced a loss of F - actin in dendritic protrusions , as well as a reduction of mature mushroom spines and an increase in filopodia - like structures [ 110 ] , which is similar to the result seen with Fig . ( 3 ) . Regulatory proteins affecting the activity of Arp2 / 3 . Actin Regulation in Dendritic Spines The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 71 RNAi - mediated loss of p140Cap or cortactin [ 107 ] . These effects of EB3 knock - down were reversed by overexpression of p140Cap or cortactin . In this way , dynamic microtubules may contribute to the arrangement and activity of actin - regulating proteins such as cortactin , thus shaping dendritic spines . Cortactin influences actin organization through interac - tions with several proteins that promote F - actin assembly , and these interactions are negatively regulated by cortactin phosphorylation [ 111 , 112 ] . For example , cortactinâs ability to activate WASP and induce actin branching through Arp2 / 3 is inhibited by its phosphorylation , which is mediated by Src non - receptor tyrosine kinase , and results in loss of cortactin from postsynaptic sites [ 113 ] . Î´ - Catenin can inter - act with cortactin , and this interaction was shown to promote F - actin elongation without branching , which was also inhib - ited by Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin [ 114 ] . Cortactin has the ability to link actin dynamics to the cell membrane through interaction with several PSD scaffolding proteins . In addition to Dyn3 , cortactin interacts with the Shank family of proteins that are localized to the PSD of excitatory synapses [ 115 ] . Shank binds to Homer , which has been shown to anchor metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluR ) 1 and 5 [ 116 ] . It seems that cortactinâs association with Shank and Homer could act to stabilize postsynaptic clusters of glutamate receptors during synaptogenesis . Cortactin can be regulated by synaptic activity , as a de - crease in overall cortactin level was observed in rat hippo - campus 4 hours following Morris water maze learning [ 117 ] . This decrease in cortactin is dependent on NMDA receptor activity , and may mediate the actin reorganization that is necessary for learning - induced spine remodeling . In contrast , rats exposed to a novel environment exhibited an increase in cortactin levels in the hippocampus 12 hours later , but this upregulation of cortactin was abolished by 48 hours of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep ( REMS ) deprivation [ 118 ] . Cortactin localization within neurons is regulated by NMDA receptor activity and brain - derived neurotrophic fac - tor ( BDNF ) . NMDA receptor activation induces cortactin re - distribution from dendritic spines to the shaft [ 107 ] , which is mediated by Src non - receptor tyrosine kinases in hippocam - pal cultures [ 119 ] . Activation of Src kinases induces cortac - tin phosphorylation and cortactin depletion from the post - synaptic sites . Conversely , BDNF application stimulates a mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase - dependent re - distribution of cortactin from the dendritic shaft to the spines [ 119 , 120 ] . This shift in cortactin localization may play an important role in activity - dependent spine remodeling . A reduction in the level of cortactin in spines may allow for actin remodeling triggered by NMDA receptor activation , whereas BDNF - induced accumulation of cortactin in spines may increase actin stability necessary for the maintenance of mature spines and synapses . As BDNF itself is regulated by synaptic activity [ 121 ] , it seems that these converse path - ways indeed work together to regulate transient changes in dendritic spine morphology in response to changes in synap - tic activity . The control exerted over cortactin activity by regulating its localization within neurons seems to have a critical role in spine development and synaptogenesis , as well as synaptic plasticity . 3 . 1 . 3 . Î± - Actinin Promotes Bundling and Extension of Actin Î± - Actinin induces bundling and cross - linking of actin networks in a concentration - dependent manner [ 122 , 123 ] by forming anti - parallel homo - dimers that exhibit an actin - binding domain at each end [ 124 - 126 ] . This dimer formation may also target Î± - actinin to the cell membrane , as phosphol - ipids and cytoplasmic regions of transmembrane receptors have an affinity for the exposed acidic surface of Î± - actinin rods [ 123 , 127 , 128 ] . Î± - Actinin can form short branched actin filaments or elongate existing ones , depending on cer - tain conditions and factors , such as the Î± - actinin / actin ratio , Ca 2 + concentration , and binding partners [ 129 ] . Î± - Actinin was first recognized as a protein that enhances the contrac - tion of actomyosin fibers [ 130 , 131 ] , and several muscular pathologies have been linked to Î± - actinin [ 132 , 133 , 134 ] . It is implicated in maintaining cellular shape and adhesion in epithelial cells [ 135 ] and human neutrophils [ 136 ] . Î± - Actinin was also found in leading lamella of smooth muscle cells ( A10 ) [ 137 ] , in growth cones of PC12 cells [ 138 ] and in spi - nal cord neurons [ 139 ] , and is suggested to play a role in cell and growth cone motility . The muscle form of Î± - actinin is Ca 2 + - insensitive , but the activity of the non - muscle form is controlled by Ca 2 + con - centration [ 140 , 141 ] . At low Ca 2 + levels , the actin - bundling activity of Î± - actinin is high , whereas an increase in Ca 2 + lev - els inhibits the cross - linking activity by inducing a structural change in Î± - actinin [ 142 ] . In the brain , this has implications for the control of Î± - actinin by synaptic activity that regulates Ca 2 + influx through NMDA receptors and voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels . Î± - Actinin is also regulated by other actin - binding and signaling proteins . For example , tropomyosin and dre - brin competitively inhibit Î± - actinin binding to actin [ 143 ] , whereas focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) reduces Î± - actinin af - finity for actin by phosphorylation [ 144 ] . Conversely , PIP 2 binds to Î± - actinin and increases its gelation activity [ 145 ] , and the protein actophorin promotes Î± - actinin bundling ac - tivity by severing and positioning actin filaments favorably for Î± - actinin interaction [ 146 ] . Moreover , Î± - actinin acts in cooperation with profilin , as it promotes the actin - polymerizing activity of the profilin - actin complex ( profilac - tin ; [ 147 ] ) . The brain isoform of Î± - actinin [ 148 ] is enriched at the PSD of excitatory synapses and promotes the elongation of dendritic spines [ 149 ] . Î± - Actinin depends on F - actin for its spine localization , as actin depolymerization with latrunculin A disrupts its postsynaptic localization in cultured hippo - campal neurons [ 150 ] . There is evidence that Î± - actinin may also be involved in the assembly of the spine apparatus via interaction with the postsynaptic protein synaptopodin [ 151 ] . Synaptopodin was shown to shift Î± - actinin activity from branching to elongation of existing actin filaments , and syn - aptopodin - deficient mice lack a spine apparatus and exhibit deficiencies in activity - dependent LTP [ 152 ] . In dendritic spines , Î± - actinin was shown to promote both actin filament elongation and branching depending on its interacting proteins . For example , Î± - actinin has been shown to interact with the Spine - Associated Rap GTPase - activating protein ( SPAR ) , which promotes mature dendritic spines . Î± - Actinin2 appears to cooperate with SPAR in creating den - dritic spines with large heads [ 153 ] . This study supports the 72 The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 Pontrello and Ethell role for Î± - actinin in promoting actin branching in the heads of mature dendritic spines . Î± - Actinin could also indirectly contribute to actin - branching activity not only in spines , but in dendrites and axons as well , through its interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor EFA6A [ 154 ] . EFA6A was shown to activate ADP ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6 ) , which regulates axonal and dendritic branching in cultured rat hippocampal neurons [ 155 ] . Conversely , Î± - actinin can promote filopodia - like extensions through its actin - elongating activity , as overexpression of Î± - actinin2 increased the length and number of dendritic filopodia - like protrusions in cultured hippocampal neurons [ 156 ] . The abil - ity of Î± - actinin to promote dendritic filopodia - like exten - sions may be accomplished through its co - localization and interaction with telencephalin ( TLCN ) , a telencephalon - specific cell adhesion molecule , which is known to promote development of filopodia - like protrusions and to slow the maturation of dendritic spines [ 157 , 158 ] . Î± - Actinin was also shown to interact with the NMDA re - ceptor in dendritic spines , promote its anchoring to the post - synaptic membrane [ 159 ] , and regulate NMDA receptor ac - tivity [ 160 , 161 ] . Both Ca 2 + / calmodulin and Ca 2 + / calmo - dulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) compete with Î± - actinin for binding of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA recep - tor [ 162 , 163 ] . While Î± - actinin binding to the NMDA recep - tor increases the receptor open probability , Ca 2 + / calmo - dulin interaction with the NMDA receptor reduces it , resulting in NMDA receptor inactivation [ 164 - 167 ] . The role of Î± - actinin in enhancing NMDA receptor activity is consistent with its ability to induce dendritic filopodia - like protrusions , as NMDA receptor activation also leads to spine remodeling . It would be interesting to see if NMDA receptor anchoring is also affected by Î± - actinin binding to actin filaments or whether Î± - actinin can regulate NMDA receptor interactions with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins , such as PSD - 95 [ 168 ] . Perhaps Î± - actinin can contribute to NMDA receptor anchoring by stabilizing the dendritic spines through its ac - tin - branching and bundling activity . There is evidence that may link Î± - actinin to several neu - ral pathologies . For example , Î± - actinin2 levels were shown to be decreased in an Alzheimerâs disease mouse model ex - pressing mutant hAPP [ 169 ] . Î± - Actinin was accumulated in Hirano bodies , neuronal inclusions that increase with aging and are found in patients with Alzheimerâs disease [ 170 ] . It is possible that the cross - linking activity of Î± - actinin con - tributes to the formation of these structures , which may de - plete the postsynaptic pool of Î± - actinin . A decrease in post - synaptic Î± - actinin was also seen in the Huntingtonâs disease mouse model R6 / 2 [ 171 ] . Through its actin branching and elongating activity , as well as its ability to regulate NMDA receptor activity , Î± - actinin is well positioned for modulating synaptic plasticity . 3 . 1 . 4 . Drebrin Regulates Actin Assembly in Dendritic Spines Drebrin is a developmentally regulated neuron - specific protein that competes with tropomyosin , fascin , Î± - actinin , gelsolin , cofilin , and myosin for actin - binding [ 172 - 175 ] . Drebrin was shown to bundle actin filaments into thick winding fibers in fibroblasts [ 176 ] . The embryonic drebrin isoform , drebrin E , exists in several cell types including neu - rons , while adult drebrin A is exclusively expressed in neu - rons [ 177 ] , and was found to be accumulated in the head area of mature mushroom - shaped dendritic spines with large PSDs and a high number of NMDA receptors in adult mouse cerebral cortex [ 178 ] . Interestingly , drebrin A is specifically localized at postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses and barely detectable in presynaptic terminals , neuronal cell bod - ies , or axons [ 174 , 179 ] . Deletion of the actin - binding do - main of drebrin A [ 180 ] or depolymerization of F - actin with latrunculin A [ 150 ] leads to drebrin A re - distribution throughout various domains of dendrites , suggesting that it is dependent on F - actin for its postsynaptic localization . Drebrin A has been implicated in the development of dendritic spines and synapses [ 179 , 181 , 182 ] . In support of this , it was found in submembranous zones of dendrites prior to the assembly of PSDs , formation of dendritic spine heads , and aggregation of presynaptic vesicles [ 179 ] . Furthermore , drebrin A overexpression in immature neurons induced ac - cumulation of F - actin and PSD - 95 at postsynaptic sites [ 181 ] , whereas suppression of drebrin A expression de - creased spine width and the density of spines and filopodia in developing hippocampal neurons in cultures [ 183 ] . Dre - brin clustering was found to precede PSD - 95 accumulation at postsynaptic sites and suppression of drebrin A expression disrupted PSD - 95 postsynaptic localization [ 184 ] . Moreover , drebrin can also regulate NMDA receptor localization , as membrane targeting of NMDA receptors in cultured hippo - campal neurons after AP5 treatment was abolished following reduction of drebrin A expression by antisense treatment [ 183 ] . Drebrin A postsynaptic localization is regulated by syn - aptic activity , and drebrin was shown to change its localiza - tion upon AMPA and NMDA receptor activation [ 182 , 185 ] . While NMDA receptor activation induced a loss of drebrin from dendritic spines , an increase in drebrin A - immunoreactive spines was observed following NMDA re - ceptor blockade in vivo , which occurred in the large mush - room - shaped spines [ 186 ] . On the other hand , drebrin clus - tering at postsynaptic sites was induced by AMPA receptor activation during spine morphogenesis and diminished with AMPA receptor blockade [ 182 ] . Together , these studies show that drebrin A induces postsynaptic differentiation , accumulates in mature dendritic spines , and stabilizes exist - ing actin filaments . Therefore , the re - localization of drebrin seen upon NMDA receptor activation may be necessary to allow for spine remodeling . Besides promoting dendritic spine formation and post - synaptic differentiation , drebrin was also implicated in learn - ing and memory and the regulation of dendritic spine plastic - ity [ 180 , 183 ] . For example , drebrin overexpression was shown to induce dendritic spine elongation in cultured corti - cal neurons [ 180 ] . Drebrin overexpression may promote spine elongation by inhibiting myosin association with actin filaments , thereby reducing actin contractility [ 174 ] or by competing with actin - stabilizing proteins for actin binding . Recent study has also suggested that drebrin - induced den - dritic spine remodeling may involve activation of Ras family of small GTPases [ 187 ] . The significance of drebrin in nor - mal synapse development and synaptic plasticity is further supported by observations that decreased levels of both dre - brin isoforms were found in the hippocampi of Alzheimerâs patients [ 188 ] and following cerebral ischemia [ 189 ] , as well Actin Regulation in Dendritic Spines The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 73 as in the frontal and temporal cortex of patients with Down syndrome [ 190 ] . In the future , it would be interesting to de - termine the interplay between drebrin and other actin - binding proteins in promoting postsynaptic differentiation and spine maturation , or in regulating spine remodeling and synaptic plasticity . 3 . 1 . 5 . Opposing Effects of Profilin on Actin Polymerization Profilin was first identified as an actin monomer - sequestering protein that can inhibit actin polymerization and elongation [ 191 - 193 ] by forming a 1 : 1 complex with G - actin , thus decreasing its free concentration available to form F - actin polymers [ 194 - 197 ] . Conversely , profilin or the pro - filin - actin complex ( profilactin ) can promote actin polymeri - zation by binding the barbed ends of actin filaments and di - rectly elongating it ( Fig . 4 ) [ 198 , 199 ] . A dose - dependent decrease in the amount of F - actin and lamellipodial size were seen upon microinjection of profilin into normal rat kidney ( NRK ) cells , whereas profilactin increased F - actin and lamellipodial ruffling [ 200 ] . Further , while profilin - bound actin monomers may be removed from the free actin pool and cannot nucleate new filaments , they can be added to F - actin barbed but not pointed ends , contributing to actin fila - ment elongation [ 201 ] . While profilin can promote depolym - erization by binding and sequestering actin monomers , it induces polymerization by lowering the critical concentra - tion of ATP - actin and decreasing actin monomer affinity for its bound nucleotide , thereby favoring ATP - actin formation [ 202 ] . Profilin can also promote the stability of actin fila - ments , as F - actin concentration was shown to increase with stable expression of profilin in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells [ 203 ] . The ability of profilin to promote or inhibit actin polym - erization under different circumstances can result in diverse cellular responses [ 204 ] . Profilin is implicated in cell motil - ity , as it is localized with dynamic actin in fibroblast lamel - lipodia [ 205 ] and it was shown to regulate the movement of Listeria monocytogenes in infected host cells [ 206 ] . Profilin I mRNA was up - regulated in reactive hippocampal microglia following entorhinal deafferentation [ 207 ] , which could also indicate a role for profilin in microglial migration following injury . Profilin regulates cell morphology , as it is involved in thrombin - induced platelet shape change [ 208 ] and endocyto - sis [ 209 , 210 ] . Moreover , several abnormalities , including slow growth and loss of normal cell shape were seen with disruption or deletion of the profilin gene in yeast [ 211 ] , whereas profilin gene deletion in Drosophila was lethal [ 212 ] . Profilin II was detected in neurons and its localization in dendritic spines was shown to be regulated by Ca 2 + levels [ 213 ] . Profilin activity is also regulated by phosphorylation and its interaction with PIP 2 . Profilin interaction with PIP 2 [ 214 - 216 ] inhibits PIP 2 hydrolysis by phospholipase C ( PLC ) [ 217 ] , and dissociates the profilin - actin complex [ 218 ] , which could lead to release of free G - actin monomers and Fig . ( 4 ) . Opposing actions of profilin on actin . G - actin - sequestering promotes F - actin depolymerization , while profilin - actin complex induces polymerization by binding to F - actin barbed ends and promoting formation of ATP - actin monomers . 74 The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 Pontrello and Ethell polymerization near the cell membrane . Conversely , PIP 2 binding to cofilin can stimulate profilin phosphorylation by protein kinase C ( PKC ) [ 219 , 220 ] . Profilin phosphorylation , which can also be achieved by phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) , increases its affinity for G - actin and poly ( L - proline ) [ 221 ] . While PIP 2 binding can lead to increased ac - tin polymerization , profilin phosphorylation would increase its association with G - actin and inhibit actin polymerization . Further , an increased affinity for poly ( L - proline ) may lead to enhanced profilin binding to membrane - associated pro - teins of the Mena / VASP family , resulting in F - actin elonga - tion [ 213 , 222 ] . It would be interesting to determine how profilin - PIP 2 binding and PKC phosphorylation of profilin regulate F - actin polymerization in dendritic spines . Profilin expression is developmentally regulated in rat cerebellum [ 223 ] and is detected at synaptic sites in the adult cerebellar cortex [ 224 ] , suggesting that it may play a role in synaptogenesis . Indeed , profilin associates with gephyrin and Mena to form a postsynaptic cortical scaffolding complex [ 225 ] . Upon NMDA receptor activation and Ca 2 + influx , profilin is recruited to and stabilizes dendritic spines in a VASP - dependent manner [ 213 , 226 , 227 ] . Moreover , electri - cal stimulation that is known to produce LTP promoted simi - lar recruitment of profilin to dendritic spines and spine stabi - lization [ 213 ] , suggesting that profilin may be involved in regulation of dendritic spine and synapse dynamics underly - ing experience - dependent plasticity . Besides the role of profilin II in normal dendritic spine development and plasticity , several studies have suggested that profilin II may mediate cytoskeletal changes in response to pathological conditions and disease processes . For exam - ple , profilin interacts with the Huntington Disease protein Huntingtin ( Htt ) , and could be involved in causing the patho - logical aggregation of Htt . [ 228 ] . Inhibition of Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) , which forms a complex with profilin II [ 229 ] , re - duces Htt aggregation [ 230 ] . On the other hand , profilin de - pletion can lead to neuronal deficits , as some patients with Miller - Dieker syndrome have been shown to exhibit partial profilin gene deletions [ 231 ] . The Fragile X mental retarda - tion protein in Drosophila ( dFMRP ) was shown to regulate the neuronal cytoskeleton through profilin , as dFMRP binds mRNA of the profilin homolog and decreases its protein expression [ 232 ] . Profilin II knock - out mice demonstrated a lack of an actin polymerizing response to depolarization , which led to increased synaptic excitability due to increased vesicle exocytosis in glutamatergic neurons [ 233 ] . These studies correlate well , as some Fragile X phenotypes could also be explained by increased synaptic excitability , perhaps from decreased profilin levels . These studies show the re - markably diverse functions of profilin in controlling actin dynamics in dendritic spines . Depending on cellular signals and interacting proteins , profilin may promote actin polym - erization or depolymerization , which could lead to forma - tion , stabilization , or remodeling of dendritic spines . 3 . 1 . 6 . Spinophilin ( Neurabin II ) and Neurabin I Promote cross - Linking of Actin Spinophilin derives its name from its localization in the heads of dendritic spines [ 234 ] , and neurabin I is a neural tissue â specific actin â binding protein [ 235 ] . Both proteins are structurally related and display actin cross - linking and bun - dling activity . Spinophilin is expressed ubiquitously , but most abundantly in the brain , where it is localized in PSDs [ 236 ] . Neurabin I is accumulated in dendritic spines , as well as in growth cone lamellipodia of developing neurons . A multitude of binding partners have been identified for spinophilin [ 237 ] , including those with implications for syn - aptic function , such as protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) . Spino - philin participates in targeting PP1 to the postsynaptic mem - brane ( Fig . 5 ) [ 234 , 238 ] , which allows PP1 to dephosphory - late its synaptic substrates . In this way , spinophilin can indi - rectly modify the activities of AMPA and NMDA receptors , two known substrates of PP1 . In vivo , spinophilin takes part in the anchoring of AMPA receptors to the plasma mem - brane and promotes its dephosphorylation through PP1 [ 239 ] . Spinophilin knock - out mice exhibited an increased density of dendritic filopodia and immature spines , abnormal regulation of AMPA receptor activity by PP1 , and impaired LTD , suggesting that spinophilin may regulate excitatory synaptic transmission and spine morphogenesis through PP1 - mediated regulation of AMPA receptor activity [ 240 ] . Fur - ther , phosphorylation of spinophilin by protein kinase A ( PKA ) [ 241 ] or CaMKII [ 242 ] reduces the affinity of spino - philin for F - actin and causes a change in its cellular localiza - tion , which may also alter its binding with PP1 due to spatial segregation . Spinophilin phosphorylation by CaMKII is Ca 2 + - dependent and may play a role in synaptic plasticity . In addition , a downregulation of the expression of spinophilin and GluR1 were observed during sleep following unilateral LTP induction in the prefrontal cortex of rats [ 243 ] . Taken together , these studies demonstrate that phosphorylation of spinophilin regulates its expression and specific localization within dendritic spines , where it is positioned to regulate synaptic activity and spine morphogenesis . Although spinophilin and neurabin I are structurally simi - lar , are localized in dendritic spines , and bind some of the same partners , they may have variable effects on dendritic spine morphology . While the actin - bundling activity of spi - nophilin seems to suppress outgrowth of immature dendritic filopodia - like protrusions [ 240 ] , overexpression of neurabin I in immature neuronal cultures induced these protrusions [ 244 ] . Neurite formation was also reversibly abolished by neurabin I suppression following antisense oligonucleotide treatment of rat hippocampal neurons [ 236 ] . In contrast to the effects of spinophilin depletion , knock - out of neurabin I led to impaired LTP and enhanced AMPA receptor - mediated synaptic transmission ; however , LTD was not altered [ 245 ] . Neurabin I may act as a competitive inhibitor of spinophilin , resulting in opposing effects on dendritic spines and synaptic activity , as they are structurally similar and share the same binding partners . 3 . 2 . Actin Filaments Severing and De - Polymerization 3 . 2 . 1 . Cofilin Regulates Actin Filament Treadmilling Cofilin is a member of the ADF / cofilin family of actin - depolymerizing proteins that preferentially bind to ADP - actin subunits in a minor twisted conformation of F - actin and sever filaments ( Fig . 6 ) . This increases the pool of G - actin monomers used by actin polymerizing factors and also cre - ates free barbed ends that can nucleate filament growth [ 246 - Actin Regulation in Dendritic Spines The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 75 248 ] . Cofilin is expressed at high levels in the adult brain [ 249 ] and is more abundant in mammalian neurons than ADF [ 250 ] ; therefore in this review , we will primarily dis - cuss the role of cofilin in actin dynamics . Low levels of cofilin activity are detected in resting cells and contribute to F - actin depolymerization at the âpointedâ ends and F - actin polymerization at the âbarbedâ ends , resulting in F - actin turnover at a slow rate [ 251 ] . On the other hand , enhanced cofilin activity is often detected in ruffling membranes at the leading edge of migrating cells and in neuronal growth cones , leading to fast F - actin dynamics [ 252 - 254 ] . The local concentration of cofilin in specific subcellular compartments determines the cofilin / actin ratio , thus influencing its effects on actin dynamics . While a low cofilin / actin ratio was shown to result in the highest severing of actin filaments , at high ratios cofilin can induce dissociation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and de - branching , resulting in formation of long , un - branched filaments [ 77 , 255 ] . Therefore , the actions of cofilin in the cell largely depend on its localization and the level of activity [ 255 ] . Cofilin activity is regulated by phosphorylation . LIM kinase ( LIMK ) suppresses cofilin activity by phosphorylat - ing cofilin at Serine 3 , which inhibits its binding to F - actin [ 256 , 257 ] . The cofilin - specific phosphatases slingshot ( SSH ) and chronophin ( CIN ) dephosphorylate and activate cofilin [ 258 - 260 ] . The importance of cofilin phosphorylation in synaptic structural plasticity during LTP induction and protective effects of the inactive phospho - mimetic cofilin S3D mutant against A Î² - mediated spine loss have been recently reported [ 261 , 262 ] . Our studies have also shown that over - expression of inactive cofilin S3D promoted stabilization of mature dendritic spines , whereas constitutively - active cofil - in S3A induced remodeling and elongation of actin - rich stable dendritic spines , and extension of new filopodia - like protru - sions [ 263 ] . Moreover , depletion of cofilin - 1 in cultured hip - pocampal neurons by overexpressing cofilin - 1 siRNA was shown to decrease the number of mature dendritic spines and to induce the formation of abnormal filopodia - like branches [ 97 ] . Immunoelectron microscopy studies have found that cofilin accumulates near the PSD in the âshellâ area of den - dritic spines , a specific region containing a dynamic F - actin pool , while avoiding the spine âcoreâ with a stable pool of F - actin [ 264 ] . The effect of actin - remodeling activity of cofilin on dendritic spine morphology and its localization within spines suggest that cofilin may play a role in dendritic spine plasticity . Fig . ( 5 ) . Spinophilin participates in localization of PP1 to the cell membrane , where it dephosphorylates NMDA and AMPA receptors , down - regulating their activity . The actin - bundling activity of spinophilin prevents outgrowth of filopodia - like protrusions . 76 The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 Pontrello and Ethell Several mechanisms that control cofilin activity in den - dritic spines were recently proposed involving Rho GTPase - dependent regulation of LIMK activity ( Fig . 7 ) [ 263 , 265 ] . Members of Rho family GTPases such as RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac can promote activation of LIMK through Pak and ROCK , respectively [ 257 , 266 , 267 ] . Pak1 and ROCK2 were demonstrated to regulate dendritic spine properties and syn - aptic density through LIMK - mediated regulation of cofilin activity [ 268 , 269 ] . Moreover , the Rac - Pak - LIMK pathway was suggested to contribute to SynGAP - mediated regulation of steady - state cofilin phosphorylation in dendritic spines [ 265 ] . Our studies suggest that EphB2 - mediated dendritic spine stabilization relies on the ability of EphB2 receptors to activate the RhoA - ROCK - LIMK - 1 pathway that works to suppress cofilin activity by phosphorylation [ 263 ] . LIMK - 1 is primarily expressed in neurons and was shown to be in - volved in dendritic spine development . Neurons from LIMK knock out mice formed morphologically immature dendritic spines with smaller heads and postsynaptic densities com - pared to wild - type neurons [ 270 ] , and the inhibition of LIMK translation by microRNA - 134 also resulted in smaller spine heads [ 271 ] . Cofilin phosphorylation can also be regu - lated independently of Rho GTPases . NMDA receptor acti - vation in cultured hippocampal neurons was shown to trigger transient dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin [ 265 ] . Ca 2 + - dependent changes in SSH activity were previously implicated in the regulation of cofilin activity [ 272 ] . Ca 2 + influx through NMDA receptors can rapidly activate cal - cineurin [ 273 ] , which in turn was shown to induce cofilin dephosphorylation through an upregulation of SSH activity [ 272 ] . In addition , the NMDA receptor - calcineurin pathway was shown to mediate reversible spine shrinkage in acute hippocampal slices following LTD by regulating cofilin ac - tivity [ 33 ] . While LTD induction depended on PP1 , the change in spine morphology depended on cofilin , suggesting that these pathways may cooperate to regulate activity - dependent synapse pruning . In summary , the spine - remodeling activity of cofilin can be enhanced through a variety of signaling cascades that result in cofilin dephos - phorylation through suppression of LIMK activity and / or SSH activation . Besides regulation of cofilin activity by phosphorylation , there are other mechanisms that influence the actin - severing ability of cofilin . Cofilin competes for actin binding with the actin - stabilizing protein drebrin [ 274 ] . Therefore , increased drebrin levels could lead to stabilization of actin filaments by preventing cofilin binding to actin filaments , whereas an increase in cofilin concentration could result in release of drebrin from actin filaments and enhance cofilin - mediated actin depolymerization . Cofilin - mediated actin depolymeri - zation can also be inhibited by phosphoinositides , especially PIP 2 , which interacts with the actin - binding domain of cofilin and triggers its association with the plasma membrane [ 275 , 276 ] . On the other hand , the EphA4 receptor was shown to regulate cofilin activity in spines through activation of phospholipase C Î³ , followed by hydrolysis of PIP 2 and release of active cofilin from the membrane [ 277 ] . PIP 2 was also shown to inhibit cofilinâs ability to form cofilin - actin rods in myotubes [ 278 ] . In neurons , formation of cofilin - Fig . ( 6 ) . Actin - severing activity of cofilin promotes F - actin and spine remodeling . Fig . ( 7 ) . Regulatory proteins that enhance or inhibit the activity of cofilin . Actin Regulation in Dendritic Spines The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 77 actin rods has been observed in response to neuronal stress [ 279 , 280 ] . Treatment of hippocampal neurons with amyloid beta ( A Î² ) 1 - 42 peptide also led to the formation of cofilin - actin rods in dendrites and axons of neurons in both dissociated hippocampal cultures [ 281 ] and organotypic hippocampal slices [ 280 ] . Similar filamentous structures were detected in brains of subjects with Alzheimerâs disease [ 282 ] . Therefore , it is possible that recruitment of a large number of cofilin molecules to actin rods would deplete the cofilin pool in dendritic spines , thus affecting dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic plasticity . Taken together , these studies indicate that cofilin is regulated by multiple mechanisms , which ap - pear to be critical for dendritic spine maintenance and plas - ticity . 3 . 2 . 2 . Gelsolin Severing Activity is Regulated by Ca 2 + Gelsolin derives its name from the process of âgel - solâ transformation of F - actin in the cortical cytoplasm of motile cells , which reversibly transitions from a highly cross - linked state ( âgelationâ ) to a disassembled state ( âsolationâ ) in or - der to promote cell movement [ 283 ] . Gelsolin has a variety of functions , such as binding and severing F - actin and cap - ping fast - growing barbed ends [ 284 - 287 ] , as well as nucleat - ing new filament polymerization [ 288 ] . Gelsolin binds selec - tively to ADP - actin [ 289 , 290 ] , introducing a conformational change , thus severing actin filaments [ 291 , 292 ] . In combi - nation with its capping activity , this leads to an increase in the number of pointed ends and ADP - actin dissociation . The structure of gelsolin has been delineated [ 293 , 294 ] , as well as its interaction with actin [ 295 - 300 ] . Structural provisions for gelsolin actin - severing [ 301 - 303 ] and polymerization activities [ 304 ] have also been well - studied in non - neuronal cells . Gelsolin is involved in the regulation of cell motility [ 305 , 306 ] and phagocytosis [ 307 ] , as well as inhibition of axonal transport of membranous organelles [ 308 ] . Mutated gelsolin was shown to inhibit fibroblast growth [ 309 ] and Rac - dependent motility was reduced in gelsolin - null fibro - blasts [ 310 ] . Gelsolin activity can be regulated by different factors , in - cluding protein interactions and pH [ 311 ] . Tropomyosin competes with gelsolin for actin binding [ 312 ] . Moreover , phosphate analogs and activated GTP - Rac1 can reduce F - actin susceptibility to severing by promoting gelsolin disso - ciation from actin filaments [ 313 , 314 ] . The actin severing and nucleating activities of gelsolin are inhibited by PIP 2 [ 315 , 316 ] . Conversely , gelsolin can promote the phosphory - lation of PIP 2 by activating PI3 - K [ 317 ] , and inhibit the hy - drolysis of PIP 2 through competitive substrate binding [ 318 , 319 ] . This has implications for linking the cell membrane with actin dynamics through gelsolin activity . Gelsolin - actin binding is also regulated by micromolar concentrations of Ca 2 + [ 283 , 320 - 323 ] . Ca 2 + was shown to promote gelsolin severing activity [ 320 , 324 ] , and to increase the efficiency of its capping activity [ 325 ] . By occupying the Ca 2 + - binding domain of gelsolin [ 326 ] , Ca 2 + ions induce structural changes in gelsolin [ 327 - 329 ] . Gelsolin is detected in the brain , spinal cord , and in cul - tured neurons [ 330 ] , where it is implicated in plasticity . An upregulation in gelsolin mRNA [ 331 ] and gelsolin protein levels [ 332 ] was found in the rat hippocampus following entorhinal deafferentation , suggesting that gelsolin may play a role in brain remodeling following hippocampal injury . Filopodia and lamellipodia are enriched with gelsolin [ 333 , 334 ] , and gelsolin knock - out mice exhibit slower filopodial retraction [ 335 ] , further supporting the role of gelsolin in cell - protrusive activities . Gelsolin knock - out mice exhibit increased Ca 2 + influx following glutamate exposure [ 336 ] and fail to display an NMDA receptor - dependent decrease in the actin turnover rate [ 337 ] . These studies implicate gel - solinâs severing and capping activity in mediating NMDA receptor - induced spine stabilization . Mutations in the gelsolin gene were found in subjects with familial amyloidosis [ 338 - 341 ] . This could partially explain the neuronal pathologies of the disease [ 342 ] , includ - ing signs of de - myelination reported in these patients [ 343 ] , as high levels of gelsolin are detected in myelin - forming cells and implicated in lamellipodial movement toward the axons during myelination [ 344 - 346 ] . Gelsolin mutations are also linked to Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs diseases [ 347 ] . In addition , subjects with Down syndrome exhibited an in - crease in gelsolin levels in developing frontal cortex , and levels of gelsolin were shown to rise with aging in control subjects [ 348 ] . The ability of gelsolin to bind and sever F - actin and to cap fast - growing barbed ends , as well as to nu - cleate filament polymerization , supports its role in mediating actin remodeling in dendritic spines . 3 . 3 . Myosins Influence Actin Dynamics at Synapses Although F - actin assembly / disassembly determines actin dynamics , myosin motors posses ATPase activity and can also influence actin dynamics in dendritic spines . The my - osin II , V , and VI isoforms were found in dendritic spines [ 349 ] , and are suggested to regulate dendritic spine shape and synaptic plasticity , at least in part through interaction with actin and modulation of NMDA and AMPA receptor membrane insertion and function . Actin - myosin interaction is known to regulate dendritic spine shape and is inhibited by drebrin , which is enriched in mature dendritic spines [ 174 , 178 ] . Although myosin IIB immunoreactivity was identified throughout neuronal cell bodies and various dendritic do - mains that lack drebrin immunoreactivity , a small pool of myosin IIB was also detected within the drebrin - positive fraction of F - actin in dendritic spines [ 350 ] . Drebrin overex - pression , on the other hand , has been shown to elongate den - dritic spines , so it may function here to inhibit actin - myosin contractility [ 174 ] . Myosin motors have been suggested to contribute to the formation of mature short mushroom - shaped and stubby spines . In support of this , myosin IIB de - pletion with RNAi causes a decrease in the number of short mushroom - shaped spines and an increase in long filopodia - like protrusions [ 351 ] . Myosins can also interact with NR1 and NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors through the myosin regulatory light chain [ 352 ] and control the trafficking of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors from the dendritic shaft to dendritic spines in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner [ 353 ] . Myosin Vb associates with recycling endosomes and mobilizes them for AMPA receptor insertion and spine growth upon LTP induction , whereas depletion of myosin Vb using RNAi prevents LTP - induced AMPA receptor insertion into the postsynaptic membrane and spine growth [ 354 ] . Further , the PSD - 95 in - teracting protein guanylate kinase domain - associated protein ( GKAP ) interacts with the dynein light chain ( DLC ) of my - 78 The Open Neuroscience Journal , 2009 , Volume 3 Pontrello and Ethell osin V , which may implicate myosin V in NMDA receptor regulation [ 355 ] . Myosin VI is also enriched in the brain and localized to PSDs in synapses . Spine loss was seen upon myosin VI dis - ruption through the expression of a dominant - negative mu - tant or in hippocampal cultures of myosin VI deficient mice [ 356 ] . In addition , increase in AMPA receptor internalization following AMPA or insulin stimulation was not observed in myosin VI deficient neurons [ 356 ] . Myosin VI promotes the formation of mature spines and synapses , but also allows for LTP termination by receptor internalization . Although my - osin is perhaps best studied for its role in generation of con - tractile forces in non - neuronal cells , myosin II , V , and VI also exhibit important roles in promoting mature dendritic spine morphology and regulating synaptic plasticity through NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking at synapses . 4 . INTEGRATION OF ACTIN - BINDING PROTEINS IN THE REGULATION OF DENDRITIC SPINES AND SYNAPSES There are many actin - binding proteins within the cell that directly regulate actin polymerization , branching , cross - linking and bundling , or severing and depolymerization . By affecting actin dynamics , actin - binding proteins have the ability to form , re - arrange , stabilize , or remodel dendritic spines . These proteins also aid in clustering postsynaptic proteins and in regulating neurotransmitter receptor activities to create functional synaptic connections . Some actin - regulatory proteins like profilin have multiple functions in dendritic spines and pose opposing effects on actin , depend - ing on several factors and conditions , such as its subcellular localization , Ca 2 + levels , interactions with other proteins , and phosphorylation state . Other proteins such as spinophilin and neurabin I are similar in structure and activity , but exhibit opposing effects on dendritic spines through yet unknown mechanisms . Arp2 / 3 and cortactin work together , each to promote the activity of the other , contributing to actin po - lymerization . While Î± - actinin elongates dendritic spines , myosins induce the formation of short mushroom - shaped spines by enhancing actomyosin contractility . Meanwhile , ADF / cofilin and gelsolin work by severing F - actin filaments , which can promote spine elongation and remodeling by in - creasing actin filament turnover , or lead to spine stabilization through gelsolin capping activity . These actin - binding proteins are regulated by signaling cascades that are initiated at the cell surface through trans - synaptic interactions , neuron - glia communications , and con - tacts with the extracellular matrix [ 5 ] . Cell surface receptors , such as glutamate receptors , EphB receptors and ephrins , neuroligins and neurexins , integrins , cell adhesion mole - cules , growth factor receptors , and some proteoglycans , me - diate these interactions linking extracellular events to the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines by initiating cytoplas - mic signaling cascades . Cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as PIP 2 exhibit diverse control through a variety of mecha - nisms , from promoting Î± - actinin activity through direct binding , to activating Arp2 / 3 through WASP , to dissociating the profilactin complex from actin . The Rho family of small GTPases , such as Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA , are also key regulators of actin - binding proteins in dendritic spines and play an important role in dendritic spine formation , mainte - nance , and remodeling . In addition to the structural role of actin in dendritic spines , actin assembly was recently sug - gested to influence neuronal motility through a regulation of gene transcription [ 357 ] . This may have implications for a role of actin - binding proteins in regulating gene transcription and protein synthesis in spines . Dendritic spine dynamics have been implicated in proc - esses of learning and memory [ 358 , 359 ] , and abnormalities in the shape and number of spines are seen in neurodegen - erative diseases , as well as some forms of mental retardation and autistic spectrum disorders [ 41 , 42 ] . While the role of various actin - binding proteins in regulating spine dynamics has been studied , a challenge for future research is to under - stand the interplay between different actin - regulating factors under an array of physiological and pathological conditions .
