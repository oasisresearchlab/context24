Brown 2 Received : 6 April 2023 / Revised : 1 May 2023 / Accepted : 2 May 2023 © The Author ( s ) , under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023 Abstract Ostensibly serving to restrict contact with disease vectors , humans exhibit aversion toward cues heuristically inferred as pathogenic . This restriction could lead perceivers to downregulate their interest in food consumption , even if such cues may not connote actual disease threats . This proclivity to avoid disease led us to consider how heuristic disease cues inform interest in foods . Participants evaluated a hypothetical food preparer that varied in the presence of heuristic cues to disease transmission ( i . e . , physical deformities versus healthy control ) . Individuals with low levels of perceived infectability were more discerning of the social target as a function of disease cues , whereas heightened levels of this trait fostered an overall aversion to targets regardless of health status . Results provide continued evidence for how pathogen avoidance motives compete with other somatic motives . Keywords Appetite · Behavioral immune system · Stigma · Prejudice · Disgust Human survival relies on the successful navigation of com - peting motivational states . These states are frequently in conflict with each other and require vigilance toward threat - ening social stimuli ( Kenrick et al . , 2010 ; Neuberg et al . , 2011 ) . One potential stimulus toward which perceivers often exercise extensive judiciousness is food . Many pathogenic threats are visible in food that elicit disgust ( e . g . , mold , fun - gus ; Hoefling et al . , 2009 ) , whereas additional threats are less visible ( e . g . , microbes ) . Perceivers could ultimately use visible heuristics of disease transmission to track the poten - tial contamination of food , even if these heuristics are not diagnostic of actual contamination ( e . g . , Al - Shawaf et al . , 2015 ; Klaczynski , 2008 ; Rozin & Nemeroff , 2002 ) . From an error management perspective ( Haselton & Nettle , 2006 ) , erroneously engaging actual disease threats would impose considerable fitness costs than erroneously avoiding targets pos - ing no threat . This could result in aversion toward food with the impression that they connote an actual risk of infection despite a lack of more veridical evidence . Heuristic disease cues include anomalous physical features to which perceptual systems cali - brate based on cultural information ( e . g . , Ackerman et al . , 2009 ; Makhanova et al . , 2022 ) . Perceivers with heightened concerns of disease threat could view these features as a source of contamina - tion , a widely identified aversion to anomalous features among those with a chronically heightened motivation to avoid disease ( e . g . , Makhanova et al . , 2015 ; Murray & Schaller , 2012 ; Young et al . , 2011 ) . This study investigates how heuristic cues to disease foster aversion to food , particularly as a function of individual differences in pathogen avoidance . Disease Avoidance and Social Perceptions Organisms have sophisticated responses to disease threats . This response contains both innate ( e . g . , cellular barriers ) and adaptive subsystems ( e . g . , antigenic responses ) afford - ing multilayered defenses against infections ( Litman et al . , 2005 ; Pancer & Cooper , 2006 ) . However , these physiologi - cal responses are metabolically costly and require major caloric expenditure . Humans increase their metabolic activ - ity by 13 % to raise their body temperature by 1 °C ( Kluger , 1991 ) . These responses divert metabolic resources from physiological systems that promote competing fitness - enhancing behaviors ( e . g . , eating , mating ) to address more immediate physical threats . In complement to physiological * Mitch Brown mb103 @ uark . edu 1 Department of Psychological Science , University of Arkansas , Fayetteville , AR 72701 , USA 2 Lake Elementary School , Mentor - on - the - Lake , USA Evolutionary Psychological Science 1 3 responses to disease , a behavioral immune system appears to have evolved to facilitate prophylactic responses . This system involves the identification and avoidance of disease vectors preemptively to reduce infection , rendering upregu - lation of metabolically physiological responses unnecessary ( Murray & Schaller , 2016 ) . Within this behavioral immune system are affective and behavioral responses to disease threats . One well - documented response is disgust toward potentially contaminated food ( Al - Shawaf et al . , 2015 ; Hoefling & Strack , 2010 ; Kupfer & Fessler , 2018 ) . The risk of disease transmission through interpersonal contact suggests this avoidance could mitigate disease transmission ( Hoang et al . , 2019 ; Jones et al . , 2008 ) . This aversion should be especially apparent when people have affiliative opportunities with others unlikely to transmit the dis - ease ( Brown et al . , 2021a ) . Both acute salience of disease and heightened levels of pathogen avoidance motives on a disposi - tional level foster aversive responses . Responses include inter - personal reticence ( Brown & Sacco , 2016 ; Mortensen et al . , 2010 ; Tybur et al . , 2020 ) , aversion to physical contact ( Brown & Sacco , 2020 , 2022 ; Brown et al . , 2021b ; Makhanova & Shepherd , 2020 ; Murray et al . , 2017 ) , and disinterest in sociali - zation ( Sacco et al . , 2014 ; Sawada et al . , 2018 ) . Disease Avoidance in Food Domains As pathogenic threats restrict interpersonal behavior , social groups could benefit from enacting rigid norms to mitigate disease transmission . Within these norms could be dietary customs based on heuristic disease concerns . Cultures in geopolitical regions with historically greater disease preva - lence adopt restrictive social norms ( Schaller & Murray , 2008 ) , even if norms do not actually reduce disease trans - mission ( e . g . , discouraging left - handedness ; Murray et al . , 2011 ) . Both acute and chronic disease concerns heighten derogation toward nonconforming group members whose behavior appears pathogenic ( Lund & Miller , 2014 ; Murray & Schaller , 2012 ) . Such reticence would function to cod - ify social norms ostensibly necessary for cleanliness ( e . g . , purity rituals ) , particularly among those with naturally heightened pathogen concerns ( Makhanova et al . , 2019 ) . Deviation from food hygiene norms could increase a social group’s risk of infection ( Wormley & Varnum , 2023 ) . Reticent dietary norms could be a psychological design feature to reduce foodborne disease transmission ( Fessler , 2002 ) . Omnivorous species exhibit neophobia to novel food heuristically associated with disease transmission ( e . g . , Visalberghi et al . , 2002 ) . Humans exhibit a similar aversion as a disgust response ( Navarrete & Fessler , 2003 ) , especially considering the pervasiveness of foodborne ill - nesses through interpersonal contact ( Todd et al . , 2007 ) . Awareness of heuristic cues to disease could present similar functions , including anomalous physical features regarded as pathogenically threatening despite a lack of contagion ( Klaczynski , 2008 ; Park et al . , 2007 ; White et al . , 2014 ) . Dispositional pathogen concern is addition - ally associated with heightened wariness toward these cues ( Miller & Maner , 2012 ) . These heuristic associations between contamination and anomalous appearances could lead to disgust toward those with physical contact with food items . Current Research We conducted an experiment investigating the interplay between disease avoidance motives and interest in food based on the presence of heuristic cues of disease threat . We predicted that heuristic disease cues would foster aversion to food preparers with physical deformities , given the wariness individuals demonstrate toward such features ( Ackerman et al . , 2009 ; van Leeuwen & Petersen , 2018 ) . Given previ - ous research suggesting that chronic activation of pathogen avoidance motives fosters such aversion ( e . g . , Brown et al . , 2019a , b ; Makhanova et al . , 2015 ; Murray & Schaller , 2012 ; Park et al . , 2007 ) , chronically heightened pathogen avoid - ance motives should heighten this response . Method Participants We recruited 335 participants from a large public univer - sity in the Southeastern USA . Twenty - two participants were excluded from final analyses for failing a single attention check item , resulting in a final sample of 313 ( 206 women , 104 men , 3 undisclosed ; M Age = 18 . 85 , SD = 1 . 34 ; 85 . 3 % White ) . A statistical sensitivity analysis in G * Power indi - cated that we had sufficient power to test for small effects for a basic between - subjects experimental design that includes the two candidate moderators comprising our individual difference measure of disease avoidance ( Cohen’s f = 0 . 16 , 1 - β = 0 . 80 ; Faul et al . , 2007 ) . Materials and Procedure Disease Avoidance Motives Participants reported dispositional motivations to avoid disease using the perceived vulnerability to disease scale ( PVD ; Duncan et al . , 2009 ) . This 15 - item measure con - sists of two subscales assessing perceived infectability ( PI ; M Grand = 3 . 54 , SD = 1 . 15 ; α = 0 . 87 ) and germ aversion ( GA ; Evolutionary Psychological Science 1 3 M Grand = 3 . 77 , SD = 0 . 92 ; α = 0 . 69 ) along 7 - point scales ( 1 , Strongly Disagree ; 7 , Strongly Agree ) . Both subscales cor - related with each other , although the degree of correlation suggests that they remain distinct from each other ( r = 0 . 24 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Much like previous research showing their dis - tinctiveness ( e . g . , Brown & Sacco , 2016 ; Makhanova et al . , in press ) , we consider them separately in the resulting model . Social Targets We presented an image of a White male face to represent a hypothetical cook at a restaurant named James . Importantly , this target appeared to differ in health status on a between - subjects basis . The target was presented with several notable deformities ( n = 161 ) or as a healthy control ( n = 152 ) . Both versions of the target were presented as a series of slides in a presentation that first introduced the cook with a singu - lar facial image , followed by information on separate slides about where he works and an example of what he cooks . Finally , participants saw an image of the cook’s hand to pro - vide a greater context of his physical appearance . The first and last slides were critically different from each other as cues to disease versus a control condition , whereas the other slides were the same across conditions . For the physical deformity condition , participants viewed a version of the target with deformities that had large facial rashes that would heuristically implicate the target as diseased , although the potential infection risk afforded by this target was relatively ambiguous ( Petersen , 2017 ) . In this condi - tion , we presented an image of his hand to have syndactyly , a birth deformity with increased webbing between fingers to conjoin them . Our decision to use both cues to deformity was to amplify the overall signal value of an estimated dis - ease vector in a person despite neither cue being diagnostic of actual disease transmissibility . The control target appeared physically healthy and had no rashes . We used a similar negatively valanced control image . We presented an image of the target’s hand in a brace after spraining his wrist from slipping on ice from the year prior while indicating a full recovery . This methodological decision aligned with previous research using injuries as a control condition to match the negative valence of disease without activating disease concerns that deformities elicit ( e . g . , Murray et al . , 2019 ; Sacco et al . , 2014 ; White et al . , 2013 ) . Participants evaluated the target’s perceived health as a manipulation check ( 1 , Very Unhealthy ; 7 , Very Healthy ; Brown & Sacco , 2018 ) . See Fig . 1 . Evaluations Participants evaluated the target using eight items assessing the target in relation to his role at a restaurant . Items oper - ated along 7 - point scales aggregated into a composite repre - senting favorability , given the high degree of reliability items had ( 1 , Not at All ; 7 , Very Much ; α = 0 . 91 , M Grand = 5 . 19 , SD = 1 . 16 ) . Table 1 provides a list of the items . Results Perceived Health We used a one - way custom ANCOVA using condition ( deformity vs . control ) as a between - subjects factor . GA and PI were entered into the model as moderators to test for interactive effects within the same model . A condition main effect indicated the deformed target appeared less healthy ( M = 4 . 68 , SD = 1 . 27 ) than the control target ( M = 5 . 22 , SD = 1 . 03 ) , F ( 1 , 307 ) = 5 . 32 , p = 0 . 022 , η p2 = 0 . 017 . Effects were most superordinately qualified by a condi - tion × PI interaction , F ( 1 , 307 ) = 6 . 66 , p = 0 . 010 , η p2 = 0 . 021 ( Fig . 1 ) . We decomposed the significant interaction with subordinate floodlight analyses at low levels ( −1 SD ) and high levels of PI ( + 1 SD ) within the omnibus analyses . The deformed target appeared less healthy than the healthy target at low PI , b = 0 . 86 , SE = 0 . 18 , t = 4 . 70 , p < 0 . 001 . No difference emerged at high PI , b = 0 . 18 , SE = 0 . 18 , t = 1 . 00 , p = 0 . 318 . Viewed another way , PI predicted worse Fig . 1 Facial image presented of target person for control ( left ) and deformity conditions Evolutionary Psychological Science 1 3 evaluations of the control target , b = −0 . 18 , SE = 0 . 07 , t = −2 . 48 , p = 0 . 013 . The association for the deformed target was not significant , b = 0 . 08 , SE = 0 . 07 , t = 1 . 17 , p = 0 . 241 . No other main effects or interactions emerged ( p s > 0 . 191 ) . Primary Analysis We employed a similarly dimensioned ANCOVA for our pri - mary analysis addressing favorability toward the target . The GA main effect was significant , F ( 1 , 307 ) = 4 . 79 , p = 0 . 029 , η p2 = 0 . 015 . Bivariate correlations indicated GA was asso - ciated with marginally less favorability toward the target ( r = −0 . 10 , p = 0 . 059 ) . Effects were most superordinately qualified by a condi - tion × PI interaction , F ( 1 , 307 ) = 14 . 87 , p < 0 . 001 , η p2 = 0 . 046 ( Fig . 2 ) . At low PI , participants evaluated the control target more favorably than the deformed target , b = 0 . 60 , SE = 0 . 18 , t = 3 . 34 , p = 0 . 001 . No difference emerged for high - PI par - ticipants , b = −0 . 33 , SE = 0 . 18 , t = −1 . 81 , p = 0 . 071 . For the deformed target , PI was unexpectedly associated with greater favorability , b = 0 . 19 , SE = 0 . 07 , t = 2 . 78 , p = 0 . 006 . PI was negatively associated with favorability toward the control tar - get , b = −0 . 17 , SE = 0 . 07 , t − 2 . 37 , p = 0 . 018 . No other main effects or interactions emerged ( p s > 0 . 098 ) Fig . 3 . Mediation Analyses The unexpected positive association between PI and evalu - ations of the target with deformities led us to probe the pos - sibility that these effects could be based on general wariness toward social targets among high - PI individuals . Chronically heightened activation of this motive could foster a general perception of social targets as similarly threatening , which could lead them to derogate social targets without disease cues more readily , whereas chronically low levels of acti - vation would elicit discernment between stimuli based on disease status . To test for that fact , we conducted a moder - ated mediation model using Model 8 in PROCESS ( Hayes , 2013 ) , using the perceived health of the target as the can - didate mediator . This model afforded us the opportunity to consider condition and PI as the appropriate predictor and moderator for both the mediator and the outcome ( i . e . , evalu - ation ) within the same model . We considered the conditional indirect effects at high PI and low PI for both target conditions . Perceptions of the target as healthy did not predict evaluations of the target at high PI , b = 0 . 09 , SE = 0 . 10 , 95 % [ −0 . 09 , 0 . 29 ] . However , at low PI , perceptions of health indeed predict more positive evaluations of the target , b = 0 . 45 , SE = 0 . 11 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 25 , 0 . 70 ] . The overall model testing for moderated mediation was significant , with 95 % CI [ −0 . 26 , −0 . 03 ] . This suggests that heightened PI fostered less discernment from perceivers between a target with and without putative cues to disease . Discussion Although not supported in the manner predicted , the results were nonetheless aligned with recent research suggesting greater nuance in behavioral immune system effects . High levels of perceived infectability elicited similar levels of vig - ilance toward both versions of the target , whereas the aver - sive effects of disease cues appeared specifically for those low in perceived infectability . Chronically heightened patho - gen avoidance motives have recently been demonstrated to Table 1 Items comprising the evaluation scale for the target * The item being reverse - scored Scale items I would find a meal cooked by James to be appetizing I would feel completely comfortable eating something prepared by James If I knew James was working in the kitchen of a restaurant , I would be a regular customer I would want to eat a meal prepared by James I feel like I would lose my appetite if I knew James prepared my meal . * If I saw James touching my food , I would be upset . * If I saw James touching my food , I would be disgusted . * If I owned a restaurant , I would want to hire James 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Low - PI High - PI P erce i v e d H e a l t h Deformity Control Fig . 2 Perceived health of the target in deformity and control conditions as a function of perceived infectability ( PI ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Low - PI High - PI E va l u a t i o n Deformity Control Fig . 3 Favorability of the target in deformity and control conditions as a function of perceived infectability ( PI ) Evolutionary Psychological Science 1 3 foster similar levels of aversion to various social stimuli , whereas the effects of disease cues are most prominent among those with lower chronic activation of these motives ( e . g . , Brown & Sacco , 2020 ; Brown et al . , 2019a , b ) . Acute salience of disease cues could foster aversion among indi - viduals with relatively low chronic salience of disease in specific contexts . That the effects were driven primarily by perceived infectability tracks previous findings implicating a cognitive component of the behavioral immune system as important in evaluating social value . Previous research indicates that perceived infectability is associated with aversion to heuris - tic disease cues from bodily features ( e . g . , Brown & Sacco , 2016 ; Duncan & Schaller , 2009 ; Young et al . , 2011 ) . This wariness could be rooted in configurally processing informa - tion about the likelihood of infection , resulting in calculated behaviors to avoid possible illness ( Brown et al . , 2021b ) . These preemptive aversions support an error management framework ( Haselton & Nettle , 2006 ) , given the fact that the deformities on the target did not appear to be cutaneous of the chef’s actual pathogen load . Rather than risking infec - tion , a cognitive response to cues of physical abnormali - ties could be sufficient in response to avoid contamination . These effects mirrored how heightened perceived infectabil - ity led participants to view the healthy and deformed targets as having similar levels of health . As evidenced by our mediation model , the unexpected association between perceived infectability and positive evaluations of the deformed target could have been the product of other results . The especially negative evalua - tion toward the deformed target by individuals low in per - ceived infectability and greater favorability of the control target could have led to the difference emerging with high perceived infectability who could have simply been warier than all social targets . That is , all features could appear simi - larly infectious to those perceivers . In fact , the perceived health of the target was not predictive of high - PI individuals’ evaluations . Social perceptions among those with chroni - cally heightened activation of this motive could operate with greater reticence toward all stimuli when disease concerns are chronically activated ( Mortensen et al . , 2010 ) . From an affordance management perspective ( Neuberg et al . , 2020 ) , a heightened criterion for a perceived disease avoidance opportunity could lead perceivers not to view any stimulus as particularly appetitive . Limitations and Future Directions Various limitations emerged in this study necessitat - ing future research . First , our consideration of behav - ioral immune system responses was based primarily on chronic activation . Future research could use experimental manipulations of disease salience ( e . g . , priming ; Brown & Sacco , 2020 ; Makhanova , 2022 ; Murray & Schaller , 2012 ) . Priming procedures would ostensibly activate pathogen avoidance motives in perceivers prior to their evaluations of disease cues , which could afford more causal evidence for these effects given that personality may be chronic activation of a salient motivational state . It should also be noted that this study was conducted during the fall and winter months in the second year of the COVID - 19 pandemic . During this time , individuals reported greater vigilance toward pathogenic threats in their environ - ment , which saw a decrease in social interests and aversion to novel environments that included going to restaurants ( Brown et al . , 2021b ; Gul et al . , 2022 ; Makhanova & Shepherd , 2020 ) . This unique upregulation of various personality traits that influenced interpersonal behavior could lead to future comparisons for when infectious diseases are less salient . In addition to particularly salient visual heuristics to disease , it could be possible that actual , albeit subtle , cues to infection could foster considerable aversion . Individu - als exhibit above - chance accuracy in identifying whether individuals have contracted an infectious disease without obvious visual cues ( e . g . , lesions , mucus ; Axelsson et al . , 2018 ) . Such faces further foster aversion from perceivers ( Sarolidou et al . , 2019 ) . Future studies could task partici - pants with evaluating meals prepared by faces connoting actual infection compared to healthy controls . Conclusion Dietary customs are frequently informed by practices that could serve to reduce contamination likelihood . Although these behaviors should ostensibly serve to address explicit cues of infection , the oversensitivity of behavioral immune system responses to potentially anomalous features could lead perceivers to have a more liberal criterion for what fea - tures are diagnostic of disease threat despite a lack of actual risk ( e . g . , Miller & Maner , 2012 ) .
