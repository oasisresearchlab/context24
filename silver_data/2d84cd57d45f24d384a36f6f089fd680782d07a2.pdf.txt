EDITORIAL The systemic sclerosis patient in the COVID - 19 era : the challenging crossroad between immunosuppression , differential diagnosis and long - term psychological distress Martina Orlandi 1 & Gemma Lepri 1 & Cosimo Bruni 1 & Yukai Wang 2 & Alessandro Bartoloni 3 & Lorenzo Zammarchi 3 & Laura Cometi 1 & Serena Guiducci 1 & Marco Matucci - Cerinic 1 & Silvia Bellando - Randone 1 Received : 7 May 2020 / Revised : 7 May 2020 / Accepted : 19 May 2020 / Published online : 8 June 2020 # International League of Associations for Rheumatology ( ILAR ) 2020 Abstract COVID - 19 is a world health emergency which may inevitably affect the management of a complex autoimmune disease such as systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . Several SSc patients are frail and , in this pandemic , need a careful protection . The COVID - 19 infection might complicate the clinical scenario of interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) in SSc because it determines a severe pneumonia characterized by radiological features similar to SSc - ILD . The striking CT similarities between the 2 diseases make it difficult to distinguish a worsening of SSc - ILD from COVID - 19 - ILD superinfection . Moreover , other aspects , like isolation during lock down , may cause a significant psychological stress which will pile up on the already difficult contact with the patients for a routine check - up . Moreover , the drug shortage is a real problem in these times . For these reasons , the rheumatologist in daily clinical practice should carefully differentiate the possible COVID - 19 infection in order to optimize the patient management . Therefore , the challenge in everyday life will be to achieve in due time the differential diagnosis as well as the long - term psychological impact . Key Points (cid:129) SSc patients should be encouraged to continue theirchronictherapy ; in caseof immunosuppressive therapy it must be discontinued for safety in case of COVID - 19 infection . (cid:129) Psychological support must be guaranteed to every SSc patients . (cid:129) COVID - 19 pneuminia is hard to distinguish from an interstitial lung disease due to SSc lung involvment .

The pandemic rapidly spread worldwide to the point that led the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to declare the pandemic emergency on March 11 , 2020 [ 1 ] . The epidemiological situation is constantly evolving , and data up - dated in April count more than 2 , 883 , 603 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 , including 198 , 842 deaths [ 2 ] . The COVID - 19 virus affects mainly the lower airway tract determining a se - vere pneumonia characterized by interstitial involvement . Today , COVID - 19 represents a health emergency that may inevitably involve also the management of a complex autoim - mune disease such as systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) which is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by vascu - lar damage , autoimmunity , and fibrosis [ 3 ] . At present , we do not know yet how much SSc patients may be susceptible to the virus and which may be the disease course in those infect - ed with SARS - CoV - 2 . Up to now , the literature reported only one SSc case treated monthly with intravenous tocilizumab , who developed a very mild disease and who had a consequent delay in the treatment [ 4 ] . Nonetheless , the TC features of the lung interstitial disease in SSc ( ILD - SSc ) and of the COVID - 19 pneumonia have similarities that may be clinically relevant and have specific implications that should be considered in taking care of SSc patients during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Immunosuppression in SSc Usually , SSc patients should have a higher infectious risk than the general population because of autoimmune dysregulation and chronic immunosuppressant therapies . The use of synthet - ic and biologic disease - modifying drugs ( DMARDs ) is asso - ciated with a potential to further increase the incidence of serious infections but an active disease may be a significant factor favoring an increase in infection risk too . However , specific data suggesting that a drug - induced immunosup - pressed state might predispose SSc patients to SARS - CoV - 2 infections are not available . However , data from immunosup - pressed transplant patients do not suggest a higher frequency of severe COVID - 19 in this patient cohort [ 5 ] . In SSc patients , the maintenance of disease remission during a pandemic in - fection is important to prevent disease flares avoiding unnec - essary visits and hospitalizations , all of which increase poten - tial exposure to COVID - 19 . Some evidence suggest that immunosuppressive drugs , such as tocilizumab and JAK kinase inhibitors , may be useful in controlling the evolution of COVID pneumonia to the fatal pulmonary complication known as cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) ( “ cytokine storm ” ) . This evidence may therefore sug - gest that SSc patients should continue their immunosuppres - sive medications [ 6 ] . However , some modifications may be considered on a case by case basis as appropriate . In COVID - 19 patients , the pulmonary complications are due to an exuberant local inflammatory response with diffuse alveolar damage . Cytokines and chemokines play a key role in the immune response against viral infections , and their altered production has been demonstrated in both SARS and MERS coronavirus infections [ 7 ] . Such altered levels have been shown to be likely due to the low synthesis of antiviral cyto - kines such as interferons ( IFN ) α or β and in concomitant increased levels of other pro - inflammatory cytokines / chemokines , especially interleukin ( IL ) - 1 , IL - 6 , which have pathogenic consequences . Recent preliminary data reported high plasma levels of cytokines including IL - 6 , related to the severity and the prognosis of the disease with a clear implica - tion for the occurrence of “ cytokine storm ” . Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , an anti - IL - 6 receptor antibody used to treat lung in - volvement in SSc patients , has been also used for treatment of CRS [ 8 ] . In COVID - 19 pneumonia patients , TCZ infusion led to clinical and radiological improvement , suggesting that an anti - IL - 6 strategy might potentially rescue the patient from evolution to respiratory distress syndrome . As TCZ may be mainly used to treat COVID - 19 severe pneumonia cases , its availability must be guaranteed for the treatment of SSc . For this reason , whenever possible , it would be preferable to use subcutaneous administration instead of intravenous TCZ to keep the patient away from the hospital and also to avoid troubles in case of a possible intravenous drug shortage . In these patients , it is important to keep a follow up thus maintaining a tight control to verify the specific case by case clinical needs . In fact , the infection risk in SSc is also related to disease activity and a flare due to therapy discontinuation would confer a higher risk of infection and of corticosteroid use that are moderately recommended in SSc patients [ 9 ] . While the practitioner should always encourage patients to avoid social contacts and maintain a strict isolation , the refer - ence centers should guarantee a telematic assistance to SSc patients in these weeks of COVID - 19 outbreak when the rou - tine outpatient clinics are closed [ 42 ] . The International Societies of Rheumatology have pro - posed a set of practical recommendations to improve the man - agement of COVID - 19 patients and to decrease the risk of acquiring this infection in rheumatic patients undergoing im - munosuppressive therapies [ 10 , 11 ] . If an SSc patient develops symptoms of COVID - 19 con - firmed by two tests , it is important to follow the guidelines suggested by the rheumatology community and immunosup - pression should be paused for the duration of the infection . If the patient has ILD secondary to SSc , a rapid laboratory and 2044 Clin Rheumatol ( 2020 ) 39 : 2043 – 2047 radiological screening must be performed quickly to distin - guish the ILD - SSc flare from the SARS - CoV - 2 superinfection . In SSc patients , Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) is seldom used [ 12 ] . The antiviral properties of chloroquine ( CQ ) and HCQ have been recently confirmed in HIV [ 13 ] and SARS - CoV - 1 with promising results [ 14 , 15 ] . Some papers identified a possible effect of HCQ on COVID - 19 [ 16 – 19 ] in vitro stud - ies showing an antiviral activity toward the SARS - CoV - 2 . Otherwise , in vivo data available are scarce and prone to sig - nificant bias due to methodological limitations . There is pres - ently no medium to long - term follow - up data to support this approach , and all the effects presented require clinical trial confirmation , most of which are already underway . On April 2020 , ClinicalTrials . gov search for COVID - 19 and HCQ shows 44 registered trials . However , on the basis of prelimi - nary results from ongoing clinical trials , some countries have incorporated CQ / HCQ into their treatment protocols for cer - tain patients with COVID - 19 , despite a lack of sufficient ev - idence of effectiveness [ 20 , 21 ] . The practical advice for SSc patients on chronic antimalarials is to maintain the treatment , considering its antiviral activity as well as the immunomodu - latory rather than immunosuppressive effect . The potential shortage of HCQ for patients with SSc due to the redirection of supply toward treatment of COVID - 19 is concerning . There are no good substitutes for antimalarials in terms of the favorable risk - benefit ratio for treatment of certain mani - festations of SSc , and several companies have ramped up the production of HCQ to ensure no interruption of treatment for patients with autoimmune conditions . Interstitial lung disease Patients with chronic ILD may be more prone to develop a severe COVID - 19 lung infection [ 22 ] . In fact , ILD is one of the most severe complications in SSc patients and it is well known that SARS - CoV - 2 has a specific tropism for lower respiratory tract and the pulmonary interstitium . In ILD - SSc , the interstitial disease likely originates from a dysregulation of the systemic immune system . COVID - 19 induces direct lung injury by involving angiotensin - converting enzyme - 2 recep - tors , with potential evolution to diffuse alveolar damage [ 23 , 24 ] . In SSc , COVID - 19 may overlap and complicate ILD - SSc determining an acute severe pneumonia characterized initially by radiological features that may be confused with those of SSc - ILD . Therefore , the radiologist and the rheumatologist should always liaise to understand if the ongoing ILD involve - ment is secondary to disease progression or is an early phase of COVID infection . At interstitial level , bilateral and subpleural involvement and presence of ground - glass opaci - ties ( GGO ) with or without consolidations are the most fre - quent radiological modifications present in both diseases . In fact , SSc - ILD is characterized by bilateral , lower - lobe predominant GGO , reticulations , and , in advanced cases , honeycombing [ 25 – 28 ] . In SARS - CoV - 2 infection , severe pneumonia is characterized by bilateral GGO evolving to con - solidations with a peripheral and subpleural distribution dif - fusing at also upper lobes . The clinical presentation of SSc - ILD and COVID - 19 can be similar and clinically characterized by dyspnea , fatigue , and non - productive cough . During SARS - CoV - 2 infection , these symptoms may be accompanied by fever and rapid re - spiratory function decrease [ 29 – 31 ] . The absence of fever should not lower the suspicion for a SARS - CoV - 2 infection in symptomatic ( conjunctivitis , dysgeusia , olfactory loss , di - arrhea , cough , dyspnea , asthenia ) patients with SSc , particu - larly in those on immunosuppression , in which fever response can be absent . In these patients , it is of paramount importance to test rapidly for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , as respiratory symp - toms such as dry cough and shortness of breath can be wrong - ly attributed to worsening of underlying ILD - SSc . Moreover , in the literature , a large number of asymptomatic COVID - 19 patients are reported [ 32 ] . It should not be forgotten that despite these clinical and radiological similarities , the two diseases present a very dif - ferent progression rate . In fact , COVID - 19 has acute progres - sion leading to respiratory failure and exitus in few weeks [ 8 , 18 ] while ILD - SSc has a chronic - sub chronic evolution lead - ing to mortality in several years [ 33 , 34 ] . At present , COVID - 19 diagnosis relies on epidemiological and clinical criteria and serological confirmation with real - time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rRT - PCR ) of respiratory secretions [ 35 ] . It is now well known that this method may also yield false - negative results ( especially in early disease ) and there - fore should be repeated after some days [ 36 – 39 ] . In this sce - nario , chest HRCT has a central role in diagnostic algorithm , in particular in early disease phase , in patients asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic for COVID - 19 infection , pending infec - tious disease tests , and false - negative laboratory tests . The striking HRCT similarities between the 2 diseases make it difficult to distinguish a worsening of SSc - ILD from COVID - 19 - ILD superinfection . Clearly , even if there is an ILD - SSc , the patient ’ s preventive isolation should be imple - mented immediately in any case . Routine clinical visits and labor0atory workout Patients typically require regular follow up visits and lab work out to ensure the early detection of SSc worsening , to diagnose complications , and to monitor the efficacy and toxicity of immunosuppression . In agreement with local institutions , an option is the use of telephone / telemedicine visits to minimize contact exposures [ 42 ] . If a visit is necessary , use of appropri - ate personal protective equipment ( masks , gloves etc ) is man - datory as well as aeration of the visiting room . Timing visits become very important to minimize the presence of people in Clin Rheumatol ( 2020 ) 39 : 2043 – 2047 2045 a room . If laboratory testing can be safely delayed , then con - sideration for this may be made based on good clinical judgment . Psychosocial implications In these challenging times , the psychological implications of the current pandemic should be carefully considered in SSc patients [ 40 ] . The impact of the media daily reports on loss of lives from COVID - 19 is increasing worldwide , especially in patients that have comorbidities and are suffering of chronic diseases [ 41 ] . Moreover , it can be very distressing to hear about the potential shortage of drugs ( Tocilizumab , HCQ ) that patients already use to control SSc . Conflicting reports about both the increased risk of COVID - 19 in immunosuppressed patients as well as a recent statement that patients with auto - immune disease may be protected from getting COVID - 19 by HCQ are not yet confirmed by solid evidence - based data . Social distancing to prevent viral spreading may further add to the psychological distress . The economic consequences and loss of employment affecting our patients and their families can have further implications on patient ’ s quality of life . It is important that physicians remain vigilant on these psycholog - ical , social , and economic implications that may affect the SSc population during the current COVID - 19 pandemic . As we know , stress is a well - recognized trigger for flares of autoim - mune diseases , leading to increase the need for medical inter - ventions . To reduce the risk of contagion , hospitals have suspended routine visits for chronic diseases , except for emer - gencies or oncological conditions . This is an important fact because some SSc patients , likely the frailest among them , require frequent visits . For example , patients with active dig - ital ulcers must undergo weekly wound evaluation . Taken all together , these facts may lead patients to loneliness and dis - orientation . The rheumatologist may help patients in various ways , giving a correct information about COVID - 19 and about the real risk every patient incurs , encouraging continu - ing immunosuppression , and guaranteeing the communica - tion with the doctor in case of need . Conclusion Patients must be confident on clinician ’ s work and extremely cautious . They must be encouraged to maintain their therapies , prevent infection by avoiding social contacts , and pause im - munosuppression in case of infection . Rheumatologists must implement aggressive measures to prevent exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 infection , maintain disease remission , and address psy - chosocial aspects to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients during this pandemic . Although our considerations have no epidemiological background , surprisingly , the number of reported SSc patients infected by COVID - 19 has been reported worldwide . As the epidemiological scenario is rapidly changing daily , we still have no idea about the impact of COVID - 19 in SSc . For this reason , data collection and sharing is of great importance . A registry of Italian Society of Rheumatology on rheumatic dis - eases and COVID - 19 infection is now established , and the data will enter the international registry supported by America College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism and other rheumatologic societies worldwide . Very recently , an international task force under the WSF umbrella has released advices to help the practitioner when dealing with SSc patients [ 42 ] . In the very next future , a shared active scientific investiga - tion will be fundamental to understanding the clinical impli - cations of COVID - 19 in SSc .
