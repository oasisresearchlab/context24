However , the molecular mechanism remained obscure . Here we show that endosomes and proteasome cooperate in phorbol ester 12 - O - tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ) - induced down - regulation of PKC α . We show that following TPA treatment and translocation to the plasma membrane , PKC α undergoes multimonoubiquitination prior to its degradation by the proteasome . However , to reach the proteasome , PKC α must travel through the endocytic system from early to late endosomes . This route requires functional endosomes , whereby endosomal alkalinization , or ablation , abrogates completely PKC α degradation maintaining the enzyme at the plasma membrane . This route also depends on synaptotagmin ( Syt ) II and the Rab7 GTPase , whereby Syt II knock - down or expression of the GDP - locked Rab7 inactive mutant prevents PKC α degradation . We further show that proteasome plays a dual role , where an active proteasome is required for deubiquitination of PKC α , a step crucial to prevent PKC α targeting to the endocytic recycling compartment . Finally , we show that the association with rafts - localized cell surface proteins that internalize in a clathrin - independent fashion is necessary to allow the traf ﬁ cking of PKC α from the plasma membrane to the proteasome , its ultimate degradation station . © 2009 Elsevier Inc .

The proteasome mediates the degradation of proteins , which have failed to pass the quality control mechanisms that operate at the ER [ 1 ] as well as the degradation of no longer needed cytosolic proteins [ 2 ] . The lysosome degrades mem - brane proteins , including cell surface receptors in a signal - dependent manner , as part of their down - regulation process [ 3 ] . However , a tantalizing functional link between the proteasome and lysosome degradation machineries has recently emerged from the observations that the ubiquitin / proteasome system regulates the sorting and degradation of cell surface proteins , including receptors [ 4 , 5 ] and transporters [ 6 ] . However , the precise mechanism of this cooperation remains obscure . A similar link between the two cellular degradative systems , namely the proteasome and the lysosome has not been documented for cytosolic proteins , although protein kinase C α ( PKC α ) , a member of the classical PKCs , has been shown to interact with the endocytic system prior to its phorbol ester - induced degrada - tion [ 7 ] . Studies on the down - regulation of PKC α , following prolonged exposure to phorbol esters such as TPA , have indicated that TPA induces ubiquitination of the kinase and that proteasome inhibitors protect the enzyme from degradation [ 8 ] . However , these studies have also demonstrated that following its TPA - induced translocation to the membrane and activation , and prior to its degradation , PKC α associates with caveolae and endosomes [ 7 , 9 ] . Based on these observations , it was suggested that PKC α is being degraded by two co - existing cellular mechanisms mediated separately by the protea - some and by the lysosome [ 10 ] . However , we envisioned that in analogy to the degradation of membrane proteins , PKC α might be degraded bya yet unexplored mechanism , which involves a functional cooperation between the ubiquitin / proteasome machinery and the endocytic system . In this study , we setuptoinvestigate this possibility . Indeed , using the mast cell line rat basophilic leukemia ( RBL - 2H3 , herein referred to as RBL ) , we demonstrate that the ubiquitin / proteasome and the endocytic system act cooperatively to down - regulate PKC α . 2 .

Proteasome inhibition protects PKC α from degradation We have previously demonstrated that in the cultured mast cell line RBL , TPA - induced degradation of PKC α is prevented by either pretreatment of the cells with ALLN , an inhibitor of the proteasome and calpains , or by knock - down of synaptotagmin II ( Syt II ) , a member of the Syt family of proteins , which we have shown to localize to late endosomes [ 11 ] . These results have suggested the possible involve - ment of both the proteasome and the endocytic system in mediating the TPA - induced down - regulation of PKC α . Therefore , RBL cells may serve as an adequate model to elucidate the relationships between the proteasomal and endocytic degradation machineries that apparently exist in executing PKC α proteolysis . To this end , we ﬁ rst evaluated the relative contribution of each system to the degradation of PKC α . First , we re - examined the involvement of the proteasome by testing the ability of inhibitors considered more speci ﬁ c for the proteasome to prevent PKC α degradation . In the presence of cycloheximide to block new synthesis of PKC α and in the absence of any inhibitors , TPA promoted degradation of PKC α , where 50 % of the protein was Fig . 3 . PKC α interacts with plasma membrane proteins . Cell surface biotinylated RBL cells incubated with or without TPA ( 400 nM ) for 1 h PKC α were then immunopre - cipitated and the immune complexes resolved by SDS / PAGE followed by Western blotting with streptavidin – HRP . Arrowheads point to proteins whose co - immunopre - cipitation with PKC α increased following TPA treatment . 1610 S . Melnikov , R . Sagi - Eisenberg / Cellular Signalling 21 ( 2009 ) 1607 – 1619 degraded already at 45 min from TPA addition and full degradation was recorded at 4 to 6 h ( Fig . 1A ) . Inclusion of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 protected PKC α from degradation , whereby in its presence no signi ﬁ cant reduction in the cellular level of PKC α was recorded even following 4 h of incubation with TPA , conditions that resulted in 90 to 100 % reduction in PKC α level in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor ( Fig . 1B ) . To substantiate these results even further , we have also evaluated the effect of Epoxomicin , a highly selective inhibitor of the proteasome . Again , when cells were incubated with Epoxomicin prior to their TPA treatment , degradation Fig . 4 . Endosomes are essential intermediates in the routeof PKC α degradation . ( A ) RBL cells were incubatedfor 2 h at 19 °C with or without HRP - Tfn ( 20 µg / ml ) , as indicated . Cells were subsequently treated with H 2 O 2 and DAB , as described under Materials and methods and incubated further for 4 h at 37 °C , with or without TPA ( 400 nM ) . Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer comprising 10 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X100 , 1 % deoxycholate , 5 mM EDTA , 2 mM EGTA , 2 mM NaVO 4 , 1 mM PMSF and 1 : 25 cocktail of protease inhibitors and samples of cell lysates ( 40 µg protein / lane ) subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting with anti - PKC α antibodies . ( B ) RBL cells were incubated for 15 min with or without NH 4 Cl ( 20 mM ) prior toTPA treatment for 2 or 4 h as indicated . Cells were lysedand processed as described in A . A representative blot is shown in the upper panel .

Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy . Bars , 10 µm . 1611 S . Melnikov , R . Sagi - Eisenberg / Cellular Signalling 21 ( 2009 ) 1607 – 1619 was prevented and the level of PKC α was maintained by largely unaltered ( Fig . 1B ) . Taken together , these results have ﬁ rmly established the involvement of the proteasome in mediating the TPA - induced down - regulation of PKC α . 3 . 2 . PKC α travels through rafts and endosomes on its route to degradation Because proteasomal inhibition provided full protection against TPA - induced degradation , we next evaluated the contribution of the endocytic system to TPA - induced down - regulation of PKC α . Previous studies using exogenously expressed PKC α have shown that down - regulation of this enzyme involves internalization of the active enzyme through a caveolae - dependent mechanism [ 7 ] . Therefore , we investigated whether TPA induces translocation of PKC α to lipid rafts also in RBL cells . For this purpose , control and TPA ( 30 min ) - treated RBL cells were lysed utilizing Triton X - 100 and fractionated by ﬂ otation on a discontinuous sucrose densitygradient [ 12 ] . As a marker for lipid rafts the distribution along the gradient of GPI fused to YFP was monitored [ 14 ] . This analysis has clearly con ﬁ rmed a TPA - dependent translocation of PKC α to light GPI - YFP - enriched fractions ( Fig . 2A ) . Notably , while fractions 5 – 7 contained both PKC α and GPI - YFP , their distributionwithin these fractions was distinct , whereby the majority of GPI - YFP was recovered in fraction 5 , while fraction 7 was enrichedinPKC α . Theseresultsmaythereforeindicatethedistribution of these proteins to distinct raft subdomains . This notion is consistent withapreviousreport , whichhasdocumented theexistenceofsubsets of lipid rafts , with different properties , in RBL cells [ 15 ] . To investigate whether PKC α also traf ﬁ cs through endosomes , RBL cells were allowed to internalize Alexa - 488 - conjugated transferrin ( Tfn ) for 5 min , in order to label the early endosomal fraction . The localization of PKC α was then monitored in Tfn - loaded and TPA - treated cells . As depicted in Fig . 2 , following 1 h of TPA treatment , PKC α localized to vesicular structures that demonstrated considerable overlap with Tfn ( Fig . 2B ) . Quantitative analysis of the results revealed that approximately 30 % of the total cellular PKC α pixels were colocalized with those of Tfn , compared to only 18 % overlap in untreated cells ( Fig . 2B ) consistent with the notion that PKC α travels through early endosomes following TPA treatment . We have also examined whether PKC α interacts with membrane proteins following its association with the membrane . For this purpose , cells were subjected to cell surface biotinylation prior to the TPA treatment and immunoprecipitation of PKC α . This analysis has demonstrated a clear in vivo interaction between PKC α and a number of cell surface proteins ( Fig . 3 ) . 3 . 3 . EndosomesareessentialintermediatesintherouteofPKC α degradation Toevaluatethecontributionofendosomaltraf ﬁ ckingtodegradation , wehavetakentwoapproaches . The ﬁ rstinvolvedendosomalablationto assess whether or not functional early endosomes are required for TPA - induced degradation . To this end , cells were allowed to internalize HRP - conjugated Tfn and the early endosomes were then selectively inactivated by HRP - catalyzed DAB ( diaminobenzidine ) polymerization [ 16 ] . Because endosomal acidi ﬁ cation is crucial for lysosomal degrada - tion , in the second complementary approach , we evaluated the effect of endosomal alkalinization on PKC α degradation . For this purpose , we have used the aminotroph NH 4 Cl , which interferes with endosomal acidi ﬁ cation and is known to impair receptor - mediated endocytosis . As shown in Fig . 4 , either endosome ablation or alkalinization has prevented PKC α degradation ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Furthermore , analyses of the TPA - treated cells by confocal microscopy revealed that endosomal ablation or alkalinization has prevented PKC α depletion , leaving the enzyme associated with the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4C ) . These results have strongly implicated endocytosis as an essential and exclusive step in PKC α degradation . 3 . 4 . PKC α down - regulation does not require clathrin coated pits formation Because endosomes were proven pivotal for PKC α down - regula - tion , we next investigated whether clathrin coated pits were required . To this end , cells were transfected with an Eps15 mutant which lacks its EH domain . Such mutant was previously shown to exert a dominant negative effect on clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 17 ] . As a control , we have monitored the internalization of Tfn , which is known to internalize by a clathrin dependent mechanism . Indeed , unlike non - transfected cells , whichwere able to internalize Texas Red - conjugated Tfn into endosomes , in cells expressing this mutant , Tfn remained at the plasma membrane indicating their failure to internalize Tfn ( Fig . 5A ) . However , in contrast to its profound effect on endocytosis of Tfn , the Eps15 mutant exerted no effect on PKC α Fig . 5 . PKC α down - regulationdoesnotrequireclathrincoatedpitformation .

Cells were then either incubated with Texas Red - Tfn ( 50 µg / ml ) for 15 min ( A ) or treated with TPA ( 400 nM ) for 4 h ( B ) , as indicated . Cells were subsequently processed for ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( A ) or immuno ﬂ uorescent staining using rabbit polyclonal anti - PKC α antibodies ( 1 : 200 dilution ) followed by Cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit antibodies ( 1 : 400 dilution ) ( B ) .

Sagi - Eisenberg / Cellular Signalling 21 ( 2009 ) 1607 – 1619 degradation ( Fig . 5B ) . Therefore , these results have eliminated clathrin from playing a role in the internalization of PKC α , which precedes its down - regulation . 3 . 5 . PKC α undergoes ubiquitination in response to TPA Consistent with previous reports , TPA was found to induce ubiquitination of PKC α ( Fig . 6A ) . This ubiquitination was transient , as it could be clearly detected at 30 min after TPA treatment but was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( to 35 % of maximal ) by 2 h of treatment ( Fig . 6A ) . Ubiquitinated PKC α was clearly detected already at 10 min after TPA treatment ( Fig . 6B ) . Thus , in view of the fact that even after 30 min of TPA treatment , the majority of the enzyme still resides at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7A ) , ubiquitination of PKC α is most likely to occur at the plasma membrane . Exposingthe cells toTPA in thepresence of theproteasomeinhibitor MG132 prevented the deubiquitination of the enzyme ( Fig . 6C ) . More - over , monitoring the localization of PKC α in cells treated with TPA and MG132 revealed that the enzyme remained distributed between the plasma membrane and a perinuclear localization ( Fig . 7B ) reminiscent of the ERC , a distinct endocytic compartment involved in receptor and lipid recycling [ 18 ] . To substantiate these results further , we have transiently transfected the RBL cells with Rab11 - GFP , a Rab GTPase known to localize to the ERC [ 19 – 21 ] and compared PKC α and Rab11 localization in TPA and MG132 treated cells . Indeed , 40 % of total PKC α colocalized with Rab11 inTPA - treated cells ( Fig . 7B ) , as opposed to only 5 % colocalizationestimatedinuntreatedcells . Therefore , inthepresence of TPA and the proteasome inhibitor , PKC α distributes between the plasma membrane and the ERC . 3 . 6 . Knock - down of Syt II prevents PKC α deubiquitination and deviates the enzyme to the ERC Previously , we have demonstrated that in RBL cells that are stably transfected with Syt II antisense cDNA ( RBL - Syt II − ) , therefore expressing reduced amounts of Syt II [ 11 ] , the half - life of PKC α in TPA - treated cells is increased and the enzyme is distributed between the plasma membrane and the ERC [ 22 ] . Thus knock - down of Syt II imposes a phenotype similar to that of MG132 . Because MG132 concomitantly prevented PKC α deubiquitination , we next investi - gated whether knock - down of Syt II also affects PKC α ubiquitination . Indeed , unlike control RBL cells , in which PKC α ubiquitination was greatly reduced by 2 h ( Fig . 6A ) , in RBL - Syt II − cells , 94 % of PKC α were still ubiquitinated after 2 h of TPA treatment ( Fig . 8 ) . 3 . 7 . PKC α is monoubiquitinated Proteasomal degradation involves polyubiquitination [ 1 ] . However , mono - and multimonoubiquitinations play a role in regulating endocy - tosis and lysosomal degradation [ 4 , 23 ] . Because both the proteasome andtheendocyticmachineryclearlyparticipateinPKC α degradation , we next investigated the nature ( mono or poly ) of PKC α ubiquitination in response to TPA treatment . For this purpose , we used antibodies that differentiate between different forms of ubiquitinated proteins . The P4D1 anti - ubiquitin antibody recognizes both poly - and monoubiquiti - nated proteins [ 24 ] . In contrast , the FK1 anti - ubiquitin antibody recognizes only polyubiquitinated proteins [ 25 ] . As shown in Fig . 9 , ubiquitinatedPKC α wasimmunoreactivewiththeP4D1 , butnotwiththe FK1 antibodies , which did recognize other cellular proteins , unrelated to PKC α ( Fig . 9A ) . These results therefore imply that PKC α is mono - or multimonoubiquitinated in response to TPA treatment in RBL cells . To substantiate further the notion that polyubiquitination is not required for TPA - induced degradation of PKC α , we investigated how overexpression of an ubiquitin mutant , in which lysine 48 has been replaced with arginine [ Ub ( K48R ) ] , would affect TPA - induced PKC α degradation . This mutation renders ubiquitin unable to form polyubiquitin chains through its lysine 48 thereby inhibiting poly - ubiquitin - dependent proteasomal degradation [ 26 ] . Indeed , expres - sion of Ub ( K48R ) did not impair PKC α down - regulation con ﬁ rming that lysine 48 - mediated polyubiquitinationwas not required ( Fig . 9B ) . Fig . 6 . TPA - induced ubiquitination of PKC α . RBL cells were either left untreated or treated with TPA ( 400 nM ) inthe absence ( A and B ) or presence ( C ) of MG132 ( 20 µM ) for 1 / 2 and 2 h ( A ) or 10 and 30 min ( B ) or 2 h ( C ) . Equal amounts of PKC α were then immunoprecipitated ( IP ) from the respective total lysates by using a suboptimal amount ( 2 ng / µg lysate ) of anti - PKC α antibodies as described under Materials and Methods . Immune complexes were captured by protein A - Sepharose , resolved by SDS - PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting ( IB ) with anti - ubiquitin ( anti Ub ) antibodies . Blots were then stripped and re - probed with anti - PKC α antibodies as indicated . 1613 S . Melnikov , R . Sagi - Eisenberg / Cellular Signalling 21 ( 2009 ) 1607 – 1619 3 . 8 . Hrs is dispensable for PKC α degradation Because PKC α is a cytosolic enzyme that in response to TPA treatment , translocates and associates with the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane , its degradation by the lysosome , would require its invagination into multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . Such process is mediated by Hrs , which regulates endosome membrane invagination by binding to internalized ubiquitinated proteins [ 27 ] . This activity requires a functional ubiquitin - interacting motif UIM [ 27 ] and is therefore abrogated by a UIM mutated Hrs . Therefore , if TPA - activated PKC α is destined for degradation through MVBs and lysosomes , then UIM mutated Hrs should hamper PKC α degradation . To test this possibility , we introduced a myc - tagged UIM mutant of Hrs ( HrsS270E ) into the RBL cells and explored the down - regulation of PKC α in transfected cells . As a control , we also introduced this mutant into Hela cells and monitored its impact on EGF - induced degradation of the EGFreceptor ( EGFR ) , aprocess thatis well characterized and known to require invagination into MVBs [ 27 ] . As depicted in Fig . 10 , in the absenceofTPA , bothPKC α andtheHrs - UIMmutantdisplayedadiffused cytosolic pattern of staining . After 4 h of TPA treatment , the amount ofPKC α intheRBLcellswasmarkedlyreducedirrespectivelytowhether or not the cells were expressing the Hrs - UIM mutant ( Fig . 10A ) . This was in sharp contrast to the degradation pattern of the EGFR , where in control non - transfected HeLa cells , 3 h of EGF treatment resulted in a signi ﬁ cant decrease in the amount of EGFR , while in Hrs - UIM mutant expressing cells , EGFR remained in vesicular structures , where it colocalized with the Hrs - UIM mutant ( Fig . 10B ) . These results have con ﬁ rmed the inhibitory activity of the Hrs mutant and have therefore excluded Hrs - mediated invagination into MVBs from playing a role in TPA - induced PKC α degradation . Taken together with our previous results , which have demonstrated the failure of the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin , to prevent PKC α degradation [ 22 ] , the results presented strongly suggest that although endosomes are crucial intermediates in the route of traf ﬁ cking of activated PKC α Fig . 7 .

RBLcells ( A ) orcellstransientlytransfectedwithGFP - Rab11cDNA ( B ) were either left untreated ( ut ) or treated with TPA ( 400 nM ) for the indicated time periods in the absence or presence of MG132 ( 20 µM ) , as indicated .

Rab7 mediates TPA - induced PKC α degradation Recently a direct molecular link was demonstrated between the endocytic and the proteasomal degradative machineries [ 28 ] . Speci - ﬁ cally , the proteasome α subunit XAPC7 was shown to associate with the N - terminal domain of Rab7 , a small GTPase that is involved in the transport of internalized cargo from late endosomes to lysosomes [ 29 ] . Therefore , we explored the possibility that transport through late endosomes might be an intermediate step on the route of PKC α traf ﬁ cking to degradation in the proteasome . Indeed , following 2 h treatment with TPA , 45 % of the cellular PKC α colocalized with GFP - Rab7 ( Fig . 11A ) . Next , we examined whether expression of dominant negative mutant of Rab7 would impair PKC α degradation . Clearly , the GDP - locked dominant negative mutant of Rab7 displayed a prominent effect protecting from PKC α degradation and causing its accumulation in vesicular structures ( Fig . 11B ) . Interestingly , GDP - locked Rab7 accumulated in a perinuclear region in TPA - treated cells , whereas PKC α localized to large vesicular structures ( Fig . 11B ) . Notably , when cells expressing the N - terminus mutated Rab7 were treated with the Fig . 9 . PKC α is monoubiquitinated .

These results have therefore placed the site of the proteasome block upstream of Rab7 and therefore upstream of early to late endosomal traf ﬁ c . 4 . Discussion Comprehensive analyses of the cellular machineries responsible for the degradation of membrane protein , including transporters and cell surface receptors , have ﬁ rmly established a functional link between the endocytic degradation machinery and the proteasome . Moreover , a direct interaction between the proteasome and late endosomes has been demonstrated [ 28 ] . However , a similar relation - ship was not depicted for cytosolic proteins . In this study we explored the relationship between the proteasome and the endocytic network in mediating the TPA - induced degradation of PKC α . Both the proteasome and the endocytic system have been implicated in mediating this process [ 7 – 10 , 30 ] . However , despite the importance of this enzyme and the wealth of studies aimed at elucidating its mechanism of down - regulation , the molecular details of this process still remain elusive . We here demonstrate a novel cooperative link between the endocytic system and the proteasome in mediating the down - regulation of PKC α . Consistent with previous results , we show that the activation of PKC α by TPA is associated with the translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane followed by its delivery to membrane rafts . We also show that the translocation to the plasma membrane is accompanied by ubiquitination of PKC α . However , our results clearly indicate that this ubiquitination does not serve as a targeting signal for proteasomal degradation . First , PKC α is mono - or multimonoubiquitinated rather than polyubiquitinated ; Second , PKC α ubiquitination occurs at the plasma membrane , is transient , and the enzyme is deubiquitinated prior to its degradation . Finally , overexpression of the ubiquitin mutant ( K48RUb ) , which impairs Fig . 10 . Hrs is dispensable for PKC α degradation . ( A ) RBL cells were transiently transfected with myc - Hrs - UIM mutant cDNA . Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h and subsequently left untreated ( ut ) or treated with TPA ( 400 nM ) for 4 h as indicated . The cells were immunostained with anti - PKC α and anti - myc antibodies followed by Cy3 or Cy2 conjugated secondary antibodies , respectively . Bars , 10 µm .

Sagi - Eisenberg / Cellular Signalling 21 ( 2009 ) 1607 – 1619 proteasomal degradation [ 31 ] , does not interfere with PKC α degrada - tion therefore excluding polyubiquitination from contributing to PKC α degradation . We also provide unequivocal evidence that functional endosomes are critical for PKC α degradation . By using both HRP - Tfn - mediated endosome ablation and ammonium chloride to alkalize the early endosomes we have ﬁ rmly established the importance of early endosomes for PKC α degradation . In fact , not only early endosomes , but also traf ﬁ cking from early to late endosomes is crucial for PKC α degradation . This conclusion is based on two pieces of evidence . Previously we have shown that knock - down of Syt II , which localizes to late endosomes , prevents PKC α degradation [ 22 ] . Here we show that a dominant negative inactive mutant of Rab7 , a GTPase that has been implicated in controlling exit from late endosomes , also inhibits PKC α degradation . Such mutant has been shown to prevent the degradation of the EGFR and cause its accumulation in late endosomes , presumably by preventing its transport from late endosomes to lysosomes [ 29 ] . In a similar fashion , the inactive Rab7 mutant inhibits the degradation of PKC α and results in the accumulation of this enzyme in vesicular structures reminiscent of late endosomes . Therefore , taken together , our results advocate Fig . 11 . Rab7mediatesTPA - inducedPKC α degradation .

Bars , 10 µm . 1617 S . Melnikov , R . Sagi - Eisenberg / Cellular Signalling 21 ( 2009 ) 1607 – 1619 endocytosis as an essential step for down - regulating PKC α . Yet , an Hrs mutant , which prevents translocation into MVBs , as indicated by its interference with the degradation of activated EGF receptors , has no impact on PKC α degradation , therefore , suggesting that the enzyme remains associated with the cytosolic face of the endosomes and is therefore unlikely to reach the lysosomal lumen . Consistent with this notion , we have previously shown that unlike inhibitors of the proteasome , the lysosome inhibitor leupeptin cannot protect PKC α from degradation [ 22 ] . What is then the role of the endocytic system in this process ? We propose that the endocytic system serves as the delivery system that is responsible for the apposition of PKC α at the proteasome . Thus , according to our model , while PKC α is degraded by the proteasome , it does not employ the conventional mechanism whereby polyubiquitination serves to hook the substrate to the proteasome . Our results are compatible with a model ( Fig . 12 ) , whereby following its activation and membrane translocation , PKC α interacts with membrane proteins and remains associated with them as they undergo clathrin - independent endocytosis . At the plasma membrane , PKC α is also monoubiquitinated , which most likely facilitates its internalization concomitantly with its partner proteins . At this point , functional endosomes are crucial to allow traf ﬁ cking of the internalized proteins with which PKC α is associated , to the late endosomes . This is a critical step in the down - regulation process as late endosomes comprise the station from which PKC α can be delivered to the proteasome [ 28 ] . Two ﬁ ndings support this notion . First is the demonstration that late endosomes comprise an intermediate compartment in the itinerary of PKC α during its down - regulation process ; second is the fact that in cells expressing an inactive mutant of Rab7 , PKC α is protected from degradation . It should be noted that previous studies have already alluded to the fact that localization of a protein to the proteasome suf ﬁ ces to permit proteasomal degradation irrespectively to the state or nature of its ubiquitination . Monoubiquitinated Pax3 was recently shown to be targeted to proteasomal degradation [ 32 ] and ornithine decarboxylase is degraded by the proteasome without ubiquitination [ 33 ] . Encountering the proteasome results in deubiquitination , which seems to be a prerequisite for PKC α degradation . Notably , a similar role for the proteasome was recently recognized in the degradation process of the TrkA receptor , where deubiquitination by the protea - some was shown crucial for the traf ﬁ cking of the internalized receptor to the lysosome [ 34 ] . Consistent with this notion , we ﬁ nd that the inhibition of the proteasome not only stabilizes the enzyme , but PKC α is deviated to the ERC . Indeed , treatment of cells , which express the inactive mutant of Rab7 with MG132 , prevents the accumulation of PKC α in late endosomes and results in its delivery to the ERC . Similarly , knock - down of Syt II is linked with both prolonged ubiquitination and targeting to the ERC . Therefore , an active protea - some seems to be required for deubiquitination of PKC α to prevent targeting to the ERC and allow its transport to late endosomes prior to its proteolysis by the proteasome . 5 . Conclusion In conclusion , our results implicate proteasome as playing a dual role in mediating the down - regulation of PKC α . Speci ﬁ cally , we show that proteasome controls the targeting of PKC α to the late endosome by facilitating its deubiquitination and it also executes the ﬁ nal proteolysis . Our results additionally demonstrate that PKC α takes advantage of the endocytic system for its delivery process to the proteasome . Thus , the emerging cooperation between the endocytic degradative machinery and the proteasome , previously shown to occur during the turnover of membrane proteins such as cell surface receptors , is not restricted to membrane proteins , but as demon - strated here , does also include cytosolic signaling proteins , such as PKC α .

Model describing the mode of down - regulation of PKC α . According to this model , PKC α undergoes monoubiquitination at the plasma membrane and this post translational modi ﬁ cation serves either as a partition signal into the rafts or as an internalization signal in a clathrin - independent fashion from the rafts . PKC α then localizes to early endosomes at which it undergoes deubiquitination in a process that requires an active proteasome . Ubiquitinated PKC α is then sorted to the ERC , while the deubiquitinated enzyme is delivered in a Syt II - dependent fashion to late endosomes . Finally , from the late endosomes , PKC α is delivered in a Rab7 - dependent fashion tothe proteasome , where it is ﬁ nally degraded . 1618 S . Melnikov , R .
