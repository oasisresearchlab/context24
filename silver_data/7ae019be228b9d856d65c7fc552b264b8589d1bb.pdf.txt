Critchley 4 , Reinhard Fa¨ssler 1 & Michael Sixt 1 All metazoan cells carry transmembrane receptors of the integrin family , which couple the contractile force of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment . In agreement with this principle , rapidly migrating leukocytes use integrin - mediated adhesion when moving over two - dimensional surfaces . As migration on two - dimensional substrates naturally overemphasizes the role of adhesion , the contribution of integrins during three - dimensional movement of leukocytes within tissues has remained controversial . We studied the interplay between adhesive , contractile and protrusive forces during interstitial leukocyte chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro . We ablated all integrin heterodimers from murine leukocytes , and show here that functional integrins do not contribute to migration in three - dimensional environments . Instead , these cells migrate by the sole force of actin - network expansion , which promotes protrusive flowing of the leading edge . Myosin II - dependent contraction is only required on passage through narrow gaps , where a squeezing contraction of the trailing edge propels the rigid nucleus . The current model of metazoan cell migration is frequently described as a multistep cycle : F - actin polymerization at the cell front pushes out a membrane protrusion that subsequently becomes anchored to an extracellular substrate by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family . Integrins are dynamically coupled to the cytoskeleton and transduce the internal force that is generated when myosin II con - tracts the actin network . Contraction imposes retrograde pulling forces on the integrins , which in turn facilitates forward locomotion of the cell body 1 – 3 . The mammalian integrin family consists of 24 different functional heterodimers with individual binding specifici - ties for cellular and extracellular ligands 4 . The integrin repertoire of each cell type defines which substrate it can use for this ‘haptokinetic’ ( adhesion driven ) mode of migration . Such intimate linkage between substrate - specific adhesion and migration restricts the migrating cells to preformed pathways , and thereby creates the determinism that isessential for many of theprecise celltrafficking andpositioning processes underlying compartmentalization and patterning during development and regeneration . As all mammalian cells with the exception of erythrocytes carry integrins on their surface , it is rea - sonable to assume that haptokinesis is a universal phenomenon 4 , 5 . Leukocytes are outstanding cells , as they are scattered throughout the body and have the potential to infiltrate any type of tissue . Rather than following exact routes and being restricted to specific compart - ments , leukocytes frequently undergo stochastic swarming with single cell migration velocities that are up to 100 times faster than mesench - ymal and epithelial cell types 6 , 7 . What makes leukocytes so quick and flexible ? In contrast to slow cells , migrating leukocytes undergo fre - quent shape changes and were therefore morphologically described as ‘‘amoeboid’’ 8 . How these shape changes relate to actual locomotion is poorly investigated , and it is currently unknown if amoeboid migra - tion represents a specialized strategy or just an accelerated variant of the above introduced migration paradigm that is only well established for slow cells . We therefore studied the inter - dependency of adhesion , protrusion and contraction in inflammatory cells . We demonstrate that integrin - mediated adhesion is only necessary to overcome tissue barriers like the endothelial layer , while interstitial migration is auto - nomous from the molecular composition of the extracellular environ - ment . Such adhesion - independent migration is driven by protrusive flowing of the anterior actin network of the cell and supported by squeezing actomyosin contractions of the trailing edge to propel the rigid nucleus through narrow spaces . Dendritic cells migrate without integrins As a model system to study interstitial leukocyte migration in vivo , we focused on dendritic cells ( DCs ) , phagocytes that reside within peri - pheral tissues such as skin . They become activated upon wounding or infection , sample antigens and quickly migrate via the afferent lymph - atic vessels into the draining lymph node where they act as antigen presenting cells 9 . DC migration is primarily guided by the two chemo - kines CCL19 and CCL21 ; these are expressed in lymphatic endothe - lium and the lymph nodes’ T - cell area , and bind the CC - chemokine receptor 7 ( CCR7 ) , which is upregulated on DCs upon activation 10 . Flow cytometric analysis of DCs generated from mouse bone - marrow - derived stem cells revealed expression of the b 1 , b 2 , b 7 and a v integrin families ( Fig . 1a ) . To investigate the role integrins play in DC migration in vivo , we used a combinatorial mouse genetics approach to delete all integrin heterodimers from the surface of DCs , thereby generating phenotypically normal pan - integrin - deficient ( integrin 2 / 2 ) DCs ( Fig . 1a , see Supplementary Material , Methods , and Supplementary Figs 1 , 2 , 4c ) . We co - injected 1 : 1 mix - tures of differentially labelled integrin 2 / 2 and wild - type DCs into the dermis of mouse footpads and quantified their arrival in T - cell areas of the draining lymph nodes . Surprisingly , wild - type and integrin 2 / 2 DCs arrived and localized in the T - cell area in an indistinguishable manner ( Fig . 1b , c , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , whereas CCR7 2 / 2 DCs , which cannot interpret the directional information , failed to enter the lymph node ( Fig . 1c ) as previously described 10 . We next targeted integrin functionality indirectly by deleting the talin1 gene in DCs 1 DepartmentofMolecularMedicine , 2 JuniorResearchGroupCellularDynamicsandCellPatterning , MaxPlanckInstituteofBiochemistry , 82152Martinsried , Germany . 3 Department ofNutritionalMedicine , TechnischeUniversita¨tMu¨nchen , Munich , 85350Freising , Germany . 4 DepartmentofBiochemistry , UniversityofLeicester , LeicesterLE19HN , UK . 5 Institute of Immunology , Hannover Medical School , 30625 Hannover , Germany .

The interaction of talin1 with integrin cytoplasmic domains is required for integrin activation , ligand bind - ing and coupling of F - actin to adhesion sites 11 . Accordingly , talin1 gene ablation in DCs did not affect the levels of integrin expression , but completely abolished their ability to bind ligands ( Supple - mentary Fig . 4b – d ) . Again , arrival of talin1 2 / 2 DCs in lymph nodes did not significantly differ from wild - type DCs ( Fig . 1c ) . To allow for a detailed comparison of the cellular dynamics of wild - type and integrin 2 / 2 DCs within the different physiological environments of their migration route , we employed two in situ imaging approaches ( Fig . 2 ) . Representing the starting point of DC migration , the interstitial space of thedermis is dominated by fibrillar arraysofcollagen bundles 12 . Usinga newlydevelopedset - up of exvivo live cell imaging within explanted ear dermis , we could directly visu - alize DCs moving towards and entering the afferent lymphatic vessels by wide - field microscopy ( Fig . 2b , c , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Single cell tracking revealed no difference in the migratory behaviour of wild - type , integrin 2 / 2 and talin1 2 / 2 DCs ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Thelymphnodeconstitutesafundamentallydifferentenvironment for cellular migration , as it contains almost no freely accessible extra - cellular matrix molecules but is densely packed with lymphocytes and stroma cells 13 , 14 . To analyse the dynamics of intranodal DC migration from the subcapsular sinus towards the T - cell area , we employed a set - up of intravital two - photon microscopy of the popliteal lymph nodes 15 . Evaluating a range of motility parameters , including cell velocity , directional persistence , mean square displacement , motility coefficients and morphology , we found that the movement behaviour of wild - type and integrin 2 / 2 DCs was indistinguishable ( Fig . 2e , f , Supplementary Videos 1 – 3 , data not shown ) . 2D but not 3D migration is integrin - dependent On their way into the lymph node , DCs do not cross significant tissue barriers , such as continuous endothelial or epithelial linings 12 . As these processes have been shown to be integrin - dependent 16 , we also tested for extravasation of integrin 2 / 2 leukocytes from the blood stream into the inflamed dermis , and found that it was indeed abo - lished ( Fig . 2g , Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . This finding corroborates the extravasation model in which integrin - mediated tight immobiliza - tion of leukocytes to the luminal endothelial surface is necessary to counteract the shear forces imposed by the blood flow 16 . In line with this in vivo finding , we found that integrin 2 / 2 DCs were entirely unable to adhere to and migrate on two - dimensional ( 2D ) substrates . Gravity was obviously not sufficient to confine the non - adherent cells to planar surfaces and allow the transduction of traction forces b a 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 48 h WT DC Itg – / – DC Laminin CCR7 – / – Itg – / – DC WTDC β 1 β 2 β 3 β 7 α 4 α 5 α L α M α v α X Itg – / – Tln1 – / – 32 h 48 h 48 h 32 h c R a t i o o f – / – D C i n T c o r t e x B B T B Figure 1 | Migration of integrin - deficient dendritic cells into lymph nodes . a , Flow cytometric analysis of integrin subunits of wild - type ( WT ) and integrin - deficient ( Itg 2 / 2 ) dendriticcells ( DCs ) ( integrin , unshaded ; isotype control , grey - shaded ) . b , c , In vivo migration of DCs after subcutaneous injection into hind footpads of WT mice .

ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 453 | 1 May 2008 52 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 ( Fig . 3a , b , Supplementary Fig . 4d , Supplementary Video 4 ) . We conclude that extravasation requires integrin - mediated adhesion . To better mimic the interstitial microenvironment , we established chemotaxis assays within artificial three - dimensional ( 3D ) matrices of fibrin ( a ligand for b 2 and b 3 integrins ) and collagen I ( a ligand for several members of the b 1 integrin subfamily ) . In this system , DCs persistently migrated along soluble gradients of CCL19 and showed amoeboid morphology and velocities that were comparable to our ( and previously published 17 ) in vivo observations . In agreement with our in vivo data and in contrast to 2D migration , integrin 2 / 2 and talin1 2 / 2 DCs migrated with speed and directional persistence that were indistinguishable from wild - type cells ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Fig . 7a , Supplementary Video 5 ) . We also observed integrin - independent migration for chemotaxing B cells and granulocytes , suggesting a broader prevalence of this functional principle ( Fig . 3d , Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . Functional dissociation of front and back To mechanistically understand how cells can move in the absence of integrin - mediated traction forces , we compared the integrin - dependent movement pattern of fibroblasts with that of leukocytes and found a striking difference . Leading edge protrusions of fibroblasts translocated collagen fibres towards the cell body , indi - cating the presence of rearward pulling forces and demonstrating that protrusion , adhesion and contraction are tightly coupled in this cell type ( Supplementary Video 6 ) 18 , 19 . In contrast , chemotaxing DCs protruded without signs of anterior pulling forces while the trailing edge displayed an irregularly alternating contractile pattern . Con - traction was characterized by shrinkage of the cell rear with con - comitant forward - streaming of cytoplasmic matter ( Supplementary Video 7 ) . When we dynamically visualized activated myosin II , the motor system mediating contraction 1 , 2 , 20 , by time - lapse imaging of DCs expressing a myosin light chain – GFP fusion protein , we found accumulation at the cell rear during contractile phases ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Fig . 8a , Supplementary Video 8 ) . During non - contractile phases , the trailing edge remained motionless and appeared to be passively dragged by the protruding cell front ( Supplementary Video 7 ) . These observations suggest that in contrast to slow moving cells , protrusion and contraction are spatio - temporally dissociated in leukocytes . Receptor - mediated force transduction can only support forward movement if retrograde ( contractile ) but not anterograde ( protrus - ive ) forces are coupled to the environment 2 , 3 . To address how actomyosin contraction functionally contributes to leukocyte loco - motion , we pharmacologically inhibited myosin II or its upstream - activator , Rho kinase . Irrespective of the presence of integrin function , either treatment severely reduced migration speeds of DCs , granulocytes and B cells ( Fig . 4b , Supplementary Fig . 8e , data not shown ) . Nevertheless , the chemotactic gradient was still able to polarize the cell population . The leading edges of cells remained dynamic and protruded with normal speed towards the chemokine source .

NATURE | Vol 453 | 1 May 2008 ARTICLES 53 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 ( Fig . 4b – e , Supplementary Fig . 8b – d , Supplementary Video 9 ) . This functional dissociation between front and back caused up to 30 - fold cell elongation , and demonstrates that the leading edge migrates autonomously and without a need for receptor - mediated coupling of contractile forces to the extracellular matrix . Trailing edge contraction propels the nucleus How does trailing edge contraction contribute to cell body loco - motion ? In fibroblasts and leukocytes moving on 2D substrates , actomyosin contraction at the back is required to disassemble recep - tor binding - sites and subsequently retract the membrane 2 , 21 , 22 . Hence , blocking contraction causes membrane tethers at the trailing edge . Consistent with an adhesion - independent migration mode , we could not observe membrane tethers in myosin II - inhibited leuko - cytes migrating in 3D gels . We considered that the elongated pheno - type with its rounded back was caused by the inability to move an internal resistance through narrow gaps within the gel . As the nucleus is the least elastic cellular compartment 23 , we visualized DNA within chemotaxing DCs and granulocytes . In untreated cells , we observed continuous shape changes of nuclei , indicating deformation forces , while upon myosin II inhibition , spherical nuclei were immobilized at the rear ends of the cells ( Figs 4d , e , Supplementary Fig . 8b – d , Supplementary Videos 10 , 11 ) . Protrusion drives basal locomotion Although ‘locked’ nuclei caused migration arrest in most cells , a few still showed locomotion . This residual migration was often charac - terized by cell body elongation and dragging of the nucleus ( Fig . 5a , Supplementary Video 12 ) . Such non - contractile movement was in line with our previous observations showing motile phases in the absence of trailing edge contractions . We hypothesized that such myosin II - independent migration might occur in areas of the col - lagen gel where external resistance was low due to increased spacing of the collagen fibres . To establish the relationship between internal contractile force and external resistance , we analysed DC chemotaxis in collagen gels of varying fibre spacing ( Fig . 5b ) . In all collagen densities , myosin II - inhibited DCs were slower than untreated cells but importantly , they ‘caught up’ at lowest gel densities ( Fig . 5b , Supplementary Video 13 ) . A comparison of instantaneous velocities further showed that myosin II inhibition did not prevent DCs from reaching the same peak values as untreated cells ( Supplementary Fig . 9a – c ) . We conclude that , in contrast to the ‘blebbing’ model of amoeboid cell migration 24 , cortical actin network contraction does not mediate locomotion itself but rather facilitates a protrusive mode of migra - tion in confined environments where protrusion alone is unable to act against counter - forces . So in constricted areas , the cell overcomes internal and external resistance ( rigidity of the nucleus and fibre density ) by contraction ( myosin II ) . Contractile force deforms the resistance and facilitates a purely protrusive mode of migration . To challenge the concept of protrusive movement , we treated che - motaxing DCs with latrunculin B , which interferes with actin poly - merization by depleting the pool of available functional G - actin monomers 25 . We found that this treatment reduced cell migration velocity in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 5c ) . At intermediate con - centrations , the trailing edge remained contractile and the nucleus was ‘pushed’ to the cell front ( Fig . 5d , Supplementary Video 14 ) . Consistent with a model where protrusion determines the speed of cell migration while contraction is only activated to overcome external resistances , the speed reduction of latrunculin B - treated cells was independent of gel density ( Fig . 5b , c ) . Discussion We show that leukocytes migrate in the absence of specific adhesive interactions with the extracellular environment . This subversion of the metazoan principle makes them autonomous from the tissue context , and allows them to quickly and flexibly navigate through any organ without adaptations to alternating extracellular ligands . This strategy is in stark contrast to the haptokinetic migration prin - ciple that leads along preformed pathways and therefore promotes deterministic positioning . Adhesion independency better suits stoch - astic movement or chemotaxis where cells randomly migrate or fol - low soluble cues . Astonishingly , the protrusive flow of F - actin appears sufficient to drive rapid leukocyte locomotion in environ - ments with large pore - size . This resembles the locomotion principle of nematode sperm cells that is entirely driven by treadmilling poly - mers of major sperm protein 26 . Only in narrow areas do leukocytes activate the contractile module to squeeze and propel the internal resistance of the nucleus in a manner resembling neuronal nucleokinesis 27 . This ‘flowing and squeezing’ migration model fulfils a central requirement for immune cell movement : the pericel - lular environment is transiently deformed but never digested 28 or CCL19 F 2 , 147 = 18 . 9 , P < 0 . 001 H 2 = 53 . 6 , P < 0 . 001 H 2 = 3 . 1 , P < 0 . 22 a b c d B l e bb i s t a t i n B l e bb i s t a t i n 100 n M L a t B 100 n M L a t B S p ee d ( µ m m i n – 1 ) S p ee d ( µ m m i n – 1 ) CC L19 0 0 7 18 14 34 25 45 33 49 38 58 46 61 51 6 4 2 0 0 : 00 1 : 50 2 : 40 3 : 50 5 : 40 6 : 20 7 : 40 6 4 2 0 6 4 2 0 6 4 2 0 0 100 H 2 = 120 . 1 , P < 0 . 001 * * * * * * ns 0 . 75 1 . 5 Collagen ( mg ml – 1 ) 3 * * Latrunculin B ( nM ) 500 64 CCL19 Figure 5 | Myosin II - independent protrusive migration of dendritic cells . a , Two types of residual migration of wild - type ( WT ) dendritic cells ( DCs ) treated with blebbistatin in a standard 3D collagen gel .

ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 453 | 1 May 2008 54 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 otherwise permanently remodelled which avoids ‘collateral damage’ , caused by infiltrating cells . The fact that leukocytes are able to move autonomously generates a new level of regulatory possibilities . Because surface bound chemo - kines and other immobilized extracellular signals do trigger integrin affinity 16 ( unlike soluble chemokines ) , leukocyte integrins should no longer be viewed as force transducers during locomotion but as switchable immobilizing anchors that stop , slow down or confine high intrinsic motility to specifically assigned surfaces 29 , 30 . The role of integrins is therefore mostly to mediate retention , invasion , cell – cell communication and cell – cell adhesion 31 . METHODS SUMMARY Generation of integrin - deficient leukocytes .

NATURE | Vol 453 | 1 May 2008 ARTICLES 55 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 METHODS Generationofintegrin a v 1 / flox mice . Togenerateaconditionalfloxed a v allele , a targeting vector spanning 8 . 2kb of the murine a v integrin locus 37 was con - structed . First , the 2 . 2kb genomic subclone pXB2 . 2 encoding the 5 9 upstream region , exon 1 and part of the intron 1 of the a v gene was used to introduce two loxP - sites . The 5 9 - loxP1 - site including an EcoRI - restriction site to facilitate the identification of the targeted locus was cloned into the HindIII - site in the 5 9 - upstream region ( nucleotide position , nt - pos . , – 310 ) of the a v gene . The 3 9 - loxP2 - site was introduced into the BamHI - site in intron 1 ( nt - pos . 1 528 ) . The genomic subclone pBS6 harbouring this BamHI - site at its 5 9 - end and , 6kb 3 9 - downstream intron 1 sequences was used to clone a pgk - neo ; pgk - tk - tandem gene selection - cassette ( neoTK ) flanked by two frt - sites ( provided by G . R . Martin ) into the BamHI - site . These two modified genomic regions of the a v gene were then fused at the corresponding BamHI - site to obtain the a v gene targeting vector . ES cell transfection , selection and screening was carried out as described 37 except that R1 ES cells 38 were used . Homologously targeted clones wereidentifiedbySouthernblottingofEcoRI - orBamHI - digestedDNAwith5 9 - or 3 9 - external probesAorB , respectively . ToexcisetheneoTKselectioncassette , targeted ES cells ( flneoTK ) were transiently transfected with the CAGGS - FLPe - expression construct 39 ( provided by A . F . Stewart ) and counterselected with ganciclovir . Loss of the selection cassette in the a v floxed allele was then con - firmed by Southern blotting . ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts of C57Bl / 6 mice , and resulting germline transmitting male chimaeras were mated to C57Bl / 6 females to generate heterozygous floxed a v mice and wild - type F1 mice following protocols as described 37 . Two independent lines carrying the a v 1 / flox allele were established and initially maintained on a 129SV / C57BL / 6 mixed background . a v 1 / flox and a vflox / flox mice show no obvious phenotype . Southern blot and PCR analyses : wild - type and mutant a v alleles were assessed by Southern blot hybridization and / or PCR from DNA isolated from ES cells , mouse tail biopsies or from yolk sacs of embryos as described 37 . In brief , 10 m g of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI or BamHI and analysed using radio - labelled 5 9 - external probe A ( 419bp - EcoRI / XbaI DNA - fragment ) or a 3 9 - external probe B ( 690bp - SphI / EcoRI DNA - fragment ) , respectively ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Genomic DNA digested with EcoRI was used to confirm the presenceor absence ofthe selectioncassette withprobeC encodinga 800bp - PstI fragment of the neomycin - resistance gene . For genotyping wild - type ( WT , 1 ) and floxed a v allele ( flox ) as well as the cre - mediatedknockout allele ( a v D ex1 ) , PCR amplifications with genomic DNA and the specific primer set ( see below ) were performed . The positions of the primers are located in close vicinity to the loxP - sites . PCR amplifications using Taq - polymerase and standard reaction buffer adjusted to a final concentration of 1mM MgCl 2 were carried out as follows . PCR samples were initially denatured at 94 u C for 3min , followed by 35cyclesofamplification ( 94 u Cfor1min , 60 u Cfor2min , 72 u Cfor3min ) , and a final 10min extension at 72 u C followed . PCR amplification products were separated through agarose gel electrophoresis . The allele - specific primer sequences , pairs and orientation ( forward , Fw ; reverse , Rev ) , the primer pairs and their corresponding PCR - product sizes are as follows : Primer - set ( F30 : 5 9 - AGGATGGAAGGGGAGGGAAATG - 3 9 ( Fw ; WT ) , F20 : 5 9 - CTTGACCGCAA - GCGCACAGCACAG - 3 9 ( Fw ; WT ) , I2 : 5 9 - CTGGATGCTGAGTGTCAGGT - 3 9 ( Rev ; WT ) ) , PCR products ( F20 / I2 : 499bp ( wild - type a v allele , WT ) ; F20 / I2 : 614bp ( floxed a v allele , a vflox ) ; F30 / I2 : 339bp ( cre - mediated a v knockout allele , a v D ex1 ) ) . Mousestrains . Micewithconstitutivedeletionsofintegrin b 7 , integrin b 2 , CCR7 and conditional b 1flox / flox mice were described 10 , 32 – 34 . All mice were kept on a mixed 129SV / C57BL / 6 genetic background . The integrin targeted strains were inter - crossed with Mx1Cre transgenic mice to generate a vflox / flox , b 1flox / flox , b 2 2 / 2 , b 7 2 / 2 , Mx1Cre 1 / 2 animals . Talin1 flox / flox mice 36 were crossed with Mx1Cre transgenic mice to obtain talin1 flox / flox , Mx1Cre 1 / 2 mice . All control animals were on a mixed 129SV / C57BL / 6 genetic background . The mice were bred in a conventional animal facility at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , and according to the local regulations . Induction of the haematopoietic knockout . At an age between 8 and 12weeks , mice of the desired genotype received a single intraperitoneal injection of 250 m g Poly ( I ) ? Poly ( C ) ( AmershamBiosciences ) , dilutedin0 . 5mlphosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) . Mice were killed 10 – 14d after injection and knockout efficiency of haematopoietic precursors was estimated by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood platelets 40 . Bone marrow ( BM ) of mice with . 85 % integrin b 1 - negative platelets was processed for dendritic cell ( DC ) culture or cell isola - tion . Plateletknockoutefficienciesusuallycorrespondedwithknockoutefficien - ciesofDCsandgranulocytes , whereasperipheralBcellsfrequentlyshowedlower efficiency . Cellgeneration , separationand purification . DCs weregeneratedfromflushed BM suspension as described previously 41 . At day 8 – 10 of culture , 200ngml 2 1 LPS ( Sigma - Aldrich ; E . coli 0127 : B8 ) was added overnight and the pan - integrin - deleted DCs were subsequently depleted of remaining Gr - 1 1 and integrin b 1 1 contaminants . For depletion , cells were incubated with biotinylated antibodies against Gr - 1 ( RB6 - 8C5 ) and integrin b 1 ( Ha2 / 5 ) ( both BD Pharmingen ) , fol - lowed by streptavidin - microbead separation according to the manufacturers protocol ( Miltenyi Biotech ) . The negatively selected DCs used for migration assays were . 99 % enriched for b 1 integrin knockout cells and b 1 - deficient cells were always 100 % deleted for integrin a v . After enrichment the cells are referred toasintegrin 2 / 2 DCs . Talin1 2 / 2 DCsweregeneratedidenticallyanddepletedof Gr - 1 1 contaminants . To determine knockout efficiencies , DC lysates were loaded on 12 – 15 % gradient gels for electrophoresis under reduced conditions and western blotting . Talin was detected with mouse anti - pan - talin antibody ( T3287 , Sigma ) , and the loading control was performed with rabbit anti - mouse actin antibody ( A2066 , Sigma ) . Integrin b 1 was detected with the rabbit poly - clonal anti - integrin b 1 antibody 1244 42 . Integrin a v was detected with a rabbit polyclonal anti - integrin a v antibody ( Chemicon ) . Bound primary antibodies were detected with anti - mouse or anti - rabbit horse radish peroxidase ( HRP ) or anti - rabbit HRP ( both Bio - Rad ) as secondary antibodies , respectively . DCs withnodetectabletalinstainwere chosenforexperiments , guaranteeing thatthe cellsweredeletedfortalin1andthattalin2wasneitherexpressednorinducedasacompensationmechanisminDCs . Granulocytes were isolated by staining whole bone marrow suspension with anti - Gr - 1 PE or anti - Gr - 1 PE / anti - b 1 FITC and subsequentfluorescentactivatedcellsortingusingaFACSAria ( BDBiosciences ) , revealing . 96 % purity . Before incorporation into the gels , granulocytes were treatedfor30minwith20ngml 2 1 TNF - a ( Roche ) at37 u C . Blymphoblastswere generated by mincing spleens through a 70 m m nylon cell strainer ( BD Pharmingen ) , lysing erythrocytes with ACK lysis buffer ( 0 . 15M NH 4 Cl , 1mM KHCO 3 , and 0 . 1mM EDTA ) , and subsequent magnetic cell sorting ( MACS ) with mouse CD43 MicroBeads on LS columns ( Miltenyi ) . The negatively sorted B cells were stimulated with 10 m gml 2 1 LPS ( Sigma ) for 72h at 37 u C , 5 % CO 2 . Streptavidin - microbead separation of integrin b 1 1 cells ( see DCs ) revealed . 98 % pan - integrin - deficient B lymphoblasts that we refer to as integrin 2 / 2 B lymphoblasts . Flow cytometry . Mature DCs were identified as CD11c 1 , MHCII high cells for wild - type and talin1 - deficient cells . For integrin 2 / 2 cells , MHCII high cells cor - respondedto matureDCs as they carried enhanced levels of maturation markers CD86 and CD40 . B lymphoblasts were identified as B220 1 cells , granulocytes as Gr - 1 1 cells . Employed antibodies were against the mouse antigens : Gr - 1 biotin and PE ( RB6 - 8C5 ) , B220 FITC ( RA3 - 6B2 ) , CD11c FITC and biotin ( HL3 ) , I - A / I - E biotin ( 2G9 ) and I - A / I - E PE ( M5 / 114 . 15 . 2 ) ( all from BD Pharmingen ) . For integrin expression profiles , the above cell markers were combined with anti - bodies raised against the mouse integrin chains : a 2 FITC ( Ha 1 / 29 ) , a IIB FITC ( MWReg30 ) , a M PE ( M1 / 70 ) , a 4 PE ( 9C10 ) , a 5 PE ( 5H10 - 27 ) , a 6 PE ( GoH3 ) , a E PE ( M290 ) , a v ( RMV - 7 ) , b 1 biotin ( Ha2 / 5 ) , b 2 biotin ( C71 / 16 ) , b 3 biotin ( 2C9 . G2 ) , b 7 biotin ( 2C3 . G2 ) ( all from Pharmingen ) , a 1 FITC ( HMalpha1 ) , b 4 PE ( 346 - 11A ) ( both from Serotec ) , a L biotin ( M17 / 4 ) ( eBiosciences ) and b 1 PE ( HMbeta1 - 1 ) ( BioLegend ) . The following isotype - matched antibody con - trols were employed : rat IgG2a PE ( B39 - 4 , R35 - 95 ) , rat IgG1 PE ( R3 - 34 ) , ham - ster IgG2 FITC ( Ha4 / 8 ) , hamster IgM FITC ( G235 - 1 ) ( all Pharmingen ) , rat IgG2a biotin , rat IgG2b FITC ( eB149 / 10H5 ) , rat IgG1 FITC ( all eBiosciences ) , hamster IgG PE ( HTK888 ) , hamster IgM biotin ( HTK204 ) ( both BioLegend ) and rat IgG2a PE ( YTH71 . 3 ) ( Serotec ) . Biotinylated antibodies were detected with secondary streptavidin - Cy5 ( Jackson ) . Flow cytometric analysis was per - formed with a FACScalibur and CellQuest Pro Software ( BD Biosciences ) . QuantitativeRT – PCR . RNAwasisolatedfromsortedDCs ( seeabove ) usingthe Absolutely RNA Microprep Kit ( Stratagene ) and the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . One microlitre cDNA , generated from 15ng RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Bio - Rad ) , was subjected to real - time PCR with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) on the iCycler ( Bio - Rad ) . Primers for integrin b 1 5 9 - AGACTTCCGCATTGGCTTTG - 3 9 and 5 9 - GCTGGTGCAGTTTTGTTCAC - 3 9 , and integrin a v 5 9 - CAAGCTCACTCCCATCAC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGGTGTCTT - GATTCTCAAAGGG - 3 9 were used . Integrin gene expression in wild - type and integrin 2 / 2 DCs was quantified with the Gene Expression Analysis Program for theiCycleriQReal - TimePCRDetectionSystem ( Bio - Rad ) . GAPDHwasusedto normalize gene expression , and integrin expression levels in wild - type DCs were set to 1 . In vivo migration assay . Gr - 1 - depleted wild - type and integrin 2 / 2 DCs were labelled with 3 . 5 m M cell - permeable 5 - ( and - 6 ) - carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) or 1 m M tetramethylrhodamine ( TAMRA ) ( both Invitrogen ) , respectively , and vice versa ( the fluorescent labels did not influence DC migra - tion ( not shown ) ) . 1 3 10 6 DCs at a 1 : 1 ratio were suspended in 20 m l PBS and injected subcutaneously into the hind footpads of C57BL / 6 mice . 32 and 48h after injection , mice were killed by CO 2 suffocation , popliteal lymph nodes frozen in cryomatrix ( Thermo ) and sectioned in 12 m m slices . To visualize the doi : 10 . 1038 / nature06887 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 lymph node compartments , methanol - fixed cryosections were stained after blocking with 1 % BSA in PBS with pan - laminin antibody ( L9393 , Sigma ) and secondaryanti - rabbit Cy5 ( Jackson ) . Three different layersof the T cell cortexof each lymph node were documented using an Axio Imager upright microscope ( Zeiss ) . Quantification of DCs within the T cell cortex was performed with MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Using inverse thresholding , the greyscale images of both fluorescence channels were separately binarized . DCs appeared as dots that were quantified using the morphometric analysis tool . The ratio of migrated knockout DCs was calculated as the number of knockout cells divided bythetotalnumberofDCsintheTcellcortex , with0 . 5asthevaluewhere50 % of knockout cells and 50 % wild - type cells located in the centre of the lymph node . To confirm thatfluorescentcells in thelymph noderepresent DCs thatmigrated from the injection site ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , DCs were labelled with 3 m M Cell Trace Oregon Green 488 ( Invitrogen ) . 1 3 10 6 DCs of either wild - type or integ - rin 2 / 2 DCswereinjectedasdescribedaboveand48hlaterDCswereidentifiedas green cells expressing CD86 by flow cytometric analysis . Ex vivo wide - field microscopy in ear dermis . Ears of killed C57BL / 6 mice were removed and mechanically split into dorsal and ventral halves . During separa - tion the dermis detached from the cartilage layer that remained on one of the halves . The cartilage free half was left unfixed and incubated with a rabbit poly - clonalanti - LYVE - 1 antibody ( R & DSystems ) , washedwithPBSandstainedwith a A488 conjugated anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Molecular Probes ) . The stained ears were mounted on custom - made migration chambers with the dermal surface exposed . LPS - matured BM - derived , MACS - purified , TAMRA - labelled DCs ( see above ) were re - suspended in culture medium , added on top of the dermis and incubated for 30min at 37 u C , 5 % CO 2 . After gently washing away non - infiltrated DCs , the ear sheets were imaged in a custom - built climate chamber using a fully motorized upright Leica MZ 16 FA stereomicroscope equipped with a Spot camera and operated via MetaMorph software ( system implemented by Visitron Systems ) . For multiple immunofluorescence stainings ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , ear sheets were fixedwith1 % PFAafter 120minimmig - ration of DCs and stained as described in the extravasation section . Cells were manually tracked using ImageJ as described below . Two - photon intravital microscopy in lymph nodes . Intravital microscopy was performed as described previously 43 . Briefly , BM - derived DCs were matured overnight with LPS , purified and selected by MACS for the desired integrin deficiency ( see above ) , differentially labelled with TAMRA and CFSE and sub - cutaneously injected into footpads of C57BL / 6 mice . After 32h popliteal lymph nodes were surgically exposed and imaged using an upright Leica DM LFSA microscope equipped with a 3 20 0 . 95 NA water immersion objective ( Olympus ) and a MaiTai Ti : sapphire - pulsed laser ( Spectra - Physics ) . 3D cell tracking was performed using Imaris software ( Bitplane ) as described . In vivo ear irritation in bone marrow chimaeric mice . BM chimaera of talin1 flox / flox , Mx1Cre 1 / 2 and a vflox / flox , b 1flox / flox , b 2 2 / 2 , b 7 2 / 2 , Mx1Cre 1 / 2 ani - mals were generated by sublethal irradiation of wild - type mice and immediate reconstitution with 1 3 10 6 suspended BM cells of the indicated genotype . Six weeks after irradiation Poly ( I ) ? Poly ( C ) was injected and 10d later 20 m l of 1 % croton oil ( Sigma ) in acetone 44 was applied on mouse ears . Mice were killed 12h afterapplicationofcrotonoil . Forhistologicalanalysisdorsalandventralhalvesof earsweresubjectedtowholemountimmunostaining . Afterfixationwith1 % PFA , ear halves wereblockedwith1 % BSA ( PAA ) inPBS for 1hatRT ( while shaking ) , stained with anti - Gr - 1 ( RB6 - 8C5 , Pharmingen ) and anti - pan - laminin antibody ( L9393 , Sigma ) in 1 % BSA in PBS overnight at 4 u C ( while shaking ) and washed with 1 % BSA in PBS . Primary antibodies were detected with a repeated cycle of staining with anti - rabbit A488 ( Molecular Probes ) and anti - rat Cy3 ( Dianova ) antibodiesbeforetissuewasembeddedinelvanolandrepresentativeimagestakenwithanAxioImager ( Zeiss ) equippedwiththeApotome . Concentrationofgran - ulocytes in blood was measured by staining peripheral blood with Gr - 1 PE ( BD Pharmingen ) and counting all granulocytes per blood sample by flow cytometry usinga FACSCalibur ( BDPharmingen ) . Thenumbersofgranulocytesthatextra - vasated into ear dermis were quantified by morphometric analysis employing MetaMorph imaging software ( Molecular Devices ) . 3D collagen gel chemotaxis assay . For standard assays , PureCol ( INAMED ) in 1 3 minimum essential medium eagle ( MEM , Sigma ) and 0 . 4 % sodium bicar - bonate ( Sigma ) was mixed with cells in RPMI ( Invitrogen ) , 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS , Invitrogen ) at a 2 : 1 ratio , resulting in gels with a collagen concentration of 1 . 6mgml 2 1 . Final cell concentrations in the assay were 1 3 10 6 cells per ml gel for DCs and 1 . 6 3 10 6 cells per ml gel for granulocytes and B lymphoblasts . For collagen titration experiments , above ratios were adapted . For gels with 3 – 5mgml 2 1 collagen concentration , Nutragen ( INAMED ) was employed . Collagen - cell mixtures were cast in custom - made migration chambers with a thickness of 0 . 5 – 1mm . After 30min assembly of the collagen fibres at 37 u C , the gels were overlaid with 50 m l of the following recombinant chemokines ( all R & D Systems ) diluted in RPMI , 10 % FCS : CCL19 ( 0 . 6 m gml 2 1 , DCs ) , C5a ( 0 . 1 m gml 2 1 , granulocytes ) and CXCL13 ( 2 . 5 m gml 2 1 , B cells ) . For inhibition studies , leukocytes were pre - incubated for 30min with 50 m M blebbistatin ( Sigma ) , 30 m M Y27632 , 100nM or 500nM latrunculin B ( both Calbiochem ) before casting the gels . Inhibitors were also present in the same end - concentrations in the gel . 3D fibrin gel chemotaxis assay . Cells were taken up in 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) human fibrinogen ( IMCO ) in RPMI , 10 % FCS to a final concentration of 1 3 10 6 cells per ml gel . Before casting the gels in custom - made migration chambers , 0 . 125Uml 2 1 thrombin ( Calbiochem ) was added . After 30min polymerization of the fibrin gels at 37 u C , the gels were overlaid with 50 m l of 0 . 6 m gml 2 1 CCL19 ( R & D Systems ) in RPMI , 10 % FCS . Analysis of chemotaxis assays . For comparison of DC velocities in collagen and fibrin gel assays in the absence of inhibitors ( Fig . 3b and SupplementaryFig . 7a ) , movies were converted to kymographs using MetaMorph imaging software . Straight lines in the kymographs represent migrating cells and lead angles were measuredtocalculatesinglecellvelocities .

Speedanddirectionalityparameterswerecalculatedandvisualizedas plots and movies by analysing the acquired data with the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool Plugin ( http : / / www . ibidi . de / applications / ap _ chemo . html ) . For quantification of ‘‘resting’’ and ‘‘moving’’ phases in 0 . 75mgml 2 1 collagen gels ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) instantaneous velocities ( distance per 2min ) were categorized as ‘‘resting’’ if velocity , 1 m m per 2min and ‘‘moving’’ if velocity $ 1 m m per 2min . Average velocities during mobile phases were calculated by excluding the restingfraction . The percentage of resting phaseswas calculated as resting time / ( resting time 1 moving time ) . Time - lapsevideomicroscopy . Lowmagnificationbright - fieldmoviesofDCsin gels were recorded in indicated time intervals using inverted Axiovert 40 ( Zeiss ) cell culture microscopes , equipped with custom - built climate chambers ( 5 % CO 2 , 37 u C , humidified ) andPALcameras ( Prosilica ) triggeredbycustom - made software ( SVS Vistek ) . High magnification DIC and fluorescence movies were recorded using a fully automated Axiovert 200M inverted fluorescence micro - scope with a 40 3 objective ( Zeiss ) and a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera . The microscopic set - up ( Visitron Systems ) was controlled by MetaMorph software . Transfectionandlabellingofcells . DCsweretransfectedwithMLC - GFP ( giftof M . Olson 45 ) betweendays8 – 10 ofculture usingthe primarymouseTcell kitand the Amaxa nucleoporator ( Amaxa ) . Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and immediately after transfection LPS was added for overnight maturation . For nucleus visualization of DCs and granulo - cytes nucleic acid dyes SYTO11 and SYTO13 ( Invitrogen ) were used , respect - ively , according to the manufacturers recommendations . 2D adhesion assays . Adhesion assays were performed in 24 - well plates coated with 10 m gml 2 1 fibronectin ( Calbiochem ) or 10 m gml 2 1 recombinant mouse ICAM - 1 ( R & D ) . 3 3 10 5 DCs per well were seeded in RPMI medium containing 10 % FCSinthepresenceof200ngml 2 1 LPSandincubatedfor30minat5 % CO 2 , 37 u C . Same cell numbers of LPS - maturated DCs were seeded in the presence of 200ngml 2 1 phorbol12 - myristate13 - acetate ( Calbiochem ) for30min . Cellswere washed manually 3 times with PBS , 1 % BSA and subsequently photo - documen - ted and counted manually . Time - lapse video microscopy of chemokine - induced spreading of LPS - matured DCs ( see Supplementary Video 4 ) was performed on 10 m gml 2 1 mouse CCL21 ( R & D ) - coated plastic of cell culture dishes . 37 .
