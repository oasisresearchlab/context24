Wuite Supplementary material Figure S1 Histogram of HBV capsid heights with a double Gaussian fit . The bimodal height distribution of the surface attached HBV capsids has maxima at 26 . 1 ± 0 . 4 nm ( n = 55 ) and 34 . 0 ± 0 . 4 nm ( n = 46 ) . Here n is the number of particles and the uncertainty is the SEM of the fit shown in the figure . Depending on the exact binning parameters the peak values shift maximally 0 . 7 nm around their centre value . These peak value results correspond to the known maximum diameter of the T = 3 particles without the spikes ( 26 . 2 nm ) and the T = 4 particles with the spikes ( 34 . 8 nm ) . Next to the obvious difference in size , two morphological differences between the T = 3 and T = 4 particles can explain the larger than expected difference in height . First , as a result of the higher curvature of the T = 3 capsids , the spikes on these particles diverge more than on the T = 4 particles . Therefore the glass surface and AFM tip will exert a higher perpendicular force on the spikes of the T = 3 particles than of the T = 4 particles . This should result in a higher degree of deformation of the spikes on T = 3 particles . Second , there are ~ 10 % less spikes per unit area for T = 3 particles , which makes the collective deformation of these spikes even easier . Furthermore , the results of Böttcher et al . [ J . Mol . Biol . Vol . 356 , p812 ] indicate that the spikes on T = 3 particles are more flexible than on T = 4 capsids . Despite the differences in approaches , these results seem to correlate with our AFM data . Figure S2 Zoom in on the beginning of the averaged indentation curves of Figure 1 in the main text . The difference in initial indentation behaviour can be explained considering surface features and the AFM height measurements . AFM imaging is performed at a scanning force of 0 . 06 - 0 . 1 nN and the T = 3 particles appear to be imaged without spikes and the T = 4 particles with spikes ( see Fig . S1 ) . The T = 3 graph ( a ) shows an abrupt increase in slope of the experimental curve above F ~ 0 . 04 nN , indicating the pushing aside of the spikes and subsequent indentation of the stiffer shell . For the T = 4 curves ( b ) this increase in slope is much more gradual and continues to increase for forces significantly greater than the maximum scanning force of 0 . 1 nN , indicating a larger force regime over which the spikes are pushed aside and / or indented . This explains why the T = 4 particles are imaged with and the T = 3 particles without spikes . The 3D simulations are performed with relatively low spikes , due to a lower atom density in the spikes than in the rest of the capsid . Therefore one expects a good fit between the beginning of the T = 3 experimental and 3D simulation curves and a T = 4 experimental curve which is lower in the beginning than the 3D simulation curve . This is exactly what is observed . The FvK simulations are performed on thin shells without surface features and therefore no specific non - linearities are expected at the onset of indentation , nor are they observed . Figure S3 Testing alternative averaged curves for T = 3 and T = 4 particles . The thick averaged curves , in green with the error bars ( SEM ) in black , are the same as in Fig . 1 for T = 3 ( a ) and T = 4 ( b ) capsids . To test the significance of this average we randomly removed either 15 % or 30 % of the curves and subsequently averaged the rest , resulting in 16 new averaged curves for each capsid type . From this bootstrap - inspired procedure we see that for T = 3 capsids both the 15 % and 30 % deletion averaged curves fall within the SEM of the total average . The 15 % deletion averaged curves for T = 4 also fall within the SEM of the total average , but two averaged curves of the 30 % deletion set clearly fall outside this range . However , the curves that fall outside the SEM still show the general non - linear behaviour of the other curves , indicating the robustness of our total average in describing non - linear indentation behaviour . Figure S4 Thin shell simulations for various FvK numbers γ . ( a ) Indentation along the 2 - fold symmetry axis . ( b ) Indentation along the 3 - fold symmetry axis . ( c ) Indentation along the 5 - fold symmetry axis . ( d ) Weighted averages of indentation along the 2 - , 3 - and 5 - fold axis . Although the details are different when indentation is simulated along the various symmetry axes , the trend of increasing non - linearity with increasing FvK number is the same for all orientations . Table S1 Number of experimental curves that were “binned” in each orientation . In the 3D line the number of experimental curves , for the respective orientations , as obtained by analysing the 3D finite element results ( see Materials and Methods ) , are listed . The distribution of occurrence of the various symmetry sites for both the T = 3 and T = 4 morphologies is as expected ( see main text ) . In the thin shell case it can be observed , by looking at the insets in figure 3 , that almost no distinction can be made between the 2 - and 3 - fold symmetry axes . Therefore the results for these orientations are listed together . It is important to note that attempts to bin the experimental data using the thin shell simulation results produced a ratio of the number of capsids lying on the various symmetry sites that is inconsistent with the frequency of these sites occurring on an individual capsid .
