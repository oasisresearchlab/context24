Matsudaira To evaluate whether (cid:1) - smooth muscle actin ( (cid:1) - SMA ) plays a role in ﬁbroblast contractility , we ﬁrst compared the contractile activity of rat subcutaneous ﬁbroblasts ( SCFs ) , expressing low levels of (cid:1) - SMA , with that of lung ﬁbroblasts ( LFs ) , expressing high levels of (cid:1) - SMA , with the use of silicone substrates of different stiffness degrees . On medium stiffness substrates the percentage of cells producing wrinkles was similar to that of (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells in each ﬁbroblast population . On high stiffness substrates , wrinkle production was limited to a subpopulation of LFs very positive for (cid:1) - SMA . In a second approach , we measured the isotonic contraction of SCF - and LF - populated attached collagen lattices . SCFs exhibited 41 % diameter reduction compared with 63 % by LFs . TGF (cid:2) 1 increased (cid:1) - SMA expression and lattice contraction by SCFs to the levels of LFs ; TGF (cid:2) - antagonizing agents reduced (cid:1) - SMA expression and lattice contraction by LFs to the level of SCFs . Finally , 3T3 ﬁbroblasts transiently or permanently transfected with (cid:1) - SMA cDNA exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher lattice contraction compared with wild - type 3T3 ﬁbroblasts or to ﬁbroblasts transfected with (cid:1) - cardiac and (cid:2) - or (cid:3) - cytoplasmic actin . This took place in the absence of any change in smooth muscle or nonmuscle myosin heavy - chain expression . Our results indicate that an increased (cid:1) - SMA expression is sufﬁcient to enhance ﬁbroblast contractile activity . INTRODUCTION Early during healing of an open wound , resident dermal ﬁbroblasts proliferate from the wound margin and migrate into the provisional matrix composed of a ﬁbrin clot . About 1 week after wounding , the provisional matrix is replaced by neo - formed connective tissue , known as granulation tissue , essentially composed of small vessels , extracellular matrix , and ﬁbroblastic cells that become activated and modulate into myoﬁbroblasts . The main feature of myoﬁbroblasts is represented by an important contractile apparatus similar to that of smooth muscle ( Gabbiani et al . , 1971 ) , and in partic - ular by the neo - expression of (cid:1) - smooth muscle actin ( (cid:1) - SMA ) , the actin isoform typical of vascular smooth muscle cells ( Skalli et al . , 1986 ) . Myoﬁbroblasts are recognized to play a central role in closing the wound tissue , through their capacity to produce a strong contractile force ( for review see Grinnell , 1994 ; Rønnov - Jessen et al . , 1996 ; Powell et al . , 1999 ; Serini and Gabbiani , 1999 ) , possibly generated within stress ﬁbers , similar to those present in cultured ﬁbroblasts ( Skalli et al . , 1986 ; Serini and Gabbiani , 1999 ) . Because wound con - traction takes place when de novo expressed (cid:1) - SMA is in - corporated in stress ﬁbers ( Darby et al . , 1990 ) , it has been suggested that this actin isoform plays an important role in granulation tissue contraction ( for review see Serini and Gabbiani , 1999 ) . Although stress ﬁbers have been proposed to function as contractile organelles ( Burridge , 1981 ; Katoh et al . , 1998 ) and their presence has been correlated with the production of isometric tension ( Harris et al . , 1981 ) , at present direct evidence of a functional role of (cid:1) - SMA in ﬁbroblast contraction is lacking . Here , we have used several in vitro models and approaches in order to test the possible correlation between the expression of (cid:1) - SMA and the con - tractile activity of ﬁbroblastic cells . It is more and more accepted that ﬁbroblastic cells are heterogeneous ( for review see Komuro , 1990 ; Serini and Gabbiani , 1999 ) . A marker of ﬁbroblast heterogeneity is the differential expression of cytoskeletal proteins , including ac - tin isoforms ( Sappino et al . , 1990 ) . When grown in culture , ﬁbroblasts from different organs constantly modulate into † Corresponding author . E - mail address : Giulio . Gabbiani @ medecine . unige . ch .

We have exploited this heterogeneity to compare the contractile po - tential of cultured rat subcutaneous ﬁbroblasts ( SCFs ) , ex - pressing low levels of (cid:1) - SMA , with lung ﬁbroblasts ( LFs ) , expressing high levels of (cid:1) - SMA ( Xu et al . , 1997 ; Dugina et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , we have enhanced the expression of (cid:1) - SMA in SCFs by treatment with transforming growth factor (cid:2) ( TGF (cid:2) ; Desmoulie ` re et al . , 1993 ; Rønnov - Jessen and Petersen , 1993 ) . Conversely , we have reduced (cid:1) - SMA ex - pression in LFs by blocking the activity of endogenous TGF (cid:2) 1 with a speciﬁc neutralizing antibody , the soluble TGF (cid:2) - receptor type II ( TGF (cid:2) - sR ) or the recombinant ED - A fragment ( rED - A ) of cellular ﬁbronectin ( FN ; Serini et al . , 1998 ) . Finally , in a direct approach to induce expression of (cid:1) - SMA , we have transiently and stably transfected Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts with (cid:1) - SMA cDNA . To determine contractility on a single cell level , we used a modiﬁcation of the silicone elastomer substrate assay origi - nally developed by Harris et al . ( 1980 ) , combined with a modiﬁcation of the force quantiﬁcation method introduced by Lee et al . ( 1994 ) . The contractility of whole cell popula - tions was quantiﬁed with the use of stress - released collagen lattices ( Mochitate et al . , 1991 ; Tomasek et al . , 1992 ; Grinnell et al . , 1999b ) . Our results indicate a correlation between the level of (cid:1) - SMA expression and ﬁbroblast contraction . In addition , we provide new insights into the interdependence of TGF (cid:2) 1 and ED - A FN in regulating myoﬁbroblast contrac - tile activity . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture Fibroblasts from explants of rat subcutaneous and lung tissues and 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were cultured as described previously ( Desmoulie ` re et al . , 1992 ) . Experiments with primary cell cultures between pas - sage 4 and 8 were performed in MEM ( Life Technologies AG , Basel , Switzerland ) , supplemented with 10 % FCS or with 4 % Monomed , a deﬁned medium in which ﬁbroblasts do not replicate ( Common - wealth Serum Laboratories , Melbourne , Australia ; Serini et al . , 1998 ) . TGF (cid:2) 1 ( R & D Systems , Inc . , Minneapolis , MN ) or TGF (cid:2) 2 ( 10 ng / ml ; gift from Dr . A . Cox , Novartis , Basel , Switzerland ) , TGF (cid:2) - sR ( Lin et al . , 1995 ; 0 . 1 – 100 ng / ml , gift of Biogen Inc . , Cambridge , MA , Komesli et al . , 1998 ) and TGF (cid:2) 1 - neutralizing antibody ( 0 . 01 – 10 (cid:4) g / ml , R & D Systems ) were added for 5 d to the culture medium . rED - A ( gift of Biogen Inc . ) was incorporated at 300 (cid:4) g / ml ( Serini et al . , 1998 ) into collagen lattices ( see below ) . Deformable Silicone Substrates and Single Cell Force Measurement Deformable silicone substrates were essentially prepared as de - scribed previously ( Harris et al . , 1980 ) . Fifty microliters of silicone ( poly dimethyl siloxane ; 30 , 000 centistokes ; Dow Corning , Midland , MI ) were deposited onto a 35 - mm round glass coverslip , which was placed into a six - well plate and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 2 min with the use of a swinging rotor . The silicone surface was then cross - linked by passing it through a Bunsen ﬂame . A rubber ring was sealed with a polyvinylsiloxane dental resin ( President Micro - Systems ; Colte ` ne , Altsta¨tten , Switzerland ) on the coverslip , result - ing in a small chamber containing at the bottom the cross - linked silicone . Silicone substrates were equilibrated with 0 . 1 % gelatin in Tris - HCl buffer , pH 8 . 4 , sterilized by UV light exposure , and left overnight in the incubator at 37°C . To compare SCFs and LFs for their capacity to produce wrinkles and for (cid:1) - SMA expression , after preliminary experiments the ﬂam - ing time of 1 s was used ; this restricted wrinkle formation to ﬁbroblasts with high contractile force ( see RESULTS ) . Cells ( 30 , 000 ) were seeded onto the silicone and grown for 5 d in MEM / 10 % FCS ( (cid:1) TGF (cid:2) ) . The percentage of cells producing wrinkles was related to the number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells grown in parallel on culture dishes ( 30 , 000 cells / 30 mm dish ; Nunc , Life Technologies ) , as quan - tiﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence . To visualize wrinkling and (cid:1) - SMA expression simultaneously , ﬁbroblasts were directly ﬁxed on the silicone substrates and immunostained ( see below ) . (cid:1) - SMA – posi - tive and wrinkling ﬁbroblasts were calculated as percentage of total cells with the use of a program after manual cell selection on a computer screen ( KS400 ; Carl Zeiss Inc . , Jena , Germany ) . Ten ran - dom regions of interest were analyzed per experiment ( (cid:2) 25 cells / ﬁeld ) , and at least 5 experiments were performed . To quantify the force exerted by individual ﬁbroblasts , we pro - duced deformable silicone substrates with different degrees of me - chanical resistance by modulating the ﬂaming time ( 0 . 5 – 4 s ) . Before seeding cells , these substrates were mechanically wrinkled with a deﬂecting ﬂexible microneedle with a stiffness between 90 and 110 nN / (cid:4) m ( Lee et al . , 1994 ; Fray et al . , 1998 ) . A second stiff needle ( (cid:5) 50 (cid:4) N / (cid:4) m ) was used to ﬁx the substrate at a distance of 200 (cid:4) m , simulating the substrate - pinching of bipolar cells . The force re - quired to produce ﬁrst wrinkles on different silicone substrates was calculated from the ﬂexible needle stiffness ( (cid:4) N / (cid:4) m ) and deﬂection ( (cid:4) m ; Oliver et al . , 1995 ) on 15 different regions . LFs were then grown on these substrates and immunostained , and the percentage of wrinkling cells of (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs and of (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs were calculated separately as described above . Stressed Collagen Lattice Contraction Assay To correlate the contractile potential and the level of (cid:1) - SMA expres - sion in cell populations , ﬁbroblasts were grown in attached ( Grin - nell , 1994 ) collagen type I lattices ( 0 . 75 mg / ml ) as previously de - scribed ( Tomasek et al . , 1992 ; Pilcher et al . , 1994 ; Rayan et al . , 1996 ) . Populations were initiated with 0 . 25 – 10 . 0 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml collagen , depending on the presence of serum , the cell type , and the myoﬁ - broblastic differentiation , and cultured for 5 d . Lattices populated with transiently transfected 3T3 ﬁbroblast were cultured for 2 d in order to work at their maximum transgene activity , determined by immunoﬂuorescence and Western blotting ( see below ) . For contrac - tion measurement , lattices were released with the use of a syringe and lattice diameter was measured under dark - ﬁeld illumination after 5 , 10 , and 30 min . Only maximum contraction after 30 min is presented . A minimum of ﬁve lattices was assayed per experimental condition , mean values were calculated , and lattice diameter reduc - tion was normalized to the lattice diameter before release ( (cid:4) % contraction ) . Collagen lattices were then digested , and cells were harvested and counted as previously described ( Vaughan et al . , 2000 ) . Contraction results were only considered if cell concentration ranged between 5 . 7 (cid:3) 10 4 and 6 . 3 (cid:3) 10 4 cells / lattice at the time of release . All experiments were performed at least ﬁve times . Antibodies and Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Cells grown in collagen lattices and on plastic culture dishes were ﬁxed with 3 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS containing 1 mM CaCl 2 ( PBS / Ca 2 (cid:5) ) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) in PBS / Ca 2 (cid:5) for 5 min . To test myosin expression , cells were ﬁxed with 100 % ethanol for 30 s . To simultaneously observe wrinkles and (cid:1) - SMA – positive stress ﬁbers , silicone - coated coverslip chambers were transferred rapidly from culture medium in prewarmed ( 37°C ) 3 % PFA in PBS / Ca 2 (cid:5) , ﬁxed for 15 min at 37°C , rinsed with PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % TX - 100 in PBS / Ca 2 (cid:5) for 5 min , and immunostained . Care was taken that the silicone surface remained wet for the whole procedure . Fibroblast Contraction Vol . 12 , September 2001 2731 Cells were stained for (cid:1) - SMA ( anti - (cid:1) SM - 1 , IgG2a mAb ; Skalli et al . , 1986 ) , F - actin ( Phalloidin - Alexa 488 , Molecular Probe , Eugene , OR ) , (cid:2) - cytoplasmic ( (cid:2) 74 , rbAb ; Yao et al . , 1995 ) , (cid:1) - sarcomeric actin ( SR - 1 , IgM mAb ; Dako ) , (cid:3) - actins and (cid:1) - SMA ( AAL - 20 , rbAb ) , ED - A FN ( IST - 9 , IgG1 mAb , gift from Dr . L . Zardi , National Institute for Cancer Research , Laboratory of Cell Biology , Genoa , Italy ; Borsi et al . , 1987 ; Carnemolla et al . , 1987 ) , VSV - G - tag ( anti - VSV - G - tag , rbAB , a gift of Dr . J . - C . Perriard , ETH , Zu¨rich , CH ) , the heavy chains ( HC ) of SMM and NMM ( anti - SMMHC and anti - NMMHC , rbAbs ; Ben - zonana et al . , 1988 ) and DNA ( DAPI ) . As secondary antibodies TRITC - and FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a ( Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc . , Birmingham , AL ) , IgG , IgM , and goat anti - rabbit antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) were used . Cells on plastic and collagen lattices were mounted in polyvinyl alcohol ( Lennette , 1978 ) ; cells on silicone were covered with PBS , and chambers were sealed with a coverslip with the use of dental resin ( President MicroSystems ) . All samples were observed with an oil immersion objective ( Plan - Neoﬂuar 40 (cid:3) / 1 . 3 , Ph3 ; Zeiss ) on an Axiophot Zeiss microscope ( Zeiss ) . Digital images were taken with a digital color camera ( Coolview ; Photonic Science Ltd . , Millham , UK ) and grab - ber software ( ImageAccess V2 . 04K ; Imagic Bildverarbeitung AG , Glattbrugg , Switzerland ) . Inside three - dimensional collagen lattices the number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbroblasts was automatically detected by a color thresh - olding routine ( KS400 ; Zeiss ) on images taken with a 20 (cid:3) objective ( Zeiss ) and related to the total cell number , determined by DAPI staining . Mean values were calculated from ﬁve independent ex - periments , analyzing ﬁve ﬁelds per lattice and ﬁve lattices per condition . All digital images were processed for printing with the use of Adobe Photoshop and printed with a digital Fujiﬁlm Pictrog - raphy 4000 printer ( Fuji Photo Film GmbH , Du¨sseldorf , Germany ) . Western Blot Analysis Fibroblast grown on plastic culture dishes were sampled as previ - ously described ( Chaponnier et al . , 1995 ) . Fibroblasts harvested from collagen lattices ( see above ) were suspended in sample buffer ( 1 . 25 (cid:3) 10 6 cells / ml ) , sonicated , and boiled for 3 min . Protein content was determined with the use of a 1 (cid:4) l protein assay ( dot - Metric ; Geno Technology Inc . , St . Louis , MO ) . Equal amounts of total proteins ( 5 – 10 (cid:4) g ) were loaded to 10 % or 7 % SDS - minigels ( Bio - Rad Laboratories AG , Glattbrugg , Switzerland ) , separated by PAGE ( Laemmli , 1970 ) , and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane ( Protran , BA85 ; Schleicher & Schuell , Dassel , Germany ; Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . Membranes were then probed with the same primary antibodies used for immunoﬂuorescence . Total actin was probed with the use of a mixture of antibodies against the different isoforms ( see above ) . Incubations were followed by secondary antibodies goat anti - mouse IgG and goat anti - rabbit IgG , respectively , conju - gated with horseradish - peroxidase ( HRP ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) . Signals were detected by ECL chemiluminescence ( Amersham , Rahn AG , Zu¨rich , Switzerland ) . Bands were digitized with a scanner ( Arcus II ; Agfa , Ko¨ln , Germany ) and the ratio be - tween all band densities of 1 blot was calculated by computer software ( ImageQuant V3 . 3 ; Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Relative (cid:1) - SMA expression was normalized to the respective value for total actin in primary cells ; in transfected cells VSV - G - tag ex - pression was normalized to vimentin . Actin Constructs and Transfection The actin constructs used in our experiments were described by von Arx et al . ( 1995 ) and their sorting in several cell types was reported previously ( Mounier et al . , 1997 ) . For transient and stable transfec - tions , we used a pCMV (cid:2) vector ( Clontech Laboratories AG , Basel , CH ) , in which the neomycin gene was cloned in Eco RI and in which the (cid:2) - galactosidase gene was replaced by full - length cDNA encod - ing rat (cid:1) - SMA , human (cid:3) - and (cid:2) - cytoplasmic actins , and chicken (cid:1) - cardiac muscle actin . The 3 (cid:6) untranslated region ( 3 (cid:6) UTR ) of actin isoforms was replaced by cDNA coding for the vesicular stomatitis virus G - protein ( VSV - G ; Soldati and Perriard , 1991 ) , thus tagging the actins on C terminus . 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were transfected with the use of FuGene 6 ( Boehringer Mannheim AG , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . To produce stable clones , transfected cells were split after 24 h and resuspended ( 1 : 50 ) in culture medium containing 1 . 5 mg / ml selection factor G418 ( Pro - mega , Madison , WI ) . After 7 d , colonies of (cid:6) 10 cells were isolated with the use of a 5 - mm metal ring , trypsinized , and subcloned under G418 selection . Each clone was tested for expression of the transfected protein by Western blotting and by immunostaining for VSV - G - tag and the respective actin isoform . Statistical Analysis Numerical results are presented as the means (cid:1) SD of all experi - ments . Mean values were tested by a two - tailed heteroscedastic Student’s t test . Differences were considered to be statistically sig - niﬁcant at values of p (cid:6) 0 . 01 . p values (cid:6) 0 . 005 were indicated by an asterisk ( * ) and with a double - asterisk ( * * ) for p (cid:6) 0 . 001 . The positive linear correlation between ﬁbroblast contraction and (cid:1) - SMA expres - sion was statistically tested by calculating the square of the Pearson correlation product ( r 2 value ) . RESULTS Wrinkle Formation on Deformable Silicone Substrates Correlates with (cid:1) - SMA Expression SCFs and LFs , expressing different levels of (cid:1) - SMA ( Figure 1A ; Western blot ) , exhibited different proportions of cells deforming the surface of 1 - s ﬂamed silicone ( Figure 1 ) . Only 20 % of the ﬁbroblasts derived from subcutaneous tissue produced wrinkles on the silicone ﬁlm after 3 d ( Figure 1A ) . The proportion of wrinkle - producing cells correlated with the proportion of (cid:1) - SMA – positive SCFs ( 18 % ) determined after immunoﬂuorescence staining on plastic dishes . When rat LFs were tested , 79 % produced wrinkles , and 80 % were (cid:1) - SMA – positive . To further investigate the correlation be - tween contracting cells and (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells , SCFs were treated for 3 d with 10 ng / ml TGF (cid:2) 1 , previously shown to increase (cid:1) - SMA expression in cultured ﬁbroblasts ( Desmou - lie ` re et al . , 1993 ; Rønnov - Jessen and Petersen , 1993 ) . TGF (cid:2) 1 signiﬁcantly enhanced the proportion of SCFs producing wrinkles on silicone to 52 % . Concomitantly , 53 % of SCFs expressed (cid:1) - SMA on plastic . TGF (cid:2) 2 caused similar effects ( data not shown ) . TGF (cid:2) treatment of LFs did not enhance wrinkling and (cid:1) - SMA expression signiﬁcantly . The correla - tion factor between the number of wrinkle - producing cells and the number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells was r 2 (cid:4) 0 . 99 . TGF (cid:2) did not induce the expression of SMMHC . When (cid:1) - SMA was stained ( Figure 2B ) on silicone substrates ( 1 s ﬂaming ) , in which wrinkles were preserved ( Figure 2A ) , it became evident that practically only (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells deformed the silicone surface ( Figure 2D ) . Fixation did not change the proportion of wrinkle - producing cells ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . Both , nonwrinkling (cid:1) - SMA – negative and wrin - kling (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbroblasts exhibited a well - spread morphology and an F - actin – positive cortex . In (cid:1) - SMA – pos - itive ﬁbroblasts stress ﬁbers were generally more prominent and more organized in parallel bundles throughout the cy - toplasm compared with (cid:1) - SMA – negative cells ( Figure 2C ) . Interestingly , stress ﬁbers appeared to be thinner in ﬁbro - blasts on silicone compared with ﬁbroblasts grown on plas - B . Hinz et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2732 tic Petri dishes , possibly reﬂecting the different resistance of the two substrates ( Harris et al . , 1981 ) . Quantifying the pro - portion of wrinkle - producing cells that were (cid:1) - SMA - posi - tive on the 1 s - ﬂamed silicone led to a percentage of 90 % , independently of the total number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells ( Figure 1B ) . The stiffness of the silicone substrate surface provided a threshold to distinguish between contractile , surface - wrin - kling cells and less contractile , nonwrinkling cells . To com - pare the forces exerted by single (cid:1) - SMA – positive and – neg - ative ﬁbroblasts , we produced silicone substrates with varying stiffness by gradually increasing the ﬂaming time ( Figure 3 , bar ) and determined the force required to cause wrinkles in these ﬁlms . Increasing substrate stiffness re - quired approximately linearly increasing wrinkling force and showed little local variance within the same substrate ( (cid:6) 1 % ) . However , the thin silicone ﬁlm at the substrate pe - riphery showed signiﬁcantly higher resistance ( 18 (cid:1) 2 % ) compared with the central part . Hence , the peripheral 5 mm were not considered for quantiﬁcation . When a force of (cid:2) 1 . 5 (cid:4) N was required , virtually all (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs but only 60 % (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs produced wrinkles ( Figure 3 ) . The largest difference between the percentages of (cid:1) - SMA – posi - tive and of (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs producing wrinkles ( 89 % vs . 16 % ) was observed on substrates that required a wrin - kling force of (cid:2) 4 . 0 (cid:4) N . By further increasing the substrate stiffness , i . e . , when a force of (cid:2) 6 . 0 (cid:4) N was required , wrin - kles were produced essentially by (cid:1) - SMA – positive and only by (cid:7) 5 % of (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs . When the stiffness of the substrate required a wrinkling - force of (cid:2) 8 . 5 (cid:4) N , 27 % of (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs but none of the (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs were capable of producing wrinkles . Contraction of Fibroblast - populated Collagen Lattices Correlates with (cid:1) - SMA Expression When released from the culture dish after 5 d ﬁbroblast - populated attached collagen lattices contracted rapidly and reached maximal contraction after 30 min . The contractile potential of SCF populations , expressing low levels of (cid:1) - SMA , was again compared with that of LF populations , expressing high amounts of (cid:1) - SMA . For a given cell type , the degree of contraction was dependent on the number of ﬁbroblasts populating the lattice at the time of release . How - ever , at any comparable cell number , LFs contracted the lattices signiﬁcantly more than SCFs . The largest difference was observed at 6 (cid:3) 10 4 cells / lattice , where both popula - tions exhibited maximal contraction . SCFs caused a 41 % lattice contraction compared with a 63 % contraction for LFs ( Figure 4A ) . Treating SCFs with 10 ng / ml TGF (cid:2) 1 during 5 d increased lattice contraction to 63 % , thereby reaching the level of LFs . TGF (cid:2) 1 - treatment showed no enhancing effect on LF contraction ( 63 % ) . Again , no differences were ob - served between the effects of TGF (cid:2) 1 and TGF (cid:2) 2 . In a second approach , the action of endogenous TGF (cid:2) was neutralized by applying TGF (cid:2) - sR to collagen lattices for 5 d ( Figure 4A ) . Increasing the concentration of TGF (cid:2) - sR in steps of one order of magnitude ( 1 . 0 – 100 ng / ml ) reduced LF contraction gradually from 63 % to a minimum of 38 % , thereby reaching the level of control SCFs . The contractility of SCFs was not affected by 100 ng TGF (cid:2) - sR . Similar results were obtained by blocking TGF (cid:2) action with a TGF (cid:2) 1 - neutralizing antibody in concentrations between 0 . 1 and 10 (cid:4) g / ml for 5 d . These results are in accordance with the possibility that LFs in collagen lattices maintain a high level of (cid:1) - SMA expression by autocrine stimulation with TGF (cid:2) . Lattices were digested after contraction experiments , and cellular proteins were blotted to evaluate (cid:1) - SMA and total actin levels ( Figure 4B ) . (cid:1) - SMA expression was lower in SCF populations compared with LFs . The level of (cid:1) - SMA in SCFs was enhanced by TGF (cid:2) treatment and reduced in LFs by blocking TGF (cid:2) effect with TGF (cid:2) - sR ( Figure 4B ) or anti - TGF (cid:2) 1 antibody . The level of total actin remained constant at all conditions tested . Protein content analysis was com - plemented by staining ﬁbroblasts in collagen lattices for Figure 1 . Quantitative correla - tion between silicone wrinkling ﬁbroblasts and (cid:1) - SMA expres - sion . ( A ) The percentage of SCFs and LFs producing wrinkles on silicone substrates is compared with the percentage of (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbroblasts grown on plastic culture dishes . Expres - sion of (cid:1) - SMA is further demon - strated by Western blotting , equilibrated for total actin ( lanes correspond to columns above ) . ( B ) The percentage of (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbroblasts was evaluated on silicone in which wrinkles were preserved after ﬁxation . The low percentage of wrinkling SCFs compared with LFs was signiﬁcantly enhanced by TGF (cid:2) 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) . In all cases (cid:1) - SMA expression corre - lated with the wrinkling activ - ity .

Fibroblast Contraction Vol . 12 , September 2001 2733 (cid:1) - SMA and F - actin ( Figure 5 ) . When grown in lattices , SCFs exhibited broader lamellae ( Figure 5A ) compared with LFs , which were more elongated and showed prominent stress ﬁbers ( Figure 5D ) . Exposing SCFs to TGF (cid:2) increased the pro - portion of cells expressing (cid:1) - SMA from 13 (cid:1) 2 % – 69 (cid:1) 4 % and lead to moderate cell elongation . Treatment of LFs with either TGF (cid:2) - sR ( Figure 5E ) or anti - TGF (cid:2) 1 antibody reduced the number of LFs expressing (cid:1) - SMA from 70 (cid:1) 5 % – 12 (cid:1) 2 % but did not alter F - actin organization . Both blocking factors had no signiﬁcant effect on SCF morphology and (cid:1) - SMA expression . Generally , the percentage of (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells in collagen lattices was (cid:2) 1 . 4 - fold lower compared with plastic and silicone substrates , possibly reﬂecting the different substrate compli - ance ( Arora et al . , 1999b ) . ED - A FN Is Essential for (cid:1) - SMA Expression and Contraction of Fibroblast - populated Collagen Lattices We have recently shown that induction of (cid:1) - SMA expres - sion by TGF (cid:2) depends on the presence of ED - A FN in the extracellular matrix ( Serini et al . , 1998 ) . In the attached col - lagen lattice model , the levels of endogenous ED - A FN and (cid:1) - SMA expression at 5 d varied according to the myoﬁbro - blastic differentiation ( Figure 5 ) . Control SCFs ( Figure 5C ) and LFs treated with TGF - sR secreted low amounts of ED - A FN . In contrast , TGF (cid:2) - stimulated SCFs and control LFs ( Fig - ure 5F ) produced high amounts of ED - A FN , organized into extracellular ﬁbrils and aligned with intracellular F - actin bundles as observed by confocal imaging . The importance of ED - A FN in mediating TGF (cid:2) - induced ﬁbroblast contraction was then tested by adding rED - A to the collagen matrix of the lattice contraction assay . To ex - clude effects of plasma factors and plasma FN , all experi - ments were performed with the use of Monomed without medium change during 5 d . Fibroblast - populated collagen lattices in Monomed contracted similarly ( Figure 6A ) com - pared with serum conditions ( Figure 4A ) . rED - A reduced the contraction of LFs to 38 % ( LF control (cid:4) 60 % ) but had no effect on SCF lattice contraction ( 38 % ) .

Hinz et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2734 populated lattices were simultaneously treated with rED - A and TGF (cid:2) , intermediate lattice contraction was obtained : SCF contraction was lower ( 50 % ) when treated additionally with rED - A compared with TGF (cid:2) treatment only ( 59 % ) . Treating LFs simultaneously with TGF (cid:2) and rED - A partially rescued lattice contraction ( 48 % ) compared with rED - A alone ( 38 % ) . Correlation between increased lattice contraction and in - creased (cid:1) - SMA expression was examined by analyzing the amount of (cid:1) - SMA in the lattice cells ( Figure 6B ) . The level of total actin was not changed by the experimental conditions . A correlation factor of r 2 (cid:4) 0 . 88 was obtained when contrac - tion mean values were tested against mean values of (cid:1) - SMA levels ( Figure 6B ) , calculated from Western blot quantitative analysis and normalized to total actin . Immunoﬂuorescence staining of rED - A – containing lattices and subsequent cell counting revealed a decrease in the proportion of (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs ( 13 (cid:1) 2 % ) compared with lattices not containing rED - A ( 70 (cid:1) 4 % ) . LFs exhibited a similar morphology in rED - A lattices as after TGF (cid:2) - blocking experiments ( Figure 5E ) . No changes were noticed regarding the number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive SCFs ( 13 (cid:1) 2 % ) and their morphology after rED - A , similarly to TGF (cid:2) - sR treatment . Transfection with (cid:1) - SMA cDNA Enhances Contraction of 3T3 Fibroblasts To investigate the direct effect of (cid:1) - SMA expression on ﬁ - broblast contraction , we transiently and stably transfected Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts with (cid:1) - SMA cDNA and evaluated their ability to contract stressed collagen lattices . 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were chosen because of their high transfection rate ( 21 % in average ) compared with primary ﬁbroblasts ( 2 – 5 % ; Mounier et al . , 1999 ) and because of their basal low (cid:1) - SMA expression ( Figure 7A , E ) . Wild - type 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , grown in attached collagen lattices or on culture dishes , develop stress ﬁbers in the presence of serum ( Figure 7A ) but only (cid:2) 3 – 5 % of the cells are (cid:1) - SMA positive . Transfected (cid:1) - SMA was predom - inantly incorporated into stress ﬁbers as evaluated by dou - ble - labeling with antibodies against (cid:1) - SMA and against the VSV - G - tag at the actin C terminus ( Figure 7B ) . Stably trans - fected (cid:1) - cardiac ( Figure 7D ) and transiently transfected (cid:2) - cytoplasmic actin were also incorporated into stress ﬁbers , but the latter occasionally accumulated in cytoplasmic ag - gregates if strongly overexpressed , a phenomenon reported previously for transfected primary cells ( von Arx et al . , 1995 ; Mounier et al . , 1997 ) . Transfected (cid:3) - cytoplasmic actin pre - dominantly localized in lamellipodia and membrane rufﬂes ( Figure 7C ) and sporadically appeared in stress ﬁbers of high expressing clones . Increased expression of (cid:1) - SMA after transfection was demonstrated by Western blotting against VSV - G - tag and (cid:1) - SMA ( Figure 7E ) . Transfection with other actin isoforms did not change the level of (cid:1) - SMA expression compared with wild - type ﬁbroblasts . Neither transfected nor wild - type 3T3 ﬁbroblasts expressed SMMHC . Moreover , transfection did not change the level of NMMHC expression Figure 3 . Expression of (cid:1) - SMA increases the force of individual LFs . By increasing the ﬂaming time of the silicone surface , deform - able substrates were produced with increasing stiffness , leading to an increase of the force , which is required to cause substrate wrin - kles . The percentage of (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs producing wrinkles was related to the wrinkling proportion of (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs , as determined by immunostaining . On all substrates (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs exhibited a higher proportion of wrinkling cells compared with (cid:1) - SMA – negative LFs . Figure 4 . TGF (cid:2) affects in parallel collagen lattice contraction and (cid:1) - SMA expression . ( A ) SCFs and LFs were grown in attached col - lagen gels in serum - containing medium and treated with 10 ng / ml TGF (cid:2) 1 or TGF (cid:2) - sR ( 1 . 0 – 100 ng / ml ) for 5 d . Stressed lattices were then released and maximum contraction was recorded after 30 min . TGF (cid:2) 1 enhanced SCF contraction but had no effect on that of LFs . TGF (cid:2) - sR decreased LFs contraction dose - dependently but did not affect that of SCFs .

No changes were observed when blots were evaluated for total actin . Fibroblast Contraction Vol . 12 , September 2001 2735 as tested by immunoﬂuorescence staining and Western blot - ting . With the use of the collagen lattice assay , wild - type 3T3 ﬁbroblasts exhibited 26 % contraction , which was 1 . 6 - fold lower compared with SCFs and 2 . 4 - fold lower compared with LFs contraction . 3T3 ﬁbroblast contraction correlated with transient transfection efﬁciency ( r 2 (cid:4) 0 . 92 ) and was signiﬁcantly higher after transfection with (cid:1) - SMA compared with (cid:2) - cytoplasmic actin ( 132 (cid:1) 4 % ) . To minimize variations between different transfection experiments , we produced 3T3 ﬁbroblast clones stably expressing (cid:1) - SMA at different levels and compared their contractile capacity to clones sta - bly expressing various levels of (cid:3) - cytoplasmic and (cid:1) - cardiac actin ( Figure 8 ) . Lattice contraction showed small linear increase with increasing expression levels of (cid:3) - cytoplasmic actin ( r 2 (cid:4) 0 . 9 ) compared with wild - type ﬁbroblasts ; after transfection with (cid:1) - cardiac actin , linear increasing contrac - tion ( r 2 (cid:4) 0 . 88 ) was slightly but signiﬁcantly more important than after transfection of (cid:3) - cytoplasmic actin . Transfection of (cid:1) - SMA ( r 2 (cid:4) 0 . 79 ) clearly promoted the highest contraction at comparable expression levels ( Figure 8 ) . DISCUSSION In addition to be a well - accepted marker of myoﬁbroblast differentiation , (cid:1) - SMA has been suggested to play a role in the production of contractile force during wound healing and ﬁ - brocontractive diseases ( for review see Serini and Gabbiani , 1999 ) . Several works have investigated this possibility at the cellular level ( Arora and McCulloch , 1994 ; Vaughan et al . , 2000 ) ; however , such function has remained not well estab - lished . Our study , exploring the relationship between the level of (cid:1) - SMA expression in cultured ﬁbroblasts and their efﬁciency to contract deformable silicone substrates and stress - released collagen gels , shows ( 1 ) a signiﬁcantly higher contraction of LFs , expressing high levels of (cid:1) - SMA , compared with SCFs , expressing low levels of (cid:1) - SMA ; ( 2 ) an enhancement of con - tractile activity in SCFs treated by TGF (cid:2) concomitant with an increase of (cid:1) - SMA expression . Inversely , decreasing (cid:1) - SMA expression by blocking the effect of endogenous TGF (cid:2) with speciﬁc antibodies , TGF (cid:2) - sR , or rED - A correlates with a reduc - tion of LFs contractile activity ; ( 3 ) a clear increase of contraction in 3T3 ﬁbroblasts stably and transiently transfected with Figure 5 . TGF (cid:2) increases the number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbroblasts in collagen lattices . Collagen lattices with SCFs ( A – C ) and LFs ( D – F ) were stained after 5 d for (cid:1) - SMA ( red ) , F - actin ( A , B , D , and E , green ) , ED - A FN ( C and F , green ) , and cell nuclei ( blue ) . Colocalization of (cid:1) - SMA with F - actin or ED - A FN , respectively , is indicated by yellow color . Control SCFs populations contained a low number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive cells ( A , C ) compared with SCFs treated for 5 d with 10 ng / ml TGF (cid:2) ( B ) or LFs ( D and F ) . TGF (cid:2) - sR ( 100 ng / ml ) decreased the number of (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs ( E ) . ED - A FN expression by SCFs ( C ) is lower than that of LFs ( F ) . Bar , 50 (cid:4) m . B .

Taken together , these results indicate that (cid:1) - SMA expression is crucial in determining the extent of in vitro ﬁbroblast contractile activity . Figure 6 .

Figure 7 . Stable transfection of 3T3 ﬁbroblasts with different actin isoforms . 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( A ) were sta - bly transfected with VSV - G – tagged (cid:1) - SMA ( B ) , (cid:3) - cy - toplasmic ( C ) and (cid:1) - cardiac actin ( D ) cDNA , respec - tively . Double - immunostaining of wild - type 3T3 ﬁbroblasts demonstrated low expression of (cid:1) - SMA ( A , red ) in F - actin – containing stress ﬁbers ( A , green ) Transfected (cid:1) - SMA and (cid:1) - cardiac actin were pre - dominantly incorporated into stress ﬁbers and (cid:3) - cy - toplasmic actin into membrane rufﬂes and lamelli - podia , as shown by double - immunostaining of ﬁbroblasts for actin isoforms ( B – D , green ) and VSV - G - tag ( B – D , red ) .

Note that enhanced expression of (cid:1) - SMA correlates with enhanced VSV - G - tag expression in (cid:1) - SMA trans - fected clones ( s1 – s3 ) , but not in clones expressing transfected (cid:1) - cardiac ( (cid:1) - Car : c1 , c2 ) and (cid:3) - cytoplas - mic actin ( (cid:3) - Ccyt : y1 , y2 ) . Vimentin was used to demonstrate equal loads of total protein . Fibroblast Contraction Vol . 12 , September 2001 2737 To assess the contractile potential of ﬁbroblast popula - tions we measured the isotonic contraction of attached col - lagen gels . Isometrically stressed lattices are a more appro - priate model of myoﬁbroblast - populated granulation tissue during wound contraction compared with mechanically un - loaded ﬂoating lattices ( Grinnell , 1994 ) . Isometric tension has been shown to be important for the development of myoﬁbroblastic contractile features such as stress ﬁbers ( Burridge , 1981 ; Tomasek et al . , 1992 ; Katoh et al . , 1998 ; Grinnell et al . , 1999a ) and (cid:1) - SMA expression in collagen lattices ( Arora et al . , 1999b ) . To test whether individual (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbroblasts contract more efﬁciently than (cid:1) - SMA – negative cells under identical conditions , we used a modiﬁcation of the wrinkling silicone elastomer assay , orig - inally developed by Harris et al . ( 1980 ) , which is particularly useful in order to visualize overall cell contractile forces . We show here a direct correlation between (cid:1) - SMA expression and the contractile efﬁciency of individual ﬁbroblasts by improving the assay with an immunostaining technique that allows the examination of cytoskeletal features and silicone substrate wrinkles in the same cell . By modulating the cross - linking process of the silicone surface , we have generated a range of elastomers with increasing stiffness and determined the forces required to wrinkle these substrates . Wrinkling forces of the same magnitude have been measured for hu - man dermal ﬁbroblasts , with the use of latex bead displace - ment assays , but were restricted to a silicone ﬁlm with low stiffness in order to provide a full bead position recovery ( Fray et al . , 1998 ) . It is conceivable that wrinkle - producing ﬁbroblasts exert only the minimum force necessary to de - form these weak surfaces ; therefore , the use of elastomers with gradually increasing stiffness is crucial to determine their maximum contractile potential . Highly compliant elas - tomers have been wrinkled by a large proportion of (cid:1) - SMA – negative ﬁbroblasts consistent with the wrinkling capability of numerous cell types ( Lee et al . , 1994 ; Oliver et al . , 1995 ) . With the use of stiffer substrates , we determined a threshold of (cid:2) 4 (cid:4) N that discriminates between these relatively weak traction forces and higher contractile forces ( Roy et al . , 1999 ) ; this threshold is only surpassed by (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁbro - blasts . Consequently , expression of (cid:1) - SMA considerably in - creases contractile activity but is not mandatory for cells to exert forces on a low level . In a further attempt to control the relationship between (cid:1) - SMA expression and ﬁbroblast contractile activity , we modulated the level of (cid:1) - SMA expression in our cell popu - lations . Among cytokines implicated in myoﬁbroblast dif - ferentiation , TGF (cid:2) has been proven to directly induce (cid:1) - SMA expression in vivo and in vitro ( Desmoulie ` re et al . , 1993 ; Rønnov - Jessen and Petersen , 1993 ) . A series of studies with the use of free - ﬂoating collagen gels reported TGF (cid:2) - induced ﬁbroblast contraction , but did not consider the ex - pression of (cid:1) - SMA ( Montesano and Orci , 1988 ; Finesmith et al . , 1990 ; Tingstrom et al . , 1992 ; Pena et al . , 1994 ; Riikonen et al . , 1995 ; Levi - Schaffer et al . , 1999 ) with two exceptions ( Arora and McCulloch , 1994 ; Kurosaka , 1995 ; 2154 ) . How - ever , it was shown recently that the mechanisms of mechan - ically unloaded free - ﬂoating gel reduction considerably dif - fer from stressed gel contraction ( for review see Grinnell , 2000 ) . Other studies reported a relationship between in - creased isometric tension in attached collagen gels and in - creased (cid:1) - SMA expression after treating ﬁbroblasts with TGF (cid:2) , but did not release these gels to test isotonic contrac - tion ( Kurosaka et al . , 1998 ; Arora et al . , 1999b ) . Here we show that increasing isotonic contraction of mechanically loaded collagen lattices by TGF (cid:2) corresponds to an increase of (cid:1) - SMA expression in SCFs . Inversely , blocking the effect of TGF (cid:2) with speciﬁc antibodies , with TGF (cid:2) - sR or with rED - A reduced (cid:1) - SMA expression of LFs and concomitantly lattice contraction . These experiments are compatible with the ex - istence of a TGF (cid:2) autocrine loop , maintaining myoﬁbroblast differentiation and contractile activity ( Shi et al . , 1996 ; Schmid et al . , 1998 ) and are consistent with similar ﬁndings of Vaughan et al . ( 2000 ) . The results of rED - A experiments further suggest a func - tional role of the ED - A FN splice variant in ﬁbroblast con - traction . The expression of ED - A FN in healing wounds ( Ffrench - Constant et al . , 1989 ; Brown et al . , 1993 ) precedes the appearance of (cid:1) - SMA – positive myoﬁbroblasts and is essential to mediate TGF (cid:2) 1 - induced (cid:1) - SMA expression ( Serini et al . , 1998 ) . The mechanism of speciﬁc antibodies and of TGF (cid:2) - sR action on TGF (cid:2) appears obvious ( Komesli et al . , 1998 ) ; however , the mechanism through which rED - A inhib - its TGF (cid:2) - mediated (cid:1) - SMA expression is at present unclear . Because antibodies speciﬁc against ED - A FN exert similar effects , rED - A seems to prevent the interaction between ﬁbroblasts and ED - A FN , a possible outside - in signal for myoﬁbroblast differentiation . In addition to serving as a signal , ED - A FN may play a mechanical role by providing efﬁcient cell - matrix attachment , which is important for trans - mitting intracellular contraction to the matrix ( Racine - Sam - son et al . , 1997 ; Imanaka - Yoshida et al . , 1999 ; Roy et al . , 1999 ) . Figure 8 . Stable transfection of 3T3 ﬁbroblasts with (cid:1) - SMA cDNA enhances collagen gel contraction . 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were stably trans - fected with VSV - G – tagged (cid:1) - SMA , (cid:1) - cardiac , and (cid:3) - cytoplasmic actin cDNA , respectively , cloned for different VSV - G - tag expression levels and grown in attached collagen gels . Contraction of released collagen gels was normalized to wild - type 3T3 ﬁbroblast contrac - tion . With increasing expression levels , (cid:1) - SMA – transfected 3T3 ﬁ - broblast ( Œ , continuous line ) contracted signiﬁcantly more than 3T3 ﬁbroblasts transfected with (cid:1) - cardiac ( (cid:1) , dashed line ) and (cid:3) - cyto - plasmic actin ( F , dotted line ) . Each data point represents mean collagen lattice contraction of one clone , calculated from three in - dependent experiments . R 2 values indicate the correlation between VSV - G - tag expression levels and contraction . B . Hinz et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2738 Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of this ED - A FN activity . Strong evidence of direct correlation between the level of (cid:1) - SMA expression and ﬁbroblast contractility is provided by transfection of (cid:1) - SMA cDNA into 3T3 ﬁbroblasts . Nontrans - fected ﬁbroblasts also contract collagen gels , but exert con - siderably lower forces compared with (cid:1) - SMA – positive ﬁ - broblasts , consistent with the wrinkling capacity of (cid:1) - SMA – negative cells on compliant elastomers . Downregulation of (cid:1) - SMA expression by antisense mRNA has been previously shown to provoke an increase in cell migratory activity , possibly mediated through a decrease in cell - matrix adhe - sion sites ( Rønnov - Jessen and Petersen , 1993 ) . This possibil - ity is in accordance with the observation that signiﬁcantly larger focal contacts are present in (cid:1) - SMA – positive LFs com - pared with SCFs ( Dugina et al . , 1998 ) . Further studies should concentrate on the subcellular mechanisms through which (cid:1) - SMA increases ﬁbroblast contractile activity and in partic - ular investigate whether transfected (cid:1) - SMA increases in - duces the formation of specialized focal contacts , typical for (cid:1) - SMA – positive myoﬁbroblasts ( Dugina et al . , 1998 ; Vaughan et al . , 2000 ) . For this purpose the use of embedded ﬂuorescent beads in elastic polyacrylamide substrates ( Pel - ham and Wang , 1997 ) in conjunction with detailed computer analysis ( Dembo and Wang , 1999 ; Pelham and Wang , 1999 ) will be necessary . This technique can also allow to examine whether (cid:1) - SMA expression mediates more efﬁcient contrac - tion by increasing the absolute contractile force or by opti - mizing the spatial distribution of several subcellular forces . Transfection with (cid:1) - SMA increased ﬁbroblast contractility in the absence of SMMHC expression , in agreement with the recent demonstration of efﬁcient smooth muscle cell contrac - tion in SMMHC knockout mice ( Morano et al . , 2000 ) and notably without increasing NMMHC expression . Further - more , TGF (cid:2) enhances contractile activity of SCFs without changing SMMHC or NMMHC expression . Further studies are needed to determine whether enhanced (cid:1) - SMA expres - sion inﬂuences other structural proteins that are involved in cell contraction in an isoform - speciﬁc manner , such as tro - pomyosin ( Schevzov et al . , 1993 ) , caldesmon ( Bretscher and Lynch , 1985 ) , calponin ( Gimona et al . , 1992 ) , SM22 ( Gimona et al . , 1992 ) , and gelsolin ( Arora et al . , 1999a ) or whether it affects regulatory events , including myosin light - chain phos - phorylation , small GTPase activation , and calcium signaling ( Parizi et al . , 2000 ) . The 3 (cid:6) UTRs of (cid:1) - cardiac and (cid:2) - cytoplas - mic actin have been suggested to facilitate actin isoform sorting in the cytoplasm by localizing to different subcellular compartments ( Kislauskis et al . , 1993 ) and the 3 (cid:6) UTR of (cid:1) - tropomyosin has been shown to exert functional tumor suppressor activity ( Rastinejad et al . , 1993 ) . However , an effect of the 3 (cid:6) UTR of (cid:1) - SMA on ﬁbroblast contraction seems to be unlikely , because this region was excluded from our actin cDNA constructs . In conclusion , we have shown with the use of different approaches that de novo expression of (cid:1) - SMA in cultured ﬁbroblasts enhances their contractile activity . The direct ev - idence obtained from (cid:1) - SMA cDNA transfection experi - ments is corroborated by the results showing a correlation between levels of (cid:1) - SMA expression and cell contractility in several other experimental situations . Apparently the (cid:1) - SMA activity is exerted without any change in myosin HC expression ; probably (cid:1) - SMA provides more competent in - teraction with NMM either directly or indirectly by gener - ating an actin organization specialized for contraction . Fur - ther studies along these lines may provide important information on the cellular mechanisms regulating the con - traction of a healing wound and of ﬁbrotic tissues .
