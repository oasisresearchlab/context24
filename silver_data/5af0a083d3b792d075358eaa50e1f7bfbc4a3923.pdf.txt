Miller III Department of Physics & Astronomy , Johns Hopkins University Eukaryotic cells can polarize and migrate in response to electric ﬁelds via “galvanotaxis , ” which aids wound healing . Experimental evidence suggests cells sense electric ﬁelds via molecules on the cell’s surface redistributing via electrophoresis and electroosmosis , though the sensing species has not yet been conclusively identiﬁed . We develop a model that links sensor redistribution and galvan - otaxis using maximum likelihood estimation . Our model predicts a single universal curve for how galvanotactic directionality depends on ﬁeld strength . We can collapse measurements of galvano - taxis in keratocytes , neural crest cells , and granulocytes to this curve , suggesting that stochasticity due to the ﬁnite number of sensors may limit galvanotactic accuracy . We ﬁnd cells can achieve experimentally observed directionalities with either a few ( ∼ 100 ) highly - polarized sensors , or many ( ∼ 10 4 ) sensors with a ∼ 6 − 10 % change in concentration across the cell . We also identify ad - ditional signatures of galvanotaxis via sensor redistribution , including the presence of a tradeoﬀ between accuracy and variance in cells being controlled by rapidly switching ﬁelds . Our approach shows how the physics of noise at the molecular scale can limit cell - scale galvanotaxis , providing important constraints on sensor properties , and allowing for new tests to determine the speciﬁc molecules underlying galvanotaxis . Eukaryotic cells will migrate singly or in groups in re - sponse to an applied electrical ﬁeld – a process called “galvanotaxis” or “electrotaxis” [ 1 – 9 ] . Response to elec - tric ﬁelds helps give directionality to wound healing [ 10 ] and immune response [ 11 ] , overriding other guidance cues [ 12 ] . While galvanotactic responses have been measured for decades , understanding of the mechanisms of gal - vanotaxis pale in comparison to chemotaxis , where cells respond to chemical gradients [ 1 ] . The current best - supported theory is that galvanotaxis arises because of migration of a sensor species on the surface of the cell in response to the electric ﬁeld [ 13 – 15 ] ( ciliated cells may have an alternate behavior [ 16 ] ) . Single - cell galvanotaxis has been modeled phenomenologically [ 17 – 21 ] but these models do not connect galvanotaxis to sensor rearrange - ments . There is strong evidence that both eukaryotic cells and bacteria can sense chemicals at nearly the limits imposed on them by basic physical and statistical principles [ 22 – 28 ] , and broader interest in ﬁnding fundamental physical bounds for accuracy [ 29 – 35 ] . Here , we ask : how precisely can a cell sense the direction of an applied electrical ﬁeld ? Our strategy will be to write a model for the probabil - ity of observing a sensor conﬁguration in the ﬁeld , and then determine how the cell can estimate the ﬁeld angle by choosing an estimated direction ˆ ψ that maximizes the likelihood of observing this conﬁguration . This approach builds oﬀ past maximum - likelihood estimation ( MLE ) re - sults that established optimal ways to sense chemical con - centrations and gradients [ 34 , 36 – 40 ] . We derive results bounding the best possible estimation cells can make of the ﬁeld orientation given the unavoidable randomness in sensor positions . ∗ These two authors contributed equally SENSOR MIGRATION MODEL We apply a simple model , assuming that a receptor – or other charged molecule – migrates on the surface of the cell in response to an electric ﬁeld . We call this molecule a sensor . The prevailing consensus is that sen - sor redistribution via electrophoresis and electroosmosis is necessary for a galvanotactic response [ 13 – 15 , 41 , 42 ] . Other proposed mechanisms such as asymmetric open - ing of voltage gated ion channels are not supported by evidence on , e . g . changing the viscosity of the medium surrounding the cells [ 13 , 14 ] . We assume the sensor species travels along the cell membrane with a velocity v that is proportional to the component of electric ﬁeld in the membrane’s tangent plane [ 41 ] . For many diﬀerent assumptions about the cell and membrane properties , this leads to an “eﬀective mobility” µ where the sensor velocity is v (cid:107) = µE (cid:107) , i . e . v = µ [ E − ( E · ˆ n ) ˆ n ] where ˆ n is a local normal to the surface of the cell and E is the applied electric ﬁeld . The parameter µ , which can be positive or negative , includes the eﬀect of electrophoresis and electroosmotic ﬂow and the eﬀect of the cell on the electric ﬁeld ( see Appendix A ) and can be estimated from microscopic properties of the sensor and environment [ 14 , 15 , 41 ] ; we will interpret µ as purely a phenomenological value . The steady - state probability distribution of sensor lo - cations arises from competition between sensor advec - tion due to the ﬁeld and diﬀusion tending to spread the sensors out . The probability ﬂux from sensor migration and diﬀusion on the cell surface is J = v p − D ∇ S p where p is the probability density on the surface , D is the sensor diﬀusion coeﬃcient , and ∇ S the surface gra - dient . The continuity equation is then ∂p∂t = −∇ S · J . We initially consider a two - dimensional model of a cell as a circle . Positions on the cell surface are parame - terized by an angle θ , and ∇ S → 1 R ∂ θ . For our circle , a r X i v : 2 2 09 . 04742v2 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 2 1 J u l 2023 2 a b FIG . 1 . Illustration of sensors on surface of cell and schematic of sensor distributions . a : The cell uses the stochastic locations of sensors ( θ 1 , θ 2 , · · · , θ N ) to make a noisy estimate ˆ ψ of the ﬁeld’s true direction ψ . Sensors travel with velocity v proportional to the component of the electric ﬁeld tangential to the membrane . b : Stochastic simulation of N = 30 sensor positions for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths , generated by drawing sensor positions independently from the distribution p ( θ ) ∼ exp ( κ cos ( θ − ψ ) ) . the velocity is v = µ [ E − ( E · ˆ n ) ˆ n ] = µ ( E · ˆ θ ) ˆ θ , where ˆ θ = ( − sin θ , cos θ ) is the local tangent . Our continuity equation becomes , if the electrical ﬁeld is in the ψ direc - tion , ∂ ∂tp ( θ , t ) = − 1 R ∂ ∂θ [ − µE sin ( θ − ψ ) p ( θ , t ) ] + D R 2 ∂ 2 ∂θ 2 p ( θ , t ) . ( 1 ) The steady - state solution of this equation is p ( θ ) = Z − 1 e κ cos ( θ − ψ ) , ( 2 ) where ψ is the ﬁeld’s orientation relative to the x axis and κ = µER / D , given the ﬁeld strength E , cell radius R , and diﬀusion constant D . Z is a normalizing fac - tor . p ( θ ) is a von Mises distribution – a generalization of a Gaussian distribution to a periodic domain [ 43 ] . κ can be interpreted as a P´eclet number [ 44 ] , the ratio be - tween the timescales of diﬀusive spreading versus advec - tive transport via the electric ﬁeld . Increasing κ , e . g . by making the ﬁeld larger , or the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the sensor smaller , means sensors are more localized ( more front / back polarization ) . In the limit of κ (cid:29) 1 , Eq . 2 be - comes a Gaussian with variance 1 / κ . We will often think about how cell responses depend on electric ﬁeld , so we also deﬁne β = µR / D so κ = βE . 1 / β is the electric ﬁeld at which the cathode - anode ratio p ( ψ ) / p ( ψ + π ) reaches e 2 ≈ 7 . 4 . Sensor positions arising from this p ( θ ) as βE is increased are plotted in Fig . 1b . We also solve for p in a spherical geometry ( Appendix B ) . ESTIMATING FIELD DIRECTIONS USING MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD We assume the cell chooses an orientation ψ that max - imizes the likelihood L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = p ( θ | ψ , E ) given the N observed sensor locations θ = ( θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 , · · · , θ N ) . If the sensor positions are independent , then L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = (cid:81) N i = 1 p ( θ i | ψ , E ) , or ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = − N ln Z + κ N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( θ i − ψ ) ( 3 ) = − N ln Z + β E · ρ , ( 4 ) where ρ = (cid:80) i ( cos θ i , sin θ i ) is the sum of sensor positions and the ﬁeld E = E ( cos ψ , sin ψ ) . Given θ , the direction ψ that maximizes ln L is the maximum likelihood esti - mator of the ﬁeld direction ψ ; we call this estimator ˆ ψ . We can see directly from Eq . ( 4 ) that log - likelihood is maximized if E is in the direction of the sum of sensor locations ρ , i . e . tan ˆ ψ = (cid:80) i sin θ i (cid:80) i cos θ i , ( 5 ) if β > 0 ( Appendix C ) . An analogous result can be de - rived for a sphere ( Appendix B ) . The precision with which a cell can sense the direction ψ is limited by the Fisher information I ( ψ ) = − (cid:68) ∂ 2 ln L ∂ψ 2 (cid:69) [ 45 ] , which can be computed as I ( ψ ) = κ (cid:80) Ni = 1 (cid:104) cos ( θ i − ψ ) (cid:105) . We ﬁnd I ( ψ ) = NκI 1 ( κ ) I 0 ( κ ) ( circle ) , ( 6 ) where I ν ( x ) is a modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind . This is also a known result for independent von Mises measurements [ 43 ] . We can also compute the Fisher in - formation and maximum likelihood estimators for sen - sors on a sphere , assuming the cell only estimates the azimuthal ﬁeld angle , using its substrate to constrain the ﬁeld’s plane ( Appendix B ) . I ( ψ ) = N ( κ coth κ − 1 ) ( sphere ) . ( 7 ) The accuracy of unbiased estimators ˆ ψ of a parameter ψ are limited by the Cramer - Rao bound [ 45 ] , (cid:104) ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) 2 (cid:105) ≥ I ( ψ ) − 1 ( Cramer - Rao ) . ( 8 ) 3 FIG . 2 . Accuracy of galvanotaxis plotted as circular vari - ance V = 2 ( 1 − (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ) . Accuracy can be increased by increasing the number of sensors N or making the sensors more polarized across the cell ( increasing βE ) . Solid lines are the periodic bound ( Eq . ( 9 ) ) , dashed lines are the normal Cramer - Rao bound ( Eq . ( 8 ) ) , symbols are stochastic simu - lation . d = 2 shown here ; see Appendix B for sphere . Inset shows zoomed in region in linear scale : MLE variance sys - tematically exceeds Eq . ( 9 ) . However , this bound can be incorrect when estimating a direction like ψ when I ( ψ ) is small . The Cramer - Rao def - inition of an unbiased estimator is that (cid:104) ˆ ψ (cid:105) = ψ . Angles , though , may vary by factors of 2 π – e . g . an estimator with (cid:104) ˆ ψ (cid:105) = ψ + 2 π would be biased in the usual deﬁ - nition , but unbiased in a circular sense , requiring gen - eralizations of Cramer - Rao [ 43 ] . We ﬁnd a bound for circularly - deﬁned variables ( Appendix D ) : (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ≤ (cid:115) I ( ψ ) 1 + I ( ψ ) ( periodic Cramer - Rao ) . ( 9 ) Galvanotaxing cells are more accurate in their ﬁeld sensing when the ﬁeld strength E is increased , or if there are more sensors ( larger N ) , or if the sensors are more susceptible to the ﬁeld ( larger β ) ( Fig . 2 ) . We plot the circular equivalent of the variance V ≡ 2 ( 1 − (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ) ; when | ˆ ψ − ψ | (cid:28) 2 π , V reduces to the ordinary vari - ance , as can be seen via Taylor expansion . We show the periodic Cramer - Rao bound , Eq . ( 9 ) ( solid lines ) , and V computed by stochastic simulation ( symbols ) . To verify our results on the the variance of the maximum - likelihood estimator shown in Fig . 2 , we use stochastic simulation . To do this , we draw each sen - sor position independently from the distribution p ( θ ) ∼ e κ cos ( θ − ψ ) . Then , for each sensor conﬁguration of N sen - sors , we determine the maximum - likelihood direction ˆ ψ by computing the sum of sensor positions ρ . We then compute the average V = 2 ( 1 − (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ) over 5000 generated sensor conﬁgurations . The simulated circular variance V agrees well with the ordinary Cramer - Rao bound at asymptotically large ﬁelds ( dashed line , Eq . ( 8 ) ) , with V ≈ 1 / I ( ψ ) . Given less information about ﬁeld direction , 1 / I ( ψ ) exceeds the maximum possible V = 2 , and the periodic Cramer - Rao bound is a better measure of the simulated variance . The bound in Eq . ( 9 ) is not “tight” – the maximum likeli - hood estimator does not achieve the bound at βE (cid:28) 1 ( Fig . 2 inset ) , though it is eﬃcient at large E . This may occur because the bound in Eq . ( 9 ) could be improved , or MLE is not eﬃcient for this problem [ 45 ] . UNIVERSAL CURVE DESCRIBES SENSING ACROSS CELL TYPES In the limit of weakly polarized cells ( κ (cid:46) 1 ) , which we think is likely experimentally relevant ( see next section ) , we can make a particularly simple prediction . In this limit , I ( ψ ) ≈ Nκ 2 / d , with d = 2 , 3 for circle and sphere , respectively . If cells perform near their ideal abilities ( Eq . ( 9 ) ) , the dependence of directionality on electric ﬁeld will then be (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) = (cid:115) Nκ 2 d − 1 1 + Nκ 2 d − 1 ( 10 ) ≡ (cid:115) γ 2 E 2 1 + γ 2 E 2 , ( 11 ) where we have collected all the unknowns into γ 2 ≡ Nβ 2 / d , a single remaining ﬁt parameter . 1 / γ is the ﬁeld at which the best possible directionality is 1 / √ 2 ≈ 0 . 7 . Eq . ( 11 ) is also appropriate if there are multiple sensor types , though with a generalized γ ( Appendix E ) . We test this prediction in Fig . 3 , which shows three experimental measurements of galvanotaxis in diﬀerent cell types : keratocytes [ 2 ] , neural crest [ 19 ] , and gran - ulocytes [ 20 ] . These experiments observe the cosine of the angle of cell velocity relative to the electric ﬁeld – we write this “directionality” as (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) , which assumes that the cell’s velocity is its best estimate of the ﬁeld di - rection . ( We address generalizations of this assumption in Appendix F . ) The experimental measurements can be reasonably collapsed onto our prediction of Eq . ( 11 ) , ﬁt - ting γ for each cell type . We see some deviations from the model at large electric ﬁelds ( neural crest , granulo - cytes ) and small electric ﬁelds ( neural crest ) . Large - ﬁeld deviations may arise from heating and membrane dam - age [ 13 , 46 ] . Alternate ﬁts including additional sources of error like downstream noise in cell motility [ 22 ] are dis - cussed in Appendix F , along with potential reasons for the neural crest deviation . A similar collapse of neural crest and granulocyte data was discovered by [ 19 ] , though without identifying Eq . ( 11 ) . The data in Fig . 3 provides a tantalizing suggestion that ﬂuctuations in sensor positions may limit galvan - otactic accuracy at low ﬁeld strengths , akin to earlier results on information limitation in chemotaxis [ 22 , 25 ] . However , a full test of this idea would require a more con - ﬁdent identiﬁcation of a putative sensor – ﬁxing β and N – or more precise measurements to test the shape of the curve in Fig . 3 . Currently , it is impossible to rule out a model in which cells can sense the electric ﬁeld near - 4 FIG . 3 . Electric ﬁeld dependence of experiments roughly collapse to predicted curve with one ﬁt parameter γ . γ − values are 2 × 10 − 3 mm / mV , 2 . 8 × 10 − 3 mm / mV , and 1 . 7 × 10 − 3 mm / mV for keratocytes [ 2 ] , neural crest ( Fig . 1 of [ 19 ] ) , and granulocytes [ 20 ] , respectively . Granulocyte error bars are unknown . perfectly – but choose to respond to it in a noisy way ( Appendix F ) . MODEL CONSTRAINS SENSOR PROPERTIES What does the ﬁt values of γ = (cid:112) Nβ 2 / d from Fig . 3 tell us about the sensor ? Are these parameters plau - sible ? The key unknowns are β and the number of sen - sors N . Without an established identity of the sensor , estimating N is diﬃcult . Receptors like EGFR which may play a role in galvanotaxis [ 47 ] can have expres - sion levels of ∼ 5 × 10 4 receptors / cell [ 48 ] , but other ( larger ) putative sensors [ 49 ] might be fewer in num - ber . We can ﬁnd β for a molecule given its distribu - tion in an electric ﬁeld p ( θ ) . Recent work measured redistribution of ﬂuorescent tdTomato - GPI in an elec - tric ﬁeld , ﬁnding a cathode / anode ﬂuorescence ratio of roughly 2 . 0 at E = 1000 mV / mm [ 15 ] . This ratio’s de - pendence on ﬁeld strength was consistent with electro - migration [ 14 , 15 , 41 ] . In our electromigration model the ratio between cathodal - side and anodal - side proba - bility density is e 2 κ . The data on tdTomato - GPI then shows e 2 κ = 2 , or κ ≈ 0 . 35 at E = 1000 mV / mm , or β ≈ ( 0 . 35 ) / ( 1000 mV / mm ) ≈ 3 . 5 × 10 − 4 mm / mV . This supports our assumption that κ (cid:46) 1 in the previous sec - tion : 1000 mV / mm is a strong ﬁeld , as some cells migrate directionally in ﬁelds of ∼ 10 mV / mm [ 19 ] . Fields in vivo have been measured at 40 − 200 mV / mm ( mammalian wounds [ 50 ] ) and 27 − 40 mV / mm ( Xenopus embryonic development [ 51 ] ) . Because the only relevant ﬁtting parameter is γ 2 ≡ Nβ 2 / d , we cannot separately determine N and β – i . e . we cannot tell how much of the cell’s accuracy is driven by having a large number of sensors vs sensors that are highly polarized . If we use β ≈ 3 . 5 × 10 − 4 mm / mV appropriate to tdTomato - GPI experiments on CHO cells and d = 3 , all three cell types must have roughly 70 − 200 sensors . By contrast , if we assume that the ﬁeld sensor is expressed at a level similar to typical chemoattractant receptors , guessing N ≈ 10 4 , then we ﬁnd β ≈ ( 3 − 5 ) × 10 − 5 mm / mV for the cell types studied here . This would correspond to a cathode / anode ﬂuorescence ratio of e 2 βE ≈ 1 . 06 − 1 . 10 at E = 1000 mV / mm . This implies that the sensor need not be strongly polarized , even at large ﬁelds – similar to the observation that as few as a hundred bound receptors’ diﬀerence between front and back may lead to chemotactic migration [ 27 ] . FIG . 4 . Directionality varies with cell radius in the model ; experimental data are not as clear . Lines are the bound ( Eq . ( 9 ) with Eq . ( 6 ) ) , symbols are experimental data on kera - tocytes from [ 2 ] . Error bars are standard error . γ = 0 . 002 mm / mV is the value ﬁt in from Fig . 3 for keratocytes ( no additional ﬁt is done in this ﬁgure ) , and E = 600 mV / mm . d = 2 . The broad distribution of directionalities seen in ex - periment , including points near − 1 , is expected , and also seen in our simulations ( Appendix I ) . MODEL SUGGESTS ACCURACY MODERATELY DEPENDS ON CELL SIZE In the experimentally - relevant range of ﬁelds , I ( ψ ) ∼ κ 2 ∼ R 2 depends on radius . Is this size - dependence de - tectable ? The best - available data on accuracy as a func - tion of cell size is [ 2 ] on keratocytes . However , in these experiments , cell areas vary only ∼ twofold . In Fig . 4 we compare our bound ( Eq . ( 9 ) ) with data from [ 2 ] . We start with γ ﬁt for keratocytes from Fig . 3 . Since we cannot separate β and N in our ﬁt , we pick N = 10 4 , and set β 0 = γ (cid:112) d / N = µR 0 / D , where R 0 is an aver - age keratocyte radius for the experiments in Fig . 4 . We plot directionality (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) as a function of increasing radius R relative to R 0 . This result is insensitive to N ( Appendix G ) . We also plot experimental measurements [ 2 ] , computing eﬀective radius as R = (cid:112) A / π and deﬁn - ing R 0 as the average keratocyte radius . The experimen - tal data is scattered , and does not show a clear increase with radius , even when averaged into two groups ( above - and below - average size cells ) . However , the experimental results are also too noisy to rule out our predicted size - dependence . We have held N constant while varying R 5 in Fig . 4 ; we see a slightly stronger dependence on R if sensor density N / ( 4 πR 2 ) is held constant ( Appendix H ) . κ (cid:28) 1 in Fig . 4 , and so as in Fig . 2 , (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) for the maximum likelihood estimator is smaller than Eq . ( 9 ) , but has a similar dependence on R ( Appendix G ) . Additional measurements of directionality as a func - tion of cell size would provide a rigorous check on our pre - dictions . However , because of the relatively small range of sizes seen in the keratocyte experiments , the diﬀer - ence between directionality of small and large cells will be small . For the parameters in Fig . 4 , the predicted diﬀerence between the directionality of a cell with radius 14 microns ( the larger group average ) and a directional - ity of a cell with radius 10 . 5 microns ( the smaller group average ) is at most 0 . 11 across the reasonable range of electric ﬁelds . Since measurements of keratocyte direc - tionality typically have error bars of ∼ ± 0 . 1 for ∼ 50 cells , we’d expect to need > 100 cells per group to show that large cells are more directed than small cells . Dis - tinguishing diﬀerent scaling laws ( e . g . in Appendix H ) would require even more data . Cell - size - dependence of responses has also been ob - served in a diﬀerent context – the time taken to respond to a changed signal [ 13 ] . BROWNIAN DYNAMICS SIMULATION OF SENSOR DIFFUSION AND ELECTROPHORESIS To understand how the cell will respond to dynamic signals , or to understand how the cell’s directionality is correlated over time , we will need to simulate how the sensor conﬁguration evolves over time – to generate stochastic trajectories of sensors on the surface of the cell . To do this , we will use the stochastic diﬀerential equation corresponding to Eq . ( 1 ) . First , we rescale our units of time to ˜ t = t / τ forget , where τ forget ≡ R 2 / D is the time for proteins to spread over the cell by diﬀusion in the absence of a ﬁeld , ﬁnding ∂ ∂ ˜ tp ( θ , ˜ t ) = − ∂ ∂θ (cid:2) − κ sin ( θ − ψ ) p ( θ , ˜ t ) (cid:3) + ∂ 2 ∂θ 2 p ( θ , ˜ t ) , ( 12 ) where κ = µER / D . We will work in these rescaled units , always considering averaging times or exposure times relative to the forgetting time τ forget , which is the relevant timescale in the problem . The stochastic diﬀer - ential equation ( “Langevin equation” ) corresponding to Eq . ( 12 ) is d d˜ tθ i ( ˜ t ) = − κ sin [ θ i ( ˜ t ) − ψ ( ˜ t ) ] + ξ ( ˜ t ) , ( 13 ) where ξ ( ˜ t ) is a Gaussian Langevin noise with (cid:104) ξ ( ˜ t ) ξ ( ˜ t (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = 2 δ ( ˜ t − ˜ t (cid:48) ) and the ﬁeld direction ψ ( ˜ t ) can change with time . The sensor positions will , once simulated for a long enough time in a constant ﬁeld , have a steady - state prob - ability distribution p ( θ ) given by Eq . ( 2 ) . We then sim - ulate N independent sensors diﬀusing in the presence of a b FIG . 5 . To reduce error , cells must average over times long compared with τ forget . a : Circular variance V T as a function of κ = βE for several averaging times T . b : V T rescaled by its snapshot value V T = 0 behaves as ∼ τ forget / T at large T . Lines are an average of 10 simulations of length 1000 τ forget , with ∆ t = 0 . 01 τ forget . We can capture most time - averaging eﬀects by a scaling form V T V T = 0 = (cid:16) 1 + T 2 τ forget (cid:17) − 1 , which we chose to match the expected asymptotic forms . Here V T = 0 is the circular variance with no time averaging . This collapse fails at small κ because V T reaches its maximum value of 2 . Simulation length was set to ( 0 . 1 T / τ forget ) × 1000 τ forget for T / τ forget > 10 , capping at 5000 τ forget . the electric ﬁeld by integrating Eq . ( 13 ) with the Euler - Maruyama method . Unless stated elsewhere , we use time step ∆˜ t = 0 . 001 . CELLS BENEFIT FROM TIME - AVERAGING OVER TIMES T > R 2 / D Cells or groups of cells sensing chemical concentrations or gradients may improve accuracy by integrating mul - tiple measurements of the signal over a time T [ 23 , 37 – 40 , 52 , 53 ] , reducing variance by N meas ∼ T / τ corr , where τ corr is the measurement correlation time . The relevant correlation time for galvanotaxis is τ forget ≡ R 2 / D . To test the eﬀect of integrating multiple measurements in galvanotaxis , we use Brownian dynamics simulations us - ing Eq . ( 13 ) . We then compute the time - averaged direc - tion of the estimator of the ﬁeld as ρ T ≡ 1 T (cid:82) t + T t dt (cid:48) ρ ( t (cid:48) ) , where ρ ( t ) = (cid:80) i ( cos θ i ( t ) , sin θ i ( t ) ) is the sum of sen - sor positions . From the estimator of the ﬁeld direction ρ T ( t ) , we compute the circular variance V T of the di - rections of the time - averaged estimator . Averaging does decrease error over a broad range of βE ( Fig . 5a ) , though for βE (cid:46) 0 . 05 this may be masked , since even with averaging , V T is near its maximum of 2 . As ex - pected , for T (cid:28) τ forget , the circular variance V T lim - its back to the case of zero averaging time ( Fig . 5b ) . For T (cid:29) τ forget , V T ∼ τ forget / T , as we would expect if V T ≈ V T = 0 / N meas with the number of independent mea - surements N meas ∼ T / τ forget . In strong contrast to chemotaxis and concentration sensing , it may be diﬃcult for galvanotaxing cells to gain 6 accuracy by time - averaging over T (cid:38) τ forget . Kerato - cytes have τ forget ∼ 15 min [ 13 ] , making time - averaging unlikely as keratocytes respond to ﬁeld changes within a few minutes [ 13 ] . By comparison , estimates of averaging time for Dictyostelium chemotaxis range from 2 − 20 s [ 22 , 26 , 28 ] . However , in vivo , ﬁbroblasts can take hours to respond to electric ﬁelds from wounds [ 54 ] , making large T plausible , while smaller - radius cell types have shorter τ forget = R 2 / D . The utility of time - averaging is context - and cell - type - dependent . Our results show that the constraints on useful time averaging are quali - tatively diﬀerent for galvanotaxing cells than for chemo - taxing cells . SWITCHING FIELDS PRESENT TRADEOFF BETWEEN ACCURACY AND VARIANCE So far , we have studied cells in constant electric ﬁelds , but controlling precisely where a cell goes may require more complex , changing ﬁelds . We are motivated in par - ticular by the work of Zajdel et al . , who developed an experimental setup for galvanotaxis with two pairs of electrodes , allowing for application of electric ﬁelds in two perpendicular directions [ 3 ] . By rapidly switching the electric ﬁeld between the + x and + y direction every 10 seconds , Zajdel et al . found that cells could be guided along the 45 - degree diagonal [ 3 ] . How does the large time for sensors to diﬀuse across the cell τ forget inﬂuence re - sponses to rapidly - switched ﬁelds ? Using our Brownian dynamics simulations , we switch ﬁeld direction ψ ( t ) over two orthogonal directions , ± π / 4 , varying the “exposure time” ET over which the ﬁeld is constant ( Fig . 6a ) . For ET (cid:28) τ forget , sensors cannot rearrange on the cell sur - face as quickly as the ﬁeld switches , leading the cell to compromise between the two directions ψ = ± π / 4 , and travel in the average ﬁeld direction ψ = 0 – precisely as found in experiments controlling groups of keratinocytes ( see Fig . 4d of [ 3 ] ) . We measure how precisely the cell is following the cur - rent ﬁeld E ( t ) by the instantaneous directionality , the co - sine of the angle between the cell’s direction and the cur - rent ﬁeld ( Fig . 6b ) . For rapid switching ( ET (cid:28) τ forget ) the cell has low accuracy to the instantaneous ﬁeld di - rection – but also relatively low variability , i . e . the cell is going consistently in one direction , but not the instan - taneous ﬁeld direction ψ ( t ) ( Fig . 6b ) . However , at inter - mediate ET ∼ τ forget , larger oscillations in directionality (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ( t ) ) (cid:105) appear as the sensors have time to repo - larize in response to the changed ﬁeld ( Fig . 6b ) . In the regime ET (cid:46) τ forget , there is a clear tradeoﬀ in control : increasing ET increases both directionality and variabil - ity in directionality ( Fig . 6c ) . This means that , though – on average – the cell is more likely to be going in the desired direction ψ ( t ) , the large variation means that it is also more likely to in a diﬀerent direction altogether . This is not a global tradeoﬀ , though . For ET (cid:29) τ forget , variability of directionality decreases ( Fig . 6c ) . In this case , the distribution of cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ( t ) ) is heavily skewed ( Appendix J ) . We also ﬁnd similar results , though with larger ﬂuctuations , when we switch ﬁelds between 0 and π ( Appendix J ) . The tradeoﬀ between average directionality and vari - ability of directionality ( Fig . 6c ) and the appearance of large oscillations in the directionality ( Fig . 6b ) , are new predictions that arise as a signature of the long time for sensors to redistribute across the membrane in the elec - tric ﬁeld . GALVANOTAXIS AND CHEMOTAXIS MAY SHARE SIMILAR SENSING STRATEGY Our results show that circular or spherical cells can measure the direction of an electrical ﬁeld by summing the vectors pointing to their electromobile sensors ρ . This direction can be found by the cell by local pro - trusions in the normal direction ; see Appendix K . This method of choosing a direction is exactly analogous to the estimator for chemotaxis of circular cells in [ 37 , 38 ] , where cells move toward the vector sum of bound sen - sors . This is unexpected , given essential diﬀerences be - tween chemotactic and galvanotactic models : galvano - tactic sensors reorganize and chemotactic ones do not , while galvanotactic sensors do not bind external ligand . Highly accurate processing of galvanotactic information and chemotactic information could then be performed by signaling networks shared between galvanotactic and chemotactic responses . Supporting this idea , chemotac - tic and galvanotactic response in Dictyostelium share common core elements , including TORC2 and PI3K [ 55 ] . FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL TESTS A key implication of our modeling is that observed gal - vanotactic accuracies are physically plausible either with relatively few sensors ( ∼ 100 ) as responsive as tdTomato - GPI , or with a larger number of sensors whose redistribu - tion need not be obvious even in strong ( 1000 mV / mm ) electric ﬁelds . Our work provides a natural quantitative route to test a putative sensor by modifying its abun - dance ( via knockdown or overexpression ) or polarization ( via changes in extracellular viscosity or pH [ 14 , 15 ] , or molecular charge ) , and then measure the cell’s direction - ality as a function of ﬁeld . Our work provides a quan - titative prediction for how cell directionality depends on sensor abundance and polarization . We can also predict directionality as a function of cell size ( Fig . 4 ) and di - rectionality as a function of exposure time in a switching ﬁeld ( Fig . 6 ) for any cell type once γ is ﬁt from the universal directionality - ﬁeld strength curve ( Fig . 3 ) . 7 0 . 01 f 0 . 1 f 1 f 10 f b a c FIG . 6 .

Averages are over 1000 cells , N = 1000 sensors , and κ = 0 . 358 . An equilibration time of 4 τ forget in a constant ﬁeld ( ψ = 0 ) was simulated prior to collecting data . SENSOR INTERACTIONS AND CELL SHAPE CAVEATS We have neglected sensor - sensor interactions by as - suming that sensor positions are independent from one another . We believe sensor - sensor interactions are likely to be relevant only at very large ﬁelds E and very large N . If sensors were uniformly spread over the spherical cap within π / 4 of the ﬁeld ( this is more concentrated than κ = 1 , corresponding to electric ﬁelds much larger than experimentally reasonable ) , sensor density would be N / A with A = 2 πR 2 ( 1 − cos ( π / 4 ) ) ≈ 1 . 8 R 2 the area of the cap . With N = 10 4 sensors and R = 5 µ m , typi - cal distance between sensors is (cid:112) A / N ≈ 70 nm , beyond typical screening lengths . Hydrodynamic interactions in a membrane may be long - range [ 56 – 58 ] , experimentally measured at micron scale [ 59 ] . Including hydrodynamic interactions would not alter the steady - state p ( θ ) , but would lead to correlated sensor diﬀusion , changing the time required for a sensor conﬁguration to decorrelate , likely only altering the time scale τ forget . Changing cell shape would also aﬀect our results , es - pecially since the electromigration velocity depends on how the local ﬁeld is oriented with respect to the mem - brane surface . This will allow elongated cells to have diﬀerent sensitivities to ﬁelds parallel and perpendicular to them , as in chemotaxis [ 38 ] . Initial calculations with an elliptical geometry , which will be published in a sep - arate manuscript , show that an ellipse with semi - minor and semi - major axes R 1 and R 2 with an aspect ratio between 2 and 3 will have a Fisher information within 16 – 24 % of a circular cell with radius ( R 1 + R 2 ) / 2 . Using the full formula for an elliptical cell would not change the curve in Fig . 3 , but would change the ﬁtted β val - ues by 8 – 11 % . We thus expect our approach to be quite acceptable even for fairly elongated cells . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Wei Wang , Amit R . Singh , and Wouter - Jan Rappel for useful feedback and discussions .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : “PHYSICAL LIMITS ON GALVANOTAXIS” Appendix A : Details of electric ﬁeld assumptions In the main text , we have written our assumption that the velocity of the sensor is v = µ [ E − ( E · ˆ n ) ˆ n ] , ( A1 ) where E is the externally - applied ﬁeld – i . e . the ﬁeld far away from the cell – and n the normal to the cell surface . Essentially , this says that the motion of the sensor is only in the tangential plane of the membrane ( we subtract oﬀ the normal component ) – which will be true as long as the membrane is not deforming . µ is an eﬀective mobility akin to that derived by [ 41 ] . This parameter µ could depend on the zeta potential of the surface and the extracellular piece of the sensor , the viscosity of the ﬂuid near the membrane and the membrane viscosity as well as the sensor geometry . The assumptions of [ 41 ] incorporate both electrophoresis and electroosmotic ﬂow . However , our focus is 8 FIG . S1 . Field lines and vector ﬁelds for electric ﬁeld around the boundary of the cell if we assume ∂V / ∂r = 0 at the membrane , as in [ 41 ] , though this assumption is not necessary ( see text ) . not on the details of these speciﬁc assumptions – we view µ as a phenomenological parameter , essentially describing the linear response to an electric ﬁeld , which we set from experiment . However , we do want to mention one issue : why have we written this in terms of the applied electric ﬁeld E ? The electric ﬁeld near the cell is not the same as the applied electric ﬁeld E ( Fig . S1 ) , but the tangential component of the ﬁeld at the surface of the cell is proportional to the tangential component of the external ﬁeld . For a simple example , let’s think about modeling a circular cell in an applied electric ﬁeld E 0 ˆx . The potential V ( r , θ ) will obey Laplace’s equation ∇ 2 V = 0 external to the cell , and will have the potential far from the cell go to V → − E 0 x = − E 0 r cos θ . For simplicity , we start with a boundary condition ∂V / ∂r | r = R = 0 ( this is used by [ 41 ] , and corresponds to an assumption that the cell membrane has negligible conductivity in comparison to the cell interior and the ﬂuid outside the cell [ 60 , 61 ] ) . By using the general solution to Laplace’s equation in two dimensions [ 62 ] , we can ﬁnd V ( r , θ ) = − E 0 (cid:16) R 2 r + r (cid:17) cos θ . The electric ﬁeld as a function of position E ( r ) is then E = −∇ V = − ∂V ∂r ˆr − 1 r ∂V ∂θ ˆ θ = E 0 (cid:20)(cid:18) − R 2 r 2 + 1 (cid:19) cos θ ˆr + (cid:18) R 2 r 2 + 1 (cid:19) ( − sin θ ) ˆ θ (cid:21) . ( A2 ) We plot this in Fig . S1 . The tangential component ( the ˆ θ component ) at the cell boundary is − 2 E 0 sin θ . The tangential part of the electric ﬁeld at the cell membrane is thus proportional to the tangential part of the external ﬁeld , suggesting our assumption ( v = − µE sin θ ˆ θ ) with E the external electric ﬁeld is reasonable . The boundary condition ∂V / ∂r | r = R = 0 is the one used by [ 41 ] , but many diﬀerent boundary conditions , e . g . a ﬁnite conductivity , or treating the cell and its environment as uniform dielectric materials , will still lead to proportionality of this sort – but with a diﬀerent prefactor ( see , e . g . [ 62 , 63 ] for the sphere case ) . Appendix B : Spherical cell geometry The concentration of sensors on a spherical cell with an electric ﬁeld in the z direction is worked out in [ 41 ] as c ∼ e βE cos θ . We can generalize this to a ﬁeld in an arbitrary direction as p ( θ , φ ) ∼ exp ( β E · ˆ u ) , where ˆ u = ( cos φ sin θ , sin φ sin θ , cos θ ) is the unit vector on the sphere and the ﬁeld E = E ( cos ψ φ sin ψ θ , sin ψ φ sin ψ θ , cos ψ θ ) – this is the von Mises - Fisher distribution [ 43 ] . To model a cell on a substrate , where velocities can only be measured in the plane of the substrate , we will assume explicitly that the ﬁeld is in the xy plane ( ψ θ = π / 2 ) . In a 3D system , e . g . a single cell in extracellular matrix or in solution , the cell would have to estimate both the azimuthal and polar angle of the electric ﬁeld . However , wound healing and galvanotaxis are often on ﬂat substrates , where the cell has other information about the location of the substrate ( e . g . apicobasal polarity in epithelia ) . Thus , we assume that the polar angle is ﬁxed and the cell only needs to estimate the azimuthal angle ψ . This reduces the estimation on a sphere to a single 2 π - periodic variable , so our modiﬁed Cramer - Rao bound should hold . We can then , considering the azimuthal ﬁeld angle as ψ , write the probability distribution of a single sensor as p ( φ , θ ) = Z − 1 exp [ κ cos ( φ − ψ ) sin θ ] . For (cid:82) d θ sin θdφp ( φ , θ ) = 1 , we have Z = ( 4 π sinh κ ) / κ . Then , the log - likelihood takes the form ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = N ln (cid:104) κ 4 π sinh κ (cid:105) + κ N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i . ( B1 ) 9 We note that the second term on the right can be rewritten , so that the log - likelihood is ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = N ln (cid:104) κ 4 π sinh κ (cid:105) + β N (cid:88) i = 1 E · ˆ u xyi ( B2 ) = N ln (cid:104) κ 4 π sinh κ (cid:105) + β E · ρ xy , ( B3 ) where ˆ u xyi = ( cos φ i sin θ i , sin φ i sin θ i , 0 ) and ρ xy = (cid:80) i ˆ u xyi is the sum of the sensor locations – projected into the xy plane . The orientation of the ﬁeld E = E ( cos ψ , sin ψ , 0 ) that maximizes the likelihood is the one that puts E in line with ρ xy , exactly as in the 2D circle case ; ( we can also see this by explicitly diﬀerentiating the log - likelihood ; see Appendix C . ) FIG . S2 . Accuracy of galvanotactic estimation as a function of electric ﬁeld and number of sensors for a spherical cell . Solid lines are the simple periodic bound ( Eq . ( 8 ) in the main text ) , dashed lines are the normal Cramer - Rao bound ( Eq . ( 7 ) in the main text ) , symbols are computed from stochastic simulation . Inset shows zoomed in region in linear spacing , showing MLE variance is systematically above the periodic bound . Now we can compute the Fisher information by ﬁrst calculating the second derivatives : (cid:28) ∂ 2 ∂ψ 2 ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = − κ N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:104) cos ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i (cid:105) , ( B4 ) (cid:28) ∂ 2 ∂ψ∂E ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = β N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:104) sin ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i (cid:105) , ( B5 ) (cid:28) ∂ 2 ∂E 2 ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = − Nβ 2 sinh 2 κ − κ 2 κ 2 sinh 2 κ . ( B6 ) The expectation values (cid:104) cos ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i (cid:105) = κ − 1 ( κ coth κ − 1 ) and (cid:104) sin ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i (cid:105) = 0 by symmetry . By taking the negatives of the calculated derivatives , this gives us the ﬁnal Fisher information matrix I , I = N   κ coth κ − 1 0 0 β 2 sinh 2 κ − κ 2 κ 2 sinh 2 κ   . ( B7 ) The upper - left component of the matrix corresponds to I ( ψ ) , which was given as Eq . ( 6 ) in the main text . We show the spherical - cell errors as a function of βE and N in Fig . S2 . Here , the stochastic simulation is done by generating random sensors according to p ( φ , θ ) ∼ Z − 1 exp [ κ cos ( φ − ψ ) sin θ ] by rejection sampling ( we note that to sample from this distribution on the sphere , we are sampling from p ( φ , θ ) sin θ d θ d φ ) . For each parameter , we generate 1000 sensor conﬁgurations . For each conﬁguration , we compute the estimator ˆ ψ by summing sensor positions to ﬁnd ρ xy , and then use this to compute V . 10 Appendix C : Computing maximum likelihood estimators for ﬁeld direction and strength and corresponding Fisher informations For the circular cell model , the probability density of a single sensor is p ( θ ) = Z − 1 e κ cos ( θ − ψ ) . For p ( θ ) to integrate to one , Z = 2 πI 0 ( κ ) . We note κ = βE . Then the log - likelihood is , ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = − N ln [ 2 πI 0 ( κ ) ] + κ N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( θ i − ψ ) . ( C1 ) We discuss in the main text that the maximum - likelihood estimation of the electricial ﬁeld direction is to sum the vectors pointing in the direction of their electromobile sensors . Here we show this a little more explicitly , as well as showing how estimators for the electric ﬁeld magnitude can be derived for the circle and the sphere . The log - likelihood functions for a circular and spherical cell are given by Eqs . C1 and B1 , respectively . To ﬁnd the maximum likelihood estimator , we ﬁnd the value ˆ ψ that maximizes these log - likelihoods by diﬀerentiating each equation with ψ and setting this equal to zero , Circle : ∂ ∂ψ ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ψ = ˆ ψ = κ N (cid:88) i = 1 sin ( θ i − ˆ ψ ) = 0 , ( C2 ) Sphere : ∂ ∂ψ ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ψ = ˆ ψ = κ N (cid:88) i = 1 sin ( φ i − ˆ ψ ) sin θ i = 0 . ( C3 ) For the circle , we can solve for ˆ ψ by using the trigonometric identity (cid:80) sin ( θ i − ˆ ψ ) = (cid:80) ( sin θ i cos ˆ ψ − cos θ i sin ˆ ψ ) = 0 . Separating the two terms allows us to factor out ˆ ψ from the summation : cos ˆ ψ (cid:80) sin θ i = sin ˆ ψ (cid:80) cos θ i . From this juncture , we can then solve for the estimator , ˆ ψ , of the ﬁeld direction . An analogous calculation can be done for the sphere . These results are : Circle : tan ˆ ψ = (cid:80) Ni = 1 sin θ i (cid:80) Ni = 1 cos θ i , ( C4 ) Sphere : tan ˆ ψ = (cid:80) Ni = 1 sin φ i sin θ i (cid:80) Ni = 1 cos φ i sin θ i . ( C5 ) We see that the angle of the maximum likelihood estimator is obtained from the components of the summed vector of the sensor locations , ρ . In addition , we can ﬁnd the maximum likelihood estimator for the ﬁeld strength E . Diﬀerentiating the log - likelihood functions for the circle and sphere for the ﬁeld strength , E , yields : Circle : ∂ ∂E ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) E = ˆ E = β N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( θ i − ψ ) − βN I 1 ( ˆ κ ) I 0 ( ˆ κ ) = 0 , ( C6 ) Sphere : ∂ ∂E ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) E = ˆ E = β N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i + N ˆ E − Nβ tanh ˆ κ = 0 . ( C7 ) where ˆ κ = β ˆ E . We can then reorganize these equations to provide formulas for the maximum likelihood estimators . Circle : I 1 ( ˆ κ ) I 0 ( ˆ κ ) = 1 N N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( θ i − ψ ) , ( C8 ) Sphere : 1 ˆ κ ( ˆ κ coth ˆ κ − 1 ) = 1 N N (cid:88) i = 1 cos ( φ i − ψ ) sin θ i . ( C9 ) We cannot analytically solve for the electric ﬁeld here , but this provides a straightforward numerical way to ﬁnd the maximum likelihood estimator ˆ E . In the main paper , we have introduced the Fisher information for the ﬁeld direction only . However , it is straight - forward to extend the results to describe simultaneous estimation of the ﬁeld direction and strength . Simultaneously 11 estimating the ﬁeld strength does not change the accuracy of the directional estimate – as we might guess , because the estimator for the ﬁeld direction – the sum of sensor directions – doesn’t depend on ﬁeld strength . Then we can work out the Fisher information matrix components I αβ = − (cid:68) ∂ 2 ln L ∂α∂β (cid:69) where α , β are dummy variables indicating ﬁeld magnitude E or angle ψ . To do this , we compute : (cid:28) ∂ 2 ∂ψ 2 ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = − κ N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:104) cos ( θ i − ψ ) (cid:105) , ( C10 ) (cid:28) ∂ 2 ∂ψ∂E ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = β N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:104) sin ( θ i − ψ ) (cid:105) , ( C11 ) (cid:28) ∂ 2 ∂E 2 ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = − N β 2 2 (cid:34) 1 + I 2 ( κ ) I 0 ( κ ) − 2 (cid:18) I 1 ( κ ) I 0 ( κ ) (cid:19) 2 (cid:35) . ( C12 ) The expectation of the cosine is (cid:104) cos ( θ i − ψ ) (cid:105) = I 1 ( κ ) / I 0 ( κ ) and (cid:104) sin ( θ i − ψ ) (cid:105) = 0 by symmetry . This gives us the ﬁnal Fisher information matrix I , I = N    κI 1 ( κ ) I 0 ( κ ) 0 0 β 2 2 (cid:34) 1 + I 2 ( κ ) I 0 ( κ ) − 2 (cid:18) I 1 ( κ ) I 0 ( κ ) (cid:19) 2 (cid:35)    . ( C13 ) These results are known as the Fisher information associated with multiple samples of a von Mises distribution [ 43 ] . Appendix D : Periodic generalization of the Cramer - Rao bound We show here a brief derivation of the periodic Cramer - Rao bound of Eq . ( 8 ) in the main text . This result can also be directly derived from a variant of the periodic Cramer - Rao bound found in [ 43 ] , Chapter 5 , but we show a derivation here because it is relatively straightforward but not well known in the physics literature . We start with a standard derivation of the ordinary Cramer - Rao bound , similar to , e . g . , [ 45 ] . We use this here to show how the derivation of the periodic Cramer - Rao bound follows from similar logic . 1 . Ordinary Cramer - Rao bound derivation If we have a parameter ψ that we want to estimate from data x , we can construct an estimator ˆ ψ ( x ) . If the data is generated from a process with a probability density for the data given the parameter p ( x | ψ ) , then requiring that the estimator is unbiased is requiring (cid:104) ˆ ψ (cid:105) = ψ for all ψ i . e . (cid:90) d x ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) p ( x | ψ ) = 0 . ( D1 ) Because Eq . ( D1 ) is true for all values of the parameter ψ , we can take a derivative of Eq . ( D1 ) , ﬁnding : (cid:90) d x ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ p ( x | ψ ) − (cid:90) d x p ( x | ψ ) = 0 . ( D2 ) The second term is just 1 , since the probability density is normalized , so 1 = (cid:90) d x ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ p ( x | ψ ) , ( D3 ) 1 = (cid:90) d x ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) p ( x | ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) , ( D4 ) 1 2 = (cid:20)(cid:90) d x ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) p ( x | ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:21) 2 , ( D5 ) 1 = (cid:20)(cid:90) d x (cid:110)(cid:112) p ( x | ψ ) ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) (cid:111) (cid:26)(cid:112) p ( x | ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:27)(cid:21) 2 . ( D6 ) 12 In the last line we have split p into √ p √ p . Then we can apply the Cauchy - Schwarz inequality , (cid:0)(cid:82) d x f ( x ) g ( x ) (cid:1) 2 ≤ (cid:0)(cid:82) d x f ( x ) 2 (cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:82) d x g ( x ) 2 (cid:1) , which gives 1 ≤ (cid:20)(cid:90) d x p ( x | ψ ) ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) 2 (cid:21) (cid:34)(cid:90) d x p ( x | ψ ) (cid:18) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:19) 2 (cid:35) . ( D7 ) Rearranging , this is (cid:104) ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) 2 (cid:105) ≥ 1 (cid:42)(cid:18) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:19) 2 (cid:43) . ( D8 ) The value (cid:28)(cid:16) ∂∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:17) 2 (cid:29) is I ( ψ ) , the Fisher information for ψ , and can be equivalently written as (cid:28)(cid:16) ∂∂ψ ln L (cid:17) 2 (cid:29) = − (cid:68) ∂ 2 ∂ψ 2 ln L (cid:69) where L ( ψ ; x ) = p ( x | ψ ) is the likelihood [ 45 ] . This establishes the ordinary Cramer - Rao bound ( Eq . ( 7 ) in the main text ) . 2 . Generalization to periodic variables The ordinary Cramer - Rao bound fails for periodic variables in part because the normal deﬁnition of an unbiased estimator , (cid:104) ˆ ψ (cid:105) = ψ , will not be reasonable when the variable to be estimated is only deﬁned modulo 2 π : 2 π + ψ is just as good an estimate for ψ as ψ itself . We can deﬁne a generalized sense of “unbiased , ” for a periodic variable , deﬁning unbiased estimators ˆ ψ as having (cid:104) sin ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) = 0 [ 43 ] . While we note that any estimator we can think of as having an unbiased direction will have (cid:104) sin ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) , it would be possible to construct an estimator where ˆ ψ = ψ + π that also satisﬁes this constraint . Other periodic generalizations of the Cramer - Rao bound exist , with diﬀerent deﬁnitions of periodic unbiasedness , e . g . [ 64 ] . However , these generally require knowledge of the distribution of the estimator ˆ ψ in order to construct the bound , making them less useful in our context . The bound we will derive here , while correct , may be able to be improved . Beginning with this deﬁnition of an unbiased estimator , (cid:90) d x sin ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) p ( x | ψ ) = 0 . ( D9 ) We can take a derivative with respect to the parameter ψ : (cid:90) d x sin ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ p ( x | ψ ) − (cid:90) d x p ( x | ψ ) cos ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) = 0 . ( D10 ) The second term is just −(cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) . We can then follow a similar approach to the previous section , (cid:90) d x sin ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) p ( x | ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) = (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) , ( D11 ) (cid:20)(cid:90) d x (cid:112) p ( x | ψ ) sin ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) (cid:112) p ( x | ψ ) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:21) 2 = (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 . ( D12 ) Applying Cauchy - Schwarz , (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 ≤ (cid:20)(cid:90) d x p ( x | ψ ) sin 2 ( ˆ ψ ( x ) − ψ ) (cid:21) (cid:34)(cid:90) d x p ( x | ψ ) (cid:18) ∂ ∂ψ ln p ( x | ψ ) (cid:19) 2 (cid:35) , ( D13 ) (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 ≤ (cid:104) sin 2 ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105)I ( ψ ) . ( D14 ) This bound is the analogous bound to the Cramer - Rao bound , but unfortunately this bound depends not only on the Fisher information I ( ψ ) but also (cid:104) sin 2 ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) – making it diﬃcult to apply when we do not know the distribution 13 of ˆ ψ . We can get a more easily applied result – at the cost of weakening the bound slightly . We start by rewriting (cid:104) sin 2 ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) = 1 − (cid:104) cos 2 ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) . Then (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 ≤ (cid:16) 1 − (cid:104) cos 2 ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) (cid:17) I ( ψ ) . ( D15 ) Because (cid:104) cos 2 ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ≥ (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 ( by the positivity of the variance , or the Cauchy - Schwarz inequality again ) , (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 ≤ (cid:16) 1 − (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 (cid:17) I ( ψ ) , ( D16 ) [ 1 + I ( ψ ) ] (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) 2 ≤ I ( ψ ) , ( D17 ) (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ≤ (cid:115) I ( ψ ) 1 + I ( ψ ) . ( D18 ) This is Eq . ( 8 ) in the main text . This reduces to the ordinary Cramer - Rao bound in the limit of large I ( ψ ) , in which case we expect the distribution of ˆ ψ becomes closely localized to ψ , so (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ≈ 1 − 12 (cid:104) ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) 2 (cid:105) . Simultaneously , (cid:112) I / ( 1 + I ) = (cid:112) 1 / ( I − 1 + 1 ) ≈ 1 − 12 I , so the bound Eq . ( 8 ) becomes Eq . ( 7 ) . Appendix E : Generalization to multiple sensor types We brieﬂy mention here the possibility that there are multiple sensor types with diﬀerent properties . This would seem reasonable , as any membrane - bound molecule with charge could serve as a sensor if the cell can interpret its location reliably . There are also known multiple receptor types for chemoattractants like cAMP [ 65 ] . If each sensor has its own value of β i = µ i R / D i , then the probability density of a single sensor is p i ( θ ) = Z − 1 e κ i cos ( θ − ψ ) with Z = 2 πI 0 ( κ i ) and κ i = β i E . Then the log - likelihood for N sensors is ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) = − (cid:88) i ln [ 2 πI 0 ( κ i ) ] + N (cid:88) i = 1 κ i cos ( θ i − ψ ) . ( E1 ) and the Fisher information for the angle is I ( ψ ) = − (cid:28) d 2 dψ 2 ln L ( ψ , E ; θ ) (cid:29) = N (cid:88) i = 1 κ i (cid:104) cos ( θ i − ψ ) (cid:105) = N (cid:88) i = 1 κ i I 1 ( κ i ) I 0 ( κ i ) . ( E2 ) Importantly , in the limit of weakly polarized cells , i . e . κ i (cid:28) 1 for all i , then we can expand the Bessel functions as before and ﬁnd I ( ψ ) ≈ 1 2 N (cid:88) i = 1 κ 2 i = E 2 2 N (cid:88) i = 1 β 2 i . ( E3 ) This means that even if there are multiple sensors , we should still expect to see (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) ≈ (cid:112) γ 2 E 2 / ( 1 + γ 2 E 2 ) if cells are near their optimal sensing abilities . However , in this case , γ 2 = (cid:80) Ni = 1 β 2 i / 2 is an eﬀective averaged value for the diﬀerent sensors . Appendix F : Eﬀects of downstream noise and alternate models for neural crest data In the main text , we have essentially assumed that single cells perfectly follow their estimation of the ﬁeld direction ˆ ψ . However , we know that there are other sources of noise in directed cell migration , both in processing the signal [ 52 ] and in stochastic events in motility itself . This will be particularly important at large ﬁeld strengths , where the cell gets a large amount of information from the ﬁeld – the downstream noise can be the dominant source of error , as has been observed in chemotaxis at large gradient strengths [ 22 ] . To model this downstream noise , we assume that the cell , instead of following the estimator ˆ ψ perfectly , instead travels in a direction ψ v = ˆ ψ + δ , where δ is a random noise that is symmetric around δ = 0 and independent from the sensor locations . If this is the case , then the 14 FIG . S3 . Alternative ﬁt with model using a maximum value of ∼ 0 . 83 . directionality of the cell’s velocity ψ v from the true ﬁeld direction is reduced from our bound , (cid:104) cos ( ψ v − ψ ) (cid:105) = (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ + δ ) (cid:105) ( F1 ) = (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) cos δ − sin ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) sin δ (cid:105) ( F2 ) = (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105)(cid:104) cos δ (cid:105) − (cid:104) sin ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105)(cid:104) sin δ (cid:105) ( F3 ) = (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105)(cid:104) cos δ (cid:105) , ( F4 ) where the last step comes from the assumption that the distribution of noise P ( δ ) is symmetric about δ = 0 . If we have δ uniformly distributed over a range ± ∆ , then (cid:104) cos δ (cid:105) = sin ∆ / ∆ . We see from the data in Fig . 3 in the main paper that directionality , even at large ﬁelds , does not exceed a value of roughly ∼ 0 . 8 . We thus choose ∆ = π / 3 or (cid:104) cos δ (cid:105) ≈ 0 . 83 and ﬁt the experimental data to Eq . ( F4 ) , assuming that (cid:104) cos ( ˆ ψ − ψ ) (cid:105) is given by the bound of Eq . ( 8 ) in the main text ( Fig . ( S3 ) ) . The ﬁt quality is similar with this set of assumptions to that in Fig . 3 . However , if we choose this alternate assumption , we ﬁnd diﬀerent , larger values for γ relative to Fig . 3 in the main text ( γ - values are 2 . 7 × 10 − 3 , 4 . 4 × 10 − 3 , and 2 . 7 × 10 − 3 mm / mV for keratocytes , neural crest , and granulocytes , respectively ) . If we assume ( motivated by measurements of the polarity cathode / anode ratio being 2 . 0 ) β = 3 . 5 × 10 − 4 mm / mV as in the main text , the estimated number of sensors increases to 170 − 480 . If we assume a ﬁxed number of 10 4 sensors , the ratio of cathode / anode concentration at 1000 mV / mm would be 1 . 10 − 1 . 17 , i . e . the level of polarization required to explain the data would increase by about 6 % from the previous maximum cathode / anode ratio of 1 . 10 . The increase in required polarization or sensors when we assume downstream noise makes sense . Given the downstream noise , the directionality for a ﬁxed amount of information decreases , so the cell would need more sensors or be more polarized ( larger β ) to achieve the same level of directionality as before . However , the assumption of downstream noise at these moderate levels does not qualitatively change the core predictions of the paper that cells may sense with small numbers ( a few hundred ) of sensors that are highly polarized or large numbers of weakly - polarized sensors . 1 . Neural crest data ﬁt separately We note that in particular , the neural crest data in Fig . 3 is not a perfect ﬁt with the curve . This may reﬂect , to some extent , systematic or random errors – we view the overall ﬁt of Fig . 3 as fairly rough . However , an alternate view of this data is that , because directionality is large even at the lowest ﬁelds ( but presumably zero at zero ﬁeld ) , the cells must have near - perfect information at the low ﬁelds . In this view , the deviation from perfect directionality is due to downstream noise , which could then vary with electric ﬁeld . To some extent , an alternative model like this is diﬃcult to disprove – we can always invoke increasingly complicated downstream processes . To be truly convinced of the eﬀect of sensor diﬀusive noise , we would need to know what the sensor molecule ( s ) are and their concentration . We focus on the ﬁrst four neural crest data points , which show the largest deviation from our original model ( Fig . S4 ) . If we assume a downstream noise so (cid:104) cos δ (cid:105) ≈ 0 . 37 ( ∆ = e − π / 6 ) , we can ﬁt the neural crest data separately . With this ﬁt , we ﬁnd a bigger γ − value of 5 . 2 × 10 − 2 mm / mV . If we assume β = 3 . 5 × 10 − 4 mm / mV , this would correspond to a number of sensors of about 6 . 5 × 10 4 – about 50 sensors per square micron on a 10 - micron - radius cell . 15 FIG . S4 . First few neural crest data points ﬁt to bound with downstream noise . Correspondingly , this γ value would correspond to a cathode / anode ratio of ∼ 6 if the number of sensors is ﬁxed at 10 4 . These values are larger than our predictions in the main text , but might also be plausible . Another possibility for the deviation between our model and the neural crest cell data is that neural crest cell galvanotaxis is qualitatively diﬀerent in some way from keratocyte and granulocyte galvanotaxis . In fact , paper that originally measured neural crest galvanotaxis [ 19 ] speculates that neural crest galvanotaxis and granulocyte galvanotaxis occur through diﬀerent mechanisms . This is also supported by data showing that the response of neural crest cells exposed to a ﬁeld being turned on can be complex , with polarization occurring in two phases [ 66 ] . This two - stage polarization would not be seen in our model . However , if , for instance , additional sensors are expressed on the surface in response to ﬁelds turning on , this sort of directionality change might occur . Appendix G : Prediction of size dependence does not depend on number of sensors In Fig . 4 in the main paper , we plot the directionality as a function of cell radius predicted by our bound . We did this by picking a value N = 10 4 , but the results do not depend on this choice . We show this in Fig . S5 . We start with γ ﬁt for keratocytes from Fig . 3 in the main text , γ = 0 . 002 mm / mV . Since we cannot separate β and N in our ﬁt , we show several values of N and then pick the corresponding value of β at the reference radius , β 0 = γ (cid:112) d / N = µR 0 / D , where R 0 is the reference keratocyte radius . As expected , because the Fisher information only depends on γ in the limit of smaller electric ﬁelds , these lines all collapse ( Fig . S5 ) . Similarly , we can perform stochastic simulations with diﬀerent numbers of sensors N with varying β 0 , and compute the sensor - direction - sum MLE direction , and see that the directionalities predicted from these simulations are also independent of the choice of N . However , because we are in the limit of Fig . 1 where there are deviations between the MLE estimator and the best - possible accuracy , these are systematically below the bound . However , the dependence on radius is similar . If we ﬁt our data to the MLE instead of to the bound , we would expect similar values , but a diﬀerence of about a factor of 2 in the predicted number of receptors . The results on radius - dependence can also be generalized to the spherical cell assumption . We see a near - identical dependence on radius from our model between sphere and circular cell ( Fig . S6 ) . This is , of course , what we would expect given Fig . 4 in the main text , because the Fisher information I ( ψ ) diﬀers only by a constant factor between d = 2 and d = 3 , and this factor has been absorbed into γ . We can only extract γ from the collapsed experimental data , but we also only need γ to reliably predict the radius - dependence . Appendix H : Alternate model : changing sensor number with cell size In the main text , we have assumed that , in comparing diﬀerent cells with diﬀerent radii , they still have the same number of sensors . This would be reasonable if , for instance , the cells have diﬀerent areas because they have diﬀerent levels of spreading on the surface – e . g . if in three dimensions they have similar volumes and surface areas , but their measured areas when projected on the 2D substrate are diﬀerent . However , if cells have diﬀerent volumes due to , e . g . being in diﬀerent stages in the cell cycle , we might expect diﬀerent numbers of sensors . The most natural assumption would be then that the sensors are at a ﬁxed concentration on the membrane , i . e . that the number per unit surface 16 FIG . S5 . Dependence of directionality on cell radius . Lines are the periodic bound with the Fisher information for a circle , symbols are stochastic simulation . γ 2 = Nβ 2 / d is ﬁt to the data of [ 2 ] , γ = 0 . 002 mm / mV , and the E ﬁeld used is 600 mV / mm . d = 2 .

Lines are the periodic bound with the Fisher information for a sphere , symbols are stochastic simulation . γ 2 = Nβ 2 / d is ﬁt to the data of [ 2 ] , γ = 0 . 002 mm / mV , and the E ﬁeld used is 600 mV / mm . d = 3 . area of the cell is ﬁxed ( as a side note , some protein species tend to be kept at a ﬁxed concentration , but others have concentrations that scale diﬀerently with cell size [ 67 ] ; this is an active area of research ) . We show in Fig . S7 how the results of Fig . 4 in the main text would diﬀer if we instead assumed that sensor number is proportional to the cell surface area , e . g . choosing N = ( R / R 0 ) 2 N 0 . We see a stronger dependence on R , as we would expect , but again because of the relatively small range of radii and the large error bars , this is not very diﬀerent in terms of comparison to experiment . Appendix I : Distribution of cell directionality under constant ﬁelds In Fig . 4 in the main text , we see a broad distribution of directionalities from single cells , including directionalities near - 1 . This is a common feature of distributions of the cosine of an angle , and are also reproduced in our simulations . We show in Fig . S8 the distribution of directionality for a Brownian dynamics simulations with parameters appropriate 17 FIG . S7 . Comparison between experiment and theory on cell size dependence using diﬀerent assumptions about how N scales with cell size . Lines are the periodic Cramer - Rao bound with the Fisher information for a circular cell , symbols are experimental data from [ 2 ] . γ = 0 . 002 mm / mV is the ﬁt to [ 2 ] from Fig . 3 in the main text , and E = 600 mV / mm . d = 2 . to Fig . 4 . We see that the distribution has peaks at both + 1 and - 1 , and a broad population of cells with intermediate directionalities . This is not unique to galvanotaxis , as it is observed in many experiments on chemotaxis or other single - cell directed motility ( for example , see Fig . 1c of [ 68 ] ) . FIG . S8 . Histogram of cell directionalities over simulation time course with constant electric ﬁeld . κ = 0 . 0168 . N = 10000 sensors . This corresponds to γ = 0 . 002 mm / mV , to match the experiment in Fig . 4 . E = 600 mV / mm . This distribution was produced by ﬁrst simulating 1000 cells with 10000 sensors using the Brownian Dynamics model Eq . ( 13 ) , estimating ˆ ψ using Eq . ( 5 ) , and then calculating the directionality . Fundamentally , the broad distribution of directionalities in Fig . S8 and Fig . 4 arises from changing variables from an angle x to the cosine of the angle cos x . Even if x is uniformly distributed , the distribution P ( cos x ) is broad and peaked at cos x = ± 1 , because cos x is slowly varying when cos x ≈ ± 1 . This arises from a Jacobian factor in doing the change - of - variables for probability densities ( see , e . g . Chapter 2 of [ 69 ] ) . Appendix J : More details of cells in switching ﬁelds We show a simulation using the same setup as Fig . 6 but switch the ﬁeld between larger angles , switching between ± π / 2 in Fig . S9 . In the main text ( Fig . 6a ) we see the averaged directionality over 1000 cells as a function of time for diﬀerent exposure times ( ET ) of a switching ﬁeld . The distribution of the individual cell directionalities ( Fig . S10 ) reveals that ET aﬀects the distribution skewness . Lower exposure times have relatively small skew , which aligns with the rapid 18 FIG . S9 . Directionality as a function of dimensionless time ˜ t for switching angle ± π / 2 for diﬀerent values of the exposure time ET . Parameters and simulation set up are the same as in Fig . 6b of the main text . oscillation we see in Fig . 6a of the main text that are fairly symmetric . However , higher ET shows cells spending more and more time aligned with the ﬁeld , skewing the directionalities closer to a value of one . FIG . S10 . Histograms of cell directionalities over simulation time course with switching electric ﬁeld for diﬀerent ET . Appendix K : Simple model to compute the maximum - likelihood estimator The core idea of this simple model is that the cell makes local protrusions normal to its boundary where there is a high concentration of local sensor . This is consistent with , e . g . recent work showing that local charge actually can regulate protrusion [ 70 ] . The idea that cell direction and shape are controlled by protrusions normal to the boundary is a classic one [ 71 , 72 ] . With this idea , we write a force density exerted by the cell at position θ as f ( θ ) = ˆ n N (cid:88) i = 1 g ( θ − θ i ) , ( K1 ) where ˆ n = ( cos θ , sin θ ) is the local normal . Here , the sum (cid:80) Ni = 1 g ( θ − θ i ) is a way to create a smoothed picture of the local sensors – if g ( θ ) were a delta function , this would be spikes at the location of sensors . We show a sketch of this function for a small number of sensors in Fig . S11 . The total force exerted by the cell’s motility around the periphery is then just F = R (cid:90) d θ f ( θ ) = R (cid:90) d θ ˆ n N (cid:88) i = 1 g ( θ − θ i ) . ( K2 ) 19 FIG . S11 . Illustration of local protrusion model . Red line shows the sum (cid:80) Ni = 1 g ( θ − θ i ) for sensors ( black dots ) . We ﬁnd that the direction of the force applied to the cell will be in the direction of the maximum - likelihood estimator of direction ρ as discussed in the main direction . This will happen with most reasonable functions g ( u ) , if we assume two very natural properties of the function g ( u ) . First , g should be symmetric around u = 0 – assuming otherwise would create a local chirality of the cell . Second , g ( u ) should be 2 π − periodic , g ( u + 2 π ) = g ( u ) . The x component of the force is F x = R (cid:90) 2 π 0 d θ cos θ N (cid:88) i = 1 g ( θ − θ i ) ( K3 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:90) 2 π 0 d θ cos θg ( θ − θ i ) ( K4 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u cos ( u + θ i ) g ( u ) ( K5 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u [ cos u cos θ i − sin u sin θ i ] g ( u ) , ( K6 ) where we have made the substitution u = θ − θ i and used the cosine angle addition formula . Then , we ﬁnd F x = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:34) cos θ i (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u cos u g ( u ) − sin θ i (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u sin u g ( u ) (cid:35) . ( K7 ) Assuming the periodicity of g ( u ) , the integrals over the region [ − θ i , 0 ] would be exactly the same as integrating over the region [ 2 π − θ i , 2 π ] , so we get F x = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:20) cos θ i (cid:90) 2 π 0 d u cos ug ( u ) − sin θ i (cid:90) 2 π 0 d u sin ug ( u ) (cid:21) ( K8 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 cos θ i (cid:90) 2 π 0 d u cos ug ( u ) ( K9 ) = F 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 cos θ i , ( K10 ) where we have noted that , because g ( u ) is even and periodic , (cid:82) 2 π 0 d u sin ug ( u ) = 0 , and F 0 = R (cid:82) 2 π 0 d u cos ug ( u ) is a 20 constant . Similarly , for the y component of the force F y = R (cid:90) 2 π 0 d θ sin θ N (cid:88) i = 1 g ( θ − θ i ) ( K11 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:90) 2 π 0 d θ sin θg ( θ − θ i ) ( K12 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u sin ( u + θ i ) g ( u ) ( K13 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u [ sin u cos θ i + cos u sin θ i ] g ( u ) ( K14 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:34) cos θ i (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u sin ug ( u ) + sin θ i (cid:90) 2 π − θ i − θ i d u cos ug ( u ) (cid:35) ( K15 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:20) cos θ i (cid:90) 2 π 0 d u sin ug ( u ) + sin θ i (cid:90) 2 π 0 d u cos ug ( u ) (cid:21) ( K16 ) = R N (cid:88) i = 1 sin θ i (cid:90) 2 π 0 d u cos ug ( u ) ( K17 ) = F 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 sin θ i . ( K18 ) We thus see that the total force applied to the cell will be in exactly the direction ρ = (cid:80) i ( cos θ i , sin θ i ) . This will then lead to a motion in the direction ρ ; the velocity could be found by balancing the total exerted force with the drag on the cell , e . g . as done in a related model for collective chemotaxis [ 73 ] . The only requirement is that the cell is able to make local protrusions in a normal direction . This model is – naturally – somewhat of an oversimpliﬁcation , as we have not included any representations of cell polarity or protrusion dynamics beyond the simple function g ( u ) . However , we argue that this model shows the essentially plausibility that the cell can compute the direction ρ . [ 1 ] S . SenGupta , C . A . Parent , and J . E .
