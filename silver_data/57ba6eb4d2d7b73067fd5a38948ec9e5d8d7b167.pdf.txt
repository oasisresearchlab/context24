The World Health Organization recommends that 3 countries use existing influenza surveillance to monitor COVID - 19 transmission in 4 communities . We aim to describe the surveillance and investigation of COVID - 19 at 5 the early stage of the pandemic in Taiwan . 6 Methods : In February 2020 , the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control enhanced 7 COVID - 19 surveillance through its existing influenza surveillance . We retrospectively 8 tested patients for SARS - CoV - 2 who had symptoms of severe complicated influenza 9 but were negative in influenza testing . We conducted an epidemiological investigation 10 and contact tracing for the index patient and secondary cases to prevent virus 11 transmission . 12 Results : We identified the first COVID - 19 patient on February 15 through enhanced 13 COVID - 19 surveillance . He had no history of traveling abroad and an unclear history 14 of contact with COVID - 19 cases . He presented with influenza - like illness on January 15 27 and was hospitalized from February 3 to 15 . We identified 39 close contacts of the 16 index patient , including 11 family members and 28 healthcare workers . In total , four 17 close family contacts of the index patient tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . An 18 additional 84 close contacts of the four secondary cases were identified and traced ; none 19 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f was diagnosed with COVID - 19 . 20 Conclusions : We recommend enhancing COVID - 19 surveillance by testing patients 21 with influenza - like illness . To prevent the spread of COVID - 19 , we recommend using 22 appropriate personal protective equipment when in close contact with patients who 23 present with influenza - like illness or when caring for patients with pneumonia of 24 unknown etiology . 25 Keywords : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , influenza surveillance , epidemiological 26 investigation , contact tracing 27 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Introduction 28 In response to the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , the 29 Taiwan Centers for Disease Control ( TCDC ) listed COVID - 19 as a notifiable disease 30 on January 15 , 2020 . From January 21 to February 14 , 2020 , there were a total of 18 31 COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan , all of which were imported or import - related cases . At 32 the same time , seasonal influenza virus was circulating in the community . 33 Because COVID - 19 and influenza - like illness ( ILI ) have similar clinical 34 presentations—from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe symptoms , 35 complications , and death—it is suggested that using existing influenza surveillance 36 systems is an effective way to detect COVID - 19 in the community . 1 - 3 Severe , 37 complicated influenza is a notifiable disease in Taiwan ; it is defined as ILI causing 38 death or the need for intensive care due to severe complications within two weeks of 39 illness onset . Severe complicated influenza must be reported to the National 40 Notifiable Disease Surveillance System ( NNDSS ) , and the patients must be tested for 41 influenza by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . 4 , 5 To identify 42 local COVID - 19 cases early , TCDC conducted an enhanced COVID - 19 surveillance 43 program through an existing influenza surveillance system . 44 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Here , we report a locally acquired case of COVID - 19 identified by an existing 45 influenza surveillance system and the epidemiological investigation of COVID - 19 46 cases to prevent further transmission . 47 48 Methods 49 Enhanced COVID - 19 surveillance program 50 TCDC conducted enhanced COVID - 19 surveillance through an existing influenza 51 surveillance system , beginning February 12 , 2020 . Since January 31 , 2020 , throat 52 swabs from patients whose symptoms were compatible with severe complicated 53 influenza ( a national notifiable disease in Taiwan ) but who tested negative for 54 influenza by RT - PCR were retrospectively tested for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR . 55 Definitions 56 Patients were considered to have COVID - 19 if they tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 57 by RT - PCR . The index patient was defined as the first to have COVID - 19 identified 58 by the existing influenza surveillance system in this familial cluster . Secondary cases 59 were defined by testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR after contact with the 60 index patient . 61 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Persons were considered to have had close contact with a COVID - 19 patient if they 62 were within two meters for ≧ 15 minutes or if they were healthcare workers ( HCWs ) 63 who provided medical care or performed aerosol generating procedures ( AGPs ) to a 64 COVID - 19 patient without appropriate personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . 65 Epidemiological investigations 66 We started the investigation immediately after the index case tested positive for 67 COVID - 19 on February 15 , 2020 . We interviewed family members , healthcare 68 workers , and colleagues of the index patient and secondary cases for their history of 69 traveling abroad , exposure , and activities ; a standard questionnaire was used to 70 identify close contacts and to confirm whether secondary cases had other possible 71 sources of infection . We also reviewed medical records and infection control practices 72 in the hospital to identify the clinical course of the index patient and AGPs during the 73 hospitalization . 74 To identify close contacts and evaluate their risk of infection in different settings , we 75 visited healthcare , occupational , and other settings and checked surveillance videos to 76 confirm the manner of contact with the COVID - 19 patient and use or nonuse of PPE . 77 Close contacts of COVID - 19 patients were identified and interviewed within 24 hours 78 by officials at the Taiwan Field Epidemiology Training Program ( Taiwan FETP ) , the 79 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f regional center of TCDC and local health bureau . All close contacts were tested for 80 SARS - CoV - 2 when they were identified and then were quarantined for 14 days after 81 last exposure to a COVID - 19 patient ; during quarantine , their health status was 82 tracked . If the close contacts developed fever ( temperature ≥ 38℃ ) or any respiratory 83 symptoms during quarantine , local health bureau officials arranged for their 84 admission , isolation , and retesting for SARS - CoV - 2 , as well as reports to the NNDSS . 85 Before returning to work in the hospital , all HCWs had to be negative when retested 86 for SARS - CoV - 2 . 87 Laboratory testing 88 Throat swab specimens were obtained from all close contacts in family and health 89 care settings and tested for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR in the national laboratory of the 90 TCDC ; other close contacts were tested on the basis of risk of infection . RT - PCR was 91 performed according to the “Detection of Viral RNA of SARS - CoV - 2 Protocol” 92 issued by the TCDC . 6 Because this investigation was for an emergency public health 93 issue , an ethics review was not carried out . 94 Results 95 The index patient identified by enhanced COVID - 19 surveillance program 96 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f From January 31 to February 15 , 2020 , a total of 113 specimens from patients with 97 symptoms compatible with severe complicated influenza but who tested negative for 98 influenza were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . Among them , only one tested positive for 99 COVID - 19 as of February 15 ; this was the first patient with locally acquired COVID - 100 19 identified by influenza surveillance and was therefore the index patient in our 101 investigation . During the same period , 114 patients were reported to have severe 102 complicated influenza and tested positive for influenza . 103 The index patient was a 62 - year - old male who had no history of traveling abroad within 104 14 days prior to symptom onset . According to his family members , he was a taxi driver 105 in central and southern Taiwan and had underlying conditions of hypertension , diabetes , 106 and hepatitis B . He presented a cough on January 27 and a fever on January 28 . He 107 initially was positive for influenza by rapid influenza antigen test when he visited the 108 clinic on February 1 , but he tested negative for influenza by RT - PCR when he was 109 hospitalized on February 3 for pneumonia of unknown etiology . He died on February 110 15 . 111 To limit further transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , the Taiwan FETP conducted an 112 epidemiological investigation and contact tracing of the index patient ( hereafter 113 referred to as Case 1 ) . 114 Epidemiological investigation 115 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f In total , 10 family members attended a luncheon with Case 1 on January 27 in an air - 116 conditioned indoor restaurant without windows . Their table was located in the center 117 of the restaurant , and the distance between each table was less than 1 . 5 meters . They 118 sat around a round table at a distance of less than 1 . 5 meters without wearing masks . 119 They saw Case 1 cough several times during the meal . No family members met Case 120 1 after the meal , except for the two household contacts : Case 1’s mother and brother . 121 Another close contact reported seeing Case 1 once in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) 122 between February 4 and February 15 , and she was wearing a surgical mask and gloves 123 during the hospital visit . 124 We identified 11 family close contacts of Case 1 , including 10 family members who 125 ate lunch with Case 1 and one family member who visited Case 1 in the hospital . All 126 family close contacts were quarantined on February 16 to enable tracking of 127 symptoms and testing for SARS - CoV - 2 . Five of the 11 family contacts of Case 1 128 developed respiratory symptoms within 14 days after their last contact with Case 1 , 129 which was at the family luncheon on January 27 . Four ( 40 % ) of the 10 family 130 contacts who had eaten lunch with Case 1 tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . We also 131 contacted customers who ate lunch at adjacent tables at the same time on January 27 , 132 and none had symptoms . The floor plan of the restaurant and the seating arrangements 133 for the family are shown in Figure 1 . The four secondary cases are hereafter referred 134 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f to as Case 2 ( younger brother of Case 1 ) , Case 3 ( mother of Case 1 ) , Case 4 ( niece of 135 Case 1 and son - in - law of Case 5 ) , and Case 5 ( younger sister of Case 1 ) . Because 136 Case 2 and Case 3 were also the household contacts of Case 1 , the household 137 secondary attack rate was 100 % . The family tree of this familial cluster of COVID - 19 138 is shown in Figure 2 . 139 The medical records of Case 1 showed that he sought medical treatment at a 140 pharmacy on January 28 and visited a clinic on February 1 , where the diagnosis was 141 suspected influenza infection . Because his symptoms had not improved and he had 142 developed shortness of breath , on February 3 he sought medical assistance at the 143 outpatient department of a hospital . A chest X - ray was obtained and showed 144 pneumonia with bilateral lower - lung - field alveolar process . The patient was 145 transferred to the emergency room ( ER ) . His condition worsened quickly , with 146 unstable hemodynamics , and he was admitted to the ICU . On February 4 he was 147 intubated for mechanical ventilation with a closed circuit . The index patient died of 148 severe pneumonia and sepsis on the night of February 15 . 149 Enhanced infection control measures for COVID - 19 had been implemented in the 150 hospital on January 1 , 2020 . These measures included reminding HCWs , patients , and 151 accompanying persons to wear masks and disinfect their hands at the entrance . During 152 the hospital stay of Case 1 , airborne precautions were put in place ( February 3 – 13 ) , 153 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f but surgical masks were used rather than N95 masks ( February 14 – 15 ) . Therefore , 154 HCWs who wore surgical masks in the ER and ICU were listed as close contacts of 155 Case 1 . We identified 28 close contacts among HCWs in the hospital : one doctor , 21 156 nurses , three assistants , and three respiratory therapists . One nurse had developed 157 respiratory symptoms within 14 days after last contact with Case 1 . However , no close 158 contacts of HCWs tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . 159 Secondary cases 160 Among four secondary cases , there are two males and two females , with ages ranging 161 from 31 to 88 years . One were asymptomatic ( 25 % ) , two ( 50 % ) had fever ( higher 162 than 38 ℃ ) , two ( 50 % ) had cough , two ( 50 % ) had sore throat , two ( 50 % ) had 163 rhinorrhea , one ( 25 % ) had headache , and one ( 25 % ) had general weakness . The 164 symptom onset dates of the secondary cases were January 28 , February 3 , February 5 165 and February 15 , respectively . A timeline showing epidemiological information for 166 the COVID - 19 patients in the cluster is shown in Figure 3 . 167 No secondary cases had a history of traveling abroad in recent months or of being in 168 contact with any other confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 patients . The only clear and 169 common exposure of four secondary cases was eating lunch with Case 1 . 170 In total , 84 close contacts of the four secondary cases were identified in different 171 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f settings , including one funeral staff member , two relatives , three neighbors , two 172 restaurant workers , two HCWs , and 74 colleagues . All close contacts were 173 quarantined for 14 days to monitor whether they developed any symptoms . During the 174 14 - day quarantine period , a total of seven close contacts developed respiratory 175 symptoms and were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . A total of 74 close contacts of secondary 176 cases were tested whether they were symptomatic or not ; however , none of them was 177 confirmed to have SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 178 In summary , we identified 123 close contacts in this familial cluster , and 13 ( 10 . 6 % ) 179 developed symptoms ; however , only four family members of Case 1 ( 3 . 3 % ) were 180 diagnosed with COVID - 19 . 181 A summary of close contacts for each COVID - 19 patient is shown in Table 1 . 182 Discussion 183 We identified the first case of locally acquired COVID - 19 through existing influenza 184 surveillance in Taiwan . The index patient presented with ILI and the initial diagnosis 185 was influenza . Because COVID - 19 and influenza infection could have similar 186 presentations – from mild to severe , some countries also identified COVID - 19 patients 187 earlier than official reports with retrospectively tested respiratory samples of patients 188 with ILI or acute respiratory disease . 2 , 11 , 12 On the basis of our finding , we recommend 189 enhancing COVID - 19 surveillance by testing ILI patients with pneumonia for SARS - 190 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f CoV - 2 . 191 We found the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 within the family occurred mainly through 192 close contact with the symptomatic index patient in the absence of masks . All secondary 193 cases were presumably infected by eating lunch with the index patient , with a secondary 194 attack rate of 40 % . However , there were two secondary cases among the luncheon 195 attendees who were also household close contacts of Case 1 . The household secondary 196 attack rate was 100 % , so we could not exclude the possibility of household transmission . 197 Households have been reported to be the primary setting in outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 1 , 198 MERS - CoV , and SARS - CoV - 2 infection as a result of more frequent close contacts . 199 7 , 8 , 13 - 15 We recommend that people keep social distance and wear a mask when having 200 contact with a symptomatic person . In addition , we found one ( 25 % ) of the four 201 secondary cases were asymptomatic in this familial cluster . It has been reported that 202 presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS - CoV - 2 . 16 , 17 Thus , 203 family close contacts of a COVID - 19 patient should be identified , tested , and 204 quarantined early , regardless of symptoms . 205 All HCWs who had been exposed to the index patient were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . 206 However , none of them tested positive . We inferred that wearing a surgical mask still 207 provides a certain degree of protection from infection for HCWs . Similar to other 208 reports , all exposed HCWs also wore surgical masks during medical procedures , and 209 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f no secondary infection was found to occur among them . 18 Some reports on nosocomial 210 outbreaks of COVID - 19 have demonstrated that HCWs have higher risk for COVID - 211 19 infection and therefore could cause further transmission . 9 , 10 Our finding supported 212 that HCWs should follow infection control measures , including using PPE and good 213 hand hygiene when caring for patients with pneumonia , to prevent infection and further 214 transmission . 215 In our investigation , all close contacts in the family and healthcare settings were tracked 216 and tested for SARS - CoV - 2 whether they were symptomatic or not , so we were able to 217 determine the settings or exposure scenarios in which close contacts were more likely 218 to acquire infection . 219 The first limitation of this investigation is recall bias . Because Case 1 died on the same 220 day that our investigation started ( on February 15 ) , the exposure and contact history of 221 Case 1 could be obtained only from his family members and medical records . The exact 222 date of onset of his symptoms remained uncertain , and we may have missed some close 223 contacts that were not identified , which implies that the risk of virus transmission in the 224 community still existed . Second , among close contacts in this familial cluster , only 225 HCWs and symptomatic persons needed to be retested for SARS - CoV - 2 ; others were 226 tested only once , at an early stage in our investigation . Thus , we were unable to identify 227 other asymptomatic COVID - 19 patients in this investigation . Third , the definition of 228 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f close contact used in our investigation may be insufficient for subsequent epidemics 229 due to SARS - CoV - 2 variants . However , it was still a concise , clear definition for public 230 health workers or the general public to identify close contacts rapidly and timely , 231 especially during the early phase of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Taiwan . 232 233 To prevent a COVID - 19 outbreak , we recommend enhancing COVID - 19 surveillance 234 by testing ILI patients with pneumonia for SARS - CoV - 2 . In fact , TCDC continues to 235 detect COVID - 19 through the existing influenza surveillance system . Family close 236 contacts of COVID - 19 patients should be traced , tested , and quarantined as early as 237 possible , whether they are symptomatic or not . HCWs should follow infection control 238 practices and use appropriate PPE when caring for patients with pneumonia of unknown 239 etiology . 240 241 Acknowledgments 242 The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the Changhua County Public 243 Health Bureau , Health Bureau of Taichung City Government , and Central Regional 244 Control Center of TCDC in the epidemiological investigation . 245 246 Conflicts of Interest Statement 247 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest . 248 249 Funding 250 The study was supported by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control without grant funding . 251 252 Disclaimer 253 The findings and conclusions of this article are interpretations of the authors , and do 254 not necessarily represent the official position of the TCDC . 255 256 257 References 258 1 .
