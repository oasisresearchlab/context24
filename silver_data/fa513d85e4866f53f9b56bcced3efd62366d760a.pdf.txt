Filament entanglements lead to a frequency - independent elastic modulus over an extended frequency range of 0 : 01 – 30 rad = sec ; this is probed with one - particle microrheology . Longitudinal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments increase the elastic modulus between 0 . 1 and 30 rad = sec at length scales up to the ﬁlament persistence length ; this is probed by two - particle microrheology .

Ka Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) is a semiﬂexible polymer and an essential building block in the cytoskeletal net - works that determine cellular mechanics and function [ 1 , 2 ] . In vitro , globular actin ( G - actin ) polymerizes in the presence of K (cid:1) or Mg 2 (cid:1) to form polymers whose lengths are polydisperse and of order 10 to 20 (cid:1) m . These ﬁlaments have a persistence length of l p (cid:2) 15 (cid:1) m , 3 orders of magnitude larger than their diameter , d (cid:2) 7 nm [ 3 , 4 ] . Thus , solutions of entangled F - actin are ideal for the study of the dynamics of semiﬂexible poly - mer networks . The rheology of semiﬂexible polymer networks has important contributions from numerous different characteristic length scales and concomitant frequency scales , and is qualitatively different than that of ﬂexible - polymer networks [ 5 – 14 ] . The large persis - tence length leads to important dynamics of individual ﬁlaments that profoundly affect the viscoelasticity of the network . For example , semiﬂexible polymers become en - tangled at extremely low volume fractions to form net - works with a signiﬁcant elastic modulus and long viscous relaxation time in comparison to ﬂexible polymers at the same volume fractions . These networks are characterized by an average mesh size , (cid:7) (cid:3) 0 : 3 = (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) c A p , where c A is the actin concentration in mg = ml and (cid:7) is measured in (cid:1) m [ 15 ] . However , for semiﬂexible networks , individual ﬁla - ments are sterically hindered due to the presence of other ﬁlaments at the entanglement length , l e (cid:2) (cid:7) 4 = 5 l 1 = 5 p , rather than the mesh size , as is the case for ﬂexible polymers [ 6 , 16 ] . These steric entanglements should result in an elastic modulus that remains constant over an extended range of frequencies . The lower bound in frequency is set by the reptation time , (cid:11) r (cid:2) 10 4 sec , the time it takes a ﬁlament to diffusely relax laterally along its tube formed by neighboring ﬁlament entanglements . The upper bound is set by the entanglement time , (cid:11) e (cid:2) 0 : 1 sec , resulting from transverse ﬂuctuations at the largest possible length scale , l e . However , bulk rheological measurements of F - actin networks do not exhibit this extended plateau [ 8 , 13 ] , but instead G 0 (cid:6) ! (cid:7) increases monotonically with ! at frequencies above (cid:2) 0 : 1 rad = sec , and only asymptotically approaches a plateau at even lower frequencies . The ex - cess elasticity is believed to arise from longitudinal ﬂuc - tuations of the ﬁlaments which are coherent over their persistence lengths ; such relaxations are unique to semi - ﬂexible polymers [ 5 , 6 ] . Thus , the microscopic origins of the rheology canbe ascertained only by determining both the frequency and length scale dependencies . Microrheological techniques have the potential of probing the response at length scales that are important for actin networks [ 9 – 14 ] . Signiﬁcant discrepancies are observed between microrheological and bulk measure - ments of the viscoelasticity of actin networks [ 13 ] . However , to date , there have been no attempts to exploit microrheology to elucidate the microscopic origins of the rheology at different length scales and to resolve these discrepancies . In this Letter , we use one - particle ( 1P ) and two - particle ( 2P ) microrheology to probe the length scale dependence of the rheology and determine the contribu - tions of both the longitudinal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments and entanglements to the bulk viscoelasticity of F - actin networks between 0 : 01 – 30 rad = sec . We use 2P micro - rheology to probe the contributions of large length scale ﬂuctuations and 1P microrheology to isolate the contri - butions of ﬂuctuations at short length scales . We show that the elasticity approaches a frequency - independent plateau when the longitudinal ﬂuctuations have diffusively de - cayed at the length scale of our probe ; by contrast , this time scale is determined by diffusive decay over l p for bulk measurements . However , the magnitude of this pla - teau is independent of length scale , allowing both 1P and 2P microrheology to be used to probe the concentration dependent plateau elasticity of F - actin networks . G - actin solutions are prepared by dissolving lyophi - lized G - actin in deionized water and dialyzing against fresh G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , p H 8 : 0 ) at 4 (cid:8) C for 24 h . Solutions of G - actin are kept at 4 (cid:8) C and used within 7 days of preparation . Carboyxlate modiﬁed colloidal spheres ( Molecular Probes ) [ 14 ] are mixed with G - actin P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 10 OCTOBER 2003 V OLUME 91 , N UMBER 15 158302 - 1 0031 - 9007 = 03 = 91 ( 15 ) = 158302 ( 4 ) $ 20 . 00  2003 The American Physical Society 158302 - 1 to a volume fraction of (cid:2) 0 : 4 % . Actin polymerization is initiated by adding 1 = 10 of the ﬁnal sample volume of 10 (cid:9) F - buffer ( 20 mM Tris HCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl , 2 mM DTT , 2mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM ATP , p H 7 : 5 ) and mixing gently for 10 sec . The sample is loaded into a 5 mm (cid:9) 10 mm (cid:9) 1 mm glass sample chamber , sealed with high - vacuum grease and equilibrated for 1 h at about 25 (cid:8) C . We image approximately 100 spheres with an inverted micro - scope in bright ﬁeld ( 40 (cid:9) ; N : A : (cid:3) 0 : 85 , air ) and record their dynamics at 30 frames = sec using a CCD camera with a shutter speed of 0 . 5 msec [ 17 ] . Several thousand frames are captured , ensuring good statistical accuracy for time scales up to 100 times the frame rate . Particle centers are detected in each frame to an accuracy of 20 nm and the time evolution of the position of each particle is determined [ 18 ] . To avoid wall effects , we image 100 (cid:1) m into the sample . We calculate the one - dimensional ensemble averaged mean - squared displacement h (cid:27) x 2 (cid:6) (cid:11) (cid:7)i ( 1P MSD ) and scale the results by the particle radius , a , to reﬂect the size - dependent viscous drag . In a solution of 0 : 9 mg = ml F - actin , where (cid:7) (cid:3) 0 : 3 (cid:1) m , the scaled MSD of particles with a (cid:3) 0 : 42 (cid:1) m ( a = (cid:7) (cid:12) 1 : 5 ) exhibits very little time evolution , reaching a constant value for (cid:11) > 0 : 1 sec , as shown by the solid circles in Fig . 1 . The magnitude and frequency dependence of the MSD remain unchanged for smaller particles with a (cid:3) 0 : 32 (cid:1) m ( a = (cid:7) (cid:12) 1 ) , as shown by the solid triangles in Fig . 1 . By contrast , the scaled MSD of even smaller particles , with a (cid:3) 0 : 23 (cid:1) m ( a = (cid:7) (cid:12) 0 : 6 ) is dramatically different , evolving as (cid:11) (cid:2) 0 : 4 , as shown by the solid squares in Fig . 1 . By examining individual particle trajectories , we ﬁnd that all the 0 : 32 - (cid:1) m and 0 : 42 - (cid:1) m particles remain caged , whereas some of the 0 : 23 - (cid:1) m particles can permeate through the network [ 19 ] . Since the 1P MSD probes the local micro - environment at length scales of (cid:2) a , small changes in particle size have dramatic effects on the 1P MSDs . To examine dynamics at length scales much larger than a , we determine the correlated displacements of pairs of particles , i and j , separated by a distance , 10 (cid:1) m < R ij < 100 (cid:1) m . We average over time , t , and over all distinct pairs of particles ( i (cid:1) j ) to calculate the two - particle displacement correlation tensor , D (cid:24)(cid:25) (cid:6) r ; (cid:11) (cid:7) (cid:3) h (cid:27) r i(cid:24) (cid:6) t ; (cid:11) (cid:7) (cid:27) r i(cid:25) (cid:6) t ; (cid:11) (cid:7) (cid:27) (cid:13) r (cid:14) R ij (cid:6) t (cid:7)(cid:15)i i (cid:1) j ; t ; ( 1 ) where (cid:27) r i(cid:24) is the displacement of the i th particle in (cid:24) component of the direction . At length scales , r , where the material behaves as a bulk viscoelastic material , the correlated motion will decay as 1 = r [ 17 , 20 , 21 ] . From the R ij where we observe a 1 = r decay , we extrapolate the correlated motion to a , and deﬁne the two - particle mean - squared displacement , h (cid:27) r 2 (cid:6) (cid:11) (cid:7)i D (cid:3) 2 r = aD rr (cid:6) r ; (cid:11) (cid:7) ( 2P MSD ) . Physically , the 2P MSD reﬂects the one - particle motion expected from long - wavelength modes in the material ; thus , by examining correlations up to 100 (cid:1) m , we are able to use 0 : 5 - (cid:1) m particles to measure mechanical response in entangled F - actin at length scales up to an order of magnitude longer than individual ﬁla - ments . The scaling factor of 2 = a is obtained by assuming the surrounding medium is incompressible , thus having a Poisson ratio of (cid:28) (cid:3) 1 = 2 [ 20 ] . We can directly test this assumption by comparing the transverse , D (cid:29)(cid:29) and D (cid:30)(cid:30) , to the longitudinal , D rr , components of the two - particle correlation tensor from Eq . ( 1 ) , and calculating D (cid:29)(cid:29) D rr (cid:3) D (cid:30)(cid:30) D rr (cid:3) 3 (cid:14) 4 (cid:28) 4 (cid:6) 1 (cid:14) (cid:28) (cid:7) : ( 2 ) This ratio results from calculating the strain ﬁeld of a point stress in an elastic medium [ 17 , 20 , 21 ] . We ﬁnd that F - actin is incompressible for 0 : 03 < ! < 30 rad = sec and (cid:28) (cid:3) 1 = 2 as shown in Fig . 2 . The frequency dependence and magnitude of the 2P MSD of 0 : 42 - (cid:1) m spheres in 0 : 9 mg = ml actin is qualita - tively different than the 1P MSD . At (cid:11) (cid:3) 0 : 1 sec , the 2P MSD is an order of magnitude smaller than the 1P MSD ; moreover , it scales as (cid:11) 0 : 5 whereas the 1P MSD is essen - tially constant in time , as shown in Fig . 2 . However , at FIG . 1 ( color online ) . Comparison of 1P ( symbols ) and 2P ( open symbols with lines ) MSDs in 0 : 9 mg = ml F - actin ( (cid:7) (cid:3) 0 : 3 (cid:1) m ) .

Similar behavior is observed with the 0 : 32 - (cid:1) m spheres . Remarkably , the 2P MSD of the 0 : 23 - (cid:1) m par - ticles also overlays well with the 2P MSDs obtained with the larger probes . Although the 0 : 23 - (cid:1) m spheres can permeate through the network , these motions are not correlated at long distances ; the two - particle analysis reﬂects only that portion of the tracer motion due to advection by strain ﬂuctuations of the network . We measure the 2P MSD of 0 : 42 - (cid:1) m particles in a 1 mg = ml F - actin solution and use the generalized Stokes - Einstein relation [ 22 ] to obtain a good approximation of the frequency - dependent bulk elastic modulus , G 0 (cid:6) ! (cid:7) , and viscous modulus , G ” (cid:6) ! (cid:7) as shown by the closed and open circles , respectively , in Fig . 3 ( a ) . These are in excellent accord with the bulk values , shown by the closed and open triangles , obtained using a home - built stress - controlled rheometer with a parallel plate geometry [ 8 , 13 ] ; bulk properties are also correctly measured with the 2P MSDs of the 0 . 32 and 0 : 23 - (cid:1) m particles . In 1 mg = ml F - actin , between 0 . 1 and 30 rad = sec , 2P micro - rheology measures a viscoelastic response with the elastic and loss moduli similar in magnitude , and proportional to 0 . 5 as shown by the solid line in Fig . 3 ( a ) . At the lowest frequencies , below 0 : 1 rad = sec , the elastic modulus be - gins to dominate and we infer a plateau modulus , G o (cid:12) 0 : 2 Pa . Similarly , we ﬁnd the 2P MSD of 0 : 5 - (cid:1) m par - ticles yields results in good accord with bulk measure - ments of the frequency - dependent viscoelasticity for a 0 : 3 mg = ml F - actin solution , as shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) , and we infer G o (cid:12) 0 : 01 Pa . While the magnitudes and fre - quency dependence of 2P moduli are robust , crossover frequencies cannot be precisely determined as they are very sensitive to variations in the smoothing of the 2P MSD required to determine the viscoelastic moduli [ 22 ] . Thus , examining the pairwise correlated motion of micron - sized particles separated between 10 and 100 (cid:1) m successfully probes the properties observed at macro - scopic length scales with traditional rheology . To elucidate the microscopic origins of this viscoelas - ticity , we use the 1P MSD , interpreted with the general - ized Stokes - Einstein relation , to examine length scale dependence of the viscoelastic response . For 1 mg = ml F - actin , the 1P microrheology using 0 : 42 - (cid:1) m particles ( a = (cid:7) (cid:12) 1 : 5 ) exhibits a well - deﬁned plateau over the ex - tended frequency range of 0 . 03 to 30 rad = sec , as shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) by the solid and open squares . By contrast , the dynamics of 0 : 5 - (cid:1) m particles in 0 : 3 mg = ml F - actin yield 1P microrheology results that signiﬁcantly underestimate the bulk viscoelasticity , by nearly an order of magnitude over the entire frequency range , as shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) . In this case , a = (cid:7) (cid:12) 0 : 6 , and particle motion is again domi - nated by permeation through the network ; any similarity in the frequency dependence between the microrheology and the bulk measurements is a pure coincidence [ 19 ] . We ﬁnd that when a = (cid:7) (cid:16) 1 , 1P microrheology measures a frequency - independent elastic modulus between 0 . 01 and 30 rad = sec consistent with the plateau modulus observed in a 2P or bulk measurement of entangled actin at fre - quencies below 0 : 1 rad = sec . The observed independence of the 1P viscoelasticity in both frequency and particle size , and its convergence with the two - particle results at the lowest frequency strongly suggest that the discrepancies between 1P and 2P micro - rheology for particle sizes a (cid:16) (cid:7) arise from the nature of the coupling between the particles and the excitations responsible for the elasticity of the network [ 23 ] . At intermediate frequencies , between 0 . 1 and 30 rad = sec , longitudinal density ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments signiﬁ - cantly contribute to the bulk rheological response ; these relax by diffusing along the ﬁlament [ 5 , 6 ] . Thus , the lowest frequency of these excitations that affects both 2P microrheology and bulk rheology is determined by the time taken for the density ﬂuctuation to diffuse a persis - tence length , (cid:11) l (cid:2) (cid:11) e (cid:6) l p = l e (cid:7) (cid:2) 10 sec , where (cid:11) e (cid:2) l 4 e = l p k B T (cid:2) 0 : 1 sec and where is the effective friction coefﬁcient of the ﬁlament in solution , k B is Boltzmann’s constant , and T is the temperature . However , 1P motion will sense only ﬂuctuations on length scales of a , and these relax much more quickly , on time scales of (cid:11) 0 l (cid:2) (cid:11) e (cid:6) a = (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) l e l p p (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) 0 : 1 sec ; thus 1P microrheology will not probe elasticity due to the longitudinal ﬂuctuations for ! < ! l (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:11) 0 l (cid:7) (cid:14) 1 [ 23 ] . By contrast , because of its larger effective length scale , 2P microrheology samples these excitations in the same fashion as bulk measurements , and thus yields the bulk response in the frequency regime FIG . 3 ( color online ) .

Interestingly , 1P microrheology begins to exhibit additional relaxations at frequencies compa - rable to (cid:11) (cid:14) 1 l , where longitudinal excitations on the scale of a begin to contribute . The other signiﬁcant contribution to the bulk viscoe - lasticity below 30 rad = sec is the elasticity due to entan - glements of the ﬁlaments that occur at a scale l e (cid:2) 0 : 65 (cid:1) m for a 1 mg = ml F - actin network . It is these collisions that determine the plateau elasticity G o (cid:2) $ k B T = l e where $ is the density of ﬁlaments . By recog - nizing that $ (cid:2) c A and recalling that c A (cid:2) 1 = (cid:7) 2 , we obtain G o (cid:2) c 7 = 5 A = l 1 = 5 p . Because this plateau modulus arises from a length scale , l e (cid:2) a , it is exactly this fre - quency - independent plateau modulus that 1P microrheol - ogy measures at all frequencies in our experiment . Thus , 1P microrheology exhibits the same concentration depen - dence of G o as does 2P microrheology ; we ﬁnd G o (cid:2) c xA , where x (cid:3) 1 : 8 (cid:17) 0 : 4 , as shown in Fig . 4 . This is in good agreement with the behavior seen experimentally [ 8 , 12 ] and with theoretical predictions [ 8 , 24 ] . The error bars plotted for the moduli measured with 2P microrheology reﬂect the statistical uncertainty of G o for each measure - ment ; this is substantially more than the statistical un - certainty in the 1P measurements , but is comparable to the sample - to - sample variation . The agreement between the plateau modulus obtained from 1P and 2P micro - rheology as a function of c A at long times clearly suggests that local heterogeneities , such as those due to deple - tion or preferential binding to the bead , have little or no inﬂuence on the microrheology measurements . Thus , both 1P and 2P microrheology measure the low frequency plateau of the elastic modulus due to ﬁlament entanglements . A single multiparticle tracking experiment requiring only 30 (cid:1) l of sample volume and thermal energy provides a wealth of information . The addition of crosslinking proteins will disrupt the longitudinal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments , reducing their importance . This augurs well for the application of 1P microrheology to in vitro net - works that more closely mimic the cytoskeleton through the addition of crosslinking proteins . Moreover , it also suggests that 1P microrheology may also be adequate for in vivo measurements of cells . We thank Tony Maggs and Fred MacKintosh for valu - able discussions and A . Popp and B .
