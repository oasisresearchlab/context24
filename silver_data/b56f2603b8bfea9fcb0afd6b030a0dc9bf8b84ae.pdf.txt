Today’s local entrepreneurs must navigate an increasing array of technologi - cal tools to achieve their business goals ( e . g . , creating a polished website , syncing files with an assistant , scanning receipts to track expenses ) [ 9 , 32 , 40 , 49 ] . Ever - evolving technology requirements create particularly strong barriers for entrepreneurs in minoritized and resource - constrained communities [ 65 ] due to historical in - equalities in financial , social , and more recently digital resources ( i . e . , the “digital divide” [ 63 ] ) . The COVID - 19 pandemic acceler - ated technology expectations for local business owners [ 19 , 57 ] , magnifying the effects of existing technology barriers [ 12 ] . While decades of research and design efforts aimed to make the technology used by entrepreneurs less expensive and easier to use ( e . g . , WSYWIG website builders , social media , and desktop print - ing ) , technology barriers remain persistent for people in resource - constrained or “lean economies” 1 [ 9 , 40 , 62 ] . Recent work has ex - plored technology support for workers from lean economies such as digital literacy classes for returning citizens seeking jobs [ 62 ] , and social supports including workshops and meetings for en - trepreneurs creating tours [ 40 ] . Such programs provided support for people with similar businesses or technical experience , but 1 For the remainder of the paper , we use “lean economies” as the preferred term which highlights the resiliency and innovation of residents located in communities with few resources as done in prior work [ 27 ] . CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . they may be less useful for entrepreneurs who have heterogeneous businesses , backgrounds and technology goals . To understand and address the computing challenges faced by local entrepreneurs in a lean economy , we followed a Participa - tory Action Research [ 11 ] approach to design and run “Tech Help Desk” , an on - going service 2 that provides technology help to local entrepreneurs . Tech Help Desk was co - designed with community stakeholders from Community Forge : a local entrepreneurial hub that provides resources for local entrepreneurs in a small Midwest city in the U . S . , Wilkinsburg , P . A . , including co - working space , accelerator programs , and community events . Tech Help Desk’s strategic and responsive approach to technological support in the workplace uniquely provides need - driven technology support for immediate entrepreneur requests ( e . g . , uploading PDFs for business registration , or connecting to a printer or scanner for taxes ) . By extension , Tech Help Desk addresses a critical gap in the existing ecology – an ever - evolving collection of resources [ 76 ] – of local en - trepreneurial support . During the design , deployment and study of Tech Help Desk , we asked the following research questions : ( RQ1 ) What are the technology challenges faced by local entrepreneurs ? , ( RQ2 ) What are the existing resources and workarounds that lo - cal entrepreneurs use to overcome their technology challenges ? , and ( RQ3 ) What are features of technology support that may be more effective than common workplace approaches for technology support ? Our engagements with 19 local entrepreneurs and support staff revealed how local entrepreneurs were resourcefully and discern - ingly addressing their computing challenges by curating an ecology of support : building networks of trustworthy friends and mentors , seeking out business coaches , enrolling in business accelerators and courses . Still , the deployment of Tech Help Desk revealed 61 unique computing challenges that entrepreneurs were not yet able to address , due to a mismatch between support – or lack thereof – and entrepreneurs’ technology challenges . We refer to this collection of 61 challenges addressed with Tech Help Desk as the long tail of com - puting challenges , given the large number of distinct challenges that were surfaced and solved . For instance , a single local entrepreneur used Tech Help Desk services to address a range of technology challenges including : freeing storage space , editing a PDF docu - ment , posting to a listserv , navigating local files , learning keyboard shortcuts , removing malware , setting up cloud services , accessing necessary hardware , automating social media posts , and updating products on a website . In total , we worked with entrepreneurs to address 61 unique computing challenges across 35 distinct com - puting tools ( e . g . , website builders such as Wix , Squarespace , or WordPress , financial software such as QuickBooks , cloud services such as Google Drive , social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram , payment tools such as Venmo , content editing tools such as Canva and Adobe , and so on ) . Tech Help Desk’s strategic and responsive approach was critical to match the local entrepreneurs’ resourceful and discerning approaches to growing their business in a digitized landscape . This paper makes the following three practical and conceptual contributions . First , drawing on our participatory approach , we 2 Tech Help Desk is an on - going project , but this paper reports on two and a half years of progress . present a model of technical support that addresses key design tradeoffs for entrepreneurial support and , as a result , is strategic in how it is attuned to local entrepreneurial contexts , and responsive in how it dynamically prioritizes emergent needs ( See Table 1 ) . Our work demonstrated that strategic and responsive support in the form of flexible and personalized one - on - one sessions was critical to matching entrepreneurs’ discernment ( e . g . , balancing learning goals with the demands of running a small business ) , where we recognized the wealth of resourcefulness they already possessed . Second , we offer a detailed case of this model through Tech Help Desk , illustrating how this strategic and responsive form of sup - port can help address the many day - to - day computing challenges entrepreneurs need to overcome ( i . e . , the long tail of computing challenges ) . Third , towards practicality , this paper also contributes a deep investigation of other entrepreneurial support approaches and programs within the region and how our strategic and re - sponsive model of technical support , instantiated in Tech Help Desk , fits alongside . Together , we present a detailed illustration of how resourceful and discerning entrepreneurs often stitched together multiple programs , social networks , and other resources to address their technical needs ( i . e . , their ecology of support ) . This will inform researchers’ and community partners’ understanding of entrepreneurial computing challenges and , by extension , will help to design services and tools to enable local entrepreneurs to thrive in their local economy and beyond . 2 RELATED WORK Our work in technology support for local entrepreneurs draws on three main areas of research : resources for entrepreneurship , computing pedagogy ( e . g . , one - on - one instruction ) , technology support in the workplace . 2 . 1 Resources for Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship research suggests that a business is more likely to be successful if the entrepreneur possesses individual skills and characteristics relevant to starting their business ( i . e . “human capi - tal” ) [ 53 ] , and social support for networking , information gathering and emotional needs ( i . e . “social capital” ) [ 18 , 52 ] . Human capital for entrepreneurship includes a broad range of knowledge [ 47 ] gained through work experience , education , and entrepreneurial experience [ 53 ] as well as personal and psychological factors such as self - efficacy , social skills , health and motivation [ 27 ] . Social capi - tal relevant to entrepreneurship includes personal networks and formal or informal groups to which the entrepreneur has access ( e . g . , government , bank , or community - driven organizations , and inter - community or extra - community ties [ 20 ] ) . For people in lean economies , access to both social and human capital ( as well as fi - nancial capital ) can be limited [ 9 , 20 ] . In such communities , many turn to entrepreneurship out of necessity to make a living , i . e . “necessity - driven entrepreneurship” [ 41 ] rather than “opportunity - driven entrepreneurship” [ 75 ] — the notable difference between be - ing whether people can opt in or opt out to entrepreneurship . Access to general resources for entrepreneurs remains a challenge for “low - wealth” entrepreneurs [ 20 ] . To better support entrepreneurs pursu - ing necessity - driven entrepreneurship , there exist calls for flexible funding opportunities [ 56 ] , entrepreneurship education [ 58 , 61 ] , Tech Help Desk CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Model of Strategic and Responsive Support Tech Help Desk Design Tradeoff Choice Instantiation Should we provide responsive or standardized support ?

In our implementation of this model , our participatory approach informed the design choices ( Choice ) and how Tech Help Desk embodied these choices ( Instantiation ) within Com - munity Forge . and incubator opportunities to facilitate social capital growth [ 42 ] . In this paper , we explore how to build human capital to overcome barriers to entrepreneurship – specifically technological barriers – within an environment dedicated to entrepreneurs’ social capital growth . 2 . 2 Entrepreneurial Skill Building for Using Technology Research suggests that digital literacy is a form of human capital that is unequally distributed [ 65 ] . Digital literacy — or , “the ability to use information and communication technologies to find , evaluate , create , and communicate information” [ 8 ] — requires not only low - level skills for operating a specific technology ( i . e . “operational” , or “medium - related” skills [ 6 , 71 ] ) , but also higher - level skills that re - late to the selection and strategic application of technology to reach a goal ( i . e . “content - related” skills [ 71 ] ) . Prior work aimed to under - stand the types of technology challenges faced by entrepreneurs in lean economies using technology for business goals [ 27 , 40 , 41 , 62 – 64 ] . Inparticular , scholarsengagedinparticipatoryactionresearch [ 11 , 38 ] explored non - technical approaches to facilitating digital engage - ment which rely heavily on structures of social support such as peer learning [ 62 , 63 ] . Peer support approaches are particularly benefi - cial as , by definition , peers have shared experiences which can to provide more contextually - relevant information [ 37 ] . Ogbonnaya - Ogburu et al . established a digital literacy class for returning citizens seeking jobs [ 62 ] , and Pei and Crooks established a class for intro - ducing tablets into an English as a Second Language ( ESL ) class [ 63 ] . In the context of entrepreneurship , Hui et al . introduced social sup - ports ( e . g . , in person meetings , paper prototyping , tour practice ) for entrepreneurs developing tour businesses [ 40 ] . To showcase pride in one’s local community , Dillahunt et al . facilitated oppor - tunities for entrepreneurs to grow local tour businesses ( e . g . , by setting the platforms and technical requirements for the tours ) [ 27 ] . This work uncovers highly - detailed accounts of the technical barri - ers specific to certain domains such as tour businesses . However , classes and group activities may work better when business goals are homogeneous rather than diverse as these standardized formats of assistance leave less room for customization [ 43 ] . To address and adapt to the needs of entrepreneurs who run heterogeneous busi - nesses at differing levels of maturity , we design a model for strategic and responsive technical support for resourceful and discerning entrepreneurs . 2 . 3 Technology Support in the Workplace While support structures for local entrepreneurs is an emergent field of study , a range of approaches have been explored to assist employees in overcoming their technical woes including both for - mal ( help desks , IT consultants ) and informal methods ( over the shoulder learning or water cooler troubleshooting among peers ) . For instance , Novick et al . conducted interviews and participant observation among knowledge workers to understand how em - ployees resolve their technical issues [ 60 ] . They found half of the time people asked colleagues and the other half of the time people went to their organization’s in - house help desk . These help desks provided full - time employees who were dedicated to resolving their organization’s technical woes . Yet formal help desk providers were pressured to maintain an unwavering sense of technical expertise ( e . g . , to inspire confidence with prepared answers [ 33 ] , and achieve performance goals [ 15 ] ) . Moreover , organizational help desks often focus on repeat problems , and may not fit entrepreneurs’ diverse technology needs . Moreover , as a result of organizational incentives and pressures , help desks may foster reliance on the service rather than resilience to future computing challenges ( a critical skill when resources are ever - changing ) . Several scholars have investigated the benefits and drawbacks of peer learning when addressing computing challenges in the work - place such as among teachers [ 72 ] and knowledge workers [ 70 ] . For example , Twidale focused specifically on informal learning – water cooler exchanges [ 73 ] – among knowledge workers resolving tech - nical issues and found that peers provided a helpful organizational context when addressing their colleague’s technical issues [ 70 ] . When offering technical support in these informal exchanges , em - ployees providing assistance assumed one of two roles : a “guru” , where their deep technical understanding led them to the solve their colleagues’ challenges quickly [ 31 ] , or , a “gardener” or “translator” role where their approach was more collaborative [ 51 ] . While un - derstanding role playing behaviors among knowledge workers pro - vides critical insight into informal technical assistance within for - mal workplaces , our setting of a co - working space for entrepreneurs has important differences which may affect informal technical sup - port . For instance , entrepreneurs do not work for a shared organi - zation , and they therefore often do not have colleagues , standard CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . expected working times , nor a shared organizational goal . Given this isolation , it may be challenging for entrepreneurs to form a network of peers from which to seek technical assistance . If an entrepreneur does have access to a network of peers , entrepreneurs must weigh the benefits of receiving help alongside reputational concerns , as asking for help from peers can result in being perceived as less knowledgeable [ 46 ] . In this paper , we explore an approach to providing entrepreneurs with technical assistance that does not rely on peers by default . 2 . 4 One - to - One Instruction and Technology Support Beyond the workplace , one - to - one instruction is one of the most ef - fective approaches to education [ 16 ] . In formal educational settings , learning is curriculum - driven such that all learners first receive the class curriculum that covers necessary knowledge , then learners are provided increasingly targeted support for learning that curricu - lum through group or one - to - one instruction [ 10 , 24 , 28 , 39 ] . Unlike reading and math , technology skills ( e . g . , typing , spreadsheets , doc - ument processing ) are not part of standard U . S . curriculum , so students are unlikely to receive one - to - one support . Instead , people often learn technology for their personal goals in - situ while working on a task , rather than through any set cur - riculum . To support learning expert software or how to code , prior work has explored ways to remotely connect people to experts or peers with relevant technical knowledge [ 7 , 22 , 23 , 44 ] . Joshi et al . connect users of specialized help with another person who uses the software for three minute one - to - one help sessions [ 44 ] , and Codementor matches students to long term mentors for feed - back on writing code [ 7 ] . The side - by - side approach of a person screen - sharing while another person serves as a side - kick ( rather than the expert fixing the problem directly ) , can benefit learning and the work itself [ 13 , 34 ] . Alternatively , tool - specific support forums ( e . g . , Photoshop Guru , reddit . com / r / photoshop , Adobe Sup - port Community ) offer Q & A - based asynchronous peer support . As formulating a query [ 29 ] or supplying relevant information [ 67 ] is challenging without domain knowledge , some tools propose to help surface general - purpose answers to Q & A in - context of tool use [ 23 , 55 ] . These tools provide powerful guidance for technology use , yet require downloading a browser extension [ 23 ] or setting up additional software [ 55 ] . In lean economies where access to technol - ogy and technology literacy may be limited , recent work highlights the importance to consider non - technological solutions to facili - tate technology use ( rather than addressing technology challenges with more technology ) [ 40 ] . For instance , library staff members can provide in - person one - to - one support for people performing tasks on library computers including seeking jobs or accessing govern - ment services [ 14 , 68 ] . In addition , recent work in human - computer interaction research by Hui et al . provided in - person ( “low - tech” ) technology support for entrepreneurs creating tour businesses [ 40 ] . Overall , the broad and goal - oriented technical needs of local entrepreneurs ( e . g . , “launch a website myself” , “keep track of my customers” ) fall outside of the scope of the purpose , expertise , and time that existing structured services provide — either due to their focus on a specific technology tool or specific goals . In this pa - per , we explore : the long tail of technology challenges that are not yet addressed by technology - based or social supports , and ( 2 ) how to tailor one - on - one support to meet the business needs of entrepreneurs in lean economies . 3 METHODS Informed by the needs of a local hub for entrepreneurship , we hosted a two and a half year long ( and on - going ) service providing broad one - on - one help for local entrepreneurs , called “Tech Help Desk” . The findings we report are based on the design of and ob - servations during Tech Help Desk sessions along with interviews with local entrepreneurs and others who provided services for local entrepreneurs . 3 . 1 Location and Site We conducted our research within a co - working space and commu - nity hub for local entrepreneurs based in Wilkinsburg , P . A . called Community Forge ( See Figure 1 ) . Wilkinsburg , P . A . Wilkinsburg , P . A . is a borough of Allegheny County , P . A . The population of Wilkinsburg , P . A . is roughly 68 % Black and 35 % of people are living at or below the poverty line [ 5 ] . Wilkinsburg , P . A . immediately borders but is not part of Pittsburgh , P . A . , and it is one of the many unincorporated municipalities that acutely struggle with resource deprivation and long - term disinvest - ment [ 1 ] . In 2021 , Pittsburgh , P . A . was considered to be one of the U . S . ’s “Apartheid Cities” [ 4 ] , as the structures of power within the city continue to perpetuate systemic racial inequality and injus - tice [ 54 ] , magnified by the post - industrial blight the region experi - ences . Community Forge Community Forge is a former elementary school re - purposed into a space that hosts mixed programming geared towards developing a more equitable economy for Wilkins - burg , P . A . and the Greater Pittsburgh , P . A . region ( Figure 1 ) . To - wards this goal , Community Forge provides financial resources , jobs , job training , business development , youth empowerment programs ( e . g . , courses , summer camps , hands - on - learning ) , and community outreach events ( e . g . , food and supply giveaways , music and movie nights , hosts a voting location ) . Community Forge’s business de - velopment resources include : coaching and professional service referrals , technical assistance , networking opportunities , financial support , and affordable office rentals ( re - purposed classrooms with co - working and individual office space , Figure 1B ) . Community Forge works with roughly 50 local businesses each year through a variety of programs where 95 % of the businesses are Black - owned , approximately 90 % of entrepreneurs do not have a college degree , and 80 % are first - time entrepreneurs . To spread information about resources available within the space , Community Forge relies on word - of - mouth and social media , as well as working with existing organizations in Wilkinsburg , P . A . and Pittsburgh , P . A . which sup - port entrepreneurs . Community Forge also hosts quarterly tenant mixers , where the entrepreneurs renting space at Community Forge can mingle , enjoy free food , share updates and hear any announce - ments with the space . Tech Help Desk CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Figure 1 : Photos depicting ( A ) the front entrance to Commu - nity Forge , ( B ) one of the classrooms in Community Forge , and ( C ) the Tech Help Desk room . Business Bloom Program at Community Forge Community Forge provides an intensive , year - long incubator program for en - trepreneurs called the Business Bloom Program that provides finan - cial resources , professional services , and strategic consulting to small business owners . The Business Bloom Program also connects entrepreneurs to its network of accountants , attorneys , business coaches , technical support ( Tech Help Desk ) , graphic designers , and – during COVID - 19 – public health consultants . The stated goal of the Business Bloom Program is to assist small businesses in keep - ing up with the demands of an ever changing COVID - 19 busi - ness landscape while serving and fostering the growth of minority - owned enterprises . 3 . 2 Co - Designing Tech Help Desk Initial collaboration between Community Forge and the researchers’ university began when one member of the research team reached out to leaders at Community Forge to introduce himself and to gauge and establish interest in collaborating for a grant proposal 3 . In these initial discussions , community stakeholders emphasized that it was important that our presence within Community Forge brought immediate value for the community members . The direc - tors were clear that starting with any form of data collection imme - diately upon entering the space would not be permitted , as such an action would extracting value from the space without providing anything in return . This concern echoes previous calls to prioritize rapport building [ 48 ] and to deliver immediate value to stakehold - ers by prioritizing their needs rather than optimizing for a research agenda when conducting community - based research [ 35 , 69 ] . Com - munity Forge leaders also emphasized the tenuous historical rela - tionship between the researchers’ institution and the surrounding community that Community Forge served . For instance , the re - searchers’ institution had a history of being complicit to the racial injustice in the surrounding area , such issues ranging from public 3 The grant proposal focused on leveraging existing community structures to facil - itate job mobility within underserved communities ( urban and rural ) by training unemployed individuals to become online workers . relations [ 2 ] to police brutality [ 3 ] . Therefore the resulting lack of institutional trust needed to be taken into account when consider - ing next steps . In June of 2019 , we began our discussions with Community Forge members for how the researchers could address challenges the en - trepreneurs in Community Forge were experiencing . Community Forge leaders and researchers suggested a few ideas for how the re - search team could structure their involvement with the space . One idea was to offer a series of courses on technical skills , but given the diversity of entrepreneur businesses within Community Forge , it was not yet clear what technical skills a curriculum should cover . A second idea ( similar to the original grant proposal ) was to provide a class on how to find jobs within online labor markets such as Fiverr or Freelancer to facilitate job mobility , but few entrepreneurs in the space were interested in pursuing online freelance work alongside running their small business . Another idea was to provide a tool to facilitate peer mentorship among entrepreneurs at Community Forge , but the director of the peer mentorship program did not consider it appropriate to conduct a research study on peer mentor - ship as they were just establishing peer cohorts within Community Forge . As conversations deepened , the Community Forge executive director shared their experience working on day - to - day computing challenges entrepreneurs would come to them with . As the direc - tor had a tight schedule , such requests for one - on - one technical assistance were leaving them exasperated . These reflections , cou - pled with recommendations from leaders of other entrepreneurial non - profits ( e . g . , a director for a leading technology non - profit in the U . S . ) , led to a consistent starting point : to offer “office hours” in which research team members could answer any technical ques - tions while physically present at Community Forge . Regular office hours would allow the research team to provide immediate value for Community Forge and enable relationship building . Commu - nity Forge leaders and the researchers agreed that repetition and consistency would be important to build a reliable presence within the space . After three months of discussions and iteration , in Sep - tember 2019 , we opened weekly “office hours” for entrepreneurs in the space , called Tech Help Desk . When determining how to advertise Tech Help Desk , we consid - ered how to communicate the types of technical services we would offer . This was a non - trivial task not only because of the need to keep the call as broad as possible , but also because those who the call was targeting did not necessarily know the technical jargon used to articulate and indentify technical issues [ 45 , 74 ] . Therefore , we did not list a fixed set of technical tasks our providers would offer , but instead left this call open and welcomed all technical challenges . However , during the study , this open - ended call caused confusion as entrepreneurs did not know what type of services Tech Help Desk provided . In the end , we created a flyer describing all the services providers had offered ( See Supplemental Materials ) . 3 . 2 . 1 Timing and location within the building . To determine time and location of Tech Help Desk , we discussed with Community Forge’s Operations Manager , who was a constant presence in the facility and had the most in - depth understanding of who was at Community Forge and at what time ( including co - occurring pro - grams ) . As entrepreneurs were most likely to be in the space mid - week and midday , we selected Wednesdays 12 : 00PM - 3 : 00PM for CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . the winter months and 1 : 00PM - 4 : 00PM for the summer to account for the change in daylight . For the physical location of Tech Help Desk , we initially set up in the atrium , a central area where all tenants pass through when entering or leaving the building . We also tried renting a desk in a co - working room ( but it was difficult to share sound space with entrepreneurs who sought quite time at their desks ) and a renting a full room ( which provided privacy for support sessions ) . In the end , we returned to the atrium as it afforded the best discoverability of the service . 3 . 3 Tech Help Desk Structure and Activity Entrepreneurs discovered Tech Help Desk through flyers we posted with the monthly schedule throughout the building ( See Supplemen - tal Materials ) , word - of - mouth from prior participants , Community Forge staff , Community Forge newsletters sent monthly , as well as through physical encounters within the space ( i . e . , walking by the desk ) . The Tech Help Desk providers traversed the space to introduce themselves to other members and inquire if they had any technical issues . Once initial contact was established , the provider worked with the entrepreneur to determine if an in - person or vir - tual session would best fit their needs , and if they preferred to schedule an appointment or walk - in ( when COVID - 19 restrictions were in place and all appointments were remote ) . For the session , we asked entrepreneurs to bring a device and charger they could easily access these . If they did not have access to a WiFi or data - enabled device , the computer lab within Community Forge provided devices . Entrepreneurs were given the option to opt into the research study , and it was made clear that participa - tion in the research study was not required to receive technical assistance . To help mitigate any pressure entrepreneurs felt to opt in to the study , it was mentioned as a secondary point and de - proritized alongside the other intake information provided to the entrepreneur . In addition , we also encouraged any questions and provided transparency into the research questions and research goals . Tech Help Desk sessions were not recorded , but instead the provider took field notes during and after the session . While note taking , the participant could view the provider’s screen ( when the session was in - person ) and see the notes and ask questions . After the session , the provider asked if the entrepreneur would like to schedule a follow - up meeting . The provider then sent a follow - up email describing the tasks accomplished in the completed session , “to do” items the entrepreneur should attempt to accomplish be - tween sessions , and goals for the next session . 3 . 3 . 1 Responding to COVID - 19 . In response to the COVID - 19 pan - demic , we transitioned Tech Help Desk to remote assistance via Zoom or phone starting in March 2020 . All participants of Tech Help Desk had Zoom installed on their devices and were comfortable with using Zoom , but two participants preferred a phone call for an initial consultation . In Zoom sessions , participants shared their screen via Zoom , but they were not able to see the provider’s screen . We expanded the hours participants could request a help session to Monday - Friday 9 : 00a - 6 : 00p , acknowledging the heightened stress and demand on entrepreneurs to have a strong digital presence for their small business as a result of the pandemic . When Community Forge reopened in July 2021 , the research team returned to offering in - person Tech Help Desk sessions , but continued to offer remote Tech Help Desk sessions for those who preferred to meet online . 3 . 3 . 2 Leading up to and Following the Tech Help Desk session . A pre - session survey asked participants to provide details about their tech - nical questions , their business , their demographics , and whether their business was their main source of income . A post - session survey asked participants to describe the solution implemented with the provider , as well as to provide positive and constructive feedback on the session with the “I like . . . ” and “I wish . . . ” format [ 36 ] . 3 . 4 Interviews with Entrepreneurs and Supporters To gain a rich , qualitative understanding of how local entrepreneurs overcome everyday technology challenges , we conducted semi - structured interviews with Community Forge entrepreneurs as well as people who have supported Community Forge entrepreneurs ( e . g . , program directors , business coaches ) . We conducted our in - terviews between February 2020 and summer of 2021 . We began our outreach for interviews in February of 2020 , but the COVID - 19 pandemic removed all possibility of interviewing entrepreneurial support personnel . We resumed and completed interviews in the summer of 2021 . 3 . 4 . 1 Participants . We recruitedentrepreneurparticipants byemail - ing entrepreneurs who had used Tech Help Desk or participated in the Business Bloom Program . We also recruited Community Forge leaders and people who served in support roles for the Busi - ness Bloom Program program ( e . g . , business coaches , lawyers , ac - countants , web developers ) , as well as people who led or served in support roles at other incubator and accelerator programs for local entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh , P . A . In total , we recruited 9 en - trepreneurs , and 10 support people ( 7 support people also owned their own small business ) ( See Table 2 ) . 3 . 4 . 2 Semi - Structured Interviews . Our semi - structured interviews with supporters and entrepreneurs took one hour , and participants were compensated $ 20 . We asked entrepreneurs background ques - tions about their business , the types of technology they used as part of their business ( e . g . , websites , software , hardware , cloud services , and social media ) , and types of external help they used . We then asked about what types of technical challenges they encountered as a business owners and how they overcame them . We concluded with asking about what resources they would like in the future for solving technology problems . During interviews with people in supporting roles for entrepreneurs , we asked about their organi - zation and the types of entrepreneurial support it provided ( e . g . , educational , financial , or technology resources ) . We then asked about their experience with entrepreneur technology challenges and solutions , and about any resources for learning technology they felt were missing . Please see the Supplemental Materials for both interview protocols . 3 . 5 Data Analysis For the semi - structured interviews , the research team conducted audio and video recording and took detailed field notes . All audio recordings were transcribed ( with Descript . com ) and reviewed for errors by hand . The research team analyzed these data through Tech Help Desk CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA a process of open coding to identify initial themes across the in - terviews and the Tech Help Desk field notes . We later engaged in affinity diagramming [ 21 ] over the course of two weeks , where the three out of six authors reviewed each transcript , marked sec - tions that informed and extended this paper’s motivations , and printed out the corresponding raw data . Clusters formed around key themes : barriers to using computing tools for entrepreneurs ( and whether these barriers were “content” , “operational” , or “ac - cess” challenges [ 71 ] ) , resourceful workarounds entrepreneurs de - duced to overcome barriers , systems of support and entrepreneurs used to facilitate the use of computing tools in their business . All authors repeatedly met during this period to review key findings and iteratively refine a set of analytic memos which expanded on themes emergent across our data [ 21 ] . We followed participant quote editing conventions consistent with applied social science re - search practices [ 25 ] . Specifically , we removed filler words and false starts , in some cases re - punctuated and used ellipses to indicate substantial omissions . 3 . 6 Positionality We disclose the identities and positionality of the researchers and authors of this paper , as a concern for reflexive design research practice [ 50 , 66 ] . Tech Help Desk sessions were led by a research team comprising three white women , one from the Southwest U . S . , one from the Southeast U . S . , and one is a U . S . immigrant from Western Canada ; two white men from the rural Midwest of the U . S . and an impoverished , post - industrial part of Eastern U . S . ; and one Black man from Eastern U . S whose work focuses on business development , who is dedicated to providing economic opportuni - ties for minority entrepreneurs , and who has experienced racism firsthand during his time in “Corporate America” . The research team comprises three researchers who are upper management at the field site , three researchers in a technical department at a pri - vate U . S . university ( a graduate student and two faculty members , one tenured and one un - tenured ) , one un - tenured faculty member in a technical department at a public U . S . university , and one indi - vidual who ceased their pursuit of a technical career in academia in order to center their community - based efforts to fight the tangible inequities caused by racism , poverty , and devaluing of human life in the U . S . The five middle - aged , white researchers do not have certain lived experiences that are relevant to this study such as the impact of forms of violence due to racism , ageism , or xenophobia ( especially in the context of technology education ) . Three researchers do not have lived experience of poverty or other aspects of background that employers ( or those funding business grants ) discriminate against . All five white researchers experience privileges from whiteness , access to formal technical education ( e . g . , engineering and computer science degrees ) and grew up with access to computing devices . Given the predominantly white research team , we took mea - sures to mitigate power imbalances and to cultivate a more equi - table relationship between the research team and Community Forge members ( as well as within the research team ) . For instance , all members of the research team were firmly committed to the Com - munity Forge mission statement , prioritized generating immediate value for the community members rather than optimizing their PX Gender Business Category ( ies ) Participant Type P1 Woman Community Development Supporter P2 Man Lifestyle and Youth Motivation Entrepreneur P3 Man Law Supporter P4 Man Music and Entertainment Entrepreneur P5 Man Community Development Supporter P6 Woman Peer - to - Peer Support Supporter P7 Man Music and Entertainment Entrepreneur P8 Man Community Development Supporter P9 Man Housing and Development Entrepreneur P10 Man Business Development Supporter P11 Woman Community Development Supporter P12 Man Law Supporter P13 Woman Finance Supporter P14 Woman Bakery and Confections Entrepreneur P15 Woman Community Development Supporter P16 Woman Gifts and Party Planning Entrepreneur P17 Woman Estate Settlement and Food Entrepreneur P18 Non - Binary Events and Entertainment Entrepreneur P19 Woman Stationary and Homeware Entrepreneur Table 2 : Tech Help Desk and interview participant demo - graphics . Participants were able to opt - out of sharing any as - pect of their identity . All but four entrepreneurs who lever - aged Tech Help Desk were sole proprietors of their busi - nesses , and the other businesses had less than five employ - ees . research agenda , maintained transparency with research practices , depriorizted data collection , and routinely sought feedback from Community Forge members and staff for how to improve Tech Help Desk . To build relationships with Community Forge entrepreneurs , the first and last authors attended the quarterly tenant mixers hosted by Community Forge . Research team members spent mixers introducing themselves to tenants and asking entrepreneurs what kinds of technology questions , goals , and challenges they were experiencing . Community Forge staff served as an intermediary for some of these introductions , in order to provide context to tenants for the research team’s presence within Community Forge and to facilitate trust building . 4 FINDINGS 4 . 1 Entrepreneurs Resourcefully and Discerningly Stitch Together an Ecology of Technical Support We share the ways that entrepreneurs resourcefully and discern - ingly sought technical support to demonstrate entrepreneurs’ abil - ity in solving technical challenges . In addition , we detail the en - trepreneurs’ ecology of support to make salient the on - going tech - nical challenges that are not yet addressed , illustrating the need for a strategic and responsive model of technical support to match the approach of the entrepreneurs . Overall , entrepreneurs identified and used a range of services to overcome computing challenges including : courses and workshops , social support including peers CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . and mentors , as well as one - on - one support from business - related professionals ( e . g . , accountants , business coaches ) . 4 . 1 . 1 Courses and Workshops . Several entrepreneurs participated in business courses which were offered at local universities , public libraries , private companies , non - profits , and online . P11 , a en - trepreneurial support personnel , reflected that offering workshops allowed for larger reach for topics when providers need to “tell everyone the same thing” . P14 who ran a food business participated in seminars run by a local non - profit covering foundational busi - ness questions and technology ( e . g . , What type of customer are you trying to attract ? Will you use cash app or Venmo to accept payments ? ) This enabled her to immediately improve her use of the technology she was already using ( e . g . , by using analytics on a social media app ) . However , classes didnot always lineup with entrepreneurs’ goals ( reported by P1 , P5 - 6 , P9 , P11 , P15 ) . In practice , entrepreneurs’ tech - nology needs were time - sensitive and dependent on business stage , domain and their existing knowledge . Further , general - audience classes offered through public libraries and universities were less useful as they were not tailored to the entrepreneurial context ( e . g . , P11 noted that a general Excel course at the library did not cover how to use Excel for accounting – e . g . , templates or formulas for creating a profit and loss ) . Even if material in classes may be eventually be useful to their business , entrepreneurs often opted to spend their time on their immediate business tasks instead , as : “ [ Entrepreneurs ] might’ve for - gotten [ the class material ] by the time they have that need , especially if it’s not required , [ and then ] they won’t attend a session until the need is there . ” ( P1 ) . Still , P4 who noted that 80 - 90 % of course content tended to be redundant , strategically tuned in through less relevant content because “there’s always something in there you didn’t know” . To use courses to meet their business goals , entrepreneurs planned to take specific classes when they reached that business need ( e . g . , P7 planned to take a QuickBooks accounting software class once they outgrew paper filing ) and wished for regular local technology classes with on - demand access ( P14 ) . 4 . 1 . 2 Social Support : Peers and Mentors . Entrepreneurs identified informal opportunities for technical support through their own networks , and incubator or accelerator - style programs . Several en - trepreneurs reported that they had a network of a few trusted peers or mentors with similar businesses tasks who they could contact to work through specific technology challenges . Peers or mentors with similar businesses could provide highly domain - specific tech - nical help , as P4 described seeking on - demand technology support for a last minute filming job from a peer who was on a commercial shoot : “I kept calling and he went on FaceTime and he went through all the settings [ and ] he told me what to punch in . ” Peer support also provided one - on - one help to work through well - known technical problems with a better approach . P7 described that he contacted his website’s company after running into a problem connecting his domain name ( a common issue , P1 , P6 ) , and the company emailed back instructions for how to resolve the problem . However , P7 still ended up calling his friend to discuss the instructions due to their shared experience , mutual understanding and trust . While peer and mentor support was valuable for entrepreneurs addressing their computing challenges , existing networks did not always have the specific skill needed ( e . g . , P7 did not know anyone who used a highly specialized music platform ) , and busy entrepreneur peers have limited time to provide support ( e . g . , P4 sent his peer a gift for providing last - minute tech support ) . As a result , entrepreneurs desired technical assistance which was available on - demand , as well as ways to expand their peer networks . To do so , several en - trepreneurs participated in incubator - style programs in which they could meet other entrepreneurs . To create opportunities to build social support relationships among entrepreneurs which endured , program leaders emphasized the importance of in - person interactions such as in - person co - working , mixers , barbeques and pitch competitions ( P1 , P5 - 6 , P8 , P15 ) . Building new relationships in - person provided entrepreneurs with more information about potential support from peers or men - tors . For example , P2 preferred to meet only in - person for technol - ogy support , as physical aspects like body language were important for him to find signals of trustworthiness . These in - person events were also critical to combat the isolation entrepreneurs can ex - perience : “We just really want to emphasize [ getting ] comfortable speaking about their business” ( P8 ) . However , when it came to con - structing cohorts of peer entrepreneurs through incubator - style programming , program leaders emphasized difficulties that can arise . For example , curating peer cohorts was challenging ( P5 - 6 ) as a single cohort member can impact the efficacy of the whole group if there were clashing personalities , competing business models , or personal issues . 4 . 1 . 3 One - on - One Technology Support with Business Profession - als . Entrepreneurs in our study also identified opportunities for technical support while completing other business tasks with pro - fessionals ( e . g . , business coaches , accountants , lawyers and web developers ) . They accessed such professionals either through an incubator - style program or through hiring them for a specific job ( e . g . , to complete taxes , to file for incorporation ) . For the most part , business coaches did not provide support for low - level technical challenges ( P6 , P10 , P12 , and P15 ) , but would provide higher level feedback on how to use technology to reach business goals ( e . g . , whether or not to build a website - P10 ) . 4 . 2 Addressing the Long Tail of Computing Challenges with Tech Help Desk While the ecology of support entrepreneurs resourcefully created addressed many of their technical challenges , there were still com - puting challenges that entrepreneurs were not able to readily ad - dress given a mismatch in the design of these support structures and entrepreneurial needs . In this section , we describe the 61 com - puting challenges entrepreneurs addressed with Tech Help Desk to further illuminate the need for strategic and responsive technical support . We refer to this collection of 61 challenges addressed with Tech Help Desk as the long tail of computing challenges , given the large number of unique challenges that were solved . We categorize challenges into : ( 1 ) operational challenges ( related to the specific tool at hand , similar to “medium - related” challenges in [ 71 ] ) , ( 2 ) strategic challenges ( related to the strategic selection and applica - tion of tools to a specific goal , similar to information and strategy in [ 71 ] ) , and ( 3 ) access challenges ( related to balancing technology costs in time or money with other business expenses ) . To examine Tech Help Desk CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA the importance of our side - by - side approach which informed the discoverability of challenges , we distinguish between challenges that were self - diagnosed ( an entrepreneur - identified issue ) versus collaboratively diagnosed ( both entrepreneur and provider working together to uncover needs ) . 4 . 2 . 1 Self - Diagnosed Challenges were Mostly Operational Chal - lenges . Entrepreneurs sought support when they self - identified technical challenges that blocked progress towards a business goal . Of the 34 unique technology challenges that entrepreneurs pre - sented to providers ( i . e . , self - diagnosed ) , 19 were operational chal - lenges , 12 were strategic challenges , and three were access chal - lenges . Self - diagnosed operational challenges indicated that a tool did not clearly communicate how to execute desired tasks , sug - gesting opportunity for improvements to technology design . The 19 operational challenges were related to : the entrepreneurs’ web - sites ( P1 - 2 , P5 , P7 , P14 - 17 ) , generating digital content ( P1 - 2 , P4 - 9 , P11 , P15 - 17 ) , and other types of general hardware and software challenges ( P1 - 3 , P5 , P6 , P8 - 13 , P15 - 19 ) . For example , as all en - trepreneurs in our study used a website service provider ( e . g . , Wix , Squarespace , Wordpress ) , many sought assistance with operational challenges related to these platforms in order to : upload video and photos to their website ( P2 , P14 ) , navigate an online product dashboard ( P2 ) , update branding ( P16 - 17 ) , customize a blog post template ( P2 ) , add new product listings to online store ( P2 , P15 - 17 ) , understand surprising web tool behavior ( e . g . , why a customer was charged ahigh priceforshipping foran orderplaced intheir website , P2 ) , and to fix expired security certificates ( P7 , P11 ) . Entrepreneurs generating digital content sought support to edit videos and photos of merchandise ( P2 , P4 , P7 ) and to create or edit an existing PDF flyer ( P5 , P9 ) . Beyond websites and digital content , entrepreneurs sought help for general software and hardware challenges includ - ing : downloading software ( e . g . , Microsoft 365 - P9 , Quickbooks - P1 , P5 ) , improving device performance ( P2 , P9 ) , locating software features to complete task at hand ( P1 - 2 , P5 , P9 ) , and forwarding calls to business phone ( P18 ) . Self - diagnosed strategic challenges represented times where en - trepreneurs proactively sought out advice on how to effectively use technology towards their business goals . The 12 self - diagnosed strategic computing challenges included : understanding the norms of use for computing tools such as social media platforms ( e . g . , when / what / how to post ) ( P9 - 10 , P12 ) , selecting between several options for tools to use ( e . g . which website provider or financial software ( P13 , P17 ) , determining credibility and trustworthiness of computing tools ( P2 , P9 , P16 ) , and building the confidence to make technological decisions that could greatly impact their business ( e . g . , publishing a new version of their website ( P16 ) ) . Access challenges represented that resources should be easier to acquire including fast and flexible capital opportunities [ 56 ] and on - demand technology lending . The three access challenges that entrepreneurs shared were : paying for maintenance costs of websites and other software programs ( P1 , P2 , P16 ) , having reliable access to equipment ( vinyl , laser , etc ) ( P15 ) , and having reliable access to data and wifi - enabled devices ( P15 ) . 4 . 2 . 2 Computing Challenges Entrepreneurs and Providers Collabo - ratively Identified . We found that entrepreneurs’ demanding sched - ules made spending time optimizing their use of technology to be in competition with time spent completing essential business management tasks . Thus , collaboratively identified challenges ( 27 of 61 challenges in our data ) presented as moments of recognizing opportunities for improved technology use – or disuse . The 15 ( out of 27 ) strategic challenges identified by entrepreneurs in collabo - ration with providers included : discovering helpful tools for the task at hand ( P1 , P5 - 6 , P10 - 11 , P13 , P17 ) , considering whether or not to prioritize use of computing tools alongside other business demands ( where entrepreneurs often realized that they needed to demote the prioritization of computing tools in order to ensure strong business foundation ( P1 , P3 , P5 , P8 , P10 - 13 ) ) , optimizing for a minimum viable website ( rather than overextending their already limited resources to use more advanced technology ( P3 , P10 , P12 ) ) , deciding how much time to spend acquiring computing skills for tools they already use to become more expert versus allocating time learning other tools ( P1 , P3 , P10 , P12 ) , and planning their tool usage as their business grew . Beyond the strategic challenges , there were 12 operational challenges which were collaboratively identified between entrepreneur and Tech Help Desk provider such as how file types impacted uploading ability to online platforms ( P5 ) , management of multiple devices and file sharing across de - vices efficiently ( P2 ) , and implementing effective website design principles ( P2 , P16 - 17 ) . These collaboratively identified operational challenges indicated that a technology tool was likely inadequately equipped to provide error messages and recognize opportunities for improved use . By distinguishing the types of challenges entrepreneurs ad - dressed alongside whether the entrepreneur identified them ( self - diagnosed ) or worked with a provider to identify them ( collabo - ratively diagnosed ) illuminated how a side - by - side approach can facilitate further discovery of an array of computing challenges through mutual observation during Tech Help Desk sessions . Oper - ational challenges were more likely to be observed by entrepreneurs themselves , as opposed to strategic challenges which were more likely to be identified with the providers’ assistance . In the dis - cussion section , we reflect on why this may the case . In the next section , we detail three entrepreneurs’ experiences using Tech Help Desk to address their long tail of computing challenges . 4 . 3 Three Vignettes : Addressing Computing Challenges with Tech Help Desk To illustrate how Tech Help Desk sessions uncovered and addressed a diverse set of computing challenges with entrepreneurs , below are three vignettes of Tech Help Desk sessions which the first author conducted . While each entrepreneur had vastly different technical needs , each vignette showcases how the strategic and responsive Tech Help Desk model uniquely addressed diverse computing chal - lenges . 4 . 3 . 1 Non - profit Founder Sets Up to Work from Home During a Global Pandemic . P9 ( 65 - 74 year old man , 30 + years running his business ) , the founder of a local non - profit housing and develop - ment association , first heard about Tech Help Desk through the Community Forge monthly newsletter in April 2020 . Initial Computing Challenge . P9 wanted to use TechSoup , a third - party platform that offers subsidized software for non - profits , to download Office 365 . His prior Office 365 license was soon to expire CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . and he needed to complete tasks at home on his personal laptop due to the lockdown . Addressing the Initial Computing Challenge . The provider worked with P9 over the course of three one - hour remote Tech Help Desk sessions to install Office 365 via TechSoup on his laptop . P9 shared his screen so that the provider could provide direct guidance . During moments when P9 would enter sensitive information ( username and passwords ) , the provider would close her laptop partially and communicate she was doing so to P9 . The provider searched online for all of the steps required to download the software through TechSoup – this was her first time using TechSoup – and shared the documents she found so they could follow along together . The provider helped P9 formulate a request to TechSoup’s customer support to retrieve his license information ( which he could not locate in his records ) . The provider and P9 scheduled a follow - up session depending on P9’s preferences . Given the urgency of having this software installed , P9 opted for the follow - up sessions to be within the same week . At the end of the third session , using the latest version of Office 365 , P9 successfully opened a new Word document on his laptop . Addressing Additional and Collaboratively Diagnosed Computing Challenges . P9 reached out to the provider at an additional time in 2020 to set up Constant Contact ( to reach his customers during the lockdown ) . In these follow - up sessions , P9 and the provider spent time sharing how they and their loved ones were doing – at this point , the two had spent several hours together and taking the time to deepen the relationship felt important to both . During these sessions , the provider observed how P9 navigated his file system , retrieved documents , and opened the browser and applications . She suggested ways to make P9’s laptop run more efficiently , as well as how P9 could more quickly traverse his file system and find applications . It had not occurred to P9 to attempt to clear disk space , but instead he had accepted the wait time as applications loaded and closed . P9 set up a total of four additional one - on - one one - hour Tech Help Desk sessions to cover technical issues that arose during prior sessions based on the provider’s observations and recommendations . Between P9’s prior experience using TechSoup to download software , and the provider’s ability to effectively search for , inter - pret , and actualize online documentation , together the two were able to address P9’s technical requests . The collaborative nature of the sessions increased with each session , as the provider and P9’s relationship building deepened . 4 . 3 . 2 Returning Citizen Sprints to Finalize Website in time for Mar - keting Event . P2 ( 35 - 44 year old man , less than one year running his business ) , the founder and sole proprietor of his lifestyle and motivation coaching business , scheduled his first Tech Help Desk session in August of 2021 . While in the Community Forge kitchen , the provider ran into P2 and struck up a conversation explaining who she was and what technical services were available to him via Tech Help Desk . Initial Computing Challenge . P2 shared that he was trying to finish his website ( hosted on Wix ) in order to have it ready for an upcoming marketing event . Similarly to P9 , P2 felt out of the loop with the many computing tools ; P2 shared that he had recently completed a decade - long jail sentence and during this time he was unable to stay abreast with the substantial technological advance - ments . P2 emphasized that he had leaned on the support of his “mentor slash business coach” as well as a close “tech savvy” friend in order to decide which devices to purchase and how to set up his website . Addressing the Initial Computing Challenge . P2 wanted to update his website’s product page , add a video of a recent speech he had given , and finish his blog posts . Even though the P2 had already set up his website with his friend , he could not remember how to navigate the website’s dashboard . The provider loaded his website on her laptop across different browsers and simulated different screen sizes to look for mobile compatibility which he noted in his notebook for future use . The two sat side - by - side viewing each others’ screens and the provider created a pretend Wix website on her laptop so that she could familiarize herself with available tools . The initial meeting extended beyond the hours of the Tech Help Desk window , but such flexibility of the provider’s schedule was important ; P2 expressed needing to be far enough along on any given task where he could continue to work on the task without her assistance . Between the sessions , the provider summarized the tasks com - pleted in the previous session , the tasks they would collaboratively prioritize in the next session ( based P2’s preferences ) , and any ac - tion items for P2 to complete between sessions . P2 noted that this documentation was helpful for him to stay on task , as well as visu - alize the progress he has made . At the end of P2’s series of sessions , his online store was up - to - date with all of his merchandise ( size and color options ) , and his website included a motivational blog post and embedded video of his first paid motivational speech . Addressing Additional and Collaboratively Diagnosed Computing Challenges . P2 began to ask about more types of technical assistance the provider could offer , as he observed how the provider used her laptop to complete similar tasks to his while they sat side - by - side . For example , P2 observed how the provider used keyboard short - cuts and asked “how did you do that so fast ? ” After explaining what keyboard shortcuts were , they reviewed this in the next session ( and refreshed these shortcuts every session thereafter ) . P2 partici - pated in almost 15 sessions as he returned for several weeks , using Tech Help Desk as a concentrated co - working time for technology improvements across his business . P2 discovered Tech Help Desk through a “water cooler” en - counter in the Community Forge kitchen , as compared to the en - trepreneurs in the prior and following vignette who were more formally introduced to the service . Over the course of several ses - sions , P2’s resourceful and discerning approach to his business led him to explore the range of possibilities for how Tech Help Desk could help him . Rather than restricting conversation solely to technology , the provider and P2 allocated time for exchanging stories ( similar to P9 ) , and P2 often reflected on how his time in jail had impacted his entrepreneurial pursuits . Through these sto - ries , P2 shared he wrote a book while being incarcerated which was stalled due to a few technical complications ( which they ad - dressed in follow - up sessions ) . For both P2 and P9 , relationship building alongside technical assistance was important as deepening the relationship helped to extend the technical assistance . Tech Help Desk CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA 4 . 3 . 3 Party Planner Creates a Website in Time for a Bus Ad Launch . P16 , the founder and sole proprietor of her three - year - old gift and party planning business , had her first Tech Help Desk session in July 2021 . P16 was introduced to Tech Help Desk by a Community Forge director during open hours . Initial Computing Challenges . P16 wanted help with her website to ensure all was up - to - date in time for her business’s ad campaign on public buses in Pittsburgh , P . A . Tracing information in her in - box as well as her notebook , she explained she had two websites currently registered and did not know how to combine them . AddressingtheInitialComputingChallenge . Together , theprovider and P16 discovered that the server P16 was using for one of her websites , donated to her by a friend , was no longer in commission . P16 noted how distressing this period of time was when her website was down : “I was held hostage at one point with my website . I was so frustrated and it brought tears because that’s how I sell my prod - ucts . And for probably close to three months , my website was down . ” Throughout the next four sessions , the provider worked with P16 to curate , refine , and finalize the content to list on her functioning website , implement an intake form for potential customers inter - ested in her event services , as well as update her product listings to include her up - to - date event services . Importantly , P16 often knew the operations required to execute these tasks , but preferred to sit side - by - side with the provider as she felt more confident to experiment : “I can sit with [ the provider ] and click a button and not worry about my whole website crashing . ” ( P16 ) . By utilizing Tech Help Desk , P16 felt comfortable to engage in more experimentation with her technical decisions , as she knew someone was next to her in case something went awry . Throughout all the sessions , P16 took detailed notes so that she could refer to them later if she forgot why we made certain decisions or if she needed a refresher for completing similar tasks in the future . 4 . 3 . 4 A Reflection on Three Vignettes . All entrepreneurs relied on an ecology of support which they had resourcefully curated to fit their businesses needs across various types of resources ( e . g . , incubators and courses , friends , peers and informal social support , and hiring temporary assistance ) . But at some point , each of these types of support had a tipping point where the support was no longer available or would no longer suffice ( P2 did not want to strain social relationships with repeated help requests , P16’s updated budget disallowed hiring technical assistance , and P9’s colleague moved away ) . Given the strategic and responsive model of technical assistance provided through Tech Help Desk , the provider and entrepreneurs worked together in order to address an array of computing challenges identified by the entrepreneur . Moreover , Tech Help Desk’s collaborative approach facilitated relationship building which ultimately led to identifying and solving further computing challenges . 4 . 4 Limitations Together with our community partners at Community Forge , we co - designed Tech Help Desk within the particular setting of an entrepreneurial hub in Wilkinsburg , P . A . All entrepreneurs in our study were tenants of Community Forge or participants of the Business Bloom Program . This required at least a $ 100 per month desk fee or an application to the Business Bloom Program , thus en - trepreneurs needed to have some amount of preexisting capital . In the future , we aim to make Tech Help Desk accessible to more Wilkinsburg , P . A . community members beyond Community Forge members , though more work will be needed to facilitate discov - erability and scale of the service . While the design of Tech Help Desk may not be fully transferable to new contexts , we encourage future work to explore opportunities to repurpose features of our strategic and responsive model in community - driven projects for entrepreneur technical support . In addition , the research team was predominantly from a private university neighboring Wilkinsburg , P . A . , and the entrepreneurs at Community Forge were predomi - nantly from Wilkinsburg , P . A . As shared identity is an important component of trust , Tech Help Desk can work to improve trust by recruiting or hiring providers who have more overlapping di - mensions of identity such as place of employment ( or status as an entrepreneur ) , place of origin , or socioeconomic status . 5 DISCUSSION This work uncovered how local entrepreneurs running businesses in a variety of non - technology domains leveraged technology - centered and non - technology centered support to address the tech - nology challenges that they encountered . Through our close part - nership with Community Forge leaders and community members , we co - designed a model of technical assistance that is strategic , in that it is designed to fit the context of local entrepreneurs , and responsive , in that it prioritizes emergent needs ( See Table 1 ) . The two - and - a - half - year ( and on - going ) deployment of Tech Help Desk demonstrated its support for entrepreneurs addressing computing challenges including troubleshooting support , support for planning and executing a technology project , and support for uncovering opportunities to improve the efficiency of their technology tasks . Our approach enabled us to gain knowledge about the long tail of computing challenges local entrepreneurs with diverse business do - mains , backgrounds , and goals face ( RQ1 ) , the ecology of support resourceful and discerning local entrepreneurs from lean economies construct to overcome technology challenges ( RQ2 ) , and how a strategic and responsive model of technology assistance can address gaps that standard technical support struggles to remedy within the entrepreneurial context ( RQ3 ) . Our complementary interviews with individuals who support entrepreneurs as accountants , acceler - ator managers , business coaches , and lawyers beyond Community Forge provided greater depth to our understanding the importance of Tech Help Desk’s uniquely strategic and responsive approach . In this section , we highlight three key design trade - offs we made to effectively instantiate our model in the context of local entrepreneurs in a co - working space ( Table 1 ) : ( 1 ) responsive rather than standardized support for entrepreneurs solving the long tail of computing challenges , ( 2 ) long - term learning rather than short - term problem solving for entrepreneurs balancing technical de - mands with other business needs , and ( 3 ) prioritizing active trust and relationship building . CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . 5 . 1 Responsive rather than standardized support for the long tail of computing challenges Initial conversations with Community Forge stakeholders high - lighted the importance for the research team to provide immediate value for the community upon arrival , so we prioritized responsive technical support through Tech Help Desk’s individual support sessions . We identified unique benefits of providing responsive support within the context of an entrepreneur community . First , entrepreneurs who visited Tech Help Desk or participated in inter - views described that they used ( or planned to use ) a variety of other existing services for standardized support such as digital literacy classes or business accelerator programs . In contrast , prior work that provided course or group support for entrepreneurs focused on those who do not have access to these standardized forms of sup - port [ 40 , 62 ] . Still , entrepreneurs in our study used the responsive support provided by Tech Help Desk for distinct , time - sensitive computing challenges not clearly addressed elsewhere ( e . g . , clear - ing files off of a computer , transferring image files across devices , and removing an image from a Wix website ) . In the future , respon - sive support that has access to the dynamically changing needs of local entrepreneurs can inform the curriculum for courses and incubators . In interviews , participants noted that while existing technol - ogy support was offered in courses or incubators , it was primarily oriented towards program goals or a curriculum ( similar to tiered curriculum support in education [ 10 , 24 , 28 , 39 ] ) , and thus lacked capacity to support the long tail of computing challenges ( See Fig - ure 2 for a comparison between curriculum - driven support and need - driven support for local entrepreneurs ) . Incubator leaders re - ferred entrepreneurs to us for technology support outside of their incubator’s scope , and entrepreneurs visited us when other courses ended . In the future , we could also refer entrepreneurs to courses or services as needed . Finally , entrepreneurs leveraged Tech Help Desk’s hybrid drop - in and appointment schedule to stop by for a single session ( e . g . , to clear off files to fix a slow device ) , or to schedule repeated follow - ups ( P2 attended 15 sessions total ) to work through a single or emergent set of computing challenges ; this scheduling format accommodated varied experience levels . We also uncovered unique challenges of providing responsive support . First , the novelty of Tech Help Desk’s broad and responsive support demonstrated a challenge in communicating its purpose and scope . Entrepreneurs initially approached Tech Help Desk with needs outside scope including making a website for them ( providers did not complete tasks for entrepreneurs ) or supporting trademark and legal issues ( providers did not have legal expertise required ) . As miscommunication can mean wasted time for busy entrepreneurs , we updated our flyer to describe the side - by - side style and list examples of help we provided ( See flyer in Supplemental Mate - rial ) . Second , scaling responsive support to multiple entrepreneurs per provider at a time is challenging . In particular , entrepreneurs’ goals and experience levels are diverse , and scaling necessitates less responsiveness to these factors as entrepreneurs would spend less time directly working with the provider . To limit demand , we advertised only within Community Forge ( rather than to the sur - rounding area of Wilkinsburg , P . A . ) . In practice , providers worked with one entrepreneur at a time , or two if they arrived at similar times ( in which case entrepreneurs occasionally used the opportu - nity to meet each other ) . Future work could explore one - to - three ( or higher ) support by providing a co - working room where the provider can circulate and peers can work together with guidance . Finally , tracking the outcome of highly responsive support like Tech Help Desk is challenging compared to standardized support , where programs may conduct pre - and post - tests for courses or evaluate business success along program goals . Program organizers ( P5 and P8 ) shared that when they facilitate referrals to external resources for technical issues , it is currently either challenging ( for website development ) or nearly infeasible ( for coaching ) to manu - ally track and document whether or not the referral was successful . As tracking impact is important for non - profits [ 17 ] , future work should explore how to deliver and document responsive support to benefit both entrepreneurs and program goals . 5 . 2 Collaborative learning for resourceful and discerning entrepreneurs Our design of Tech Help Desk involved the resources of a few volunteers to provide an opportunity for support a few hours a week ( as opposed to an organization that can provide around - the - clock support [ 60 ] ) . Given that entrepreneurs adapt to changing business needs between and after visits to Tech Help Desk ( e . g . , adding a product to a website ) , we opted to promote learning via a side - by - side approach that has been found to be successful for tech - nology learning ( e . g . , paired programming [ 34 ] , over - the - shoulder learning [ 70 ] ) . The design and deployment of the side - by - side approach within Tech Help Desk revealed nuances about the implementation and benefits that differ from prior work . First , providers initially aimed to demystify technological problem solving by expressing when they did not know how to solve the problem at hand and then collaboratively solving the problem along with the entrepreneur . In practice , we found it was also important to establish providers as knowledgeable at the start ( e . g . , by sharing past experiences and education , knowledge about alternative technology [ 27 , 48 ] ) , as entrepreneurs looked for signals to discern that providers would not waste their time by leading them astray . In this way , providers served as both a “guru” in terms of their knowledge , and a “gar - dener” in terms of fostering a collaborative approach ( rather than prior work where employees assumed one role or the other [ 31 ] ) . Second , given the diversity of tools and technology experiences of entrepreneurs , the side - by - side shared screen approach offered the chance to collaboratively discover ways for entrepreneurs to optimize their technology use across a wide range of tasks ( e . g . , from discovering alternative tools for their work to accessing ad - ditional files in a list ) . In fact , 27 of 61 of the unique computing challenges in our data were collaboratively diagnosed . While inde - pendently diagnosed challenges prompted a visit to Tech Help Desk via a notable error or blocker towards business goals ( e . g . , computer slows to a halt , or not able to update website with new product ) , collaboratively diagnosed challenges represented non - blocking im - provements for efficiency ( e . g . , scrolling through files vs . using a work - around ) or alternative strategies to using technology ( e . g . , using a website builder to create a minimum viable web presence Tech Help Desk CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Figure 2 : A comparison of the traditional Multi - Tiered System of Support [ 39 ] for formal curriculum - driven education com - pared to our model for need - driven technology education for local entrepreneurs . rather than building a new web application from scratch ) . Future researchers and program directors may consider side - by - side tech - nical support as an approach to inform future standardized support or referrals for local entrepreneurs . The side - by - side approach was not always best for entrepreneurs seeking technology support while proactively managing their time . Entrepreneurs juggling many roles within their company several times visited Tech Help Desk or scheduled an appointment , but selected to not attend or complete the session due to dynamically shifting demands on their time ( e . g . , an important client phone call or an assistant in need of help during a session ) . While side - by - side style support allowed entrepreneurs to learn technical skills to maintain any changes made during the session , busy entrepreneurs may benefit from additional opportunities for delegated , rather than learning - centered , support for particularly rare or one - off tasks that are unlikely to require maintenance ( e . g . , initial device set - up like setting up a printer ) . Entrepreneurs occasionally identified that they would prefer to delegate a task ( e . g . , launching a website , designing a logo ) to use their time completing a core business product or service that would be more difficult to delegate . This judicious use of time was also encouraged by the business coaches that we interviewed . In this case , our model still can support entrepreneurs – for example , P17 leveraged Tech Help Desk to help identify and assess a professional to hire for her business’s website development . Future work may consider how to adapt Tech Help Desk’s model for later stages of business where delegation may be more frequently necessary . 5 . 3 Prioritizing trust and relationship building over provider flexibility When a discerning entrepreneur considers working with a support person , establishing trust – or the belief that engaging with a per - son is unlikely to cause harm [ 30 ] – is a necessary prerequisite [ 27 ] . While help desk providers in traditional workplace settings benefit from institutional credibility when establishing trust [ 46 ] , our re - search team was from an institution that historically had a tenuous relationship with community members at our field site [ 2 , 3 ] . In our study , entrepreneurs also noted they felt their lack of technological expertise made them vulnerable to being disrespected , overcharged or otherwise scammed . To engage in support relationships with entrepreneurs despite prior institutional and technology - related harms , we prioritized actively building trust with Community Forge entrepreneurs . We identified several strategies for building trust to facilitate technicalsupportin anexistingcommunityandspaceforentrepreneurs . First , the design and deployment of Tech Help Desk benefited from a cascade of trust . That is , we initially established trust with com - munity leaders by dramatically changing our research agenda in response to existing needs of the community space ( such change often occurs when appropriately weighing community input above researcher input during community - based research [ 48 ] ) . Build - ing trust with community leaders and providing a community - driven service prompted to Community Forge leaders to then refer entrepreneurs to us ; and , these referrals in turn facilitated trust between the entrepreneur and Tech Help Desk provider . Second , entrepreneurs who used Tech Help Desk and Community Forge leaders reflecting on attributes of Tech Help Desk that facilitated trust cited the reliable and long - term nature of technical support . The reliable time and place enabled ease of referral and getting to know Community Forge members when lulls occurred . Finally , the reliability also encouraged entrepreneurs to use their own techni - cal skills more . For example , P16 described how she felt she could now change her website without fear of breaking it for a long time , as she could always visit Tech Help Desk the next Wednesday if needed . However , it is difficult to tell when Tech Help Desk did not succeed at building trust . When entrepreneurs did not approach Tech Help Desk or return for a follow up ( which happened on three occasions ) , it is unclear as to why that happened and whether a lack of trust was at play . For example , entrepreneurs may have no longer needed technical help because they addressed the issue quickly , or hired a technical employee ( as was the case with one entrepreneur we worked with ) . However , it is also likely that in some ways we failed to build trust . In the future , we will experiment with alternative approaches to understand the reasons entrepreneurs did not use or continue to use Tech Help Desk services ( e . g . , by asking collaborating community leaders to talk to entrepreneurs for potentially more frank responses ) . Finally , prioritizing consistency and relationship building made it challenging to introduce new CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Kotturi , et al . providers to the project ( a months - to years - long rather than drop - in volunteer activity ) . Future work may explore new incentives for long - term technical support volunteers such as course credit . 6 CONCLUSION Today’s local entrepreneurs must navigate an increasing array of technological tools to achieve their business goals . To under - stand and address the computing challenges faced by local en - trepreneurs in a lean economy , we co - designed an on - going tech - nical service , called Tech Help Desk , with a local entrepreneurial hub – Community Forge – in Wilkinsburg , P . A . Our participatory ap - proach revealed how entrepreneurs resourcefully and discerningly addressed their day - to - day computing challenges by curating an ecology of support , yet many challenges went unaddressed . To keep pace with local entrepreneurs and ever - changing technological ad - vancements , Tech Help Desk mirrored the strategic and responsive approach entrepreneurs took to building their businesses in or - der to address their long tail of computing challenges . Our work informs researchers’ understanding of computing challenges and helps to create responsive technical support within an already ex - isting ecosystem for entrepreneurs .
