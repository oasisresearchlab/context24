1089 RESEARCH ARTICLE INTRODUCTION Notch signaling is used universally in animals and in nearly every developmental context ( Bray , 2006 ) . In the signaling cells , transmembrane ligand endocytosis is necessary for signaling ( Le Borgne et al . , 2005 ; Le Borgne , 2006 ; Chitnis , 2006 ; Nichols et al . , 2007a ) . In Drosophila , ligand endocytosis and signaling depend on Epsin ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ; Wang and Struhl , 2005 ) , an endocytic factor first identified in vertebrates that functions in at the internalization step of endocytosis ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) . Drosophila Epsin is encoded by the liquid facets ( lqf ) gene ( Cadavid et al . , 2000 ) . Recently , the endocytic protein Auxilin has been implicated in Notch signaling in Drosophila ( Hagedorn et al . , 2006 ; Eun et al . , 2007 ) . Auxilin is an adapter for the ATPase Hsc70 ( Heat shock cognate 70 ) ; Auxilin binds Hsc70 with its J domain and also binds Clathrin cages , which are Hsc70 substrates . Auxilin catalyzes the binding of Hsc70 to Clathrin cages and stimulates its ATPase activity ( Lemmon , 2001 ; Eisenberg and Greene , 2007 ) . The evidence is most solid for two direct functions of Auxilin , one in internalization and a second in uncoating Clathrin - coated vesicles . At the internalization step , Hsc70 / Auxilin exchanges Clathrin on cages forming at the plasma membrane , which might help to constrict vesicles prior to scission . After scission , Hsc70 / Auxilin removes the Clathrin cages , allowing vesicle fusion with endosomes ( Lemmon , 2001 ; Eisenberg and Greene , 2007 ) . Here , we show that Drosophila Auxilin is crucial in signaling cells for Delta internalization and signaling . In addition , we show that the requirement for Auxilin is , at least in part , to maintain the pool of free Clathrin . We infer that Clathrin has a key role in the signaling cells . We discuss how these observations impact current thinking on the roles of Epsin and endocytosis in the signaling cells .

P - element constructs and transformation Molecular biology was performed using standard procedures . Cloning enzymes and standard oligonucleotides were from New England Biolabs and Roche , custom oligonucleotides were from IDT , and DNA purification kits were from Qiagen . The DNA sequences of all PCR products were verified . ro - aux + An aux + cDNA in pOT2 ( GH26574 from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center , Bloomington , IN ) was purified as an Xho I - Eco RI fragment and ligated into those sites of pBSKSII + ( Stratagene ) to generate pBS - aux + . The Eco RI site in pBS - aux + was changed to Asc I by ligating annealed oligonucleotides of the sequence 5 (cid:3) - AATTGGCGCGCC - 3 (cid:3) into the Eco RI site . Subsequently , the Xho I site in the resulting plasmid was changed to Asc I by ligating annealed oligonucleotides of the sequence 5 (cid:3) - TCGAGG - CGCGCC - 3 (cid:3) into the Xho I site . The 4 . 4 kb Asc I fragment containing the aux + cDNA was ligated into the pRo vector ( Huang and Fischer - Vize , 1996 ) and the correct orientation determined by Sal I digestion . The aux + cDNA coding region is 3498 nt long , including start and stop codons , and it encodes a protein of 1165 amino acids ( aa ) , including the Met initiator codon . UAS t - aux CBD + J This construct contains nt 2071 - 3498 of the aux + cDNA coding region , corresponding to aa N691 - A1165 . A 1 . 4 kb region of the aux + coding region was amplified by PCR ( Platinum PCR Supermix , Auxilin is essential for Delta signaling Suk Ho Eun , Susan M . L . Banks and Janice A . Fischer * Endocytosis regulates Notch signaling in both signaling and receiving cells . A puzzling observation is that endocytosis of transmembrane ligand by the signaling cells is required for Notch activation in adjacent receiving cells . A key to understanding why signaling depends on ligand endocytosis lies in identifying and understanding the functions of crucial endocytic proteins . One such protein is Epsin , an endocytic factor first identified in vertebrate cells . Here , we show in Drosophila that Auxilin , an endocytic factor that regulates Clathrin dynamics , is also essential for Notch signaling . Auxilin , a co - factor for the ATPase Hsc70 , brings Hsc70 to Clathrin cages . Hsc70 / Auxilin functions in vesicle scission and also in uncoating Clathrin - coated vesicles . We find that like Epsin , Auxilin is required in Notch signaling cells for ligand internalization and signaling . Results of several experiments suggest that the crucial role of Auxilin in signaling is , at least in part , the generation of free Clathrin . We discuss these observations in the light of current models for the role of Epsin in ligand endocytosis and the role of ligand endocytosis in Notch signaling .

The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM - T Easy ( Promega ) . A 1 . 4 kb Eco RI - Xho I fragment containing aux CBD + J was purified and ligated into pUAS t ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) restricted with Eco RI and Xho I . UAS t - aux K + PTEN This construct contains nt 1 - 2103 of the aux + cDNA coding region , corresponding to aa M1 - E701 . A 2 . 1 kb Asc I fragment containing aux K + PTEN was generated by PCR using pBS - aux + as a template , the primers 5 (cid:3) - AAAGGCGCGCCATGGGCGAGTTCTTTAAGTCGCTC - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - AAAGGCGCGCCTCACTCAGGGTCTGGCAGATCATCCA - 3 (cid:3) , and Pfu Turbo Polymerase ( Stratagene ) .

UAS t - aux (cid:2) J This construct contains nt 1 - 3291 of the aux + cDNA coding region , corresponding to aa M1 - D1097 . A 3 . 3 kb fragment containing aux (cid:2) J was generated by PCR using pBS - aux + as template , the primers 5 (cid:3) - AAA - GGCGCGCCATGGGCGAGTTCTTTAAGTCGCTC - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - GGCTA - GCTTAATGTCCCACAACACTGTGTGCATAG - 3 (cid:3) , and Herculase DNA Polymerase ( Stratagene ) . The product was ligated into pGEMT - Easy , re - isolated as an Asc I - Xba I fragment , and ligated into pUAS t restricted with those enzymes . pgaux CBD + J This construct is the 21 kb genomic DNA fragment in pgaux + ( Eun et al . , 2007 ) , subcloned as an Nhe I fragment into the Xba I site of pCasper3 ( Thummel and Pirrotta , 1992 ) to generate pCasper3 - gaux + , and with a deletion of 4101 bp that includes the kinase and PTEN domains , and an addition of two aa ( Leu - Glu ) , corresponding to an Xho I site ( 5 (cid:3) - CTCGAG - 3 (cid:3) ) just downstream of the start codon . This was achieved by replacing an internal 10 . 7 kb Kpn I fragment with a 6 . 6 kb Kpn I fragment , which was generated by joining three PCR products ( Herculase ) , a 5 (cid:3) product , a middle product , and a 3 (cid:3) product that generates the deletion . The 984 bp 3 (cid:3) product was amplified using pCasper3 - gaux + as template and the primers 5 (cid:3) - ACTCGAGAACCAGGACTTGGATGATCTGCCAG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - GGTA - CCGCCTGTGGCTGCG - 3 (cid:3) , ligated into pGEM - T and re - isolated as an Xho I - Kpn I fragment and ligated into pBSII restricted with the same enzymes . The middle fragment ( 2852 bp ) was generated the same way using the primers 5 (cid:3) - AGATATCTCCGGATGGGCAGACACGAA - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - ACTCGAGCATTTTGGTGGTGGCCAATGCTA - 3 (cid:3) , isolated as an Eco RV - Xho I fragment and ligated into those two sites in pBSII containing the 3 (cid:3) fragment . The 5 (cid:3) fragment ( 2789 bp ) was generated the same way using the primers 5 (cid:3) - AGCGGCCGCGGTACCGCCCGAGCCCG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - TCCGGATGTTGCAAACTTTCCAA - 3 (cid:3) , isolated as a Not I - Bsp EI fragment , and ligated into those two sites in pBSII containing the 3 (cid:3) and middle fragments . Finally , a 6 . 6 kb Kpn I fragment was isolated from the resulting pBSII plasmid and ligated into pCasper3 - gaux + restricted with Kpn I . pgChc + A 14 . 3 kb Avr II - Sac II fragment of BAC22H11 ( BACPAC Resources , Oakland , CA ) containing Chc + genomic DNA was ligated into pCMC105 ( a gift of C . - M . Chen and G . Struhl , Columbia University , New York , NY ) restricted with Avr II and Sac II . The resulting plasmid was restricted with Avr II , and a 4 . 5 kb Nhe I - Xba I fragment of pAT806 ( a gift of K . Basler and G . Struhl ) containing a w + marker gene was ligated in . Tub - aux + An (cid:4) Tub84B ( Tub ) promoter fragment was excised from pKB700 ( a gift of K . Basler and G . Struhl ) as a 2 . 6 kb Not I - Kpn I fragment and ligated into pBSKSII restricted with the same enzymes . The Not I site in the resulting plasmid was changed to Avr II by inserting the linker 5 (cid:3) - GGCCCCTAGG - 3 (cid:3) . The Tub promoter was excised as an Avr II - Kpn I ( 3 (cid:3) overhang removed ) fragment . A 4 . 4 kb Eco RI - Xho I fragment containing the aux + cDNA was excised from clone GH26574 and ligated into pBSKSII restricted with the same enzymes . The Xho I site of the resulting plasmid was changed to Nhe I using the linker 5 (cid:3) - TCGAGCTAGC - 3 (cid:3) , the Eco RI site was changed to Eco RV using the linker 5 (cid:3) - AATTCGATATCG - 3 (cid:3) , and the Not I site was changed to Avr II using the linker 5 (cid:3) - GGCCCCTAGG - 3 (cid:3) . The Tub promoter fragment was ligated into the resulting plasmid restricted with Eco RV and Avr II , and an Avr II - Nhe I fragment containing Tub - aux + was excised . A 1 . 2 kb Spe I - Xba I fragment containing transcription termination signals was excised from pAT806 and ligated into pCasper4 ( Thummel and Pirrotta , 1992 ) restricted with Spe I . A plasmid with the termination signal in the appropriate orientation was isolated , restricted with Spe I , and the Tub - aux + ligated in . Transformation P - element transformation of w 1118 flies was performed according to standard methods in our laboratory or by Genetic Services ( Sudbury , MA ) . Auxilin antibodies Antibodies were generated to Auxilin amino acids Q702 - A1165 . The corresponding DNA sequence was amplified by PCR using primers 5 (cid:3) - GGATCCCAGGTGACACCTCGGTTCTGCG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - GAATTCCG - CA TTAAACATATTTTGCTGCGTG - 3 (cid:3) , with plasmid GH26574 as a template , and subcloned into pGEMT . A Bam HI - Eco RI fragment containing the aux coding sequences was ligated into pRSET ( Invitrogen ) restricted with the same enzymes , which added six His codons at the beginning of the open reading frame . Protein expression from pRSET - aux was in BL21 - CodonPlus - RIL cells ( Invitrogen ) induced with 0 . 1 mM IPTG . The 6xHis - Aux protein was purified from sonicated cells using HisBind ( Novagen ) and used to raise antibodies in rats ( Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory , Canadensis , PA ) . Prior to use for immunostaining , the antisera were preadsorbed with fixed w 1118 Drosophila embryos . Analysis of eyes and wings Third instar larval eye discs were fixed in PEMS and antibody incubations and washes were in PBST ( see Fischer - Vize et al . , 1992 ) . Primary antibodies used were : mAb323 ( 1 : 2 ) obtained from Sarah Bray ( University of Cambridge , UK ) ; mAb202 ( 1 : 10 ) from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ( DSHB ) , Iowa City , IA ; rat anti - Elav ( 9 : 1 ) from DSHB ; and anti - Aux ( 1 : 500 ) . Secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) were AlexaFluor 568 anti - mouse and AlexaFluor 633 anti - rat ( 1 : 300 ) . AlexaFluor 568 - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) was dried and resuspended in PBST at 0 . 1 unit / l . Eye discs were mounted in Vectashield ( Vector ) and viewed with a Leica TCSSP2 confocal microscope . Plastic sectioning of adult eyes was as described ( Tomlinson and Ready , 1987 ) , and wings were dehydrated in 70 % ethanol and mounted in DPX ( Fluka ) . Wing and eye sections were photographed with a Zeiss Axioplan and Axiocam HRc . Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop . RESULTS auxilin ( aux ) mutants have the same eye development defects as lqf or Delta mutants Throughout this work , we refer to aux 727 / aux D128 or aux 727 / aux D136 heterozygous cells or animals as aux – . [ The aux alleles were analyzed previously ( Eun et al . , 2007 ) . ] The nonsense mutant aux D136 is likely to be null because the truncated protein it may produce would lack the J domain ( Fig . 1A ) , which we show below is necessary for Auxilin function . aux 727 and aux D128 are also likely null alleles because of their early nonsense mutations ( Fig . 1A ) , and because their phenotypes in trans to each other or aux D136 are indistinguishable . Also , we show below that the mutant eye phenotype of either aux – genotype is identical to lqf or Delta null mutants . Finally , in eye discs immunolabeled with a polyclonal antibody to the C - terminal 464 amino acids of Auxilin , whereas adjacent aux + cells showed strong signals , clones of aux 727 / aux D128 ( Fig . 1B , B (cid:3) ) cells showed no signal above background . Nevertheless , there could be some truncated and functional Auxilin protein produced by aux 727 or aux D128 that escaped detection . In aux 727 or aux D128 homozygous larvae , mutant aux mRNA accumulates to levels similar to those seen in wild type ( data not RESEARCH ARTICLE Development 135 ( 6 ) D E V E L O P M E N T shown ) , and thus through reinitiation of translation downstream of the nonsense mutation , aux 727 or aux D128 potentially could produce truncated Auxilin protein . As we show that the C - terminal region of Auxilin containing the Clathrin - binding and J domains is sufficient for function , truncated Auxilin protein so produced could be functional . We could not test whether or not these alleles produce truncated protein undetectable by immunolabeling because the Auxilin antibody we generated does not detect Auxilin protein on blots of Drosophila wild - type protein extracts . aux – clones in third instar larval eye discs displayed phenotypes consistent with the failure of three Delta signaling events near the morphogenetic furrow ( Fig . 1C ) . Cells anterior to the furrow require Notch activation to achieve neural potential ( proneural enhancement ) ; when Notch activation fails at this point , no neurons develop ( Baker , 2002 ) . As cells exit the furrow , lateral inhibition results in evenly spaced ommatidial preclusters ; failure of Notch activation at this point results in disordered photoreceptors ( R - cells ) ( Baker , 2002 ) . R - cell determination in aux – clones appeared identical to that in Delta or lqf null clones ( Baker and Yu , 1996 ; Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) . No R - cells ( Elav + ) were present in the center of large aux – clones , and aux – R - cells present at clone borders were disorganized ( Fig . 1D , D (cid:3) ) . Another indicator of lateral inhibition failure is increased Delta transcription ( Baker and Yu , 1998 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ) . aux – clones showed increased expression of a Delta - lacZ enhancer trap ( Fig . 1E , E (cid:3) ) and also increased Delta protein ( Fig . 1F , F (cid:3) ) . It was reported previously that Delta - lacZ is not upregulated in eye discs ( Hagedorn et al . , 2006 ) . Perhaps the discrepancy is due to differences in the mutant aux alleles used . A later Notch signaling event is R - cell restriction , in which R2 / 5 and R3 / 4 signal precluster cells in the developing ommatidium to limit the number of outer R - cells to six ( Fig . 1C ) ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) . Like Delta or lqf hypomorphs ( Parks et al . , 1995 ; Cadavid et al . , 2000 ) , aux hypomorphic eyes contain ommatidia with extra outer R - cells ( Hagedorn et al . , 2006 ; Eun et al . , 2007 ) . As is the case for Epsin , the requirement for Auxilin in eye patterning appears limited to Notch signaling . Several different signaling pathways are needed for morphogenetic furrow movement , and Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling is essential for R - cell determination ( Lee and Treisman , 2002 ; Kumar , 2002 ; Nagaraj et al . , 2002 ) . These pathways are operating in aux – clones because furrow movement inside aux – clones resembles that in wild type ( Fig . 1F , F (cid:3) ) , and cells expressed Elav , a marker of R - cell determination ( Fig . 1D , D (cid:3) ) . In addition , neither Epsin ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ) nor Auxilin is required for cell viability . Auxilin is essential in signaling cells only aux – cells become R - cells at clone borders , where they are adjacent to aux + cells that signal and impart proneural potential ( Fig . 1D , D (cid:3) ) . This suggests that aux – cells can receive Notch activation signals . Indeed , aux – cells expressed Enhancer of split proteins [ E ( spl ) ] , a direct response to Notch activation ( Jennings et al . , 1994 ) , but only when adjacent to aux + cells at clone borders ( Fig . 1G , G (cid:3) ) . In addition , in aux hypomorphic eyes , expression of aux + in R2 / 5 and R3 / 4 by a transgene ( ro - aux + ) rescued the mutant phenotypes of ommatidia with ectopic R - cells : ~ 25 % of facets in aux K47 / aux D128 were wild - type , and the addition of ro - aux + increased the fraction to ~ 95 % ( data not shown ) . The ro expression construct is remarkably specific for R2 / 5 and R3 / 4 1091 RESEARCH ARTICLE Auxilin is essential for Delta signaling Fig . 1 .

Thus , R - cell restriction fails when R2 / 5 and R3 / 4 have little aux + activity because they cannot signal to extraneous precluster cells . We conclude that aux – cells in the eye can receive , but not send , Notch signals . Auxilin is required for some , but not all , Delta internalization Membrane - localized Delta is almost undetectable in immunolabeled wild - type eye discs ( Fig . 2A ) ( Parks et al . , 1995 ; Baker and Yu , 1998 ; Overstreet et al . , 2003 ; Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) . Rather , nearly all Delta detected is in endocytic vesicles that are probably irrelevant to signaling , as they are observed in lqf – cells that do not signal ( Fig . 2C ) ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ) . In lqf – clones , lateral inhibition failure results in Delta overexpression ( Baker and Yu , 1998 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ) , which allows detection of Delta on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2C ) . This is observed also in eye discs that are hypomorphic for both lqf and heterozygous for a neuralized ( neur ) mutation ( Fig . 2D ) ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) . neur encodes a Ubiquitin ligase required for Delta ubiquitination and signaling ( Le Borgne et al . , 2005 ; Le Borgne , 2006 ) . Delta eventually clears from the membrane and is observed again only in intracellular puncta several rows posterior to the furrow ( Overstreet et al . , 2003 ; Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) . A similar phenomenon is observed with Notch temperature sensitive ( N ts ) mutant discs raised to the restrictive temperature for 6 hours ( Fig . 2B ) ( Baker and Yu , 1998 ) . However , in N ts discs , where lateral inhibition fails owing to a failure in signal reception , Delta clears from the membrane quickly and only a tight band of membrane - associated Delta is apparent at the furrow ( Fig . 2B ) ( Baker and Yu , 1998 ) . By contrast , in lqf – cells , Delta remains on the membrane for a longer time ( more rows of cells ) posterior to the furrow ( Fig . 2C , D ) ( Overstreet et al . , 2003 ; Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) and we interpret this as inefficient endocytosis . This observation is similar to that in the wing disc , where Delta was overexpressed using a transgene and clones of lqf – cells accumulated more Delta on the membrane than did adjacent wild - type cells ( Wang and Struhl , 2004 ) . Delta also persisted on the membrane in aux mutant cells ( Fig . 2E - E (cid:7) , F - F (cid:7) ) . Also , as in lqf – clones ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ) , Delta puncta were present in aux – cells ( Fig . 2F , G ) . We conclude that like Epsin , Auxilin is required for some , but not all , Delta internalization . Similarly , in yeast and vertebrate cells , aux mutations result in decreased endocytosis ( Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Umeda et al . , 2000 ) . An Auxilin fragment including the Clathrin - binding domain and J domain is sufficient for Notch signaling Drosophila Auxilin , like vertebrate auxilin 2 or GAK ( cyclin G - associated kinase ) , has N - terminal kinase and PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin - related ) domains ( Fig . 3 ) , the functions of which are unclear ( Umeda et al . , 2000 ; Lemmon , 2001 ; Korolchuk and Banting , 2002 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ; Eisenberg and RESEARCH ARTICLE Development 135 ( 6 ) Fig . 2 .

The auxilins of yeast and C . elegans , which lack kinase and PTEN domains , uncoat clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) in vitro and in vivo ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Greener et al . , 2001 ) , and the Clathrin - binding and J domains of GAK are sufficient for uncoating in vivo ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ; Greener et al . , 2000 ) . The presence of the kinase and PTEN domains in Drosophila Auxilin suggests that the function of Auxilin in Notch signaling might not be limited to Clathrin uncoating or exchange . To determine whether or not the kinase and PTEN domains or the J domain are required for Notch signaling , we generated transformants with the four different UAS transgenes shown in Fig . 3A . The transgenes were tested in single copy for their ability , when expressed ubiquitously with Act5C - gal4 , to complement strong aux – mutants and hypomorphs . We found that Auxilin FL or Auxilin CBD + J complemented all aux – mutant phenotypes , and that Auxilin K + PTEN and Auxilin (cid:2) J had no activity ( Fig . 3A ) . Act5C > auxilin CBD + J might overexpress Auxilin CBD + J relative to endogenous Auxilin . Because genomic transgenes are likely to be expressed at physiological levels , we also generated a transgene ( gaux CBD + J ) that expresses Auxilin CBD + J in the context of a genomic DNA construct , gaux + ( Eun et al . , 2007 ) . A single copy of either gaux + or gaux CBD + J complemented all aux – phenotypes ( Fig . 3A ) . These results suggest that the ability of Auxilin CBD + J to complement aux – is unlikely to require its overexpression . We conclude that the J domain is necessary and a C - terminal Auxilin fragment including the Clathrin - binding and J domains is sufficient for function in Notch signaling . Thus , the role of Auxilin is likely to depend on its function as a link between Hsc70 and Clathrin cages . Consistent with functions in endocytic vesicle internalization and uncoating , Auxilin was detected apically in cytoplasmic puncta near the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3B ) . The Notch pathway phenotypes of aux mutants are partially suppressed by an extra copy of the Chc + gene In aux mutants , it would be expected that the levels of free Clathrin are limiting owing to inefficient uncoating of CCVs . In yeast and C . elegans , free clathrin is depleted in aux mutants ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ) . Consistent with Clathrin depletion in Drosophila aux mutants , we found that a loss - of - function mutation in the Clathrin heavy chain gene , Chc 1 , is a strong dominant enhancer of aux hypomorphs : Chc 1 / + flies appeared normal , and aux K47 / aux D128 adult flies were viable with Notch - like phenotypes , but Chc 1 / + ; aux K47 / aux D128 adults could not be obtained . It was reported previously that expression of GFP - Clathrin light chain ( Clc ) enhances aux phenotypes ( Hagedorn et al . , 2006 ) , and this result was repeatable in our hands . We do not think , however , that this genetic interaction contradicts the results with Chc mutants . Rather , as GFP - Clc does not colocalize with Chc in the eye disc ( data not shown ) , we propose that GFP - Clc acts as a dominant negative . There are no Clc mutants available to test for complementation by GFP - Clc . We also tested whether an additional copy of the Chc + gene ( PChc + ) suppresses the Notch - like phenotypes of aux – hypomorphs . We found that PChc + suppresses the wing phenotype completely ( Fig . 4A , B ) and the eye phenotype significantly ( Fig . 4C - F ) . Similarly , in C . elegans , aux ( RNAi ) mutant phenotypes are suppressed by overexpression of clathrin heavy chain ( Greener et al . , 2001 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Notch pathway phenotypes of aux mutants are due at least in part to Clathrin depletion . Clathrin is likely to be needed in some manner for Delta internalization . Indeed , we have shown that Delta endocytosis is inefficient in aux mutants . Thus , the requirement for Auxilin does not necessarily infer a requirement 1093 RESEARCH ARTICLE Auxilin is essential for Delta signaling Fig . 4 .

The wing is indistinguishable from that of wild type . ( C ) Bar chart showing the degree of suppression of aux K47 / aux D128 eyes by a single copy of PChc + . For each genotype , 51 - 124 facets in each of ten eyes were examined . Error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean calculated for each eye . The effect of PChc + is significant ( Student’s t - test , P < 0 . 001 ) . ( D - F ) Tangential sections of adult eyes are shown as examples of data tabulated in C . PChc + complements Chc 1 completely ( Bazinet et al . , 1993 ) . The mutant phenotype of aux hypomorphs reflects some defects in lateral inhibition ( see Fig . 2E ) , and mainly defects in R - cell restriction . The same phenomenon was observed for lqf hypomorphs ( Overstreet et al . , 2004 ) . This observation might reflect a particular requirement for efficient Delta signaling in R - cell restriction , or mechanistic differences in signaling at different times during eye development . D E V E L O P M E N T 1094 in the signaling cells for trafficking of Delta - containing endosomes downstream of internalization , as proposed previously ( Hagedorn et al . , 2006 ) . DISCUSSION A role for Clathrin in Notch signaling cells was originally inferred from the observation that Chc mutants are strong dominant enhancers of lqf hypomorphs ( Cadavid et al . , 2000 ) . As Epsin has both Ubiquitin - and Clathrin - binding motifs , and also binds the plasma membrane , the simplest scenario imaginable for Clathrin and Epsin function in Delta internalization is for Epsin to act as a Clathrin adapter that recognizes ubiquitinated Delta , and brings Clathrin to the membrane for CCV formation ( Wendland , 2002 ) . However , in light of evidence that Epsin - dependent endocytosis of ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins such as Delta may not occur through formation of CCVs ( Chen and De Camilli , 2005 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ; Aguilar and Wendland , 2005 ; Hawryluk et al . , 2006 ; Barriere et al . , 2006 ; Madshus , 2006 ) , it became unclear how to interpret the Chc / lqf genetic interaction . The results presented here point to a crucial role for Clathrin in Notch signaling cells . One intriguing possibility is that Delta internalization depends on Clathrin not because Delta is endocytosed in CCVs , but because Clathrin is a positive regulator of Epsin function . More experiments are required to test this idea . Why do tissues that lack Epsin or Auxilin display Delta - like phenotypes , rather than phenotypes indicating failure of many signaling pathways or even cell death ? One possibility is that the apparent specificity of both Epsin and Auxilin might simply reflect the usual redundancy of endocytic protein functions , and an unusual dependence of Notch signaling on efficient endocytosis . Alternatively , a special function of Epsin might be crucial to Notch signaling cells . Two kinds of models have been proposed to explain why Notch signaling requires ligand endocytosis by the signaling cells ( Le Borgne et al . , 2005 ; Le Borgne , 2006 ; Chitnis , 2006 ; Nichols et al . , 2007a ) . One idea ( the ‘pulling model’ ) is that after receptor binding , ligand endocytosis generates mechanical forces that result in cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain ( Notch activation ) , either by exposing the proteolytic cleavage site on the Notch extracellular domain , or by causing the heterodimeric Notch receptor to dissociate ( Parks et al . , 2000 ; Nichols et al . , 2007b ) . Alternatively , ligand internalization prior to receptor binding might be required to process the ligand endosomally , and recycle it back to the plasma membrane in an activated form ( the ‘recycling model’ ) ( Le Borgne and Schweisguth , 2003 ; Wang and Struhl , 2004 ; Wang and Struhl , 2005 ; Emery et al . , 2005 ; Jafar - Nejad et al . , 2005 ) . Epsin might generate an environment particularly conducive to either pulling or recycling , and Auxilin might be required specifically by Notch signaling cells because it activates Epsin , perhaps by providing free Clathrin . Alternatively , Auxilin might be needed to provide free Clathrin because Delta is internalized through CCVs . In this case , if Auxilin is required in Notch signaling solely to provide free Clathrin , the implication would be that efficient CCV uncoating is not important for generating uncoated Delta - containing vesicles per se , which are prerequisite for travel through an endosomal recycling pathway . Further understanding of the role of Auxilin in Notch signaling cells might be key to understanding the role of ligand endocytosis .
