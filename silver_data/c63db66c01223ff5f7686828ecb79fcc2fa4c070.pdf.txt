N - WASP has been implicated both in the formation of cell - surface projections ( filopodia ) required for cell movement and in the actin - based motility of intracellular pathogens . To examine N - WASP function we have used homologous recombination to inactivate the gene encoding murine N - WASP . Whereas N - WASP - deficient embryos survive beyond gastrulation and initiate organogenesis , they have marked developmental delay and die before embryonic day 12 . N - WASP is not required for the actin - based movement of the intracellular pathogen Listeria but is absolutely required for the motility of Shigella and vaccinia virus . Despite these distinct defects in bacterial and viral motility , N - WASP - deficient fibroblasts spread by using lamellipodia and can protrude filopodia . These results imply a crucial and non - redundant role for N - WASP in murine embryogenesis and in the actin - based motility of cer - tain pathogens but not in the general formation of actin - containing structures . P recise regulation of the actin cytoskeleton controls such diverse processes as cell growth and proliferation , cell move - ment , adhesion and the motility of intracellular vesicles and pathogenic organisms . Filopodia and lamellipodia are actin - con - taining structures that are essential for cell motility . The generation of these structures is regulated by members of the Rho - family GTPases—Cdc42 , Rac and Rho 1 . Cdc42 and Rac have been impli - cated in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia by regulating the activity of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family members 2 – 4 . The WASP family in humans comprises WASP , N - WASP and three Scar / WAVE molecules ( Wave 1 , 2 , 3 ) 2 , 5 – 8 . WASP is expressed solely in haematopoietic cells , whereas N - WASP and Scar / WAVE are expressed more generally . Upon binding to active Cdc42 and Rac , WASP proteins induce Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly , leading to the generation of specific actin - containing structures 9 – 15 . WASP and N - WASP are maintained in an autoinhib - ited configuration at rest 2 , 16 . Maximal induction of Arp2 / 3 - mediat - ed actin assembly requires the binding of both phosphatidylinosi - tol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and GTP - Cdc42 , which unfolds the autoinhibited WASP molecule and thus permits Arp binding 11 , 16 – 19 . Although the sequential activation of Cdc42 / Rac ﬁ WASP ﬁ Arp2 / 3 ﬁ actin assembly is now well accept - ed , it still remains unclear how this process is regulated by other WASP - binding molecules ( for example , WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) , Grb2 , profilin and Nck ) 20 . Further insight into the basic properties of the host’s actin poly - merization machinery has been obtained from studies investigating the actin - based motility of intracellular microorganisms . To move within and between cells , several parasites ( for example , Listeria , Shigella and vaccinia virus ) used the same actin assembly machinery as that regulating host cell movement 21 , 22 . Upon invasion , these pathogens induce the formation of an actin - containing tail that drives bacterial movement . Tail formation requires surface proteins on the intracellular pathogen that , directly or indirectly , drive Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly . N - WASP has been implicated in regulating Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization for some ( for example , Shigella and vaccinia ) but not all ( for example , not Listeria ) pathogens that exploit the host’s intracellular actin polymerization machinery to move within cells 23 – 26 . Listeria and Shigella each have a surface protein ( ActA and IcsA , respectively ) that is required for actin tail formation and localizes to the site of polymerization 24 , 27 – 29 . Whereas ActA directly binds and stimulates the Arp2 / 3 complex 29 – 31 , Shigella uses N - WASP as a molecular bridge between IcsA and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex 23 . Thus , Shigella , but not Listeria , requires N - WASP for tail for - mation 24 , 25 . Vaccinia virus also forms virus - tipped actin tails upon infection and seems to use N - WASP as a link to the Arp complex 26 . In contrast to Shigella , vaccinia does not bind N - WASP directly but seems to use Nck and WIP as a bridge between vaccinia surface pro - teins and N - WASP 26 , 32 , 33 . To address the role of N - WASP in murine development and in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , we inactivated N - WASP in the mouse germline by homologous recombination . We show a critical and non - redundant requirement for N - WASP in murine embryogenesis and the actin - based motility of Shigella and vac - cinia , while revealing an N - WASP - independent pathway for the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 OCTOBER 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 898 Results Gene targeting . The N - WASP gene was inactivated in mice by deleting an essential 5 ¢ exon ( Fig . 1 ) . A 12 - kilobase ( kb ) stretch of N - WASP genomic DNA was isolated by screening a lambda phage 129 murine genomic library and was determined as containing the first three coding exons ( Fig . 1a ) . Because the second exon ( nucleotides 109 - 244 ) contains sequences thought to be essential for N - WASP function 3 , this exon was replaced in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells with a neomycin - resistance gene ( neo r ) in the reverse transcriptional orientation flanked by loxP sites by gene - targeting methods ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Two independent N - WASP - targeted ( N - WASP + / neo ) ES cells were used to generate N - WASP + / neo germline mice . N - WASP neo / neo ES cells were isolated from N - WASP + / neo ES cells by selecting for growth in increased concentrations of G418 ( Fig . 1b ) . Western analyses of protein lysates from N - WASP neo / neo ES - cell - derived fibroblast - like cells ( ES - FLCs ; Fig . 1c ) failed to detect a pro - tein product by using antibodies raised against either full - length N - WASP 11 or a carboxy - terminal fragment of N - WASP 6 . The neo r gene was deleted in N - WASP neo / neo ES cells by transient expression of Cre recombinase , yielding N - WASP - / - cells . Western analyses also failed to detect N - WASP protein in these cells ( Fig . 1c ) . N - WASP - deficient embryos survive beyond gastrulation and initi - ate organogenesis . Similarly to the general pattern of N - WASP expression in bovine tissues 6 , murine N - WASP RNA transcripts are expressed in ES cells , in embryonic tissue and in most adult tissues examined ( including brain , heart , liver , kidney , colon , lung , spleen and thymus ; data not shown ) . Because , as noted above , N - WASP neo / neo ES cells could be generated from N - WASP + / neo ES cells , N - WASP is not required for the continued survival or proliferation of this specific cell type . Matings of N - WASP + / neo male and female mice failed to yield live N - WASP neo / neo pups ( see Table 1 ) . The num - bers of N - WASP + / neo and N - WASP + / + live pups closely followed expected Mendelian ratios . No obvious defects were noted in the reproductive vigour , weight or lifespan of N - WASP + / neo mice . To determine the precise gestational stage of embryonic development that was compromised by N - WASP deficiency , N - WASP neo / neo ( N / N ) embryos were analysed at various gestational stages after timed matings . We expected that N - WASP deficiency would result in early embryonic lethality and that , as in Cdc42 and Rac deficiency , devel - opmental arrest before or at the time of gastrulation would occur 34 , 35 . Surprisingly N / N embryos developed normally through gastrulation and survived to embryonic day 11 . 0 ( E11 . 0 ) . However , gross examination and histological analyses of E8 . 0 – E11 . 0 embryos revealed marked developmental delay with prominent neural tube and cardiac abnormalities . In comparison with N - WASP + / + ( WT ) and N - WASP + / - littermate controls , N / N embryos were significant - ly smaller ( Fig . 2 ) . As early as E8 . 5 , N / N embryos had developmen - tal delay ( smaller in size , some unturned embryos ) . There was prominent undulation of the neural tube ; however , the neural tube was closed ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Although cardiac tissue was clearly apparent in N / N embryos ( Fig . 2a , c , d ) , at the stages before death this organ was markedly dilated and filled with red blood cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) .

Extra - embryonic tissues including placenta and yolk sac seemed normal ( data not shown ) . Although the specific devel - opmental abnormalities leading to the death of the N / N embryos remain uncertain , defective cardiac function might be a cause . Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that N / N embryos ( even at E11 . 0 ) were never observed to have a beating heart . However , N - WASP is not required for the intrinsic contrac - tions of cardiomyocytes , because spontaneously contracting cells could be obtained from N - WASP - deficient early embryos ( data not shown ) . To rule out the possibility that the lethality resulting from N - WASP deficiency results from cis effects from the inserted phos - phoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) - neo r cassette on neighbouring genes , this cassette was removed by mating N - WASP + / neo mice with mice expressing Cre ( designated N - WASP + / - ) . No viable N - WASP - / - pups were isolated from crosses of N - WASP + / - mice ( Table 1 ) . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from E9 . 5 N - WASP - deficient embryos ( N - WASP neo / neo ) were initially viable , yet they failed to expand despite the normal growth and expansion of cells from N - WASP + / + littermate controls . To generate fibroblast cell lines from these embryos , N - WASP + / + and N - WASP neo / neo E9 . 5 pri - mary fibroblasts were transformed with a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) large - T - containing retrovirus . Two independent lines of N - WASP + / + ( WT ) and N - WASP neo / neo ( N / N ) SV40 - transformed fibroblast - like cells ( SV - FLCs ) were isolated from independent embryos . Western analyses confirmed the absence of N - WASP expression in these N - WASP - deficient SV - FLCs ( Fig . 1d ) . Because FLCs derived from either ES cells ( ES - FLCs , described above ) or SV40 - transformed embryos ( SV - FLCs ) behaved similarly in the experiments described below ( despite the fact that SV40 is known to have effects on the actin cytoskeleton 36 , 37 ) , they will be referred collectively as FLCs . Studies investigating growth rate , adhesion to extracellular matrix ( fibronectin ) , and migration across a wound failed to identify significant differences between WT and N / N FLCs ( S . B . S . and F . W . A . , data not shown ) . Actin - based motility and intercellular spread of Shigella is absent in N - WASP - deficient FLCs . To analyse in vivo the effect of N - WASP deficiency on intracellular movements of Shigella and Listeria , WT and N / N FLCs were infected with each pathogen and the actin cytoskeleton was revealed by staining with phalloidin ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Shigella localization was determined by staining with 4 ¢ , 6 - diamidi - no - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; for example , Fig . 3a ) . As reported for other infected cells 27 , intracellular Shigella move and assemble actin filament tails in WT FLCs ( Fig . 3a , left panel ( phalloidin staining ) ; 79 . 3 – 4 . 2 % s . d . of infected cells had actin tails ) . Whereas Listeria can infect and induce actin tail formation in N / N FLCs ( Fig . 3b , N / N ) , Shigella can infect only N / N FLCs ( Fig . 3a , centre panel ( DAPI staining ) ) , failing to induce tail formation ( Fig . 3a , centre panel ( phalloidin staining ) ; 0 % of infected cells had tails ) . The uptake of Shigella into N / N FLCs was confirmed and quantified by phagocytosis assays ( after 90 min of infection , 1 . 22 – 0 . 15 intracel - lular bacteria were located in WT cells , in comparison with 1 . 11 – 0 . 15 intracellular bacteria in N / N cells , P = 0 . 57 ) .

Immunoblots confirmed the expression of N - WASP in retrovirally infected WT and N / N FLCs ( Fig . 1d ) . In summary , these findings demonstrate that N - WASP is essential for the actin - based motility of Shigella but not for Listeria movement . However , N - WASP is not essential for the intracellular uptake of either Shigella or Listeria . The intercellular spread of Shigella is dependent on bacteria - induced actin assembly because IcsA bacterial mutants , which are defective in inducing actin assembly , are unable to spread from cell to cell 27 . Spreading of bacteria between neighbouring cells is readi - ly assessed by plaque formation after the infection of cell monolay - ers with Shigella . To evaluate the requirement for N - WASP in this process , confluent monolayers of WT or N / N FLCs were assessed for bacterial plaque formation after infection with Shigella . Bacterial plaques were clearly formed in WT FLCs , whereas no bac - terial plaques were formed in N / N FLCs ( Fig . 3c , left and centre panels ) . Furthermore , ectopic expression of N - WASP in N / N FLCs efficiently rescued plaque formation with similar rates of cell - to - cell spreading as measured by plaque size ( Fig . 3c , left and right panels : WT , 0 . 48 – 0 . 13 mm ; N - WASP in N / N , 0 . 51 – 0 . 21 mm ) . These results demonstrate that N - WASP is necessary for the inter - cellular spread of Shigella . Vaccinia movement is impaired in the cytoplasm of N - WASP - defi - cient FLCs . To analyse whether N - WASP is required for intracellu - lar vaccinia virus movement , WT and N / N FLCs were infected with vaccinia virus and stained for actin tails with phalloidin ( Fig . 3d ) . The cytoplasm of virus - infected WT FLCs had characteristic actin tail structures ( Fig . 3d , left panel : 79 . 7 – 4 . 6 % of infected cells with tails ) . In contrast , actin tail structures were not detected in N / N FLCs ( Fig . 3d , centre panel : 0 % of infected cells with tails ) . Viral nucleic acid is stained with DAPI ( Fig . 3d ) . Confocal images ( Z - series ) of vaccinia - infected WT and N / N FLCs demonstrated an intracellular localization ( data not shown ) . Most DAPI - positive par - ticles are unlikely to be sites of early vaccinia assembly and packag - ing ( that is , viral factories ) because a significant percentage of DAPI - positive particles in WT and N / N FLCs stain with an antibody against A33R that reacts with more mature viral forms ( data not shown ) . Because the ectopic expression of N - WASP in N / N FLCs resulted in an efficient rescue of tail formation ( Fig . 3d , right panel : 82 . 3 – 11 . 2 % of infected cells with tails ) , the effects noted were clearly a result of N - WASP deficiency . Thus N - WASP expression is essential for the actin - based movements of the vaccinia virus . WASP compensates for N - WASP in cytoplasmic vaccinia motility but not in Shigella motility . N - WASP has approximately 50 % homology at the protein level with WASP and contains a similar domain structure 6 . To determine whether WASP can functionally complement the defect in Shigella motility in N / N FLCs , we tested whether the ectopic expression of WASP ( Fig . 1d ) would rescue actin tail formation in N - WASP - deficient FLCs with the use of bicistronic WASP – GFP retroviral vectors ( Fig . 4 ) . WASP expression failed to rescue actin tail formation in N / N cells infected with Shigella ( Fig . 4 , upper right panel : 0 % of infected cells contained actin tail structures ) . Staining with DAPI ( Fig . 4 ) and fluorescence of GFP ( data not shown ) confirmed Shigella infection and retrovi - ral transduction , respectively . Hence , WASP cannot substitute for WT WT WT WT N / N N / N N / N N / N N / N ( RV - N - WASP ) N / N ( RV - N - WASP ) N / N ( RV - N - WASP ) a b c d Figure 3 The actin - based motility of Shigella flexneri and vaccinia , but not that of Listeria , requires N - WASP . a , Shigella tail formation is dependent on N - WASP . To characterize Shigella - infected cells , N - WASP + / + ( WT ) and N - WASP neo / neo ( N / N ) SV - FLCs were analysed by both rhodamine – phalloidin staining ( red ) of actin and DAPI staining ( blue ) of DNA . DAPI stains both nuclear and bacterial DNA . Actin tails are clearly formed in WT SV - FLCs ( left panel , arrow ) . Although Shigella clearly infects N / N cells ( centre panel , blue rods ) , actin tails are not visible .

Numerous plaques ( arrows ) are formed in WT ( left panel ) and N / N SV - FLCs that express N - WASP ectopically ( right panel ) but not in N / N SV - FLCs ( cen - tre panel ) . d , Vaccinia tail formation is dependent on N - WASP .

Shigella and vaccinia infections were confirmed by staining with DAPI . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles 901 N - WASP in the actin tail assembly process driven by Shigella . In addition , because a WASP – GFP fusion protein failed to target bac - teria in N / N cells ( data not shown ) , WASP’s inability to compensate for N - WASP in Shigella - induced actin assembly is most probably secondary to the failure of WASP to bind IcsA . In marked contrast , WASP expression efficiently rescued vaccinia tail formation and movement in N / N FLCs ( Fig . 4 , lower right panel : 90 . 3 – 8 . 5 % as effective as N - WASP , P > 0 . 1 ) , demonstrating that vaccinia viral particles can use either WASP or N - WASP in the assembly of actin - based processes . Nck and WIP are not recruited to Shigella and vaccinia in the absence of N - WASP . Recent studies have demonstrated that both Shigella and vaccinia can recruit Nck and WIP to sites of actin assembly 32 . However , it has been suggested that Nck and WIP recruit N - WASP with vaccinia , whereas N - WASP recruits WIP and Nck with Shigella 32 . We have confirmed the localization of Nck and WIP to sites of actin assembly in both Shigella - infected and vac - cinia - infected WT SV - FLCs ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . If Nck and WIP serve to recruit N - WASP to vaccinia , one would predict that these proteins should be recruited to viral parti - cles in N - WASP - deficient cells . We have been unable to detect the recruitment of either Nck or WIP to either Shigella - infected or vac - cinia - infected N / N SV - FLCs ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . These data are consistent with a recent report demonstrating the absence of localization of Nck and WIP in cells overexpressing the WASP - binding domain of WIP , a protein that probably sequesters N - WASP ( ref . 32 ) . N - WASP - deficient FLCs spread and extend filopodia in response to growth factor and serum . Because the actin - based motility of intracellular parasites seems to exploit similar signal - transduction cascades within the cell to that used for the regulation of actin - con - taining cellular protrusions , we sought to determine whether the aberrant bacterial movement displayed in N / N FLCs translated into specific defects in the motile behaviour of these cells . Actin - con - taining filopodial - like structures are found at the margins of WT and N / N FLCs stimulated with bradykinin ( an agent previously shown to generate filopodia in a Cdc42 - dependent fashion 38 ) , although time - lapse microscopy revealed that bradykinin induced the retraction of extruded processes ( WT , 40 – 6 . 9 % ; N / N , 58 – 9 . 4 % ) and not protrusive growth ( WT , 6 . 7 – 7 . 9 % ; N / N , 10 . 5 – 9 . 4 % ) in most responding cells . However , consistent with previous studies linking Cdc42 / N - WASP and filopodia formation 3 , 4 was our observation that when N / N FLCs were microinjected with constitutively active Cdc42L61 , the number of cells extending filopodia was decreased by more than 50 % compared with N - WASP + / + cells ( Table 2 ) . Ectopic expression of N - WASP in these cells partly rescued their response to Cdc42L61 . To decrease any contribution of filopodia / retraction fibres in the N / N FLCs resulting from signalling via the Rac pathway , microinjection of Cdc42L61 was performed in the presence of dominant - negative Rac in a separate experiment ( Table 2 ) . Because filopodia were still observed in a significant number of cells lacking N - WASP , we con - clude that these structures are also retraction processes or are gen - erated by an N - WASP - independent pathway . Moreover , we demon - strated by time - lapse video microscopy that both WT and N / N FLCs can protrude filopodia after stimulation with either serum ( Fig . 5a , b ; 28 . 4 % and 19 . 3 % of WT and N / N cells respectively ) or platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( Fig . 5c , d ; 22 . 2 % and 16 . 1 % of WT and N / N cells respectively ) . Careful quantitative analysis of large numbers of WT and N / N FLCs revealed that more than 90 % of filopodia generated from stimulation with either PDGF or serum arose from an existing lamellipodium ( Fig . 5 , arrows ) rather than from the elongation of an existing filopodium ( Fig . 5 , asterisks ) or from growth in the absence of dynamic actin structures . Taken together , these results reveal a signalling pathway to filopodia for - mation that is independent of both N - WASP and WASP . Treatment of serum - starved WT or N / N FLCs with serum or PDGF leads to the extension of large lamellae ( Fig . 5a – d , arrowheads , and data not shown ) . No significant difference between the rates of serum - induced and PDGF - induced filopodia or lamellipodia for - mation was detected between WT and N / N FLCs ( data not shown ) . Biochemical assays of actin nuclei numbers and filament content in serum - stimulated cells confirmed these morphological studies . The amount of filamentous actin assembled during cell spreading induced by serum was equivalent in N / N and WT FLCs ( Fig . 6a ) . Both cell types exposed similar numbers of barbed - end - orientated nucleation sites to drive this actin assembly process ( Fig . 6b ) . Because FLCs also do not contain the haematopoietic protein WASP , neither N - WASP nor WASP is required for PDGF - or serum - induced lamellipodial spreading and actin assembly in FLCs . Discussion N - WASP is expressed early in embryonic development and in all murine adult tissues examined . Therefore , given its likely diverse roles in regulating cell movement , one might expect that N - WASP is essential for the early patterning of cells required during embryonic development .

This was an unexpected find - ing because a deficiency in either Cdc42 or Rac1 , which are mole - cules known to regulate WASP - family members , results in embry - onic lethality at or about the time of gastrulation 34 , 35 . Gastrulation must therefore not require N - WASP - signalling events or must use other WASP - related molecules . The most marked defect was the developmental delay of N / N embryos and the pronounced neural - tube and cardiac defects . These findings are consistent with in situ hybridization studies showing N - WASP expression in the heart and neural tube of E9 . 5 embryos ( S . B . S . and Y . Fujiwara , unpublished results ) . Although the cardiac abnormality in N / N mice is one like - ly cause of the embryonic lethality at this stage , we cannot rule out the contributing effects of other tissues . The processes regulating cell movement and intracellular microbial actin - based motility use overlapping signalling cascades . Cell movement requires the generation of forwards - moving actin - con - taining structures such as filopodia and lamellipodia , whereas the movement of intracellular microorganisms requires the generation of actin - containing tails . Tail formation and filopodia formation might require similar , if not identical , signalling pathways , with the end result being the stimulation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assem - bly and the generation of either tails or filopodia . With the use of immunohistochemical techniques , in vitro assays and dominant - negative approaches , several reports have implicated N - WASP as an important bridge to Arp2 / 3 - activation by both Shigella and vaccinia 23 – 26 . However , the role ( s ) of other WASP - family members in these processes could not be assessed because of the limitations of the assays . Here we have shown , in vivo , that the extension of filopodia can proceed in the absence of N - WASP , whereas the formation of actin tails by Shigella and vaccinia absolutely require N - WASP . These pathogens use slightly different mechanisms . Shigella directly binds N - WASP to drive actin assem - bly 23 , 25 , whereas vaccinia seems to bind Nck , and subsequently WIP , to mediate N - WASP interaction 32 . We have also shown that the actin - based motility of vaccinia , but not Shigella , can use either N - WASP or WASP to mediate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly . Shigella ’s inability to use WASP probably results from structural differences in the IcsA - binding region , as suggested previously 25 . Because both WASP and N - WASP can interact with and seem to be regulated by WIP 39 – 41 , our data support the hypothesis that vaccinia can interact with either WASP or N - WASP through WIP as a com - plex mediating its actin - based motility 32 . However , despite recruit - ment of WIP and Nck to sites of actin assembly in vaccinia - infect - ed WT FLCs , we were unable to observe the recruitment of either Nck or WIP to vaccinia in the absence of N - WASP . Similar results were reported for vaccinia - infected cells that overexpressed the WASP - binding domain of WIP , a protein that might sequester N - WASP 32 . Taken together , these results suggest that Nck and WIP might not be upstream of N - WASP but exist as a preformed com - plex with N - WASP to be recruited to vaccinia . Alternatively , as observed with Shigella - induced actin assembly , vaccinia might not require these proteins for actin - induced assembly or might use one or both of these proteins downstream of N - WASP . In contrast to Shigella , vaccinia virus might have evolved a more flexible use of WASP - family members to facilitate motility within a broader host range of cells , including haematopoietic cells , which express more WASP than N - WASP ( S . B . S . and F . W . A . , unpublished observa - tions ) . We have also shown that N - WASP is required for the cell - to - cell spread of Shigella . This might reflect an inherent requirement of actin tail formation for the efficient targeting of bacteria to sites of cell contact 27 . Furthermore , we have demonstrated that neither Shigella nor vaccinia absolutely requires N - WASP for entry into the cell . Finally , our results confirm recent data that Listeria does not require N - WASP for actin - based motility 24 . Despite the absolute requirement for N - WASP in the actin - based motility of Shigella and vaccinia , N - WASP - deficient FLCs assemble actin and protrude lamellipodia normally in response to serum or growth factor . Scar / WAVE protein ( s ) might regulate actin assembly in these processes acting downstream of Rac 2 . Our data support earlier studies implicating a crucial role for N - WASP in the induction of filopodia by Cdc42 ( ref . 3 ) . The Cdc42 - induced path - way to filopodia is similar to the pathway exploited by Shigella and vaccinia in the formation of actin - based tails , in that both have a requirement for N - WASP . However , we have revealed an additional pathway leading to the generation of filopodia that is independent of N - WASP and WASP . It is unknown whether another WASP - fam - ily member is required for actin assembly in this pathway or whether this is a WASP - independent pathway . Methods Gene targeting . To isolate murine N - WASP genomic DNA , a murine 129Sv l phage genomic library was screened ( Stratagene ) with the rat N - WASP DNA as probe ( provided by Dr H . Miki and T . Takenawa , University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) . Several genomic phage clones were isolated and mapped by stan - dard techniques . Phage clone no . 5 contained approximately 12kb of DNA encompassing the three 5 ¢ coding exons . A targeting construct was generated to replace exon2 ( nucleotides 109 – 244 of the N - WASP gene ) by cloning a 5 ¢ 2 . 5 - kb Eco RI fragment and a 3 ¢ 3 . 7 - kb Hin cII fragment into a plasmid containing a loxP flanked neomycin - resistance ( neo r ) gene and a thymidine kinase ( tk ) gene . E14 . 1 ES cells ( provided by R . Murray ) were electroporated with the targeting construct ( pSBS97 ) and transfec - tants were isolated after positive and negative selection by standard methodology . To identify ES cell clones that were deleted for exon2 as a result of homologous recombination , DNA from transfectants was screened by Southern blotting techniques with a probe lying outside the homology region . Appropriately targeted ES clones were injected into C57Bl / 6 blastocysts ; highly chimaeric male off - spring were bred to C57Bl / 6 or 129SvEv female mice to generate F 1 offspring mice . To generate mice with neo r - deleted mutant alleles , F 1 mice were bred with EIIA - Cre / CD1 mice 42 . N - WASP neo / neo ES cells were generated by growing N - WASP + / neo cells in increased concentrations of G418 . The neo r gene was deleted in N - WASP neo / neo ES cells by transient transfection with pMC - Cre . Matings of N - WASP + / neo F 1 female and male mice failed to yield viable N - WASP neo / neo pups . Similarly , matings of N - WASP - / - F 1 female and male mice failed to yield viable N - WASP - / - pups . To determine the precise stage of cell death , embryos resulting from timed F 1 matings were isolated from pregnant females . Embryos were genotyped by PCR and Southern blotting techniques .

Retroviruses and vectors . Retroviruses expressing murine WASP 43 and rat N - WASP 44 were generated by cloning each coding sequence into a replication - defective retrovirus chicken matrix metalloproteinase ( CMMP ) 45 . WASP – GFP and N - WASP – GFP bicistronic viruses were constructed by cloning GFP ( containing an intra - ribosomal entry sequence ( ires ) ) downstream of WASP or N - WASP , respectively . Recombinant virus was produced upon transient transfection of the packaging cell line 293GPG by following a pub - lished protocol 46 . In brief , supernatant containing retroviral particles was harvested for five consecutive days and concentrated by ultracentrifugation ( 16 , 500 r . p . m . , 30 , 000 g ) to a final titre of 10 9 ml - 1 . WASP and N - WASP were cloned into Bgl II – Bsp 120L sites of pEGFP - C1 expression vector ( Clontech ) and Eco RI – Sal I sites of pEGFP - C2 expression vector ( Clontech ) , respectively . Preparation and analyses of murine embryonic or ES - cell - derived FLCs . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from N - WASP + / + and N - WASP neo / neo E9 . 5 embryos were immor - talized with an SV40 large - T - containing retrovirus ( provided by Dr David Fruman ) . For rescue stud - ies , these cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing WASP – GFP and N - WASP – GFP . Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that > 90 % of cells were virally infected . FLCs were also derived from N - WASP + / + and N - WASP neo / neo ES cells by passing cells for several generations in the absence of feeder cells and in medium that permits differentiation ( lacking leukaemia inhibitory fac - tor ) . FLCs generated from either N - WASP neo / neo ES cells or mouse embryos yielded identical results . Time - lapse video - microscopy with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope was performed on unstimulated cells ( to confirm the absence of background cell movement ) and then continued on the identical cells stim - ulated with bradykinin ( 250ngml - 1 ; Sigma ) , PDGF ( 100ngml - 1 ; Sigma ) or fetal calf serum ( 15 % , Atlanta ) for various durations . Approximately 150 filopodia from 50 – 100 WT and N / N ES - FLCs were observed under each condition . Microinjections were performed with His - tagged Cdc42L61 ( Cytoskeleton ; 200 m gml - 1 in PBS with 7mgml - 1 dextran blue as a marker ) and in some experiments RacN17 fused to glutathione S - transferase was added ( 1mgml - 1 ; Cytoskeleton ) with an Eppendorf Tranjector 5246 and Eppendorf Injectman at 60Pa for 0 . 2s . In these experiments , cells were incubated in serum - free medium at 37 (cid:176) C for 16h , injected as above , and returned to the incubator for an addi - tional 20min before fixation and staining . Microinjected cells were determined by analysing staining with dextran blue . Photomicrographs were scored for cells containing filopodia ; a cell was considered positive for filopodia if the cell contained finger - like membrane protrusions at sites of increased corti - cal actin . The investigator ( F . T . ) scoring photomicrographs was blinded to cell genotype . Bacteria and viral strains . The wild - type Shigella flexneri 2457T and the wild - type Listeria monocytogenes 10403S strains were used for cellular infection and plaque assays . Vaccinia virus was provided by Dr Ramnik Xavier . Cellular infection assay . FLCs were inoculated and grown overnight on coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS . Cells were overlaid with the bacterial suspension ( S . flexneri at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 60 or L . monocytogenes at a MOI of 100 ) . To promote contact of bacteria with cells , the samples were cen - trifuged for 10min at 2000 g at 23 (cid:176) C . The cells were then incubated for 1h at 37 (cid:176) C and washed five times . To kill extracellular bacteria , the infected cells were subsequently incubated at 37 (cid:176) C with fresh medium supplemented with gentamicin ( 50 m gml - 1 ) ( 45min for S . flexneri ; 2h for L . monocytogenes ) . For vaccinia virus invasions , cells were infected for 8h without gentamicin . After five washes , cells were fixed for 10min with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde . For GFP fusion protein expression , pEGFP constructs were transfected into fibroblasts 16h before infection with LipofectAMINE ( Gibco ) . To determine the efficiency of tail formation for cells infected with Shigella and with vaccinia , the actin cytoskeleton of 100 bacterially infected cells and 100 virally infected cells ( both determined by staining with DAPI ) were examined in three independent experiments by immunofluorescence . To confirm that bacteria were located intracellularly rather than being adherent to the exterior of cells , the numbers of intracel - lular bacteria were determined at 90min of infection by phagocytosis assay 47 . Statistical differences were determined by Mann – Whitney test . Immunofluorescence microscopy . The fixed cells were permeabilized for 20min with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , then washed five times with 1 % BSA in PBS . Enveloped vaccinia virions were detected by incubating with an anti - A33R rabbit polyclonal antibody ( provided by Dr Michael Way 48 ) for 1h at 23 (cid:176) C . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with anti - rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( 1 : 160 dilution ; Sigma ) . F - actin was stained with rhodamine - labelled or FITC - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 m g ml - 1 in PBS with 1 % BSA ; Molecular Probes ) for 20min at room temperature . To identify bacterium - infected or virus - infected cells , permeabilized cells were incubated with DAPI ( 300nM ; Molecular Probes ) for 3min at 23 (cid:176) C . Standard fluorescent microscopy and confocal microscopy were performed with an Olympus AX - 70 upright fluorescent microscope and a Leica TCS - NT2 confocal microscope , respectively . Plaque assay . Plaque assays were performed as described previously 49 . In brief , FLCs were grown to confluence in 35 - mm dishes , diluted bacteria were added to the monolayer ( MOI 5 · 10 - 3 ) and the samples were cen - trifuged for 10min at 2000 g at 23 (cid:176) C . The cells were then incubated for 45min at 37 (cid:176) C and subse - quently an agarose overlay ( DMEM , 5 % FCS , 20 m gml - 1 gentamicin , 0 . 5 % agarose ) was added to each plate . The plates were incubated at 37 (cid:176) C and examined after 24 or 48h . Biochemical assays . F - actin content . N - WASP + / + and N - WASP - / - cells were grown in 10 - cm - diameter plastic Petri dishes to high densities but not to confluence . Cells were serum - starved overnight and then restored to serum . Triplicate plates were fixed for 1h at 23 (cid:176) C with 4 % formaldehyde at 0 , 5 and 10min after stimulation with serum . Cells were then lysed with a 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 solution containing 2 m M rhodamine - isothiocyanate – phalloidin for 1h and washed twice with PBS to remove unbound phalloidin ; the liq - uid phase was removed and the cells were left to dry in air . Dry cells were extracted with 2ml of methanol ; the methanol was removed and centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10min . The fluorescence of the solution was then determined with excitation at 540nm and emission at 560nm in a fluorimeter . The F - actin content of the cells at zero time was taken as 1 ; the contents at 5 and 10min are expressed rela - tive that at the zero time . Barbed - end nuclei . For these experiments the FLCs were left to adhere to the sides of small glass test tubes ( 6mm · 50mm ) and grew to densities similar to those of the cells on the plastic Petri dishes . Cells were starved overnight for all experiments . At the beginning of the experiment , cells were exposed to 100nM PDGF for 0 , 5 and 10min . At various times the medium was removed and replaced with 285 m l of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 10mM Pipes , 2 . 5mM Hepes , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM ATP , 0 . 5mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and 100mM KCl , pH7 . 5 . Pyrene actin was added to a final concentration of 1 m M and the evolution of fluorescence was followed with excitation at 366 nm and emission at 386nm . The assay was repeated for each condition in the presence of 2 m M cytochalasin B , and the rate of barbed - end actin - filament assembly was calculated 50 .

N - WASP + / + ( WT ) SV - FLCs were infected with either Shigella ( upper row ) or vaccinia ( lower row ) and sites of actin assembly ( asterisks ) determined by visualization of actin tails with rhodamine – phalloidin . Nck co - localization ( left panel , yellow – green staining ) was determined by immunostaining with an anti - Nck monoclonal antibody . WIP co - localization ( right panel , yellow – green staining ) was identified in infected cells that were transfected with WIP – GFP . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd supplementary infomation NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 OCTOBER 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 2 DAPI DAPI DAPI DAPI NCK NCK WIP WIP Shigella vaccinia N / N N / N N / N N / N N / N N / N N / N N / N Figure S2 Neither Nck nor WIP is recruited to Shigella and vaccinia in the absence of N - WASP .
