ONCOLOGY REPORTS 35 : 3084 - 3093 , 2016 3084 Abstract . Numerous studies on the biological mechanism of breast cancer have identified a number of potential therapeutic molecular targets . In this context , one type of potential candi - dates appears to be agents that target the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cells or regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics . The aim of the present study was to study the impact of altered actin transport between the cytoplasm and nucleus by the down - regulation of importin - 9 ( IPO9 ) in breast adenocarcinoma MCF - 7 cells exposed to an apoptosis - inducing combination of garlic - derived S - allyl - L - cysteine sulfoxide ( alliin ) and pacli - taxel ( PTX ) . The expression of IPO9 was downregulated by the transfection of non - aggressive breast cancer MCF - 7 cells with siRNA against IPO9 . The altered expression of IPO9 and cofilin - 1 ( CFL1 ) was examined using western blotting . Moreover , the effect of the downregulation of IPO9 on cell death induced by the combination of PTX and alliin was also investigated . The alterations of IPO9 and CFL1 levels were also related with F - actin organizational changes and F - actin fluorescence intensity in the nuclear / perinuclear area of the cells . The results presented here indicate that alliin and PTX act synergistically to promote and potentiate apoptosis in MCF - 7 cells . Furthermore , using RNA interference tech - nique , we showed that downregulation of IPO9 expression was correlated with a significant reduction in the apoptotic cell population as well as with a decrease in F - actin content in whole cells , and in the cortical and nuclear / perinuclear areas of the cells . Simultaneously , the downregulation of IPO9 was also accompanied by the increased post - translational expres - sion of CFL1 . Furthermore , the data obtained in the present study allow us to conclude that CFL1 itself does not translo - cate actin into the cell nucleus but this transport requires the functional expression of IPO9 . Introduction Thousands of women worldwide from all walks of life are diagnosed every day with breast cancer . It is by far the most common cancer among females worldwide and it is also the leading cause of cancer - related mortality ( 1 ) . Breast cancer is no longer viewed as a single disease since it is heterogeneous consisting of a multitude of subgroups at the molecular , histo - pathological and clinical level with different prognostic and therapeutic implications . The understanding of the biological mechanisms of breast cancer have elucidated a number of potential therapeutic molecular targets ( 2 ) . In recent years , specific drugs which modulate these targets in a way that interferes with their ability to promote cancer cell growth or invasion of carcinoma cells have become a part of the standard care of patients with breast cancer ( anti - HER2 agents , e . g . trastuzumab and lapatinib ) . Numerous other agents have not been approved for clinical practice , yet their potential utility is currently under extensive investigation ( 3 - 5 ) . In this context , one of the potential candidates appears to be agents that target the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cells or regulate actin cyto - skeleton dynamics ( 6 , 7 ) . Numerous studies have indicated that F - actin participates in the induction of cell death and apoptosis . It is known that both cytoplasmic and nuclear actin pools and their proper balance are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis ( 8 ) . Translocation of actin between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is not well understood , since this protein does not have a classical nuclear localization signal ( 9 ) . The transport of actin is possible in association with actin - binding proteins which contain a functional nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) . Moreover , it has been shown that the export of actin is mediated Downregulation of importin - 9 protects MCF - 7 cells against apoptosis induced by the combination of garlic - derived alliin and paclitaxel MAgdALENA IzdEBSkA 1 * , dARIuSz gRzANkA 2 * , MACIEj gAgAT 1 , MARTA HAłAS - WIśNIEWSkA 1 and ALINA gRzANkA 1 1 department of Histology and Embryology , and 2 department and Clinic of dermatology , Sexually Transmitted diseases and Immunodermatology , Nicolaus Copernicus university in Toruń , Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz , Faculty of Medicine , 85 - 092 Bydgoszcz , Poland Received November 23 , 2015 ; Accepted january 11 , 2016 dOI : 10 . 3892 / or . 2016 . 4628 Correspondence to : dr Maciej gagat , department of Histology and Embryology , Nicolaus Copernicus university in Toruń , Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz , Faculty of Medicine , karłowicza 24 , 85 - 092 Bydgoszcz , Poland E - mail : mgagat @ cm . umk . pl * Contributed equally Key words : MCF - 7 cells , F - actin , importin - 9 , cofilin - 1 , siRNA , RNAi , paclitaxel , alliin , cell death IzdEBSkA et al : IMPORTIN - 9 IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE INduCTION OF APOPTOSIS IN MCF - 7 CELLS 3085 by exportin 6 ( XPO6 ) and imported by importin - 9 ( IPO9 ) . IPO9 was identified in 2012 by dopie et al ( 10 ) as the nuclear import factor for actin . using RNA interference ( RNAi ) technique they demonstrated that the level of nuclear actin could be regulated by altering the ratio of protein to promote both export and import of actin . They also suggested that this area of study requires further elucidation ( 10 ) . It has also been shown that cofilin ( CFL ) participates in the transport of actin between the cytoplasm and the nucleus . CFL belongs to the actin - binding protein group and promotes the depolymerization of actin filaments ( 11 - 13 ) . Three AdF / CFL isoforms , which fulfill a specific function in actin filament reorganization and possess NLS have been identified in mammalian cells ( 11 , 14 ) . Although CFL participates in the active transport of actin to the nucleus under physiological conditions , the mechanism is still unclear ( 13 ) . Naturally occurring compounds , particularly those from dietary sources , have recently gained increased scientific atten - tion as potential anticancer drugs and , in particular , as a partner for conventional cytostatic drugs . Garlic , Allium sativum L . is a member of the Alliaceae family , which may have anticarcino - genic effects inter alia by the inhibition of growth and invasive potential of cancer cells and induction of apoptosis ( 15 - 18 ) . Such antitumor actions of this vegetable have been attributed to the presence of organosulfur compounds , among which the most abundant in intact garlic is S - allyl - L - cysteine sulfoxide ( alliin ) ( 19 ) . Once garlic is processed by cutting or crushing , alliin is rapidly converted to allicin and further into hundreds of di - , tri - , and polysulfides ( 20 ) . Importantly , it has been shown that some of these metabolites retain anticancer activity comparable to the parent compound or even may be more toxic toward tumor cells ( 18 , 19 ) . Paclitaxel ( PTX ) is one of the most widely used and effec - tive anticancer agents derived from natural sources ( 21 ) . Its anticancer activity is associated with binding to tubulin and stabilization of microtubules , resulting in the inhibition of cell division . Additionally , this cytostatic drug induces apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway and inhibits the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein B - cell leukemia 2 ( Bcl - 2 ) ( 22 ) . In the present study , the apoptosis in MCF - 7 cells was induced by PTX and enhanced by the combined treatment with PTX and garlic - derived alliin . The aim of present study was to study the impact of the altered actin transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus by the downregulation of IPO9 in breast adenocarcinoma MCF - 7 cells exposed to an apoptosis - inducing combination of PTX and garlic - derived alliin . In the present study , we also investigated whether IPO9 influences the post - translational expression of cofilin - 1 ( CFL1 ) and confirmed that CFL1 itself does not influence the nuclear F - actin function in the process of apoptosis . Materials and methods Cell culture and treatment . MCF - 7 , a human breast adeno - carcinoma cell line , was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ; Manassas , VA , uSA ) . The cells were grown in tissue culture flasks or 12 - well plates ( Bd Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , Nj , uSA ) and cultured as a monolayer in Eagle ' s Minimum Essential Medium ( MEM ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , uSA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; gibco / Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , uSA ) and 50 µg / ml gentamycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The MCF - 7 cultures were maintained in 5 % CO 2 at 37˚C . MCF - 7 cells were treated with 10 µM alliin , 0 . 1 or 1 µM PTX ( both from Sigma - Aldrich ) and the combination of these agents ( 10 µM alliin / 0 . 1 µM PTX or 10 µM alliin / 1 µM PTX ) for 24 h . The control cells were cultured under the same condi - tions but without exposure to these agents . Transfection by nucleofection . For the nucleofection of MCF - 7 cells , the cells were grown to 80 - 90 % confluency in MEM with FBS , and 50 µg / ml gentamycin . Following trypsiniza - tion , the cells ( 1x10 6 ) were transfected using the SE Cell Line 4d - Nucleofector™ X kit and 3 pmol siRNA against human IPO9 ( Hs _ IPO9 _ 7 ; Qiagen , Hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions and as previously described ( 23 ) . For determining the unspecific effects of siRNA transfection , the non - targeting AllStars negative control siRNA ( Qiagen ) was used . At 72 h post transfection , the cells were used for the subsequent experiments . Western blot analysis . Semi - quantitative analysis of the post - translational expression of IPO9 and CFL1 was performed using western blot analysis . The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Following normalization of the protein concentration using the BCA protein assay kit ( Thermo Scientific Pierce Rockford , IL , uSA ) , equal amounts of protein ( 15 µg of total protein per lane ) were separated using 4 - 12 % NuPAgE Bis - Tris gel ( Novex / Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , uSA ) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot dry western blotting system ( Invitrogen / Life Technologies ) . To determine the position of the protein bands , pre - stained molecular weight markers ( Novex / Life Technologies ) were used . Next , the membrane was processed using WesternBreeze ® chromogenic western blot immunodetection kit by the BenchPro™ 4100 Card Processing Station ( both from Invitrogen / Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . After that , the membranes were blocked with WesternBreeze ® blocking solution for 30 min . The next step was incubation with the primary rabbit monoclonal anti - importin - 9 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam , Cambridge , MA , uSA ) , rabbit anti - cofilin - 1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) or rabbit polyclonal anti - gAdPH ( 1 : 2 , 000 ; both from Sigma - Aldrich ) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature ( RT ) and the membrane washing . After that , membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with a ready - to - use solution of alkaline phosphatase - conjugated anti - species Igg . The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a ready - to - use solution of BCIP / NBT substrate for alkaline phosphatase . After scanning , the densitometry of the bands was quantified using Quantity One Basic software ( ver . 3 . 6 . 5 ; Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , uSA ) . Cell death analysis . The analysis of cell death was carried out using a Tali ® image - based cytometer and Tali ® apoptosis kit ( both from Invitrogen / Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions and as previously described ( 23 ) . The analysis was performed using Tali ® image - based cytometer and FCS Express Research Edition software ( v . 4 . 03 ; de Novo Software , glendale , CA , uSA ) on the condition that early ONCOLOGY REPORTS 35 : 3084 - 3093 , 2016 3086 apoptotic cells stain with only Annexin V - Alexa Fluor 488 , late apoptotic cells stain with both propidium iodide ( PI ) and green Annexin V - Alexa Fluor 488 , necrotic cells stain with PI , and live cells remain unstained . Fluorescence staining of F - actin . MCF - 7 cells transfected with siRNA - IPO9 and non - targeting AllStars negative control siRNA were seeded on sterile glass coverslips placed in 12 - well plates ( Bd Biosciences ) . After 24 h , PTX ( at concentrations of 0 . 1 and 1 µM ) or 10 µM alliin were added to the cells for the indicated times as either single or combined agents . Next , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT and stained with phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1 : 40 , Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , uSA ) as previously described ( 24 ) . Nuclear staining was performed with 4 ' , 6 ' - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( dAPI ) ( 100 ng / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min . The cells were exam - ined using an Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Cdd camera ( dS - 5Mc - u1 ) and NIS - Elements 3 . 30 image analysis system ( all from Nikon , Tokyo , japan ) . Measurement of F - actin fluorescence intensity . The measure - ment of fluorescence intensity of F - actin in MCF - 7 cells was performed on fluorescent images captured at equal camera settings using Imagej 1 . 45s ( NIH , Bethesda , Md , uSA ) . Corrected fluorescence intensity ( CFI ) of total , cortical or nuclear / perinuclear F - actin was calculated using the following formula : CFI = integrated density - ( region of interest x mean fluorescence of background ) , where integrated density was the area region of interest multiplied by the mean fluorescence intensity of F - actin . Statistical analysis . Statistical analyses were performed by paired t - test using graphPad Prism 5 . 0 ( graphPad Software , La jolla , CA , uSA ) . The results were considered as significant at P < 0 . 05 . The data are presented as mean ± Sd . Results Analysis of post - translational downregulation of importin - 9 expression and the associated alteration in cofilin - 1 expres - sion . Western blot analysis confirmed that siRNA - IPO9 mediated the downregulation of IPO9 post - translational expression , as compared with that in the untransfected cells or cells transfected with the non - targeting siRNA ( Fig . 1A ) . densitometric analysis also confirmed the decrease in initial IPO9 post - translational expression in the cells transfected with siRNA - IPO9 . Furthermore , no statistically significant differ - ences were observed in the relative IPO9 to gAPdH band intensities between the untransfected cells and cells transfected Figure 1 .

( C ) densitometric analysis of CLF1 reactive bands in the untransfected MCF - 7 cells , cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA and siRNA against IPO9 , relative to gAdPH . IzdEBSkA et al : IMPORTIN - 9 IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE INduCTION OF APOPTOSIS IN MCF - 7 CELLS 3087 with non - targeting siRNA ( Fig . 1B ) . As shown in Fig . 1B , the transfection of the MCF - 7 cells with siRNA - IPO9 induced a statistically significant reduction in IPO9 ( 23 . 10 and 18 . 91 % of initial expression , as compared to untransfected cells and cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA , respectively ) as normalized to gAPdH post - translational expression . Western blot analysis indicated that siRNA - mediated downregulation of IPO9 increased the post - translational expression of CFL1 ( Fig . 1A ) . Moreover , densitometric analysis also confirmed the increase of the initial CFL1 post - translational expression in the cells transfected with siRNA - IPO9 . Furthermore , no statistically significant differ - ences were observed in CFL1 band intensities between the untransfected cells and cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA relative to gAdPH ( Fig . 1C ) . As shown in Fig . 1C , the transfection of MCF - 7 cells with siRNA - IPO9 resulted in a statistically significant increase in the post - translational expression of CFL - 1 ( 122 . 31 and 116 . 59 % of the initial expression , as compared to the untransfected cells and the cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA , respectively ) as normalized to gAPdH . Downregulation of importin - 9 induces alterations in cofilin - 1 protein levels and F - actin organization in the MCF - 7 cells . Western blot analysis showed that the downregulation of IPO9 using siRNA - IPO9 induced alterations in the post - translational CFL1 expression , even following the treatment of MCF - 7 cells with alliin and PTX ( Fig . 2A ) . The densitometric analysis also confirmed the increase of CFL1 post - translational expres - sion in the cells transfected with siRNA - IPO9 , as compared to the cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA ( Fig . 2B ) . As depicted in Fig . 2B , the downregulation of IPO9 in the control cells resulted in the increased CFL1 post - translational expression by 1 . 17 - fold ( P = 0 . 0290 ) , when calculated relatively to gAPdH protein levels , respectively . In the cell populations with downregulated IPO9 and incubated with 10 µM alliin , the post - translational CFL1 level was elevated by 1 . 63 - fold ( P = 0 . 0032 ) . The cells transfected with siRNA - IPO9 and treated with 0 . 1 µM PTX were characterized by a similar increase in the CFL1 protein level ( 1 . 63 - fold ; P = 0 . 0040 ) . The most elevated CFL1 level was observed after the treatment of the IPO9 downregulated MCF - 7 cells with 1 µM PTX ( 2 . 41 - fold ; P = 0 . 0014 ) . Furthermore , after exposure of these cells to the combination of 10 µM alliin and 0 . 1 µM PTX , the CFL1 protein level was increased by 1 . 34 - fold ( P = 0 . 0149 ) . After the treatment of the IPO9 - downregulated MCF - 7 cells with the combination of 10 µM alliin and 1 µM PTX , a 1 . 63 - fold ( P = 0 . 0049 ) increase in CFL1 protein content was observed . Fluorescence labeling of F - actin showed that the down - regulation of IPO9 using siRNA - IPO9 induced organizational changes in F - actin in the MCF - 7 cells , as compared to the cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA .

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 35 : 3084 - 3093 , 2016 3088 transfected with non - targeting siRNA and the cells treated with 10 µM alliin , a voluminous network of tension fibers of actin was observed ( Fig . 3A and B ) . In contrast , the treatment of these cells with 0 . 1 µM PTX resulted in the disorganiza - tion of F - actin , which was observed as a diffused fluorescence signal in both the cortical and nuclear / perinuclear areas of the cells ( Fig . 3C ) . Furthermore , after exposure of the cells to 1 µM PTX as well as to the combination of 10 µM alliin with 0 . 1 µM or 1 µM PTX , the nuclear / perinuclear F - actin cytoskel - eton was clearly seen as disassembled or in the form of short fibers ( Fig . 3d - F ) . However , the fluorescence labeling of these organizational forms of actin was much higher , as compared to the control cells and the cells treated with 10 µM alliin or 0 . 1 µM PTX . Similar to the cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA , after the induction of IPO9 downregulation , the F - actin of the control cells was also organized in the form of tension fibers ( Fig . 3g ) . However , the downregulation of IPO9 was accompanied by increased cortical actin staining . Furthermore , the treatment of siRNA - IPO9 - transfected MCF - 7 cells with 10 µM alliin or 0 . 1 µM PTX did not reveal any significant differences in F - actin organization , as compared to cells transfected with the non - targeting siRNA ( Fig . 3H and I ) . In contrast , treatment of these cells with 1 µM PTX or the combi - nation of 10 µM alliin with 0 . 1 µM or 1 µM PTX resulted in a gradual disassembly of both the cortical and nuclear / peri - nuclear F - actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 3j - L ) . Downregulation of importin - 9 reduces the apoptotic response of MCF - 7 cells to PTX and alliin which is correlated with disassembly of nuclear / perinuclear F - actin cytoskeleton . The quantitative analysis of cell death was performed using Tali Image - based cytometer after Annexin V - Alexa Fluor 488 and PI double staining . As shown in Fig . 4A and Table I , after the treatment of the MCF - 7 cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA with 10 µM alliin or 0 . 1 µM PTX , no statistically Figure 3 .

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 35 : 3084 - 3093 , 2016 3090 differences in the percentages of Annexin V - positive cells were noted , as compared to the control . As shown in Fig . 4B and Table II , a decrease in the Annexin V - positive cell percentages after the treatment with 10 µM alliin or 0 . 1 µM PTX by 3 . 84 - fold ( P < 0 . 0001 ) or 2 . 71 - fold ( P = 0 . 0002 ) , respectively , was noted . Similar , exposure of the cells with downregulated IPO9 to 1 µM PTX resulted in a 2 . 18 - fold ( P = 0 . 0067 ) reduction in Annexin V - positive cells . The treatment of these cells with the combination of 10 µM alliin and 0 . 1 µM PTX decreased the population of Annexin V - positive cells by 2 . 36 - fold ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . However , a 1 . 34 - fold ( P = 0 . 0389 ) increase in the percentage of Annexin V - positive cells was observed after treatment of the IPO9 - downregulated cells with the combination of 10 µM alliin and 1 µM PTX ( Fig . 4B ) . Moreover , comparison of the percentages of Annexin V - positive cells transfected with non - targeting siRNA and siRNA - IPO9 showed a statistically significant reduction in apoptosis after downregulation of IPO9 and the treatment of the cells with alliin , PTX or combination of these agents . As shown in Fig . 4C , the silencing of IPO9 decreased the percentage of Annexin V - positive cells after treatment with 10 µM alliin ( 2 . 30 - fold , P = 0 . 0300 ) , 0 . 1 µM PTX ( 2 . 66 - fold , P = 0 . 0071 ) , 1 µM PTX ( 6 . 61 - fold , P = 0 . 0002 ) , and after exposure of MCF - 7 cells to the combination of 10 µM alliin and 0 . 1 or 1 µM PTX ( 6 . 41 - fold , P = 0 . 0006 ; or 3 . 03 - fold , P = 0 . 0013 ) , as compared to the cells expressing IPO9 . Furthermore , a > 8 % reduction in Annexin V - positive cells was correlated with a decrease in F - actin content measured in whole cells , as well as in the cortical and nuclear / perinuclear area of cells . This , was clearly noted after the treatment of cells with 1 µM PTX ( reduction of 4 . 69 - fold , P = 0 . 0392 ; 5 . 35 - fold , P = 0 . 0368 ; and 1 . 91 - fold , P = 0 . 0337 , respectively ) , the combination of 10 µM alliin and 0 . 1 PTX ( reduction of 16 . 02 - fold ; 20 . 46 - fold ; and 4 . 82 - fold , P = 0 . 0179 , respectively ) or the combination of 10 µM alliin and 1 µM PTX ( reduction of 3 . 89 - fold , 2 . 61 - fold and 7 . 71 - fold , P = 0 . 0286 , respectively ) ( Fig . 5A - C ) . The data presented here suggest that the altered import of F - actin into the nucleus prevents apoptotic cell death . Discussion Many authors have shown that the human breast adenocarci - noma MCF - 7 cell line may be useful for in vitro breast cancer research ( 24 - 26 ) . It is known that breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among females worldwide and its treatment is difficult ( 1 ) . Therefore , new therapeutic strategies , including the targeted silencing of gene expression using e . g . RNAi technique have recently been developed to induce apop - tosis directly or inhibit intracellular pro - survival signaling pathways and angiogenesis as well ( 27 ) . The list of promising targeted agents against breast cancer includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TkIs ) , inhibitors of the PI3k / AkT / mTOR pathway and agents that interfere with dNA repair ( 28 ) . Furthermore , Foerster et al ( 6 ) suggested that the actin cytoskeleton can be used as a target for breast cancer therapy . The actin cyto - skeleton is a structure regulated by many proteins , including actin binding proteins , Rho gTPases , kinase C - ε , which offer unlimited potential for the development of anticancer treat - ment strategies ( 6 , 29 , 30 ) . Research has shown that natural dietary agents , either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents , have the potential to prevent the occurrence and / or spread of cancer ( 31 - 33 ) . The mechanisms leading to the induction of apoptosis by garlic derivatives have been described in a number of cancer cell lines , including the MCF - 7 human breast cancer cell line ( 15 , 34 ) . Moreover , the potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of traditional cytostatic drugs by sulfur - containing compounds of garlic has also been documented in vitro ( 35 ) . In the present study , we used alliin to enhance the apoptotic effect of PTX . The study verified the alliin - mediated potentia - tion of apoptosis induced by PTX . The results presented in the present study support the potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of traditional cytostatic drugs by sulfur - containing compounds of garlic and indicate that alliin and PTX act synergistically to promote apoptosis in MCF - 7 cells . A large body of literature has shown the nuclear localiza - tion of actin ( 10 , 23 , 36 - 38 ) . In the nucleus , actin is involved indirectly in transcription , since it is associated with all three RNA polymerases ( Pol I , II and III ) ( 39 , 40 ) . Percipalle et al ( 41 ) found that through the interaction with RNA polymerase II nuclear actin is involved in transcription processes of Balbiani rings . Actin has also been described as a component of the BAF complex and ATP - dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWR1 ( 42 - 45 ) . Furthermore , Cisterna et al ( 46 ) postulated that actin can also be located in nucleoli where it participates in the transport of small ribosomal subunits to the cytoplasm .

In addition , finally , we are interested in whether such a manipulation may be employed as a novel approach for the treatment of cancers , in particular , those that are currently incurable . Our previous studies demonstrated not only the translocation of actin into the nucleus but also the involvement of nuclear F - actin in chromatin remodeling during death processes of different cell lines ( 23 , 38 ) . Hofmann et al ( 9 ) suggested that nuclear actin may be translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus , but it does not have a classical nuclear localization signal itself . However , the transport of actin is possible by Figure 5 .

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 35 : 3084 - 3093 , 2016 3092 its association with actin - binding proteins which contain a functional NLS ( 13 ) . As it has been shown , the export of actin is mediated by XPO6 and the import by IPO9 . However , the mechanisms of actin translocation between the cytoplasm and nucleus require further investigation . In the present study , we showed that the downregulation of IPO9 using siRNA - IPO9 induced alterations in post - translational CFL1 expression , even after the treatment of MCF - 7 cells with the combination of alliin and PTX . Pendleton et al ( 48 ) showed that during stress conditions actin is transported into the nucleus in a complex with actin - binding proteins such as CFL which contains the NLS . In contrast , the involvement of CFL in actin transport under physiological conditions is not clear . Huet et al ( 49 ) revealed that IPO9 interacted both with actin and CFL in a co - immunoprecipitation experiment , and hypothesized that actin enters into the nucleus in a complex with IPO9 and CFL . In the present study to ascertain whether downregulation of IPO9 induces alterations in the post - translational expression of NLS - containing proteins , the post - translational level of CFL1 was investigated . In the present study , we confirmed that downregulation of IPO9 increased the post - translational expression of CFL1 . Our previous studies showed that CFL1 mediates apoptosis in response to stress conditions ( 50 ) . Similarly , Huot et al ( 51 ) observed actin at the border of the apoptotic blebs whereas Levee et al ( 52 ) revealed its accumulation in the area of apop - totic body formation and suggested that the reorganization of the F - actin network is essential for this process . Furthermore , Chua et al ( 53 ) demonstrated that CFL has an important function during the initial phase of apoptosis . Moreover , oxidant - induced apoptosis and mitochondrial integrity can be regulated through oxidation of CFL ( 54 ) . We also demon - strated that doxorubicin treatment of CHO AA8 cells with the functional expression of CFL1 induced both apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe as the main types of cell death . In contrast , the downregulation of CFL1 preferentially induced mitotic catastrophe as doxorubicin - induced cell death ( 50 ) . We also showed that the presence of actin is important for induction of active cell death ( 23 ) . Furthermore , we observed an increase in nuclear F - actin labeling after the induction of CFL1 expres - sion in MCF - 7 cells . Vartiainen ( 13 ) suggested that such an effect was possibly associated with the involvement of CFL1 in the transport of actin monomers to the cell nucleus and their reassembly into short polymers . In the present study , we showed a significant reduction in both cortical and nuclear F - actin fluorescence in cells with downregulated expression of IPO9 after treatment of cells with a high dose of PTX as well as the combination of PTX and alliin . Similarly , the downregulation of IPO9 resulted in significant reduction in apoptosis induced by PTX , allin or a high apoptosis - inducing combination of PTX and alliin . These data suggest that CFL1 itself does not translocate actin into the cell nucleus but this transport requires the functional expression of IPO9 . In conclusion , the results presented here showed that alliin and PTX act synergistically to promote apoptosis in MCF - 7 cells and support the potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of traditional cytostatic drugs by sulfur - containing compounds of garlic . As it has been shown by many authors , actin may translocate into the cell nucleus to function as a transcriptional modulator of gene expression ( 47 , 55 - 58 ) . Our previous studies demonstrated not only the translocation of F - actin into the nucleus but also its involvement in chromatin remodeling during cell death processes ( 23 , 38 , 50 , 59 , 60 ) . In the present study , we revealed that the downregulation of IPO9 correlates with the significant reduction in the apoptotic cell population as well as with the decrease in F - actin content in whole cells , and in cortical and nuclear / perinuclear areas of MCF - 7 cells . Simultaneously , the downregulation of IPO9 was also accom - panied by the increased post - translational expression of CFL1 . Therefore , the obtained data suggest that CFL1 itself does not translocate actin into the cell nucleus but this transport requires the functional expression of IPO9 .
