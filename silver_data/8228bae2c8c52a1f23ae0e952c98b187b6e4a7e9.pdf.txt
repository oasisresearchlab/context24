All rights reserved 2 A bstract : Existing studies on the mechanism of cell volume regulation are mainly relevant to ion channels and osmosis in extracellular fluid . Recently , accumulating evidence has shown that cellular mechanical microenvironment also influences the cell volume . Herein , we investigated the regulation of substrate stiffness on the cell volume homeostasis of MCF - 7 cells and their following migration behaviors . We found that cell volume increases with increasing substrate stiffness , which could be affected by blocking the cell membrane anion permeability and dopamine receptor . In addition , the cell migration is significantly inhibited by decreasing the cell volume using tamoxifen and such inhibition effect on migration is enhanced by increasing substrate stiffness . The cell membrane anion permeability might be the linker between cellular mechanical microenvironment and cellular volume homeostasis regulation . This work revealed the regulation of substrate stiffness on cell volume homeostasis for the first time , which would provide a new perspective into the understanding of cancer metastasis and a promising anti - cancer therapy through regulation of cell volume homeostasis .

All rights reserved 3 Introduction Cells in vivo exist with a fixed range of volume ( Amodeo and Skotheim , 2016 ; Ginzberg et al . , 2015 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2014 ) , which plays critical roles in many fundamental cell behaviors and functions , including cell mitosis ( Bates , 2015 ; Kiyomitsu , 2015 ; Tzur et al . , 2009 ) , migration ( Bates , 2015 ; Stroka et al . , 2014 ) , differentiation ( Adapala et al . , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Pathak et al . , 2014 ) and apoptosis ( Lang and Hoffmann , 2013 ) . For instance , the growth rate of cells is size - dependent for suspension cells in the whole cell cycle , where cells with larger volume are observed to have higher growth rate ( Tzur et al . , 2009 ) . The migration of neutrophil is accompanied by cell swelling and the rapid initial intracellular acidification , and the inhibition of ion movement across the cell membrane suppresses the increase of cell volume , further precluding the migration of neutrophil ( Ritter et al . , 1998 ) . Besides , the disturbance of cell volume presents to be associated with several diseases , such as cardiovascular disease ( Yamamoto et al . , 2011 ) , neurological disease ( Kahle et al . , 2015 ; Prager - Khoutorsky et al . , 2014 ) , cancer ( Arcangeli and Becchetti , 2015 ; Bates , 2015 ; Pedersen et al . , 2013 ) , diabetes ( Ginzberg et al . , 2015 ) and ischemic stroke ( Song and Yu , 2014 ) . For example , the volume of tumor cell is related to the multidrug resistance of cancers , e . g . , disordered or altered cell volume regulation is associated with cisplatin - induced apoptosis ( Doyle et al . , 1998 ; Hoffmann and Lambert , 2014 ) . Therefore , it is of great importance to understand the mechanism of cell volume regulation . Cells maintain their volume homeostasis by unevenly distributing inorganic ions to compensate the excessive cell swelling caused by the accumulating organic substances ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Lang , 2007 ) . For understanding the mechanism and regulation of cell volume homeostasis , significant efforts have been put on studying the effects of ion channels and osmosis in the extracellular fluid on cell volume ( Ding et al . , 2014 ; Fedan et al . , 2013 ; Fernandez et al . , 2013 ; Hoffmann and Pedersen , 2011 ) . For instance , the volume - sensitive Cl - channel has been found to This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 4 play an important role in both cell volume regulation ( Lee et al . , 2007 ; Shimizu , 2010 ) and cisplatin resistance of human cancer cells . In addition , accumulating evidence has shown some other influence factors on cell volume ( Bush et al . , 2005 ; Greiner et al . , 2015 ; Marino and La Spada , 2007 ; Turunen et al . , 2013 ) . For instance , the volume of chondrocytes reduces up to 30 % under compressive force loading ( Bush et al . , 2005 ) . Both osmotic stress and force loading cause stress on cell membrane , which may lead to the opening of ion channels and further regulate the cell volume ( Kobayashi and Sokabe , 2010 ) . In addition , the stiffness of extracellular matrices ( ECM ) is also regarded to be an effector for the change of stress on cell membrane ( Kobayashi and Sokabe , 2010 ) . Considering that the ECM stiffness and the cell volume regulation are both the important regulators on cellular physiology processes ( Paluch and Discher , 2015 ; Rehfeldt et al . , 2007 ; Stroka and Aranda - Espinoza , 2010 ) , it is worthy to investigate the relationship between ECM stiffness and cell volume regulation . Moreover , for cancer cells , previous studies have demonstrated that the link exists among cellular processes ( e . g . , migration of cancer cells ) , stiffness of cell culture substrate and cell volume ( Discher et al . , 2005 ; Dubois and Rouzaire - Dubois , 2012 ; Stroka et al . , 2014 ; Trappmann and Chen , 2013 ) . For instance , cancer cells normally move through ECM by modulating their volume and shape , and disturbance of cancer cell volume ( e . g . , by some pharmacological agents ) could impede the migration and invasion of cancer cells ( Dubois and Rouzaire - Dubois , 2012 ; Jakab and Ritter , 2006 ) . Besides , some volume - regulatory ion transporters and channels have been proved to be involved in the cell migration process ( Schwab , 2001 ) . Meanwhile , migration of cancer cells is highly dependent on the substrate stiffness transduced by integrin , which induces the dynamic change of cytoskeleton ( Charras and Sahai , 2014 ; Ni and Chiang , 2007 ; Schachtner et al . , 2013 ) . Since integrin and cytoskeleton have a synergic effect on cell volume regulation ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; McCloskey et al . , 2007 ; Schliess et al . , 2004 ) , it is reasonable to hypothesize that regulation of cell volume may play an important role in the stiffness - dependent cellular processes ( e . g . , migration ) ( Schwab , 2001 ) . However , it remains elusive how the substrate stiffness This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 5 regulates the cell volume . In this work , we selected MCF - 7 cells as the cell model , and prepared polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels with tunable stiffness as the cell culture substrate . The impact of substrate stiffness on the volume of MCF - 7 cells was studied through comparing the volumes of MCF - 7 cells cultured on PA gel and glass substrate using laser scanning reflection microscopy ( LSRM ) . Through adding some inhibitors into the culture system , the effects of cell membrane anion permeability , dopamine receptor and an anti - breast cancer drug Tamoxifen ( TA ) on the change of cell volume as induced by the change of substrate stiffness were further investigated . Then under stimulation of hypotonic solution , the regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) of the cells cultured on PA gel was monitored , which is a cell physiological event related to cell volume regulation . Finally , the relationship between cancer cell migration on PA gel and cell volume regulation was tested . This work could provide a new perspective for further investigating the mechanisms of cellular mechanotransduction . Materials and Methods PA gel preparation . PA hydrogels were prepared following the protocol reported in literature ( Wen et al . , 2014 ) . A polymer solution , containing acrylamide monomers ( MP Biomedicals , Aurora , Ohio , USA ) , crosslinker N , N methylene - bis - acrylamide ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) , 1 mg ml - 1 ammonium persulphate ( APS ) ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) and 0 . 1 % volume of N , N , N’ , N’ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) , was firstly prepared . To ensure the easy detachment of PA gel , the polymerized solution was then sandwiched between a hydrophobic slide and a hydrophilic glass coverslip . After polymerizing for 5 min at room temperature , the PA gel was immersed into a solution containing 1 mg ml - 1 N - sulphosuccinimidyl - 6 - ( 4’ - azido - 2’ - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( sulfo - SANPAH ) ( Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA ) and then activated under irradiation by ultraviolet ( UV ) light at 365 nm for 10 min . The obtained PA gel was rinsed with 50 mM HEPES ( pH This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 6 8 . 5 , Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) for three times , incubated in a solution containing 50 μg ml - 1 collagen type I ( Corning , Manassas , USA ) overnight at room temperature and followed by washing with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) for three times . To adjust the stiffness and porosity of PA gels , the ratio of acrylamide ( % ) / MBA ( % ) was varied as follows : 4 / 0 . 40 , 6 / 0 . 06 , 10 / 0 . 02 for 4 kPa gel ; 6 / 0 . 45 , 10 / 0 . 10 , 20 / 0 . 03 for 13 kPa gel ; 8 / 0 . 55 , 10 / 0 . 30 , 20 / 0 . 18 for 30 kPa gel . The porosity of PA gel increases within each stiffness group . Finally , the collagen coated PA gels were sterilized by UV light before use . Cell volume measurement . Human breast cancer cells ( MCF - 7 ) cultured on PA gels were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at 37°C for 10 min . Then the PA gels were washed by PBS for three times . The optical images of isolated cells were captured using a LSRM ( Olympus OLS4000 , Japan ) . Inhibition experiment . MCF - 7 cells were plated on PA gel substrates at a density of 10 , 000 cells cm - 2 . A group of MCF - 7 cells was incubated in the solution including one of the following reagents for 24 h : 4 , 4′ - diisothiocyanatostilbene - 2 , 2′ - disulfonic acid disodium salt hydrate ( DIDS ) ( 0 . 5 mM , Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA , Catalogue no . D3514 ) , R ( + ) - SCH - 23390 hydrochloride ( SCH ) ( 15 μM , Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA , Catalogue no . C0206 ) or tamoxifen citrate salt ( TA ) ( 15 μM , Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , USA , Catalogue no . T9262 ) . The other group of MCF - 7 cells was firstly allowed to spread in the culture media for 20 h . Then the culture media was exchanged with the media containing inhibitor ( DIDS , SCH or TA ) and cultivated for another 4 h or 24 h . The MCF - 7 cells were finally fixed before imaging using LSRM . Hypo - osmotic stimulation experiment . MCF - 7 cells were cultured on PA gel substrates at a density of 10 , 000 cells cm - 2 with or without one of the following reagents : SCH ( 15 μM ) or TA ( 15 μM ) . After incubation for 24 h , MFC - 7 cells were stained by CellMask™ DeepRed ( Invitrogen , New York , USA , Catalogue no . This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 7 C10046 ) . Confocal images of single cells were taken for more than 3 min without intervals by a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope using a live cell imaging system under a constant temperature of 37°C . MCF - 7 cells were immersed in PBS solution during the first 30 s of monitoring . Then a peristaltic pump was applied to perfuse the half - diluted PBS into the bottom of the cell culture dish , and the other one was used to pump the extra solution out for another 30 s . After this , MCF - 7 cells were immersed in a hypotonic solution . Cell migration experiment . MCF - 7 cells were plated on PA gel at a density of 10 , 000 cells cm - 2 with or without adding TA ( 15 μM ) . MCF - 7 cells were stained by cell nuclear dye Nucblue ® Live Cell Stain ( Invitrogen , New York , USA , Catalogue no . R37605 ) after incubation for 24 h . Time - lapse images of cells immersed in L - 15 media ( Gibco , New York , USA , Catalogue no . 11415064 ) were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a live cell imaging system for 10 h with 20 min intervals under a constant temperature of 37°C . Image analysis . Only the isolated MCF - 7 cells , i . e . , the cells without cell - cell contact , were counted during image analysis . To calculate the cell volume , images of single cells were thresholded manually using ImageJ software ( NIH , USA ) . The height values within the area of the thresholded cell body were imported into MatLab program ( Mathworks , USA ) . To analyze the cell volume change induced by hypo - osmotic stimulation , confocal image stacks of the plasma membrane - stained MCF - 7 cells were analyzed using Volocity software ( Perkin Elmer , USA ) . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction of confocal image stacks at each time point was performed . The cell volume was then calculated based on the deep red staining of plasma membrane . To analyze the cell migration , confocal images were analyzed using plugins in ImageJ . The manual tracking plugin ( Ibidi , Germany ) was used to manually track the migration route and chemotaxis of the isolated cells .

The stiffness of PA gels can be adjusted by varying the concentration ratio of monomer and crosslinker , which may alter the pore size of PA gels and thus make it challenging to differentiate the effect of substrate stiffness or pore size on the cell volume regulation ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2014 ; Wen et al . , 2014 ) . Previous studies have shown that the mechanical resistance of culture substrate , which triggers cellular mechanotransduction , could be induced by ECM proteins ( e . g . , fibronectin and collagen ) tethering apart from the substrate stiffness ( Chaudhuri and Mooney , 2012 ; Trappmann et al . , 2012 ) . For instance , by changing the pore size of substrate or the concentration of protein - substrate linker ( e . g . , sulfo - SANPAH ) , collagen tethering can be adjusted through manipulating the distribution of adjacent anchoring sites for collagen ( Trappmann et al . , 2012 ; Wen et al . , 2014 ) , which could steer cell behaviors ( e . g . , spreading and differentiation ) variably on substrates with various stiffness ( Trappmann et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , we prepared PA gels on glass following the protocol developed by Engler’s group ( Wen et al . , 2014 ) , which enables us to independently investigate the effect of substrate stiffness and pore size of PA gels . In this work , the PA gels with stiffness of 4 kPa , 13 kPa and 30 kPa , which represent the typical stiffness of native tissues and mimic the mammary tissue , muscle and osteoid ( i . e . , the targets for breast cancer metastasis ( Discher et al . , 2009 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ; Gilbert et al . , 2010 ; Lutolf et al . , 2009 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Plodinec et al . , 2012 ; Rowlands et al . , 2008 ; Tilghman et al . , 2010 ) ) , were used as the substrates for This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 9 culturing MCF - 7 cells . Three concentration ratios of acrylamide ( % ) / N , N methylene - bis - acrylamide ( MBA ) ( % ) were used to adjust the stiffness of PA gels ( Wen et al . , 2014 ) , which was characterized using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1a ) . Meanwhile , the pore size of the as - prepared PA gels was characterized using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . We observed that the pore size of PA gels with the same stiffness increases with increasing ratio of acrylamide ( % ) / MBA ( % ) . These results confirm that the stiffness and pore size of PA gel substrate can be manipulated independently , and the stiffness of fabricated PA gels matches our expectation ( 4 kPa , 13 kPa and 30 kPa ) . Influence of substrate stiffness on the volume of adherent MCF - 7 cells . To study the effect of substrate stiffness on cell volume , we cultured MCF - 7 cells on PA gels with different stiffness and pore sizes , and then characterized the cell volume using LSRM . From the LSRM images ( Fig . 1a ) , it can be observed that the cells cultured on 4 kPa gel are basically round with no obvious protrusion , while cells on 30 kPa gel or glass exhibit spreading morphology . To further assess the effect of substrate stiffness on cell volume , the cell volume from the LSRM images of MCF - 7 cells on PA gels were quantified . From the statistic results ( Fig . 1b ) , we can clearly observe that the volume of MCF - 7 cells increases with the increase of PA gel stiffness , i . e . , from ~ 400 μm 3 / cell on 4 kPa gel to ~ 850 μm 3 / cell on 30 kPa gel . More specifically , the change of stiffness causes a 100 % increase of cell volume , and the maximal cell volume ( ~ 1000 μm 3 ) is obtained from the group of cells cultured on the glass substrate ( with stiffness of ~ GPa ) . Since no significant difference of cell volume among the MCF - 7 cells cultured on PA gels with different pore sizes is observed , it can be concluded that the stiffness rather than the pore size of substrate affects the volume regulation of MCF - 7 cells . Although previous studies have reported a similar trend of the effect of substrate stiffness on cell size in terms of cell spreading area ( Engler et al . , 2004 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ; Zustiak et al . , 2014 ) , our observation herein is revealing the contribution of substrate stiffness on cell volume regulation for the first time . This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 10 Influence factors of substrate stiffness on cell volume homeostasis . The comprehensive mechanism of cell volume regulation in response to osmotic stress has been investigated and reported in many perspectives ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Lang , 2007 ; Okada , 2004 ) . Ion channels have been proved to be the permanent effecter in this process . However , only a few studies focused on how cell mechanical microenvironment affects cell volume . In this study , the cytoskeleton and inhibitors of cell membrane anion permeability , dopamine receptor and estrogen receptor were selected as candidates for studying the mechanism of cell volume regulation by substrate stiffness . In order to exclude the influence of cell spreading , the effect of inhibitors on cellular volume homeostasis regulation was assessed both before and after cell spreading . Firstly , the actin stress fiber in MCF - 7 cells in response to various substrate stiffness was stained using TRITC Phalloidin . In Supplementary Fig . S4 , no significant difference among the three groups of PA gels ( ~ 4 , ~ 13 and ~ 30 kPa ) is found . And the shapes of the stained F - actin are all dot - like without obvious stress fibers . It indicates that the organization of cytoskeleton ( F - actin fiber ) is not altered in MCF - 7 cells cultured on PA gel with different stiffness . Therefore , the organization of stress fiber could not be the transmitter from substrate stiffness to cell volume regulation . Secondly , we evaluated the effect of cellular membrane receptor on cellular volume homeostasis regulation by inhibiting cellular anion permeability and dopamine receptor of MCF - 7 cells using inhibitors ( DIDS and SCH ) before cells attached to the PA gel substrate . After 24 hours of cell incubation with inhibitors , we measured the cell volume of MCF - 7 cells . As shown in Fig . 2 , the cell volume in normal culture without inhibitors increases with increasing substrate stiffness . But this trend is dramatically affected by inhibition of cellular anion permeability . For instance , the inhibition of cellular anion permeability of MCF - 7 cells in each experiment group This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 11 causes the decrease of cell volume to a similar level , which is even slightly smaller than the volume of cells on 4 kPa gel in normal culture . While in the case of inhibiting dopamine receptor , we can also observe the decrease of cell volume as caused by receptor inhibition . But the cell volume still increases with increasing substrate stiffness even when the dopamine receptor is inhibited . These results indicate that the cell volume is regulated by these two influence factors , i . e . , cell volume increases with the increase of substrate stiffness , while cell volume deceases after inhibition of cellular membrane receptors . The inhibition of cellular anion permeability and dopamine receptor significantly influence the regulation of substrate stiffness on cell volume , where the increase of cell volume as induced by the increase of substrate stiffness could be regulated by manipulation of cellular anion permeability , and the blockage of dopamine receptor is also a choice to modify it . Last , to exclude the influence of the inhibitors on cell spreading , the effect of inhibition on cellular volume homeostasis regulation after cell spreading was assessed . We seeded MCF - 7 cells on PA gels for 20 hours to ensure that cells fully spread and established cell volume homeostasis before adding inhibitors ( DIDS , SCH and a common used anti - breast cancer drug ( TA , an inhibitor of estrogen receptor ) ) to the culture system . After 4 and 24 hours of culture with inhibitors , the cell volume was characterized and calculated ( Fig . 3 ) . By comparing the cell volumes of the 4 hours inhibition group and the normal culture group , we can observe that after inhibition using DIDS or TA , the cell volume significantly decreases on 13 kPa , 30 kPa PA gels and glass , whereas slightly decreases on 4 kPa PA gel ( Fig . 3a , c ) . For the group of adding SCH , the cell volume significantly decreases only on 30 kPa PA gel and glass substrates , indicating that the effect of inhibition using SCH on cellular volume homeostasis regulation is weaker . Further , to evaluate the time - dependence of inhibition effect on cell volume homeostasis , we compared the cell volume after inhibition for 4 and 24 hours . For the DIDS , for each stiffness group , the cell volume after inhibition for 24 hours is smaller than that for 4 hours ( Fig . 3a ) , indicating that This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 12 the effect of cellular anion permeability inhibitor ( DIDS ) on cell volume homeostasis is enhanced with time . In the case of TA , no significant difference of cell volumes between 4 hours and 24 hours groups is observed , and the cell volumes are all significantly smaller than the normal culture groups on each kind of substrate , except for the 4 kPa group ( Fig . 3c ) . It implies that TA can be a fast - acting and long - lasting option to manipulate cell volume homeostasis . For the dopamine receptor inhibition using SCH , the cell volume at 24 hours is bigger than that at 4 hours for each stiffness substrate , although it is still smaller than that of the normal culture group ( except for the 13 kPa group ) ( Fig . 3b ) . These results show that the influence of substrate stiffness on the established cell volume homeostasis could be manipulated by the anion trans - membrane transport . The regulation on cell volume homeostasis of TA implies that its anti - breast cancer effect might not just rely on the antagonism to estrogen . In summary , blockage of cell membrane anion permeability , dopamine receptor and estrogen receptor inhibits the increase of cell volume as caused by increasing substrate stiffness , no matter whether inhibitors are applied before or after the cells attach to the substrate ( Figs . 2 - 3 ) , while the cytoskeleton seems not to be involved in this process . Therefore , it can be concluded from the above results that the cellular anion permeability profoundly influences this cellular volume homeostasis regulation process , suggesting that the distribution of anion across the cell membrane affects the cellular volume homeostasis regulation . However , the inhibition of dopamine receptor just has a minor effect , indicating that the dopamine receptor is not a main transmitter from substrate stiffness to cell volume homeostasis . In the case of TA , its significant influence on this regulation process might imply some new pathways for its anti - breast cancer effect other than the antagonism to estrogen . Volume change of MCF - 7 cell stimulated by hypo - osmotic stress . To further investigate the stability of the established cell volume homeostasis of MCF - 7 cells , This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 13 the recovery of cell swelling caused by the hypo - osmotic stress stimulation , i . e . , RVD , was monitored . By using half - diluted PBS as the hypo - osmotic stress stimulator , the volume changes of the membrane - stained MCF - 7 cells were monitored in real - time using confocal microscope , and the stimulation started from 30 s of monitoring . Under the hypo - osmotic stress , MCF - 7 cells on substrates with different stiffness behave variably ( Fig . 4a ) . The volume of cells on stiffer substrates ( 30 kPa gel and glass ) firstly increases about 20 % , then drops to 80 % ( for glass ) or 90 % ( for 30 kPa PA gel ) , both finally slightly restore around 100 % of the initial volume . The extent of cell volume decrease on glass is more than that on the 30 kPa PA gel . In the end , cells on glass restore to initial volumes better than that on the 30 kPa PA gel . The volume of cells on softer substrates ( 4 kPa and 13 kPa gel ) drops about 20 % at first , then increases to 100 % ( for 4 kPa PA gel ) or 120 % ( for 13 kPa PA gel ) , and finally the cell volume of 4 kPa gel group drops continually , while that of 13 kPa gel group restores to 100 % waveringly . It indicates that the RVD response of MCF - 7 cells to the hypo - osmotic stress stimulation is associated with substrate stiffness . For stiffer substrate , the RVD starts earlier than that of softer substrate , and the magnitude range of RVD on stiffer substrate is bigger than that of softer substrate . The final cell volume on the stiffer substrates is closer to the original level than that on softer substrates . This implies that in terms of RVD response to the cell swelling caused by the hypo - osmotic stress stimulation , the stability of established cell volume homeostasis is enhanced with increasing substrate stiffness . We also studied the effects of these inhibitors on the RVD of cells through using the 4 kPa PA gel and the glass as the cell substrates with the minimal and maximal stiffness , respectively ( Fig . 4b - e ) . The RVD response of MCF - 7 cells to the hypo - osmotic stress stimulation changes dramatically after adding the inhibitors ( SCH and TA ) . In the case of the 4 kPa PA gel , after adding the inhibitor ( SCH ) , the peak of cell swelling firstly increases about 17 % and then recovers to its original value . Before swelling , the cell volume shrinks on 4 kPa PA gel with or without SCH . With using TA as the This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 14 inhibitor , the peak of cell swelling increases about 80 % , then slightly drops to 100 % with a dropping rate similar to the one without inhibitor . And no cell shrinkage is observed before cell swelling on 4 kPa PA gel with TA ( Fig . 4b ) . For the glass substrate group , after adding the inhibitor of SCH , the peak of cell swelling decreases about 10 % , then slightly drops to 100 % , and the cell volume drops about 30 % before cell swelling . With using TA as the inhibitor , the peak of cell swelling increases about 40 % . After that , the cell volume restoration is similar to the one without inhibitor , and the final cell volume is 20 % smaller than that without inhibitor ( Fig . 4c ) . These results indicate the stability of the established cell volume homeostasis is dramatically affected by TA and SCH . The curves of the relative cell volumes have similar trend under the effect of the same inhibitor , no matter how stiff the substrate is . In the case of adding TA , the cell swelling happens fast and dramatically ( > 60 % ) , and there is no shrinkage before cell swelling . For the soft substrate group , the peak of cell swelling is slower and higher , the RVD is milder , and the final level of cell volume is higher than the stiff substrate group ( Fig . 4d ) . In the case of adding SCH , a cell shrinkage is observed before swelling . The peak of cell swelling is about 15 % and the cell volume drops slightly . For the soft substrate group , the minimal volume of cell shrinkage is slower and smaller , the peak of swelling is higher , the recovery of swelling is milder , and the final level of cell volume is higher than the stiff substrate group ( Fig . 4e ) . These results suggest that the stability of the established cell volume homeostasis is better for the cells on stiffer substrate when TA or SCH is added into the culture system . It further indicates that the regulation of cell volume homeostasis by TA or SCH has interplay with the effect of substrate stiffness on RVD . Based on the above results and in terms of the RVD caused by the hypo - osmotic stress stimulation , the stability of the established cell volume homeostasis could be regulated by substrate stiffness , and the regulation is affected dramatically by SCH or TA . Migration of MCF - 7 cells on PA gels under the influence of Tamoxifen . Cell volume has been reported to be related to cell migration ( Ritter et al . , 1998 ; Stroka et This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved 15 al . , 2014 ) . It is thus advisable to assess the effect of substrate stiffness and the anti - breast cancer drug TA on cell migration . Herein , we firstly used the time - lapse imaging technique to record the migration of MCF - 7 cells on PA gel with TA , then manually tracked and analyzed the route of cell migration using software ( Fig . 5 ) . From the figure , for the MCF - 7 cells cultured on softer substrates ( 4 kPa and 13 kPa ) , no significant difference is observed for the cell migration velocity between groups with and without adding TA . While , for the stiffer substrate group ( 30 kPa ) , the velocity of cell migration significantly decreases after adding TA . It indicates that the substrate stiffness has no significant effect on the velocity of cell migration under normal culture conditions . However , under the influence of TA , the velocity of cell migration significantly decreases from 4 kPa group to 13 kPa group and reaches the minimal value on the 30 kPa group . These results imply that the migration velocity of MCF - 7 cells is significantly inhibited by the decrease of cell volume caused by TA . And the inhibition effect on the cell migration is enhanced with the increase of substrate stiffness , indicating that the migration of MCF - 7 cell is regulated by the interplay of substrate stiffness and cell volume . Discussion The above experimental results demonstrate that the cell volume homeostasis could be regulated by substrate stiffness . Although previous studies have reported the effect of substrate stiffness on cell size in terms of cell spreading area ( Engler et al . , 2004 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ; Zustiak et al . , 2014 ) , it remains elusive how substrate stiffness regulates cell volume homeostasis . At first , the inhibition of dopamine receptor is designed to be a negative control . But surprisingly it does affect cellular volume homeostasis regulation , even in a minor extent . Regarding to the mechanism of the regulation of cell volume homeostasis by substrate stiffness , the activity of anion transmembrane transportation is found to be necessary for the mechanotransduction process .

Further studies are needed to figure out which pathway might be responsible for the regulation process . Considering that the stress in cell membrane and the stiffness of cell may also increase with increasing substrate stiffness ( Byfield et al . , 2009 ; Tee et al . , 2011 ) and there is no visible stress fiber in all experiment groups in this study , we propose that ion channels / transporters themselves react to the stress in cell membrane as the mechanism for the regulation of MCF - 7 cell volume homeostasis by substrate stiffness . The effect of the mechanical property of ECM on cell behavior is hypothesized that the mechanotransduction consists of two parts : the measuring of substrate stiffness through cells that sense resistance to the traction forces applied to the substrate , and the transduction to biochemical signals by integrin and its downstream transducers . Previous studies about the transduction part are mainly focused on the rearrangement of cytoskeleton , the protein kinases cascade and the translocation of transcription factor . However , the activity of ion transmembrane transportation and their role on mechanotransduction have seldom been studied . Concerning the fundamental role of cell volume regulation in cell behavior , the effect of cellular mechanical microenvironment on cell volume homeostasis and the related mechanotransduction pathway need to be paid more attention to . The results from this study could also enlighten the treatment of cancer metastasis . The migration of MCF - 7 cell cultured on 30 kPa PA gel is inhibited significantly by Tamoxifen , and the effect of inhibition increases with increasing substrate stiffness .

Considering the dependence of mitosis and migration on cell volume , it is of high possibility that the regulation of substrate stiffness on cell volume plays an important role in tumor formation and tumor cell invasion . Some studies have already found that stiffer substrates facilitate cancer cell migration ( Lo et al . , 2000 ; Pranav et al . , 2012 ) . And the volume regulated ion channels are involved in this process ( Schwab , 2001 ) , indicating that cell volume is associated with cancer cell migration . While , not all of the migrated cancer cells are the seed of a secondary tumor , the cancer stem cell in a cancer cell population is highly volume - related , the correlation between the cell volume and the stemness of cancer cell has been suggested ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . Besides , the lineage choice of neural stem cell ( Pathak et al . , 2014 ) and the cardiac fibroblast differentiation ( Adapala et al . , 2013 ) are also mechanosensitve and related to the cell volume regulation . This work might provide a new perspective into the cancer metastasis research that the anti - breast cancer effect of Tamoxifen may not be just restricted to its antagonism to estrogen , the regulatory influence on cell volume homeostasis of Tamoxifen as a volume - regulated anion channel ( VRAC ) blocker could be a promising target for anti - cancer therapy . In conclusion , our results show that the volume homeostasis of MCF - 7 cells is regulated by the substrate stiffness , i . e . , the MCF - 7 cell volume increases with increasing the substrate stiffness . The cellular anion permeability plays an important role in the process of cell volume regulation . Moreover , it is most likely to be a transmitter linking the cellular mechanical microenvironment and the cellular volume homeostasis regulation . The inhibition of dopamine receptor could also modify this regulation process . The anti - breast cancer effect of Tamoxifen may not only rely on the antagonism to estrogen , the regulation on cell volume homeostasis contributes to This article is protected by copyright .
