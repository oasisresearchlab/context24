Here we show that the activated Arp2 / 3 complex interacts with the barbed ends of filaments to initiate barbed - end branching . Barbed - end branching by Arp2 / 3 quantitatively accounts for polymerization kinetics and for the length correlation of the branches of filaments observed by electron microscopy . Filament branching is visualized at the surface of Listeria in a reconstituted motility assay . The functional antagonism between the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping proteins is essential in the maintenance of the steady state of actin assembly and actin - based motility . ctin polymerization in response to signalling drives the extension of lamellipodia , the formation of microspikes and the propulsion of Listeria and Shigella . Reconstitution of actin - based motility from a minimum set of pure proteins 1 ( reviewed in ref . 2 ) has provided insights into the mechanism by which actin polymerization generates movement . Filaments are generated at the leading edges or the surfaces of Listeria and Shigella 3 , 4 by the Arp2 / 3 complex . They are then locally activated , by the protein ActA at the surface of Listeria 5 , and by proteins of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family , which connect signalling to actin assembly , in eukaryotic cells 6 – 10 and at the surface of Shigella 11 . Sustained movement results from rapid , ATP - driven treadmilling of actin filaments 12 , mediated by the combined activi - ties of actin depolymerizing factor and capping proteins 13 . Force production is restricted to specific sites as a result of the ‘decommis - sioning’ action of capping proteins , which prevent growth of fila - ments that are disconnected from the growth site . In lamellipodia , actin filaments are organized in a Y - shaped , branched array , and Arp2 / 3 is localized at the branches 14 . Branched filaments can also be observed , by electron microscopy , in solutions of actin polymerized in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex 15 . In Shigella - infected cells , N - WASP localizes exclusively to the bacterial surface , whereas Arp2 / 3 is present throughout the actin tail 11 . In vitro studies of the effect of Arp2 / 3 on actin have shown that the Arp2 / 3 complex by itself is a poor nucleator , but , when acti - vated by the isolated carboxy - terminal WA domain of WASP / Scar proteins , it greatly stimulates actin polymerization . Activation of Arp2 / 3 implies binding of WA to both Arp2 / 3 and G - actin 6 . The WA – actin complex associates productively with barbed filament ends 11 .

Understanding the mechanism by which filaments are nucleated and branched requires a quantitative analysis of the stimulation of polymerization by WA - activated Arp2 / 3 . Here we show that the WA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex interacts with the barbed ends of fil - aments or nuclei to initiate barbed - end branching . Barbed - end branching quantitatively accounts for the observed kinetics of stim - ulated actin polymerization and for the correlation between the lengths of the branches . Results The WA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex initiates barbed - end branch - ing . Spontaneous polymerization of actin alone is generally described as a nucleation – growth process . In contrast , in the pres - ence of WA - activated Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 1a ) , the polymerization process exhibited autocatalytic behaviour , similar to that of bacterial growth or of actin polymerization under a sustained regime of fila - ment fragmentation 18 , involving generation of new ends as fila - ments grew . The autocatalytic nature of the polymerization process in the presence of Arp2 / 3 is shown by the symmetry of the polym - erization curves around the mid - polymerization point ; as a result , when we plotted fluorescence recordings of the polymerization process ( pyrenyl - actin fluorescence ( F ) against time ) as ln { ( F – F 0 ) / ( F max – F ) } against time , taking t 1 / 2 as the time origin , the time courses were linear over at least 2 decades , with a correlation coef - ficient of > 0 . 999 ( Fig . 1a , inset ) . In contrast , in nucleation – growth polymerization , this representation is linear for t > t 1 / 2 , but strongly deviates from linearity for t < t 1 / 2 ( Fig . 1a , inset , dashed line ) . Kinetic analysis of the polymerization curves ( Fig . 1b ) showed that , in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , the time dependence of the number of ends , [ F ] ( t ) ( where [ F ] represents the concentration of filament ends ) , shows an acceleration , and that the average filament length increases less than twofold whereas the number of filaments increases more than tenfold . Neither of these features is usually observed in the nucleation – growth process . The autocatalytic nature of the polymerization process stimulated by Arp2 / 3 indi - cates that the product of the reaction , F - actin , may activate its own production . Our kinetic analysis therefore corroborates previous reports 7 , 16 . To determine whether Arp2 / 3 interacts with the sides or the ends of filaments to elicit autocatalytic polymerization , we carried out the following experiments : Arp2 / 3 was added at various times ( designated in each case as t 0 ) to a solution of actin ( 2 . 5 m M ) and WA ( 0 . 5 m M ) , which was induced to polymerize by addition of salt at time zero ( Fig . 2a ) . The acceleration phase of F ( t ) grew shorter upon delaying the time of addition of Arp2 / 3 , t 0 . However , all the curves were superimposable between 5 % and 100 % of completion Figure 2 WA - activated Arp2 / 3 stimulates actin polymerization by interacting with barbed filament ends . a , Actin was polymerized at 2 . 5 m M in the presence of 0 . 5 m M WA ( bottom curve ) . Arp2 / 3 ( 4 . 8 nM ) was added to the polymerizing solution at various times t 0 indicated by arrows , and stimulated polymerization was recorded . Note that the lag in Arp2 / 3 - stimulated polymerization decreases with increasing t 0 and that curves are superimposable by lateral translation . b , Analysis of data from a . The concentration of filament ends , [ F ] , formed in the preassembling solution was derived from the first derivative of the polymerization curve . The mid - polymerization time , t 1 / 2 , was measured for each curve . The reciprocal of t 1 / 2 – t 0 ( circles ) is temporally correlated with [ F ] ( squares ) . c , Fragmented filaments are more efficient than non - fragmented filaments in enhancing the effect of Arp2 / 3 in stimulating actin assembly . Actin was polymerized at 2 . 5 m M in the presence of 0 . 5 m M WA , 9 . 4 nM Arp2 / 3 and , where indicated , 20 nM F - actin seeds from a 1 . 5 m M F - actin solution , either non - fragmented or fragmented by pipetting . The final end concentrations were 10 pM and 22 pM respectively , corresponding to filament lengths of 5 . 4 m m and 2 . 5 m m before and after fragmentation . d , Enhanced activation of Arp2 / 3 correlates with the number of barbed filament ends at equal mass of F - actin . The experiment was carried out as for c , except that F - actin seeds were assembled from spectrin – actin at various concentrations ; final spectrin – actin concentrations are shown ( constant mass of F - actin ) . Identical data were obtained using F - ADP – BeF 3 filaments as seeds ( data not shown ) . e , Enhanced activation of Arp2 / 3 by barbed - end nuclei . The indicated spectrin – actin concentrations were added at time zero to a 2 . 5 m M solution of G - actin containing 0 . 5 m M WA and 17 nM Arp2 / 3 . f , For an equal number of ends , activation of Arp2 / 3 is independent of the mass of F - actin .

These obser - vations are similar to recently reported results 16 . The data were ana - lysed as follows : the difference , t 1 / 2 – t 0 , between the mid - polymerization time , t 1 / 2 , and the time of addition of Arp2 / 3 , t 0 , decreased to a lower limit when addition of Arp2 / 3 was delayed ( increased t 0 value ) , and therefore did not correlate with the amount of preassembled F - actin at time t 0 , which increased contin - uously . In contrast , 1 / ( t 1 / 2 – t 0 ) kinetically correlated with the con - centration , [ F ] , of filament ends or nuclei preformed at time t 0 , which reached a maximum when 0 . 12 m M F - actin was preassem - bled ( Fig . 2b ) . These data indicate that Arp2 / 3 stimulates polymer - ization once nuclei are formed and that the interaction of activated Arp2 / 3 with filament ends is involved in the acceleration of polym - erization . To distinguish further between filament side - binding and end - binding of Arp2 / 3 in accelerating polymerization , we carried out the following experiments ; first , preassembled F - actin ( 40 nM , cor - responding to 10 pM filament ends ) was mixed at time zero with MgATP – G - actin , WA and Arp2 / 3 ; the lag phase was found to be shortened . However , when filaments were fragmented by pipetting before addition , so that the number of ends in the same amount of F - actin was 2 . 2 - fold larger , the lag phase was much shorter still ( Fig . 2c ) . Second , we carried out a similar experiment , adding 90 nM F - actin in the form of filaments assembled from spectrin – actin , so that the final concentration of barbed ends was either 3 pM or 30 pM ( Fig . 2d ) . The shortening of the lag phase was more pro - nounced when the number of filaments per unit mass of F - actin was greater . Third , addition of spectrin – actin seeds ( barbed - end nuclei ) , in the absence of F - actin , shortened the lag phase in a con - centration - dependent manner ( Fig . 2e ) . Finally , shortening of the lag phase was independent of the mass of F - actin added at a given concentration of barbed ends ( Fig . 2f ) . Overall , these results indi - cate that activated Arp2 / 3 may interact with the barbed ends , rather than with the sides of actin filaments , to generate new filaments , and do not support the idea that Arp2 / 3 generates new filaments by fragmentation . Electron - microscopic observation of Arp2 / 3 - branched filaments . Electron - microscopic observation of filaments assembled in the presence of WA - activated Arp2 / 3 ( see Methods ) showed a mixed population of branched and non - branched filaments ( Fig . 3a ) . If phalloidin was not added before staining , branched filaments were seen only rarely . Branches were asymmetrical and y - shaped , as observed in lamellipodia 14 and in vitro 15 , defining a ‘mother’ fila - ment , which continues to grow in its original direction , and a ‘daughter’ filament , which grows at a 70 (cid:176) angle to the direction of mother - filament growth . Statistical evaluation of the lengths of the two branches following the branching point ( Fig . 3b ) showed that the lengths of the two branches are correlated , with a correlation coefficient of 0 . 81 . The length ratio of the daughter and mother branches was centered on 0 . 9 – 0 . 1 ( Fig . 3b , inset ) . This value is much closer to the value of 1 . 0 expected if branching occurs from barbed ends , than to the value of 0 . 5 expected if branching occurs randomly from the sides of filaments . As a large but undefined proportion of filaments polymerized in the presence of WA - activated Arp2 / 3 appeared to be unbranched in electron micrographs , we measured the number of barbed and pointed ends during Arp2 / 3 - stimulated polymerization , using a growth assay ( see Methods ) . Both end types increased in number and reached a plateau at the end of the polymerization ( Fig . 3c ) . Hence , not all filaments generated by barbed - end branching remain stably branched . The extent of branching was 25 – 5 % in separate experiments ; in other words , 75 % of filaments generated by barbed - end branching have free pointed ends , which are able to grow when brought into a solution of G - actin . Barbed - end branching model for stimulation of actin polymeriza - tion by Arp2 / 3 . These data support a model for the stimulation of actin polymerization by Arp2 / 3 in which a barbed end interacts with complex composed of WA , G - actin and Arp2 / 3 to initiate a second filament . Each branch grows from G - actin subunits and may undergo further branching by Arp2 / 3 , generating a fractal growth pattern 19 . The barbed - end branching model accounts well for both the polymerization kinetics ( Fig . 1a ) and the length corre - lation of branches . The following equations describe the model : Arp2 / 3 + ( A + WA ) « Y ( 1 ) A + A « F ( 2 ) F + A « F ( 3 ) F + Y + 2A « 2F ( 4 ) Y + Y « Y 2 ( 5 ) where A represents G - actin , F is a barbed end and Y is the ter - nary G - actin – WA – Arp2 / 3 complex . Equation ( 1 ) describes the activation of Arp2 / 3 by binding to the G - actin – WA complex ; equa - tion ( 2 ) represents actin - filament nucleation ; equation ( 3 ) repre - sents barbed - end growth ; equation ( 4 ) describes autocatalytic Figure 3 Branched filaments in solutions of actin polymerizing in the presence of WA - activated Arp2 / 3 . a , Typical electron - microsopic image showing branched filaments .

The association of two G - actin subunits in the branching process is required to account for the fact that the number of fila - ment ends reaches a limit in the polymerization process . This model stipulates that nucleation is not affected by Arp2 / 3 . We simulated polymerization time courses using KINSIM , selecting values for the rate parameters of the interaction of Arp2 / 3 and barbed ends that provided the best adjustment to experimental polymerization curves at 2 . 5 m M actin , 0 . 5 m M WA and varying concentrations of Arp2 / 3 . Equations 1 – 4 fit well with the observed kinetics in a small range of Arp2 / 3 concentrations . However , data clearly show that the specific activity of Arp2 / 3 decreases upon increasing its concen - tration . We therefore incorporated a further hypothesis , that Y is partially dimerized into an inactive dimer ( equation 5 ; formally equivalent to dissociation of an endogenous inhibitor at low con - centration ) , in order for the model to fit the data within a concen - tration range spanning two orders of magnitude ( Fig . 1a ) . We used the following parameter values in the best fit : k + 2 = 2 · 10 – 9 m M – 1 s – 1 ; k – 2 = 5 · 10 – 4 s – 1 ; k + 3 = 10 m M – 1 s – 1 ; k – 3 = 1 s – 1 ; k 4 = 0 . 64 m M – 3 s – 1 ; k 5 = 10 – 2 m M . The first two parameters are derived from adjustment of the polymerization curves in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , and the k + 3 value is conventionally used to describe association of MgATP – G - actin with barbed ends . The fit of only k 4 and k 5 is required to describe the series of curves spanning a range of Arp2 / 3 concentrations from 1 . 75 – 71 . 0 nM . Evidence for the dynamics of barbed - end branching in Listeria motility . The above results indicate that , in the movement of Liste - ria or Shigella , the Arp2 / 3 complex , locally activated by ActA 5 or by IcsA - bound N - WASP 11 , may associate with the barbed end of a nucleus or of a growing filament , thereby promoting its branching and insertional polymerization . A steady number of barbed ends is presumably maintained by the counteracting effect of capping pro - teins , which steadily ‘decommission’ growing barbed ends 1 , 2 and prevent expansion of the branched meshwork away from the bacte - Figure 4 Evidence of barbed - end branching in bacterial actin - based motility . Time - lapse images showing actin - based motility of Listeria in reconstituted motility medium 1 modified by replacing capping protein with gelsolin at a gelsolin / actin ratio of 1 : 500 ( 16 nM gelsolin , 8 m M F - actin ) . Time - lapse recording of this movement ( see Supplementary Information ) shows branched actin filaments continuing to grow immediately behind the bacterium at a 70 (cid:176) angle to the actin - tail axis . Figure 5 Functional antagonism between capping proteins and Arp2 / 3 regulates the critical concentration . a , Arp2 / 3 generates barbed ends in solutions of gelsolin - capped filaments . Serial dilutions of F - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labelled ) were made in F buffer containing 0 . 1 m M WA either with free barbed ends ( closed symbols ) or with gelsolin - capped barbed ends ( gelsolin / actin = 1 : 250 ; open symbols ) , at Arp2 / 3 concentrations of 0 nM ( circles ) , 25 nM ( squares ) or 75 nM ( triangles ) . b , The critical concentration is controlled by the relative concentrations of gelsolin and Arp2 / 3 . Solutions of 0 . 9 m M F - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labelled ) assembled in the presence of gelsolin at gelsolin / actin ratios of 1 : 600 ( open circles ) , 1 : 250 ( squares ) , 1 : 100 ( triangles ) were incubated for 18 h in the presence of 0 . 12 m M WA and the indicated Arp2 / 3 concentrations ( lower scale ) . Dashed line and closed circles represent data obtained in the absence of WA ( upper scale ) , at a gelsolin / actin ratio of 1 : 250 . Fluorescence values were calibrated to corresponding F - actin concentrations ( left scale ) . c , The Arp2 / 3 complex does not inhibit pointed - end growth .

For growth of actin filaments to be visualized before their being capped , the rate of barbed - end capping must therefore become limiting . Our strategy to obtain a controlled low frequency of capping was to replace capping proteins with gelsolin in the motility assay . Because of its very high affinity for barbed ends 20 , 21 , virtually all gelsolin binds to filaments in the medium , and the con - centration of free gelsolin is effectively zero . Barbed ends growing at the bacterial surface are capped once complete depolymerization of medium - capped filaments releases the capping gelsolin – actin com - plex ( GA 2 ) . At gelsolin / actin ratios of 1 : 200 and above , gelsolin sup - ported bacterial motility at the same rate as capping proteins ( Table 1 ) , which is consistent with in vivo data 22 . However , at lower gelsolin concentrations ( gelsolin / actin ratio < 1 : 500 ) , movement was slower and actin tails exhibited a ‘fish - bone’ appearance that was due to the branching and continued barbed - end growth of filaments at the immediate rear of the bacterium ( Fig . 4 ) . These filaments , associ - ated in bundles , grew at roughly 70 (cid:176) to the axis of the actin tail , at the same rate as those that promoted bacterium propulsion . They were eventually capped by gelsolin – actin and depolymerized from their pointed ends while detaching from the actin tail . In conclu - sion , the fish - bone appearance of the actin tail provides macro - scopic evidence of the branching of filaments in the tail . Functional antagonism between Arp2 / 3 and capping proteins . Capping proteins are abundant in living cells and have an active function in motility 22 – 26 . If Arp2 / 3 and capping proteins compete for barbed - end binding , the cycle of barbed - end generation , growth and growth arrest must be finely controlled to ensure efficient motility . Accordingly , movement of Listeria and Shigella in a recon - stituted medium exhibits optima in the concentrations of capping proteins and Arp2 / 3 ( ref . 1 ) . We investigated the relationship between capping proteins and the Arp2 / 3 complex . When barbed ends were free , neither non - acti - vated ( consistent with previous results 15 ) nor WA - activated Arp2 / 3 affected the critical concentration . When barbed ends were capped by gelsolin , however , WA - activated Arp2 / 3 caused a decrease in the critical concentration from the value of the pointed - end critical concentration ( 0 . 5 m M ) to the value measured when both ends are free ( 0 . 1 m M ; Fig . 5a ) . Non - activated Arp2 / 3 did not generally affect the critical concentration at pointed ends , although some decrease was detected at micromolar concentrations . The value of the critical concentration was controlled by the relative concentrations of gelsolin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . At a gelsolin / actin ratio of 1 : 300 , the critical concentration of gelsolin - capped fila - ments was shifted to the barbed - end critical concentration , in a man - ner that was dependent on Arp2 / 3 concentration ( Fig . 5a ) . Accordingly , larger amounts of activated Arp2 / 3 were required to reach the barbed - end critical concentration at higher gelsolin / actin ratios ( Fig . 5b ) . In conclusion , WA - activated Arp2 / 3 and gelsolin shift the critical concentration in opposite directions , by controlling the percentage of barbed ends that are capped . Capping protein b 2 was found to have a similar effect to that of gelsolin . In the presence of 40 nM capping protein and 100 nM WA , addition of 150 nM Arp2 / 3 lowered the critical concentration from 0 . 5 to 0 . 1 m M . Bacterial motility assays showed that inhibition of motility linked to a twofold increase in the concentration of capping protein at 100 nM Arp2 / 3 can be removed by doubling the concentration of Arp2 / 3 ( data not shown ) . That Arp2 / 3 does not actually displace gelsolin from barbed ends , but rather generates new barbed ends in solutions of capped filaments , was established as follows : first , immunoblotting showed that 100 % of gelsolin ( or capping protein ) was bound to sedi - mented F - actin polymerized in the presence of gelsolin ( or capping protein ) and in the presence or absence of 100 nM WA – Arp2 / 3 . Second , when added to a 0 . 5 m M solution of G - actin ( the pointed - end critical concentration ) , WA - activated Arp2 / 3 stimulated the polymerization of 0 . 4 m M F - actin . Third , when filaments preassem - bled in the presence of both gelsolin and activated Arp2 / 3 were used as seeds in a growth assay , the rate of elongation increased with the concentration of Arp2 / 3 in the seed solution , and growth was inhib - ited upon addition of capping protein to the growth assay . These results indicate that Arp2 / 3 may generate new filaments , with free barbed ends , that coexist with gelsolin - capped filaments .

Figure 6 Model for barbed - end branching of actin filaments by WA - activated Arp2 / 3 . For simplicity , Arp2 and Arp3 are represented individually as actin - like shapes in the Arp2 / 3 complex ( green ) ; the other five polypeptides are represented by a triangle . The following consecutive steps are involved in Arp2 / 3 - stimulated actin polymerization : ( 1 ) activation of Arp2 / 3 corresponds to formation of the ternary WA – actin – Arp2 / 3 complex in which WA ( pink ) interacts with both Arp2 / 3 and G - actin . ( 2 ) association of activated Arp2 / 3 with the barbed ends of the filaments . In this association , it is postulated that both Arp2 and the WA – actin moiety of this ternary complex form regular actin – actin - type bonds with the two terminal subunits that form the barbed end of the filament . Hence WA – actin , like profilin – actin , is bound to the barbed end of the mother branch , which is consistent with previous biochemical studies 9 . The Arp3 subunit is outside the filament . ( 3 ) branching of a new filament is initiated by association of one G - actin subunit with each branch ; this reaction is equivalent to a nucleation step , and dissociation of WA is linked to this event . ( 4 ) the two branches grow at equal rates by addition of G - actin subunits . ( 5 ) debranching occurs by dissociation of the bond between the daughter branch and Arp3 , leaving the Arp2 / 3 complex incorporated into the mother filament . 3 5 1 G - actin WA Arp2 / 3 Activated Arp2 / 3 2 4 70º © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles 390 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY | VOL 2 | JULY 2000 | www . nature . com / ncb The results shown in Fig . 5a are not consistent with the report 15 that Arp2 / 3 is a pointed - end - capping complex that increases the crit - ical concentration of pointed ends . We therefore investigated the effects of both WA - activated and non - activated Arp2 / 3 on the rates of pointed - end elongation and depolymerization . We found that non - activated Arp2 / 3 did not affect pointed - end growth , and that pointed - end growth of gelsolin - capped filaments was not inhibited by WA - activated Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 5c ) . The initial growth proceeded for several minutes at the same rate as in the absence of Arp2 / 3 and was followed by an acceleration of polymerization to a higher fluores - cence level than was observed in the absence of Arp2 / 3 . These results are in conflict with the data in ref . 15 , but are consistent with barbed - end branching from spontaneously formed nuclei and with establish - ment of a steady - state concentration of G - actin that is close to the barbed - end critical concentration . The rate of dilution - induced depolymerization of gelsolin - capped filaments was not affected by non - activated Arp2 / 3 or by WA - activated Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 5d ) . A similar result was obtained using thymosin b 4 to induce depolymerization ( data not shown ) . Together , the results presented in Fig . 5 show that Arp2 / 3 does not function as a pointed - end capping complex . It does not inhibit pointed - end growth or depolymerization by high - affinity binding ( 10 9 M – 1 ; ref . 15 ) to pointed ends , and does not increase the pointed - end critical concentration . This conclusion is in agreement with our previous report of the active turnover of filaments in the presence of actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , Arp2 / 3 and gelsolin 27 . Discussion We have shown that WA - activated Arp2 / 3 branches actin filaments from the barbed ends rather than from the sides , generating a fractal growth pattern generally known as ‘diffusion - limited aggrega - tion’ 19 . Both polymerization kinetics and electron - microscopic observations are quantitatively consistent with this model , which fits the polymerization curves over a range of Arp2 / 3 concentra - tions spanning two orders of magnitude . Kinetic data show that WA - activated Arp2 / 3 does not actually nucleate filaments ; instead , as soon as a nucleus is formed , its barbed end is duplicated through high - affinity binding of the WA – actin – Arp2 / 3 complex . Hence , Arp2 / 3 organizes the local concentration and multiplication of barbed ends at the leading edge of the cell or at the surfaces of Lis - teria and Shigella . Barbed - end branching by Arp2 / 3 readily accounts for the endwise morphogenesis of the branched , dendritic array of filaments from the leading edge . Barbed - end nuclei , which are spontaneously formed at the high concentration of G - actin maintained by ADF and capping proteins 13 , 26 – 28 , interact with the PIP 2 / Cdc42 - activated N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex at the membrane . This machinery multiplies barbed ends as they grow , generating a branched pattern of filaments that exert pressure on the membrane , as observed in lamellipodia 14 . The similarly branched array formed at the surfaces of Listeria and Shigella can be visualized in vitro when the decommissioning action of capping proteins is deliberately lim - ited . Once branching is effected , Arp2 / 3 remains incorporated in the lattice at the branches 14 , whereas N - WASP ( or its substitute WA , in the present in vitro studies ) dissociates 11 . Whether the Arp2 / 3 present at branches is structurally part of the mother filament or of the daughter filament is an open issue . A tentative model , on the basis of the present data and illustrating the first case as an example , is shown in Fig . 6 . Only 25 % of the filaments generated by branching were found to be associated with the ‘mother’ filament . Debranching of fila - ments must therefore be a frequent process in vitro . Debranching may also be important in vivo to control the morphogenesis and rapid remodelling of filament arrays found in diverse actin - based structures such as filopodia , lamellipodia , and the actin tails of Lis - teria and Rickettsia 29 . Whether Arp2 / 3 remains associated with the mother filament ( as in Fig . 6 ) or with the pointed end of the daugh - ter branch after debranching is not known . In both cases , Arp2 / 3 could be transiently bound at the pointed end of treadmilling fila - ments . However , these results , as well as previous data 27 , indicate that Arp2 / 3 does not function as a pointed - end - capping complex that blocks pointed - end depolymerization and treadmilling . The reason that Arp2 / 3 was initially reported to be a strong pointed - end capper inhibiting pointed - end growth and increasing pointed - end critical concentration remains unclear and may be concerned with either the origin or the purification procedure of Arp2 / 3 . One pos - sibility is that the amoeba Arp2 / 3 eluted from a poly - L - proline column 15 was contaminated with profilin , which acts as a sequester - ing protein when barbed ends are capped . The functional antagonism between Arp2 / 3 and capping pro - teins at barbed ends is essential in regulating motility . Arp2 / 3 prop - agates growing barbed ends and lowers the critical concentration , whereas capping proteins arrest barbed - end growth and increase the critical concentration . Our data may explain why Cdc42 - induced filaments in neutrophil extracts seem to be protected from capping 30 . The antagonism between Arp2 / 3 and capping proteins is not a trivial competition , however . Paradoxically , Arp2 / 3 creates binding sites for capping proteins . Hence , the amount of capping protein bound to filaments increases in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , while Arp2 / 3 simultaneously maintains a steady excess of free over capped barbed ends . h Methods Proteins . Actin was isolated from rabbit muscle and purified in the CaATP – G - actin form by Sephadex G - 200 chromatography in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris – Cl – pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) . Actin was fluorescently labelled with pyrenyl - iodoacetamide 31 . CaATP – G - actin was converted into MgATP – G - actin by adding 20 m M MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA to a 10 m M CaATP – G - actin solution in G buffer . The C - terminal domain ( WA or VCA ) of human N - WASP was expressed as a gultathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - fused recombinant protein and separated from the GST moiety by proteolytic cleavage 11 . Profilin and thymosin b 4 were purified from bovine spleen 32 , the Arp2 / 3 complex from bovine brain 11 , capping protein from bovine erythrocytes 33 , and spectrin – actin seeds from human erythrocytes 34 . Concentrations of spectrin – actin , gelsolin - capped filaments and standard F - actin seeds were determined by growth - rate measurements in the presence of 2 . 5 m M G - actin , using the conventional values of the association rate constants of G - actin to the barbed and pointed ends 35 . Gelsolin was a gift from Y . Doi ( University of Kyoto , Japan ) . Polymerization assays . Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 5 – 10 % pyrenyl - labelled actin . Polymerization was induced by addition of 0 . 1 M KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 to a solution of MgATP – G - actin containing Arp2 / 3 and WA . Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20 (cid:176) C in a Safas flx spectrofluorometer in which polymerization time courses of up to ten samples could be monitored simultaneously . The time dependence of the concentration of filament ends , [ F ] ( t ) , is derived from the rate of assembly , measured at each time as the first derivative of the time course of fluorescence change as follows : d C w ( t ) / d t = – d C ( t ) / d t = k + [ F ] ( t ) · ( C ( t ) – C c ) where k + is the rate constant for association of G - actin to a filament end , [ F ] ( t ) is the concentration of filament ends at time t , C ( t ) is the concentration of monomeric actin at time t and C w ( t ) is the mass of F - actin at time t , derived from the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl – actin . C ( t ) is calculated at each time point as C ( t ) = C 0 – C w ( t ) , where C 0 is the total actin concentration { AU : what does C c denote ? } . The average filament length ( in m m ) is given by < l ( t ) > = { C w ( t ) / [ F ] ( t ) } / 370 . Counting of barbed and pointed ends during actin polymerization . Actin ( 10 % , pyrenyl - labelled ) was polymerized at 2 . 5 m M as described above , in the presence of 10 nM Arp2 / 3 and 0 . 5 m M WA . Aliquots were removed from the polymerizing solution at various times during the polymerization process and placed as seeds of assembly in a solution of 2 m M MgATP – G - actin ( 10 % , pyrenyl - labelled ) in F buffer ( G buffer with 0 . 1 M KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , in the presence or absence of 35 nM capping protein . Because measurements of pointed - end growth were made over a longer period than those of barbed - end growth , a small correction was made for the spontaneous , weak nucleation of pointed ends that was observed in the absence of seeds in solutions of 2 m M G - actin and 35 nM capping protein . Concentrations of barbed or pointed ends were derived from measurements of the initial rate of elongation as follows : Standard solutions of F - actin were used to calibrate the assay . In these solutions , barbed and pointed ends are in equal amounts , hence the ratio of the initial rates of growth measured in the absence and presence of capping protein , r 0 , was taken as a reference . The concentration of barbed ends was derived from measurement of the initial rate of growth using the equation V i = k + · [ F ] · ( C – C c ) , where k + = 10 m M – 1 s – 1 ( ref . 35 ) . When filaments were polymerized in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , branching resulted in a ratio of barbed - end growth rate to pointed - end growth rate , r , that was greater than r 0 . If n is the number of barbed ends and b the number of branching points , the number of free pointed ends is n – b , hence r = r 0 · n / ( n – b ) . The extent of branching , b / n = 1 – ( r 0 / r ) , can be derived from measurements of r and r 0 . Electron microscopy .
