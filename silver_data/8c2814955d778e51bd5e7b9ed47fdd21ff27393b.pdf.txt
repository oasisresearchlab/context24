Introduction Coﬁlin belonging to the actin - depolymerization factor ( ADF ) 2 / Coﬁ - lin family is a 20 kDa actin - binding protein in eukaryotic cells . There are two Coﬁlin isoforms in different developmental stages or organ - isms , among which Coﬁlin1 , a non - muscle type , is predominantly ex - pressed in embryonic and adult cells , while Coﬁlin2 is widely distributed in muscle cells such as heart and skeletal muscle [ 1 – 3 ] . Coﬁlin was ﬁrst isolated in 1984 from porcine brain and named for itsabilitytobindandco - sedimentwithﬁlamentousactin ( co - ﬁlamen - tous with actin ) [ 4 , 5 ] . Previous evidences suggest that Coﬁlin contrib - utes to various essential physiological processes in normal cells , includingcytokinesis , endocytosis , apoptosis , cellmigration andadhe - sion , via its ability to regulate actin cytoskeleton [ 6 – 10 ] . It is also widely accepted that Coﬁlin plays a crucial role in cancer invasion and metastasis [ 11 , 12 ] . Recent studies found that altering the expres - sion or activity of Coﬁlin might lead to the progression of various dis - eases , and measuring the level of Coﬁlin in tumor cells might be necessary to assess the efﬁcacy of the anticancer drugs [ 13 , 14 ] . Regulation of actin cytoskeleton assembly and disassembly is complex , involving various actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) [ 15 , 16 ] . Formation of ternary complexes of Coﬁlin , G - actin , and DNase I has been demonstrated by using native PAGE gels , which could be applied for assessing the activity of Coﬁlin in vitro [ 17 ] . The afﬁnity of active Coﬁlin for actin can be increased when actin forms binary complexes with DNase I [ 18 ] . Thus , when Coﬁlin presents in a mixture of actin - DNase I complex and free actin , it prefers to bind to the binary complex forming a ternary complex than to bind to the remaining free actin . Actually , Coﬁlin and DNase I simulta - neously attach to G - actin , as they bind to different sites of the mol - ecule [ 19 ] . Moreover , a greater afﬁnity of Coﬁlin – actin - DNase I ternary complex depends on the balance of free Ca 2 + , ATP and pH in vitro [ 20 ] . To further elucidate the structural and functional relationship of Coﬁlin1 in human cell , a convenient and efﬁcient method for obtaining recombinant human Coﬁlin1 with high activity must be established . In this study , human Coﬁlin1 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and rapidly puriﬁed by a one - step Ni – NTA afﬁnity chromatography . The puriﬁed protein displayed high biological activity and immunogenicity . Material and methods Reagents and animal DNA restriction enzymes , T4 DNA ligase , Taq DNA polymerase , DNase I ( DNase I protease and RNase free ) , PCR puriﬁcation and gel extraction kits were purchased from TaKaRa ( Japan ) .

E . coli DH5 a and IPTG were purchased from Promega ( USA ) . Actin , Freund’s complete adjuvant ( FCA ) and Fre - und’s incomplete adjuvant ( FIA ) were purchased from Sigma ( USA ) . New Zealand rabbits were purchased from Guangdong Med - icine Laboratory Animal Center . Primers were synthesized by San - gon Company ( China ) . All other chemicals were of analytical grade . Plasmid construction Total RNAs of Hela cells were extracted by TRIzol reagent ( Invit - rogen , USA ) and reverse transcribed using the PrimeScript RT re - agent Kit ( Takara , Japan ) . The Coﬁlin1 cDNA strand corresponding to the mature Coﬁlin1 was ampliﬁed by PCR . The primers used for PCR ampliﬁcation were : Coﬁlin1 sense primer ( 5 0 - AAGTCGACATATGGCCTCCGGTGTG - 3 0 ) , and Coﬁlin1 antisense primer ( 5 0 - TCTCTCGAGGGCTCACAAAGGCTTG - 3 0 ) , where the underlined nucleotides were digestion sites for the restriction en - zymes Nde I and Xho I , respectively . The reaction was carried out under following conditions : initial denaturation at 94 (cid:3) C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 (cid:3) C for 30 s , annealing at 65 (cid:3) C for 40 s and extension at 68 (cid:3) C for 40 s . The PCR product was digested with Nde I and Xho I , and then ligated into pET - 28a ( + ) between the Nde I and Xho I restriction sites . The ligated products were ampliﬁed in E . coli DH5 a . The positive re - combinant clones were identiﬁed by PCR , restriction enzyme anal - ysis and ﬁnally conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . Expression of Coﬁlin1 in E . coli To optimize the induction conditions , a single colony of the cells was cultured in 50 mL LB medium containing kanamycin ( 50 l g / mL ) at 37 (cid:3) C and grown with constantly shaking at 180 rpm / min in a constant temperature oscillator ( XHX - 82 , XinJia , China ) . When the OD600 of each ﬂask reached 0 . 8 , the bacterial culture was re - moved as a negative control . For IPTG optimization , the bacterial culture was induced with different concentrations of IPTG ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 8 , 1 . 0 , 1 . 5 , and 2 . 0 mM ) and cultured at 37 (cid:3) C for 4 h . For temperature optimization , the bacterial culture was induced with 1 . 0 mM IPTG and cultured at four different temperatures ( 20 , 25 , 30 and 37 (cid:3) C ) for 8 h . For time optimization , the bacterial culture was induced with 1 . 0 mM IPTG and cultured at 20 (cid:3) C for 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , and 24 h , respectively . The sample from each opti - mization experiment was collected and the absorbance at 600 nm was determined in order to monitor bacterial growth . The expres - sion levels were analyzed by 12 % SDS – PAGE . Protein puriﬁcation After induction under optimized condition , the cells were har - vested by centrifugation with 8000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C . Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 : 10 volume of PBS buffer ( 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 8 ) and lysed by sonication on ice at 600 W for 30 min ( sonication for 3 s and intermission for 6 s ) . The soluble and the insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 17 , 000 g for 30 min at 4 (cid:3) C . Both pro - tein fractions of cell lysate were analyzed by 12 % SDS – PAGE . The puriﬁcation of the recombinant human Coﬁlin1 was based on the His - tag protocol . The supernatant was loaded onto the Ni – NTA column , which was pre - equilibrated with ﬁve column vol - umes of PBS buffer . After incubation for 1 h at 4 (cid:3) C , loosely bound contaminants were removed from the Ni – NTA columns with PBS buffer containing 30 mM imidazole until the 280 nm absorbance returned to the baseline . Subsequently , the target protein was eluted with PBS buffer containing 300 mM imidazole at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL / min . The fraction containing target protein was further pooled and desalted by a Sephadex G - 25 column . This was done to eliminate remaining salt and imidazole . Puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 was lyophilized and stored at (cid:3) 20 (cid:3) C . The fraction from each step was visualized by 12 % SDS – PAGE . Western blot analysis Puriﬁed protein was electrophoresed in a 12 % SDS – PAGE , and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ( PVDF ) mem - brane by a Bio - Rad apparatus at 100 mA for 1 h . The membrane was blocked with 5 % defated milk in PBST buffer ( 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 05 % Tween20 ) for 2 h at room temperature . After incubated with rabbit anti - Coﬁ - lin1 antibody ( Medical & Biological Laboratories Co . , Ltd . , Japan ) at 4 (cid:3) C overnight , the membrane was incubated with HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature . Protein bands were then detected by using enhanced HRP - DAB kit ( Tiangen , China ) . Native PAGE The biological activity of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 was analyzed by na - tive ( non - denaturing ) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) . Actin was mixed with excess DNase I to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 and 16 l M , respectively . Increasing amounts of Coﬁlin1 ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 l M ) were titrated into a mixture of ac - tin - DNase I complex and free actin . Native PAGE was performed by using a Bio - Rad Mini - Protean II system . The stacking gel contained 4 % acrylamide in 80 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) and the separating gel comprised 10 % acrylamide in 300 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 8 ) . Titrations were performed in 16 l L samples of G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 3 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) . The gels were bathed in running buffer ( 25 mM Tris pH 8 . 3 , 250 mM gly - cine , 0 . 3 mM ATP 0 . 3 mM CaCl 2 ) and samples were run at 70 V for 5 h at 0 – 4 (cid:3) C by packing the gel apparatus in ice bath . As these gels were performed under non - denaturing conditions , non - cova - lent interactions between proteins were not disrupted . Conse - quently , migration of isolated proteins and protein complexes were determined by their charge – density ratio and conformation , rather than their apparent molecular weights as they are in SDS – PAGE . Immunogenicity analysis and preparation of polyclonal rabbit Coﬁlin1 antibody To determine the immunogenic nature of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 , New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with 1 . 0 mg of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 in Complete Freund’s Adjuvant ( CFA ) via intradermal injection ( total dose = 250 l g / rabbit ) , and given other three injec - tions of same amount of Coﬁlin1 with Incomplete Freund’s Adju - vant ( IFA ) at 2 weeks intervals . The rabbits were bled 2 weeks after the last immunization . The titer of polyclonal antiserum raised against Coﬁlin1 was analyzed by enzyme - linked immuno - sorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Brieﬂy , The 96 - well plates were coated with 1 l g / mL of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . After blocking with 5 % BSA , the wells were incubated with polyclonal anti - Coﬁlin1 antiserum for 2 h at 37 (cid:3) C . Following the thoroughly washing , HRP conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG was incubated for 2 h at 37 (cid:3) C . Finally , TMB was added to each well in the dark at 37 (cid:3) C for 10 min . The color reaction was stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 before measuring the absorbance at 450 nm in microplate reader ( Bio - Rad 550 ) . Antisera were precipitated with 50 % , 40 % and 33 % ammonium sulfate saturation for 3 h at 4 (cid:3) C , respectively . After desalination , IgG fractions were puriﬁed by DEAE - Sephadex chromatography and analyzed by SDS – PAGE . The speciﬁcity of anti - Coﬁlin1antibody J . - X . Lu et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 82 ( 2012 ) 186 – 191 187 was analyzed for detection of MEF cells and Hela cells by Western blot , with the recombinant Coﬁlin1 protein used as a positive control . Results Cloning and expression of human Coﬁlin1 PCR ampliﬁcation and double enzymes digestion were con - ducted to examine the recombinant plasmid . As shown in Fig . 1A , the size of target fragment from double digestion of pET - 28a ( + ) - Coﬁlin1 was about 500 bp , the same as the PCR product . DNA sequencing further conﬁrmed that the recombinant plasmid was constructed correctly ( data not shown ) . Recombinant plasmid was then transformed into expression host E . coli BL21 for protein expression . Expression induction revealed the increased presence of a band with an approximate molecular weight of 20 kDa , the size expected for Coﬁlin1 protein ( Fig . 1B ) . Optimization of the expression conditions for Coﬁlin1 in E . coli BL21 was conducted by varying IPTG concentrations , culture tem - peratures and induction time . As shown in Fig . 1C , the expression level of Coﬁlin1 increased as the increase of IPTG concentration at the temperature of 37 (cid:3) C , while increase of induction tempera - ture did not result in obvious improvement of expression when 1 . 0 mM IPTG were used . Besides , with the induction by 1 . 0 mM IPTG at 20 (cid:3) C , the amount of Coﬁlin1 increased as the extension of induction time , and its proportion in the total proteins at 20 h as quantiﬁed by densitometry was 33 % , which was almost the same as that at 24 h . Thus , human Coﬁlin1 was successfully ex - pressed in E . coli BL21 and the optimized induction conditions were identiﬁed ( 1 mM IPTG at 20 (cid:3) C for 20 h ) . Puriﬁcation of recombinant protein Coﬁlin1 Before puriﬁcation , the expression of the recombinant human Coﬁlin1 protein was efﬁciently accomplished by induction with 1 mM IPTG at 20 (cid:3) C for 20 h . Following cell disruption and centri - fugation , most of the Coﬁlin1 was found in soluble form ( Fig . 2B , lane 1 ) . Thus , the supernatant fraction was applied to the afﬁnity chromatography in chelated Ni + resin , as described in detail in the method section above . A brief workﬂow of the puriﬁcation pro - cess was shown in Fig . 2A . Large amounts of Coﬁlin1 were efﬁ - ciently bound to the Ni – NTA resin , while only a small amount was lost in the ﬂow - through ( Fig . 2B , lane 2 ) . The 30 mM imidazole wash was successful in the removal of contaminating proteins ( Fig . 2B , lane 3 ) . Increasing the imidazole concentration to 300 mM , majority of Coﬁlin1 was then eluted , only several very faint additional bands were observed ( Fig . 2B , lane 4 ) . Following gel ﬁltration , approximately 23 . 4 mg of Coﬁlin1 was puriﬁed from a 300 ml LB medium , giving a yield of 78 mg / L . Western blotting conﬁrmed the identity of the Coﬁlin1 protein ( Fig . 2C ) . These re - sults indicate that solubly expressed Coﬁlin1 was rapidly and efﬁ - ciently puriﬁed by using the one - step Ni – NTA afﬁnity chromatography process . Activity evaluation of recombinant Coﬁlin1 The biological activity of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 was further assayed by using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . In native PAGE gel , free actin migrated as a single band ( Fig . 3 , lane 1 ) . When DNase I was mixed with excess actin , a new band corresponding to the actin - DNase I complex was appeared ( Fig . 3 , lane 2 ) . As re - combinant protein Coﬁlin1 was progressively titrated into a mix - ture of actin - DNase I and free actin , another new band of increasing intensity corresponding to Coﬁlin1 – actin - DNase I ter - nary complex was formed ( Fig . 3 , lane 3 – 8 ) . When the Coﬁlin - actin binary complex was formed , the amount of free actin began to de - crease . Meanwhile , the ternary complex became saturated ( Fig . 3 , lane 9 ) . When Coﬁlin1 was loaded in the gel alone , it migrated abnormally ( data not shown ) , which was consistent with earlier reports [ 18 ] . These results demonstrated that the Coﬁlin1 protein expressed and puriﬁed possessed good bioactivity . Immunogenicity analysis of recombinant Coﬁlin1 The immunogenicity of obtained Coﬁlin1 was assayed by immu - nizing rabbits . Rabbits were immunized four times by the puriﬁed protein and the antisera were pooled after the last immunizations . The immunized rabbits produced a high titer of antiserum against the puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 as determined by ELISA , where the titers reached up to 1 : 128 , 000 ( Fig . 4 ) . At the same time , preimmunized rabbit serum as a negative control did not display signal , indicating that puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 displayed good immunogenicity . After anti - body puriﬁcation , the heavy chains and the light chains of IgG were identiﬁed on SDS – PAGE ( Fig . 5A ) . Coﬁlin1 protein in whole lysis of MEF cells or SK - N - SH cells was then analyzed by Western blotting using our puriﬁed antibody . A single band corresponding to the ex - pected size of Coﬁlin1 was detected in both lyses , while the same band was present in E . coli ( Fig . 5B ) . Overall , these results indicate that Coﬁlin1 obtained preserved high immunogenicity . Fig . 1 . Cloning , expression and optimizationof induction conditionsfor Coﬁlin1 .

Lu et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 82 ( 2012 ) 186 – 191 Discussion Coﬁlin1 has been reported to play a predominant role in pro - moting rapid F - actin de - polymerization in mammalian non - mus - cle cells [ 21 ] . In particular , increased Coﬁlin1 expression has been detected in some cancer tissues . It was demonstrated that Coﬁlin1 mRNA is up regulated in breast tumor and esophageal tu - mor [ 22 – 24 ] , and the protein level is also higher in tumor cells than in normal cells [ 25 – 27 ] . Emerging evidences show that alter - ation of regulators associated with Coﬁlin1 appeared to increase risk for multiple human diseases [ 28 – 31 ] . For virus infection , our previous research also shown that down - regulation of Coﬁlin1 might be involved in the inhibition of herpes simplex virus infec - tion [ 32 ] . Thus , the investigation of human Coﬁlin1 may cast new light on bringing better outcomes to therapeutic intervention . Coﬁlin was ﬁrst puriﬁed from porcine brain by DNase I afﬁnity chromatography [ 4 ] . Recently , chicken Coﬁlin was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E . coli XLI - Blue and puriﬁed with glutathi - one - Sepharose column , but the yield and purity was not published [ 18 ] . In the present study , a 6 (cid:2) His tag was added to the N - termi - nus of the human Coﬁlin1 coding sequence , which has not been de - scribed in any previous reports before . His tag , a small puriﬁcation partner , has been suggested to decrease the time and cost of pro - tein production process without affecting protein well folding and bioactivity . By exploring the induction conditions , it was found that recom - binant Coﬁlin1 expression mainly depended on IPTG concentration and induction period , although when IPTG concentration was high - er than 1 . 0 mM , the increase rate of Coﬁlin1 was less than cell den - sity ( data not shown ) . In contrast , increase of induction temperature did not obviously improve the expression level . Gen - erally , the protein tends to be expressed as soluble form at lower temperature , but the rate of expressing is more slowly for correct folding . Now that culturing at lower temperatures are beneﬁcial Fig . 2 . Puriﬁcation of recombinant Coﬁlin1 . ( A ) Workﬂow of Coﬁlin1 puriﬁcation . ( B ) SDS – PAGE analysis of Coﬁlin1 puriﬁcation .

Actin - DNase I titration in the presence of Coﬁlin1 . Lane 1 free actin ( 20 l M ) ; Lane 2 – 9 contain a mixture of 20 l M actin and 16 l M DNase I and increasing concentrations of Coﬁlin1 ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 l M , respectively ) . J . - X . Lu et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 82 ( 2012 ) 186 – 191 189 to stabilization of structure and expression of soluble protein , and that increase of temperature did not signiﬁcantly enhance Coﬁlin1 expression , the following induction was conducted at 20 (cid:3) C . Over - all , after several attempts to determine the optimal conditions , the highest amount of Coﬁlin1 was produced by induction with 1 mM IPTG at 20 (cid:3) C for 20 h . After optimized expression , protein puriﬁcation was achieved using nickel afﬁnity chromatography and anion exchange chroma - tography . To ensure a reasonable yield and purity of Coﬁlin1 , we adjusted the imidazole concentrations in the puriﬁcation buffers to ensure a reasonable yield and purity of Coﬁlin1 ( data not shown ) . It was found that the puriﬁcation was the most efﬁcient when using 30 and 300 mM imidazole in the washing and elution buffers , respectively . Besides , the pH value was another critical fac - tor for the puriﬁcation process . Speciﬁcally , when the pH value of puriﬁcation buffers was close to 8 . 0 , which is the isoelectric point of Coﬁlin1 , the puriﬁed protein solution became turbid during stor - age , forming white and visible aggregates . Considering that the puriﬁcation occurred at pH 8 . 0 might affect the native structure of Coﬁlin1 protein , the pH value of puriﬁcation buffers was dropped to 7 . 8 . Overall , after puriﬁcation , over 78 mg of Coﬁlin1 protein could be successfully obtained from 1 L culture . The bioactivity of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 was examined in vitro by na - tive PAGE , in which Coﬁlin1 displayed well activity of forming ter - nary complexes with G - actin and DNase I , indicating that puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 preserved good binding afﬁnity . We also found that the afﬁnity of puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 with actin could be increased when ac - tin forms binary complexes with DNase I , consisting with earlier reports . These ﬁndings indicate that the recombinant Coﬁlin1 pre - served correct folding , because its interaction with other ABPs re - mained unaffected . Further , high titer of polyclonal antibodies was detected by ELISA assay with puriﬁed Coﬁlin1 , demonstrating the good immunogenicity of the protein and speciﬁcity of the anti - body . Western blot demonstrated that the homemade antibody could detect endogenous Coﬁlin1 protein expressed in eukaryotic cells ( MEF and Hela ) . In summary , this is the ﬁrst report on the expression and puri - ﬁcation of human Coﬁlin1 in bacteria with his - tag . We established a cheap , highly reproducible puriﬁcation protocol , which could be easily scaled up since they are based on small - volume afﬁnity chromatographic columns . These results might provide an essen - tial basis for further clariﬁcation of the Coﬁlin1 function .
