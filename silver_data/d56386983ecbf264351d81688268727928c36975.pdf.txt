Rodgers TLR4 signaling must be tightly regulated to provide both effective immune protection and avoid inﬂammation - induced pathology . Thus , the mechanisms that negatively regulate the TLR4 - triggered inﬂammatory response are of particular importance . Glia mat - uration factor - g ( GMFG ) , a novel actin depolymerization factor / coﬁlin superfamily protein that is expressed in inﬂammatory cells , has been implicated in mediating neutrophil and T cell migration , but its function in macrophage immune response remains unclear . In the current study , the role of GMFG in the LPS - induced TLR4 - signaling pathway was investigated in THP - 1 macro - phages and human primary macrophages . LPS stimulation of macrophages decreased GMFG mRNA and protein expression . We show that GMFG negatively regulates LPS - induced activation of NF - k B – , MAPK - , and IRF3 - signaling pathways and subsequent production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and type I IFN in human macrophages . We found that endogenous GMFG localized within early and late endosomes . GMFG knockdown delayed LPS - induced TLR4 internalization and caused prolonged TLR4 retention at the early endosome , suggesting that TLR4 transport from early to late endosomes is interrupted , which may contribute to enhanced LPS - induced TLR4 signaling . Taken together , our ﬁndings suggest that GMFG functions as a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling by facilitating TLR4 endocytic trafﬁcking in macrophages . The Journal of Immunology , 2013 , 190 : 6093 – 6103 . T oll - like receptors , which are broadly distributed on the cells of the immune system , play a critical role in innate and adaptive immune responses through recognition of pathogenic molecules and triggering of an inﬂammatory response ( 1 , 2 ) . TLR4 is the most extensively studied TLR in both innate immunity and signal transduction . It senses LPS from Gram - negative bacteria and initiates two separate signaling pathways through the recruitment of MyD88 or TRIF , which eventually induces the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and type I IFN by activation of NF - k B , MAPK , and IRF3 ( 3 , 4 ) . LPS - induced TLR4 signaling is tightly controlled to prevent exces - sive inﬂammation and to allow for tissue repair and the return to homeostasis postinfection . Uncontrolled or prolonged activation of TLR4 can have devastating consequences , including the de - velopment of immunopathological conditions , such as autoim - mune diseases and lethal Gram - negative septic shock ( 5 , 6 ) . Accordingly , much attention has focused on investigating how to negatively regulate TLR4 - signaling pathways ( 7 ) . Although ex - tensive studies revealed that the negative regulation of TLR4 signaling occurs through various mechanisms ( 8 ) , regulation of the ﬁne - tuning of TLR4 - induced signaling by endocytosis and the factors that restrict these processes remain largely unclear . Endocytic trafﬁcking in the TLR4 - signaling pathway recently emerged as a key feature of TLR4 function . Upon LPS stimulation , TLR4 initiates the ﬁrst MyD88 - dependent signaling pathway at the plasma membrane and is subsequently internalized , along with LPS , into the early / sorting endosome network , where the second signaling pathway is triggered through TRIF and TRIF - related adaptor molecule ( 9 – 11 ) . TLR4 is then either sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes for its degradation or sent to recycling compartments to be returned to the plasma membrane . Accord - ingly , LPS - induced endocytosis of TLR4 is essential for its sig - naling function . Recent studies revealed that Rab family members regulate TLR4 trafﬁcking . For example , Rab7b localizes to the late endosomes , where it negatively regulates TLR4 trafﬁcking to late endosomes for degradation ( 12 ) . Rab10 localizes to both the Golgi and early endosomes , where it regulates TLR4 signaling by promoting transport of TLR4 from the Golgi to the plasma mem - brane ( 13 ) . Rab11a is enriched in pericentriolar - recycling endo - somes and is essential for the trafﬁcking of TLR4 into the Rab11a + endocytic recycling compartment ( 14 ) . Although these GTPase Rabs facilitate vesicle intracellular trafﬁcking , little is known about the surrounding cytoskeletal proteins that regulate endosomal traf - ﬁcking and the degradation pathway of the TLR4 receptor . Glia maturation factor - g ( GMFG ) , a newly recognized actin depolymerization factor / coﬁlin superfamily protein , is not in - volved in the development of glia or the formation of gliomas ; rather , it is predominantly expressed in inﬂammatory cells and microendothelial cells ( 15 ) . GMF is a highly conserved protein throughout the eukaryotes from yeast to mammals , with two isoforms being expressed in mammals : GMFB and GMFG . Our previous study ( 16 ) and other investigators ( 17 ) suggested that GMFG mediates neutrophil and T lymphocyte migration via regu - lation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization . Functional studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that yeast GMF promotes debranching of actin ﬁlaments and inhibits new actin assembly through binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 18 ) . Recent studies dem - onstrated that the Arp2 / 3 complex and its regulating factors are involved in endosomal dynamics , as well as intracellular protein trafﬁcking ( 19 , 20 ) . In the current study , we examined the role of GMFG in LPS - initiated TLR4 signaling in human macrophages .

Materials and Methods Cells and cultures The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP - 1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS , 50 m M 2 - ME , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin at 37˚C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere , consisting of 5 % CO 2 , and passed every 2 – 3 d to maintain logarithmic growth . THP - 1 – derived macrophages were obtained by stimulating THP - 1 monocytes ( 5 3 10 5 / ml ) with 100 ng / ml PMA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 3 d . Human monocytes were isolated from healthy adult donors according to aprotocolapprovedbytheInstitutionalReviewBoardoftheNationalHeart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes for Health , and consistent with federal regulations . Monocytes were isolated by Ficoll - Paque ( GE Healthcare ) density centrifugation and magnetically sorted using CD14 + magnetic beads ( MACS ; Miltenyi Biotec ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Isolated monocytes were counted and were 85 – 95 % CD14 + cells . Primary human macrophages were generated by differentiation of CD14 + monocytes in complete culture medium ( RPMI 1640 with 10 % human AB serum , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin ) supplemented with 10 ng / ml recombinant human GM - CSF ( R & D Systems ) . The medium was changed 3 d after seeding , and cells developed the macrophage phenotype after 7 d in culture . Isolation of RNA and quantitative PCR Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit ( QIAGEN ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For reverse transcription , 1 m g total RNA / sample was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) , following the manufacturer’s guidelines . Quantitative PCR ( Q - PCR ) reactions ( MyiQ iCycler ; Bio - Rad ) were per - formed using prevalidated TaqMan primer / probe sets purchased as Assays - on - Demand gene - expression products from Applied Biosystems . Real - time PCR conditions were 5 min at 95˚C and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95˚C , followed by 1 min at 60˚C . RNA copy numbers were calculated by comparison to standard curves generated from plasmid DNA – encoding GMFG and control b - actin templates . RNA interference and plasmid constructions Day 1 – differentiated THP - 1 macrophages ( 2 3 10 6 cells ) or primary hu - man macrophages ( 2 3 10 6 cells ) were transiently transfected with a GMFG small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , negative - control siRNA , GMFG - GFP plasmid , or GFP empty vector , using the Nucleofector Kit V and Nucleofector I Program U - 01 ( Amaxa Biosystems ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . GMFG siRNA ( Silencer Select siRNA s18303 ) and negative - control siRNA ( Neg - siRNA # 2 ) were obtained from Applied Biosystems . The cells were continually cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FBS and 100 ng / ml PMA for 48 h prior to use . Cytokine assays THP - 1 macrophages were stimulated with 100 ng / ml LPS for the indicated time periods . The levels of TNF - a , IL - 6 , IFN - b , and IL - 10 in culture supernatants were measured using commercial ELISA kits from BD Biosciences , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Luciferase reporter assay The determinations of NF - k B activity were performed as previously de - scribed ( 21 , 22 ) . Immunoblotting analysis THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macrophages were lysed in RIPA protein extraction reagent ( Pierce Biotechnology ) , as recommended by the manufacturer . Equal amounts of total protein ( 40 m g / lane ) were separated on 4 – 20 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods . Membranes were probed with pri - mary Abs for GMFG ( ABGENT ) , TLR4 ( Abcam ) , b - actin , phosphory - lated forms of Erk1 / 2 ( Thr202 / Tyr204 ) , p38 ( Thr180 / Tyr182 ) , JNK1 / 2 ( Thr183 / Tyr185 ) , IRF3 ( Ser396 ) , NF - k B p65 , and I k B a ( Ser32 / 36 ) , total p38 , NF - k B , or I k B a ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . HRP - conjugated anti - mouse , - rabbit , or - goat IgG secondary Abs and the Amersham ECL Western blotting system ( GE Healthcare ) were used for detection . Den - sitometric quantiﬁcation of signals on blotting membranes was performed using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Flow cytometry analysis To detect cell surface expression of TLR4 , PMA - differentiated THP - 1 macrophages were treated or not with 100 ng / ml LPS for 1 h , dissoci - ated , blocked in 5 % BSA for 30 min , stained with FITC - conjugated anti - TLR4 ( Imgenex ) or IgG2a Ab for 30 min on ice , washed , and analyzed by EPICS ELITE ESP ﬂow cytometry ( Beckman Coulter ) ; the data were analyzed using CellQuest software ( BD Biosciences ) . Cell surface ex - pression of TLR4 was quantiﬁed as the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of the FITC + cells by FACS assay . Immunoﬂuorescence staining and confocal microscopy THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macrophages were transfected with control siRNA or GMFG siRNA for 48 h . The cells were then treated with 100 ng / ml LPS for the indicated time periods . Following treatment , cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS for 20 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 10 min , and preblocked in 10 % FBS / PBS for 1 h . For TLR4 staining , after ﬁxation with 4 % paraformaldehyde , cells were ﬁxed with ice - cold methanol for 20 min . Cell were then stained with mouse monoclonal anti - TLR4 Ab ( Abcam ; 1 : 100 ) for 3 h , followed by staining with rabbit anti - Rab5 , anti - Rab4 , or anti - Rab7 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) for 1 h . After washes , the cells were stained with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 anti - mouse or Alexa Fluor 594 anti - rabbit Ab ( Invitrogen ) , diluted 1 : 500 , for 1 h at room temperature . Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI ( Sigma ) for 5 min . For the colocalization analysis of GMFG and organelle markers , cells were sequentially immunostained with GMFG Ab overnight at 4˚C and stained with Ab against EEA1 , Rab5 , Rab7 , Golgi marker GM130 ( BD Pharmingen ) , or endoplasmic reticulum marker PDI ( Invitrogen ) , followed by staining with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated or Alexa Fluor 594 – conjugated secondary Ab ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope equipped with 405 - , 488 - , 594 - , and 633 - nm lasers and Zen 2009 imaging software , using a 63 3 / 1 . 3 NA oil - immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss ) . Quantitative coloc - alization analysis was performed using Imaris 7 . 6 software ( Bitplane ) . Dual - color scattergrams and the percentage of colocalization were mea - sured using the Pearson coefﬁcient to evaluate the overlap in ﬂuorescence of TLR4 or GMFG with other endosome markers from four images taken from two independent experiments . Subcellular fractionation For subcellular fractionation , THP - 1 macrophages were placed on ice , rinsed twice with ice - cold PBS , and subjected to Percoll density - gradient cell fractionation and centrifugation , which were performed as previ - ously described ( 12 ) . A total of 12 fractions was collected , starting from the top of the gradient . For immunoblotting analysis of each fraction , equal aliquots from each fraction were resolved by SDS - PAGE and then trans - ferred to nitrocellulose , according to standard techniques . Statistical analysis The Student t test was used to analyze data for signiﬁcant differences . The p values , 0 . 05 were regarded as statistically signiﬁcant . Results GMFG is downregulated by LPS stimulation in macrophages GMFG is expressed mainly in inﬂammatory cells and micro - endothelial cells , but its biological function , especially in the innate immune response in macrophages , remains unclear . To explore the possible functions of GMFG in the TLR4 - signaling pathway , we ﬁrst investigated whether GMFG could be regulated by LPS in human macrophages . In primary human macrophages , we found a substantial decrease in expression of GMFG mRNA and protein after stimulation with 100 ng / ml LPS for 4 h that remained low over 24 h ( Fig . 1A ) . The inhibitory effect at 4 h was concentration de - pendent and was evident at a range of LPS concentrations from 100 to 1000 ng / ml ( Fig . 1B ) . We further veriﬁed this effect in THP - 1 macrophages produced through PMA stimulation of THP - 1 mono - cytes . Similarly , expression of GMFG mRNA and protein decreased in these cells upon stimulation with LPS ( Fig . 1C ) . These results 6094 GLIA MATURATION FACTOR - g NEGATIVELY REGULATES TLR4 SIGNALING by gu e s t on J u l y 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . ji mm uno l . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m suggest that GMFG may be involved in regulation of TLR4 sig - naling in macrophages . Silencing of GMFG enhances the production of LPS - induced proinﬂammatory mediators in macrophages To determine whether the downregulation of GMFG expression following LPS stimulation has any functional consequences , we silenced the expression of GMFG in human macrophages using a previously veriﬁed GMFG siRNA ( 16 ) . The knockdown efﬁ - ciency and speciﬁcity of the siRNA oligonucleotides were con - ﬁrmed to be . 70 % in primary human macrophages and THP - 1 macrophages ( Fig . 1D , 1E ) . The effect of GMFG knockdown on LPS - induced inﬂammatory responses was then examined in hu - man macrophages . Knocking down GMFG signiﬁcantly enhanced the production of TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b in response to LPS stimulation at both the mRNA and protein level compared with control siRNA – transfected primary human macrophages ( Fig . 1F , 1G ) . In contrast , IL - 10 mRNA and protein levels were decreased in response to LPS in GMFG - knockdown macrophages compared with control siRNA – transfected cells . Similar changes were ob - served in THP - 1 macrophages ( data not shown ) . Because the LPS - induced production of TNF - a and IL - 6 is related to LPS - initiated MyD88 - mediated NF - k B or MAPK activation , whereas the LPS - induced IFN - b production is largely dependent on TRIF - mediated IRF3 activation , these data suggest that GMFG mediates regula - tion of the innate immune response in macrophages via MyD88 - dependent and TRIF - dependent TLR4 - signaling pathways .

We ﬁrst evaluated the effect of GMFG knockdown on activation of NF - k B in THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macrophages . Knockdown of GMFG led to greatly enhanced phosphorylation of NF - k B p65 and degradation of I k B a after LPS treatment for 60 min in THP - 1 macrophages and 30 min in primary human macrophages ; this effect was sustained for 6 h in THP - 1 macrophages and for 1 h in primary human macrophages ( Fig . 2A , 2B ) . In parallel with this immunoblotting analysis , ﬂuorescence microscopy demonstrated enhanced NF - k B activation in GMFG - knockdown THP - 1 mac - rophages . Pronouncedly enhanced nuclear import of p65 was observed as early as 5 min after LPS treatment of THP - 1 mac - rophages , indicating nuclear translocation of the NF - k B p65 subunit ( Fig . 2C ) . Further , NF - k B luciferase reporter assays of THP - 1 macrophages revealed that knockdown of GMFG en - hanced LPS - induced transcriptional activity of NF - k B promoters compared with activity observed in control siRNA – transfected cells ( Fig . 2D ) . Next , we examined MAPK activation status after LPS stimulation in GMFG - knockdown THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macrophages , because activation of the MAPK pathways also plays an essential role in response to LPS . Knockdown of GMFG in THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macrophages revealed remarkably enhanced LPS - induced phos - phorylation of Erk1 / 2 compared with control siRNA – transfected cells , whereas LPS - induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK was not considerably increased in GMFG - silenced cells compared with control - transfected cells ( Fig . 2E , 2F ) . Finally , analysis of LPS - induced activation of IRF3 also showed increased phos - phorylation of IRF3 in GMFG - knockdown THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macrophages compared with control - transfected cells ( Fig . 2E , 2F ) . Collectively , these results indicate that GMFG may negatively regulate LPS - initiated activation of the NF - k B , MAPK , and IRF3 pathways . Overexpression of GMFG inhibits LPS - induced cytokine production and LPS - initiated signaling pathways in macrophages To further support our ﬁndings that GMFG may negatively regulate the LPS - initiated signaling pathway , we overexpressed GMFG - GFP in THP - 1 macrophages . GMFG - overexpressing THP - 1 macrophages produced signiﬁcantly less TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b , but not IL - 10 , than did control - transfected cells in response to LPS ( Fig . 3A , 3B ) , indicating that GMFG overexpression in - hibited both MyD88 - and TRIF - dependent TLR4 signaling in re - sponse to LPS in macrophages . We next evaluated the effect of GMFG overexpression on the LPS - induced phosphorylation state of NF - k B , Erk1 / 2 , and IRF3 in THP - 1 macrophages . We found that GMFG overexpression could inhibit LPS - induced phosphor - ylation of Erk1 / 2 and IRF3 compared with control vector – trans - to 1 . Data are mean 6 SD of three experiments .

We also noted that GMFG overexpression had no effect on LPS - induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK , consistent with the effect of GMFG knockdown on p38 and JNK . These data provide additional evidence that GMFG negatively regulates TLR4 - initiated signaling pathways . Silencing of GMFG inhibits TLR4 internalization We next investigated the cellular mechanisms by which GMFG could negatively regulate TLR4 signaling . Recent studies showed that regulation of TLR4 signaling is dependent on TLR4 expression or TLR4 degradation ( 12 , 23 , 24 ) . Thus , we determined whether GMFG could modulate the expression level of TLR4 . Immuno - blotting analysis indicated that GMFG knockdown or overexpression did not affect total protein levels of TLR4 during LPS stimulation in THP - 1 macrophages ( Fig . 4A ) . However , ﬂow cytometry analysis showed that GMFG knockdown slightly increased TLR4 surface expression in both unstimulated and stimulated cells compared with control siRNA – transfected macrophages ( Fig . 4B ) . These results suggested that GMFG effects on TLR4 signaling observed in our earlier experiments likely were not attributable to changes in cell surface or total protein expression levels of TLR4 . It is well established that activated TLR4 can be transported from the cell membrane to endosomes for ubiquitination and to lyso - somes for degradation ( 25 ) . Thus , we examined , using confocal microscopy , whether GMFG mediates subcellular trafﬁcking of TLR4 after LPS stimulation . In unstimulated cells transfected with control siRNA , TLR4 was initially present at the cell surface and in tiny intracellular vesicles that were distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm . After 10 min of LPS treatment , TLR4 staining appeared increased in intracellular vesicles compared with that in unstimulated cells , suggesting that TLR4 was inter - nalized into the cytoplasm . At later time points ( 40 and 60 min ) of LPS stimulation , TLR4 had accumulated predominantly in the perinuclear area ( Fig . 4C , left panels ) . In contrast , in GMFG - knockdown cells , TLR4 staining appeared to be concentrated in the periplasma membrane area at 10 min of LPS stimulation , and it was sustained in the intracellular vesicles through to the late time points ( 40 and 60 min ) ( Fig . 4C , right panels ) . In addition , control IgG or an isotype - matched ( irrelevant ) mAb showed minimal ( or no ) background ﬂuorescence for TLR4 staining ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that GMFG may be involved in LPS - induced TLR4 internalization . FIGURE 4 . Silencing of GMFG inhibits TLR4 internalization .

A large portion of the GMFG was displayed throughout the cy - toplasm of the cells , with some high - intensity spots being readily apparent . These spots were reduced in intensity upon GMFG knockdown , conﬁrming the staining’s speciﬁcity ( data not shown ) . Moreover , control IgG or an isotype - matched ( irrelevant ) mAb showed minimal ( or no ) background ﬂuorescence for GMFG staining ( data not shown ) . To characterize these spots , we attempted to colocalize them with a series of well - characterized organelle membrane markers . Costaining with different membrane - speciﬁc markers revealed that endogenous GMFG was highly colocalized with the early / sorting endosome markers EEA1 and Rab5 ( Fig . 5A , 5B ) , as well as the late endosome marker Rab7 ( Fig . 5C ) , but it was not colocalized with the Golgi marker GM130 ( Fig . 5D ) or the en - doplasmic reticulum marker PDI ( Fig . 5E ) , suggesting direct linkage of GMFG to the early and late endosomes in THP - 1 macrophages . We performed subcellular fractionation using Percoll density - gradient centrifugation to conﬁrm these steady - state ﬁndings . Consistent with our confocal microscopy studies , we found that GMFG was mainly localized in fractions positive for the early endosome marker EEA1 ( fractions 1 – 3 ) , with some GMFG present in fractions positive for the late endosome marker Rab7 . In ad - dition , a partial overlap was observed between GMFG and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D in fractions 3 and 12 ( Fig . 5F ) . Altogether , these results suggest that GMFG is an early and late endosome – associated protein in THP - 1 macrophages . Silencing of GMFG induces abnormal TLR4 endosomal trafﬁcking Given that GMFG colocalized with EEA1 and Rab5 on early / sorting endosomes and with Rab7 on late endosomes , it is highly likely that GMFG may be involved in transport between these endocytic compartments . Thus , we examined the effect of GMFG knockdown on TLR4 endocytic trafﬁcking in LPS - stimulated THP - 1 macrophages and primary human macro - phages . GMFG knockdown delayed TLR4 trafﬁcking to Rab5 + early endosomes at early time points ( 10 min ) of LPS stimulation , because we observed that TLR4 did not colocalize with Rab5 + endosomes at 10 min after LPS stimulation in GMFG siRNA – transfected cells , but it could be detected in early endosomes at 10 FIGURE 5 .

At late time points ( 40 and 60 min ) of LPS stimulation in GMFG - knockdown cells , TLR4 appeared to colocalize with Rab5 + endosomes ( Fig . 6A ) , and substantially less TLR4 transport to Rab7 + late endosomes occurred ( Fig . 6B ) . In control cells , following 40 – 60 min of LPS stimulation , TLR4 no longer colo - calized with Rab5 + early endosomes ; instead , most of the TLR4 staining accumulated in the perinuclear area , colocalized with late endosome marker Rab7 ( Fig . 6B ) . To further determine whether GMFG is also involved in TLR4 internalization , we examined TLR4 internalization upon LPS stimulation from very early time points ( 5 , 10 , and 20 min ) using the fast recycling endosome marker Rab4 in GMFG - knockdown cells . Surprisingly , we found that TLR4 appeared to be colo - FIGURE 6 . Silencing of GMFG induces abnormal TLR4 endosomal trafﬁcking .

Conversely , TLR4 transport to Rab4 + endosomes at the very early time point ( 5 min ) of LPS stimulation appeared to be delayed in GMFG - knockdown cells , but TLR4 appeared to be colocalized with the Rab4 + compartment after 10 min of LPS stimulation ( Fig . 6C ) . Finally , we examined the endocytic trafﬁcking of TLR4 in GMFG - knockdown primary human macrophages . Consistent with our data from THP - 1 macrophages , GMFG - knockdown primary human macrophages exhibited impaired TLR4 transport to the Rab7 + late endosomes after 40 and 60 min of LPS stimulation ( Fig . 6E ) compared with control primary human macrophages . Furthermore , in GMFG - knockdown primary human macrophages , TLR4 staining appeared to be retained in the cytoplasmic punc - tate - and focal contact - like staining but not in the accumulated perinuclear area during the late time points of LPS stimulation ( Fig . 6D ) . However , we were unable to detect the colocalization of TLR4 with the early endosome marker Rab5 in both control siRNA – and GMFG siRNA – transfected primary human macro - phages . This might represent a technical issue rather than a nega - tive result . Taken together , these results indicate that GMFG not only mediates TLR4 transport from early to late endosomes , it also mediates TLR4 internalization . GMFG is not required for endotoxin tolerance Because GMFG knockdown enhanced the LPS - induced inﬂam - matory response , we sought to investigate whether GMFG had an effect on endotoxin tolerance in vitro . We pretreated THP - 1 macrophages transfected with control siRNA or GMFG siRNA with 10 ng / ml LPS for 24 h and subsequently challenged them with 100 ng / ml LPS for 24 h . Consistent with published reports de - scribing LPS - induced endotoxin tolerance , pretreatment with low - dose LPS nearly completely inhibited TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b production after secondary LPS challenge in THP - 1 macrophages transfected with control siRNA ( Fig . 7A ) . GMFG - knockdown cells had substantially enhanced production of TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b during the ﬁrst 24 h after exposure to LPS in unprimed cells , whereas production of these cytokines was blocked over time in low - dose LPS - primed cells in response to secondary LPS challenge ( Fig . 7A ) . To determine whether pretreatment with LPS altered LPS responses at the level of gene expression , we measured mRNA by real - time Q - PCR . Pretreatment with LPS substantially suppressed subsequent LPS - induced expression of mRNA for TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b in both control and GMFG - knockdown cells ( Fig . 7B ) . These results indicate that GMFG is not required for LPS - induced downregulation of cytokine pro - duction . Discussion Although extensive studies described the negative regulation of TLR4 signaling , and many negative regulators have been identiﬁed ( 26 – 30 ) , few reports exist about the regulators that control TLR4 intracellular trafﬁcking upon microbial recognition . In this study , we identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time , to our knowledge , an important role of GMFG in TLR4 signaling—that GMFG is a novel negative regulator of the MyD88 - dependent and TRIF - dependent TLR4 - signaling pathways—by demonstrating that GMFG mediated regulation of TLR4 endocytosis in macrophages . Our data reveal that depletion of GMFG results in abnormal trafﬁcking of TLR4 in endosomes in response to LPS stimulation . This abnormal accu - FIGURE 7 .

Endocytosis has emerged as a critical mechanism for controlling the signaling pathway via endosomal sorting of the internalized receptors , and their endocytic trafﬁcking . Recent studies deﬁned a requirement for actin dynamics in endocytosis in mammalian cell lines ( 31 , 32 ) . Actin polymerization and depolymerization are tightly regulated to guarantee the correct endocytic membrane transport . Several lines of evidence showed that actin - depolymerizing protein is involved in receptor trafﬁcking from the endosome to the recycling compartment and degradation in normal cells . For example , coﬁlin ( actin depolymerization factor / coﬁlin superfamily member ) - mediated actin ﬁlaments are required for the multiple steps of endocytic trafﬁcking ( 33 , 34 ) . PICK1 , an inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly , is required for AMPA receptor endo - cytosis ( 35 , 36 ) . Therefore , regulation of actin patch disassembly plays an important role in endocytosis . GMFG , another actin de - polymerization factor / coﬁlin superfamily protein , was reported to function as an actin disassembly protein by inhibiting the Arp2 / 3 complex in yeast ( 37 ) . Although GMFG’s action as a disassembly / debranching protein in mammalian cells has yet to be determined , it has a particularly interesting role in TLR4 endocytosis . Our results with GMFG are the ﬁrst , to our knowledge , to characterize a role for GMFG in TLR4 trafﬁcking in endosomes in response to LPS , as evidenced by studies in GMFG - knockdown macrophages . Our confocal microscopy study revealed that GMFG is found throughout the cytosol and colocalizes with the early and late endosome compartments , indicating that GMFG may be involved in TLR4 endocytic trafﬁcking . TLR4 endocytosis at the early phase of LPS stimulation is predominantly clathrin dependent ( 25 , 38 ) , whereas recent studies show that caveolae / lipid raft – mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis also play important roles in TLR4 endocytosis and signaling activation ( 39 – 42 ) . These endo - cytosis pathways are maintained in a dynamic balance , and inhi - bition of one endocytosis pathway can shift receptor trafﬁcking to another pathway . For example , siRNA knockdown of clathrin results in a signiﬁcant inhibition of TLR4 uptake in the early phase of LPS stimulation , whereas TLR4 accumulates in the endosome at the late phase of LPS stimulation , indicating that TLR4 transport occurs by a clathrin - independent pathway ( 25 ) . Similarly , we ob - served that knockdown of GMFG inhibited TLR4 internalization to Rab4 + endosomes , but it appears to prolong the accumulation of TLR4 in Rab5 + early endosomes , which impairs TLR4 transloca - tion to Rab7 + late endosomes for further degradation . Thus , it is likely that knockdown of GMFG leads to prolonged TLR4 retention in the plasma membrane , which might enhance LPS - induced NF - k B activation . However , the mechanisms underlying GMFG - mediated TLR4 internalization and endocytic trafﬁcking require additional investigation . TLR4 translocation to the endosomes is required for TRIF - dependent IRF3 activation ( 11 , 38 ) . After transport to the early endosome , TLR4 is sorted and targeted to a trans - Golgi network pathway ( 43 ) and diverted to a lysosomal - degradation pathway ( 12 , 25 ) , which is required for resolution of the inﬂammatory response . Minimal perturbation of any of these steps causes an abnormal inﬂammatory response ( 12 , 44 ) . Indeed , recent studies showed that abnormal accumulation of TLR4 in early endosomes by inhibition of endocytosis or endosomal sorting leads to in - creased LPS - induced activation of the NF - k B , MAPK , and IRF3 pathways , which affect the downstream proinﬂammatory state ( 12 , 45 , 46 ) . Consistent with these reports , our results demonstrate that GMFG knockdown induced delayed TLR4 internalization and abnormal accumulation of TLR4 in early endosomes , which led to signiﬁcantly enhanced LPS - induced TLR4 signaling . Multiple lines of evidence support this statement . First , we found that knockdown of GMFG enhanced LPS - induced phosphorylation of NF - k B , Erk1 / 2 , and IRF3 and increased production of down - stream inﬂammatory cytokines , such as TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b . Second , although overexpression of GMFG did not inhibit LPS - induced activation of NF - k B , it clearly inhibited LPS - induced Erk1 / 2 and IRF3 phosphorylation and downstream cytokines , such as TNF - a , IL - 6 , and IFN - b . This hyperresponsiveness to LPS under GMFG - knockdown conditions could be explained by pro - longed accumulation of TLR4 in the early endosomes . Third , LPS induced downregulation of GMFG , which is consistent with a previous study ﬁnding in which transfection of EBV nuclear Ag 2 in B cells also induced the downregulation of GMFG ( 47 ) . This ﬁnding suggested that LPS - induced GMFG downregulation is required for inducing optimal activation of TLR4 signaling and may be the mechanism used by the host to avoid suppression of the innate immune response aimed at thoroughly removing in - vading pathogenic microbes . Finally , GMFG is not required for LPS - induced endotoxin tolerance . GMFG is downregulated by stimulation with LPS at doses of 100 – 1000 ng / ml . However , at lower doses of LPS stimulation ( 1 – 10 ng / ml ) , GMFG was not downregulated . Therefore , our data suggest that regulation of GMFG expression may not be a major mechanism by which the cell regulates its responses to microbial stimuli . Given all of the evidence obtained so far , our results strongly suggest that GMFG may negatively regulate TLR4 signaling by the modulation of TLR4 endocytic trafﬁcking in human macrophages . In this study , our data showed that GMFG knockdown or overexpression did not affect total protein levels of TLR4 , which differs from previous studies in which total TLR4 expression is increased along with accumulation of TLR4 in early endosomes ( 12 , 45 ) . Although we cannot provide conclusive results for the role of GMFG on TLR4 expression using the present data alone , we have provided evidence that silencing of GMFG delayed TLR4 internalization and induced abnormal accumulation of TLR4 in early endosomes . These results suggest that activation of TLR4 signaling after GMFG knockdown is a direct consequence of impaired intracellular membrane trafﬁcking but is not due to changing TLR4 expression levels . In summary , we identiﬁed and characterized a role for GMFG as a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling , which is facilitated by TLR4 endocytic trafﬁcking that is evoked by its ligand LPS . Hence , further studies of the role for GMFG in the regulation of TLR family members are likely to identify useful therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with autoimmune , chronic inﬂammation , or infectious diseases .
