To establish the expression pattern of p120 in breast cancer , we analysed 326 breast tissue biopsies by tissue microarray . Most of the lobular tumors ( 88 % ) showed exclusive cytoplasmic localization , and 6 % of them also had p120 nuclear staining . Cytoplasmic p120 strongly associated with complete loss of E - CD and b - catenin not only in lobular carcinoma and its metastases but also in atypical lobular hyperplasias . In the latter , loss of heterozygosity of E - CD gene was also observed . Complete loss of E - CD and cytoplasmic and nuclear p120 staining was also observed in primary lobular cancer cell cultures generated by us . In ductal tumors , by contrast , reduction of p120 and E - CD in membrane was very common ( 57 and 53 % , respectively ) , whereas cytoplasmic p120 staining was rarely seen . This simultaneous reduction of membranous E - CD and p120 was not associated with increased Src kinase activity . To demonstrate that cytoplasmic p120 localization was a consequence of the absence of E - CD , the endogenous E - CD was re - expressed in MDA - 231 cells by 5 - Aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( 5Aza ) treatment . After treatment , p120 shifted from the cytoplasm to the membrane , where it colocalized with endogenous E - CD . Additionally , suppres - sing E - CD expression in Madin – Darby canine kidney cells by stable transfection of the transcriptional repres - sors Snail , E47 or Slug , provokes p120 cytoplasmic localization and p120 isoform switching . In conclusion , abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p120 , which are mediated by the absence of E - CD , character - istically occur in the early stages of lobular breast cancer and are maintained during tumor progression to metastasis . Consequently , p120 may be an important mediator of the oncogenic effects derived from E - CD inactivation , including enhanced motility and invasion , in lobular breast cancer .

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that defects in various components of the E - cadherin ( E - CD ) complex result in decreased cell – cell adhesiveness and increased tumor metastasis ( reviewed in Beavon , 2000 ) . E - CD , the major cell – cell adhesion protein in epithelial tissues , is fre - quently downregulated in epithelial cancers , and is widely acknowledged to be both a tumor and metastasis suppressor ( Christofori and Semb , 1999 ) . In breast cancer , most of the invasive lobular carcinoma ( ILC ) and lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS ) completely lack E - CD expression , but complete loss of E - CD protein does not occur in ductal tumors ( Gamallo et al . , 1993 ) . In lobular tumors , E - CD loss is attributable to many defects in E - CD gene ( CDH1 ) , including inactivating mutations , loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) , and promoter hypermethylation ( Droufakou et al . , 2001 ; Sarrio´ et al . , 2003 ) . The cytoplasmic domain of E - CD interacts with a group of proteins called catenins , which are character - ized by a central armadillo repeat domain . b - and g - catenin bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the catenin - binding domain of E - CD and mediate the binding of the complex to the actin cytoskeleton through a - catenin ( Nagafuchi , 2001 ) . In addition , b - and g - catenin bind to APC and are able to translocate into the nucleus , thus participating in the Wnt signaling pathway ( Conacci - Sorrell et al . , 2002 ) . p120ctn ( p120 ) , which was initially described as a prominent Src substrate ( Reynolds et al . , 1992 ) , also belongs to the catenin family and is closely homologous with b - and g - catenin ( Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) . However , p120 differs from the other catenins in a number of respects . Unlike b - or g - catenin , p120 does not interact with a - catenin or APC , but binds to the juxtamembrane domain of E - CD ( Daniel and Reynolds , 1995 ) . How - ever , the role of p120 is currently controversial since Received 29 July 2003 ; revised 25 November 2003 ; accepted 9 December 2003 ; Published online 12 April 2004 * Correspondence : J Palacios , Programa de Patologı´a Molecular , Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncolo´gicas ( CNIO ) , c . / Melchor Ferna´ndez Almagro no . 3 , 28029 Madrid , Spain ; E - mail : jpalacios @ cnio . es Oncogene ( 2004 ) 23 , 3272 – 3283 & 2004 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0950 - 9232 / 04 $ 25 . 00 www . nature . com / onc evidence suggests that p120 can both positively and negatively regulate adhesive activity ( Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) . One reason for this apparent contra - diction may lie in the large number of p120 isoforms expressed in different cells and tissues ( Mo and Reynolds , 1996 ; Keiserbilck et al . , 1998 ) . These iso - forms , which arise as a result of alternative splicing events , may have tissue - speciﬁc functions ( Montonen et al . , 2001 ) . Isoforms 1 – 4 use different ATG start sites that produce proteins that differ by the length of amino - terminal domain . Recently , it has been shown that different p120 isoforms may have distinct biological functions in normal and malignant epithelial cells ( Aho et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , p120 activity is also dependent on its phosphorylation status ( Mariner et al . , 2001 ) . It has been suggested that constitutive tyrosine phosphor - ylation of p120 by Src contributes to defects in cadherin - mediated adhesion in Src - transformed cells ( Ozawa and Ohkubo , 2001 ) , but the exact impact of Src activation in cell adhesion is not well understood . In addition , p120 has also been demonstrated to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and to enhance cell motility indirectly through Rho GTPases ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ; Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2001 ) . Similar to other catenins , p120 can also translocate into the cell nucleus ( Van Hengel et al . , 1999 ) where it binds to Kaiso , a novel transcription factor of the POZ / ZF family ( Daniel and Reynolds , 1999 ) . Since all these ﬁndings point to a role of p120 in modulating cell adhesion and invasive - ness , several studies have attempted to assess the potential role of p120 in tumor progression . Abnorm - alities in p120 expression have now been reported in a variety of tumors ( reviewed in Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) . Reduced or complete loss of p120 expression has been associated with higher stage or poor prognosis in colon , bladder , and prostate cancer , among others ( Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) . The purpose of this study was to determine the expression pattern of p120 in the two most frequent histological types of breast cancer , ductal and lobular carcinomas , and its preinvasive lesions , such as atypical lobular hyperplasia . On the assumption that lobular carcinomas almost always lack E - CD protein but ductal tumors do not , our study would serve to evaluate the expression pattern of p120 in the presence or absence of E - CD . In addition , we evaluated whether p120 and E - CD expression was associated with Src kinase activity in ductal breast carcinomas . Results Cytoplasmic expression of p120 and complete loss of E - cadherin characterize lobular neoplasia In contrast to normal ducts , in which E - CD and p120 were markedly expressed in the membrane of epithelial cells , we observed that in all stages of lobular neoplasia , from ALH to metastasis , cytoplasmic localization of p120 and complete loss of E - CD were very common alterations . The preinvasive lobular lesions ALH and LCIS showed complete loss of E - CD expression in 27 / 29 ( 93 % ) and 7 / 9 ( 77 % ) of cases , respectively ( Figure 1a , c and d ) . Interestingly , p120 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in 26 / 29 ( 90 % ) of ALHs ( Figure 1b and c ) and 9 / 9 ( 100 % ) of LCIS ( Figure 1d ) , although focal membranous p120 expression was also seen in some cells . Moreover , in the majority of ILC tumors , E - CD was absent ( Table 1 , Figure 1e ) and p120 was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1f and g ) . We also noted that 64 % of ILCs had a high level of immuno - histochemical staining of p120 in the cytoplasm , suggesting that p120 is accumulated ( Figure 1g ) , whereas 24 % of ILCs showed weak to normal levels of p120 staining in the cytoplasm ( Table 1 ) . Four cases with cytoplasmic accumulation also demonstrated nu - clear p120 staining in about 10 – 15 % of neoplastic cells ( Figure 1j ) . Interestingly , cytoplasmic localization of p120 was clearly associated with the absence of E - CD expression in ILCs ( contingency test , P ¼ 0 . 001 ) , since no p120 cytoplasmic or nuclear expression was found when E - CD was retained in the membrane . Moreover , the combined phenotype of complete loss of E - CD and cytoplasmic accumulation of p120 was also found in the associated in situ component in 67 % of ILCs ( Figure 1e and f ) . Additionally , in 9 / 13 ( 70 % ) metastatic lymph nodes , loss of E - CD and cytoplasmic accumulation and focal nuclear p120 staining were observed ( Figure 1h ) . We then investigated whether E - CD loss was also associated with cytoplasmic localization of b - catenin in lobular lesions . However , b - catenin was severely re - duced or absent in almost all ALHs ( 26 / 29 , 90 % ) , LCISs ( 7 / 9 , 78 % ) and inﬁltrating lobular tumors ( Table 1 , Figure 1i ) . Moreover , we investigated whether preinva - sive lobular lesions adjacent to invasive ductal carcino - ma ( IDC ) tumors showed the same staining patterns as that observed in invasive tumor cells . Well - deﬁned precursor lesions for ductal carcinoma such as atypical ductal hyperplasia ( n ¼ 6 ) demonstrated normal mem - branous expression of E - CD and p120 ( not shown ) . By contrast , ALH lesions adjacent to ductal tumors ( n ¼ 5 ) showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization of p120 , and loss of E - CD protein , thus suggesting that these expression patterns in ALH arose whether or not these lesions were associated with invasive ductal tumor . Apart from this , since almost all ALHs lacked E - CD expression , we investigated whether LOH at CDH1 locus occurred in these lesions and found that two of the ﬁve ( 40 % ) informative cases demonstrated LOH ( not shown ) . Reduced membranous p120 frequently occurs in ductal tumors To establish whether altered expression of p120 was speciﬁc to the lobular histotype , 219 invasive ductal tumors were analysed . The results are summarized in Table 1 . In these tumors , p120 was almost always ( 88 % ) localized in the membrane ( Figure 1k and l ) and rarely appeared in the cell cytoplasm . High levels of cytoplas - mic p120 were only observed in three cases ( 1 . 5 % ) , which also lacked E - CD staining . Reduction of p120 in p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3273 Oncogene the membrane was the most common expression pattern in ductal tumors ( Figure 1l ) . Thus , p120 localization and expression differed signiﬁcantly between ductal and lobular carcinomas ( P o 0 . 001 , Table 1 ) . Moreover , membranous reduction of E - CD and b - catenin was very frequent in IDCs , but complete loss of these proteins was rare . Additionally , four IDCs completely lacked p120 expression .

( l ) Reduced E - CD and p120 ( inset ) at the membrane of IDC cells p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3274 Oncogene tumors , reduced p120 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with reduction of E - CD ( contingency test , P o 0 . 0001 ) and b - catenin ( P o 0 . 0001 ) . p120 and E - CD expression and Src kinase activity in ductal breast carcinomas Since tyrosine phosphorylation by c - Src contributes to defects in the E - CD – catenin adhesion complex ( Daniel and Reynolds , 1997 ) and we have observed that about 50 % of IDCs had reduced E - CD and p120 expression , we tested whether the levels of expression of these proteins were related to c - Src kinase activity in 46 frozen IDC tumors . The mean value of Src activation was higher in tumors with preserved E - CD ( 2 . 43 þ 2 . 0 s . d . , arbitrary units ( AU ) ) than in those with reduced E - CD ( 1 . 5 þ 1 . 2 AU ) . Tumors with preserved p120 expression showed higher Src activity ( 2 . 37 þ 2 . 1 AU ) than those with reduced p120 ( 1 . 47 þ 1 . 0 AU ) . However , the differences between groups were not statistically sig - niﬁcant ( t - test , P ¼ 0 . 068 for E - CD , and P ¼ 011 for p120 ) . Src activity was also studied in four lobular tumors , but no differences between these tumors were found ( not shown ) . Primary cell cultures from lobular breast carcinomas lack E - CD protein and show cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p120 We next studied whether cytoplasmic localization of p120 also occurred in lobular cancer cells in vitro . To this end , we generated ﬁve primary cell cultures from ILC tumors . To ensure the epithelial origin of the cultures , we stained for the presence of cytokeratins since they are speciﬁc epithelial makers . All of these primary cultures showed positive cytokeratin staining in the cytoplasm ( Figure 2a ) . However , most of the cells showed a disorganized cytokeratin matrix or even a residual punctuate staining ( not shown ) . We next compared E - CD and p120 expression in these cells with those observed in established ductal carcinoma cell lines . As reported elsewhere , MCF7 and T47D cell lines expressed high levels of membranous E - CD and p120 , whereas cytoplasmic p120 staining was not observed . By contrast , all the primary lobular cancer cultures generated by us were completely negative for E - CD expression by RT – PCR , Western blot ( Figure 4 ) , and immunoﬂuorescence experiments , but p120 was diffu - sely localized in the cytoplasm of the cells , and occasionally in the nuclei ( Figure 2b – d ) . Membrane - bound p120 was very focal and scarce . To ensure that p120 was localized in the nucleus of lobular tumors , these primary cell cultures were treated with leptomycin - B , a speciﬁc nuclear protein export inhibitor that has previously been demonstrated to retain endogenous p120 in the nucleus ( Van Hengel et al . , 1999 ) . After treatment , nuclear p120 expression was evident in all primary lobular cancer cultures by immunoﬂuorescence ( Figure 2d ) , whereas the treatment has no detectable effect on p120 localization in T47D or MCF7 cells ( not shown ) . p120 cytoplasmic localization is a consequence of the absence of a functional E - CD We next tried to demonstrate that p120 cytoplasmic localization in breast cancer cells was a consequence of complete E - CD loss . To this end , we used the MDA - 231 breast cancer cell line , which has a ﬁbroblastic phenotype , completely lacks E - CD expression , and has high levels of cytoplasmic p120 ( Figure 3a ) . Since the absence of E - CD protein in this cell line is caused by transcriptional silencing of CDH1 gene due to the extensive hypermethylation of CDH1 promoter ( Graff et al . , 1995 ) , we treated MDA - 231 cells with the demethylating agent 5 - Aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( 5Aza ) Table 1 Differential expression of E - CD and catenins between lobular and ductal breast carcinomas IHQ Expression Lobular cancer Ductal cancer X 2 test p120 P o 0 . 001 Normal membrane 6 / 67 ( 9 % ) 60 / 195 ( 30 . 8 % ) Reduced membrane 2 / 67 ( 3 % ) 111 / 195 ( 56 . 9 % ) Cytoplasmic ( weak expression ) 16 / 67 ( 23 . 9 % ) 17 / 195 ( 8 . 7 % ) Cytoplasmic ( strong ) a 43 / 67 ( 64 . 1 % ) 3 / 195 ( 1 . 5 % ) Complete loss 0 ( 0 % ) 4 / 195 ( 2 . 1 % ) E - cadherin P o 0 . 001 Normal membrane 4 / 69 ( 5 . 8 % ) 87 / 196 ( 44 . 4 % ) Reduced membrane 5 / 69 ( 7 . 2 % ) 105 / 196 ( 53 . 6 % ) Cytoplasmic 6 / 69 ( 8 . 7 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Complete loss 54 / 69 ( 78 . 3 % ) 4 / 196 ( 2 % ) b - Catenin P o 0 . 001 Normal membrane 4 / 68 ( 5 . 9 % ) 90 / 192 ( 46 . 9 % ) Reduced membrane 4 / 68 ( 5 . 9 % ) 99 / 192 ( 51 . 6 % ) Cytoplasmic 0 ( 0 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Complete loss 60 / 68 ( 88 . 2 % ) 3 / 192 ( 1 . 6 % ) a Four ILC cases also showed strong nuclear staining of p120 . X 2 contingency test p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3275 Oncogene for 4 days . After treatment , about 3 % of cells restored an epithelial phenotype and re - expressed E - CD in membrane ( Figure 3a ) . Interestingly , in E - CD - expres - sing cells , p120 shifted from the cytoplasm to the membrane , where it colocalized with the endogenous re - expressed E - CD ( Figure 3a ) , whereas in E - CD - negative cells , p120 remained in the cytoplasm . 5Aza treatment did not affect E - CD or p120 expression in T47D ( Figure 3a ) and MCF7 cells ( not shown ) . To further demonstrate that loss of E - CD produces cytoplasmic localization of p120 , we took advantage of a previously described model for efﬁciently suppressing E - CD expression in epithelial cells . The Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line , which expresses high levels of membranous E - CD , was stably transfected with constructs encoding Snail , E47 , or Slug proteins , three potent transcriptional repressors of E - CD ( Cano et al . , 2000 ; Perez - Moreno et al . , 2001 ; Bolos et al . , 2003 ) . MDCK control cells ( MDCK - CMV , transfected with an empty vector ) have an epithelial phenotype , and express E - CD and p120 in membrane , where they colocalize ( Figure 3b ) . By contrast , Snail - , Slug - , and E47 - transfected MDCK cells , which undergo an epithe - lial to mesenchymal transition , completely lacked E - CD expression ( Figure 3b and 4a ) , and showed an apparent localization of p120 in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3b ; MDCK - Slug not shown ) . Hence , in the absence of E - CD , p120 shifted from the membrane to the cytoplasm in MDCK cells . p120 isoforms in primary lobular breast cancer cultures and cell lines Since most of the lobular tumors lacking E - CD showed high levels of cytoplasmic p120 staining , implying that p120 may be upregulated , we then investigated whether our primary lobular cultures had greater total amounts of p120 protein or mRNA than did other breast cancer cell lines . RT – PCR and Western blot revealed no clear quantitative differences between the cell lines studied ( Figure 4a and b ) , but we observed that all the primary lobular cultures expressed the same p120 isoforms . By Western blot , using the pan - p120 - speciﬁc antibody pp120 , two major bands migrating at around 120 kDa ( corresponding to isoform 1 ) and 100 kDa ( isoform 3 ) were detected in all the primary cultures . A faster migrating band at around 65 kDa , which may corre - spond to isoform 4 , was also observed ( Figure 4a ) . Interestingly , this pattern of p120 isoforms was very similar to that observed in the E - CD - negative cell lines MDA - 231 and MDA - 435 . By contrast , the E - CD - positive cell lines MCF7 and T47D did not express isoform 1 . In these cell lines , isoform 3 was predomi - nantly detected , although a slower migrating band corresponding to either isoform 2 or phosphorylated isoform 3 was also observed . To ensure the speciﬁcity of the bands detected , the experiments were repeated using different protein extraction methods and buffers . The repeated experiments yielded the same results ( not Figure 2 Cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p120 in primary cell cultures from lobular breast carcinomas ( LOBS ) by immunoﬂuorescence .

( d ) After treatment with leptomycin - B , cytoplasmic p120 staining is reduced and nuclear expression is more evident ( arrows ) p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3276 Oncogene shown ) . Moreover , two additional experimental ap - proaches were used to conﬁrm these results . First , we used the 6H11 mAb ( which speciﬁcally recognizes the longest p120 isoforms 1 and 2 ) in the Western blot analysis and observed that it detected a single band of around 120 kDa ( isoform 1 ) . Second , we analysed the expression of the mRNA isoforms by RT – PCR , using a primer set that ampliﬁes the 5 0 region of p120 mRNA . The most abundant mRNA transcripts in our primary cultures and in the E - CD - negative cell lines were of types 1 and 3 , whereas in E - CD - positive cell lines no expression of the type 1 isoforms was observed Figure 3 p120 cytoplasmic localization is a consequence of E - CD loss in epithelial cells . ( a ) MDA - 231 ( 231 control ) cells lack E - CD expression and accumulate p120 in the cytoplasm . After treatment with 5 - Aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( 231 þ 5Aza ) , endogenous E - CD is re - expressed , and p120 shifted from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane , where it colocalizes with E - CD ( Merge , superimposition of the two images ) . To visualize cell nuclei , cells were stained with DAPI . ( b ) Transcriptional repression of E - CD gene by stable transfection of Snail or E47 proteins induces the acquisition of a mesenchymal morphology , and provokes cytoplasmic localization of p120 in MDCK cells p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3277 Oncogene ( Figure 4b ) . A panel of non - breast cancer cell lines ( HaCaT , HeLa , and HUVEC ) , whose p120 isoform patterns have been previously established , were used as control for p120 isoform proﬁles . As reported before , HeLa and HUVEC cells express easily detectable levels of p120 isoform 1 , whereas HaCaT cells do not ( Mo and Reynolds , 1996 ; Aho et al . , 2002 ) . A similar upregulation of isoform 1 was observed by Western blot in MDCK - Snail , MDCK - Slug , and MDCK - E47 cells in comparison to MDCK control cells ( Figure 4a ) . Although the total amount of p120 is similar in MDCK transfectants and control cells , transfection of Snail , Slug , or E47 induced a large increase in the levels of isoform 1 , which is normally an isoform of minor importance in this cell type . Again , this result was conﬁrmed with the 6H11 mAb . Finally , MDA - 435 and 231 cell lines , which lack E - CD and express high levels of the p120 isoform 1 , are also known to express nonepithelial cadherins , such as cadherin - 11 and N - cadherin ( N - CD ) . We then analysed our primary cultures and cell lines for the presence of N - CD and detected its expression in three out of ﬁve primary cultures , and also in MDA - 435 , HeLa , HaCaT , and HUVEC cell lines . N - CD expression associates with the presence of isoform 1 , except in HaCat cells , which also express E - CD ( Figure 4a ) . Discussion Accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in the E - CD – catenin complex play an important role in tumor behavior and progression ( Beavon , 2000 ) . Altered expression of E - CD has been widely observed in a variety of tumor types , whereas p120 expression is currently being investigated in human cancer . To date , decreased p120 expression with respect to its normal epithelial tissue has been reported in a variety of human carcinomas , and reduced p120 expression correlated with disease progression in some instances , thus suggesting a tumor suppression role for p120 ( Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) . Here , we compared for the ﬁrst time p120 expression in the two major types of invasive Figure 4 mRNA and protein expression of cadherins and p120 in LOBs and cancer cell lines . ( a ) Differential E - CD , N - CD , and p120 expression among the cell lines by Western blot . Several bands are detected using a p120 C - terminus speciﬁc mAb . The p120 isoforms were identiﬁed by their differential molecular weights as indicated . 6H11 mAb was used to recognize p120 isoform 1 . As a loading control , a - tubulin ( a - tub ) was used . ( b ) E - CD and p120 expression by RT – PCR . Total E - CD and p120 mRNA levels are depicted in the upper panels . Middle panel : identiﬁcation of the different p120 transcripts expressed in the cell lines used . Numeric isoform codes are indicated on the right , and their band sizes on the left . b 2 - Microglobulin ( b2microg ) expression was used as internal control p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3278 Oncogene breast cancer ( ductal and lobular ) and found that it signiﬁcantly differed between them . In ILCs , normal membranous p120 expression is very rare , since most ( 88 % ) of the analysed ILCs showed cytoplasmic mislocalization . Moreover , in most cases , a strong cytoplasmic staining of p120 was observed , which may indicate that p120 is accumulated in the cell cytoplasm . Cytoplasmic localization of p120 was also observed in the majority of atypical lobular hyperplasias , and LCISs ( two lobular lesions likely to be precursors of ILC ) , and also in metastatic lesion from ILCs . Therefore , this implies that p120 cytoplasmic mislocalization appears in the early stages of lobular tumorigenesis and is maintained during lobular cancer progression . By contrast , in our series of ductal tumors , p120 was frequently reduced in the membrane , and 2 % of the cases completely lacked p120 staining . Cytoplasmic localization , however , was rarely observed in the present series , coinciding with the ﬁndings of two previous studies in ductal tumors ( Dillon et al . , 1998 ; Nakapou - lou et al . , 2002 ) . These data indicate that p120 is frequently reduced in ductal breast carcinomas , and that a proportion ( from 2 to 10 % ) of ductal tumors completely lack p120 expression . Taking into account the close functional relationship between p120 and other components of the E - CD – catenin complex , we exam - ined whether altered p120 expression was associated with abnormal E - CD or b - catenin expression in our tumor series . We found that p120 expression was strongly associated with E - CD and b - catenin expression in both lobular and ductal tumor types , but in very distinct manners . Whereas a high proportion of lobular carcinomas with p120 cytoplasmic localization showed complete loss of E - CD and b - catenin expres - sion , E - CD and b - catenin reduction in ductal tumors was signiﬁcantly associated with reduced levels of membranous p120 , but not with its cytoplasmic localization . Simultaneous loss of E - CD , a - , and b - catenin expression is widely observed in lobular tumors , whereas the concurrent reduction of membra - nous E - CD , a - , and b - catenin levels is also a common ﬁnding in ductal tumors ( Jiang and Mansel , 2000 ) . However , although Dillon et al . found no correlation between p120 expression and that of other components of the cadherin complex , our data and the ﬁndings of a recent report ( Nakapoulou et al . , 2002 ) strongly suggest that p120 reduction is also associated with a reduction in membranous E - CD and other catenins in ductal tumors . This simultaneous reduction in various members of the adhesion complex may be linked to phosphorylation events . Indeed , tyrosine phosphor - ylation by Src tyrosine kinase of members of the cadherin – catenin complex , including p120 , has been reported to disrupt the adherent junctions ( Daniel and Reynolds , 1997 ) . Thus , we investigated whether E - CD and p120 levels were associated with Src kinase activity in ductal tumors . Although we have not evaluated the phosphorylation status of p120 , we found that the mean value of Src activity was higher in IDC with preserved p120 or E - CD expression than in those with reduced p120 or E - CD expression , thus implying that increased Src activity is not associated with a reduction in E - CD or p120 . Our results are in accordance with previous experimental evidence that indicates that Src - induced p120 tyrosine phos - phorylation increased its afﬁnity for E - CD ( Roura et al . , 1999 ) . As mentioned above , lobular tumors lack E - CD and b - catenin expression but accumulate p120 in the cytoplasm . Similarly , cytoplasmic p120 localization has been reported in a subset of pancreatic cancers ( Mayerle et al . , 2003 ) and in a high proportion of diffuse gastric cancers ( Jawhari et al . , 1999 ) , a tumor known frequently to harbor CDH1 mutations ( Berx et al . , 1998 ) . Interest - ingly , we observed here that cytoplasmic localization of p120 was closely associated with loss of E - CD at all stages of lobular tumorigenesis , from ALH to metas - tasis . Moreover , in a panel of primary lobular cancer cultures generated by us , E - CD protein was not detectable in any case , but p120 was almost exclusively localized in the cell cytoplasm . Therefore , it is reason - able to conclude that p120 cytoplasmic accumulation in lobular carcinoma and other tumor types is the result of complete E - CD inactivation . These ﬁndings are in accordance with in vitro observations , indicating that in the absence of a functional E - CD , unlike the other catenins , p120 is metabolically stable and accumulates in the cytoplasm ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) . Here , we demonstrate a direct link between the absence of E - CD and p120 cytoplasmic mislocalization in breast cancer cells . After re - expression of endogenous E - CD in MDA - 231 cells by 5Aza treatment , an epithelial phenotype was restored , and p120 was recruited from the cytoplasm to the membrane , where it colocalized with endogenous E - CD . Our experiment conﬁrms previous in vitro studies showing the same effect of the stable transfection of ectopic E - CD in E - CD - negative cell lines ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , in a reverse experiment , we demonstrated that suppressing E - CD expression in MDCK cells by stable transfection of the transcriptional repressors Snail , E47 , or Slug , provokes a p120 shift from the membrane to the cell cytoplasm , thus implying that in epithelial cells the absence of E - CD is followed by cytoplasmic mislocalization of p120 . Does cytoplasmic p120 accumulation have any biological relevance in lobular breast cancer ? Over - expression of transfected p120 in ﬁbroblast and epithe - lial cell lines produces a dendritic phenotype characterized by long branched processes , loss of stress ﬁbers , reduction of focal adhesions , and cytoskeleton remodeling , which is mediated by Rho family of GTPases ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ; Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2001 ) . As a consequence of these alterations , cells with p120 overexpression show increased motility , implying that p120 may play a role as a metastasis promoter ( Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2001 ) . Accord - ingly , mRNA upregulation , cytoplasmic distribution , and nuclear import of p120 have recently been demon - strated to be associated with a more malignant and invasive phenotype in pancreatic cancer ( Mayerle et al . , 2003 ) . However , although 64 % of our ILC tumors p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3279 Oncogene showed high levels of p120 staining in the cytoplasm , suggesting that p120 may be upregulated , it was unfortunate that we could not measure the levels of p120 mRNA in our tumors , since no RNA samples were available . Nonetheless , we compared the mRNA and protein levels of p120 in our primary lobular cultures with those in established breast cancer cell lines . Although we did not ﬁnd clear differences in the quantity of mRNA or protein , we observed that the largest p120 isoform ( isoform 1 ) was highly expressed in our primary lobular cultures , and the E - CD - negative cell lines , but not in the E - CD - positive cell lines analysed . A similar isoform 1 upregulation was observed in MDCK cells after transfection with E47 , Snail , or Slug , three potent transcriptional repressors of E - CD gene . Moreover , it has been widely reported that cadherin switching plays a role in cancer progression . Speciﬁcally , loss of E - CD and upregulation of the mesenchymal N - CD and cadherin - 11 occurs in a variety of carcinoma cells ( Tomita et al . , 2000 ) . Here , we conﬁrm previously reported data indicating that some E - CD - negative tumors and cell lines express N - CD ( as occur in our primary lobular cultures ) , and that N - CD expression may also be associated with an increase in p120 isoform 1 ( Husmark et al . , 1999 ; Tran et al . , 1999 ) . Since isoform 1 is characteristic of ﬁbroblast and highly motile cells ( Mo and Reynolds , 1996 ) , our data support the notion that cells with a ﬁbroblastic phenotype , lacking E - CD , and / or expressing N - CD may express a set of p120 isoforms that could play a role in the acquisition of a more invasive behavior . In fact , upregulation or loss of speciﬁc p120 isoforms has shown to contribute to a more invasive phenotype in tumor or normal cells ( Aho et al . , 2002 ) . Whether lobular breast carcinomas express mesenchymal cadherins is currently being investigated . Furthermore , several E - CD - negative breast cancer cell lines show endogenous p120 in the nucleus ( Van Hengel et al . , 1999 ; Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) and the induction of the dendritic phenotype seems to be associated with nuclear localization of some p120 isoforms ( Aho et al . , 2002 ) . We observed that p120 nuclear localization also occurred in lobular carcinoma . However , although the majority of lobular tumors accumulated cytoplasmic p120 , only 4 / 67 ( 6 % ) had prominent nuclear expression . This observation can be explained by the fact that a putative nuclear export signal with a characteristic leucine - rich motif is encoded by p120 exon B ( Van Hengel et al . , 1999 ) , which thus avoids p120 accumulation in the nucleus . In fact , after blocking the nuclear export of p120 by leptomycin - B treatment , nuclear localization of p120 was evident in our primary lobular tumor cultures . A nuclear binding partner of p120 is the recently identiﬁed transcription factor Kaiso ( Daniel and Reynolds , 1999 ) , which behaves as a methylation - dependent transcriptional repressor and is one of the two methyl - CpG binding complexes originally designated as MeCp1 ( Prokhortch - ouc et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , p120 may link events at the cell surface with DNA methylation - dependent gene silencing . Very recently , in vitro experiments have suggested a tumor suppressor role for p120 : SW48 colon cancer cells , which are deﬁcient in membranous p120 levels , harbor an inactivating mutation in p120 gene ( CTNND1 ) ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . This deﬁciency in SW48 cells results in strongly reduced levels of E - CD , which in turn lead to weakened intercellular adhesion . Restoring p120 rescues the epithelial phenotype and stabilizes E - CD to normal levels in cell – cell contacts , thereby implying that loss of p120 might be responsible for E - CD downregulation in some instances . Taken together , our data from breast cancer provide in vivo evidence that support a recently proposed model of a dual role for p120 as a tumor suppressor and metastasis promoter ( Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) . This model suggests that the function may depend on the order in which p120 or E - CD is downregulated . Thus , if p120 is lost ﬁrst ( as , perhaps , in ductal breast tumors ) , E - CD levels will fall signiﬁcantly , whereas if E - CD is lost ﬁrst ( as in lobular breast cancer ) , p120 may accumulate in the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus . At both cellular locations , p120 may play additional roles , such as regulation of transcriptional events or modula - tion of the motility behavior , which , as a result , promotes metastasis . Consistent with this , it is widely acknowledged that inactivation of E - CD gene is an early event in lobular tumorigenesis , since genetic alterations in CDH1 occur in LCIS ( Sarrio´ et al . , 2003 ) and , as we demonstrate here , in ALH . However , whether p120 loss in ductal tumors is due to genetic or epigenetic inactivation of CTNND1 gene remains to be demon - strated . Finally , from a diagnostic point of view , our study demonstrates that most ALH lesions show an abnormal pattern of expression of the E - CD – catenin molecules resembling that found in LCIS and ILC tumors ( absence of E - CD , and b - catenin staining and p120 cytoplasmic localization ) . Although some investigators consider ALH as a ‘risk indicator’ for the development of invasive cancer rather than true precursor lesions ( Lishman and Lakhani , 1999 ) , recent evidence has demonstrated that the genetic proﬁles of ALH and LCIS are similar to each other and to those of ILC ( Lu et al . , 1998 ) . Interestingly , although a larger series of ALHs needs to be studied to conﬁrm these preliminary results , we found that the early complete loss of E - CD expression in ALH may be a consequence of genetic alterations affecting CDH1 locus , such as LOH . Since LOH at CDH1 locus is a very common ﬁnding in ILCs , and bearing in mind our immunohistochemical results , our data point to a common origin for the ALH , LCIS , and ILC entities , and indicate that both ALH and LCIS are precursor lesions for ILC . The fact that ALH has a completely different pattern of E - CD and catenin immunostaining to ADH and ductal carcinomas occur - ring in the same breast raises the question of whether these ductal tumors arose from similar lobular lesions or from independent lesions of a distinct nature . In summary , altered expression of p120 may have different causes and consequences in ductal and lobular tumors . Cytoplasmic p120 localization , which occurs p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3280 Oncogene in the early stages of lobular neoplasia , and is maintained during lobular tumor progression to metas - tasis , may play an important role in mediating the oncogenic effects derived from E - CD inactivation , including enhanced motility and invasion . Materials and methods Tissue samples and tissue microarray construction A series of 326 formalin - ﬁxed parafﬁn - embedded breast tissue biopsies were acquired from the ﬁles of the Pathology Department of La Paz Hospital , Madrid , Spain . The series included 219 IDCs , 69 ILCs , 29 atypical lobular hyperplasias ( ALHs ) , and nine LCISs not associated with invasive carcinoma . The ILC tumors included 46 cases in which E - CD and b - catenin expression , and the molecular alterations underlying altered E - CD expression have been previously studied ( Sarrio´ et al . , 2003 ) . In all , 32 ILCs showed associated LCIS , and 50 % metastasis . The corresponding metastatic lesion was available for 13 ILCs . Ductal tumors were 17 . 5 % grade I , 33 . 3 % grade II , and 49 . 2 % grade III . Metastasis was found in 27 . 9 % of ductal tumors . Parafﬁn - embedded and frozen tissue samples were available in 46 of the IDCs . Representative areas from the inﬁltrating carcinomas were carefully selected on H & E - stained sections , and two tissue cores ( 1mm in diameter ) were obtained from each specimen . The tissue cores were precisely arrayed into a new parafﬁn block using a tissue microarray workstation ( Beecher Instru - ments , Silver Spring , MD , USA ) . Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical staining was performed by the LSAB ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) method with a heat - induced antigen retrieval step , as previously described . Mouse anti - human E - CD ( 4A2C7 , Zymed , San Francisco , CA ) , anti - b - catenin , and anti - p120 ( both from Transduction Labs , Lexington , KY ) monoclonal antibodies were applied at dilutions of 1 : 200 , 1 : 1000 , and 1 : 500 , respectively . All studied TMAs also included normal breast tissue as an internal control . In negative controls , the primary antibodies were omitted . Three pathologists ( JP , BPM , and DH ) simultaneously evaluated the immunohistochemistry , and immunoreactivity was scored as absent ( no staining ) , reduced or weak ( intensity weaker to that observed in normal ducts ) , normal ( same intensity ) , and strong ( at least twice the intensity of normal cells ) . Localization was scored as membranous or cytoplasmic depending on the predominant expression pattern . Laser capture microdissection , DNA extraction , and assessment of loss of heterozygosity at CDH1 locus Epithelial cells from the selected ALH lesions ( n ¼ 7 ) and normal ducts were extracted by a membrane - based laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) technique , performed essentially as described before ( Moreno - Bueno et al . , 2002 ) . The experimental conditions and the method used for LOH calculation have been previously reported ( Sarrio´ et al . , 2003 ) . Immunoprecipitation of c - Src and in vitro kinase assay Frozen biopsies were powdered in liquid nitrogen and approximately 4mg of each biopsy was extracted with 1ml of lysis buffer ( 10m M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 10m M sodium pyrophosphate pH 7 . 4 , 10m M NaF , 5 m M EDTA , 130m M NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 m M Na 3 VO 4 , 1m M phenyl - methylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 1 m M phenantroline , 1m M benzami - dine hydrochloride , 1 m M iodoacetamide ) for 1h at 4 1 C in an orbital shaker . Lysates were then clariﬁed by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 30 min at 4 1 C . Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the lysate protein with 1 m g of anti - Src 327 mAb ( a gift from JS Brugge , Harvard University , Boston ) for 2 h at 4 1 C . Immune complexes were then used for in vitro Src kinase assay following the previously described method ( Fresno Vara et al . , 2000 ) . Cell culture , transfection , and treatments MDCK cell lines , human breast cancer cell lines ( MCF7 , T47D , MDA - 231 , and MDA - 435 ) , and non - breast cancer cell lines ( HeLa , HaCaT and HUVEC ) were grown in DMEM medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , and 1 % penicillin – streptomycin ( PS ) . All cells were routinely cultured in 5 % CO 2 at 37 1 C . MDCK cells stably transfected with either Snail , E - 47 , Slug , or the empty vector ( MDCK - CMV ) have been previously reported ( Cano et al . , 2000 ; Perez - Moreno et al . , 2001 ; Bolos et al . , 2003 ) . To generate primary cell cultures from lobular breast carcinomas , a piece of fresh tumor tissue was obtained from the hospitals involved in the study ( see Acknowledgements ) on the day of surgery . The tissue was immediately cut into small pieces using sterile surgical blades , and then digested with collagenase for 1 – 2h at 37 1 C . Released tumoral cells were washed with PBS buffer and then plated into F25 culture ﬂasks containing Ham - F10 medium supplemented with 20 % FCS , 1 % PS , and 1 % Ultroser G . All media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Ltd , Paisley , UK . All primary cultures were grown in the presence of cholera toxin ( Sigma Chemicals , St Louis , MO , USA ) to inhibit ﬁbroblast growth , and stayed viable at least until passage 10 . For demethylation experiments , cell lines were grown in the appropriate media in the presence of the demethylating agent 5Aza ( from Sigma ) at a concentration of 5 m M for 4 days . To inhibit nuclear export of p120 , cells were treated with leptomycin - B ( Sigma ) at a concentration of 5 ng / ml for 18h . Immunoﬂuorescence and Western blotting For immunoﬂuorescence experiments , cultured cells were ﬁxed in 100 % methanol at (cid:4) 20 1 C for 5min . The primary antibodies used were rat anti - E - CD ( DECMA - 1 from Sigma ) , anti - p120 ( dilution 1 : 250 ) , and anticytokeratins ( AE1 / AE3 from Bio - meda , dilution 1 : 500 ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa594 - coupled anti - mouse Ig , and FITC - coupled anti - rat Ig ( Mole - cular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) . Cells were counterstained using 4 , 6 - diaminidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Molecular Probes ) . For Western blotting , cells were lysed on the culture dishes , and proteins were extracted using standard RIPA buffer . Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA ) , and equal amounts were loaded in 6 % SDS – PAGE gels . Polypeptides were transferred onto Immobilon - P ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) nitrocellu - lose membranes , and nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk . Each blot was independently incubated with each of the following monoclonal antibodies : anti - p120 ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) , anti - E - CD ( 1 : 1000 ) , anti - N - CD ( 3B9 , Zymed , 1 : 500 ) , or 6H11 monoclonal antibody ( a generous gift from Al Reynolds ; Vanderbilt University , Nashville , TN , USA ) . 6H11 antibody speciﬁcally recognizes the longest p120 isoforms , and was used at 1 m g / ml . Anti - a - tubulin ( Sigma , p120 expression in breast cancer D Sarrio´ et al 3281 Oncogene 1 : 10000 ) was used in all the blots as a loading control . Anti - mouse Ig HRP - conjugated secondary antibody ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK , 1 : 1000 dilution ) was used and visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit ( Amersham ) . In some cases , the membranes were stripped using the adequate buffer ( 10 m M Tris pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 0 . 1 M 2 - mercaptoethanol ) for 15min at 65 1 C , and reprobed with other primary antibodies . RT – PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from the different cell lines using RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was synthesized using RT – PCR AMV Kit ( Promega Co . , Madison , WI , USA ) and was subsequently used for PCR ampliﬁcation of E - CD ( using primers and conditions as reported in Kohy et al . , 2002 ) , and p120 ( primers Ex10F2 and Ex12R1 as reported in Keiserbilck et al . , 1998 ) . To estimate the levels of p120 mRNA , a semiquantitative RT – PCR was performed using b 2 - microglo - bulin ( predeveloped Kit assay , PE Biosystems , Warrington , UK ) as an internal control . Abundance of p120 mRNA relative to control mRNA was measured using Quantity One Software 4 . 1 ( BioRad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . To analyse the p120 mRNA isoform proﬁle , we amplify the 5 0 region of p120 mRNA using the Ex1F6 and Ex5R1 primers as previously reported ( Keiserbilck et al . , 1998 ) . All the ampliﬁed bands were excised from the gel , puriﬁed using Gel Extraction Kit ( Qiagen ) and sequenced to identify the p120 mRNA tran - scripts . Statistical analysis The contingency test with Yates correction or Fisher’s exact test , and Student’s t - test were performed where appropriate to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of the relationships between the variables analysed . The SPSS 10 . 1 software package for Windows ( SPSS , Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) was used .
