These processes are mediated by When T cells are plated on lipid bilayers containing ICAM - 1 , the ligand for LFA - 1 , the cells spread , forming the binding of a novel SH3 - containing protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 . Binding of this a large broad junction as visualized by interference re - flection microscopy ( IRM , Figure 1A ) . In contrast , when novel protein , called CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) , to CD2 is induced by T - cell activation and is required T cells are plated on lipid bilayers containing CD58 , the ligand for human CD2 , cells round up and CD2 clusters , for CD2 clustering and T - cell polarization . Thus , CD2AP seems likely to function as a molecular scaffold for re - forming a small , discrete junction ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . We next tested the behavior of Jurkat T cells on lipid ceptor patterning and cytoskeletal polarization . Both of these events are critical to the formation of an effective bilayers containing fluorescently labeled CD48 ( green ) and ICAM - 1 ( red ) .

After 60 min at 37 (cid:56) C the cells were fixed and observed by IRM . The gray IRM images were used to generate the black segments shown . The average areas of greater than 100 contacts for each cell type are summarized in ( D ) . These data are representative of three experi - ments . Clustering and Segregation of CD2 Requires Figure 3 . The Cytoplasmic Domain of CD2 Regulates Cytoskeletal Its Cytoplasmic Domain Polarity To determine the molecular basis for CD2 clustering Jurkat T cells expressing wild - type rat CD2 ( FL , panel A ) , rat CD2 with a 97 – amino acid cytoplasmic tail ( CY97 , panel B ) , or rat after contact formation , we began by testing whether CD2 with a 6 – amino acid cytoplasmic tail ( CY6 , not shown ) were the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 was required . Jurkat treated with PMA and ionomycin and incubated on planar bilayers cells stably transfected with either full - length rat CD2 containing1000 molec / (cid:109) m 2 ofmouseorratCD48 . Cellsweretreated or forms ofCD2 lacking eitherthe complete cytoplasmic with 10 ng / ml PMA and 1 (cid:109) M ionomycin . After 60 min the cells were domain ( CY6 ) or the 20 C - terminal residues ( CY97 ) were fixed and the position of the MTOC determined by fluorescence activated and tested for their ability to cluster CD2 by microscopy . ( C ) indicates the criteria for scoring a cellas polarized . This cylindrical volume represents approximately 1 % of the cyto - measuring contact size ( He et al . , 1988 ; Figure 2 ) . The plasmic volume such that this positioning of the MTOC is unlikely use of rat CD2 allowed us to distinguish mutated CD2 to occur at random . The data in ( D ) are from two experiments . molecules from the wild - type human CD2 present in Jurkat cells . Unlike cells expressing wild - type CD2 , T cells expressingeitherofthe two truncatedforms ofCD2 localization of CD2 requires the C - terminal 20 residues formed larger , more heterogeneous junctions ( Figure 2 ) . of CD2 . This suggested that the last 20 residues of the cyto - plasmic domain of CD2 were required for the normal regulation of CD2 junction size . The Cytoplasmic Domain of CD2 Can Mediate T - Cell Polarization We next tested the ability of mutated forms of CD2 to segregate in the center of the junction when plated Because contact formation is the first step in cell polar - ization , we tested whether T - cell activation and CD2 on lipid bilayers containing both CD48 and ICAM - 1 . CD2 molecules lacking the complete cytoplasmic domain clustering might be sufficient to induce T - cell polariza - tion . Polarizationof Tcells is characterizedby the move - ( data not shown ) or the C - terminal 20 residues did not concentrate at the center of the contact , but rather were ment of the Golgi complexand the microtubule - organiz - ing center ( MTOC ) to a region of the cytoplasm just distributed throughout the entire contact ( Figure 1 H ) . Visualization of ICAM - 1 demonstrated that it was still adjacent to the area of contact ( Kupfer et al . , 1986 ) . T cells expressing wild - type or truncated forms of CD2 excluded from contact areas containing engaged CD2 ( Figure 1I ) . This suggests that extracellular CD2 engage - were plated on CD48 , fixed , and then stained with anti - tubulin to mark the position of the MTOC . The MTOC ment is primarily responsible for ICAM - 1 exclusion and , consistent with our topological model , that CD2 / CD48 was then visualized by optical sectioning microscopy ( Figures 3A and 3B ) , and cells were scored positive for and LFA - 1 / ICAM interactions are mutually exclusive ( Shaw and Dustin , 1997 ) . Our data therefore suggest polarization if the MTOC was visible within 1 (cid:109) m of the planar bilayer and 1 (cid:109) m of the contact center ( Figure that initial segregation of adhesion molecules in contact areas is mediated bysize incompatibility , but the central 3C ) . Greater than 80 % of the cells expressing wild - type Cell670 CD2 were polarized , but significantly fewer cells ex - pressing either of the cytoplasmic truncations of CD2 were polarized ( Figure 3D ) . This establishes that the last 20 residues ofthe CD2 cytoplasmic domain are required for CD2 clustering and T - cell polarization and suggests that both processes may be linked . Identification of a Novel SH3 - Containing Protein that Interacts with the Cytoplasmic Tail of CD2 Examination ofthelast 20 residuesofCD2 demonstrates the presence of multiple proline residues that could serve as ligands for conserved protein binding modules such as SH3 domains . SH3 domains are found in a wide variety of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins and bind proline - rich sequences . We used the yeast two - hybrid screen to identify CD2 - interacting proteins ( Fields and Song , 1989 ; Vojtek et al . , 1993 ) . From a mouse embryo library , a partial cDNA encoding a novel SH3 domain was identified . The protein bound specifically to CD2 as expression of the DNA - binding domain of LexA alone or a control fusionprotein , LexA - lamin , did not transacti - vate the reporter construct ( data not shown ) . A full - length cDNAwas obtained byscreening a cDNA library from mouse thymus . The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a 641 amino acid protein with a mo - lecular weight of approximately 70 kDa ( Figure 4A ) con - taining three SH3 domains in the amino - terminal half of Figure 4 .

It was also expressed in approximately 80 kD , and the first CD2AP SH3 domain fibroblast cell lines . alone were coprecipitated efficiently with the G / CD2 chimeric protein ( Figures 5B and 5C , lane 2 ) . This was specific because no association was detected when The First SH3 Domain of CD2AP Binds to a Proline Sequence at the C Terminus of CD2 CD2AP was coexpressed with a construct that contains only the extracellular and transmembrane domains of To define the features of CD2AP and CD2 that mediate their interaction , we first tested whether the interaction VSV G , G T (cid:50) ( Figures 5B and 5C , lane 1 ) . Receptor Patterning in T - Cell Contacts 671 for complex formation . Deletion of P1 or P2 alone or together had no effect on the ability ofCD2 to coprecipi - tate with CD2AP ( Figure 5B , lane 3 and data not shown ) . Deletion of P3 , however , completely abrogated the abil - ity of CD2 to coprecipitate CD2AP ( Figure 5B , lane 4 ) . Therefore , CD2AP interacts witha proline - richsequence contained within the last 30 residues of the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 . Three overlapping 20 - mer peptides based on the last 30 residues of CD2 were generated and tested for bind - ing using surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) . Only one peptide containing the amino - terminal 20 of the last 27 residues of the CD2 cytoplasmic domain was sufficient for binding ( see below and data not shown ) . Mutagene - sis data demonstrated that the primary binding site is a Type II SH3 ligand ( PPLPRPR ) and five to seven C - terminal flanking residues to the motif are required for binding ( data not shown ) . Thus , CD2AP binding to CD2 requires sequences that are lacking in the CY97 form of CD2 . Cloning of the first SH3 domain of CD2AP in the origi - nal yeast screen demonstrated that it was sufficient by itself to mediate the interaction between CD2 and CD2AP . However , the presence of multiple proline - rich segments in CD2 and multiple SH3 domains in CD2AP suggested that other interactions between CD2 and CD2AP might also occur . We tested this by generating Figure 5 .

T cells ( D ) Activation - dependent association between CD2 and CD2AP in can also be activated by ligation of CD2 with specific Jurkat T cells .

As expected , treatment with either of the anti - CD2 antibodies alone had no effect on the association ( data not shown ) . The association of CD2AP with CD2 To define the segment of CD2 that interacts with is therefore regulated by T - cell activation . CD2AP , we focused on proline - rich sequences because they are known to bind to SH3 domains ( Ren et al . , 1993 ) .

A GST pressed with the first SH3 domain of CD2AP and tested Cell672 to either the peptide or the SH3 domain , we compared the ability of a wide variety of SH3 domains to bind to the CD2 peptide ( Figure 6B ) . Each of the SH3 proteins was purified as a GST fusion protein and binding was compared at a concentration of 1 (cid:109) M by SPR . At this concentration , only the CD2AP SH3 domain exhibited significant binding . Direct affinity measurements of the FynandLck SH3domainsforthe CD2peptidegenerated affinity values of 15 – 20 (cid:109) M , consistent with those pre - viously reported for SH3 domains from Src kinases ( Rickles et al . , 1995 ) . A Dominant - Negative Form of CD2AP Disrupts Receptor Patterning and Cell Polarization To confirm the involvement of CD2AP , we tested whether a truncated form of CD2AP could block recep - tor patterning by inhibiting wild - type CD2AP binding to CD2 . A chimeric protein was generated consisting of the first two SH3 domains of CD2AP fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . We reasoned that this protein should bind constitutively to CD2 , but might inhibit CD2AP function because it lacks most of the other pro - tein - binding motifs of wild - type CD2AP . The chimera , CD2AP SH3 - GFP , was transiently expressed in Jurkat T cells . T cells were plated on lipid bilayers containing ICAM - 1 and CD58 24 – 30 hr after transfection . As GFP fluorescence is similar to fluorescein , CD58 was labeled with TRITC ( yellow in Figure 7 ) and ICAM - 1 was labeled with Cy5 ( redin Figure 7 ) . Visualization of LFA - 1 engage - ment wasenhanced byusing ICAM - 1dimers with higher Figure 6 .

These data support the idea that CD2AP binding to CD2 mediates the ability of CD2 to induce T - cell polarization and receptor patterning . fusion protein containing the first SH3 domain was puri - fied and its affinity towards a CD2 peptide ( residues 317 – 337 ) was determined by measuring the kinetics of Antigen Receptor Engagement Triggers CD2 Clustering binding as well as by Scatchard analysis .

These data are consistent with earlier reports that anti - leads to suppression of T - cell locomotion , formation of a specialized junction , and T - cell polarization ( Kupfer gen receptor engagement regulates CD2 avidity ( Hahn et al . , 1992 ) and with studies demonstrating that T - cell and Singer , 1989 ; Dustin etal . , 1997a ) . This combination of aspecialized junction , cell polarization , and positional polarization is mediated primarily by TCR engagement ( Kupferet al . , 1986 ; Lowin - Kropfet al . , 1998 ) . Our results stability bears a striking similarity to the classical syn - apse of the nervous system ( Paul and Seder , 1994 ) . The directly demonstrate antigen - regulated CD2 / CD48 in - teractions . We suspect that the small amounts of CD2 “immunological synapse” is characterized by a specific pattern of molecules in the contact ; LFA - 1 is localized engagement detected in the absence of antigen allow the TCRto scanforMHC - peptide complexesin the small to the periphery of the contact while the TCR and acces - sory molecules like CD2 , CD4 , and CD28 are localized 15 nmcontactareas .

The orchestratedreceptor movementsthat character - of events leading to T - cell activation . Increased LFA - 1 avidityandCD2 clusteringwould resultin immunological ize formation of the immunological synapse have two key features : ( 1 ) segregation of surface molecules into synapse formation . Synapse formation would allow the rare specific peptide / MHC complex to serially trigger a least two domains and ( 2 ) the localizationof one group of molecules in a central cluster . Here we have identified multiple TCRs ( Valitutti et al . , 1995 ) . The structure of CD2AP supports an important role some of the mechanisms for molecular segregation and for CD2AP in contact formation and polarization . In formation of the central cluster . yeast , the protein BEM1 , which contains two amino - Recently , we proposed that the forces that govern terminal SH3 domains , is required for cell polarization contact cap formation are likely to include the size of ( Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) . It functions by organizing the the molecules involved ( Shaw and Dustin , 1997 ) . This cytoskeleton around the polarized site where budding was based on the fact that the molecules that occupy will take place ( Peterson et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , BEM1 is the central region of the immunological synapse share thought to link membrane proteins that mark the site a common topology . Structural data indicate that the of polarization with the cytoskeleton .

In contrast , the LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 interaction is Although T cells from mice lacking CD2 do not exhibit predicted to span (cid:122) 30 – 40 nm ( Staunton et al . , 1990 ) . In a significant phenotype ( Kileen etal . , 1992 ) , the simplest fact , ICAM - 1 alone is (cid:122) 20 nm long , too large to be easily explanation is that another molecule can compensate accommodated in the 15 nm gap .

The end result of this ac - cytoskeletal polarization and immunological synapse tivity is that TCR engagement is protected in a stable formation .

Understanding these tant role in maintaining a stable domain for sustained forces in greater detail will lead to a more profound antigen receptor engagement and signaling . understanding of the process of T - cell activation . Antigen receptor engagement is the central event in the formation of the immunological synapse ( Paul and Experimental Procedures Seder , 1994 ) . Therefore , it is significant that we found that CD2 engagement and clustering is dependent on Antibodies antigen receptor engagement .
