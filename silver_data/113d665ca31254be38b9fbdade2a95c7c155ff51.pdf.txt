Purification of IRSp53 constructs and design FRET reporters . ( a ) SDS – PAGE showing purified IRSp53 fragments and GTPases ( see also Supplementary Fig . 2 for gels of IRSp53 FL and Eps8 ) . ( b ) Design of the FL and BAR – SH3 FRET reporters . Endogenous Cys230 and a C - terminal cysteine added by mutagenesis ( Cys519 or Cys452 ) were first under - labeled with the donor probe fluorescein maleimide and then labeled to saturation with the acceptor probe tetramethylrhodamine maleimide ( Methods ) . In the structure of the BAR domain ( PDB ID : 1WDZ ) Cys230 falls 53 Å apart from its counterpart in the second molecule of the dimer . The BAR domain has a rigid structure that is not expected to change much upon binding to targets or the membrane . Only reporters containing a donor - acceptor pair will show a change in energy transfer . Molecules that compete with autoinhibitory interactions ( GTPases , effectors and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 itself ) would be expected to induce a conformational change in the reporter , resulting in a decrease in energy transfer . ( c ) Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis of tryptic peptides derived from wild type IRSp53 after labeling with fluorescein maleimide . Based on a fluorescein - to - protein ratio of 1 : 1 , IRSp53 was found to be labeled at a single cysteine residue . MS / MS fragmentation of a tryptic peptide with m / z 635 . 74 containing Cys230 ( 229 QCAVAKNSAAYHSK 242 ) produces a series of b - ions . The masses of all the b - ions are 427 . 36 Da higher than their theoretical masses , corresponding to the mass of the fluorescein maleimide probe .

( a ) Size exclusion chromatography elution profiles of IRSp53 , Eps8 , IRSp53 – Eps8 complex compared to protein standards with known Stokes radii ( 1 , thyroglobulin ; 2 , aldolase ; 3 , albumin ; 4 , ribonuclease - A ) . IRSp53 and Eps8 are both elongated in solution , and migrate with apparent MW higher than expected from their theoretical masses . SDS – PAGE analysis identifies the fraction volume corresponding to the peak for each protein . The gel filtration fraction volumes of IRSp53 , Eps8 , and IRSp53 – Eps8 are plotted against those of the protein standards to determine their Stokes radii . ( b ) Glycerol gradient ( 10 – 40 % ) sedimentation of IRSp53 , Eps8 , and IRSp53 – Eps8 compared to protein standards ( 1’ , chymotrypsinogen ; 2’ , albumin ; 3’ , aldolase ; 4’ , catalase ) with known Svedberg coefficients . The sedimentation fraction volumes of IRSp53 , Eps8 , and IRSp53 – Eps8 are plotted against those of the protein standards to determine their sedimentation velocities . The buffer used in both experiments was 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM EDTA . The table compares the theoretical masses of the samples to the experimentally determined values . The Stokes radii and the sedimentation velocities were used to calculate the MW of each sample according to the equation 1 : MW = α × S R × S v .

( a – d ) Cells coexpressing GFP and RFP , GFP and mCherry – Cdc42 G12V , FL – GFP and RFP , FL – GFP and mCherry – Cdc42 G12V . The intensity profiles of actin , GFP ( or FL – GFP ) and RFP ( or mCherry – Cdc42 G12V ) along line - scans ( indicated by a white lines ) are shown on the right . Note that when expressed alone , IRSp53 localizes in patches along the leading edge , whereas its plasma membrane localization becomes more uniform when coexpressed with Cdc42 G12V .

ITC titration of 400 µ M GMPPNP – Cdc42 G12V into 15 µ M BAR – SH3 constructs carrying mutations within the CRIB and PR regions that disrupt binding . Nature Structural and Molecular Biology : doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2781 6 Supplementary Figure 5 . Mutations that disrupt autoinhibitory interactions . ( a ) In the structure of the CRIB – PR bound to Cdc42 G12V , the canonical 278 PxxP 281 site is partially exposed , potentially allowing for competitive binding of the SH3 domain of IRSp53 itself or a binding partner . Such mechanism of competitive binding is illustrated here by superimposing a SH3 – peptide complex ( PDB ID : 1W70 2 ) onto the structure of the CRIB – PR bound to Cdc42 G12V . SH3 residue P428 and CRIB – PR residues P278 and P281 were mutated to test this model . ( b ) Cells coexpressing FL – GFP mutant P428L with RFP or with mCherry – Cdc42 G12V , and quantification of the number of filopodia per cell , filopodia length and percentage of filopodia filled with actin ( as described in Fig . 4 , main text ) . The data for filopodia per cell are presented as mean ± SEM . The total number of cells quantified is indicated inside each bar . * P < 0 . 005 by two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test . Zoomed - in regions ( white box ) are shown separately for Cdc42 G12V , IRSp53 and actin . Scale bars : 10 µ m .

( a ) The CRIB – PR can sense the nucleotide state of Cdc42 . Comparison of GMPPNP – Cdc42 G12V ( gray ) and GDP – Cdc42 ( slate blue ; PDB ID : 1A4R 3 ) showing that switch I ( residues 30 – 38 ) is open ( green ) in the GDP - bound state and closed ( yellow ) in the GMPPNP - and CRIB – PR - bound state . The conformation of switch II ( residues 57 – 72 ) remains mostly unchanged in the GDP - bound ( magenta ) and GMPPNP - bound ( purple ) states . ( b ) Specificity of the CRIB – PR for Cdc42 . Residue conservation scores were calculated with the programs ConSurf 4 based on the sequences of the two human isoforms of Cdc42 ( UniProt ID : P60953 - 1 and - 2 ) and the three human isoforms of Rac ( Rac1 , P63000 ; Rac2 , P15153 ; Rac3 , P60763 ) . The conservation scores were displayed on the surface of the structure of Cdc42 using the program Pymol ( Schrödinger ) . The close - up on the bottom ( boxed region ) highlights sequence variation between Cdc42 and Rac3 ( PDB ID : 2QME ) at the CRIB – PR interface . Side chains that differ between the two GTPases are highlighted in the structure and in a sequence alignment ( red / salmon ) .
