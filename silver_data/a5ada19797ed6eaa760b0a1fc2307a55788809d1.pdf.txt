Rothman , * Yongli Zhang * Soluble N - ethylmaleimide – sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) proteins drive membrane fusion by assembling into a four - helix bundle in a zippering process . Here , we used optical tweezers to observe in a cell - free reconstitution experiment in real time a long - sought SNARE assembly intermediate in which only the membrane - distal amino - terminal half of the bundle is assembled . Our findings support the zippering hypothesis , but suggest that zippering proceeds through three sequential binary switches , not continuously , in the amino - and carboxyl - terminal halves of the bundle and the linker domain . The half - zippered intermediate was stabilized by externally applied force that mimicked the repulsion between apposed membranes being forced to fuse . This intermediate then rapidly and forcefully zippered , delivering free energy of 36 k B T ( where k B is Boltzmann ’ s constant and T is temperature ) to mediate fusion . S oluble N - ethylmaleimide – sensitive factor at - tachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) pro - teins mediate membrane fusion in the cell , and in particular the fusion of vesicles stored at nerve endings to release neurotransmitters for syn - aptic transmission ( 1 , 2 ) . The neuronal SNAREs consist of vesicle - associated membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 , also called synaptobrevin ) on the ves - icle membrane ( v - SNARE ) and the binary com - plex of syntaxin 1 and SNAP - 25 on the plasma membrane ( target or t - SNARE ) ( 3 , 4 ) . Together these SNAREs drive membrane fusion by join - ing into a parallel four - helix bundle ( 4 ) , which is envisioned to zipper progressively toward the membranes ( 5 ) , providing force that overcomes an estimated energy barrier of > 40 k B T ( where k B is Boltzmann ’ s constant and T is temperature ) ( 6 ) . Considerable indirect evidence favors the zipper - ing hypothesis ( 7 – 12 ) , but direct observation of the assembly intermediates and accurate charac - terization of the zippering energy and kinetics have been lacking . We developed a single - molecule manipula - tion assay to investigate SNARE assembly based on high - resolution dual - trap optical tweezers ( Fig . 1A ) . Wecross - linkedtheNterminiofsyntaxin and VAMP2 by a disulfide bridge and attached syntaxin by its C terminus to one bead and VAMP2 to another through a DNA handle ( 13 ) . The experiment was started with a single preas - sembled SNARE complex containing truncated syntaxin ( 187 – 265 ) and VAMP2 ( 25 – 92 ) and full - length SNAP - 25 ( 4 , 14 ) to avoid misassembled SNARE by - products ( 10 , 15 ) . The protein - DNA conjugate extended with the increasing pulling force in a nonlinear manner predicated by the worm - like chain model ( Fig . 1B and fig . S2 ) . However , the monotonic force and extension curves were interrupted by abrupt changes caused by SNARE disassembly or re - assembly ( Fig . 1C ) . Fast reversible transitions ap - peared in two force regions , the first in the range of 8 to 13 pN with ~ 3 - nm average extension change ( Fig . 1D and fig . S3 ) and the second in the range of 14 to 19 pN with ~ 7 - nm extension change ( Fig . 1D and fig . S4 ) . Both transitions occurred between two states ( fig . S5 and table S1 ) , manifesting two distinct binary switches in SNAREs . When the linker domain ( LD ) of VAMP2 was deleted , the first transition disap - peared , whereas the second transition remained ( fig . S6 ) . Thus , the first transition is caused by reversible folding and unfolding of the LD alone . The average size of the extension change sug - gests that a total of 22 ( T 3 , SD ) amino acids or 10 amino acids in VAMP2 ( 83 – 92 ) participated in the transition ( fig . S7A ) . This observation is con - sistent with a fully zippered LD in a coiled - coil conformation in solution ( Fig . 1B , state 1 ) as seen in the crystal structure of the SNARE complex ( 4 , 16 ) . Further deletion into the C - terminal SNARE domain of VAMP2 ( Vc ) abolished the second transition ( fig . S8 ) , which suggests that this VAMP2 region is involved in the transition . The additional ~ 7 - nm extension increase from the LD unfolded state ( Fig . 1B , state 2 ) leads to a partially zippered SNARE state ( state 3 , Fig . 1E ) . To derive the structure , energy , and kinetics as - sociated with this state , we measured the real - time transition involving Vc at different mean forces ( Fig . 1D ) . The fast two - state transition was confirmed by hidden - Markov modeling ( HMM ) ( 17 ) and the histogram distribution of extension ( figs . S5B and S9 ) . On the basis of the measured extension change and an asymmetrical transition model ( fig . S10 ) ( 18 ) , we found that 26 ( T 3 ) amino acids in VAMP2 ( 57 – 82 ) were unzipped in the partial SNARE complex ( Fig . 1E ) . This places the interface of the unzipped Vc and the zippered N - terminal VAMP2 ( Vn ) at residue 56 ( T 5 , SD ; T 1 , SEM ) or at the central ionic layer of the bundle . This ionic layer is one of the most evolutionarily conserved features of all SNAREs ( 19 ) , yet with unclear functions . Thus , our result suggests a possible role of the ionic layer in sta - bilizing the half - zippered neuronal SNARE struc - ture crucial for regulation of membrane fusion ( 7 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 20 ) . The half unfolding probability of Vc ( Fig . 2A ) determines an average equilibrium force ( f eq ) of 17 ( T 2 SD , n = 76 ) pN , which can be defined as the maximum force output of Vc zippering aver - aged over the accompanying extension change . This force is the highest equilibrium force re - ported for any coiled - coil proteins ( 17 ) , including the designed strongest known coiled coil desig - nated as pIL with an equilibrium force of 12 . 4 pN ( 21 ) . The unfolding probability could be extra - polated to zero force ( 14 , 17 , 22 ) to reveal the Vc zippering free energy of 28 ( T 3 ) k B T , higher than the folding energy of pIL [ 24 ( T 1 ) k B T ] despite pIL ’ s greater length ( 33 amino acids ) ( 21 ) . The average Vc zippering rate at the maxi - mum force output ( ~ 160 s − 1 ) ( Fig . 2B ) is also greater than the equilibrium rate of pIL ( ~ 10 s − 1 ) ( 21 ) . Yet the rate is much less than the estimated DepartmentofCellBiology , YaleUniversitySchoolofMedicine , 333 Cedar Street , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

However , the Vc zippering rate increases exponentially as the opposing force drops ( Fig . 2B ) ( 17 ) , reaching the required rate for synaptic fusion at a predicted force of 14 pN . This means that a single SNARE complex in prin - ciple can generate a high average force of 14 pN during membrane fusion . When further extra - polatedtozeroforce ( 14 ) , theVczipperingbecomes downhill and barrierless , with a rate estimated to be ~ 1 × 10 6 s − 1 ( 21 ) , corresponding to the rate of the coil - to - helix transition and diffusion of the Vc polypeptide ( 24 ) . This fast zippering rate is par - tially attributed to the largely ordered t - SNARE complex that serves as a template for Vc zip - pering ( figs . S10 and S11 ) ( 18 ) . In conclusion , the extraordinarily high force output , energy , and rate qualify Vc zippering as the major power stroke for the fast synaptic fusion ( 11 ) . Similarly , we measured a folding energy of 8 ( T 2 ) k B T for LD ( fig . S7 , B and C ) with a max - imum force output close to that of pIL ( ~ 12 pN ) . An energy barrier of 5 ( T 2 ) k B T was derived , correspondingto a zipping rate of 7× 10 3 ( 9 ×10 2 to 5 × 10 4 ) s − 1 at zero force . LD also strongly and rapidly zippers , which may transduce and aug - ment the Vc zippering energy to drive membrane fusion . LD ’ s zippering rate and energy may be in - creased by transmembrane domains ( 25 ) and pro - teinssuchassynaptotagminandMunc18 - 1 ( 3 , 26 ) .

S12 ) . When imme - diately relaxed , the SNARE complex first fol - lowed a different force - extension curve ( FEC ) to reach lower force ( Fig . 1B ) . As the force was lowered to 3 to 10 pN , the complex fully and cooperatively reassembled . The dynamic disassembly and reassembly of a single SNARE complex could be repeated for many cycles of pull and relaxation ( fig . S2 ) . How - ever , when the t - SNARE complex was pulled to a higher force ( in the range of 15 to 28 pN ) , one additional irreversible extension jump was ob - served ( Fig . 2C , from states 4 to 5 , and fig . S11 ) . No more transitions were seen when further pull - ing to even higher forces ( > 30 pN ) , indicating complete unfolding of the SNARE complex ( state 5 ) . Thus , this jump may correspond to unfolding oftheremainingt - SNARE complex . When relaxed tolowforces ( < 3pN ) , amajority ( ~ 85 % ) ofsyntaxin and VAMP2 conjugates could not reassemble ( Fig . 2C and fig . S2 ) , suggesting dissociation of the SNAP - 25 molecule . To further test the dependence of SNARE assembly on SNAP - 25 , we repeated the above experiment by adding SNAP - 25 in the solution . Single SNARE complexes were fully disassem - bled by being pulled to high forces and then relaxed to detect SNARE reassembly . At 0 . 2 m M SNAP - 25 , the ternary SNARE complex could reassemble at a low force ( 3 to 10 pN ) with a probability of ~ 0 . 8 for each round of relaxation ( Fig . 2C ) . This reassembly was always followed by formation of the t - SNARE complex in a high - er force range ( > 12 pN ) . The SNAP - 25 molecule in solution could bind to the syntaxin - VAMP2 conjugate and initiate de novo SNARE assembly . Comparing this to the experiment in the absence of SNAP - 25 suggests that the binary t - SNARE is required for SNARE zippering ( 27 ) . In con - trast , the affinity between syntaxin and VAMP2 in the absence of SNAP - 25 is minimal and could not be detected in our experiments ( Fig . 2C ) ( 10 , 28 ) . TheassemblyanddisassemblyoftheN - terminal domain ( NTD ) occurred with a large force hys - teresis , indicating a large energy barrier for NTD transitions and preventing us from measuring its association energy . To gain insight into NTD ’ s assembly mechanism , we pulled a single SNARE complexfromtheN - terminiofsyntaxinandVAMP2 ( Fig . 3A ) ( 14 ) . The SNARE complex unzipped into t - and v - SNAREs ( from states 1 ′ to 3 ′ ) in two parallel pathways . About two - thirds of the 53 complexes tested showed one - step unzipping ( FECs i and iii ) , whereas other complexes ex - hibited two - step unzipping via a transient inter - mediate state ( state 2´ ) . Reversible transitions were often observed between this state and the fully zippered state 1´ ( Fig . 3B ) and lasted long enough for the equilibrium transition force and the aver - age extension change to be determined . This par - tially zippered SNARE complex had Vn unzipped to residue 57 ( T 3 , SEM ) , or approximately the ionic layer . The Vn domain unzipped at a higher average equilibrium force of 18 . 5 ( T 0 . 4 , SEM ) pN than Vc from C - terminal pull at 16 . 7 ( T 0 . 2 , SEM ) pN . In addition , the average extension change of Vn ( 8 . 3 T 0 . 2 , SEM , nm ) was greater than that of Vc ( 7 . 1 T 0 . 1 , SEM , nm ) . These measurements allow an estimation of the folding free energy of 35 ( T 4 ) k B T for NTD assembly in the presence of the preassembled C - terminal do - main ( CTD ) ( 14 , 17 ) . However , Vn assembled much more slowly than Vc ( Fig . 3B ) . The t - SNARE complex again remained intact after VAMP2 was pulled out ( Fig . 3 , state 3 ′ ) . This complex has a structure similar to those ob - tained from the C - terminal pull ( table S1 ) . On average , the t - SNARE complex contained 61 ( T 4 ) helical amino acids in the syntaxin mole - cule , suggesting an approximately fully assem - bled three - helix bundle for the t - SNARE ( figs . S10 and S11 ) . Upon relaxation , the ternary complex could reassemble at an average force of 3 . 2 ( T 0 . 2 , SEM ) pN ( Fig . 3 , FEC i ) , compared to 5 . 0 ( T 0 . 2 , SEM ) pN from the C - terminal pull . The more force - sensitive assembly of the SNARE complex from the N - terminal pull indicates that initiation of the assembly occurs in NTD ( 10 , 17 , 29 ) . We suggest a model for three - stage neuronal SNARE assembly through sequential zippering ofNTD , CTD , andLD ( fig . S13 ) . Overall , SNARE assembly outputs free energy of 65 ( T 6 ) k B T ( 14 ) . This energy is much higher than in previous re - ports ( 28 , 30 , 31 ) , but justified by our equilibrium measurements required for any thermodynamic quantifications ( 14 ) . These measurements lead to the energy landscape of SNARE zippering ( Fig . 4 ) . The CTD zippering energy is enriched at its C - terminal end or in VAMP2 ( 74 – 82 ) , lead - ing to a higher local force generation ( ~ 34 pN ) ( fig . S8 ) ( 30 ) . The half - zippered state appeared to exist only in the force range of 12 to 20 pN . Below this force range , the state collapsed into the four - helix bun - dle , consistent with its downhill folding at zero force . Thus , SNARE domain zippering became a two - state process limitedby the slowNTDassem - bly ( 10 , 28 ) . Above this range , the half - zippered state completely unzipped .

The elegant molecular logic of the SNARE complex thus revealed perfectly fits to precise regulation of neurotransmitter release ( 3 ) , with slow intrinsic assembly of NTD to allow control of vesicle priming by regulatory factors that ac - celerate NTD assembly , thereby creating the read - ily releasable pool of neurotransmitters ( 11 ) ; an intrinsic pause near the ionic layer stabilized by the repulsion between membranes being forced to fuse to enable clamping by complexin at this stage of zippering ( 17 ) ; and unobstructed , fast zippering of CTD and LD to open the fusion pore once the clamp is removed , enabling neurotrans - mitters to be rapidly released . The pore then ex - pands as the transmembrane domains of VAMP2 and syntaxin dimerize ( 32 ) . References and Notes 1 . T . Söllner et al . , Nature 362 , 318 ( 1993 ) . 2 . T .

Friesen 3 Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza A viruses has raised hopes for the development of monoclonal antibody – based immunotherapy and “ universal ” vaccines for influenza . However , a substantial part of the annual flu burden is caused by two cocirculating , antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses . Here , we report human monoclonal antibodies , CR8033 , CR8071 , and CR9114 , that protect mice against lethal challenge from both lineages . Antibodies CR8033 and CR8071 recognize distinct conserved epitopes in the head region of the influenza B hemagglutinin ( HA ) , whereas CR9114 binds a conserved epitope in the HA stem and protects against lethal challenge with influenza A and B viruses . These antibodies may inform on development of monoclonal antibody – based treatments and a universal flu vaccine for all influenza A and B viruses . I nfluenza viruses continue to cause substan - tial morbidity and mortality worldwide ( 1 ) . Because current vaccines are typically only effective against the specific viral strains used for vaccination and closely related viruses ( 2 ) and increasing resistance reduces the effective - ness of the available antiviral drugs ( 3 ) , an ur - gent need remains for innovative new treatments , both prophylactic and therapeutic ( 4 ) . To this end , we and others have previously described human monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) that neu - tralize a wide spectrum of influenza A viruses by binding to highly conserved epitopes in the stem region of hemagglutinin ( HA ) , the major viral surface glycoprotein ( 5 – 9 ) . To date , influenza B viruses have received less attention , because they are largely restricted to humans and thus lack the large animal reservoirs that are key to the emer - gence of pandemic influenza A viruses ( 10 ) . Although the morbidity and mortality rates attributable to influenza B are lower than those for H3N2 viruses , they are higher than those for H1N1 viruses ( 11 ) . Influenza B viruses are classified as a single influenza type , but two anti - genically and genetically distinct lineages cocir - culate ( 12 ) , represented by the prototype viruses B / Victoria / 2 / 1987 ( Victoria lineage ) and B / Yamagata / 16 / 1988 ( Yamagata lineage ) ( 13 ) . Vaccine manu - facturers have therefore recently initiated clin - ical evaluation of quadrivalent vaccines that include strains from each influenza B lineage , H1N1 , and H3N2 ( 14 ) . Given that influenza B viruses are the major cause of seasonal influenza epidemics every 2 to 4 years leading to substan - tial absenteeism , hospitalization , and death ( 11 ) , mAbs with broad neutralizing activity ( bnAbs ) against influenza B viruses have important clin - ical potential . Combinatorial display libraries , constructed from human B cells of volunteers recently vac - cinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine ( 9 ) , were panned by using soluble recombinant HA from various influenza A and B viruses , and phages were subsequently screened for binding to HAs 1 Department of Molecular Biology , The Scripps Research Insti - tute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 2 Department of Molecular Biology , Gustav Wieds Vej 10C , Aarhus 8000 , Denmark . 3 Crucell Vaccine Institute , Janssen Center of Excellence for Immunoprophylaxis , Archimedesweg 4 - 6 , 2301 CA Leiden , Netherlands . 4 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases and School of Public Health , Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine , The University of Hong Kong , 21 Sassoon Road , Pokfulam , Hong Kong , China . 5 Skaggs In - stitute for Chemical Biology , The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Present address : Department of Microbiology and Immunol - ogy , University of California — San Francisco , 600 16th Street , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . ‡ Present address : Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , De - partment of Bioenergy / GTL and Structural Biology , Berkeley , CA 94720 , USA . § To whom correspondence should be addressed .
