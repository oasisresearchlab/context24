They function in signalling , membrane regulation , and endocy - tosis . We found that the Eps - 15 homology domain - contain - ing protein 2 ( EHD2 , an ATPase ) associated with the static population of PM caveolae . Recruitment to the PM involved ATP binding , interaction with anionic lipids , and oligomerization into large complexes ( 60 – 75S ) via interaction of the EH domains with intrinsic NPF / KPF motifs . Hydrolysis of ATP was essential for binding of EHD2 complexes to caveolae . EHD2 was found to undergo dynamic exchange at caveolae , a process that depended on a functional ATPase cycle . Depletion of EHD2 by siRNA or expression of a dominant - negative mutant dramatically increased the fraction of mobile caveolar vesicles coming from the PM . Overexpression of EHD2 , in turn , caused conﬁnement of cholera toxin B in caveolae . The conﬁning role of EHD2 relied on its capacity to link caveolae to actin ﬁlaments . Thus , EHD2 likely plays a key role in adjusting the balance between PM functions of stationary caveolae and the role of caveolae as vesicular carriers .

Caveolins are integral membrane proteins stably asso - ciated with each other and cholesterol to form a protein - lipid scaffold that provides the organizing principle of caveolae ( Sargiacomo et al , 1995 ; Parton and Simons , 2007 ; Hayer et al , 2010a ) . Cavins form soluble complexes in the cytosol that bind to the caveolin scaffolds in the PM , and by providing an additional peripheral protein layer they stabilize caveolae and deﬁne their morphology ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Hansen et al , 2009 ; McMahon et al , 2009 ; Hansen and Nichols , 2010 ) . Most of the caveolae are immobile and serve as signalling platforms and membrane reservoirs in the PM ( Parton and Simons , 2007 ; Sinha et al , 2011 ) . Several studies have suggested that they are associated with actin microﬁlaments ( Rothberg et al , 1992 ; Stahlhut and van Deurs , 2000 ; Richter et al , 2008 ) . Interactions between components of the cytoskeleton and caveolae are likely to control dynamics of caveolae ( Stahlhut and van Deurs , 2000 ; Mundy et al , 2002 ; Foti et al , 2007 ; Sverdlov et al , 2009 ) . Caveolae can be activated through external or internal stimuli to undergo internalization and to carry cargo from the PM to early endosomes ( EEs ) ( Parton et al , 1994 ; Thomsen et al , 2002 ; Botos et al , 2008 ; Lajoie and Nabi , 2010 ) . The endocytic process requires dynamin , local actin rearrangements , and phosphorylation events ( Oh et al , 1998 ; Mundy et al , 2002 ; Pelkmans and Helenius , 2002 ; Pelkmans et al , 2005 ; Sverdlov et al , 2007 ) . It is not clear which cellular factors regulate the balance between static caveolae and motile caveolar carriers . In this paper , we focus on Eps - 15 homology domain - con - taining protein 2 ( EHD2 ) , an ATPase that binds to the PM . In a proteomics study , Aboulaich et al ( 2004 ) detected EHD2 as one of the numerous proteins present in preparations of caveolae isolated from human adipocytes . More recently , Hansen et al ( 2011 ) expressed EHD2 as a ﬂuorescent fusion protein in HeLa cells and found that it colocalized with CAV1 . While EHD2 is structurally well characterized , the cellular functions remain elusive . It belongs to a dynamin - related family of proteins of which the three others members ( EHD1 , 3 , and 4 ) are involved in the regulation of endocytic transport at the level of the endosomal recycling compartment ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . These three play a role in receptor sorting and recycling ( Blume et al , 2007 ; George et al , 2007 ; Sharma et al , 2008 ) . EHD2 shares its overall domain structure with the other EHDs ( Figure 1A ) , and has a central G domain , which binds and slowly hydrolyses ATP ( Lee et al , 2005 ; Daumke et al , 2007 ) . It associates with the PM , forms homooligomers instead of heterooligomers ( George et al , 2007 ) , and tubulates liposomes in vitro by forming oligomers around them ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) . The crystal structure of the EHD2 dimer shows the two G domains with ﬂanking helical domains organized into a compact scissor - shape structure with a curved surface as the site of interaction with lipids ( Figure 1A ; Daumke et al , 2007 ) . EH domains are located on top of the G domains . They are proposed to mediate homooligomerization by binding to intrinsic NPF motifs in adjacent EHD2 dimers ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) . We address the assembly and functions of EHD2 using biochemistry - and microscopy - based approaches . Our results show a progressive series of events that lead to the formation of EHD2 complexes , and the association of these complexes * Corresponding author .

The EHD2 plays an important role in regulating caveolar dynamics . Our data provide evidence that EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the PM by providing a link to actin ﬁlaments . Results EHD2 is associated with caveolae When ﬂuorescent EHD2 ( EHD2 – EGFP ) and caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 – mCherry ) were co - expressed in CV1 or HeLa cells , they colocalized within numerous small puncta in the PM ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Total - internal reﬂection ﬂuor - escent microscopy ( TIR - FM ) allowed us to determine that 95 % of CAV1 – mCherry - positive spots in the PM contained EHD2 – EGFP ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . Fluorescent ver - sions of cavin - 1 and cavin - 2 also colocalized with EHD2 – EGFP in spots , indicating that the spots were caveolae . The EHD2 signal did not overlap with puncta containing ﬂuor - escent clathrin light chain or ﬂotillin1 / 2 ( Supplementary Figure S1C and D ) . Moreover , using indirect immunoﬂuores - cence , we found that endogenous EHD2 was also enriched in cell surface spots positive for endogenous CAV1 and cavin - 1 in HeLa , 3T3L1 , and A549 cells ( Figure 1B ; Supplementary Figure S2A ) . For the endogenous EHD2 , we observed in Figure 1 EHD2 is associated with plasma membrane caveolae . ( A ) Scissor - shape structure of the EHD2 dimer .

EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2351 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 addition diffuse staining in the cytosol and nucleus showing that there was a pool of free EHD2 . In mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) devoid of CAV1 ( CAV1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) , ectopically expressed EHD2 was diffusely distributed in the cytosol and PM . Expression of CAV1 in such cells has been shown to drive caveolae formation ( Fra et al , 1995 ) . When CAV1 was expressed in the CAV (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs , we rescued the localization of EHD2 in PM spots ( Figure 1C ) . This indicated that the presence of CAV1 was sufﬁcient to induce efﬁcient accumulation of EHD2 in PM puncta . To visualize the distribution of EHD2 and CAV1 by electron microscopy ( EM ) , we immunogold labelled cryo - sections from CV1 cells expressing EHD2 – EGFP and CAV1 – HA with anti - GFP and anti - HA antibodies and 10 or 5 nm gold parti - cles , respectively . Invaginated caveolar structures in the PM were observed and many of them were positive for both CAV1 and EHD2 ( Figure 1D ) . Of the EHD2 gold particles in proxi - mity to CAV1 , 92 % were localized at invaginated caveolae and caveolar clusters . In contrast to CAV1 , gold - labelled EHD2 was not evenly distributed over the entire caveolar invagination but rather localized closer to the rim as quantiﬁed in Figure 1E . We concluded that EHD2 associated with the majority of caveolae in the PM . The association involved indented ca - veolae and caveolar clusters . When the cellular localization of the three other EHD family members was analysed by confocal microscopy , ﬂuorescent forms of EHD1 and EHD3 were not detected in caveolae but in vesicular and tubular structures . EHD4 , the closest homologue of EHD2 , was present in 10 % of CAV1 - positive spots ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . EHD2 molecules are in close proximity to CAV1 Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against CAV1 and cavin - 1 failed to bring down detectable amounts of EHD2 and vice versa , suggesting that EHD2 molecules did not interact strongly with these caveolar proteins ( not shown ) . To examine whether EHD2 was in close proximity to CAV1 , ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) was mea - sured . We analysed the effect of acceptor ( X - mCherry ) photo - bleaching on the ﬂuorescence intensity of donor ( Y - EGFP ) molecules in ﬁxed CV1 cells ( see Materials and methods ) . FRET efﬁciencies were quantiﬁed in individual PM puncta within bleached versus non - bleached regions of cells ( Figure 1F ) . The average FRET efﬁciency between EHD2 – EGFP and CAV1 – mCherry in puncta located in bleached regions was 16 % . This was signiﬁcantly higher than in non - bleached regions ( Figure 1F ) . No difference in FRET efﬁciencies of bleached versus non - bleached regions was detected when EHD2 – EGFP was co - expressed with ﬂotillin1 / 2 – mCherry or in our negative control ( EHD2 – EGFP , CAV1 – HA ) . In cells co - expressing CAV1 – EGFP and CAV1 – mCherry , the measured FRET efﬁciency was 48 % , i . e . , consistent with tightly knit CAV1 homooligomers ( Figure 1F ; Sargiacomo et al , 1995 ) . Thus , EHD2 and CAV1 molecules in caveolae were close to each other but probably not interacting directly . EHD2 regulates caveolar motility What could be the functional role of EHD2 associated with caveolae ? To address this question , we used RNA interference to deplete cellular EHD2 in HeLa cells . After depletion of over 90 % of EHD2 ( Figure 2A ) , CAV1 was still detectable in spots and the oligomeric state of CAV1 was not altered as determined by sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation ( Supplementary Figure S3A and B ) . Both assays had been used earlier to reveal the role of cavin - 1 in the maintenance of stable caveolar domains ( Hayer et al , 2010b ) . Thus , EHD2 did not seem to be required for caveolar formation and stability . Strikingly , when live cells stably expressing CAV1 – EGFP at low levels were imaged ( Supplementary Figure S3C ) , a dra - matic change in caveolar dynamics was observed after EHD2 depletion ( Supplementary Movie S1 ) . A signiﬁcantly greater number of CAV1 spots were now moving rapidly through the cytoplasm in all directions . To quantify the increase in motility , we bleached CAV1 – EGFP in a peripheral region of the cell and measured ﬂuorescence recovery over time by confocal microscopy ( see Materials and methods ; Supplementary Movies S2 and S3 ) . In cells transfected with non - targeting control siRNAs , recovery of signal in the bleached volume was slow in agreement with previous studies on caveolar motility ( Thomsen et al , 2002 ; Tagawa et al , 2005 ) . This indicated that in our stable cell line , CAV1 – EGFP spots represented assembled caveolae . After 12min , 34 % of the initial intensity had recovered ( Figure 2B ) . After depletion of EHD2 , we measured a signiﬁcantly increased recovery of 75 and 70 % of CAV1 – EGFP signal using two different siRNA oligonucleotides ( Figure 2B and C ; Supplementary Movie S3 ) . When EHD2 – mCherry was expressed in EHD2 - depleted cells , the original phenotype with mainly stationary caveolae could be rescued and CAV1 – EGFP recovered only to 27 % ( Figure 2C ) . Next , we studied the effect of EHD2 depletion on the motility of cavin - 1 , which binds to caveolar domains after these have arrived at the PM form the Golgi complex ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Hayer et al , 2010a ) . Cavin - 1 does not bind to unassembled CAV1 or to CAV1 in passage through the secretory pathway ( Hill et al , 2008 ) . However , cavin - 1 can be detected in mobile caveolar vesicles ( Boucrot et al , 2011 ) , and it follows CAV1 from the PM to EEs ( Hayer et al , 2010b ) . In a cell line stably expressing cavin - 1 – EGFP ( Supplementary Figure S3C ) , we detected signiﬁcantly more movement of cavin - 1 – EGFP vesicles after EHD2 silencing than in control cells treated with non - targeting siRNA ( Figure 2D ) . As the motility of both CAV1 and cavin - 1 was signiﬁcantly increased , we concluded that the mobile vesicles were most likely derived from the PM . Budding of caveolae from the PM requires dynamin ( Henley et al , 1998 ; Oh et al , 1998 ) . We expressed the dominant - negative dynamin - K44A mutant in cells treated with EHD2 siRNA . Strikingly , the extent of CAV1 movement was now signiﬁcantly decreased in comparison with control cells ( Figure 2E ) . This was consistent with the mobile caveo - lar vesicles being derived from the PM and with a role of EHD2 in restraining caveolae to the PM . EHD2 - positive caveolae conﬁne cholera toxin to the PM The uptake of cholera toxin ( CT ) into mammalian cells can be mediated by several endocytic mechanisms ( Kirkham et al , 2005 ; Chinnapen et al , 2007 ) . The role of caveolae has been intensively studied as they are enriched in the ganglisode GM1 , to which the B subunits of CT ( CT - B ) bind ( Parton , 1994 ; Chinnapen et al , 2007 ) . We investigated the EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2352 The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization effect of EHD2 on CT - B uptake in CV1 cells . After incubation of CV1 cells with a very low concentration of ﬂuorescently labelled CT - B for 30min followed by a 30 - min chase ( see Materials and methods ) , the majority of CT - B was found in giantin - positive Golgi structures ( Figure 3A ) . However when EHD2 was overexpressed , there was a signiﬁcant reduction of CT - B signal in the Golgi area ( Figure 3A and B ) . Now the PM contained many CT - B - positive spots that colocalized with EHD2 ( Figure 3C ) . In time - lapse movies , we found that the observed EHD2 - and CT - B - positive spots at the PM were static ( not shown ) . All the puncta were also positive for endogen - ous CAV1 showing that clustering of CT - B occurred in PM caveolae ( Figure 3D ) . The localization of CT - B in caveolae even after long in - cubation periods has been reported previously ( van Deurs et al , 2003 ) . To test whether EHD2 inﬂuenced trapping of CT - B by caveolae , we quantiﬁed the percentage of caveolae that colocalized with CT - B in cells overexpressing EHD2 and control cells . Strikingly , nearly 100 % of caveolae positive for both endogenous CAV1 and ﬂuorescent EHD2 contained CT - B ( Figure 3E ) . In control cells , only 50 % of caveolae were positive for CT - B . We concluded that elevated levels of EHD2 impaired proper trafﬁcking of CT - B to the Golgi apparatus by conﬁning CT - B to stationary caveolae at the PM . EHD2 is limited to stationary caveolae in the PM where it cycles on and off In TIR - FM time - lapse movies of CV1 cells expressing CAV1 – mCherry and EHD2 – EGFP , we could easily distinguish stationary and mobile CAV1 puncta . A merge of both chan - nels revealed nearly 100 % overlap of CAV1 – mCherry and EHD2 – EGFP signal in caveolae that did not move during the 4 - min movie ( Supplementary Movie S4 ) . In contrast , CAV1 spots that were mobile were not enriched in EHD2 ( Figure 4A ; Supplementary Movie S4 ) . That EHD2 was only detected in stationary caveolae raised the possibility that , unlike the cavins , EHD2 proteins were removed during or shortly after caveolae detachment from the PM . We have previously shown that caveolar domains are not only present in the PM but also associated with EEs where they contain cavin - 1 ( Pelkmans et al , 2004 ; Hayer et al , 2010b ) . When we transiently overexpressed CAV1 – HA to enhance CAV1 trafﬁcking to EE ( Hayer et al , 2010b ) , we could readily detect endogenous cavin - 1 in Rab5 - positive Figure 2 EHD2 regulates motility of caveolae . ( A ) HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA targeting EHD2 or non - targeting siRNA ( siRNA control ) and cell lysates were analysed after 72h by SDS – PAGE / western blot using the indicated antibodies . ( B ) Large regions in the cell periphery of HeLa cells , stably expressing CAV1 – EGFP , were bleached and the movement of CAV1 – EGFP back into the bleached region monitored through ﬂuorescence recovery .

EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2353 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 EE ( Supplementary Figure S3D ) . While EHD2 and CAV1 colocalized in PM spots , we did not observe endogenous EHD2 associated with endosomes ( Figure 4B ) . Thus unlike cavin proteins , EHD2 did not trafﬁc with caveolae to EE . To investigate the dynamics of EHD2 binding to PM caveolae , we used ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and compared recovery rates of bleached , EGFP - tagged EHD2 , cavin - 1 , cavin - 2 at static caveolae ( Figure 4C – E ) . Cavin - 1 and cavin - 2 recovered slowly ( o 20 % in 12min ) , and did not reappear in caveolar puncta . This showed that cavin - 1 and cavin - 2 in caveolae did not exchange with the free pool consistent with previous sugges - tions ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Hayer et al , 2010a ) . In contrast , EHD2 – EGFP recovered to 80 % of the initial signal intensity in the photobleached area during the 12 - min acquisition time ( Figure 4D and E ) . Caveolar EHD2 underwent dynamic exchange with a half - life of 2 – 4min . Since the EHD2 signal reappeared precisely in the initially bleached spots positive for CAV1 , the turnover occurred at stationary caveolae ( Figure 4E ) . We concluded that EHD2 – EGFP molecules associated with static caveolae underwent continuous cycles of association and dissociation . Multiple domains are required for targeting EHD2 to caveolae To gain insights into the mode of association with caveolae , we determined the cellular distribution of a panel of EHD2 mutants after expression in CV1 cells ( Figure 5A ) . EGFP fusions of the mutant proteins were transiently expressed in cells for 6 – 8 h and endogenous CAV1 was stained . Representative confocal microscopy images with the focus on the PM are shown in Figure 5B . A point mutation in the lipid - binding motif ( K327D ) was found to block association with caveolae ; the mutant protein localized to the cytosol and the nucleus .

EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2354 The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization ( D EH ) also abolished colocalization of EHD2 with CAV1 ; EHD2 was diffusely distributed over the PM . In previous in - vitro assays , three G domain mutants were shown to be defective or altered in their interactions with ATP : EHD2 - T72A was deﬁcient in ATP binding , EHD2 - T94A in ATPase activity , and EHD2 - I157Q exhibited a signiﬁcantly elevated ATP hydrolysis rate ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) . When expressed in CV1 cells , neither EHD2 - T72A nor EHD2 - T94A localized to caveolae . They had a diffuse cytosolic and / or membrane - associated distribution . EHD2 - I157Q , however , showed a striking punctate distribution colocalizing with endogenous CAV1 in the PM ( Figure 5B ) . After prolonged expression of all EHD2 mutant constructs ( 4 16h ) , we frequently observed the formation of ﬁlopodia in agreement with previous reports ( Guilherme et al , 2004 ) and found accumulation of EHD2 in the nucleus . While the EHD2 mutants that did not colocalize with caveolae did not affect CAV1 distribution in ﬁxed cells , we noticed that expression of EHD2 - I157Q or wild - type EHD2 for 4 16h altered the appearance of the immunostained CAV1 . The signal intensity of CAV1 per diffraction - limited caveolar spot was signiﬁcantly increased in the EHD2 overexpressing cells ( Supplementary Figure S4A – C ) .

Taken together , the results showed that several domains in EHD2 were required for targeting the protein to the PM and to caveolae ; the lipid - binding residues that allow association with negatively charged phospholipids ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) , the protein interaction and / or oligomerization domains , and the ATPase - containing G domain . A functional ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle was apparently essential for enrichment in caveolae . Association with caveolae requires EHD2 oligomerization Based on the topology of domains revealed by the crystal structure and in - vitro assays , it has been proposed that EHD2 Figure 5 Mutations in EHD2 impair association with caveolae and formation of large EHD2 complexes .

In both cell lysates , EHD2 was present in distinct oligomeric species sedimenting at 8S , 60S , and 75S ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) . 3T3 - L1 fractions were analysed with anti - EHD2 antibodies and HeLa fractions with anti - GFPantibodies . ( D ) EHD2 mutants were analysed for their ability to form protein complexes with sedimentation coefﬁcients 4 60S . EGFP fusions of mutant proteins were expressed for 6 – 12h in HeLa cells and lysates run through sucrose velocity gradients ( as in C ) . Fractions were analysed with anti - EHD2 antibodies . Bars present mean ± s . e . m . of relative EHD2 signal in fractions 9 – 12 ( ‘oligomeric EHD2’ ) from three independent experiments . EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2356 The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization dimers form oligomers when associated with membranes ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) . To analyse the oligomeric state of EHD2 proteins in cells , we prepared HeLa and 3T3L1 cell lysates with Triton X - 100 and subjected them to sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation ( Figure 5C ) . Western blot analysis of the 14 fractions showed that most endogenous and GFP - tagged EHD2 was present in a slowly sedimenting peak in fractions 2 – 4 . Since this corresponded to an MW of 66 – 200kDa ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) , the peak probably contained the EHD2 dimers ( MW of EHD2 : 61 kDa ) . In addition , two peaks containing about 30 % of total EHD2 were observed in fractions 9 – 12 . This corresponded to complexes with sedimentation coefﬁcients of 60 and 75S , which could mean that they have a molecular weight of about 2 . 5 and 3 . 5 MDa , respectively ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) . We have previously shown in similar gradients that CAV1 sediments as a large molecular weight complex of 70S ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) . To determine whether EHD2 was part of the same complexes , we analysed cell lysates prepared using octylglucoside ( OG ) , a non - ionic detergent that dissociates the CAV1 70S complex ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) . As expected , CAV1 was now exclusively in fractions 3 – 4 corresponding to CAV1 8S complexes . However , EHD2 still sedimented as large oligomers indicating that EHD2 oligomers were distinct from the 70S CAV1 complex ( Supplemenary Figure S5A ) . In addi - tion , the EHD2 complexes were observed in MEF CAV1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) showing that 60 – 75S EHD2 oligomers could form independently of caveolae . Next , we tested the EHD2 mutants for their ability to form high MW complexes . HeLa cells transiently expressing tagged mutant proteins for 6 – 12h were lysed and analysed on sucrose gradients . Mutations in the KPF / NPF motifs and deletion of the EH domain were found to most dramatically reduce oligomerization of EHD2 ( Figure 5D ; Supplementary Figure S5C ) , suggesting that the KPF / NPF motifs and EH domains were involved in 60 – 75S complex formation . This observation provided support for a model that involves the association of the EH domains of one dimer with KPF / NPF motifs of an adjacent dimer thus generating a linear or curved complex of EHD2 dimers as previously hypothesized ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) . A signiﬁcant loss of high MW complexes was also detected for the lipid - binding mutant K327D , indicating that association with membranes and especially negatively charged phospholipids was required for oligomerization . That the ATP - binding mutant ( T72A ) also was unable to form oligomers indicated a central function for the G domain ( Figure 5D ) . Strikingly , the two other ATP - cycle mutants ( EHD2 - T94A and EHD2 - I157Q ) permitted formation of high MW complexes to the same extent as the wild - type protein ( Figure 5D ; Supplementary Figure S5C ) . This indicated that while ATP binding was necessary for oligomerization , ATP hydrolysis was not . Interestingly , the mutants that were unable to oligomerize all failed to associate with caveolae suggesting that not only was membrane binding required for oligomerization , but also oligomer formation was a prerequi - site for caveolar association . In combination with the localization data , our results suggested that the EHD2 present in the cytosol is in the dimeric form ( Figure 1A ) . ATP binding allows the dimers to associate with lipids in the PM via the positively charged lipid - binding interface . Upon lipid binding , 60 – 75S EHD2 complexes are formed probably through interactions between the EH domains and the KPF / NPF sequence in an adjacent EHD2 dimer . As the ATP is hydrolysed , these complexes interact and accumulate at caveolae . Although caveolae are not needed for oligomerization , it is possible that oligomers in cells containing caveolae actually form in association with caveolae . The ATPase domain regulates EHD2 dynamics and function Further studies were performed with EHD2 - I157Q – EGFP , which has an accelerated ATPase activity ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) , to elucidate the role of EHD2’s G domain . The mutation in the P - loop of the G domain could either stabilize the catalytic conformation and prevent exchange of ADP to ATP ( Li and Zhang , 2004 ) , or impair the action of potential nucleotide exchange factors facilitating ADP to ATP exchange . FRAP experiments revealed that EHD2 - I157Q – EGFP failed to recycle after association with caveolae ( Figure 6A and B ) . This led us to express wild - type EHD2 – mCherry and EHD2 - I157Q – EGFP together . The EHD - I157Q – EGFP was now found trapped in caveolae with very little or no wild - type EHD2 present ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast to wild - type EHD2 , EHD2 - I157Q was thus unable to dissociate result - ing in the exclusion of wild - type EHD2 . While ATP was needed to dissociate EHD2 from caveolae , too rapid hydro - lysis evidently prevented displacement of EHD2 from caveo - lae . Consistent with a role for ATP in EHD2 dissociation from caveolae , we found that after depletion of cellular ATP with 2 - deoxyglucose and sodium azide for 40min , caveolae remained decorated with EHD2 – GFP ( Figure 6D ) . Strikingly , when EHD2 - I157Q was expressed in CAV1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , it showed a punctate distribution ( Figure 6E ) . This was in clear contrast to wild - type EHD2 that required the presence of caveolae to form similar puncta ( Figure 1C ) . When CAV1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells were transfected with EHD2 - I157Q and CAV1 together , the mutant EHD2 showed a punctate distribu - tion that now perfectly overlapped with CAV1 signal ( Supplementary Figure S5D ) . These experiments suggested that EHD2 puncta were assemblies of EHD2 complexes whose formation depended on ATP hydrolysis . In the case of wild - type EHD2 , it seemed likely that association with caveolae stimulated ATP hydrolysis and resulted in EHD2 enrichment at caveolae . In contrast , the I157Q mutant with intrinsically accelerated ATP - hydrolysis rate could form EHD2 puncta independently of caveolae . When EHD2 - T72A – mCherry , the EHD2 mutant incapable of binding ATP was overexpressed in HeLa cells stably expressing CAV1 – EGFP , we noticed that the amount of mo - bile caveolae was signiﬁcantly enhanced ( Figure 6F ) . The phenotype was comparable to the impact of EHD2 knock - down on CAV1 motility ( Figure 2B ) . The result supported the conclusion that EHD2 is involved in promoting mechanisms that render caveolae in the PM stationary . To test whether the mutant had a dominant - negative effect , we co - expressed EHD2 - T72A – mCherry and wild - type EHD2 – EGFP in CV1 cells . Indeed , we found that wild - type EHD2 no longer localized to caveolae ( Figure 6G ) indicating that the presence of EHD2 - T72A impaired wild - type EHD2 function . A possible explanation was that mixed or mutant EHD2 dimers could not form 60 – 75S complexes with mixed or mutant dimers , and were thus defective in PM association and oligomer formation . EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2357 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 In summary , our data on the G - domain mutants showed that ATP binding was required for PM association of EHD2 and for the formation of 60 – 75S complexes . The ATP was hydrolysed when the 60 – 75S complexes associated with caveolae . That the EHD2 - I157Q mutant protein with accelerated ATPase activity was unable to shuttle off caveolae was presumably because it could not hold ATP for long without hydrolysing it to ADP . Unlike wild - type EHD2 , it was able to form assemblies of several 60 – 75S complexes in the absence of caveolae suggesting that it did not require caveolae to activate ATP hydrolysis . Moreover , EHD2 - T72A , another mutant , acted as a dominant - negative mutant and caused increased caveolar motility . Figure 6 The ATPase domain regulates EHD2 dynamics and function .

( H ) A model on the role of oligomer formation and the ATP cycle in EHD2 association with caveolae and dynamic exchange . ( 1 ) Newly synthesized EHD2 dimers bind ATP and are subsequently targeted to the plasma membrane via ionic interactions with negatively charged lipids . ( 2 ) Upon lipid binding , EHD2 dimers assemble into 60 – 75S oligomers via interactions of EH domain and KPF / NPF motifs in adjacent EHD2 dimers . ( 3 ) Association of EHD2 complexes with caveolae requires ATP hydrolysis , which may be stimulated at caveolae . ( 4 ) EHD2 proteins undergo dynamic exchange at caveolae , which requires a new cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis . EHD2 mediates a link to actin ﬁbres that run in close proximity to caveolae . EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2358 The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization EHD2 oligomers link caveolae to the actin cortex In many cell types , caveolae tend to be aligned along actin ﬁlaments as shown for primary human ﬁbroblasts immunos - tained for endogenous CAV1 and EHD2 ( Figure 7A ) . When cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) was added to disrupt the actin ﬁla - ments , the stress ﬁbres rapidly disappeared and remaining F - actin accumulated in patches . The distribution of caveolae also changed ; CAV1 now clustered around the F - actin aggre - gates ( Figure 7B ) . TIR - FM time - lapse movies of HeLa cells expressing CAV1 – EGFP and EHD2 – mCherry allowed us to follow the impact of CytoD - induced actin ﬁlament disruption in live cells . They showed that after CytoD addition , the majority of CAV1 and EHD2 - containing puncta moved along linear trajectories for distances of several microns , and came to rest in clusters ( Supplementary Movie S5 ) . Movies made of cells expressing RFP – actin and CAV1 – EGFP conﬁrmed that the caveolae were dragged along with the retracting actin in the plane of the PM and that the clusters colocalized with F - actin remnants ( Figure 7C ; Supplementary Movie S6 ) . This indicated that the caveolae were tethered to ﬁlamentous actin . The distribution and behaviour of caveolae was dramati - cally altered when EHD2 was depleted by siRNA . Instead of localizing in linear arrays along microﬁlaments , the CAV1 - containing spots were now evenly distributed in human ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 7A ) . Addition of CytoD caused the Figure 7 EHD2 oligomers mediate a link of caveolae to F - actin .

EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2359 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 redistribution of actin in the same way as in control cells , but this failed to affect the distribution of CAV1 . CAV1 continued to be localized in discrete puncta randomly distributed over the PM ( Figure 7B ) . Consistently , actin ﬁlament disruption with CytoD had little effect on caveolar distribution in EHD2 siRNA - treated HeLa cells expressing RFP – actin and CAV1 – EGFP imaged by TIR - FM ( Figure 7C ; Supplementary Movie S7 ) . The movies showed that CAV1 spots remained motile as previously described ( Figure 2 ) . This indicated that the tethering of caveolae to microﬁlaments depended on EHD2 . To determine whether EHD2 was itself able to associate with F - actin and thus serve as a tether , we analysed MEF cells devoid of CAV1 . Experiments documented in Figure 1C had already shown that when expressed in CAV1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells wild - type EHD2 – EGFP did not form puncta nor did it align itself with stress ﬁbres . However , it was also clear as shown in Figure 6 that when the EHD2 mutant with accelerated ATPase activity ( EHD2 - I157Q – EGFP ) was expressed in the CAV1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , the protein did form puncta and that the majority of these puncta aligned themselves into linear arrays ( Figure 6E ) . After CytoD treatment , the linear arrays disap - peared and the EHD2 - I157Q spots retracted with F - actin and accumulated in actin patches similarly to those observed for CAV1 and wild - type EHD2 ( Figure 7D and E ; Supplementary Movie S8 ) . In contrast another mutant , the PM - associated mutant EHD2 - T94A – EGFP unable to hydrolyse ATP , showed a diffuse PM localization and was not affected by CytoD treatment ( Figure 7F ) . Taken together , this showed that EHD2 complexes can link up with F - actin without being associated with caveolae . However , for this to happen , the ATPase activity has to be accelerated suggesting that the EHD2 needs to be in the ADP - bound form . Discussion Our results showed that EHD2 constitutes a major component of invaginated caveolae and caveolar clusters . It is recruited from the cytosol to the PM , and present as large 60 – 75S complexes , the formation of which requires ATP binding and membrane association . The EHD2 complexes are responsible for tethering caveolae to actin ﬁlaments and preventing their lateral movement and the formation of caveolar vesicles . Unlike CAV1 and the cavins , which are stable components of caveolae , EHD2 undergoes a continuous turnover driven by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP . The majority of caveolae in the PM are static ( Thomsen et al , 2002 ; van Deurs et al , 2003 ; Kirkham et al , 2005 ; Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ; Tagawa et al , 2005 ) . Integrin expression , insulin activation , and the addition of phosphatase inhibitors , gangliosides or SV40 are known to activate caveolae and induce the generation of mobile , endocytic caveolar vesicles ( Parton et al , 1994 ; Pelkmans et al , 2002 ; Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ; Sharma et al , 2005 ; Parton and Simons , 2007 ; Botos et al , 2008 ; Lajoie and Nabi , 2010 ; Singh et al , 2010 ) . We found that depletion of EHD2 by RNAi and expression of a dominant - negative EHD2 mutant signiﬁcantly elevated the fraction of mobile caveolae without external stimuli . Since the caveolar vesicles formed contained cavin - 1 and their formation was dependent on dynamin , they were likely to be derived from the PM . Consistent with a constraining role , we found that when EHD2 was overexpressed the endocytic function of caveolae was suppressed . We followed CT - B a ligand known to be internalized via caveolae when added at low concentrations ( Parton , 1994 ; Pelkmans et al , 2004 ) . It accumulated in EHD2 - positive caveolae in the PM , and delivery to the Golgi complex was decreased . A similar reduction in Golgi - localized CT - B signal after overexpressing EHD2 was recently reported by Benjamin et al ( 2011 ) . In cells , EHD2 occurred in different oligomeric forms . The majority was present in a slowly sedimenting form that most likely corresponded to soluble homo - dimers ( Figure 1A ; Daumke et al , 2007 ) . This was the only form observed when lipid or ATP binding was compromised through point mutations in the respective domains . About 30 % of EHD2 sedimented as complexes of 60 and 75S with estimated molecular weights in the 2 . 5 – 3 . 5 MDa range . Since efﬁcient formation of these large complexes required a functional lipid - binding domain , they were probably membrane asso - ciated . Experiments with mutants indicated furthermore that the formation of these complexes required , in addition to lipid and ATP , a functional EH domain , and intact KPF / NPF motifs to which EH domains speciﬁcally bind . In - vitro experiments by Daumke et al ( 2007 ) have shown that in the presence of ATP and liposomes containing acidic phospholipids , isolated EHD2 oligomerizes to form circular , liposome - associated assemblies with about 20 dimers . These have a calculated molecular weight similarly to the estimated weight of the complexes that we observed in cell extracts . Daumke et al ( 2007 ) hypothesized that the EH domains of one dimer interact with the KPF / NPF motifs of neighbouring dimers resulting in the generation of a linear complex . Given the similarities in size and assembly requirements , it is likely that the 60 and / or 75S complexes observed in cells are equivalent to the complexes observed in vitro . In other words , the 60 and 75S complexes may represent linear or circular assemblies of EHD2 attached to the head groups of negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine in the inner leaﬂet of the PM . The architecture of caveolar domains is remarkably in that the major protein components all exist as large , oligomeric complexes . We have shown previously that CAV1 and the cavins are present as independent assemblies with sedimen - tation coefﬁcients in the 60 – 70S range ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) . Like the EHD2 , the cavins are peripheral membrane proteins recruited from the cytosol ( Bastiani et al , 2009 ; Hayer et al , 2010a ) . Both EHD2 and the cavins have afﬁnity for negatively charged phospholipids and the formation of complexes is independent of CAV1 ( Blume et al , 2007 ; Daumke et al , 2007 ; Hill et al , 2008 ; Bastiani et al , 2009 ; Hayer et al , 2010a ) . Their afﬁnity for caveolar domains may be explained by the postulated enrichment of phospatidylserine induced by CAV1 ( Pike et al , 2002 ; Wanaski et al , 2003 ) . Using mutants of EHD2 , we found that the formation of the 60 – 75S complexes was not sufﬁcient for association with caveolae . The ATPase activity was also needed . It remains to be determined whether the hydrolysis of ATP is required to induce interactions between 60 and 75S complexes or to promote association with other structures in caveolar do - mains . However , it was apparent that multiple 60 – 75S com - plexes were recruited to each caveolae because only after caveolar association was ﬂuorescent EHD2 detectable as deﬁned spots . It is interesting in this context that the I157Q mutant of EHD2 with accelerated ATPase activity was able to EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2360 The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization form spots of similar dimensions and ﬂuorescence intensity and to associate with actin ﬁlaments in the absence of caveolae . This could imply that association with the caveolar domain somehow increases the ATPase activity of wild - type EHD2 complexes and promotes mulitmerization and actin binding . In - vitro experiments have shown that the ATPase activity can be accelerated by addition of negatively charged lipids ( Daumke et al , 2007 ) . The existence of an interaction between the actin cytoske - leton and caveolae has been proposed in several morpholo - gical studies . These show microﬁlaments in close proximity to caveolae , and one of the studies identiﬁes crossbridges between caveolae and actin ﬁbres ( Rothberg et al , 1992 ; Richter et al , 2008 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is also known to affect caveolae at the functional level . On the one hand , it is thought that it controls internalization by conﬁning caveolae to the PM . On the other hand , actin is thought to promote efﬁcient caveolar internalization after stimulation ( Parton et al , 1994 ; Stahlhut and van Deurs , 2000 ; Mundy et al , 2002 ; Pelkmans et al , 2002 ; Sverdlov et al , 2009 ) . Our results were consistent with the existence of an intimate connection between stationary caveolae and the actin cytoskeleton . Using CytoD to collapse the microﬁlament network , we could show in live cells that the EHD2 - contain - ing caveolae moved together with the collapsing ﬁbres . EHD2 depletion resulted in a loss of this connection ; most of the caveolae now showed increased motility and failed to be dragged along by the collapsing microﬁlaments . EHD2 was probably itself part of the structure that formed the physical link between caveolae and actin ﬁlaments . This was suggested by an EHD2 mutant that possessed an elevated ATP hydrolysis rate . Unlike wild - type EHD2 , it formed actin - associated puncta even in the absence of caveolae . The attachment of EHD2 with caveolae was not permanent as observed for CAV1 and the cavins . FRAP experiments showed that the EHD2 was dynamically associated with caveolae and underwent turnover . The half - life was about 2 – 4 min , and the presence of ATP was required . Although relatively slow , this turnover is probably signiﬁcant because it may allow adjustment and ﬁne - tuning of caveolar dy - namics . Taken together , our results demonstrated that EHD2 is a critical factor in regulating the dynamic behaviour of caveo - lae and deﬁning their role in clathrin - independent endocyto - sis . A concomitant study conﬁrms the importance of EHD2 in constraining caveolae to the PM ( Moren et al , 2012 ) . The authors ﬁnd that EHD2 speciﬁcally associates with caveolae at the cell surface . Upon EHD2 depletion , they detect an increased amount of dynamin - dependent caveolar budding . We further showed that when EHD2 complexes associate with caveolae in the PM , they decrease caveolar motility , increase clustering , and suppress formation of caveolar vesicles by mediating an immobilizing link to the actin cortex . This conﬁnement regimen can evidently be reversed by external stimuli that allow endocytosis to occur . It is likely that in promoting the link , EHD2 interacts with other cellular proteins . Possible interaction partners are EHBP1 shown to bind EHD2 and colocalize with F - actin ( Guilherme et al , 2004 ) , the actin crosslinking protein ﬁlamin A described as a linker between caveolae and actin in caveolar anchorage and internalization ( Sverdlov et al , 2009 ; Muriel et al , 2011 ) , and other cytoskeletal proteins identiﬁed at the neck of caveolae ( Foti et al , 2007 ) . It is possible that EHD2 has other functions such as preventing the action of the membrane scission factor dynamin - 2 ( Jakobsson et al , 2011 ) . While EHD2 seems to be speciﬁcally responsible for caveolar conﬁnement , it remains unclear which factors regulate the release of EHD2 proteins from caveolae to allow caveolar scission and internalization .

Cells were permeabilized using 0 . 05 % saponin and 1 % BSA in PBS and incubated with the appropriate primary ( 1 : 500 ) and secondary ( 1 : 1000 ) antibodies , and coverslips were mounted on slides using Immu - Mount ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Imaging was per - formed on an inverted confocal microscope system ( LSM 510 Meta ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . Colocalization of CAV1 spots with proteins of EHD2 conﬁnes caveolae to the plasma membrane M Stoeber et al 2361 & 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 31 | NO 10 | 2012 interest was quantiﬁed in ImageJ . A thresholding was applied to the CAV1 channel . Coordinates of caveolar spots were extracted with the ‘analyse particles’ function and checked for colocalization with protein of interest . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching For FRAP experiments that quantiﬁed caveolar movement , either HeLa - CAV1 – mEGFP cells or HeLa - cavin - 1 – EGFP cells were treated with siRNA for 60 – 72h . On the day prior to acquisition , cells were plated on 18mm coverslips . For FRAP experiments that quantiﬁed recovery of cavins or EHD2 at stationary caveolae , EGFP - tagged cavins or EHD2 together with CAV1 – mCherry were expressed in CV1 cells for 14h . FRAP experiments were performed at 37 1 C on an inverted confocal microscope system ( LSM 510 Meta ) equipped with a temperature - controlled stage and a (cid:3) 100 1 . 4 NA objective with 2 (cid:3) zoom as described previously ( Tagawa et al , 2005 ) . A deﬁned region was bleached at 100 % laser transmission for 25 iterations using the 488 - nm line from a 30 - mWArgon laser and ﬂuorescence recovery was monitored by scanning a deﬁned region at low laser transmission ( 50 % power , 3 % transmission ) every 20s for 30 frames . Images were acquired as 12 - bit LSM ﬁles at 512 (cid:3) 512 pixels / frame and 0 . 14 m m / pixel lateral resolution . Image series with little or no apparent motion of cells were quantiﬁed with ImageJ . The mean ﬂuorescence intensity of the bleached region at each time point was corrected for background signal and photobleaching of the cell as in Tagawa et al ( 2005 ) . Fluorescence intensity before bleaching was normalized to 100 % and directly after bleaching to 0 % . For FRAP experiments of cavins and EHD2 at stationary caveolae , an image of CAV1 – mCherry was recorded before and after the image series to assure that anchored caveolae had not moved in the recorded time . Fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET efﬁciency was determined by performing acceptor photo - bleaching with subsequent measurement of donor dequenching with the ﬂuorophore pairs EGFP ( donor ) and mCherry ( acceptor ) . Cells in 8 - well Labtek chambers ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) were transi - ently transfected ( Lipofectamine 2000 ) with ﬂuorescent fusion proteins and expression allowed for 14h . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % methanol - free formaldehyde ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and subse - quently imaged in PBS . FRET analysis was performed using a Leica SP2 - FCS microscope . EGFP was excited with 20 % 488nm laser intensity and emission was detected at 505 – 550nm . mCherry was excited with 20 % 561nm laser intensity and emission detected at 610 – 685nm . Images were taken with (cid:3) 63 1 . 4 NA DIC , Oil , HCX Plan - Apo objective , 3 (cid:3) zoom and a pinhole of one airy unit with focus on the PM . Bleaching was performed with 100 % 561nm intensity and 20 iterations . Images were analysed using the Leica LCS Imaging software . To determine FRET efﬁciency , donor ﬂuorescence intensity before ( D pre ) and after ( D post ) photo - bleaching was measured in membrane spots ( ¼ region of interest ( ROI ) ) within the bleached and non - bleached region for each cell and the background subtracted . FRET efﬁciency was calculated for every ROI of the imaged cell according to the formula : ( D post (cid:2) D pre ) / D post (cid:3) 100 . For statistical analysis , the mean FRET efﬁciency in ROIs within bleached and non - bleached regions was determined for every cell and signiﬁcance between means analysed with a two - tailed paired t - test . CT - B uptake CV1 cells were transfected with EHD2 – mCherry using AMAXA , seeded onto glass coverslips and expression allowed for 14h . Cells were incubated at 37 1 C with 50ng / ml Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled CT - B ( Molecular Probes ) . After 30min , cells were washed 3 (cid:3) followed by a 30 - min chase at 37 1 C , washed and ﬁxed for 20min in 4 % FA in PBS . Subsequently , cells were stained for Giantin or CAV1 and imaged with confocal microscopy . For quantiﬁcation of CT - B signal in the Golgi region , a custom - made ImageJ based software was used to deﬁne the Golgi region , to measure the mean intensity of CT - B - 488 signal in these areas and to subsequently score cells for being EHD2 - mCherry positive or negative in each image . Localization of CT - B in caveolar spots after the 30 - min chase was analysed with ImageJ using thresh - olding and particle analysis to obtain coordinates of CAV1 or CAV1 þ EHD2 - mCherry - positive puncta that were subsequently checked for colocalization with CT - B - 488 . Live - cell ﬂuorescence imaging CV1 cells expressing ﬂuorescently tagged constructs and seeded onto 18mm coverslips were transferred to a custom - built metal microscope coverslip chamber in CO 2 - independent medium ( Invitrogen ) , supplemented with 10 % FCS . A Leica AM TIRF system was used , equipped with a (cid:3) 100 1 . 47 NA objective , an Andor iXon EM - CCD camera and a temperature - controlled stage . The depth of the evanescent ﬁeld was adjusted to the indicated penetration depth . EGFP and mCherry channels were acquired sequentially . Image sequences were analysed by ImageJ . Immuno - EM EHD2 – EGFP and CAV1 – HA were expressed in CV1 cells for 6h . Cells were ﬁxed in 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 1 (cid:3) PHEM buffer for 90min ( Schliwa et al , 1981 ) . Cryo - sectioning and immunolabelling were performed as described elsewhere ( Tokuyasu , 1973 ) . In brief , ultrathin sections ( 50 – 70nm ) from gelatin - embedded and frozen cell pellets were obtained using an FC7 / UC7 - ultramicrotome ( Leica , Vienna , Austria ) . Immunogold labelling was carried out on thawed sections with anti - GFP ( Rockland , 600 - 101 - 215 ) and anti - HA ( Covance , HA - 11 ) antibodies and 10 or 5nm protein A - gold ( UMC Utrecht University , Utrecht , Netherlands ) ( 1 : 50 ) . Sections were examined with a CM10 Philips transmission electron microscope with an Olympus ‘Veleta’ 2kx2k side - mounted TEM CCD camera . For colocalization analysis , the cryo - sections were followed in a meandering pattern . Screening along the PM , visible colocalization events of 5 and 10nm gold particles were counted and scored as caveolae or non - caveolae structure based on invaginated morphology in four independent scans , each counting 4 200 gold particles . To determine the distance of EHD2 and CAV1 gold particles from the PM , perpendicular measurements towards the PM were performed from 10 or 5nm gold particles within a maximal distance of 300nm from the membrane . Velocity gradient centrifugation Sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation was performed as described previously ( Hayer et al , 2010a ) . Cells were lysed for 20min at room temperature in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( TX100 ) or ( if speciﬁcally indicated ) in 60mM OG in TNE ( 20mM Tris – HCl , HpH 7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl , and 5mM EDTA ) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Postnuclear supernatants were loaded onto 10 – 40 % linear sucrose gradients prepared in 0 . 15 % TX100 / TNE or 35mM OG / TNE and spun in a rotor ( SW55Ti ; Beckman Coulter ) at 50000r . p . m . ( 237020 g ) at 4 1 C for 255min . Gradient fractions were analysed by SDS – PAGE / western blotting .
