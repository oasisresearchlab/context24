We show that these two fea - tures are the consequence of a hierarchical organization , implying that small groups of nodes organize in a hierar - chical manner into increasingly large groups , while main - taining a scale - free topology . In hierarchical networks the degree of clustering characterizing the diﬀerent groups follows a strict scaling law , which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real net - works . We ﬁnd that several real networks , such as the World Wide Web , actor network , the Internet at the do - main level and the semantic web obey this scaling law , indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems . 2 In the last few years an array of discoveries have redeﬁned our under - standing of complex networks ( for reviews see [ 1 , 2 ] ) . The availability of detailed maps , capturing the topology of such diverse systems as the cell [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] , the world wide web [ 6 ] , or the sexual network [ 7 ] , have oﬀered scientists for the ﬁrst time the chance to address in quantitative terms the generic features of real networks . As a result , we learned that networks are far from being random , but are governed by strict organizing principles , that generate systematic and measurable deviations from the topology predicted by the random graph theory of Erd˝os and R´enyi [ 8 , 9 ] , the basic model used to describe complex webs in the past four decades . Two properties of real networks have generated considerable attention . First , measurements indicate that most networks display a high degree of clustering . Deﬁning the clustering coeﬃcient for node i with k i links as C i = 2 n i / k i ( k i − 1 ) , where n i is the number of links between the k i neighbors of i , empirical results indicate that C i averaged over all nodes is signiﬁcantly higher for most real networks than for a random network of similar size [ 10 ] . Furthermore , the clustering coeﬃcient of real networks is to a high degree independent of the number of nodes in the network ( see Fig . 9 in [ 1 ] ) . At the same time , many networks of scientiﬁc or technological interest have been found to be scale - free [ 11 , 12 ] , which means that the probability that a randomly selected node has k links ( i . e . degree k ) follows P ( k ) ∼ k − γ , where γ is the degree exponent . The scale - free property and clustering are not exclusive : for a large num - ber of real networks , including metabolic networks [ 3 , 4 ] , the protein inter - action network [ 5 , 13 ] , the world wide web [ 6 ] and even some social networks [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] the scale - free topology and high clustering coexist . Yet , most models proposed to describe the topology of complex networks have diﬃ - culty capturing simultaneously these two features . For example , the random network model [ 8 , 9 ] cannot account neither for the scale - free , nor for the clustered nature of real networks , as it predicts an exponential degree dis - tribution , and the average clustering coeﬃcient , C ( N ) , decreases as N − 1 with the number of nodes in the network . Scale - free networks , capturing the power law degree distribution predict a much larger clustering coeﬃcient than a random network . Indeed , numerical simulations indicate that for one of the simplest models [ 11 , 12 ] the average clustering coeﬃcient depends on 3 the system size as C ( N ) ∼ N − 0 . 75 [ 1 , 2 ] , signiﬁcantly larger for large N than the random network prediction C ( N ) ∼ N − 1 . Yet , this prediction still dis - agrees with the ﬁnding that for many real systems C is independent of N [ 1 ] . Here we show that the fundamental discrepancy between models and empirical measurements is rooted in a previously disregarded , yet generic feature of many real networks : their hierarchical topology . Indeed , many networks are fundamentally modular : one can easily identify groups of nodes that are highly interconnected with each other , but have only a few or no links to nodes outside of the group to which they belong to . In society such modules represent groups of friends or coworkers [ 17 ] ; in the WWW denote communities with shared interests [ 18 , 19 ] ; in the actor network they characterize speciﬁc genres or simply individual movies . Some groups are small and tightly linked , others are larger and somewhat less interconnected . This clearly identiﬁable modular organization is at the origin of the high clustering coeﬃcient seen in many real networks . Yet , models reproducing the scale - free property of real networks [ 1 , 2 ] distinguish nodes based only on their degree , and are blind to node characteristics that could lead to a modular topology . In order to bring modularity , the high degree of clustering and the scale - free topology under a single roof , we need to assume that modules combine into each other in a hierarchical manner , generating what we call a hierarchi - cal network . The presence of a hierarchy and the scale - free property impose strict restrictions on the number and the degree of cohesiveness of the dif - ferent groups present in a network , which can be captured in a quantitative manner using a scaling law , describing the dependence of the clustering coef - ﬁcient on the node degree . We use this scaling law to identify the presence of a hierarchical architecture in several real networks , and the absence of such hierarchy in geographically organized webs . Hierarchical Network Model We start by constructing a hierarchical network model , that combines the scale - free property with a high degree of clustering . Our starting point is a small cluster of ﬁve densely linked nodes ( Fig . 1a ) . Next we generate four replicas of this hypothetical module and connect the four external nodes of the replicated clusters to the central node of the old cluster , obtaining a large 25 - node module ( Fig . 1b ) . Subsequently , we again generate four replicas of this 25 - node module , and connect the 16 peripheral nodes to the central 4 node of the old module ( Fig . 1c ) , obtaining a new module of 125 nodes . These replication and connection steps can be repeated indeﬁnitely , in each step increasing the number of nodes in the system by a factor ﬁve . ( a ) n = 0 , N = 5 ( b ) n = 1 , N = 25 ( c ) n = 2 , N = 125 Figure 1 : The iterative construction leading to a hierarchical network . Starting from a fully connected cluster of ﬁve nodes shown in ( a ) ( note that the diagonal nodes are also connected – links not visible ) , we create four identical replicas , connecting the peripheral nodes of each cluster to the central node of the original cluster , obtaining a network of N = 25 nodes ( b ) . In the next step we create four replicas of the obtained cluster , and connect the peripheral nodes again , as shown in ( c ) , to the central node of the original module , obtaining a N = 125 node network . This process can be continued indeﬁnitely . A precursor to the model described in Fig . 1 has been proposed in Ref . [ 20 ] and Ref . [ 21 ] as a method of generating deterministic scale - free networks . Yet , it was believed that aside from their deterministic structure , their statis - tical properties are equivalent with the stochastic models that are often used to generate scale - free networks . In the following we argue that such hier - archical construction generates an architecture that is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the networks generated by traditional scale - free models . Most impor - tant , we show that the new feature of the model , its hierarchical character , 5 are shared by a signiﬁcant number of real networks . First we note that the hierarchical network model seamlessly integrates a scale - free topology with an inherent modular structure . Indeed , the gen - erated network has a power law degree distribution with degree exponent γ = 1 + ln 5 / ln 4 = 2 . 161 ( Fig . 2a ) . Furthermore , numerical simulations in - dicate that the clustering coeﬃcient , C ≃ 0 . 743 , is independent of the size of the network ( Fig . 2c ) . Therefore , the high degree of clustering and the scale - free property are simultaneously present in this network . The most important feature of the network model of Fig . 1 , not shared by either the scale - free [ 11 , 12 ] or random network models [ 8 , 9 ] , is its hierarchi - cal architecture . The network is made of numerous small , highly integrated ﬁve node modules ( Fig . 1a ) , which are assembled into larger 25 - node mod - ules ( Fig . 1b ) . These 25 - node modules are less integrated but each of them is clearly separated from the other 25 - node modules when we combine them into the even larger 125 - node modules ( Fig . 1c ) . These 125 - node modules are even less cohesive , but again will appear separable from their replicas if the network expands further . This intrinsic hierarchy can be characterized in a quantitative manner using the recent observation of Dorogovtsev , Goltsev and Mendes [ 21 ] that in deterministic scale - free networks the clustering coeﬃcient of a node with k links follows the scaling law C ( k ) ∼ k − 1 . ( 1 ) We argue that this scaling law quantiﬁes the coexistence of a hierarchy of nodes with diﬀerent degrees of clustering , and applies to the model of Fig . 1a - c as well . Indeed , the nodes at the center of the numerous 5 - node modules have a clustering coeﬃcient C = 1 . Those at the center of a 25 - node module have k = 20 and C = 3 / 19 , while those at the center of the 125 - node modules have k = 84 and C = 3 / 83 , indicating that the higher a node’s degree the smaller is its clustering coeﬃcient , asymptotically following the 1 / k law ( Fig . 2b ) . In contrast , for the scale - free model proposed in Ref . [ 11 ] the clustering coeﬃcient is independent of k , i . e . the scaling law ( 1 ) does not apply ( Fig . 2b ) . The same is true for the random [ 8 , 9 ] or the various small world models [ 10 , 22 ] , for which the clustering coeﬃcient is independent of the nodes’ degree . Therefore , the discrete model of Fig . 1 combines within a single framework the two key properties of real networks : their scale - free topology and high 6 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 k 10 - 8 10 - 7 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 P ( k ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 k 10 - 8 10 - 7 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 P ( k ) ( a ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 k 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 C ( k ) ( b ) 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 N 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 C ( N ) ( c ) Figure 2 : Scaling properties of the hierarchical model shown in Fig . 1 ( N = 5 7 ) .

The open circles show C ( k ) for a scale - free model [ 11 ] of the same size , illustrating that it does not have a hierarchical architecture .

While for the hierarchical model C is independent of N ( (cid:7) ) , for the scale - free model C ( N ) decreases rapidly ( (cid:13) ) . modularity , which results in a system - size independent clustering coeﬃcient . Yet , the hierarchical modularity of the model results in the scaling law ( 1 ) , which is not shared by the traditional network models . The question is , could hierarchical modularity , as captured by this model , characterize real networks as well ? Hierarchical Organization in Real Networks To investigate if such hierarchical organization is present in real networks we measured the C ( k ) function for several networks for which large topolog - ical maps are available . Next we discuss each of these systems separately . Actor Network : Starting from the www . IMDB . com database , we connect any two actors in Hollywood if they acted in the same movie , obtaining a network of 392 , 340 nodes and 15 , 345 , 957 links . Earlier studies indicate that this network is scale - free with an exponential cutoﬀ in P ( k ) for high k [ 11 , 23 , 24 ] . As Fig . 3a indicates , we ﬁnd that C ( k ) scales as k − 1 , indicating that the network has a hierarchical topology . Indeed , the majority of actors with a few links ( small k ) appear only in one movie . Each such actor has a clustering coeﬃcient equal to one , as all actors the actor has links to are part of the same cast , and are therefore connected to each other . The high k nodes include many actors that acted in several movies , and thus their neighbors 7 are not necessarily linked to each other , resulting in a smaller C ( k ) . At high k the C ( k ) curve splits into two branches , one of which continues to follow Eq . ( 1 ) , while the other saturates . One explanation of this split is the decreasing amount of datapoints available in this region . Indeed , in the high k region the number of nodes having the same k is rather small . If one of these nodes corresponds to an actor that played only in a few movies with hundreds in the cast , it will have both high k and high C , considerably increasing the average value of C ( k ) . The k values for which such a high C nodes are absent continue to follow the k − 1 curve , resulting in jumps between the high and small C values for large k . For small k these anomalies are averaged out . Language network : Recently a series of empirical results have shown that the language , viewed as a network of words , has a scale - free topology [ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] . Here we study the network generated connecting two words to each other if they appear as synonyms in the Merriam Webster dictionary [ 26 ] . The obtained semantic web has 182 , 853 nodes and 317 , 658 links and it is scale - free with degree exponent γ = 3 . 25 . The C ( k ) curve for this language network is shown in Fig . 3b , indicating that it follows ( 1 ) , suggesting that the language has a hierarchical organization . World Wide Web : On the WWW two documents are connected to each other if there is an URL pointing from one document to the other one . The sample we study , obtained by mapping out the www . nd . edu domain [ 6 ] , has 325 , 729 nodes and 1 , 497 , 135 links , and it is scale - free with degree exponents γ out = 2 . 45 and γ in = 2 . 1 , characterising the out and in - degree distribution , respectively . To measure the C ( k ) curve we made the network undirected . While the obtained C ( k ) , shown in Fig . 3c , does not follow as closely the scaling law ( 1 ) as observed in the previous two examples , there is clear ev - idence that C ( k ) decreases rapidly with k , supporting the coexistence of many highly interconnected small nodes with a few larger nodes , which have a much lower clustering coeﬃcient . Indeed , the Web is full of groups of documents that all link to each other . For example , www . nd . edu / ∼ networks , our network research dedicated site , has a high clustering coeﬃcient , as the documents it links to have links to each other . The site is one of the several network - oriented sites , some of which point to each other . Therefore , the network research community still forms a relatively cohesive group , albeit less interconnected than the www . nd . edu / ∼ networks site , thus having a smaller C . This network com - munity is nested into the much larger community of documents devoted to statistical mechanics , that has an even smaller clustering coeﬃcient . There - 8 fore , the k - dependent C ( k ) reﬂects the hierarchical nesting of the diﬀerent interest groups present on the Web . Note that C ( k ) ∼ k − 1 for the WWW was observed and brieﬂy noted in Ref . [ 29 ] . Internet at the AS level : The Internet is often studied at two diﬀerent lev - els of resolution . At the router level we have a network of routers connected by various physical communication links . At the interdomain or autonomous system ( AS ) level each administrative domain , composed of potentially hun - dreds of routers , is represented by a single node . Two domains are connected if there is at least one router that connects them . Both the router and the domain level topology have been found to be scale - free [ 30 ] . As Fig . 3d shows we ﬁnd that at the domain level the Internet , consisting of 65 , 520 nodes and 24 , 412 links [ 31 ] , has a hierarchical topology as C ( k ) is well approximated with ( 1 ) . Our measurements indicate , however , that some real networks lack a hi - erarchical architecture , and do not obey the scaling law ( 1 ) . In particular , we ﬁnd that the power grid and the router level Internet topology have a k independent C ( k ) . Internet at the router level : The router level Internet has 260 , 657 nodes connected by 1 , 338 , 100 links [ 32 ] . Measurements indicate that the network is scale - free [ 30 , 33 ] with degree exponent γ = 2 . 23 . Yet , the C ( k ) curve ( Fig . 4a ) , apart from some ﬂuctuations , is largely independent of k , in strong contrast with the C ( k ) observed for the Internet’s domain level topology ( Fig . 3d ) . Power Grid : The nodes of the power grid are generators , transformers and substations and the links are high voltage transmission lines . The network studied by us represents the map of the Western United States , and has 4 , 941 nodes and 13 , 188 links [ 10 ] . The results again indicate that apart from ﬂuctuations , C ( k ) is independent of k . It is quite remarkable that these two networks share a common feature : a geographic organization . The routers of the Internet and the nodes of the power grid have a well deﬁned spatial location , and the link between them represent physical links . In contrast , for the examples discussed in Fig . 3 the physical location of the nodes was either undeﬁned or irrelevant , and the length of the link was not of major importance . For the router level Internet and the power grid the further are two nodes from each other , the more expensive it is to connect them [ 33 ] . Therefore , in both systems the links are driven by cost considerations , generating a distance driven structure , apparently excluding the emergence of a hierarchical topology . In contrast , 9 the domain level Internet is less distance driven , as many domains , such as the AT & T domain , span the whole United States . In summary , we oﬀered evidence that for four large networks C ( k ) is well approximated by C ( k ) ∼ k − 1 , in contrast to the k - independent C ( k ) predicted by both the scale - free and random networks . This indicates that these networks have an inherently hierarchical organization . In contrast , hierarchy is absent in networks with strong geographical constraints , as the limitation on the link length strongly constraints the network topology . Stochastic Model and Universality The hierarchical model described in Fig . 1 predicts C ( k ) ∼ k − 1 , which oﬀers a rather good ﬁt to three of the four C ( k ) curves shown in Fig . 3 . The question is , is this scaling law ( 1 ) universal , valid for all hierarchical networks , or could diﬀerent scaling exponent characterize the scaling of C ( k ) ? Deﬁning the hierarchical exponent , β , as C ( k ) ∼ k − β , ( 2 ) is β = 1 a universal exponent , or it’s value can be changed together with γ ? In the following we demonstrate that the hierarchical exponent β can be tuned as we tune some of the network parameters . For this we propose a stochastic version of the model described in Fig . 1 . We start again with a small core of ﬁve nodes all connected to each other ( Fig . 1a ) and in step one ( n = 1 ) we make four copies of the ﬁve node module . Next , we randomly pick a p fraction of the newly added nodes and connect each of them independently to the nodes belonging to the central module . We use preferential attachment [ 11 , 12 ] to decide to which central node the selected nodes link to . That is , we assume that the probability that a selected node will connect to a node i of the central module is k i / P j k j , where k i is the degree of node i and the sum goes over all nodes of the central module . In the second step ( n = 2 ) we again create four identical copies of the 25 - node structure obtained thus far , but we connect only a p 2 fraction of the newly added nodes to the central module . Subsequently , in each iteration n the central module of size 5 n is replicated four times , and in each new module a p n fraction will connect to the current central module , requiring the addition of ( 5 p ) n new links . As Fig . 5 shows , changing p alters the slope of both P ( k ) and C ( k ) on a log - log plot . In general , we ﬁnd that increasing p decreases the exponents 10 γ and β ( Fig . 5b , d ) . The exponent β = 1 is recovered for p = 1 , i . e . when all nodes of a module gain a link . While the number of links added to the network changes at each iteration , for any p ≤ 1 the average degree of the inﬁnitely large network is ﬁnite . Indeed , the average degree follows h k i n = 8 5 (cid:18) 3 2 + 1 − p n + 1 1 − p (cid:19) , ( 3 ) which is ﬁnite for any p ≤ 1 . Interestingly , the scaling of C ( k ) is not a unique property of the model dis - cussed above . A version of the model , where we keep the fraction of selected nodes , p , constant from iteration to iteration , also generates p dependent β and γ exponents . Furthermore , recently Klemm and Eguiluz proposed a stochastic model that , while follows diﬀerent evolutionary rule than the model described above , it generates a network that obeys the scaling law ( 1 ) [ 34 ] . In their model in each time step a new node joins the network , con - necting to all active nodes in the system . At the same time an active node is deactivated with probability p ∼ k − 1 . The insights oﬀered by the hierar - chical model can help understand the origin of the C ( k ) ∼ k − 1 observed for this model . By deactivating the less connected nodes a central core emerges to which all subsequent nodes tend to link to . New nodes have a large C and small k , thus they are rapidly deactivated , freezing into a large C state . The older , more connected , surviving nodes are in contact with a large number of nodes that have already disappeared from the active list , and they have small C . These models indicate that several microscopic mechanisms could generate a hierarchical topology , just as several models are able to create a scale - free network [ 1 , 2 ] . Yet , all models generating a scale - free topology appear to share growth and preferential attachment as common features . In the same way , models following ( 1 ) appear to develop a highly connected core , to which new modules attach to in a hierarchical manner . Discussion and Outlook The identiﬁed hierarchical architecture oﬀers a new perspective on the topology of complex networks . Indeed , the fact that many large networks are scale - free is now well established . It is also clear that most networks have a modular topology , quantiﬁed by the high clustering coeﬃcient they display . Such modules have been proposed to be a fundamental feature of biological systems [ 35 ] , but have been discussed in the context of the WWW [ 36 , 18 ] , and social networks as well [ 17 , 37 ] . The hierarchical topology oﬀers a new 11 avenue for bringing under a single roof these two concepts , giving a precise and quantitative meaning for the network’s modularity . It indicates that we should not think of modularity as the coexistence of relatively independent groups of nodes . Instead , we have many small clusters , that are densely in - terconnected . These combine to form larger , but less cohesive groups , which combine again to form even larger and even less interconnected clusters . This self - similar nesting of diﬀerent groups or modules into each other forces a strict ﬁne structure on real networks . Most interesting is , however , the fact that the hierarchical nature of these networks is well captured by a simple quantity , the C ( k ) curve , oﬀering us a relatively straightforward method to identify the presence of hierarchy in real networks . The law ( 1 ) indicates that the number and the size of the groups of diﬀerent cohesiveness is not random , but follow rather strict scaling laws . The presence of such a hierarchical architecture reinterprets the role of the hubs in complex networks . Hubs , the highly connected nodes at the tail of the power law degree distribution , are known to play a key role in keeping complex networks together , playing a crucial role from the robustness of the network [ 38 , 39 ] to the spread of viruses in scale - free networks [ 40 ] . Our measurements indicate that the clustering coeﬃcient characterizing the hubs decreases linearly with the degree . This implies that while the small nodes are part of highly cohesive , densely interlinked clusters , the hubs are not , as their neighbors have a small chance of linking to each other . Therefore , the hubs play the important role of bridging the many small communities or clusters into a single , integrated network . Acknowledgements We beneﬁted from useful discussions with J .
