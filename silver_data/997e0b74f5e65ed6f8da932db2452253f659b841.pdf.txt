At the same time , it has been observed that people utilize social media platforms like Facebook , Twitter , etc . to post offensive and hateful content . This happens on a large scale which makes it extremely challenging to monitor them manually , paving way for automation in hate speech . This survey paper explores , summarises , and compares various methods that target hate speech detection , how they are being utilized at solving past challenges , and dive into the current and future prospects for hate speech detection . Index Terms —Hate speech review , Machine learning classiﬁer , Deep Learning text classiﬁcation I . I NTRODUCTION Hate speech has been formally labelled as any sort of aggressive , abusive , or threatening expressions aimed and driven against a particular individual or group of people based on some sort of discriminating factors like sex , religion , color , nationality , etc . ( Oxford dictionary ) . Some examples of statements or speech that are hateful can be : • “He’s a beaner smh you can tell he’s a Mexican” • “Stay beautiful you bitch” • “He is a snake and a coward , but at least he isn’t a cripple like your hero Roach lmaooo” • “walks up to the teacher with the test , drops test in that bitch fohead” Such content has recently seen a massive rise due to the increase in presence of people on social media , where they can anonymously post whatever content , emotions , or thoughts they have for anyone and everyone . Simultaneously it has been difﬁcult to keep a check on it manually due to the currently enormous size of such data generated . This called for the need for automation in hate speech detection to keep things under check and prevent it from escalating . Over the past years , researchers have focused on various techniques for automatic hate speech detection . All these essentially require some sort of ﬁltering or segregation to incorporate context since basic words do not tell the complete story , thereby utilizing natural language processing and at the same time dealing with a number of features and classiﬁers . The survey paper provides a systematic and short structured content of automatic hate speech detection . The paper is struc - tured as follows - Section 2 reviews evolution and past works by researchers towards hate speech detection . Generic pipeline and different datasets around hate speech are discussed in sections 3 and 4 respectively . Section 5 mentions features and Section 6 reviews classiﬁers and models for the task . Section 7 explores hate speech identiﬁcation in non - English languages and ﬁnally sections 8 and 9 present some results and conclude the survey . II . E VOLUTION O F H ATE S PEECH D ETECTION T ECHNIQUES The task of detecting hate content has been carried out based on different ideas throughout the past decade which are : • Simple lexicon , word , keyword - based classiﬁcation • Distributed semantics - based classiﬁcation in NLP • Deep learning - based classiﬁcation The early works primarily focused on simple lexicons and keyword - based studies . Spertus et al . [ 9 ] dealt with hate , abusive , and hostile ( ﬂame ) speech by building feature vectors from the semantics of the sentence data and using the C4 . 5 decision tree as the classiﬁer . Sood et al . [ 10 ] among many researchers used a list of words to identify offensive and hate content . Warner et al . and Hirschberg et al . [ 11 ] gave their own deﬁnition and mechanism for detecting hate speech based on template strategy [ 32 ] . However , researchers such as Davidson et al . [ 3 ] found discrepancies suggesting limitations of keyword - based approaches . Following that Waseem et al . [ 4 ] utilized distributed semantics creating a baseline study in 2016 while different researches deviate from the traditional deﬁnition and target their own ‘hateful content’ . Related topics such as cyberbullying and depression analysis emerged while simultaneously studies using linguistic , knowledge - based , and visual representations increased drastically . Waseem et al . [ 26 ] also identiﬁed n - grams to be of signiﬁcant usage in this 2022 4th International Conference on Advances in Computing , Communication Control and Networking ( ICAC3N ) ISBN : 978 - 1 - 6654 - 7436 - 8 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 ©2022 IEEE 171 Akash Kumar Dept . of Computer Science & Engineering Delhi Technological University New Delhi , India akashxkumar1598 @ gmail . com Amar Singh Dept . of Computer Science & Engineering Delhi Technological University New Delhi , India amarsingh200021 @ gmail . com 2 022 4 t h I n t e r n a ti on a l C on f e r e n ce on A dv a n ce s i n C o m pu ti ng , C o mm un i ca ti on C on t r o l a nd N e t w o r k i ng ( I C A C 3 N ) | 978 - 1 - 6654 - 7436 - 8 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 © 2022 I EEE | DO I : 10 . 1109 / I C A C 3 N 56670 . 2022 . 10074044 ﬁeld and early deep learning approaches were being studied . It included early works by Djuric et al . [ 27 ] using word embeddings and transfer learning and multi - modal frameworks as well as CNNs by Park and Fung [ 25 ] . The most recent state - of - the - art hate speech techniques emphasize advanced graph - based features [ 28 ] , models like Bi - LSTM [ 30 ] , BERT based transfer learning [ 29 ] and a number of ensemble models and frameworks [ 31 , 41 , 42 ] . III . G ENERAL P IPELINE F OR H ATE S PEECH D ETECTION T ASK Different researchers have adopted different approaches in their respective works for the task of automatic hate speech detection . But most of them usually involve a series of steps that are a product of the generic classiﬁcation task . These include : Fig . 1 . Generic Flow of Hate Speech Detection 1 ) Dataset Collection - The ﬁrst and foremost step revolves around ﬁnding relevant datasets for the hate speech detection task . It can be achieved either by utilizing already existing datasets available for various languages like English , Hindi , Arabic , German , Spanish , Italian , etc . The other way is to create your own dataset from social media platforms such as Twitter . 2 ) Dataset preparation - Preprocessing techniques such as tokenization , lemmatization , stop word removals , text correction , stemming , noise removal , etc . are then ap - plied and the dataset is split into training and testing components . 3 ) Feature extraction and analysis - The next step is to ex - tract suitable features from the already prepared dataset so as to achieve a structured way of training and extract - ing useful information from the datasets . The majority of techniques are based on supervised methods . Bag of words , TF - IDF , linguistic features , n - grams , word em - beddings , multimodal knowledge - based features , word embeddings , and other features are examples . . 4 ) Training - The next important step is model training where machine and / or deep learning - based models are trained on the training dataset . Classiﬁers such as CNN , Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes play a huge role as the output from the trained model produces a binary or multiclass classiﬁcation result . 5 ) Evaluation and Comparison - The last step in the auto - matic hate speech detection task is to evaluate the result of the model on the basis of some parameters known as evaluation metrics . Precision , f1 - score , recall and the ROC Curve are some examples ( receiver operating char - acteristics ) , etc . all of which have their own signiﬁcance and can be chosen according to the requirements . IV . W IDELY U SED D ATASETS A . English : 1 ) Hateval , semeval 2019 : These datasets collected from twitter speciﬁcally focus on hateful speech against immigrants and women . It is a binary classiﬁcation dataset ( hate or non - hate ) that contains about 13000 tweets which includes aggressive or non - aggressive tweets within hateful ones . The data was collected for carrying out two subtasks in english as well as spanish languages [ 39 ] . 1 ) Annotation : Hate Speech a ) ’Nearly All White’ States Pose ’an Array of Prob - lems’ for Immigrants 2 ) Annotation : Non - Hate a ) Watch : Benjamin Netanyahu backs Trump’s de - cision to cut aid to the Palestinians and UN - RWA - Free Speech Time - https : / / t . co / SB843Zf0IF @ ISupport Israel 2 ) NAACL SRW2016 : : The dataset was collected from twit - ter and has been a widely utilized dataset for the hate speech classiﬁcation task . It contains three class labels ( sexism , racist , not ) with total dataset size of 16914 . It was gathered as part of the Predictive Characteristics for Offensive Speech Recognition on Twitter project [ 4 ] . 1 ) Annotation : Hate Speech a ) These girls remind me of the annoying Asian girls from a few years ago .

There are six labels ( There will be no racist , sexist , homophobic , or religiously motivated assaults on any community or attacks on other groups . ) . . 1 ) Annotation : Racism a ) They have Rights and the Race card B . Indonesian : Ibrohim et al [ 33 ] works on collecting Indonesian language data . In his research , [ 33 ] he collects Twitter dataset from [ 34 ] – [ 37 ] . He employs state - of - the - art crawling algorithms for Twitter dataset utilizing words / phrases widely used by Indone - sians while employing hate speech on social media platforms [ 33 ] , in addition to gathering Twitter dataset from earlier publications . He performs the crawling process using Twitter API3 that is implemented using Tweepy Library4 . They did label annotation of data for hate speech . They implemented a two - phase annotation system , with the ﬁrst annotation phase focusing on abusive language and hate speech labels , and the second annotation phase focusing on hate speech objective , type , and level tags . 1 ) Annotation : Hate Speech a ) Original Text : si penista agama , jaga mulut aja gabisa jaga jkt ? b ) Translated to English the religious penistan , just keep the mouth gabisa guard jkt ? 2 ) Annotation : Non - Hate a ) Original Text : ngomong pilih ahok djarot ngera - sain banjir ga sih ? : ( b ) Translated to English By the way , just like Ahok Djarot , it doesn’t work ? : ( C . Turkish : Coltekin et al . [ 38 ] collects turkish data via twitter using the most common route of twitter streaming api , here he ﬁlters the stream based on frequently used turkish language tweets and also by twitter’s languages identiﬁcation mech . Amount of data he collects is very huge thus provisioning enough to correctly classify it . A large corpus of data also means costly annotation process in terms of time . As a result , [ 33 ] simply annotate randomly picked tweets with minimum ﬁltering , resulting in a corpus that is less biassed and more reﬂective of the platform’s foul language usage . 1 ) Annotation : Hate Speech a ) Example Text 1 : @ user @ user burada atp tutacagna kotu kosullarda 3 kurusa sen calssana yiyorsa b ) Example Text 2 : @ user iste onur dedigin sende yok sorun iste 2 ) Annotation : Non - Hate a ) Example Text 1 : @ user @ user siwjsiqjakqjqoqj adamn proﬁline bak zaten herseyi quaresmayla ilgili b ) Example Text 2 hala hogwarts mektubum gelmediginden oluyor tum bunlar V . F EATURES F OR H ATE S PEECH A NALYSIS Feature extraction is an important stage in text categoriza - tion . This stage involves extracting essential characteristics from raw text and numerically expressing the retrieved fea - tures . There are a lot of different Feature extraction techniques that we have compared in this paper which are used with several models . A . TF - IDF : A numerical metric called term frequency - inverse document frequency assesses the relevance of a certain word in a data corpus . Each word is frequently given a score to show how important it is in the text and corpus . This approach is frequently used in the ﬁeld of text mining . The number of times a term appears in a single text is referred to as its term frequency . The term’s IDF is computed by dividing the number of documents in the whole corpus by the number of times text appearing in the text . The formula used is : tf − idf ( t , d ) = tf ( t , d ) ∗ idf ( t ) B . Bag of Words ( BoW ) : BOW is a technique for extracting numerical characteristics from text . To begin , tokenize all phrases and keep a dictionary of all unique tokens formed from them ( a huge bag ) ; next , count the number of times each token appears in each phrase . We make feature vectors out of our raw sentences . As a consequence , a sentence corpus may be represented as a matrix , with one row for each phrase and one column for each token inside the corpus . Text vectorization is the process of creating a feature column for each character . A BOW is made up of a vocab of known words and a way of measuring of the presence of known words . It speciﬁes the order in which words appear in a text or document . C . Word embeddings : • Word2Vec : It is used to determine semantic and syntactic word relations using an unsupervised word embedding - based method . It’s a 2 - layer neural network that generates a vocabulary from a set of texts based on words appearing in the set as much as a user - deﬁned criterion of times , thus reducing noise . The most frequent feature utilized in deep learning in NLP is word embeddings , which are vector - based word descriptions that map related words to closer vectors . • GloVe : This embedding method is often used in the identiﬁcation of hate speech in text . It’s an unsupervised learning - based strategy for constructing vector represen - tations of words . The models are pre - trained using a variety of corpora . Learning is based on a corpus’ aggre - gated global term co - occurrence data , and the generated representations highlight intriguing linear subprograms of the term vector space . 2022 4th International Conference on Advances in Computing , Communication Control and Networking ( ICAC3N ) 173 VI . C LASSIFIERS F OR D ETECTION A . Support Vector Machine : SVM being a supervised learning classiﬁcation technique does a decent job at detecting hate speech [ 21 ] . The best hyperplane for separating positive and negative data is de - termined using SVM [ 22 ] . The fundamental goal of SVM is to reduce classiﬁcation error rates as much as possible while increasing the positive / negative margin . The Lagrange Mul - tiplier approach can be used to solve the SVM optimization equation after it has been turned into a duality equation . B . Logistic Regression : When the dependent variable is dichotomous , logistic re - gression is the best regression algorithm to use . Logistic regression , like other regression studies , is a predictive study . Logistic regression is a technique for analyzing data and deter - mining the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables such as ordinal , time , or percentage . To map expected predictions and their probability , it em - ploys the Sigmoid function . If the calculated probability ex - ceeds a pre - set acceptance threshold on a graph , the algorithm predicts that the object will belong to that group . The model will predict that the object does not belong to the group if the estimated likelihood is less than the pre - deﬁned threshold on the graph . C . Naive Bayes : Building classiﬁers using Naive Bayes is a simple process , it represents the models which provides label for the classes to issue statements presented as feature values vectors , labels being picked from restricted group set . In order to train these classiﬁers we can have a lot of algorithms depending upon the exact the same basis . Every naive classiﬁer presume that one feature’s value does not depend on other feature’s value . An example for the context can bring some more light here , let’s suppose if diameter of a fruit is around 8 to 12 cm and is kind of red color as well is round , we can say it is a apple . A naive Bayes classiﬁer analyses each of the coloring , roundness , and diameter attributes to providing details to the chance that we have here apple as a fruit , regardless of any possible correlations between them . Naive Bayes has given admirable performance in a lot of strenuous here and now situations . Its results are reinforced by robust mathematical grounds based upon a lot of studies conducted in this ﬁeld [ 23 ] . Nonetheless , in 2006 , a compre - hensive study of several classiﬁcation algorithms found that alternative techniques , like boosted trees or random forests , outperformed Bayes classiﬁcation [ 24 ] . Naive Bayes stands out where we have limited access to training dataset in order to calculate the parameters for classiﬁcation . VII . M ULTILINGUAL S TUDIES This section delves into the discipline and topic of hate speech analysis , as well as the classic and modern approaches employed in the process . It is based on a number of method - ologies and acts as a building block for our study in the multilingual detection of abusive and hate speech using a transfer learning methodology . Hate speech is a method of encouraging and participating in harsh and violent deeds against an individual or a group of individuals . These can and do have a relationship with , and are inﬂuenced by , sex , religion , race , and other factors . Over the last decade , there has been a steady rise in hateful content online , notably on social media sites , and numerous studies have been conducted in reaction to toxic and hateful data online . To conduct research and investigate hateful and hurtful content , a variety of methodologies have been used . Some people make use of comment embeddings . Others , such as Gultom et al . [ 12 ] , analyse hateful speech using a variety of machine learning algorithms . SVM ( Support Vector Machine ) [ 13 ] , Naive Bayes [ 14 ] , SGD [ 15 ] , Logistic Regression [ 16 ] , and many other methodologies are among them . By combining two scenarios , they created their own dataset . One signiﬁcant goal is to incorporate hate speech research tools into languages other than English . Two main approaches are used to do this . The ﬁrst step entails translating a document written in a non - English language into English and then analysing and studying it using an algorithm . The second option is to work directly with the language , which has been made possible thanks to recent research initiatives . Apart from the use of features like n - grams and word embeddings , it featured transfer learning algorithms like spMMMP [ 20 ] and uhhLT [ 19 ] . Mayda et al . , Demir et al . , Dalyan et al . , and Diri et al . have all worked on hate detection in other languages . [ 17 ] undertook their own research to address the issue of a lack of dataset in the Turkish language , while Corazza et al . ( 2020 ) [ 19 ] used RNN to complete the assignment in Italian and German . CNN and LSTM [ 18 ] have been used in systems dealing with a variety of languages , including Spanish . All of them deal with some sort of feature extraction methods and preprocessing in their respective languages . VIII . R ESULTS O N S OME T ECHNIQUES : A C OMPARATIVE R EVIEW This section presents the evaluation results of some of the machine and deep learning models for hate speech detection in multiple languages . The evaluation metric chosen was f1 - score as it provides a balance between precision and recall which are two known evaluation metrics . 2022 4th International Conference on Advances in Computing , Communication Control and Networking ( ICAC3N ) 174 Datasets SVM SGD LR Glove + CNN Bi - LSTM italian 82 82 81 80 83 english 93 90 92 90 85 german 81 81 81 73 89 portugese 82 83 83 74 77 indonesian 71 70 69 81 80 spanish 72 74 74 64 70 french 68 69 72 70 72 danish 80 80 82 81 83 arabic 81 83 82 76 85 hindi 77 79 77 74 80 IX . C ONCLUSION We provided a survey on the automated identiﬁcation of hate speech in this study . Typically , this task is presented as a supervised learning issue . Bags of words or embeddings , for example , are rather general features that consistently produce decent classiﬁcation results . Existing hate speech recognition techniques perform badly when applied to fresh , previously unexplored datasets . Deep learning models are prone to over - ﬁtting in small datasets , and dataset biases are transferred to models . On 12 datasets , we examined numerous different algorithms such as SVM , logistic regression , Bi - LSTM , and Glove on the basis of F1 scores . Bi - LSTM was performing well among the different techniques that we have discussed on almost all language datasets . We argue for a benchmark data set for hate speech identiﬁcation to improve comparison of different characteristics and algorithms . The goal of this study’s future work is to expand the poll to a larger dataset so that there is less overﬁtting and bias .
