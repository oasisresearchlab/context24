Recent studies suggest parallels of the RME - 1 / EHD proteins to the Dynamin GTPase superfamily of mechanochemical pinchases that promote membrane fission . Here we show that that endogenous C . elegans AMPH - 1 , the only C . elegans member of Amphiphysin / BIN1 family of BAR - domain proteins , colocalizes with RME - 1 on recycling endosomes in vivo , that amph - 1 deletion mutants are defective in recycling endosome morphology and function , and that binding of AMPH - 1 NPF ( D / E ) sequences to the RME - 1 EH - domain promotes the recycling of transmembrane cargo . We also show a requirement for human BIN1 / Amphyphysin 2 in EHD1 - regulated endocytic recycling . In vitro we find that the purified recombinant AMPH - 1 / RME - 1 complexes produce short , coated , membrane tubules that are qualitatively distinct from those produced by either protein alone . Our results indicate that AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 cooperatively regulate endocytic recycling , likely through functions required for the production of cargo carriers exiting the recycling endosome for the cell surface .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Previous work has shown that RME - 1 and mRme - 1 / EHD1 are ATPases that require ATP binding for homo - oligomerization and function in vivo 1 – 4 . Like RME - 1 and mRme - 1 / EHD1 , vertebrate - specific paralogs EHD2 , EHD3 , and EHD4 also function in endocytic transport but at different steps5 – 8 . Although not apparent in the primary sequence , recent structural analysis of EHD2 revealed that its central ATP binding “G - domain” resembles the GTP binding domain of the large GTPase Dynamin9 , a protein that mediates membrane fission through its ability to constrict vesicle necks10 , 11 . Additional parallels of EHD2 to Dynamin were also found , including the ability of EHD2 to assemble into spiral rings around acidic liposomes when bound to a non - hydrolysable ATP analog9 . It was further shown that EHD2 ATPase activity is stimulated upon lipid binding and oligomerization , reminiscent of the assembly stimulated GAP activity characteristic of Dynamin9 . However , outside of the G - domain , RME - 1 / EHD family proteins are distinct from established Dynamin superfamily members . RME - 1 / EHD family proteins lack PH - domains . Rather the primary lipid binding region of EHD2 is helical in nature , forming a unique scissor - like interface in the EHD2 dimer9 . RME - 1 / EHD family proteins also lack proline - rich domains . Instead , RME - 1 / EHD family proteins contain a C - terminal Eps15 - homology ( EH ) domain , a different type of peptide binding interface known to target NPF ( Asn - Pro - Phe ) containing partner proteins12 , 13 . Given the high degree of overall similarity among RME - 1 / EHD family proteins , about 65 % sequence identity , and the recently identified similarities to Dynamin , it has been suggested that all RME - 1 / EHD family proteins could have Dynamin like properties in promoting membrane fission4 , 9 . In particular , because recycling receptors accumulate in endosomes in the absence of RME - 1 or EHD11 – 3 , RME - 1 / EHD1 could function as the fission machinery for tubules emanating from endosomes , promoting the release of transport carriers during receptor recycling events . RESULTS Identification of RME - 1 interacting proteins To gain greater insight into the role of RME - 1 at the recycling endosome , we sought functional interactors that might aid RME - 1 in the recycling process . Alignment of several known binding partners of the mammalian EHD proteins suggested that RME - 1 / EHD family EH - domains prefer NPF - target sequences found in multiples and / or followed by acidic residues ( reviewed in Ref . 13 ) . The acidic residues following an NPF sequence could potentially neutralize the unique positive surface charge near the NPF binding pocket of RME - 1 / EHD family EH - domains13 , 14 . Using bioinformatic searches of the predicted C . elegans proteome we identified 839 predicted worm proteins containing at least one NPF sequence ( Fig . 1a and Methods ) . 74 of these predicted proteins contained multiple NPFs and / or NPFs followed by acidic D / E stretches . To determine which of these 74 candidate RME - 1 interactors might be physiologically relevant , we performed RNAi knockdown of each candidate in transgenic animals expressing GFP - tagged RME - 1 . We reasoned that knockdown of a physiologically relevant RME - 1 binding partner could alter RME - 1 subcellular localization and / or alter recycling endosome morphology . Among the small number of candidate interactors that affected RME - 1 localization after RNAi we noted AMPH - 1 , the only C . elegans member of Pant et al . Page 2 Nat Cell Biol .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t the Amphiphysin / Bin1 family of BAR and SH3 domain proteins ( Fig . 1a ) . This was especially intriguing given the known interactions of mammalian Amphiphysin with Dynamin in pre - synaptic membranes of the nervous system15 , 16 . Physical interaction between RME - 1 and AMPH - 1 In order to determine if AMPH - 1 can physically bind to RME - 1 , we performed yeast two - hybrid based tests and GST pull - down analysis . AMPH - 1 interacted with the RME - 1 EH domain in the yeast two - hybrid system ( Fig . 1b ) . The interaction was abolished when either or both AMPH - 1 NPF sequences were altered by alanine substitution at phenylalanine F309 and / or F363 ( Fig . 1b ) . In the pull down experiment , full length AMPH - 1 from wild - type worm lysates , or in vitro translated AMPH - 1 ( + ) was efficiently isolated by immobilized GST - RME - 1 EH - domain fusion protein ( Fig . 1c ; Supplemental information S1 b ) . AMPH - 1 also bound strongly to the EH - domain of mammalian mRme - 1 / EHD1 in this assay ( Fig . 1e ) . Little or no binding of AMPH - 1 to the EH - domains of other endocytic proteins Eps15 or Intersectin was observed , indicating the specificity of the interaction ( Fig 1e ) . Furthermore in vitro translated AMPH - 1 ( F309A , F363A ) , lacking intact NPF motifs , failed to bind to GST - RME - 1 EH - domain fusion protein ( Fig . 1c ) , and alanine substitution of the first three aspartic acid residues following each NPF motif reduced binding ( Fig . 1f ) . Full length in vitro translated RME - 1 could be isolated by immobilized full length GST - AMPH - 1 fusion protein ( Fig . 1d ) . We conclude that AMPH - 1 binds directly to RME - 1 , and that this interaction requires the RME - 1 EH domain and the two NPF [ D / E ] motifs present within AMPH - 1 . AMPH - 1 is enriched on recycling endosomes RME - 1 is ubiquitously expressed in C . elegans , and is highly enriched on tubulovesicular basolateral recycling endosomes in the polarized intestinal epithelium1 . In transgenic animals , AMPH - 1 - GFP under the control of amph - 1 genomic DNA regulatory sequences was similarly widely expressed ( Supplemental information , Fig . S1c – j ) . Affinity - purified anti - AMPH - 1 antibodies detected a single band of the expected size for AMPH - 1 in Western blots of wild - type animals . This band was absent in amph - 1 ( tm1060 ) deletion mutant animals obtained from the Japanese National Bioresource Project for the Experimental Animal “Nematode C . elegans ” ( Supplemental information , Fig . S1a and see below ) , establishing the specificity of the antibody . Using immunofluorescence , we found that endogenous AMPH - 1 colocalizes extensively with endogenous RME - 1 on tubulovesicular basolateral recycling endosomes ( Fig . 2a - a’’ ) , and on more weakly labeled sub - apical structures of the worm intestine , possibly the apical recycling endosomes ( Supplemental information , Fig . S2c - c’’ ) . While there was significant overlap of RME - 1 and AMPH - 1 labeling on the recycling endosome , the two proteins do not label the endosome identically . This may reflect differences in the degree of association with specific endosomal sub - domains , or may reflect temporal differences in the assembly or disassembly kinetics of the two proteins . Endogenous AMPH - 1 also colocalized with basolateral GFP - tagged SDPN - 1 / Syndapin / Pacsin , another marker for the C . elegans recycling endosome ( Fig . 2b - b’’ ) 17 . Anti - AMPH - 1 staining failed to colocalize with markers for the clathrin coated pits ( GFP - tagged CHC - 1 / clathrin ) 18 , early endosome ( GFP - Pant et al . Page 3 Nat Cell Biol .

S3 ) . We also observed extensive colocalization of mCherry - RME - 1 and AMPH - 1 - GFP in living transgenic animals , supporting the data derived from fixed tissue ( Supplemental information , Fig . S2a - a’’ ) . The lack of association of AMPH - 1 with clathrin - coated pits is consistent with the absence of a consensus CLAP ( clathrin and adaptor AP2 binding ) domain in worm AMPH - 1 . In fact the CLAP domain is specific for certain isoforms of vertebrate Amphiphysins and is not found in any known invertebrate Amphiphysin family members20 . In Drosophila , dAmph has been shown to lack Shibire / Dynamin binding ability , does not colocalize with Shibire / Dynamin , and does not produce shibire - like phenotypes when mutated21 – 23 . While Drosophila Shibire / Dynamin and C . elegans DYN - 1 / Dynamin do posses proline rich sequences , neither Dynamin ortholog contains the PXRPXR consensus motif that is recognized by Amphiphysin SH3 domains in vertebrates24 . Notably , Drosophila Amphiphysin does contain an NPF sequence followed by acidic residues , suggesting potential interaction with an RME - 1 / EHD family member . amph - 1 null mutants are defective in endocytic recycling In order to determine the function of AMPH - 1 in vivo , we characterized the phenotype of amph - 1 ( tm1060 ) null mutants . To detect recycling defects , we first focused on previously validated model recycling cargo proteins hTfR - GFP ( human transferrin receptor ) and hTac - GFP ( IL2 - receptor alpha chain ) 25 , 26 . hTfR is internalized via clathrin - dependent mechanisms , while hTac is internalized by clathrin - independent mechanisms27 . Both of these model recycling cargo proteins depend upon RME - 1 / EHD1 for their recycling in mammalian cells and worm cells , accumulating in recycling endosomes in the absence of RME - 1 / EHD1 function 2 , 3 17 , 19 . The number of hTac - GFP and hTfR - GFP intracellular puncta number increased by more than 10 - fold compared to wild type controls in amph - 1 mutants ( Fig . 3 a – c , d – f ) . These results indicate a defect in basolateral recycling in the intestinal epithelia of amph - 1 mutants , very similar to that found in rme - 1 mutants . Specific disruption of recycling endosomes in amph - 1 mutants Further analysis showed that RME - 1 labeling of basolateral recycling endosomes was profoundly abnormal in amph - 1 mutant animals , with loss of most tubular labeling and an increase in diffuse GFP - RME - 1 labeling . Only a small number of RME - 1 labeled punctate structures remained ( Fig . 3 g – i ; Supplemental information , Fig . S5 ) . The loss of RME - 1 from recycling endosomes confirmed the amph - 1 ( RNAi ) results from the initial screen , suggesting that AMPH - 1 functions , at least in part , to recruit RME - 1 to the recycling endosome membrane . We also found that loss of amph - 1 disrupted another recycling endosome marker SDPN - 1 - GFP , with greatly reduced SDPN - 1 - GFP puncta number , and gross enlargement of remaining labeled structures ( Fig . 3 j – l ) . This phenotype is very similar to that we previously found in rme - 1 mutants17 , further indicating that AMPH - 1 functions with RME - 1 in vivo . We did note however that some amph - 1 phenotypes appear weaker than rme - 1 phenotypes , such as in the accumulation of fluid filled vacuoles in the intestine , and the transport of yolk proteins from the intestine to the oocyte ( data not shown ) . This Pant et al . Page 4 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 June 01 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t might indicate some functional redundancy between AMPH - 1 and other BAR domain adaptor proteins , or residual RME - 1 activity in the absence of AMPH - 1 . We also examined amph - 1 mutants for effects on early endosomes . This was particularly important because mutants known to affect an earlier recycling step , from the early endosome to the recycling endosome , produce a similar set of phenotypes , including loss of RME - 1 - labeled recycling endosomes and intracellular trapping of recycling cargo proteins such as hTac - GFP19 . The key distinguishing characteristic of an earlier block , such as that displayed by rab - 10 mutants , is the dramatic over - accumulation of early endosomes , a phenotype not found in rme - 1 mutants19 . Consistent with a later function for AMPH - 1 at the recycling endosome to plasma membrane step , the morphology and distribution of early endosome markers GFP - RAB - 5 and GFP - RAB - 10 was unperturbed in amph - 1 mutants ( Supplemental information , Fig . S4 a – c , d – f ) . Finally , because mammalian Amphiphysin has been associated with plasma membrane clathrin - coated pits16 , 28 – 30 , we investigated whether amph - 1 mutants alter the morphology or distribution of functional GFP - tagged Dynamin or Clathrin . We found that DYN - 1 - GFP and GFP - CHC - 1 localization was unaltered in amph - 1 mutants , consistent with the proposal that C . elegans AMPH - 1 does not interact with Dynamin , similar to previous findings in Drosophila ( Supplemental information Fig . S4 g – i , j – l ) 21 – 23 . Thus , we do not find any evidence that worm AMPH - 1 is involved in recruiting DYN - 1 / dynamin to the clathrin coated pit during endocytic uptake at the plasma membrane . Instead , C . elegans AMPH - 1 appears to be specific for RME - 1 mediated recycling processes . AMPH - 1 requires its interaction with RME - 1 for recycling function Having established the effects of loss of AMPH - 1 on endocytic traffic , and the close association of AMPH - 1 with RME - 1 , we sought to determine the importance of the AMPH - 1 / RME - 1 physical association in vivo . Thus we tested the ability of transgenically expressed AMPH - 1 , with or without intact RME - 1 interaction motifs , to rescue amph - 1 mutant phenotypes . We found that although AMPH - 1 ( F309A , F363A ) expressed as well as AMPH - 1 ( + ) ( Supplemental information Fig . S5 a – b ) , only AMPH - 1 ( + ) rescued the amph - 1 mutant phenotypes with respect to hTfR accumulation and RME - 1 localization ( Fig . 4 and Supplemental information Fig . S5c – g ) , indicating that AMPH - 1 requires its interaction with RME - 1 to perform its role as an endocytic recycling regulator . We also found that AMPH - 1 protein is mislocalized in rme - 1 ( 0 ) mutants . Instead of an extended tubulovesicular pattern , we observed a more concentrated localization of endogenous AMPH - 1 to enlarged structures , similar to the abnormal localization of SDPN - 1 in rme - 1 mutants ( Supplemental information , Fig . S5h – l ) . However AMPH - 1 still appeared to be membrane associated in the absence of RME - 1 , suggesting that AMPH - 1 does not require RME - 1 for membrane recruitment . Mammalian Bin1 / Amphiphysin2 functions in recycling Unlike C . elegans , which appears to express only one Amphiphysin isoform , the mammalian genome contains two distinct Amphiphysin genes denoted Amphiphysin 1 and Bin1 / Amphiphysin 2 . Each of these genes encodes multiple protein isoforms . Amph1 is brain Pant et al . Page 5 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 June 01 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t specific and Amph2a is brain enriched . Both of these isoforms contain a CLAP domain for Clathrin and AP2 adaptor binding . Amph1 and Amph2a form heterodimers and are thought to aid endocytic uptake at the synaptic clathrin coated pit , at least in part through interaction with Dynamin15 , 16 , 28 , 29 , 31 – 33 . Other forms of BIN1 / Amph2 lack clathrin / AP2 interaction modules . One specific isoform functions in muscle development34 , while other isoforms , such as BIN1 isoform 10 discussed below , have no known function . In fact , it has been shown that BIN1 / Amph2 knockout MEF cells are not defective in endocytic uptake of transferrin , rather showing an approximately two - fold increase in transferrin uptake35 . Although the known BIN1 isoforms lack NPF sequences , and so may not bind to mammalian RME - 1 / EHD proteins directly , we considered the possibility that as in C . elegans , mammalian BIN1 / Amph2 might play a role in endocytic recycling . In fact , we observed weak co - immunoprecipitation of myc - EHD1 with HA - Bin1 isoform 10 in transfected cells ( Fig . 5 i ) . As a direct measure of the importance of BIN1 in endocytic transport , we followed fluorescently labeled transferrin transport in BIN1 depleted HeLa cells using previously described pulse - chase assays27 . BIN1 knockdown strongly reduced expression of all forms of BIN1 / Amph2 in HeLa cells as determined by Western blot ( Supplemental information Fig . S6a ) . Consistent with the previously published results in knockout MEFs , we found that HeLa cells depleted of BIN1 / Amph2 are not defective in transferrin uptake . Rather uptake was increased in BIN1 knockdown cells after 7 min of Tf uptake as measured by FACS ( mock treated 348±118 a . u . , BIN1 RNAi 662±325 a . u . , averaged from three independent experiments ) or visualized by microscopy ( Fig . 5a , c ) . Consistent with a role for BIN1 in recycling from the ERC , we found that transferrin accumulated in the juxtanuclear compartment in BIN1 / Amph2 depleted cells ( Fig . 5b , d ) , and recycling was delayed as measured by image quantification ( Fig . 5e ) as well as by FACS analysis ( Supplemental information Fig . S6b ) . Consistent with the idea that BIN1 / Amph2 functions directly in transport from the ERC , we found that BIN1 was enriched on distinctive mRME - 1 / EHD1 - positive tubules . This could be visualized in cells overexpressing myc - EHD1 and HA - Bin1 isoform 10 ( Fig . 5 f - f’’ ) , and in untransfected cells visualizing the endogenous proteins using EHD1 and BIN1 ( isoform non - specific ) antibodies ( Supplemental information , Fig . S6c - c’’ ) . The EHD1 - positive tubules have been previously shown to be endogenous features of HeLa cells , emanating from the endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) 3 . These tubular endosomes are involved in the recycling of cargo proteins from the ERC to the plasma membrane 3 , and the absence of EHD1 from these structures leads to impaired recycling36 . We found that depletion of BIN1 / Amph2 disrupted the EHD1 - positive recycling tubules ( Fig . 5g – h ) . After depletion of BIN1 / Amph2 , EHD1 localization was limited to a compact juxtanuclear localization , consistent with the main body of the ERC ( Fig . 5h ) 37 . Taken together these results indicate the BIN1 is important for the formation and / or maintenance of ERC derived tubules . Furthermore these results indicate that the requirement for an amphiphysin family protein in the endocytic recycling pathway is a conserved evolutionary feature from worms to mammals . Pant et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Reconstitution of RME - 1 / AMPH - 1 interactions in a liposome system Previous reports have shown that mammalian Amphiphysin38 , mammalian Dynamin15 , 33 , 38 , and mammalian EHD29 have the capacity to bind to negatively charged liposomes and deform the membrane to produce tubules15 , 38 , 9 . Mammalian HeLa cell recycling endosomes are enriched in PIP2 due to the activation of PI5K by Arf6 on these endosomes39 and PI4P has also been recently identified as a component of these endosomes36 . As a first step toward determining the membrane binding capacity of worm RME - 1 and AMPH - 1 , we tested the interaction of purified recombinant RME - 1 and AMPH - 1 with liposomes in a sedimentation assay . We found that both RME - 1 and AMPH - 1 pelleted with acidic Phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) liposomes , or with a more physiological liposome composition containing 10 % PS and 10 % PIP2 ( phosphatidylinositol - [ 4 , 5 ] - bisphosphate ) or 10 % PI4P ( phosphatidylinositol - [ 4 ] - phosphate ) ( Fig 6a , Fig . 7a ) . Interestingly the binding to PIP2 , PI4P , and PI - containing liposomes appeared enhanced when both proteins were added to the reaction , compared to adding the proteins individually ( Fig . 7a ) . We observed no binding of either protein to neutral Phosphatidylcholine ( PtdChl ) liposomes ( Fig . 6a , Fig . 7a ) . We observed equivalent binding of RME - 1 to PS liposomes in the presence of ADP or non - hydrolysable ATP analog ATP - γ - S , indicating that under these binding conditions , RME - 1 association with liposomes was independent of its nucleotide state ( Fig . 6a , Fig . 8a ) . We also examined the morphology of liposomes incubated with RME - 1 and / or AMPH - 1 by electron microscopy . In the presence of ATP - γ - S , RME - 1 tubulates 400 nm average diameter PS liposomes into approximately 120 nm wide tubules with an average length of 1 µm ( Fig . 6d - d’ , 6f – g ) . The tubules were decorated with ring - like striations reminiscent of structures formed by mammalian Dynamin and EHD2 on liposomes . The rings likely represent highly ordered RME - 1 ( ATP - γ - S ) oligomers wrapping around the tubule , with regions of close ring packing and regions of looser packing . We found that in the presence of ATP γ S , RME - 1 tubulated PIP2 / PS / PC containing liposomes into long but narrower tubules than those produced from PS - only liposomes ( Fig 7c - c’ , f – g ) . In profile , these tubules displayed an irregular spike like coated appearance . Frequently , we also observed structures resembling constrictions along the length of the tubule , imparting a beads - on - string appearance to the tubulating liposomes . In the absence of RME - 1 , AMPH - 1 tubulated 400 nm average diameter PS liposomes into 50 nm wide tubules with an average length of 1 . 1 µm ( Fig . 6c - c’ , 6f – g ) , much narrower than the tubules formed in the presence of RME - 1 alone . Similar results were obtained for AMPH - 1 incubated with PIP2 / PS / PC liposomes ( Fig . 7d - d’ ) . The physical and functional interaction of AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 suggests that the two proteins work together to promote recycling through endosomal tubules . We therefore investigated the biochemical interaction of AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 in membrane tubulation . Tubules generated from PS liposomes incubated with AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 , in the presence of ATP - γ - S , were qualitatively different from tubules generated by the individual proteins ( Fig . 6e - e’ ) . The most striking difference is reduction in length of the tubules produced by AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 ( ATP - γ - S ) together . Such tubules are about one - third the length of Pant et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t tubules produced by the individual proteins ( Fig . 6f – g ) . In addition , in the presence of AMPH - 1 , the apparent RME - 1 ( ATP - γ - S ) spiral coat on the tubules is more regular and closely spaced than in RME - 1 ( ATP - γ - S ) tubules ( Fig . 6h ) . The tubules produced by AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 ( ATP - γ - S ) together are more rigid and the decoration is more pronounced in profile than that produced by the individual proteins ( Fig . 6e’ ) . Similar to our observation with 100 % PS liposomes , upon incubation with 10 % PIP2 liposomes we found that a combination of AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 generated tubules that were dramatically shorter than those produced by the individual proteins ( Fig . 7e - e’ , g ) . The physical interaction of AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 through the AMPH - 1 NPF motifs appears critical for the formation of hybrid tubules . AMPH - 1 ( F309A , F363A ) was unable to form short tubules from PS liposomes when co - incubated with RME - 1 ( ATP - γ - S ) . Rather long thin tubules equivalent to AMPH - 1 ( F309A , F363A ) alone dominated the reaction ( Supplemental information , Fig . S7 ) . A few wide RME - 1 type tubules were also observed but were relatively rare . The ratio of AMPH - 1 to RME - 1 in the reaction mixture does not appear to control tubule length , since reducing AMPH - 1 by 10 - fold to 250nM , while keeping RME - 1 levels constant ( 2 . 5µM ) , produced many short PS tubules that were similar in length to those produced by the proteins at 1 : 1 stoichiometry . This suggests that AMPH - 1 and RME - 1 tend to assemble into a coat of a particular length , rather than one of varying length dependent upon their relative available protein concentrations . ( See Supplemental information Fig . S7f – g ) . RME - 1 nucleotide state is critical for tubulation Finally we investigated effects of nucleotide state on the in vitro reaction . We found that RME - 1 ( ADP ) lacks most tubulation activity in this assay , even though it still binds to PS liposomes ( Fig . 8 ) . Furthermore , we found that RME - 1 ( ADP ) together with AMPH - 1 added to PS liposome preparations led to an approximately 7 - fold decrease in tubulation capacity , including loss of most of the characteristically thin tubules produced by AMPH - 1 alone . This suggests that RME - 1 in the inactive ADP - bound state interacts with AMPH - 1 and prevents AMPH - 1 mediated tubulation . Our RME - 1 tubulation results are somewhat different from those reported for mammalian EHD2 , the most diverged member of this protein family . EHD2 was found to be insensitive to nucleotide condition in tubulating PS liposomes9 . Although under more stringent binding conditions , with liposomes of lower PS composition , EHD2 liposome tubulation was also dependent on nucleotide state 9 . DISCUSSION The work of Daumke et . al . 9 , and the work presented here , suggest that RME - 1 / EHD family proteins could function in membrane tubulation and potentially membrane fission , using a self - assembly mechanism with overall similarity to Dynamin . AMPH - 1 , through it’s BAR domain , could function to initiate tubule formation from endosomes , recruiting and activating RME - 1 ATPase activity to drive tubule fission . It is also quite interesting to note that AMPH - 1 appears to limit the assembly of RME - 1 rings on membrane tubules . Recent work on the mechanism of Dynamin - mediated membrane fission indicates that short Dynamin spirals are the active agents of fission40 , 41 . In those studies , long Dynamin Pant et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t assemblies were found to constrict tubules , but failed to promote fission upon GTP hydrolysis , while GTP hydrolysis and membrane release by short Dynamin assemblies frequently produced full fission . Thus by limiting RME - 1 spiral assembly , AMPH - 1 may help to generate productive RME - 1 assemblies . The AMPH - 1 SH3 domain might interact with other endocytic regulatory proteins and help create a hub for protein interactions relevant for the RME - 1 recycling function . Another similarity of RME - 1 / EHD family proteins and Dynamin is that they interact with Syndapin / Pacsin , a known activator of Wasp and Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerization , suggesting that RME - 1 family proteins may promote actin dynamics on endosomes to promote membrane fission42 . Membrane associated actin dynamics is thought to promote membrane fission by increasing membrane tension during Dynamin - mediated membrane constriction43 . Further analysis of RME - 1 / EHD function is likely to provide important insights into membrane fission mechanisms that operate on endosomal membranes . METHODS Bioinformatic Screen We searched the C . elegans proteome ( WormBase release WS136 ) for all predicted ORFs containing the Asparagine - Proline - Phenylalanine ( NPF ) motif using the program myHits version 2 . 0 ( myhits . isb - sib . ch ) . A total of 839 proteins were identified . These NPF containing sequences were further selected for those containing multiple NPF tripeptides ( 57 proteins ) followed by either aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues within 5 amino acids . We found 17 C . elegans NPF containing proteins with varying degrees of D and / or E enrichment at these positions . C . elegans F58G6 . 1 / Amphiphysin - like / Amphiphysin contained two NPF [ D / E ] sequences . RNAi Screen Strain RT33 , expressing GFP - RME - 1 under rme - 1 promoter control in all somatic tissues , was examined by epifluorescence microscopy at 630X magnification for abnormal RME - 1 subcellular localization or recycling endosome morphology after RNAi of each of the 74 multi - NPF and NPF ( D / E ) candidates . RNAi clones were obtained from the Ahringer library44 or were constructed by cloning cDNAs into RNAi vector L4440 and transforming HT115 cells . RNAi screening was performed by the feeding method as previously described45 . Animals were scored as young adults in the P0 generation and after 4 more days of growth on fresh RNAi plates , animals of the next ( F1 ) generation were also scored . All trials included a positive control ( L4440 - rab - 10 ) and a negative control ( L4440 empty vector ) . The screen was performed twice under identical experimental conditions .

Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa - 488 or Alexa - 568 were purchased from Molecular Probes and were used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 . HeLa cells were grown on cover - glasses and fixed with 4 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde in PBS . Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies prepared in staining solution [ 0 . 2 % saponin ( w / v ) and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS ] for 1 hr at room temperature . After washes in PBS , the cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorochrome - conjugated secondary antibody mixture in staining solution for 30 min at room temperature . All images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) using a 63X objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 4 . Transferrin ( Tf ) Recycling assay Tf - 568 was purchased from Molecular Probes ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . HeLa cells on plates were mock treated or treated with Bin - 1 - RNAi oligonucleotides . After 72 h , cells starved for 30 minutes in DMEM lacking serum ( but containing 0 . 5 % BSA ) were either pulsed with 16 . 7 µg / ml transferrin - Alexa Fluor 568 ( Tf - 568 ; Invitrogen ) for 15 min and fixed immediately ( t = 0 , uptake measurement ) , or then ' chased ' in complete media for the indicated times prior to fixation . Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) by using a 63× 1 . 4 numerical aperture objective with appropriate filters . All micrographs shown are representative images from experiments that have been repeated at least three times . Quantification of mean fluorescence was done using LSM Pascal software . Bars represent the mean ± standard error calculated from counting 70 – 80 cells each from three independent experiments . For Flow cytometry analysis , the remaining intracellular Tf - 568 levels for 10 , 000 cells were determined at indicated time points after the start of chase . Error bars indicate standard error from three independent experiments . Protein expression and purification of full length tagless proteins C . elegans AMPH - 1 , AMPH - 1 ( F309A , F363A ) and RME - 1 full - length proteins were expressed as N - terminal GST - fusions followed by a PreScission cleavage site in Escherichia coli Arctic Express cells ( Stratagene , Agilent La Jolla , CA ) . Bacterial cultures in LB medium were induced at an OD 600 of 0 . 5 with 1 mM IPTG , and grown overnight at 15°C . Bacteria were lysed in 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM Phenyl - methyl - sulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) ( Sigma Aldrich , St .

For experiments to determine the contribution of AMPH - 1 NPF sequences to the tubulation reaction , experiments were performed as described in this section and using 2 . 5 µM RME - 1 and / or AMPH - 1 ( F309A , F363A ) incubated with 0 . 05 mg / ml final concentration of 100 % PS liposomes and 1mM ATP - γ - S . All samples were incubated on ice for 4 minutes and 12 minutes after the start of protein addition the samples were spotted on formvar carbon coated 300 mesh Copper grid . After negative staining with 1 % uranyl acetate , electron microscopy was performed using a JEOL 1200 EX or JEOL 100 CX transmission electron microscope at 80 KV . Control experiments included no - liposome , protein incubations under identical experimental conditions , but with 2 . 5µM each of GST alone , GST with RME - 1 or GST with AMPH - 1 . Images were obtained at 15 , 000× and 50 , 000× magnification as indicated . For quantification of AMPH - 1 tubulation in the presence and absence of RME - 1 in an ADP nucleotide condition , micrographs were imaged at 3 , 000× , for large field in which tubules could be clearly distinguished . The electron micrographs were scanned using a CanoScan scanner . For the selected images included in Figure 6 – Figure 8 and Figures S7 , the Adobe Photoshop CS Levels function was used to alter contrast to best represent the observed features . Quantification of liposome tubule length and diameter were performed using Adobe Photoshop CS Ruler function . Individual tubule lengths , diameters or inter striation distances were measured and converted to nm measures utilizing the measured length of the scale bar at that EM magnification . Mean values were calculated and plotted as graphs . Standard deviations were used for Y - error bars on graphs . Statistical analysis was performed utilizing a Student’s paired T - test . Significance was determined at p - values less than 0 . 01 and is noted by asterisks on figures and in figure legends . Statistical analysis For all data sets the standard deviation value from data sets was utilized as Y - error bars on bar graphs plotted for mean value of the data . Data sets were subjected to Student’s one - tailed paired T - test analysis . Data were considered significantly different if p - values were lower than 0 . 01 . p - values for various experiments are included in the figure legends . In all experiments presented , p - values less than 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant and are marked by asterisks in the Figures .
