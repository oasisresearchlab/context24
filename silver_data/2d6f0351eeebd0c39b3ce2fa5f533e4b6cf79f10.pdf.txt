Eugene Stanley , Boston University , Boston , MA , and approved September 14 , 2005 ( received for review May 12 , 2005 ) The ability of cells to sense spatial gradients of chemoattractant factors governs the development of complex eukaryotic organ - isms . Cells exposed to shallow chemoattractant gradients respond with strong accumulation of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and its D3 - phosphoinositide product ( PIP 3 ) on the plasma membrane side exposed to the highest chemoattractant concentration , whereas PIP 3 - degrading enzyme PTEN and its prod - uct PIP 2 localize in a complementary pattern . Such an early sym - metry - breaking event is a mandatory step for directed cell move - ment elicited by chemoattractants , but its physical origin is still mysterious . Here , we propose that directional sensing is the consequence of a phase - ordering process mediated by phospho - inositide diffusion and driven by the distribution of chemotactic signal . By studying a realistic reaction – diffusion lattice model that describes PI3K and PTEN enzymatic activity , recruitment to the plasma membrane , and diffusion of their phosphoinositide prod - ucts , we show that the effective enzyme – enzyme interaction induced by catalysis and diffusion introduces an instability of the system toward phase separation for realistic values of physical parameters . In this framework , large reversible ampliﬁcation of shallow chemotactic gradients , selective localization of chemical factors , macroscopic response timescales , and spontaneous polar - ization arise naturally . The model is robust with respect to order - of - magnitude variations of the parameters . directional sensing (cid:1) lattice model (cid:1) ﬁrst - order phase transitions T he general picture emerging from the analysis of chemotaxis in several different eukaryotic cell types indicates that , in the process of directional sensing , a shallow extracellular gradient of chemoattractant is translated into an equally shallow gradient of receptor activation ( 1 ) that in turn elicits the recruitment of the cytosolic enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) to the plasma membrane , where it phosphorylates PIP 2 into the D3 - phosphoinositide product of PI3K , PIP 3 . However , phosphoino - sitide distribution does not simply mirror the receptor activation gradient , but rather a strong and sharp separation in PIP 2 - and PIP 3 - rich phases arises ( 1 ) , realizing a powerful and efficient amplification of the external chemotactic signal . PIP 3 acts as a docking site for plekstrin homology - domain - containing effector proteins that induce cell polarization , i . e . , the generation of biochemically defined cell anterior and posterior sides , regulate cytoskeletal dynamics ( 2 ) , and eventually cell motion ( 3 ) . Cell polarization can be decoupled from directional sensing by the use of inhibitors of actin polymerization so that cells are immobilized but respond with the same signal amplification of untreated cells ( 4 ) . The action of PI3K is counteracted by the phosphatase PTEN that dephosphorylates PIP 3 into PIP 2 ( 1 ) . PTEN localization at the cell membrane depends on the binding to PIP 2 of its first 16 N - terminal amino acids ( 5 ) . Because PI3K and PTEN constitute a pair of enzymes with counteracting biochemical activities , it has been conjectured that in chemo - tacting cells mutual regulation between the two enzymes could be responsible for their localization into complementary regions of the cell surface . In physical terms , the process of directional sensing shows the characteristic phenomenology of phase separation ( 6 ) . However , it is not clear which mechanism could be responsible for it . In known physical models , such as binary alloys , phase separation is the consequence of some kind of interaction among the constituents of a system , which can favor their segregation in separated phases ( 7 ) . In this work we show that , even in the absence of direct enzyme – enzyme or phosphoinositide – phosphoinositide interactions , catalysis and phosphoinositide diffusion mediate an effective interaction among enzymes , which is sufficient to drive the system toward phase separation . Materials and Methods A semiregular tessellation of the sphere composed of 10 , 230 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal sites was used to represent the plasma membrane . On each site , the number of molecules of any given type was represented as an integer variable . The probability rate f is for a reaction or diffusion step of type s ( s (cid:1) 1 , . . . , R ) to take place at site i ( i (cid:1) 1 , . . . , N s ) was decomposed in the product of a global ( site independent ) rate f s and a local ( site dependent ) probability p is . Global rates were functions of the global number of available reactants , whereas local probabilities were functions of their local concentrations , following from the expressions given in Tables 1 and 2 and the normalization conditions ¥ i (cid:1) 1 N s p is (cid:1) 1 . Reaction and diffusion processes were performed stochastically according to the following algorithm ( see Data Set 1 , which is published as support - ing information on the PNAS web site ) ( 8 and 9 ) . At each time step , the reaction or diffusion step of type s was chosen with probability f s (cid:2) ¥ u (cid:1) 1 R f u . Then the site i where the reaction or diffusion step had to take place was chosen with probability p is . The reaction or diffusion step was then performed . The tables of global rates and local probabilities were updated to take into account the variation in the values of the local and global values of available reactants . The tables of local probabilities were ordered with the use of a bisection algorithm to speed up the choice of the next reaction – diffusion site i . Time was advanced as a Poisson process with mean 1 (cid:2) ¥ u (cid:1) 1 R f u . The simulations were performed on a 99 dual - processor nodes Beowulf cluster [ 2800 MHz Athlon processors ( AMD , Sunnyvale , CA ) with 4 Gbyte of memory each ] using SLACKWARE LINUX ( Slackware Linux , Brentwood , CA ) and the GNU C compiler ( http : (cid:2)(cid:2) gcc . gnu . org ) . Simulation results were represented graphi - cally by using MATLAB ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) .

Be - cause the chemical system is characterized by extremely low concentrations of chemical factors [ 0 – 50 nM for enzymes ( 10 ) and 0 . 1 – 1 (cid:1) M for phosphoinositides ( 11 ) ] and evolution takes place out of equilibrium , we used a stochastic approach ( 8 , 9 ) . Indeed , rare , large fluctuations are likely to be relevant for kinetics in the presence of unstable or metastable states . This assumption is also consistent with the observation that cell response to chemotactic stimuli has a stochastic character ( 12 ) . Simulated reactions and diffusion processes are summarized as follows : 1 . PI3K ( cytosol ) (cid:2) Rec ( i ) 7 PI3K (cid:1) Rec ( i ) 2 . PTEN ( cytosol ) (cid:2) PIP 2 ( i ) 7 PTEN (cid:1) PIP 2 ( i ) 3 . PI3K (cid:1) Rec ( i ) (cid:2) PIP 2 ( i ) 3 PI3K (cid:1) Rec ( i ) (cid:2) PIP 3 ( i ) 4 .

PIP 3 ( i ) 3 PIP 3 ( j ) Index i represents a generic plasma membrane site and j one of its nearest neighbors . We have simulated the chemical kinetics on the inner face of the plasma membrane as a two - dimensional lattice gas coupled to an unstructured cytoplasmic reservoir . On each site i of the lattice we have assumed the presence of a number n i ( k ) of molecules of the k - th species . Chemical reactions and diffusion have been simulated as random processes with intensities proportional to kinetic reaction and diffusion rates ( see Tables 1 and 2 ) . The probability of performing a reaction on a given site is taken to be proportional to realistic kinetic reaction rates and local reactant concentrations ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . Stochastic Simulation . The plasma membrane is represented as a sphere of radius R (cid:1) 10 (cid:1) m partitioned in N s (cid:1) 10 , 242 computational sites forming a honeycomb lattice with 12 pen - tagonal defects . Chemical concentrations are represented as integer variables n i ( k ) giving the number of molecules of the k - th species present on site i . Reaction – diffusion kinetics is simulated according to Gillespie’s method ( 8 ) generalized to the case of an anisotropic environment . Catalytic processes are described by Michaelis – Menten kinetics . The density of activated receptors is proportional to extracellular chemoattractant concentration . The probability of diffusion from a computational site to a neighboring one is assumed proportional to the difference in local concentrations , according to Fick’s law . Time is advanced as a Poisson process . To provide complete reproducibility , the C code of the simulation algorithm is included as Data Set 1 . The density (cid:2) of activated receptors controls PI3K recruiting to the plasma membrane , thus playing the role of a chemical potential ( 13 ) . Although receptor activation is directly controlled in the experiments through the extracellular concentration of chemoattractant stimulus , it is difficult to control experimentally [ PI3K ] . We have therefore set [ PI3K ] to a realistic fixed value ( Table 2 ) and varied (cid:2) in the range 0 – 100 nM . Diffusion controls the behavior of the system in an obvious way , because for high values it tends to mix chemical species , but in conjunction with catalytic activity it also exerts an ordering action , transferring information between neighboring uniformly populated patches of the plasma membrane . Diffusion is therefore a second parameter , which strongly influences the system’s dynamic and stationary state . We have considered D values in the range 0 – 5 (cid:1) m 2 (cid:2) s . Order Parameter . Because PTEN localizes on PIP 2 - rich regions of the plasma membrane , phase separation can be observed either at the enzyme or phosphoinositide level . In real cells , phospho - inositide clusters trigger actin polymerization and motility . For this reason we have studied symmetry breaking in phosphoino - sitide distribution . The physics of phase - separation dynamics has been thoroughly studied ( 14 – 18 ) and is known to give rise to a variety of effects such as self - organization , pattern formation , and pattern selection in many physical – chemical systems ( refs . 6 , 19 , and 20 ; for a general reference on pattern formation in reaction – diffusion systems , see ref . 21 ) . The degree of order of a chemical mixture undergoing phase separation can be quan - Table 1 .

A convenient order param - eter measuring the degree of phase separation of the phospho - inositide mixture is Binder’s cumulant ( 9 , 22 ) g (cid:5) 1 2 (cid:7) 3 (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:7) (cid:6)(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:8) 4 (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:7) (cid:6)(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:8) 2 (cid:6) 2 (cid:8) , where (cid:6) (cid:1) (cid:6) i (cid:1) [ PIP 3 ] i (cid:9) [ PIP 2 ] i is a difference of local concentrations on site i , and (cid:5) . . . (cid:6) denotes average over many different random realizations . Binder’s cumulant measures the distance of the probability distribution of (cid:6) from a Gaussian distribution . When phosphoinositides are mixed , fluctuations around the uniform average value are Gaussian , and g tends to zero , whereas when phosphoinositides separate into distinct clusters ( Fig . 1 ) , the probability distribution of (cid:6) is characterized by two distinct peaks , and g becomes of order 1 ( Fig . 1 d and e ) . Maximal observed values of g for phase - separating systems are between 0 . 4 and 0 . 8 , corresponding to the fact that the PIP 2 and PIP 3 distributions partially overlap . Spontaneous phase symmetry breaking leads to the formation of PIP 2 , PIP 3 - rich clusters of different size . Cluster sizes can be characterized by harmonic analysis . For each realization , the fluctuations (cid:7)(cid:6) (cid:1) (cid:6) (cid:9) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:6) of the (cid:6) field can be expanded in spherical harmonics ( 23 ) as (cid:7)(cid:6) ( u ) (cid:1) ¥ l (cid:1) 0 (cid:10) ¥ m (cid:1)(cid:9) l l a lm Y lm ( u ) where u is a unit vector identifying a point on the spherical surface . Let us consider the two - point correlation functions (cid:5) (cid:7)(cid:6) (cid:7) u (cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:6) (cid:7) u (cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:6) iso (cid:5) (cid:4) l (cid:1) 1 (cid:2)(cid:10) C l P l (cid:7) u (cid:1) u (cid:11)(cid:8) , where (cid:5) . . . (cid:6) iso denotes average over ensembles ( 7 ) and over the action of the sphere rotation group , C l (cid:1) 1 4 (cid:8) ¥ m (cid:1)(cid:9) l l (cid:5) (cid:1) a lm (cid:1) 2 (cid:6) , and P l are Legendre polynomials ( 23 ) . A measure of the average cluster size is (cid:8) R (cid:2) 2 (cid:5) l (cid:6) , where (cid:5) l (cid:6) (cid:1) ¥ l (cid:1) 1 (cid:2)(cid:10) C l l . In particular , if most of the weight is concentrated on the l - th harmonic component , average phosphoinositide clusters extend over the characteristic length (cid:8) R (cid:2) 2 l . When receptor activation (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:2) i (cid:1) [ Rec ] i is not uniformly distributed we are interested in its correlation with localized PIP 2 , PIP 3 clusters , which is measured by the components of the covari - ancematrix c (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:5) ( (cid:2) (cid:9)(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:6) ) 2 (cid:6) , c (cid:2)(cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:5) ( (cid:2) (cid:9)(cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:6) ) ( (cid:6) (cid:9)(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:6) ) (cid:6) , c (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:5) ( (cid:6) (cid:9) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:6) ) 2 (cid:6) and by the correlation coefficient r (cid:2)(cid:6) (cid:1) c (cid:2)(cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:12) c (cid:2)(cid:2) c (cid:6)(cid:6) ( 24 ) . Dynamic Phase Diagram . We have run (cid:13) 10 random realizations of the system for (cid:13) 400 ( (cid:2) R , D ) pairs with 1 (cid:1) M (cid:14) (cid:2) (cid:14) 100 (cid:1) M , 0 . 1 (cid:1) m 2 (cid:1) s (cid:9) 1 (cid:14) D (cid:14) 5 (cid:1) m 2 (cid:1) s (cid:9) 1 for 2 h of simulated time [ (cid:13) 1 Tflop ( trillion floating point operations ) per realization ] . For each ( (cid:2) , D ) pair we have computed g as a function of time by performing surface and ensemble average at fixed time intervals . For each randomrealizationwehavestartedfromastationaryhomogeneousPTEN , PIP 2 distribution ( 10 s of simulated time evolution were enough to reach stationarity ) .

Patterns observed at t (cid:1) 2 h are then quite close to stationarity . Similarly , we have measured the harmonic components C l . In this case we have identified the phase - separation time with the moment when the weight of the 10 - min running average of a single harmonic component surpassed the 80 % of the total weight and did not fluctuate below that value for the following 30 min of simulation time . We let the system evolve to stationarity , in the absence of Fig . 1 .

( f – j ) For anisotropic receptor activation , the corresponding data for phosphoinositide concentrations are given in f – i , and the evolution of g and C 1 is given in j . In the presence of activation gradient phase separation is faster and takes place along the gradient direction . Gamba et al .

At time t (cid:1) 0 receptor activation is switched on ; either activated receptors are isotropically distrib - uted or the isotropic distribution is perturbed with a linear term producing a 5 % difference in activated receptor density between the North and the South poles . In the isotropic case , we found that in a wide region of parameter space , the chemical network presents an instability with respect to phase separation ( 25 , 26 ) , i . e . , the homogeneous phosphoinositide mixture realized soon after receptor activation is unstable and tends to decay into spatially separated PIP 2 - and PIP 3 - rich phases ( Fig . 1 a – d ) . Characteristic times for phase separation vary from the order of a minute to that of an hour , depending on receptor activation ( Fig . 1 e ) . The dynamic behav - ior and stationary state of the system strongly depend on the values of two key parameters : the concentration (cid:2) of activated receptors and the diffusivity D . In the case of anisotropic stimulation , orientation of PIP 2 and PIP 3 patches clearly correlates with signal anisotropy ( Fig . 1 g – i ) , and , compared with isotropic stimulation , phase separation takes place in a larger region of parameter space and in times that can be shorter by one order of magnitude ( Fig . 1 j ) . Average phase - separation times are plotted in Fig . 2 a , where red areas correspond to non - phase - separating systems . In the deep blue area , phase separation takes place in (cid:14) 5 min , whereas close to the boundary of the broken symmetry region phase separation can take times of the order of an hour ( Fig . 1 e ) . Average cluster sizes at stationarity are plotted in Fig . 2 b . In the red region , cluster sizes are of the order of the size of the system , corresponding to the formation of pairs of complementary PIP 2 and PIP 3 patches ( Fig . 1 ) . For diffusivities (cid:14) 0 . 1 (cid:1) m 2 (cid:2) s the diffusion - mediated interaction is unable to establish correlations on lengths of the order of the size of the system , and one observes the formation of clusters of separated phases of size much smaller than the size of the system ( Fig . 2 c ) . For diffusivities (cid:15) 2 (cid:1) m 2 (cid:2) s the tendency to phase separation is contrasted by the disordering action of phosphoinositide diffusion ( Fig . 2 a – c ) . Average phase - separation times for the anisotropic case are plotted in Fig . 2 d . By comparing with the isotropic case ( Fig . 2 a ) , it appears that there is a large region of parameter space where phase separation is not observed with isotropic stimulation , while a 5 % anisotropic modulation of activated receptor density triggers a fast phase - separation process . Cluster sizes ( Fig . 2 e ) are in the average larger in the anisotropic case than in the isotropic case ( Fig . 2 a ) . Fig . 2 f shows that the orientation of PIP 2 and PIP 3 patches is strongly correlated with signal anisotropy . Therefore , anisotropy has two main effects : on one hand , it triggers the phase - separation process on shorter timescales and in a wider region of parameter space ; on the other hand , its direction breaks the system’s rotational symmetry and selects the stationary state of the system . For receptor activation (cid:2) (cid:14) 20 nM , the few PI3K enzymes bound to the plasma membrane are not sufficient to create extended PIP 3 - rich regions ; however , small intermittent PIP 3 clusters are still observed ( Fig . 3 a ) . Simulating a gradient in receptor activation similar to the one imposed in experimental assays , we are able ( Fig . 4 ) to reproduce the input – output relationship observed on Dictyostelium ( 4 ) . It is also worth noting that the characteristic timescales for phase separation emerging from our dynamical simulations , which have been performed by using realistic reaction and diffusion rates , are in agreement with the observed ones ( 4 ) .

The frontier between these two regimes varies contin - uously as a function of parameters . Importantly , we found that the overall phase - separation picture is robust with respect to parameter perturbations , because it persists even for concentrations and reaction rates differing from those of Table 2 by one order of magnitude . Moreover , both in isotropic and anisotropic conditions , signal amplification is completely reversible . Switching off receptor activation abolishes phase separation , delocalizes PI3K from the plasma membrane to the cytosol , and brings the system back to the quiescent state ( see Movie 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Thus , phosphoinositide diffusion is directly responsible for establishing correlations between neighboring sites , leading the system to a phase - separation instability . Although large diffu - sivity has a mixing effect , intermediate diffusivity cooperates with catalysis to order the system on large scales . Physically , this process can be understood as follows . Receptor activation shifts the chemical potential for PI3K , which is thus recruited to the plasma membrane . PI3K catalytic activity produces PIP 3 mole - cules from the initial PIP 2 sea . Initially , the two phosphoinositide species are well mixed . Fluctuations in PIP 2 and PIP 3 concen - trations are , however , enhanced by preferential binding of PTEN to its own diffusing phosphoinositide product , PIP 2 . Binding of a PTEN molecule to a cell membrane site induces a localized transformation of PIP 3 into PIP 2 , resulting in higher probability of binding other PTEN molecules at neighboring sites . Such a positive feedback loop not only amplifies the inhibitory PTEN signal , but via phosphoinositide diffusion it also establishes spatiotemporal correlations strong enough to drive the system toward spontaneous phase separation . The time needed by the system to fall into the more stable , phase - separated phase , however , can be a long one if the symmetric , unbroken phase is metastable . In that case , a small anisotropic perturbation in the pattern of receptor activation can be enormously amplified by the system instability . It is worth noting that , when the system phase separates , the final size of the clusters is limited only by the size of the system and the availability of cytosolic enzymes . In an infinite system , clusters would grow indefinitely . In a finite system instead , as long as PTEN molecules are recruited on the PIP 2 patch , they are no longer available to compete with PI3K on the residual PIP 3 patch , which is therefore stabilized . The net effect is that the cluster size saturates at a stationary value of the order of the size of the system . Dimensional considerations suggest that the size of the patches should grow proportionally to (cid:12) D (cid:2) k , 1 (cid:2) k being the characteristic enzyme association – dissociation timescale , for low diffusivity values , and saturate to the size of the system for intermediate diffusivities . Simulations confirm the dimensional estimate and show that for higher diffusivities the species are mixed up and the size of clusters drops abruptly ( Fig . 5 ) . The properties of the real reaction and diffusion processes described in Results and Discussion and Table 1 are better under - stood through the study of a one - dimensional model derived from them under simplifying assumptions ( see Supporting Text and Fig . 6 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , where a more complete analysis is possible . The simplified model presents a parameter region where multiple stable equilibria are possible , and stochasticity in the number of membrane - bound enzymes can trigger a transition from a less stable to a stabler state . The transition takes place through the formation of a small region of the stabler phase in the sea of the less stable one . Although small regions of the stabler phase are wiped off by diffusion , larger regions propagate with finite velocity in the less stable phase and would eventually take over the whole system if the number of available cytosolic enzymes was infinite . Because , however , the number of cytosolic enzymes is limited , the process slows down and eventually stops with the formation of a stationary front separating Fig . 3 .

For small diffusivities the cluster size grows as (cid:12) D and saturates when it reaches the system size ; for higher diffusivities , diffusion mixes up the two phosphoinositide species , and the cluster size drops abruptly ( [ Rec ] (cid:1) 50 nM ) .

The critical size of the nucleating region is determined by the relative strength of two intrinsically dynamic quantities : diffusivity and the velocity of front propagation . Conclusions Our results provide a simple physical clue to the enigmatic behavior observed in eukaryotic cells . As we have shown , there is a large region of parameter space where the cell can be insensitive to uniform stimulation over very large times but responsive to slight anisotropies in receptor activation in times of the order of minutes ( Fig . 1 and Movie 1 ) . Accordingly , by simulating shallow gradients of chemoattractant , we observed PIP 3 patches accumulating with high probability on the side of the plasma membrane with higher concentration of activated receptors , thus resulting into a large amplification of the chemotactic signal ( Figs . 1 and 4 ) . Moreover , we identified an intermediate region of parameters , where phase separation under isotropic stimulation is observed on average in a long but finite time . In this case , one would predict that on long timescales cells undergo spontaneous polarization in random di - rections and that the number of polarized cells grows with time . Intriguingly , this peculiar motile behavior is known as chemokinesis and is observed in cell - motility experiments when cells are exposed to chemoattractants in the absence of a gradient ( 27 ) . An additional consequence of the tendency to phase separation is that for low values of receptor activation small intermittent clusters should form , because diffusion cannot establish a correlation between too - distant phosphoinositide patches and the number of enzymes producing the patches is too low . Indeed , intermittent phospho - inositideclustersareobservedinoursimulations ( Fig . 3 a ) , andtheir formation has been recently described in Dictyostelium cells ex - posed to very low cAMP concentrations ( 28 ) . It appears that D3 - phosphoinositide patches serve as a spatial cue for pseudopod formation , which enhances the sensitivity and amplitude of che - motactic movement . Furthermore , cells migrating within tissues , such as neurons or immune system cells , may encounter multiple chemoattractant signals in complex spatial and temporal patterns that can potentially direct their path . Notably , cell polarization induced by multiple chemoattractant sources has been observed in vitro ( 4 ) , and this experimental situation can be mimicked in silico by simulating the receptor activation pattern produced by multiple chemoattractant sources ( Fig . 3 b ) . Insummary , thephase - separationscenarioprovidesasimple and unified framework to different aspects of directed cell motility , such as large amplification of slight signal anisotropies , insensitivity to uniform stimulation , appearance of isolated and transient phos - phoinositide patches , and stochastic cell polarization . It provides a link between known microscopic and macroscopic timescales . Fi - nally , it unifies apparently conflicting aspects that previous mod - eling efforts ( 29 , 30 ) could not satisfactorily reconcile ( 31 ) , such as insensitivity to absolute stimulation values , large amplification of shallow chemotactic gradients , reversibility of phase separation , robustness with respect to parameter perturbations , stochastic character of cell response , use of realistic biochemical parameters , and space – time scales . One of the characteristic features of our model is that it brings together into a unified picture several seemingly disconnected phenomena , such as response to anisotropic chemotactic stim - ulation , stochastic polarization , and small cluster formation for low activation levels . It would be useful to perform systematic quantitative observations on stochastic cell polarization under uniform stimulating conditions , both at high and low activation leves . Because nucleation can be arguably modeled as a Poisson process , in the presence of isotropic stimulation one should observe a number of stochastically polarized cells growing with time , with a rate comparable with the model predictions .
