Interactions between ligands and receptors are central to com - munication between cells and tissues . Human airway epithelia constitutively produce both a ligand , the growth factor heregulin , and its receptors—erbB2 , erbB3 and erbB4 ( refs 1 – 3 ) . Although heregulin binding initiates cellular proliferation and differen - tiation 4 – 7 , airway epithelia have a low rate of cell division 8 . This raises the question of how ligand – receptor interactions are controlled in epithelia . Here we show that in differentiated human airway epithelia , heregulin - a is present exclusively in the apical membrane and the overlying airway surface liquid , physically separated from erbB2 – 4 , which segregate to the basolateral membrane . This physical arrangement creates a ligand – receptor pair poised for activation whenever epithelial integrity is disrupted . Indeed , immediately following a mech - anical injury , heregulin - a activates erbB2 in cells at the edge of the wound , and this process hastens restoration of epithelial integrity . Likewise , when epithelial cells are not separated into apical and basolateral membranes ( ‘polarized’ ) , or when tight junctions between adjacent cells are opened , heregulin - a acti - vates its receptor . This mechanism of ligand – receptor segre - gation on either side of epithelial tight junctions may be vital for rapid restoration of integrity following injury , and hence critical for survival . This model also suggests a mechanism for abnor - mal receptor activation in diseases with increased epithelial permeability . The erbB receptors belong to the type I family of tyrosine kinase receptors whose members include erbB1 – 4 ( also called EGFR / HER1 and HER2 - 4 , respectively ) 4 , 5 . Many gene products , including here - gulin , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , epiregulin , betacellulin , amphiregulin , TGF - a and epigen serve as ligands for this family of receptors 4 – 7 . For example , heregulin binds erbB3 and erbB4 . Ligand binding stimulates receptor dimerization , often with erbB2 as one member of the heterodimer . The resulting phosphorylation of erbB cytoplasmic domains activates signal transduction cascades , leading to cellular proliferation and differentiation 4 – 7 . Because air - letters to nature NATURE | VOL 422 | 20 MARCH 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 322 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup way epithelia simultaneously express both a ligand , heregulin , and its receptor without manifesting the consequences of receptor activation , we asked how the epithelium controls ligand – receptor interactions . Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT – PCR ; Fig . 1a ) , microarray analysis ( not shown ) , and western blot analysis ( Fig . 1b ) showed that well differentiated human airway epithelia expressed heregulin - a but neither heregulin - b nor EGF . They also expressed the receptors erbB1 – 4 . We localized the proteins by immunocytochemistry ; Fig . 2a shows an x – z confocal section of the pseudostratiﬁed epithelium . Heregulin - a ( red ) was localized at the apical membrane ; some intracellular protein was also observed . The immunostained protein probably represents both membrane - bound pro - heregulin - a and intracellular processed forms . In con - trast , erbB2 ( green ) was present only in the basolateral membrane ( Fig . 2a ) ; surface biotinylation conﬁrmed the exclusive basolateral localization of this receptor ( Fig . 2i ) . The physical segregation of heregulin - a and erbB2 was readily appreciated from x – y sections ( Fig . 2b , c ) taken at the positions indicated in Fig . 2a . We observed a similar staining pattern for erbB1 , erbB3 and erbB4 ( Fig . 2d – f ) , but consistent with the western blot analysis , there was no heregulin - b or EGF staining ( not shown ) . A thin ﬁlm of airway surface liquid ( ASL ) covers the apical membrane of differentiated epithelia cultured at the air – liquid interface . We found heregulin - a in ASL , but not in basolateral medium ( Fig . 2g ) . These results are consistent with the immuno - cytochemical localization , and indicate that heregulin - a , which is synthesized as a transmembrane protein and cleaved to generate a soluble ligand , is released selectively from the apical surface into the ASL . We also found heregulin - a in bronchoalveolar lavage liquid ( Fig . 2g ) , conﬁrming the presence of ligand in ASL in vivo . Thus , heregulin - a and its receptors are segregated to opposite sides of the epithelium . These results are consistent with the ﬁnding that human proEGF expressed in MDCK cells was present predominantly at the apical membrane , whereas erbB1 was localized on the basolateral surface 9 . On the basis of these ﬁndings , we reasoned that adding heregulin - a directly to the basolateral surface would activate erbB2 . Because the ﬁrst step following ligand binding is receptor phosphoryl - ation 4 , 6 , we examined receptor activation by using an antibody speciﬁc to phosphorylated erbB2 . As predicted , adding heregulin - a to the basolateral surface phosphorylated erbB2 ( Fig . 2h ) . In contrast , addition of apical heregulin - a had no effect on receptor phosphorylation . To determine whether tight junctions segregated the ligand from its receptor , we opened the junctions by Ca 2 (cid:135) chelation ; once the junctions were permeabilized , apically added heregulin - a phosphorylated erb2 ( Fig . 2h ) . In the absence of apically added heregulin - a , Ca 2 (cid:135) chelation alone did not lead to erbB2 phosphorylation ( Fig . 2h ) . As expected , phosphorylation of erbB3 occurred under the same conditions ( Fig . 2j ) . These func - tional data complement the biochemical and immunocytochemical data and indicate that tight junctions segregate ASL heregulin - a from its receptors erbB2 – 4 on the basolateral surface . This physical arrangement creates a ligand – receptor system poised for activation whenever epithelial integrity is compromised . To test this concept , we mechanically injured epithelia .

We examined the role of heregulin - a and erbB2 – 4 in the repair process by measuring transepithelial electrical conductance ( G t ) . Intact epithelia maintained a low G t over time ( Fig . 3c ) . Following the injury , G t increased abruptly , remained elevated for 12 – 18 h , and then slowly recovered to basal values by , 24 h . Application of recombinant heregulin - a accelerated repair ( Fig . 3d ) . Conversely , application of an antibody that blocks the erbB2 receptor ( hercep - tin ) signiﬁcantly slowed G t recovery . Western blot analysis con - ﬁrmed erbB2 phosphorylation 5 min following wounding ( Fig . 3b ) . Thus , heregulin - a and erbB2 – 4 contributed to repair of human airway epithelia following a mechanical wound . These data suggest that the injury allowed ASL heregulin - a to activate its basolateral receptor . We also tested the contribution of heregulin - a and erbB receptors to wound repair using human tracheal explants bathed with medium containing ASL . Following a mechanical injury , the wound healed over in , 18 h ( Fig . 3f ) . Blocking ligand with a neutralizing heregulin - a antibody or blocking erbB2 with herceptin inhibited wound repair ( Fig . 3e , f ) . To further test receptor activation , we used immunocytochem - istry with an antibody speciﬁc for the phosphorylated form of erbB2 . Within 1 min after wounding , receptors were activated ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Antibody staining was present only at the edge of the wound , consistent with a localized effect of heregulin - a derived from the overlying ASL . In contrast , we saw diffuse phospho - erbB2 staining when we applied heregulin - a basolaterally or when we applied it apically and disrupted the tight junctions by Ca 2 (cid:135) chelation ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Calcium chelation in the absence of apical heregulin - a did not lead to erbB2 phosphorylation ( Fig . 4e ) . Following mechanical injury , ASL growth factors other than heregulin - a might also activate erbB2 . To test this possibility , we added a neutralizing anti - heregulin - a antibody to the apical surface before mechanical injury . Neutralizing ASL heregulin - a eliminated erbB2 activation at the edge of the wound ( Fig . 4g ) , whereas phosphorylated erbB2 was evident in control epithelia and epithelia treated with non - immune antibody ( Fig . 4f , h ) . These results support our biochemical and immunolocalization data . They also emphasize the importance of ASL heregulin - a in activating baso - lateral erbB growth factor receptors . Of course , these data do not exclude a role for ligands such as EGF that can be produced in the basolateral compartment by ﬁbroblasts . We also tested segregation of ASL ligand from basolateral receptor using intact rat trachea . We isolated tracheae , removed ASL by washing the lumen , closed both ends , and placed them in an EGTA - containing solution to open the tight junctions . When transepithelial conductances increased , we isolated the epithelial cells , immunoprecipitated erbB2 , and probed the blot with an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody . erbB2 was phosphorylated when ASL was present , but phosphorylation was minimal when ASL had been washed away ( Fig . 4i ) . We also mechanically wounded the trachea in anaesthetized rats and then immediately removed epithelial cells . Figure 4j shows that wounding led to erbB2 phosphorylation . The physical segregation of a ligand to the apical solution and its receptor to the basolateral membrane provides a simple system that is primed for activation the instant epithelial integrity is compro - mised ( see Supplementary Information ) . Such a design could be central to rapid restoration of barrier function and protection of the organism following a mechanical or toxic wound that disrupts the epithelium . Our ﬁndings also suggest models in which other ASL factors might activate speciﬁc basolateral receptors , and conversely , basolateral ligands might access apical receptors when tight - junc - tion integrity is compromised . Finally , this model could apply to any epithelial barrier . This ligand – receptor arrangement may also be critical in other physiological and pathophysiological situations ( see Supplementary Information ) . For example , during development unpolarized cells might secrete ligands that target receptors on their own surface or that of adjacent cells . Differentiation and the development of tight junctions could segregate the ligand from its receptor , thereby silencing a signalling cascade . To test this idea , we studied airway cells 4 h after seeding , before they polarized and formed an epi - thelium ( Fig . 4k – m ) . These cells did not segregate heregulin - a and erbB2—they were expressed over the cell surface—and the receptor was phosphorylated . In this experiment , the immunostained here - gulin - a probably represents the unprocessed , cell surface form , which has been demonstrated to bind and activate erbB receptors 10 . Once tight junctions formed , ligand and receptor were segregated and receptor activation was silenced ( Fig . 2h , and area away from the wound in Fig . 4b , f , h ) . This process could be important in mucosal cancers , where a loss of epithelial polarity , mislocalization of a growth factor receptor , or altered polarized sorting could continuously expose receptors to ligand , thereby stimulating pro - liferation 6 , 11 – 13 . This model also predicts that increased paracellular permeability , without complete epithelial disruption , would allow ligand to access its receptor . Consistent with this , Ca 2 (cid:135) chelation increased para - cellular permeability , allowing ASL heregulin - a to access its recep - tor and phosphorylate erbB2 ( Fig . 4d , i ) .

To test the physiological consequences of chronic receptor stimulation with one ASL component , we applied heregulin - a to the basolateral medium for 10 d and found a thickening of the epithelium ( Fig . 4n , o ) , indicating epithelial remodelling . We speculate that increased epithelial permeability and the resulting chronic receptor activation contribute to the remodelling that is a hallmark of those diseases . A Methods Cell culture Human airway epithelia from lungs removed for organ donation were isolated and cultured at the air – liquid interface as described previously 18 . Epithelia were studied at least 2 weeks after seeding , when they had differentiated and developed a ciliated apical surface . Immunocytochemistry and microscopy Epithelia were immunostained as previously described 19 . Cultures were counter - stained with ethidium bromide , mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting media ( VectorLabs ) andstudiedusingconfocalmicroscopy ( MRC - 1024 ; Bio - RadLaboratories ) .

The erbB2 blocking antibody ( herceptin , Genentech ) was used at 3 . 2 m M in primary cultures and at 1mM in human tracheal explants . Heregulin - a neutralizing antibody ( R & D Systems ) was used at 100 m gml 2 1 for cultures , 0 . 3 m M for explants .

To generate different cell types , some cells can segregate protein determinants into one of their two daughter cells during mitosis . In Drosophila neuroblasts , the Par protein complex localizes apically 1 – 5 and directs localization of the cell fate determinants Prospero 6 – 8 and Numb 9 and the adaptor proteins Miranda 10 , 11 and Pon 12 to the basal cell cortex , to ensure their segregation into the basal daughter cell . The Par protein complex has a conserved function in establishing cell polarity 13 but how it directs proteins to the opposite side is unknown . We show here that a principal function of this complex is to phosphorylate the cytoskeletal protein Lethal ( 2 ) giant larvae ( Lgl ; also known as L ( 2 ) gl ) . Phosphorylation by Drosophila atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) , a member of the Par protein complex , releases Lgl from its association with membranes and the actin cytoskeleton . Genetic and biochemical experiments show that Lgl phosphoryl - ation prevents the localization of cell fate determinants to the apical cell cortex . Lgl promotes cortical localization of Miranda 14 , 15 , and we propose that phosphorylation of Lgl by aPKC at the apical neuroblast cortex restricts Lgl activity and Miranda localization to the opposite , basal side of the cell . The Drosophila Par protein complex consists of aPKC 5 and the conserved PDZ domain proteins Bazooka ( Par - 3 ) 1 – 3 and Par - 6 ( ref . 4 ) . Apical Par proteins direct localization of determinants to the opposite , basal cortex ( Fig . 1a ) . To identify additional complex members that might be required for basal protein localization , proteins that immunoprecipitated together with Par - 6 from Drosophila embryos were microsequenced by mass spectroscopy ( Fig . 1b ) . Two protein bands with relative molecular masses of approximately 66 , 000 and 120 , 000 ( M r 66K and 120K , respectively ) were identiﬁed as aPKC and Lgl , respectively . Lgl was not known to be part of the Par protein complex , and to verify its interaction we generated anti - Lgl antibodies and used them in immunoprecipita - tions . Anti - Lgl speciﬁcally co - immunoprecipitates aPKC and Par - 6 ( Fig . 1c ) . Conversely , both aPKC and Lgl can be detected in western blots of Par - 6 immunoprecipitations ( Fig . 1d ) . When the Par complex is afﬁnity puriﬁed from embryos on glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – Par - 6 beads , both aPKC and Lgl can be detected ( Fig . 1e ) . When the complex is puriﬁed on maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) – Bazooka beads , however , Par - 6 and aPKC are still detected but Lgl is not present ( Fig . 1f ) , indicating that Bazooka and Lgl might be mutually exclusive members of the aPKC – Par - 6 complex . To determine how Lgl is recruited into the Par protein complex , we performed in vitro binding experiments ( see Fig . 1g ) . Lgl contains four WD40 repeats ( Fig . 1g , red ) . Par - 6 has a conserved amino - terminal domain ( green ) , a CRIB domain ( blue ) and a PDZ domain ( red ) . In vitro translated Lgl and aPKC bind GST – Par - 6 but not GST alone ( Fig . 1h ) . Par - 6 lacking 121 amino acids of the conserved N terminus no longer binds aPKC ( Fig . 1h , D 1 ) . In contrast , the carboxy - terminal PDZ domain of Par - 6 ( residues 146 – 280 ) is required ( Fig . 1h , D 3 ) and sufﬁcient ( Fig . 1h , PDZ ) for binding to Lgl . A deletion analysis of Lgl ( Fig . 1i , j ) shows that both the N terminus and the central part ( Fig . 1j ) but not the C terminus of the protein can bind Par - 6 . Lgl is required for asymmetric cell division 14 , 15 : in lgl mutant letters to nature NATURE | VOL 422 | 20 MARCH 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 326 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup
