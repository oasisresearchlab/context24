Webb , December 26 , 2006 ( sent for review September 21 , 2006 ) The membrane raft hypothesis postulates the existence of lipid bilayer membrane heterogeneities , or domains , supposed to be important for cellular function , including lateral sorting , signaling , and trafﬁcking . Characterization of membrane lipid heterogene - ities in live cells has been challenging in part because inhomoge - neity has not usually been deﬁnable by optical microscopy . Model membrane systems , including giant unilamellar vesicles , allow optical ﬂuorescence discrimination of coexisting lipid phase types , but thus far have focused on coexisting optically resolvable ﬂuid phases in simple lipid mixtures . Here we demonstrate that giant plasma membrane vesicles ( GPMVs ) or blebs formed from the plasma membranes of cultured mammalian cells can also segregate into micrometer - scale ﬂuid phase domains . Phase segregation temperatures are widely spread , with the vast majority of GPMVs found to form optically resolvable domains only at temperatures below (cid:1) 25°C . At 37°C , these GPMV membranes are almost exclu - sively optically homogenous . At room temperature , we ﬁnd diag - nostic lipid phase ﬂuorophore partitioning preferences in GPMVs analogous to the partitioning behavior now established in model membrane systems with liquid - ordered and liquid - disordered ﬂuid phase coexistence . We image these GPMVs for direct visual char - acterization of protein partitioning between coexisting liquid - ordered - like and liquid - disordered - like membrane phases in the absence of detergent perturbation . For example , we ﬁnd that the transmembrane IgE receptor Fc (cid:1) RI preferentially segregates into liquid - disordered - like phases , and we report the partitioning of additional well known membrane associated proteins . Thus , GPMVs now provide an effective approach to characterize biolog - ical membrane heterogeneities . liquid - disordered (cid:1) liquid - ordered (cid:1) membrane domains (cid:1) membrane heterogeneity (cid:1) rafts T he membrane raft hypothesis proposes that membrane lipid domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids form dynamic sorting and signaling platforms for membrane proteins ( 1 ) . Consensus data on the size , lifetime , and even existence of lipid rafts in intact plasma membranes , however , have been elusive ( 2 , 3 ) . Controversy arises due to current experimental ambiguity and to operational definitions of membrane lipid heterogeneity . One common definition has relied on biochemical assessment of membrane heterogeneity involving membrane lysis using certain nonionic detergents , such as Triton X - 100 at 4°C ( 4 ) . A second , operational definition for lipid rafts has been cellular processes that are perturbed by either cholesterol or sphingo - myelin depletion . Problems of these approaches have been extensively discussed ( 2 , 3 ) . The reports that membranes composed of lipids that are resistant to detergent solubilization are apparently in a liquid - ordered ( L o ) state ( 5 – 7 ) have been the basis for proposing that lipid rafts in plasma membranes represent the L o phase of coexisting L o and liquid - disordered ( L d ) fluid / fluid phases ( 2 , 8 ) . Biological membrane heterogeneity , however , cannot be re - duced to partitioning between coexisting lipid domains , because reciprocal protein – lipid , as well as protein – protein interactions necessarily modulate the thermodynamics of lipid heterogeneity ( 2 , 9 , 10 ) , emphasizing the need for examining membranes with significant protein content , as suggested by protein segregation measurements on living cells ( 11 ) . Several studies have suggested the existence of membrane heterogeneities with size scales below optical resolution ( (cid:1) 300 nanometers ) , but estimates of lipid raft sizes in the literature range from several micrometers , as in cholesterol - depleted cells ( 12 ) , to just a few molecules ( 13 ) . Fluid / fluid phase separation in biological cell membranes has thus far not been unequivocally demonstrated in live cells , perhaps because coupling of the plasma membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton may prevent fluid phase segregation into distinctive domains , as can be observed in lipid - only model membranes with appropriate com - positions . Differences from model membranes could arise from the pinning of plasma membrane domains by cytoskeleton - attached , membrane - associated proteins or from complex mem - brane rugosities induced by protein – protein interactions . Fur - thermore , the enormous complexity of cellular plasma membrane protein and lipid compositions might preclude the simple fluid / fluid phase separations observed in ternary lipid mixtures ( 14 ) . To investigate fluid / fluid phase coexistence in systems with realistic biological membrane compositions , we here use giant plasma membrane vesicles ( GPMVs ) that are derived from biological cells , RBL mast cells , and fibroblasts by chemically induced plasma membrane vesiculation or ‘‘blebbing’’ ( 15 – 17 ) . These GPMVs show simple , low - curvature geometries of giant unilamellar vesicles and appear free of cytoskeletal constraints . By using fluorophores providing recently characterized mem - brane fluid phase partitioning behavior ( T . B . , G . Hunt , E . R . Farkas , W . W . W . , and G . W . Feigenson , unpublished data ) for lipid phase characterization here , we find that these GPMVs can segregate into multi - micrometer - scale coexisting fluid phases , thereby enabling extension of early cell blebbing studies in our laboratories in the 1980s ( 15 , 18 – 20 ) . These results are noted and used throughout this paper .

Fig . 1 illustrates typical fluorescence - labeled cell - attached GPMVs imaged by stacks of laser scanning confocal microscopy ( CM ) or two - photon microscopy sections . The GPMV in Fig . 1 A was induced by addition of 4 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol to suspended RBL cells , and GPMV in Fig . 1 B was induced by addition of DMSO ( 1 % vol / vol ) to adherent fibro - blasts . Under these conditions , substantial membrane dye is rapidly internalized , delivering fluorescence to the cell body , as illustrated in Fig . 1 A , C , and D . These GPMVs , having dimen - sions comparable to cell sizes , occur in low fractions ( (cid:2) 5 % ) of treated cells and are possibly induced by transient , local high solvent concentration during solvent injections into the sur - rounding buffer . The cell - attached GPMV on an RBL cell in Fig . 1 A was prelabeled by the plasma membrane inner - leaflet - targeted protein , geranylgeranyl - EGFP ( 21 ) , and it shows a homogenous membrane bilayer at optical resolution when im - aged at room temperature . Fig . 1 B shows a lipid phase - separated GPMV from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts labeled with lissamine rhoda - mine B sulfonyl dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine ( R - DOPE ) to demonstrate that plasma membrane fluid / fluid phase sepa - ration at room temperature is not a unique property of GPMVs obtained from RBL mast cells . At temperatures of 4 – 10°C , cell - attached GPMV membranes often separate into two distinct phases , as shown by the con - trasting fluorescence patterns of naphthopyrene ( Nap ) in Fig . 1 C and R - DOPE in Fig . 1 D . That these coexisting domains are in fluid phase states at 4°C is indicated by frequent coalescence activity and circular morphology . The fluid phase separations shown in Fig . 1 C and D , as well as all other phase - separated GPMVs examined here , show only two different fluorescence intensities , suggesting that the lipid domains are coupled across the bilayer , as previously observed for inner - and outer - leaflet - labeled domain registration in phase - separated model mem - brane giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( 22 ) . Nap preferentially labels the L o phase in model membranes containing ternary lipid mixtures of brain sphingomyelin , dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine , and cholesterol , whereas R - DOPE strongly prefers L d membranes coexisting with L o domains over wide ranges of differing lipid compositions ( T . B . , G . Hunt , E . R . Farkas , W . W . W . , and G . W . Feigenson , unpublished data ) . Thus , GPMVs from RBL cells appear to phase - separate into coexisting fluid membrane phases with L o - like and L d - like phase states . Because membrane phase behavior is likely to be modified in the presence of organic solvents , we also developed alternative protocols for GPMV formation and membrane staining . Membrane blebbing induced by chemical methods that modify amino and sulfhydryl groups ( 15 , 17 , 23 ) allows isolating large numbers of GPMVs from adhering cells for characterization ( 15 , 24 ) . GPMVs isolated after treatment of RBL mast cells with 25 mM formaldehyde , together with 2 mM DTT , or by treatment with 2 mM N - ethylmaleimide for 1 h at 37°C phase separate in a temperature - dependent manner . Representative low - magnification views of cell - free GPMVs isolated after formal - dehyde / DTT treatment and labeled with the L d phase - preferring fluorescent phospholipid R - DOPE were imaged at three differ - ent temperatures [ supporting information ( SI ) Fig . 4 ] . At 5°C , essentially all vesicles phase separate ( SI Fig . 4 A ) , but at room temperature only (cid:1) 10 – 25 % of all vesicles show large - scale fluid / fluid phase coexistence ( SI Fig . 4 B ) . At 37°C , fluid phase coexistence is rare : (cid:2) 1 % of all imaged GPMVs show optically resolvable domains . One of these exceptional cases is depicted in SI Fig . 4 C Inset . The large variation in phase separation observed in different vesicles , especially at intermediate temperatures , may indicate compositional variations among GPMVs in these preparations . Fig . 2 compares the fluid - phase partitioning behavior of several lipid analogues ( Nap , R - DOPE , and DiI C16 : 0 ) and lipid - binding proteins [ cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ) and annexin V ] in cell - free GPMVs imaged at room temperature ( Fig . 2 A – C ) and at 12°C ( Fig . 2 D ) . Nap and R - DOPE show contrasting partitioning in coexisting fluid phases , both at room temperature as shown in Fig . 2 A and at 5°C ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . Fig . 2 B shows that CTB bound to the ganglioside GM 1 partitions into membrane regions complementary to those labeled with L d - preferring R - DOPE . CTB is frequently used as a marker for cellular lipid rafts and caveolae based on sucrose gradient fractionation experiments ( 25 ) , and GUV model membrane studies have shown that fluorescent CTB bound to GM 1 pref - erentially labels L o phases that are coexisting with L d phases ( 26 , 27 ) . Partitioning of CTB bound to GM 1 , in contrast to DiI C16 : 0 , indicates that DiI preferentially partitions into the L d - like phase ( Fig . 2 C ) . Although DiI C16 : 0 is deemed a marker for lipid rafts on cells ( 12 , 28 , 29 ) , it has been observed to partition preferen - tially into L d phases in selected ternary mixtures of brain sphingomyelin / dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine / cholesterol and in mixtures of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine / dioleoyl phosphati - dylcholine / cholesterol ( data not shown ) . We compared the partitioning of CTB bound to GM 1 with fluorescent annexin V , which binds phosphatidylserine ( PS ) in a calcium - dependent manner ( 30 ) . Annexin V is an indicator of transbilayer flipping of the negatively charged PS that is a hallmark of cellular apoptosis ( 31 ) . In phase - separated GPMVs , annexin V labeling is in contrast to L o - like domains that are preferentially labeled with fluorescent CTB ( Fig . 2 D ) . This indicates that PS , and possibly other negatively charged phos - pholipids , partition preferentially into more disordered regions of these GPMVs . Noting that phase separation in vesicles labeled with fluorescent CTB and annexin V derivatives is similar to lipid - bound fluorophores ( R - DOPE , DiIC16 : 0 , and Nap ) ex - cludes the possibility that the fluid phase segregation we detect is due to membrane insertion of fluorescent lipids or to photo - decomposition products of membrane - embedded fluorophores .

Photoinduced lipid oxidation , which can interfere with mem - brane phase behavior ( 32 ) , was minimized by the antioxidant DTT . As seen by CM , soluble fluorescently labeled proteins , such as CTB and annexin V , are mostly excluded from the interior of GPMVs , suggesting that their membranes are sufficiently sealed to prevent internalization of protein - sized solutes . However , some GPMVs are slightly leaky to these proteins , as judged by the occasional observation of slow internal labeling of GPMVs ( data not shown ) . Nevertheless , determining whether fluores - cent annexin V on GPMVs is labeling phosphatidylserine flipped to the outer leaflet or on the inner leaflet of these GPMVs is uncertain . Earlier experiments on formaldehyde induced plasma membrane vesicles of neuroblastoma cells indicated partial retention of lipid asymmetry for as long as 3 days after blebbing at 37°C for 1 . 5 – 2 h and subsequent storage at 4°C ( 33 ) , suggesting that GPMVs may retain significant leaflet asymmetry during our imaging , but it remains for future studies to determine the extent of lipid asymmetry preservation in GPMVs . An advantage of GPMVs is that membrane protein partition - ing can be reliably studied by optical microscopy in vesicles with clearly identified fluid / fluid phase coexistence . Fig . 3 demon - strates selective partitioning of lipid - anchored proteins from outer and inner leaflets of cellular plasma membranes , as well as partitioning of a transmembrane protein complex . Glycosylphos - phatidylinositol - anchored proteins , including Thy - 1 , are com - mon markers for outer leaflets of lipid rafts , based on detergent fractionation , ( 34 , 35 ) , intact cell membrane ( 36 , 37 ) , and model membrane studies ( 38 ) . Fig . 3 A shows Thy - 1 labeled with Cy3 - conjugated Ox7 mAb partitioning preferentially into the L o - like phase in GPMVs with fluid / fluid phase coexistence . In contrast , several lipid - anchored proteins that localize to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane were found to partition preferentially into the L d - like phase . Fig . 3 B shows that Lyn - GFP , which reconstitutes Fc (cid:2) RI - mediated signaling ( 39 , 40 ) , partitions preferentially into the L d phase of GPMVs . However , several sucrose gradient analysis studies had suggested that Lyn itself preferentially associates with ‘‘lipid rafts’’ under a variety of cell lysis conditions ( 39 , 41 , 42 ) . Similarly , the GFP chimera PM - GFP , which is anchored to the plasma membrane inner leaflet by myristate and palmitate acyl chains attached to the first 20 amino acid residues of Lyn ( 21 ) , preferentially partitions into the L d - like phase in GPMVs ( Fig . 3 C ) , and a geranylgeranyl - anchored chimera of GFP ( 21 ) similarly partitions into L d - like phases ( Fig . 3 D ) . Sucrose gra - dient fractionation of detergent - lysed cells suggests that the GFP module enhances L d partitioning ( 39 ) . However , the strong L d partitioning observed with these inner - leaflet lipid - anchored proteins in GPMVs represents a significant quantitative differ - ence from detergent fractionation predictions . We find that A488 - labeled IgE bound to Fc (cid:2) RI strongly partitions into the L d - like phase of GPMVs , as shown in Fig . 3 E . These results are consistent with those obtained from sucrose gradient analysis of TX - 100 - lysed RBL cells over a large range of detergent concentrations ( 41 , 43 , 44 ) . Cross - linking of this IgE - receptor complex has been shown to substantially increase its partitioning into detergent - resistant lipid rafts ( 41 ) , and it will be interesting to investigate the effects of Fc (cid:2) RI cross - linking on its phase partitioning in GPMVs . Fig . 3 F shows that the FITC - conjugated lectin , Con A , which binds to a large number of (cid:3) - methyl mannoside - containing glycoproteins and glycolipids , preferentially partitions into the L d - like phase as well , as evidenced by colabeling with R - DOPE . Comparison of the fluorescence intensity of FITC - Con A label - ing of two GPMVs attached to a cell in Fig . 3 G shows that the glycoproteins and glycolipids that segregate into the emerging GPMVs represent a substantial fraction of the Con A binding sites on the cell surface . However , quantitative estimation of bleb protein content versus cellular membrane protein content is uncertain because of the highly folded nature of the cellular membrane , compared with the smooth bleb membranes . GUV model membranes enable examination of mechanical aspects of membranes with fluid / fluid phase coexistence , in - cluding curvature coupling to membrane phase patterns and line tension at phase boundaries ( 14 , 45 – 47 ) , as well as experimental tests of mechanical membrane theories ( 14 , 48 ) . GUVs with L o / L d phase coexistence and relatively monodisperse domain sizes show hexagonal arrays of phase domains in superstructures that are reminiscent of modulated phase separation patterns observed in many other physical systems ( 49 ) . SI Fig . 5 A illustrates the hexagonally modulated phase patterns that also are occasionally observed in GPMVs . Modulated phase patterns can be stabilized by competing short - range attractive and long - range repulsive forces , and model membrane systems have indicated compositional variations arising from short - range at - tractions that couple to membrane curvature modulations , pos - sibly leading to long - range repulsion ( 14 , 49 ) . These modulated patterns are likely to be kinetically trapped nonequilibrium structures subject to domain coalescence and possibly other coarsening mechanisms ( 50 ) due to line tension at phase bound - aries typically leading to complete phase separation after long observation times .

PNAS (cid:1) February 27 , 2007 (cid:1) vol . 104 (cid:1) no . 9 (cid:1) 3167 B I O P H Y S I C S Although domains of our phase - separated GPMVs show small curvature gradients , i . e . , the membrane geometries approach circular domains on a smooth sphere , a notable exception is GPMVs with small domains that are labeled with CTB , as seen in Fig . 2 B and SI Fig . 5 B . Upon cholera toxin binding , preexisting L o - like domains develop significant inward curvature . Interest - ingly , internalization of CTB bound to GM 1 occurs in cells in a cholesterol - dependent fashion ( 51 ) , and it is possible that CTB promotes internalization by inducing a spontaneous inward curvature that facilitates budding and fission . Similar inward curvature is occasionally observed for CTB - labeled L o domains in GUV model membranes ( A . T . H . , unpublished data ) . Occasionally , phase - separated GPMVs show domain shapes fluctuating via in - plane domain boundary undulations . SI Fig . 5 C shows sequential images of a vesicle at 23°C with domain undulations . These two - dimensional undulations also are ob - served in GUV model membranes with fluid / fluid phase coex - istence near mixing / demixing transition temperatures , where line tension can become relatively small ( 14 , 45 ) . These undu - lations further highlight the presence of fluid / fluid phase coex - istence in GPMVs . Fluid phase coexistence also is supported by fast recovery of spot photobleaching of all labeled lipids and membrane proteins examined here ( data not shown ) . Discussion Plasma membrane vesicles , commonly called blebs , are naturally formed in a variety of physiological processes that include blebbing in locomoting cells , in cells undergoing mitosis , and in apoptotic cells . Bleb formation can be artificially induced by a variety of methods ( 52 ) , including our addition of solvents or sulfhydryl group - blocking reagents . Depending on the method , different types of blebs can be obtained ( 52 , 53 ) . Ours were formed through cell swelling and blebbing , as in oncosis ( 53 ) . These blebs have been shown to be free of cellular organelles , with lipid compositions representative of the plasma membrane , with phospholipid / cholesterol ratios of (cid:1) 2 : 1 ( 6 , 16 , 24 ) . Our GPMVs from RBL cells contain constitutively active tyrosine kinase Lyn ( N . Smith , D . A . H . , and B . A . B . , unpublished data ) . A possible question is the cellular source of GPMV mem - branes , considering the apparent increased plasma membrane area during blebbing ( see Figs . 1 and 3 G ) . Membrane capaci - tance measurements via patch - clamping of mast cells have revealed that osmotic inflation of cells by approximately 4 times the resting volume did not change membrane conductance and only caused small reversible changes of total cell membrane capacitance ( 54 ) . These results combined with the finding of exocytosis inhibition by inflation ( 54 ) suggest that GPMV mem - branes are likely to accrue from excess membrane area stored in membrane microvilli and various protrusions including coated pits , lamellipodia , and ruffles , but more direct comparisons are needed . The overall protein content of GPMVs must influence membrane phase behavior . GPMVs from RBL cells have been reported to contain (cid:1) 20 – 25 % of the cellular IgE - receptor complexes ( 15 ) , roughly comparable with the apparent frac - tion of cellular plasma membrane extruded as GPMV . This conclusion is supported by abundant Con A labeling via their glycosylated protein binding sites retained in cell - attached GPMVs ( Fig . 3 G ) and by recent ESR measurements that provided evidence for similar phase coexistence behavior in GPMV and in living cell plasma membranes ( 55 ) . Earlier IgE - receptor diffusion measurements have indicated signifi - cant mobility increase due to observed reductions of molecular crowding relative to cell membranes on hypertonically swollen cells and chemically induced membrane blebs ( 56 , 57 ) . Exten - sive experiments will be required to establish the important relations between membrane phases and protein contents . We find that the F - actin probe Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin does Fig . 3 . GPMVs reveal membrane protein phase preferences in detergent - free GPMVs .

This uncoupling from the cortex is likely to be critical for the observed membrane phase separations . Polyphosphoinositide lipids ( 24 , 58 ) and cytoskeletally immobilized proteins may be excluded from GPMVs ( 59 , 60 ) , a future question that needs to be addressed . Important results of this study are the defined mixing / demixing transition temperatures in the protein - containing membranes of individual GPMVs . The significant temperature dependence of plasma membrane phase behavior also has been demonstrated recently by photobleaching recovery mea - surements ( 61 ) . We find that individual vesicles show large variations in transition temperatures , with the vast majority of vesicles undergoing phase separations only at temperatures between (cid:1) 10°C and 25°C . These low - temperature phase sep - arations are defined by the coexistence of two fluid membrane phases with sharp phase boundaries at optical resolution . Two distinct fluid phases do form despite the complex GPMV membrane composition , relative to simple ternary lipid mix - tures of model membranes with composition - dependent fluid - phase - coexistence temperatures ( 38 , 45 , 47 ) . Coexisting fluid membrane phases in GPMVs show fluorescence probe parti - tioning behavior similar to model membranes with L o / L d phase coexistence . Demixing phase separations , particularly in binary or ternary systems , can be considered in regular solution theory , where an enthalpic term due to preferential molecular interactions balances against the entropic contribution proportional to temperature to determine the free energy change of mixing . Highly preferential interactions lead to lower demixing temperatures . Local concen - tration fluctuations associated with nonideal mixing ( 62 ) may diverge on approaching critical ( consolute ) points of multicompo - nent phase diagrams ( 63 ) . Our finding of L o / L d - like phase separa - tion only below physiological temperatures suggests correlated concentration fluctuations above the demixing temperatures that may lead to local composition fluctuations amenable to protein interactions . Correlated concentration fluctuations in native , mac - roscopically homogenous plasma membranes could yield an in - creased encounter probability of signaling molecules with similar membrane phase preference and , likewise , decreased encounter probabilities of signaling components with differing phase prefer - ences . Our experiments do not yet include lifetimes or length scales of such composition fluctuations . The large - scale development of membrane phase domains is driven by the interphase energy of the phase boundaries . Whereas this line tension at fluid phase boundaries can be substantial in lipid model membrane systems ( 14 ) , line tension magnitudes could differ significantly and be much smaller in more complex membrane compositions , possibly favoring small - scale cell membrane heterogeneities ( 64 ) , because line tensions are generally reduced significantly by solute segregation to the interphase boundaries . In summary , we find that GPMVs from RBL mast cells undergo fluid phase segregation that permits the characteriza - tion of lipid and protein partitioning in complex biological membranes . These GPMVs , which contain integral and periph - eral membrane proteins and hundreds of different lipids , seg - regate into L o / L d - like fluid membrane phases at low tempera - tures , indicating nonideal , nonrandom lateral distributions of membrane components and permitting determination of mem - brane phase preferences of labeled lipids and of membrane proteins . The high - affinity IgE receptor partitions into L d - like phases , whereas a glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein and CTB bound to GM 1 segregate into L o - like phases . Several acyl - chain - anchored , GFP - labeled proteins , including palmitoyl / myristoyl - anchored Lyn , partition preferentially to L d - like ( i . e . , ‘‘non - raft’’ ) phases in GMPVs , in contrast to their reported association with detergent - resistant membrane particles , that have been hypothesized to represent ‘‘rafts . ’’ These inner - leaflet acyl - chain - anchored proteins may be affected by changes in lipid asymmetry during the formation of GPMVs . Our method avoids membrane disruption by detergent treat - ment or depletion of membranes of cholesterol or sphingomy - elin . The approach is suitable for examining the distribution of lipids and proteins between membrane domains and therefore allows testing predictions from the raft hypothesis in laterally intact cellular bilayer membranes . Our results present clear evidence that these complex biological cell plasma membranes can phase segregate into coexisting fluid phases but primarily at temperatures below (cid:1) 25°C . The strong temperature dependence of this segregation is consistent with expectations from model membrane studies and implies that , at temperatures above the demixing transition temperature , diffusing membrane hetero - geneities may persist . Further investigation will be necessary to clarify the differences between GPMV and cellular plasma membranes in temperature - dependent phase behavior . Future studies can use GPMVs to examine the dependence of mem - brane protein phase partitioning on biochemical activities , in - cluding the regulation of membrane - associated kinases and phosphatases in cell signaling .

GPMVs were formed by three different meth - ods aimed to produce either cell - attached or free GPMVs of RBL cell plasma membranes . Cell - attached GPMVs . Cell - attached GPMVs were prepared by addition of 1 – 5 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol , acetone , or DMSO to RBL cells suspended at 10 6 cells per milliliter in PBS for 15 min at room temperature ( 23°C ) or by addition of solvents to adherent NIH 3T3 cells in four - well plates . Solvents used to induce membrane vesiculation typically contained R - DOPE or DiIC16 : 0 at 200 (cid:1) g / ml or Nap at 50 (cid:1) g / ml . Cell - FreeGPMVs . Cell - free GPMVs were prepared by either of the two following methods . The primary protocol for GPMV for - mation used a procedure modified from Scott ( 16 , 17 ) and described in ref . 15 . Briefly , cells were grown to confluency in a 25 - cm 2 tissue culture flask , then cells were washed twice with GPMV buffer ( 2 mM CaCl 2 / 10 mM Hepes / 0 . 15 M NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , and (cid:1) 1 . 5 ml of freshly prepared GPMV reagent was added , consisting of 25 mM formaldehyde and 2 mM DTT in GPMV buffer . The flasks were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C while slowly shaking ( 60 – 80 cycles per minute ) . After incubation , GPMVs that had detached from the cells were gently decanted into a conical tube . Previously published protocols ( 15 ) further purified the vesicles by centrifugation and dialysis , but we found that these procedures caused fragmentation of large GPMVs , making microscopic analysis difficult . For the present experi - ments , we allowed GPMVs to settle on ice for 10 - 45 min and collected them by removing (cid:1) 20 % of the total volume from the bottom of the tube . By using this method , a single confluent 25 - cm 2 flask yields sufficient GPMVs to create several dozen microscopy samples . Inanalternativeprotocol , formaldehydeandDTTwerereplaced by 2 mM N - ethylmaleimide , a reagent previously shown to cause GPMV formation ( 17 ) . All other steps are identical . The yield of GPMV is lower , and more cells detach under these conditions . Therefore , this protocol was used primarily to verify that the small amount of formaldehyde and DTT present in the primary method did not affect the results obtained . Baumgart et al .
