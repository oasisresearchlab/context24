KEYWORDS : F - actin remodeling , drebrin , AFM , neuron cytoskeleton , nano ﬁ lament mechanics A fundamental aspect of bionanostructures , such as cytoske - letal F - actin ﬁ laments , is the ability to reorganize their spatial structure and nanoscale mechanics . Drebrin A is a major neuronal actin - binding protein ( ABP ) , localized in dendritic spines 1 that participates in synaptic signal transmission . The stability and dynamics of the spines are tightly linked to the actin cytoskeleton , 2 which is regulated by ABPs . 3 Reduced drebrin level , up to 80 % , is a hallmark of Alzheimer ' s disease and Down syndrome . 4 To date , remodeling of neuronal cytoskeleton by drebrin and the molecular mechanisms by which it modulates spine plasticity and dynamics in vivo is poorly understood . 5 Measuring F - actin changes induced by ABPs , such as drebrin , requires high - resolution structures of F - actin and its complexes . X - ray di ﬀ raction , EM , 6 - 8 and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 9 , 10 have been used earlier for F - actin image analysis . AFM has never been applied to obtain molecular level structural details of F - actin complexes with ABPs at nanoscale resolution . Here , we show a high - resolution AFM study of single actin ﬁ laments decorated with drebrin . The observed remodeling of F - actin by drebrin involves changes of helical twist and ﬁ lament sti ﬀ ness ( 55 % persistence length , L p , increase ) . These results provide evidence of a unique mechanical role of drebrin in the dendrites and contribute to the current molecular level understanding of the properties of the neuronal cytoskeleton as well as the role of nanoscale mechanics in remodeling of nano ﬁ lament structures such as F - actin . Figure 1 shows AFM images of actin ﬁ laments alone ( A , C ) and decorated with drebrin ( B , D ) at lower ( A , B ) and higher resolution ( C , D ) over mica substrate . Single isolated actin ﬁ laments were observed to have a mean width of ∼ 20 nm and height ∼ 2 nm of variable lengths . The helical pitch of single ﬁ laments was 36 ( 2 nm ( n = 50 ﬁ laments ) , consistent with previous studies . 9 The remarkably regular periodicity of drebrin bound actin structures , showing “ pearl necklace ” like morphol - ogy , was observed to extend along the entire length of the actin ﬁ lament showing a mean width of ∼ 40 nm and height of ∼ 3 nm . Cosedimentation assays to examine binding of recombinant drebrin A to actin ﬁ laments estimated K d as ∼ 0 . 1 μ M and the binding was saturated at 1 : 5 mol ratio of drebrin / actin ( Supple - mentary Figure 2 in the Supporting Information ) as per previous reports . 11 The molecular volumes of “ bare ” and drebrin - decorated F - actin ( Figure 2 ) were calculated from AFM images . Sedimen - tation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity runs con ﬁ rmed the monomeric state of drebrin and yielded s 020 , w = 3 . 5 S . ( Supplementary Figure 1 in the Supporting Information ) . As - suming a prolate ellipsoid model , drebrin is 28 . 4 nm long and 2 . 5 nm wide . The overall increase in the volume of the actin ﬁ lament upon drebrin binding and the above drebrin shape considera - tions reveal that approximately three drebrin monomers bind to F - actin per helical pitch , consistent with the binding stoichiometry determined in solution experiments . The actin - drebrin images suggest theircooperative binding . The absence of such cooperativity Received : November 29 , 2010 826 dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / nl104159v | Nano Lett . 2011 , 11 , 825 – 827 Nano Letters LETTER would probably result in incomplete actin ﬁ lament coverage by drebrin , leading to gaps between the characteristic beadlike structures ( Figure 1 ) . The height undulations along the actin ﬁ lament backbone are shown in panels E and F of Figure 1 as cross - section pro ﬁ les measured along the length of the ﬁ lament . Fourier analysis of cross - section pro ﬁ les obtained from several individual actin ﬁ laments ( n = 20 per ﬁ lament ) revealed an increase in the peak periodicity pro ﬁ le of F - actin ﬁ laments ( unbound 36 ( 2 nm ) to 40 . 0 ( 0 . 8 nm for drebrin - bound F - actin . To date , only few examples of ABPs changing the helical twist of F - actin have been reported . 12 - 14 The most striking case is a multifunctional ABP , co ﬁ lin , which exerts its severing function by capturing and stabilizing an “ overtwisted ” actin conformation and , consequently , leading to ﬁ lament severing . 12 Interestingly , drebrin which contains N - terminal actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) homology domain , changes F - actin morphology in the opposite direction to that induced by ADF / co ﬁ lins . To con ﬁ rm this conclusion and test the resolution and analysis of the AFM actin ﬁ lament images , co ﬁ lin - bound actin ﬁ laments were used as controls ( Supplementary Figure 3 in the Supporting Information ) . Compared to the drebrin - decorated F - actin , the co ﬁ lin - decorated F - actin appeared thinner ( ∼ 30 nm ) and lower in height ( 2 . 6 nm ) . The mass of ﬁ laments increased proportionately to that expected for a 16 kDa protein bound to actin . While drebrin binding increased the helical pitch of actin ﬁ laments , co ﬁ lin - decorated F - actin had a signi ﬁ cantly reduced helical pitch ( mean = 28 . 7 nm ( 2 . 1 ) , which is in good agreement with earlier studies . 12 Drebrin - and co ﬁ lin - induced changes in F - actin helical peri - odicity fall within the range of the angular component values in the random angular disorder model of F - actin . 15 These changes are consistent with the scenario in which ABPs capture one of the internal modes of F - actin twist , which favors their binding , and stabilize this mode locally or over a long - range of ﬁ lament length due to cooperative interactions . The mechanical properties of actin ﬁ laments may be corre - lated with the helical structure and ﬂ exibility . The L p of actin ﬁ laments , determined from measurements of local angle distribution 16 ( see supplementary methods in the Supporting Information ) , yield 7 . 05 μ m for bare actin , 10 . 90 μ m for drebrin - bound actin ﬁ laments ( an increase of ∼ 55 % in L p ) , and a dramatic decrease to 1 . 47 μ m , for co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments . The L p values obtained from AFM images are compar - able to those previously reported for bare actin and the F - actin - co ﬁ lin complex , validating the approach used in this work . 17 - 19 From indirect evidence , it has been tentatively proposed that drebrin as well as tropomyosin may increase the sti ﬀ ness and alter the stability and elasticity of F - actin by binding along its sides . 11 Our data show direct quantitative evidence that drebrin modulates F - actin by signi ﬁ cantly increasing L p and elastic modulus of actin ﬁ laments ( Table 1 ) . If drebrin and tropomyosin induce similar changes in F - actin , one may ask , why both proteins are needed in the cell . It is known that ABPs such as gelsolin and co ﬁ lin can cause dramatic changes in spine morphology due to their ﬁ lament severing activity . 3 , 20 , 21 It is possible that drebrin - induced stabilization of “ undertwisted ” ( as opposed to co ﬁ lin - induced destabilization of “ overtwisted ” ) F - actin conformation would result in a weakening of the co ﬁ lin binding to the ﬁ laments and thus prevent the co ﬁ lin - induced severing . In line with this prediction , our preliminary experiments indicated a drebrin - induced protection of F - actin against co ﬁ lin severing . However , Figure 1 . Drebrin - F - actin complex .

In summary , the structural di ﬀ erences between bare and drebrin - decorated F - actin , elucidated in this high - resolution AFM study , provide a model for how this actin binding protein changes the mechanical properties of actin ﬁ laments in neuronal cells and hence a ﬀ ect the remodeling and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines . The ability of AFM to quantita - tively analyze remodeling of F - actin provides a deeper insight into the structural and mechanical modulation of F - actin com - plexes at nanoscale resolution . ’ ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information .
