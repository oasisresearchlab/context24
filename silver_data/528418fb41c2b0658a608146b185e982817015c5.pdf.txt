However , its exact roles remained elusive . Recent studies shed new light on many crucial roles of F - actin in regulating exo - and endocytosis . Here , this progress is reviewed from studies of secretory cells , particularly neurons and endocrine cells . These studies reveal that F - actin is involved in mediating all kinetically distinguishable forms of endocytosis , including ultrafast , fast , slow , bulk , and overshoot endocytosis , likely via membrane pit formation . F - actin promotes vesicle replenishment to the readily releasable pool most likely via active zone clearance , which may sustain synaptic transmission and overcome short - term depression of synaptic transmission during repetitive ﬁring . By enhancing plasma membrane tension , F - actin promotes fusion pore expansion , vesicular content release , and a fusion mode called shrink fusion involving fusing vesicle shrinking . Not only F - actin , but also the F - actin assembly pathway , including ATP hydrolysis , N - WASH , and formin , are involved in mediating these roles of exo - and endocytosis . Neurological disorders , including spinocerebellar ataxia 13 caused by Kv3 . 3 channel mutation , may involve impairment of F - actin and its assembly pathway , leading in turn to impairment of exo - and endocytosis at synapses that may contribute to neurological disorders . Keywords : actin , exocytosis , endocytosis , synaptic transmission , neurological disorder INTRODUCTION Vesicle exocytosis releases neurotransmitters and hormones to mediate important functions , such as synaptic transmission , stress responses , and immune responses ( Wu et al . , 2014 ; Chang et al . , 2017 ; Brunger et al . , 2018 ; Sharma and Lindau , 2018 ) . After exocytosis , fused vesicles must be retrieved via endocytosis , which recycles vesicles and thus sustains exocytosis in secretory cells , particularly in nerve terminals ( Wu et al . , 2014 ; Kononenko and Haucke , 2015 ; Gan and Watanabe , 2018 ) . Half a century of studies identiﬁed many core exo - and endocytic proteins , such as SNARE proteins , synaptotagmin , and dynamin ( Jahn and Fasshauer , 2012 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Mettlen et al . , 2018 ) . However , the role of actin in the exo - and endocytosis of secretory cells remained not well understood despite it being one of the most abundant cytoskeletal proteins ( Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) . Studies over the past three decades led to proposals that actin is involved in many steps of exo - and endocytosis in secretory cells . These potential roles include vesicle clustering in nerve terminals , physical barrier to prevent vesicle docking at the plasma membrane , facilitation of vesicle mobilization to the readily releasable pool ( RRP ) that seems to contradict its physical barrier function , fusion pore expansion , vesicle merging at the plasma membrane , and endocytosis that Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 1 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 2 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis recycles vesicles ( Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) . With respect to its vesicle clustering role , ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) , together with synapsin , has long been proposed to provide a cytoskeletal scaﬀold linking vesicles together , leading to formation of vesicle clusters in nerve terminals ( reviewed in Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) . Recent studies suggest that synapsin alone can form a distinct liquid phase in an aqueous environment , which may catalyze vesicle clustering at nerve terminals ( Milovanovic et al . , 2018 ) . Microinjection of reagents that bind to the intrinsically disordered region of synapsin causes dispersal of synaptic vesicle clusters , suggesting that liquid - liquid phase separation may mediate synaptic vesicle clustering ( Pechstein et al . , 2020 ) . These results suggest re - examination of the role of F - actin in vesicle clustering in the future . Accordingly , this topic will not be further discussed here . With respect to its physical barrier role , early studies showed that disruption of actin polymerization increases the frequency of spontaneous and evoked transmitter release at synapses and in endocrine cells , suggesting that F - actin behind the plasma membrane may restrain docking of vesicles at release sites ( Aunis and Bader , 1988 ; Morales et al . , 2000 ; Trifaro et al . , 2000 ; Chowdhury et al . , 2002 ; Malacombe et al . , 2006 ; Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) . In neuroendocrine cells , the region of cytosol adjacent to the plasma membrane contains the most actin ﬁlaments , called the cortical actin network ( reviewed in Meunier and Gutierrez , 2016 ) . This cortical actin network may act as a physical barrier that opposes vesicle access to release sites , as shown in studies of chemicals that stabilize or inhibit actin polymerization ( Wen et al . , 2011 ; Meunier and Gutierrez , 2016 ) . The physical barrier function has been systematically surveyed in several excellent reviews ( Meunier and Gutierrez , 2016 ; Papadopulos , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , readers are referred to these reviews for more detailed discussion of the physical barrier function . This review focuses on actin’s roles in mediating endocytosis , facilitating replenishment of the RRP , promoting fusion pore expansion , and merging vesicles with the plasma membrane . Potential mechanisms that may reconcile the apparent conﬂict between actin’s physical barrier function versus facilitatory role in RRP replenishment are also suggested . ACTIN IS CRUCIAL FOR ALL KINETICALLY DISTINGUISHABLE FORMS OF ENDOCYTOSIS Early studies regarding actin’s role in endocytosis in secretory cells reached diﬀerent conclusions as to whether actin is needed and at which step ( s ) . For example , at lamprey giant synapses , latrunculin B , which disrupts actin polymerization , causes accumulation of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles ( Shupliakov et al . , 2002 ; Bourne et al . , 2006 ) , whereas latrunculin A ( Lat A ) , which also disrupts actin polymerization , does not aﬀect endocytosis as measured using FM1 - 43 uptake ( Bleckert et al . , 2012 ) . At frog neuromuscular junctions , Lat A reduces FM1 - 43 uptake into nerve terminals ( Richards et al . , 2004 ) . Whether this eﬀect is caused by inhibition of endocytosis or exocytosis has not been distinguished . On the other hand , cytochalasin D , which inhibits actin polymerization , does not aﬀect FM1 - 43 uptake or release , implying that actin may not be needed for endocytosis at frog neuromuscular junctions ( Betz and Henkel , 1994 ) . At hippocampal synapses , Lat A does not aﬀect endocytosis after action potential trains ( Li and Murthy , 2001 ; Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2003 ; Hua et al . , 2011 ) . At goldﬁsh retinal bipolar synapses , latrunculin B and cytochalasin D do not inhibit endocytosis over a time course < ∼ 20 s , but may slow down bulk endocytosis ( Holt et al . , 2003 ) . Lat A inhibits fast endocytosis at mossy ﬁber boutons ( Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ) and ultrafast endocytosis at hippocampal synapses ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . These pharmacological studies do not reach a consensus regarding the eﬀect of actin blockers on endocytosis at the same synapse , at diﬀerent synapses , or for diﬀerent endocytic modes . However , these studies rely on actin blockers , and some studies use only one blocker at one concentration . False - positive or - negative results owing to oﬀ - target eﬀects or diﬃculty blocking actin polymerization in live cells might contribute to these apparent controversial results ( Bleckert et al . , 2012 ) . In the following , we review more recent studies that used genetic combined with pharmacological approaches to study actin’s endocytic role in mammalian cells . There are six actin isoforms in mammalian cells . β - Cytoplasmic actin ( β - actin ) , encoded by Actb , and γ - cytoplasmic actin ( γ - actin ) , encoded by Actg1 , are ubiquitously expressed and are the major isoforms in the nervous system ( Figure 1A ; Herman , 1993 ; Cheever and Ervasti , 2013 ) . β - or γ - actin knockout at two types of nerve terminals in mice , the calyx of Held and hippocampal boutons , were generated ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . At the giant calyx of Held nerve terminal , capacitance measurements reveal four kinetically diﬀerent forms of endocytosis , including slow endocytosis ( tens of seconds ) , rapid or fast endocytosis ( a few seconds ) , bulk endocytosis ( forming vesicles larger than regular vesicles ) , and endocytosis overshoot ( retrieving more vesicles than were exocytosed ) ( Sun and Wu , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita et al . , 2005 , 2010 ; Renden and Von Gersdorﬀ , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2008 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ; Xue et al . , 2012 ) . At cultured small conventional hippocampal boutons , endocytosis can be measured with imaging of pH - sensitive pHluorin attached to synaptic vesicle proteins ( Sankaranarayanan and Ryan , 2000 ; Wienisch and Klingauf , 2006 ; Balaji and Ryan , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Kavalali and Jorgensen , 2014 ; Chanaday and Kavalali , 2018 ) . Capacitance measurements at calyces reveal that β - or γ - actin knockout inhibits slow endocytosis , rapid endocytosis ( Figures 1B , C ) , bulk endocytosis ( detected as the large downward capacitance shift ; Figure 1D ) , and endocytosis overshoot ( Figure 1D ; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Electron microscopy and pHluorin imaging at hippocampal synapses show that β - or γ - actin knockout inhibits slow endocytosis and endosome - like structure formation due to bulk endocytosis ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , actin is crucial in mediating rapid , slow , bulk , and overshoot endocytosis . An actin mutant with a polymerization defect could not rescue endocytosis in boutons lacking β - actin , suggesting that polymerized actin , which is known to exert mechanical forces ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) , is involved in generating Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 3 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis FIGURE 1 | Actin is involved in mediating ultrafast , fast , slow , bulk , and overshoot endocytosis at synapses likely by facilitating membrane pit formation .

Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 4 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis forces needed for endocytosis ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Actin knockout does not aﬀect the rate of ﬁssion pore closure during bulk endocytosis at calyces but inhibits membrane pit formation at hippocampal synapses ( Figure 1F ) , suggesting that F - actin may exert mechanical force to bend membrane and thereby generate membrane pits ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings indicate that polymerized actin may mediate rapid , slow , bulk , and overshoot endocytosis by providing mechanical forces to bend membrane ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . This suggestion , supported by genetic evidence , is consistent with pharmacological evidence that Lat A inhibits a very fast form of endocytosis with a time constant of ∼ 0 . 5 s recorded with capacitance measurements at cerebellar and hippocampal mossy ﬁber boutons ( Figure 1E ; Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ) . Lat A also inhibits ultrafast pit formation detected with electron microscopy combined with rapid freezing after optogenetic stimulation at hippocampal synapses ( Figure 1G ) , which suggests involvement of F - actin in ultrafast endocytosis ( Watanabe et al . , 2013 ) . Taken together , these results indicate that F - actin may be involved in mediating all distinguishable forms of endocytosis at synapses , including ultrafast , fast , slow , bulk , and overshoot endocytosis via its role in pit generation ( Figure 1H ) . This possibility , inferred from studies of secretory cells , may not generalize to non - secretory vesicle endocytosis in mammalian cells , where F - actin is thought to be needed to overcome membrane tension only when plasma membrane tension is high ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Saﬀarian et al . , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . However , it is consistent with actin’s role during endocytosis in yeast , which possess a cell wall , where actin polymerization from the plasma membrane toward the cytosol has been suggested to generate a force pushing and elongating the neck , forming a tube - shape pit ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ) . Whether this mechanism applies to mammalian cells , which do not contain cell walls , remains to be determined . Imaging F - actin dynamics during endocytic membrane pit formation in real time , a very recent study in mammalian chromaﬃn cells suggests that F - actin may providing a point - pulling force at the center of the endocytic zone to pull membrane inward , forming membrane pits together with dynamin ( Shin et al . , 2022 ) . Many factors are involved in nucleating F - actin . Neural Wiskott - Aldrich - syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) may activate actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 ) to form branched actin networks together with myosin , whereas formins are involved in forming linear actin ﬁlaments ( Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ; Kononenko and Haucke , 2015 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . Myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin suppresses endocytosis at hippocampal and calyx of Held synapses , suggesting that myosin II - dependent F - actin nucleation is involved in mediating endocytosis ( Yue and Xu , 2014 ; Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . Consistent with this suggestion , knockout of myosin IIB or application of blebbistatin reduces horseradish peroxidase uptake that may reﬂect endocytosis at hippocampal synapses ( Chandrasekar et al . , 2013 ) . To investigate the function of actomyosin , actin nucleation , which precedes F - actin assembly , has been studied with pharmacological approaches and gene knockdown ( Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . Inhibition of formin - mediated assembly of linear actin ﬁlaments by the selective inhibitor SMIFH2 ( Ganguly et al . , 2015 ) in turn inhibits endocytosis at hippocampal and calyx - type synapses ( Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . Similarly , shRNA - mediated knockdown of the diaphanous - related formin mDia1 slows synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . These results suggest that formin - dependent actin ﬁlament assembly may regulate synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . Recent studies reveal an unexpected relationship between potassium channels and endocytosis mediated by nucleation of F - actin at synapses ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2021 ) . Since the discovery of potassium channels , the physiological and pathological impact of potassium channels has been attributed to their ion conductance , which sets the cell membrane potential and repolarizes the membrane during action potentials ( Kaczmarek and Zhang , 2017 ) . For example , Kv3 family channels are generally considered to regulate neurotransmitter release by repolarizing the membrane during action potentials ( Kaczmarek and Zhang , 2017 ) . A recent study reports a crucial function of these channels independent of their ion conductance – by organizing the F - actin cytoskeleton in nerve terminals , Kv3 . 3 protein facilitates rapid and slow endocytosis at hippocampal and calyx of Held synapses ( Wu et al . , 2021 ) . The extended cytoplasmic C - terminal domain of Kv3 . 3 at the plasma membrane binds to and thereby recruits beneath the plasma membrane the Arp2 / 3 , which is involved in nucleating the cortical F - actin cytoskeleton ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2021 ) . The channel mutation G592R Kv3 . 3 causes Kv3 . 3 to fail to bind Arp2 / 3 , and thus disrupts the ability of the channel to nucleate F - actin in nerve terminals , resulting in inhibition of synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2021 ) . Since this mutation may cause spinocerebellar ataxia 13 ( Middlebrooks et al . , 2013 ) , inhibition of synaptic vesicle endocytosis by disruption of F - actin nucleation may contribute to the generation of spinocerebellar ataxia 13 ( Wu et al . , 2021 ) . Figure 1H provides a schematic summary of the role of actin and its assembly pathways in mediating synaptic vesicle endocytosis . The implications of the studies discussed above are integrated in the ﬁgure to show the involvement of F - actin and F - actin nucleation factors , such as Kv3 . 3 , Arp2 / 3 , formin , and myosin II , in all kinetically distinguishable forms of endocytosis . ACTIN FACILITATES VESICLE REPLENISHMENT TO THE READILY RELEASABLE POOL After release of vesicles at active zone release sites , they must be replenished . This process , called vesicle mobilization or replenishment to the RRP , is crucial to sustain synaptic transmission and minimize short - term synaptic depression during repetitive ﬁring ( Wang and Kaczmarek , 1998 ; Schneggenburger et al . , 1999 ; Wu and Borst , 1999 ; Sakaba and Neher , 2001 ; Von Gersdorﬀ and Borst , 2002 ; Zucker and Regehr , 2002 ; Xu and Wu , 2005 ; He et al . , 2009 ) . At the calyx of Held synapse , the rate of RRP replenishment can be measured experimentally with a pair of depolarizing pulses of ∼ 20 – 50 ms , each of which can completely deplete the Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 5 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis FIGURE 2 | Actin promotes RRP replenishment likely by facilitating active zone clearance .

The exocytosis induced by the second pulse applied at various intervals after the ﬁrst pulse may thus indicate the time course of RRP replenishment ( Figures 2A – C ) . It has been found that the RRP replenishment is suppressed by a variety of manipulations that inhibit F - actin , including knockout of the β - actin or γ - actin gene ( Figures 2A , B ) , Lat A that inhibits F - actin polymerization ( Figure 2C ) , Kv3 . 3 that disrupts F - actin nucleation , and mutation of Kv3 . 3 that causes spinocerebellar ataxia and inhibits F - actin nucleation at nerve Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 5 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 6 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis FIGURE 3 | F - actin promotes fusion pore expansion by enhancing plasma membrane tension .

These results suggest that F - actin facilitates RRP replenishment and impact F - actin nucleation may contribute to the generation of neurological disorders . Since RRP replenishment sustains synaptic transmission during repetitive ﬁring , suppression of RRP replenishment by inhibition of F - actin predicts severe short - term depression of synaptic transmission . This prediction was veriﬁed by measurements of the excitatory postsynaptic current ( EPSC ) during repetitive ﬁring in Kv3 . 3 knockout or G592R Kv3 . 3 knock - in mice , in which F - actin nucleation at nerve terminals is impaired ( Figure 2D ; Wu et al . , 2021 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that F - actin opposes short - term depression , and thus helps to sustain synaptic transmission during repetitive ﬁring . Given that inhibition of endocytosis by the block of dynamin , calmodulin , calcium inﬂux , and SNARE proteins slows down RRP replenishment , it has been suggested that endocytosis facilitates RRP replenishment via clearance of the active zone as perturbed by exocytosis ( Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2009 , 2014 ; Neher , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ; Hua et al . , 2013 ; Xu et al . , 2013 ) . Accordingly , actin involvement in endocytosis and RRP replenishment suggests that F - actin promotes RRP replenishment by facilitating active zone clearance ( Figure 2E ; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , impairment of RRP replenishment may contribute to the generation of spinocerebellar ataxia 13 and other neurological disorders caused by impairments of F - actin nucleation or assembly . The exact mechanism of how actin and endocytosis mediate active zone clearance remains unclear . Annexin A2 , a calcium - , actin - , and lipid - binding protein involved in exocytosis , may induce actin bundling that seems essential for generating active exocytotic sites in chromaﬃn cells ( Gabel et al . , 2015 ) . Such a mechanism might provide hints about how F - actin facilitates replenishment of the RRP . Actin’s role in facilitating RRP replenishment is apparently in conﬂict with its physical barrier function , which has been suggested based on an observed increase in spontaneous and evoked vesicular content release after inhibition of actin polymerization ( Aunis and Bader , 1988 ; Morales et al . , 2000 ; Trifaro et al . , 2000 ; Chowdhury et al . , 2002 ; Malacombe et al . , 2006 ; Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) . This discrepancy could be reconciled if the RRP replenishment reﬂects mostly the active zone clearance , but not solely just vesicle movement to the docking site . The RRP is functionally deﬁned as a pool of vesicles that can be depleted by a brief depolarization ( Von Gersdorﬀ and Borst , 2002 ; Neher and Sakaba , 2008 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) . For example , at the calyx of Held , the RRP is deﬁned as the vesicles being released by a 20 or 50 ms depolarization or about 20 action potentials at 100 – 300 Hz ( Wang and Kaczmarek , 1998 ; Schneggenburger et al . , 1999 ; Wu and Borst , 1999 ; Sakaba and Neher , 2001 ; Sun and Wu , 2001 ) . The number of vesicles in the RRP , estimated with capacitance measurements ( Sun and Wu , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ) , could be larger than the number of morphologically docked vesicles observed with electron microscopy ( Sätzler et al . , 2002 ; Taschenberger et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , RRP replenishment may reﬂect not only physical movement of vesicles from the cytosol to the plasma membrane docking site , but also the summed activity of active zone clearance , vesicle docking , and subsequent vesicle priming to become release - ready . Accordingly , we suggest that within the time scale of seconds after RRP depletion , F - actin cytoskeleton may help in active zone clearance that facilitates RRP replenishment . In a longer time scale and likely a longer distance , F - actin cytoskeleton may serve as a physical barrier for vesicles deep inside the cytosol to move toward the plasma membrane . This suggestion may reconcile the apparent controversy surrounding F - actin regarding its facilitatory role in RRP replenishment and its inhibitory function in vesicle movement toward the plasma membrane . Verifying this suggestion in the future may require imaging and quantiﬁcation of individual vesicle movements toward , and fusion at , the plasma membrane release site in live cells . FILAMENTOUS ACTIN PROMOTES FUSION PORE EXPANSION AND THUS CONTENT RELEASE BY ENHANCING MEMBRANE TENSION Filamentous actin blockers that reduce F - actin ( Figure 3A ) and myosin II inhibitors slow down catecholamine release as detected with amperometry ( Figures 3B , C ; Neco et al . , 2008 ; Berberian et al . , 2009 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) and prolong release of vesicular lumen protein neuropeptide Y - EGFP as detected with imaging in chromaﬃn cells ( Figure 3D ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . These results suggest that F - actin speeds up vesicular content release in chromaﬃn cells . How does F - actin facilitate vesicular content release ? Recent studies addressed this question by direct visualization of fusion pore opening , expansion , constriction and closure with super - resolution stimulated emission depletion Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 7 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 8 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis ( STED ) microscopy at a neuroendocrine cell , the adrenal chromaﬃn cell containing ∼ 180 – 720 nm diameter vesicles ( Figure 3E ; Wen et al . , 2016 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ; Shin et al . , 2018 ) . It has been observed that fusion pore size may vary between 0 and 490 nm within 26 ms to seconds ( Shin et al . , 2018 ) . These pore dynamics are crucial in determining the eﬃciency of vesicular cargo release and vesicle retrieval ( Shin et al . , 2018 ) . They are generated by competition between mechanisms FIGURE 4 | Actin promotes shrink fusion by enhancing plasma membrane tension .

Cells maintain an outward ( swelling ) osmotic pressure (cid:49) P = P cell – P ext ( green arrows ) , with cell pressure P cell exceeding extracellular pressure P ext . Intact vesicles maintain swelling pressure ( red arrow ) , with vesicle pressure P ves > P cell . Following fusion with plasma membrane ( PM ) , rapid equilibration between vesicle lumen and extracellular medium is assumed , so P ves = P ext . The vesicle osmotic pressure then equals (cid:49) P but is now an inward squeezing pressure .

Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 8 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 9 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis for pore expansion and mechanisms for pore constriction and closure ( Shin et al . , 2018 ) . Increasing the extracellular solution osmolarity , which shrinks the cell size and thus may reduce plasma membrane tension ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) , reduces the initial fusion pore size as measured with STED microscopy ( Figure 3F ; Shin et al . , 2018 ) . Lat A , which reduces F - actin and plasma membrane tension as measured with the pipette aspiration technique in chromaﬃn cells ( Figure 3G ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) , also reduces the initial fusion pore size as measured with STED microscopy ( Figure 3H ; Shin et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , F - actin promotes fusion pore expansion by enhancing plasma membrane tension ( Shin et al . , 2018 ) , explaining why F - actin facilitates vesicular content release ( Figure 3I ) . FILAMENTOUS ACTIN PROMOTES SHRINK FUSION For many decades , two fusion modes were thought to control hormone and transmitter release ( Ceccarelli et al . , 1973 ; Heuser and Reese , 1981 ; Alabi and Tsien , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) . One facilitates release via fusion pore dilation and ﬂattening , called full - collapse fusion . The other limits release by closing a narrow fusion pore , called kiss - and - run or close - fusion ( Ceccarelli et al . , 1973 ; Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . With super - resolution STED microscopy to visualize fusion modes of dense - core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells , it has been found , surprisingly , that facilitation of release is not mediated by full - collapse , but rather shrink fusion , in which the (cid:127) - proﬁle generated by vesicle fusion shrinks , but maintains a large non - dilating pore until the (cid:127) - proﬁle is undetectable ( Figure 4A ; Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ; Shin et al . , 2018 , 2021 ) . Inhibition of F - actin polymerization by Lat A , cytochalasin D , or β - actin knockout signiﬁcantly reduces plasma membrane tension ( Figure 3G ) and shrink fusion percentage ( Figures 4B , C ; Wen et al . , 2016 ; Shin et al . , 2020 ) . Such an inhibition of shrink fusion can be mimicked by a decrease in plasma membrane tension ( via increasing the extracellular solution osmolarity ) and can be rescued by an increase in plasma membrane tension ( via decreasing the extracellular solution osmolarity ) ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . These results suggest that F - actin is essential in mediating shrink fusion ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , it has been shown that the F - actin assembly pathway , including N - WASP , formin , and hydrolysis of the energy molecule ATP is involved in mediating shrink fusion ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Inhibition of F - actin leads to accumulation of (cid:127) - shape proﬁles at the active zone of lamprey synapses , suggesting that F - actin also facilitates merging of fusing vesicles at the plasma membrane , likely also via shrink fusion ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . How does F - actin - provided membrane tension mediate shrink fusion ? A recent study found that the swelling osmotic pressure maintained by cells , the positive intracellular - to - extracellular osmotic pressure diﬀerence , may squeeze the (cid:127) - proﬁle and reduce the (cid:127) - proﬁle membrane tension , generating a tension gradient from the plasma membrane to the (cid:127) - proﬁle that reels (cid:127) - proﬁle membrane into the plasma membrane ( Figures 4D , E ; Shin et al . , 2020 ) . The requirement of the plasma - membrane - to - (cid:127) - proﬁle tension gradient explains why F - actin - dependent plasma membrane tension is needed to mediate shrink fusion ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . As the fused vesicle medium equilibrates with the extracellular medium , the squeezing pressure is equal to the swelling osmotic pressure of the cell ( Diz - Munoz et al . , 2010 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Stewart et al . , 2011 ; Tsujita et al . , 2015 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . With squeezing FIGURE 5 | Schematic summary of F - actin’s functions in RRP replenishment , fusion pore expansion , fused vesicle merging via shrink fusion , and all distinguishable forms of endocytosis in secretory cells . The schematic drawing shows RRP replenishment involving active zone clearance , vesicle docking and priming , fusion pore opening , fusion pore expansion that releases vesicular contents , shrink fusion that merges fused vesicles at the plasma membrane , and classical endocytosis involving pit formation and ﬁssion of the pit . F - actin promotes ( 1 ) RRP replenishment likely by facilitating active zone clearance , ( 2 ) fusion pore expansion by enhancing the plasma membrane tension , ( 3 ) shrink fusion by providing membrane tension to reel of fusing vesicular membrane , and ( 4 ) endocytosis likely by generating forces needed for pit formation . Actin nucleation factors , including Kv3 . 3 , N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 , myosin II , and formin are also involved in these processes . This cartoon represents a synthesis of many suggestions derived from the many studies discussed in this review . Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 9 March 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 841704 fnsyn - 14 - 841704 March 1 , 2022 Time : 12 : 39 # 10 Wu and Chan Actin Promotes Exo - and Endocytosis force and membrane - reeling - in force , (cid:127) - proﬁle shrinking is energetically favored over full - collapse fusion ( Figures 4D , E ) , explaining why shrink fusion is selected over full - collapse fusion to merge fusing vesicles at the plasma membrane . Given that the swelling osmotic pressure and cortical F - actin required for mediating shrink fusion are general properties of cells ( Dai and Sheetz , 1999 ; Diz - Munoz et al . , 2010 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Stewart et al . , 2011 ; Tsujita et al . , 2015 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) , shrink fusion may in fact replace the widely believed - to - be dominant full - collapse fusion in many cell types . It should be noted that as the fusion - generated (cid:127) - proﬁle shrinks at the ﬁnal stage , the (cid:127) - proﬁle may undergo a transition to a (cid:51) - or dome - shape proﬁle ( Shin et al . , 2020 ) . This observation has led to the proposal of a shrink - collapse fusion mode , in which (cid:127) - proﬁle shrinking is followed by a transition to a (cid:51) - proﬁle , which in turn is followed by ﬂattening / merging ( Shin et al . , 2020 ) . This mode uniﬁes the apparent contradiction between shrink fusion and full - collapse fusion . It has been proposed that small synaptic vesicles , with diameters in the range of ∼ 20 – 60 nm , may undergo shrink - collapse fusion , with shrinking as the major component for larger synaptic vesicles and collapse as the primary component for smaller synaptic vesicles . Supporting this proposal , inhibition of F - actin assembly with Lat A , cytochalasin D , or an inhibitor of the formin - dependent F - actin assembly reduces F - actin at nerve terminals and causes accumulation of (cid:127) - proﬁles at the active zone of lamprey giant synapses ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting that F - actin is also involved in merging small synaptic vesicles , likely via facilitating shrink fusion or shrink - collapse fusion . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS Recent studies reveal an essential role of F - actin in mediating all kinetically distinguishable forms of endocytosis , including ultrafast , fast , slow , bulk , and overshoot endocytosis ( Figure 5 ) . Ultrastructural examination and real - time imaging suggest that F - actin is involved in pit formation , a critical step of endocytosis that has just been visualized in real time in live cells ( Shin et al . , 2021 , 2022 ) . The essential role of F - actin in mediating endocytosis may facilitate active zone clearance that may in turn promote RRP replenishment ( Figure 5 ) . RRP replenishment sustains synaptic transmission and overcomes short - term depression during repetitive ﬁring at synapses . Facilitation of RRP replenishment via active zone clearance within seconds after exocytosis is diﬀerent from the physical barrier function F - actin performs on a much longer time scale during vesicle movement from deep inside the cytosol to the plasma membrane . Such a diﬀerence might reconcile the apparent conﬂict of F - actin’s roles between facilitation of RRP replenishment and being a physical barrier that blocks vesicle movement . Recent studies also showed that F - actin promotes rapid and complete vesicular content release by increasing plasma membrane tension , which facilitates fusion pore expansion ( Figure 5 ) . By increasing plasma membrane tension , F - actin reels oﬀ fusing vesicle membrane and thus mediates shrink fusion together with the swelling osmotic pressure of the cell that squeezes the fusing (cid:127) - proﬁle ( Figure 5 ) . In conclusion , F - actin is essential in ( 1 ) mediating all forms of endocytosis and the RRP replenishment that together sustain synaptic transmission , ( 2 ) expanding the fusion pore to promote vesicular content release , and ( 3 ) mediating shrink fusion or shrink - collapse fusion that merges fusing vesicles with the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ) . Not only actin , but also the actin assembly pathway , including N - WASH - dependent branched F - actin assembly and formin - dependent linear F - actin assembly are involved in mediating these functions of F - actin . A mutation in the Kv3 . 3 potassium channel , which causes spinocerebellar ataxia 13 , inhibits F - actin nucleation , endocytosis , and RRP replenishment and enhances short - term synaptic depression at synapses ( Wu et al . , 2021 ) , suggesting that impairment of F - actin’s roles in exo - and endocytosis may contribute to neurological disorders . While recent studies reveal important roles of F - actin in regulating exo - and endocytosis , how F - actin generates forces to mediate endocytosis and pit formation remains not well understood . How actin facilitates active zone clearance and thus RRP replenishment also remains unclear , owing to the diﬃculty of visualizing active zone clearance in live synapses ( Hua et al . , 2013 ) . To what extent impairment of F - actin assembly and nucleation plays a role in generating neurological disorders is not well understood . How the cell uses F - actin to shrink fusing (cid:127) - proﬁles at release sites , but also to generate endocytic pits at endocytic sites , apparently contradictory functions , is also not well understood . It would be of great interest to address these questions in the future . AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS L - GW designed and wrote the manuscript . CYC participated in writing the manuscript .
