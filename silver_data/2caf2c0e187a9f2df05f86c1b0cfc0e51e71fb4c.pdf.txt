OrgBox : Supporting Cognitive and Metacognitive Activities During Exploratory Search Austin R . Ward , Robert Capra University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill { austinrw , rcapra } @ unc . edu ABSTRACT We describe a search - assistance tool called the OrgBox , created to support users’ organizational , cognitive , and metacognitive activi - ties while performing exploratory search tasks . The OrgBox tool allows users to create and label “boxes” to organize information found during a search . The OrgBox was integrated with a custom built search system that allowed users to save , organize , and synthe - size information using drag - and - drop actions . The OrgBox tool also encourages users to engage in metacognitive activities during their search process ( e . g . , planning their next steps , monitoring their progress , evaluating the information found so far ) . In this paper , we describe the features and implementation of the OrgBox tool . We also summarize result of two user studies conducted using the OrgBox that show its cognitive and metacognitive benefits to users .

Exploratory searches are by nature complex , leading users to engage in high - level cognitive activi - ties including learning , exploration , and synthesis [ 26 , 39 ] . Suc - cessful exploratory searches also require metacognitive activities including planning , monitoring , evaluation , and reflection [ 26 , 39 ] .

However , relatively less research has explored how search tools can encourage metacognitive activities during exploratory searches . This is our focus . We describe an exploratory search assistance tool called the Org - Box 1 . We developed the OrgBox tool with two primary goals : 1 ) to provide support for saving , organizing , and synthesizing informa - tion found during exploratory search tasks , and 2 ) to encourage users to engage in metacognitive activities ( e . g . , planning their next steps , monitoring their progress , evaluating the information found , reflecting on what they have learned ) during their search process . Research in the fields of education and learning sciences has shown that planning , monitoring , and evaluation are specific metacogni - tive activities that can benefit users when they are learning about new concepts [ 8 , 27 , 42 ] . We designed the OrgBox tool to encourage users to engage in these activities during their search process . The OrgBox allows users to create “boxes” in which they can drag - and - drop information items found on landing pages . Users can give the boxes meaningful titles , move the boxes on a canvas , and move items among the boxes . The OrgBox was designed to provide support for both cognitive activities ( e . g . organizing , group - ing , synthesizing ) and metacognitive activities ( e . g . , monitoring , evaluating , updating ) that are involved in exploratory search tasks . In this demo paper , we describe the features , design , and im - plementation of the OrgBox tool . We also report cognitive and metacognitive benefits of the tool that we found in two separate user studies [ 10 , 12 ] that involved participants using the tool to complete exploratory search tasks . In both studies , participants gave the OrgBox tool significantly higher ratings for metacognitive support compared to a baseline bookmarking tool ( Study 1 ) [ 10 ] and a Google Doc - style note - taking tool ( Study 2 ) [ 12 ] . Participants in both studies described specific ways that the OrgBox provided support for cognitive ( e . g . , synthesis , organization ) and metacog - nitive activities ( e . g . , planning , monitoring ) during their searches . 2 RELATED WORK Researchers in interactive information retrieval have recognized that users face a variety of challenges when conducting exploratory search tasks [ 26 , 39 ] . Much prior research has focused on help - ing searchers with discovery and exploration of an information space . For example , faceted search interfaces [ 37 ] , methods of re - sults visualization [ 21 , 40 ] , and result clustering [ 9 , 22 ] have all been investigated as ways to help users explore an information 1 The source code is available at https : / / github . com / uncinteractivesystemslab / OrgBox under the GPLv3 license Demonstration Paper II SIGIR ’21 , July 11 – 15 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 2570 space . Other work has focused on helping users to save information they find during an exploratory search . For example , Morris et al . [ 28 ] developed a tool called the SearchBar that recorded search histories and allowed users to organize and annotate saved infor - mation . Donato et al . [ 15 ] developed the SearchPad to help users take notes and keep track of information found for different search tasks . SearchPanel [ 36 ] was developed as a browser extension to help users navigate and re - find information . Prior work has also explored tools to help users with the process of document triage – reviewing a set of results to quickly determine which documents are of the most importance [ 3 – 7 ] . Related research on collaborative search has explored ways to support groups of users who are work - ing together on a complex search task . Tools such as Cerchiamo [ 18 ] , Coagmento [ 19 , 33 ] , CoSearch [ 1 ] , and Querium [ 14 ] have explored methods to support synchronous and asynchronous collaboration , division of search labor , and algorithmic mediation of collabora - tion [ 30 ] . A smaller set of research has explored how tools can assist users with synthesis and metacogitive activities during search . For exam - ple , Hearst and Degler [ 23 ] developed a tool to assist analysts with sensemaking tasks that allowed users to easily create groupings of saved search results . Digital IdeaKeeper [ 41 ] was a tool designed to support and encourage planning , searching , analyzing and synthe - sizing information in an educational context . The Visual Knowledge Builder ( VKB ) [ 3 , 34 ] allowed users to collect and organize informa - tion using spatial hypertext , but was not integrated directly into a search system . Stadtler and Bromme [ 35 ] developed an innovative tool called met . a . ware that prompted users to engage in specific metacognitive activities during a web search task . Results showed that met . a . ware’s metacognitive prompts led to increases in users’ post - task knowledge . Our focus in developing and evaluating the OrgBox tool pre - sented here is to provide users with features to support informa - tion organization / synthesis , and also to encourage metacognitive activities such as planning their search process ( e . g . next steps ) , monitoring their search progress , and evaluating the information that has been found . 3 ORGBOX The OrgBox ( Figure 1 ) was developed to provide support to users during exploratory search tasks . In the subsections below , we de - scribe how specific OrgBox features were designed to support the cognitive and metacognitive activities involved in exploratory search tasks . To illustrate the OrgBox features , Figure 2 shows a situation where a user has a landing page open in the window on the left and the OrgBox tool open in a window on the right . Text can be selected from the landing page and then drag - dropped into one of the OrgBox boxes . Support for cognitive activities . Exploratory searches involve complex cognitive activities including discovery , learning , and syn - thesis [ 26 , 39 ] . As described below , we designed OrgBox features to assist users with externalizing knowledge structures , saving infor - mation , and editing , annotating , and organizing saved information . Externalizing knowledge structures – Users could externalize ( and update ) their current knowledge structures by creating and modi - fying “boxes” in which they could place information items . Boxes could be created by clicking the green " Create New Box " button at the top of the page ( Figure 2 ) , and then giving the box a title . Boxes could be used to group and organize information as it was found . Saving found information – Users could save information by highlighting text in an article and performing a drag and drop operation to move the text into a box . When the text was dropped , it would create an item at the bottom of the box . If the text was dropped into an open space in the OrgBox window , a new box would be created with the item inside . Each item includes the highlighted text and a hyperlink to the article . Items could also be manually created by clicking the " Manually Create Item " button at the top of each box ( Figure 1 , right ) . Text from landing pages could be copy / pasted into an OrgBox while an item was being created or edited . Editing information – Users could click on the green wrench icon to the right of an item to open it for editing ( Figure 1 , right ) . This would temporary replace the item in the box with a form that allowed users to edit the title , URL , text , or note ( Figure 3 ) . Users could also remove the item by clicking on the red “X” icon . Removing an item would remove any items nested underneath . Boxes could also be edited or removed using their respective wrench and “X” icons . Annotating information – The OrgBox also allowed users to add a note ( annotation ) to save with each item ( Figure 3 ) . In the main Org - Box display , notes ( if present ) were shown below the information item next to a yellow “note” icon ( Figure 1 , right ) . These annotations could be used to provide context about why an item was saved , how the information relates previously collected information , or to highlight how the information might be useful in the future . Organizing information – Users could change the positions of the boxes ( and items within the boxes ) to represent relationships and / or orderings . As each box was dragged , other boxes would reposition themselves to show how the boxes would be arranged on drop . The boxes were designed to not overlap , but to automatically re - flow into a grid layout after every state change . In addition , items could be moved within and between boxes . As each item was dragged , a green placeholder showed how the dragged item would be positioned on drop . Users could create hierarchies of items by dragging elements to nest them underneath other items . Items that were nested below another would be indented further than the parent item ( Figure 1 , right ) . Item hierarchies could be 3 levels deep . Support for metacognitive activities . Metacognition is often referred to as “thinking about thinking” [ 17 ] and includes activities such as planning , monitoring , evaluation , and reflection . Metacog - nitive activities play important roles in learning [ 2 ] . Our goal with the OrgBox was to incorporate features designed to support and encourage users to engage in metacognitive activities during search . Planning – The structuring features of the OrgBox tool ( boxes , items , nesting , repositioning ) can be used to help support users in planning their search process . For example , at the beginning of their search , users could create boxes for sub - topics that they planned to search for based on their initial understanding of the topic . Later , when users discover new sub - topics , they could create new boxes to act as reminders / placeholders for follow - up searches they planned to conduct . In our user studies ( Section 5 ) , we observed the OrgBox being used for exactly these types of planning behaviors .

Thetopitemhasanote ( annotation ) . Thebottomitemisnestedundertheitemabove . Drag and Drop Creates Item with highlighted text , article title , and article URL Edit Item Also allows user to enter a note Figure2 : OrgBoxtool - draganddroppingthehighlightedtextfromthearticlecreatesan itemwiththetext , articletitle , andarticleURL . Monitoring and Tracking – The boxes and delineated items pro - vided a visual overview of collected information . Using boxes to separate sub - topics from one another allowed users to track how much information they had collected for each and to understand how far along in their search process they were . Users could clearly see what articles the information they collected was sourced from ( e . g . , was a breadth of sources used ? ) and how much information was collected for each sub - topic ( e . g . , was there enough information collected about each sub - topic ? ) . Evaluating and Reflection – With the collected information , users could see how information items might be related to each other ( e . g . , using the information item hierarchy ) , and how important each sub - topic might be to the overall goal ( e . g . , the order and position of the boxes ) . By showing users a visual display of the information they had found and how they had currently organized it , the OrgBox encouraged users to reflect on the information they found and how it fit into their broader understanding of the topic . As noted earlier , Drag and Drop Creates Item with highlighted text , article title , and article URL Edit Item Also allows user to enter a note Figure3 : Editinganinformationitem . Theeditformalsoallowsuserstoenteranote . in our user studies ( Section 5 ) , participants reported using OrgBox features in exactly this way . Revising and Updating – The OrgBox enabled users to revise and update their knowledge structures through the relabeling or re - ordering of the boxes and through the reordering and re - positioning of the items . By creating new boxes , removing boxes , and moving items between boxes , users are able to externalize the changes that occur to their understanding of the topic and sub - topics . 4 IMPLEMENTATION The OrgBox and our search system were developed using Lucene , JS / JQuery , HTML , CSS , and PHP . These systems were supported on the back - end with a MySQL database for storage and retrieval . Demonstration Paper II SIGIR ’21 , July 11 – 15 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 2572 4 . 1 Search System and Article Corpora The search system was comprised of three parts : 1 ) the search en - gine and interface , 2 ) the news article corpora , and 3 ) the integrated article landing pages . Our system allowed participants to issue key - word queries and displayed results in a standard format with 10 results per page . The system logged all user interactions , including clicks , mouse events , and queries . Lucene 2 was used to power the the back - end search . In our two user studies , our corpora included : the TREC Washington Post Corpus 3 ( used in Study 1 ) and the LDC New York Times Corpus 4 ( used in Study 2 ) . The landing pages for the articles were programmed so that when a user copy / pasted or drag - dropped information from the landing page to the OrgBox tool , the respective titles and URLs were automatically transferred to the OrgBox through JS event listeners and dataTransfer functions . 4 . 2 OrgBox The OrgBox was built to record participant interactions with all page elements ( e . g . , clicks and mouseovers ) and their use of the tool functions ( e . g . , creates , edits , reorders ) . To achieve the nesting of the information items , the JQuery sortable function was extended through the NestedSortable . js plugin 5 , allowing for the items to be structured into 3 - level hierarchies . The OrgBox was refined based on pilot study sessions to implement new features , incorporate participant feedback , and fix issues that arose from those sessions . The biggest change based on pilot testing was the integration of the Packery . js library 6 to facilitate grid layout organization and reordering for the boxes . This was implemented to prevent ele - ment overlap which occasionally prevented certain features from being visible and to make the OrgBox a more responsive tool to accommodate a variety of monitor configurations and resolutions . 5 OBSERVED BENEFITS We conducted two complimentary studies to investigate the Org - Box’s impact on participants’ cognitive and metacognitive activi - ties during exploratory searches . In both studies , participants were given a scenario in which they were asked to imagine that they were writing a paper on a complex topic and needed to do research us - ing an archive of news articles 3 , 4 . While they searched , we logged all participant interactions with the search system and OrgBox tool . We also administered questionnaires and interviews about participants’ experiences . Study 1 [ 10 ] compared the OrgBox to a baseline bookmarking tool . Participants completed one task using the OrgBox and one task using the bookmarking tool . Quantitative and qualitative anal - ysis showed that the OrgBox helped support both cognitive and metacognitive activities . In terms of cognitive activities , we ob - served numerous instances where participants used the OrgBox to : ( 1 ) explore topics in parallel during their search , ( 2 ) organize their information , ( 3 ) create connections among concepts , and ( 4 ) struc - ture their task output . In terms of metacognitive activities , we ob - served instances where the OrgBox helped them to : ( 1 ) think about 2 https : / / lucene . apache . org / 3 https : / / trec . nist . gov / data / wapost / 4 https : / / catalog . ldc . upenn . edu / LDC2008T19 5 https : / / github . com / ilikenwf / nestedSortable 6 https : / / packery . metafizzy . co / their task output and plan their searches ; ( 2 ) monitor the breath and depth of collected information - often influencing succeeding search activities [ 32 ] ; and ( 3 ) revise / update their understanding of the collected information through restructuring and relabeling the boxes and items ( which is considered to be an important part of learning during a search process [ 38 ] ) . Study 2 [ 12 ] compared the OrgBox to a Google Doc - style note - taking tool . Participants completed one task using the OrgBox and another task using the note - taking tool . Quantitative analysis of post - task questionnaire data showed that the OrgBox provided greater support for cognitive activities ( understanding and synthe - sizing ) and for metacognitive activities ( monitoring / tracking and evaluating ) than the baseline text - based note - taking tool . Qualita - tive analysis confirmed these results and showed that participants used features of the OrgBox to support specific activities including creating structure , getting a visual overview of collected infor - mation , planning searches , and keeping track of the amount of information they found . Together , the results from these two studies show that tools such as the OrgBox can provide substantial cognitive and metacognitive support to users during exploratory searches . 6 DISCUSSION Cognitive psychology research has argued that externalizing knowl - edge structures can assist users with storing , structuring , utilizing , and acquiring knowledge [ 24 , 29 ] . Researchers in sense - making and knowledge structures have argued for tighter integration of IR systems and knowledge representations tools [ 31 ] . Similarly , the “search as learning” community in information retrieval investigates how learning during search occurs and how it can be supported by search interfaces and tools [ 11 , 16 , 20 ] . Our OrgBox tool was designed to assist users performing ex - ploratory search by providing features that support both cognitive ( creating structure and saving , editing , annotating , and organizing information ) and metacognitive ( planning , monitoring / tracking , evaluating / reflecting , and revising / updating ) benefits through in - tegrating this tool with the underlying search system . In two user studies , the OrgBox outperformed and was preferred over con - ventional bookmarking and note - taking tools . In addition to the benefits provided to the users , integrating tools such as the OrgBox with the underlying search system could provide additional infor - mation that the search engine could use to understand the users’ current goals and sub - tasks . 7 CONCLUSION In this paper , we introduced the OrgBox , a search - assistance tool designed to aid users in cognitive and metacognitive activities while performing exploratory search tasks . Two separate user studies found that the OrgBox provided benefits over baseline bookmarking and text - based note - taking tools . Our OrgBox implementation logs a rich set of interaction data that can provide insights about how users externalize their knowledge structures and search processes when they do exploratory searches . Results from our work suggest that tools such as the OrgBox can provide substantial support for users engaged in exploratory search tasks .
