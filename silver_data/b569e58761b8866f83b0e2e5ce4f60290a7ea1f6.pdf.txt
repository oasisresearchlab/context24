Senescent cells do not proliferate in response to exogenous growth factors , yet the number and affin - ity of growth factor receptors on the cell surface appear to be similar to presenescent cell populations . To deter - mine whether a defect in receptor signaling exists , we analyzed human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HU - VEC ) since HUVEC growth is absolutely dependent upon the presence of FGF . We report that in both pre - senescent and senescent HUVEC populations , FGF - 1 induces the expression of cell cycle - specific genes , sug - gesting that functional FGF receptor ( FGFR ) may exist on the surface of these cells . However , the tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR - 1 substrates , Src and cortac - tin , is impaired in senescent HUVEC , and only the pre - senescent cell populations exhibit a FGF - l - dependent Src tyrosine kinase activity . Moreover , we demonstrate that senescent HUVEC are unable to migrate in re - sponse to FGF - 1 , and these data correlate with an al - tered organization of focal adhesion sites . These data suggest that the induction of gene expression is insuffi - cient to promote a proliferative or migratory pheno - type in senescent HUVEC and that the attenuation of the FGFR - 1 signal transduction pathway may be in - volved in the inability of senescent HUVEC to prolifer - ate and / or migrate . ARLY studies of cellular senescence have demon - strated that the in vitro lifespan of human diploid fibroblasts is finite and is a function of the cumula - tive population doublings ( 17 , 35 , 47 ) . These phenomena have been associated with different cell types , and the hu - man endothelial cell presents an interesting alternative for the study of cellular senescence in vitro . Unlike the fibro - blast , the human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HU - VEC ) 1 is absolutely dependent upon the presence of FGF for in vitro proliferation and serial propagation ( 26 ) . It is well established that senescent HUVEC are refractory to the mitogenic potential of FGF ( 46 ) . Further , it has been demonstrated that although FGF is a potent mitogen for HUVEC , its function is antagonized in the presence of the cytokine interleukin ( IL ) - I ( 6 , 30 ) , and IL - la may act in - Address all correspondence to Dr .

Indeed , this labo - ratory has shown that an exaggerated level of intracellular IL - la exists in senescent HUVEC ( 15 ) , which may func - tion to repress FGF - l - induced HUVEC growth in senes - cent populations ( 27 ) . The fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) signaling pathway has been defined ( 12 ) and includes the tyrosine kinase activation of the FGFR and subsequent phosphoty - rosine modification of a variety of intracellular substrates , including Src ( 51 , 53 ) . Src , a member of a family of cytoso - lic tyrosine kinases , is thought to be involved in signal transduction events underlying growth control ( 5 ) . The protein kinase activity of Src is negatively regulated when tyrosine 527 is phosphorylated by another tyrosine kinase , Csk ( 28 , 31 , 33 , 39 ) . It has been suggested that Csk medi - ates the activity of Src through its own SH2 and SH3 do - mains , and these are required to target Csk to sites where Src is active ( 18 ) . In addition , the phosphorylation of Src Y527 as well as the SH2 and SH3 domains in the amino terminus of Src have been identified as important regula - tory regions responsible for the redistribution of Src from cellular membranes to focal adhesion sites ( 21 , 22 ) . Be - cause several Src substrates are localized to focal adhesion sites ( 41 ) , the redistribution of activated Src suggests it may play a role in the regulation of cell adhesion . Indeed , it has recently been shown that Src can function during the early stages of fibronectin - mediated cellular adhesion of Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525196108178319 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 134 , Number 3 , August 1996 783 - 791 783 fibroblasts ( 23 ) . Further , although focal adhesions have been shown to be associated with stationary cells , they also will form at the leading edge of motile cells ( 3 ) , suggesting that Src may also function in the regulation of cell migra - tion , and an increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the fo - cal adhesions of migrating HUVEC has been observed ( 38 ) . In addition , a Src - dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins , includ - ing cortactin ( 45 ) , has also been demonstrated . Cortactin is a filamentous ( F ) - actin binding protein that contains an SH3 domain and can be phosphorylated on both serine / threonine and tyrosine residues ( 49 , 50 ) . Our laboratory identified murine cortactin as a substrate for Src and dem - onstrated an association between cortactin and Src during the entire G1 phase of cell cycle after activation of Balb / c 3T3 cells by FGF - 1 ( 52 , 53 ) . Thus , the FGF - 1 signal trans - duction pathway appears to include the association and phosphorylation of FGFR - 1 and Src and the association of Src with cortactin , and these events may affect cellular pro - liferation , migration , and cytoskeletal properties . Although senescent cells do not proliferate in response to exogenous growth factors , the number and affinity of growth factor receptors appear to be similar in presenes - cent and senescent populations ( 7 , 10 , 36 , 43 ) . However , in senescent WI - 38 fibroblasts , Fos transcription in response to serum ( 42 ) and the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( 4 ) have been shown to be compromised , suggesting that a defect in receptor signaling may exist . To determine the nature of such a defect , we analyzed HUVEC populations since HUVEC growth is absolutely dependent upon the pres - ence of exogenous FGF ( 26 ) . We observed an induction of cell cycle - specific genes in response to FGF - 1 in both early and late passage cells , suggesting that a functional FGFR may be present on the surface of these cells . How - ever , analysis of the ability of the FGFR to induce the ty - rosine phosphorylation of its substrates revealed that al - though presenescent HUVEC populations were able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and cortactin in response to FGF - 1 , senescent HUVEC were unable to do so . Further , the presenescent HUVEC exhibited a FGF - 1 - dependent Src tyrosine kinase activity , but senescent cells revealed a baseline level of kinase activity that was inde - pendent of the presence of FGF - 1 . These data suggest that the inability of senescent HUVEC to respond to FGF - 1 may involve a defect downstream and / or independent of receptor binding and activation of gene expression . Fur - ther , we were able to demonstrate that senescent HUVEC were unable to migrate in response to FGF - 1 , which corre - lated with prominent focal adhesion sites . Thus , despite the ability of the FGFR to signal gene expression in senes - cent HUVEC , the FGF - 1 - - dependent proliferative and mi - gratory responses appear to be compromised , and these responses may involve the inability of the cells to use the FGFR pathway to signal the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and the inability of Src to phosphorylate cortactin . Materials and Methods Cell Culture HUVECs , strain H3605 , used in these experiments were a generous gift from M . Gimbrone ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . HUVECs were serially passaged at 1 : 5 split ratios in medium 199 ( RHJ Biosciences , Lenexa , KS ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS , heparin ( Upjohn , Kalamazoo , MI ; 5 U / ml ) , lx antibiotic - antimycotic ( GIBCO , BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) , and crude bovine FGF - 1 ( 150 ~ xg / ml ) in cell culture dishes coated with fibronectin ( 5 ~ g / cm2 ) . Human fibronectin and crude preparations of bovine FGF - I were prepared as previously described ( 26 ) . At each passage , the cells were trypsinized when confluent , counted in a hemacytometer , and seeded at known cell densities . The population dou - bling level was calculated as described ( 26 ) . Cells with < 25 cumulative population doublings ( CPDs ) were considered presenescent and cells with more than 60 CPDs were considered senescent . The senescent cells used in these experiments completed 90 - 95 % of their lifespan and were main - tained in culture for at least 7 d without an increase in cell number . Fur - ther , in situ labeling experiments were performed according to the meth - ods of Stein et al . ( 44 ) . To determine the labeling index , 3Hthymidine - positive nuclei were counted in 10 or 20 fields in presenescent or senescent cells , respectively . The presenescent HUVEC ( CPD 24 ) had 85 % of the nuclei labeled , whereas in the near - senescent populations ( CPD 65 ) , only 8 % of the nuclei were labeled . RNA Extraction , Northern Blot Analysis , and Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA was extracted from HUVEC monolayers by the guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure as described ( 14 ) . RNA ( 10 I ~ g ) was separated on 0 . 8 % agarose gels and capillary - blotted onto Zeta - Probe nylon mem - branes ( BioRad Labs , Hercules , CA ) . 3Zp - labeled eDNA probes were hybridized to the RNA at 65Â°C for 18 h . The membranes were washed at high stringency and exposed on Kodak X - AR film ( Rochester , NY ) at - 80Â°C . The Fos and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) cDNAs were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) . The histone 3 . 2 ( H3 ) eDNA was a generous gift from J . Campisi ( Berkley , CA ) , and the human ornithine decarhoxylase ( ODC ) eDNA was provided by J . K . deRiel ( Temple University , Philadelphia , PA ) . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) was per - formed using 1 I ~ g total RNA as described ( 14 ) . The eDNA was diluted with 1 - t20 to 500 txl and PCR was performed with 5 I ~ 1 of each sample am - plified by denaturation at 94Â°C for 1 min , annealed at 54Â°C for 2 rain , and elongated at 72Â°C for 3 min using 35 cycles for the FGFR family and 32 cy - cles for GAPDH . Specific primer sequences for each gene were as follows : FGFR - I : sense : 5 ' - AAGGACAAACCCAACCGTGTGACC - 3 ' , antisense : 5 ' - CCCAAAGTCTGCTATCYrCATCAC ~ 3 ' ; FGFR - 2 : sense : 5 ' - CTGTG - CCGAATGAAGAACACGACC - 3 ' , antisense : 5 ' - CCCAAAGTCTGC - TATCTFCATCAC - 3 ' ; FGFR - 3 : sense : 5 ' - TGAGGACACAGGTGTGG - ACACAGG - 3 ' , antisense : 5 ' - TCTGCCGGATGCTGCCAA ACTTGT - 3 ' ; FGFR - 4 : sense : 5 ' - CTCGCCGGCCTCGTGAGTCTAGAT - 3 ' , antisense : 5 ' - CCCAAAGTCTGCTATCTTCATCAC - 3 ' ; GAPDH : sense : 5 ' - CCA - CCCATGGCAAATI ' CCATGGCA - 3 ' , antisense : 5 ' - TCT AGACGGCA - GGTCAGGTCCACC - 3 ' . lmmunoprecipitation and Western Blot or In Vitro Kinase Analysis Presenescent and senescent populations of HUVEC were incubated for 7 . 5 h in media lacking FGF - 1 and heparin and containing 3 % FBS and 20 ng / ml PMA . The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for a to - tal of 24 or 48 h in media containing 1 . 5 % FBS . FGF - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) and he - parin ( 10 p ~ g / ml ) were added for the indicated times and the cells were scraped into t ml PBS and collected by centrifugation ( 5 s ) . The cell pel - lets were lysed in 1 ml RIPA ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaC1 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) con - taining 1 mM PMSF , 2 ixg / ml aprotinin , I0 IJ , g / ml leupeptin , and 1 mM Na3VO4 and incubated on ice for 5 min . The cell lysates were centrifuged at 4Â°C for 10 min and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes . Specific antibodies were incubated with cell lysates and rotated at 4Â°C for 1 h followed by the addition of 20 Ixl Protein A - Sepharose ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc . , Piscataway , NJ ) and rotation at 4Â°C for 1 h . The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA b ~ ffer , dissolved in SDS - sample buffer ( 125 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS710 % glycerol , 0 . 001 % bromophenol blue ) , and resolved by SDS - PAGE using 7 . 5 % ( wt / vol ) acrylamide gels . The proteins were transferred to 0 . 2 ~ m nitrocellu - lose membranes , and Western blot analysis was performed with specific antibodies in Tris - buffered saline ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 137 mM NaCI , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) containing either 5 % milk ( Src - 2 blots ) or 5 % The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 134 , 1996 784 BSA ( phosphotyrosine blots ) using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amer - sham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) according to the manufacturer ' s in - structions . To analyze the tyrosine kinase activity of Src , in vitro kinase assays were performed . The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with Src - specific antibodies as described above , washed with kinase buffer ( 30 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM MnCI2 ) , and then incubated in 50 ixl kinase buffer containing 2 p . g acid - denatured enolase ( Sigma lmmunochemicals , St . Louis , MO ) and 10 p . Ci ~ / 32pATP for 10 rain at room temperature . The phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography of dried 10 % ( wt / vol ) polyacrylamide gels following SDS - PAGE . Antibodies The antibodies for immunoblot analysis included : ( a ) polyclonal rabbit anti - human Src ( N - 16 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , an antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the unique residues 3 - 18 within the amino terminus of the human Src gene and used for Src immunoprecipitation ; ( b ) Src - 2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Src and cross - reactive with Yes and Fyn and used for Src Western blot analysis ; ( c ) monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine ( Upstate Biotechnology Inc . , Lake Placid , NY ) used for Western blot analysis ; ( d ) polyclonal rab - bit anti - mouse cortactin antisera 2719 , generated from a peptide antigen ( residues 343 - 362 of murine eortactin ) injected into rabbits and used for immunoprecipitation of cortaetin protein ( 52 ) ; and ( e ) anticortactin antis - era 001 , generated from recombinant murine cortactin expressed as a glu - tathione S - transferase fusion protein and used for Western blot analysis of cortactin ( 53 ) . HUVEC Migration Assays Monolayers of early and late passage HUVEC were wounded as previ - ously described ( 40 ) . Briefly , confluent monolayers were scraped with a razor blade and cellular debris was removed by washing with PBS . The monolayers were incubated for 16 - 20 h at 37Â°C in medium 199 containing 10 % FBS alone ( control ) or supplemented with FGF - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) , hep - arin ( 10 ~ g / ml ) , rIL - lc ~ ( 10 ng / ml ) , IL - 1 receptor antagonist IRAP ; ( 100 ng / ml ) , or PMA ( 20 ng / ml ) as indicated in the text . The cells were then fixed in 25 % acetic acid / 75 % methanol and stained with hematoxylin ( Sigma Immunochemicals ) . The number of ceils migrating from the wound origin was counted with a light microscope at 100 magnification us - ing a grid . The values represent the mean of five fields , and three separate experiments have been performed with each condition tested in duplicate . Immunofluorescence Presenescent and senescent HUVEC were plated on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin , incubated for 24 h in medium 199 containing 10 % FBS , lX antibiotic - antimycotic , 10 ng / ml FGF - 1 and 10 ixg / ml heparin , and then fixed in ice - cold acetone . The coverslips were dried , incubated in immunofluorescence - blocking buffer ( PBS containing 5 % bovine serum albumin , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % NAN3 ) for 1 h , washed three times with PBS , and incubated 1 h with antibody diluted 1 : 50 in PBS ( monoclonal antivinculin antibody Sigma Immunochemicals ; mono - clonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody Upstate Biotechnology Inc . ; and rabbit antiserum for the fibronectin receptor Â¢t5 ~ 1 , a gift from S . Ar - graves , Holland Laboratory ) . The coverslips were washed three times in PBS , incubated 30 min in fluorescein - conjugated goat anti - mouse or anti - rabbit antibodies , washed three times in PBS , and embedded in 50 % glyc - erol with 0 . 1 % phenylenediamine . The cells were photographed with a fluorescence microscope at 600 magnification ( Olympus Corp . , Lake Suc - cess , NY ) . Results Expression of Cell Cycle - Specific Genes in Presenescent and Senescent HUVEC It has been suggested that a defect in receptor signaling may exist in senescent cell populations ( 4 ) . Because HU - VEC are absolutely dependent upon the presence of FGF - 1 for proliferation , we have studied the FGF - l - signaling pathway in senescent HUVEC to better understand the processes that may be involved in regulating cellular se - nescence in vitro . There are currently four FGFR genes that have been identified ( 12 ) . RT - PCR analysis of the steady state level of the FGFR gene family demonstrated that the primary gene , which is expressed at similar levels in both presenescent and senescent HUVEC populations , is the FGFR - 1 transcript ( Fig . 1 C ) . The total number of FGFR - 1 on the surface of HUVEC is extremely low ( 13 ) and is not detectable using standard methods of FGFR im - munoprecipitation followed by either immunoblot analy - sis or by an in vitro kinase assay ( data not shown ) . Thus , we have chosen to study the functional aspects of FGFR - 1 signaling through the expression of immediate - early ( IME ) and mid - to - late ( MTL ) cell cycle - dependent genes . This approach was taken because cell cycle - specific gene expression has been used as a marker for the progression of cells through the Gt and S phases in response to growth factors ( 32 , 42 ) . Early and late passage HUVEC were made quiescent in media lacking FGF - 1 and heparin , and then treated with FGF - 1 for the indicated times ( Fig . 1 ) . Northern blot analysis revealed that both HUVEC popu - lations treated with FGF - 1 and cycloheximide ( chx ) dem - onstrated a superinduction of the IME gene , Fos , as com - pared to the induction with chx alone ( Fig . 1 A ) . Because Northern blots are not as sensitive as PCR , we used chx to visualize the very low level of Fos mRNA in HUVEC ( Fig . 1 A ) ; however , these results are consistent with RT - PCR in which an induction of Fos mRNA was also observed in presenescent and senescent populations treated with FGF - 1 alone ( data not shown ) . In addition , we analyzed the mRNA expression of the MTL genes , ODC and H3 , and found that ODC was induced in response to FGF - 1 in two different strains of early and late passage HUVEC ( Fig . 1 B ) . Further , although the steady state level of H3 mRNA appears to be decreased in the senescent HUVEC popula - tions , a FGF - 1 induction was observed in the presenescent and senescent cells from both strains ( Fig . 1 B ) . Thus , it appears that FGF - 1 is capable of signaling an induction of gene expression through the FGFR - 1 on the surface of presenescent , as well as senescent , HUVEC populations . The FGF - 1 - - dependent Tyrosine Phosphorylation of FGFR - 1 Substrates and FGF - l - dependent Tyrosine Kinase Activity of Src Is Impaired in Senescent HUVEC The results described above imply that the functional properties of the FGFR - 1 in senescent HUVEC are not impaired . However , FGF - 1 mutants and FGF - 1 chimera proteins have shown that FGFR - binding activity and pro - tooncogene expression can occur without mitogenic activ - ity ( 2 , 20 ) and FGF - l - induced DNA synthesis may occur without increases in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation ( 48 ) . Therefore , because the dissociation of cellular events has been described , we questioned whether FGFR - 1 sig - naling was functional for the tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor substrates in presenescent and senescent HU - VEC . Our laboratory previously identified two predomi - nant tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in FGF - l - treated Balb / c 3T3 cells during the MTL G1 phase of the cell cycle with molecular weights of 80 and 60 kD , corresponding to Garfinkel et al . FGF Receptor Signaling in Human Endothelial Cells 785 Figure 1 . Expression of cell cycle - specific genes in presenescent and senescent populations of HU - VEC . ( A ) Presenescent ( young ; Y ) and senescent ( S ) HUVEC monolayers of strain H3605 were starved for 48 h in media lacking FGF - 1 , and then stimulated for 1 or 2 h with FGF - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) , he - parin ( 10 Ixg / ml ) and cycloheximide ( chx ; 10 txg / ml ) , or chx only , as indicated . Total RNA was puri - fied and 10 I ~ g was separated on agarose gels for Northern blot analysis using a 32p - labeled cDNA probe specific for Fos . The filter was stripped and rehybridized to a radiolabeled GAPDH cDNA probe to confirm that each sample contained similar RNA levels . ( B ) Presenescent ( young ; Y ) and senescent ( S ) cells from HUVEC strains H3605 and H928 were starved for 48 h and then stimulated with FGF - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) and heparin ( 10 txg / ml ) for 1 or 24 h . Total RNA was purified and 10 Ixg was separated on agarose gels for Northern blot analysis using ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) or histone 3 . 2 ( H3 ) 32p - labeled cDNA probes . The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to determine the amount of RNA per lane . ( C ) Total RNA was purified from presenescent ( young ; 11 ) and senescent ( S ) HU - VEC monolayers ( strain H3605 ) and used for RT - PCR with sense and antisense primers for the FGFR gene family and GAPDH ( see Materials and Methods ) . The products of amplification were separated on a 1 % agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide . murine cortactin and Src , respectively ( 51 - 53 ) . Immuno - precipitation of presenescent HUVEC populations with a Src - specific antibody followed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis showed a FGF - l - dependent induc - tion of Src tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 2 A ) . Interest - ingly , in several experiments with early passage HUVEC , Src poorly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortac - tin in response to FGF - 1 ( Fig . 2 B ) . In contrast , senescent HUVEC populations were impaired in their ability to in - duce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src in response to FGF - 1 and displayed little if any tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin , despite similar protein levels in both presenes - cent and senescent populations ( Fig . 2 ) . To quantitate these results , the autoradiographs were evaluated by den - sitometric scanning , dividing the intensity of the phosphor - ylated Src or cortactin band by the appropriate protein Figure 2 . The FGF - I - in - duced tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of Src and cortactin is impaired in senescent HU - VEC . Presenescent ( young ; Y ) and senescent ( S ) HU - VEC from strain H3605 were starved for a total of 24 h and then treated with FGF - 1 and heparin for 18 or 24 h as de - scribed in Materials and Methods . The cells were col - lected , lysed , and immuno - precipitated with antibodies specific for ( A ) Src , N - 16 , or ( B ) cortactin , 4 ~ 2719 , as de - scribed in Materials and Methods . The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS - PAGE using 7 . 5 % polyacrylamide gels , and Western blot analysis was per - formed using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( anti - P - Tyr ) , Src antibodies ( anti - Src ) , or cortactin antibodies ( anticortactin ) .

The tyrosine kinase activity of Src is impaired in senes - cent HUVEC . ( A ) Presenescent ( young ) and senescent HUVEC from strain H3605 were starved for a total of 48 h and then treated with FGF - 1 and heparin for 6 h as described in Materials and Methods . The cells were collected , lysed , and immunopre - cipitated with an antibody specific for Src , and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using the substrate enolase . After SDS - PAGE , phosphorylated Src and enolase were visualized by auto - radiography ( upper ) , and the level of Src protein was visualized by Western blot analysis with anti - Src antibodies ( lower ) . ( B ) The specific Src kinase activity was calculated by dividing the in - tensity of the enolase band ( Fig . 3 A , upper ) by the intensity of the Src protein band ( Fig . 3 A , lower , as determined by densito - metric scanning ( Visage version 4 . 6P ; Biolmage , Ann Arbor , MI ) . band . Src tyrosine phosphorylation in early passage HU - VECs was induced sixfold by FGF - 1 as compared to a 1 . 4 - fold induction in senescent cells , whereas a threefold in - duction of the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was observed in early passage HUVEC treated with FGF - 1 as compared to no induction in senescent cells . A second ex - periment showed similar results ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that while senescent HUVEC possess the ability to use the FGFR - 1 pathway to regulate the FGF - 1 - induced mRNA levels of various cell cycle - specific genes , they are impaired in their ability to signal the tyrosine phosphorylation of the FGFR - 1 substrates Src and cortactin . Because it is likely that the FGF - l - signaling pathway in - volves the association of the FGFR - 1 with Src and the as - sociation of Src with cortactin ( 53 ) and the FGF - 1 - - depen - dent tyrosine phosphorylation of Src was impaired in senescent HUVEC , we analyzed the activity of Src in pre - senescent and senescent HUVEC populations using an in vitro kinase assay . Immunoprecipitation of Src followed by an in vitro kinase assay using the substrate enolase demonstrated that a FGF - 1 - - dependent induction of Src kinase activity was observed in the early passage HUVEC ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , Src - specific immunoprecipitation from senescent HUVEC populations revealed that a low level of Src tyrosine kinase activity was independent of the presence of FGF - 1 . The specific Src kinase activity calcu - lated by dividing the intensity of the enolase band by the intensity of the Src protein band revealed a baseline level of Src tyrosine kinase activity in the presenescent un - treated , as well as the senescent , HUVEC populations ( Fig . 3 B ) . We evaluated the phosphorylation of enolase as a measure of specific Src tyrosine kinase activity because the autophosphorylation of Src has been inconsistent in many experiments performed and was often too low to ac - curately quantitate . Despite the levels of phosphorylated Src observed in Fig . 3 A , which by densitometric scanning shows a twofold induction by FGF - 1 in both cell popula - tions , we hesitate to state that this is a specific FGF - 1 ef - fect because of the inconsistencies that we have observed . Thus , in senescent HUVEC , Src is unable to phosphory - late its substrate cortactin but shows a baseline level of en - zymatic activity to phosphorylate enolase , which is inde - pendent of the presence of FGF - 1 . Senescent HUVEC Do Not Migrate in Response to FGF - 1 , Which Correlates with Prominent Focal Adhesion Sites It has been determined that inhibition of migration of hu - man fibroblasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells occurs during in vitro senescence ( 1 , 24 , 29 , 34 ) . Because we have established that senescent HUVEC are defective in their ability to induce the phosphotyrosine of FGFR - 1 sub - strates and an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation has been observed in migrating HUVEC ( 38 ) , we questioned whether senescent HUVEC were capable of migration in response to FGF - 1 . In addition , because our previous re - suits demonstrated that senescent HUVEC exhibited ele - vated levels of IL - lct ( 15 ) , we also analyzed the ability of early passage HUVEC to respond to IL - let as a chemoat - tractant . While FGF - 1 was able to elicit a migratory re - sponse in presenescent HUVEC populations , neither IL - let Garfinkel et al . FGF Receptor Signaling in Human Endothelial Cells 787 T do not migrate in response to FGF - 1 and exhibit an abun - dance of focal adhesion sites . ( A ) Presenescent ( Young ) and senescent HUVEC mono - layers from strain H3605 were used for migration as - says as described in Material and Methods . The number of cells migrating from the wound origin were counted with a light microscope at 100 magnification using a grid , and the values represent the mean of five fields with each condition tested in duplicate and three separate experi - ments performed . ( B ) Prese - nescent ( Young ) and senes - cent HUVEC were processed for immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods . The cells were pho - tographed with a fluores - cence microscope at 600 mag - nification ( Olympus Corp , ) . Presenescent ( Young ; A , C , E ) and senescent ( B , D , F ) HUVEC were stained with antibodies for the human fi - bronectin receptor ( a5131 ; A and B ) , phosphotyrosine ( C and D ) , and vinculin ( E and F ) . nor PMA alone had this effect ( Fig . 4 A ) . In addition , the effect of FGF - 1 on presenescent populations was inhibited in the presence of IL - let , and these effects were specifi - cally reversed by IRAP ( 9 ) , an antagonist of IL - let action , whereas PMA inhibited the FGF - l - induced migration re - gardless of the presence of IRAP . Moreover , FGF - 1 was unable to induce the migration of senescent HUVEC . In general , a decrease in cell motility correlates with The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 134 , 1996 788 prominent local adhesions ( 19 ) . Thtls , the inability of senes : cent HUVEC to migrate in response to FGF - 1 prompted us to investigate the distribution of focal adhesion sites ( FAS ) in presenescent and senescent HUVEC popula - tions . Because HUVEC in culture are strongly dependent on fibronectin for their adherence ( 26 ) and the fibronectin receptor ( a5131 ) has been implicated in mediating cell mi - gration ( 19 ) , we used immunofluorescence techniques to analyze its distribution . As compared to presenescent HU - VEC populations , senescent HUVEC demonstrated an al - tered distribution of fibronectin receptor - positive FAS ( Fig . 4 B ) . The prominent FAS in senescent HUVEC were also demonstrated using antibodies against either vinculin , a protein associated with FAS , or phosphotyrosine . Thus , an altered organization of the expression of FAS in senes - cent HUVEC is consistent with the inability of these cells to elicit a migratory response . Discussion The HUVEC is absolutely dependent upon the presence of extracellular FGF for in vitro proliferation and serial propagation ( 26 ) ; however , senescent HUVEC are refrac - tory to the mitogenic potential of FGF ( 46 ) . Because the nonproliferative senescent phenotype may result from de - fective signaling of the FGFR and aspects of the FGFR - signaling pathway have been defined in established mu - rine cell lines ( 12 ) , we analyzed normal diploid HUVEC populations for their ability to elicit a response to FGF - 1 . Although four FGFR family members exist , FGFR - 1 is the primary transcript expressed in HUVEC . Because the level of the FGFR - 1 on the surface of HUVEC is ex - tremely low and not detectable by available methods , we examined the ability of FGF - 1 to induce the expression of cell cycle - specific genes ( 32 , 42 ) and the tyrosine phosphor - ylation of well - characterized FGFR - 1 substrates ( 51 - 53 ) . The expression of the IME and MTL genes , Fos , ODC , and H3 , was induced in both early and late passage cells treated with FGF - 1 . Our results are consistent with one re - port demonstrating the serum inducibility of cell cycle - spe - cific genes in senescent human diploid fibroblasts ( 37 ) . However , they contradict other reports that reveal the lack of serum inducibility in senescent fibroblasts ( 32 , 42 ) , suggesting that human endothelial cells and fibroblasts ex - hibit different cellular responses to growth factors and cy - tokines . H3 expression is usually tightly coupled to DNA synthesis , but it has been suggested that for cells to traverse the G1 phase of the cell cycle , a series of events is required and multiple pathways may act simultaneously ( 37 ) . Therefore , it may be possible to induce the expres - sion of G1 or S phase - specific genes in senescent cells , but additional signals are required for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation . Indeed , we have previously demonstrated that maximal DNA synthesis of Balb / c 3T3 cells required the presence of FGF - 1 throughout the entire G ~ period and withdrawal of FGF - 1 , or the addition of a tyrosine ki - nase inhibitor in late G1 , resulted ina significant reduction of DNA synthesis ( 51 ) . In that regard , we have studied the tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR - 1 substrates in prese - nescent and senescent HUVEC . Our data suggest that un - like presenescent populations , senescent ceils are impaired in their ability to induce the FGF - 1 - - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Src or cortactin and the tyrosine kinase activity of Src is not induced by FGF - 1 . Furthermore , we have shown that FGF - 1 does not stimulate the migration of senescent HUVEC , which correlates with prominent FAS as determined by the distribution of the fibronectin receptor , vinculin and phosphotyrosine . Thus , these data imply that the induction of either IME or MTL genes by FGF - 1 is not sufficient to promote a proliferative or mi - gratory phenotype in senescent HUVEC populations . Fur - thermore , the lack of a FGF - l - dependent tyrosine phos - phorylation of Src and cortactin implies that this part of the FGFR signal transduction pathway is impaired in se - nescent cells and may be involved in their inability to pro - liferate and / or migrate . At present , we do not know the mechanisms involved ; however , it is possible that different FGFR - 1 signal transduction pathways exist , one pathway resulting in the induction of gene expression through the FGFR - 1 and another involving intracellular substrates coupled to the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor . In - deed , an analysis of fusion proteins of FGF - 1 and diphthe - ria toxin has suggested that signaling occurs by two path - ways , partly through cell surface receptors and partly by transport of the growth factor into the cell cytosol and / or nucleus ( 48 ) . Furthermore , a dissociation of FGF - l - stimu - lated mitogenesis from its tyrosine kinase activation has also been demonstrated ( 25 ) . Our attempts to define fur - ther the molecular mechanisms involved in the defect in senescent HUVEC have been hampered by the inability to obtain stably transfected HUVEC populations . Presenescent HUVEC populations exhibited a high baseline level of phosphorylated cortactin and revealed that Src was only minimally capable of inducing the phos - phorylation of cortactin in response to FGF - 1 ( Fig . 2 B ) . We have considered several possibilities to explain these data . First , the difficulty in obtaining quiescent early pas - sage HUVEC ( 16 ) may give rise to background levels of ODC and H3 expression in untreated cell populations ( Fig . 1 B ) and baseline levels of Src kinase activity ( Fig . 3 B ) . Thus , the level of cortactin phosphorylation in these cell populations may reflect a residual FGF - 1 effect since it is difficult to completely remove endogenous FGF - 1 from this FGF - 1 - - dependent cell . Second , RT - PCR analysis has demonstrated that the transcripts for the Src family mem - bers Fyn and Yes are expressed in HUVEC ( data not shown ) . Thus , it may be possible that cortactin is a sub - strate for another Src family member that maintains cort - actin in a phosphorylated state in quiescent , presenescent HUVEC . Third , it is known that cortactin has multiple po - tential tyrosine phosphorylation sites ( 50 ) , similar to the phosphorylation of Src at different sites that is associated with its active or inactive form ( 5 ) . The cortactin sites may be differentially phosphorylated to impart different activi - ties , and thus it is possible that the overall level of phos - phorylation changes little in presenescent HUVEC popu - lations treated with FGF - 1 , but the site of phosphorylation is altered . The observation that only 10 - 30 % of the total cortactin becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in Src - trans - formed avian and rodent cells ( 50 ) is consistent with this premise . Fourth , cortactin has been shown to bind F - actin , and this binding appears to be independent of the phos - photyrosine state of the protein ( 49 ) . Thus , the FGF - 1 - activated Src in presenescent HUVEC may alter cortactin in Garfinkel et al . FGF Receptor Signaling in Human Endothelial Cells 789 ways that are not visualized by the phosphotyrosine state of the protein . We consider this final possibility less likely since other studies have shown that increases in tyrosine phosphorylation correlate with cytoskeletal rearrange - ments and the localization of cortactin and F - actin corre - late with the Src - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin ( 38 , 45 ) . The inability of senescent HUVEC to migrate corre - lated with an altered organization of FAS . An inverse cor - relation between migration and FAS organization has also been described for fibroblasts ( 8 ) . Furthermore , alter - ations in the expression of intracellular cytoskeletal pro - teins such as vinculin , which is involved with linking actin filaments to the extracellular matrix through integrins , are known to change migratory potential ( 11 ) . Our results demonstrated the phosphotyrosine - and vinculin - positive FAS were localized at the periphery of early passage HU - VEC . It is generally accepted that the peripheral associa - tion of FAS plays a role in cell migration ( 19 ) . A migratory cell requires the ability to extend and stabilize lamellipo - dium where FAS are present at the cell front and rear ( 19 ) . In the senescent HUVEC , prominent FAS were ran - domly scattered throughout the cytosol , which may act to prevent cell polarization and anchor the cells to impede their migration . In addition , because the intracellular level of IL - let has been shown to be elevated in certain strains of senescent HUVEC ( 15 ) , and exogenous IL - let inhibits FGF - l - induced migration of early passage HUVEC but does not attenuate the FGF - 1 induction of Src tyrosine phosphorylation ( data not shown ) , we suggest that the consequences of elevated intracellular IL - let in senescent HUVEC may not be related to the activation of FGFR - 1 substrates as they pertain to proliferation , but they may be related to the diminished migratory potential of senescent cells . Interestingly , the cytosol of senescent cell FAS seems to be the major area of accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins . Although the precise role of phosphorylated tyrosine residues in cytoskeletal proteins is not fully understood , increases in phosphotyrosine levels have been correlated with changes in the subcellular local - ization of Src and its substrates , and this may alter the structure and biochemical properties of focal adhesion sites , thereby affecting cell adhesion ( 38 ) . However , it has also been shown that despite the importance of Y527 phosphorylation in regulating the localization of Src to focal adhesion sites in established cell lines , the amino terminus alone may be sufficient to position Src in focal adhesions ( 21 ) and Src can effect cellular adhesion in a kinase - indepen - dent manner ( 3 ) . Thus , the inability of the FGFR - 1 to signal Src tyrosine kinase activity in senescent HUVEC may be related to their nonproliferative and / or nonmigratory phe - notype . While it is not known whether similar pathways are involved in HUVEC proliferation and migration , stud - ies on growth factor signaling in human diploid fibroblasts through the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway have demonstrated distinct mitogenic and migratory path - ways ( 19 ) . Alternatively , since presenescent HUVEC pop - ulations may use exogenous FGF - 1 both as a mitogen and as a survival factor , it is also possible that the withdrawal of FGF - 1 from the HUVEC population may initiate an ap - optotic program which may be different from the human fibroblast population .
