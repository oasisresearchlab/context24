However , in many settings it is not clear how acceptable COVID‑19 vaccination is among the general population , or how hesitancy correlates with risk of disease acquisition . In this study we conducted a nationally representative survey in Pakistan to measure vaccination perceptions and social contacts in the context of COVID‑19 control measures and vaccination programmes . Methods We conducted a vaccine perception and social contact survey with 3 , 658 respondents across five prov‑ inces in Pakistan , between 31 May and 29 June 2021 . Respondents were asked a series of vaccine perceptions ques‑ tions , to report all direct physical and non‑physical contacts made the previous day , and a number of other questions regarding the social and economic impact of COVID‑19 and control measures . We examined variation in perceptions and contact patterns by geographic and demographic factors . We describe knowledge , experiences and perceived risks of COVID‑19 . We explored variation in contact patterns by individual characteristics and vaccine hesitancy , and compared to patterns from non‑pandemic periods . Results Self‑reported adherence to self‑isolation guidelines was poor , and 51 % of respondents did not know where to access a COVID‑19 test . Although 48 . 1 % of participants agreed that they would get a vaccine if offered , vaccine hesitancy was higher than in previous surveys , and greatest in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces and among respond‑ ents of lower socioeconomic status . Participants reported a median of 5 contacts the previous day ( IQR : 3 – 5 , mean 14 . 0 , 95 % CI : 13 . 2 , 14 . 9 ) . There were no substantial differences in the number of contacts reported by individual char‑ acteristics , but contacts varied substantially among respondents reporting more or less vaccine hesitancy . Contacts were highly assortative , particularly outside the household where 97 % of men’s contacts were with other men . We estimate that social contacts were 9 % lower than before the COVID‑19 pandemic . Conclusions Although the perceived risk of COVID‑19 in Pakistan is low in the general population , around half of participants in this survey indicated they would get vaccinated if offered . Vaccine impact studies which do not account for correlation between social contacts and vaccine hesitancy may incorrectly estimate the impact of vac‑ cines , for example , if unvaccinated people have more contacts .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 321 Background Over 750 million reported cases and 6 . 8 million deaths from COVID - 19 have been recorded worldwide as of 2023 [ 1 ] . While most recorded cases and deaths initially occurred in high - income countries , a large proportion of the population of these countries is now vaccinated , and focus has increasingly turned to COVID - 19 burden in low - and middle - income ( LMIC ) settings . Despite severe constraints in vaccine supply in LMIC settings , vaccina - tion continues to play a key role in almost all countries’ COVID - 19 response . For example , Pakistan – the focus of this study – has provided a range of COVID - 19 vac - cines developed by Pfizer , AstraZeneca , Sinovac , and Sin - opharm , delivered through the public and private sectors [ 2 ] . As of 29 October 2021 , a few months after the data collection forming the basis of this paper was completed , over 103 million vaccine doses had been administered to the country’s 220 million population , and 40 million people were fully vaccinated ( receiving one dose of one dose regimens , or two doses of two dose regimens ) – a coverage of 18 % [ 2 ] . Yet as supply has increased available vaccine stocks , substantial vaccine hesitancy has been observed worldwide , prompting a range of interventions to address hesitancy and encourage vaccination . In Paki - stan , in July 2021 and in response to growing COVID - 19 cases amid hesitancy , Sindh Province moved to block the SIM cards and social media accounts of unvaccinated residents . Early in the pandemic , many countries introduced extreme physical distancing control measures to control SARS - CoV2 transmission [ 3 ] . Modelling studies sug - gested that without substantial mitigation measures , many LMIC settings , including South Asia , would experi - ence a delayed , but severe epidemic [ 4 , 5 ] . More recently , further modelling studies have been critical in informing vaccine introduction and rollout [ 6 , 7 ] . Two pieces of data are critical for infectious disease models to give accurate projections of epidemic dynamics and vaccine impact : a ) the number and nature of contacts which people have and which may lead to transmission , and b ) the extent to which people will be hesitant in accessing vaccination . The association between social contacts and vaccine hes - itancy is not well identified in the literature . This study aimed to collect and measure these data and explore their association in order to better inform policy responses , for example in recommending whether these factors should be accounted for in infectious disease modelling . To accurately predict the likely impact of control measures , quantitative data on the number and type of contacts between people is required . To - date , few empir - ical studies have been published to assess the impact of COVID - 19 control measures on contacts [ 8 ] , and just one in South Asia [ 9 , 10 ] . This lack of evidence means that SARS - CoV - 2 transmission models for South Asia , including Pakistan , rely on synthetic contact matrices , which use demographic , household composition , class - room size and other data to adjust social contact data from primarily high - income settings [ 11 , 12 ] . Vaccine hesitancy , defined by the SAGE working group as “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services” [ 13 ] , has previously been shown to be higher in Pakistan than other settings [ 14 , 15 ] . The working group’s Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix highlights “contextual , individual and group and vac - cine / vaccination - specific influences” , which may vary at local levels ( for example , the regions that feature in this analysis ) . It is hypothesised that vaccine hesitancy and respon - sivity to other infectious disease control measures may be correlated . For example , the SAGE Working Group’s matrix identifies vaccine complacency as a driver of low vaccine uptake [ 13 ] , potentially reflecting a perception of low risk from COVID - 19 and a parallel insensitivity of behaviour to non - pharmaceutical control measures aiming to limit social contacts . To - date , no study has explored the relationship between social contacts and vaccine hesitancy . This is important as COVID - 19 mod - els which assume homogeneity in vaccine uptake and contact patterns may dramatically under - or over - esti - mate the impact and cost - effectiveness of social distanc - ing and vaccine interventions , leading to incorrect policy decisions . To date , the numbers of recorded cases and deaths in Pakistan are much lower than initial predictions , despite four clear epidemic waves of COVID - 19 in the country and evidence elsewhere in the region of uncontrolled transmission requiring strong non - pharmaceutical inter - vention [ 1 ] . Pakistan’s response was similar to other set - tings , implementing a range of restrictions including on gatherings , closure of educational and municipal build - ings , and suspension of international flights and cross - border travel . As shown by the University of Oxford COVID - 19 Government Response Tracker data in Fig . 1 , these restrictions increased sharply in March 2020 , decreased in intensity over subsequent months , and set - tled at a medium – high intensity in the period since . Panel A demonstrates that Pakistan’s average stringency index [ 3 ] was in the top third of countries worldwide during the survey period , whilst panel C shows that there were few changes to the stringency of control measures during the survey period . In a decentralised policy environment such as Paki - stan , it is critical to understand how vaccination per - ceptions and hesitancy , and patterns of social contacts , vary across provinces to inform whether and how to implement different control measures alongside how to Page 3 of 11 Quaife et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 321 maximise vaccination coverage . In this study , we describe a nationally representative , province - stratified cross - sectional survey of vaccination perceptions and contact patterns among adults in Pakistan . We first describe the health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID - 19 and control measures among the sample . We then summarise COVID - 19 vaccine perceptions and hesitancy and vari - ations across provinces and respondent characteristics . We also summarise how the quantity and type of social contacts vary across respondent characteristics . Methods Survey methodology A geographically - stratified survey frame was devised for a face - to - face survey across four provinces – Baluchistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Punjab and Sindh – and Islamabad Capital Territory , where within - province recruitment was stratified across urban and rural areas based on rela - tive population sizes across these areas within provinces . Data were collected between 31 May and 29 June 2021 by research assistants of IPSOS Mori , a market research consultancy . A target sample size of 3 , 600 was devised based on the smallest within - province urban / rural area needed to detect a mean difference of 5 contacts between urban and rural areas at a confidence level of 95 % , assuming 80 % power based on the population variance of contacts across a recent LMIC social contact dataset . Primary sampling units were randomly selected proportionate to size , for example , cities in urban areas and villages in rural areas . In rural areas , secondary sampling units were randomly chosen at the village level and a well - known central landmark ( e . g . , mosque , shop , electricity transformer ) was chosen in each , and four equally - sized quadrants were drawn in the area around this . Inter - viewers conducted five interviews in two alternate quad - rants ( e . g . , 1 and 3 ) . In urban areas , a similar important landmark was chosen in areas divided based on cen - sus data of around 250 – 270 households , and interviews recruited households using a random ballot of five house - holds nearby and a three - household skip interval . One respondent was recruited per sampled household ran - domly chosen using a KISH grid , with interviews calling back up to three times if respondents were unavailable . All face - to - face interviews were conducted in strict compliance with Pakistan government COVID - 19 reg - ulations . Participants were asked to choose a quiet , well - ventilated area for the interview to take place , and fieldworkers sanitised hands regularly , always maintained physical distance from participants , and did not shake hands . Respondents were asked a range of questions on COVID - 19 including knowledge and experience of test - ing , isolation requirements and symptoms , alongside impacts on the household such as income or expenditure changes . Then , a short , validated vaccine hesitancy tool was shown to participants [ 15 , 16 ] , assessing respondent intentions to obtain a vaccine if one was offered alongside reasons for potential hesitancy , and a range of attitudinal Fig . 1 Stringency of COVID‑19 control measures in Pakistan during COVID‑19 pandemic .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 321 questions asking respondents to designate their agree - ment with statements around safety , efficacy and impor - tance of vaccination , for example , " vaccines are effective " . Respondents were then asked to report all direct physical and non - physical contacts made between 5am the day before and 5am the day of the survey ( i . e . , one 24 h period ) . A direct contact was defined as someone respondents met in person and with whom they had either i ) " Physical contact ( any sort of skin - to - skin contact e . g . a handshake , embracing , kissing , sleeping on the same bed / mat / blanket , sharing a meal together out of the same bowl , playing football or other contact sports , sitting next to someone while touching shoulder to shoulder , etc . ) " , or ii ) " Non - physical contact ( you did not touch the person , but exchanged at least a few words , face - to - face within 2 m – for example , someone you bought something from in the market , or rode with on a public / private trans - portation vehicle , or worked with in the same area ) " . All respondents were over the age of 18 so no contact data were collected from children , however respondents were able to list contacts under the age of 18 . We made pragmatic adaptations to existing con - tact measurement tools to allow them to be conducted quickly face - to - face , to reduce respondent burden , and to ensure that aggregate contact data were not biased downwards by respondent fatigue . Respondents were first asked about contacts with members of their house - hold the previous day , recording the contact age , gender , and whether contacts were physical or non - physical . Then respondents were asked how many non - household contacts they had had in the same timeframe . Those who reported nine or fewer outside household contacts were asked to describe each contact’s age , gender , whether the contact was physical or non - physical , the duration of the contact , and whether a mask was worn by the respond - ent or contact . Those who reported ten or more out - side - household contacts were asked how many of these contacts were physical / non - physical , whether they took place in school / work or elsewhere , and whether con - tacts were in the age ranges under 18 , 18 – 59 , or over 60 . The complete survey tool , including these social contact questions , is shown in Additional file 1 . Statistical analysis R version 4 . 0 . 0 and Stata 15 were used for analyses ; the code and data are publicly available . We use tables and descriptive plots to summarise participant character - istics , factors relating to the impact of COVID - 19 and control measures on the household , and vaccine attitudes and hesitancy . We present exploratory disaggregations of these variables to consider variation by geographi - cal and individual variables . We determine if there are important differences in mean contacts between groups by comparing mean contacts and use t - tests to determine the strength of differences . For the social contacts analysis , we calculated the average number of social contacts per person per day , stratified by respondent age , sex , household size , socio - economic status , province , and education level . We then calculated social contact matrices for the age - specific fre - quency of daily contacts , adjusting for contact reciproc - ity and the age distribution using national data [ 17 ] . We compared contact data with those of Pakistan in the syn - thetic matrices of Prem et al . [ 12 ] . As respondents under the age of 18 were not included as survey respondents , we imputed the average number of contacts of children with adults using the estimated total number of contacts of adults with children , adjusting for the national popu - lation demographics and assuming reciprocity on the total number of contacts . Contacts made between chil - dren were imputed using methods developed by Klepac et al . [ 18 ] , and implemented in UK [ 19 ] and Kenyan studies [ 20 ] . This involved taking the ratio of the domi - nant eigenvalues between our matrices and comparable setting - adjusted matrices to scale the missing matrix ele - ments for respondents under the age of 18 . Ethics Participation in the study was voluntary and analyses were conducted on anonymised data . The study was approved by the Observational / Interventions Research Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( Reference : 25 , 453 ) . Results Respondent characteristics In total , 3 , 658 people completed the survey with the intended 50 / 50 sample - level stratification across urban and rural areas and male and female respondents . In total , 8 , 211 interviews were attempted , 2 , 192 ( 27 % ) had no answer or no response , and there were 1 , 360 refusals to participate ( 17 % ) . 56 interviews were interrupted ( 1 % ) , 917 ( 12 % ) of respondents were not eligible for interview as stratification targets had already been met in that area , and 27 ( 0 . 3 % ) interviews removed due to quality control issues . Table 1 shows that the age , gender and geographi - cal distributions of respondents broadly reflect those of Pakistan , though the proportion of respondents aged over 55 years and 18 – 35 years were under - represented in our sample . Implications of COVID‑19 and control measures Just 62 ( 1 . 6 % ) of participants reported ever obtaining a positive COVID - 19 test . One - in - ten ( 365 ) reported perceiving a high risk of COVID - 19 infection , while Page 5 of 11 Quaife et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 321 45 % perceived no or low risk that they would experi - ence COVID - 19 . As in Fig . 2A , just 12 % of respond - ents thought that COVID - 19 posed a very high threat to them personally and 11 % to their family ; however , 30 % thought COVID - 19 posed a very high threat to the country and 38 % to the world . Slightly more than half ( 51 % ) of respondents did not know where to obtain a COVID - 19 test , with some variation by region and indi - vidual characteristics ( Fig . 2B ) , and ( 308 ) 8 % of respond - ents had ever taken a COVID - 19 test . There was a clear gap between self - isolation knowledge and behaviours ( Fig . 2C ) – although 72 % of respondents thought that after self - isolation was needed for longer than one week after coronavirus infection ; 66 % of the 62 respondents who had ever tested positive for COVID - 19 reported self - isolating for four days or fewer . Finally , 17 % reported household hunger in the previ - ous four weeks ( Fig . 2D ) , with 60 % of those experiencing hunger reported the primary reason was either house - hold COVID - 19 infection , COVID - 19 control measures , or both . A substantial proportion of respondents were impacted in various ways : 25 % of households experienced job losses , 30 % of individuals spent working time home schooling or caring for other ( Additional file 3 , fig . 1A ) . Nearly one in five ( 19 % ) of respondents were able to work or study from home . Respondents reported substantial economic insecurity due to COVID - 19 and control measures . 77 % reported a decrease in their income as a direct result of COVID - 19 or control measures , of those 19 % reported a decrease in income of more than half . Nearly all ( 94 % ) reported noticing an increase in prices in the past month , and 97 % in the past year . To cope with income losses or increases in costs , 25 % of respondents reported taking loans , 15 % drawing from savings , 4 % receiving gifts from family or friends , and 3 % selling assets ( Additional file 3 , fig . 1B ) . On balance , the level of household spending across dif - ferent items did not change substantially compared to before COVID - 19 ( Additional file 3 , fig . 1C ) . Vaccine attitudes and hesitancy Nearly half ( 48 % ) of participants agreed that they would get a vaccine if it were offered . Vaccine hesitancy was substantial and highest in Sindh and Baluchistan prov - inces where just 14 % and 7 % of respondents strongly agreed that they would get a vaccine if available ( Addi - tional file 3 , fig . 2A ) . There was very strong evidence that hesitancy varied by socioeconomic status ( Additional file 3 , fig . 2B ) , for both strongly agreeing ( non - parametric test for trend p < 0 . 001 ) and strongly disagreeing that they would get a vaccine ( trend p < 0 . 001 ) . There was weaker evidence of a trend by age groups ( Additional file 3 , fig . 2C ) in strongly agreeing ( trend p = 0 . 05 ) and strongly disagreeing that they would get a vaccine ( trend p = 0 . 19 ) , with older respondents substantially more likely to be willing to receive a vaccine . There were no substantial dif - ferences between genders . Although 51 % of all respondents thought vaccines were safe , 46 % thought they were effective , and 47 % thought they were important . These perceptions were much lower in Sindh and Baluchistan , the two provinces with lowest willingness to get a vaccine if available ( Additional file 3 , fig . 3 ) . Among those reporting hesitancy in seek - ing vaccination , the primary reason was worry about side effects for 37 % of respondents , whilst 16 % thought vac - cines were not effective , 15 % thought that they were not at risk from COVID - 19 , and 13 % were against vaccines in general . A further 10 % cited time or cost , 4 % lack of endorsement by religious leaders , and 3 % fear of causing infertility . Contact patterns In total , 56 , 455 contacts were reported , 14 , 786 ( 26 % ) of which were household contacts . One - in - three par - ticipants ( 29 % ) reported nine or fewer contacts , so we have full information on 16 , 357 contacts , 77 % of which were household contacts .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 321 reported was 15 ( median 5 , IQR 3 – 9 ) . Participants reported a mean of 4 household contacts ( median 3 , IQR 2 – 5 ) and 11 non - household contacts ( median 2 , IQR 0 – 4 ) . As shown in Fig . 3 , there was no substantial vari - ation in the number of contacts by socioeconomic sta - tus , gender , participant age , education level , province , or whether the respondent lived in an urban or rural area . As expected , the number of contacts reported increased with household size as 35 % ( 14 , 786 / 41 , 669 ) of contacts were reported within the household . Figure 4 summarises the characteristics of the 16 , 357 ( 28 % ) contacts for which we have detailed information as respondents reported fewer than ten contacts in each set - ting , comprising 12 , 540 ( 85 % ) of household contacts and 3 , 817 ( 9 % ) of non - household contacts . Within the house - hold , roughly half of contacts were physical and equally split between genders . Outside of the household , 70 % of all contactees were men . There was substantial assorta - tivity by gender as men represented 97 % of the outside household contacts of male respondents , compared to 29 % of outside household contacts of female respond - ents . Assortativity by gender was lower for household contacts , where just 46 % of male respondents’ contacts were male and 59 % of female respondents’ contacts female ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Nearly half ( 49 % ) of male respond - ent’s contacts were physical , compared to 44 % of those of female respondents ( p < 0 . 001 ) ; 92 % of outside household contacts took place without masks being worn , and 43 % took place in a residential property . Among those report - ing detailed contacts , most ( 33 % ) contacts were between 5 and 14 min in length , with a further 27 % between 15 – 59 min in length . We explore how mean reported contacts vary across respondents reporting different extents of vaccine hesi - tancy in Fig . 5 . First , we find that those strongly agree - ing that they would get a vaccine report a greater number of contacts ( 16 . 7 compared to 9 . 9 , t - test p - value < 0 . 01 ) which is beneficial to reducing cases through vaccina - tion since reduction in disease risk from vaccination will counteract their having greater numbers of contacts . However , we find that people who strongly agree that vaccines have positive traits have significantly fewer con - tacts , specifically that vaccines are important ( 14 . 4 com - pared to 19 . 6 , p = 0 . 01 ) , effective ( 14 . 6 compared to 18 . 5 , Fig . 2 Description of ( A ) perceived threat from COVID‑19 to respondents and groups to which they belong , B the proportion of respondents from different groups who reported not knowing where to obtain a COVID‑19 test , C percentage of respondents reporting knowledge and self‑reported adherence to self‑isolation with COVID‑19 symptoms , and ( D ) self‑reported household hunger Page 7 of 11 Quaife et al .

These sources of hesitancy may be important since lower vaccination uptake among those with more contacts will mean existing models will over - estimate the impact of vaccination . Figure 6 shows age - specific contact matrices , where panel A shows an asymmetric matrix directly esti - mated from all contacts in this study without adjusting for demography . Unadjusted location - specific contact matrices for all contacts and detailed contacts are shown in Additional file 3 , figs . 4 and s5 respectively . Figure 5B uses pre - COVID - 19 synthetic contact matrices for Paki - stan to impute contacts between children , and panel C adjusts this imputed matrix for age distribution and sym - metry . Compared to the synthetic matrices of Prem et al . [ 12 ] , we estimate a 9 % reduction in contacts in this study . Among contacts for which we have detailed data , we observe some evidence of age - assortativity ( Additional Fig . 4 Characteristics of ( A ) household and ( B ) non‑household contacts for which full information was gathered Fig . 5 Mean number of contacts by those responding that they strongly agree with vaccine hesitancy questions .

Discussion In a nationally representative survey stratified by age , gender , and urban / rural areas within provinces , we pre - sent evidence of the impact of COVID - 19 on households and report considerable vaccine hesitancy in some prov - inces . Respondents perceived COVID - 19 as a threat , but not to themselves – 45 % of respondents perceived that they were at no or low risk from COVID - 19 . Further - more , although 72 % of respondents knew that self - isola - tion was required for longer than one week , 66 % of those receiving positive COVID - 19 tests self - isolated for four days or fewer . Just over half ( 51 % ) of respondents did not know where to obtain a COVID - 19 test . The economic impact of COVID - 19 and control measures appears to have been reasonably severe . Finally , we show that social contacts are highly assortative by gender and are estimate to have reduced in number since before the COVID - 19 pandemic by 9 % . Although around half of respondents indicated that they would obtain a vaccine if available we saw consid - erable vaccine hesitancy , particularly in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces . Previous vaccine hesitancy surveys in Pakistan found that confidence in the importance , safety , and effectiveness of vaccines fell between 2015 and 2019 [ 15 ] , with controversy around polio vaccination postu - lated as a potential reason [ 22 ] . This study’s findings align with other vaccine hesitancy studies in Pakistan , though we find a slightly lower acceptability of vaccination compared to surveys of the general population [ 23 ] and health workers [ 14 ] . Compared to 2020 estimates using the same survey questions [ 15 ] , we find respondents were much less likely to strongly agree that vaccines are effec - tive , safe , and important – reductions of 73 % , 54 % and 70 % respectively . We find strong evidence that contacts are highly gen - der assortative , and 97 % of male outside household con - tacts were with other men . We also see some evidence of age assortiveness outside household contacts , though we were only able to explore this in respondents who report fewer than ten outside household contacts . Like many other countries , Pakistan implemented a range of non - pharmaceutical interventions in 2020 and 2021 in response to increases in COVID - 19 cases . When this survey was conducted in June 2021 , many of these had been relaxed , however the average COVID - 19 restric - tion stringency index in the survey period was 61 out of 100 . We do not observe a reduction in contacts as seen in other settings – systematic review evidence indicates that contacts reduced by 62 – 83 % under COVID - 19 restric - tions on average , though we note many of these were conducted earlier in the pandemic and under more inten - sive non - pharmaceutical interventions [ 8 ] . Without pre - COVID - 19 empirical contact data from Pakistan , we had to compare our estimates to synthetic ( modelled ) contact estimates , which may be biased . Social contact studies such as this are critical to understand the sensitivity of contacts and behaviour to interventions as they continue to be implemented and relaxed in different ways . It may also be the case that COVID - 19 restrictions may be less Fig . 6 Age‑stratified mean number of reported contacts from survey respondents , where ( A ) is the unadjusted contact matrix , B the mixing matrix produced when estimates from Prem et al . are used to impute contacts between children , and reported adult – child contacts are used to impute child – adult contacts , and ( C ) the mixing matrix produced when matrix ( B ) is adjusted for reciprocity using the age structure of Pakistan in 2020 Page 10 of 11 Quaife et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 321 effective in the long term in reducing social contacts than elsewhere , perhaps due to the substantial economic and personal impact of restrictions found here . Our findings that the mean number of contacts dif - fer significantly by willingness to accept vaccination and perceptions of vaccines are important , as they indicate that existing COVID - 19 impact models may be incorrect in assuming homogeneity in both vaccine uptake and contact patterns . Although such models continue to be a powerful tool in motivating for resources to vaccinate populations worldwide [ 6 , 7 ] , adapting such models to incorporate correlation between disease risk , as defined by number of contacts , and vaccination attitudes could show the importance of targeting high - contact vaccine hesitant groups , for example . Considerable food and economic vulnerability was reported due to COVID - 19 or control measures . Over 77 % of respondents reported a partial or complete loss of income , with one in five of those reporting income reductions of more than half . Almost all ( 94 % ) respond - ents perceived price increases in the previous month . In order to cope with these pressures , 25 % of respondents reported taking loans and 15 % drew on savings . Although the prevalence of COVID - 19 was low , and these factors can largely be attributed to control measures rather than illness from COVID - 19 itself , it is important to recognise the counterfactual of no control measures is an unmiti - gated epidemic , and not an absence of these harms . Strin - gent control measures which cause economic and food insecurity are not likely to be sustainable in the long term if not accompanied by social protection mechanisms . These data were collected during a period of decline of COVID - 19 cases in Pakistan , on the first day of the sur - vey the seven day average number of cases was 2 , 425 , which reduced to 935 on the last day of the survey – this was one of the lowest case rates between the country’s third and fourth waves of infection . Collecting contact data in a period of decline in case rates may have affected results , for example capturing increased contact rates as people perceive lower disease risk from daily activities . Conversely , case rates may have decreased due to more stringent control measures which acted by reducing con - tact opportunities and rates . This study has a number of limitations . To make the contact survey feasible for data collection as part of a wider survey on COVID - 19 impacts and vaccination perceptions , we simplified the contact tool for respond - ents who reported ten or more outside household con - tacts . We therefore have very limited information outside of the age and location category of these contacts , and contacts reported in this way were a substantial propor - tion ( 71 % ) of the total sample . We note that in a previ - ous study using this method of collecting aggregate contact data in Kenya [ 20 ] , 70 % of contacts were reported through aggregate questions . The main risk of bias from this may stem from respondents rounding up or down to anchor numbers ( e . g . units of five ) , though although a few respondents cluster around 25 contacts , we don’t see much evidence of this in Fig . 1H . Overall , the loss of granularity was beneficial to reducing respondent bur - den , but reduced comparability to other studies . The standard contact measurement approach – where data collections guide respondents through their day and ask for all contacts , remains the gold - standard measurement tool , and this method also allows more granular con - tactee age data , which is important to inform models . In addition , in a culture where even slight physical con - tact such as a handshake can be taboo between men and women , we may be at risk of contact under - reporting to an unknown extent without conducting further valida - tion work . Although the vaccine hesitancy tool we use has been widely implemented in almost all countries worldwide , we cannot be sure how much an intention - behaviour gap exists with respect to accepting a vaccine if offered , nor the correlation between responses to different hesi - tancy questions and real - world uptake . Finally , evidence is now clear that SARS - COV - 2 transmission is predomi - nantly airborne [ 24 ] , meaning that the number of con - tacts is likely less important to understanding COVID - 19 dynamics than the location , ventilation , proximity and length of contacts . Conclusion Like other settings , Pakistan continues to implement and relax control measures in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . In this representative national survey we find evidence of substantial vaccine hesitancy , along - side high knowledge but poor adherence to self - iso - lation after COVID - 19 infection . We find that social contacts reduced by 9 % compared to estimates from before COVID - 19 , that contacts are highly assortative by gender and , to a lesser extent , age , and that vaccination attitudes are associated with disease risk through differ - ent contact patterns . This is the first study to measure social contact patterns after COVID - 19 control measures have been implemented in South Asia . Large negative impacts of COVID - 19 and control measures on eco - nomic and food security suggest increased social protec - tion may be needed .
