Brucellosis , a zoonotic disease , was made statutorily notifi - able in China in 1955 . We analyzed the incidence and spa - tial – temporal distribution of human brucellosis during 1955 – 2014 in China using notifiable surveillance data : aggregated data for 1955 – 2003 and individual case data for 2004 – 2014 . A total of 513 , 034 brucellosis cases were recorded , of which 99 . 3 % were reported in northern China during 1955 – 2014 , and 69 . 1 % ( 258 , 462 / 374 , 141 ) occurred during Febru - ary – July in 1990 – 2014 . Incidence remained high during 1955 – 1978 ( interquartile range 0 . 42 – 1 . 0 cases / 100 , 000 residents ) , then decreased dramatically in 1979 – 1994 . However , brucellosis has reemerged since 1995 ( interquar - tile range 0 . 11 – 0 . 23 in 1995 – 2003 and 1 . 48 – 2 . 89 in 2004 – 2014 ) ; the historical high occurred in 2014 , and the affected area expanded from northern pastureland provinces to the adjacent grassland and agricultural areas , then to southern coastal and southwestern areas . Control strategies in China should be adjusted to account for these changes by adopt - ing a One Health approach . B rucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Brucella spp . , which can be transmitted from animal reservoirs , such as cattle , sheep , goats , and pigs , to humans through direct contact with infected animals or ingestion of unpas - teurized animal products ( 1 – 3 ) . The global epidemiology of brucellosis has drastically changed over the past decades , particularly in industrialized countries where the disease was previously endemic but is now mainly associated with returning travelers . However , brucellosis remains a serious concern in low - and middle - income countries , which have most new human cases globally ( estimated ≈ 500 , 000 cases annually ) and major economic losses in animal production resulting from the adverse effects of infection on livestock reproduction ( 2 , 4 , 5 ) . Additionally , human brucellosis is of particular concern because of high initial treatment failure , substantial residual disability of infected patients , and re - lapse rates ( 1 , 6 ) . Moreover , Brucella spp . are highly infec - tious through the aerosol route , making them a potential agent of biological weapons and bioterrorism ( 7 ) . In China , brucellosis was first recorded as Malta fever for 2 foreigners in Shanghai in 1905 , but several patients in China who had similar clinical symptoms had been ob - served in the 10 years before this report ( 8 ) . After this re - port , 3 cases were reported from Chongqing in 1906 ( 9 ) . The first person with a definite diagnosis of Brucella infec - tion by serologic tests was reported from Fujian in 1916 ( 10 ) . Subsequently , Brucella sp . was isolated from a for - eigner and his goats who traveled from Punjab , India , to Henan Province , China , in 1925 ( 11 ) , and human infection in a laboratory setting was reported in Beijing in 1936 ( 12 ) . Thus , human brucellosis was seen in China before 1950 , especially in the northern provinces ( 13 ) . Since 1950 , activities for prevention and control of brucellosis have been gradually introduced in mainland China ( 14 , 15 ) . During 1950 – 1963 , the reporting for human brucellosis was established nationwide , and some surveys were conducted . Vaccination for animals and humans was implemented as the main control measure during 1964 – 1976 in regions with severe epidemics , such as Inner Mon - golia , Xinjiang , Qinghai , Ningxia , and Henan Provinces ( 14 ) . During 1977 – 1988 , a national program for brucellosis control was conducted with the introduction of diagnostic criteria , treatment protocols , and control measures , and Changing Epidemiology of Human Brucellosis , China , 1955 – 2014 Shengjie Lai , 1 Hang Zhou , 1 Weiyi Xiong , 1 Marius Gilbert , Zhuojie Huang , Jianxing Yu , Wenwu Yin , Liping Wang , Qiulan Chen , Yu Li , Di Mu , Lingjia Zeng , Xiang Ren , Mengjie Geng , Zike Zhang , Buyun Cui , Tiefeng Li , Dali Wang , Zhongjie Li , Nicola A .

Human Brucellosis , China vaccination of domestic animals was used as the main con - trol measure . National sentinel surveillance was established in 1990 to monitor the seroprevalence of brucellosis in hu - mans and animals ( 16 ) . During the past decade , outbreaks of human brucel - losis have been reported in increasing numbers and with an apparent geographic expansion from the historically affect - ed north of China ( 17 , 18 ) to southern provinces where non - occupational exposure might be more common because of the increasing movement of humans , animals , and animal food products from brucellosis - endemic regions ( 19 – 21 ) . The epidemiology of human brucellosis clearly presented major challenges in China during the past 60 years , but studies reporting the spatial – temporal patterns of human brucellosis with high - quality , nationwide incidence data are lacking ( 2 , 4 , 14 , 22 , 23 ) . We describe the magnitude and distribution of human brucellosis in mainland China using the notifiable reporting data for 1955 – 2014 and emphasize its recent reemergence . Improving our understanding of the changing epidemiology of brucellosis and identifying high - risk areas can help in formulating plans for national strate - gies to prevent and control brucellosis . Methods Data Source and Ethical Considerations On July 5 , 1955 , human brucellosis was made statutorily notifiable in China : all probable or laboratory - confirmed new brucellosis cases were required to be reported ( on - line Technical Appendix Table 1 , https : / / wwwnc . cdc . gov / EID / article / 23 / 3 / 16 - 1710 - Techapp1 . pdf ) . In this study , we used 2 datasets because the requirements for report - ing changed during the study period ( 24 ) . One comprises the number of brucellosis cases aggregated by case - pa - tient sex , age group , and occupation ; incidence rate ; death rate ; and case - fatality ratio ( online Technical Appendix Table 2 ) , reported monthly through paper - based post or electronic files during 1955 – 2003 . The other consists of individual brucellosis cases reported by doctors within 24 hours after diagnosis to the online National Notifi - able Infectious Disease Reporting Information System at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention during 2004 – 2014 . ( Variables in individual datasets are available in online Technical Appendix Table 3 . ) All data used in this study were anonymized so that individual pa - tients could not be identified . The National Health and Family Planning Commis - sion of China determined that the collection of data from human cases of brucellosis was part of continuing public health surveillance of a notifiable infectious disease and was exempt from institutional review board assessment . All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous for - mat , without access to personal identifying information . Case Definition Brucellosis cases have been classified as probable ( clini - cally diagnosed ) or confirmed ( laboratory confirmed ) in accordance with the guidelines for human brucellosis di - agnosis issued by the Chinese national health authorities in 1977 , 1988 , 1996 , and 2007 , which were successively used during 1977 – 2014 ( online Technical Appendix Table 4 ) . Probable cases are diagnosed by local experienced physi - cians according to patient anamnesis , epidemiologic expo - sure , clinical manifestations , and / or positive results of pre - sumptive laboratory tests , including the plate agglutination test and the intradermal allergic reaction test . Confirmed cases are probable cases with 1 positive result of the fol - lowing tests : standard tube agglutination test , complement fixation test , Coombs test , cysteine test for serologic diag - nosis , or positive Brucella spp . isolation ( 1 ) . Data Analysis Our analysis comprised all probable and confirmed cases in persons with illness onset from January 1 , 1955 , through December 31 , 2014 . According to the National Mid - term and Long - term Animal Disease Control Plan of China ( 25 ) , all the provinces in northern China were identified as the key regions for brucellosis control . Therefore , we aggre - gated the surveillance data of each province to northern and southern China ( online Technical Appendix Table 5 ) , as previously reported ( 26 ) , to examine spatial – temporal patterns by region . To eliminate the potential effect of the introduction of Internet - based reporting on the increasing number of cases since 2004 , we made a time - series predic - tion of the number of cases in 2004 on the basis of data for 1993 – 2003 , using the Holt exponential smoothing method with a 95 % CI ( 27 ) . Then we compared the upper value of the 95 % CI with the actual number of cases in 2004 to calculate the excess proportion of cases that might have contributed to improved data reporting . Adjusted incidence rates for 2004 – 2014 were estimated by using this excess proportion and plotted as an epidemic curve . We also pre - dicted the monthly numbers of cases during the next 5 years ( 2015 – 2019 ) by Holt - Winters exponential smoothing on the basis of data reported during 2004 – 2014 to explore the trend of incidence with seasonality ( 27 ) . We created a heat map of the yearly incidence rate to visualize the long - term change over the 60 - year period by province . We also created a heat map of the monthly number of cases reported during 2005 – 2014 by province , standardized by the yearly number in each province , and plotted a heat map of average weekly proportions of case numbers by province to explore the seasonal pattern during 2005 – 2014 . To test the differences between northern and southern China , we used Mann - Whitney U tests with a sig - nificance level of α = 0 . 05 to test for differences in the time from illness onset to diagnosis and χ 2 with a significance Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 23 , No . 2 , February 2017 185 SYNOPSIS level of α = 0 . 05 to test the differences in the proportion of imported cases . The R statistical software ( version 3 . 1 . 2 , R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) with the package forecast ( version 6 . 1 ) , was used to pro - duce the graphs and heat maps and to perform statistical analyses and prediction , and ArcGIS 10 . 2 . 2 ( ESRI , Red - lands , CA , USA ) was used to plot the geographic patterns . Results Demographic Features During 1955 – 2014 , a total of 513 , 034 human brucello - sis cases ( median 3 , 504 / year [ interquartile range ( IQR ) 1 , 145 – 7 , 886 ] ) , including 170 deaths , were reported to the national human brucellosis surveillance system in main - land China ( Figure 1 , panel A ) . Among them , 346 , 682 ( 67 . 6 % ) cases were reported in the individual database during 2004 – 2014 ; the proportion of laboratory - confirmed cases ranged from 76 . 9 % in 2004 to 93 . 2 % in 2014 ( Table ; Figure 2 ) . Most cases during 2004 – 2014 occurred in males ; the male : female ratio was 2 . 9 : 1 for both northern ( 2 . 9 : 1 ) and southern ( 2 . 6 : 1 ) China ( Table ; online Technical Ap - pendix Table 6 ) . Median age of case - patients was 44 years ( IQR 34 – 54 years ) , and case distribution was similar by sex and type of diagnosis and between northern and southern China ( Figure 2 ) . Most ( 88 . 8 % ) case - patients were farmers or veterinarians or worked in livestock husbandry , trans - portation , and trade or food production during 2004 – 2014 . Overall Incidence and Seasonality The annual incidence rate fluctuated during the 60 years studied ( Figure 1 , panel A ) . Before 1979 , human brucel - losis incidence was relatively steady ( IQR 0 . 4 – 1 . 0 cas - es / 100 , 000 residents ) and peaked during 1957 – 1963 ( range 0 . 9 – 1 . 8 / 100 , 000 ) and again during 1969 – 1971 ( range 1 . 0 – 1 . 2 / 100 , 000 ) . Incidence decreased dramatically be - ginning in 1979 and remained low until 1994 ( IQR 0 . 05 – 0 . 10 / 100 , 000 ) . However , the incidence increased from 1995 through 2014 ( median 0 . 2 / 100 , 000 [ IQR 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 ] during 1995 – 2003 and 2 . 5 / 100 , 000 [ IQR 1 . 5 – 2 . 9 ] during 2004 – 2014 ) ; incidence was highest ( 4 . 2 cases / 100 , 000 residents ) in 2014 . After removal of the excess proportion 186 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 23 , No . 2 , February 2017 Figure 1 . Reported human brucellosis cases ( N = 513 , 034 ) , mainland China , 1955 – 2014 . A ) Aggregated number of cases ( blue bars ) and annual incidence rate ( orange line ) per 100 , 000 residents reported by year . The adjusted incidence rate ( green dashed line ) was estimated by an excess proportion ( 22 . 06 % ) that might be attributed to the effect of Internet - based reporting since 2004 ( see Methods ) . B ) Forecast of the monthly number of cases ( blue line ) during 2015 – 2019 by Holt - Winters exponential smoothing with 80 % CIs ( light gray ) and 95 % CIs ( dark gray ) based on monthly numbers for 2004 – 2014 . Human Brucellosis , China ( 22 . 1 % ; online Technical Appendix Figure 1 ) to account for the potential effect of improvements in data reporting since 2004 , the adjusted incidence rate still indicated an average annual growth rate of 20 . 8 % during 2003 – 2014 , and it appears that brucellosis incidence will continue to rise during the next 5 years ( Figure 1 , panel B ) . Addition - ally , 69 . 1 % ( 258 , 462 / 374 , 141 ) of the cases were reported in February – July during 1990 – 2014 , with an obvious sea - sonality in northern China in 2005 – 2014 ( Figure 3 ) . Geographic Distribution Most ( 99 . 3 % ) cases were reported in northern China dur - ing 1955 – 2014 , and most provinces in northern China experienced a serious epidemic during the 1950s through the 1970s . Incidence subsequently decreased from the late 1970s through the early 1990s and the disease reemerged in the mid - 1990s with cases reported almost every year ( Fig - ure 3 ; online Technical Appendix Figure 2 ) . The 5 prov - inces with the highest median incidence rates during 1955 – 1994 were Tibet ( 14 . 07 cases / 100 , 000 residents ) , Qinghai ( 4 . 43 ) , Shanxi ( 0 . 87 ) , Xinjiang ( 0 . 35 ) , and Inner Mongolia ( 0 . 35 ) ; during 1995 – 2014 , highest incidences shifted to In - ner Mongolia ( 25 . 80 ) , Shanxi ( 7 . 33 ) , Heilongjiang ( 6 . 07 ) , Jilin ( 1 . 79 ) , and Hebei ( 1 . 40 ) . Similarly , the incidence in southern China has in - creased since 2000 , and human brucellosis has emerged or reemerged in all provinces of southern China . Cases have been reported in almost every province and year since 2010 . This finding contrasts with the distribution of brucellosis before 2000 , when the disease was limited to a few prov - inces in southern China , such as Sichuan , Guangxi , and Guangdong ( Figures 3 , 4 ; online Technical Appendix Fig - ure 2 ) . Additionally , the proportion of imported cases was higher in southern than northern China ( 58 . 5 % vs . 40 . 5 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) , but cases in southern China had a longer lag from illness onset to diagnosis than did those in northern China ( 21 vs . 20 days ; p = 0 . 003 ) ( Table ) . Correspondingly , the number of counties reporting hu - man cases in mainland China increased from 87 in 1993 to 1 , 723 in 2014 ; each year since 2004 , hundreds of coun - ties were newly affected ( Figures 5 , 6 ) . The proportion of counties affected in southern China increased from 1 . 1 % in 2004 to 20 . 5 % in 2014 , highlighting the spatial spread over the past decade . From a land cover perspective , dur - ing 2004 – 2014 , affected areas seem to have expanded from the provinces in northern pastureland areas to the adjacent grassland and agricultural areas that have a high density of sheep and goats , then to coastal areas and southeastern China ( Figure 6 ) . Discussion We used a longitudinal surveillance dataset spanning 60 years in China to investigate changes in the epidemiologic characteristics of human brucellosis , especially during the period of dramatic socioeconomic changes during the past 3 decades , during which the urban population increased from 19 % in 1980 to 54 % in 2014 ( 30 ) .

SYNOPSIS incidence has increased and the disease has expanded geo - graphically from northern to southern China . Our study , with long - term and high - quality incidence data , comple - ments a previously published map of human brucellosis in East Asia ( 2 – 4 ) . The temporal trend in human brucellosis incidence in this study ( i . e . , high incidence during 1955 – 1978 , low in - cidence during 1979 – 1994 , and high ( and increasing ) in - cidence from 1995 onwards ) is consistent with the trend in Brucella spp . seroprevalance from animal and human serosurveys conducted in China during 1950 – 2014 . An overall seroprevalence of 41 . 27 % in cattle , sheep , and pigs in brucellosis - endemic areas and 8 . 43 % in humans was reported for 1952 – 1981 , but seroprevalence was only 0 . 55 % in animals and 0 . 75 % in humans during1982 – 1990 after implementation of a national control program in 1979 ( 14 , 31 ) . During 1990 – 2001 , seroprevalence in humans was 3 . 28 % and has increased steadily since 1995 , despite the 188 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 23 , No . 2 , February 2017 Figure 2 .

F ) Proportion of cases in northern and southern China each year . Human Brucellosis , China lack of obvious change in domestic animals ( 0 . 36 % ) ( 16 ) . In the 21st century , seroprevalence maintained an increas - ing trend in occupationally exposed populations ( 11 . 36 % during 2001 – 2004 , 13 . 31 % during 2005 – 2006 , 21 . 97 % in 2007 , and 22 . 75 % in 2011 ) and livestock ( 0 . 28 % during 2001 – 2004 , 0 . 72 % during 2005 – 2006 , and 1 . 49 % in sheep in 2009 ) ( 32 – 35 ) . Although incidence appeared to increase in every province , Tibet seems to follow an inverse pattern and reported few cases during the past 10 years , but sero - logic surveys indicate that seroprevalence of Brucella in - fection in animals and humans remained high in some areas since 2005 ( 36 ) . Additionally , this study found a low case - fatality rate in passive surveillance , and the poor follow - up for outcomes of human brucellosis with chronic infection and illness might have contributed . After brucellosis reemerged in China , the geographic distribution of affected areas gradually expanded ( 14 ) . The areas of brucellosis endemicity gradually shifted from pas - turing areas ( i . e . , Inner Mongolia , Xinjiang , Tibet , Qing - hai , and Ningxia ) to grassland and agricultural areas ( i . e . , Shanxi , Liaoning , Hebei , Shandong , and Jilin Provinces ) , and the southern provinces became increasingly affected ( Figures 4 , 6 ) ( 14 , 17 ) . This reemergence and the geograph - ic expansion might be attributed to a variety of contribut - ing factors . Because brucellosis is not transmitted among humans , humans can be a sentinel for livestock brucellosis .

Geographic distribution of the annual incidence rate per 100 , 000 residents of human brucellosis by 5 - year periods , mainland China , 1990 – 2014 . Human Brucellosis , China with Brucella spp . provides a source and is likely to be one of the main causes of infection for humans . The number of livestock dramatically increased during the past 3 decades to meet the growing demand for meat in China ( e . g . , the yearly numbers of cattle for meat production increased from 3 . 3 million in 1980 to 46 . 7 million in 2011 , and numbers of sheep and goats increased 6 - fold ) ( 38 ) , which would have resulted in an increase of the total population of infected animals , even with low - level constant seroprevalence in livestock . The spatial distribution of human brucellosis ap - parently overlaps with livestock density , especially high densities of sheep and goats ( Figure 6 ) , and high incidences of human brucellosis tended to occur most commonly in grasslands at moderate elevation , where sheep and goats are the predominant livestock ( 17 , 39 ) . Another possible reason for the reemergence is the lack of vaccination , quarantine , and elimination of infected animals among backyard live - stock . Moreover , the intensive modes of production , which accounted for the rearing of only 42 . 9 % of cattle and 51 . 1 % of sheep and goats in 2011 , along with poor infrastructure and lack of high - standard and standardized protocols for maintaining good hygiene within the production cycle , might also result in increasing infections ( 38 ) . Hence per - sons engaged in livestock husbandry , production , and trade are at high risk for brucellosis infection because of occu - pational exposure . Additionally , animal products supplied from brucellosis - endemic areas that have not undergone quarantine or pasteurization might increase the risk for infection in nonoccupational populations and urban set - tings , taking a longer time from illness to diagnosis for im - ported cases in southern China , which might create extra challenges for disease prevention and case management ( 19 , 20 , 40 ) . Therefore , susceptible livestock animals as the host and infection source for human infections are key to brucellosis prevention and control . Vaccination is an effective method to reduce brucel - losis incidence in livestock and correlates to a decrease in reported human cases , although no vaccines are available for humans ( 37 , 41 ) . Compared with those from other coun - tries , new sequence types of Brucella strains have been found in China , and the predominant biovars and sequence types of Brucella strains has changed during past half cen - tury in some regions ( 42 ) . Thus , new livestock vaccines different from those recommended by the International Of - fice of Epizootics are needed in China . Targets have been set for brucellosis control in animals in 2015 and 2020 to reach the standard of control and de - contamination by province ( online Appendix Table 7 ) ( 25 ) . However , to achieve the targets for brucellosis reduction , improvements are needed in socioeconomic parameters , diagnostic and notification systems in animals and humans , and the high prioritization for eliminating the disease in livestock . The continuing existence of human ( and animal ) brucellosis in China , with potential for further increases in incidence , indicates that the control of brucellosis will not be an easy task without taking a One Health approach , Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 23 , No . 2 , February 2017 191 Figure 5 .

Geographic expansion of human brucellosis across counties and distribution of land covers ( 28 ) and density of sheep and goats ( 29 ) , mainland China , 2004 – 2014 . Human Brucellosis , China integrating health professionals from the human and animal sectors and administrations . This effort extends beyond medical and veterinary duties and encompasses economic and even political factors ( 2 ) . Our study has some limitations . First , the data used were collected from passive public health surveillance that might be influenced by changes in surveillance protocols , such as modifications in case definitions and laboratory tests , reporting methods , and availability of health facilities and laboratory diagnostics over the years ( online Techni - cal Appendix Table 4 ) . Second , individual case data were not reported before 2004 , so demographic characteristics , laboratory confirmation , and case distribution could be an - alyzed only for 2004 – 2014 . Third , data on Brucella strains and biotypes and on the varied clinical presentations , in - cluding asymptomatic brucellosis infections among hu - mans , were unavailable in this study to explore the distri - bution of pathogens and the severity of disease . However , the data we used were the most nationally comprehensive for human brucellosis in China . In view of the reemergence of brucellosis in mainland China and the high incidence , further studies should be conducted to explore the drivers of this situation during the past 2 decades . Livestock – human seroprevalence surveys are needed to understand the correlation between livestock and human brucellosis , to identify the most important ani - mal host species , and to attempt to regress human serop - revalence to livestock prevalence or simply livestock num - bers ( 43 ) . The application of spatial – temporal transmission modeling , linking environmental and socioeconomic vari - ables and density ( e . g . , http : / / www . worldpop . org ) and mo - bility of livestock and humans ( 44 ) with the seroprevalence data , would improve understanding of the factors driving reemergence of brucellosis and enable us to better predict the risk in space and time . This information could further inform on potential causes of reemergence ( 45 , 46 ) and the economics of control in relation to ongoing control activi - ties in China . In summary , on the basis of notifiable surveillance data in mainland China during 1955 – 2014 , we found that human brucellosis has reemerged since the mid - 1990s , and the affected areas have expanded from northern to southern China , especially since 2004 . Control strategies in animals and humans should be adjusted to account for these chang - es by adopting a One Health approach at different levels . Further research is warranted to explore the drivers behind the reemergence .
