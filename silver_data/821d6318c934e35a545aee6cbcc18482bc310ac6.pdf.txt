Here we report early alterations of miRNAs expression following rat sciatic nerve injury using microarray analysis . We harvested dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) tissues and identiﬁed 19 miRNAs that showed signiﬁcant changes at four early time points after sciatic nerve transection . Subsequently , miR - 188 and miR - 500 microarray results were veriﬁed by real - time quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerasechainreaction ( qRT - PCR ) .

Pre - vious studies have demonstrated that severed peripheral nerves are able to re - grow and re - connect to their targets , even if their previous functions were seriously compromised [ 5 ] . The sciatic nerveisacommonlyusedmodelforregenerationstudies , compris - ing a mixed population of motor and sensory axons . As we know , nerve regeneration is a complex biological phenomenon incorpo - rating multiple cells , growth factors and an extracellular matrix [ 6 , 27 , 28 ] . Although sciatic nerve regeneration has been studied for many decades , many studies have attached importance to the roles of Schwann cells or how peripheral nerves repair after crush injuries [ 23 , 33 ] , andmuchlessisunderstoodaboutnerveregenera - tion after complete transection . In particular , the crucial regulators that determine neural survival and trigger axon regeneration dur - ing the early phase of sciatic nerve injury remain largely unclear . Hence , dissecting these events is key not only to the development of therapeutic strategies for the improvement of nerve regenera - tion , butalsototheunderstandingofbasicprinciplesgoverningthe biology of tissue development . MiRNAs are attractive candidates as upstream regulators , because miRNAs can post - transcriptionally regulate the entire set ∗ Corresponding authors .

MiRNAs are endogenous , non - coding 21 - to 23 - nucleotide small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3 (cid:3) untranslated region of target mRNAs , leading to their translational inhibition or degradation [ 11 ] . A number of miR - NAs were found in the mammalian CNS and PNS , such as the brain , spinal cord and DRG , where they play key roles in neuronal devel - opment [ 8 , 10 , 21 ] . Recently , several studies have suggested the possibilityofmiRNAinvolvementinneurologicaldiseases [ 2 , 11 ] . To date , however , no reports are available on early alterations of miR - NAsinDRGaftersciaticnerveinjury . Toobtainnewinsightsintothe effects of miRNAs , this study was designed to investigate whether miRNAs are capable of mobilizing the intrinsic capacity for neurite outgrowthandpromotingaxonregenerationthroughanalyzingthe early changes in miRNA expression in the DRG , following sciatic nerve transection , using microarray and bioinformatics analysis . Thirty - six adult , male Sprague – Dawley ( SD ) rats ( 180 – 220g , suppliedbytheExperimentalAnimalCenterofNantongUniversity ) were randomly divided into six groups of six rats each . Each ani - mal was anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of complex narcotics ( 85mg / kgtrichloroacetaldehydemonohydrate , 42mg / kg magnesium sulfate , 17mg / kg sodium pentobarbital ) , and the sci - atic nerve was exposed and lifted through an incision on the lateral aspectofthemid - thighofthelefthindlimb . A1cmlongsegmentof sciatic nerve was then resected at the site just proximal to the divi - sion of tibial and common peroneal nerves , and the incision sites were then closed . To minimize the discomfort and possible painful mechanical stimulation , the rats were housed in large cages with sawdust bedding after the surgery .

The exper - iment was repeated three times . All the experimental procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care guidelines and approved ethically by the Administra - tion Committee of Experimental Animals , Jiangsu Province , China . For miRNA microarray assay , total RNA was extracted using the mirVana TM miRNA Isolation Kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The labeling and hybridization were performed at the Shanghai Biochip Company , according to the protocols in the Agilent miRNA microarray system . Agilent Scan Control software was used for scanning the microarray slides , and Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9 . 5 . 3 was used for image analysis . Microarray data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX v11 . 0 software ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) . The data were analyzed statistically using the two - sample indepen - dent groups t test , and differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0 . 05 . Real - time qRT - PCR assays were performed using a TaqMan miRNA assay kit ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on RNA from the DRG of rats killed at 0h , 1h , 3h , 6h , 9h and 12h after injury . TaqMan microRNA assays ( Applied Biosystems ) that included spe - ciﬁc RT primers and TaqMan probes were used to quantify the expression of mature miRNAs . Real - time qRT - PCR was performed with the 7300 real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) . The relative expression of each miRNA was calculated using the com - parative 2 − (cid:2) Ct method and was normalized using RNU6B mature miRNA . All data were expressed as means ± S . D . Two types of miRNA target prediction software , Tar - getScan ( http : / / www . targetscan . org ) , and miRanda ( http : / / www . microrna . org / microrna / home . do ) , were used to predict the target genes of two speciﬁcally expressed miRNAs . The intersection of these two datasets was used as the prediction results of the target genes of two miRNAs . Using GO to validate the target prediction is one of the most biologically relevant approaches for indicating the functional coherence of target genes . The GO package in R http : / / www . r - project . org / was used to annotate the functions of the miRNA targets . In detail , two - sided Fisher’s exact test was used to classify the GO category , and the type I error was calculated to correct the P value . We examined the expression of 350 Rattus norvegicus - miRNAs based on Version 10 . 0 of the Sanger miRBase ( Sanger Institute , Cambridge , U . K . ; http : / / microrna . sanger . ac . uk / sequences ) in the DRG after sciatic nerve amputation . Microarray analysis revealed that a total of 19 miRNAs showed signiﬁcant expressional changes between the experimental specimens ( at 1h , 3h , 6h and 9h ) and thecontrolgroup ( at0h ) ( Table1 ) , 6miRNAswereupregulatedand 1 miRNAs was downregulated at 1h ( Table 1A ) , 4 miRNAs upreg - ulated and 2 miRNAs downregulated at 3h ( Table 1B ) , 1 miRNA upregulated and 2 miRNAs downregulated at 6h ( Table 1C ) , 7 miR - NAs upregulated and 5 miRNAs downregulated at 9h ( Table 1D ) . Notably , miR - 188 was signiﬁcantly upregulated at most time points , while , in contrast , miR - 500 was visibly downregulated at most time points . To validate the microarray platform , we assessed the expression of one downregulated ( miR - 500 ) and one upregu - lated ( miR - 188 ) miRNA by real - time qRT - PCR . The results showed the time course of changes in the expression of miR - 188 and miR - 500 ( Fig . 1 ) . MiR - 188 was promptly elevated at 1h after sciatic nerve injury , and then leveled off with signiﬁcantly higher values , compared to that for the control group , throughout a period of 12h . Incontrast , miR - 500declinedat3haftersciaticnerveinjury , show - ing signiﬁcantly lower values than those for control group over a period of 12h . Theses results suggest that the microarray data were reliable to warrant further analysis . Although the change in the expression of miR - 188 was not identiﬁed at 6h , compared to the control group , in microarray analysis , this was likely the result of false - negatives in microarray hybridization in that the result of real - time qRT - PCR clearly indicated the obviously upregulated expression of miR - 188 . To analyze the roles of miR - 188 and miR - 500 following rat sciatic nerve transection , potential downstream targets for them S .

Error bars indicate standard deviation . were predicted by integrating two public databases ( TargetScan and miRanda ) . Subsequently , GO function enrichments were per - formed by importing the predicted 240 and 217 target genes from miR - 500 and miR - 188 , respectively . The top ﬁve important GO functions ( regulation of protein kinase cascade ; positive regulation of cellular process ; intracellular signaling cascade ; positive regu - lation of signal transduction ; positive regulation of transcription from the RNA polymerase II promoter ) were signiﬁcantly enriched by the targets of miR - 188 . The ﬁve most important GO functions ( SMAD protein signal transduction ; intracellular signaling cascade ; 2 - oxoglutarate metabolic process ; positive regulation of biologi - cal process ; response to cAMP ) were signiﬁcantly enriched by the targets of miR - 500 ( Table 2 ) . Recent evidence suggests that the expression of at least 20 – 30 % of human protein - coding genes is modulated by miRNAs . A sin - gle miRNA has the potential to target hundreds of distinct mRNA molecules , and one mRNA molecule can be regulated by multiple miRNAs [ 13 ] . Although many studies have indicated that miRNAs are associated with multiple human cancers and can be used in cancer diagnosis [ 16 ] , the effects of miRNA in non - oncologic dis - eases are not yet understood . The related research has just begun . TwoveryrecentstudieshavedemonstratedthatthemiRNAexpres - sion proﬁle were signiﬁcantly altered in the spinal cord injury ( SCI ) model of adult rats [ 15 , 19 ] . MiR - 124a expression was signiﬁcantly decreased at 1 d after SCI . In contrast , the expression of miR - 223 wassigniﬁcantlyincreasedat6and12hafterSCI . Theexpressionof muscle - speciﬁc miRNAs are signiﬁcantly altered after sciatic nerve denervation and reinnervation , and miR - 206 determines the ﬁber type after peripheral nerve regeneration [ 9 ] . Intriguingly , miR - 206 also delays amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression by sensing motor neuron injury and promoting the compensatory regener - ation of neuromuscular synapses in mice [ 35 ] . It is , therefore , importanttouncoverthealterationinearlyexpressionofalargeset of miRNAs following peripheral nerve injury and elucidate the role of miRNAs in mobilizing intrinsic capacity for neurite outgrowth and promoting the regeneration of peripheral nerves , which has not been reported previously . In this study , high - throughput miRNA microarray technology with 350 miRNAs was used to detect miRNA expression in DRG tissues following sciatic nerve injury . Real - time qRT - PCR analysis veriﬁed the results of the microarray study and showed that the microarray data were consistent and reliable . We demonstrated that 19 miRNAs were signiﬁcantly deregulated after sciatic nerve injury , 12upregulatedand7downregulated ( Table1 ) . Thesealtered miRNAs with a diversity of functions may affect a large number of neuronal genes [ 15 ] . Based on the results of the miRNA microarray and real - time qRT - PCR , we selected the two successively deregulated miRNAs ( miR - 188 and miR - 500 ) for further study . Until now , very little research has been available with regard to these two , small non - coding RNAs . MiR - 188 was ﬁrst characterized in the cardiovascular diseases , where it was documented that miR - 188 was involved in homocysteine - induced cardiac remodeling and downregulated by the homocysteine - induced oxidative stress [ 17 ] . Furthermore , miR - 188 in the smooth muscle cells of the human airway is down - regulated by a proinﬂammatory stimulus and thought to act as a regulator of the inﬂammatory response [ 12 ] . Intriguingly , miR - 188 could affect TNF - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) inducedapoptoticpathwaysthroughblockingcaspase - 3activation [ 4 , 26 ] , and TNF - alpha / TNF - alpha receptor is an important media - tor of apoptosis , which is upregulated in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury [ 25 ] . In our experiment , miR - 188 was signiﬁcantly upregulated at most time points after sciatic nerve injury , which implied that DRG neurons could regulate apoptosis , keep neu - ronal survial , and mobilize growth potential , thus establishing an important prerequisites for regenaration during the early phase of sciaticnerveinjury [ 18 , 20 ] . MiR - 500hasbeenreportedlyexpressed speciﬁcally in the central nervous system and is considered a key player in the development of the left hand side [ 34 ] . In addi - tion , miR - 500 signiﬁcantly downregulates neurokinin - 1 receptors in bladder pain syndrome patients [ 29 ] . Brieﬂy , miR - 188 and miR - 500 may play key roles in nervous system development and the regulation of some cellular process , but its function remains largely unclear .

Zhou et al . / Neuroscience Letters 494 ( 2011 ) 89 – 93 Furthermore , targets of miR - 188 and miR - 500 were mapped to gene function databases . This approach clearly illustrated that speciﬁcallyexpressedmiRNAsandtheirtargetsperformintegrated regulatory functions . The analysis indicated that the potential targets for these miRNAs were mainly involved in the intracel - lular signaling cascade , the regulation of signal transduction , the regulation of cellular process and the response to cAMP . For exam - ple , the “positive regulation of cellular process and intracellular signaling cascade” could be affected by processes that modu - late the extent of oxidative stress and inﬂammatory response . Intriguingly , previous studies have demonstrated that stimulating cAMP signaling increased the intrinsic growth capacity of injured sensory axons [ 22 ] . In addition , Smads have been identiﬁed as mediators of intracellular signal transduction by members of the transforming growth factor - beta superfamily . Following receptor activation , Smads are subsequently translocated into the nucleus , where they are thought to play an important role in gene tran - scription [ 7 ] . Moreover , Smads are upregulated in the DRG and denervatedSchwanncellsaftersciaticnerveinjury [ 3 , 24 , 31 ] . Taken together , these results imply that the deregulation of miR - 188 and miR - 500 may elucidate molecular mechanisms of injured sensory axons mobilizing the intrinsic growth capacity at an early stage after sciatic nerve injury . Further studies are , therefore , neces - sary to test the predicted targets , such as c - jun and calmodulin 1 , that are known to play important roles in mobilizing the inher - ent capacity for neurite outgrowth and promoting regeneration during the early phase of sciatic nerve injury [ 1 , 32 ] , which are respectively within the predicted targets of miR - 188 and miR - 500 . The miRNA - based array screening revealed additional 17 dereg - ulated miRNAs besides miR - 188 and miR - 500 ; however their functions have not been fully elucidated by previous studies . Out of these miRNAs , miR - 145 and miR - 134 were signiﬁcantly upreg - ulated at one and three time points after sciatic nerve injury , respectively . MiR - 145 , as well as miR - 188 , is known to affect TRAIL induced apoptotic pathways through blocking caspase - 3 activa - tion [ 4 , 26 ] . MiR - 134 is distributed in a punctate pattern within dendrites and near synapses . Its overexpression cause signiﬁcant decrease in spine volumes whereas its inhibition result in an opposite effect . Moreover , miR - 134 targets lim - domaincontaining kinase 1 mRNA , a direct regulator of actin ﬁlament dynamics that is important for spine remodeling [ 10 , 30 ] . Perhaps , these altered miRNAs might be responsible for the common morphological and functional changes in neurons after axotomy , such as cell survival andneuriteremodeling , throughdifferenttargetmoleculesanddis - tinct pathways . The underlying mechanism , however , needs to be further explored . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst study of early changes in miRNA expression in DRG after transection of the sciatic nerve ; however , the functions and cell - type distributions of most of the miRNAs were not clear . These will be studied in detail in the future . TheseﬁndingsnonethelesssuggestthatmiRNAsmaycriticallycon - tribute to the triggering of nerve regeneration and may , therefore , be potential targets for therapeutic intervention following sciatic nerve injury . Mechanism studies of miRNAs regulating the intrin - sic capacity for neurite outgrowth may contribute to identifying the triggers of nerve regeneration and elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for nerve regeneration .
