The formins FMNL2 and FMNL3 are Cdc42 effectors targeting to the lamellipodium tip and shown here to nucleate and elongate actin ﬁlaments with complementary activities in vitro . In migrating B16 - F1 melanoma cells , both formins contribute to the velocity of lamellipodium protrusion . Loss of FMNL2 / 3 function in melanoma cells and ﬁbroblasts reduces lamellipodial width , actin ﬁlament density and - bundling , without changing patterns of Arp2 / 3 complex incorporation . Strikingly , in melanoma cells , FMNL2 / 3 gene inactivation almost completely abolishes protrusion forces exerted by lamellipodia and modiﬁes their ultrastructural organization . Consistently , CRISPR / Cas - mediated depletion of FMNL2 / 3 in ﬁbroblasts reduces both migration and capability of cells to move against viscous media . Together , we conclude that force generation in lamellipodia strongly depends on FMNL formin activity , operating in addition to Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent ﬁlament branching .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 D uring migration , cells can form multiple types of protrusions , all of which are employed with high ﬂexibility depending on biochemical and / or mechanical features of their microenvironments 1 , 2 . The best known protrusion types expressed at varying extent in different cell types are sheet - like lamellipodia , ﬁnger - like ﬁlopodia and membrane blebs , the formation of all of which depends on the actin cytoskeleton . Lamellipodia are reasonably well understood , thus constituting an excellent model system to examine the relative , mechanistic functions of distinct actin - binding proteins that cooperate in protrusion . It is commonly agreed that Rac drives the generation of lamellipodial actin ﬁlament networks through Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching at the interface of polymerizing actin ﬁlaments and protruding plasma membrane 3 . Coincident signals including Rac and the phosphoinositide PIP 3 ( phosphatidyl - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ) stimulate activation of the heteropentameric WAVE complex 4 , 5 , which appears essential for Arp2 / 3 complex activation in lamellipodia 6 – 8 . Consistently , functional interference with Arp2 / 3 complex eliminates lamellipodia formation entirely 9 – 11 , but whether or not Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent branching of actin ﬁlaments is sufﬁcient for the generation of lamellipodial actin networks , and how other actin ﬁlament assembly factors contribute to this process in vivo has mostly remained unclear . For instance , aside from Arp2 / 3 complex , lamellipodial actin assembly is thought to be promoted by Ena / VASP family proteins or formins 3 , 12 , but the exact relative contributions of these protein families to protrusion are unknown . Formin family proteins can modulate actin ﬁlament dynamics by various means , including actin ﬁlament bundling or even severing 13 , but the most common activities are nucleation of actin ﬁlaments and their processive elongation in a proﬁlin - dependent fashion 14 , 15 . In many cell types , formins are best known for their potential function in driving the assembly of linear actin ﬁlaments and bundles in ﬁlopodia 16 – 19 , although no particular formin is as yet recognized as essential for the formation of these structures 20 , 21 . However , two formin subfamilies have previously been implicated in contributing to lamellipodium protrusion , the Dia subfamily including mDia1 or mDia2 ( human DRF3 ) and the FMNL subfamily including FMNL2 . Each of these two formin subfamilies comprises three members , with FMNL1 , formerly called FRL1 , being restricted in expression to leukocytes and certain epithelial cell lines ( see ref . 22 and below ) . However , the functions exerted by these formins in lamellipodia are not well understood . mDia1 has recently been suggested to produce mother ﬁlaments for Arp2 / 3 - dependent branching 23 , but the protein accumulates at the rear cortex 24 instead of the lamellipodium tip where branching takes place 25 , and ﬁbroblasts derived from mDia1 knockout cells readily form lamellipodia 26 . Likewise , mDia2 has been implicated as a mother ﬁlament generator in lamellipodia of B16 - F1 melanoma ( B16 ) cells 19 , but its accumulation at lamellipodia tips of these cells appeared as exception rather than rule 16 . As opposed to this , FMNL2 and - 3 , two more ubiquitously expressed members of the FMNL subfamily in mammals 27 , 28 clearly target to lamellipodia , both as expressed , constitutively active versions or as endogenous proteins 27 – 29 . As other Diaphanous - related formins , FMNL2 is regulated by autoinhibition 14 , 30 , which in this case can be relieved by interaction with the small Rho - family GTPase Cdc42 ( ref . 29 ) . Similar observations were recently described for FMNL3 ( ref . 28 ) , suggesting that both formins might contribute to the efﬁciency of protrusion , in particular downstream of Cdc42 signalling . But what are the mechanistic functions of FMNL formins in protrusion ? It is clear that upon activation FMNL2 and FMNL3 employ their proline - rich FH1 - ( formin homology 1 ) domain and actin binding domains such as FH2 ( formin homology 2 ) or FH2 plus WH2 ( WASP homology 2 ) , in case of FMNL3 , for stimulating actin ﬁlament assembly 31 , 32 . Moreover , FMNL2 can enhance processive actin ﬁlament elongation in the presence of proﬁlin in vitro 29 . This notion and the observed reduction of protrusion upon RNAi - mediated FMNL2 knockdown led to a model in which FMNL formins—possibly in analogy to Ena / VASP family actin polymerases 33 , 34 —would promote elongation of lamellipodial actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex 3 , 29 . So following this model , lamellipodial actin assembly would result from the coordinated branching and FMNL formin - dependent elongation of actin ﬁlaments , with slow but persistent protrusion if Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching dominated , and rapid , unstable protrusion if formin - mediated elongation dominated 3 . Here , we explored this hypothesis by combining comparative analyses of the biochemical activities of FMNL2 and FMNL3 with examination of the consequences of FMNL2 / 3 loss of function in migrating melanoma and ﬁbroblast cells . We show that FMNL2 and FMNL3 display moderately divergent activities in actin nucleation and elongation in vitro and partially overlapping functions in lamellipodia protrusion . However , simultaneous functional interference with FMNL2 and - 3 reduces the width of lamellipodia as well as the actin ﬁlament density and frequency of microspike bundle formation within them , with Arp2 / 3 - dependent ﬁlament branching staying unchanged . Nevertheless , this treatment strongly compromises the pushing forces exerted by these structures in B16 cells . Consequently , FMNL2 / 3 removal coincides with compromised migration of both B16 cells and ﬁbroblasts , and reduced capability of the latter to move in high viscosity . We conclude that FMNL formin - generated ﬁlaments in lamellipodia operate in addition to Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent branching to strengthen these structures for promoting effective protrusion and migration . Results FMNL2 and FMNL3 display common and divergent activities . We previously established a physiologically relevant , direct interaction of the N - terminal regulatory half of FMNL2 with Cdc42 ( refs 29 , 35 ) . To test whether Cdc42 can relieve the autoinhibition of FMNL3 in migrating B16 - F1 cells , as previously found for FMNL2 , we expressed EGFP - FMNL3 either alone or in combination with constitutively active Cdc42 or Rac1 ( Fig . 1a ) . In analogy to FMNL2 ( ref . 29 ) , EGFP - FMNL3 is cytosolic , partly because EGFP - tagging at the N - terminus blocks its N - terminal myristoylation and because endogenous Cdc42 is insufﬁcient to fully activate the formin . Co - overexpression of Cdc42 activated EGFP - FMNL3 , allowing targeting to lamellipodia tips , which was not observed for Rac1 that stimulated lamellipodia without EGFP - FMNL3 accumulation . C - terminal tagging of FMNL3 , enabling myristoylation , conﬁrmed the lamellipodium in B16 cells as physiologically relevant site of FMNL3 accumulation ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . We next explored the biochemical activities of FMNL formins and their combined functions in vivo , as their distinguished accumulation at the lamellipodium tip where actin assembly takes place 25 suggests a key role in the formation of these structures . As FMNL1 was completely absent in B16 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , as expected 22 , we focused on FMNL2 and FMNL3 . The C - terminal halves of both formins constituting the business ends concerning actin ﬁlament assembly were compared . As opposed to FMNL3 , the C - terminus of FMNL2 could only be expressed as synthetic versions lacking variable numbers of ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications EGFP - FMNL3 Phase Phase 1 µ M actin 00 : 00 140 18 16 * * * * * * * * * E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s s e c – 1 ) E l onga t i on r a t e ( s ub s s e c – 1 ) 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 * * * * * * * * 120 100 80 N u m be r o f f il a m en t s 60 40 20 0 1 µ M a c t i n 1 µ M a c t i n + 10 n M F M N L2 - 21 P + 10 n M F M N L2 - 21 P + 10 n M F M N L3 + 10 n M F M N L3 + 100 n M F M N L2 - 21 P + 100 n M F M N L3 03 : 00 06 : 00 09 : 00 00 : 00 02 : 00 04 : 00 06 : 00 08 : 00 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1 µ M a c t i n 5 µ M P F N + 1 n M F M N L2 - 8 P + 1 n M F M N L2 - 21 P + 1 n M F M N L3 NS G r een G r een G r een R ed R ed R ed * * * * * * * * * * * * 1 µ M actin + 5 µ M PFN + 1 nM FMNL2 - 8P + 1 nM FMNL2 - 21P + 1 nM FMNL3 + 10 nM FMNL2 - 21P + 10 nM FMNL3 + 100 nM FMNL2 - 21P + 100 nM FMNL3 Phase Phase FMNL3 - EGFP EGFP - FMNL3 + Rac1 - L61 EGFP - FMNL3 + Cdc42 - L61 a b c d e f Figure 1 | FMNL3 is regulated like FMNL2 , but displays diverging actin assembly properties .

Consistent with previous observations 29 and with other formins 36 , the number of proline residues positively correlated with activity ( see below ) . In pyrene assays and in the absence of proﬁlin , FMNL3 accelerated actin assembly in a concentration - dependent manner , as reported previously 32 , but this was much less pronounced in case of FMNL2 - 21P ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . A similar pattern was observed in the presence of proﬁlin ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , although the normalized polymerization slopes peaked at concentrations of about 100 nM in each case ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . However , due to the reduced binding of proﬁlin to pyrene - actin 37 , hindering precise quantiﬁcation of formin - dependent actin assembly in these bulk assays , potential differences in nucleation and / or elongation activities between these formin variants were additionally explored at the single ﬁlament level by TIRF microscopy . Both formins stimulated ﬁlament formation in a concentration - dependent manner , but FMNL3 was signiﬁcantly more potent in the absence of proﬁlin than FMNL2 - 21P ( Fig . 1b , c , Supplementary Movie 2 ) .

Although proﬁlin addition caused reduced average nucleation of actin ﬁlaments by both formins ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) , FMNL3 performed better again in this assay , albeit statistically insigniﬁcant . Together , we conclude that FMNL3 nucleates actin ﬁlaments more potently than FMNL2 . This is also consistent with enhanced induction of ﬁlopodia ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) upon over - expression of active mutants of FMNL3 ( FMNL3 - A275E ) as compared to active FMNL2 ( FMNL2 - A272E ) , both of which were generated in analogy to previously characterized active variants of mDia1 ( A256D ) ( ref . 38 ) or FHOD ( V228E ) ( ref . 39 ) . These results also prompted us to test whether FMNL3 might drive nucleation of lamellipodial ﬁlaments in the absence of the Rac / WAVE / Arp2 / 3 complex pathway , for example , in Rac - deﬁcient cells completely lacking lamellipodia 40 . However , neither active FMNL3 ( D DAD ) nor activation of full length FMNL3 by constitutively active Cdc42 restored lamellipodia formation in Rac - null cells , in spite of prominent targeting of these FMNL3 variants to ﬁlopodia tips or concave cell edges formed in between them ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Proﬁlin - dependent ﬁlament elongation by both formins was compared at two concentrations . At 10 nM , FMNL2 - 21P almost tripled average elongation rates in the presence of proﬁlin whereas FMNL3 was less effective in this assay ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . We also tested formin variants at 1 nM concentration and with differentially tagged actin variants ( see Methods ) , which allowed directly distinguishing spontaneous from formin - mediated actin ﬁlament elongation based on ﬂuorescence colour of incorporated actin ( Fig . 1e , f , Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Here , measured elongation rates observed with FMNL2 - 21P rose up to B 45 subunits per second ( at B 1 m M proﬁlactin ) , whereas rates observed with FMNL3 or the truncated FMNL2 - 8P at identical conditions did not exceed 30 subunits per second ( Fig . 1f ) . Little difference was observed between FMNL2 - 21P and FMNL3 concerning processive elongation , but FMNL2 - 8P was clearly less active in this assay ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) , indicating that the number of proline stretches within FH1 can contribute to the persistence of formin binding at the barbed end . Together , FMNL2 is more effective in elongating actin ﬁlaments than FMNL3 , opposite to what was observed for nucleation . These data suggest that FMNL2 and FMNL3 functions in vivo are not fully overlapping , as exempliﬁed for instance by pronounced induction of ﬁlopodia by FMNL3 as compared to FMNL2 ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . FMNL2 and - 3 variably contribute to lamellipodium protrusion . FMNL2 knockdown reduces lamellipodium protrusion speed in migrating B16 - F1 melanoma cells by 24 % ( ref . 29 ) . To test for the relative relevance of FMNL2 versus FMNL3 in lamellipodia formation , in particular in the context of their divergent biochemical activities described above , we transiently silenced expression of FMNL3 alone ( Fig . 2a – c ) or FMNL2 and FMNL3 by RNA interference ( Fig . 2d – i ) . Double knockdown was achieved by expression of one shRNA mediating knockdown of both proteins ( Fig . 2d – f ) or of combined shRNAs mediating their knockdown individually ( Fig . 2g – i , Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Both approaches caused protrusion rates to be reduced to roughly half of the rates observed in mock RNAi - treated cells , but knockdown of FMNL3 had effects much stronger than previously seen for FMNL2 ( reduced by B 41 % ; Fig . 2a – c ) . This was counterintuitive , at least at ﬁrst glance , as promotion of protrusion was previously proposed to be mediated by actively elongating actin ﬁlaments 3 , 29 , an activity assigned to FMNL2 rather than FMNL3 . Notwithstanding this , our analyses established both FMNL2 and FMNL3 to contribute to protrusion , albeit in a non - or at best partially redundant fashion , consistent with their distinct biochemical activities observed in vitro . Importantly , reduction of lamellipodium protrusion in these cells also affected migration efﬁciencies , again with FMNL3 contributing more substantially to the process ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) than FMNL2 ( ref . 29 ) . In contrast , the persistence of lamellipodium protrusion , assessed as average time until B16 lamellipodia underwent collapse or retraction , as well as the directionality of migration were unchanged upon FMNL formin knockdown ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) , indicating that the observed reduction of migration was directly coupled to limited protrusion . FMNL2 / 3 knockdown affects various lamellipodial parameters . It is commonly assumed that protrusion rates of lamellipodia are regulated by the polymerization of ﬁlaments within the network , but also by their stiffness or anchorage of the network to further proximal regions or the underlying substratum 3 , 41 , 42 . FMNL2 was previously proposed to contribute to protrusion by accelerating the elongation of actin ﬁlaments branched by Arp2 / 3 complex 3 , 29 . To explore this possibility experimentally , also in light of enhanced nucleation observed for FMNL3 , we ﬁrst determined polymerization rates of lamellipodial actin networks relative to protruding front and underlying substratum 25 . The speed of rearward translocation of lamellipodial actin networks and hence their rate of polymerization has previously been visualized and quantiﬁed essentially by two experimental approaches : ( i ) bleaching or photoactivation of networks co - incorporating tagged actin variants 25 , 43 or ( ii ) tracking of actin speckles or of ﬂuorescent inhomogeneities of factors bound to these actin networks 44 – 46 . Here , we have employed both approaches . Unexpectedly , however , rates of lamellipodial actin network translocation were much less prominently reduced in FMNL2 / 3 double - knockdown cells as compared to controls than the average protrusion rates of the same cells , irrespective of whether network translocation rates were determined by ﬂuorescence recovery of photobleaching ( FRAP ) of EGFP - b - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b , Supplementary Movie 5 ) or , alternatively , by following translocation of EGFP - lifeact speckles ( Supplementary Fig . 8c , d ) . The lifeact approach was also chosen as control , as EGFP - b - actin overexpression modestly increased protrusion rates irrespective of RNAi treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 8b , left panel ) , for unknown reasons but consistent with previous observations 47 . Nevertheless , actin polymerization rates of lamellipodia networks were identical in cells expressing EGFP - actin versus EGFP - lifeact , irrespective of formin knockdown , reassuring the conclusion of unchanged actin network assembly rates in these experimental conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 8b , d , right panels ) . These data revealed that reduction of protrusion upon FMNL2 / 3 knockdown cannot be explained by reduced polymerization rates of underlying actin networks , as one would expect from current models of lamellipodium protrusion 3 , 42 . More speciﬁcally , these observations are inconsistent with the currently prevalent view of actin assembly factors such as FMNL formins to simply accelerate the growth of lamellipodial actin networks by stochastically capturing and elongating F - actin barbed ends generated by Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching 3 , 29 . However , when exploring additional parameters of lamellipodial protrusion and structure , we found that various features of lamellipodia were markedly changed upon FMNL2 / 3 knockdown . First , lamellipodia in knockdown cells were narrower than in control cells , apparent already in EGFP - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 actin and lifeact movies ( Supplementary Fig . 8 , Supplementary Movie 5 ) . This was substantiated by quantiﬁcation of lamellipo - dial width upon knockdown of FMNL formins in various combinations ( Fig . 3a , b ) .

ADF / coﬁlin proteins are invariably inactivated by phosphorylation on serine 3 , so we quantiﬁed levels of phosphorylated , inactive coﬁlin 1 , the largely ubiquitous family member , as well as of total coﬁlin 1 by western blotting ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . However , coﬁlin 1 expression was unchanged upon transient FMNL2 / 3 knockdown as compared to controls , whereas levels of phosphorylated , inactive coﬁlin were even increased . These data suggest that formin knockdown - induced lamellipodial narrowing cannot be caused by an increase of ADF / coﬁlin activity . Interestingly , the apparent decrease in coﬁlin 1 activity might be caused by compensatory mechanisms , as wild - type levels of coﬁlin activity should cause even more pronounced lamellipodial narrowing . We next examined the overall structure of the lamellipodium in mock - treated versus FMNL2 / 3 knockdown cells , the latter of which appeared less organized , with lower numbers of embedded microspike bundles ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Quantiﬁcation of microspike bundles using phalloidin ( Fig . 3c ) or its most prominent constituent fascin 50 ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) revealed a reduction upon individual or combined knockdown of both FMNL2 and FMNL3 . The observed effects on bundle frequency within the lamellipodium and established functions of these formins in ﬁlament formation in vitro prompted us to examine the density of lamellipodial actin networks , irrespective of the already apparent overall reduction of ﬁlament mass due to lamellipodial narrowing . Interestingly , phalloidin intensities of double - knockdown cells were further reduced to roughly 60 % of the levels observed in control cells ( Fig . 3d – f ) . To explore whether ﬁlament loss was speciﬁc for the formin pathway or also had an impact on Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin network generation , we also stained for incorporation of endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex into these lamellipodia , which was not reduced upon formin knockdown ( Fig . 3g , h ) . Collectively , these data suggest that although incapable of generating lamellipodia without the Arp2 / 3 - dependent branching pathway ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) , FMNL formins contribute signiﬁcantly to mass and structure of lamellipodial actin networks , with potential impact on their mechanical stability and protrusion effectivity aside from their sole role in regulating protrusion rates ( Fig . 2 ) . This view was further supported by the observation that FMNL2 / 3 double - knockdown cells displayed ﬂuctuations of the lamellipodial tip membrane—indicative of inefﬁcient protrusion—much more frequently than mock cells , which consistently protruded in a smooth , continuous fashion in these migration conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , d , Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Thus , we sought to assess potential effects of FMNL loss of function on protrusion stability and force . Generation and characterization of FMNL - deﬁcient B16 cells . To extend our studies to ultrastructural analyses and force measurements requiring complete absence of FMNL function at the single cell level , which is impossible to achieve per deﬁnition by RNA interference , we genetically disrupted FMNL2 and FMNL3 genes in B16 cells using CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome editing . We initially isolated clonal cell populations with dis - rupted expression of either FMNL2 or FMNL3 alone followed by disruption of the respective other gene . In total , one KO for each gene and two independently generated double - KO clones were analysed further ( Fig . 4a , b ) . In general , CRISPR / Cas9 - treated cells displayed phenotypes remarkably similar to RNAi - mediated knockdowns , conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of either approach . In analogy to RNAi experiments , all formin KO cell populations displayed reduced lamellipodial widths , microspike numbers and lamellipodial F - actin intensities , albeit to variable extents . Loss of FMNL2 alone generally caused weaker phenotypes than loss of FMNL3 , and double - KOs on average displayed stronger phenotypes than individual KOs ( Fig . 4c – e ) . Importantly , both FMNL2 / 3 double - KO clones also lacked any detectable staining of FMNL protein at the lamellipodium tip ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , conﬁrming speciﬁcity of the antibody employed previously for FMNL2 / 3 immunolabelling 29 . Reduction of actin ﬁlament intensity was particularly evident upon FMNL2 / 3 loss of function ( Fig . 4e ) , whereas endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex appeared incorporated at virtually equal levels in the lamellipodia of control versus double - KO cell lines ( Fig . 4f , g ) . Along these lines , a 5 - min treatment of B16 control and FMNL2 / 3 double - KO cells ( F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 ) with the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK666 ( 210 m M ) reduced lamellipodial width by about one - third for both cell types ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . These data suggest that sensitivity to interference with Arp2 / 3 complex function is independent of FMNL formin expression . The average reduction of lamellipodium width upon loss of FMNL2 and - 3 was again not caused by an increase in ADF / coﬁlin function , as both coﬁlin 1 levels and activity were not considerably changed in FMNL2 / 3 double - KO cell lines ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Importantly , both double - KO cell lines also displayed signiﬁcantly reduced protrusion rates ( Fig . 5a , b ) and migration efﬁciencies ( Supplementary Fig . 15a , b ) , and were phenocopies of FMNL2 / 3 double - RNAi cells concerning increased frequencies of cells displaying ﬂuctuating protrusions ( Supplementary Fig . 15c , d ) . Correlation analysis of protrusion features of pooled double - KO and wild - type B16 lamellipodia revealed a clear correlation between protrusion velocity and lamellipodial width in these experimental conditions , and showed that the observed ﬂuctuation behaviour preferentially occurred below speciﬁc threshold levels for both parameters ( see colour code in Supplementary Fig . 15e ) . None of these lamellipodial phenotypes were caused by evident changes in adhesion patterns , as staining the focal adhesion component vinculin followed by machine - aided quantiﬁcation revealed no changes in the different cell lines , neither in average size nor number of adhesions ( Supplementary Fig . 16a – c ) . The relative percentage of focal versus nascent adhesions , with the latter being deﬁned as o 0 . 2 m m 2 in size , was also unchanged upon FMNL2 / 3 removal ( Supplementary Fig . 16d ) . We thus conclude that lamellipodial phenotypes are not caused by changes in adhesion or traction forces , but instead by more direct means . However , combined genetic disruption of FMNL2 and - 3 in this cell type did not reduce rates of lamellipodial actin network assembly ( Fig . 5c , d ) , in spite of signiﬁcant reduction of protrusion analysed in parallel , again consistent with RNAi data ( see above and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Altogether , these results set the stage for examining the mechanistic reasons for the reduced protrusion phenotype observed , including analysis of force development of respective lamellipodia upon FMNL formin loss of function , as well as ultrastructural organization of underlying actin networks . FMNL removal abrogates force generation by B16 lamellipodia . To determine lamellipodial forces that can be exerted against obstacles , beads mounted on atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) cantilevers were positioned right in front of protruding double - KO ( F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 ) or B16 control lamellipodia . Protrusion was observed by phase - contrast microscopy , and vertical and lateral cantilever deﬂections were recorded over time ( Fig . 6a and NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 B16 - F1 a b FMNL2FMNL3 Tubulin 150 kDa 130 kDa 55 kDa * c NS NS F2 / F3 KO # 1 / 3 B16 - F1 d e g f 2 , 500 2 , 000 F - a c t i n i n t en s i t y ( c oun t s pe r p i x e l ) 1 , 500 1 , 000 500 0 2 , 000 1 , 800 1 , 600 1 , 400 1 , 200 p16 A i n t en s i t y ( c oun t s pe r p i x e l ) 1 , 000 800 600 400 200 0 F M N L2 K O # 45 F M N L3 K O # 3 B 16 - F 1 B 16 - F 1 F 2 / F 3 K O # 1 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 44 / 3 4 . 5 4 . 0 3 . 5 n = 92 2 . 84 1 . 94 1 . 85 1 . 80 2 . 62 n = 110 n = 113 n = 117 n = 118 3 . 0 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 * * * B 16 - F 1 F 2 K O # 45 F 3 K O # 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 1 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 44 / 3 * * * * * * * * * 0 . 5 35 30 25 20 n = 105 n = 105 n = 111 n = 111 n = 109 13 1 , 178 762 610 645 560 11 9 8 7 15 10 5 0 NS * * * B 16 - F 1 B 16 - F 1 F 2 K O # 45 F 3 K O # 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 1 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 44 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 1 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 44 / 3 * * * n = 100 FMNL2 KO # 45 FMNL3 KO # 3 F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 F2 / F3 KO # 1 / 3 668 . 4 600 . 8 670 . 4 n = 100 n = 99 n = 138 n = 105 n = 105 n = 112 n = 111 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * B 16 - F 1 F 2 K O # 45 F 3 K O # 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 1 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 44 / 3 La m e lli pod i u m w i d t h ( µ m ) N u m be r o f m i c r o s p i k e s pe r c e ll anti - p16A anti - p16A anti - p16A F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 * Figure 4 | Knockout of FMNL2 / 3 recapitulates RNAi phenotypes .

Deﬂections were computed into forward forces , plotted over time ( Fig . 6b , c ) and used for determination of protrusion forces ( Fig . 6d ) . Twelve wild - type B16 lamellipodia exerted an average protrusion force of 5 . 6 ± 2 . 3 nN , which was reduced by 75 % to 1 . 4 ± 0 . 6 nN in FMNL2 / 3 null cells ( n ¼ 7 ) . This average reduction is even underestimated , since four cells clearly touched the beads , but the forces exerted by them were below the resolution of the cantilevers employed , so we excluded them from further analysis . Furthermore , upon extended lamellipodial - bead contact , KO cells frequently failed to move their cell bodies 0 33 B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO # 1 / 3 F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 0 8 0 8 0 8 Time ( min ) 0 . 821 0 . 901 1 . 272 n = 101 n = 109 n = 124 * * * * * * B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO # 1 / 3 F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 b d a c 3 . 989 4 . 167 3 . 998 n = 94 n = 82 n = 87 A c t i n a ss e m b l y r a t e ( µ m m i n – 1 ) NS NS 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 . 936 0 . 888 1 . 408 n = 94 n = 82 n = 87 P r o t r u s i on v e l o c i t y ( µ m m i n – 1 ) * * * * * * 0 1 2 3 4 EGFP - lifeact EGFP - lifeact EGFP - lifeact 3 . 68 µ m min – 1 3 . 88 µ m min – 1 3 . 88 µ m min – 1 0 0 4 22 35 47 23 7 16 23 29 4 9 17 0 B 16 - F 1 F 2 / F 3 K O # 1 / 3 F 2 / F 3 K O # 44 / 3 B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO # 1 / 3 F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO # 1 / 3 F2 / F3 KO # 44 / 3 P r o t r u s i on v e l o c i t y ( µ m m i n – 1 ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 D i s t an c e ( µ m ) Figure 5 | Reduced protrusion in FMNL2 / 3 KO is not caused by decreased network polymerization .

Together , these data clearly reveal a remarkable loss of ability to exert lamellipodial forces upon FMNL loss of function , although effects on actin networks—at least at the light microscopy level—appeared comparably modest . This phenotype and the lack of changes in traction forces ( see above ) prompted us to explore the ultrastructural organization of FMNL - deﬁcient lamellipodia by electron tomography of negatively stained samples . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 – 1 Time F o r w a r d f o r c e ( n N ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 – 1 F o r w a r d f o r c e ( n N ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO * * * P r o t r u s i on f o r c e ( n N ) II III IV I f g F il a m en t den s i t y ( n m – 1 ) 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 . 0 B16 - F1 B16 - F1 B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO F2 / F3 KO B16 - F1 F2 / F3 KO F2 / F3 KO * * * F r a c t i on ( % ) 15 10 5 0 Angle to cell edge ( ° ) 051015202530354045505560657075808590051015202530354045505560657075808590 0 100 200 300 400 600 500 Time ( sec ) 0 100 200 300 400 600 500 Time ( sec ) a b c d e Figure 6 | Loss of FMNL2 / 3 affects ultrastructure and force generation of lamellipodia .

ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications FMNL2 / 3 KO causes ultrastructural changes in lamellipodia . Reduction in force development of lamellipodial networks could be theoretically caused by multiple parameters , including numbers and angles of ﬁlaments abutting the protruding membrane . As opposed to Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition , which eliminated actin networks reminiscent of lamellipodia and actin network treadmilling 51 , FMNL formin - deﬁcient lamellipodial networks polymerized actin in a treadmilling fashion ( Fig . 5c , d ) and looked similar to controls at ﬁrst glance ( Fig . 6e ) . However , computer - assisted assessment of ﬁlament numbers at the lamellipodium tip ( within a region of approximately 1 m m from the edge ) conﬁrmed a clear and statistically signiﬁcant reduction in ﬁlament mass ( Fig . 6f ) , consistent with our observations using ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Fig . 4e ) . In addition , both control and knockout lamellipodia displayed a wide range of ﬁlament angles abutting the protruding front , with two clear peaks at around 45 (cid:2) and 80 (cid:2) relative to the edge in controls ( Fig . 6g ) . In contrast , the distribution of ﬁlament angles in FMNL2 / 3 - deﬁcient B16 lamellipodia was slightly different , as the two peaks were less clearly separated and fractions of ﬁlaments with close to orthogonal angles underrepresented as compared to controls ( Fig . 6g ) . Together , in spite of comparably subtle changes in ultrastructural organization of freely protruding ﬁlament networks , FMNL formin removal causes clear changes in ﬁlament mass and orientation in these structures , possibly rendering them less prone to exert required pushing forces when confronted with obstacles . FMNL2 / 3 KO in ﬁbroblasts impairs lamellipodia and migration . B16 - F1 melanoma cells are a widely used model system of migration and lamellipodium protrusion 19 , 42 , but to conﬁrm the general relevance of our observations , we extended our studies to a commonly used ﬁbroblast cell line . CRISPR / Cas9 - treatment of NIH 3T3 cells allowed us to generate independent lines null for FMNL3 and displaying very low gene dose of FMNL2 , the latter being present with multiple distinct alleles ( see Methods ) . Remarkably , FMNL2 / 3 - depleted NIH 3T3 cell clones ( Supple - mentary Fig . 17a , b ) formed lamellipodia with moderately reduced widths ( Supplementary Fig . 17c ) , harbouring signiﬁcantly diminished actin ﬁlament intensities ( Supplementary Fig . 17d ) , again with unchanged Arp2 / 3 complex incorporation ( Supplementary Fig . 17e , f ) . These phenotypes were fully compatible with those established for RNAi - or CRISPR / Cas9 - treated B16 cells ( see above ) . Although general adhesion patterns were again highly similar in control versus FMNL2 / 3 - depleted NIH 3T3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) , migration rates of these ﬁbroblasts were reduced to approximately half of controls ( Fig . 7a ) . As membrane rufﬂing activity common to migrating ﬁbroblasts hampered AFM measurements , we explored migration of these cells through media with variable viscosity ( Fig . 7b , c ) , which linearly oppose cell motion by Stokes friction . Consistently , increasing concentrations ( up to 4 % ) of the inert , water - soluble polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) , a thickening agent used previously for increasing the viscosity of tissue culture media 52 , linearly decreased the migration of control NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 7b ) . Moreover , although control ﬁbroblasts displayed no detectable defect in migrating through medium containing 1 % PVP , this concentration was sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly impair the migration of FMNL2 / 3 - depleted ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 7c ) . We thus conclude FMNL2 / 3 loss of function to signiﬁcantly lower the ability of cells to cope with counteracting forces during migration , as exempliﬁed by employing medium of increased viscosity . Discussion It is well established that the Rac / WAVE / Arp2 / 3 complex pathway is essential for generation and maintenance of lamellipodia 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 40 , 51 , 53 – 56 . Much less is known about how actin ﬁlament elongators such as formins and Ena / VASP family proteins contribute to protrusion and thus lamellipodia - dependent migration 12 , 14 , 57 . In the current view , Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching of the network provides stability and persistence of protrusion 3 , 41 , 42 , whereas protrusion rate is thought to derive from actin ﬁlament elongation by polymerases located at the tip membrane , such as FMNL formins 3 , 12 . According to this model , FMNL - deﬁcient lamellipodia would protrude slowly but persistently , and constitute Arp2 / 3 - dependent networks capable of resisting counteracting force . In contrast , high formin activity would stimulate rapidly growing lamellipodia , with increased elongation and decreased branching activity as well as lamellipodial stability . Hence , increased formin activity and thus lamellipodial actin ﬁlament elongation should also coincide with decreased , average Arp2 / 3 complex incorporation . Clearly , our data call for revision of this view . Consistent with previously published data on FMNL2 knockdown 29 , functional interference with FMNL3 or both FMNL2 and - 3 reduced protrusion , but not due to decreased rates of actin network polymerization , as previously assumed 3 , 29 . Instead , we conclude that reduction of protrusion was accompanied and caused by loss of speciﬁc , formin - dependent ﬁlaments , contributing to sufﬁcient lamellipodial ﬁlament mass and bundling activity , and to the ﬁlament population pushing the tip membrane at close - to - orthogonal angles relative to the front ( see Fig . 8 ) . Remarkably , FMNL formin - deﬁcient lamellipodia were weak and unable to exert pushing forces comparable to formin - ﬁlament containing controls , although Arp2 / 3 complex incorporation was quantitatively unchanged as compared to control cell lamellipodia . We note that it is impossible at present to formally exclude that observed phenotypes are not or not entirely connected ; hence , more indirect effects potentially caused by FMNL formin removal such as the strength of the lamellipodium / lamella connection and / or force transmission from the lamellipodium to the lamella behind could also contribute to generating ﬂuctuating protrusions and loss of force development . However , we consider the ultrastructural changes within lamellipodia themselves as more likely to impact the forces exerted by these structures , but to conﬁrm this directly , future experimental efforts , including exciting recent developments such as high throughput cryo - tomography of both thin lamellipodia and thicker cellular structures such as the lamella might be required 58 . In any case , our data also suggest that branched dendritic networks alone without the action of formins or additional polymerases will not be efﬁcient in counteracting the forces needed for effective protrusion , as for instance squeezing of lamellipodia - like structures through narrow pores or in between cells in 3D migration in vivo . Consistent with this view , overexpression of both FMNL2 and FMNL3 formins was previously found to correlate with invasion and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma 59 , 60 . Instead of promoting the collective elongation of all ﬁlaments within the network , we conclude FMNL2 / 3 to nucleate and elongate individual ﬁlaments , the presence of which is essential for rapid and smooth protrusion as well as efﬁcient cell migration . Thus , our data also imply that in spite of homogenized rates of polymerization at the membrane , lamellipodial networks cannot be simply viewed as sole mass of homogenous ﬁlaments , but instead as collection of branched and unbranched ﬁlament populations of various kinds all harbouring speciﬁc features . More speciﬁcally , although ﬁlament loss and thus structural considerations alone could potentially explain observed phenotypes , accompanied loss of ﬁlament population - speciﬁc or network geometry - sensitive actin - binding proteins such as crosslinkers could also account , at least in part , for observed NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 effects . Notwithstanding this , the FMNL - generated , lamellipodial ﬁlaments studied here apparently not only contribute to average network mass , but also to ﬁlament bundling , and hence stabilization and force development of these actin networks built downstream of Rac , but co - regulated by Cdc42 .

All cells were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C in the presence of 7 . 5 % CO 2 . DNA constructs .

FMNL2 / 3 KO Control Cofilin Cappingprotein Arp2 / 3 complex Formin Profilin - actin Actin Figure 8 | Model summarizing FMNL2 / 3 loss of function phenotype . Lamellipodial actin ﬁlament networks are generated and turned over by combined activities of ﬁlament assembly factors ( Arp2 / 3 complex and formins ) , disassembly factors such as coﬁlin and by capping protein . As opposed to the branching activity of Arp2 / 3 complex , lamellipodial formins FMNL2 and FMNL3 are not essential for the generation of lamellipodial actin networks , but proposed to generate speciﬁc subsets of ﬁlaments contributing to the density and mechanical stability of lamellipodia , essential for effective protrusion and lamellipodial force generation ( FMNL2 / 3 KO ) during migration . ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications was generated using IMAGE Clone IRAKp961L0355Q ( imaGenes , Germany ) encoding residues 63 – 1028 of the murine FMNL3 sequence . For generation of FMNL3 full length , the N - terminus ( aa 1 – 103 ) was ampliﬁed from mouse B16 cDNA and fused to the FMNL3 D N sequence by using an internal BspEI restriction enzyme site . For generation of EGFP - tagged FMNL3 , the full - length cDNA was fused into EGFP - C3 using XhoI / BamHI restriction enzymes . Subsequently , full - length FMNL3 was ampliﬁed without stop codon using respective primers , subcloned into EGFP - N3 and named FMNL3 - EGFP . Truncated variants such as EGFP - FMNL3 D DAD were generated by PCR with respective primers using EGFP - FMNL3 as template . For generation of FMNL2 cDNA and EGFP - FMNL2 D DAD , see ref . 29 . EGFP - FMNL2 - A272E and EGFP - FMNL3 - A275E were generated by site - directed mutagenesis using Qiagen site - directed mutagenesis kit employing forward primer 5 0 - GTCTTAGAACTGTTGGCAGAGGTTTGTCTTGTCAGAG GCG - 3 0 ( in case of FMNL2 ) and 5 0 - TGGAGCTGCTGGCAGAGGTGTGTTTGG TGCGG - 3 0 ( in case of FMNL3 ) , and the respective complementary sequences as reverse primers . For generation of FMNL1 expression constructs , the cDNA of full - length FMNL1 ( isoform 1 , residues 1 – 1100 ) , UniProt accession number O95466 , was purchased as synthetic expression construct from GeneArt ( Life Technologies ) . For EGFP - tagging , the full length sequence was ampliﬁed using forward primer 5 0 - GAGGAATTCATGGGCAATGCTGCCGG - 3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 - GAGGGATCCCTAGTGGTGGTGATGATGG - 3 0 harbouring a stop codon , and ligated into EGFP - C2 using EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes . All constructs were sequence veriﬁed . PRK5 - myc - Cdc42 - L61 and pRK5 - myc - Rac1 - L61 were kind gifts from Laura Machesky ( Beatson Institute , Glasgow , UK ) . EGFP - lifeact was kindly provided by Roland Wedlich - So¨ldner ( University of Mu¨nster , Germany ) . Constructs for protein expression were prepared as follows : the C - terminal half of human FMNL3 ( residues 498 – 1028 ; NCBI reference : NP _ 035841 . 1 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR from cDNA using primers 5 0 - CGCGGATCCATCCCACCCTC TGACTTGGACCTG - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - CGCGTCGACCTAACAGTTTGACTC GTCATGGTG - 3 0 ( reverse ) , and ligated into pGEX - 6P - 1 - SNAP expression vector 61 using BamHI and SalI - restriction sites . The C - terminal half of human Drf3 ( mDia2 ; residues 555 – 1110 ) was ampliﬁed with primers 5 0 - GCGGAATTCCCAG CTGATTGTAATATTCCTTTG - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - CGCGTCGACTTATAAATA CGGTTTATTACCATGGTT - 3 0 ( reverse ) , and inserted into EcoRI and SalI - sites of pGEX - 6P - 1 - SNAP . The FMNL2 - 8P fragment ( residues 566 – 1092 , containing eight consecutive proline residues 29 ) was subcloned into the SalI - and NotI - sites of pGEX - 6P - 1 - SNAP . The N - terminus of FMNL2 - 21P was slightly extended in sequence ( corresponding to residues 548 – 1092 , containing 21 consecutive proline residues ) using primers 5 0 - GCGGTCGACGTTACCCCGCCGATGCCTCC GCCC - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - CGCGCGGCCGCTCACATTGTTATTTCGGCACC ATTAAC - 3 0 ( reverse ) , again followed by ligation into SalI - and NotI - sites of pGEX - 6P - 1 - SNAP . Protein expression and ﬂuorescence labelling . C - terminal halves of formins were expressed in fusion to both GST and SNAP - tag for puriﬁcation and potential ﬂuorescent labelling , respectively . GST - tagged SNAP - FMNL2 - 8P / 21P ( FMNL2 - 8P / 21P ) , SNAP - FMNL3 ( FMNL3 ) and SNAP - Drf3 ( Drf3 ) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain ArcticExpress after induction with 0 . 7mM IPTG at 12 (cid:2) C and OD 2 . After 20h , the respective GST - tagged proteins were puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography using glutathione - conjugated agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . As opposed to previous studies using GST - tagged FMNL2 ( refs 29 , 35 ) , the GST - tag was subsequently cleaved off by incubation with PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) overnight , and uncleaved GST - SNAP - formin fragments and GST were removed by a second afﬁnity chromatography step with glutathione - agarose . Proteins were further puriﬁed by size exclusion chromatography on an A¨kta Puriﬁer System equipped with a HiLoad 26 / 60 Superdex S200 column ( GE Healthcare ) . Fractions containing formin fragments were pooled , dialysed against storage buffer ( 150mM KCl , 1mM DTT , 60 % glycerol and 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 ) and stored at (cid:2) 20 (cid:2) C . All assays were performed with unlabelled , SNAP - tagged FMNL fragments , since labelling with benzylguanine - coupled ﬂuorescent probes ( SNAP Surface 488 / 549 , New England Biolabs ) interfered with formin activity . Expression and puriﬁcation of untagged human proﬁlin I ( PFN ) was performed by polyproline afﬁnity chromatography . Of note , the inhibition of spontaneous actin assembly in pyrene - assays seen previously with the GST - tagged C - terminus of FMNL2 ( ref . 29 ) was not observed with SNAP - FMNL2 , indicating that additional dimerization through GST might inﬂuence the capability of formin dimers to shield barbed ends . All additional experiments were thus performed with SNAP - tagged formin variants . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was extracted and puriﬁed from acetone powder using standard procedures . Fractions of G - actin were labelled with ATTO 565 maleimide ( ATTO - TEC ) and with N - ( 1 - Pyrene ) maleimide ( Life Technologies ) at Cys374 or with ATTO 488 NHS - ester ( ATTO - TEC ) at lysine residues following standard procedures . Pyrene - actin polymerization assays . Polymerization of 2 m M rabbit skeletal muscle G - actin ( 5 % pyrene - labelled ) was initiated with 1 (cid:3) KMEI - polymerization buffer ( 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA and 10mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) and in the presence of various concentrations of FMNL or Drf3 fragments with or without 10 m M PFN , and was monitored in 96 - well plates by a Synergy 4 ﬂuor - escence microplate reader ( Biotek ) . Maximum slopes of polymerization curves were determined by linear regression and averaged , n ¼ 4 . The slopes were normalized and plotted against the concentration of the respective formin construct . TIRF microscopy . For total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy , FMNL fragments ( 1 , 10 or 100nM ﬁnal concentration ) and PFN ( 5 m M ﬁnal concentration ) were ﬁrst pre - diluted in 1 (cid:3) TIRF buffer ( 20mM imidazole pH 7 . 4 , 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 20mM b - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 5mM ATP , 15mM glucose , 2 . 5mgml (cid:2) 1 methylcellulose ( 4 , 000 cP ) , 20 m gml (cid:2) 1 catalase , 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 glucose - oxidase ) . The assays were started by adding G - actin ( 1 m M ﬁnal concentration , 10 % ATTO488 - labelled at lysine residues , 5 % ATTO565 - labelled at Cys374 ) and ﬂushing the mixtures into mPEG - silane ( Laysan Bio ) - coated ﬂow chambers . All assays were performed using this mixture of actin variants , allowing clear distinction between formin - elongated actin ﬁlaments in the presence of proﬁlin , which appeared green due to the low afﬁnity of the cysteine - labelled actin for proﬁlin 62 versus non - formin - associated / freely growing ﬁlaments , which appeared reddish to yellow due to lack of preference for any of the two coloured actin variants ( see Fig . 1e ) . At the imaging conditions used , the ATTO565 - labelled probe was brighter than the ATTO488 - labelled one . Thus , in case of nucleation assays , red channel images displayed in black and white were shown for better visibility ( Fig . 1b ) . Images from a Nikon Eclipse TI - E inverted microscope equipped with a TIRF Apo (cid:3) 60 objective were captured every 4s with exposure times of 40ms using a Ixon3 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor ) for at least 10min and up to 20min . Time - lapse movies of at least two ( 10 – 100nM FMNL fragments ) and up to three ( 1nM FMNL fragments ) positions per experiment were acquired using a motorized microscope stage . The pixel size corresponded to 0 . 27 m m . Analysis of TIRF data . Elongation rates of ﬁlaments were measured by manual tracking of growing ﬁlament barbed ends using ImageJ software : total numbers of analysed ﬁlaments ( n ) were : 24 from three movies per condition in experiments without PFN ; 24 in actin controls including 5 m M PFN ; 30 in experiments with 5 m M PFN and 10nM FMNL2 or FMNL3 ; at least 35 ( including reddish control ﬁlaments ) from four movies per condition in experiments with 5 m M PFN and 1nM of either formin variant , 25 in the same experiment without formin . The nucleation efﬁcacies were obtained by counting and averaging the number of actin ﬁlaments in an area of 80 m m (cid:3) 80 m m at 180s from two positions of three independent experiments for each condition . For examining polymerization processivity , four experiments for each condition were analysed . Since many ﬁlament segments with sizes of 4 19 , 000 subunits had no determinable end points , they were grouped into one fraction . The total number of measured ﬁlament segments was 88 for FMNL2 - 21P , 63 for FMNL3 and 101 for FMNL2 - 8P . RNA interference . RNAi in mammalian cells was done using vectors driving the expression of short hairpin ( sh ) RNAs . RNAi vectors were purchased from InvivoGen . Targeting sequence causing knockdown of FMNL2 was 5 0 - GGAAGTC TGCGGATGAGATAT - 3 0 . Knockdown of FMNL3 was achieved using targeting sequence 5 0 - GGTGCAGATTCAAGCGTACCT - 3 0 . Combined transfection of these vectors was used to generate double - knockdown cells , denoted as FMNL2 þ FMNL3 RNAi . Targeting sequence 5 0 - GGAATTAAGAAGGCGACA AGT - 3 0 was found to affect expression of both FMNL2 and FMNL3 . Double - knockdown with the latter was denoted FMNL2 / 3 RNAi . All targeting sequences were fused into the psiRNA - h7SK vector backbone encoding a GFP or mCherry variant , respectively . A vector harbouring a scrambled sequence was used as RNAi control ( psiRNA - h7SK control ) . For FMNL formin knockdown , B16 cells were co - transfected with respective psiRNA - vectors plus a plasmid conferring resistance to puromycin ( pPUR , Clontech ) . Sixteen hours post - transfection , cells were trypsinized and subconﬂuently seeded using B16 medium supplemented with 2 . 5 m gml (cid:2) 1 puromycin to eliminate non - transfected cells . Protein rundown was routinely documented by western blotting . Knockdown efﬁciency was found to be optimal 4 days after transfection of respective constructs , on average ; so all analyses were performed at this time point . CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome editing . Selected DNA target sequences ( exon 1 in case of FMNL2 and FMNL3 ) were pasted into a CRISPR design tool ( http : / / tools . genome - engineering . org ) . Resulting potential target sites with a high efﬁciency score were used for designing the sgRNA constructs ( 20 nucleotides ) . In case of FMNL3 , used target sequence was 5 0 - GCAAGACGCCGATGCCCG AGC - 3 0 . Genome editing of FMNL2 was performed using guides 5 0 - ATGCCCGA GCCAGGTGAACT - 3 0 ( # 2 ) or 5 0 - GATGCCCGAGCCAGGTGAAC - 3 0 ( # 5 ) . Respective sequences were ligated into expression plasmid pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( Addgene plasmid ID : 48138 ) using BbsI ( ref . 63 ) . Sequence validation of CRISPR plasmids was performed using sequencing primer 5 0 - GCACCGACTCGGTGC CAC - 3 0 . For generation of genome - edited cell lines , B16 cells were transfected with mixtures of respective CRISPR plasmid and pPUR conferring puromycin resistance . Afterwards , transfected cells were selected with medium containing 2 . 5 m gml (cid:2) 1 puromycin for 4 days . In order to generate single cell colonies , cells were extensively diluted and cultured in conditioned medium until they reached NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 13 macroscopically visible size . Single colonies were picked and expanded . Cell lysates were generated and tested for FMNL expression by western blotting . Cell colonies that lacked expression of the target protein were genotyped as follows . Upon expansion and growth to conﬂuence in 6cm dishes , cells were trypsinized , pelleted and lysed adding 500 m l lysis buffer ( 100mM Tris pH 8 . 5 , 5mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % SDS , 200mM NaCl ) containing 2 . 5 m l proteinase K ( 20mgml (cid:2) 1 ) . Samples were incubated overnight at 55 (cid:2) C . Nucleic acid extraction was performed by a standard phenol / chloroform precipitation procedure . Isolated genomic DNA was used as template in PCR reactions using Phusion High - Fidelty Polymerase as recommended by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs ) . Primers used for ampliﬁcation of respective target gene loci were : 5 0 - CATGGGCAACGCGGGG AGC - 3 0 ( fwd ) ; 5 0 - CGAGGTGCTGCTCCCGCCAG - 3 0 ( rev ) in case of FMNL2 and 5 0 - CGATGGGCAACCTGGAGAGCACC - 3 0 ( fwd ) ; 5 0 - GGAATGGAATTCCGGC AGCGGACC - 3 0 ( rev ) in case of FMNL3 . PCR products ( B 350bp ) were examined on 2 % agarose gels and appropriate samples puriﬁed with NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean - up kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Macherey & Nagel ) . DNA fragments were cloned into a zero blunt TOPO vector ( Zero Blunt TOPO Cloning Kit for Sequencing , Invitrogen ) as recommended by the manufacturer . Single bacterial colonies were inoculated overnight and plasmid DNA puriﬁed using NucleoSpin Plasmid kit ( Macherey & Nagel ) . Sequencing of isolated plasmid DNA was carried out by MWG - Biotech ( Ebersberg , Germany ) using sequencing primer 5 0 - CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC - 3 0 . Clones were examined for frameshift mutations and monoallelic or biallelic deletions / insertions . Mutations or deletions generating stop codons shortly downstream of the target site were deﬁned as ‘null’ alleles . Cell populations exclusively harbouring such alleles among 4 10 sequencing reactions were selected for further analyses . FMNL2 / 3 double - KO B16 cells were generated by editing of FMNL3 followed by FMNL2 . Genome editing in murine NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts was performed with the same reagents and following the same procedures as with B16 cells , except that constructs targeting FMNL2 and FMNL3 were transfected simultaneously using jetPRIME reagent ( Polyplus ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions , followed by selection of transfectants with 3 m gml (cid:2) 1 puromycin . Isolated , individual clones were screened by western blotting , expanded and mutated loci sequenced as described above . Consistent with the established complex karyotype of NIH 3T3 , with the majority of the genome being at least tetraploid 64 , we found four distinct null alleles in case of FMNL3 ( 19 and 21 sequencing reactions for clone 9 and 46 , respectively ) . The genome of clone 9 harboured FMNL2 as multiple null alleles except for one in - frame deletion ( lacking 6 nucleotides ) and one wild - type allele ( out of 17 reactions in clone 9 ) . In clone 46 , we exclusively detected mutated FMNL2 alleles , all representing null alleles except for one reaction revealing an allele harbouring a 6 base pair and another revealing a 30 base pair in - frame deletion . Protein measurements and western blotting . For preparation of detergent - soluble extracts , cells were cultured to conﬂuence , washed three times with ice - cold 1 (cid:3) PBS ( Gibco ) , lysed in ice cold lysis - buffer ( 140mM KCl , 50mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 50mM NaF , 10mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton - X100 , supplemented with one mini complete protease inhibitor pill ( Roche ) ) , and collected using a cell scraper . Finally , cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 15min . Soluble protein concentrations were measured using standard Bradford assay and determined using a microplate reader ( Varioskan Flash , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Western blotting was done according to standard procedures and using primary antibodies as follows : FMNL2 / 3 ( Abcam ; # ab57963 ; 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) , GAPDH ( Calbiochem ; clone 6C5 ; # CB1001 ; 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) , a - Tubulin ( Synaptic Systems ; clone 3A2 ; # 302117 ; 1 : 50 , 000 dilution ) , phospho - coﬁlin ( Cell Signaling ; # 3311 ; 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) , coﬁlin 1 ( KG60 ; kindly provided by Walter Witke ; University of Bonn ; Germany 65 ; 1 : 500 dilution ) , FMNL1 ( Abcam ; # ab97456 ; 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) . Secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen . Primary antibodies in immunoblots were visualized with peroxidase - coupled anti - mouse IgG ( Dianova ; # 115 - 035 - 062 ; 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) or anti - rabbit IgG ( Dianova ; # 111 - 035 - 045 ; 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) . Uncropped images of most important western blots corresponding to Figs 2f and 4a are shown in Supplementary Fig . 19 . Western blot intensity measurements . Detergent - soluble extracts from control or knockdown / knockout cells were analysed and compared according to their expression levels of coﬁlin 1 and phospho - coﬁlin 1 ( inactive ) , respectively . Virtually identical results were obtained with total cell extracts ( for representative example see Supplementary Fig . 14c ) . To quantify protein levels , intensity measurements on exposed western blot membranes were performed using MetaMorph software . Identical rectangular regions were drawn around protein bands of interest . To eliminate background signals contributing to the intensities measured , regions of the same size were measured in background areas and subtracted from individual , cor - responding protein bands . Intensities of measured protein bands were normalized to those of corresponding loading controls ( housekeeping genes , such as GAPDH ) . Corresponding data were plotted as bar charts using Excel 2010 ( Microsoft ) . Immunoﬂuorescence staining and quantiﬁcation . For immunolabelling of Arp2 / 3 complex , B16 or NIH 3T3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with laminin ( Sigma ) or ﬁbronectin ( Roche ) , respectively . Laminin was diluted to 25 m gml (cid:2) 1 in 50mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150mM NaCl and incubated for 60min on coverslips before cell seeding . Fibronectin was diluted to 25 m gml (cid:2) 1 in PBS . Cells were allowed to adhere overnight . Next , cells were ﬁxed with prewarmed , 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 20min and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 in PBS for 1min . Cells were blocked with 5 % horse serum in 1 % BSA in PBS , followed by staining with monoclonal p16A antibody 66 ( clone 323H3 ; undiluted hybridoma supernatant ) . Anti - FMNL2 / 3 staining shown in Supplementary Fig . 12 was performed using FMNL2 / 3 - reactive antibody ( Abcam ; # ab57963 ; 1 : 50 dilution ) after ﬁxation of B16 as well as FMNL2 / 3 KO cells treated with aluminium ﬂuoride for 20min , to stimulate lamellipodia 8 . For fascin stainings using monoclonal antibody 55K2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; # SC - 21743 ; 1 : 20 dilution ) , cells were ﬁxed with ice - cold methanol . To visualize the actin cytoskeleton in these samples , an actin antibody ( Sigma ; # A2066 ; 1 : 50 dilution ) recognizing its epitope upon methanol ﬁxation was employed . For phalloidin stainings , cells were ﬁxed with a mixture of 4 % PFA and 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde for 20min , enabling optimal preservation of the actin cytoskeleton . For Arp2 / 3 inhibition with CK666 , B16 cells migrating on laminin o / n were transferred into fresh growth medium containing 210 m M inhibitor or vehicle control for 5min , followed by ﬁxation and phalloidin staining . Primary antibodies in immunoﬂuorescence stainings were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 - ( 1 : 400 dilution ) or Alexa Fluor 594 - coupled ( 1 : 200 dilution ) anti - mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ; # A11029 or # A11032 , respectively ) . Secondary antibodies against rabbit primary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 - ( 1 : 400 dilution ) or Alexa Fluor 594 - coupled ( 1 : 200 dilution ) anti - rabbit IgG ( Invitrogen , # A11034 or # A11037 , respectively ) . Alexa Fluor 488 - and Alexa Fluor 594 - coupled phalloidin were also from Invitrogen ( # A12379 and # A12381 , respectively ) . Fluorescence intensities of lamellipodial components such as actin or p16A were determined by deﬁning a region restricted to the lamellipodium and a larger , extracellular region ( deﬁned as background ) . Average pixel intensities in background regions were subtracted from average intensities in lamellipodial regions . Net ﬂuorescence intensities in lamellipodial regions were shown as raw data in box and whiskers plots . Focal adhesions were visualized using a vinculin - reactive antibody ( Sigma , # V9131 , 1 : 250 dilution ) . To reduce unspeciﬁc background staining , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton - X100 in 4 % PFA / PBS for 1min before 20min ﬁxation with 4 % PFA / PBS . Quantiﬁcations of adhesion numbers and sizes were performed using ImageJ ( particle analysis plugin ) by manually setting appropriate thresholds . Owing to strong , nonspeciﬁc background ﬂuorescence around the nucleus , only focal adhesions below lamellipodium and lamella region covering a large part of the cell surface from behind the lamellipodium till close to the nucleus were included into quantiﬁcations ( see respective regions in Supplementary Figs 15 and 17 ) . Data were plotted as bar charts using Excel 2010 . Time - lapse microscopy and quantiﬁcation of protrusion rates . Live cell imaging was done with B16 cells seeded on laminin ( Sigma ) - coated glass coverslips ( 25 m gml (cid:2) 1 ) or with Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Rac1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( clone 3 ) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts plated on ﬁbronectin ( 25 m gml (cid:2) 1 , Roche ) . Cells were observed in an open heating chamber ( Warner Instruments , Reading , UK ) with a heater controller ( Model TC - 324 B , SN 1176 ) at 37 (cid:2) C . Cells were maintained in microscopy medium ( F12 HAM HEPES - buffered medium , Sigma ) including 10 % FCS , 2mM L - glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Conventional video microscopy was performed on an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 100TV , Zeiss ) equipped with an HXP 120 lamp for epiﬂuorescence illumination , a halogen lamp for phase - contrast imaging and a Coolsnap - HQ2 camera ( Photometrics ) . The microscope also comprises a ﬁlter wheel ( LUDL Electronic Products LTD , SN : 102691 and driver SN : 1029595 ) and elec - tronic shutters driven by MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Live cell images were obtained with (cid:3) 40 / 1 . 3NA , (cid:3) 63 / 1 . 4NA or (cid:3) 100 / 1 . 4NA Plan apochromatic oil objectives as well as with (cid:3) 100 / 1 . 3NA Plan Neoﬂuar oil objectives . Lamellipodium protrusion was determined based on kymographs generated from time - lapse images as follows : lamellipodia of B16 cells were recorded over a time period of at least 10min acquiring images every 5s . Kymographs were generated using MetaMorph software by drawing lines from inside the cell and across the lamellipodium . Corresponding regions from each time point of a time - lapse series were pasted next to each other along the x axis . Protrusion rates were determined by measuring advancement of lamellipodia tips ( y axis ) over time ( x axis ) . Determination of actin assembly rates in lamellipodia . FRAP experiments were performed using an inverted Axio Observer microscope equipped with an automated stage , a DG4 light source ( Sutter Instrument ) for epiﬂuorescence illumination , a VIS - LED for phase - contrast optics and a Coolsnap - HQ2 camera ( Photometrics ) driven by VisiView software ( Visitron Systems ) . EGFP - actin was bleached in selected regions within lamellipodia employing the 2D - VisiFRAP Realtime Scanner ( Visitron Systems ) using 40 – 50mW output power of a 405nm diode laser ( Visitron Systems ) . Movies were acquired at a rate of 3s per frame . Actin assembly rate is deﬁned as the sum of actin retrograde ﬂow and protrusion of the corresponding lamellipodial tip for a given time period . In case of FRAP experiments using EGFP - actin , actin assembly rate ( m mmin (cid:2) 1 ) equals the distance of ﬂuorescence recovered from the lamellipodium tip over time 25 . Measured values were averaged for n cells , analysed and displayed as box and whiskers plots ( Sigma plot 12 . 0 , Systat Software ) . ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 14 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14832 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14832 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications As alternative to FRAP and EGFP - actin overexpression , actin assembly rates were determined in lamellipodia of B16 cells expressing EGFP - lifeact , by simply measuring distances ( turquoise lines in Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 8C ) travelled by ﬂuorescence inhomogeneities ( open red circles in Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 8C ) within the actin meshwork over time . Random migration assays and lamellipodial persistence . For random migration assays , B16 or NIH 3T3 cells were seeded subconﬂuently into laminin - or ﬁbronectin - coated m - slide eight - well glass bottom microscopy chambers ( Ibidi GmbH , Martinsried , Germany ) , respectively . After 3h , regular medium was exchanged for microscopy medium ( see above ) and the chamber mounted onto an inverted Axio observer equipped with 37 (cid:2) C incubator and CO 2 atmosphere . Phase - contrast movies were acquired on different randomly chosen positions with a (cid:3) 10 / 0 . 15NA Plan Neoﬂuar objective and a frame rate of 4 frames per hour . For analysis , cells were manually tracked using ImageJ . DiPer software 67 was employed for determining mean square displacement of cells and their directionality . For some migration assays with NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , PVP ( Sigma ) at different concentrations was used to increase medium viscosity . PVP powder was added into prewarmed microscopy medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 – 4 % and sterile ﬁltered . Prewarmed PVP - containing microscopy medium was then used to replace regular medium immediately before start of movie acquisition . Lamellipodial persistence ( as in Supplementary Fig . 7 ) was determined using phase - contrast time - lapse microscopy of randomly migrating B16 cells , employing a (cid:3) 25 / 0 . 8NA Plan Neoﬂuar objective and a frame rate of 4 frames per minute . Lamellipodial persistence was expressed as time elapsed from initiation of the lamellipodium till its collapse . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements . Cells were plated onto laminin - coated coverslips previously attached to petri dishes ( Growth surface : 22 . 1cm 2 , TPP Techno Plastic Products AG , Trasadingen , Switzerland ) using silicone grease . Cantilevers ( Type : PP - CONT ( Pointprobe ) , NanoWorld , Neuchatel , Switzerland ) were furnished with polystyrene beads ( Radius : 6 m m , Polyscience Europe GmbH , Eppelheim , Germany ) at their tips to achieve a deﬁned contact shape . Beads were glued onto cantilever tips using M - Bond glue ( M - Bond 610 Adhesive , Vishay Precision Group , Inc . ) and a homemade microscope setup ( Olympus Deutschland GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) equipped with two inde - pendently movable x – y – z stages . After baking at 85 (cid:2) C overnight to ensure glue hardening , prepared cantilevers were mounted onto an inverted video microscope ( Leica DM IRB , Leica Microsystems GmbH , Wetzlar , Germany ) equipped with a commercial AFM scanning unit ( Nano Wizard , JPK Instruments AG , Berlin , Germany ) . For calibration 68 , the vertical spring constant of the cantilever k c was determined employing the thermal noise method , whereas the lateral spring constant k j was calculated as follows : k j ¼ 2 L 2 (cid:4) k c = 3 (cid:4) ð 1 þ m Þ ; with L and m denoting length and Poisson ratio of the cantilever , respectively ( m ¼ 0 . 25 ) . Before measurements , calibrated cantilevers were placed in front of migrating cells and approached to the substrate with a pre - set force of 1nN . Vertical and lateral voltage signals of cantilevers were recorded at a frequency of 100Hz during measurements . The precise time point of contact between cell and cantilever was extracted from gathered force measurements , supported by phase contrast video microscopy using a frame rate of 0 . 5Hz ( objective : Leica (cid:3) 40 , Ph2 , 0 . 55 NA ; camera DFK 31AF03 , The Image Source European GmbH , Bremen , Germany ) . The ﬁrst peak after contact between cell and cantilever was deﬁned as lamellipodial protrusion force and converted into force using respective calibration constants . Electron microscopy . For negative staining electron microscopy , cells were allowed to spread for 3 – 4h on 2 % Formvar - coated 200 mesh hexagonal gold grids ( Agar Scientiﬁc ) . After spreading , the samples were immediately ﬁxed and extracted with 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer ( 10mM MES buffer , 150mM NaCl , 5mM EGTA , 5mM glucose , 5mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 8 ) , then ﬁxed for 5min in 2 % glutaraldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer and kept in 2 % glutaraldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer at 4 (cid:2) C until sample inspection . For electron tomography , grids were stained with 70 m l 4 % sodium silicotungstate supplemented with 10nm BSA - saturated colloidal gold . Tilt series of negatively stained cytoskeletons were acquired on a FEI Tecnai T20 microscope , operated at 200kV . Automated acquisition of tilt series was driven by SerialEM version 3 . 4 with a typical tilt range from (cid:2) 60 (cid:2) to þ 60 (cid:2) using the Saxton tilt scheme based on 1 (cid:2) increments at a defocus value of (cid:2) 5 m m . Two tilt series around orthogonal axes were acquired for each tomogram and recorded on an Eagle 4k HS camera with a primary onscreen magniﬁcation of (cid:3) 25 , 000 . The resulting tilt series were processed using ﬁducials for alignment in IMOD software 69 . A custom - written Matlab - based software was used for automated ﬁlament tracking with threshold adjustment for nucleation sites as well as tracking steps according to a constant number of nucleation sites per lamellipodium area 70 . Four wild - type and six knock - out cells from three independent experiments were acquired and analysed using evenly spaced regions of 0 . 24 m m 2 surface area . Data processing and statistical analyses . Brightness and contrast levels were adjusted using MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices Corp . , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . Images were further processed for ﬁgure preparation using Adobe Photoshop CS4 . Final ﬁgures were assembled with Photoshop CS4 or CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X7 . Data analyses were carried out in ImageJ and MetaMorph , Excel 2010 ( Microsoft ) and Sigma plot 12 . 0 ( Systat Software ) . Data sets were compared using the non - parametric Mann – Whitney rank sum test ( Sigma plot 12 . 0 ) . A probability of error of 5 % ( p o 0 . 05 ; * in ﬁgure panels ) was considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance . * * and * * * indicated p values o 0 . 01 and o 0 . 001 , respectively .
