Vale Supplemental Experimental Procedures Constructs A truncated " cys - light " human ubiquitous kinesin gene , encoding 560 residues with all solvent - exposed cysteines replaced , was used as a template for mutagenesis ( Rice et al . , 1999 ) . Between the distal end of the neck linker ( L335 ) and proximal end of the neck - coiled coil ( T336 ) , 2 , 4 , 6 , 13 , 19 or 26 proline residues or 7 repeats of glycine - serine residues ( 14GS ) were inserted by PCR cloning . Each insert was flanked by two N - terminal lysines ( mimicking the position of similar lysines in the neck coiled coil that interact with negatively charged residues on the tubulin C - terminus ) and a C - terminal glycine ( a flexible joint prior to the start of the native neck coiled - coil ) . For optical trap studies , eGFP sequence was added to the C - terminus of each constructs for attachment to anti - GFP antibody coated beads . For the high - precision fluorescent tracking experiments involving dye or biotin labeling of the kinesin head , a unique reactive cysteine was introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis at the plus end tip ( position E215C ) . K560 - 19P , - 26P and - 14GS constructs with the E215C mutation did not express well in E . coli . However , after adding an eGFP to the C - terminal tail , the expression and solubility of the mutants was greatly improved , so that all studies with these constructs were performed as GFP fusion proteins . K560 ( E215C ) - WT , - 6P , and - 13P expressed without the need of GFP on the tail . To 2 further aid expression , 19P and 26P constructs were expressed in Rosetta competent cells ( Novagen ) that express rare tRNA genes in E . coli . Protein Expression and Purification Kinesin proteins were expressed and purified as described previously ( Tomishige and Vale , 2000 ) . The protein eluate from the nickel - nitriloacetic acid resin was dialyzed against 12 mM PIPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 100 µ M ATP for 4 hr at 4°C . The GFP - labeled protein concentration was determined by measuring eGFP absorbance at 488 nm . Fluorescent Labeling of the Motors For quantum dot tracking experiments , WT , 6P , 13P , 19P , 26P and 14GS E215C homodimers were reacted with biotin - maleimide ( EZ - link PEO 2 , Pierce Chemical Co . ) at a low stoichiometry of 0 . 5 biotins per head for 2 hr at 4 ºC . The reaction was quenched by adding 2 mM DTT and removed through microtubule affinity purification as described ( Tomishige and Vale , 2000 ) , except that an ATP concentration of 1 mM was used instead of 5 mM for the release of motors from microtubules . Quantum dot labeling of the biotinylated motors is explained below . Microscope A custom - built inverted microscope equipped for objective - type total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) was used . For quantum dot and GFP imaging , the sample was excited with the 488 nm line of an Argon - Ion laser ( Melles Griot ) and the fluorescence was passed through appropriate filters ( Semrock ) . The laser beam was aligned along the optical axis and expanded with a 5X beam expander . The expanded laser beam was passed through an achromatic doublet lens to minimize chromatic aberrations . The lens orientation was adjusted to send the beam through the specimen with a proper incident angle for total internal reflection . A dichroic mirror and an emission filter ( Semrock ) were used to reflect the 488 nm laser beam into the back aperture of the objective ( 100x / 1 . 49 NA , Plan - Apochromat , Zeiss ) and to collect the quantum dot fluorescence from 625 - 685 nm . Emitted photons were detected by a back - illuminated frame transfer 3 camera ( Cascade 512B , Roper Scientific ) . The camera had a pixel size of 13 µ m . The 100X magnification of the objective and usage of a 40 cm focal length apochromatic tube lens resulted in 106 nm effective pixel size . Motility Assays Sea urchin axonemes were immobilized on a glass surface as described previously ( Gibbons and Fronk , 1979 ) . 200 pM kinesin motor was then perfused into the chamber in BRB12 - casein buffer ( 12 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 1 mg / ml casein ) . The chamber was incubated for 2 min and then washed with the final imaging buffer ( BRB12 , 1 mg / ml casein , 2 mM DTT , 2 % glucose , 3 µ l " gloxy " ) ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) . For imaging quantum dot labeled motors , a solution containing 400 pM biotinylated kinesin was perfused into the chamber after axoneme immobilization . The slide chamber was than washed with BRB12 - casein buffer to remove unbound motors . A 400 nM solution of streptavidin - coated quantum dots emitting at 655 nm ( Invitrogen ) was introduced into the chamber in the absence of ATP and the sample was incubated for 5 min to allow streptavidin - biotin interaction . By pre - binding and immobilizing kinesin on the axoneme at low density , we sought to prevent multivalent attachment of kinesins to the quantum dots . The chamber was then washed thoroughly to remove unbound quantum dots . Finally , imaging buffer containing 140 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol was flown into to the chamber . Data Analysis Fluorescent particle movements were recorded with an integration time of 70 ms per image . The positional information was obtained by a two - dimensional Gaussian fitting algorithm implemented in IDL as described previously ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) . Step sizes were calculated from the displacement traces with a least - square fitting algorithm written in Matlab ( Kerssemakers et al . , 2006 ) . 4 Fluctuation analysis of dwell times has been previously employed to determine the number of rate limiting transitions between steps ( Schnitzer and Block , 1997 ) . For a Poissonian process with a single rate limiting transition , randomness ( r ) equals to 1 . If the dwell time between steps is constant , r drops to zero . r can be calculated from the measured dwell times ( τ ) between the individual steps by : 2 2 2 > < > < − > < = τ τ τ r . ( Eq . 1 ) For 16 nm head stepping of wild - type kinesin at limiting ATP concentrations ( 1 - 10 µM ) , two rate - limiting transitions ( r = 0 . 5 ) are expected , because each 16 nm step alternates with a 0 nm step ( labeled head stationary and the partner head is moving during this time period ) . Since ATP binding is rate limiting in this experiment , an individual head has two rate - limiting transitions per 16 nm movement . However , if the motor fails to produce a mechanical step upon ATP binding , then the randomness parameter can be higher ( but not above unity ) ( Schnitzer and Block , 1995 ) ( see SOM text for calculation ) . Microtubule Stimulated ATPase Assays Microtubules were prepared fresh each day of the assay . Unpolymerized tubulin ( 1 ml , 0 . 3 mg / ml ) was thawed and incubated for 15 min at 37°C for polymerization in the presence of 1 mM GTP and 20 µ M taxol . The tubulin solution was then spun through 40 % glycerol cushion at 80 , 000 rpm for 10 min . The microtubule pellet was rinsed with 1 ml BRB80 [ 80 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA ] and 20 µ M taxol . Microtubule concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 276 nm in 6 M guanidine - HCl , using an extinction coefficient of 115 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 . Microtubule - stimulated ATPase activity of kinesin constructs was measured in ATPase buffer [ 12 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM DTT , 80 mM KCl , 20 µ M taxol ] containing 2 mM ATP , coupled to an EnzCheck Phosphate Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) ( 300 µ M MESG , 1 U / ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase ) . The concentration of eGFP - labeled WT , 6P , 13P , 19P , 26P and 14GS constructs was detected 5 by measuring the eGFP absorbance at 488 nm , using the extinction coefficient of 65 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 . The motor concentration was diluted to 1 nM in the final assay buffer . The phosphate release rates were measured by monitoring the change in absorbance of MESG at 340 nm for 5 min . ATPase rates of 12 different microtubule concentrations ranging from 0 - 8 µ M for each construct were measured simultaneously in a 96 well quartz plate reader . A phosphate reference curve was obtained under the same assay conditions by adding phosphate concentrations ranging from 0 - 150 µM in the absence of the motor and microtubules . Michaelis - Menten constant K m ( MT ) and catalytic rate k cat were determined using a hyperbolic curve fitting routine implemented in Origin ( Hill coefficient was set to 1 ) . Optical Trapping Assays Optical trap measurements of GFP - tagged WT , 13P , 19P and 14GS constructs were carried out with a custom - built optical trapping microscope ( Gennerich et al . , 2007 ) . Carboxylated latex beads ( 0 . 92 µ m diameter ; Invitrogen ) were crosslinked to anti - GFP antibodies ( Tomishige et al . , 2002 ) and the GFP - tagged motors were incubated with the coated beads for 10 min . Cy3 - labeled sea urchin axonemes were added to the flow chamber ( to which they adhere tightly ) , and then the motor - bead mixture in assay buffer was perfused into the chamber . The assay solution consisted of 80 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM ATP , 1 mg / ml casein , 10 mM DTT . Labeled axonemes were visualized by a Hamamatsu SIT camera . A trapped bead was then positioned over a Cy3 - labeled axoneme that was aligned with the x - axis of the position detector . The bead displacement was detected by a quadrant photodiode and recorded at 2 kHz . Before data acquisition , each bead was moved along the x - axis within the detection region of the quadrant photodiode to obtain the detector’s response . The spring constant for each bead was calculated from the amplitude of its thermal diffusion . To minimize errors in stall force measurements , trap stiffness was set to 0 . 04 - 0 . 06 pN / nm for WT kinesin and to 0 . 025 - 0 . 035 pN / nm for the neck mutants , so that each construct stalled at an average bead - trap separation of 100 - 150 nm ( Block et al . , 2003 ) . Stall force measurements were carried out with a fixed position optical trap . Stall forces 6 were calculated by multiplying the trap stiffness by the mean maximum bead - trap separation reached and sustained for 100 ms . Kinesin stepping under constant loads was analyzed by using the force - feedback mode of the optical trap ( Gennerich et al . , 2007 ) . Velocities were obtained by line fits to the displacement traces of the beads moving under constant load . Measurements in the absence of ATP were carried out in a custom - built flow chamber that allows a buffer exchange while the chamber was tightly mounted to the microscope stage ( Gennerich et al . , 2007 ) . Kinesin motor stock solution ( ~ 5 µM motor ) containing 1 mM ATP was diluted 300 , 000 fold ( a concentration at which 30 % of the beads moved ) and mixed with the beads as described above . Longitudinal forward and backward forces in the absence of ATP were applied to the motor via the force - feedback controlled trap . Upon motor binding ( determined by the decrease in Brownian noise ) , the bead - microtubule complex was moved to the opposite edge of the detection area by controlling the stage position to allow the measurement of the bead movement under a constant force across the entire linear regime of the detection system . For each flow chamber , measurements were carried out on a single axoneme oriented along the x - axis of the detection area . After completing the measurements of bead movement without ATP , a motor - bead solution containing 1 mM ATP was flown into the chamber to determine the polarity of the axoneme via kinesin - driven bead movement . Supplemental Text Elastic Properties of Native Kinesin and Neck - Mutants Intramolecular strain between the two heads of WT kinesin and the extended kinesins can be estimated by the elastic properties of the linker regions . However , estimated strain cannot be certain since it is model dependent and side chain interactions are not taken into consideration in these calculations . Polyproline peptides form a left - handed type II trans helix with a pitch of 0 . 31 nm per residue ( Cowan et al . , 1955 ) . Earlier studies have shown that this helix is highly rigid with a persistence length ( l p ) of 22 nm ( Schimmel and Flory , 1967 ) . However , a more recent work has measured the distance between the two ends of a proline helix of different lengths using single molecule FRET ( Schuler et al . , 2005 ) , and showed that the helix is not completely rigid and chain bending plays an 7 important role in end - to - end distance as the chain grows longer than ~ 20 proline residues . Semi - rigid polymers can be modeled as a “worm like chain” ( WLC ) , which fits with the elastic properties of long segments of double stranded DNA ( Marko and Siggia , 1995 ) . The persistence length ( l p ) of polyproline helix is measured to be 4 . 4 nm ( Schuler et al . , 2005 ) . For a WLC segment , the mean square end - to - end distance can be formulated as : ⎥⎦⎤ ⎢⎣⎡ ⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎝⎛ − − = > < − lp lc c p c p e l l l l r 1 1 2 0 2 , Eq . 2 where l c is the fully extended length of the peptide ( 0 . 31 nm per residue for a PPII helix ) , referred as the contour length ( Howard , 2001 ) . The average distance between the two ends of 2 , 4 , 6 , 13 , 19 , 26 polyproline peptides are therefore expected to be 0 . 6 , 1 . 2 , 1 . 7 , 3 . 5 , 4 . 8 , 6 . 2 nm , respectively . In contrast to polyproline , poly ( Gly - Ser ) peptides and the native neck linker are highly disordered . Poly ( Gly - Ser ) peptides were shown to be highly flexible , with l p ~ 0 . 8 nm ( Sahoo et al . , 2006 ) . The native neck linker is a 15 a . a . peptide with estimated l p ~ 1 . 4 nm and l c = 5 . 7 nm ( Watanabe et al . , 2002 ) . The mean square end - to - end distance in solution for these highly flexible peptides is 2 0 2 nl r = > < , where n is the number of residues and l is the length per residue ( l = 0 . 38 nm for a flexible peptide chain ) ( Howard , 2001 ) . Therefore , the average length of the native neck linker and the 14GS peptide are equal to 1 . 45 nm and 1 . 41 nm , respectively . The overall end - to - end distance for the native neck linker attached to 14GS peptide therefore becomes 2 . 05 nm . Estimating the Inter - head Strain Stretching the two ends of a peptide requires a certain force that depends on the entropic elasticity of the peptide . The relation between force ( F ) and extension ( x ) for a WLC chain can be formulated as : 8 ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦⎤ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣⎡ + − ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ − = c c p B l x l x l T k x F 25 . 0 1 4 1 ) ( , Eq . 3 where k B is Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature ( ºK ) ( Bustamante et al . , 1994 ) . Kinesin movement requires certain structural constraints for the neck linkers . Since the average distance between the two adjacent tubulin binding sites is 8 nm , the neck linker needs to be stretched 4nm to allow the two heads to bind simultaneously to the microtubule . Hyeon and Onuchic ( 2007 ) had estimated large forces of interhead strain ( 10 - 15 pN ) by projecting ensemble crystal structures of kinesin onto microtubule . Our results suggest that such forces would lead to the detachment of the rear head and prevent kinesin from ever adopting a two - head bound intermediate . In the latter study , the persistence length of the neck linker has been estimated to be the size of a single amino acid residue ( 3 . 8 Å ) . However , in the WLC Model , the persistence length cannot be estimated by the size of a single amino acid of a polypeptide . Since the internal rigidity of the amino acid can be different from the peptide bond , such chains cannot be isotropic and continuously flexible , an essential property of a WLC . In worm - like chains , the polymer is a flexible slender rod which can bend and curve in arbitrary directions . Since the undocked neck linker does not form an α - helix or a β - sheet ( it has not been observed in crystal structures ) , it can be treated as a random coil . The persistence length of a random coil has been experimentally measured as 1 . 4 nm ( Watanabe et al . , 2002 ) , and the persistence length of a highly flexible peptide ( gly - ser repeat ) is 0 . 8 nm ( Sahoo et al . , 2006 ) . To estimate the interhead strain , we took into account the combined mean end - to - end distance of kinesin’s neck - linkers ( ~ 2 nm ) in the absence of tension and subtracted this value from the extension of the neck - linkers . We found that kinesin experiences a mechanical strain of ~ 3 . 9 pN on each head according to Eq . 3 by the given values of l c = 11 . 4 nm , l p = 1 . 4 nm , x = 6 nm ( 8 nm - 2 . 05 nm ) . The derivative of Eq . 3 gives the stiffness ( κ ) of the “entropic spring” , which is 1 . 3 pN / nm when the neck linker extends 4 nm . Similar values for the neck stiffness were obtained 9 both theoretically and experimentally . For example , unbinding force measurements ( Kawaguchi and Ishiwata , 2001 ) have found a stiffness of 1 pN / nm ( κ = 1 . 2 pN / nm is used herein ) . Rice et al . ( Rice et al . , 1999 ) have proposed that ATP binding to the front head causes neck linker docking which pulls the rear head forward . However , full docking of the neck linker in the forward head seems unlikely if the trailing head is still attached to the microtubule since the geometry of the kinesin - microtubule complex is incompatible with both neck linkers pointing forward . However , upon ATP binding to the forward head , partial docking of the proximal neck linker to the catalytic core might occur , which would decrease the length of the flexible peptide interconnecting both kinesin heads . Considering the fully extended size of the neck linker ( 5 . 7 nm ) , docking is unlikely to generate physical displacements of larger than 2 nm ( Block , 2007 ) . By using Eq . 3 , we can estimate the resulting intramolecular strain in the two - headed kinesin with the front neck linker docked ( x = 8 nm – 2 nm , l c = ( 2 X 5 . 7 ) - 2 nm ) , assuming that the chain length of the front neck linker is shortened by 2 nm . According to this calculation , the intramolecular strain between the two catalytic heads would increase to ~ 6 . 5 pN , which may provide sufficient force to drive the forward movement of the rear head in the ADP or no nucleotide state , but not in an ATP bound state , according to our pulling measurements . This is obviously an estimate and the actual distance might be shorter than 2 nm as it will depend upon the energetics of the binding interactions between the proximal neck linker with the catalytic core . However , our optical trapping experiments with 19P - NL show that forces of 6 pN are effective in inducing rear head dissociation to allow unidirectional stepping . It is also unclear at the present time whether the binding interactions between the relatively few residues in the proximal neck linker and the catalytic core alone are sufficiently strong to allow the generation and prolonged maintenance of such large ( 5 - 10 pN ) forces without breaking ( Block , 2007 ) . However , other interactions ( e . g . side chain interactions ) may contribute to interhead tension or stabilize the docking of the neck linker with the catalytic core . This remains an important structural question that requires further investigation . 10 Estimating the First Transition Time of Kinesin Mutants The lower forces generated by the mutant kinesin constructs with added elastic elements can be partially explained by Kramer transition time estimations for head diffusion against an energy barrier . Under unloaded conditions , the combined stiffness of the two neck linkers is ~ 0 . 6 pN / nm ( two serially attached Hookean springs with same spring constants ) . The energy barrier ( U 0 ) for the diffusion of the rear head against an elastic spring ( assuming the spring constant κ does not change ) is : 2 0 0 ) ( 21 x d U − = κ , Eq . 4 with d being the diffusion distance ( 8 nm ) , and x 0 ~ 0 nm is the equilibrium position of the rear head . The calculation yields an energy barrier of 4 . 7 k B T against which the head has to diffuse to reach the next binding site . The first passage time ( K τ ) is 4 . 4 µ s according to Equation 5 : T k U B K B e U T k 0 0 4 π κ γ τ = , Eq . 5 where γ is the viscous drag coefficient of 60 pNs / m for a globular head domain with a diameter of 6 nm ( Howard , 2001 ) . Under 6 . 5 pN backward load , only the forward head is under strain where κ = 1 . 2 pN / nm , x 0 = - 3 . 6 nm ( the backward load pulls the spring against the direction of diffusion ) . Under these conditions , the energy barrier can be as high as 19 k B T , and the first passage time is estimated to be 1 . 8 sec , which is long enough to be considered as motor stalling ( Rock et al . , 2005 ) . 11 The energy barrier and first - passage time are different for the neck mutants since the entropic elasticity of the linker has been changed . Kinesin linker with a longer contour length with a slightly lower persistence length becomes more load sensitive . For 14GS , κ of a single head is ~ 0 . 8 pN / nm derived from Eq . 3 . Under 2 . 4 pN of load , x 0 equals to - 3 . 2 nm and K τ = 4 ms . Under 4 pN , however , κ = 0 . 9 pN / nm , x 0 = - 4 . 6 nm and K τ = 522 ms . According to the Kramer’s theory , the head of the 14GS construct takes as long as K τ = 261 s to diffuse to the next binding site at 7 pN , the stall force of the WT . Kramer’s theory thus explains partially the lower stall forces of the extended kinesin mutants . For a more precise estimation of the stalling forces of the mutant constructs , one needs to take into account other factors such as electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding that can contribute to the energy barrier . Furthermore , the fractions of the forward and backward steps of the kinesin mutants might equilibrate at a lower load compared to WT kinesin ( indeed , the extended kinesin show 2 - 3 - fold more backwards steps under unloaded conditions ) . Conformational changes in the kinesin motor upon ATP hydrolysis ( Rice et al . , 1999 ) might also provide a strong bias for diffusion , leading to different parameters in the passage time . Calculation of the Randomness Parameter ( r ) for Motor Stepping with a Certain Probability ( p s ) To provide insight into the enzymatic cycles of the mutant kinesin constructs , dwell times between individual steps that could be clearly discerned in long processive runs were analyzed . Svoboda et al . ( Svoboda et al . , 1994 ) employed a fluctuation analysis of kinesin movement to determine the number of rate limiting steps under different conditions and defined a randomness parameter ( r ) , which is a measure of how the dwell times between two consecutive 8 nm steps are distributed . The randomness parameter can be calculated as follows : If an enzyme is limited by a single rate limiting transition every step , the average turnover time ( τ ) between adjacent enzymatic cycles can be described as τ = 1 / k , where k 12 is the rate of the limiting transition . For a multi step sequential process , turnover time would be ∑ = i i k / 1 0 τ . If the transition rate is the same for each reaction , the transition period for each step ( τ i ) equals to τ 0 / n , where n is the number of the rate limiting transitions . Randomness parameter can be calculated as ∑ = 20 2 τ τ i r ( Svoboda et al . , 1994 ) . For a single rate limiting step , r = 1 and for a two step sequential process r becomes 0 . 5 . An example for a two rate limiting step could be kinesin head stepping at low ATP concentrations , where ATP binding is the dominant rate limiting step and a head moves every other step of the two - headed motor ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) . If the enzyme takes a step with a probability p s < 1 ( which could be caused by an improper coupling between ATP hydrolysis and stepping ) , r can be calculated by ∑ − − = 2 2 1 ( 1 o i s p r τ τ ) ( Svoboda et al . , 1994 ) . Eq . 6 Specifically , for kinesin head movement ( n = 2 ) with p s = 0 . 2 ( Fig . S5 ) , r is expected to be as high as 0 . 9 . Supplemental References Block , S . M . ( 2007 ) .

Peptide insertions between the neck linker and neck coiled - coil region slightly reduced the processivity ( 20 - 45 % ) , yet the mutants were still able to take > 100 steps on average without dissociating from the microtubule . Runs shorter than 500 nm are not included in data analysis . 17 Figure S3 . Additional example traces of WT , 6P , 13P , 19P , 26P , and 14GS moving along axonemes ( distance between horizontal blue lines = 16 nm ) . To be able to detect > 95 % of steps taken by the motor head with 70 ms time resolution , different levels of limiting ATP concentrations ( 1 µM for WT , 15 µM for 6P and 13P , 25 µM for 19P , 40 µM for 26P , 100 µM for 14GS ) were used , so that each construct moved with a speed in the range of 10 - 15 nm / s . 18 Figure S4 . Step analysis of short proline insertion ( 0P , 2P and 4P ) constructs . The stepwise movements of quantum dot labeled kinesin constructs were tracked with 70 ms time resolution at 6 µ M ATP concentration . Left panel shows example traces of 0P ( black ) , 2P ( blue ) and 4P ( navy ) fitted with the step finding algorithm . A histogram of analyzed step sizes along the microtubule axis shows that 0P , 2P and 4P take 16 nm head steps , similar to WT kinesin . 19 Figure S5 . Extended kinesin mutants can take highly variable steps . The proline helix may form hinges between the neck linker and coiled - coil that may allow the motor head to take steps of multitudes of 8 nm , the distance between adjacent tubulin heterodimers along a single protofilament . Maximum step size can be defined as the fully stretched form of the two linker regions . For example , the 26P mutant has an 8 nm long proline insert and a 4 nm long native neck linker , which would allow a motor to take a step of up to 48 nm if the neck linkers are in a fully elongated form . A 24 nm head displacement might result from a starting point with the two heads separated by 8 nm , and then the rear head passing the front head and landing on the second ( instead of the first ) available binding site along the microtubule protofilament . The 8 nm steps seen in displacement traces ( Fig . 3 ) , however , might be caused by the binding of the rear head to a site adjacent to the front head ( green arrow ) on a neighboring protofilament . Alternatively , with two heads separated by 16 nm ( instead of 8 nm ) , the rear head can move 8 nm to the next available binding site and not pass the front head . It is not clear why wild type kinesin head does not prefer binding to available binding sites on either sides of the front head ( Fig . 3D ) and binds to the more distant tubulin on the same protofilament . One 20 explanation for this could be a “powerstroke” mechanism in which the released rear head is pulled forward through a conformational change of the neck linker in the front head , which changes its conformation from a backward to a forward pointing position via an ATP - dependent docking to the catalytic core . In this case , the rear head starts its diffusional search after it reaches a position in close proximity to next binding site in front of the bound head . 21 0 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 30 sideway - 48 - 40 - 32 - 24 - 16 - 8 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 0 10 20 30 p SW = 0 . 71 N step = 225 p SW = 0 . 48 N step = 361 diagonal sideway diagonal on axis on axis step size ( nm ) 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30 40 - 48 - 40 - 32 - 24 - 16 - 8 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 0 10 20 30 nu m be r o f s t ep s nu m be r o f s t ep s 14GS 26P step size ( nm ) Figure S6 . Analysis of 26P and 14GS motor domain step sizes in two dimensions . The majority ( 70 % ) of the sideway displacements occurred simultaneously with an on - axis displacement . Motors diagonal step size was calculated by 2 2 ( axis on sideway diagonal d d d − + = . The diagonal and on - axis step size histograms were similar . The lateral steps of 26P were significantly shorter ( 13 nm on average ) than on - axis steps ( 22 nm ) , suggesting that the motor is still biased to move forward , rather than freely diffusing around its tether . 22 Figure S7 . Dwell time histograms of WT and extended kinesin mutants ( 6P , 13P , 19P , 26P and 14GS ) were fit to a convolution of two exponentials ( solid red curves ) . The inserts show the cumulative probability functions ( red line ) and the cumulative curve of the measured dwell times ( blue line ) . The extended kinesins show a high fraction of longer dwells , which leads to a significant deviation between the theoretical and measured curve compared to the WT kinesin data . The longer dwell times most likely result from the deficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis and mechanical stepping leading to a temporary stall of the movement of extended kinesins . 23 Figure S8 . Stepping traces of WT ( blue ) and 14GS ( black ) at 1 µ M ATP concentration under 6 pN assisting load applied by the optical trap . Traces were fit by a step finding algorithm .

Stepping traces of WT kinesin ( black ) and 26P ( blue ) at 1 mM ATP under 9 pN assisting load applied by the force - feedback optical trap . Traces were fit by the step finding program ( red lines ) . 25 Figure S10 . WT and 14GS kinesin motors were subjected assisting load at low ATP concentrations ( 1 µ M ) . Under no load , 14GS mutant displayed no movement whereas WT kinesin moved 6 . 1 ± 1 . 1 nm / sec ( mean ± standard error of the mean ) . Under 3 and 6 pN loads , 14GS moved processively at a rate of 8 . 7 nm / sec and 19 . 4 nm / sec , respectively . Forward load also increased the speed of WT kinesin several fold . 26 Fig S11 . Evidence that higher forces than 6 pN are required to dissociate a microtubule bound kinesin rear head in the presence of 1 mM AMPPNP . A . Single kinesin motor attached to a large latex bead ( green sphere ) feels a plus end directed external force generated by the force - feedback controlled optical trap . The distance ( δ x ) between the trap center ( blue dotted line ) and bead center ( black dotted line ) is kept constant . B . Shortly after force - feedback activation ( shaded area ) , the bead - microtubule complex is repositioned and moved to the center of the detection system to allow the tracking of the bead position . Under 6 pN forward load , kinesin stalls ( see black curve in shaded area ) . Processive movement toward the microtubule plus end was not observed at 6 pN load .
