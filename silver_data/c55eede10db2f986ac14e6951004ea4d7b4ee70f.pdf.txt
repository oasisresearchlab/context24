The prognosis of metastatic and recurrent OS patients still remains unsatisfactory . Cisplatin reveals undeniable anti - tumor effect while induces severe side effects that threatening patients ’ health . Dynasore , a cell - permeable small molecule that inhibits dynamin activity , has been widely studied in endocytosis and phagocytosis . However , the anti - tumor effect of dynasore on OS has not yet been ascertained . In the present study , we suggested that dynasore inhibited cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and induced G0 / G1 arrest of OS cells . Besides , dynasore repressed tumorigenesis of OS in xenograft mouse model . In addition , we demonstrated that dynasore improved the anti - tumor effect of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo without inducing nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity . Mechanistically , dynasore repressed the expression of CCND1 , CDK4 , p - Rb , and MMP - 2 . Furthermore , we found that dynasore exerts anti - tumor effects in OS partially via inhibiting STAT3 signaling pathway but not ERK - MAPK , PI3K - Akt or SAPK / JNK pathways . P38 MAPK pathway served as a negative regulatory mechanism in dynasore induced anti - OS effects . Taken together , our study indicated that dynasore does suppress cell proliferation , migration , and invasion via STAT3 signaling pathway , and enhances the antitumor capacity of cisplatin in OS . Our results suggest that dynasore is a novel candidate drug to inhibit the tumor growth of OS and enhance the anti - tumor effects of cisplatin . Introduction Osteosarcoma ( OS ) remains the most common malig - nant bone tumor with a preference for the metaphysis of tubular long bones , especially in distal femur , proximal tibia and humerus , and most occurs in adolescents and teenagers . The incidence of OS is only 1 . 7 – 4 . 4 per mil - lion 1 , but with great invasive and metastatic capacity , the progression of OS squint towards disability and death , which causes substantial psychological and ﬁ nancial burdens . By following the treatments of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy , the 5 - year even - free survival rate reaches 60 – 70 % in patients with localized , non - metastasis OS 2 . However , most patients present metastasis , usually in lung , when ﬁ rst diagnosed , and encounter poor prognosis with 5 - year survival rate of 20 – 30 % even they adhere to standard therapy strategies 3 , 4 . Even worse , the diverse side - effects limit the choices and usages of anti - tumor drugs in OS chemotherapy . As one of the crucial drugs in OS chemotherapy , cisplatin exerts a potent anti - OS activity , but at the same time , causes apparent side effects including nephrotoxicity , hepatotoxicity , ototoxi - city , and myelosuppression 5 , 6 . Cisplatin induced nephro - toxicity is the most common side effect , which is © The Author ( s ) 2019 OpenAccess ThisarticleislicensedunderaCreativeCommonsAttribution4 . 0InternationalLicense , whichpermitsuse , sharing , adaptation , distributionandreproduction inanymediumorformat , aslongasyougiveappropriatecredittotheoriginalauthor ( s ) andthesource , providealinktotheCreativeCommonslicense , andindicateif changesweremade .

Higher cumulative dose and higher doses per treatment of cisplatin will result in greater kidney injury irreversibly 8 – 10 . Thus , it is necessary to establish novel effective drugs with no or less side effects for OS chemotherapy . Dynasore is a cell - permeable small molecule that non - competitively inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin , which is a protein essential for cell adhesion , invasion , endocytosis , and phagocytosis 11 . Since identi ﬁ ed by Macia in 2006 , dynasore was widely utilized in the studies of endocytosis and macropinocytosis 11 , 12 . Recently , litera - tures have found that dynasore plays protective role in spinal injury 13 , Alzheimer disease 14 , and heart ischemia / reperfusion injury 15 . In addition , dynasore suppresses the pseudopodia formation and cell invasion by destabilizing F - actin 16 , 17 . Moreover , in the latest study , dynasore exhibited anti - cancer potential via inhibiting cell pro - liferation and migration while induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in lung cancer cell 18 , 19 . How - ever , the anti - tumor effect of dynasore on OS has not yet been ascertained . In the present study , we demonstrated that dynasore inhibited cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and tumorigenesis of OS without inducing cell apoptosis . By combining cisplatin and dynasore , we found that dynasore enhanced the anti - OS effect of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , ERK - MAPK , PI3K - Akt , SAPK / JNK , p38 MAPK , and JAK2 - STAT3 pathways were assessed to identify the underlying mechanisms of the anti - proliferation effect of dynasore on OS . Materials and methods Cell lines and cell culture All the OS cell lines ( MNNG / HOS Cl # 5 , MG - 63 , and U2 - OS ) were purchased from CBTCCCAS ( Cell Cank , Type Culture Collection , Chinese Academy of Sciences ) ( Shanghai , China ) and identi ﬁ ed by STR analysis . All the three cell lines were cultured in DEM / F12 medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , and incubated in 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 incubator . Reagents Dynasore was purchased from Target molecule Corp . ( Targetmol , Shanghai , China ) and dissolved with dime - thylsulfoxide ( DMSO , Sigma , USA ) to a stock con - centration of 100 mM . Cisplatin was bought from the National Institute for Food and Drug Control of China and dissolved with 0 . 9 % normal saline solution ( NS ) . To explore the inhibitory effects of dynasore and cisplatin , the cell viability of OS cells were detected in a serial concentration gradient ( 0 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 μ M for dyna - sore , and 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 μ M for cisplatin ) for 24 h , 48 h , and 72 h . Unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed , the rest in vitro experiments were performed on four groups treated with 0 . 05 % DMSO ( control group ) , 50 μ M dynasore , 5 μ M cisplatin , or 50 μ M dynasore combined with 5 μ M cis - platin ( DC , combine group ) . To inhibit p38 MAPK sig - naling pathway , a speci ﬁ c inhibitor named SB239063 ( MCE , China ) was dissolved with DMSO and added 2 h before dynasore ( 50 μ M ) treatment for a ﬁ nal concentra - tion of 10 μ M . IL6 ( 50 ng / ml , PeproTech , USA ) was administrated 1 h before dynasore ( 50 μ M ) to activate JAK2 - STAT3 signaling . Cell proliferation assay The OS cell viabilities were detected by cell count kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 , Dojindo Molecular Technologies , Japan ) according to the instruction of the manufacture . In brief , 5 × 10 3 OS cells were inoculated and cultured in a 96 - well plate with 100 μ l culture medium . After treatment with different reagents , the culture medium were replaced with 100 μ l CCK - 8 detection solution ( 90 μ l fresh medium mixed with 10 μ l CCK - 8 solution ) . After incubation in cell incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) for 2 h , the absorbance were valued via a microplate reader at 450 nm ( Biotek , Winooski , VT , USA ) , and cell viability were calculated according to the instruction . To observe the proliferative cells intentionally , 5 - ethynyl - 20 - deoxyuridine ( EdU ) incorporation assay was implemented using Cell - Light TM EdU Apollo ® 567 in vitro imaging kit ( C10310 - 1 , RiboBio , Guangzhou , China ) according to the manufacture ’ s instruction . The EdU assays were performed by three independent experiments , and cell counting was imple - mented by two investigators independently using the ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , USA ) . Cloning formation assay After trypsinized into a single - cell suspension , OS cells ( 500 cells per well ) were seeded and cultivated in a 6 - well plate for 24 h . Then , the cells were treated with DMSO , dynasore , and cisplatin with / without dynasore for another 48 h . Culture medium was replaced into fresh DEM / F12 medium with 10 % FBS after drugs treatment , and the medium was changed every 2 days . After 10 days of cul - ture , the cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with 1 % crystal violet for 30 min . Clones were photographed by camera , and the clones with more than 50 cells were counted using microscope by two investigators . All the cloning formation assays were repeated three times . Wound healing assay 4 × 10 5 cells / well were inoculated into 6 - well plate and maintained in 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 incubator for 24 – 48 h until cells reached 100 % con ﬂ uence . Then the cell monolayer was scratched to create a gap with 200 μ l pipette tip fol - lowed by PBS washing . Finally , the culture medium was changed into serum free DEM / F12 medium to suppress Zhong et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 2 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association cell proliferation . The gaps were observed and photo - graphed at 0 h and 24 h after scratching , and the area of scratches were calculated by ImageJ software . Cell migration and invasion assays The MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 cells were treated with DMSO , dynasore , cisplatin , and dynasore combined with cisplatin for 48 h . Then cells were trypsinized and 4 – 8 × 10 4 cells in 200 μ l serum free DEM / F12 were sucked into upper chamber of transwell ( 8 μ m pore size , BD Bios - ciences , St Louis , USA ) with or without pre - coated Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , St Louis , USA ) to evaluate cell invasion and migration capacity , respectively . 600 μ l culture medium containing 20 % FBS was added into the lower chamber to stimulate cell travelling . After 36 h culture at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 incubator , transwell chambers were ﬁ xed using 4 % paraformaldehyde , and then stained with 1 % crystal violet . Cells laid on upper surface of transwell membrane were wiped using a cotton swab , while cells traveled to the lower surface of membrane were photographed under a microscope . The average transmitted cells were counted by two investigators in three random ﬁ elds ( 100× ) . Flow cytometric analysis After treated with DMSO , dynasore , cisplatin , and dynasore combined with cisplatin for 48 h , MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 were harvested to perform ﬂ ow cytometric analysis . For cell cycle distribution analysis , cells were washed by clod PBS and ﬁ xed with pre - cold 70 % ethanol overnight in 4 °C . Then the cells were stained using Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis Kit ( Beyotime Biotehnol - ogy , China ) . In brief , cells were incubated in 37 °C incu - bator with propidium iodide ( PI ) working solution for 30 min shielded from light . The cell cycle distribution was assessed via Flow Cytometry Caliber instrument ( BD Biosciences , USA ) . Cell apoptosis assessment was per - formed by PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I ( BD Biosciences , USA ) according to the instruction of the manufacture . After stained with 7 - Amino - Actinomycin ( 7 - AAD ) and PE Annexin V for 15 min at room tem - perature , the cell apoptosis was analyzed by Flow cyt - ometer . The 7 - AAD negative and PE Annexin V positive cells were considered as early apoptotic cells , while those with double positive were determined as in late apoptosis or dead . Western blot analysis The total cell protein was extracted by RIPA lysis buffer containing cocktail protease inhibitor and phosphorylase inhibitor ( Servicebio technology , China ) . Protein con - centrations were determined by using BCA protein assay kit ( Cwbiotech , China ) . Then , 20 μ g proteins were separated via 12 % SDS - PAGE and transferred into PVDF membrane ( 0 . 22 μ m , Millipore , Massachusetts , USA ) . After blocked by 0 . 5 % defatted milk , membranes were incubated with diluted speci ﬁ c primary antibody and HRP conjugated secondary antibody , successively . Primary antibodies used in the pre - sent study include anti - GAPDH ( 1 : 10000 , 10494 - 1 - AP , Proteintech ) , anti - human antibody CDK4 ( 1 : 1000 , ab108357 , Abcam ) , anti - human antibody CCND1 ( 1 : 1000 , ab40754 , Abcam ) , anti - human antibody p - Rb ( 1 : 500 , sc - 24585 , Santa Cruz ) , anti - N - cadherin ( 1 : 1000 , # 1311 , Cell Signaling Technology ) , anti - MMP - 2 ( 1 : 1000 , 10373 - 2 - AP , Proteintech ) , anti - MMP - 9 ( 1 : 1000 , 10375 - 2 - AP , Pro - teintech ) , anti - JAK2 ( phospho Y1007 + Y1008 ) ( 1 : 1000 , ab32101 , Abcam ) , anti - JAK2 ( 1 : 2000 , ab108596 , Abcam ) , anti - STAT3 ( phospho Y705 ) ( 1 : 1000 , ab76315 , Abcam ) , anti - STAT3 ( 1 : 1000 , ab68153 , Abcam ) , anti - p38 ( phospho T180 ) ( 1 : 1000 , ab178867 , Abcam ) , anti - p38 ( 1 : 1000 , ab170099 , Abcam ) , anti - Akt ( phosphor S473 ) ( 1 : 1000 , 66444 - 1 - Ig , Proteintech ) , anti - Akt ( 1 : 1000 , 10176 - 2 - AP , Proteintech ) , anti - ERK1 / 2 ( phospho T202 + T204 ) ( 1 : 1000 , ab214362 , Abcam ) , anti - ERK1 / 2 ( 1 : 5000 , ab184699 , Abcam ) , anti - SAPK / JNK ( 1 : 1000 , # 9252 , Cell Signaling Technology ) , anti - SAPK / JNK ( phosphor Thr183 / Tyr185 ) ( 1 : 1000 , 81E11 , Cell Signaling Technology ) . The secondary antibodies include HRP - conjugated af ﬁ nipure goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 5000 , SA00001 - 1 ) and anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 5000 , SA00001 - 2 ) both were purchased from Proteintech group , USA . The PVDF membranes were analyzed using ECL ( Enhanced Chemiluminescence ) Plus reagents and scanned with the BioSpectrum Imaging System ( UVP , German ) . RNA isolation and quantitative real - time PCR The total RNA of MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 was iso - lated using TRIzol ® Reagent ( Life Technologies , USA ) after treated with reagents described above . One μ g of total RNA was reverse - transcribed using ReverTra Ace ® qPCR RT kit ( TOYOBO , Japan ) according to the manu - facturer ’ s instructions . Quantitative real - time PCR was performed in the CFX Connect ™ Real - Time PCR Detec - tion System ( Bio - Rad , USA ) by using TB Green TM Premix Ex Taq TM ( TAKARA , Japan ) . The CT values were nor - malized to GAPDH expression , and mRNA expressions were calculated via 2 − ΔΔ Ct method as described in pre - vious research 20 . The primers used in present study are listed in Table 1 . In vivo assay The in vivo experiment of this study was accomplished with the approval of the ethical committee of Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , and followed the institutional guideline and ethical standard . To establish subcutaneous transplanted model of OS , 3 × 10 6 MNNG / HOS cells were injected into the right axilla of each 5 - week - old male nude mouse Zhong et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 3 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association ( BALB / c - nu , Beijing HFK Bioscience , China ) . The xeno - grafts were measured by micrometer caliper , and the tumor volume was calculated based on length ( a ) and the width ( b ) by the following formula : tumor volume = ab 2 . When xenografts volume reached 80 – 100 mm 3 , nude mice were divided into four groups randomly and received the following interventions every day : ( 1 ) in control group , mice were peritumoral subcutaneously and intraperitoneally injected with 100 μ l NS respectively ; ( 2 ) in Dynasore group , 100 μ l NS with or without dynasore ( 10 mg / kg ) were peritumoral subcutaneous and intraper - itoneal injected , respectively ; ( 3 ) in Cisplatin group , 100 μ l NS without or with cisplatin ( 2 mg / kg ) were peritumoral subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injected , respectively ; ( 4 ) in combination group ( DC ) , 100 μ l NS containing dynasore ( 10 mg / kg ) and 100 μ l NS supplemented with cisplatin ( 2 mg / kg ) were injected peritumoral sub - cutaneously and intraperitoneally , respectively . To explore the role of p38 MAPK pathway in dynasore induced anti - proliferation effect of OS in vivo , another xenograft mouse model was performed as described above , and the cisplatin ( 2 mg / kg ) treatment was replaced with 10 mg / kg SB239063 21 ( intraperitoneal injection ) . All the mice were sacri ﬁ ced after intervened for one week , and xenografts , livers and kidneys were resected carefully and ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for H & E staining and immunohistochemistry assay . Histopathology and immunohistochemistry The samples were embedded in paraf ﬁ n and sectioned to 4 μ m thickness . The sample sections ( tumors , livers , and kidneys ) were dewaxed and stained with Hema - toxylin and Eosin Staining Kit ( Beyotime Biotechnology , China ) according to the manufacture ’ s instruction . Additionally , to explore the protein expression in OS xenografts , the tumor sections were used to perform immunohistochemistry with Ki67 ( 1 : 200 , ab16667 , Abcam ) , STAT3 ( 1 : 100 , ab68153 , Abcam ) or p - STAT3 ( 1 : 100 , ab76315 , Abcam ) primary antibodies and a biotin - conjugated af ﬁ nipure goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 500 , SA00004 - 2 , Proteintech ) . For negative controls , immu - nohistochemistry was carried out in the absence of primary antibodies . Immuno ﬂ uorescence assay 2 – 4 × 10 4 / well MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 cells were seeded on circle cover glass ( φ = 20 mm ) in 12 - well plate , and treated with 0 . 05 % DMSO or 50 μ M dynasore for 48 h . Cells were then ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min , and permeabilized with 1 % triton X - 100 for 20 min . After 1 h blocking in PBS containing with 10 % FBS , cells were incubated in STAT3 ( 1 : 500 , ab68153 , Abcam ) or p - STAT3 ( 1 : 500 , ab76315 , Abcam ) primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight . Then , the cells were washed with PBST for three times ( 5 min each time ) , and incu - bated with Dylight 488 goat anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibodies ( 1 : 500 , Abbkine , USA ) for 2 h at room tem - perature . Cell nucleus was stained via Hoechst 33342 ( Beyotime Biotechnology , China ) for 5 min at room temperature . Statistical analysis Results of the present study were expressed as mean ± SEM for at least three independent experiments and analyzed by using SPSS 21 . 0 software ( IBM , Chicago , IL , USA ) and GraphPad Prism 6 . Two - tailed student ’ s t - test was used to examine signi ﬁ cant difference between any two groups , while one - way ANOVA was performed to assess the statistical signi ﬁ cance between three or more groups . P < 0 . 05 was considered as statistically signi ﬁ cant . Results Dynasore inhibits cell proliferation of OS in vitro Human OS cell lines ( MNNG / HOS , MG - 63 , and U2 - OS ) were treated with increasing concentrations of dynasore or cisplatin , and then the cell viability was assessed by CCK - 8 kit at 24 , 48 , and 72 h . As shown in Fig . 1a , b , the cell abilities of MNNG / HOS , MG - 63 , and U2 - OS were suppressed in a time - and concentration - dependent manner either treated with dynasore or cisplatin . To evaluate the synergistic antitumor effect of dynasore and cisplatin , cells were exposed to dynasore ( 50 μ M ) or / and cisplatin ( 5 μ M ) for 48 h . As expected , cell viabilities were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in dynasore group and cisplatin group , while those in dynasore and cisplatin combination group ( DC group ) were further suppressed ( Fig . 1c ) . Besides , the CDIs ( Coef ﬁ cients of Drug Inter - action ) of 50 μ M dynasore and 5 μ M cisplatin in MNNG / HOS , MG - 63 , and U2 - OS cells were reached up to 0 . 80 ± 0 . 03 , 0 . 58 ± 0 . 05 , and 0 . 54 ± 0 . 05 , which means dynasore promoted the antitumor capacity of cisplatin . Then , the effects of dynasore and cisplatin alone or in combination were analyzed via observing cell morphology . Unlike apoptosis - inducing feature of cisplatin , dynasore exhib - ited a signi ﬁ cant inhibitory effect on cell density . In DC group , both anti - proliferation and apoptosis - inducing effects were observed ( Supplemental Figs . 1 – 3 ) .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 4 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association To further estimate the anti - proliferation effect of dynasore on OS cells , EdU staining was performed in MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 cells . As depicted in Fig . 2a – d , both dynasore and cisplatin treatment sig - ni ﬁ cantly decreased the EdU positive rate in OS cells ( 17 . 80 ± 1 . 56 % in dynasore group and 3 . 46 ± 0 . 45 % in cisplatin group vs . 50 . 51 ± 1 . 42 % in control group in MNNG / HOS , p < 0 . 01 ; 19 . 27 ± 0 . 95 % in dynasore group and 6 . 75 ± 1 . 14 % in cisplatin group vs . 33 . 37 ± 0 . 85 % in control group in MG - 63 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Consistent with our previous results , the EdU positive rate of dynasore and cisplatin combination group ( MNNG / HOS : 0 . 77 ± 0 . 08 % , p < 0 . 01 ; MG - 63 : 1 . 59 ± 0 . 14 % , p < 0 . 01 ) were signi ﬁ cantly lower than cisplatin group . In addition , cloning formation assay demonstrated similar results ( Fig . 2e , f ) . However , with the shadow of the powerful anti - colony formation effect of cisplatin in MG - 63 , dynasore decreased the relative colony formation rate with no statistical evidence ( 0 ± 0 % vs . 1 ± 0 . 71 % , p = 0 . 158 ) . Thus , these results indicated that dynasore signi ﬁ cantly suppressed viability , proliferation , and colony formation of OS cells , and has synergy effect with cisplatin . Dynasore induces G0 / G1 arrest but not cell apoptosis of OS cells The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 were evaluated using ﬂ ow cytometry after treatment with dynasore and cisplatin alone or in combination . As revealed in Fig . 3a , b , dynasore exposures led to accumulation in G0 / G1 phase both in MNNG / HOS ( 56 . 04 ± 1 . 08 % vs . 42 . 36 ± 0 . 25 % , p < 0 . 01 ) and MG - 63 cells ( 70 . 30 ± 0 . 50 % vs . 60 . 74 ± 0 . 11 % , p < 0 . 01 ) , while cisplatin accumulated cells in S phase ( 93 . 62 ± 0 . 38 % vs . 39 . 50 ± 0 . 44 % in MNNG / HOS ; 84 . 71 ± 2 . 60 % vs . 26 . 63 ± 1 . 67 % in MG - 63 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Surprisingly , compared with cisplatin group , dynasore combined with cisplatin sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased the population of OS cells in G0 / G1 phase ( 20 . 39 ± 0 . 21 % vs . 4 . 09 ± 0 . 05 % in MNNG / HOS and 9 . 87 ± 1 . 27 % vs . 1 . 52 ± 1 . 92 % in MG - 63 ) .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 5 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association elucidate the mechanisms , the transcription and expres - sion of proteins essential for cell cycle G1 / S transition were analyzed via real - time PCR and western blot , respectively . As shown in Fig . 3c – f , dynasore down - regulated both mRNA and protein levels of CCND1 and CDK4 . Moreover , the phosphorylation of Rb , a protein that sequesters E2F to suppress transcription activation , was signi ﬁ cantly inhibited by dynasore in both MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 cells . Compared with cisplatin treat - ment , the expression of p - Rb , CCND1 , and CDK4 were also down - regulated when dynasore was added . Furthermore , cell apoptosis was detected in MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 ( Fig . 3g , h ) . Astonishingly , although dynasore treatment for 48 h mildly increased apoptosis of OS cells , statistically signi ﬁ cant differences were found neither between dynasore group and control group ( p = 0 . 390 and p = 0 . 116 ) nor between DC group and cisplatin group ( p = 0 . 386 and p = 0 . 121 ) . Therefore , these results suggests that dynasore induces G0 / G1 arrest through inhibiting the expression of p - Rb , CCND1 , and CDK4 , while not affects apoptosis of OS cells in vitro . Dynasore suppresses OS cell migration and invasion The capacity of migration and invasion play a crucial role in OS distant metastasis and local invasion . As shown in Fig . 4a – d , the wound healing assay revealed that dynasore signi ﬁ cantly delayed the lessening of the scratch area in both OS cells , and migration rates were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in DC group when compared with cisplatin group . Consistent with wound healing assay , the transwell migration ( Fig . 4e – g ) and invasion assays ( Fig . 4h – j ) exerted the same pattern of effects of dynasore and cisplatin , indicating that dynasore exposure inhibited cell migration and invasion capacity and enhanced the inhibitory effect of cisplatin in OS cells . Fur - thermore , we examined cell migration an invasion relevant proteins ( N - cadherin , MMP - 2 , and MMP - 9 ) after treatment with dynasore and cisplatin alone or in combination . As exhibited in Fig . 4k – m , both dynasore and cisplatin alone suppressed the expression of MMP - 2 signi ﬁ cantly in MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 cells , and the effects are more prominent in combination group . However , dynasore com - bined with cisplatin decreased N - cadherin expression when compared with cisplatin in both cells , while no effects on N - cadherin were observed when dynasore was used alone .

The administration of dynasore resulted in signi ﬁ cantly decreased in tumor volume ( Fig . 5a – c , p < 0 . 05 ) . Fur - thermore , DC group gained the greatest suppression effect in OS growth ( Fig . 5a – c , p < 0 . 05 ) , while the mean tumor volume in cisplatin group were in between Fig . 3 Dynasore induces G0 / G1 cell cycle arrest but not cell apoptosis of OS cells . a The representative data of PI staining and folw cytometric analysis of OS cells treated with dynasore and / or cisplatin . b Histograms of cell cycle distribution of MNNG / HOS ( left ) and MG - 63 ( right ) show that dynasore signi ﬁ cantly increases the percentages of cells in G0 / G1 phase . c The relative mRNA expression of CDK4 and CCND1 in OS cells . d Representative western blot analysis for p - Rb , CDK4 , and CCND1 in OS cells .

As revealed in in vitro assays , dynasore highlights an anti - proliferation effect when treated alone or combined with cisplatin in OS cells . Therefore , the expressions of Ki67 were detected in xenografts by using IHC ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Dynasore and cis - platin alone both signi ﬁ cantly reduced Ki67 expression in vivo . In addition , the average Ki67 positive rate was further decreased when dynasore and cisplatin were administrated together . As shown in Fig . 5f , the OS cell densities in xenografts were much lower when treated with dynasore , while cisplatin alone caused mainly cell death and fatty degeneration . Besides , tumors in DC group had features of dynasore and cisplatin groups , and achieved a better effect of growth suppression in vivo . Furthermore , the histomorphology of liver and kidneys of xenografts mice was analysis by H & E staining ( Fig . 5g ) . Surprisingly , no obvious evidences showed that dynasore induced nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity in the present study . However , in cisplatin treated mice , edematous glomeruli and swollen and degenerated renal tubular epithelial cells were observed . Taken together , dynasore exerted anti - tumorigenesis effect mainly by inducing proliferation repression on OS without causing or nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity . P38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in dynasore induced anti - osteosarcoma effects Next , western blot was conducted to further explore the signaling pathways involved in dynasore induced anti - proliferation effect . Dynasore signi ﬁ cantly increased the phosphorylation levels of p38 ( Fig . 6a – c ) . Moreover , as expected , p - p38 level was up - regulated in DC group compared with cisplatin group . These results indicated that p38 MAPK signaling pathway was involved in dynasore induce anti - osteosarcoma effects . However , when SB239063 , a speci ﬁ c inhibitor of p38 MAPK , was Fig . 5 Effects of dynasore and cisplatin in OS xenograft mouse model . a , b The representative mice and tumors of the xenograft mouse modes in DMSO , dynasore ( 10 mg / kg ) , cisplatin ( 2 mg / kg ) and combination - treated groups . c Tumor volumes were measured every day since day 3 after model establishment ( day 0 ) , and drugs administration were initiated at day 4 ( red arrow ) . d , e Xenograft tumor tissues were subjected to IHC staining by using Ki67 antibody ( Scare bar : 40 μ m ) .

The cell ability suppression capacities of dynasore in MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 were more prominent after pre - treated with SB239063 ( Fig . 6d ) . EdU staining and colony for - mation assay demonstrated the same pattern of effects of dynasore when SB239063 was used ( Fig . 6e – k ) .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 10 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association However , the tumor volumes in the group treated with dynasore and SB239063 were signi ﬁ cantly smaller than those in dynasore group ( Fig . 7a , b ) . By H & E staining , we found that the cell density in xenografts of SB239063 and dynasore combination group ( SBD group ) was much sparser than that in dynasore group ( Fig . 7c ) . In addition , the average ki67 positive rate in SBD group was sig - ni ﬁ cantly lower than that in dynasore group ( 44 . 62 ± 2 . 73 % vs . 58 . 23 ± 3 . 33 % , p < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7d , e ) . Taken toge - ther , p38 MAPK pathway might serves as a negative regulator in dynasore induced proliferation inhibition . However , the phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , Akt and JNK did not have signi ﬁ cant differences between control and dynasore treated group ( Supplemental Fig . 4 ) , indicating that MAPK ERK1 / 2 , PI3K - Akt , and SAPK / JNK pathways might not involve in repression of OS proliferation induced by dynasore . Dynasore inhibits cell proliferation via STAT3 pathway In the previous results , we found p38 MAPK , which acted as a negative regulator , was involved in the effects of dynasore on OS . Here , we further studied the role of JAK2 / SAT3 pathway in dynasore - induced inhibition of OS proliferation . The phosphorylations of JAK2 were signi ﬁ cantly suppressed by dynasore in both MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 cells ( Fig . 8a – c ) . Surprisingly , the expression of STAT3 and p - STAT3 were both signi ﬁ cantly down - regulated in dynasore group , and the p - STAT3 levels were indeed repressed by dynasore when standardized to total STAT3 expression ( Fig . 8a – c ) . Moreover , the expressions of these proteins were reduced in DC group when com - pared with cisplatin group . Furthermore , by using real - time PCR , no signi ﬁ cant difference of mRNA expression of STAT3 was found in dynasore group and control group . However , up - regulated STAT3 transcription levels , which was reversed by dynasore in DC group , was detected after cisplatin intervention ( Fig . 8d ) . Consistent with in vitro detection , the p - STAT3 and STAT3 expression were decreased in xenografts OS tumors exposed to dynasore ( Fig . 8e ) . To intuitively observe the effects of dynasore on subcellar location of STAT3 and p - STAT3 , immuno ﬂ uorescence experiments were per - formed . As exhibited in Fig . 8f , g , the ﬂ uorescence intensities of STAT3 and p - STAT3 were decreased both in nucleus and cytoplasm in dynasore treated group . In order to investigate the relationship between cell cycle arrest and JAK2 / STAT3 pathway repression , the expres - sions of CCDN1 , CDK4 and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 were evaluated at 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 h after dyna - sore treatment . As expected ( Fig . 9a ) , the CCND1 , CDK4 , p - JAK2 , and p - STAT3 levels started decreasing at 24 h and were dramatically reduced at 48 h , simultaneously . Furthermore , after activated by in ﬂ ammatory cytokine Interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) , a cytokine that was identi ﬁ ed as a well - established STAT3 signaling pathway activator 22 , the effects of dynasore on cell viability and proliferation of OS cells were determined by CCK - 8 assay and EdU staining .

Discussion The prognosis of patients with OS has been improved with the implementation of chemotherapy in the 1970s 2 .

DMSO group Zhong et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 12 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association However , despite the unremitting efforts of researchers in the last four decades , the survival rate still remains unsatisfactory , especially in patients with systemic metastasis or local relapse 2 , 23 – 25 . Drugs that widely used in OS chemotherapy generally develop side effects and cause injuries in normal tissues of cancer patients . Worse still , about 35 – 45 % patients turn out to be unresponsive or resistant to these drugs , which leads to treatment failure 2 , 26 . In the present study , we demonstrated the anti - OS potential of dynasore for the ﬁ rst time in vitro and in vivo model . By combining dynasore and cisplatin , we found that dynasore enhanced the anti - tumor effect of cisplatin . Cell cycle is a sequence of highly regulated events that allows a cell to grow , duplicate its genetic material , and divide into two daughter cells 27 . The homeostasis of the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms is deranged in cancer cells , and consequently , leading to unscheduled malignant proliferation , which is considered as one of the proverbial features of malignancies 28 . In G0 / G1 phase , the activity of E2F , which is critical in gene transcription , was repressed by hypophosphorylated pRb . Once triggered by G1 - S cell cycle transitive signaling , the increasingly synthesized CCND binds to cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDK4 or CDK6 ) . Then , the CCND - CDK4 / 6 complexes phosphor - ylate pRb to release the pRb from E2F - DP complexes and initiate the activation of transcription 27 , 29 , 30 . We found that dynasore suppressed cell proliferation and induced G0 / G1 phase arrest of OS cell lines . Furthermore , dyna - sore reduced the expression of pRb , CCND1 , and CDK4 . These results indicate that dynasore somehow inhibited CCND1 and CDK4 expression so that CCND1 - CDK4 complexes decreased , which leads to hypopho - sphorylation of pRb and block G1 - S transition . Since identi ﬁ ed , dynasore was widely used in the researches of endocytosis and macropinocytosis as a dynamin inhi - bitor 11 , 12 , 31 – 33 . In the latest reports , dynasore was found to be able to repress cell proliferation , migration of lung cancer cell lines in vitro 18 , 19 , and , consist with our results , dynasore augmented the anti - cancer effects of cisplatin 18 . Fig . 9 Dynasore exert anti - OS effects partially by STAT3 signaling pathway . a The expression of CCND1 , CDK4 , p - JAK2 , JAK2 , p - STAT3 , and STAT3 were detected by western blot after treated with dynasore for 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h . b The cell viability of OS cells after treated with IL - 6 ( 50 ng / ml ) followed by dynasore exposure .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 13 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association In the present study , no suf ﬁ cient evidences were found in dynasore induced apoptosis of OS cells . However , dyna - sore induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in lung cancer cells . Moreover , dynasore induced S phase cell cycle arrest in HCC827 and H1650 cells , while did not affect the cell cycle distribution of A549 cells 19 . These differences indicate the diverse roles of dynasore in dif - ferent cancer cells . Abnormally elevated cell migration and invasion gives OS cells the intensive ability of systemic metastasis and locally aggression , which is responsible for poor prognosis and death 2 . N - cadherin is a transmembrane protein which mediates intercellular adhesion and involves in transen - dothelial migration . In Epithelial – Mesenchymal Transi - tion ( EMT ) process , the expression of N - cadherin is increased and balanced by E - cadherin down - regulation . The transitioned cells acquire the af ﬁ nity to mesenchymal cells and enhance the expression of proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , and , ﬁ nally facilitate the capacity of migration and invasion 34 , 35 . The MMPs are a family of zinc - containing endopeptidases which are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein , and play important roles in physiological and pathological processes 36 , 37 . Among these MMPs , MMP - 2 , and MMP - 9 were con ﬁ rmed to be crucial in cancer metastasis and aggression for their ability of remodeling basement membrane via degrading Type IV collagen 38 , 39 . Chung et al . showed that elevated MMP - 2 activity stimulated by TGF - β 1 was partially impaired when pretreated with dynasore 40 . Wang et al found dynasore inhibited the migration of lung cancer cells and down - regulated active MMP - 9 level 19 . Consistently , our results showed that dynasore treatment resulted in sup - pressed cell migration and invasion , and reduced MMP - 2 protein level of OS cells . However , western blot found no evidences of dynasore mediated MMP - 9 or N - cadherin down - regulation . Therefore , dynasore inhibited the migration and invasion of OS mainly through down - regulation of MMP - 2 , but not MMP - 9 or N - cadherin . STAT3 is a member of STATs ( Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcriptions ) family and acts as signal messagers and transcription factors . After activated by cytokines or growth factors , STAT3s are phosphorylated to form STAT3 dimer and travels from plasma membrane to nucleus , and then initiates the transcription of down - stream target genes such as CCND1 , CCNB , cdc2 , sur - viving , Bcl - 2 , Mcl - 1 , MMP - 1 , and MMP - 2 41 – 44 . In cancer cells , constitutive activation of STAT3 breaks the strict control mechanism of downstream gene transcription and involves in tumor growth , survival , invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis 45 , 46 . Literatures have shown that over - expression and aberrant activation of STAT3 contributes to the tumorigenesis , progression , and poor prognosis of several cancers including OS 47 – 50 . Besides , growing concentrations have focused on novel drugs investigation by treating STAT3 as a therapy target 51 – 53 . Our study showed that dynasore treatment inhibited cell prolifera - tion , migration , invasion and tumorigenesis of OS , decreased the expression of p - STAT3 in vitro and in xenograft mouse model . At the meantime , total STAT3 protein expression was found suppressed by dynasore in vitro and in vivo . By using real - time PCR , we found that the mRNA expression of STAT3 in MNNG / HOS and MG - 63 was not affected by dynasore , which indicating that the protein expression of STAT3 was inhibited at post - transcriptional level . The post - transcriptional mod - i ﬁ cation of STAT3 includes tyrosine phosphorylation , serine phosphorylation , acetylation , methylation , and oxidation 54 . STAT3 deacetylation can be activated by NAD - dependent silent information regulator protein ( SIRT ) 1 , and results STAT3 destabilization and degra - dation 54 – 56 . By treating with dynasore , the endocytosis of cells is repressed , which might block the cellular nutrients transportation and , consequently , activate regulator pro - teins like SIRT1 to initiate STAT3 deacetylation . Litera - tures showed that most STAT3 inhibitors 53 , 57 , 58 functioned by repressing the activation of STAT3 . Our study indicated that dynasore served as a STAT3 pathway inhibitor in OS , which supplement the list of inhibi - tors 59 , 60 suppressing both expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 . In addition , the phosphorylation of JAK2 , which can activate STAT family , and downstream target genes ( CCND1 , MMP - 2 ) of STAT3 , was also down - regulated in dynasore exposed group . IL - 6 is the most well known activator of STAT3 pathway 61 , 62 . In this study , we activated the STAT3 pathway by using IL - 6 and found that the anti - proliferation effect of dynasore on OS cells was dramatically attenuated ( both in CCK - 8 assay and EdU staining assay ) . These evidences suggest that dyna - sore exerts anti - tumor effect , or at least anti - proliferation effect , in OS via STAT3 signaling pathway . Previous studies have indicated that p38 MAPK , MAPK - ERK , PI3K - Akt , and SAPK / JNK signaling path - ways are involved in cell proliferation 20 , 63 – 66 . In our study , we found that dynasore did not affect the expression and activation of ERK1 / 2 , Akt or SAPK / JNK , indicating that MAPK - ERK and PI3K - Akt and SAPK / JNK signaling pathways might not involve in dynasore induced anti - OS effect . The role of p38 MAPK pathway in proliferation was ambiguous 66 . Most studies suggested that p38 acti - vation promoted cell proliferation 64 , 67 , 68 , while another reports showed opposite results 65 . Here , we demonstrated that the phosphorylation level of p38 was elevated in dynasore treated OS cells . Interestingly , by using SB239063 , a p38 - speci ﬁ c inhibitor , the anti - proliferation effect of dynasore was enhanced . Collectively , we hypo - thesize that when dynasore signi ﬁ cantly inhibited cell proliferation , p38 MAPK pathway was activated as a Zhong et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 687 Page 14 of 16 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association negative regulatory mechanism to lessen the anti - tumor effect of dynasore on OS cells . Therefore , if possible , p38 MAPK inhibitor should be used as an adjuvant of dyna - sore in the treatment of OS in the future . In summary , to our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst research that studies the anti - tumor effect of dynasore on OS . Based on our ﬁ nding , we exhibited that dynasore pos - sessed anti - OS ability in vitro and in vivo . Besides , dynasore signi ﬁ cantly enhanced the anti - tumor effects of cisplatin without inducing nephrotoxicity and hepato - toxicity . Mechanistically , we found that dynasore exerted anti - tumor effects , or at least anti - proliferation effect , in OS via STAT3 signaling pathway . Collectively , our study reveals the anti - tumor effects of dynasore on OS , which may supplement the candidate chemotherapy drug list , and reduce cisplatin - mediated side effects by decreasing dosage via drug combination .
