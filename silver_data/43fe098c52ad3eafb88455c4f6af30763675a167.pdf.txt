BMC Public Health The development and evaluation of the worker - occupation fit inventory Keyao Lv 1† , Ruican Sun 2† , Xiaofang Chen 3 and Yajia Lan 3 * Abstract Background Person - environment fit ( PEF ) theory , one of the foundational theories of occupational stress , has primarily found applications in organizational behavior and human resource management . Given the alignment between the definition of occupational stress and the essence of PEF , we introduced the concept of worker - occu - pation fit ( WOF ) . To validate our theoretical model , the development of an instrument to measure WOF becomes imperative . Methods The Worker - Occupation Fit Inventory ( WOFI ) comprises three dimensions : personal trait fit ( PTF ) , need - supply fit ( NSF ) and demand - ability fit ( DAF ) . Job - related mental disorders ( JRMDs ) were assessed using the DASS - 21 . During the pre - investigation , items of the WOFI underwent screening through classic test theory ( CTT ) analysis . In the formal investigation , item response theory ( IRT ) analysis was employed to evaluate the selected items . The relation - ship between WOF and JRMD was verified by Pearson’s correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis . Results The initial version consisted of 26 items . Three common factors were extracted by exploratory factor analysis ( EFA ) : 6 items were included in the PTF , 6 items were included in the NSF , 4 items were included in the DAF , and 10 items were deleted because of unacceptable factor loadings . The confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) veri - fied the structure of the WOFI with χ 2 / df = 1 . 822 , CFI = 0 . 947 , and SRMSR = 0 . 056 . The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of the PTF , NSF , and DAF were 0 . 91 , 0 . 92 , and 0 . 80 , respectively . In IRT analysis , the discrimination values of all items ranged from 1 . 25 to 2 . 53 , and the difficulty values of all items ranged from - 6 . 28 to 1 . 30 ( with no difficulty of reversal ) . The WOF was negatively related to job - related stress ( r = - 0 . 34 , p < 0 . 001 ) , anxiety ( r = - 0 . 37 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and depression ( r = - 0 . 41 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that a high level of WOF was a protective factor against job - related mental disorders , with OR s all less than 1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and a low level of WOF was a risk factor for job - related mental disorders , with OR s all more than 1 . 0 ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Conclusions The results of CTT and IRT analysis indicated that the WOFI exhibits reliability and validation . The WOF effectively predicted job - related mental disorders . Subsequent studies will delve into the influence of WOFI on diverse professions and various health outcomes .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 Background As industrialization and urbanization have advanced significantly , the work environment is undergoing pro - found changes , and the fit level between workers and their work environment has become emerged as a novel stressor . Worker - occupation fit ( WOF ) is defined as the fit level between workers’ personal characteristics , needs and abilities , and the cultural atmosphere , sup - plies and demands within the work environment [ 1 ] . The concept of WOF originates from person - environ - ment fit theory ( PEF theory ) , initially proposed by Par - sons in his 1909 work , “ Choosing a Vocation ” [ 2 ] . PEF stands as a fundamental concept within the domains of organizational behavior and human resource man - agement [ 3 – 5 ] . While a substantial body of research has primarily focused on exploring the impacts of PEF on workers’ performance , turnover and organiza - tional performance , relatively little attention has been given to the relationship between fit and occupational stress . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) defined occupational stress as “the harmful physical and emotional responses that occur when the requirements of the job do not match the capabilities , resources , or needs of the worker” in Stress at Work . Given the consistency between this defi - nition of occupational stress and the essence of WOF , we have formulated a theoretical model delineating the health effects of WOF on occupational stress . Accord - ing to this model , we posit that workers’ health benefits is positively influenced by a high level of WOF , whereas misfit may induce occupational stress , thereby jeopard - izing workers’ well - being . Person - environment fit theory , one of the earliest theo - ries concerning occupational stress [ 6 ] , has yet to reach its full potential in applied research due to a lack of ade - quate measurement tools . The measurement of WOF can be approached in two ways : perceived fit and objec - tive fit . Existing studies overwhelmingly demonstrate that perceived fit exhibits superior predictive abilities for target outcomes [ 7 ] . In 2016 , Chunag et al . established the Perceived Person - Environment Fit Scale ( PPEFS ) from the perspective of organizational psychology [ 8 ] . Their study highlighted the significant predictive power of perceived person - environment fit concerning role behavior , job satisfaction , turnover , and organizational citizenship behavior . Recognizing the substantial impact of workers’ perceived fit on occupational stress and job - related diseases , our research is specifically designed to concentrate on workers’ perceived fit . Drawing upon the knowledge base of occupational stress and building upon prior research by Cable and DeRue [ 7 ] , our objective is to build the Worker - Occupation Fit Inventory ( WOFI ) . The dimensions of the WOFI have been formulated as follows : personal traits fit , need - supply fit , and demand - ability fit . To establish a reliable and valid measurement for WOF , both classic test theory ( CTT ) analysis and item response theory ( IRT ) analysis will be employed to assess the scale . CTT analysis , a conventional method in scale development , has limitations such as reliance on sam - ple parameters and discrepancies in scale difficulty and participant ability , leading to less accurate reliability esti - mation . IRT compensates for these shortcomings well . IRT effectively addresses these shortcomings by offering detailed insights into each item’s performance , unaffected by sample variations [ 9 ] . Petrillo , in their evaluation of patient - reported outcome measures [ 10 ] , found that while the results from both methods were similar , IRT provided more intricate information . The same conclu - sion was drawn in a study that simplified and evaluated the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire [ 11 ] . Accurate identification , measurement and evaluation of mental disorders within occupational populations form a crucial basis for implementing tailored interventions to enhance mental health in the workplace . The purpose of our study is to develop the WOFI , which is supposed to meet the following criteria : has great consistency with the theoretical framework and structure , performs sat - isfactorily in measuring WOF , and include items suit - able for JRMD screening and monitoring in occupational populations . Methods Procedures and participants This research is consist of a pre - investigation and a for - mal investigation . Prior to the investigations , the candi - date items were selected through literature analysis and theoretical hypotheses . The initial WOFI was established based on the theoretical framework and programmed decision - making process . The WOFI was refined through both a pre - investigation and a formal investigation . It was then utilized to analyze the relationship between WOF and JRMD . The research process is illustrated in Fig . 1 . The enrollment of participants in both stages followed the same inclusion and exclusion criteria . The inclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) individuals employed in the hospital ; ( 2 ) individuals with a minimum work experi - ence of 1 year ; and ( 3 ) individuals who voluntarily par - ticipated in this survey and provided informed consent . The exclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) participants on leave during this survey ( including sick leave , mater - nity leave , personal leave and those who pursuing fur - ther study ) ; ( 2 ) participants with incomplete or ineligible questionnaires ( < 80 % completed ) ; and ( 3 ) individuals currently diagnosed with tumors , severe organic diseases , or mental disorders . Page 3 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 In the pre - investigation , the sample size was calculated as 108 ( more than 9 % of the formal investigation sam - ple size ) . The participants were recruited among medi - cal workers who participated in physical examinations in a hospital in Sichuan Province . A total of 128 ques - tionnaires were collected in the pre - investigation , and a total of 8 participants with less than 1 work year or inva - lid questionnaires were excluded . The response rate was 93 . 8 % , and the sample size was in line with expectations ( more than 108 ) . The average age of the participants in the pre - investigation was 32 . 7 ( SD = 7 . 9 ) . A total of 38 . 3 % ( n = 46 ) of them were male , 61 . 7 % ( n = 74 ) were female . In terms of occupation , 42 . 5 % ( n = 51 ) of them were physi - cians , 28 . 3 % ( n = 34 ) were nurse , and 28 . 3 % ( n = 35 ) were hospital administrators . The pre - investigation was con - ducted to screen items for the target WOFI . In the formal investigation , the target WOFI was performed . Following Lachin’s method [ 12 ] , we calcu - lated the sample size parameters based on preliminary research findings . With a correlation coefficient of - 0 . 20 under the null hypothesis and a correlation coefficient limit of - 0 . 30 , the sample size was computed as 925 cases . Setting a design coefficient of 0 . 20 , the final sample size after correction is 1200 cases . Participants were recruited from medical workers in a hospital located in Sichuan Province and another in Henan Province . A total of 1 , 183 questionnaires were distributed during the formal investigation ( 562 ques - tionnaires in Sichuan province , 621 questionnaires in Henan province ) . Three participants on sick leave were excluded . Additionally , ten questionnaires from partici - pants with less than 1 year of work experience and eight duplicate or invalid questionnaires were excluded . Ulti - mately , 1 , 162 valid questionnaires were collected , result - ing in a response rate of 98 . 2 % . Of the participants , 24 . 7 % were male ( n = 287 ) , and 75 . 3 % were female ( n = 875 ) . The occupational composition was as follows : 25 . 3 % ( n = 294 ) were physicians , 55 . 3 % ( n = 643 ) were nurses , 6 . 6 % ( n = 76 ) were medical technologists , 4 . 1 % ( n = 48 ) were pharmacists , and 8 . 7 % ( n = 101 ) were hospital adminis - trators ( see other characteristics in Table 1 ) . Measures Worker‑occupation fit inventory Following the theoretical model , we established the Worker - Occupation Fit Inventory ( WOFI ) based on the perspective of perceived fit . The dimensions of WOFI include personal traits fit , need - supply fit and demand - ability fit . The personal traits fit dimension originates from supplementary fit , which occurs when an individual and an organization possess similar or matching charac - teristics [ 13 ] . In this context , personal trait fit was defined as the fit level between workers’ personality traits and organizational values . Personality is a stable but complex pattern of thoughts , feelings , and behaviors of individu - als [ 3 ] . Consequently , we meticulously gathered personal - ity traits known to influence occupational stress through extensive literature review , forming an item pool for per - sonal traits fit . Need - supply fit and demand - ability fit are mainly connected with job characteristic . Hackman Fig . 1 The flowchart Page 4 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 and Oldham’s job characteristic model ( JCM ) posits that core job characteristic significantly impact workers’ key psychological state [ 14 ] . Guided by this perspective , we collected questionnaires , including Hackman’s Job Diag - nostic Survey [ 15 ] , Karasek’s Job Content Questionnaire [ 16 ] , Smis’s Job Characteristic Inventory [ 17 ] , and Morge - son and Humphrey’s Work Design Questionnaire [ 18 ] . Items were chosen from those questionnaires , constitut - ing the item pools for need - supply fit and demand - abil - ity fit . All selected items were compiled into an EXCEL spreadsheet to form the item pool for the WOFI . Items were preliminarily screened by a decision - making panel utilizing a programmed decision - making approach . Through extensive literature review , analysis , and reference to existing scales , the decision - making panel selected items aligning with the concepts of each dimension . In the personal traits fit dimension , 16 items such as values , self - discipline , and self - motivation were included , numbered from A1 to A16 . In the demand – supply fit dimension , 6 items such as salary and welfare satisfaction , organizational support , and fairness were incorporated , numbered from B1 to B6 . The demand - ability fit dimension comprised 4 items including opera - tional ability requirements and theoretical knowledge requirements , numbered from C1 to C4 . The framework of the WOFI is shown in Fig . 2 . To ensure cultural rele - vance and participant comprehension , the decision - mak - ing panel adapted the selected items to fit the Chinese cultural context . Participants rated these items on a five - point Likert scale , ranging from 0 ( “Strongly Misfit” ) to 4 ( “Totally Fit” ) . Depression anxiety stress scale Depression Anxiety Stress Scale ( DASS - 21 ) , devel - oped by Lovibond P . F and Lovibond S . H [ 19 ] , has been translated into various languages and used widely . In a study involving Chinese medicine workers [ 20 ] , the DASS - 21 demonstrated high reliability , with a Cron - bach’s alpha coefficient exceeding 0 . 85 ( 0 . 95 ) . This scale comprises three subscales assessing stress , anxi - ety and depression , each consisting of seven items . The DASS - 21 was scored on a four - point Likert scale , ranging from 0 ( “Strongly Disagree” ) to 3 ( “Totally Agree” ) . To calculate the total scores for each subscale , the sum of the scores for the seven items was doubled . Higher scores indicated more severe mental disorders . A score exceeding 14 indicated stress , score exceeding 7 indicated anxiety , and score exceeding 9 indicated depression [ 19 ] . The DASS - 21 was employed to evalu - ate job - related mental disorders , including job - related stress ( JRS ) , job - related anxiety ( JRA ) and job - related depression ( JRD ) . To ensure accuracy , participants Table 1 Demographic and occupational characteristics of the participants in the formal study Variable Groups N % Sex Male 287 24 . 7 Female 875 75 . 3 Age ( year ) 20 ~ 341 29 . 4 30 ~ 449 38 . 6 40 ~ 372 32 . 0 Marital status Single 253 21 . 8 Unmarried cohabitation 17 1 . 5 Married 851 73 . 2 Divorced 41 3 . 5 Education College 243 20 . 9 Bachelor 813 70 . 0 Master or above 106 9 . 1 Income ( yuan per month ) < 3 , 000 137 11 . 8 3 , 000 ~ 559 48 . 1 5 , 000 ~ 430 37 . 0 10 , 000 ~ 36 3 . 1 Work experience ( year ) 1 ~ 259 22 . 3 5 ~ 262 22 . 5 10 ~ 337 29 . 0 20 ~ 304 26 . 2 Work hours ( per week ) < 40 210 18 . 1 40 ~ 475 40 . 9 50 ~ 266 22 . 9 60 ~ 211 18 . 1 Occupational categories Physician 294 25 . 3 Nurse 643 55 . 3 Medical technologist 76 6 . 6 Pharmacist 48 4 . 1 Hospital administrator 101 8 . 7 Job title Senior 234 20 . 1 Intermediate 383 33 . 0 Junior 482 41 . 5 No title 63 5 . 4 Night shift ( per week ) 0 387 33 . 3 1 ~ 560 48 . 2 3 ~ 182 15 . 7 5 ~ 33 2 . 8 Exercise ( per week ) 0 375 32 . 2 1 ~ 556 47 . 9 3 ~ 127 10 . 9 5 ~ 104 9 . 0 Drink Never 784 67 . 5 Rarely 336 28 . 9 Often 42 3 . 6 Smoke Never 1 , 029 88 . 5 Rarely 53 4 . 5 Often 80 6 . 9 Traumatic events YES 133 11 . 5 NO 1 , 029 88 . 5 Page 5 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 were prompted to recall work - related situations while completing the DASS - 21 . Statistical analysis Classic test theory analysis CTT analysis was conducted in the pre - investigation . First , item analysis was conducted to evaluate the dis - criminant validity for each item by comparing the dif - ference between the low group ( bottom 27 % in score ) and the high group ( top 27 % in score ) . Items with a p value < 0 . 05 w considered to have good discriminant validity . The Kaiser ‒ Meyer ‒ Olkin ( KMO ) test and Bartlett’s test of sphericity were performed to verify that the data were suitable for principal component analysis , and KMO values greater than 0 . 80 and the p values < 0 . 05 were acceptable . Then , exploratory fac - tor analysis ( EFA ) was conducted to screen items . The Cattell scree test was used to determine the number of common factors . The Cattell scree test was used to determine the number of common factors . Com - mon factors were extracted by principal component analysis and varimax rotation , and items were filtered and aggregated according to the factor loading of each item . After item screening , confirmatory factor anal - ysis ( CFA ) was conducted to estimate the factorial structure of the WOFI . For this purpose , three mod - els were evaluated : model 1 was a one - factor - model , and was considered a basal comparison model ; model 2 was a two - factor - model , and this model was built to see if there are two dimensions that should be com - bined ; and model 3 was a three - factor - model , and this model was built according to the three dimensions of the WOFI . The goodness - of - fit indices were χ 2 , com - parative fit index ( CFI ) , and standardized root mean squared residual ( SRMSR ) . Values equal to or below 3 . 0 on χ 2 / df , values equal to or above 0 . 90 on the CFI and values below 0 . 08 on the SRMR indicated a good model fit . The internal consistency of the WOFI was estimated with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient . Item response theory analysis IRT analysis was conducted in the formal investiga - tion . Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were calculated separately for each of the three subscales , with an acceptable range of alpha of more than 0 . 8 . Unidimen - sionality is one of the basic hypotheses of IRT , which needs to be verified before parameter estimation . The unidimensionality of the three subscales was tested by EFA , and a ratio of the first to second eigenvalue greater than 3 . 0 was acceptable . The graded response Fig . 2 The framework of the WOFI Page 6 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 model ( GRM ) was adapted to perform IRT analysis . Discrimination ( a ) and difficulty ( b ) were two impor - tant parameters . The discrimination reflected how well the scale distinguishes the participants’ latent . A higher a value indicated better discrimination , a value less than 0 . 50 indicated insufficient information , and a value higher than 4 . 0 indicated limited accuracy . Therefore , the value was set in the range of 0 . 50 to 4 . 0 [ 21 ] . The b values ( also called threshold indices ) indi - cated the difficulty of an item . The larger the b value is , the more difficult the items are . When the b values varied from - 4 to 4 , the difficulty of the item was mod - erate . In addition , the item characteristic curve ( ICC ) was used to visualize the parameters . The item infor - mation curve ( IIC ) for each item and the test informa - tion curve ( TIC ) for the WOFI were plotted to show the information amount that each item and the whole inventory provided , with an acceptable range of infor - mation amount of more than 1 . 0 . Relationship between WOF and job‑related mental disorders The overall scores of the WOFI were 64 , and the WOF level was graded according to the first and third quar - tiles , with low WOF level scoring no more than 38 points , medium WOF level scoring 39 – 51 points , and high WOF level scoring 51 – 64 points . Job - related mental disorders were set as binary outcomes ( with or without JRMD ) according to scores on the DASS - 21 . Scores greater than 14 , 7 , and 9 on the JRS , JRA , and JRD , respectively , indicated one of the job - related mental disorders . To explain the relationship between WOF and JRMDs , three risk models were constructed for JRS , JRA , and JRD . WOF and other variables with statistical significance in Pearson’s correlation analy - sis were included in the multiple logistic regression model . The incidence risk of JRS , JRA , and JRD was expressed as odds ratios ( OR s ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI s ) . A two - tailed p value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . All data analyses were performed by R software . Results Classic test theory analysis The WOFI scores were sorted from high to low , and the top 27 % ( scored more than 58 points ) of the total score were the high group , and the bottom 27 % ( scored less than 47 points ) of the total score were the low group . Sig - nificant differences were found between the two groups of scores in all items ( all p values < 0 . 001 , two - sample t - test ) , indicating that all items had good discriminant validity ( see Table S1 in the Supplemental materials ) . The KMO test was 0 . 91 and the p value was less than 0 . 01 in Bartlett’s test , which suggested that the data were adequate for conducting an EFA . Three common factors were extracted according to the Cattell scree test ( see the scree plot in Figure S1 ) . Item A1 , A4 , A5 , A6 , A7 , A10 , A11 , and A16 were excluded because their principal fac - tor loadings do not correspond to the concept . Item A2 and A12 were excluded due to their low principal factor loadings . Finally , item A3 , A8 , A9 , A13 , A14 , and A15 were included in FACTOR1 ( PTF ) , item B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , B5 , and B6 were included in FACTOR2 ( NSF ) , and item C1 , C2 , C3 , and C4 were included in FACTOR3 ( DAF ) ( see Table 2 ) . Then , CFA was conducted to verify the structure of the WOFI . The results of CFA for the three mod - els are shown in Table 3 . Model 3 had the best fit with χ 2 / df = 1 . 822 , CFI = 0 . 947 , and SRMSR = 0 . 056 , and the structure of model 3 is shown in Fig . 3 . The results of CFA verified that the WOFI consists of three dimensions , which was consistent with our theoreti - cal assumptions . The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the WOFI was 0 . 93 ( more than 0 . 80 ) , indicating great internal consistency of the scale . Item response theory analysis In the formal investigation , a large sample was used to conduct IRT analysis . The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of PTF , NSF , and DAF were 0 . 91 , 0 . 92 , and 0 . 80 , respec - tively . The KMO tests were 0 . 92 , 0 . 91 , and 0 . 80 , and the p values were all less than 0 . 001 in Bartlett’s test . The EFA analysis showed that the three subscales met the basic hypothesis of unidimensionality , with values of 189 . 00 , 64 . 50 and 16 . 64 ( all more than 3 ) on the ratio of the first to second eigenvalue ( see table S2 in Supplemen - tal materials ) . Table 4 reports the results of IRT analysis for WOFI . The values of all items ranged from 1 . 25 to 2 . 53 , which were within an acceptable range . The b val - ues of all items ranged from - 6 . 18 to 1 . 30 , and tended to increase monotonically as the difficulty level increased ( with no difficulty of reversal ) . The ICCs , IIC and TIC were used to visualize these results . For all items , each curve of the ICCs plots distinguished different response categories of each option , which was consistent with the results reflected in b values ( see Figure S2 in Supplemen - tal materials ) . IICs for each item showed that each item provided enough information with information amount values all greater than 1 . 5 ( see Figure S3 in Supplemental materials ) . Figures 4 and 5 show great examples of ICCs and IICs , respectively . The TIC for WOFI indicated that the inventory was also informative ( see Fig . 6 ) . The relationship between WOF and job‑related mental disorders The detection rate of JRS was 48 . 9 % ( n = 620 ) , the detec - tion rate of JRA was 73 . 0 % ( n = 935 ) , and the detection Page 7 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 rate of JRD was 69 . 0 % ( n = 874 ) in the formal investiga - tion . The WOF was negatively related to JRS ( r = - 0 . 34 , p < 0 . 001 ) , JRA ( r = - 0 . 37 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and JRD ( r = - 0 . 41 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Three risk models were constructed with vari - ables including sex , marital status , age , income , occupa - tional categories , job title , work experience , work hours , night shifts , exercise , drinking and traumatic events adjusted . The three models showed that a low level of WOF was a risk factor for JRS ( OR = 2 . 15 , p < 0 . 001 ) , JRA ( OR = 2 . 88 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and JRD ( OR = 2 . 57 , p < 0 . 001 ) , with all OR s more than 1 . 0 , and a high level of WOF was a protective factor for JRS ( OR = 0 . 15 , p < 0 . 001 ) , JRA ( OR = 0 . 07 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and JRD ( OR = 0 . 09 , p < 0 . 001 ) with all OR s less than 1 . 0 ( see Table 5 ) . Discussion To verify the theoretical model of the worker - occupa - tional - fit occupational - stress health effect , we developed and evaluated the WOFI , and the relationship between WOF and job - related mental disorders was verified . The study was divided into two stages .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 item screening . The initial version of the WOFI consisted of three dimensions with 26 items , included personal trait fit , need - supply fit and demand - ability fit . The items were rated by a five - point Likert scale . This measurement was performed in the pre - investigation , and the items were screened by CTT analysis . After EFA analysis , 6 items were retained in PTF , 6 items were retained in NSF , and 4 items were retained in DAF . The Cronbach’s alpha coef - ficient values for both the WOFI and the three subscales were above 0 . 8 , which suggested a great consistency of the measurement . In the formal investigation , we evalu - ated the WOFI and verified the relationship between WOF and job - related mental disorders . The evaluation was conducted by IRT analysis , and the discrimination values and difficulty values were within an acceptable range . The multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that a high level of WOF was a protective factor against job - related mental disorders , with all OR s less than 1 . A few studies have developed scales for PEF . The most widely used measure was developed by Cable and Derue [ 7 ] , who measured subjective fit from the perspective of organization psychology . This scale is reliable , validated and focused on the occupational context , which has both theoretical and practical implication for applica - tions of PEF in the field of occupational stress . However , there were some limitations in that we cannot utilize this scale in assessing occupational stress directly . Firstly , the supplementary fit only examined the value congruence between individuals and organizations , but there were many characteristics affecting WOF and workers’ men - tal health . Secondly , the complementary fit consisted of need - supply fit and demand - ability fit , but this scale only measured the need - supply fit . A multidimensional PEF instrument was developed by Chuang , A . [ 8 ] , named The Perceived Person - Environment Fit Scale ( PPEFS ) . The PPEFS also measured subjective fit directly and consisted of four subscales , including the Person – Job Fit Scale ( PJFS ) , the Person – Organization Fit Scale ( POFS ) , the Person – Group Fit Scale ( PGFS ) , and the Person – Super - visor Fit Scale ( PSFS ) . The PPEFS considered not only values , but also goals and attitudes , which is in line with the multidimensionality of PEF . The previous scales were most developed as instruments of organizational man - agement , human resource management and employee performance . Research on community psychology [ 22 ] also began to adopt PEF theory , and established a scale that met the goals of these studies . Although the previous scales cannot be applied in the area of occupational stress directly , they can be used for reference in our research . WOFI comprises three dimensions that align with Cable’s three - factor conceptual model . The dimensions and item content of WOFI are comprehensive , theo - retically addressing the issue of scale universality . The Fig . 3 The structure of the three - factor model Page 9 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 dimension of personal trait fit primarily assesses the fit level between personality traits and organizational val - ues , encompassing 6 items : professional ambition , curi - osity , perfectionism , decision - making , innovation and leadership . Kilian’s research [ 23 ] revealed that a moderate level of professional ambition , combined with the ability to effectively manage occupational stress , may contrib - ute to improved mental health among individuals adher - ing to masculinity norms . Another study focusing on highly educated young working women emphasized the significant impact of achieving a balance between ambi - tion and the work environment on health outcomes [ 24 ] .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 Regarding perfectionism , a study conducted among ath - letes demonstrated that both self - oriented and socially prescribed performance perfectionism were correlated with burnout [ 25 ] . Curiosity has been identified as a pro - tective factor against anxiety , depression , and suicidal ideation in several studies [ 26 , 27 ] . Additionally , research has linked decision - making [ 28 ] , innovation [ 29 ] and leadership [ 30 ] to the development of various job - related mental disorders . It is essential to recognize that the occupational environment and personality traits mutually influence each other [ 13 ] . The contents of need - supply fit and demand - ability fit drawn from widely employed Fig . 6 Test information curve for WOFI Fig . 5 Item information curve for B3 Page 11 of 12 Lv et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 2163 scales assessing job characteristics . These core job char - acteristics typically encompass skill variety , task identity , task significance , autonomy and feedback . Numerous studies have indicated that job characteristics exert influ - ence on various aspects , including occupational stress [ 31 ] , smoking behaviors [ 32 ] and other health outcomes [ 33 ] . In our research , we partitioned these job character - istics into job supply and job demand components to for - mulate items aligning with the theoretical model . This study has innovatively developed a work - occupation fit inventory tailored for the professional population based on the Person - Environment Fit theory and the knowledge framework of occupational stress . The WOFI addresses a notable gap in measurement tools , offering substantial con - tributions to the advancement and application of Person - Environment Fit theory within the realm of occupational health , as well as providing valuable insights into the explo - ration and clarification of occupational stress mechanisms . Moreover , our research has unearthed the significant role of WOF as a protective factor to cope with occupational stress . Elevating WOF levels has demonstrated the poten - tial to mitigate the risk of occupational stress occurrence . This discovery presents promising avenues for the preven - tion and intervention of occupational stress . However , it is important to acknowledge certain limi - tations in this study . Firstly , the survey was conducted exclusively among healthcare professionals , resulting in a relatively homogeneous study population . In order to diversify the composition of the study subjects , the hos - pital administrators were also included in the survey . In subsequent research endeavors , it would be beneficial to extend the application and validation of the scale to other professional groups and diverse work settings . Secondly , among the three dimensions of the scale , items related to NSF and DAF dimensions exhibited stronger psycho - metric properties compared to those for PTF dimension , although they still met the evaluation criteria . Variability in the understanding and discernment of different meas - urement contents among the participants contributed to performance disparities among the dimensions to some extent . Therefore , ongoing refinement of the theoretical model is necessary to enhance comprehensibility .
