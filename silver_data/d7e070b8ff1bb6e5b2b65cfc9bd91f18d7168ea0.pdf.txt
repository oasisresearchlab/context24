Here we present evidence that EHBP - 1 associ - ates with tubular endosomal phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ] enriched membranes through an N - terminal C2 - like ( NT - C2 ) domain , and define residues within the NT - C2 domain that mediate membrane interaction . Furthermore , our results indicate that the EHBP - 1 central calponin homology ( CH ) domain binds to actin microfilaments in a reac - tion that is stimulated by RAB - 10 ( GTP ) . Loss of any aspect of this RAB - 10 / EHBP - 1 system in the C . elegans intestinal epithelium leads to retention of basolateral recycling cargo in endosomes that have lost their normal tubular endosomal network ( TEN ) organization . We propose a mechanism whereby RAB - 10 promotes the ability of endosome - bound EHBP - 1 to also bind to the actin cytoskeleton , thereby promoting endosomal tubulation . Author Summary Endosomes are intracellular organelles that sort protein and lipid components integral to the membrane , as well as more loosely associated lumenal content , for delivery to distinct intracellular destinations . Endosomes associated with recycling cargo back to the plasma membrane are often tubular in morphology , and this morphology is thought to be essen - tial for recycling function . Our previous work identified a particularly dramatic network of endosomal tubules involved in membrane protein recycling in the basolateral intestinal epithelial cells of C . elegans . Our subsequent genetic analysis of basolateral recycling in this system identified a number of key regulators of these endosomes , including the small GTPase RAB - 10 and its effector EHBP - 1 . Our new work presented here shows that EHBP - 1 promotes endosomal tubulation by linking the membrane lipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to the PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 1 / 28 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Wang P , Liu H , Wang Y , Liu O , Zhang J , Gleason A , et al .

The funders had no role in study design , data actin cytoskeleton , and that the linkage of EHBP - 1 to actin is enhanced by the interaction of EHBP - 1 with RAB - 10 . This work has broad implications for how endosomal tubulation occurs in all cells , and has specific implications for the role of EHBP - 1 in related processes such as insulin - stimulated recycling of glucose transporters in human adipocytes , a pro - cess intimately linked to type II diabetes . Introduction Transmembrane proteins enter cells via several endocytic pathways including clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis ( CDE ) and a variety of less well understood clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) mechanisms [ 1 – 3 ] . After internalization some receptors will be recycled back to the plasma membrane via the endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) [ 4 , 5 ] . Recycling endosome transport is known to be essential for diverse biological processes , including cell migration , cytokinesis , and synaptic plasticity [ 5 ] . In the C . elegans intestine the small GTPase RAB - 10 resides on a subset of basolateral endo - somes where it regulates basolateral cargo recycling upstream of RME - 1 / EHD , a membrane remodeling protein with Dynamin - like features [ 6 – 9 ] . While the cargo - specificity of RME - 1 is broad , RAB - 10 appears more specific , with especially potent effects on the recycling of trans - membrane proteins internalized by CIE , such as the model CIE cargo hTAC ( the alpha - chain of the human IL2 receptor ) [ 6 , 10 ] . Rab10 function in mammalian cells appears highly conserved , where Rab10 is highly enriched on the membranes of the common recycling endosomes and reg - ulates basolateral recycling in polarized epithelial cells [ 11 ] . Likewise , in mammalian adipocytes , Rab10 functions in the insulin - stimulated recycling of glucose transporter GLUT4 [ 12 ] . The cal - ponin homology ( CH ) domain protein Ehbp1 has also been reported to function in GLUT4 recy - cling in adipocytes , associated with the RME - 1 homologs EHD1 and EHD2 [ 13 , 14 ] . In our previous work we determined that C . elegans EHBP - 1 binds to the GTP - loaded con - formation of RAB - 10 through its C - terminal domain ( a predicted coiled - coil ) and functions with RAB - 10 in the intestinal basolateral recycling of hTAC , and in the neuronal recycling of AMPA - type glutamate receptor GLR - 1 [ 10 , 15 ] . EHBP - 1 labels an extensive network of tubular endosomes in the intestine where it colocalizes with recycling cargo , and is also found on con - nected punctate endosomal membranes where it colocalizes with RAB - 10 . Loss of EHBP - 1 produces phenotypes that strongly resemble those produced upon loss of RAB - 10 . These include RAB - 10 - specific phenotypes in polarized cells such as the intestinal epithelium , includ - ing accumulation of enlarged basolateral endosomes filled with fluid - phase markers and hTAC , and the abnormal accumulation of endosomal GLR - 1 in interneurons [ 10 , 15 ] . ehbp - 1 mutants or RNAi also produce phenotypes in non - polarized cells very similar to simultaneous loss of RAB - 10 and its closest paralog RAB - 8 , including variable larval arrest , and fully pene - trant adult sterility due to a failure in germline membrane transport and oocyte growth [ 15 ] . In Drosophila dEHBP1 has also been reported to act with Rab11 [ 16 , 17 ] . Our previous studies found that a truncated form of EHBP - 1 lacking the RAB - 10 interac - tion domain remained membrane associated , raising the question of how EHBP - 1 associates with endosomal membranes [ 15 ] . Although not apparent in simple homology searches , a purely computational study using sequence profile searches with profile – profile comparison and fold recognition methods classified the EHBP - 1 N - terminus as a putative C2 - like domain ( NT - C2 ) that could potentially mediate direct membrane binding [ 18 ] . It has been shown that endosomal recruitment of some conserved recycling regulators depends on the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ] [ 9 ] . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is enriched at the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes , and membrane bending proteins associated with EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 2 / 28 collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript . Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . recycling function such as RME - 1 / EHD and AMPH - 1 / Amphiphysin / BIN1 have been shown to associate with membrane structures enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 9 , 19 , 20 ] . In fact , we have previ - ously shown that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 level in basolateral recycling endosomes is modulated by RAB - 10 , in part through its effector CNT - 1 , an ARF - 6 GAP [ 20 ] . Other reports also indicate a requirement for phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) in recycling endosome function [ 21 ] . These findings imply that EHBP - 1 could be targeted to recycling endosomes via PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and / or PI ( 4 ) P binding . In addition to its N - terminal C2 - like and C - terminal RAB - 10 - binding domains , EHBP - 1 harbors a central CH domain . CH domains in different proteins are known to bind to the cyto - skeleton , but vary in their specificity , with some binding to the microtubule cytoskeleton and others binding to actin filaments [ 22 ] . Requirements for the microtubule and actin cytoskele - tons are well established in the endosomal system [ 23 – 26 ] . The actin cytoskeleton also plays essential roles along the endocytic pathway . First identified in studies of endocytosis in yeast , Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation of actin at endocytic sites has been observed in many organisms , including mammals , and is thought to contribute to mem - brane fission [ 27 – 31 ] . Furthermore , certain forms of endocytic recycling are also actin - depen - dent . For instance , actin depolymerization results in the retention of TAC in tubular recycling endosomes together with Arf6 , suggesting the necessity of actin function in Arf6 - mediated recy - cling transport [ 32 , 33 ] . Retromer / WASH mediated local actin polymerization on endosomes has alternately been reported to enhance the fission of tubular cargo carriers from endosomes , or to stabilize tubular extensions for cargo loading prior to their release by fission [ 34 , 35 ] . Cargo carriers in the endosomal system are often tubular in nature , and their tubular shape has been proposed to help sort membrane intrinsic components away from lumenal content [ 4 , 36 ] . The endocytic recycling compartment in mammals is composed of a dense collection of endosomal tubules and vesicles [ 4 ] . In the C . elegans intestine the basolateral recycling com - partment enriched in CIE cargo , EHBP - 1 , and RME - 1 , is highly tubular in nature and appears to have many interconnections [ 8 , 15 , 37 ] . The entire network collapses to vesicles upon loss of RAB - 10 or EHBP - 1 , suggesting that they contribute to the formation and / or maintenance of such tubular endosomes [ 6 , 15 ] . To further dissect the function of RAB - 10 effector EHBP - 1 , we studied individual domains of EHBP - 1 in vitro and in vivo , and characterized EHBP - 1 regulation by RAB - 10 . Here we demonstrate that the NT - C2 and CH domains are both indispensible for proper EHBP - 1 func - tion . We found that the EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain has an intrinsic ability to associate with endo - somal membranes . RNAi - mediated knockdown of phosphoinositide kinases , colocalization assays with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 biosensor PH ( PLC δ ) - GFP , and liposome co - sedimentation assays revealed that the EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain preferentially associates with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 enriched endosomes via predicted patches of basic residues within the NT - C2 domain . Our biochemical studies indicate that the EHBP - 1 CH domain preferentially binds to actin filaments and not microtubules , and EHBP - 1 colocalizes with endosomal actin in vivo . Remarkably we find that the interaction of the EHBP - 1 C - terminal domain with RAB - 10 ( GTP ) enhances the actin fila - ment affinity of EHBP - 1 via its central CH domain . Our data demonstrates that RAB - 10 regu - lates EHBP - 1 actin binding and suggests that RAB - 10 and EHBP - 1 function together with actin to create and / or maintain endosomal tubulation . Results The NT - C2 domain is required for EHBP - 1 function and localization In ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) deletion mutants , or upon RNAi of ehbp - 1 , the tubular endosomal network is disrupted and large vacuoles accumulate near the basolateral membranes of the intestinal EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 3 / 28 cells , a phenotype very similar to rab - 10 mutants . Such vacuoles are grossly enlarged early endosomes that can be labeled by fluid - phase endocytosis markers taken up from the basolat - eral surface ( Fig 1B , S1A and S1A ' and S1E Fig ) [ 15 ] . This vacuole phenotype can be fully res - cued by intestine - specific expression of tagged forms of full - length EHBP - 1 ( Fig 1C and 1C ' , S1B – S1B ' ' and S1E Fig ) . EHBP - 1 contains three distinct protein domains , including an N - terminal C2 - like domain ( NT - C2 ) , central CH ( Calponin Homology ) domain , and C - terminal predicted coiled - coil ( CC ) domain ( Fig 1A ) [ 15 , 18 ] . Our previous studies showed that the predicted CC domain of EHBP - 1 binds to RAB - 10 ( GTP ) , and EHBP - 1 missing the CC domain does not rescue the ehbp - 1 mutant intestinal vacuole phenotype [ 15 ] . However , removal of the RAB - 10 - binding CC - domain does not cause redistribution of EHBP - 1 to the cytoplasm . Rather , EHBP - 1 lacking the CC - domain remains associated with misshapen endosomal membranes and acts as a domi - nant negative , impairing recycling [ 15 ] . These results indicated that while the CC - domain is important for function , EHBP - 1 must have a mechanism for membrane association indepen - dent of the RAB - 10 binding domain . Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the N - terminus of EHBP - 1 contains a C2 - like domain termed the NT - C2 . Since many C2 domains bind directly to membrane lipids , the newly pro - posed NT - C2 domain is an excellent candidate to mediate such EHBP - 1 membrane binding [ 18 ] . To better understand the functional significance of the predicted EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain , we analyzed the ability of GFP - tagged EHBP - 1 missing the predicted NT - C2 domain ( EHBP - 1 ( Δ NT - C2 ) - GFP ) to rescue the intestinal vacuolation of ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) mutants . Intestinally expressed EHBP - 1 ( Δ NT - C2 ) - GFP failed to rescue ( Fig 1D and 1D ' , S1C – S1C ' ' and S1E Fig ) , and was much more diffusive than intact EHBP - 1 , consistent with a function for the NT - C2 domain in recruiting EHBP - 1 to membranes . Furthermore , intestinal over - expression of the CH - CC fragment ( EHBP - 1 ( Δ NT - C2 ) ) in an otherwise wild - type background disrupted recy - cling cargo hTAC - GFP tubular endosomal localization and caused hTAC - GFP accumulation on enlarged endosomes and vacuoles ( S2E – S2F ' and S2H and S2I Fig ) . In the absence of the NT - C2 domain , the only remaining localized EHBP - 1 signal was restricted to small punctate structures ( S2A Fig ) , unlike full length EHBP - 1 - GFP , which localizes strongly to abundant tubular endosomes in the basolateral cortex , as well as apparently attached endosomal puncta ( Fig 1C ' ) . Notably , the residual EHBP - 1 ( Δ NT - C2 ) - GFP labeled puncta were lost upon removal of RAB - 10 ( S2B Fig ) . Taken together these results suggest that the NT - C2 domain of EHBP - 1 is important for EHBP - 1 function and the recruitment to tubular endosomal membranes , with a contribution by the RAB - 10 - binding CC - domain in recruitment to punctate endosomes . The EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain preferentially associates with endosomal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 Next we asked if the NT - C2 domain of EHBP - 1 is sufficient to direct GFP to endosomal struc - tures . When expressed in the C . elegans intestine , EHBP - 1 - NT - C2 ( aa1 - 223 ) - GFP localized to tubular and punctate endosomes , very similar to full length EHBP - 1 - GFP ( Fig 2A and 2B and Fig 2F ) , co - localizing with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 biosensor PH ( PLC δ ) - GFP on basolateral tubular and punctate membrane structures ( Fig 3A – 3A " ) [ 15 ] . Like full length EHBP - 1 , EHBP - 1 - NT - C2 ( aa1 - 223 ) - GFP also overlapped with ARF - 6 - RFP and RFP - RAB - 10 on basolateral puncta ( S3A – S3B ' ' Fig ) . EHBP - 1 - NT - C2 ( aa1 - 223 ) - GFP showed little colocalization with RFP - 2xFYVE , a marker for early endosome enriched lipid PI ( 3 ) P ( S4A – S4B ' ' Fig ) . Together our results indicate that the EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain is sufficient to direct EHBP - 1 to endosomes , probably via direct membrane binding .

Loss of a key EHBP - 1 binding lipid is expected to result in diffusion of NT - C2 - GFP protein in vivo . Depletion of PI - directed PI4 - kinase PIFK - 1 produced a nearly 3 - fold decrease in EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP labeling of endosomal puncta and tubules ( Fig 3F and Fig 3I ) . RNAi knockdown of PI ( 5 ) P - directed PI4 - kinase PPK - 2 produced a more modest ( ~ 35 % ) decrease in EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP endosome association ( Fig 3E and Fig 3I ) .

Consistent with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 being a key lipid in EHBP - 1 membrane recruitment , we observed a strong decrease in EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP labeling of endosomal puncta and tubules after RNAi - mediated depletion of PI ( 4 ) P - directed PI5 - kinase PPK - 1 , with a ~ 98 % decrease in average intensity ( Fig 3G and Fig 3I ) . Knockdown of PI ( 3 ) P - directed PI5 - kinase PPK - 3 did not affect EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP distribution ( Fig 3H and Fig 3I ) . In addition we did not find any effects on EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP localization after RNAi of PI3 - kinases including PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - directed PI3 - kinase AGE - 1 and PI - directed PI3 - kinase VPS - 34 ( Fig 3C and 3D and Fig 3I ) . Taken together , these results suggested that EHBP - 1 membrane recruitment requires PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in endosomes , whose level is mainly regulated by PI5 - kinase PPK - 1 and PI4 - kinase PIFK - 1 , and to a lesser extent PI4 - kinase PPK - 2 . Indeed , similar to the ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) mutant phenotype , hTAC - GFP lost its tubular endosomal localization and accumulated in punctate structures upon the knockdown of PPK - 1 , suggesting that endosomal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is required for the recycling function of EHBP - 1 ( S2G – S2G ' Fig ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels on endosomes is regulated by GTPase ARF - 6 , presumably through activa - tion of PI5 - kinase PPK - 1 [ 20 ] . Therefore , EHBP - 1 recruitment to endosomes may be depen - dent on ARF - 6 . Consistent with the action of ARF - 6 in PPK - 1 regulation , we found that EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP basolateral tubular and puncta labeling decreased in arf - 6 mutants ( ~ 60 % ) ( Fig 3J – 3L ) . To further define the endosomal phosphoinositide association preference of EHBP - 1 , we tested the interaction of purified recombinant GST - NT - C2 with liposomes in sedimentation assays . We found that GST - NT - C2 preferentially pelleted with liposomes containing 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , with much less co - sedimentation with liposomes containing PI or PI ( 4 ) P ( Fig 3M and 3N and S4C Fig ) . Basic amino acid patches are required for NT - C2 - domain recruitment to membranes To determine residues that may contribute to membrane association , we analyzed evolutionary sequence conservation within the NT - C2 domain , and mapped conserved positively charged residues onto a homology model that we constructed . Our model suggests that the N - terminal 160 amino acids of EHBP - 1 folds into a globular domain consisting of seven β - strands and an α - helical segment between strand - 5 and strand - 6 .

( E - F ) EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP punctate and tubular endosomal labeling decreased ( ~ 62 % ) after RNAi knockdown of PI - directed PI4 - kinase PIFK - 1 , while the knockdown of PI ( 5 ) P - directed PI4 - kinase PPK - 2 caused a moderate EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP labeling decrease ( ~ 35 % ) . ( G - H ) EHBP - 1 ( NT - C2 ) - GFP lost its endosomal labeling ( ~ 98 % ) in ppk - 1 ( RNAi ) animals ( PI ( 4 ) P - directed PI5 - kinase ) .

We performed alanine substitution in three areas of the NT - C2 domain in the context of the NT - C2 - GFP intestinal expression construct ( Fig 4G ) . Compared with wild type , modifica - tion of the four arginines within the patch prior to strand - 1 , predicted to line the concavity , results in loss of association with tubular endosomal membranes and diffusion of the mutated NT - C2 - GFP within the cytosol ( Fig 4A and 4B and Fig 4I ) . Mutation of pairs of arginines within this sequence reduced but did not eliminate membrane association , suggesting that all four arginines contribute to NT - C2 domain membrane binding ( Fig 4E and 4F and Fig 4I ) .

In contrast to WT EHBP - 1 ( S1B – S1B ' ' Fig ) , the number and size of vacuoles were not rescued by EHBP - 1 ( RRLRR6AALAA ) - GFP , indicating that the RRLRR motif is critical for EHBP - 1 recycling function ( S4D and S4E Fig ) . Mutation of nearby lysines , predicted to face away from the cleft , had no effect on the association of NT - C2 - GFP with tubular endosomes ( Fig 4D and Fig 4I ) . Another patch of basic residues ( HRRRK of strand - 2 ) on the predicted surface of the NT - C2 domain also appears to contribute to NT - C2 membrane association , as mutation of this sequence also produced a diffusive localization ( Fig 4C and Fig 4I ) . Collectively , our results suggest that EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain associates with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 enriched endosomal membranes through two patches of basic amino acids . The CH - domain is required for EHBP - 1 function but not subcellular localization To determine if the CH domain is important for the subcellular localization of EHBP - 1 to endosomes we expressed GFP - tagged EHBP - 1 lacking the CH domain ( EHBP - 1 ( Δ CH ) - GFP ) in the intestinal epithelia . The CH domain did not appear to be a major determinant of locali - zation , since EHBP - 1 ( Δ CH ) - GFP was enriched on tubular and punctate membranes in a pat - tern indistinguishable from intact EHBP - 1 - GFP ( S2C Fig ) . This localization was also RAB - 10 - dependent like full - length EHBP - 1 , displaying significant intracellular accumulation on puncta and vacuoles in rab - 10 ( ok1494 ) mutant animals ( S2D Fig ) . Nevertheless , intestinally expressed EHBP - 1 ( Δ CH ) - GFP failed to rescue the ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) mutant vacuole phenotype ( Fig 1E – 1E ' , S1D – S1D ' ' and S1E Fig ) , indicating that the CH domain is also indispensible for EHBP - 1 function . Unlike the NT - C2 domain above , which conferred robust localization to endosomes on its own , expression of the EHBP - 1 CH - domain ( aa260 - 510 ) , fused to GFP , localized relatively dif - fusely in the intestinal cells . Sparse puncta were visible above background . These puncta par - tially overlapped with ARF - 6 and RAB - 10 , indicating that they represent very weak recruitment to endosomes ( Fig 2C and Fig 2F and S3C – S3D ' ' Fig ) . By contrast , the C - terminal RAB - 10 - binding domain , expressed as EHBP - 1 - CC ( 510 - 901aa ) - GFP , lacked tubular localization but retained visible localization on punctate endo - somes labeled by ARF - 6 - RFP and RFP - RAB - 10 ( Fig 2D and 2D ' and Fig 2F and S3E – S3F ' ' Fig ) . RAB - 10 was required for this punctate recruitment , since the punctate labeling of EHBP - 1 - CC - GFP was lost in rab - 10 ( ok1494 ) mutant animals ( Fig 2E and 2E ' and Fig 2F ) . This is dis - tinct from the full length EHBP - 1 protein that remains membrane associated in a rab - 10 mutant background , presumably through the NT - C2 domain [ 15 ] . The EHBP - 1 CH domain preferentially interacts with actin microfilaments CH domains have the potential to interact with cytoskeletal elements [ 22 ] . Structural studies on the kinetochore attached Ndc80 complex indicated that a CH - domain pair is involved in microtubule binding [ 38 ] . Mammalian EHBP1 was shown to colocalize with the cortical actin cytoskeleton in COS - 1 cells , and overexpression of HA - EHBP1 induced cortical actin rear - rangement [ 13 ] . Homology analysis suggests that the CH domain of C . elegans EHBP - 1 most closely resembles the CH domain of β spectrin and the second CH domain of utrophin [ 39 , 40 ] . To determine if the EHBP - 1 CH - domain interacts with actin microfilaments or microtu - bules , we assayed for interaction in vitro using co - sedimentation assays ( Fig 5A – 5F ) . First , we validated our co - sedimentation assays using human Utrophin actin binding CH - domains EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 10 / 28 Fig 5 .

Similarly , we found that a purified fusion of GST to the EHBP - 1 CH - domain increased its sedimentation by more than 5 - fold in the presence of actin microfila - ments , indicating that the EHBP - 1 CH domain binds to polymerized actin ( Fig 5A – 5C ) . By contrast , addition of microtubules to the reaction failed to enhance GST - CH sedimentation ( Fig 5D – 5F ) . These results suggested that the EHBP - 1 CH - domain functions to link EHBP - 1 to polymerized actin . Association of EHBP - 1 labeled tubular recycling endosomes with actin in vivo Previous work in C . elegans indicated that microtubules are required for the structure of tubu - lar endosomes in the basolateral intestine [ 37 ] . Because we found binding of EHBP - 1 to actin microfilaments in vitro , we asked whether actin polymerization is also important for the struc - ture of these endosomes . Thus we injected the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin B ( LatB ) into the worm pseudocoelom ( body cavity ) and assayed for effects on the EHBP - 1 - GFP labeled tubular endosomal meshwork . Indeed , LatB treatment greatly disrupted the EHBP - 1 - GFP pat - tern , converting many of the tubules to puncta ( Fig 5G – 5H and Fig 5J and 5K ) . Similar treat - ment with the microtubule - depolymerizing drug nocodazole ( Noc ) affected the EHBP - 1 - GFP meshwork in a different manner . The tubular network was still observed , but in a dotted line pattern ( Fig 5I – 5K ) . We also assayed the distribution of PH ( PLC δ ) - GFP labeled basolateral endosomal tubules after LatB and Noc treatments and observed similar results ( S5A – S5D Fig ) . These results indicate that formation or maintenance of basolateral tubular endosomes labeled by EHBP - 1 requires both actin and microtubule cytoskeletal elements , although EHBP - 1 itself is probably actin - specific in its interactions . To further test the functional involvement of actin and microtubules in EHBP - 1 mediated recycling we assayed Lat B and Noc treatments for effects on the well - defined recycling CIE cargo marker hTAC - GFP [ 6 , 15 ] . In our previous work we showed that loss of EHBP - 1 specifi - cally impaired hTAC - GFP recycling [ 15 ] . Our analysis indicates that hTAC - GFP accumulates intracellularly in intestinal epithelial cells after depolymerization of either actin or microtu - bules ( S6A – S6D Fig ) . If EHBP - 1 links endosomal membranes to actin microfilaments then we would expect to find colocalization of EHBP - 1 - GFP with F - actin marker Lifeact - RFP . Indeed we found that many punctate regions of endosomes labeled by EHBP - 1 - GFP in intestinal cells were positive for Lifeact - RFP ( Fig 5L – 5L " ) . This is consistent with the localization of actin to endosomes microtubule cytoskeletons . ( G ) EHBP - 1 - GFP mainly localized to normal appearing tubular endosomes after injection of control DMSO . ( H ) The intestinal EHBP - 1 - GFP positive tubular meshwork was disrupted , and EHBP - 1 - GFP puncta number increased by about 2 - fold , after LatB treatment . ( I ) Microtubule - depolymerizing drug nocodazole ( Noc ) treatment did not fully disrupt EHBP - 1 labeled tubular network . ( J - K ) EHBP - 1 - GFP labeled puncta number ( structure count ) and total fluorescence area ( total area ) of these puncta within unit region were quantified respectively . Error bars are SEM ( n = 18 , 6 animals of each treatment were sampled in three different unit regions of each intestine defined by a 100 x 100 ( pixel 2 ) box positioned at random ) . Asterisks indicate significant differences in the one - tailed Student ’ s t - test ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . ( L - L " ) Actin marker Lifeact - RFP colocalizes well with EHBP - 1 - GFP on basolateral punctate endosomes in intestinal cells . ( M - N " and O ) The overlap between Lifeact - RFP and EHBP - 1 - GFP requires the CH domain . EHBP - 1 ( Δ NT - C2 ) - GFP colocalizes with actin marker Lifeact - RFP on punctate structures , however , loss of the EHBP - 1 CH domain in a rab - 10 mutant background resulted in the decrease of EHBP - 1 - GFP and Lifeact - RFP overlap percentage ( from ~ 47 % to ~ 8 % ) . Percentage of GFP fluorescence area overlapping with Lifeact - RFP was sampled in three different regions of each intestine defined by a 100 x 100 ( pixel 2 ) box positioned at random ( n = 18 per genotype ) .

Asterisks indicate significant differences in the one - tailed Student ’ s t - test ( * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . Scale bars represent 10 μ m . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 . g005 EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 12 / 28 [ 19 ] . Likewise , some tubular overlap was observed between EHBP - 1 - RFP and EMTB - GFP , a marker for microtubules ( S6E – S6E " Fig ) , indicating that EHBP - 1 labeled tubular endosomes orient co - linearly with cortical microtubules . We also analyzed the importance of the EHBP - 1 CH domain for EHBP - 1 colocalization with actin . We found that CH - GFP , lacking the other domains of EHBP - 1 , colocalized with Lifeact - RFP on intestinal endosomes ( S6F – S6F " Fig ) . To determine whether the EHBP - 1 locali - zation with actin is dependent on its CH domain in vivo , we assayed for colocalization of EHBP - 1 missing the CH domain with Lifeact - RFP in wild - type and in a rab - 10 ( ok1494 ) mutant background . EHBP - 1 ( Δ CH ) - GFP retained some overlap with Lifeact - RFP ( Fig 5M – 5M " and Fig 5O ) . However , in rab - 10 ( ok1494 ) mutant animals , EHBP - 1 ( Δ CH ) - GFP fusion protein overlap with Lifeact RFP decreased ~ 83 % , with most remaining GFP positive structures offset from Lifeact - RFP puncta ( Fig 5N – 5N " and Fig 5O ) . Thus we interpret the EHBP - 1 ( Δ CH ) - GFP colocalization with Lifeact - RFP to be mediated via interaction with endogenous RAB - 10 and not direct interaction with actin . RAB - 10 ( GTP ) promotes the interaction of EHBP - 1 with actin filaments Our data suggested that EHBP - 1 CH - domain associates with endosomal actin microfilaments in vitro and in vivo . To determine whether the RAB - 10 - binding CC - domain influences the actin affinity of the EHBP - 1 CH - domain , we assayed for effects of RAB - 10 on the ability of a GST - CH - CC fusion protein to co - sediment with F - actin . Without addition of RAB - 10 to the reaction , an EHBP - 1 fragment containing the CH and CC domains displayed a similar level of interaction with F - actin as the CH domain alone ( Fig 5A and S7A and S7B Fig ) . However , we detected elevated co - sedimentation of CH - CC with F - actin in the presence of active HA - RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) , suggesting that RAB - 10 ( GTP ) interaction with the EHBP - 1 CC - domain enhances the ability of EHBP - 1 to bind to actin filaments ( Fig 6A and Fig 6C and 6D ) . In contrast , addition of HA - RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) did not enhance the ability of an EHBP - 1 fragment lacking the RAB - 10 binding CC - domain ( C2 - CH ) to co - sediment with actin ( S7D and S7E Fig ) . As expected , we did not detect interaction between a GST control protein and F - actin ( Fig 6B and Fig 6C ) . Consistent with the in vitro data , we found that the EHBP - 1 ( CH - CC ) - GFP colocalized well with Lifeact - RFP in the C . elegans basolateral intestine ( S6G – S6G " Fig ) . Importantly , the augmented physical interaction between EHBP - 1 and F - actin in the pres - ence of RAB - 10 was further confirmed in vivo by co - immunoprecipitation experiments between GFP - tagged EHBP - 1 and endogenous actin in whole - worm lysates . EHBP - 1 - GFP was immunoprecipitated from worm lysates using an anti - GFP antibody and the precipitants were probed with an anti - actin antibody on western blots . The amount of actin co - immunoprecipi - tating with EHBP - 1 - GFP was strongly reduced in rab - 10 ( ok1494 ) mutants , suggesting that RAB - 10 promotes the interaction of EHBP - 1 with F - actin ( Fig 6E ) . EHBP - 1 mediated bridging of endosomal membranes and actin microfilaments promotes endosomal tubularity Loss of EHBP - 1 disrupts the tubular endosomal network as visualized by hTAC - GFP ( Fig 6F and 6G ) or ARF - 6 - RFP ( S8A and S8B Fig ) . Using the integrity of the hTAC - GFP labeled net - work as an assay , we sought to test the functionality of versions of EHBP - 1 containing different combinations of domains . Importantly we found that overexpression of an EHBP - 1 fragment including the membrane associating NT - C2 and F - actin binding CH domains can partially res - cue the steady state tubular pattern of recycling cargo marker hTAC - GFP ( Fig 6F and 6H and Fig 6K ) . This was in sharp contrast to the effects of expressing a CH - CC fragment or C2 - CC fragment , neither of which could restore hTAC - GFP tubularity ( Fig 6I and 6J and Fig 6K ) .

RAB - 10 ( GTP ) promotes co - sedimentation of EHBP - 1 with F - actin and C2 - CH partially restores hTAC - GFP tubular endosomal localization in an ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) mutant background . ( A ) GST - CH - CC EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 14 / 28 This difference in rescuing ability was even more apparent in time - lapse imaging . Normally the hTAC - GFP labeled endosomal network in the basolateral intestine is highly dynamic , with frequent movement of puncta and tubules ( Fig 6L and S1 Video ) . In ehbp - 1 mutant animals the hTAC - GFP labeled endosomes are devoid of movement , appearing almost completely static ( Fig 6L and S2 Video ) . This could be significantly rescued in an ehbp - 1 mutant expressing the C2 - CH fragment , but not upon expression of CH - CC or C2 - CC fragments ( Fig 6L and S3 – S5 Videos ) . Compared with ~ 18 tubule movement events ( per unit area ) / 180 sec in wild - type animals , and ~ 1 event / 180 sec in ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) mutant animals , C2 - CH expression animals presented moderate dynamics with ~ 7 events / 180 sec ( Fig 6L ) . These results are consistent with an important role for EHBP - 1 in linking the endosomal membrane to the actin cytoskele - ton , and the EHBP - 1 CC domain - RAB - 10 interaction acting as an enhancer for EHBP - 1 CH domain - actin filaments binding during endocytic recycling , regulating membrane tubule for - mation and function . Discussion Our studies in C . elegans have demonstrated a requirement for EHBP - 1 in basolateral recycling of CIE cargo in intestinal epithelia and postsynaptic recycling of AMPA receptors in interneu - rons , functioning with the small GTPase RAB - 10 [ 10 , 15 ] . EHBP - 1 is enriched in the intestinal cells on basolateral tubular and punctate endosomes , and loss of EHBP - 1 results in reduced lev - els of interacting protein RAB - 10 on endosomal membranes [ 15 ] . Loss of RAB - 10 or EHBP - 1 also completely disrupts the tubular character of these endosomes [ 15 ] . Our new data suggests that this loss of tubular character , which is closely linked with recycling endosome function , is due to a loss of EHBP - 1 - dependent linkage between endosomal membranes and F - actin . The EHBP - 1 N - terminal domain was predicted by bioinformatics to adopt a C2 domain - like fold ( termed NT - C2 ) that might allow it to bind to membrane phosphatidylinositols , while the central CH domain suggested an interaction with the cytoskeleton [ 18 , 22 ] . In this study , we demonstrated the pivotal roles of EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain and CH domain in EHBP - 1 - mediated recycling regulation . Using in vitro and in vivo assays , we showed that the NT - C2 domain association with endosomal membranes requires two groups of basic residues ( 260 - 901aa ) co - sediments with actin filaments in vitro . The co - sedimentation level of GST - CH - CC with actin filaments increased by ~ 67 % when complexed with HA - RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) , a predicted constitutively active form of RAB - 10 .

We also found that the CH - domain associates with actin filaments but not microtubules , and that F - actin is important for developing the tubular character of these EHBP - 1 associated endosomes . Remarkably , we found that the interaction of the EHBP - 1 CC domain with RAB - 10 ( GTP ) enhanced the CH domain affinity for actin filaments . Thus our studies suggest that RAB - 10 promotes bridging of recycling endosomes and actin filaments via EHBP - 1 to create or main - tain endosomal tubulation . Recent phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling predicted an NT - C2 domain in the Ehbp1 / EHBP - 1 extreme N - terminus , providing a potential interface for EHBP - 1 membrane lipid binding [ 18 ] . Studies focusing on the well known Ca 2 + - dependent C2 domain of PKC and the Ca 2 + - independent C2 domain of PI3K proposed that C2 domain lipid binding capacity involves two structural segments including a calcium binding pocket - like structure and a β - sandwich surface respectively [ 41 , 42 ] . The negatively charged acidic residues in the pocket can coordinate Ca 2 + and lipid binding [ 41 , 43 ] . The clustered positively charged basic residues ( H , R and K ) within the β - sandwich regions of Ca 2 + - independent C2 domains participate in the interaction with negatively charged lipids [ 18 ] . However , bioinformatics predictions of the membrane binding mode of NT - C2 family proteins suggested that the NT - C2 extreme N - ter - minus , prior to strand - 1 , contains a patch of basic residues on the surface , contributing to lipid binding in parallel with the β - sandwich concave surface [ 18 ] . Our data revealed two regions of basic residues that appear to contribute to EHBP - 1 NT - C2 membrane association . In our structural model these two basic regions appear to be located on opposite sides of the domain . Further structural dissection of the NT - C2 will be required to determine the true arrangement . As reported in previous studies , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and PI4P are both enriched in recycling endo - somes and are important for recycling transport [ 20 , 21 ] . Our experimental results clearly indi - cated that the EHBP - 1 NT - C2 domain is required for association with tubular endosomes and interacts with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Within the limits of our assays , we did not observe obvious changes in the tubular endosomal network upon knockdown of PI3 kinases known to be important for early endosome function , such as type III PI3 - kinase VPS - 34 or type I PI3 - kinase AGE - 1 , sug - gesting that they mainly affect other aspects of endosome function [ 44 – 55 ] . Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is also known to be quite important for recruitment of many peripheral membrane pro - teins necessary for membrane traffic , including endocytic recycling , and phosphatidic acid ( PA ) has been implicated in recycling tubule formation in mammalian cells [ 56 – 61 ] . It will be important to test for roles of PS and PA in EHBP - 1 function in the future . C2 domains display a wide range of lipid selectivity , with preference for anionic PS and phosphatidylinositol - phosphates ( PIPs ) [ 41 ] . Unlike lipid binding PH domains [ 62 ] , C2 lipid targeting often involves two recognition components , such as two lipids or a lipid / protein com - bination . For instance the protein kinase C ( PKC ) C2 domain uses its basic surface residues to bind plasma membrane PS and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 63 ] , while cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) binds to the neutral lipid phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and the anionic lipid ceramide - 1 - phos - phate ( C1P ) through C2 domain Ca 2 + site charged hydrophobic side chains and a basic cluster [ 64 ] . Synaptotagmin utilizes two C2 domains to bridge the vesicular and plasma membranes , with the C2A domain binding vesicular PS and SNARE , while the C2B domain binds plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and SNARE [ 65 , 66 ] . The molecular basis for phosphoinositide - binding specificity of C2 and C2 - like domains has been explored in recent years . Structural analysis of the PKC α C2 domain showed that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binds to the concave surface of β 3 and β 4 strands . Intriguingly , aromatic residues Tyr 195 ( strand 2 ) and Trp 245 ( strand 5 ) interact directly with the inositol ring phosphate moie - ties of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Loss of Tyr 195 and Trp 245 abrogated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 recognition and plasma mem - brane association of PKC α [ 67 ] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that Tyr 195 and Trp 245 are EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 16 / 28 conserved among different C2 domains except in the DOCK - C2 and NT - C2 families [ 18 ] . However , Trp 71 of EHBP - 1 / Ehbp1 NT - C2 strand 4 is highly conserved among NT - C2 family members . One plausible possibility is that the Trp 71 residue participates , at least in part , in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binding specificity . Further functional analysis will be required to test this model . Filamentous actin has long been known to be particularly important for the Arf6 - mediated recycling of CIE cargo such as TAC and MHCI [ 5 , 32 ] . Colocalization assays and the presence of predicted actin - binding domains have indicated that NT - C2 proteins are involved in actin binding [ 13 , 18 ] . For instance Ehbp1 colocalizes with cortical actin filaments in cultured mam - malian adipocytes and in Drosophila pII cells of the external mechanosensory organs [ 13 ] . Since certain CH domains have extensively documented actin binding and bundling functions , we hypothesized that EHBP - 1 would link to the actin cytoskeleton via its CH domain [ 68 – 70 ] . Accordingly , our work strongly suggests that EHBP - 1 promotes endosomal tubulation by link - ing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 enriched endosomal membranes to F - actin . Microtubules are also critical players in many different intracellular trafficking processes . Although some CH domains bind to microtubules , C . elegans tubular endosomes aligned along microtubules , and hTAC recycling in the intestine is impaired upon microtubule disruption , no interaction of the EHBP - 1 CH - domain with microtubules was detected in our assays . Thus we infer that while EHBP - 1 is microfilament - specific , microtubules play an important role in C . elegans CIE cargo basolateral recycling , collaborating with the microfilament cytoskeleton to shape the endosomal network [ 37 ] . EHBP - 1 may promote endosome tubulation by trans - ducing force from growing actin filaments to endosomal membranes . Alternatively , EHBP - 1 may anchor endosomal membranes to the actin cytoskeleton while other forces , such as pulling by microtubule motors , acts to deform the membranes . CH - domain based actin binding structures , such as those found in alpha - actinin and spec - trin , often present as a tandem arrangement of two CH domains ( CH1 - CH2 ) [ 22 , 71 ] . The CH1 - CH2 dimer takes on a juxtaposed conformation , with weak F - actin affinity until the dimer adopts an open conformation [ 72 , 73 ] . Utrophin and dystrophin atomic structural mod - els suggest a theme of tandem CH - domains , with one CH domain apposed to the other CH , within the same molecule or provided by two different molecules [ 74 , 75 ] . In the current study our experiments indicated that the EHBP - 1 CH domain mediates the interaction with F - actin , and suggested that the RAB - 10 interaction with the EHBP - 1 CC - domain somehow potentiates the CH domain - F - actin interaction . Since we did not detect a dif - ference in F - actin binding of the EHBP - 1 CH only versus CH - CC fragments , and we also did not detect binding of the CH domain to the CC domain , we do not favor an auto - inhibition model for RAB - 10 mediated activation of EHBP - 1 actin binding activity ( S8C Fig ) . Rather , since RAB - 10 interacts with a predicted coiled - coil domain in EHBP - 1 , RAB - 10 binding may potentiate EHBP - 1 multimerization , producing a multivalent presentation of apposed CH domains from the dimerized EHBP - 1 molecules . Further analysis will be required to test this model ( S8D Fig ) . We also note that in mammalian adipocytes Rab10 and Ehbp1 are key regulators of insulin stimulated GLUT4 recycling , but their relationship has not been tested [ 12 , 14 , 76 ] . Future investigation of the Ehbp1 - mediated bridging of endosomal membranes and the actin cytoskel - eton in human adipocytes could prove fruitful .

Strains expressing transgenes were grown at 20°C . A complete list of strains used in this study can be found in S1 Table . RNAi was performed using the feeding method [ 78 ] . Feeding constructs were either from the Ahringer library [ 79 ] or prepared by PCR from EST clones provided by Dr Yuji Kohara ( National Institute of Genetic , Japan ) followed by subcloning into the RNAi vector L4440 [ 78 ] . For most experiments , synchronized L1 or L3 stage animals were treated for 48 – 72 h and were scored as adults . Antibodies The following antibodies were used in this study : rabbit anti - actin polyclonal antibody ( sc - 1616 - R ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnologies , Dallas , TX ) , rabbit anti - HA monoclonal antibody ( C29F4 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) , rabbit anti - GST monoclonal antibody ( 91G1 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) and rabbit anti - GFP polyclonal antibody - Chip Grade ( ab290 ) ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . Protein expression N - terminally hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged proteins , 2xHA only and RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) were syn - thesized in vitro using the TNT - coupled transcription - translation system ( Promega , Madison , WI ) using DNA templates pcDNA3 . 1 - 2xHA - Gtwy and pcDNA3 . 1 - 2xHA - RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) ( 1 μ g / each 50 μ l reaction ) , respectively . The reaction cocktail was incubated at 30°C for 90 min . Control glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) , GST - EHBP - 1 ( 260 - 510aa ) , GST - EHBP - 1 ( 1 - 510aa ) , GST - EHBP - 1 ( 260 - 901aa ) and GST - hUtrophin actin binding domain ( 1 - 261aa ) fusion proteins were expressed in the ArcticExpress strain of Escherichia coli ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Bacte - rial pellets were lysed in Lysis solution ( 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF or Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) ) . Extracts were cleared by centrifugation , and supernatants were incubated with glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) at 4°C overnight . For GST pull down , beads were washed six times with cold STET buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) . In vitro synthesized HA - tagged protein ( 15 μ l TNT mix diluted in 500 μ l STET ) was added to the beads and allowed to bind at 4°C overnight . After six additional washes in STET , the proteins were eluted by boiling in 30 μ l 2xSDS - PAGE sample buffer . Eluted proteins were separated on SDS - PAGE ( 12 % polyacrylamide ) , blotted to PVDF , and probed with anti - HA ( C29F4 ) and anti - GST ( 91G1 ) antibodies . For protein purification , beads were then washed six times with cold PBS . The bound proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris - HCL pH 8 . 0 , and 20 mM reduced L - glutathione . Eluted GST fusion peptides were then exchanged into 20 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM Mgcl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT . All GST fusion proteins are centrifuged at 150 , 000x g for 1 h at 4°C prior to use in the co - sedimentation assays at the indicated molar concentrations . Liposome co - sedimentation assay 3ug GST - EHBP - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) or GST was mixed with 10ul 1mM Control PolyPIPosomes , PI PolyPIPosomes , PI4P PolyPIPosomes , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 PolyPIPosomes , respectively ( Echelon Biosci - ences , Salt Lake City , UT ) and rotated for 15 min at room temperature in 1 ml liposome bind - ing buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) . The mixture was centrifuged at 90 , 000xg for 15 min , collecting the supernatant . The liposome pellet was resuspended in 1 ml liposome binding buffer and centrifuged at 90 , 000xg for 15 min to wash off unspecific bound proteins , this step was repeated three times . The pellet and 20ul supernatant samples EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 18 / 28 were resolved by SDS - PAGE , and GST fusion proteins were detected by western analysis using anti - GST antibody . F - actin co - sedimentation assay Actin co - sedimentation assays were performed using an Actin - Binding Protein Biochem Kit : Non - Muscle Actin ( BK013 ) ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) , essentially as described by the manu - facturer . Supplied α - actinin was used as a positive control . Briefly , protein preparations were incubated with 40ul freshly polymerized non - muscle actin ( 21 μ M F - actin ) or F - actin buffer alone . In order to test whether RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) enhances GST - EHBP - 1 ( 260 - 901aa ) binding to F - actin , in vitro synthesized HA - RAB - 10 ( Q68L ) and HA - only were added to the mixture . After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature , samples were centrifuged at 150 , 000x g for 1 . 5 h at 24°C to pellet F - actin and the co - sedimenting proteins . Supernatants were collected on ice , and pellets were resuspended on ice for 10 min . SDS - PAGE sample buffer was added to both supernatant and pellet fractions , and the entire fractions were then resolved by SDS - PAGE gel and processed for western blot or stained with coomassie blue . GST - EHBP - 1 ( 260 - 510aa ) , GST - EHBP - 1 ( 260 - 901aa ) , GST - EHBP - 1 ( 1 - 510aa ) and GST - hUtrophin ( 1 - 261aa ) co - sedimentations with F - actin were quantified by densitometry using FluorChem FC3 version 3 . 4 . 0 ( ProteinSimple , San Jose , CA ) . Microtubule co - sedimentation assay The microtubule - binding assays were performed using the Microtubule Binding Protein Spin - Down Assay Kit ( BK029 ) ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . Microtubules were polymerized in cushion buffer ( 80 mM PIPES pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 60 % glycerol ) for 20 min at 35°C and stabilized with taxol . GST - EHBP - 1 ( 260 - 510aa ) and the control proteins were mixed separately with microtubules ( 50 μ l final volume ) , incubated at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged at 100 , 000x g for 40 min at room temperature on top of a 100 μ l of cushion buffer supplemented with taxol . All supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE as described above . Whole - worm immunoprecipitation assay Worms ( 9cm plates x 10 ) were collected and washed with M9 buffer . The worm pellet was lysed by French Press in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μ g / ml Pepstatin - A and 10 mM NaF ) con - taining protease - inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . The lysates were incubated at 4°C for 30 min and centrifugated at 13 , 000xg for 30min . Then , supernatant was incubated with 80 μ l Protein A + G Agarose ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) for 1h at 4°C to pre - clear non - specific bead - protein interactions . 2 μ l anti - GFP antibody ( ab290 ) was added into pre - cleared superna - tant and incubated at 4°C overnight , followed by incubation with 80 μ l Protein A + G Agarose ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) at 4°C for 4 hours . Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblotting using anti - actin and anti - GFP polyclonal antibodies . Plasmids and transgenic strains rab - 10 ( Q68L ) cDNA clones were transferred into an in - house modified vector pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) with 2xHA epitope tag and Gateway cassette ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) for in vitro transcription / translation experiments . For actin binding experiments an equiv - alent ehbp - 1 ( 260 - 510aa ) , ehbp - 1 ( 1 - 510aa ) , ehbp - 1 ( 260 - 901aa ) and hUtrophin ( 1 - 261aa ) PCR EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 19 / 28 product was introduced in frame into vector pGEX - 2T ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Piscat - away , NJ ) modified with a Gateway cassette . To construct GFP or RFP fusion transgenes for expression specifically in the worm intestine , a previously described vha - 6 promoter - driven vector modified with a Gateway cassette inserted just upstream of the GFP or red fluorescent protein ( tagRFP - T ) coding region was used . The sequences of C . elegans ehbp - 1 ( cDNA ) , ehbp - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) , ehbp - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) ( RRLRR6AALAA ) , ehbp - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) ( RR6AA ) , ehbp - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) ( RR9AA ) , ehbp - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) ( KK13AA ) , ehbp - 1 ( aa1 - 223 ) ( HRRRK46AAAAA ) , ehbp - 1 ( 260 - 510aa ) , ehbp - 1 ( 260 - 901aa ) and ehbp - 1 ( 1 - 259aa , 511 - 901aa ) lacking a stop codon were cloned individually into entry vector pDONR221 by PCR and BP reaction , and then transferred into intestinal expression vectors by Gateway recombi - nation cloning LR reaction to generate C - terminal fusions [ 6 ] . Integrated transgenic lines for all these plasmids were obtained by microinjection or microparticle bombardment . Drug interference assay Nocodazole ( 50 μ g / mL , M1404 ) ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) or Latrunculin B ( 10 μ M , sc - 203318 ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnologies , Dallas , TX ) was injected into the pseudocoelom of young adult worms 2 h before imaging . Drugs were diluted in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 1 % DMSO in egg buffer [ 118 mM NaCl , 48 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) ] . Confocal microscopy and imaging analysis Live worms were mounted on 2 % agarose pads with 10 mM levamisole . Multi - wavelength fluo - rescence images were obtained using an FLUOVIEW FV1000 microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) and captured using FV10 - ASW Ver . 3 . 1 software . Images taken in the DAPI channel were used to identify broad - spectrum intestinal autofluorescence caused by lipofuscin - positive lysosome - like organelles . Fluorescence images were obtained using an FV1000 - IX81 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a 60×N . A . 1 . 2 oil - immer - sion objective . Z series of optical sections were acquired using a 0 . 5 μ m step size . Dynamic fluorescence imaging was performed on a spinning - disk confocal imaging system ( CSU - X1 ) ( Yokogawa , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with an EM CCD camera ( iXon DU897K ) ( ANDOR , Belfast , UK ) ) and oil - immersion objectives ( 60×N . A . 1 . 45 ) . A 50 mW solid state lasers ( 491 nm ) coupled to an acoustic - optical tunable filter ( AOTF ) were used to excite GFP . hTAC - GFP labeled endosomes dynamic images were obtained over 180 – 240 sec with an expo - sure every 1 sec . To compare the subcellular distribution of GFP - tagged proteins , fluorescence data from GFP channel were analyzed by Metamorph software version 7 . 8 . 0 . 0 ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , PA ) . The “ Integrated Morphometry Analysis ” function of Metamorph was used to detect the fluorescent structures that are significantly brighter than the background and to measure total puncta number ( referred as “ structure count ” ) and total fluorescence area ( referred as “ total area ” ) within unit regions . From total 6 animals of each genotype , “ structure count ” and “ total area ” were sampled in three different unit regions of each intestine defined by a 100 x 100 ( pixel 2 ) box positioned at random ( n = 18 each ) . In most cases , “ total area ” was used to compare tubularity , as the normal endosomal tubule network covers much more area than when the network collapses into puncta . Another parameter “ structure count ” was also sometimes used to assay this aspect , where the structure count increases as the network breaks down into puncta . GFP and RFP - tagged proteins colocalization analysis were performed using “ Measure colo - calization ” App of Metamorph software . After thresholding , the percentage of GFP EHBP - 1 in Endocytic Recycling PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006093 June 6 , 2016 20 / 28 fluorescence area ( area A ) overlapping with RFP fluorescence area ( area B ) in eighteen intesti - nal unit regions ( 3 regions per animal ) was analyzed for each genotype . Most GFP / RFP coloca - lization experiments were performed on L3 and L4 larvae expressing GFP and RFP markers . To establish a quantitative index for the vacuole phenotype , total vacuole number and size were quantified in three intestinal cells of 6 ehbp - 1 ( tm2523 ) mutant or rescue animals ( n = 18 per genotype ) using endosome visualization marker ARF - 6 - RFP . Vacuoles were classified into 3 different size groups : small vacuole ( diameter < 5 μ m ) , medium vacuole ( diameter 5 – 10 μ m ) and large vacuole ( diameter > 10 μ m ) .
