EPEC adheres to epithelial cells and induces the formation of actin pedestals . Actin polymerization is driven fundamentally through signaling mediated by Tir bacterial effector protein , which inserts in the plasma membrane of the infected cell . Tir binds Nck adaptor proteins , which in turn recruit and activate N - WASP , a ubiquitous member of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome family of proteins . N - WASP activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to promote actin polymerization . Other proteins aside from components of the Tir - Nck - N - WASP pathway are recruited to the pedestals but their functions are unknown . Here we investigate the function of two alternatively spliced isoforms of Crk adaptors ( CrkI / II ) and the paralog protein CrkL during pedestal formation by EPEC . We found that the Crk isoforms act as redundant inhibitors of pedestal formation . The SH2 domain of CrkII and CrkL binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 474 of Tir and competes with Nck to bind Tir , preventing its recruitment to pedestals and thereby inhibiting actin polymerization . EPEC infection induces phosphorylation of the major regulatory tyrosine in CrkII and CrkL , possibly preventing the SH2 domain of these proteins from interacting with Tir . Phosphorylated CrkII and CrkL proteins localize specifically to the plasma membrane in contact with EPEC . Our study uncovers a novel role for Crk adaptors at pedestals , opening a new perspective in how these oncoproteins regulate actin polymerization .

Introduction Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) causes infant diarrhea worldwide and is a leading cause of death in developing countries . EPEC adheres to intestinal epithelial cells , causing local disappearance of microvilli and altering cell permeability , giving rise to what are classically known as attaching and effacing ( A / E ) lesions [ 1 ] . At A / E lesions , EPEC attaches to host cells and induces the formation of actin - rich structures called pedestals . Although the ultimate function of pedestals is not completely understood , disrupting genes critical for pedestal formation diminishes colonization and subsequent disease in humans [ 2 ] and animal models [ 3 ] . Pedestals may facilitate EPEC growth and residence inside the intestine by allowing the bacteria to remain attached to the epithelium during peristalsis and host responses to infection [ 4 ] . EPEC uses a type III secretion system to deliver effectors into host cells . One such effector is the translocated intimin receptor , Tir , which drives the major pathway responsible for regulating actin polymerization . Upon injection into the cell cytoplasm , Tir inserts in the plasma membrane , exposing a loop on the cell surface , which in turn binds another bacterial protein , the adhesin intimin [ 5 ] . This binding is accompanied by the clustering of Tir and by its phosphorylation on Tyr474 within the C - terminal cytoplasmic domain . This regulatory phosphotyrosine recruits the host cell adaptor protein non - catalytic tyrosine kinase Nck , which in turn recruits N - WASP [ 6 ] . Recruitment and activation of N - WASP [ 7 ] and of other actin - nucleating proteins such as cortactin [ 8 , 9 ] leads to Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization . Pedestals act as a ‘‘molecular niche’’ to recruit not only actin machinery but many other proteins as well . These proteins include those normally localized to focal adhesions , such as vinculin and talin [ 10 ] , cell cortex proteins such as ezrin [ 11 ] and adaptor proteins such as CT10 regulator of kinase ( Crk ) proteins [ 12 ] . Several excellent reviews have recently been written about EPEC signaling [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] . The first member of the Crk adaptor family to be discovered was v - Crk , a chicken tumor viral oncoprotein that increases tyrosine phosphorylation in cells [ 16 ] . The cellular counterpart of v - Crk is CrkII , a proto - oncoprotein that contains an N - terminal PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 1 March 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 3 | e1004022 Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain , referred to as SH2 , and two Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains , termed N - terminal and C - terminal ( referred to as nSH3 and cSH3 respectively ) . The SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine motifs [ 17 ] , and the nSH3 domain binds specific proline - rich motives ( for recent reviews see [ 18 , 19 ] ) . The cSH3 domain , in contrast , does not bind proline - rich motifs and exerts regulatory activity , mainly in CrkII [ 20 ] . The Crk gene gives rise to another splice isoform , CrkI , which lacks a cSH3 domain . In addition , a Crk - like gene called CrkL , which maps to a different chromosome , gives rise to an adaptor highly homologous to CrkII [ 21 ] . Similar to other adaptor proteins , Crk functions primarily to assemble molecular complexes to distribute signals within the cell [ 22 ] . The best studied regulatory mechanism of Crk proteins is the phosphorylation at a tyrosine located in a linker between the N - and C - terminal SH3 domains ( Tyr221 in human CrkII , Tyr207 in human CrkL ) . This tyrosine phosphorylation , carried out mainly by Abl kinase [ 23 , 24 ] , results in an intramolecular interaction between the phosphotyrosine and the SH2 domain of the protein [ 25 ] . This interaction favors a conformation that buries the nSH3 domain in CrkII but not in CrkL [ 26 ] . In addition to participating in traditionally well - studied processes like cell migration and adhesion [ 27 ] , Crk adaptors have recently been found to promote apoptosis during endoplas - mic reticulum stress [ 28 ] and to regulate the immunological synapse [ 29 ] . Crk adaptors have been implicated in many types of human cancer [ 30 ] and in embryonic development in studies involving CrkI / II [ 31 ] and CrkL known - down mice [ 32 ] . The latter mice are a model of human DiGeorge syndrome , in which congenital heart disease and immune deficiency are frequently present . CrkII contributes to bacterial invasion of epithelial cells by Shigella [ 33 ] and Salmonella [ 34 ] , and it is a target of virulence factors . These findings , together with the report that CrkII localizes to EPEC pedestals [ 12 ] , led us to hypothesize that it may play a role in EPEC infection . Here we investigated the function of Crk adaptors during EPEC pedestal formation . Results Effect of siRNA - induced inhibition of CrkI / II and CrkL expression on EPEC pedestal formation Crk is an important adaptor molecule that participates in diverse signaling pathways and that localizes to EPEC pedestals [ 12 ] . To assess the role of Crk adaptors during EPEC pedestal formation , we knocked - down the expression of all Crk isoforms in HeLa cells using commercially available oligonucleotides specific for CrkI / II and L ( Fig . 1 ) . In Fig . 1A we show a schematic representation of the Crk adaptor family . In HeLa cells , endogenous CrkII and CrkL were readily detected , whereas CrkI was expressed at nearly undetectable levels ( Fig . 1B ) , consistent with previous work [ 35 ] . At 20 h after siRNA transfection , CrkII and CrkL levels were reduced by 73 % and 67 % ( average of three experiments after normalizing for tubulin ) , as quantified by western blotting ( WB , Fig . 1C ) . At that time point , we infected the cells with EPEC and allowed pedestal formation . Fig . 1D shows immunofluorescence staining of polymerized actin with TRITC - phalloidin and of bacteria with DAPI . The number of pedestals was significantly higher in cells treated with anti - Crk siRNAs than in cells treated with control siRNA in three different experiments ( Fig . 1E ) . This unexpected result indicates that simultaneous down - regulation of CrkI / II and CrkL expression potentiates pedestal formation by EPEC . However , down - regula - tion of either CrkII or CrkL on its own did not significantly affect pedestal numbers ( Fig . S1 ) , suggesting that Crk isoforms act redundantly to inhibit pedestal formation . We cannot exclude the possibility that this negative result is due to the fact that our system inhibited CrkII or CrkL expression by only 76 % and 53 % , respectively . Effect of expression of Crk mutants on pedestal formation To gain further insights in the way Crk adaptors participate in pedestal formation , we performed experiments in HeLa cells transfected with a Myc - tagged dominant - negative CrkII mutant carrying an R38V mutation in the SH2 domain ( Fig . 2 ) . This Arg is invariant in SH2 domains and is essential for recognizing phosphotyrosine . Mutating it abolishes Crk interaction with binding partners [ 36 ] . As a control , we used wild - type ( WT ) Myc - CrkII . Fig . 2A shows that WT CrkII and R38V mutant were expressed in transfected cells at similar levels , as assessed by WB using an anti - Myc monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) . Fig . 2B shows immunofluorescence staining of HeLa cells transfected with WT or R38V CrkII constructs and infected with EPEC . As a negative control , cells were treated with transfection reagent only ( data not shown ) . We used anti - Myc MoAb followed by anti - mouse Alexa 488 secondary antibody ( Ab ) to visualize Myc - tagged Crk constructs in green , TRITC - phalloidin to label pedestals in red , and DAPI to label EPEC in blue . In agreement with the previously described localization of endogenous CrkII protein [ 12 ] , the transfected Myc - tagged WT CrkII localized to pedestals , while the R38V CrkII mutant did not . Fig . 2C shows that the number of pedestals did not differ among the groups in three different experiments . These results indicate that neither overexpression of WT CrkII nor inhibition of endogenous CrkII using a dominant - negative mutant significantly affects pedestal formation . The results also indicate that localization of Crk proteins to pedestals is mediated mainly by their SH2 domain . Expression of the isolated SH2 domain of Nck1 / 2 inhibits pedestal formation [ 6 ] . Therefore we investigated whether we could also inhibit pedestal formation by expressing the isolated SH2 domain of CrkII . We transfected cells with a plasmid encoding the SH2 domain of CrkII fused to GFP ( referred as to SH2 - GFP ) or with empty GFP vector ( GFP ) as a negative control , and we quantified the number of pedestals ( Fig . 3 ) . Fig . 3A shows that both constructs were expressed in transfected cells , as assessed by WB using an anti - GFP polyclonal Ab . Fig . 3B shows fluorescence staining of HeLa cells transfected with GFP or Author Summary Infections by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are an important cause of diarrhea linked to high infant mortality . Such bacteria attach to cells and form actin - rich structures called pedestals , which contain many proteins that play unknown functions during pedestal formation . Here we studied two nearly identical forms ( isoforms ) of Crk adaptor proteins , CrkII and CrkL , during pedestal forma - tion . Eliminating both isoforms from the cell enhanced pedestal formation , while eliminating only one did not , implying that the isoforms are redundant inhibitors of pedestal formation . We also found that Crk proteins bind the bacterial protein Tir , which binds another adaptor , Nck , to promote actin polymerization in pedestals . We propose that Crk adaptor proteins inhibit actin polymerization by competing with Nck binding to Tir . This work opens the door to investigating how Crk adaptor proteins may participate in numerous actin polymerization pathways .

To probe further whether the SH2 domain of CrkII and CrkL inhibit pedestal formation , we took advantage of the fact that the binding ability of this domain depends on phosphorylation of tyrosines 221 and 207 , respectively . This tyrosine phosphorylation allows the intramolecular interaction between the phosphotyrosine and the SH2 domain . HeLa cells were transfected with constructs expressing phosphorylation deficient Myc - tagged CrkII - Y221F or untagged CrkL - Y207F constructs and infected with EPEC ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Control cells were transfected with empty Myc vector or were treated only with the transfection reagent ( mock conditions ) . Expression of the constructs was verified by WB and the number of pedestals obtained with each construct was quantified by immunofluorescence ( data not shown ) . We found that both mutants inhibited pedestal formation significantly ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Together these results indicate that the SH2 domain mediates the ability of Crk adaptors to inhibit pedestal formation , although we cannot exclude that other adaptor domains also contribute . Given that the SH2 domain of CrkII inhibits pedestal formation , we wondered whether it interferes with Nck recruitment to pedestals ( Fig . 3F – H ) . We tested this hypothesis using Nck1 / 2 - deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) because these cells allow pedestal formation mainly when reconstituted with Nck1 or Nck2 [ 6 ] , because there is a secondary Tir - dependent and Nck - independent pathway to actin [ 37 ] . Therefore we co - transfected Nck1 / 2 - deficient MEFs with both Flag - tagged Full - Length Nck2 and either GFP alone ( Flag - Nck2 + GFP ) or SH2 - GFP CrkII ( Flag - Nck2 + SH2 - GFP ) ; expression of all constructs was confirmed by WB ( Fig . 3F ) . Immunofluores - cence staining was performed using anti - Flag MoAb , followed by Alexa 568 - conjugated anti - mouse goat Ab ( in red ) and Alexa 350 Phalloidin ( in blue ) ; GFP was visualized in green ( Fig . 3G ) . We determined the number of co - transfected cells that were positive for Flag staining at pedestals ; this number was significantly lower in cells expressing both Flag - Nck2 and SH2 - GFP than in cells expressing Nck2 and GFP alone ( Fig . 3H ) . In addition , Nck2 staining in these cells was concentrated in the cell cytoplasm and relatively delocalized from pedestals , whereas it was highly localized to pedestals in control cells ( Fig . 3 , S5 ) . Together these results suggest that Crk isoforms may inhibit pedestal formation by blocking Nck recruitment to pedestals . Figure 2 .

S1 and 2 , we performed EPEC infection experiments using CrkI / II and CrkL - deficient MEFs ( CrkI / II - / - , CrkL - / - ; Fig . S2 ) . In addition , we tried to distinguish between CrkI and CrkII contributions by transfecting CrkI / II - / - MEFs with WT Myc - CrkII to reconstitute CrkII expression ; the resulting cells were referred to as Rescued CrkII ( R CrkII ) . The number of pedestals did not significantly differ among WT , CrkI / II - / - , CrkL - / - or Rescued MEFs ( Fig . S2C , E ) , confirming the results obtained with HeLa cells ( Figs . S1 ) . While the results of the experiments in Figs . S1 and S2 are consistent with the idea that CrkI / II and CrkL are involved in pedestal formation , they do not provide direct evidence of such involvement , since CrkL may be compensating for down - regulation or loss of CrkI / II and vice versa . To test for the involvement of CrkI / II and CrkL more directly , we used siRNA to inhibit the expression of CrkL in CrkI / II - deficient MEFs and then we infected the cells with EPEC ( Fig . 4 ) . The expression levels of CrkL were reduced by 60 % , as quantified by WB . To control for possible differences in infection , we confirmed that the levels of Tir translocated by EPEC were similar under the different treatment conditions ( Fig . 4A , data not shown ) . We stained the cells for actin using TRITC - phalloidin . To stain for EPEC , we chose not to use DAPI in order to avoid overexposure of cell nuclei ; instead , we used a mouse anti - E . coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) MoAb followed by an Alexa 405 - conjugated anti - mouse secondary Ab ( blue ; Fig . 4B ) . We found that cells expressing none of the three Crk isoforms formed significantly more pedestals than did WT cells ( Fig . 4C ) . These results were confirmed using a second siRNA oligonucleotide to inhibit CrkL expression in CrkI / II - deficient MEFs ( Fig . S3A – C ) . To evaluate whether the observed increase in pedestal number reflected a direct effect on actin polymerization and not to an improvement in bacterial adhesion , we quantified the fraction of bacteria that generated pedestals in CrkI / II - deficient MEFs depleted in CrkL by siRNA ( Fig . 4C ) . We found that cells depleted of CrkI , CrkII and CrkL showed a higher ratio of pedestals to bacteria than did their WT counterparts , indicating more efficient pedestal formation . This supports the idea that depleting Crk isoforms favors actin polymerization in pedestals . To further confirm the results obtained in CrkI / II - deficient cells in which CrkL was depleted by siRNA with two oligonucleotides ( Figs . 4 and S3A – C ) , we expressed the dominant negative R38V CrkII mutant in CrkI / II - deficient MEFs ( Fig . S3D ) . These cells formed a significantly greater number of pedestals than did WT and CrkI / II - deficient MEFs transfected with Myc alone ( Fig . S3E ) . Next we used siRNA to inhibit the expression of CrkI / II in CrkL - deficient MEFs after which the cells were infected with EPEC ( Fig . 5 ) . The expression levels of CrkI / II were reduced by 50 % . As a control for possible differences in infection , we confirmed that the levels of injected Tir were similar under the different treatment conditions ( Fig . 5A ) . We stained the cells to determine the number of pedestal formed after infections . Although the siRNA treatment reduced CrkI / II expression only by 50 % , CrkL - deficient MEFs treated by siRNA formed significantly more pedestals than did WT cells ( Fig . 5B , C ) . We confirmed these results using a second siRNA oligonucleotide to inhibit CrkI / II expression in MEFs deficient in CrkL ( data not shown ) . Taken together , the results of these siRNA experiments in MEFs deficient in CrkI / II and CrkL suggest that Crk isoforms inhibit pedestal formation redundantly , with one isoform able to compensate for the absence of others . In light of this redundant inhibition of pedestal formation , we wondered whether MEFs deficient in CrkI / II or CrkL might constitutively upregulate the remaining Crk isoform . To address this question , we prepared lysates from MEFs deficient in either CrkI / II or CrkL , and we blotted them with anti - CrkI / II and CrkL Abs simultaneously using the Odyssey Scan system ( Fig . S4A , C ) . To our surprise , MEFs deficient in CrkI / II or CrkL expressed significantly higher basal levels of the remaining isoform ( Fig . S4B , D ) . To our knowledge , this is the first such analysis of CrkI / II or CrkL - deficient cells , and the findings may explain why the numbers of pedestals formed by EPEC in cells expressing at least one Crk isoform did not significantly vary in our experiments ( Figs . 2 , 4 , and Figs . S1 and S2 ) . EPEC pedestal formation induces Crk adaptor phosphorylation EPEC attachment to cells promotes the redundant activation of tyrosine kinases , including Src family kinase c - Fyn [ 38 ] and Abl / Arg [ 39 ] . Since Abl is the major kinase regulating the Crk adaptor family [ 23 ] , we wondered whether EPEC attachment to cells induces Crk phosphorylation on the major regulatory tyrosines , which would allow them to interact intramolecularly with the SH2 domain ( Fig . 1A ) . We performed EPEC infections of HeLa cells for 1 , 2 and 3 h at two multiplicities of infection ( MOIs ) , and analyzed the phosphorylation status of Tyr221 in CrkII and Tyr207 in CrkL using commercially available phosphospecific Abs ( Fig . 6 and data not shown ) . Because the signal was weaker for phospho - CrkII than for phospho - CrkL we performed immuno - precipitations of total CrkII , and blotted them with anti - phophoY221 - CrkII Ab . PhosphoY207 - CrkL was detected directly by WB . In order to improve our ability to detect signal induction , cells were starved overnight in serum - free medium prior to infection , and the basal level was visualized in uninfected cells Figure 3 .

The phosphospecific signal was quantified by normalizing it to the signal of the corresponding non - phosphor - ylated protein ( Fig . 6B and D ) . EPEC infection induced a significant increase in CrkII - Tyr221 and CrkL - Tyr207 phosphor - ylation that peaked at 2 h of infection and decayed thereafter at an MOI of 45 ( Fig . 6A – D ) while the levels peaked at 3 h at a lower MOI of 3 ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that EPEC induces transient phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkL adaptors at the major regulatory tyrosines 221 and 207 , respectively . Maximal phosphorylation correlates with MOI . Recruitment of phosphorylated Crk adaptors to pedestals Although a previous study has localized Crk adaptors to pedestals [ 12 ] , whether the corresponding phosphorylated adap - tors are recruited to EPEC pedestals is unknown . To address this question , we performed confocal immunofluorescence experi - ments to visualize phospho - Crk adaptors in EPEC pedestals at 3 hours of infection ( Fig . 6 ) . For staining , we used the phosphospecific anti - pY221 Ab followed by anti - rabbit Alexa 488 - conjugated secondary Ab ( green ) , while actin was visualized Figure 4 .

The number of pedestals was quantified based on counts with 100 cells . The ratio of pedestals to bacteria was quantified by counting the number of adhered bacteria with or without pedestals on 50 cells ; the resulting ratio was expressed as a percentage .

Pictures were taken on a confocal microscope and merged using the manufacturer’s software . The merge of the three images clearly shows that phospho - CrkII does not localize along the entire length of the pedestal but rather to a thin layer restricted to the region of plasma membrane in contact with the bacteria . We next stained for pTyr207 - CrkL as described above and found its localization to be similar to that of phospho - CrkII ( Fig . 6E ) . Similar results were obtained in immunofluorescence experiments performed at 2 hours of infection ( data not shown ) . In addition , we performed immunofluorescence experiments to visualize phospho - Crk proteins and bacteria as a control ( data not shown ) . Taken together , the immunofluorescence results show that phosphorylated CrkII and CrkL localize to pedestals , where they are specifically enriched at thin areas near the plasma membrane in contact with EPEC rather than along the entire pedestal stalk .

Since Crk adaptors also have an SH2 domain , we wondered whether they bind Tir in a similar manner as Nck and whether this might help explain how Crk adaptors inhibit EPEC pedestal formation . We expressed and purified all three SH2 domains as GST fusion proteins , as verified using Coomassie blue staining ( Fig . 7 ) . We then performed pull - down assays using the isolated SH2 domains of CrkII and CrkL and lysates of HeLa cells infected by EPEC for different periods . The SH2 domain of Nck was used as a positive control for Tir interaction , and the isolated GST protein as a negative control . Membranes were blotted with an anti - Tir MoAb ( Fig . 7A ) . The results show that the SH2 domain of CrkII and CrkL efficiently pulls down Tir , to a similar degree as the SH2 domain of Nck . SH2 domains bind proteins in a phosphotyrosine - dependent manner [ 18 ] . To confirm that the Tir molecules pulled - down by the SH2 domains of CrkII or CrkL were tyrosine - phosphorylated as expected , we performed pull - down experiments in which we simultaneously detected Tir and its corresponding tyrosine phosphorylation using an anti - Tir polyclonal Ab and a generic anti - phosphotyrosine MoAb respectively . The merge of Tir and phosphotyrosine WB images ( Fig . 7B ) shows that Tir molecules pulled - down by the SH2 domain of CrkII or CrkL were indeed tyrosine - phosphorylated . As previously mentioned , the Nck SH2 domain specifically binds Tir through its phosphotyrosine 474 [ 6 ] . Therefore we sought to establish whether the SH2 domains of CrkII or CrkL bind Tir at the same phosphotyrosine ( Fig . 7C ) , which would explain the competition we observed . To this end , we infected HeLa cells for 2 h with an EPEC strain that lacks Tir ( D tir EPEC mutant ) . The D tir EPEC was complemented with a low - copy - number plasmid that expresses Tir carrying a Tyr474Phe substitution that cannot be phosphorylated ( p tir Y474F ) . As controls , we infected cells with the D tir EPEC mutant comple - mented with WT Tir plasmid ( p tir ) , and we infected cells with WT EPEC or we left cells uninfected . Cell lysates were subjected to pull - down assays using the isolated SH2 domain of CrkII , CrkL or Nck . WB analysis with anti - Tir MoAb revealed that the SH2 domain of CrkII or CrkL did not pull - down the Y474F Tir mutant . In contrast , they efficiently pulled down Tir when HeLa cells were infected with the D tir + p tir combination or with WT EPEC . The findings in Fig . 7A – C suggest that CrkII and CrkL can bind Tir through its phosphorylated Tyr474 during EPEC infection and therefore compete with Nck for binding Tir . To further characterize the Tir - Crk complexes , we performed competitive pull - down experiments ( Fig . 7D ) . We added increas - ing amounts of purified recombinant CrkII SH2 domain ( SH2 - CrkII , Fig . 7D Coomassie ) to lysates from EPEC - infected HeLa cells . Pull - downs were analyzed by blotting sequentially with anti - Tir and anti - GST MoAbs . We found that the presence of recombinant CrkII SH2 domain in the lysates blocked the binding of Nck SH2 domain to Tir in a concentration - dependent manner . These results provide further evidence that the SH2 domains of Crk and Nck compete for binding to Tir . Discussion Numerous pathogens have evolved mechanisms to subvert host control of actin polymerization for their own benefit . EPEC manipulates the host actin cytoskeleton from outside the cell , making it a powerful model system to study eukaryotic phosphotyr - osine signaling events in response to external stimuli [ 40 ] . Several host cell proteins implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling , including Crk adaptor proteins , are recruited to the site of EPEC attachment [ 12 ] . In the present study we aimed to investigate a possible role of Crk adaptors in pedestal formation by EPEC . We inhibited CrkI / II and CrkL expression using siRNA in HeLa cells and then infected them with EPEC . We found that cells expressing reduced CrkI / II and CrkL formed increased numbers of pedestals than their control counterpart cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Next we used a complementary strategy ( Fig . 2 ) in which we transfected a dominant - negative Crk mutant with an R38V mutation in the SH2 domain [ 36 ] , previously shown to inhibit Shigella infection [ 41 ] . In parallel we overexpressed the WT CrkII isoform . We found that overexpression of WT or R38V protein did not alter the number of pedestals formed in HeLa cells . In addition , while the WT protein localized to pedestals , the R38V mutant did not . To verify our results more rigorously , we measured the numbers of pedestals formed by EPEC infection of MEFs that were already deficient in CrkI / II or CrkL and in which expression of the remaining Crk isoform was suppressed using siRNA . The number of pedestals in these cells was significantly higher , than the number in control cells ( Fig . 4 , 5 and S3 ) . This increase was due to more efficient pedestal formation ( Fig . 4C ) . Pedestal number was also significantly higher in CrkI / II - deficient cells expressing the dominant - negative CrkII R38V mutant than in control cells ( Fig . S3D , E ) . The results obtained with cells deficient in CrkI / II and CrkL was consistent with redundancy among Crk adaptors as suggested in other studies [ 22 , 42 ] . Whereas these cell culture studies suggest similar ability of CrkI / II and CrkL to compensate for the absence of the other isoform , deletion of only CrkI / II [ 31 ] or CrkL [ 32 ] in mice is embryonically lethal . Thus , although CrkI / II and CrkL play overlapping roles , they may not be entirely functionally equivalent in vivo . Remarkably , we found that MEFs deficient in CrkI / II or CrkL upregulate the level of the remaining Crk isoform in a compensatory manner ( Fig . S4 ) . This is , to our knowledge , the first time Crk isoform expression has been measured in these cells , and the discovery was made possible with the help of a system which uses different colors to detect both isoforms simultaneously and unambiguously . One of the major mechanisms regulating Crk adaptor proteins is phosphorylation of Tyr221 in CrkII and Tyr207 in CrkL in the linker region ; this regulatory tyrosine is absent in CrkI . Phosphor - ylation of these tyrosines promotes their interaction with the SH2 domain in the same molecule , preventing the domain from binding other phosphotyrosines [ 25 , 26 ] . These regulatory tyro - sines are phosphorylated primarily by Abl kinase , which is activated upon EPEC infection [ 39 ] . For that reason we analyzed whether EPEC infection promotes phosphorylation of Crk adaptor proteins on these regulatory tyrosines . Indeed , we found that EPEC induced progressive phosphorylation of CrkII - Tyr221 and CrkL - Tyr207 that peaked at 2 h of infection in our experimental conditions ( Fig . 6 ) . Interestingly , the phospho - Crk proteins localized specifically to a thin interface between EPEC and pedestal rather than along the entire pedestal stalk ( Figs . 6E ) . This is similar to the distribution of Abl kinase [ 39 , 43 ] consistent with the idea that Abl phosphorylates Crk adaptors . A remarkable finding in this study is that overexpression of the isolated SH2 domain of CrkII in HeLa cells let to a significant decrease in pedestal number ( Fig . 3 ) , just as overexpressing the SH2 domain of Nck , which binds to phosphorylated Tyr474 of Tir , inhibits pedestal formation by EPEC [ 6 ] . The SH2 domain of CrkII probably inhibits pedestal formation by interfering with Nck recruitment to Tir ( Fig . 3 ) , possibly because the SH2 domain of CrkII and CrkL adaptors interacts with Tir ( Fig . 7A ) . This interaction is not observed with Tir carrying a Tyr474Phe mutation , suggesting that it occurs through the phosphorylated Tyr474 of Tir ( Fig . 7B , C ) . In support of this idea , CrkII is not recruited to Crk Function in EPEC Pedestals PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 10 March 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 3 | e1004022 Figure 7 . The SH2 domains of CrkII and CrkL compete with Nck to bind Tir at its phosphorylated tyrosine 474 . For pull - down experiments , total cell lysates were mixed with the following GST fusion proteins : GST alone , GST - SH2 - Nck , GST - SH2 - CrkII or GST - SH2 - CrkL . As a control , 1 : 20 of the total amount of cell lysate used for each pull - down assay was analyzed ( Lys ) . The GST fusion proteins used in the pull - down assays were analyzed by Coomassie blue staining ; the amounts were 1 : 20 the amounts used in the pull - down experiments . These experiments were performed at least three times . ( A ) HeLa cells were left uninfected ( - EPEC ) or infected with preactivated EPEC for 1 or 2 h at an MOI of 180 . Pull - down experiments were analyzed by WB using an anti - Tir MoAb . ( B ) HeLa cells were left uninfected ( - EPEC ) or infected with preactivated EPEC for 2 h at an Crk Function in EPEC Pedestals PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 11 March 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 3 | e1004022 pedestals when the strain of EPEC expresses Tyr474Phe mutant Tir [ 12 ] . Since the SH2 domain of Grb2 adaptor does not bind Tir [ 37 ] , not all SH2 - containing proteins interact with phosphorylated Tir , suggesting that Crk binding to Tir reflects a specific regulatory event . Indeed , we competitively blocked the binding of Nck SH2 domain to Tir using recombinant CrkII SH2 domain . Taken together , these findings lead us to speculate that by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine 474 in Tir , Crk adaptors inhibit Nck recruitment and consequently actin polymerization . At the same time , our findings show that Crk adaptors cannot substitute for Nck in promoting actin polymerization at pedestals . This is in agreement with the fact that Nck1 / 2 - deficient cells expressing CrkII and CrkL do not form pedestals [ 6 ] . This highlights the many questions that remain regarding the factors regulating actin polymerization at pedestals . For example , it is not known whether recombinant Crk SH3 domain promotes N - WASP activation and Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization in vitro , similarly to other SH3 containing proteins . In addition , there is an Nck - independent pathway to actin polymerization that can be detected when the major Nck pathway is blocked [ 37 ] ; indeed in vivo studies show that EPEC can use a variety of adhesion mechanisms that can compensate for the lack of Nck [ 44 ] . Based on the present study and previous work , we propose a model in which Crk and Nck adaptors compete for Tir binding in a stochastic fashion ( Fig . 8 ) . Tir clustering in the plasma membrane induces its phosphorylation on Tyr474 , creating a docking site for the SH2 domain of Nck . Nck binding initiates the major Tir - Nck - N - WASP pathway to promote Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization [ 6 ] , whereas binding by any one of the Crk isoforms inhibits Nck binding and therefore actin polymerization . This model can explain the significantly higher number of pedestals formed in the absence of all three Crk isoforms ( Fig . 1 , 4 , 5 , S3 ) . It can also explain why during early infection , few Crk proteins are phosphorylated ( Fig . 6 ) and so most should be available to compete with Nck for binding to Tir ( Fig . 3 and 7 ) . The model predicts that during later stages of infection , Abl can phosphorylate Crk adaptors and Tir , reducing the competition and promoting actin polymerization at pedestals . Consistent with this idea , preliminary studies show that anti - phospho - CrkL immunoprecipitates do not contain phospho - Tir ( data not shown ) . This model is consistent with the proposal that SH2 - containing proteins bind transiently to phosphotyrosines in different target molecules ( ‘‘hopping from binding site to binding site’’ ) when these residues are present in high concentrations at the plasma membrane [ 45 ] . Such concentrations are likely to be present during EPEC infection after Tir has been phosphorylated . Our data are in agreement with this dynamic view of signaling involving proteins containing phosphotyrosines and SH2 domains .

Cells were washed once with cold Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( D - PBS ) with calcium and magnesium ( Invitrogen ) and scraped into 200 – 300 m l 2 6 Laemmli buffer . Samples were homogenized by 3 passages through a syringe with a 25 - gauge needle and centrifugation at 21 , 000 g for 15 min at 4 u C . Samples were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE and analyzed by WB using the primary and secondary Abs described above . Densitometry of bands was carried out using NIH Image J software ( Figs . S1 ) . For other figures , membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary Abs , then scanned with the Odyssey system using the red ( 700 nm ) and green ( 800 nm ) channels and quantitated with the Odyssey software . For infections , EPEC was preactivated by incubating a 1 : 100 dilution of an overnight culture for 2 h in IMDM supplemented with 10 % FBS without antibiotics at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . After the preactivation , the optical density of the suspension at 600 nm was adjusted to 0 . 2 . Cells were infected at the indicated multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) and allowed to form pedestals for the indicated time in IMDM supplemented with 10 % FBS without antibiotics . MOIs were adjusted to take into account that EPEC pedestal formation is less efficient on murine cells than on human cells ; and for practical reasons , considering the protocol to be performed .

The GST - fusion proteins were added to 150 m l of cell lysate from each condition and incubated for 5 h with tumbling at 4 u C . Pull - downs were washed four times with 200 m l lysis buffer diluted 1 : 10 in PBS as described [ 50 ] . For competitive pull - downs , the isolated SH2 domain of CrkII was excised from the GST - SH2 CrkII fusion protein coupled to GSH beads using the PreScission protease according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein Assay kit ( Biorad ) and adjusted to 0 . 5 mg / ml using PBS . The indicated amounts of soluble SH2 domain were added to 100 m l lysates from infected HeLa cells at an MOI of 15 . After adjusting the final volume to 200 m l with PBS , the lysates were incubated for 2 hours at 4 u C . Then , pull - downs were performed using GSH beads carrying the GST - tagged Nck2 SH2 domain ( 5 m g ) or GST alone ( 12 m g ) for 4 h at 4 u C with tumbling . Pull - downs were washed twice with 200 m l lysis buffer diluted 1 : 10 in PBS , reconstituted in 50 m l of 2 6 Laemmli sample buffer and 30 m l were loaded in a gel for WB analysis . Statistical methods Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software ( version 5 . 0 ) . Accession numbers for genes / proteins used in this study Tir ( EPEC ) .
