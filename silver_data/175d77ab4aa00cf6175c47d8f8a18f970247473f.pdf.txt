INTRODUCTION Talin is a cytoskeletal protein localised speciﬁcally in adherens - type junctions with the extracellular matrix ( Burridge and Connell , 1983 ; Geiger et al . , 1985 ) , although it is also found at points of cell contact between T - helper and antigen - presenting cells ( Kupfer et al . , 1987 ) . It is thought to be one of a number of interacting proteins which link the cytoplasmic domains of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed by Jockusch et al . , 1995 ) . The complete sequences of mouse ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) and D . discoideum ( Kreitmeier et al . , 1995 ) talin have been published , and the human gene has been assigned to chromosome 9p ( Gilmore et al . , 1995 ) . Mouse talin contains 2 , 541 amino acids with a M r of 269 , 854 . Comparison with the D . discoideum sequence ( 2 , 491 amino acids ) shows that the N - and C - terminal regions of the protein are conserved ( Kreit - meier et al . , 1995 ) . Calpain II cleaves chicken talin between residues 433 and 434 to produce a 47 kDa N - terminal fragment and a 190 kDa C - terminal fragment ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) . Microinjection studies indicate that the N - terminal fragment is important in targeting talin to cell - matrix junctions ( Nuckolls et al . , 1990 ) . This region of the protein can bind to charged lipids , and appears to contain a membrane binding domain ( Niggli et al . , 1994 ) . Residues 165 - 373 show homology with the ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) / band 4 . 1 family of cytosketal proteins ( Rees et al . , 1990 ; Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) , members of which also contain an N - terminal membrane - binding domain . The 190 kDa C - terminal polypeptide is composed of a large number of alanine - rich repeats of around 34 amino acids in length ( McLachlan et al . , 1994 ) . This region is reported to contain a binding site for the b 1 integrin cyto - plasmic domain ( Horwitz et al . , 1986 ) , and several binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin ( Lee et al . , 1992 ; Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) which overlap sequences required for targeting the protein to focal adhesions in cultured cells ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . Talin is also an actin - binding protein reported to possess nucleating activity , and able to enhance F - 2715 Journal of Cell Science 109 , 2715 - 2726 ( 1996 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1996 JCS4259 We have determined the sequence of chicken talin ( 2 , 541 amino acids , M r 271 , 881 ) which is very similar ( 89 % identity ) to that of the mouse protein . Alignments with the Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum talin sequences show that the N - and C - terminal regions of the protein are conserved whereas the central part of the molecule is more divergent . By expressing overlapping talin polypeptides as fusion proteins , we have identiﬁed at least three regions of the protein which can bind F - actin : residues 102 - 497 , 951 - 1 , 327 and 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 . The N - terminal binding site contains a region with homology to the ERM family of actin - binding proteins , and the C - terminal site is homologous to the yeast actin - binding protein Sla2p . Each of the actin - binding sites is close to , but distinct from a binding site for vinculin , a protein which also binds actin . The Pro1176 to Thr substitution found in talin from Wistar - Furth rats does not destroy the capacity of this region of the protein to bind actin or vinculin . Microinjection studies showed that a fusion protein con - taining the N - terminal actin - binding site localised weakly to stress ﬁbres , whereas one containing the C - terminal site initially localised predominantly to focal adhesions . The former was readily solubilised , and the latter was resistant to Triton extraction . The N - terminal talin polypeptide eventually disrupted actin stress ﬁbres whereas the C - terminal polypeptide was without effect . However , a larger C - terminal fusion protein also containing a vinculin - binding site did disrupt stress ﬁbres and focal adhesions . The results suggest that , although both the N - and C - terminal regions of talin bind actin , the properties of these two regions of the protein are distinct .

The actin - binding sites in talin have not been mapped , but the 190 kDa fragment can bind to F - actin , and talin residues 2 , 300 - 2 , 541 show homology to a yeast actin - binding protein Sla2p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Interestingly , talin has recently been reported to bind to residues close to the C terminus of pp125 focal adhesion kinase ( Chen et al . , 1995 ; M . L . Borowsky and R . O . Hynes , unpublished data ) , a region which also binds paxillin ( Hilde - brand et al . , 1995 ) . In D . discoideum , talin accumulates at the tips of ﬁlopodia formed in response to cAMP , consistent with the view that it plays a key role in linking actin to the membrane ( Kreitmeier et al . , 1995 ) . Talin is recruited to newly forming focal adhesions before vinculin ( DePasquale and Izzard , 1991 ) suggesting that it is involved in the early events leading to focal adhesion assembly . This conclusion is further supported by microinjection studies in which a polyclonal antibody to talin was found to inhibit both cell spreading and cell adhesion on ﬁbronectin ( Nuckolls et al . , 1992 ) . Down - regulation of talin in HeLa cells using antisense RNA also reduced the rate of cell spreading on ﬁbronectin ( Albiges - Rizo et al . , 1995 ) . In the present study , we report the complete sequence of chicken talin . Alignment of this sequence with that of C . elegans ( Moulder et al . , 1996 ) and D . discoideum ( Kreitmeier et al . , 1995 ) talin sequences point to a number of blocks of conserved residues which may help to identify binding sites for proteins which interact with talin . We demonstrate that one of these conserved regions ( residues 2 , 300 - 2 , 541 ) at the C - terminal end of the protein contains an F - actin binding site , although at least two other regions of the talin molecule also bind to F - actin . A second conserved region ( residues 1 , 929 - 2 , 029 ) contains one of the several vinculin - binding sites in talin ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) , each of which is adjacent to an actin - binding site . Finally , by microinjecting puriﬁed talin fusion proteins into chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts ( CEF ) , we provide evidence that the association between the N - and C - terminal regions of talin and the actin cytoskeleton show different characteristics . MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and sequencing of chicken talin cDNAs The strategy used to isolate cDNAs encoding the complete sequence of chicken talin have been described previously ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . cDNAs were subcloned into either M13 or pBluescript and sequenced on both strands using the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al . ( 1977 ) . The complete nucleotide sequence was compiled and sequence alignments conducted using the UWGCG suite of pro - grammes . Puriﬁcation of talin fusion proteins expressed in E . coli The chicken talin cDNAs expressed as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli have been described previ - ously ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . Fusion proteins were puriﬁed essentially as described by Smith and Johnson ( 1988 ) using glutathione coupled to agarose beads ( Sigma ) as an affinity matrix . The fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mM free glutathione . Concentrations of fusion proteins were determined using the Coomassie protein assay kit ( Pierce , Rockford , Ill , USA ) , and the purity of the proteins analysed by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) . Actin co - sedimentation assay A ﬁxed amount of rabbit muscle G - actin ( 20 m g ) and increasing amounts of the appropriate GST - talin fusion protein were mixed in a total volume of 100 m l of buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 02 % Triton X - 100 . Actin polymerisation was initiated by the addition of 100 mM NaCl , and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes . Samples were centrifuged both with and without actin at 75 , 000 rpm ( 100 , 000 g ) for 15 minutes . The supernatants were removed , the pellet washed carefully with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , and resuspended in 100 m l PBS . Proteins present in equal volumes of both the supernatant and pellet were resolved by SDS - PAGE , the gels stained with Coomassie blue and analysed using a Molecular Dynamics scanning laser densitometer by volume integra - tion . The ratio of the talin polypeptide : actin ( arbitrary units ) in the pellet was plotted against the concentration of the talin polypeptide added , and the binding affinity estimated from the concentration of talin polypeptide that produced 50 % of maximal binding . Binding of 125 I - vinculin to talin fusion proteins Vinculin was puriﬁed from chicken gizzard by the method of Evans et al ( 1984 ) , and 125 I - labelled with 0 . 5 mCi of Bolton and Hunter reagent to a speciﬁc activity of approximately 2 · 10 7 cpm per m g , as described previously ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . Puriﬁed talin fusion proteins ( 200 ng ) in 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 / 150 mM NaCl ( TBS ) were adsorbed onto plastic microtitre wells for 4 hours , and excess protein binding sites blocked with 2 % BSA in TBS . 125 I - vinculin ( 4 nM ) was added to the wells in 100 m l of TBS containing 4 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 with or without unlabelled vinculin . Following an overnight incubation , wells were washed three times in TBS / 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 and counted in a Beckman 5500 gamma counter . Microinjection of GST - fusion proteins into chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts ( CEF ) CEF were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( Life Tech - nologies , Paisley , UK ) containing 10 % tryptose phosphate broth plus 5 % newborn calf serum and 1 % chick serum ( Advanced Protein Products , West Midlands , UK ) . Cells were seeded onto glass cover - slips ( etched with a cross to aid relocation of the injected cells ) at least 2 days prior to injection . Approximately 50 cells were microinjected , and the cells returned to the incubator for between 5 and 60 minutes prior to ﬁxing and staining . All injections were carried out with the aid of a Leitz Diavert microscope using a Leitz micromanipulator connected to a Narishige microinjector unit . Microinjection needles were pulled from glass capillaries ( Clarke Biomedical Ltd , Slough , Berks . , UK ) on a microelectrode puller ( Campden Instruments Ltd , Sileby , Leics . , UK ) . Indirect immunoﬂuorescence The intracellular localisation of the injected GST - fusion proteins was determined as follows . Injected cells were incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C , and cells were then extracted ( 2 minutes ) with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in MES buffer ( 50 mM MES buffer , pH 6 . 0 , 3 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 ) to remove the cytoplasmic pool of injected protein . Extracted cells were ﬁxed in 3 . 8 % formaldehyde in PBS , and the injected GST - fusion proteins were detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti - GST antibody ( a generous gift from Dr E . Moiseeva , Depart - ment of Biochemistry , University of Leicester ) and a Texas Red - labelled anti - rabbit IgG ( Amersham ) . The effects of microinjected proteins on the actin cytoskeleton were determined after incubating injected cells for 30 - 60 minutes at 37°C . Cells were then ﬁxed in 3 . 8 % formaldehyde in PBS , permeabilised with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , and stained with FITC - labelled phalloidin ( Sigma ) according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Cells were stained for vinculin using a mouse monoclonal antibody V284 ( Asijee et al . , 1990 ) ( Serotec , Kidlington , Oxford , UK ) followed by a Texas Red - labelled sheep anti - mouse IgG . L . Hemmings and others 2717 Talin contains three actin - binding sites RESULTS The complete sequence of chicken talin . Comparison of the mouse , chicken , C . elegansand D . discoideumtalin amino acid sequences Analysis of the complete deduced amino acid sequence of chicken talin shows the protein to contain 2 , 541 amino acids with a M r of 271 , 881 . The chicken and mouse ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) proteins are very similar throughout the entire sequence ( Table 1 ) . Comparison with the C . elegans ( Moulder et al . , 1996 ) and D . discoideum ( Kreitmeier et al . , 1995 ) sequences indicates that talin is highly conserved ( Table 1 ) , the N - and C - terminal regions of the protein being the most similar ( Fig . 1A ) . Residues 1 - 433 , which are N - terminal to the calpain II cleavage site in chicken talin , show 57 % identity ( 79 % simi - larity ) with C . elegans talin , and 44 . 4 % identity ( 65 . 9 % simi - larity ) with D . discoideum talin . There are two blocks of conserved sequences in the C - terminal region . Residues 1 , 960 - 2 , 150 in chicken show 59 . 2 % identity ( 71 . 7 % similarity ) with the C . elegans , and 27 % identity ( 42 % similarity ) with the D . discoideum protein . Residues 2 , 300 - 2 , 541 in chicken show 50 . 8 % identity ( 68 . 5 % similarity ) with the C . elegans , and 35 . 2 % identity ( 51 . 5 % similarity ) with the D . discoideum protein . This latter region is therefore slightly more conserved , and displays homology with the C - terminal region of the yeast actin - binding protein Sla2p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , suggesting that this region of talin may also bind to actin . The central region of the protein ( residues 434 - 1 , 960 ) , which is predicted to be highly a - helical in both mouse and chicken talin and contains multiple alanine - rich repeats ( McLachlan et al . , 1994 ) , is signiﬁcantly less conserved in primary sequence ( chicken to C . elegans , 30 . 6 % identity , 51 . 2 % similarity ; chicken to D . discoideum 19 . 4 % identity , 40 . 9 % similarity ) . Identiﬁcation of actin - binding sites in talin To establish which regions of the talin molecule bind to F - actin , overlapping talin fusion proteins spanning nearly the entire sequence of the protein were puriﬁed and analysed for their ability to co - sediment with F - actin . Five fusion proteins extending through residues 102 - 1 , 327 were all found to co - sediment with F - actin , as did a fusion protein spanning residues 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 , whereas little if any of the various fusion proteins were able to sediment in the absence of F - actin ( Fig . 2 ) . In contrast , fusion proteins spanning residues 1 , 304 - 2 , 023 ( Fig . 2 ) and 1 , 554 - 2 , 124 ( data not shown ) did not co - sediment with F - actin . The smallest fusion proteins with binding activity were those spanning residues 102 - 497 , 951 - 1 , 327 and 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 . We conclude that at least three distinct regions of the talin molecule are able to bind to F - actin . To assess the relative affinities of these regions of the talin molecule for F - actin , increasing amounts of the talin polypep - tides were incubated with a ﬁxed quantity of F - actin , and the amount of the talin polypeptide co - sedimenting with F - actin determined by SDS - PAGE and densitometry . The ratio of the talin polypeptide : actin found in the pellet was then plotted against the concentration of talin polypeptide added , and the relative affinities of the fusion proteins estimated from the con - centrations of the proteins giving 50 % of maximal binding ( Fig . 3 ) . The values for talin polypeptides spanning residues 102 - 497 and 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 were 5 m M and 17 m M , respectively . Unfortunately , the talin fusion protein spanning residues 951 - 1 , 327 tended to aggregate at higher concentrations and was therefore replaced by one spanning residues 852 - 1 , 328 . The relative affinity of this talin polypeptide for F - actin was 8 m M . The affinities of the recombinant talin polypeptides for F - actin are lower than that of intact talin for G - actin ( K d 0 . 25 m M ; Kaufmann et al . , 1991 ) , but are similar to those determined for other recombinant actin - binding domains from proteins such as a - actinin , utrophin and dystrophin ( Winder et al . , 1995 ) . Further deﬁnition of the C - terminal vinculin - binding site in talin We have previously provided evidence that talin contains three vinculin - binding sites spanning residues 498 - 656 , 852 - 950 and 1 , 554 - 2 , 268 ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . To deﬁne further the boundaries of the C - terminal vinculin - binding site in relation to the neighbouring actin - binding site , a series of cDNAs encoding this region were made by PCR following standard procedures ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) , and the expressed fusion proteins assayed for their ability to bind 125 I - vinculin in a solid phase binding assay . 125 I - vinculin bound to talin polypeptides spanning residues 1 , 554 - 2 , 124 , 1 , 554 - 2 , 060 and 1 , 554 - 2 , 029 in a manner that was inhibited by unlabelled vinculin ( Fig . 4 ) . However , a talin polypeptide spanning residues 1 , 554 - 1 , 929 was unable to bind 125 I - vinculin above background levels , and activity was not regained by a further deletion to residue 1 , 829 . We conclude that residues 1 , 929 - 2 , 029 are essential for vinculin binding to this region of the talin molecule . However , the fact that there was a signiﬁcant reduction in vinculin binding when residues 2 , 029 - 2 , 124 were deleted raises the pos - sibility that this region contains more than one vinculin - binding site . To determine how many vinculin - binding sites are contained within the C - terminal region of talin , binding of 125 I - vinculin to a talin fusion protein spanning residues 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 was studied in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabelled vinculin . Scatchard analysis of the data indicated a high and lower affinity interaction between vinculin and the talin polypeptide , with K d values of 4 · 10 - 7 M and 3 . 5 · 10 - 6 M ( Fig . 5 ) , a characteristic previously observed using talin puriﬁed from chicken gizzard ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . We have shown that the biphasic nature of the binding curve is due to the presence of two classes of labelled vinculin molecules with a high and lower affinity for talin ( A . P . Gilmore , unpublished data ) , a property which results from the intramolecular associ - ation between the head and tail regions of the vinculin molecule ( Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) . The stoichiometry of binding for the high affinity interaction was 0 . 2 moles of vinculin bound per mole of talin whereas that for the lower affinity interaction , which measures the total number of vinculin binding sites in talin , was close to 1 : 1 .

Sequence alignment of chicken talin . ( A ) Talin sequences from chicken ( Gallus gallus ) ( this study ) , C . elegans ( Moulder et al . , 1996 ) and D . discoideum ( Kreitmeier et al . , 1995 ) were aligned using the Clustal programme within the UWGCG package . Identities ( black ) and conservative substitutions ( grey ) were highlighted using the programme Boxshade . The arrowhead indicates the calpain II cleavage site between residues 433 and 434 inferred from N - terminal sequencing of the 190 kDa talin polypeptide liberated from chicken gizzard talin by this protease ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) . ( B ) Alignment of the C - terminal sequences of chicken , nematode and slime mould talin with the C - terminal region of the S . cerevisiae actin binding protein Sla2p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . A noteable feature is the sequence GLISAA which is present in all four proteins . 2720 indicate that the C - terminal region of talin contains a single vinculin - binding site . Binding of 125 I - vinculin to a fusion protein spanning residues 565 - 1 , 328 was also biphasic ( K d values 1 · 10 - 7 M and 4 · 10 - 6 M ) with Bmax values of 0 . 1 and 2 : 1 , respectively . These results are consistent with previous results indicating that there are two additional independent vinculin - binding sites in talin between residues 498 and 656 and 852 - 950 ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . Analysis of the potential effects of a Pro 1 , 176 to Thr substitution in talin on binding to actin A point mutation has been identiﬁed in talin in the Wistar - Furth strain of rat which results in a Pro to Thr substitution at residue 1 , 176 ( Jackson et al . , 1993 ) . Interestingly , these rats show an heriditary defect in platelet formation , and the distri - bution of talin in megakaryocytes and platelets is abnormal ( Jackson et al . , 1992 ; Pestina et al . , 1995 ) . Proline residues in the talin rod domain are predicted to be clustered in the so called leader sequence at the beginning of each of the multiple 34 residue repeats ( McLachlan et al . , 1994 ) . The substitution could therefore destroy the folding of talin resulting in a non - functional protein , or it could lead to inactivation of a binding site in the talin molecule . This region of talin contains an actin - binding site ( residues 951 - 1 , 327 ) , and is close to a vinculin - binding site ( residues 852 - 950 ) , and we therefore investigated the effect of the substitution on the relative binding affinity of a fusion protein spanning residues 852 - 1328 for F - actin . Both the mutant and the wild - type fusion proteins bound to F - actin ( Fig . 6A , B ) , and the susbstitution had no effect on the affinity of the talin polypeptide for F - actin ( Fig . 6C ) . Neither did the substitution have any obvious affect on the ability of a talin fusion protein spanning residues 565 - 1 , 328 to bind to vinculin or to localise to focal adhesions when microinjected into CEF ( data not shown ) . These results are consistent with recent ﬁndings that the substitution does not segregate with the platelet defect in Wistar - Furth rats ( C . W . Jackson , personal communication ) and may indeed be silent , although we do not exclude the possibility that it might inactivate an as yet unchar - acterised binding site . The talin rod domain is thought to contain a binding site for b 1 integrins ( Horwitz et al . , 1986 ) , although the site has yet to be deﬁned . Microinjection of talin polypeptides containing N - and C - terminal sequences into CEF Talin is related to the ERM family of cytoskeletal proteins by virtue of a low level sequence similarity between the N - terminal region of the proteins ( Rees et al . , 1990 ; Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) . Studies on ezrin have shown that both the N - and C - terminal regions of the protein associate with the actin cytoskeleton , although only the latter interaction was stable to extraction with Triton X - 100 ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . To establish whether the N - and C - terminal regions of talin showed similar characteristics , puriﬁed talin fusion proteins spanning residues 102 - 497 ( which includes the region of homology with the ERM family of proteins ) and 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 ( homologous with a yeast actin - binding protein ; Fig . 1B ) were microinjected into CEF , and their subcellular distribution and resistance to Triton X - 100 extraction determined . Cells injected with the fusion proteins were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes , and either extracted with Triton X - 100 to remove the soluble pool of injected protein prior to ﬁxation and staining , or ﬁxed ﬁrst then extracted with Triton X - 100 . The fusion L . Hemmings and others Fig . 2 . Binding of talin fusion proteins to F - actin . Chicken talin fusion proteins were incubated in the presence ( + ) and absence ( - ) of G - actin , and 100 mM NaCl added to initiate actin polymerisation . The samples were then centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 15 minutes to pellet F - actin ; samples of the supernatant ( S ) and the pellet ( P ) were analysed by SDS - PAGE , and the proteins visualised by staining with Coomassie blue . The positions of the fusion proteins ( ﬁlled arrowheads ) and actin ( open arrowheads ) are shown to the right of each panel . 2721 Talin contains three actin - binding sites proteins were localised using an anti - GST antibody , and actin was visualised with FITC - phalloidin . The intracellular locali - sation of the fusion protein GST / 102 - 497 proved difficult to establish . If the cells were extracted with Triton X - 100 prior to ﬁxation , staining was completely abolished ( data not shown ) . In cells ﬁxed then stained , the large pool of cytosolic fusion protein made it impossible to visualise any discrete localisation of the protein within the cell body . However , the protein appeared to co - align with actin ﬁlaments extending from focal adhesions at the cell periphery ( Fig . 7A , B ) . Inter - estingly , when injected cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C prior to ﬁxation and staining , the GST / 102 - 497 fusion protein caused disruption of actin stress ﬁbres in most though not all cells ( Fig . 7C , D ) . Vinculin - containing focal adhesions were similarly disrupted ( data not shown ) . Quantitative analysis showed that the fusion protein caused either a partial or total disruption of stress ﬁbres in > 70 % cells ( Table 2 ) , whereas injection of GST alone produced little or no effect ( Fig . 7E , F ) . Microinjection of the fusion protein GST / 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 resulted in signiﬁcantly different results . The fusion protein localised predominantly to focal adhesions within 5 minutes of microinjection ( Fig . 8A , B ) , with weak co - localisation with actin ﬁlaments in some cells ( data not shown ) .

Microtitre wells coated with the talin fusion proteins ( 200 ng ) indicated were incubated with 125 I - vinculin ( 4 nM ) in the absence or presence of 500 nM unlabelled vinculin , and the amount of 125 I - vinculin bound determined as described in Materials and Methods . Assays were carried out in triplicate and the bars show the standard error about the mean . Table 2 . Effect of microinjecting talin fusion proteins into CEF on actin stress ﬁbres Effect on actin Talin fusion proteins ( amino acid co - ordinates ) stress ﬁbres 102 - 497 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 No disruption 28±3 90±6 11±1 Partial disruption 49±5 10±6 51±1 Total disruption 23±4 0 38±1 Talin polypeptides expressed as GST - fusion proteins were injected into CEF , the cells incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes , then ﬁxed and stained for F - actin as described in Materials and Methods . The effect of the fusion protein on the organisation of actin stress ﬁbres is expressed as a percentage ( ± s . d . ) of the total number of cells injected . 2722 resistant to extraction with Triton X - 100 . After 30 minutes , very few cells ( < 20 % ) showed any signs of stress ﬁbre dis - ruption ( Fig . 8C ) or loss of vinculin - containing focal adhesions ( data not shown ) . However , the fusion protein was no longer localised speciﬁcally in focal adhesions and appeared to be more uniformly distributed throughout the cell with some evidence of ﬁlamentous staining ( Fig . 8D ) . A larger C - terminal talin polypeptide ( residues 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 ) was also seen to localise to the ends of actin stress ﬁbres in focal adhesions within 5 minutes of injection ( Fig . 9A , B ) , and the protein was again resistant to extraction with Triton X - 100 . However , > 80 % of cells which were microinjected with GST / 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C showed partial or total disruption of actin stress ﬁbres ( Fig . 9C , D and Table 2 ) , and loss of vinculin - containing focal adhesions ( Fig . 9E , F ) . DISCUSSION Comparisons of the chicken talin sequence reported here with those of C . elegans ( Moulder et al . , 1996 ) and D . discoideum ( Kreitmeier et al . , 1995 ) talin sequences show the N - and C - terminal regions of the protein to be conserved . The region N - terminal to the calpain II cleavage site in chicken talin contains two blocks of conserved sequence ; residues 4 - 129 and 166 - 422 . The intervening region contains an insert in C . elegans and a deletion in D . discoideum talin . There are also two conserved regions toward the C terminus of the protein , one spanning residues 1 , 960 - 2 , 150 , the other residues 2 , 334 - 2 , 524 ( Fig . 1A , B ) . We show here that the former contains a vinculin - binding site , and the latter an actin - binding site which displays homology to the yeast actin - binding protein Sla2p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . However , two other regions of talin also bind to F - actin , namely residues 102 - 497 and 951 - 1 , 327 . Interestingly , L .

The effect of a Pro 1 , 176 to Thr substitution on binding of a talin polypeptide spanning residues 852 - 1 , 328 to F - actin . Platelet talin isolated from the Wistar - Furth ( WF ) strain of rat contains a Pro 1 , 176 to Thr substitution ( Jackson et al . , 1993 ) . ( A , B ) The effect of this substitution on binding of increasing concentrations of a chicken talin fusion protein ( residues 852 - 1 , 328 ) to a ﬁxed concentration of F - actin ( 5 m M ) was analysed using a co - sedimentation and SDS - PAGE as described in Materials and Methods . ( C ) The ratio of the talin polypeptide : actin ( arbitrary absorbance units ) in the pellet was plotted against the amount of talin polypeptide added using the Proﬁt package ( Quantum Soft , Zurich , Switzerland ) . 0 0 . 005 0 . 01 0 . 015 0 . 02 B / F 0 0 . 5 1 B ( mol . mol - 1 ) Talin residues 1646 - 2541 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 B / F 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 B ( mol . mol - 1 ) Talin residues 565 - 1328 Fig . 5 . Stoichiometry of binding of vinculin to talin fusion proteins spanning residues 565 - 1 , 328 and 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 . Microtitre wells coated with the talin fusion proteins ( 200 ng ) indicated were incubated with 125 I - vinculin ( 4 nM ) in the presence of increasing concentrations ( 5 nM - 4 , 000 nM ) of unlabelled vinculin , and the amount of 125 I - vinculin bound determined as described in Materials and Methods . The means of triplicate assays were corrected for non - speciﬁc binding to wells coated with BSA . The data are presented as Scatchard plots . 2723 Talin contains three actin - binding sites each of the actin - binding sites in talin is distinct from , but adjacent to a binding site for vinculin , a protein which can also bind to F - actin ( Menkel et al . , 1994 ; Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) . Microinjection studies show that those regions of talin con - taining the N - and C - terminal actin - binding sites have distinc - tive properties in terms of their localisation , resistance to detergent extraction and ability to disrupt focal adhesions and actin stress ﬁbres . A schematic representation of the domain structure of talin which incorporates this new information is shown in Fig . 10 . The microinjection studies of Nuckolls et al . ( 1990 ) indicate that the N - terminal region of talin contains key determinants responsible for speciﬁc localisation of the protein to cell - matrix junctions . However , binding partners for this region of talin which might account for the localisation of the protein have remained elusive . The fact that the N - terminal region contains two blocks of conserved residues separated by a non - conserved region suggests that it is composed of separate domains with distinct functions . Talin residues 165 - 373 share homologies with band 4 . 1 and the ERM family of cytoskeletal proteins ( Rees et al . , 1990 ; Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) . This region of the band 4 . 1 protein contains a binding site for the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane protein glycophorin C as well as the peripheral membrane protein p55 ( Marfatia et al . , 1994 ) , evidence that it is important in localising band 4 . 1 to the membrane / cytoskeletal interface . Whether the ERM homology region in talin contains a binding site for an integral membrane protein remains to be clariﬁed , although the available evidence suggests that integrins bind to the C - terminal rod domain of the molecule ( Horwitz et al . , 1986 ) . However , we demonstrate here that the ERM homology region in talin does contain or is adjacent to an actin - binding site , as a fusion protein spanning residues 102 - 497 binds actin in vitro , and localises ( albeit weakly ) to actin stress ﬁbres when microinjected into cultured cells . Interestingly , the 47 kDa N - terminal talin polypeptide liberated by calpain II cleavage ( residues 1 - 433 ) localized to Fig . 7 . Microinjection of CEF with a talin fusion protein containing residues 102 - 497 . CEF were microinjected with the talin fusion protein GST / 102 - 497 and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes ( A , B ) prior to ﬁxation and permeabilisation . Cells were stained for F - actin using FITC - phalloidin ( A ) and for the injected fusion protein using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GST and a Texas red - labelled anti - rabbit IgG ( B ) . The fusion protein was weakly associated with actin ﬁlaments at the periphery of the cell ( arrows ) . Injected cells were also incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes ( C , D ) and ﬁxed then stained for F - actin ( C ) and the GST / 102 - 497 ( D ) . Under these conditions , the actin cytoskeleton in most injected cells was completely disrupted , whereas uninjected cells contained numerous actin stress ﬁbres . Cells injected with GST alone ( E , F ) and stained for F - actin ( E ) and GST ( F ) were unaffected . Bar , 5 m m . Fig . 8 . Microinjection of CEF with a talin fusion protein containing residues 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 . Injected cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes ( A , B ) , permeabilised with Triton X - 100 to extract the cytoplasmic pool of injected protein , then ﬁxed and stained for F - actin ( A ) and injected fusion protein ( B ) as described in Materials and Methods . Under these conditions , the fusion protein was localised to focal adhesions ( arrows ) with little or no staining along actin stress ﬁbres . Injected cells were also incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes ( C - D ) , ﬁxed ﬁrst and then stained for F - actin ( C ) and the injected GST - fusion protein ( D ) . The injected fusion protein ( D ) was now localised in focal adhesions ( arrow ) and along the actin stress ﬁbres extending from focal adhesions ( arrowhead ) , and the actin cytoskeleton remained unaffected ( C ) . Bar , 5 m m . 2724 focal adhesions rather than actin ﬁlaments when microinjected into cells ( Nuckolls et al . , 1990 ) . These results support the notion that the conserved residues at the extreme N - terminal region of talin play a role in targeting the protein to focal adhesions , whereas the ERM homology region provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton . This link would appear to be rela - tively labile as the talin fusion protein spanning residues 102 - 497 was quantitatively extracted from microinjected cells treated with Triton X - 100 prior to ﬁxation . More C - terminal regions of the protein which localised to focal adhesions , were resistant to detergent extraction . These observations are similar to those made with cells stably expressing various talin polypeptides ( Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) , and are reminiscent of studies on ezrin ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . The expressed N - terminal region of ezrin , which localized to the sub - membra - nous actin cytoskeleton , was solubilised by Triton X - 100 , whereas the C - terminal region of the protein , which localised to actin stress ﬁbres , was resistant to detergent extraction . The N - terminal region of talin has also been shown to bind charged lipids ( Niggli et al . , 1994 ) and might therefore interact with membranes in a manner independent of protein - protein inter - actions . Platelet talin has been shown to translocate to the membrane following activation even in the absence of integrin GPIIb - IIIa ( Bertagnolli et al . , 1993 ) . These various observa - tions suggest a model in which the N - terminal head region of talin binds to one or more proteins responsible for localising talin speciﬁcally to cell - matrix junctions , to membrane lipids , and to the actin cytoskeleton via interactions which are readily disrupted by non - ionic detergents . The C - terminal rod domain of talin contains two additional actin - binding sites neither of which displays any obvious sequence homology to the other , or to those mapped to the C - terminal regions of ezrin ( Turunen et al . , 1994 ) and moesin ( Pestonjamasp et al . , 1995 ) . Talin binds to both G - and F - actin , and is reported both to nucleate actin ﬁlament assembly ( Muguruma et al . , 1990 ; Kaufmann et al . , 1991 ) , and to augment the ability of a - actinin to cross - link F - actin ( Muguruma et al . , 1992 ) . The actin cross - linking activity may be explained by the fact that talin contains more than one actin - binding site , or by the observation that it can form dimers under certain conditions ( Molony et al . , 1987 ) . What role each of the actin - binding sites in talin fulﬁlls remains to be explored . The C - terminal site ( residues 2 , 300 - 2 , 541 ) is homologous to a region of the S . cerevisiae protein Sla2p which appears to be important in controlling the assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton at bud sites ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . By analogy , the C - terminal actin - binding site in talin may play a key role in the assembly of actin ﬁlaments asso - ciated with focal adhesions . The fact that a fusion protein ( residues 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 ) containing this site localised to focal adhesions when microinjected into CEF may be relevant in this regard . The three actin - binding sites in talin are each close to regions of the protein that bind vinculin ( Fig . 10 ) , a protein which can also bind to actin ( Menkel et al . , 1994 ; Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) . Vinculin interacts with talin via residues within the N - terminal globular head region ( residues 1 - 258 ) of vinculin ( Jones et al . , 1989 ; Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) whereas the actin - binding site ( s ) are in the C - terminal region of the molecule ( Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) , which can form an extended tail . It will be interesting to establish whether talin enhances the ability of vinculin to bind to actin in a manner similar to its ability to augment the actin - bundling activity of a - actinin ( Muguruma et al . , 1992 ) . Bearing in mind that vinculin also binds a - actinin ( McGregor et al . , 1994 ) , and both talin ( Horwitz et al . , 1986 ) and a - actinin ( Otey et al . , 1993 ) are reported to bind to the cytoplasmic face of integrins , it seems likely that the interactions among these proteins play a pivotal role in the assembly of actin ﬁlaments and stress ﬁbres on the cytoplasmic face of focal adhesions . If talin is a key component of focal adhesions as suggested by the results from a variety of experimental approaches , one might expect that microinjection of sub - domains of the protein would competitively inhibit the interactions between talin and L . Hemmings and others Fig . 9 . Microinjection of CEF with a talin fusion protein containing residues 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 . Injected cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes ( A , B ) , permeabilised with Triton X - 100 to extract the cytoplasmic pool of injected protein , then ﬁxed and stained for F - actin ( A ) and injected fusion protein ( B ) as described in Materials and Methods . The fusion protein localised to focal adhesions ( arrow ) with little or no staining along actin stress ﬁbres . Injected cells were also incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes ( C - F ) and ﬁxed ﬁrst , and then stained for F - actin ( C ) , vinculin ( E ) and the injected GST - fusion protein ( D , F ) . Under these conditions , the actin cytoskeleton and vinculin - containing focal adhesions were completely disrupted in most of the injected cells , although they were unaffected in neighbouring cells which had not been injected with the talin fusion protein ( arrows ) . Bar , 5 m m . 2725 Talin contains three actin - binding sites its various binding partners , and so disrupt focal adhesions . This prediction was conﬁrmed when we observed that a fusion protein ( residues 1 , 646 - 2 , 541 ) containing both the C - terminal vinculin and actin - binding sites disrupted focal adhesions and actin stress ﬁbres in CEF . However , a smaller C - terminal fusion protein ( 2 , 269 - 2 , 541 ) containing the actin - binding site ( but not the vinculin - binding site ) was ineffective in this regard . One potential explanation for this observation is that the larger fusion protein disrupts focal adhesions by inhibiting the interaction between talin and vinculin . Vinculin is known to be a relatively low abundance protein essential for focal adhesion assembly ( Rodriguez - Ferandez et al . , 1993 ) , at least in ﬁbroblasts . The concentrations of actin in the cell may be too great for the C - terminal talin polypeptide to compete the interaction between actin and endogenous talin . The fact that a fusion protein ( residues 102 - 497 ) containing the N - terminal actin - binding site , but no vinculin - binding site , was also able to disrupt focal adhesions could be explained if this region contains an additional binding site for another focal adhesion protein , as discussed earlier . Whether the actin and vinculin - binding sites in talin are always exposed or are regulated in some way remains to be established . In vinculin , an intramolecular association between the globular N - terminal head and the C - terminal tail has been shown to obscure the actin and talin - binding sites ( Johnson and Craig , 1994 ) . The head - tail association is inhibited by acidic phospholipids such as PIP2 exposing the actin - binding site ( Weekes et al . , 1996 ) . Talin has been observed to exist in both a globular and an extended conﬁguration in vitro , whereas the 190 kDa rod domain is always fully extended ( Molony et al . , 1987 ) . Interestingly , the 190 kDa talin polypeptide has been reported to bind vinculin more tightly than does intact talin ( Burridge and Mangeat , 1984 ) . The authors are grateful to : Dr N .
