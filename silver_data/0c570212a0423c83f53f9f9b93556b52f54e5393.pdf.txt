Using a - catenin ( a - cat ) knock - out Madin Darby Canine Kidney 36 ( MDCK ) cells reconstituted with wild - type and mutant forms of a - cat as a model system , we find 37 that an established a - cat actin - binding domain unfolding mutant designed to reduce force - 38 sensitive binding to F - actin ( a - cat - H0 - FABD + ) can promote cytokinesis failure , particularly along 39 epithelial wound - fronts . Enhanced a - cat coupling to cortical actin is neither sufficient nor mitotic 40 cell - autonomous for cytokinesis failure , but critically requires the mechanosensitive Middle - 41 domain ( M1 - M2 - M3 ) and neighboring cells . Disease relevant a - cat M - domain missense 42 mutations known to cause a form of retinal pattern dystrophy ( a - cat E307K or L436P ) are 43 associated with elevated binucleation rates via cytokinesis failure . Similar binucleation rates are 44 seen in cells expressing an a - cat salt - bridge destabilizing mutant ( R551A ) designed to promote 45 M2 - M3 domain unfurling at lower force thresholds . Since binucleation is strongly enhanced by 46 removal of the M1 as opposed to M2 - M3 domains , cytokinetic fidelity is most sensitive to a - cat 47 M2 - M3 domain opening . To identify a - cat conformation - dependent proximity partners that 48 contribute to cytokinesis , we used a biotin - ligase approach to distinguished proximity partners 49 that show enhanced recruitment upon a - cat M - domain unfurling ( R551A ) . We identified Leucine 50 Zipper Tumor Suppressor 2 ( LZTS2 ) , an abscission factor previously implicated in cytokinesis . 51 We confirm that LZTS2 enriches at the midbody , but discover it also localizes to tight and 52 tricellular junctions . LZTS2 knock - down promotes binucleation in both MDCK and Retinal 53 Pigmented Epithelial ( RPE ) cells . a - cat mutants with persistent M2 - M3 domain opening showed 54 elevated junctional enrichment of LZTS2 from the cytosol compared a - cat wild - type cells . These 55 data implicate LZTS2 as a mechanosensitive effector of a - cat that is critical for cytokinetic 56 fidelity . This model rationalizes how persistent mechano - activation of a - cat may drive tension - 57 induced polyploidization of epithelia post - injury and suggests an underlying mechanism for how 58 pathogenic a - cat mutations drive macular dystrophy . 59 60 61 3 INTRODUCTION 62 Cytokinesis failure is rapidly emerging as a means to new cell and tissue physiologies rather 63 than an unproductive glitch ( Bailey et al . , 2021 ; Fox et al . , 2020 ; Peterson & Fox , 2021 ; 64 Schoenfelder & Fox , 2015 ) . Cardiomyocytes become binucleated through a developmentally 65 timed defect in cytokinetic furrow progression ( Engel et al . , 2006 ; Normand & King , 2010 ; 66 Soonpaa et al . , 1996 ) . This leads to terminally differentiated cells that are larger than their 67 mononuclear ( diploid ) counterparts ( Patterson et al . , 2017 ) , presumably to support the long term 68 function of these continuously contracting actin - myosin sarcomere units ( Karbassi et al . , 2020 ; 69 Orr - Weaver , 2015 ; Øvrebø & Edgar , 2018 ) . Macrophages can also become multinuclear upon 70 exposure to certain bacteria by eliciting Toll - Like Receptor signals that antagonize cytokinesis . 71 This leads to formation of giant polyploid macrophage “granulomas” that are transcriptionally 72 distinct for managing chronic infections ( Herrtwich et al . , 2016 ) . Even simple epithelia can 73 become polyploid after tissue injury due to failed cytokinesis ( Cao et al . , 2017 ; Lazzeri et al . , 74 2019 ) , where increased DNA copies may enable adaptation to an injured state that facilitates 75 repair ( Schoenfelder & Fox , 2015 ) . Unique to epithelial barriers , injury - induced epithelia 76 polyploidization and consequent hypertrophy is advantageous , as larger cells manifest less 77 junctional surface area per unit of epithelial area covered , leading to decreased permeability in 78 an otherwise leaky - barrier environment ( Cohen et al . , 2018 ; Losick et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , 79 cytokinesis failure appears to be a “feature , not a bug” of the mitosis paradigm , leading to a 80 diversity of beneficial outcomes . 81 If benefits of cytokinesis failure are clear , the way cells fail to successfully complete this process 82 are just emerging . Excessive integrin - extracellular matrix adhesive tension along the wound 83 front appears to be one cause of cytokinesis failure , where basal stress fibers can interfere with 84 contractility of the actin - myosin cytokinetic ring leading to a cell with two nuclei ( Uroz et al . , 85 2018 , 2019 ) . Curiously , the adherens junction ( AJ ) component , alpha - catenin ( a - cat ) , is a 86 tension - sensitive actin - binding protein that sustains missense mutations linked to macular 87 dystrophies ( Saksens et al . , 2016 ) . Remarkably , a forward genetic screen in mice aimed at 88 modelling the earliest stages of disease suggests pathogenesis initiates through progressive 89 multinucleation of retinal pigment epithelial cells . How a - cat dysfunction leads to multinucleation 90 in this system , however , remains unknown . 91 a - cat mechanosensitivity and AJ function depend on the conformations and binding activity of a - 92 cat’s N - terminal , Middle and C - terminal regions ( Ishiyama et al . , 2013 ; Rangarajan & Izard , 93 2012 ) . The N - terminal domain comprises two 4 - helical bundles , where the former binds b - 94 4 catenin and associates with cadherin adhesion receptors ( Pokutta & Weis , 2000 ) . The C - 95 terminal 5 - helical bundle shows allosteric binding to F - actin , where force - dependent alteration of 96 a - helical ( H ) regions H0 and H1 favors high affinity binding of H2 - 5 to actin filaments , leading to 97 “catch - bond” behavior ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ; Ishiyama et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2022 ; Xu et al . , 98 2020 ) . The middle ( M ) - region of a - cat ( comprising three 4 - helical bundles ( M1 - 3 ) ) can undergo 99 sequential , force - dependent unfurling events to recruit a - cat M - domain binding partners ( Barrick 100 et al . , 2018 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Maki et al . , 2018 ; Pang et al . , 2019 ; Seddiki et al . , 101 2018 ; Terekhova et al . , 2019 ; Thomas et al . , 2013 ; Yao et al . , 2014 ; Yonemura et al . , 2010 ) . But 102 the features of adherens junction ( AJ ) organization and dynamics impacted by distinct a - cat 103 unfolding states , and the mechanosensitive a - cat binding partners linked to AJ organizational 104 states are only just emerging ( Cho et al . , 2022 ; Donker et al . , 2022a ; Ishiyama et al . , 2018a ; 105 Matsuzawa et al . , 2018 ; Monster et al . , 2021a ; Noordstra et al . , 2023 ; Sakakibara et al . , 2020 ; 106 Sarpal et al . , 2019 ; Sheppard et al . , 2023 ; Twiss et al . , 2012 ; van den Goor & Miller , 2022 ) . In 107 the current study , we show that alterations in a - cat binding to F - actin or its mechanosensitive 108 middle ( M ) - domain are sufficient to drive cytokinesis failure and sustain binucleated cells within 109 an epithelial monolayer . We further credential Leucine Zipper Tumor Suppressor 2 ( LZTS2 ) , an 110 understudied scaffold protein previously implicated abscission ( Sudo & Maru , 2007 , 2008 ) , as a 111 novel conformation - sensitive proximity partner of a - cat , where persistent recruitment to AJs 112 interferes with LZTS2 ring formation at the midbody . These findings demonstrate that LZTS2 is 113 a mechanosensitive effector of a - cat critical for abscission fidelity in epithelia and suggest that 114 tension - dependent changes on a - cat and AJ may contribute to the phenomenon of epithelial 115 cell polyploidization post - injury for means of effective barrier repair . 116 117 118 5 RESULTS 119 Persistent coupling of a - cat to cortical actin enhances epithelial cell binucleation 120 To understand how a - cat binding to actin is regulated by force , Ishiyama et al engineered an a - 121 cat F - actin - binding domain ( FABD ) unfolding mutant ( RAIM à GSGS mutation in a - helix 0 ) with 122 the goal of attenuating force - dependent a - cat binding to actin , where this mutant leads to 123 enhanced F - actin binding and epithelial monolayer strength compared with wild - type a - cat 124 ( Ishiyama et al . , 2018 ) . By reconstituting this mutant , a - cat - H0 - FABD + , into a - cat knock - out 125 Madin Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) cells , we generalized this phenomenon to another 126 epithelial cell type , showing that partial loss of the a - cat catch bond mechanism leads to 127 stronger epithelial sheet integrity with greater co - localization between the a - cat - H0 - FABD + 128 mutant and actin . This mutant , however , also interferes with more dynamic processes such as 129 epithelial wound - closure ( Ishiyama et al . , 2018 ) ( Wood et al . , 2023 ) . Since AJ of a - cat - H0 - 130 FABD + - restored MDCK cells do not show constitutive accessibility to the a 18 monoclonal 131 antibody M2 - domain epitope compared with WT a - cat , we reason this mutant enhances static 132 but interferes with dynamic cell - cell adhesive behaviors through persistent engagement with 133 lower tension cortical actin networks ( Wood et al . , 2023 ) . 134 Having established a - cat - H0 - FABD + as a tool to interrogate contributions of a - cat catch - bond 135 activity to dynamic adhesive processes ( i . e . , a “force - desensitized” actin - binding form of a - cat ) , 136 we discovered that the a - cat - H0 - FABD + mutant - restored MDCK a - cat KO cells were associated 137 with significantly higher rates of binucleation compared with WT - a - cat - restored cells ( Fig . 1A - 138 D ) . This effect was enhanced along epithelial wound - fronts ( Fig . 1E ) , a process associated with 139 increased tension on the cadherin - catenin complex ( Borghi et al . , 2012 ; Donker et al . , 2022 ; 140 Monster et al . , 2021 ) . Based on these data , we hypothesized that altered a - cat 141 mechanosensitivity might causally contribute to the generation and / or maintenance of polyploid 142 cells that emerge along wound fronts and are critical for epithelial barrier repair ( Cao et al . , 143 2017 ) . 144 Persistent coupling of a - cat to actin promotes binucleation via cytokinesis failure 145 The increased association between the a - cat - H0 - FABD + mutant and MDCK cell binucleation 146 could occur via two distinct routes : cytokinesis failure or cell - cell fusion , two common routes of 147 epithelial cell polyploidization after injury ( Bailey et al . , 2021 ; Dehn et al . , 2021 ; Gjelsvik et al . , 148 2019 ; Nandakumar et al . , 2020 ; Øvrebø & Edgar , 2018 ; Peterson & Fox , 2021 ) . To investigate 149 the route to polyploidization observed above , we performed live imaging of GFP - a - cat - WT or 150 6 GFP - a - cat - H0 - FABD + cells co - expressing the histone 2B - red fluorescent protein reporter ( H2B - 151 RFP ) ( Fig . 2 ; Movie 1 , left ) . Interestingly , mitosis took much longer in a - cat - H0 - FABD + ( 46 . 00 152 min ) than WT a - cat - restored MDCK cells ( 32 . 17 min ) . Telophase and cytokinesis phases were 153 substantially extended in a - cat - H0 - FABD + ( 14 . 71 min ) compared with a - cat - WT cells ( 4 . 61 min ) , 154 and relative to other mitotic phases ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Remarkably , a - cat - H0 - FABD + cells also 155 showed significantly higher rates of cytokinesis failure , particularly during the latest stage of 156 cytokinesis , abscission ( Fig . 2A , asterisk , 2C - graph ; Movie 1 , right ) . In all cases where 157 binucleated cells formed during imaging , an intervening mitotic event was captured , suggesting 158 cytokinesis failure rather than cell - cell fusion is the major route to binucleation in a - cat - H0 - 159 FABD + - expressing cells . Thus , enhanced coupling of a - cat to cortical actin can interfere with 160 cytokinetic fidelity . 161 a - cat - H0 - FABD + - induced cytokinesis failure does not occur in single cells 162 Cell division can be regulated both autonomously and non - autonomously ( Fededa & Gerlich , 163 2012 ; Herszterg et al . , 2013 ; Monster et al . , 2021b ; Pinheiro et al . , 2017 ) . To understand if a - cat 164 regulates cytokinesis through neighboring cells , we characterized mitosis at the single cell level . 165 Interestingly , while a - cat - H0 - FABD + - restored MDCK single cells showed significant mitotic - 166 phase lengthening , telophase and cytokinesis preceded normally with no evidence of abscission 167 failure ( Fig . S1 A , B ) . Even a - cat KO parental cells that remained attached through the mitotic - 168 rounding / re - adhesion sequence showed similar kinetics of mitosis with no cytokinesis failures , 169 although the number of events captured was much fewer ( see Discussion for caveat ) . Similar 170 results were observed in the E - cadherin / catenin - deficient epidermoid cell line , A431D , where 171 enforced a - cat - H0 - FABD + expression failed to impact any stage of mitosis compared with WT - a - 172 cat ( Fig . S1C , D ) . Together , these data suggested a - cat can only interfere with cytokinetic 173 fidelity from within the cadherin - catenin complex , and in a manner that depends on neighboring 174 cell - cell contacts . 175 a - cat - H0 - FABD + - induced cytokinesis failure requires the mechanosensitive M - domain 176 Evidence that WT a - cat and a - cat - H0 - FABD + show similar M2 - domain accessibility to the a 18 177 monoclonal antibody raises the possibility that enhanced coupling to cortical actin can occur in 178 the absence of a - cat M2 - domain unfurling ( Wood et al . , 2023 ) . To distinguish whether a - cat - H0 - 179 FABD + interferes with cytokinesis through binding to F - actin alone , or via a - cat M - domain 180 conformation - sensitive functions consequent to ABD binding to F - actin , we engineered WT a - 181 7 cat and a - cat - H0 - FABD + mutants lacking the entire M - domain ( Fig . 3A ) . Interestingly , both a - 182 cat - ∆M and a - cat - ∆M H0 - FABD + progressed through mitosis similarly to WT - a - cat ( Fig . 3B - C ) . 183 However , telophase lengthening and cytokinesis failures associated with the a - cat - H0 - FABD + 184 mutant were completely avoided when the M - domain was removed from this mutant ( Fig . 3D , a - 185 cat - ∆M H0 - FABD + ) . These data suggest persistent coupling of a - cat to cortical actin alone is 186 insufficient to interfere with cytokinesis , and that the conformationally sensitive M - domain is 187 required for interference . 188 a - cat M - domain missense mutants causing eye dystrophy support binucleation 189 While full length a - cat protein is essential for organismal development ( Ishiyama et al . , 2018 ; 190 Sheikh et al . , 2006 ; Torres et al . , 1997 ) , M - domain localized missense mutations in the human 191 gene CTNNA1 are associated with butterfly - shaped pigment dystrophy ( BPD ) , a rare patterned 192 dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium that leads to a progressive , age - dependent loss of 193 vision ( Saksens et al . , 2016 ; e . g . , a - cat - E307K ) . Remarkably , a forward genetic screen in mice 194 aimed at modelling the earliest stages of this patterned dystrophy identified a mouse Ctnna1 195 missense mutant also implicating a - cat M - domain dysfunction in this disease ( a - cat - L436P ) . 196 Curiously , disease pathogenesis initiates through progressive multinucleation of retinal pigment 197 epithelial cells , raising the possibility that a - cat M - domain dysfunction might causally contribute 198 to this process . To learn whether these M - domain missense mutations could enhance the rate 199 of binucleation in a heterologous epithelial cell system , we stably expressed a - cat - E307K or - 200 L436P mutants in MDCK a - cat KO cells ( Fig . 4A , B ) . While the binucleation rate was only 201 modestly increased in dense filter - grown monolayers , this rate was significantly elevated after 202 scratch - wounding ( Fig . 4C , D ) . Live imaging mature monolayers revealed all binucleated cells 203 were generated after mitotic rounding and furrow regression , consistent with cytokinesis failure 204 ( Fig . S2A - C ) . Although binucleated cells do migrate faster than neighboring mononuclear cells 205 as previously described ( Kozyrska et al . , 2022 ) , this leader cell behavior was not significantly 206 different between WT or mutant a - cat expressing cells ( Fig . S2D - F ) . These data demonstrate 207 that the increased binucleation rate observed along a - cat missense mutant wound fronts 208 relative to WT is due to differences in cytokinesis failure , rather than similarly enhanced rates of 209 wound - induced cytokinesis failure and faster migration of a - cat - E307K or - L436P mutants . 210 Lastly , similar cytokinesis failure rates were observed with a previously characterized a - cat M3 - 211 domain salt - bridge mutation R551A , which displays a more open M - domain conformation via 212 FRET - based assay ( Barrick et al . , 2018 ) ( Fig . S2C ) . While it is currently difficult to predict how 213 8 E307K or L436P mutations alter a - cat M - domain conformation and mechanosensitivity , 214 evidence these mutants share similar cytokinesis failure phenotypes suggests a common 215 mechanism . 216 Identification of a - cat proximity partners sensitive to M - domain unfurling 217 To identify a - cat conformation - dependent proximity partners potentially relevant to cytokinesis , 218 we inducibly expressed biotin ligase ( BirA * ) - a - cat chimeric constructs in HEK293 Flp - In T - REx 219 cells using wild - type and R551A salt - bridge disrupting mutant forms of a - cat . After induction of 220 protein expression and biotinylation , we performed streptavidin purification , and analyzed the 221 samples by mass spectrometry ( Fig . 5A ) . High confidence proximal partners with increased 222 binding to the M - domain unfurled R551A mutant over wild - type a - cat were identified using the 223 SAINTexpress algorithm ( Fig . 5B ) . We confirmed vinculin and afadin as a - cat M - domain 224 conformation sensitive binding partners , but selected an understudied protein for further 225 analysis , Leucine Zipper Tumor Suppressor 2 ( LZTS2 ) , because of its localization to the 226 midbody and implication in abscission ( Sudo & Maru , 2007a , 2008 ; Thyssen et al . , 2006 ) . 227 Below , we credential LZTS2 as a tension - sensitive a - cat binding partner and its requirement for 228 cytokinesis fidelity in MDCK . 229 LZTS2 localizes to apical and midbody junctions and is required for normal cell division 230 Recent studies in HEK293 cells reveal that LZTS2 localizes at cell - cell contacts ( Go et al . , 2021 ; 231 Baskaran et al . , 2021 ) and the centrosome ( Cho et al . , 2022 ) . In fully mature filter grown MDCK 232 cells , LZTS2 localizes to apical junctions and the base of primary cilia ( Fig . 6A ) . MDCK cells 233 plated on glass coverslips also show enrichment at multicellular junctions and the midbody ( Fig . 234 6B ) . To assess roles for LZTS2 in polarized epithelia , we knocked - down LZTS2 using pooled 235 siRNA or shRNA approaches ( Fig . 6D ) . LZTS2 KD MDCKs showed significantly higher 236 binucleation rates compared to negative controls ( Fig . 6C & E ) , consistent with a previous study 237 ( Sudo et al . , 2007 ) . Similar results were seen in retinal pigmented epithelial ( RPE ) cells , where 238 higher - efficiency LZTS2 knockdown was more evident by immunoblot analysis , and also led to 239 increased binucleation ( Fig . S3A - C ) . These data show that LZTS2 localizes to cell - cell junctions 240 and midbody structures and its depletion leads to MDCK binucleation . 241 a - cat - D M1 preferentially recruits LZTS2 to cell contacts over wild - type and other a - cat 242 mutants 243 244 Since LZTS2 recruitment to a - cat is M - domain conformation sensitive ( Fig . 5 ) and LZTS2 245 depletion leads to elevated binucleation ( Fig . 6 ) , we reasoned the higher binucleation rate 246 9 associated with a - cat M - domain and FABD + mutants might be due to enhanced sequestration 247 of LZTS2 away from the midbody , leading to abscission failure . To address this , we first looked 248 for evidence of bulk LZTS2 sequestration to cell - cell junctions with depletion from the 249 cytoplasmic pool , however , neither a - cat M - domain R551A salt - bridge - disrupting mutant nor 250 missense mutants associated with eye dystrophy showed obvious differences in LZTS2 junction 251 recruitment ( Fig . S4 ) . Remarkably , a set of broader a - cat mutants lacking either M1 , M2 , 3 or Nii 252 domains proved more revealing , where the former showed clear evidence of LZTS2 253 sequestration to cell - cell junctions with a depleted cytosolic pool relative WT a - cat or other 254 mutants ( Fig . 7 ) . Since M1 and M2 - M3 domains are held together in a closed conformation by 255 salt - bridge interactions ( Barrick et al . , 2018 ) , deletion of M1 is reasoned to expose M2 - M3 256 helices independently of tension . Thus , M2 - M3 domain unfurling appears to “trap” LZTS2 at cell - 257 cell contacts . This effect is consistent with , and quantitatively stronger than recruitment by the 258 M3 - domain R551A single point mutant . These data suggest that persistent mechano - activation 259 of a - cat with M2 - M3 exposure can alter the junction versus cytoplasmic distribution of LZTS2 in 260 MDCK cells . 261 262 LZTS2 recruitment to WT a - cat junctions is actomyosin dependent 263 To determine if LZTS2 recruitment to cell - cell contacts is actomyosin dependent , we assessed 264 localization under conditions of myosin inhibition . When WT - a - cat - restored MDCK were grown 265 on coverslips , blebbistatin treatment diminished LZTS2 signal , especially along bicellular 266 junctions ( Fig . 8A , B ) . Interestingly , LZTS2 recruitment to a - cat D M1 - restored MDCK cells was 267 unaffected by blebbistatin , as expected for an a - cat mutant that constitutively exposes M2 - M3 268 helices independently of tension ( Fig . 8C , D ) . These data suggest that junctional recruitment of 269 LZTS2 is tension sensitive , and that the a - cat D M1 mutant leads to a persistently enhanced 270 recruitment of LZTS2 to cell - cell contacts . 271 272 LZTS2 localizes to apical midbody junctions during abscission 273 To understand how LZTS2 depletion leads to elevated binucleation rates , we examined LZTS2 274 enrichment near midbody structures by immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells , inferring 275 early versus late stages of cytokinesis from the thickness , size and apical bias of the midbody 276 ( marked by acetylated tubulin ) ( Guizett et al . , 2011 ; Hu et al . , 2012 ; Karasmanis et al . , 2019 ; 277 Osswald & Morais - de - Sá , 2019 ) . During late cytokinesis , LZTS2 could be found flanking the 278 apically resolving midbody ( Fig . 9A - C ) , confirming an intimate relationship between LZTS2 and 279 10 the process of abscission . En face ( x - y views ) of dividing cells across different stages of 280 cytokinesis showed progression of LZTS2 enrichment at junctions proximal to acetylated tubulin 281 midbody structures ( Fig . 9D ) , a pattern resembling localization of septins , anillin and non - 282 muscle myosin II ( Piekny et al . , 2008 ; Hu et al . , 2012 ; Karasmanis et al . , 2019 ; Straight et al . , 283 2005 ) . Once the dense intercellular bridge formed , LZTS2 signal condensed into punctate 284 junctional ring - like structures surrounding the midbody and ultimately appearing to “lasso” the 285 midbody remnant during the final cleavage step ( i . e . , abscission ) ( Fig . 9D , far right ) . Progression 286 through cytokinesis was inferred by judging acetylated tubulin thickness and shape ( Fig . 9D , 287 middle panel ) , since a fluorescently - tagged LZTS2 stably expressed in MDCK cells was prone 288 to aggregation , challenging our ability to follow this process by live imaging ( not shown ) . 289 Since a - cat D M1 persistently sequesters LZTS2 to junctions , we wondered whether this mutant 290 might have consequences for LZTS2 enrichment at the midbody . Comparison of late - stage 291 cytokinesis images ( Fig . 9E , G ) revealed that 66 % ( 14 / 21 ) of midbodies from WT a - cat - restored 292 MDCK cells showed LZTS2 punctate ring - like enrichment , whereas fewer of these structures 293 were seen in a - cat D M1 - restored MDCK cells ( 46 % , 11 / 24 ) ( Fig . 9F ) . These data suggest that 294 persistent recruitment of LZTS2 to apical junctions may interfere with the normal recruitment 295 pattern of LZTS2 to apical midbody junctions . 296 a - cat D M1 shows enhanced binucleation rate over wild - type or other a - cat mutants 297 Evidence that a - cat D M1 persistently recruits LZTS2 from cytoplasmic and midbody junctions 298 raised the possibility this mutant would impact the fidelity of cell division . We grew WT a - cat and 299 M - domain mutant a - cat - restored MDCK cells on filters for 14 days and found that the a - cat D M1 300 mutant was associated with the highest rate of binucleation ( Fig . 10A - C ) , even compared with 301 other a - cat M - domain and FABD + mutants ( Fig . 1 , 3 and 4 ) . Thus , these data show that an a - 302 cat mutant that constitutively exposes M2 - M3 helices and sequesters LZTS2 from the midbody 303 is associated with binucleation , likely through a defect in cytokinesis . Importantly , the ability of 304 a - cat D M1 to promote binucleation is also seen when expressed in parental MDCK cells ( Fig . 305 S5 ) , suggesting this mutant can function as a dominant inhibitor of cytokinesis , likely through 306 sequestration of a factor required for this process ( i . e . , LZTS2 ) . Persistent recruitment of 307 vinculin driven by the a - cat D M2 , 3 mutant ( through exposing M1 helices for vinculin binding ) did 308 not appear to drive binucleation , although this mutant does appear to impact mitotic rounding 309 ( Fig . S6 ) , consistent with previous study ( Monster et al . , 2020 ) . Collectively , these data suggest 310 that a - cat mechanosensitivity is normally tuned to allow faithful cytokinesis and abscission , 311 11 where enhanced mechano - activation of a - cat’s M - domain might perturb this process through 312 persistent sequestration of the abscission factor , LZTS2 . 313 314 12 DISCUSSION 315 Studies suggest that an abortive cytokinesis program can serve as means to generate 316 multinuclear polyploid cells across a range of cell - types and conditions , particularly where extra 317 genome copies may be advantageous ( Bailey et al . , 2021 ; Øvrebø & Edgar , 2018 ; Schoenfelder 318 & Fox , 2015 ) . For example , cardiomyocytes become binucleated through a developmentally 319 timed defect in cytokinetic furrow progression ( Engel et al . , 2006 ; Normand & King , 2010 ; 320 Soonpaa et al . , 1996 ) ; macrophages multinucleate downstream of bacteria / Toll - Like Receptor 321 signals that antagonize cytokinesis ( Herrtwich et al . , 2016 ) . Even simple barrier epithelia 322 become binucleated after mechanical injury due to failed cytokinesis ( Cao et al . , 2017b ; Lazzeri 323 et al . , 2019 ; Weng et al . , 2022 ) , where increased DNA copies lead to larger cells that manifest 324 less junctional surface relative to epithelial area coverage resulting in reduced barrier leak 325 ( Cohen et al . , 2018 ; Peterson & Fox , 2021 ; Schoenfelder & Fox , 2015 ) . Collectively , these 326 observations suggest abortive cytokinesis programs may be a design feature of the mitotic 327 division to favor various adaptive outcomes . Mechanistically , excessive integrin - extracellular 328 matrix adhesive tension along epithelial wound fronts appears to be one cause of cytokinesis 329 failure , where exuberant stress fiber formation can interfere with contractility of the cytokinetic 330 ring leading to division failure ( Uroz et al . , 2018 , 2019 ) . Whether other mechanosensitive 331 players similarly interfere with cytokinesis has remained unclear . 332 In this study , we take advantage of rationally designed mutant forms of a - cat to implicate 333 adherens junction mechanosensitivity as a possible upstream mediator of cytokinetic fidelity . 334 We find that a force - desensitized a - cat actin - binding mutant ( a - cat - H0 - FABD + ) , which shows 335 enhanced binding to F - actin in vitro ( Ishiyama et al . , 2018 ) and stronger epithelial sheet integrity 336 through enhanced coupling to lower tension cortical actin networks ( Wood et al . , 2023 ) , can 337 interfere with cytokinesis . Since this interference is not observed in single cells or cells lacking 338 cadherins ( Fig . S1 ) , the a - cat - H0 - FABD + mutant likely promotes cytokinesis failure through 339 cadherin - catenin junction complexes engaged in cell - cell adhesion ( Le Bras & Le Borgne , 340 2014 ) , rather than exclusive extra - junctional homodimer functions . In addition , this interference 341 is not mediated by the a - cat ABD alone but requires both M - and H0 - FABD + domains to drive 342 cytokinesis failure . Thus , a normal functioning a - cat is required for cytokinesis fidelity in 343 epithelial monolayers . 344 Evidence the a - cat M - domain contributes to cytokinetic interference aligns with recent evidence 345 that heterozygous missense variants in CTNNA1 / a - cat ( M - domain ) cause a form of macular 346 13 dystrophy through driving an age - associated multinucleated epithelial phenotype ( Saksens et 347 al . , 2016 ) . Butterfly - shaped Pigmentary macular Dystrophy ( BPD ) is an autosomal dominant eye 348 disease characterized by bilateral accumulation of pigment in the macular area that resembles 349 the wings of a butterfly . Remarkably , a forward genetic screen for similar eye defects in mice 350 independently identified an a - cat M - domain missense mutation L436P , where Ctnna1 tvrm5 ( L436P ) 351 mice reveal earliest stages of disease pathogenesis may initiate through progressive 352 multinucleation of retinal pigment epithelial cells . While this phenotype was stronger in mice 353 homozygous for the Ctnna1 tvrm5 ( L426P ) mutation , RPE defects were also seen in heterozygotes , 354 suggesting a gene - dosage effect . It is important to note that cell - fusion is also a means to 355 generate multi - nuclear epithelial cells ( Bailey et al . , 2021 ; Øvrebø & Edgar , 2018 ; Gjelsvik et al . , 356 2019 ) , where fly L426P mutant a - cat appears to enhance this fusion phenotype after injury 357 ( Dehn et al . , 2021 ) . However , expression of BPD missense variants in MDCK is associated with 358 an elevated binucleation rate via cytokinesis failure ( Fig . 4 , Fig . S2 ) , suggesting different paths to 359 multi - nucleation across species . How a - cat mutants generate junction signals that serve to 360 sustain the polyploid state will require further investigation . 361 There are many routes to cytokinesis failure , the best - known involving reduced or elevated Rho - 362 signaling ( Kamijo et al . , 2006 ; Konstantinidis et al . , 2015 ; Lordier et al . , 2008 ; van de Ven et al . , 363 2016 ; Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . Curiously , a - cat mutants that interfere with M - or FABD 364 mechanosensitive functions lead to cytokinesis failures during the later stages of this process . 365 This suggests a - cat may interfere with abscission , which in polarized epithelia is apically biased 366 and must resolve in close proximity with apical junctions ( Osswald & Morais - de - Sá , 2019 ; Ott , 367 2016 ; Tassan et al . , 2017 ; Higashi and Miller , 2017 ; Bai et al . , 2019 ) . Consistent with this 368 model , we show that an a - cat M - domain salt - bridge mutant designed to mimic a constitutively 369 unfurled state ( i . e . , force - independent R551A mutant ( Barrick et al . , 2018 ) can recruit a 370 previously suggested “abscission factor” , Leucine Zipper Tumor Suppressor 2 ( LZTS2 ) 371 ( Johnson et al . , 2013 ; Maru , 2009 ; Sudo & Maru , 2007 ) , where persistent mechanosensitive 372 recruitment of LZTS2 to AJs may sequester LZTS2 from the midbody and its participation in 373 abscission ( Maru , 2009 ; Sudo & Maru , 2007 ) . While we and others find LZTS2 depletion leads 374 to binucleation , molecular details remain unclear . LZTS2 is a poorly understood scaffold protein 375 previously localized to centrosomes and midbody ( Sudo & Maru , 2007 ; Sudo and Maru , 2008 ) . 376 While there is some evidence LZTS2 is functionally linked to microtubule severing ( Sudo and 377 Maru , 2008 ; Maru , 2009 ) , recent proteomics screens also place LZTS2 within a protein network 378 centered around Afadin , another mechanosensitive binding partner of a - cat ( Baskaran et al . , 379 14 2021 ) . Future work is required to understand how this protein network dynamically interacts with 380 mechanosensitive cadherin - catenin adhesions to guide cytokinesis to completion . Evidence that 381 a - cat mechanosensitive mutants can interfere with cytokinesis , reinforces the idea that midbody 382 abscission critically depends on a tension release step ( Andrade et al . , 2022 ; Andrade & 383 Echard , 2022 ; Hatte et al . , 2017 ; Herbomel et al . , 2017 ; Lafaurie - Janvore et al . , 2013 ; Rabie et 384 al . , 2021 ) . 385 386 STUDY LIMITATIONS 387 Live imaging MDCK cells during cytokinesis , particularly the abscission step which resolves 388 apically in epithelia , is challenging for a system where the timing and location of division events 389 are not predictable across MDCK cell cultures . Thus , future work on the contribution of a - cat 390 mechanosensitivity to cell division will greatly benefit from a system where cells are large , 391 events are abundant , and the plane of division is uniformly oriented ( e . g . , as in cleaving 392 Xenopus embryos ) . 393 It is also important to disclose that the propensity of a - cat M - and FABD + mutants to interfere 394 with cytokinesis may be due to features of the MDCK a - cat KO / reconstitution system . Indeed , 395 a - cat CRISPR KO MDCK clone 2 . 2 ( and other clones ) show high levels of binucleation in up to 396 20 % of MDCK cells ( Fig . S7 ) . This finding was originally missed , because we largely focused 397 attention on GFP - a - cat WT and a - cat - mutant “rescue” MDCK cells . While we presume this 398 binucleation is due to cytokinesis failure , single cell imaging of a - cat KO cells led to few 399 captured events due to their reduced spreading capacity during live imaging and loss during 400 mitotic rounding ( Fig . S1 ) . Since GFP - a - cat WT and a - cat - mutant “rescued” a - cat CRISPR KO 401 MDCK cells show lower binucleation rates ( 2 % - 6 % ; Figs 1 and 10 ) , these data suggest normal 402 a - cat mechanosensitivity appears required for cytokinetic fidelity , where either loss of a - cat or 403 altered a - cat M - domain function can interfere with this process . 404 405 406 15 METHODS 407 Lentiviral plasmid generation and constructs 408 All GFP - a - cat constructs were synthesized by Vectorbuilder using the αE - catenin human 409 CTNNA1 sequence . The ability of eGFP to spontaneously dimerize and potentially impact a - cat 410 functions was disrupted by incorporating an A206K mutation ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ) ) . All 411 constructs listed in the Key Resources table will be submitted to Addgene with detailed vector 412 maps per NIH guidelines . 413 414 Cell culture and stable cell line selection 415 MDCK II cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM , Corning ) , 416 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Atlanta Biologicals or JRS Scientific ) , 100 U / ml 417 penicillin and 100 µ g / ml streptomycin ( Corning ) . a - cat / Ctnna1 knockout MDCK cells were 418 generated using CRISPR - Cas9 system as described in Wood et al . , 2023 BioRxiv . Briefly , RNA 419 guides were designed targeting a - cat sequences in exons 2 and 4 . Guide RNA ( gRNA ) 420 targeting different canine CTNNA1 exons were designed with CHOPCHOP online tools . 45 421 Sequences of oligonucleotides were as follows : 5’ - GAAAATGACTTCTGTCCACACAGG - 3’ 422 ( exon 2 , covering the MTSVHTG protein sequence ) and 5’ - AGTCTAGAGATCCGAACTCTGG - 423 3’ ( exon 2 , covering the SLEIRTLA sequence ) . Single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) , Cas9 nuclease 424 ( HiFi ) and duplex buffer were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . RNAs were 425 reconstituted and diluted to 5 μM with duplex buffer ; Cas9 protein to 10 μM with PBS . MDCK 426 cells were plated in 12 - well plates at a seeding density of 1 . 0 x 10 5 cells in 1 mL DMEM - 427 complete a day before . For one reaction , sgRNA ( 20 μL ) , Cas9 ( 15 μL ) , DMEM ( 30 μL , no 428 serum and antibiotics ) and Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( 4 μL , Invitrogen ) were mixed and incubated 429 at room temperature for 20 min . The complex was treated to the cells in complete medium and 430 incubated overnight at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 . The medium was changed and the cells were 431 allowed to recover for one day . Cells were split to maintain 30 - 50 % confluency . The sgRNA - 432 Cas9 treatment was repeated 3 times . Cells were expanded and sorted with a flow cytometer 433 ( FACSMelody , BD ) to 96 - well plates to grow single cell colonies . The colonies were screened 434 for low ( < 5 ng / well at confluent ) a - cat expression using a a - cat C - terminal antibodies . The 435 selected colonies were verified with western blot . Knockout cell line ( 2 . 2 clone ) was chosen 436 based on lowest level of a - cat isoform lacking N - terminal sequences . a - cat KO2 . 2 MDCK were 437 16 restored with wild - type and mutant a - cat forms by lentiviral infection , selected in puromycin 438 ( xug / uL ) . GFP - a - cat - positive cells were flow sorted to ensure even expression across 439 constructs . 440 441 Antibodies 442 The following primary antibodies were used : polyclonal rabbit anti - a - cat ( C3236 , Cell Signaling ) , 443 hybridoma mouse anti - a - catenin ( 5B11 , ( Daugherty et al . , 2014 ) ) , rabbit anti - GAPDH ( Cat # sc - 444 25778 , Santa Cruz , now discontinued ) , polyclonal rabbit anti - GFP ( A11122 , Invitrogen ) and 445 Phalloidin - 488 or - 568 ( A12379 , Invitrogen ) . Secondary antibodies for Western blotting included 446 HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse and - rabbit antibodies ( Bio - Rad ) , or fluorescently labeled 447 donkey anti - mouse and - rabbit antibodies ( 680RD or 800RD , LiCor Biosciences ) . Secondary 448 antibodies for immunofluorescence included IgG Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 - conjugated goat anti - 449 mouse or - rabbit antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . 450 451 Immunofluorescence and Imaging 452 Cells were grown on cell culture inserts ( Falcon ) , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron 453 Microscopy Services , Hatfield , PA ) for 15’ , quenched with glycine , permeabilized with 0 . 3 % 454 Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) , and blocked with normal goat serum ( Sigma ) . Primary and secondary 455 antibody incubations were performed at RT for 1h , interspaced by multiple washes in PBS , and 456 followed by mounting coverslips in ProLong Gold fixative ( Life Technologies ) . Images of a - cat & 457 F - actin localizations were captured with Nikon A1R Confocal Laser Point Scanning microscope 458 using NIS Elements software ( Nikon ) with GaAsP detectors and equipped with 95B prime 459 Photometrics camera , Plan - Apochromat 60x / 1 . 4 objective . Confocal Z - stacks were taken at step 460 size of 0 . 3 µ m . 461 Scratch wound assay 462 For Fig . 1F - H , Fig . 4C - D , MDCK cells were plated for 10days on 12 - well Falcon cell culture 463 inserts ( BD Falcon 353494 ; high - density 0 . 4 µ m ) , wounded with vacuum suction pipette , rinsed 464 with PBS , and recovered in complete DMEM media for 40hrs before fixation & immunostaining 465 ( see immunofluorescence and imaging section for details ) . For Fig . S2B - C , cells were imaged 466 on Nikon Biostation IM - Q with the slide holder module as previously described ( Ishiyama et al . , 467 17 2018 ) . Briefly , MDCK cells were plated for 24hr on LabTek # 1 4 - well chamber slide ( 43300 - 776 , 468 Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , wounded with vacuum suction P200 micropipette tips and recovered 469 for 2hrs . Prior to imaging , complete DMEM media was replaced with FluoroBright DMEM ( Life 470 Technologies ) . Cells were imaged with 20X objective every 10min ( both phase contrast and 471 fluorescent channels ) on Biostation IM - Q at 37C , 5 % CO2 , for 16hrs . 4 fields of view ( FOV ) were 472 captured along the wound edge . Instrument controlled by Biostation IM software , version 2 . 21 473 build 144 . 474 Biotin ligase ( BioID ) screen for a - cat M - domain proximity partners 475 BirA * - a - cat fusion proteins were generated using wild - type a - cat and the R551A salt - bridge 476 mutant previously established to enhance a - cat accessibility to tension - sensitive partners , such 477 as vinculin ( Ishiyama et al . , 2013 ) . Plasmids were expressed in HEK293 T - REx cells and 478 subjected to LC - MS / MS . Since WT a - cat recovered more spectra than the a - cat R551A mutant , 479 we applied a total spectral count - based normalization . We forced only proteins detected with a 480 SAINT FDR ≤1 % in one of the conditions to be visualized , and only those proteins detected with 481 at least 5 spectra in 1 condition are displayed . 482 483 484 485 486 18 Key resources Table 487 REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Antibodies Anti - a - catenin Cell Signaling Cat # 3236 Anti - a - catenin ( 5B11 ) https : / / www . pnas . org / doi / 10 . 107 3 / pnas . 1308663111 LZTS2 rabbit polyclonal antibody Proteintech 15677 - 1 - AP Acetylated - tubulin ( 6 - 11B - 1 ) mouse monoclonal Sigma - Aldrich T7451 Vinculin ( mouse monoclonal ) Sigma - Aldrich V9131 Phalloidin - Far Red Invitrogen A22287 GAPDH Santa Cruz Cat # sc - 25778 Anti - GFP Invitrogen A11122 Alexa Fluro 568 phalloidin Invitrogen Cat # A12380 Alexa Fluro 488 phalloidin Invitrogen Cat # A12379 Goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 Invitrogen Cat # A11008 Goat anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 568 Invitrogen Cat # A11004 HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse BioRad Cat # 1706516 HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit BioRad Cat # 1706515 Donkey anti - mouse LiCor Biosciences P / N 925 - 68072 Donkey anti - rabbit LiCor Biosciences P / N : 926 - 32213 Chemicals , Peptides , and Recombinant Proteins Hoechst 33342 ThermoFisher Scientific Cat # 62249 ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant ThermoFisher Scientific Cat # P36934 Experimental Models : Organisms / Strains Madin - Darby canine kidney II cells Gumbiner Lab ( 1996 ) Heidelberg strain ( Kai Simmons Lab ) A431D cells Troyanovsky Lab E - cad negative variant of A431 epidermoid skin cancer Software and Algorithms FIJI / ImageJ ( version : 2 . 1 . 0 / 1 . 53c ) Schneider , CA et al . , 2012 https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / Graphpad Prism https : / / www . graphpad . com / scien tific - software / prism / Other BioStation Slide Holder Nikon Instruments Axioplan2 epifluorescence microscope Zeiss ; 20x objective ( Air ) AxioCAM HR Camera with AxioVision 4 . 8 software A1R Confocal Nikon Instruments Laser Point Scanning , GaAsP detectors , Plan - Apochromat 60x / 1 . 4 objective Plasmids LV - monomeric EGFP - a E - catenin ( WT , missense , M - domain and FABD mutants ) Gottardi Lab Vectorbuilder ; Will submit to Addgene with vector maps LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ Wild - type LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ H0 - FABD + ( RAIM 669 - 672 > GSGS ) LV - mEGFP : hCTNNA1 _ D M - domain D 273 - 635 19 LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ D M1 - domain D 271 - 396 LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ D M2 , 3 - domain D 397 - 509 LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ D Nii domain LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ R551A M2 - M3 salt - bridge disrupting mutant LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ L436P Ctnna1 eye phenotype via forward genetic screen LV - mEGFP : h CTNNA1 _ E307K CTNNA1 butterfly eye mutant 488 20 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 489 This work relied on the following Northwestern University services and core facilities : Center for 490 Advanced Microscopy ( NCI CCSG P30 CA060553 , NCRR 1S10 RR031680 , 1S10OD021704 ) 491 and Flow Cytometry ( NCI CA060553 , 1S10OD011996 , 1S10OD026814 ) . 492 Funding : CJG is supported by GM129312 and HL163611 .

This 499 generates an a - cat that binds F - actin more strongly ( + + + ) than a - cat ( + ) via in vitro pelleting 500 assays ( Ishiyama , 2018 ) .

Asterisk ( * ) marks an a - cat fragment generated by our 503 CRISPR - targeting strategy via an alternative translational start site ( L C Bullions et al . , 1997 ) . 504 As this a - cat isoform lacks the b - cat binding region and fails to robustly localize to cell - cell 505 contacts ( Wood et al . , 2023 ) , it does not likely contribute to the cytokinesis interference pathway 506 in this study .
