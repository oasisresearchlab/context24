ORIGINAL ARTICLE The protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP - 1 / PTPRJ promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis K Spring 1 , 4 , P Fournier 1 , 4 , L Lapointe 1 , C Chabot 1 , J Roussy 1 , S Pommey 1 , J Stagg 1 , 2 and I Royal 1 , 3 DEP - 1 / PTPRJ is a receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase mainly known for its antiproliferative and tumor - suppressive functions . Many identi ﬁ ed substrates are growth factor receptors , and DEP - 1 is deleted and / or mutated in human cancers including that of the breast . However , DEP - 1 was also identi ﬁ ed as a promoter of Src activation and proinvasive functions in the endothelium , suggesting it could perhaps mediate breast cancer invasiveness that is likewise driven by Src family kinases . We show here that DEP - 1 expression was greater in highly invasive breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB - 231 , Hs578T , BT - 549 ) than in the less invasive or untransformed cell lines tested ( MCF - 7 , T47D , SK - BR3 and MCF10A ) . DEP - 1 silencing experiments in invasive cells demonstrated that moderately expressed and catalytically active DEP - 1 was required , in collaboration with basal epidermal growth factor receptor activity , for Src activation and the phosphorylation of its substrate Cortactin , and for their colocalization at the cell ’ s leading edge . This correlated with an increased number of cell protrusions , and an enhanced capacity of the cells to migrate and invade . Similarly , moderate overexpression of DEP - 1 in the low - invasive cells resulted in the promotion of their invasiveness in an Src - dependent manner . Consistent with these data , the expression of endogenous DEP - 1 was elevated in a bone metastatic cell line derived from MDA - MB - 231 cells , and promoted increased Src Y418 and Cortactin Y421 phosphorylation , as well as pro - MMP9 secretion and Matrigel invasion . Importantly , the silencing of DEP - 1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells greatly decreased their ability to metastasize , despite having no effect on tumor growth or angiogenesis . Hence , we found that moderate expression of DEP - 1 was associated with the increased relapse and decreased survival of breast cancer patients . These results therefore identify a new and unsuspected role for DEP - 1 as a mediator of an invasive cell program implicating Src activation and the promotion of breast cancer progression . Oncogene ( 2015 ) 34 , 5536 – 5547 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2015 . 9 ; published online 16 March 2015 INTRODUCTION Protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) are important antagonists of tyrosine kinase - dependent signaling , and they regulate various biological responses such as cell proliferation , migration and transformation . 1 , 2 Although mainly regarded as negative regula - tors with tumor - suppressive functions , increasing evidence demonstrates that PTPs can also exhibit positive and oncogenic roles depending on the cellular context . 1 , 3 DEP - 1 / PTPRJ / CD148 is a receptor - like PTP reported to be mutated or deleted in human breast , colon , lung , thyroid and meningioma cancers , as well as in hematological malignancies including non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma . 4 – 8 In addition , single - nucleotide polymorphisms in the extracellular domain of DEP - 1 have been associated with the risk of developing several cancers , further suggesting a prominent role for DEP - 1 in tumorigenesis . 3 , 9 – 12 Increased expression of DEP - 1 has been associated with the negative regulation of cell proliferation and transformation , and with the induction of cell differentiation . 8 , 13 – 18 Consistent with these roles and with the enriched localization of DEP - 1 at adherens junctions , 19 many substrates of DEP - 1 are cell – cell adhesion proteins 20 – 22 and receptor tyrosine kinases . 13 , 22 – 27 In contrast , DEP - 1 was also shown to regulate positively various biological functions , including B - cell and macrophage develop - ment , platelet activation , cell adhesion and angiogenesis , through its ability to dephosphorylate the inhibitory tyrosine residue of Src family kinases ( Y529 in Src ) and allow their autophosphorylation and activation ( Y418 in Src ) . 24 , 28 – 31 Src family kinases induce many cellular processes such as proliferation , migration / invasion and survival , 32 , 33 and are often overexpressed or overactivated in cancers including that of the breast , where they promote cancer progression and metastasis . 34 – 42 Most breast cancer deaths are due to the formation of metastases in the bones , lungs and brain . 43 , 44 Gene expression pro ﬁ ling of breast tumors has identi ﬁ ed distinct molecular subgroups that can be broadly distinguished based on their expression of ER ( estrogen receptor ) , PR ( progesterone receptor ) and HER2 ( epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) . 45 About 15 % of diagnosed breast cancers do not express these receptors , and are de ﬁ ned as ‘ triple - negative ’ breast cancers ( TNBCs ) . 46 , 47 These are generally more aggressive , and affected patients have faster relapses and a poor clinical outcome . 46 Signaling networks activated by growth factor receptors ( such as epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ) and Src family kinases are enriched in this subgroup of tumors , as well as in other subtypes of drug - resistant aggressive tumors , where they mediate increased proliferation , invasion and epithelial – mesenchymal transition . 42 , 47 – 53 Here , we show that DEP - 1 , in collaboration with EGFR , promotes the activation of Src and the invasion of aggressive breast cancer 1 CRCHUM – Centre de recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l ' Université de Montréal , Institut du Cancer de Montréal , Montréal , QC , Canada ; 2 Faculty of Pharmacy , Université de Montréal , Montréal , QC , Canada and 3 Department of Medicine , Université de Montréal , Montréal , QC , Canada .

Importantly , we also show for the ﬁ rst time that DEP - 1 levels in breast tumor cells correlate with their ability to metastasize , and with the increased risk of breast cancer patients to relapse and die from their disease . RESULTS DEP - 1 expression is higher in invasive breast cancer cells and mediates Src activation DEP - 1 has been described as an inhibitor of cell proliferation and a tumor suppressor in many types of cancers . 8 , 13 – 18 However , we demonstrated that DEP - 1 could also positively modulate Src activity and proangiogenic functions such as invasion in vascular endothelial growth factor - stimulated endothelial cells . 24 , 31 , 54 As Src activation is associated with breast cancer progression and increased invasiveness , 34 , 35 , 36 – 41 we therefore investigated if DEP - 1 might also promote this pathway in breast cancer cells . As a starting point , the expression level of DEP - 1 was evaluated in highly invasive ( TNBC cell lines expressing high levels of EGFR : MDA - MB - 231 , Hs578T and BT - 549 ) or less invasive cell lines ( ER / PR - positive cell lines T47D and MCF - 7 , and the HER2 - positive SK - BR3 cell line ) . Surprisingly , despite the tumor suppressor functions of DEP - 1 , a moderate but higher DEP - 1 expression was detected in the more invasive cell lines compared with the less invasive or non - tumorigenic MCF10A breast cells ( Figures 1a and b ) . Similarly , analysis of gene expression data ( Oncomine cancer pro ﬁ ling database ) 55 also showed that DEP - 1 was preferentially expressed in invasive carcinomas compared with normal breast tissue ( Figure 1c ) . Interestingly , DEP - 1 expression in the breast cancer cell lines tested did not correlate with the level of basal Src activation ( Figure 1a ) . However , the ef ﬁ cient silencing of DEP - 1 ( average of 80 – 90 % decrease ) with two small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) impaired the activating phosphorylation of Src on Y418 in the aggressive cell lines , but not in the less invasive ones ( Figure 1d and e ) . These ﬁ ndings demonstrate that greater expression of DEP - 1 is detected in highly invasive breast cancer cells , and that this is critical for the basal phosphorylation / activation of Src . DEP - 1 promotes proinvasive signaling in MDA - MB - 231 and Hs578T cells Activated Src can induce a proinvasive signaling pathway in cancer cells , via the tyrosine phosphorylation of its target Cortactin , which promotes actin polymerization and lamellipodia stabilization during directed cell migration , matrix metallopro - tease and extracellular matrix secretion , and metastasis . 56 – 61 To ﬁ nd out if DEP - 1 expression was regulating this pathway , the phosphorylation of Src and Cortactin was assessed in DEP - 1 - silenced MDA - MB - 231 and Hs578T cells . Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 1 show that Src dephosphorylation on Y529 and phosphorylation on Y418 were decreased in DEP - 1 - silenced cells following fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) stimula - tion compared with control cells . Consistent with this , the phosphorylation of Cortactin on the Src - dependent tyrosine 421 residue was similarly impaired . As membrane - associated Src and Cortactin promote the formation and stabilization of membrane protrusions in response to growth factor stimulation , 56 , 59 , 62 , 63 we next investigated their cellular localization in sparsely seeded control and DEP - 1 - silenced MDA - MB - 231 cells upon stimulation with FBS . Immuno ﬂ uores - cence staining experiments revealed that phosphorylated Src and Cortactin were enriched in membrane protrusions of control cells where DEP - 1 was also concentrated ( Figure 2b ) . However , this protein enrichment as well as the number of cell protrusions were greatly decreased in DEP - 1 - depleted cells . These results demon - strate that DEP - 1 is implicated in the formation of membrane protrusions in breast cancer cells , and that this most likely involves its ability to mediate Src and Cortactin activation in these membrane domains . DEP - 1 expression is required for the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells The previous results suggested that DEP - 1 might function as a mediator of breast cancer cell migration and invasion . To test this , control and DEP - 1 - silenced MDA - MB - 231 and Hs578T cells were ﬁ rst submitted to a scratch assay . Figure 3a shows that gap closure was delayed in DEP - 1 - depleted cells compared with controls . The silencing of DEP - 1 also strongly decreased their invading capacity into Matrigel ( Figure 3b ) . In contrast , the invasiveness of the less aggressive T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells , which express low levels of DEP - 1 , was not affected by its silencing ( Figure 3c ) . However , moderate overexpression of DEP - 1 in these cells promoted Src activation and Matrigel invasion , which were both abrogated by the Src inhibitor PP2 ( Figure 3d ) . These results highlight for the ﬁ rst time that concomitant with its ability to activate Src , endogenously expressed DEP - 1 promotes the promigratory and proinvasive functions of highly invasive breast cancer cells . Moreover , they further show that its moderate overexpression in less aggressive cells is suf ﬁ cient to stimulate their invasiveness in an Src - dependent manner . Catalytically active DEP - 1 promotes MDA - MB - 231 cell invasion , but not cell proliferation , in an Src - and EGFR - dependent manner To demonstrate that the phosphatase activity of DEP - 1 and its ability to activate Src were critical for the invasion of highly aggressive breast cancer cells , rescue experiments were per - formed . MDA - MB - 231 cells were ﬁ rst infected with lentiviruses encoding control ( shScramble ) or two DEP - 1 short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) ( Figure 4a ) . The knockdown of DEP - 1 expression led as expected to reduced Src and Cortactin basal activation , although shRNA 2872 was more potent . Consistent with this , the invasive capacities of both shDEP - 1 cell populations were proportionally inhibited ( Figure 4a ) . In contrast , despite the fact that DEP - 1 has mainly been described as an inhibitor of cell proliferation , 5 , 8 , 13 – 17 no difference in the proliferation of control and shDEP - 1 cells was observed for up to 4 days in culture ( Figure 4b ) . Re - expression of WT DEP - 1 in shDEP - 1 cells restored Src and Cortactin phosphor - ylation ( Figures 4c and d ) . However , no signi ﬁ cant rescue was observed upon re - expression of the catalytically inactive DEP - 1 C / S mutant or the DEP - 1 Y1311F / Y1320F mutant that is unable to interact with and activate Src . 31 Consistent with these results , only WT DEP - 1 was able to promote the invasion of shDEP - 1 MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 4d ) . Still , as previously reported in endothelial cells , 31 only moderate but not excessive levels of DEP - 1 could promote Src activation and MDA - MB - 231 cell invasion ( Figure 4e and Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Moreover , we also observed that incubation of the shDEP - 1 2872 MDA - MB - 231 cells re - expressing WT DEP - 1 with PP2 and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 similarly abrogated DEP - 1 - induced Src signaling and cell invasion ( Figure 4f ) . Collectively , these results demonstrate that basal EGFR activity contributes with moderately expressed and catalytically active DEP - 1 to promote Src and Cortactin activation required for MDA - MB - 231 cell invasion . DEP - 1 expression is increased in a metastatic explant of MDA - MB - 231 cells An essential step for cancer progression is the ability of tumor cells to metastasize at distant sites . Src activity drives the formation of breast cancer metastases , 37 – 39 , 41 , 64 , 65 and was reported to be increased in a bone metastatic explant of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( 1833 variant ) . 37 Based on our results linking DEP - 1 expression to Src activation and cell invasion , we ﬁ rst investigated if DEP - 1 expression was also elevated in this metastatic cell line . Role of DEP - 1 / PTPRJ in invasion and metastasis K Spring et al 5537 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 5536 – 5547 Figure 5a shows that Src Y418 phosphorylation was increased in 1833 cells compared with the parental MDA - MB - 231 cells , as shown previously . 37 Interestingly , DEP - 1 expression was also higher in this cell line , and correlated with increased Cortactin phosphorylation , consistent with the greater ability of 1833 cells to invade Matrigel ( Figure 5b ) . Conversely , DEP - 1 silencing blocked Src and Cortactin activation ( Figure 5c ) , and signi ﬁ cantly impaired cell invasion and the secretion of pro - MMP - 9 ( Figures 5d and e ) . Thus , higher DEP - 1 expression in the metastatic explant 1833 cell line correlates with enhanced Src - dependent proinvasive signaling . DEP - 1 is not required for tumor growth or neovascularization , but induces an Src - dependent invasive signaling pathway in tumors and promotes breast cancer metastasis As cell migration and invasion are key steps of tumor cell metastasis , we investigated the role of DEP - 1 during in vivo tumor growth using the MDA - MB - 231 control and shDEP - 1 cell popula - tions . Consistent with our in vitro proliferation data , no signi ﬁ cant differences in tumor volumes were observed between NSG ( NOD scid gamma ) mice injected with control or shDEP - 1 2872 MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 6a ) . We also did not see any changes in the extent of tumor vascularization ( Figure 6b ) . However , western blot analyses demonstrated that phosphorylation of Src and Cortactin was impaired in DEP - 1 - silenced tumors ( Figure 6c ) . Consistent with these results , the presence of lung metastases in mice bearing DEP - 1 - silenced tumors was greatly reduced ( Figure 6d ) . Importantly , a similar trend was observed following the injection of shDEP - 1 2870 MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Despite a less ef ﬁ cient silencing of DEP - 1 in these cells ( Figures 4a and 6 and Supplementary Figure 3 ) , a proportional decrease in Src signaling and lung metastatic burden was observed . Altogether , these data demonstrate that DEP - 1 does not mediate the proliferative and angiogenic functions of MDA - MB - 231 tumor cells , but importantly show for the ﬁ rst time that it can promote breast cancer metastasis . Moderate DEP - 1 expression correlates with decreased survival of breast cancer patients To test if there was a correlation between DEP - 1 expression levels in invasive breast cancers and the severity of the disease , we ﬁ rst investigated the expression of DEP - 1 in relation to disease - speci ﬁ c survival in a cohort of patients with invasive breast cancer ( GSE3494 data set downloaded from NCBI ’ s Gene expression Omnibus ) . As only moderate expression of DEP - 1 promoted activation of the Src invasive pathway in breast cancer cells ( Figure 4e and Supplementary Figure 2 ) , tumors were classi ﬁ ed into ‘ high ’ , ‘ intermediate ’ and ‘ low ’ expressing groups , represent - ing the 25 % top , 50 % intermediate and 25 % lowest DEP - 1 expressers , respectively . Kaplan – Meier analysis demonstrated that the disease - speci ﬁ c survival of patients whose tumors expressed intermediate levels of DEP - 1 was signi ﬁ cantly worse ( Figure 7a ; P = 0 . 024 ) . A similar analysis was also performed on a cohort of lymph - node - negative patients that provided relapse - free survival times ( GSE2034 data set ) . Although results were not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( P = 0 . 107 ) , moderate expression of DEP - 1 ( here , the 70 % intermediate expressers ) was also associated with the highest probability to relapse ( Figure 7b ) .

Role of DEP - 1 / PTPRJ in invasion and metastasis K Spring et al 5538 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 5536 – 5547 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited suggest that the ability of moderately expressed DEP - 1 to activate the proinvasive Src pathway correlates with an increased probability of breast cancer patients to develop distant metastases and die from their disease . DISCUSSION PTPs are emerging as critical regulators of breast cancer initiation and progression . 66 – 72 In this study , we demonstrate for the ﬁ rst time that higher levels of DEP - 1 are detected in invasive breast cancer cells , and importantly promote their ability to invade and form metastases . We show that this is due to the capacity of moderately expressed DEP - 1 , in collaboration with EGFR , to activate the Src kinase and the downstream phosphorylation of Cortactin , a pathway that is closely associated with breast cancer progression . 34 , 38 , 39 , 50 , 51 , 57 , 73 Further supporting these ﬁ ndings , we show that moderate expression of DEP - 1 correlates with the increased relapse and decreased survival of breast cancer patients ( see model in Figure 7c ) . The results presented here were somewhat unexpected considering that DEP - 1 has mainly been reported to behave as a tumor suppressor . 4 – 8 , 14 – 17 However , our group previously demon - strated that in endothelial cells , moderately expressed DEP - 1 promotes Src activation in response to angiogenic growth factors , p Y421 Cortactin siCTL siDEP - 1 5 % FBS DEP - 1 p Y418 Src Src Cortactin 0’ 5’ 10’ 0’ 5’ 10’ MDA - MB - 231 non - p Y529 Src siCTL siDEP - 1 5 % FBS Hs578T DEP - 1 p Y418 Src non - p Y529 Src Src p Y421 Cortactin Cortactin 0’ 5’ 10’ 0’ 5’ 10’ siCTL siDEP - 1 DEP - 1 p Y418 Src Src siCTL siDEP - 1 DEP - 1 Cortactin Merge p Y421 Cortactin Merge a b Figure 2 .

Role of DEP - 1 / PTPRJ in invasion and metastasis K Spring et al 5541 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 5536 – 5547 motile and invasive cellular capacities . 58 – 60 , 74 – 76 The decreased phosphorylation of Cortactin in the DEP - 1 - silenced MDA - MB - 231 and Hs578T cells therefore demonstrates that a fundamental promigratory and proinvasive pathway is controlled by DEP - 1 in these cells . In that same line of thought , the increased expression of DEP - 1 in a highly invasive metastatic explant derived from MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 5 ) , and its role in promoting higher Src activity , pro - MMP9 secretion and invasive capacity , strongly supports a contribution for DEP - 1 to the enhanced metastatic potential of these cells . Accordingly , we showed that DEP - 1 expression in MDA - MB - 231 cells was required for the ef ﬁ cient formation of metastases in NSG mice ( Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Based on our accumulated data , we conclude that this was mainly due to the increased invasive capacities of the cells mediated by expression of DEP - 1 . Consistent with our experimental data , analysis of clinical data sets indicated that intermediate expression of DEP - 1 in invasive breast cancers correlated with faster relapse and the decreased survival of patients . In contrast , the groups of patients whose tumors expressed the lowest and highest levels of DEP - 1 were both found to have a better outcome ( Figure 7 ) . In light of what we have shown in vitro and in vivo , where DEP - 1 - silenced cells or cells overexpressing the highest levels of DEP - 1 are unable to activate the Src invasive pathway , we propose that tumors within these two groups were signi ﬁ cantly less aggressive possibly because of the repressed activation of this pathway . Similar survival analyses were performed by Smart et al . , 8 and despite the fact that tumors expressing intermediate levels were not included in their study , both ‘ high ’ and ‘ low ’ groups of patients from one cohort also had a similar overall survival probability . Unfortunately , a too small number of TNBCs included in the cohorts we analyzed precluded any conclusions to be drawn with respect to DEP - 1 expression and survival in this particular tumor subtype . However , in addition to their involvement in TNBCs , Src and EGFR also mediate breast cancer progression in hormone - resistant cancers , 50 , 51 suggesting a general relationship between DEP - 1 expression and the progression to highly aggressive breast cancers . Also consistent with this hypothesis , DEP - 1 expression was found to be higher in the most invasive breast cancer cell lines and carcinomas compared with less invasive cells or normal breast tissues evaluated ( Figures 1 and 5 ) , and its overexpression in the less invasive cancer cell lines ( SK - BR3 and T47D ) was suf ﬁ cient to promote their increased invasiveness in an Src - dependent manner ( Figures 1 and 3 ) . Collectively , our results therefore suggest that moderate expression of catalytically active DEP - 1 and the downstream activation of the Src pathway are linked to the promotion of a proinvasive and prometastatic phenotype in breast cancer cells .

Role of DEP - 1 / PTPRJ in invasion and metastasis K Spring et al 5542 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 5536 – 5547 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited We have observed that the reduced expression of DEP - 1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells had no impact on their proliferation in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 4 and 6 and Supplementary Figure 3 ) . This is in contrast to several studies demonstrating that DEP - 1 negatively regulates the proliferation of cell types including breast cancer cells . 8 , 14 – 18 This might be due in part to the delocalization of DEP - 1 from its substrates in these cells . Indeed , MDA - MB - 231 cells have lost E - cadherin expression and their adherens junctions , which is a potential site of interaction for DEP - 1 with its receptor tyrosine kinase substrates , such as EGFR . 19 , 77 shScramble shDEP - 1 H & E 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 shScramble shDEP - 1 DEP - 1 p Y418 Src PLCγ Src p Y421 Cortactin Cortactin EGFR IHC : CD31 shScramble shDEP - 1 Figure 6 .

Role of DEP - 1 / PTPRJ in invasion and metastasis K Spring et al 5543 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 5536 – 5547 The constitutive activation of downstream proliferative path - ways , such as K - Ras in MDA - MB - 231 cells , 78 might also overcome the negative regulation of growth - promoting receptors by DEP - 1 . In addition , polymorphisms and mutations in the DEP - 1 gene could perhaps alter the growth - suppressive functions of DEP - 1 , while still allowing Src activation and the manifestation of its proinvasive functions . 4 , 5 , 9 – 12 Indeed , a mutation potentially affecting the ability of DEP - 1 to associate with ERK1 / 2 ( extra - cellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ) was found to be highly enriched in a brain metastasis , suggesting that its capacity to inactivate this pathway and proliferation might be affected in these conditions . 79 Thus , alterations of DEP - 1 activity during cancer progression might represent an advantage for tumor cells , allowing them to respond to the selective pressure towards Src activation and the formation of metastases . In conclusion , we report for the ﬁ rst time that through its ability to activate Src , DEP - 1 can promote a proinvasive phenotype in breast cancer cells that is associated with their ability to metastasize . This identi ﬁ es DEP - 1 as a possible predictor of the risk to develop metastases and die from breast cancer , and as a potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches . It will be of interest to determine if DEP - 1 similarly promotes the progression of other types of cancers also shown to rely on Src family kinases . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfection Breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( Wisent , St Bruno , QC , Canada ) , supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Invitrogen , Burlinglton , ON , Canada ) and 50 μ g / ml gentamycin ( Wisent ) . The parental MDA - MB - 231 and metastatic 1833 variant were generously provided by Dr Joan Massagué ( New York , NY , USA ) . 37 For siRNA experiments , cells were transfected with DEP - 1 Hs _ PTPRJ _ 3 _ HP and Allstars control siRNAs ( Qiagen , Toronto , ON , Canada ) , or with siGENOME PTPRJ siRNA no . 6 and siGENOME Non - Targeting siRNA Pool no . 2 ( Dharmacon / GE Healthcare , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) at a ﬁ nal concentration of 25 n M using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . For rescue and overexpression experiments , cells were transfected with 3 μ g per 60 mm dish cDNAs and 10 μ l of Lipofectamine 2000 . Sixteen hours after transfection , cells were either serum - starved overnight and then stimu - lated with 5 % FBS , or immediately processed for cell invasion assays or lysed . Cells were incubated for 2 h with PP2 ( 10 μ M ; 4 - amino - 5 - ( 4 - chlorophenyl ) - 7 - ( t - butyl ) pyrazolo [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine ) , AG1478 ( 2 μ M ; 4 - ( 3 - chloroanilino ) - 6 , 7 - dimethoxyquinazoline ) or DMSO ( dimethylsulfoxide ) ( all from Sigma - Aldrich , Oakville , ON , Canada ) before cell lysis . The empty pmT2 , WT DEP - 1 and C / S DEP - 1 vectors were generously provided by Dr Nick Tonks ( Cold Spring Harbor , NY , USA ) . The DEP - 1 Y1311F / Y1320F mutant construct was described previously . 50 For the generation of shRNA stable cell populations , MDA - MB - 231 cells were infected with lentiviruses encompassing scramble or DEP - 1 shRNA sequences ( pLKO . 1 vector ) , and selected in the presence of puromycin ( 5 μ g / ml ) for 3 weeks . The scramble P = 0 . 024 Figure 7 . Moderate expression of DEP - 1 is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients . Correlation between DEP - 1 gene expression levels and disease - speci ﬁ c survival ( a ) , or relapse - free survival ( b ) of breast cancer patients were made using the Uppsala ( GSE3494 ; n = 251 ) and Rotterdam ( GSE2034 ; n = 286 ) gene microarray data sets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database . Survival data of breast cancer patients from these cohorts were classi ﬁ ed based on their DEP - 1 expression levels into three groups : ‘ low ’ , ‘ intermediate ’ and ‘ high ’ , encompassing the 25 % top , 50 % intermediate and 25 % lowest expressers for the GSE3494 cohort , and the 15 % top , 70 % intermediate and 15 % lowest expressers for the GSE2034 cohort . Kaplan – Meier survival and statistical analyses ( log - rank test ) were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 . ( c ) Summary model of the function of DEP - 1 in invasive breast cancer . Moderate expression of DEP - 1 in invasive breast tumors stimulates an Src - dependent signaling pathway in collaboration with EGFR . This leads to the activation / phosphorylation of Cortactin in membrane protrusions , and promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis . As EGFR is a substrate of DEP - 1 , 26 additional reciprocal regulation ( dashed arrows ) may also possibly contribute to this pathway . Role of DEP - 1 / PTPRJ in invasion and metastasis K Spring et al 5544 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 5536 – 5547 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited construct was a gift from David Sabatini ( Addgene vector ID 1864 ; Addgene , Cambridge , MA , USA ) , and the DEP - 1 shRNAs ( TRCN 2870 and TRCN 2872 ) were purchased from GE Healthcare / Dharmacon ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) . Western blot Cells were lysed and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously . 24 Primary antibodies used were : anti - p Y421 Cortactin , non - p Y529 Src and p Y418 Src ( from Invitrogen ) , and anti - Cortactin ( clone 4F11 ; EMD - Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) , anti - DEP - 1 ( clone 143 - 41 ; R & D Systems Minneapolis , MN , USA ) , anti - Src ( clone 36D10 ) , anti - pY1173 EGFR ( Cell Signaling Technology , New England Biolabs , Whitby , ON , Canada ) , anti - EGFR ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , Dallas , TX , USA ) and anti - PLC γ ( phospholipase C γ ; Upstate / EMD - Millipore ) . Horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cell signaling Technology . Scratch assay Forty hours after transfection , the cell monolayer was wounded to create three scratches . Pictures were taken immediately after scratching at two microscopic ﬁ elds per scratch ( t 0 ) . Cells were allowed to migrate for 22 h , until gaps in the monolayer of control cells were ﬁ lled by 80 – 90 % ( t ﬁ nal ) . Cells were then ﬁ xed with phosphate - buffered formalin and stained overnight with crystal violet ( 0 . 1 % in 20 % methanol ) . The microscopic ﬁ elds that were photographed at t = 0 were again photographed at 22 h . Wound closures were quanti ﬁ ed using Image - Pro Plus software ( Version 5 . 1 ; Media Cybernetics , Bethesda , MD , USA ) and Microsoft Excel . Gap widths at t 0 and t ﬁ nal were measured , and the average gap width ratio ( t ﬁ nal / t 0 ) of DEP - 1 - depleted cells was normalized to that of control cells . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Twenty - four hours after transfection , cells were plated on glass coverslips ( 2×10 5 cells ) for 24 h . Serum - starved cells were stimulated with 5 % FBS for 10 min , and then ﬁ xed in paraformaldehyde 4 % ( in phosphate - buffered saline ) for 20 min , followed by permeabilization with Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 1 % in phosphate - buffered saline ) for 10 min . Antibodies were diluted as indicated in blocking solution ( 5 % FBS / 3 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate - buffered saline ) and incubated 1 h on cells : anti - DEP - 1 ( clone 143 - 41 ; 1 : 50 ) , pY418Src ( 1 : 50 ) , Src ( clone GD11 ; 1 : 50 ) , p Y421 Cortactin ( 1 : 50 ) , Cortactin ( 1 : 100 ) , Alexa 350 - labeled anti - goat IgG , Alexa 488 - labeled anti - mouse IgG and Alexa 594 - labeled anti - rabbit IgG ( Invitrogen ; 1 : 500 ) . Photos were taken on an Olympus FV1000MPE confocal microscope ( Richmond Hill , ON , Canada ) using a Plan SAPo 60X / 1 . 3 NA objective . Quantitative analysis of the membrane localization of proteins was performed in six microscopic ﬁ elds at the ×20 magni ﬁ cation . The number of cells with membrane protrusions or localization of proteins in these membrane domains were determined and normalized to that observed in control cells . Experiments were performed in triplicate , and 100 – 200 cells were analyzed per experiment . Invasion assay This assay was performed as described . 31 Cells ( MDA - MB - 231 and 1833 variant at 5×10 4 , Hs578T cells at 2×10 4 and SK - BR3 and T47D at 1×10 5 ) were allowed to invade for 20 h . The lower chamber was ﬁ lled with 800 μ l of Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium containing 5 % FBS . Final concentrations of Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) used were : 3 . 8 mg / ml ( MDA - MB - 231 and 1833 variant ) , 3 . 7 mg / ml ( Hs578T ) and 1 mg / ml ( T47D and SK - BR3 ) . Experiments were performed at least three times in duplicate . In - gel zymography Conditioned media were collected and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The volume of medium loaded on the gel was normalized to the protein concentration of the corresponding cell lysate . Gelatin - containing gels ( 0 . 1 % ) were washed two times in 2 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min and once with developing buffer containing 50 m M Tris - HCl , 5 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 M NaCl and 0 . 02 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min . Gels were incubated overnight at 37 °C , and then stained with Coomassie blue and destained until areas where gelatin was digested were visible . Cell proliferation assay Cells were plated in 6 - well plates in triplicates . At each time point ( 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 h ) , they were trypsinized and resuspended in complete medium , and then diluted in CASYton solution , as recommended by the manufacturer ( Roche Innovatis AG , Bielefeld , Germany ) . Cell counts were made using a CASY cell counter ( Roche Innovatis AG ) . Tumor and metastasis assay Cells were injected in 8 - week - old female NSG mice ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) as described by Iorns et al . 17 Tumor growth was measured every 3 days using a caliper . Primary tumors were ﬁ xed in formaldehyde ( 3 . 7 % in phosphate - buffered saline ) and embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Blood vessel density was quanti ﬁ ed by immunohistochemistry on 5 μ m tumor sections using a CD31 antibody ( clone M - 20 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ( two slices per tumor ; six animals per group ) . Alternatively , tumors were lysed in RIPA buffer , and total cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Lungs were snap frozen in OCT . The lung metastatic burden was de ﬁ ned on hematoxylin - and eosin - stained 5 μ m cryosections using Photoshop ( Adobe Systems Canada , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) as the lung surface occupied by tumor cells relative to the total lung surface . Survival analyses from microarray studies Affymetrix data sets ( GSE3494 and GSE2034 ) were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus ( www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo ) . Clinical data were ranked according to DEP - 1 expression levels ( probe 214137 _ at ) , and patients were segregated in three groups ( ‘ low ’ , ‘ intermediate ’ and ‘ high ’ ) based on a 25 / 50 / 25 % ratio for the GSE3494 data set , and on 15 / 70 / 15 % ratio for the GSE2034 data set . The Kaplan – Meier method was used to calculate the survival and relapse - free survival rates , which were compared using the two - sided log - rank test . Analyses were performed with the GraphPad Prism 6 . 0 software ( GraphPad Software Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Data analysis Densitometry analyses were performed with the Quantity One 4 . 6 . 3 software ( Bio - Rad , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was evaluated with the unpaired t - test using GraphPad Prism 6 . 0 software . P - values o 0 . 05 were considered to be signi ﬁ cant .
