R . China Received September 10 , 2015 ; Accepted October 22 , 2015 ; Epub November 1 , 2015 ; Published November 15 , 2015 Abstract : Gelsolin ( GSN ) , which is a Ca 2 + - dependent actin filament severing and capping protein , plays a critical role in the cancer progress and has the potential for providing a novel thread for cancer therapy . In current study , we demonstrate the roles of GSN on anti - apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cells by transcriptome RNA - seq method . Then flow cytometry ( FCM ) , in - cell immunoblotting and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) were used to ex - amine the GSN regulatory cell apoptosis . The results revealed GSN significantly suppresses apoptosis - associated functional categories through down - regulating apoptosis - associated genes in 5 apoptosis terms and 6 relevant KEGG pathways . FCM showed a significant lower apoptotic rate in GSN - SMMC7721 ( P < 0 . 05 ) . In - cell immunoblot - ting detected discrepant expression of the apoptosis factors among GSN expressed / shRNA transfectants ( P < 0 . 05 ) . TEM observed the discernible apoptosis morphology . Above results suggest a negative relationship between GSN expression and hepatocarcinoma cell apoptosis . GSN overexpression suppresses apoptosis while down - regulated GSN promotes apoptosis . The possible mechanism could be associated with the regulation of GSN on the apoptosis - associated pathways and the apoptosis factors caspase 3 and bcl - 2 . Keywords : Hepatocarcinoma , transcriptomics , RNA - seq , gelsolin , anti - apoptosis Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most common form of primary cancer of liver . In terms of numbers , HCC is the sixth most malig - nant cancer worldwide ( estimated 711 , 000 cases annually ) ; however , due to its poor prog - nosis ( survival rates 3 - 5 % in cancer registries ) , HCC is the third most common cause of cancer death [ 1 , 2 ] . In our previous study , we revealed that GSN is a potential HCC serum biomarker through iTRAQ - MALDI - MS / MS technology [ 3 ] . Moreover , other reports also suggested GSN plays important roles in the biological process - es of cancerization [ 4 , 5 ] . As for the correla - tions between GSN and HCC , however , were still unclear . As a Ca 2 + - regulated actin filament severing and capping , gelsolin ( GSN ) is a widespread , poly - functional regulator of cell structure and metab - olism [ 6 ] . Research data showed that GSN was ubiquitously expressed in various kinds of cells [ 7 - 11 ] , in spite of the variations of expression levels during cell differentiation [ 12 , 13 ] and carcinogenesis [ 5 , 14 - 24 ] . A recent understand - ing of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of GSN might lead to new considerations of this protein as a potential biomarker and / or thera - peutic target of tumor . High levels of GSN expression were thought to be an independent marker for tumor recurrence and progression [ 25 ] . Actually , increased GSN expression was found to correlate with invasion in HCC [ 26 ] and small cell lung cancer [ 27 ] , and higher tumor Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13872 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 grade in renal cell carcinoma [ 28 ] . In human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells , overexpression of GSN inhibited the nuclear localization of p53 , repressed apoptosis and negatively regu - lated transcriptional activity of a reporter con - struct in the cytoplasm [ 29 ] . Intriguingly , in uro - thelial and oral carcinomas , GSN exhibits a biphasic expression profile , being down - regu - lated in premalignant lesions but increased in higher grade lesions . 24 Furthermore , the co - expression of GSN with erb - B2 and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer [ 30 ] . It is likely that the role of GSN differs during the course of tumor progression , and in more advanced dis - ease GSN may cooperate with other oncogenic factors to accelerate disease progression . Recent development of the next - generation sequencing technologies makes RNA - seq become a powerful approach in defining the molecular mechanism of specific diseases with the advantage of analyzing abnormal transcrip - tome at genome - wide level [ 31 , 32 ] . Previous applications of RNA - seq with greater efficiency and higher resolution [ 33 ] than other expres - sion profiling technologies included yeast [ 34 ] , viruses [ 35 ] , tissues [ 36 ] and cell lines [ 37 ] . For cancer expression profiling , the reprogramming of the transcriptome leads to aberrant cellular behavior and thus directly contributes to can - cer progression [ 38 ] . Monitoring the cancer transcriptome not only enables us to fill in the gap between gene regulation and cancer cell behavior , but also allows us to identify the underlying mechanism [ 39 , 40 ] . Despite the prevalence of using RNA - seq to study various cancer pathogenetic mecha - nisms [ 41 - 43 ] , the deep transcriptome descrip - tions of HCC and the roles of GSN in HCC are scarcely mentioned . We therefore applied RNA - seq technology to analyze the transcriptomics and to determine the roles of GSN in hepatocel - lular carcinoma . Through bioinformatics analy - sis , we revealed the role of GSN on suppressing HCC apoptosis and explored the possible regu - latory mechanism . Materials and methods Cell culture and recombinant plasmid DNA HCC cell line SMMC7721 cells were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology , Chinese Academy of Sciences . Stable SMMC7721 cell lines in which GSN were either up - regulated by plasmids containing full length of GSN cDNA or down - regulated by the short hairpin RNA recombinant plasmids , and their control transfectants induced by empty vector plasmids were all established by our institute . RT - PCR and in - cell immunoblotting were used to determine the GSN expression levels and were carried out in triplicate . Transcriptome sequencing Stable GSN expressed cells ( GSN - SMMC7721 ) and parent SMMC7721 were used to explore the cell transcription . RNA was extracted from about 1×10 7 cells respectively , according to the manufacturer’s instruction , and quantified by NanoDrop 2000 ( Thermo - Fisher Scientific ) . The whole transcriptome RNA - seq was constructed using Ion Total RNA - Seq Kit v2 , Ion PI™ Chip kit v2 , Ion PI™ Template OT2 200 Kit v2 , and Ion PI™ Sequencing 200 Kit v2 based on the Life Technologies Corporation’s guide . We per - formed two runs of sample repetition . In brief , mRNA was purified using oligo - dT beads from 100 μg of total RNAs for each sample and frag - mented into small fragments . The cleaved RNA fragments were reverse - transcribed into first strand cDNA , followed by second - strand cDNA synthesis . After end - repair procedure , a single ‘A’ base was added to cDNA fragments at 3’end . The cDNAs were then ligated to adapters , enriched by PCR to generate the final cDNA library . After amplifying sequencing template , RNA - seq was performed using Ion proton sys - tem ( Life Technologies Corporation ) with the standard protocol . FCM analysis GSN overexpressed ( GSN - SMMC7721 ) , shRNA down - regulated ( shGSN - SMMC7721 ) , and their empty vector transfected cells ( NC1 - SM - MC7721 and NC2 - SMMC7721 ) were used to examine the GSN - related apoptosis . After tryp - sinized , approximately 1×10 6 cells were collect - ed by centrifugation at 1200 g for 5 min , and then washed in PBS , followed by resuspension in apoptosis detection buffer for about 0 . 5 h in dark . Cells were stained by propidium iodide ( PI ) and Annexin - V , and analyzed by FCM using Cell quest software ( BD Biosciences ) . The experiment was carried out in triplicate . In - cell immunoblotting GSN - SMMC7721 , shGSN - SMMC7721 , NC1 - SMMC7721 and NC2 - SMMC7721 were seeded on 96 - well plate until they reached logarithmic Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13873 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13874 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 Figure 1 .

After incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C , the cells were sequentially incubated with corresponding second infrared labeled antibodies for 2 h in dark place . Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( LI - COR Biosciences GmbH ) was used to obtain the image and analyze the target protein expres - sion , which was calculated as the ratio of the i ntensity of target protein to that of GAPDH . The experiments were carried out in triplicate . TEM observations GSN down - regulated cells induced by shRNA transfection were used to observe the GSN - affected apoptosis morphology .

The observed cells were dropped on a copper mesh coated with an amorphous carbon film for TEM observations . The experiment was carried out in triplicate . Statistical analysis Results are expressed as means ± standard error . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistics software ( SPSS ) . P - value < 0 . 05 is considered statistically significant . Results Transcriptome sequencing gained superior sequences GSN expression recombinant plasmid was transfected into hepatocarcinoma SMMC7721 cell line and then treated with puromycin for the selection of stable cell lines . We performed real - time PCR and in - cell immunoblotting to confirm the overexpression of GSN . The experi - ments were carried out in triplicate . The target GSN expression was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of target to that of GAPDH . As expected , GSN level was increased in the GSN - SMMC7721 cell line ( Figure 1A , 1B ) . Then , RNA - seq was carried out to analyze the tran - scriptional differences . We performed two runs of sample repetition . On completion , 75 . 9 mil - lion 109 bp long sequencing reads and 88 . 4 million 119 bp long sequencing reads were generated in two runs of repetition , and that corresponded to an 8 . 2G and 10 . 5G raw sequence data respectively ( Figure 1CI , 1CII ) . Samples in both above repetitive runs of tran - scriptome RNA - seq gained > 50 M superior sequences that could be utilized in downstream analysis . Enrichment analysis confirmed 341 mutual DEGs To estimate gene expression abundance , we conducted an enrichment analysis to estimate the gene expression and identify significantly dysregulated genes . The results showed that approximate 50000 genes were detected in each run and the DEGs were 515 and 546 respectively . The normalized gene expression was measured by Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped ( FPKM ) ( Figure 2A , 2B ) . In addition , the clustering anal - ysis indicated that the transcriptome of GSN overexpressed SMMC7721 cells was distinct from the parental control ( Figure 2C ) . The over - lapping of the mutual DEGs between two runs reached up to 341 and was shown as a Venn diagram in Figure 2D . DEGs involved in 116 functional categories . To better understand the function of DEGs , we conducted an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology for the dysregulated genes . To identify the functional categories , we first performed GO categories using online tools from WEGO . Three hundred forty one DEGs involved in 63 GO classifications including cellular compo - nent , molecular function , and biological pro - cess were enriched ( Figure 3A ) . A further analy - sis of functional annotation was achieved by studying the enrichment of DEGs in Cog catego - ries , which revealed 20 function classifications of consensus sequences ( Figure 3B ) . For GO categories provided informative DEGs in each gene ontology term and liable to cancer - specif - ic analysis , we counted the significantly up - and down - regulated DEGs in terms from the compo - nent ontology with corrected p - value better than 1 . In total , all DEG were categorized into approximately 116 functional categories , con - taining 40 up - regulated GO categories and 28 down - regulated GO categories ( Figure 4 ) . Cancer - specific functional filter highlighted a GSN effect on cell apoptosis Interestingly , although we identified approxi - mate numbers of up - and down - regulated terms in the functional enrichment analysis , we observed clues of significant GO categories for GSN overexpressed SMMC7721 cells , suggest - ing that the increased GSN might functionally important for cancer progression . For example , the DEGs expression in the GO terms for “apop - totic process” is mainly significantly sup - pressed , the same trend can also be found in the gene catalog of “DNA damage response , signal transduction by p53 class mediator resulting in induction of apoptosis” , “JNK cas - cade” , “cellular response to interleukin - 3” , and “cysteine - type endopeptidase activator activity involved in apoptotic process” , which indicates that GSN might affect apoptosis of cancer cells . Then we focused on the apoptosis - related DEGs annotation and particular pathway so as Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13878 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 to seek for the evidences of GSN’s regulatory effect in HCC apoptosis . The results showed that in all the 13 mutual apoptosis - related DEGs of two runs , 9 pro - apoptotic genes includ - ing PSME2 , PTK2B , FOS , JUN , ITGB1 , MAP2K7 , MAP3K4 , MAP3K12 and Rac1 were down - regu - lated , and RRM2B , as a anti - apoptotic gene was up - regulated ( Table 1 ) . Above 10 apopto - sis - associated DEGs participated in the pro - cess of anti - apoptosis , and simultaneously plays important roles in 6 apoptosis - related pathways ( antigen processing and presenta - tion , natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity , p53 signaling pathway , pathways in cancer , Jak - STAT signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway ) ( Table 2 ) . We further paid attention to mutual association between the above apoptosis pathways . The results suggested that among above 6 apopto - sis - related pathways , except antigen process - ing and presentation pathway , Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity , JAK - STAT signaling path - way , P53 signaling pathway and pathways in Figure 4 .

The red or blue rectangles indicated over 60 % up - or down - regulated DEGs were in the corresponding terms . Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13879 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 cancer all interacts with MAPK - JNK signaling pathway . We also noticed that the regulation of MAPK - JNK pathway for apoptosis is carried out through P53 signaling pathway , which finally affects apoptosis through terminal apoptosis - associated factors such as caspase 3 , bcl - 2 and cytochrome C . GSN inhibited hepatocarcinoma cell apoptosis We then generated the stable GSN overexpres - sion cell line ( GSN - SMMC7721 ) and stable GSN knock down cell line ( shGSN - SMMC7721 ) , as 0 . 72±0 . 11 , 3 . 48±0 . 25 , and 4 . 20±0 . 18 respec - tively in GSN - SMMC7721 . The early , late and total apoptosis rates were 9 . 97±1 . 01 , 5 . 44± 0 . 98 , 15 . 41±1 . 26 respectively in shGSN - SMMC7721 . The late and total apoptosis rates in GSN overexpressed SMMC7721 cells were lower than those of the NC1 - SMMC7721 ( P < 0 . 05 ) . And the early and total apoptosis rates in shGSN - SMMC7721 cells were higher than those of the NC2 - SMMC7721 ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 5 ) . In - cell immunoblotting showed the expression of caspase 3 was down - regulated 0 . 625± 0 . 133 ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and the expression of Table 1 .

FCM , in - cell immunoblotting and TEM were per - formed , and were carried out in triplicate . The results of FCM showed the early , late and total apoptosis rates were Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13880 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 bcl - 2 was up - regulated 4 . 138±0 . 857 ( P < 0 . 05 ) in GSN - SMMC7721 while comparing to NC1 - SMMC7721 .

But the expression of cytochrome C was invariable while GSN was overexpressed / inhibited ( Figure 6 ) . Finally , TEM confirmed the discernible apop - tosis morphology in the GSN shRNA transfec - tant , including apoptotic body , autophagy , early apoptosis , late apoptosis and oncosis ( Figure 7 ) . Overall , above results suggest a negative rela - tionship between GSN expression and hepato - carcinoma cell apoptosis . Overexpressed GSN Figure 5 . Apoptosis detection through flow cytometry .

The experiments were carried out in triplicate .

Discussion Transcriptome bridges the gap between the genetic codes and the functional molecule pathways . By comparing transcriptomics between normal and cancerous cells , it is able to determine what genes are turned on or off in disparate biological process and gain a deeper understanding of what constitutes a specific cell type and how changes in transcriptional activity may reflect or contribute to disease pro - gression . Comparative transcriptomics has been applied to many human pathological stud - ies such as neurodegenerative disease [ 44 ] , retina defection [ 45 ] , prostate cancer [ 46 ] , and colorectal cancer [ 47 ] . For hepatocarcinoma transcriptome , Huang et al performed tran - scriptome analyses for 10 matched pairs of cancer and non - cancerous tissues from HCC patients on Solexa / Illumina GAII platform [ 48 ] . About 21 . 6 million sequencing reads and 10 . 6 million aligned reads were obtained and 1 , 378 significantly DEGs were annotated . Additionally , comprehensive functional analysis indicated that cell growth - related , metabolism - related and immune - related pathways are most signifi - cantly enriched by DEGs , pointing to a complex mechanism for HCC carcinogenesis . In another study , David et al detected five hundred DEGs from HCC cells , and the further gene ontology analysis indicated that the over - expressed genes were associated with inflammation , drug resistance and lipid metabolism [ 49 ] . Figure 6 . Expression of apoptosis factors caspase 3 , bcl - 2 , and cytochrome C . ( A ) In - cell immunoblotting detect - ed the expression level of caspase 3 , bcl - 2 , and cytochrome C in GSN - SMMC7721 , shGSN - SMMC7721 , NC1 - SM - MC7721 and NC2 - SMMC7721 . The experiments were carried out in triplicate . ( B ) Experiments were performed as in ( A ) , the results showed the expression of caspase 3 was down - regulated 0 . 625±0 . 133 ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and the expres - sion of bcl - 2 was up - regulated 4 . 138±0 . 857 ( P < 0 . 05 ) in GSN - SMMC7721 while comparing to NC1 - SMMC7721 . The expression of caspase 3 was up - regulated 1 . 908±0 . 257 ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and the expression of bcl - 2 was down - regulated 0 . 411±0 . 122 ( P < 0 . 05 ) in shGSN - SMMC7721 while comparing to NC2 - SMMC7721 . But the expression of cyto - chrome C was invariable while GSN was overexpressed / inhibited . Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13882 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 Our study was mainly focusing on GSN regula - tory HCC transcription through next - generation RNA - seq technology . The results revealed a regulator role of GSN in hepatoma cell apopto - sis . We noticed 5 functional categories with 13 relevant DEGs , which relate to cell apoptosis , are mainly restrained and might play important roles in 6 apoptosis - related pathways . This observation provide hint for the potential mech - anism of how GSN regulate apoptosis . Interestingly , among all of the 13 mutual apop - tosis - related DEGs , 7 DEGs including PTK2B , FOS , JUN , RAC1 , MAP2K7 , MAP3K4 , MAP3K12 enriched in MAPK - JNK signaling pathway are down - regulated . Meanwhile , except antigen processing and pre - sentation pathway , all other 4 apoptosis - relat - ed pathways such as Natural killer cell mediat - ed cytotoxicity , JAK - STAT signaling pathway , P53 signaling pathway and pathways in cancer all interacts with MAPK - JNK signaling pathway . Both observations strongly suggest that GSN might suppress apoptosis through the cross - linking of above pathway , while MAPK - JNK path - way might played central roles in the GSN - regulated apoptosis . We also noticed that the regulation of MAPK - JNK pathway for apoptosis is carried out through P53 signaling pathway , which finally affects apoptosis through terminal apoptosis - associated factors such as caspase 3 , bcl - 2 and cytochrome C . We detected the expression of above apoptosis factors through in - cell immunoblotting . The results suggest the dis - crepant expression of caspase 3 and bcl - 2 in GSN up - / down - regulated hepatocarcinoma cells . But the expression of cytochrome C was not changed in the test . Previous reports eluci - dated the role of GSN as an anti - apoptotic pro - tein in mitochondrial - dependent cell death due to the inositol lipids PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 prevent caspase 3 cleavage of GSN in vitro . Through the formation of a stable PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - GSN - Caspase 3 complex , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - GSN strongly inhibited caspase - 3 activity [ 50 ] . Except caspase 3 , GSN affects actin - depen - dent VDAC , which is thought to be a target of bcl - 2 family members [ 51 ] . Though the release of cytochrome C is considered as an important factor for mitochondria initiated apoptosis , and GSN is thought to be an apoptosis inhibitor by blocking mitochondrial membrane potential loss and cytochrome c release , we did not detect the expression change of cytochrome C . We guessed the result might be accord with the theory that the release of cytochrome C could not be relative to its expression level . Figure 7 . Observation of apoptosis morphology . A .

Gelsolin inhibits apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells 13883 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2015 ; 8 ( 11 ) : 13871 - 13885 The structural changes of cytoskeletal proteins ( such as GSN ) in apoptosis circumstance leads to the transmogrification of cells , for instance , chromatin condensation , nuclear fragmenta - tion , cell membrane blebbing , and apoptotic body formation . Early studies showed that there is a tight connection between skelemin change and the apoptosis morphology [ 52 - 55 ] . In our study , we observed the GSN - derived morphology of apoptosis through TEM . According to the previous reports , dissociation of GSN products a NH2 - extreme of 352aa , which induces cells turned round , fallen off , and splintered in a Ca 2 + independent mode . The observation of TEM suggests that as the regulator and effector of apoptosis , GSN might regulate cell apoptosis through acting on the cytoskeleton and actin activity . In conclusion , GSN overexpression suppresses apoptosis while down - regulated GSN promotes apoptosis in human HCC cells . The regulation of GSN in the apoptosis of hepatoma cell main - ly involves several important pathway such as natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity , p53 sig - naling pathway , pathways in cancer , Jak - STAT signaling pathway and MAPK signaling path - way . Caspase 3 and bcl - 2 are two pivotal apop - tosis factors regulated by GSN . These findings suggest a role for GSN in HCC and a potential of using GSN for the treatment of this malignancy .
