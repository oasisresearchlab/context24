The only known dedicated membrane fission machinery in 35 bacteria , FisB , is expressed during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis and is required to 36 release the developing spore into the mother cell cytoplasm . Here we characterized the 37 requirements for FisB - mediated membrane fission . FisB forms mobile clusters of ~ 12 38 molecules that give way to an immobile cluster at the engulfment pole containing ~ 40 39 proteins at the time of membrane fission . Analysis of FisB mutants revealed that binding 40 to acidic lipids and homo - oligomerization are both critical for targeting FisB to the 41 engulfment pole and membrane fission . Experiments using artificial membranes and 42 filamentous cells suggest FisB does not have an intrinsic ability to sense or induce 43 membrane curvature but can bridge membranes . Finally , modeling suggests homo - 44 oligomerization and trans interactions with membranes are sufficient to explain FisB 45 accumulation at the membrane neck that connects the engulfment membrane to the 46 rest of the mother cell membrane during late stages of engulfment . Together , our results 47 show that FisB is a robust and unusual membrane fission protein that relies on homo - 48 oligomerization , lipid - binding and the unique membrane topology generated during 49 engulfment for localization and membrane scission , but surprisingly , not on lipid 50 microdomains , negative - curvature lipids , or curvature - sensing . 51 .

This process requires dynamic localization of specialized proteins , which 56 generate the work required to merge membranes 9 - 13 . Dynamin 14 and the endosomal 57 sorting complex required for transport III ( ESCRT - III ) catalyze many eukaryotic 58 membrane fission reactions 15 . Both fission machineries bind acidic lipids , assemble into 59 oligomers , and use hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate ( GTP or ATP ) to achieve 60 membrane fission . However , membrane fission can also be achieved by friction 16 , 61 stress accumulated at a boundary between lipid domains 17 , forces generated by the 62 acto - myosin network 18 - 21 or protein crowding 22 . By contrast , very little is known about 63 membrane fission in bacteria , even though they rely on membrane fission for every 64 division cycle . 65 We previously found that fission protein B ( FisB ) is required for the final membrane 66 fission event during sporulation in B . subtilis 23 . When nutrients are scarce , bacteria in 67 the orders Bacillales and Clostridiales initiate a developmental program that results in 68 the production of highly resistant endospores 24 . Sporulation starts with an asymmetric 69 cell division that generates a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore ( Figure 1A ) . The 70 mother cell membranes then engulf the forespore in a process similar to phagocytosis . 71 At the end of engulfment , the leading membrane edge forms a small pore . Fission of 72 this membrane neck connecting the engulfment membrane to the rest of the mother cell 73 membrane releases the forespore , now surrounded by two membranes , into the mother 74 cell cytoplasm ( Figure 1A , B ) . At this late stage the mother nurtures the forespore as it 75 prepares for dormancy . Once mature , the mother cell releases the spore into the 76 environment through lysis . Spores can withstand heat , radiation , drought , antibiotics , 77 and other environmental assaults for many years 25 - 28 . Under favorable conditions , the 78 spore will germinate and restart the vegetative life cycle . 79 Conserved among endospore - forming bacteria , FisB is a mother - cell transmembrane 80 protein expressed under the control of the transcription factor , σ E , after asymmetric 81 division 29 . In sporulating cells lacking FisB , engulfment proceeds normally but the final 82 membrane fission event , detected using a lipophilic dye , is impaired 23 ( Figure 1C , F and 83 S1 Appendix Fig . 1A ) . During engulfment , FisB fused to a fluorescent protein forms dim , 84 mobile clusters in the engulfment membrane ( Figure 1D , E , Movie 1 ) . When the 85 engulfing membranes reach the cell pole , approximately 3 hours ( t = 3h ) after the onset 86 of sporulation , a cluster of FisB molecules accumulates at the pole forming a more 87 intense , immobile focus , where and when fission occurs ( Figure 1D , E , Movie 2 ) . 88 We had previously reported 23 that FisB interacts with cardiolipin ( CL ) , a lipid enriched at 89 cell poles 30 - 32 whose levels increase during sporulation 33 and is implicated in membrane 90 fusion 34 - 36 and fission reactions 37 . In addition , CL was reported to act as a landmark for 91 the polar recruitment of the proline transporter ProP , and the mechanosensitive channel 92 MscSm 38 , 39 . Thus , it seemed plausible that CL could act as a landmark to recruit FisB to 93 the membrane fission site and facilitate membrane fission . Apart from this hypothesis , 94 no information has been available about how FisB localizes to the membrane fission 95 site and how it may drive membrane scission . 96 .

Using quantitative analysis , we find small clusters 98 of ~ 12 FisB molecules diffuse around the mother cell membrane and ~ 40 copies of FisB 99 accumulate at the fission site as an immobile cluster to mediate membrane fission . 100 When FisB expression was lowered , ~ 6 copies of FisB were sufficient to drive 101 membrane fission , but fission took longer . Unexpectedly , FisB dynamics and membrane 102 fission are independent of both CL and phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , another lipid 103 implicated in membrane fusion and fission . We found FisB binds phosphatidylglycerol 104 ( PG ) with comparable affinity as CL , after adjusting for charge density . Thus , we 105 suspect that , as a more abundant lipid in the cell , PG can substitute for CL to bind FisB . 106 We tested other factors that may be important for the sub - cellular localization of FisB 107 and membrane fission . We found FisB dynamics are independent of flotillins , which 108 organize bacterial membranes into functional membrane microdomains 40 , cell wall 109 synthesis machinery , and proton or voltage gradients across the membrane . Using 110 mutagenesis , we show that both FisB oligomerization and binding to acidic lipids are 111 required for proper localization and membrane fission . B . subtilis ΔfisB cells were 112 partially complemented by C . perfringens FisB , despite only ~ 23 % identity between the 113 two proteins , suggesting a common localization and membrane fission mechanism 114 based on a few conserved biophysical properties . The membrane neck that eventually 115 undergoes fission and where FisB accumulates is the most highly curved membrane 116 region in the late stages of engulfment . Thus , FisB could potentially localize at the 117 membrane neck due to a preference for highly curved membrane regions . We tested 118 this possibility in experiments with both artificial giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) and 119 live cells . Surprisingly , these experiments failed to reveal any intrinsic affinity of FisB for 120 highly curved membranes . However , we found that FisB bridges membranes and 121 accumulates at membrane adhesion sites . Using modeling , we found that self - 122 oligomerization of FisB , coupled with its ability to bridge negatively charged membranes 123 is sufficient to explain its localization to the membrane neck . Thus , proteins can localize 124 to highly curved membrane regions through mechanisms independent of intrinsic 125 curvature sensitivity . Together , these results suggest FisB - FisB and FisB - lipid 126 interactions , combined with the unique membrane topology generated at the engulfment 127 pole during sporulation , provide a simple mechanism to recruit FisB to mediate 128 membrane fission independent of other factors . 129 130 RESULTS 131 Membrane fission occurs in the presence of a cluster of FisB molecules 132 To correlate FisB dynamics with membrane fission , we devised a labeling strategy that 133 allowed us to monitor both simultaneously , using a modified version of a fission assay 134 developed previously 41 . In this assay , synchronous sporulation is induced by placing B . 135 subtilis cells in a nutrient - poor medium . At different time points after the nutrient 136 downshift , aliquots are harvested from the culture , stained with the lipophilic membrane 137 dye FM4 - 64 , mounted on an agar pad , and imaged using fluorescence microscopy . The 138 dye is virtually non - fluorescent in the medium , and it cannot cross the cell membrane . 139 Thus , before fission , FM4 - 64 labels the outer leaflet of both the mother cell and the 140 forespore membranes . After fission , only the outer leaflet of the mother cell is labeled 141 .

Because post - fission cells and cells that never entered 142 sporulation are labeled identically , in addition to FM4 - 64 , a fluorescent protein is 143 expressed in the forespore under the control of the forespore - specific transcription 144 factor σ F to distinguish between the two cell types 42 ( S1 Appendix Figure 1B ) . This 145 makes it challenging to monitor FisB dynamics simultaneously , which requires a third 146 channel . As an alternative , we used another lipophilic dye , TMA - DPH , that has partial 147 access to internal membranes but can distinguish between pre - and post - fission stages 148 without need for a forespore reporter 23 ( Figure 1C and S1 Appendix Fig . 1D - G ) . Using 149 TMA - DPH as the fission reporter , we quantified the percentage of cells that have 150 undergone fission as a function of time , for wild - type , fisB knock - out ( ΔfisB , strain 151 BDR1083 , see S1 Appendix Table 2 for strains used ) , and ΔfisB cells complemented 152 with FisB fused to monomeric EGFP ( mGFP - FisB , strain BAM003 ) as shown in Figure 153 1D and 1F . These kinetic measurements reproduced results obtained using FM4 - 64 ( S1 154 Appendix Figure 1C ) . Thus , TMA - DPH can be used as a faithful reporter of membrane 155 fission , leaving a second channel for monitoring dynamics of FisB fused to a fluorescent 156 reporter . 157 In the experiments of Figure 1D and 1F , we simultaneously monitored dynamics of 158 mGFP - FisB and membrane fission . We found that membrane fission is almost always 159 accompanied by an intense , immobile mGFP - FisB signal at the engulfment pole ( Figure 160 1D , time = 3hr into sporulation ) . This intense spot at the engulfment pole ( ISEP ) is 161 distinct from the dimmer , mobile clusters ( DMC ) that appear at earlier times elsewhere 162 ( Figure 1D ) . By 3 h into sporulation , around 70 % of the cells expressing mGFP - FisB at 163 native levels had an ISEP ( Figure 1G ) , a number that was close to the percentage of 164 cells that had undergone fission by then ( Figure 1F ) . Scoring individual cells , we found 165 > 90 % ( 212 / 235 ) of cells that had undergone membrane fission also had an ISEP . 166 We also monitored membrane fission and mGFP - FisB signals in a strain with lower FisB 167 expression . Here , lower FisB expression is achieved by reducing the spacing between 168 the ribosome binding site ( RBS ) and the ATG start codon 43 . In this strain ( BAL003 ) , 169 there was an initial delay in the fraction of cells that had undergone fission , but fission 170 accelerated after t = 3 h to reach near wild - type levels at around t = 4h ( Figure 1E , F ) . The 171 fraction of cells with an ISEP followed a similar pattern ( Figure 1G ) . The fraction of cells 172 that had undergone fission at a given time was strongly correlated with the fraction of 173 cells with an ISEP at that time ( Figure 1H ) . Scoring individual cells , we found > 93 % 174 ( 258 / 277 ) of cells that had undergone membrane fission had an ISEP . We conclude that 175 membrane fission occurs in the presence of a large immobile cluster of FisB molecules 176 at the site of fission . 177 178 About 40 FisB molecules accumulate at the engulfment pole to mediate 179 membrane fission 180 We asked how many copies of FisB are recruited to the engulfment pole at the time of 181 membrane fission and how this number is affected by the expression level . For this 182 quantification , we used DNA - origami based fluorescence standards we recently 183 developed 44 . These standards consist of DNA rods ( ~ 410 nm long and 7 nm wide ) 184 labeled with AF647 at both ends and a controlled number of mEGFP molecules along 185 .

For each type of rod , the average total 188 fluorescence intensity of single - rods was computed and plotted against the number of 189 mEGFP molecules per rod , generating the calibration curve in Figure 2D . We generated 190 B . subtilis cells expressing mEGFP - FisB at native levels ( BAL001 ) in a ΔfisB 191 background so that images of these cells obtained under identical imaging conditions as 192 for the calibration curve in Figure 2D could be used to compute mEGFP - FisB copy 193 numbers . We imaged mEGFP - FisB cells at t = 3 h after sporulation was induced . From 194 these same images , we estimated the total fluorescence of dim , mobile clusters ( DMC ) 195 and ISEP in B . subtilis cells as a sum of background - corrected pixel values ( Figure 2C ) . 196 Using the average values of these total intensities , we estimate ~ 40 copies at the ISEP , 197 and ~ 12 per DMC from the calibration in Figure 2D . From the total intensity of cells ( S1 198 Appendix Fig . 2E ) , we also estimate there are ~ 1000 FisB molecules per cell . Two 199 independent estimates , based on B . subtilis calibration strains 45 and quantitative 200 immunoblotting , resulted in slightly larger and smaller estimates of these copy numbers , 201 respectively ( S1 Appendix and S1 Appendix Figs . 2 , 3 ) . 202 We tracked the DMC to estimate how rapidly they move . From the tracks , we calculated 203 the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) as a function of time ( Figure 2E ) . The short - time 204 diffusion coefficient estimated from the MSD is 𝐷 ! " # ≈ 2 . 8 × 10 $ nm % / s ( 95 % 205 confidence interval CI = 2 . 76 − 2 . 85 × 10 $ nm % / s ) . This value is comparable to the 206 diffusivity of FloA and FloT clusters of ~ 100 nm with 𝐷 ≈ 6 . 9 × 10 $ and 4 . 1 × 10 $ μ m 2 / s , 207 respectively 46 . By comparison , ISEP have 𝐷 & ’ ( ) ≈ 28 nm % / s ( CI = 22 . 9 − 33 . 1 nm % / s ) , two 208 orders of magnitude smaller . 209 We performed similar estimations of FisB copy numbers for the low expression strain 210 ( BAL004 ) ( S1 Appendix Fig . 4 ) . We found ~ 160±66 , 122±51 , or 83±6 ( ±SD ) copies per 211 cell using B . subtilis standards , DNA - origami , or the quantitative WB methods , 212 respectively . For the ISEP , we found 8±2 , 6±2 , or 5±3 ( ±SD ) copies of mGFP - FisB 213 using the three approaches , respectively ( S1 Appendix Table 1 ) . About 6 % of the total 214 mGFP - FisB signal accumulated in ISEP , close to the ~ 4 % in the native - expression 215 strain ( S1 Appendix Fig . 4E ) . The DMC were too dim to quantify reliably . Assuming 216 DMCs to be ~ 3 - fold dimmer than ISEP like in the native - expression strain , each DMC 217 would contain 2 - 3 mGFP - FisB , just below our detection limit . Interestingly , lowering the 218 total expression of FisB per cell ~ 8 - fold resulted in a ~ 6 - fold reduction in the average 219 number of FisB molecules found at the membrane fission site . Thus , only ~ 6 copies of 220 FisB are sufficient to mediate membrane fission , but only after some delay ( Figure 221 1E , F ) . 222 In summary , ~ 40 FisB molecules accumulate at the fission site to mediate membrane 223 fission . Only 3 - 4 DMCs need to reach the fission site to provide the necessary numbers . 224 When FisB expression is lowered ~ 8 - fold , ~ 6 FisB molecules accumulate at the 225 engulfment pole to mediate membrane fission , but fission takes longer . 226 227 FisB localization and membrane fission are independent of cardiolipin , 228 phosphatidylethanolamine and flotillins 229 .

It is made The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 8 , 2021 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 09 . 25 . 313023 doi : bioRxiv preprint 7 To investigate how FisB is recruited to the membrane fission site , we began by testing a 230 potential role for the cell wall remodeling machinery , the protonmotive force , and the 231 membrane potential , and found none influenced FisB dynamics ( S1 Appendix Results 232 and S1 Appendix Fig . 6 ) . 233 We then tested whether lipid microdomains play a role in recruitment to the site of 234 fission . Previously , we reported that the recombinant , purified extracytoplasmic domain 235 ( ECD , see Figure 4A ) of FisB interacts with artificial lipid bilayers containing CL 23 . To 236 test if FisB - CL interactions could be important for the subcellular localization of FisB and 237 membrane fission , we generated a strain ( BAM234 ) that carries deletions of the three 238 known CL synthase genes ywnE ( clsA ) , ywjE ( clsB ) and ywiE ( clsC ) 47 ( Figure 3A ) . The 239 CL synthase - deficient strain did not contain detectable levels of CL at t = 3 hours after 240 sporulation was initiated ( Figure 3B ) . CL - deficient cells grew normally but had a 241 reduction in sporulation efficiency as assayed by heat - resistant ( 20 min at 80˚C ) colony 242 forming units ( S1 Appendix Table 2 and S1 Appendix Figure 5 ) 33 . A reduction in 243 sporulation efficiency measured in this manner can be due to a defect at one or several 244 steps during sporulation or germination . Importantly , the membrane fission time course 245 of ΔclsABC cells was indistinguishable from those of wild - type cells ( Figure 3C , D ) , 246 indicating the defect in sporulation occurs at a stage after membrane fission . In addition , 247 mYFP - FisB localization and dynamics were similar in ΔclsABC ( BAL037 ) and wild - type 248 ( BAL002 ) cells ( Figure 3F - H ) . The fraction of cells that had an ISEP , and the intensity of 249 the ISEP , reflecting the number of FisB molecules recruited to the membrane fission 250 site , were indistinguishable for wild - type and ΔclsABC cells ( Figure 3G , H ) . We conclude 251 that CL is not required for the subcellular localization of FisB or membrane fission . 252 Next , we tested a potential role for phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , another lipid 253 implicated in membrane fusion and fission 48 , 49 and that forms microdomains 50 . We 254 deleted the pssA gene which encodes phosphatidylserine synthase that mediates the 255 first step in PE synthesis ( Figure 3A ) to generate cells lacking PE ( strain BAL031 , 256 Figure 3B ) . Kinetics of membrane fission during sporulation were identical in ΔpssA and 257 wild - type cells ( Figure 3D ) , indicating PE does not play a significant role in membrane 258 fission . 259 PE and CL domains in B . subtilis membranes tend to occur in the same sub - cellular 260 regions 50 , raising the possibility that CL and PE may compensate for each other . To test 261 whether removing both CL and PE affects fission , we generated a quadruple mutant 262 ( BAL030 ) lacking both CL and PE ( Figure 3B ) , leaving PG as the major phospholipid 263 component of the membrane . Surprisingly , the quadruple mutant underwent fission with 264 indistinguishable kinetics compared to wild - type ( Figure 3C , D ) . Thus , two lipids with 265 negative spontaneous curvature and implicated in membrane fusion and fission 266 reactions in diverse contexts have no significant role in membrane fission mediated by 267 FisB during sporulation . 268 In addition to CL and PE microdomains , bacteria also organize many signal 269 transduction cascades and protein - protein interactions into functional membrane 270 microdomains ( FMMs ) , loose analogs of lipid rafts found in eukaryotic cells 40 . The 271 FMMs of B . subtilis are enriched in polyisoprenoid lipids and contain flotillin - like 272 proteins , FloT and FloA , that form mobile foci in the plasma membrane 51 , 52 . FloT - 273 deficient cells have a sporulation defect , but which sporulation stage is impaired is not 274 .

We observed that ΔfloA ( BAL035 ) , but not ΔfloT ( BAL036 ) , cells are impaired 275 in sporulation as assayed by heat - resistant colony forming units ( S1 Appendix Table 2 , 276 and S1 Appendix Figure 5 ) . However , when we monitored engulfment and membrane 277 fission , we found both proceeded normally in ΔfloA cells ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , the 278 sporulation defect in ΔfloA cells lies downstream of engulfment and membrane fission . 279 This was confirmed by blocking formation of FMMs during sporulation by addition of 50 280 μ M zaragozic acid 53 to the sporulation medium which had no effect on the localization of 281 mGPF - FisB ( Figure 3E ) . 282 Together , these results imply that FisB - mediated membrane fission that marks the end 283 of engulfment during sporulation is insensitive to the negative - curvature lipids CL , PE , 284 and to FloA / T - dependent lipid domains . 285 286 FisB binds to acidic lipids 287 PG can substitute for CL as a binding partner for many proteins 54 , 55 . To see if this might 288 also be the case for the FisB ECD , we quantified the affinity of this domain for both 289 lipids . 290 Most , but not all , algorithms ( S1 Appendix Fig . 7 ) predict FisB to possess a single 291 transmembrane domain ( TMD ) with a small N - terminal cytoplasmic domain and a larger 292 ( 23 - kDa ) ECD , as depicted in Figure 4A . We first confirmed this predicted topology 293 using a cysteine accessibility assay 56 ( S1 Appendix Fig . 8 , Materials and Methods , and 294 S1 Appendix Results ) . Our attempts to determine the structure of recombinant , purified 295 FisB ECD were unsuccessful , but a computational model of FisB for residues 44 to 225 , 296 covering most of the ECD is available 57 and is shown in Figure 4B . The model predicts 297 a curved ECD structure , with ~ 3 nm and ~ 5 nm for the inner and outer radii of 298 curvatures . The overall topology of FisB , with the predicted ECD structure is depicted in 299 Figure 4B . 300 We probed interactions of FisB ECD with PG using a liposome co - flotation assay , 301 illustrated in Figure 4C . Purified recombinant , soluble FisB ECD ( Fig . 4A , bottom ) was 302 incubated with liposomes and subsequently layered at the bottom of a discontinuous 303 density gradient . Upon equilibrium ultracentrifugation , the lighter liposomes float up to 304 the interface between the two lowest density layers together with bound protein , while 305 unbound protein remains at the bottom of the gradient . We collected fractions and 306 determined the percentage of protein co - floated with liposomes using SDS - PAGE and 307 densitometry , as shown in Figure 4D . We first determined that binding of FisB ECD to 308 liposomes containing CL was not dependent on pH or the divalent ion Ca 2 + ( S1 309 Appendix Fig . 9F , G ) . By contrast , the fraction of liposome - bound protein decreased 310 rapidly as the ionic strength increased ( S1 Appendix Fig . 9H ) . These results indicated 311 binding was mainly electrostatic in nature . 312 At neutral pH , CL carries two negative charges , whereas PG and phosphatidylserine 313 ( PS ) , a lipid not normally found in B . subtilis 58 , carry only a single negative charge . If 314 binding is mediated mainly by electrostatic interactions , then liposomes carrying PG or 315 PS at two times the mole fraction of CL should bind nearly the same amount of FisB 316 ECD , since the surface charge density would be the same . Indeed , similar amounts of 317 .

In these experiments , we used iFluor555 labeled FisB ECD ( iFluor555 - FisB 322 ECD ) and detected liposome - bound protein using fluorescence rather than densitometry 323 of SYPRO - stained gels , which extended sensitivity to much lower protein 324 concentrations . The titration data were fit to a model to estimate the apparent 325 dissociation constant , 𝐾 * ( see Materials and Methods ) , which was 1 . 0 μM for CL ( 95 % 326 confidence interval CI = 0 . 7 - 2 . 1 μM ) and 3 . 6 μM for PG , respectively ( CI = 2 . 8 - 5 . 0 , Figure 327 4F , G ) . 328 Together , these results suggest that while FisB has higher affinity for CL than for PG , 329 the higher affinity results mainly from the higher charge carried by CL . FisB does not 330 bind CL with much specificity ; at the same surface charge density , FisB ECD binds PG , 331 or even PS which is not a B . subtilis lipid , with similar affinity . Thus , in vivo FisB is likely 332 to bind CL as well as PG which is much more abundant . 333 334 Purified FisB ECD forms soluble oligomers 335 FisB forms clusters of various sizes in cells as described above ( Figure 1 , 2 ) and does 336 not appear to have other protein interaction partners 23 . Thus , homo - oligomerization of 337 FisB may be important for its function . We explored oligomerization of recombinant , 338 soluble FisB ECD ( Figure 5 ) . When FisB ECD bearing a hexa - histidine tag is expressed 339 in E . coli and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography , samples analyzed by 340 SDS - PAGE show multiple bands corresponding to different oligomeric states ( Figure 5D 341 and S1 Appendix Figure 9B ) . Size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) analysis resolved 342 the purified protein into predominant high molecular weight oligomeric structures eluting 343 over a wide range of sizes , and low molecular weight peaks comprising minor 344 components ( Figure 5E and S1 Appendix Figure 9C , top ) . The minor peak at ~ 23 kDa 345 ( 18 ml elution volume ) corresponds to monomeric FisB ECD , whereas the peak at ~ 400 346 kDa ( 15 ml ) is FisB ECD that co - elutes with another protein , likely the 60 kDa 347 chaperone GroEL , a common contaminant in recombinant proteins purified from E . coli 348 ( S1 Appendix Figure 9D ) . To rule out potential artefacts caused by the hexa - histidine 349 affinity tag , we also purified FisB ECD using a GST - tag , which yielded similar results . 350 The SEC of high molecular weight peaks collected from the initial chromatogram did not 351 show a redistribution when re - analyzed ( S1 Appendix Figure 9C , bottom ) , suggesting 352 that once formed , the oligomeric structures are stable for an hour or longer . 353 We analyzed the high molecular - weight SEC fractions ( peaks 1 and 2 ) using electron 354 microscopy ( EM ) after negative staining . This analysis revealed rod - like structures quite 355 homogeneous in size , ~ 50 nm long and ~ 10 nm wide ( Figure 5F and S1 Appendix 356 Figure 9E ) . These structures displayed conformational flexibility , which precluded 357 structural analysis using cryoEM ( and likely hampered our attempts to crystallize FisB 358 ECD ) . We estimate every rod - like oligomer can accommodate ~ 40 copies of the 359 predicted structure of FisB 44 - 225 shown in Figure 4B , similar to the number of FisB 360 molecules recruited to the membrane fission site in cells ( Figure 2 ) . 361 .

Accordingly , we first mutated conserved residues G175 , I176 , I195 and 369 I196 in a highly hydrophobic region of FisB ECD ( Figure 5A , B ) , producing a quadruple 370 mutant , G175A , I176S , I195T , I196S ( FisB GIII ) . These residues are on the surface of the 371 predicted structure of FisB ECD ( Figure 5C ) , so are not expected to interfere with 372 folding . Purified FisB GIII ECD displayed reduced oligomerization when analyzed using 373 SDS PAGE or size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 5D , E ) . Though much reduced in 374 amplitude , a broad , high molecular weight peak was still present in size exclusion 375 chromatograms ( Figure 5E ) . Negative - stain EM analysis of this fraction revealed 376 oligomerization with less defined size and structure compared to wild type FisB ECD 377 ( Figure 5G ) . 378 To test whether lipid binding of the GIII mutant was affected , we used the co - flotation 379 assay described above , except only two fractions were collected ( Figure 5H , I ) . This 380 analysis revealed that , despite being impaired in self - oligomerization , FisB GIII ECD has 381 lipid binding properties similar to wild - type with a dissociation constant 𝐾 * + & & & = 1 . 6 µM 382 ( 95 % confidence interval CI = 0 . 9 - 5 . 1 μM ) , indistinguishable from that of wild type FisB 383 ECD WT ( 𝐾 * , - = 1 . 0 µM , CI = 0 . 7 − 2 . 1 µM , Figure 5J ) . 384 385 FisB K168D , K170E ( FisB KK ) is selectively impaired in binding acidic lipids 386 To engineer lipid - binding mutants , we took advantage of our observation that FisB 387 binding to anionic lipids is principally mediated through electrostatic interactions ( S1 388 Appendix Figure 9H ) . We generated a series of mutants in which we either neutralized 389 or inverted up to four charges ( S1 Appendix Fig . 11 and S1 Appendix Table 2 ) . The 390 ECD of a set of charge neutralization mutants were expressed in E . coli , purified and 391 tested for lipid binding using the liposome co - floatation assay . The largest reductions in 392 lipid binding were observed when lysines in a region comprising residues 168 - 172 were 393 neutralized ( S1 Appendix Fig . 11A ) . This region corresponds to a highly positively 394 charged pocket in the predicted model of FisB 44 - 225 ( Figure 5C ) . 395 A partially overlapping set of FisB mutants were expressed in a ΔfisB background and 396 tested for sporulation efficiency by monitoring formation of heat - resistant colonies ( S1 397 Appendix Fig . 11B - E ) . Again , the strongest reductions in sporulation efficiency were 398 found when lysines 168 , 170 or 172 were mutated ( S1 Appendix Fig . 11D ) . We decided 399 to characterize the K168D , K170E mutation in more detail , as it produced the strongest 400 reduction in sporulation efficiency . 401 We purified the ECD of FisB K168D , K170E ( FisB KK ) from E . coli and tested its binding to 402 liposomes containing 45 mole % CL using the co - floatation assay ( Figure 5H - J ) .

Importantly , formation of oligomers was not affected ( Figure 5D , E ) . 406 Thus , FisB KK is specifically impaired in binding to acidic lipids . 407 408 FisB - lipid interactions and homo - oligomerization are important for targeting FisB 409 to the fission site 410 Using the FisB mutants selectively impaired in binding to lipids or homo - oligomerization , 411 we investigated whether these activities are important for FisB’s function in vivo . To 412 analyze FisB clustering and targeting to the fission site , we fused wild - type FisB or the 413 two mutants to an N - terminal monomeric YFP ( mYFP ) and expressed the fusions at 414 lower levels , which facilitated observation of ISEPs ( Figure 6A ) . We induced these 415 strains to sporulate and monitored FisB dynamics and membrane fission . Both the lipid - 416 binding ( FisB KK ) and the oligomerization mutant ( FisB GIII ) were targeted to the cell 417 membrane , unlike many other mutants we tested ( S1 Appendix Figure 11E and S1 418 Appendix Table 2 ) . At t = 1 . 5 h after the nutrient downshift , mYFP - FisB signals were 419 visible in all strains without any distinguishing features . At t = 2 . 5 h , a subset of cells 420 expressing the wild - type FisB fusion had undergone membrane fission and these cells 421 had an ISEP . By contrast , membrane fission was not evident in either of the mutants . 422 By t = 3 h , 25 % of WT FisB cells had undergone fission , nearly always with an 423 accompanying ISEP . In the lipid binding FisB KK mutant , only 8 % of the sporulating cells 424 had accomplished membrane fission ( Figure 6B ) , but more than 90 % of those that did 425 had an ISEP ( 53 / 58 cells ) . Membrane fission events and the accompanying bright 426 mYFP - FisB spots were very rare ( 0 . 6 % ) in the oligomerization - deficient FisB GIII mutant . 427 The distribution of fluorescence intensities of the foci from low - expression WT and KK 428 cells were indistinguishable ( Figure 6C ) . Using the DNA - origami fluorescence intensity 429 calibration ( Figure 2 ) , we estimate 6±2 copies of low - expression FisB WT or the KK 430 mutant to have accumulated at the fission site . For the GIII mutant , there were not 431 enough cells with an intense spot to perform a similar analysis . 432 From TMA - DPH labeling , we determined the fraction of cells that successfully 433 completed fission as a function of time ( Figure 6D ) . Oligomerization - deficient FisB GIII 434 was not able to induce fission , whereas the lipid - binding mutant FisB KK had a partial , but 435 severe defect ( ~ 50 % reduction compared to wild - type ) . Importantly , both mutants were 436 expressed at levels similar to the wild - type ( S1 Appendix Fig . 10 ) , so the defects to form 437 an ISEP and undergo membrane fission are not due to lower expression levels . 438 Together , these results suggest FisB - lipid and FisB - FisB interactions are both important 439 for targeting FisB to the fission site . 440 441 C . perfringens FisB can substitute for B . subtilis FisB 442 So far , our results suggest FisB - FisB and FisB - acidic lipid interactions are the main 443 drivers for targeting FisB to the membrane fission site . If no other partners are involved , 444 FisB should be largely an independent fission module , i . e . FisB homologs from different 445 .

To test this idea , we 447 expressed Clostridium perfringens FisB ( FisB Cperf ) in B . subtilis cells lacking FisB 448 ( BAL005 ) . The sequence identity is only 23 % between FisB sequences from these two 449 species . In the heat - kill assay , FisB Cperf fully rescued B . subtilis ΔfisB defects ( Figure 450 7A ) . C . perfringens FisB fused to mEGFP ( mEGFP - FisB Cperf ) had similar dynamics as 451 FisB Bsubti , forming DMCs at early times that gave way to an ISEP where membrane 452 fission occurs ( Figure 7B ) . Population kinetics of membrane fission were slower with 453 FisB Cperf ( Figure 7C ) , but nearly every cell that underwent fission had an ISEP as for the 454 wild type protein ( 220 / 239 , or 92 % ) . The intensity distribution of mEGFP - FisB Cperf ISEP 455 was shifted to smaller values compared to mEGFP - FisB Bsubti ISEP ( Figure 7D ) . Since 456 the average ISEP intensity for FisB Bsubti corresponds to ~ 40 copies ( Figure 2 ) , we 457 deduce ~ 9 copies of FisB Cperf accumulate at ISEP at the time of membrane fission . At 458 t = 3 h into sporulation , the percentage of cells with an ISEP was lower for cells 459 expressing mEGFP - FisB Cperf ( Figure 7E ) . 460 In all conditions tested so far , nearly all cells that had undergone membrane fission also 461 had an intense FisB spot at the engulfment pole ( Figs . 2 , 3 , 6 , and 7 ) . When we plotted 462 the percentage of cells having an ISEP against the percentage of cells that have 463 undergone fission at t = 3 h , we found a nearly perfect correlation ( Figure 7F ) . FisB Cperf fit 464 this pattern well , despite having a low sequence identity to FisB Bsubti , suggesting a 465 common localization and membrane fission mechanism , likely based on a few 466 conserved biophysical properties . 467 468 FisB does not have a preference for highly curved membrane regions , but can 469 bridge membranes 470 A number of proteins localize to sub - cellular sites due to their preference for curved 471 membrane regions 59 - 62 . During late stages of engulfment , the most highly curved region 472 in the cell is the membrane neck connecting the engulfment membrane with the rest of 473 the mother cell membrane and this is where FisB accumulates . We therefore asked 474 whether curvature - sensing could be a mechanism driving FisB ' s localization . To test this 475 possibility , we undertook three independent series of experiments . 476 First , we used the principle that any protein which preferentially binds curved 477 membranes at low membrane coverage can also induce membrane curvature when 478 present at sufficiently high coverage 60 , 63 . Thus , we tested whether the soluble ECD of 479 FisB could generate curved regions in highly malleable membranes of giant unilamellar 480 vesicles ( GUVs ) at high coverage . We incubated 2 μM purified soluble FisB ECD 481 labeled with iFluor555 with GUVs and monitored protein coverage and membrane 482 deformations using spinning - disc confocal microscopy . Even when the GUV 483 membranes were covered uniformly with iFluor555 - FisB ECD we could not observe any 484 GUV membrane deformations ( Figure 8A ) . As a positive control , we used purified 485 Endophilin A1 ( EndoA1 , labeled with Atto395 ) , an N - BAR domain containing endocytic 486 protein 64 - 66 . We incubated 2 μM EndoA1 with GUVs composed of 45 % DOPS , 24 . 5 % 487 DOPC , 30 % DOPE and 0 . 5 % DiD , which resulted in extensive tubulation of GUV 488 membranes ( Figure 8A ) , as reported previously 67 . Importantly , the difference in the 489 .

Deflated GUVs displayed curved 496 regions because their larger surface - to - volume ratios no longer allowed spherical 497 shapes . Even under these favorable conditions , FisB ECD was not able to generate 498 highly curved regions on these deflated GUVs ( Figure 8B ) . In addition , if FisB ECD had 499 a preference for negatively ( positively ) curved regions , it should accumulate at such 500 regions while being depleted from positively ( negatively ) curved areas . Quantification of 501 FisB ECD coverage at negatively or positively curved membrane regions showed no 502 curvature preference ( Figure 8B ) . 503 Third , we tested if FisB’s localization in live B . subtilis cells depended on membrane 504 curvature . To avoid potentially confounding effects of other cues that may be present 505 during sporulation , we expressed GFP - FisB under an inducible promoter during 506 vegetative growth . In addition , we blocked cell division by inducing expression of MciZ 68 . 507 MciZ normally blocks binary cell division during sporulation , but when expressed during 508 vegetative growth , cells grow into long flexible filaments that are bent to varying 509 degrees , providing regions with different membrane curvatures . We imaged GFP - FisB 510 spots along curved edges of these filaments and plotted the linear density of GFP - FisB 511 spots ( spots / μm ) as a function of filament curvature ( Figure 8C ) . There was no clear 512 correlation between GFP - FisB spot density and filament curvature . Although this 513 method generates a limited amount of curvature , a similar approach was previously 514 used to show that DivIVA preferentially localizes to negatively curved regions 69 . 515 In the GUV experiments , we noticed that FisB ECD caused GUVs to adhere to one 516 another when they came into contact , accumulating at the adhesion patch between the 517 membranes and at the rims ( Figure 8D ) . Absorbance measurements using small 518 unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) confirmed that FisB ECD can bridge membranes and 519 aggregate liposomes ( Figure 8E ) . 520 Overall , these experiments suggest that FisB does not have any intrinsic membrane 521 curvature sensing / sculpting ability , but it can bridge membranes . 522 523 Modeling suggests self - oligomerization and membrane bridging are sufficient to 524 localize FisB to the membrane neck 525 To test the hypothesis that the homo - oligomerization , lipid - binding and the unique 526 membrane topology could be sufficient to recruit FisB to the membrane neck , we 527 considered a minimal model based on free energy minimization . As depicted in Figure 528 9 , we consider the free energy 𝐹 of an axisymmetric membrane neck of radius 𝑅 and 529 length 𝐿 connecting two membrane sheets , corresponding to the local geometry where 530 the engulfment membrane meets the rest of the mother cell membrane . We assume the 531 surface density 𝜙 of FisB proteins in the neck is uniform and reaches equilibrium with a 532 .

The energy 534 functional consists of a term accounting for membrane bending and tension , 𝐹 m , and 535 another term accounting for FisB protein - protein interactions , 𝐹 p . We employ the 536 classical Helfrich - Canham theory 70 - 75 for the energy of the membrane 537 𝐹 0 = ∫ 𝑑𝑆 1 D 2 % 𝐻 % + 𝛾H ’ ! + ∫ 𝑑𝑆 s 𝛾 ’ s , ( 1 ) 538 where 𝑆 1 and 𝑆 s are the surfaces of the membrane neck and sheets , 𝐻 is twice the 539 mean curvature , 𝜅 is the bending modulus , and 𝛾 is the surface tension . The two 540 membrane sheets are assumed to be planar , thus their only contribution to the energy 541 comes from membrane tension . 542 For FisB , we include translational entropy , the energy of homo - oligomerization in trans 543 between opposing membranes , and an energy that limits crowding . As shown above , 544 FisB proteins do not exhibit curvature sensing , so we do not include a term coupling 545 FisB density to membrane curvature in Eq . ( 1 ) . This results in the following expression 546 for the protein free energy 547 𝐹 4 = ∫ 𝑑𝑆 1 J𝑘 5 𝑇𝜙 ln N 6 6 # O + 𝑎𝑉 78 ( 𝑅 ) 𝜙 % + 𝑈 ( 𝜙 ) U ’ ! , ( 2 ) 548 where the first term accounts for translational entropy , the second term is an energy per 549 unit area accounting for trans interactions of FisB , and which for simplicity is assumed 550 to be proportional to the standard Lennard – Jones ( LJ ) potential accounting for a longer - 551 range attraction and shorter - range repulsion , 552 𝑉 !

For realistic parameters 571 ( the dot ) , we find that FisB trans interactions are strong enough to stabilize the neck at 572 𝑅 ~ 3 nm , with a close - packed concentration of FisB in the neck 𝜙 ≈ 𝜙 @ max . For these 573 same parameters , there is a critical lower limit of 𝑎 below which the FisB interactions 574 are too weak to stabilize the neck , so the neck opens , i . e . 𝑅 → ∞ in our simple model . 575 Additionally , Figure 9B shows that the shorter the length of the neck 𝐿 , the stronger the 576 trans interactions needed to stabilize the neck at a finite radius . This makes intuitive 577 sense : the longer the neck , the more FisB can be present to hold the neck together in 578 opposition to membrane tension . ( Note that expanding the radius of the neck actually 579 decreases the total membrane area , which is the sum of the membrane in the neck and 580 in the parallel sheets , so that surface tension tends to make the neck expand – see S2 581 Appendix ) . 582 While the above results suggest that an accumulation of FisB at the neck can be 583 energetically stable , one question is how long it might take to reach that state ? We 584 expect nucleation of a critical cluster of FisB to be rate limiting , since the time required 585 for diffusion and capture to reach ~ 40 FisB in the neck is quite short ~ 3 . 9 s ( see S2 586 Appendix ) . To obtain a simple estimate of the nucleation time for both low - expression 587 and native - expression strains , we assume that FisB proteins diffuse independently on 588 the entire membrane and that nucleation of a stable cluster in the neck occurs when 𝑛 589 proteins happen to be in the neck at the same time . To this end , we need to estimate 590 the fraction of time there are 𝑛 or more FisB in the neck , as well as the correlation time , 591 i . e . the time between uncorrelated samples . Since we assume FisB proteins are 592 independent , the number of proteins in the neck will be Poisson distributed , so we only 593 need to know the average in the neck to obtain the full distribution . The average number 594 of FisB in the neck is its area , 2 𝜋𝑅𝐿 , times the background concentration , 𝜙 / . 595 Furthermore , the correlation time is simply the time for a FisB to diffuse the length of the 596 neck 𝐿 % / 𝐷 . Using 𝜙 0 ≃ 20 FisB 𝜇m M % ( see " About 40 FisB molecules accumulate at the 597 engulfment pole to mediate membrane fission " above ) for the low - expression strain 598 yields < FisB > ≃ 0 . 03 in the neck . Assuming that the one - hour delay in membrane fission 599 during sporulation of low - expression strain is due to the time for nucleation , we can infer 600 that the number of FisB proteins required for nucleation is 𝑛 ≈ 3 ( see S2 Appendix ) . If 601 the native - expression strain also needs 𝑛 ≈ 3 to nucleate , we can estimate its 602 corresponding nucleation time using 𝜙 / ≃ 100 FisB 𝜇m M % , which yields < FisB > ≃ 603 0 . 15 and a nucleation time of ~ 30 s . We conclude that for native expression levels of 604 FisB , nucleation of a stable cluster of FisB at the neck is not likely to be rate limiting for 605 the process of membrane fission . 606 607 DISCUSSION 608 Previously , we showed that FisB is required for the membrane fission event that marks 609 .

Here , we found that 610 a cluster of FisB molecules is nearly always present at the membrane fission site as 611 evidenced by an intense fluorescent spot at the engulfment pole ( ISEP ) using 612 fluorescently tagged FisB . The number of FisB molecules accumulated at the ISEP 613 correlates well with the fraction of cells having undergone membrane fission at a given 614 time point after induction of sporulation ( Figs . 1 , 7 ) . In addition , the number of wild - type 615 FisB molecules per ISEP correlates with the total number of FisB molecules per cell ( S1 616 Appendix Figure 4 ) . Thus , the kinetics of membrane fission is determined by the 617 accumulation of FisB molecules at the fission site . Lowering FisB expression could slow 618 membrane fission by slowing the accumulation of FisB at the pole , or by reducing the 619 number of FisB molecules driving fission after they are localized at the fission site . Our 620 modeling results are consistent with slower ISEP nucleation in the low - expression 621 strain , however , currently , we cannot experimentally distinguish between the two 622 possibilities , and both may be operating simultaneously . 623 How is FisB recruited to the fission site ? Our results suggest FisB does not rely on 624 existing landmarks , lipid microdomains , cell - wall remodeling machinery , pH or voltage 625 gradients across the cell membrane , or membrane curvature cues for its dynamic 626 localization . In addition , we could not detect proteins interacting with FisB other than 627 itself using an anti - GFP resin pulling on YFP - FisB 23 . By contrast , we found self - 628 oligomerization and binding to acidic lipids to be critical for FisB ' s function , and purified 629 FisB ECD can bridge artificial membranes . Together , these results suggest FisB - FisB 630 and FisB - lipid interactions are key drivers for FisB clustering and accumulation at the 631 membrane fission site . 632 Can FisB oligomerization and lipid binding be sufficient to accumulate an immobile 633 cluster of FisB molecules at the engulfment pole ? Modeling suggests this is indeed the 634 case . First , the narrow neck enables FisB’s on opposing membranes to come close 635 enough to interact in trans . We infer this to be the preferred orientation for FisB - FisB 636 interaction , since otherwise large clusters would be expected to form elsewhere as well . 637 Second , the unique geometry of the neck connecting the engulfment membrane to the 638 rest of the mother cell membrane plays an important role , as this is the only region in 639 the cell where a cluster of FisB molecules can be " trapped " , i . e . , once a cluster is 640 formed inside the neck , it cannot diffuse away without breaking apart . This idea is 641 supported by the fact that we do not observe any FisB accumulation at the leading edge 642 of the engulfment membrane until a thin neck has formed at the end of engulfment . 643 The first FisB oligomers that appear during sporulation are dim , mobile clusters ( DMCs ) , 644 each containing about a dozen FisB molecules . ( One possibility is that the DMCs may 645 correspond to local membrane folds stabilized by FisBs interacting in trans . ) Diffusion of 646 DMCs appears to be Brownian on the 10 - 20 s time scale ( Figure 2 ) , though a rigorous 647 analysis would require taking into account the geometry of the system . A DMC can 648 diffuse a typical distance of ~ 1 μm in ~ 5 min ( 𝐷 ! " # ≈ 3 × 10 M $ µm % / s , Figure 2E ) . By 649 comparison , engulfment in individual cells takes ~ 60 min on average 76 . Though the 650 engulfment time is much longer than the DMC diffusion time , the neck region , with an 651 inner diameter of several nanometers , only forms at the very end of the engulfment 652 process . Thus , ~ 40 FisB molecules could be recruited to the neck through diffusion - 653 limited capture of a few DMCs . However , we could not image such capture events 654 .

Indeed , a simple model of the rate of nucleation of a 656 cluster of FisBs at the neck suggests that as few as three FisBs interacting in trans 657 could be sufficient to form a stable cluster there , with a nucleation time significantly 658 shorter than the engulfment time at native expression levels . 659 How many FisB molecules are needed for efficient membrane fission ? In cells 660 completely lacking FisB , ~ 5 % of the cells undergo membrane fission by t = 3 h , 661 compared to ~ 80 % or ~ 30 % for cells expressing FisB at native or ~ 8 - fold reduced 662 levels , respectively ( Figure 1F ) . The former achieve fission with ~ 40 copies , while the 663 latter with only ~ 6 . Thus , FisB is not absolutely required for membrane fission , but it 664 makes it much more efficient , i . e . FisB catalyzes membrane fission . The variable 665 stoichiometry suggests that FisB does not oligomerize into a specific quaternary 666 structure with a definite stoichiometry . This variability appears to be a common property 667 among proteins catalyzing membrane fusion and fission , such as SNAREs 77 - 79 or 668 dynamin 14 . The smallest clusters associated with membrane fission had ~ 6 FisB copies 669 on average . This number is likely sufficient to form at least one ring inside the 670 membrane neck that eventually undergoes fission . Given that fission can occur in the 671 absence of FisB , it is likely that the FisB cluster cooperates with other cellular processes 672 to produce stress on this membrane neck . 673 We found FisB dynamics and membrane fission are not affected by removal of CL , PE , 674 or both . CL and PE are widely implicated in membrane fission and fusion reactions due 675 to their tendency to form non - bilayer structures 48 , 80 - 83 . The fact that CL or PE do not 676 affect membrane fission during sporulation is remarkable , because such lipids usually 677 affect the kinetics and / or the extent of fusion / fission reactions even if they are not 678 absolutely required 81 . We tested the role of CL in a strain that lacked all three known CL 679 synthases , with no detectable CL levels . A previous study reported that in D clsABC B . 680 subtilis cells , CL levels increase from undetectable during vegetative growth to readily 681 detectable during sporulation 31 , suggesting a yet unidentified sporulation - specific CL 682 synthase may exist . Our results differ from those of Kawai et al . in that we were unable 683 to detect any CL in D clsABC B . subtilis cells during vegetative growth or sporulation . We 684 suggest the differences may be due to the different strain backgrounds used 84 , PY79 85 685 here vs . Bs168 86 in Kawai et al . or differences in detection sensitivities . 686 Overall , our results suggest FisB localizes to the membrane fission site using only lipid - 687 binding , homo - oligomerization , and the unique geometry encountered at the end of 688 engulfment . We propose that accumulation of a high enough density of FisB leads to 689 membrane fission , possibly by generating increased stress in the FisB network - 690 membrane composite , or in cooperation with another cellular process . A FisB 691 homologue with low sequence identity partially rescued fission defects in ΔfisB B . 692 subtilis cells , consistent with the idea that FisB acts as an independent module relying 693 mainly on homo - oligomerization , lipid - binding , and sporulation geometry . 694 695 696 MATERIALS AND METHODS 697 .

Molybdenum Blue spray reagent was from Sigma - Aldrich . Carbonyl 708 cyanide m - chlorophenyl hydrazone ( CCCP ) was purchased from Abcam and 709 valinomycin was purchased from VWR . 3 - ( N - maleimidylpropionyl ) biocytin ( MBP ) was 710 obtained from Invitrogen and the HRP - conjugated antibody from eBioscience . Zaragozic 711 acid was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . 4 - acetamido - 4′ - maleimidylstilbene - 2 , 2′ - 712 disulfonic acid ( AMS ) and zaragozic acid were from obtained from Cayman Chemical 713 Company . 714 General B . subtilis methods 715 B . subtilis strains were derived from the prototrophic strain PY79 85 . Sporulation was 716 induced in liquid medium at 37°C by nutrient exhaustion in supplemented DS medium 717 ( DSM ) 87 or by resuspension according to the method of Sterlini & Mandelstam 88 . 718 Sporulation efficiency was determined in 24 – 30 h cultures as the total number of heat - 719 resistant ( 80°C for 20 min ) colony forming units ( CFUs ) compared to wild - type heat - 720 resistant CFUs . Lipid synthesis mutants were from the Bacillus knock - out ( BKE ) 721 collection 89 and all were back - crossed twice into B . subtilis PY79 before assaying and 722 prior to antibiotic cassette removal . Antibiotic cassette removal was performed using the 723 temperature - sensitive plasmid pDR244 that constitutively expresses Cre recombinase 89 . 724 Cassette removal was further confirmed by PCR with primers flanking the deletion . B . 725 subtilis strains were constructed using plasmidic or genomic DNA and a 1 - step 726 competence method . Site directed mutagenesis was performed using Agilent ' s Quick - 727 change Lightning kit following manufacturer’s instructions and mutations were confirmed 728 by sequencing . The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in S1 Appendix 729 Tables 2 and 3 , respectively . 730 Live - cell fluorescence microscopy of B . subtilis 731 Cells were mounted on a 2 % agarose pad containing resuspension medium using a 732 gene frame ( Bio - Rad ) . Cells were concentrated by centrifugation ( 3300g for 30 s ) prior 733 to mounting and visualization . This step had no impact on the localization of the fusion 734 proteins . Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica DMi8 wide - field 735 inverted microscope equipped with an HC PL APO 100×DIC objective ( NA = 1 . 40 ) and 736 an iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD Camera from Andor Technology . Membranes were stained 737 with TMA - DPH at a final concentration of 100 μM .

We first generated stains expressing FisB versions with a single 745 cysteine substitution at position G6 , L137 , or A245 , in a ΔfisB background . FisB does 746 not have any endogenous cysteines . These point mutations decreased the sporulation 747 efficiency slightly ( S1 Appendix Table 2 ) , we assume without affecting the topology . We 748 selectively biotinylated extra - or intracellular cysteines of B . subtilis protoplasts , 749 produced by addition of 0 . 5 mg / ml lysozyme and incubating cells at 37°C for 1h with 750 gentle rocking . Protoplasts were then incubated with the membrane - impermeant 751 reagent 3 - ( N - maleimidylpropionyl ) biocytin ( MBP ) . To selectively label extracellular 752 cysteines , protoplasts of sporulating cells at 2 . 5 h into sporulation were incubated with 753 100 μM MPB . The reaction was quenched with 50 mM DTT before cells were lysed with 754 hypotonic shock . To label intracellular cysteines selectively , extracellular cysteines of 755 protoplasts were first blocked AMS before cells were lysed and incubated with 100 μM 756 MPB . The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 μM MPB . FisB was pulled down 757 from the cell lysates as described in 91 using an anti - Myc antibody ( mAb # 2276 ) and 758 biotinylated proteins were detected by Western Blot using a HRP - conjugated - Avidin 759 antibody . Further details are provided in the S1 Appendix . 760 Expression , purification , and labeling of recombinant FisB protein 761 Recombinant soluble FisB ECD was purified as described in 23 but with slight 762 modifications . Briefly , His 6 - FisB ECD was expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) from New 763 England Biolabs and purified using HisPur™ Ni - NTA Resin from Thermo Fisher 764 Scientific . Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at OD 600 = 0 . 6 overnight at 765 16°C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in Lysis 766 Buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM TCEP , 20 mM Imidazole , 2 % glycerol , 767 20 mM MgCl 2 ) and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Pellets were thawed on ice and cells 768 were lysed by 5 passes through a high - pressure homogenizer ( Avestin EmulsiFlex - C3 ) . 769 The lysate was spun down at 100 , 000×g and the soluble fraction was incubated with 770 HisPur™ Ni - NTA Resin for 2 . 5 h at 4°C while rotating . The bound protein was washed 771 with Lysis Buffer , Lysis Buffer containing 50 mM and finally 100 mM Imidazole . The 772 protein was eluted in Elution Buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM TCEP , 200 773 mM Imidazole , 2 % glycerol , 20 mM MgCl2 ) . The protein was concentrated using a 774 Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff and the 775 concentration determined by Bradford protein assay . The protein was stored at - 80ºC . 776 In experiments with labeled FisB ECD , we used a cysteine mutation , G123C ( FisB ECD 777 does not have any endogenous cysteines ) . After expression and purification as above , 778 iFluor555 - maleimide ( AAT Bioquest ) was reacted with FisB ECD G123C following the 779 manufacturer ' s instructions . G123 is in a loop that if removed does not interfere with 780 FisB ' s function ( S1 Appendix Figure 10 ) . 781 Analytical size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) and negative - stain electron 782 microscopy ( EM ) 783 For SEC analysis His 6 - FisB ECD was loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10 / 300 GL 784 .

The 786 column was calibrated with Bio - Rad ' s Gel Filtration Standards . For negative stain EM 787 analysis , 4 μL of the indicated elution fractions were applied to 200 - mesh copper grids 788 coated with ~ 10 nm amorphous carbon film , negatively stained with 2 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl 789 acetate , and air - dried . Images were collected on a FEI Tecnai T12 microscope , with a 790 LaB6 filament operating at 120 kV , and equipped with a Gatan CCD camera . 791 Inhibition of cell wall synthesis and analyses of FisB motions 792 Overnight cultures of GFP - Mbl ( BDR2061 ) or IPTG - induced mGFP - FisB ( BMB014 ) 793 were diluted in CH medium to OD600 = 0 . 05 . Expression of GFP - FisB was induced with 794 1 mM IPTG for 2h at 37°C . Expression of GFP - Mbl was induced with 10 mM xylose for 795 30 min when BDR2061 reached OD600 = 0 . 5 . For imaging untreated cells , 1 ml of cells 796 was washed twice with 1 ml PBS and finally resuspended in 10 μl PBS . 2 μ l of cell 797 suspension was spread on a 2 % PBS agar pad for imaging . To inhibit cell - wall 798 synthesis 50 μg / ml fosfomycin was added to the cultures 45 min before imaging . 1 ml of 799 cells was washed twice with PBS containing 50 μg / ml fosfomycin and mounted on a 800 PBS agar pad also containing fosfomycin . Cells were imaged using a Olympus IX81 801 microscope with a home - built polarized TIRF setup 92 , 93 . Exposure times were 50 ms for 802 BDR2061 and 100 ms for BMB014 . Movies were acquired at 1 frame / s . Movies 803 collected for BMB014 were corrected for bleaching using the Bleaching Correction 804 function ( exponential method ) in ImageJ . Kymographs were created with imageJ along 805 the indicated axes . GFP fusion proteins were tracked using the ImageJ plugin 806 TrackMate 94 . A Laplacian of Gaussian ( LoG ) filter was used to detect particles with an 807 estimated blob diameter 400 μm . Particles were tracked using the Simple LAP tracker 808 with a 0 . 25 μm maximum linking distance and no frame gaps . MATLAB ( Mathworks , 809 Natick , MA ) was used for further processing of the tracks . Mean squared displacement 810 ( MSD ) was calculated using the MATLAB class @ msdanalyzer 95 . 811 The asymmetry of individual tracks ( S1 Appendix Fig . 5F ) was calculated as described 812 in 96 using : 813 𝐴𝑠𝑦𝑚 = −𝑙𝑜𝑔 t1 − ( 𝑅 ; % − 𝑅 % % ) % ( 𝑅 ; % + 𝑅 % % ) % u 814 where 𝑅 ; and 𝑅 % are the principal components of the radius of gyration , equal to the 815 square roots of the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration tensor 𝑹 𝒈 : 816 𝑹 𝒈 ( 𝒊 , 𝒋 ) = 〈𝒙 𝒊 𝒙 𝒋 〉 − 〈𝒙 𝒊 〉〈𝒙 𝒋 〉 . 817 Tracking fluorescently labeled FisB spots and estimation of diffusion coefficients 818 For estimating the mobility of DMC and ISEP , time - lapse movies were recorded with a 819 frame rate of 1 s using wide - field microscopy ( 50 % LED intensity , 300 ms exposure 820 time , gain 300 ) . Spot positions were tracked using SpeckleTrackerJ 97 , a plugin for the 821 image analysis software ImageJ 90 . Mean - squared displacements ( MSDs ) were 822 calculated using the MATLAB class @ msdanalyzer 95 . 823 Dissipation of membrane potential 824 .

Lipid extracts were analyzed by TLC on silica 830 gel plates in mixtures of chloroform : hexane : methanol : acetic acid ( 50 : 30 : 10 : 5 ) . 831 Phospholipids were detected with Molybdenum Blue Reagent ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 832 Liposome preparation 833 Small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) were prepared by mixing 1 μmol of total lipids at 834 desired ratios . A thin lipid film was created using a rotary evaporator ( Buchi ) . Any 835 remaining organic solvent was removed by placing the lipid film under high vacuum for 836 2h . The lipid film was hydrated with 1 ml of RB - EDTA buffer [ 25 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 , 837 140 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ] by shaking using an 838 Eppendorf Thermomix for > 30 min . The lipid suspension was then frozen and thawed 7 839 times using liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath and subsequently extruded 21 times 840 through a 100 nm pore size polycarbonate filter using a mini - extruder ( Avanti ) . All SUVs 841 contained 1 % NBD - PE to determine the final lipid concentration . 842 Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) were prepared by electroformation 99 . Briefly , lipids 843 dissolved in chloroform were mixed in a glass tube at desired ratios and spotted on two 844 indium tin oxide ( ITO ) coated glass slides . Organic solvent was removed by placing the 845 lipid films in a vacuum desiccator for at least 2 h . A short strip of copper conductive tape 846 was attached to each ITO slide which were then separated by a 3 mm thick 847 Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) spacer and held together with binder clips . The chamber 848 was filled with 500 μl Swelling Buffer ( 1 mM HEPES , 0 . 25 M sucrose , 1 mM DTT ) and 849 sealed with Critoseal ( VWR International , Radnor , PA ) . GUVs were formed by applying 850 a 1 . 8 V sinusoidal voltage at 10 Hz for at least 2 h at room temperature . 851 For experiments involving FisB ECD the GUVs were composed of ( all in mole 852 percentages ) : 25 E . coli PE , 5 E . coli CL , 50 E . coli PG , 19 eggPC and 1 DiD or 1 NBD - 853 PE . For experiments in which EndoA1 was used , GUV composition was ( all in mole % ) : 854 45 DOPS , 24 . 5 DOPC , 30 DOPE and 0 . 5 DiD . 855 Liposome - protein co - floatation 856 For initial experiments , 40 nmol total lipid was incubated with 200 pmol FisB ECD for 1h 857 at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl . 200 μ l of 60 % Optiprep ( iodixanol , 858 Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the sample creating a 40 % Optiprep solution . The sample 859 was then layered at the bottom of a 5 mm x 41 mm Beckman ultracentrifuge tube 860 ( # 344090 ) and overlaid with 200 μl of 20 % Optiprep and finally 150 μ l of buffer ( Figure 4 861 C ) . Liposome - bound proteins co - float to a light density , while unbound proteins pellet 862 upon ultracentrifugation for 1 . 5 h at 48 krpm . Fractions were collected as shown in 863 Figure 4C and the amount of recovered protein was determined by SDS - PAGE ( Nu - 864 PAPGE 12 % Bis - tris gel , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) stained with SYPRO TM Orange 865 ( Invitrogen ) . 866 .

SUVs were composed of 50 mole % E . coli PG , 25 mole % E . coli PE , 20 mole % 869 eggPC , 5 mole % E . coli CL . The absorbance at 350 nm of 50 μM total lipid was 870 measured for 5 min , before addition of 1 μM FisB ECD . Absorbance increases with 871 increasing liposome aggregation due to increased scattering 100 . 872 Filamentous B . subtilis cells to test for curvature - sensitive localization of FisB 873 An overnight culture of BMB014 was diluted into fresh CH medium 101 to OD 600 = 0 . 05 . 1 874 mM IPTG and 20 mM xylose were added to induce the expression of GFP - FisB and 875 MciZ , respectively . The latter inhibits cytokinesis 68 . The culture was grown at 37°C for 876 30 min before 3 - 5 μl of cells were transferred onto a 3 % agar pad also containing 1 mM 877 IPTG and 20 mM xylose . Cells were grown on the agar pad for 2h at 37°C prior to 878 imaging . GFP - FisB foci were detected using the ImageJ plugin TrackMate as described 879 above . Radii of the inner and outer edges were determined by manually fitting a circle to 880 the cells using ImageJ . 881 Determination of binding constants 882 For determination of binding constants , the floatation protocol was slightly modified . 883 Varying amounts of lipids were incubated with 100 nM iFluor555 - FisB ECD for 1 h at 884 room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl . Density gradients were created as before 885 using Optiprep ( iodixanol ) , however only 2 fractions were collected ( Figure 5H ) . The 886 protein concentration in fraction A was too small to be quantified by SDS - PAGE . 887 Therefore , the sample was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) precipitation . 888 Briefly , 50 μl of TCA was added to fraction A and incubated for 30 min at 4°C . The 889 sample was spun at 14 krpm in an Eppendorf microfuge for 5 min . The pellet was 890 washed twice with ice - cold acetone and subsequently dried for 10 min in a 95°C heating 891 block . 10 μl of 2X SDS sample buffer was added to the dried pellet and the sample was 892 boiled for 10 min at 95°C and loaded on a 12 % bis - tris gel . The amount of recovered 893 protein was determined by fluorescence intensity of the labeled FisB ECD band on the 894 gel using a Typhoon FLA 9500 ( GE Healthcare ) . The dissociation constant 𝐾 * was 895 determined following ref . 102 . Titration curves were fitted to : 896 𝑓 Q = . [ J ] ; T . [ J ] , ( 1 ) 897 where 𝑓 Q is the fraction of bound protein and 𝐾 the apparent association constant ( 𝐾 = 898 1 / 𝐾 * ) . Eq . ( 1 ) assumes that the total lipid concentration [ 𝐿 ] is much larger than the 899 concentration of bound protein , a condition satisfied in our experiments for [ 𝐿 ] > 10 MU 900 M . 901 Image analysis 902 To estimate the fraction of cells that have undergone membrane fission at a particular 903 time after sporulation was initiated by nutrient downshift , cells were labeled with TMA - 904 DPH ( see " Live - cell fluorescence microscopy of B . subtilis " above ) . The dye labels the 905 forespore contours intensely before membrane fission , as it has access to three 906 membranes in close proximity that cannot be resolved ( forespore , engulfment , and 907 mother cell membranes ) .

Due to the clear 909 separation between the two labeling patterns ( S1 Appendix Fig . 1 ) cells can be scored 910 visually , with 6 - 7 % of cells having intermediate labeling that prevents categorization . 911 Thus , we underestimate the percentage of cells that have undergone membrane fission 912 by at most ~ 7 % . 913 For the analyses shown in S1 Appendix Figs . 4A , B , C , E , and 9 , we calculated the total 914 intensity ( sum ox pixel values ) inside the cell contour ( indicated in yellow in Fig . S4A ) 915 using MicrobeJ 103 . Mean integrated auto - fluorescence ( ~ 1300 a . u ) was calculated by 916 analyzing in the same way an equivalent number of individual wild - type cells , imaged 917 under identical conditions . 918 For the analyses shown in Figure 2 and S1 Appendix Fig . 4D , FisB foci were semi - 919 automatically selected using SpeckleTrackerJ 97 . For each spot the sum of pixel values 920 in a 6 × 6 pixel ( 0 . 5 µm × 0 . 5 µm ) box around the center of the spot were calculated . For 921 each corresponding cell the same operation was performed at a membrane area where 922 no clusters were present and subtracted from the FisB cluster intensity . 923 Preparation of DNA Origami - based mEGFP standards 924 These standards were prepared and characterized as described in 44 . Briefly , DNA 925 " rods " consisted of six - helix - bundle DNA origami nanotubes . Rods carried varying 926 numbers of single stranded “handle” sequences for DNA - conjugated fluorophore 927 hybridization . A long scaffold DNA ( p7308 104 ) was folded into the desired shape by self - 928 assembly with a six - fold molar excess of designed " staple strands " by heating and 929 cooling cycles over an 18 - hour period in a thermocycler ( Bio - Rad ) . Excess staples 930 were removed by PEG precipitation 105 , and DNA - conjugated fluorophores were 931 hybridized to the DNA origami nanotubes by coincubation for 2 hours at 37ºC . Finally , 932 excess fluorophore - DNA conjugates were removed by a second PEG precipitation 105 . 933 To estimate fluorophore labeling efficiency , standards designed to host 5 copies of 934 Alexa Fluor 488 were similarly prepared . These standards were imaged on a TIRF 935 microscope ( Eclipse Ti , Nikon ) until fully bleached . The photobleaching steps of the 936 fluorescence traces were fit to a binomial function to estimate the labeling efficiency to 937 be ~ 80 % ( 95 % CI = 76 % - 84 % ) . 938 Quantitative Western Blot 939 mYFP was cloned into pVS001 ( His 6 - Sumo - mYFP ) and purified using affinity 940 chromatography . For immunoblotting , cells in 100 ml sporulation medium were pelleted 941 and the supernatant removed . The pellets were suspended in ice - cold lysis buffer 942 ( pH = 7 . 5 ; 50 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 943 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , with one complete protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) to a final 944 volume of 300 µl , and then we added 0 . 3 g acid - washed glass beads ( 425 - 600 µm , 945 Sigma ) . After adding 150 µl boiling sample buffer ( 250 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 50 % 946 glycerol , 3 . 58 µM β - mercaptoethanol , 15 % SDS , and 0 . 025 % Bromophenol Blue ) , 947 samples were incubated at 100°C for 5 min . Samples were centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm in 948 a desktop centrifuge at room temperature for 10 min and stored at - 80°C . The blots 949 were probed with peroxidase - conjugated anti - GFP antibody ( ab13970 ) . Images were 950 scanned and quantified using ImageJ . 951 .

FisB does not sense or induce membrane curvature . A . FisB ECD does 1158 not induce deformation of GUV membranes . Left : GUVs incubated with 2 μM iFluor555 - 1159 labeled FisB ECD did not show any tubulation or invagination of the GUV membrane . 1160 GUVs were composed of ( in mole % : 25 E . coli PE , 5 E . coli CL , 50 E . coli PG , 19 1161 eggPC , 1 NBD - PE ) . Right : incubation of 2 μM endophilin A1 ( EndoA1 , labeled with 1162 Atto395 ) with GUVs ( 45 % DOPS , 24 . 5 % DOPC , 30 % DOPE and 0 . 5 % DiD ) resulted in 1163 extensive tubulation of membranes , as reported previously 22 . The two proteins have 1164 similar affinities for GUV membranes under these conditions ( Figure 4F and ref . 106 ) . 1165 B . FisB ECD cannot deform deflated GUVs and its membrane localization is 1166 independent of curvature . To avoid potential issues with high membrane tension 1167 preventing membrane deformation , GUVs were deflated using osmotic stress , which 1168 resulted in deformed GUVs with both negatively and positively curved regions . FisB 1169 ECD bound to these GUVs was unable to induce any high - curvature deformations . The 1170 intensity of iFluor555 - FisB ECD along a membrane contour ( proportional to coverage ) 1171 was plotted against membrane curvature in the corresponding region . There was no 1172 .

Many GUVs were 1179 found adhering to one another . iFluor555 - FisB ECD signals were enhanced in the 1180 adhesion patches , in particular at the rims . Intensity profiles along the highlighted 1181 contours are shown below the examples . E . FisB ECD aggregates small liposomes . 1182 Liposomes ( in mole % : 25 E . coli PE , 5 E . coli CL , 50 E . coli PG , 19 eggPC , 50 μM total 1183 lipid ) were incubated in the absence and presence of FisB ECD ( unlabeled ) and their 1184 aggregation monitored by absorbance at 350 nm . FisB was added at 5 min ( 1 μM final ) , 1185 which caused the absorbance to increase , indicating increased liposome aggregation . 1186 Figure 9 . Modeling supports recruitment of FisB to membrane neck via 1187 oligomerization without curvature sensing . A . Left : Schematic of the late stages of 1188 engulfment , when a small membrane neck connects the engulfment membrane to the 1189 rest of the mother cell membrane . Right : Schematic of FisB accumulation at the fission 1190 site . FisB freely moves around the engulfment membrane and other regions of the 1191 mother cell membrane , forming clusters of up to ~ 12 molecules . Cluster motions are 1192 independent of lipid microdomains , flotillins , the cell - wall synthesis machinery , and 1193 voltage or pH gradients . About 40 copies of FisB accumulate at the membrane neck in 1194 an immobile cluster . Bottom : Modeled axisymmetric membrane neck of radius 𝑅 and 1195 length 𝐿 connecting two membrane sheets . The uniform areal concentration of FisB in 1196 the neck is 𝜙 . B . Top : Equilibrium radius of the neck as a function of FisB trans homo - 1197 oligomerization strength , 𝑎 , for several values of neck length , 𝐿 . Below a minimum 1198 interaction strength , FisB cannot stabilize the neck and the neck opens . The horizontal 1199 line is the radius corresponding to the minimum of the potential describing the trans 1200 interaction , 𝑅 = 2 ; / = 𝜎 ( Eq . 3 ) . Bottom : Equilibrium FisB concentration in the neck as a 1201 function of 𝑎 . The horizontal line is 𝜙 @ max = 2 / ( 3 $ / % 𝑟 max % ) , the concentration of FisB at the 1202 onset of in - plane crowding . Model parameters ( see Eqs . 5 and 6 ) : 𝜅 = 20 𝑘 B 𝑇 ( ref . 107 ) , 1203 𝜙 / = 100 FisB 𝜇m M % , 𝛾 = 10 MW N m M % ( ref . 108 ) , 𝜎 cis ≃ 2 . 47 nm , 𝜙 @ max = 5 × 10 W FisB 𝜇m M % , 1204 𝐿 = 40 nm , and for the dot 𝑎 ≃ 10 W 𝑘 B 𝑇 nm % FisB M ; .
