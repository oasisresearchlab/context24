Chapter 9 Puriﬁcation and Application of a Small Actin Probe for Single - Molecule Localization Microscopy Roderick P . Tas , Trusanne G . A . A . Bos , and Lukas C . Kapitein Abstract The cytoskeleton is involved in many cellular processes . Over the last decade , super - resolution microscopy has become widely available to image cytoskeletal structures , such as microtubules and actin , with great detail . For example , Single - Molecule Localization Microscopy ( SMLM ) achieves resolutions of 5 – 50 nm through repetitive sparse labeling of samples , followed by Point - Spread - Function analysis of individual ﬂuorophores . Whereas initially this approach depended on the controlled photoswitching of ﬂuorophores targeted to the structure of interest , alternative techniques now depend on the transient binding of ﬂuorescently labeled probes , such as the small polypeptide lifeAct that can transiently interact with poly - merized actin . These techniques allow for simple multicolor imaging and are no longer limited by a ﬂuorophore’s blinking properties . Here we describe a detailed step - by - step protocol to purify , label , and utilize the lifeAct fragment for SMLM . This puriﬁcation and labeling strategy can potentially be extended to a variety of protein fragments compatible with SMLM . Key words Actin , Sample ﬁxation , Fluorophores , Super - resolution microscopy , Exchangeable probe 1 Introduction Cellular morphology , migration , division , polarization , and differ - entiation are all processes that require very speciﬁc cytoskeleton organization and dynamics . The exact organization of microtu - bules and actin directly inﬂuences the available roads for active transport by kinesins / dyneins and myosins , respectively [ 1 – 3 ] . A speciﬁc actin organization is important during cell migration , neuronal growth cone extension , brush border formation , and many other processes [ 4 , 5 ] . Different actin structures underlie different functions . For example , while dense structures of actin in the axon initial segment of neurons can mediate myosin - mediated anchoring of cargoes , cortical actin structures can drive directional motility in epithelial cells [ 6 , 7 ] . Therefore , understand - ing the nanoscale organization of the actin and microtubule Erwin J . G . Peterman ( ed . ) , Single Molecule Analysis : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1665 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 7271 - 5 _ 9 , © Springer Science + Business Media LLC 2018 155 cytoskeleton is important to understand the mechanisms and func - tions of these specialized structures . Conventional ﬂuorescence microscopy is widely available and continues to be a powerful tool to provide new insights in cytoskel - eton organization and dynamics . Better objectives , faster cameras as well as genetic tools , and immunocytochemistry can be used to label and image individual proteins with high speciﬁcity and tem - poral resolution . However , conventional ﬂuorescent microscopy is limited by the diffraction of light , which causes ﬂuorophores to be imaged as a spatially extended structure of 200 – 300 nm . This detected pattern of a single ﬂuorophore on the camera is called the Point Spread Function ( PSF ) which is shaped like an airy disk . When two ﬂuorophores emit light at the same time while they are very close , the airy disks overlap and cannot be separated . This phenomenon limits the distance at which you can separate two ﬂuorophores or structures to approximately half the wavelength of the detected light . During the last decade several ﬂuorescence - based microscopy techniques have been developed that are not limited by diffraction [ 8 , 9 ] . Single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) is a super - resolution technique based on the sequential detection of individ - ual ﬂuorophores and subsequent midpoint determination with nanometer precision . All detected ﬂuorophores that label the struc - ture of interest can result in a single reconstructed image where all ﬂuorophore locations are plotted with high precision [ 10 ] . Techniques that are based on SMLM are PALM ( Photoactivated Localization Microscopy— [ 11 ] ) , STORM ( Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy— [ 10 ] ) , dSTORM ( direct STORM— [ 12 ] ) , GSDIM ( Ground - State - Depletion and Single - Molecule return— [ 13 ] ) , and PAINT ( Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography— [ 14 ] ) . In ﬁxed samples ( d ) STORM pro - vides the highest resolution and is therefore commonly used to study the exact architecture of the cytoskeleton beyond the diffrac - tion limit . One important breakthrough was the discovery of the periodic actin and spectrin rings in the axon [ 15 ] . A major limita - tion of dSTORM is the limited number of ﬂuorophores compatible with robust multicolor imaging . Another limitation of dSTORM is the use of high laser intensities to bring the majority of the ﬂuor - ophores in a dark - state so that individual molecules can be detected . This results in overall bleaching of ﬂuorophores and reduces the amount of detections over time . Additionally , achieving such high laser intensities often requires illumination of only a small area of the sample . PAINT - like methods overcome these limitations . They rely on the transient binding of ﬂuorophores targeted to the structure of interest . Weakly interacting probes coupled to a ﬂuorophore will bind stochastically , serve as point emitter for a limited time and diffuse back into solution ( Fig . 1a ) [ 16 ] . The imaging solution can 156 Roderick P . Tas et al . then be washed and a second structure can be imaged using a similar or different ﬂuorophore targeted to a different structure . The overall advantage of this technique lies within the transient binding . Unlike dSTORM , there is no need for high laser intensi - ties to bring the majority of ﬂuorophores to a dark state . In addi - tion , the probes on the target are continuously replaced by fresh probes from solution resulting in a continuing imaging cycle not limited by bleaching . Furthermore , PAINT - like SMLM can be performed using a wide variety of ﬂuorophores for multicolor imaging . A limiting factor for PAINT - type approaches is the need for proper transiently interacting probes . Recently , a generic approach for PAINT , DNA - PAINT , was introduced in which structures labeled with an antibody conjugated to single - stranded DNA can be imaged very speciﬁcally with complementary DNA coupled to a Diffusing in solution On Target x x x x x x x xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Imaging and Fitting ~ 20 - 40 . 000 frames Reconstruction a b Ni 2 + Cys S H 6 x h i s O O N Organic Dye + lifeAct Imidazole elution no labelling Cys S H 6 x h i s Labelling + PreScission Cleavage Cys S O O N SMLM 1 2 Bacterial Expression and extraction Ni - NTA bead GFP Fig . 1 Single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) by transient binding . ( a ) Principle of SMLM by transient binding . From solution , ﬂuorophores targeted by a speciﬁc molecule transiently bind to the structure of interest so that single molecules can be observed . These single - molecule events are recorded through time . Subsequently midpoint determination and reconstruction lead to a super - resolved image .

Alternatively , protein – protein interactions can be used to target ﬂuorophores to the desired structure . It has been shown that using small protein fragments / peptides coupled to a ﬂuorophore , SMLM by transient binding could be performed on actin and other cytoskeleton structures . The major advantage of these interactions is that they are highly speciﬁc and can rely on very small probes . Recent work showed that using these transient pro - tein – protein interactions , the actin cytoskeleton can be visualized in high detail by lifeAct coupled to an Atto - dye [ 17 ] . LifeAct is a small 17 - amino acid fragment of the yeast Abp140 protein that was found to label actin [ 18 ] . Whereas this work used a commercially obtained synthesized lifeAct probe , we recently developed an approach to purify the lifeAct peptide , either fused to ﬂuorescent proteins or conjugated with organic dyes after puriﬁcation . Here we describe a step - by - step protocol to purify the lifeAct domain for super - resolution microscopy . This method allows for SMLM using either a fused ﬂuorescent protein or using any organic ﬂuorophore coupled by thiol – maleimide chemistry . For this a con - struct that consists of “lifeAct - Cysteine - PreScission Cleavage Site - GFP - 6 (cid:1) His” was created , as shown in Fig . 1 . To perform SMLM using the ﬂuorescent protein module ( GFP ) a rapid his - tag puriﬁ - cation can be performed . To functionalize the small peptide with any organic dye , thiol – maleimide chemistry on the introduced cysteine and subsequent proteolytic cleavage by PreScission prote - ase can be performed ( Fig . 1b ) . The generation of this versatile probe can be extended to other protein fragments to label other structures of interest . 2 Materials All imaging experiments are performed at room temperature unless indicated otherwise . Solutions are dissolved in ultrapure water ( ~ 18 M Ω cm at 25 (cid:3) C ) . During puriﬁcation , buffers and samples are kept on ice to avoid protein degradation . 2 . 1 Puriﬁcation and Labeling 1 .

Because lifeAct coupled to GFP is highly soluble , standard puriﬁcation protocols and buffers are used . For the lifeAct without GFP , the full recom - binant protein is bound to the Ni - NTA beads and the cysteine containing lifeAct fragment is cleaved off by PreScission protease after on - bead labeling . Subsequently free PreScission is captured by glutathione beads . Full recombinant protein coupled to GFP or the short lifeAct fragment coupled to an Alexa dye by the maleimide – - cysteine reaction can be obtained at high yields . However , it should be noted that the free cysteine , which was introduced in the con - struct , is prone to form disulﬁde bonds with other free cysteines in the samples , resulting in precipitation . To overcome this problem , reducing reagents like DTT or TCEP are required at all steps . A detailed step - by - step description of puriﬁcation follows below . 1 . Grow 0 . 8 l E . coli BL21DE3 containing the lifeAct expression plasmid to OD 0 . 6 at 37 (cid:3) C from an overnight 4 ml culture in LB . Induce protein expression by addition of 800 μ L 1 M IPTG to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM . Incubate for 3 . 5 h at 37 (cid:3) C or 16 h overnight at 17 (cid:3) C . 2 . After induction , transfer the bacteria into a centrifuge compat - ible bucket and spin at 4000 (cid:1) g for 30 min at 4 (cid:3) C . Decant supernatant carefully and incubate pellet on ice . Resuspend 160 Roderick P . Tas et al . bacterial pellet in resuspension buffer supplemented with pro - tease inhibitors ( 5 ml / gram bacterial pellet ) and transfer to a 50 ml tube . 3 . To lyse the bacteria , sonicate the bacterial suspension 5 (cid:1) 1 min with 5 min intervals on ice . Intermediate to high sonication powers can be used . 4 . Following sonication , the soluble fraction of the bacterial sus - pension can be separated from the insoluble sample fraction through centrifugation at 18 , 000 (cid:1) g at 4 (cid:3) C for 40 min ( see Note 3 ) . 5 . During centrifugation wash 1 . 0 ml of Ni - NTA resin ( 0 . 5 ml Beads ) in resuspension buffer . Beads can be centrifuged at 1000 (cid:1) g for 3 min with slow deceleration . Supernatant can then be removed by a vacuum pump or pipet and replaced by resuspension buffer . Repeat the bead wash three times in resus - pension buffer with 10 (cid:1) the bead resin volume ( 10 ml ) . 6 . To separate the soluble fraction from the insoluble fraction after centrifugation , transfer the supernatant into a 50 ml tube to separate it from pellet . Typically , the supernatant of bacteria is a yellowish solution . However , because lifeAct is tagged with a GFP , the supernatant can appear more greenish . The pellet should be brown / yellowish , but can also be greenish because it can contain some aggregated protein or non - lysed expressing cells . 7 . Add the washed Ni - NTA beads to the soluble supernatant and incubate at 4 (cid:3) C while gently rolling for 2 h . The His - Tag of the recombinant lifeAct will bind to the beads . 8 . After incubation spin the beads at 1000 (cid:1) g for 3 min with slow deceleration as described before . The lifeAct - Cys - PreScission - Site - GFP - 6 (cid:1) His is now bound to the beads . Supernatant con - taining all other soluble proteins that do not contain a His - Tag can be discarded . 9 . Wash the beads three times as described above in wash buffer to reduce nonspeciﬁc interactions of proteins with the beads . The lifeAct recombinant fragment has 6 (cid:1) His - Tag which binds tightly to Ni - NTA . This speciﬁc interaction will not be dis - rupted by the 30 mM imidazole in the wash buffer . 3 . 2 Puriﬁcation with GFP 1 . To obtain the full lifeAct - Cys - PreScissionSite - GFP - 6 (cid:1) His for SMLM ( see Note 4 ) , the recombinant protein can be eluted by aspiration of the last wash step as described in Subheading 3 . 1 . Addition of 3 . 5 ml Elution Buffer results in the elution of the recombinant His - tagged protein from the beads after 10 min incubation . Beads can be spun down and the supernatant con - taining lifeAct - GFP can be collected . Transient Actin Probe for SMLM 161 2 . The eluted fraction can be used directly for SMLM as described in Subheading 3 . 5 . For long - term storage , exchange the buffer to PBS þ 1 mM DTT using a buffer exchange column , and add 10 % glycerol . Snap - freezing followed by (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C storage is recommended . The purity of the ﬁnal sample can be deter - mined by SDS - page . Typically , this approach yields highly pure samples . 3 . 3 Labeling and Puriﬁcation with Organic Dyes The second mode in which this recombinant lifeAct fragment can be used is by labeling of the introduced cysteine through a malei - mide – thiol interaction . The lifeAct - Cys , coupled to the thiol , can subsequently be cleaved off the GFP - 6 (cid:1) His and further puriﬁed . The overall advantage is that almost all organic dyes and other chemical modiﬁcations are available conjugated to a maleimide . Therefore it can be used to label the lifeAct - Cys fragment with a variety of stable ﬂuorophores , resulting in a high photon yield . Below we describe how the cysteine can be labeled with an Alexa647 through maleimide coupling on the beads , followed by cleavage at the PreScission site . 1 . After the third wash in wash buffer ( Subheading 3 . 1 ) wash the beads three additional times with labeling buffer . Because DTT contains two thiol groups , it is not compatible with maleimide coupling . Replacement with of DTT with TCEP is therefore essential for protein solubility and coupling efﬁciency . 2 . For labeling , aspirate the ﬁnal wash and transfer the beads into a 2 ml Eppendorf . Add 1000 μ l labeling buffer supplemented with 80 μ l of ~ 100 μ M Alexa647 - maleimide ( ~ 8 nmol Alexa647 ) in DMSO and incubate for 4 h at room tempera - ture . After incubation add an additional 60 μ L ~ 100 μ M Alexa647 - maleimide and incubate overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . The maleimide - dye is added in excess and should , if incubation times are long enough , label almost all free cysteines in the sample . 3 . Remove excess dye after labeling through three 1 ml washes in Cleavage Buffer . This buffer allows optimal cleavage at the PreScission cleavage site , releasing lifeAct - Cysteine labeled with Alexa647 while leaving GFP - 6 (cid:1) His bound to the beads . 4 . Cleave lifeAct - Cys - Alexa647 from the Ni - NTA beads by repla - cing the ﬁnal wash step with 70 μ L PreScission protease in 500 μ L Cleavage Buffer for 5 h at 4 (cid:3) C ( or overnight ) while gently rolling . 5 . While cleaving , wash 250 μ l glutathione beads with cleavage buffer as described above . 6 . Capture PreScission protease on the glutathione beads by addi - tion of the prewashed beads to the sample . Now , both PreScis - sion and the GFP - 6 (cid:1) His are bound to the glutathione and Ni - 162 Roderick P . Tas et al . NTA beads respectively while lifeAct - Cys - Alexa647 diffuses in the supernatant . 7 . The supernatant containing soluble lifeAct - Cys - A647 can be collected . The ﬁnal concentration of the lifeAct peptide can be determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid ( BCA ) protein assay [ 24 ] . The labeling efﬁciency can then be determined by mea - suring the dye concentration by spectroscopy and application of Beer - Lambert’s law . Typical concentrations of labeled lifeAct range from 0 . 1 to 1 μ M ( see Note 5 ) . 8 . Finally , supplement the sample with a ﬁnal concentration of 10 % glycerol , snap - freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C . 3 . 4 Sample Preparation Because in super resolution all details and therefore also sample errors are visualized , optimized sample preparation and dense label coverage are essential for a successful ﬁnal reconstruction . Fixations and staining protocols that would result in a smooth diffraction limited image might result in sparsely labeled structures in super resolution . Sample preparation should therefore be optimized for each individual structure or co - labeling of multiple structures . The buffer conditions during ﬁxation also play an important role to preserve cytoskeletal structures . Whereas microtubule ﬁxations are preferentially performed in PEM80 buffer [ 25 ] , cytoskeleton buffer is the ﬁxation buffer of choice for actin [ 15 , 17 ] . Finally , ﬁxatives should be chosen carefully and such that labeling is not perturbed and structures are maintained . Actin structures are pref - erentially ﬁxed by PFA or Glutaraldehyde [ 26 ] . Below a simple and fast sample preparation is described with PFA in cytoskeletal buffer to preserve the actin network . 1 . Pre - warm ﬁxation buffer to 37 (cid:3) C . Remove the medium from the cells coated on coverslips and gently add pre - warmed ﬁxa - tion buffer for 10 min . Triton - X ensures sufﬁcient permeabili - zation of the cells , resulting in release of cytoplasm which allows the lifeAct probe to diffuse freely . Simultaneously , PFA ﬁxes cellular structures like actin . 2 . After ﬁxation aspirate the ﬁxation buffer and wash the sample with d - PBS for 5 min . Even though the samples are ﬁxed , pipet with care not to perturb the samples . Repeat the wash three times . 3 . After washing , block the sample with blocking solution for at least 30 min at room temperature . Blocking reduces the num - ber of unspeciﬁc protein – protein interactions reducing the background signal in the ﬁnal image . 4 . To stain for structures additional to actin , the samples can be further incubated with antibodies after blocking . Antibodies compatible with PFA ﬁxation can be diluted in blocking Transient Actin Probe for SMLM 163 solution and incubated on the sample for at least 1 h at room temperature . Subsequently , the primary antibody incubation can be stopped by three additional 5 - min washes with d - PBS . Cells can then be incubated with a suitable secondary labeled antibody in blocking solution to ﬁnish the staining for the desired structure ( see Note 6 ) . 5 . After blocking and optional staining , the samples are ready to be mounted in d - PBS þ DTT ( see Note 7 ) . A suitable chamber that is compatible with the microscope stage can be used . Open chambers like Ludin chambers for 18 mm round coverslips provide easy access to the imaging medium and allows for the addition or dilution of the lifeAct probe during image acquisition . 3 . 5 Imaging 1 . Secure a sample on the microscope and select a position of interest . Before image acquisition can be started , it is important to select the correct parameters for an optimal super - resolution image . Focusing before acquisition is important to image the correct plane of interest . Because the low concentration of lifeAct used for imaging does not provide a full overview of the cellular outline a co - transfection or staining of an additional marker is favorable . Alternatively , an excess of lifeAct conju - gated to a ﬂuorophore can be added to the sample which results in a faint outline of the cellular actin structures . If the latter is applied , the concentration should be strongly reduced through dilution and bleaching before SMLM acquisition to be able to visualize single molecules ( see Note 8 ) . 2 . For an optimal super - resolution acquisition carefully take the following parameters into account . Optimizing each condition carefully every time can increase the signal - to - noise ratio per imaging session : ( a ) Exposure time . For super resolution based on probe exchange , the on - and off - rates should guide the exposure time . Low off rates allow for high exposure times and collection of more photons . However , a single molecule binding event should not be obscured by another mole - cule binding in the vicinity rendering the software unable to detect them both as separate localizations . The latter has a higher chance at higher on rates . Therefore , a bal - anced exposure time is necessary . For lifeAct the reported half - life on the actin ﬁlaments is 23 ms [ 17 ] and it is preferentially imaged with 50 – 100 ms exposure time . ( b ) Laser Power . Laser power and exposure time are co - dependent on each other and on ﬂuorophore stability . Fluorescent proteins like GFP are easily bleached com - pared to organic dyes . It is important that a maximum 164 Roderick P . Tas et al . amount of photons is collected from one single molecule during the selected exposure time . Therefore , laser power can be varied between probes with higher laser powers for more stable probes ( see Note 7 ) . Because the sample is crowded with diffusing lifeAct - ﬂuorophore molecules the laser power should also be kept at moderate levels to minimize background . Starting at low laser powers and gradually increasing them usually results in the rapid rec - ognition of the optimum laser power . ( c ) Number of collected frames . The more frames can be col - lected , the better . Reconstruction of a single - molecule image preferentially relies only on the most accurate loca - lizations , which can be ﬁltered based on localization pre - cision . Collecting more frames at optimal settings allows more stringent ﬁlters on localization precision , but care should be taken to minimize and correct sample drift . Selecting only the most accurate detection already results in a full overview of the image with high resolution . Typically we record 30 , 000 – 40 , 000 frames . ( d ) Fluorophore density . SMLM relies on the detection of indi - vidual ﬂuorophores conjugated to lifeAct that are binding sequentially . Therefore , lifeAct should be diluted to a concentration such that in every frame single molecules can be observed . In 2D and 3D imaging the plane in focus will be the plane where the point spread function of the single molecules is symmetrical . For SMLM imaging , labeled lifeAct is typically diluted to 1 – 5 nM in d - PBS ( see Note 9 ) . ( e ) Laser angle . Total Internal Reﬂection of the laser at the coverslip – sample interface results in an evanescent wave of typically a few hundred nanometers , which prevents exci - tation of out - of - focus ﬂuorophores . Reducing the inci - dent laser angle results in a more oblique illumination ﬁeld which yields deeper sample penetration and ﬂuoro - phore excitation . The latter can be favorable because of imaging depth , but also increases background ﬂuores - cence . The incident laser angle should thus be adjusted dependent on required imaging depth and the back - ground intensity that is acceptable . 3 . 6 Analysis The ﬁnal super - resolution image is created by accumulation of all single - molecule positions that were acquired during imaging . Single - molecule positions can be accurately determined by ﬁtting the PSF to a Gaussian and determine the midpoint . The midpoint can be localized with nanometer precision based on the width of the Gaussian . Detection / ﬁtting and subsequent reconstruction of the super - resolved image is performed by dedicated software Transient Actin Probe for SMLM 165 packages . There are several freely available packages ( e . g . DoM Utrecht [ 19 ] , RapidSTORM [ 22 ] , ThunderSTORM [ 21 ] , Quick - PALM [ 20 ] ) or commercially available packages to reconstruct a super - resolved image . 1 . Detection and ﬁtting of the imaged ﬂuorophores is dependent on the image parameters as well as on the recorded PSF . The software usually requires input of the pixel size and several threshold values like estimated PSF size to exclude abnormal detections that cannot result from single molecules . The mid - point of included localizations is then determined with nano - meter precision by ﬁtting or maximum likelihood estimation . 2 . The detection and ﬁtting process results in a table that contains information about all the individual detected ﬂuorophores . Fluorophore parameters include : the x - and y - coordinate , the image number in which it was acquired , PSF symmetry ( in x and y ) , PSF shape , PSF brightness etc . 3 . Next , reconstruction of the super - resolution image can be done based on this particle table . All the stored x - and y - coordinate are used to plot the midpoint of these molecules . The midpoint can be plotted as a small Gaussian of a constant size or each midpoint can be plotted as a spot based on its individual localization error . This localization error can be calculated from the ﬁtting parameters and used as a threshold . Fluorophores with more precise localizations can then be plot - ted as tight spots while less well localized ﬂuorophores are represented as more spread localizations . Several parameters should be taken into account while reconstructing the ﬁnal image . The pixel size of the reconstructed image should be selected in such a way that they are at least half the size of the smallest details according to the Nyquist criterion . Further - more , the localizations used in the ﬁnal reconstruction can be ﬁltered on the localization precision . It should be noted that ﬁltering too much or selecting a very low pixel size will eventu - ally result in very sparse localizations . Both these parameters can be varied and optimized per image to obtain a successful and informative super - resolution reconstruction . 4 . Drift correction is a ﬁnal important step in the analysis . Because of the nanometer localization accuracy , any drift of the sample with respect to the objective will be clearly visible in the ﬁnal reconstruction . Long imaging times combined with small ther - mal ﬂuctuations will result in noticeable drift in the ﬁnal recon - struction . The available software packages usually support drift correction based on frame - to - frame cross - correlation of ﬁducial markers or cross - correlation of intermediate super - resolution reconstructions [ 27 , 28 ] . The ﬁducial markers can be small particles like beads that are ﬁxed to the coverslip and do not 166 Roderick P . Tas et al . move within the sample . When drift correction based on inter - mediate super - resolution reconstructions is applied , a frame interval should be chosen in such a way that the images can be correctly correlated and drift can be detected ( see Note 9 ) . 5 . An example of a successful super - resolution reconstruction of actin , imaged with either GFP or Alexa647 coupled to lifeAct is shown in Fig . 2 . 4 Notes 1 .

Optimizing protein yields . ( a ) A greenish bacterial pellet usually indicates sufﬁcient expression . ( b ) During each step samples for SDS page can be taken to determine the presence of recombinant protein . ( c ) Release of soluble protein after lysis can be increased by the addition of small amounts of lysozyme to weaken the bacterial cell wall . ( d ) Overall low soluble protein levels can occur because the recombinant lifeAct can enter into inclusions bodies at too high concentrations . This can be prevented by reducing induction time to only a few hours at 20 (cid:3) C . In addition , DTT concentration can be increased to prevent disulﬁde - bond formation after lysis . 4 . Alternative construct for ﬂuorescent protein imaging only . When lifeAct is only used conjugated to GFP or other ﬂuores - cent proteins , removal of the cysteine and PreScission site could result in higher solubility and protein yields . 5 . In case of low labeling efﬁciency of lifeAct - Cysteine : ( a ) Measure the amount of labeled lifeAct by BCA assay and the concentration of labeled lifeAct as described in Sub - heading 3 . 4 . When the protein concentration is much higher than the concentration of the ﬂuorophore , the sample is most likely unsaturated due to an inefﬁcient maleimide – thiol reaction or because too little dye was added during the reaction . In the latter case , repeat the puriﬁcation with an increased dye concentration . The ﬂuorophore to lifeAct - cysteine ratio should be 10 – 20 . ( b ) In case of poor reaction efﬁciency , also check the pH of the buffers . Furthermore , make sure that DTT is washed from the solution and that TCEP exceeds the protein concen - tration approximately tenfold to reduce unwanted disul - ﬁde bond formation of the available cysteines . 6 . Alternative protocol for multicolor super resolution : ( a ) Alternative to the protocol described in Subheading 3 . 4 an extraction and ﬁxation protocol more optimal for co - staining with microtubules can be used . In Short : pre - 168 Roderick P . Tas et al . extract in 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde þ 0 . 3 % Triton - X in PEM80 for 1 min ( 37 (cid:3) C ) . Replace pre - extraction with 4 % PFA in PEM80 ( 37 (cid:3) C ) for 7 min . Proceed with washing as described in Subheading 3 . 4 and add an extra permeabilization step of 0 . 25 % Triton - X in d - PBS for 8 min followed by three more washes and blocking . Use primary labeled antibodies or nanobodies against tubulin to speed up the staining process [ 19 ] . ( b ) Secondary antibodies can be labeled with a variety of functionalized probes . When super - resolution imaging of actin by lifeAct needs to be combined with dSTORM super - resolution imaging of the second structure , Alexa647 is the best label to be used on the secondary antibody . Alexa647 has rapid blinking properties in PBS supplemented with glucose oxygen scavenger [ 25 ] . LifeAct - based protein - PAINT is compatible with this buffer . 7 . The rapid blinking properties make Alexa647 extremely suit - able for dSTORM . However , when lifeAct - Cysteine is used for PAINT - like super resolution through transient binding a more stable ﬂuorophore is required . Labeling lifeAct - Cysteine with other organic dyes might result in a higher photon yield . Alternatively , addition of methylviologen ( MV ) and ascorbic acid ( AA ) in the imaging buffer will stabilize Alexa647 signiﬁ - cantly [ 29 , 30 ] . Concentrations of MV and AA can be varied between 50 μ M and 1 mM to optimize photon yield and binding properties . 8 . Cell morphology and structures appear to be affected after ﬁxation . Handle samples carefully . Samples are very fragile during extraction and ﬁxation . Always pipet at the sides of the dish and not directly on the sample because sheer stress can perturb the cell integrity even when ﬁxed . Take extra care while handling samples that are sensitive to ﬁxation techniques like neurons and thick samples . 9 . Super - resolution reconstruction is unclear : ( a ) SMLM relies on the localizations of truly individual ﬂuor - ophores . Too little localizations will result in a dotty image that can be enhanced by an increase of the pixel size . This will increase the amount of localizations per pixels . How - ever , labeling density can also be too high . When two ﬂuorophores emit light too close together the PSFs will obscure each other and result in mislocalization and poor localization errors . False and poorly localized detections will result in a loss of details . ( b ) Adjust drift interval and other parameters of drift correc - tion . Incorrect drift correction can be clearly visible as a jumped image but sometimes also more subtle as a blurry reconstruction . Transient Actin Probe for SMLM 169 References 1 .
