Twisted push − pull sca ﬀ olds with large and bright dithienothiophenes and their S , S - dioxides as the ﬁ rst “ ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers ” are shown to report on the lateral organization of lipid bilayers with quantum yields above 80 % and lifetimes above 4 ns . Their planarization in liquid - ordered ( L o ) and solid - ordered ( S o ) membranes results in red shifts in excitation of up to + 80 nm that can be transcribed into red shifts in emission of up to + 140 nm by Fo ̈ rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . These unique properties are compatible with multidomain imaging in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) and cells by confocal laser scanning or ﬂ uorescence lifetime imaging microscopy . Controls indicate that strong push − pull macrodipoles are important , operational probes do not relocate in response to lateral membrane reorganization , and two ﬂ ippers are indeed needed to “ really swim , ” i . e . , achieve high mechanosensitivity . T o uncover the secrets of biological membranes , that is , their order , homogeneity , tension , potential , and so on , many inspired approaches to ﬂ uorescent probes have been conceived over the years . 1 They explore the usefulness of excited - state polarization ( intramolecular charge transfer in push − pull chromophores , solvatochromism , electrochromism ) , 2 twisted intramolecular charge transfer ( TICT ) , 3 excited - state intra - molecular proton transfer ( ESIPT ) , 4 Fo ̈ rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) , 5 photoinduced electron transfer ( PET ) , 6 two - photon absorption ( TPA ) , 7 second harmonic generation ( SHG ) , 8 ﬂ uorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) , 9 and λ - ratiometry . 10 Recently , we have introduced the concept of planarizable push − pull probes ( Figure 1A ) . 11 This combination of polarization 1 , 2 , 12 and planarization 13 is interesting because it applies lessons from nature 11 , 12 and promises access to the imaging not only of the lateral organization of biomem - branes 2 , 3 , 5 − 8 but also of membrane potentials 1 , 3 − 5 , 7 , 8 , 12 and the poorly detectable but biologically important membrane tension . 14 Focusing on ground - state planarization and thus changes in the excitation spectrum , 11 planarizable push − pull probes can be envisioned as complementary to molecular rotors that operate with excited - state deplanarization and , thus , as most other ﬂ uorescent probes , with changes in emission or quantum yield . 3 , 9 The concept of planarizable push − pull probes has been elaborated with oligothiophenes . 11 Meticulous sculpting with regard to length , donors , acceptors as well as a comprehensive coverage of the quaterthiophene twistome gave probe 1 that could visualize the ﬂ uidity of lipid bilayer membranes for the “ naked eye ” ( Figure 1A ) . Most importantly , it was found that intermediate twisting was ideal , whereas weak twists gave poor shifts because there is little to planarize and strong twists gave poor shifts because planarization became too hard . However , with oligothiophenes , 15 red shifts obtained upon planarization in S o lipid bilayers could reach only up to Δ λ ex = + 44 nm , and ﬂ uorescence became very weak with increasing twisting . These limitations were attributed to the poor mechanosensitivity of the small thiophene ring and the negligible ﬂ uorescence of isolated thiophene monomers in twisted oligomers . To overcome these two limitations , monomers with large surface area and high intrinsic quantum yield would have to be incorporated into the twisted oligomers . In the following , the term “ ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers ” ( or swim ﬁ ns ) is used as a “ symbol ” for such large and bright monomers intwisted oligomers because , although not fully ﬁ tting with regard to all aspects , they provide a helpful memorizer that associates correctly with the characteristics of interest ( Figure 1B ) . The previously explored thiophene monomers 11 failed to perform as ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers because they do not ﬂ uoresce and their surface area is too small to feel the environment well . Here , we introduce dithienothiophenes and their S , S - dioxides 16 as the ﬁ rst ﬂ uorescent molecular ﬂ ippers and show that the new push − pull mechanophore 2 provides access to membrane probes with high mechanosensitivity and long ﬂ uorescence lifetime . Flipper probe 2 was designed as follows ( Figure 1B ) . The twist between the dithienothiophene and the dithienothiophene S , S - dioxide ﬂ ipper was induced with two proximal methyl groups . To enhance the push − pull system , the electron - de ﬁ cient dithieno - thiophene S , S - dioxide was terminated with an aldehyde acceptor , whereas the electron - rich dithienothiophene was terminated with a methylene donor . A negative charge was added at the donor terminus to ensure delivery to and oriented partitioning into lipid bilayer membranes . Fluorophores 4 − 6 were designed as controls with either reduced macrodipole or one ﬂ ipper only . The synthesis of mechanophore 2 is outlined in Scheme 1 . Bromothiophene 7 was converted into the dithienothiophene monomer 8 following reported procedures . 16 Vilsmeier for - mylation a ﬀ orded the key intermediate 9 .

Reduction of aldehyde 9 followed by silyl protection of the obtained alcohol gave dithienothiophene 12 . Stille coupling of 11 and 12 gave the double ﬂ ipper 13 , deprotection and esteri ﬁ cation with the cyclic anhydride 14 the target probe 2 . Double - ﬂ ipper control 4 was accessible in a few steps from 13 , single ﬂ ipper 6 from intermediate 12 , donor 3 and control 5 were prepared similarly ( Schemes S2 − S4 ) . The absorption maximum of the push − pull system in ﬂ ipper probe 2 in chloroform was at λ abs = 435 nm ( Figure S5 ) . The emission maximum showed signi ﬁ cant solvatochromism from 530 to almost 700 nm ( Figure S5 ) . Lippert analysis 11 of the dependence of the Stokes shift on solvent polarity gave a variation of permanent dipole moment upon excitation of Δ μ = 14 D ( Table S1 ) . In comparison , blue - shifted absorption in chloroform at 418 nm and with Δ μ = 11 D weaker solvatochromism con ﬁ rmed that the push − pull system of 4 is weaker than that of 2 . The ﬂ uorescence quantum yield of the push − pull system of 2 in chloroform was ϕ = 83 % ( control 4 , ϕ = 66 % ; 5 , ϕ = 32 % ; cf , 1 , ϕ = 20 % 11 ) . This excellent value compared very well with the reported quantum yields of dithienothiophene S , S - dioxides 16 and thus con ﬁ rmed that chromophore twisting does not reduce ﬂ uorescence . Dependent on the nature of the phospholipids used , bilayer membranes undergo a sharp transition from liquid - disordered ( L d ) or ﬂ uid phase to solid - ordered ( S o ) or gel phase at a characteristic temperature , the chain - melting temperature T m . 1 , 3 , 11 , 17 With increasing concentration of cholesterol , this phase transition disappears , and the mixed membranes exist permanently in the liquid - ordered ( L o ) phase , which is characterized by short - range orientational order and long - range translational disorder . 17 In multicomponent bilayers , binary mixtures of lipids with cholesterol and beyond , L o and L d membranes can coexist as immiscible microdomains . 1 , 3 , 11 Viscosity and elastic modulus increase from L d over L o to S o phase , whereas lateral di ﬀ usion decreases . For example , di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cients in L o are about 3 to 5 times smaller than in L d phase . 17 Viscosity increases from 100 − 300 cP in L d to up to 1300 cP in S o phase . 3a The mechanosensitivity of ﬂ ipper probe 2 was evaluated in large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) . LUVs composed of DPPC ( dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ) have a S o − L d tran - sition at 41 ° C . The excitation spectrum of 1 . 0 μ M 2 ( 1 . 3 mol % ) added to L d DPPC LUVs at 55 ° C showed two maxima at λ ex = 453 nm and λ ex = 329 nm of equal intensity ( Δ F ex1 / F ex2 = 0 . 97 , Figure 2A , red , solid ) . The Δ λ ex = + 18 nm from chloroform suggested that ﬂ ipper probe 2 could already be partially planarized in L d DPPC . Cooled down to 25 ° C , an intense peak with a ﬂ at maximum λ ex = 498 − 533 nm emerged , accompanied by a sharper but weaker band at λ ex = 352 nm ( Δ F ex 1 / F ex 2 = 1 . 48 , Figure 2A , blue , solid ) . A red shift of up to Δ λ ex = + 80 nm in response to L d − S o transition , obtained with the ﬁ rst unoptimized ﬂ ippers , clearly exceeded Δ λ ex = + 44 nm of the best ﬂ ipper - free probe 1 . This ﬁ nding supported that increasing surface area in twisted push − pull probes increases mechano - sensitivity , as expected from “ ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers . ” Several control experiments were conceived to probe the validity of these important conclusions . The temperature independence of the excitation maxima of 2 in DOPC ( dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ) was important because DOPC membranes are always in L d phase ( Figure 2A , dotted ) . Excluding thermochromism , this ﬁ nding supported that the up to Δ λ ex = + 80 nm found in S o DPPC originates indeed from ground - state planarization of the twisted ﬂ ippers . The concentration independence of the spectroscopic properties , most importantly , excluded contributions from aggregation 13 to the mechanosensi - tivity of 2 ( Figure S4 ) . The insensitivity of the emission maxima of 2 at λ em = 600 nm to temperature , concentration , lipid composition and lateral organization ( Figure 2B ) supported that Figure 1 . ( A ) Planarizable push − pull probes are conjugated oligomers with electron donors ( D ) and acceptors ( A ) at their termini and bulky twist inducers along the sca ﬀ old ( red circles ) ; their planarization in lipid bilayers is expected to report on membrane order , potential and tension ( horizontal gray arrows ) . ( B ) Fluorescent ﬂ ippers , i . e . , monomers in twisted push − pull probes with high surface area and ﬂ uorescence , are introduced to maximize mechanosensitivity and ﬂ uorescence lifetime . Double - ﬂ ipper probe 2 is shown together with FRET donor 3 ( B ) , push − pull control 4 , single - ﬂ ipper controls 5 and 6 ( C ) and original oligothiophene 1 ( A ) . Scheme 1 a a ( a ) 1 .

Soc . 2015 , 137 , 568 − 571 569 the ﬁ rst relaxed excited state is fully planarized in all environments , and excluded contributions from solvatochrom - ism . Clearly , the twisted ﬂ ippers 2 act very di ﬀ erently from ordinary push − pull membrane probes . 1 − 3 Double - ﬂ ipper control 4 with reduced macrodipole gave not only an overall blue - shifted excitation maximum ( λ ex = 486 nm ; 2 : λ ex = 498 − 533 nm ) but also an incomplete planarization in S o membranes ( λ ex = 420 nm observed in L d membranes was partially preserved , Δ F ex1 / F ex2 = 1 . 1 , Figure 2C ) . Nevertheless , the red shift Δ λ ex = + 66 nm of 4 in response to planarization remained signi ﬁ cant ( 2 : Δ λ ex = + 45 to + 80 nm ) . All single - ﬂ ipper controls prepared and tested were useless because of poor partitioning ( 6 , Figure S2 ) or mechanosensitivity ( 5 , Figure S3 ) . Fluorescence depth quenching was used to explore probe repositioning upon membrane reorganization . 18 DPPC vesicles were labeled with DOXYL - PC probes carrying the quencher either in position 5 or 12 of the lipid tails ( Figure 1B ) . Parallax analysis of the di ﬀ erent quenching e ﬃ ciencies of 5 - and 12 - DOXYL - PC gave z cf , that is the traverse distance z from the plane of the bilayer center to the plane containing the ﬂ uorophore ( Figures S8 , S9 ) . The z cf = 15 . 1 Å obtained for 2 exceeded z cf = 9 . 6 Å of 4 and z cf = 1 . 6 Å of 3 clearly ( Figure 1 ) . Assuming that positioning is determined by external charges and coaxial alignment with the lipid tails ( Figure 1 ) , z cf decreasing with 2 > 4 > 3 suggested that quenching occurs preferably near the donor terminus of push − pull ﬂ uorophores . Coaxial probe alignment with lipid tails was in agreement with preliminary results from ﬂ uorescence anisotropy measurements in GUVs , depth quench - ing by hole transfer was consistent with the literature . 19 Cooling down from L d into S o DPPC , the z cf of ﬂ ipper 2 decreased from z cf = 15 . 1 Å to z cf = 12 . 3 Å , i . e . , Δ z cf = − 2 . 8 Å ( 4 , Δ z cf = 0 Å ; 3 , Δ z cf = + 2 . 1 Å ) . This very minor probe repositioning upon membrane reorganization is quite remarkable . Mismatched objects are not often tolerated in crystalline S o membranes and usually simply ejected . 20 Depth quenching experiments thus provided powerful experimental support that the up to Δ λ ex = + 80 nm observed upon L d to S o phase change originates indeed from planarization of the twisted push − pull mechanophore 2 and not a change in location of the ﬂ uorophore . Fluorescence lifetimes of 2 increased from 2 . 2 ns in L d DOPC LUVs to 4 . 3 ns in S o DPPC LUVs ( Figure 2D , circles ) . Clearly better than those of the ﬂ ipper - free original 1 ( DOPC , 0 . 47 ns ; DPPC , 0 . 76 ns , Figure 2D , squares ) , these lifetimes are in the range of established bioprobes , 3a and thus demonstrate compatibility of ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers 2 with FLIM . Preliminary results with GUVs fully support this conclusion . In agreement with the high ϕ = 83 % found in CHCl 3 , these ﬁ ndings provide corroborative evidence for the validity of the concept of ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers . Partition coe ﬃ cients measured 21 for ﬂ ipper 2 indicated a weak preference for L d membranes over S o membranes at 25 ° C ( DPPC , K x = 7 . 7 × 10 4 ; DOPC , K x = 1 . 3 × 10 5 , Figure S10 ) . Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) of GUVs composed of SM / DOPC / CL 58 : 25 : 17 ( SM : sphingomyelin , CL : cholesterol ) and labeled with ﬂ ipper 2 showed two domains , which light up by exciting at di ﬀ erent wavelengths ( Figure 3A , λ ex = 480 nm , green ; Figure 3B , λ ex = 560 nm , red ; Figure 3C , merged ) . Co - labeling experiments with a commercial probe for the L d phase ( cyan , λ ex = 630 nm , Figure 3E ) con ﬁ rmed that the emission observed upon excitation at longer wavelength ( red , λ ex = 551 nm , Figure 3E ) arises from ﬂ ipper 2 in the L o phase ( red , Figure 3B ) . Twisted push − pull ﬂ ippers report on their environment with shifts of their excitation maxima . Although unproblematic for ﬂ uorescence imaging ( Figure 3 ) , shifts in emission rather than Figure 2 .

Soc . 2015 , 137 , 568 − 571 570 excitation are preferable for biological probes . To transcribe shifts in excitation to shifts in emission , terthiophene 3 was considered as FRET donor for mechanophore 2 ( Figure 1 ) . Donor 3 exhibited a mechanoinsensitive hypsochromic λ ex = 400 nm in DOPC and DPPC membranes ( Figure 2E , dashed , cyan and purple ) . In this region , the excitation of ﬂ ipper 2 is weak and mechanoinsensitive ( Figure 2E , dotted , blue , red ) . Flipper 2 will thus not interfere signi ﬁ cantly with the excitation of donor 3 under varied conditions . The emission maximum of donor 3 at λ em = 460 nm ( Figure 2F , dashed , cyan ) coincided roughly with the excitation maxima of ﬂ ipper 2 in DOPC ( Figure 2F , dotted , black ) and DPPC ( Figure 2F , dotted , gray ) . In DOPC LUVs colabeled with donor 3 and acceptor 2 at equal concentrations , excitation of donor 3 at 405 nm gave an emission spectrum with dominant donor emission at λ em = 460 nm ( Figure 2F , dashed , red ) . In DPPC LUVs under identical conditions , a signi ﬁ cant new maximum appeared at λ em = 600 nm ( Figure 2F , solid , blue ) . This di ﬀ erence was consistent with the occurrence of signi ﬁ cant FRET to the planarized , more ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ipper 2 in S o membranes and negligible FRET to the deplanarized , less ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ipper 2 in L d membranes . Control experiments under identical conditions in DPPC with original probe 1 in place of ﬂ ipper 2 did not a ﬀ ord signi ﬁ cant FRET because of insu ﬃ cient ﬂ uorescence of acceptor 1 . These results demonstrate that the transcription of the red shift up to Δ λ ex = + 80 nm achieved by ground - state planarization of push − pull ﬂ ippers 2 to Δ λ em = + 140 nm in emission is possible with FRET . Taken together , these results describe the ﬁ rst mechanosensi - tive push − pull probe that ( a ) operates , with all likelihood , by planarization of single isolated mechanophores in the ground state ( rather than the formation or rearrangement of aggregates ) and ( b ) o ﬀ ers properties that are su ﬃ cient for use in practice . This breakthrough was achieved with the introduction of “ ﬂ uorescent ﬂ ippers ” ( large , bright monomers ) . They provide access to the mechanosensitivity and ﬂ uorescence lifetime needed for biological applications ( i . e . , Δ λ ex up to + 80 nm ( from ground - state planarization ) , Δ λ em = + 140 nm ( transcribed by FRET ) , Δ τ = 2 . 1 ns , ϕ > 80 % ) . Current e ﬀ orts focus on the polishing of the operational ﬂ ippers with regard to twist , macrodipole and terminal charges , on covalent FRET probes , and on applications toward biophysical and biological questions related to membrane order , potential and tension . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Detailed experimental procedures .
