Pathogenic variants in DCC frequently lead to congenital mirror movements ( CMM ) , but how these variants impact DCC function is largely unknown . Screening of DCC in individuals with CMM recently revealed a novel variant located in a conserved motif in the cytoplasmic tail of DCC that is predicted to bind to a central actin nucleation promoting factor , the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . Here , we use biochemical and axon guidance assays to show that this CMM - associated DCC variant is pathogenic by disrupting the interaction between DCC and the WRC . This DCC - WRC interaction is evolutionarily conserved and is required for Netrin - 1 mediated commissural axon outgrowth and guidance . Together , we identify the WRC as a pivotal component of Netrin - 1 / DCC signaling and further provide a molecular mechanism explaining how genetic variants in DCC may lead to CMM . 3 INTRODUCTION In bilaterally symmetric organisms , precise control of midline crossing of axonal tracts is essential for proper coordination of the two sides of the body . During the development of the nervous system , commissural neurons extend their axons across the midline to form connections on the contralateral side in response to attractive guidance cues secreted by midline and other cells ( Gorla and Bashaw , 2020 ) . Netrin - 1 is one such conserved guidance cue , which acts through its receptor Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma ( DCC ) , or Frazzled ( Fra ) in Drosophila , to induce attraction toward the midline ( Moore et al . , 2007 ) . Studies in humans and rodents have shown that the Netrin - 1 / DCC pathway is vital for proper midline connectivity , including normal formation of the corpus callosum and midline crossing of both corticospinal tract ( CST ) axons and spinal commissural axons . Pathogenic variants of DCC cause a spectrum of neurological disorders , including agenesis of the corpus callosum , familial horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis - 2 with impaired intellectual development ( HGPPS2 ) , and congenital mirror movement ( CMM ) disorder ( Izzi and Charron , 2011 ; Jamuar et al . , 2017 ; Marsh et al . , 2017 ; Srour et al . , 2010 ; Welniarz et al . , 2017 ) . CMM is characterized by involuntary movements on one side of the body that mimic voluntary movements on the opposite side . The molecular mechanisms of how pathogenic DCC variants lead to CMM , however , are largely unknown . DCC is thought to respond to Netrin - 1 and induce axon turning predominantly by modulating the actin cytoskeleton . Considerable experimental evidence supports important roles for the Rho family GTPases ( Rac1 and Cdc42 ) , Src family kinases , and Ena / VASP proteins in DCC - mediated axon attraction in vitro ( Boyer et al . , 2020 ; Briançon - Marjollet et al . , 2008 ; Lebrand et al . , 2004 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ; Menon et al . , 2015 ; Meriane et al . , 2004 ; Shekarabi and Kennedy , 2002 ) . However , in vivo data that clearly ascribes these downstream effectors to the 4 DCC pathway during axon guidance are largely limited to studies in Drosophila and C . elegans ( Chang et al . , 2006 ; Demarco et al . , 2012 ; Forsthoefel et al . , 2005 ; Gitai et al . , 2003 ; O ' Donnell and Bashaw , 2013a ) . Moreover , whether other downstream effectors link DCC to the actin cytoskeleton during axon guidance remains obscure . Most of the pathogenic variants identified in human DCC that give rise to CMM and agenesis of the corpus callosum are in the extracellular domain of the receptor . These mutations are thought to function by disrupting binding of DCC to Netrin - 1 , generating truncated proteins , or causing haploinsufficiency of the full length DCC ( Marsh et al . , 2017 ) . To date , existing pathogenic variants of DCC have not shed light on potential downstream signaling pathways that are important for Netrin - 1 / DCC - dependent axon guidance . Furthermore , few studies evaluate the pathogenic relevance of any of these variants using physiologically relevant guidance assays . Through sequencing of DCC in a cohort of CMM individuals , we recently identified a novel missense DCC variant associated with CMM in a highly conserved cytoplasmic motif of DCC . This motif fits the consensus sequence of the previously identified WRC - interacting receptor sequence ( WIRS ) , which is found in various membrane receptors and can directly bind to the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , a central regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . The WRC contains five different subunits , CYFIP1 , ABI2 , NCKAP1 ( NAP1 ) , BRK1 ( HSPC300 ) , and WAVE1 ( or their corresponding orthologs ) , and stimulates the Arp2 / 3 complex to produce branched actin networks ( Kramer et al . , 2022b ; Rottner et al . , 2021 ; Rotty et al . , 2013 ) . That a CMM - associated variant resides in the WIRS motif of DCC suggests the WRC may play an important role in DCC signaling in axon guidance and that disruption of the DCC - WRC interaction may cause CMM . 5 However , whether DCC directly interacts with the WRC and , if so , how this interaction contributes to axon guidance or the pathogenesis of CMM are unknown . Here , we show that the DCC - WRC interaction is an essential and conserved component of DCC / Fra - mediated axon growth and guidance . We show that DCC / Fra can directly interact with the WRC via the WIRS motif . We further validated this interaction in commissural axon growth cones . Mutations in DCC that disrupt the WIRS motif , including the CMM - associated variant , reduce WRC binding and impair Netrin - 1 - dependent axon outgrowth . Furthermore , the WIRS motif in DCC is required for Netrin - 1 - mediated axon guidance in commissural neurons in vitro , and the WIRS motif in Fra is required for commissural axon guidance at the Drosophila midline in vivo . Moreover , genetic interaction experiments indicate that the WRC acts in the Fra pathway to promote axon growth across the midline . Finally , we used the developing Drosophila central nervous system ( CNS ) to show that the CMM - associated DCC variant is defective in axon guidance in vivo . Together , our findings highlight an essential and conserved role for the WIRS - WRC interaction in DCC / Fra attractive signaling in axon guidance and offer new insights into the role of DCC variants in the pathogenesis of CMM . RESULTS The cytoplasmic domain of DCC directly binds to the WRC The cytoplasmic domain of human DCC contains a predicted WIRS motif ( LRSFAN , amino acids ( aa ) 1342 - 1347 ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , which can potentially interact with the WRC . This motif is conserved from humans to Drosophila ( Figure 1A ) . To test if DCC indeed interacts with the WRC , we co - expressed HA - tagged DCC WT with FLAG - tagged WAVE1 , a subunit of the WRC , in HEK293 cells . Immunoprecipitation ( IP ) of WAVE1 results in the co - IP of DCC WT , 6 suggesting that the WRC interacts with DCC in cells . To test whether the interaction between DCC and the WRC is mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of DCC , we co - expressed DCC Δcyto , a construct lacking the cytoplasmic domain of DCC , with WAVE1 . In contrast to DCC WT , DCC Δcyto does not co - immunoprecipitate with WAVE1 ( Figure 1B , C ) , confirming that the cytoplasmic domain of DCC is required for its interaction with the WRC . To test if the interaction is direct , we performed pull - down assays using purified recombinant proteins and previously established protocols ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . In the purified human WRC , the N terminus of the HSPC300 subunit was fused to two maltose binding proteins , ( MBP ) 2 , which can immobilize the WRC to amylose beads to facilitate pull - down assays ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . We found that the immobilized ( MBP ) 2 - WRC robustly retains the purified , GST - tagged cytoplasmic domain of DCC ( GST - DCC cyto ) ( Figure 1D ) , indicating that DCC cyto directly interacts with the WRC . By contrast , this binding signal is substantially reduced when we used a mutant WRC in which the WIRS - binding pocket on the WRC is disrupted by point mutations , R106A / G110W , in Abi2 ( WRC AW ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . This result suggests the interaction between DCC cyto and the WRC is primarily mediated by the WIRS motif . A mirror movement DCC variant in the WIRS motif disrupts WRC binding to DCC Mutations in DCC can cause CMM ( Srour et al . , 2010 ) . By screening all the protein coding exons and flanking regions of DCC using next generation sequencing in DNA samples from a cohort of CMM individuals , we recently identified novel pathogenic variants in DCC associated with CMM ( manuscript in preparation ) . Among them , one DCC variant results in a single amino acid change in the WIRS motif ( NM _ 005215 , c . 4028G > A , p . R1343H ) ( Figure 1A , Figure 2A ) . This variant is extremely rare in controls ( alternate allele frequency = 0 . 000107 in 7 gnomAD 2 . 1 . 1 ) , and it is predicted to be disease - causing by in silico tools ( Mutationtaster , Polyphen , SIFT ) ; however , according to ACMG ( American college of medical genetics ) criteria , this variant is still considered of unknown significance . Thus , functional studies are needed to confirm the pathogenicity of this variant , and to determine whether it results in either a loss or gain of DCC function . Importantly , the R1343 residue is conserved across mammalian species and has only conservative changes in more distant species ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that this residue may have an important function . To test if the R1343H mutation affects binding to the WRC , we generated DCC constructs containing either the R1343H mutation identified in the CMM case ( DCC R1343H ) or mutations at the two central amino acids of the WIRS motif ( p . SF1344 - 1345AA , DCC ΔWIRS ) , which were previously shown to abolish the interaction between other WIRS - containing proteins and the WRC ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . We first verified that DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H do not affect DCC membrane localization or binding to Netrin - 1 . For this , we used a cell surface binding assay where the binding of Netrin VI . V - Fc to DCC WT expressed by COS - 7 cells is measured by immunofluorescent detection of cell surface bound Netrin VI . V - Fc ( Keino - Masu et al . , 1996 ) . Netrin VI . V - Fc , but not the control Fc , binds to COS - 7 cells expressing DCC WT ( Figure 2B ) . No non - specific binding due to the Fc fragment or non - specific signal due to the antibodies used for immunostaining is observed ( Figure 2B , S1A ) . In COS - 7 cells expressing similar levels of DCC ΔWIRS , DCC R1343H , or DCC WT ( Figure S1B ) , there is no significant difference in the amount of Netrin VI . V - Fc bound to the cell surface ( Figure 2B , C ) . This result confirms that the mutations in the WIRS motif do not affect DCC expression , trafficking or binding to Netrin - 1 . After validating that DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H are expressed on the cell membrane , we tested the effect of these mutations on the interaction with the WRC by co - IP with WAVE1 . 8 Immunoprecipitation of WAVE1 results in significantly lower amounts of both DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H in the co - immunoprecipitate compared to DCC WT ( Figure 1D , E ) , indicating that the WIRS motif is important for the interaction between DCC and the WRC . We further validated the effect of DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H in disrupting WRC binding by using pull - down assays and purified recombinant proteins . Compared to GST - DCC WT - cyto , the pull - down signals of GST - DCC ΔWIRS - cyto and GST - DCC R1343H - cyto by ( MBP ) 2 - WRC are both significantly reduced ( Figure 2F , G ) . This result demonstrates that the direct interaction between DCC and the WRC requires the WIRS motif and that the CMM - associated DCC R1343H mutation disrupts this interaction . The DCC WIRS motif is required for Netrin - 1 - dependent axon outgrowth Given that the DCC R1343H variant has a reduced interaction with the WRC and is present in a CMM individual , we hypothesized that the DCC WIRS motif has an important function in axon guidance . To test this hypothesis , we used rodent spinal cord commissural neurons to determine how Dcc WIRS contributes to Netrin - 1 / Dcc signaling in axon guidance . Spinal commissural neurons express Dcc and rely on Netrin - 1 / Dcc signaling to guide their axons to the ventral midline ( Fazeli et al . , 1997 ; Keino - Masu et al . , 1996 ; Kennedy et al . , 1994 ; Serafini et al . , 1996 ; Serafini et al . , 1994 ) . We first tested whether the biochemical interaction that we observe between DCC and the WRC also occurs between endogenous proteins in commissural neurons by using a Proximity Ligation Assay ( PLA ) . PLA produces immunofluorescence signals when the proteins of interest are in close proximity ( < 40 nm ) , indicating a high likelihood of physical interaction . We performed PLA between Dcc and the Cyfip2 subunit of the WRC , as we have Cyfip2 - specific antibodies suitable for immunofluorescence detection ( Cioni et al . , 2018 ) . Consistent with our biochemical results , we detect PLA signals between Cyfip2 and Dcc in 9 control commissural neurons that were stimulated with BSA ( Fig . 3A ) , indicating a basal level interaction between Cyfip2 and Dcc in the growth cone . Remarkably , stimulating the neurons with Netrin - 1 for 5 or 30 min significantly reduces PLA signals in the growth cone ( Figure 3A , B ) , suggesting that Netrin - 1 stimulation releases the WRC from Dcc . In order to examine how the WIRS mutants , including DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H , impact Netrin - 1 mediated axon growth , we turned to mouse dorsal spinal cord explants . Dorsal spinal cord explants were electroporated with RFP and the DCC variants and cultured next to mock 293T cell aggregates or aggregates expressing Netrin - 1 ( Figure 3D - K ) . We quantified the response to Netrin - 1 by measuring the ratio of axon outgrowth extending from the side of the explant closest to the aggregate ( proximal side ) versus the far side ( distal side ) . To ensure that each of these HA - tagged DCC variants are expressed at similar levels , we quantified the HA expression in dissociated spinal commissural neuron cultures prepared from electroporated spinal cords . Immunostaining for HA showed comparable levels of each DCC variant in dissociated neurons ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Co - expression of RFP was used as a measure of electroporation efficiency due to poor penetration of the anti - HA antibody in collagen - embedded explants ( Figure S2C ) . Explants cultured next to mock cell aggregates that did not express Netrin - 1 showed little to no growth that was uniform on both sides of the explant ( Figure 3D - G ) . Explants electroporated with RFP alone and cultured next to Netrin - 1 - expressing aggregates showed slightly more growth on the proximal side compared to the distal side , resulting in a small , but non - significant increase in the proximal / distal outgrowth ratio ( Figure 3H , L ) . By contrast and as predicted , explants electroporated with DCC WT show an enhanced Netrin - 1 response with significantly more growth on the proximal side and a higher proximal / distal outgrowth ratio 10 ( Figure 3I , L ) . In contrast to DCC WT , explants electroporated with DCC ΔWIRS do not show a clear response to Netrin - 1 , and the proximal / distal outgrowth ratio is similar to the ratio observed for RFP - electroporated control explants ( Figures 3J , L ) . This indicates that DCC ΔWIRS is unable to induce axon growth in response to Netrin - 1 . Similarly , explants electroporated with DCC R1343H also fail to show an enhanced Netrin - 1 response and have a proximal / distal outgrowth ratio comparable to the control ( Figures 3K , L ) . Thus , mutations in the DCC WIRS lead to a loss of DCC - mediated axon outgrowth in response to Netrin - 1 . The DCC WIRS motif is required for Netrin - 1 mediated axon guidance Having established that the DCC WIRS motif is important for Netrin - 1 / DCC mediated axon outgrowth , we next tested whether the DCC WIRS motif is also required for Netrin - 1 mediated commissural axon guidance in vitro by using a DCC knock - down / re - expression strategy . By using siRNA against rat Dcc , we were able to reduce endogenously expressed Dcc by ~ 50 % in dissociated rat commissural neurons ( Figure S3A - B ) . To assess Netrin - 1 - mediated axon guidance , we used an in vitro axon turning assay in which cultured rat commissural neurons are exposed to a Netrin - 1 gradient in a Dunn chamber . The turning of the axons towards the Netrin - 1 gradient is then imaged and the angle turned is defined as the angle between the initial and final orientation of the axon , with positive turning angles representing attraction towards the gradient ( Yam et al . , 2009 ) . When commissural neurons electroporated with control scrambled siRNA are exposed to a Netrin - 1 gradient , their axons are attracted towards the higher concentration of Netrin - 1 and the angle turned shows a significant bias towards positive angles . In contrast , Dcc knockdown inhibits the ability of axons to turn towards the Netrin - 1 gradient ; no net turning occurred , and the turning angle varied around 0 ( Figure 4A - C ) . 11 We next sought to rescue the effect of Dcc knockdown on Netrin - 1 - mediated attraction by expressing a human DCC ( DCC WT ) , which is not targeted by the rat Dcc siRNA . Expression of DCC WT , but not the empty vector control , in Dcc knock - down neurons completely rescues Netrin - 1 - mediated axon attraction , with the axons turning equally well toward Netrin - 1 compared to control axons electroporated with scrambled siRNA / empty vector ( Figure 4A - C ) . This demonstrates that the effect of Dcc knockdown on inhibiting Netrin - 1 - mediated axon turning is not due to off - target effects of the siRNA and that expression of DCC WT is sufficient to mediate axon turning to Netrin - 1 . In contrast , expression of the DCC WIRS mutants , DCC ΔWIRS or DCC R1343H , does not rescue Netrin - 1 - mediated attraction in Dcc knock - down neurons and these axons fail to turn towards the Netrin - 1 gradient ( Figure 4A - C ) . These results indicate that mutating the WIRS motif is sufficient to disrupt Netrin - 1 - mediated attraction and that DCC R1343H is a loss - of - function variant . Importantly , there is no significant difference in the speed of axon growth under these conditions ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that the lack of turning in Dcc knock - down or DCC ΔWIRS or DCC R1343H expressing neurons is not due to a reduction in axon growth . Together , our data demonstrate that the DCC WIRS motif is required for Netrin - 1 - mediated axon attraction . Fra directly interacts with the WRC via the WIRS motif in the cytoplasmic domain The WIRS motif in the cytoplasmic domain DCC is conserved in its Drosophila ortholog , Fra ( Figure 1A ) . To determine whether the interaction we observe between human DCC and the WRC is conserved , we tested the binding between Fra and the Drosophila WRC . We first performed a series of co - IP experiments using cultured insect cells and Drosophila embryonic lysates . By expressing tagged constructs of Fra and the HSPC300 subunit of the WRC in 12 Drosophila S2R + cells , we found Fra co - immunoprecipitated with HSPC300 , indicating that Fra indeed interacts with the WRC in Drosophila cells ( Figure 5A ) . Deleting the P2 domain ( Fra ΔP2 ) , which contains the WIRS motif , or mutating the central two amino acids of the WIRS motif ( Fra ΔWIRS ) , significantly reduces binding ( Figure 5A , B ) . This highlights the importance of the WIRS motif for the interaction between Fra and the WRC . To further test whether Fra and the WRC also interact in vivo , we performed co - IP experiments from Drosophila embryonic lysates . We used the pan - neuronal elav - Gal4 driver to direct neuron - specific expression of GFP - tagged HSPC300 and Myc - tagged Fra . Like the results from cultured S2R + cells , Fra WT immunoprecipitates with HSPC300 in embryonic lysates ( Figure 5C ) , while both Fra ΔWIRS and Fra ΔP2 show a significant reduction in binding to the WRC ( Figure 5C , D ) . Collectively , our results indicate that Fra indeed interacts with the Drosophila WRC in a WIRS - dependent manner . We next used pull - down assays with purified recombinant proteins to test if the Fra - WRC interaction is direct and whether it depends on the WIRS motif . GST - tagged Fra WT - cyto , but not GST - Fra ΔWIRS - cyto robustly bind to ( MBP ) 2 - tagged WRCs from both human and Drosophila ( Figure 5E lane 1 , 7 ; 5F lane 4 , 5 ) . Mutating the WIRS - binding pocket on the WRC ( WRC AW ) abolishes the binding ( Figure 5E , lane 5 ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Consistently , addition of a synthesized WIRS peptide derived from human protocadherin - 10 ( PCDH10 ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , but not a mutant WIRS peptide , effectively blocks the binding ( Figure 5F , lane 6 , 7 ) . Together , these results confirm that , like DCC ( Figure 2 F , G ) , the cytoplasmic domain of Fra WT directly interacts with the WRC through the conserved WIRS motif . Therefore , it is likely the DCC / Fra WIRS - WRC interaction has a conserved function in different animal . 13 The Fra WIRS motif is required for commissural axon guidance at the Drosophila midline Our in vitro data showing the requirement of the DCC WIRS motif for Netrin - 1 mediated commissural axon guidance strongly supports an important role of the WIRS motif and the WRC in Netrin - 1 / DCC - dependent axon outgrowth and turning . To evaluate the significance of the DCC / Fra WIRS motif and the WRC in commissural axon guidance in vivo , we decided to use the developing nerve cord in Drosophila as a model system . This system is ideal to assess functional axon guidance requirements of the WRC since , unlike mammalian systems , the Drosophila genome encodes only a single gene for each of the five components of the WRC . In addition , WRC members are enriched in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord during embryonic stages when midline crossing occurs ( Chaudhari et al . , 2021 ; Schenck et al . , 2004 ) . To evaluate the importance of the Fra WIRS motif in vivo , we assessed the ability of Fra ΔWIRS to rescue the axon crossing defects present in the eagle neurons of fra mutants . Eagle neurons are a subset of commissural neurons and consist of an EG population , which projects into the anterior commissure of each segment , and an EW population , which projects into the posterior commissure ( Figure 6H ) . In fra mutants , 56 % of EW axons fail to cross the midline ( Figure 6A , G ) , and horse radish peroxidase ( HRP ) immunostaining reveals frequent missing commissures and breaks in longitudinal tracts ( Figure 6B ) . Re - expressing Fra WT specifically in eagle neurons almost completely rescues the EW non - crossing defects , with only 13 % of segments still showing defects ( Figure 6C , G ) . Since this transgene is only expressed in eagle neurons , we still observe fra mutant phenotypes in the axon scaffold with frequent missing and / or thin commissures ( Figures 6D ) . In contrast to Fra WT , re - expression of Fra ΔWIRS fails to rescue the fra mutant phenotype , with 42 % of EW axons still failing to cross ( Figures 6E , G ) . Together , these 14 results show that Fra without a functional WIRS motif is unable to restore attractive signaling and that the WIRS motif is required for Fra attractive signaling at the Drosophila midline in vivo . The WRC genetically interacts with the fra pathway in the Drosophila nerve cord Given that the WIRS motif serves as an interaction site for the WRC , we next investigated whether the WRC functions in the Fra pathway at the Drosophila midline . First , to determine whether the WRC is important for midline crossing , we employed a Fra Δcyto sensitized background in which commissural eagle neurons express a truncated Fra receptor ( Fra Δcyto ) lacking its cytoplasmic domain and which functions as a dominant - negative ( Garbe et al . , 2007 ) . This manipulation results in some axons failing to cross the midline and constitutes a sensitized background in which we can detect positive or negative regulators of midline crossing . Expressing one copy of fra Δcyto in eagle neurons results in 33 % of EW neurons failing to cross the midline ( Figure S4A ) . Cyfip is a member of the WRC and cyfip mutants show no non - crossing defects in eagle neurons ( Figure 6N ) . Indeed , cyfip mutants along with all other WRC mutants still have significant amounts of protein remaining due to maternal deposition ( Schenck et al . , 2004 ; Zallen et al . , 2002 ) , which is likely why they show no defects on their own . However , removing one copy of cyfip in this Fra Δcyto background significantly enhances EW non - crossing defects to 49 % ( Figures S4B , E ) . Scar and HSPC300 are two other subunits of the WRC . and removing one copy of scar results in a similar enhancement of EW non - crossing defects to 46 % , while removing one copy of hspc300 has no effect ( Figures S4C , D ) . Taken together , these results suggest a role for the WRC in promoting midline crossing . To further assess whether the WRC functions in the Fra pathway to regulate midline crossing , we examined genetic interactions between cyfip and fra using a fra hypomorphic 15 background . While fra 4 is an amorphic allele , fra 6 is a hypomorphic allele ( Kolodziej et al . , 1996 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) , and fra 4 / fra 6 hypomorphic fra mutants show a relatively mild non - crossing phenotype in which EW axons fail to cross in 18 % of nerve cord segments ( Figure 6J , N ) . HRP immunostaining labeled all CNS axons and shows infrequent breaks in longitudinal tracts and thinning of commissures in these mutants ( Figure 6J , K ) . While cyfip mutants on their own had no non - crossing defects , removal of cyfip in these fra hypomorphic mutants results in a striking enhancement of the non - crossing defects with EW axons failing to cross in almost 80 % of segments ( Figures 6L , N ) . HRP immunostaining also reveals a more severe phenotype with frequent missing commissures and longitudinal breaks in the axon scaffold ( Figure 6M ) . While this strong genetic interaction does not exclude the possibility that the WRC functions in additional pathways that promote midline crossing , it strongly suggests that the WRC functions in the Fra pathway to mediate attraction at the Drosophila midline . DCC R1343H and DCC ΔWIRS fail to promote midline crossing in vivo The interaction we identified between DCC and the WRC ( Figure 1 , 2 ) is conserved in Drosophila ( Figure 5 ) . DCC with mutations in the WIRS , DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H , fail to rescue axon turning to Netrin - 1 when Dcc is knocked down ( Figure 4 ) , indicating that the DCC - WRC interaction is required for Netrin - 1 mediated axon guidance in vitro . The WIRS motif is also required for Fra attractive signaling at the Drosophila midline in vivo ( Figure 6 ) . Therefore , the requirement of the DCC - WRC interaction in axon guidance appears to be conserved across species . Consequently , we predicted that DCC R1343H would impair commissural axon guidance in vivo and that this impaired commissural axon guidance may contribute to the pathogenic mechanism underlying mirror movements . 16 To determine whether DCC R1343H has altered functions in vivo , we tested its activity in a gain - of - function assay in Drosophila . We first established this assay with Fra . In wild type embryos , the apterous ( ap ) population of ipsilateral axons never cross the midline ( Figure 7A ) . Overexpression of Fra WT in ap axons results in a strong gain - of - function phenotype where 68 % of ap axons ectopically cross the midline ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , overexpression of either Fra ΔP2 or Fra ΔWIRS results in a significantly weaker gain - of - function phenotype with ~ 48 % of ap axons ectopically crossing the midline ( Figure 7C - E ) . The observation that many axons still cross the midline when FraΔP2 and Fra ΔWIRS are overexpressed is likely due to the high level of expression resulting from the 10xUAS transgenes which can mask dysfunction in receptor activity ( Chaudhari et al . , 2021 ) . The reduction in the gain - of - function phenotype observed with Fra ΔP2 and Fra ΔWIRS is not due to differences in expression levels of Fra WT , Fra ΔP2 , Fra ΔWIRS , since immunostaining for Myc shows comparable levels of expression of all three transgenes ( Figures S5A , B ) . Thus , our gain - of - function assay with Fra variants demonstrates that disrupting the WIRS motif affects Fra’s ability to induce ectopic attraction , consistent with the WIRS motif being required for Fra attractive signaling at the Drosophila midline . Next , we examined the consequence of the DCC WIRS mutations in vivo by expressing the DCC variants in the Drosophila nerve cord and examining their ability to induce ectopic attraction toward the midline . Importantly , we have previously shown that DCC can signal in response to Drosophila Netrin - 1 and induce ectopic crossing at the midline when introduced into the ap population of ipsilateral axons ( O ' Donnell and Bashaw , 2013b ) . Indeed , overexpressing DCC in these axons results in a strong gain - of - function phenotype where over 80 % of ap axons ectopically cross the midline ( Figure 7F ) . In contrast , overexpressing DCC ΔWIRS or DCC R1343H ( Figure 7G , H ) results in significantly weaker gain - of - function phenotypes , with approximately 17 62 % of ap axons ectopically crossing the midline ( Figures 7I ) . All transgenes are tagged with Myc and immunostaining shows comparable levels of expression of all transgenes ( Figures S5C , D ) , indicating that the reduction in the gain - of - function phenotype is not due to differences in expression levels of DCC WT , DCC ΔWIRS and DCC R1343H . These results show that mutations in the DCC WIRS impairs DCC’s ability to induce ectopic attraction in vivo . This is consistent with our demonstration that DCC R1343H cannot rescue commissural axon attraction to Netrin - 1 when Dcc is knocked down , indicating that DCC R1343H is a loss - of - function mutation . Our finding that disrupting the WIRS motif ( DCC ΔWIRS ) has a similar effect to DCC R1343H supports the conclusion that DCC R1343H is likely pathogenic by disrupting the WIRS motif’s interaction with the WRC . DISCUSSION In this manuscript , we have discovered an essential role for the WIRS - WRC interaction in Netrin - 1 mediated DCC / Fra signaling . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that the interaction between DCC / Fra and the WRC is WIRS - dependent . Biochemical experiments with purified DCC / Fra cytoplasmic domains and the WRC show that the interaction between DCC / Fra and the WRC is direct , WIRS - dependent , and evolutionarily conserved . In vitro , we find that mutating the DCC WIRS disrupts its ability to induce Netrin - 1 dependent axon growth and that the WIRS motif of DCC is required for Netrin - 1 - mediated attraction of axons in rodent commissural neurons . In vivo , we used genetic interaction experiments in Drosophila to show that the WRC acts in the Fra pathway to promote midline crossing . We find that the Fra WIRS motif is required for commissural axon guidance at the Drosophila midline , consistent with our results in rodents showing that the DCC WIRS is required for Netrin - 1 - mediated axon guidance . The functional significance of the DCC - WRC interaction is underscored by the presence of a 18 mutation in the WIRS motif , DCC R1343H , found in a CMM individual . DCC R1343H has reduced binding to the WRC and fails to rescue axon attraction to Netrin - 1 , demonstrating that DCC R1343H is a loss - of - function mutation . Moreover , compared to DCC WT , DCC R1343H has a reduced ability to promote midline crossing in the Drosophila nerve cord in vivo . Taken together these observations support the idea that DCC R1343H causes CMM by disrupting Netrin - 1 / DCC signaling and axon guidance . Regulation of the WIRS - WRC interaction The WRC serves as a nucleation - promoting factor that binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulates its actin - nucleating activity , resulting in the subsequent generation of branched actin filaments . WRC activation downstream of stimulated DCC may initiate localized actin remodeling to polarize the growth cone and steer axons toward the midline . Indeed , Rac1 , an important activator of the WRC ( Chen et al . , 2017 ; Ding et al . , 2022 ) , has previously been implicated downstream of DCC and could potentially serve to activate the WRC at DCC - WRC interaction sites ( Briançon - Marjollet et al . , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) . Previously , we identified a ligand - dependent recruitment of the WRC to the WIRS motif in the repulsive guidance receptor , Roundabout ( Robo ) ( Chaudhari et al . , 2021 ) . Addition of slit , the ligand for Robo , increased the interaction between the WRC and Robo in a WIRS - dependent manner . In contrast , we found that Netrin - 1 addition caused a dissociation of the WRC from Dcc in growth cones of commissural neurons . This difference in WRC response to ligand might be due to a difference in how the WRC acts in attractive versus repulsive guidance signaling . Given our data demonstrating a positive role for the WRC in Fra / DCC signaling , we speculate that DCC might act as a scaffold , bringing active Rac1 and the WRC in close proximity in order to 19 locally concentrate active WRC . Subsequent release of active WRC upon Netrin - 1 binding could enable retention of the complex at the growth cone membrane where enhanced actin polymerization is important for driving growth cone advancement and turning . Indeed , DCC is rapidly endocytosed from the plasma membrane following Netrin - 1 stimulation ( Konopacki et al . , 2016 ; Pert et al . , 2015 ; Piper et al . , 2005 ) , and release of the WRC from DCC prior to DCC endocytosis could enable tighter spatiotemporal control over the ensuing actin polymerization and promote actin nucleation specifically at the leading edge of the growth cone . WRC is a common downstream effector of DCC and Robo The WIRS motif is present in several axon guidance receptors , including the repulsive guidance receptor , Robo , and our lab recently identified the WRC as an important downstream effector of Robo signaling ( Chaudhari et al . , 2021 ) . An important question is how the WRC functions downstream of DCC and Robo to achieve distinct and opposing outputs . One possibility might be the spatial segregation of WRC activation . At the membrane , enhanced actin polymerization can propel the growth cone forward , resulting in axon growth toward an attractive cue . On the other hand , recent reports have shed light on the inhibitory effect of actin polymerization on growth , whereby accumulation of actin in the inner central region of the growth cone obstructs microtubules and prevents them from extending out into the periphery to induce axon growth ( Stern et al . , 2021 ) . It is tempting to hypothesize that downstream of DCC , the WRC is activated and concentrated at the plasma membrane to induce the formation of branched actin filaments to propel the growth cone forward . In contrast , WRC activation downstream of Robo may occur deeper within the growth cone , where the resulting increase in actin filaments serves as a barrier to microtubules and restricts axon growth . Robo is 20 endocytosed in response to slit ( Chance and Bashaw , 2015 ) , and its downstream activation of Rac1 requires Robo endocytosis . As Rac is a critical activator of the WRC , it is likely that WRC activation and concentration also occurs on endosomes that may be positioned in deeper regions of the growth cone . Consistent with this idea , super - resolution imaging of Robo1 distribution in commissural axon growth cones has shown that Robo1 tends to accumulate more centrally in the growth cone and is detected at lower levels at the leading edge ( Pignata et al . , 2019 ) . Alternatively , WRC activation and the resulting actin polymerization may occur at the plasma membrane downstream of all axon guidance receptors and might represent a generalized mechanism for initial gradient sensing upon guidance cue detection . In support of this , dorsal root ganglion neurons initially extend filopodia toward a source of slit before retracting ( McConnell et al . , 2016 ) . This study highlights the nuanced and complex actin polymerization events that occur downstream of guidance cues , which potentially contribute to sensing the environment for improved resolution of a guidance gradient . WIRS - independent interaction between DCC and the WRC Our interaction data using purified proteins together with the co - immunoprecipitation assays show that the interaction between Fra and the WRC is primarily through its WIRS motif . However , the interaction between DCC and the WRC is not completely abolished when either the WIRS motif or the WIRS - binding site in the WRC is mutated . This suggests that DCC may have a second sequence that can interact with the WRC in a WIRS - independent manner . Several other neuronal proteins , including HPO - 30 , Retrolinkin , and cannabinoid receptor CB1 , were found to interact with the WRC without using a WIRS motif ( Kramer et al . , 2022a ; Njoo et al . , 2015 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ; Zou et al . , 2018 ) . However , DCC shares little sequence similarity with 21 these non - WIRS WRC - interacting proteins , suggesting that the second binding sequence on DCC may be distinct . Whether this additional binding site in DCC reflects redundancy in WRC binding or serves to locally enrich WRC to potentiate their activity toward the Arp2 / 3 complex via cooperative activation ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) remains to be investigated . Nevertheless , since mutation of the DCC WIRS completely abolishes the ability of DCC to rescue axon attraction to Netrin - 1 when Dcc is knocked down , simple redundancy is unlikely . Although we cannot exclude the possibility that mutating the WIRS motif might have WRC - independent effects , our biochemical , functional , and genetic experiments strongly converge on an essential role for the WRC downstream of DCC . WRC in other DCC / Fra signaling contexts Given our data demonstrating the importance of the WIRS motif in DCC / Fra signaling in axon guidance , the DCC / Fra WIRS motif may also be important in other DCC / Fra - dependent processes . In addition to their roles in axon guidance , DCC and Fra have numerous functions in development and disease outside of the nervous system . DCC was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene and can promote cell death . DCC can act as a dependence receptor to promote apoptosis in the absence of Netrin - 1 in several tissues , including colon carcinoma cells and neuroblastomas ( Chen et al . , 1999 ; Forcet et al . , 2001 ; Mehlen et al . , 1998 ) . Fra plays a role in the formation of midgut epithelium in Drosophila as well as in heart and lung morphogenesis ( Macabenta et al . , 2013 ; Pert et al . , 2015 ) . Most recently , our lab identified a role for Fra in the Drosophila ovary where it acts to promote germ - line survival through the inhibition of apoptosis ( Russell et al . , 2021 ) . Fra also acts in epithelial cells to maintain adherens junctions ( AJs ) and can regulate the localization of AJ proteins ( Golenkina et al . , 2018 ; Manhire - Heath et al . , 2013 ) . 22 The latter function was found to require all three P motifs of Fra ( Golenkina et al . , 2018 ) . This is especially interesting given that neogenin was recently found to regulate AJ integrity and stability via its interaction with the WRC through its canonical WIRS motif ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) . This might suggest a shared downstream mechanism by which axon guidance receptors regulate AJs via their WIRS - WRC interactions . Given their extensive involvement in development and disease contexts , a complete dissection of the DCC / Fra signaling pathway is an important area for future investigation .

V - Fc . Cells were the cultured in OptiMEM without serum . Conditioned media was collected two days after transfection and the amount of Netrin present in the conditioned media was evaluated by western blot . Netrin cell surface binding assay The Netrin cell surface binding assay was adapted from adapted from ( Keino - Masu et al . , 1996 ) . Cos7 cells were cultured on glass coverslips coated with PLL ( 100 μg / ml for 2 h ) and transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher ) with pcDNA3 . 1 - DCC WT - HA , pcDNA3 . 1 - DCC R1343H , or pCAGs - DCC D WIRS . After two days , the cells were incubated with 2 µ g / ml control ( pSecTagB - Fc ) or Netrin VI . V - Fc ( pCep4 - Netrin VIV - Fc ) conditioned media in binding buffer ( PBS with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + supplemented with 10 % horse serum , 0 . 1 % sodium azide and 2 µ g / ml heparin ) at room temperature for 90 min . After gently washing two times with binding buffer and two times with PBS , the cells were fixed with methanol at - 20 °C for 12 min and immunostained using standard protocols . The following antibodies were used : anti - DCC ( BD , 554223 , 1 : 500 ) , anti - HA ( Cell Signaling ( NEB ) 3724S , clone C29F4 , 1 : 1000 ) , donkey anti - mouse IgG - DyLight 647 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , 715 - 605 - 151 , 1 : 1000 ) , donkey anti - rabbit IgG - 488 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , 711 - 545 - 152 , 1 : 1000 ) and donkey anti - human Fc IgG - Cy3 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , 709 - 165 - 149 , 1 : 2000 ) . Images of fluorescence immunostaining were obtained with a Leica DM6 microscope with a 63X objective . For quantification , the Fc fluorescence signal ( after subtraction of the background fluorescence signal ) was normalized according to DCC or HA expression levels ( after subtraction of the background fluorescence signal ) . 34 Proximity Ligation Assay Dissociated commissural neurons were stimulated with 0 . 1 µg / ml BSA or Netrin - 1 ( R & D Systems , # 1109 - N1 - 025 ) for 5 or 30 min and fixed with 4 % PFA in PBS . The samples were then blocked with 10 % BSA ( IgG free ) and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS pH 7 . 4 for 1 hour at room temperature , and then incubated with antibodies against Dcc ( R & D Systems AF844 ) and Cyfip2 ( Abcam # 79716 ) , diluted in PBS with 1 % BSA ( IgG free ) and 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , overnight at 4°C . The proximity ligation reaction was performed with the Duolink In situ PLA kit ( Sigma ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Electroporation of Mouse Embryos Electroporations and dissections of mouse embryos were performed as described previously ( Chaudhari et al . , 2021 ) . Briefly , E12 mouse embryos were electroporated ex utero by injecting 500 ng / μl DNA in electroporation buffer ( 30mM HEPES pH7 . 5 ( Thermo , # BP299 - 1 ) , 300 mM KCl ( Thermo , # BP366 - 1 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 ( Thermo , # BP214 - 500 ) and 0 . 1 % Fast Green FCF ( Thermo , # F99 - 10 ) ) into the central canal of the neural tube . A BTX ECM 830 electroporator ( BTX Harvard Apparatus , # 45 - 0662 ) was used for bilateral electroporation into spinal cord neurons ( Five 30 V pulses , each of 50 ms duration for each half of the spinal cord ) . Following electroporation , dorsal spinal cords were dissected out and cut into explants for the explant outgrowth assay or used for preparation of dissociated neuronal cultures . Electroporation of Dissociated Commissural Neurons 35 Dissociated rat commissural neurons were electroporated with the Amaxa 96 - well Shuttle using the P3 Primary Cell 96 - well Nucleofector Kit ( Lonza , Switzerland ) . For each electroporation in one well ( 20 µl ) of a 96 - well Nucleofector Plate , 5 - 6 x 10 6 commissural neurons were electroporated with 0 . 25 μg plasmid DNA and / or 1 mM siRNA . The electroporation was performed with the program 96 - CP - 100 according to the manufacturer’s instructions . siRNA Generation and Validation The siRNA for knockdown of rat Dcc was a predesigned siRNA from IDT whose Design ID is rn . Ri . Dcc . 13 . 1 . siRNA oligonucleotides were annealed by incubation at 94°C for 2 mins and cooling down at room temperature , then aliquoted and stored at - 20°C . The efficiency and specificity of the siRNA was evaluated in vitro in commissural neurons ( Figure S3 ) . Scrambled siRNA 5’ - rUrCrArCrArArGrGrGrArGrArGrArArArGrArGrArGrGrArArGrGrA - 3’ 5’ - rCrUrUrCrCrUrCrUrCrUrUrUrCrUrCrUrCrCrCrUrUrGrUGA - 3’ Dcc siRNA 5’ - rGrGrArArUrCrArArArGrCrArArArGrArUrGrGrUrCrArUGA - 3’ 5’ - rUrCrArUrGrArCrCrArUrCrUrUrUrGrCrUrUrUrGrArUrUrCrCrUrG - 3’ Explant Outgrowth Assay Dorsal spinal cord explants from E12 mouse embryos were dissected and cultured in collagen gels as previously described ( Serafini et al . , 1994 ) . Briefly , explants were embedded in rat tail collagen ( Corning , # 354249 ) gels at a distance of one explant diameter away from a mock 293T cell aggregate ( ATCC , CRL - 3216 ) or a cell aggregate expressing netrin ( pG - netrin - Myc ) . Explants were grown in 50 % OptiMEM and 45 % Ham’s F - 12 media supplemented with 5 % horse - serum , 0 . 75 % glucose and 1X penicillin / streptomycin / glutamine for 24 h . Explants were subsequently fixed and stained as described above . 36 Dunn Chamber Assay and Analysis To quantify the axon turning of dissociated commissural neurons in response to gradients , we performed the Dunn chamber axon guidance assay as described previously ( Yam et al . , 2009 ) . Electroporated commissural neurons were grown on PLL - coated square # 3D coverslips as described above . The coverslips were then assembled into Dunn chambers . Gradients were generated in the Dunn chamber with 200 ng / ml Netrin - 1 ( R & D Systems , # 1109 - N1 - 025 ) in the outer well . After Dunn chamber assembly , timelapse phase contrast images were acquired for 2 h at 37 °C with a 10X or 20X fluotar objective on a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope ( Leica , Germany ) equipped with a MS - 2000 XYZ automated stage ( ASI , Eugene , OR ) . Images were acquired with an Orca ER CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) using Volocity ( Improvision , Waltham , MA ) . The angle turned was defined as the angle between the original direction of the axon and a straight line connecting the base of the growth cone from the first to the last time point of the assay period . Quantification and Statistical Analysis For analysis of Drosophila nerve cord phenotypes , image analysis was conducted blind to the genotype . Data are presented as mean values ± S . E . M . For statistical analysis , comparisons were made between two groups using the Student’s t - test . For multiple comparisons , significance was assessed using one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests . Differences were considered significant when p < 0 . 05 . To measure Myc signal intensity for DCC quantification in dissociated neurons , Myc - positive neurons were carefully traced in ImageJ and integrated signal density in the traced region was obtained . Background signals were subtracted and mean 37 fluorescence intensity calculated as integrated signal density per area are presented in graphs . Data are presented as mean values ± S . E . M . For statistical analysis , comparisons were made using one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests . Differences were considered significant when p < 0 . 05 . For the explant outgrowth assay , explants images were converted to black - and - white composites using the auto - threshold ( Li ) function . Explant quadrants were delineated by placing a right - angled crosshair at the center of each explant with the proximal quadrant directly facing the cell aggregate . The total area of black pixels was measured for the proximal and distal quadrants using the Analyze Particles function . The particles showing axonal outgrowth were then erased using the Eraser tool and the total area of black particles was measured again . The difference was recorded as total area of axonal outgrowth . Next , the length of each quadrant was measured by tracing the border of the quadrant using the Freehand Line tool . Values for total area of outgrowth were normalized to length of the quadrant and these final values were used to obtain the proximal / distal ratios for each explant . The measurements for each explant in a set were averaged and the ratios of experimental conditions compared with control condition were calculated . Data are presented as mean ± SEM . For statistical analysis , comparisons were made between groups using one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests . Differences were considered significant when p < 0 . 05 . For western blots , densitometric analysis was performed and band intensities of co - immunoprecipitating proteins in the immunoprecipitates were normalized to band intensities of HSPC300 in the immunoprecipitates as well as to lysate levels of the co - immunoprecipitating proteins . For each independent experiment , values were normalized to wild type Fra . Data are presented as mean ± SEM . For statistical analysis , significance was assessed using one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc tests . Differences were 38 considered significant when p < 0 . 05 . For all graphs , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * * * p < 0 . 0001 . All statistics and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 . 39 References Boyer , N .

( A - F and H - M ) Stage 16 Drosophila embryos carrying egGal4 and UAS - TauMycGFP transgenes stained with anti - GFP ( grey ) which labels cell bodies and axons of the eagle neurons or anti - HRP ( cyan ) which labels all CNS axons . ( A ) fra 3 null mutants show strong non - crossing defects with EW axons failing to cross in over 50 % of nerve cord segments . ( B ) The axon scaffold in fra 3 null mutants shows frequent missing and / or thin commissures . ( C ) Eagle - specific expression of wild type 5xUAS - Fra WT almost completely rescues the EW non - crossing phenotype in fra 3 mutants while ( E ) expression of 5xUAS - Fra ΔWIRS fails to rescue with over 40 % of segments still showing EW non - crossing defects . ( D and F ) Given the eagle - specific expression of the UAS - Fra transgenes , the axon scaffolds continue to show frequent missing and / or thin commissures . ( H ) The commissural eagle neurons consist of the EG population which projects into the anterior commissure of each segment and the EW population which projects into the posterior commissure . Both EG and EW neurons cross in 100 % of segments in wild type embryos . ( I ) HRP staining shows a wild type arrangement of the axon scaffold . ( J ) fra 4 / fra 6 hypomorphic mutants show mild non - crossing defects with EW axons failing to cross in around 20 % of nerve cord segments ( asterisks ) . ( K ) Some segments of the axon scaffold show missing or thin commissures in these fra 4 / fra 6 hypomorphic mutants . ( L ) Further removal of both copies of cyfip in these hypomorphic fra mutants shows a striking enhancement of the EW non - crossing phenotype with EW axons failing to cross in almost 80 % of segments .

( B ) Misexpression of Myc - tagged Fra WT in ap neurons results in a strong gain - of - function phenotype with ap axons ectopically crossing the midline in 67 % of nerve cord segments ( yellow arrows ) . However , misexpressing Myc - tagged Fra ΔP2 ( C ) or Fra ΔWIRS ( D ) results in a milder phenotype with significantly fewer segments showing ectopic ap crossing ( around 48 % ) . ( F ) Misexpressing Myc - tagged DCC WT in ap neurons results in a very strong gain - of - function phenotype with ap axons ectopically crossing the midline in over 80 % of segments . However , misexpression of both Myc - tagged DCC ΔWIRS ( G ) or DCC R1343H ( H ) results in a significantly milder phenotype with ap axons ectopically crossing in around 60 % of nerve cord segments .
