These 50 – 1 , 500 base pair ( bp ) cis - regulatory elements stimulate transcription from core promoters in a time - and tissue - specific manner by recruit - ing context - dependent transcriptional activators and repressors 4 – 6 . Whole - genome methods have shown that the human genome is rid - dled with enhancers , with estimates ranging from 200 , 000 to over a million 7 . Importantly , a significant fraction of enhancers are located at large genomic distances from the promoters they regulate 8 – 10 . Even for a compact genome such as Drosophila melanogaster , at least 30 % of enhancer – promoter interactions occur over 20 kb , and in many cases over intervening genes 11 – 13 . Despite extensive studies over more than three decades , many questions still remain as to how enhancers communicate with their target promoters over large genomic distances 14 . Static measure - ments , employing , for example , fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) and chromosome conformation capture based genomic experiments , provided evidence supporting physical interactions between a distal enhancer and a target promoter 15 – 19 . Yet we still lack a dynamic characterization that could distinguish transient contact from the formation of stable topological structures and disentangle cause from consequence in the relationship between such topological structures and transcription . To address these fun - damental questions , we have developed a live imaging approach to track the spatial positions of an enhancer and its target promoter and to simultaneously monitor transcriptional activity in develop - ing fly embryos . By employing this approach , we characterize , at the single - cell level , a dynamic interplay between enhancer – promoter topology and transcriptional activity . Results Live imaging of chromatin topology and transcription . To exam - ine long - range transcriptional activation , we placed a reporter gene 142 kb from the well - studied Drosophila even - skipped ( eve ) locus , which contains a set of five enhancers that drive a seven - striped expression pattern in the cellular blastoderm ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . While this chosen distance is generally larger than that observed for enhancer – promoter interactions in the early fly embryo , it is comparable to and even smaller than the distances over which many enhancers function in higher eukaryotes 8 – 10 , 20 . Notably , at such distance the chromatin fiber can display fast ran - dom movements , which creates an entropic hurdle for specific long - range chromatin interactions and thus a kinetic barrier for the establishment of a productive pre - initiation complex . We there - fore included in our reporter cassette the 368 bp insulator element homie ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) 21 , 22 , which facilitates the formation of a stable loop by self - pairing with the endogenous homie element 23 located at the 3’ end of the eve locus 21 , 22 . In fixed embryos containing our reporter cassette , we observe sporadic expression ( ~ 15 % ) of the reporter gene , solely within the limits of the endogenous eve stripes ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , which suggests that the reporter is specifi - cally activated by the eve enhancers 142 kb away 21 . To simultaneously visualize the location of the endogenous eve enhancers , the location of the promoter of the reporter , and its tran - scriptional activity in living embryos , we designed a three - color imaging system . First , we used two orthogonal stem - loop - based labeling cassettes 24 – 26 ; MS2 stem loops were introduced via CRISPR genome editing to the endogenous eve gene , and PP7 stem loops were added to the reporter gene ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig . 2a , b , Supplementary Video 1 ) . Maternally expressed fluorescent coat pro - teins bind the corresponding nascent stem - loops on transcription , providing a dynamic readout of gene activity ( Fig . 1a ) . Owing to the strong transcriptional activity of the eve gene , the corresponding fluorescent focus further serves as a marker for the nuclear posi - tion of the eve enhancers , which are located within 10 kb of the eve promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . In addition , we took advantage of a recently developed DNA labeling system 27 , 28 to mark the posi - tion of the reporter gene in a manner that is independent of its Dynamic interplay between enhancer – promoter topology and gene activity Hongtao Chen 1 , Michal Levo 1 , Lev Barinov 2 , Miki Fujioka 3 , James B . Jaynes ! ! 3 and Thomas Gregor ! ! 1 , 4 , 5 * A long - standing question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers communicate with their target promoters , and specifically how chromatin topology dynamically relates to gene activation . Here , we combine genome editing and multi - color live imag - ing to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer – promoter interaction and transcription at the single - cell level in Drosophila embryos . By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even - skipped enhancers , which are located 150 ! kb away , we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics . We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation . Transcription in turn affects the three - dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction . Furthermore , the facilitated long - range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus , causing corresponding developmental defects . Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long - range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates . NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS activity . Namely , Burkholderia parS DNA sequences were included in the reporter gene , nucleating the binding of ParB - GFP fusion proteins ( Fig . 1a ) . Using three - color time - lapse confocal microscopy , we captured stacks of optical sections of the surface of two - hour - old ( nuclear cycle 14 , nc14 ) embryos carrying the tagged eve locus and the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 reporter ( Supplementary Video 2 ) . In these stacks , we can clearly identify individual fluorescent foci in 70 – 100 nuclei simultaneously ( Fig . 1b ) . In the blue channel , we observed the endogenous transcriptional activity of the eve gene in its charac - teristic seven - striped pattern . This pattern is quantitatively identi - cal to that observed from the endogenous eve gene ( Supplementary Fig . 2c – g , Supplementary Video 1 ) . In the green channel , we observed parB foci in all nuclei of the developing embryo , tracking the posi - tion and the movement of the reporter locus ( Fig . 1b ) . Finally , in the red channel , we observed the reporter’s transcriptional activity in a subset of nuclei within the ( blue ) eve stripes ( Fig . 1b ) , consistent with our results from fixed embryos ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . These three florescent foci thus provide the means to measure the physical distance between the enhancers and the reporter , as well as to monitor the reporter’s transcriptional activity . To ascer - tain our ability to accurately measure these properties , several control experiments were performed . To estimate the precision of our distance measurements , we generated a synthetic construct ( localization control ) in which all three fluorescent proteins are co - localized within a genomic distance of 2 . 0 kb ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . By analyzing embryos carrying this construct , we were able to calibrate chromatic aberrations from the microscope and to estimate measurement errors in spot localization ( 180 ± 6 nm ( mean ± s . e . m . ) , that is , ~ 75 nm in the x / y directions and ~ 150 nm in the axial direction , see Supplementary Fig . 3b – h ) . Our optical resolution measured from diffraction - limited multi - color fluores - cent beads is 20 nm in the x / y directions and 50 nm in the axial direction ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – h ) . Thus , measurement error originating from optics only accounts for ~ 10 % of the variance in our distance measurement . 0 : 00 0 : 30 1 : 00 1 : 30 Red - OFF Red - ON 2 : 00 2 : 30 3 : 00 3 : 30 2 µ m Time ( s ) 50 100 150 200 E nhan c e r – p r o m o t e r d i s t an c e ( µ m ) 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 Red - OFF Red - ON ∆ t ( s ) 0 400 800 1 , 200 3 D M S D ( µ m 2 ) 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 Red - OFF Red - ON λ control d x ( µ m ) 1 0 – 1 – 1 d y ( µ m ) 0 1 0 1 – 1 d z ( µ m ) d x ( µ m ) 1 0 – 1 – 1 d y ( µ m ) 0 1 0 1 – 1 d z ( µ m ) a b c mTagBFP2 NLS NLS mKate2 mKate2 mKate2 mTagBFP2 EGFP PCP MCP ParB nos vas nos mTagBFP2 d e PP7 MS2 parS 100 µ m eve - MS2 10 kb enhancers eve enhancers homie homie parS PP7 MS2 homie Chr2R 142 kb evePr 5 µ m Fig . 1 | Three - color live imaging of enhancer – promoter movement and transcriptional activity . a , Male flies carrying the modified eve locus are crossed with females carrying maternally expressed blue , red and green fluorescent proteins that are fused to MS2 coat protein ( MCP ) , PP7 coat protein ( PCP ) , and ParB DNA binding protein , respectively .

An ectopic homie insulator sequence is also included in the reporter to force loop formation through homie - homie pairing .

Inset shows two representative trajectories for a Red - OFF nucleus ( blue ) and a Red - ON ( red ) nucleus , respectively . NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS We also tested whether our genomic labeling approach intro - duces perturbations in the system ( see experiments and discussion in Supplementary Fig . 4 ) by ( 1 ) removing the maternal ParB supply , ( 2 ) placing the parS sequence at different locations relative to the lacZ reporter , and ( 3 ) employing the more traditional lacO / LacI sys - tem instead 29 , 30 . In no case was the presence of ParB proteins found to affect the activation kinetics of the PP7 reporter ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , we did not observe any significant difference in chromatin dynamics or transcription kinetics when the parS tag was placed at different locations or replaced by the lacO tag ( Supplementary Fig . 4b – g ) . These results are consistent with previ - ous studies , in which the parS / ParB system was found to be non - disruptive to chromatin structure 31 . An initial examination of the nuclei in which the PP7 reporter is inactive ( Red - OFF ) versus those in which it is active ( Red - ON ) points to a close connection between transcription and the physi - cal proximity of the enhancer – promoter pair ( Supplementary Video 3 ) . In Red - OFF nuclei , the reporter is well separated from the eve enhancers , while in Red - ON nuclei , all three fluorescent foci appear to be attached together ( Fig . 1c ) . Specifically , when computing the instantaneous spatial distance between the eve enhancer and the reporter promoter ( that is , the blue to green foci distance , enhancer – promoter distance ) , a significantly shorter dis - tance is observed for the Red - ON compared to the Red - OFF nuclei ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 4a – c ) . Moreover , computing the change in the enhancer – promoter distance across a time interval of variable size gives access to the three - dimensional ( 3D ) mean squared dis - placement ( MSD ) for the enhancer – promoter distance trajectories in the two classes of nuclei ( Fig . 1e , Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . The MSD curve reaches a plateau for both types , indicating spatial con - finement of the enhancer – promoter distance . Expectedly , the size of this confinement ( that is , the spatial limit explored by the enhancer – promoter pair ) in the active ( Red - ON ) nuclei is smaller than that in the inactive ( Red - OFF ) nuclei ( ~ 0 . 25 versus ~ 1 . 0 μ m 2 , Fig . 1e ) . Necessity of sustained physical proximity for transcription . To assess the temporal relationship between enhancer – promoter prox - imity and the processes of transcriptional activation and inactiva - tion , we identified all time traces in which we observed nascent transcription in the PP7 reporter gene switching from OFF to ON ( n = 286 ) and switching from ON to OFF ( n = 203 ) , respectively . When we aligned ~ 20 min time windows of both sets of traces cen - tered around the switching time point , we observed a strong asso - ciation between physical proximity and activity . The OFF - to - ON set ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 5a , b , Supplementary Video 4a – c ) displays a sharp transition in transcrip - tional activity , with rates comparable to those previously reported for active nuclei exiting mitosis 32 . The distance between the eve enhancers and the reporter promoter ( that is , the blue to green foci distance ) converged continuously until this sharp onset of transcription . At this point the enhancer – promoter distance ( root - mean - squared ( r . m . s . ) distance ) corresponds to ~ 340 nm . These findings suggest that enhancer – promoter proximity is required in order to initiate the transgene’s transcriptional activity . Correspondingly , the sharp drop in transcriptional activ - ity observed in the ON - to - OFF set of time traces is accompanied by an increase in the r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distance ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Fig . 5c , d , Supplementary Video 4d – f ) . While poly - merases ( RNA polymerase II , PolII ) already engaged in transcrip - tion will continue to give rise to a detectable red focus even after the separation of the eve enhancers from the promoter ( probably accounting for the largest part of the observed ~ 4 min delay 32 , 33 ) , it seems transcription initiation ceases as soon as the eve enhancers and the reporter promoter physically separate . Overall , these results fit with a model in which sustained enhancer – promoter physical association is necessary for continuous initiation of transcription . Characterization of three topological states . To establish a quan - titative link between physical proximity and transcriptional activity , we constructed the distribution of time - averaged r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distances , across all data acquired . We examined time traces from 7 , 883 nuclei , across 84 individual embryos , taken over a 30 min period in nc14 and calculated the time - averaged r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distances over a sliding window along each trace ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 6a , see Methods ) . We found a bi - modal distribution that can be fitted by a mixture of two Gaussians , one harboring 87 % of all r . m . s . samples with a mean of 709 ± 110 nm ( mean ± s . d . ) and the other , smaller in proportion , with a mean of 353 ± 82 nm . To gain insight into the topological conformation underly - ing these two disparate populations , we employed a variant of our reporter construct in which the homie sequence is replaced by λ DNA of the same length ( parS - λ - evePr - PP7 ) . When we constructed the corresponding r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distance distribu - tion from 1 , 453 nuclei in 15 embryos carrying this construct , we observed a unimodal Gaussian with a mean of 730 ± 112 nm , simi - lar to the large population obtained with the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . This indicates that the Gaussian with the larger mean , common to both constructs , prob - ably represents nuclei in an open , unpaired conformation . In con - trast , the smaller population , with the short enhancer – promoter distances , observed only with the homie - containing construct , probably stems from nuclei in a homie – homie paired conforma - tion , which are evidently missing in the λ replacement construct . Furthermore , consistent with these postulated underlying confor - mations , the mean of the large Gaussian increases ( that is , shifts to larger distances ) when we move the PP7 reporter to a genomic location more distal from the eve locus ( from − 142 to − 589 kb , Supplementary Fig . 6d ) , while the mean of the smaller Gaussian remains unchanged . In addition , the size of the smaller Gaussian is clearly reduced in reporter constructs containing truncated versions of the homie element ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Using these distance distributions , we next examined reporter activities . The most noticeable observation stems from the reporter with the λ replacement , in which transcription is largely abolished . This supports the conclusion that sustained proximity is necessary for productive transcription in our system . Indeed , for the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct , the sub - distribution of the enhancer – promoter distances obtained only from time traces displaying PP7 transcriptional activity is fully contained within the smaller Gaussian ( red curve in Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 6a ) , that is , all transcrip - tionally active reporters are physically close to the eve enhancers . However , among all enhancer – promoter distances occupying the small Gaussian , in only 54 % is the reporter active ( Fig . 3a ) . The pres - ence of traces in which the promoter is close to the enhancers but nevertheless inactive ( green curves , Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 6e ) suggests that the proximity obtained by homie – homie pairing is not sufficient to ensure transcription . Notably , on homie – homie pair - ing , the linear genomic distance between the reporter promoter and the eve enhancers is less than 10 kb , which is similar to the enhancer – promoter distances in the endogenous eve locus . Thus , while architectural proteins can bridge the gap between long - range enhancer – promoter interactions ( for example , 142 kb ) and short - range interactions ( for example , 1 – 10 kb ) , the facilitated proximity is not sufficient to assure transcription . Transcription reinforces topological compaction . Our analysis identifies three possible topological states of enhancer – promoter interaction : ( 1 ) open conformations that are transcriptionally inac - tive ( O off state ) , ( 2 ) homie – homie paired conformations that are transcriptionally inactive ( P off state ) , and ( 3 ) homie - homie paired conformations that are transcriptionally active ( P on state ) . To assess the physical properties and the transition kinetics of these states , we NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS assigned each time point of the 7 , 883 time traces to one of the three states . Specifically , we used a Bayes classifier to distinguish between the unpaired and the paired state , using time traces from the parS - λ - evePr - PP7 construct for the open state ( O ) and time traces with PP7 activity for the paired state ( P ) as training samples . Furthermore , we used the presence of the PP7 ( red ) signal to further divide the paired state ( P ) into an inactive P off state and an active P on state ( Supplementary Fig . 8a - j ; for details see Methods ) . When we compared the distance distribution of the inac - tive paired ( P off ) and the active paired ( P on ) states , we found that the mean ( ± s . d . ) r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distance for the P off state ( 385 ± 15 nm ) is significantly larger than for the P on state ( 331 ± 16 nm ) ( Fig . 3d , Supplementary Fig . 8k ) . The shorter r . m . s . distance in the transcriptionally active state is indicative of an enhanced compaction of the locus when the reporter is active . To further examine the relationship between compaction and transcription , we employed an additional variant of our reporter cassette , in which we deleted the promoter from our transgene ( parS - homie - noPr - PP7 ) . The r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distance distribution for this construct recovers the bi - modal distribution from the original construct representing the O off and P off states ( calculated from 2 , 566 nuclei in 29 embryos , Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . In particular , the mean r . m . s . enhancer – promoter dis - tance of the P off state measured for this promoter - less construct ( 374 ± 14 nm , mean ± s . d . ) coincides with that measured for the full construct ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Fig . 8k ) , and is thus larger than that of the P on population ( Fig . 3d , Supplementary Fig . 8k ) . Together , these results argue for the association of transcription with a smaller physical confinement . Transcription enhances stability of the paired conformation . Interestingly , we found that the parS - homie - noPr - PP7 construct , which is non - permissive for transcription , has a smaller fraction of the population in the homie paired conformation ( P state ) than does the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct , which is permissive for transcription ( 8 % versus 13 % , Fig . 3c , d ) . This suggests that tran - scription is not only associated with a more confined spatial confor - mation but may also be associated with a temporal stabilization of the paired conformation . In order to test this , we use a set of first - order reactions to model the kinetic transitions between the three topological states described above ( Fig . 3e , Supplementary Fig . 9a , see Methods ) . Using this model , we determined the transition rates by fit - ting the model - derived equations to the measured time courses of the fractional occupancies for each of the three states ( Fig . 3e , Supplementary Fig . 9a – h ) . The transition from an open topology to the homie - homie pairing state ( f 1 = 0 . 017 min − 1 , see Fig . 3e inset ) takes on average 1 h . This rate is ~ 8 times slower than the time it takes for the enhancer to explore the entire confined space in the vicinity of the promoter in the parS - λ - evePr - PP7 construct , as pre - dicted by our MSD results , assuming a simple first - passage model 34 ( where the time t = ( MSD / 6 D ) 1 / α , in which MSD is the λ control plateau in Fig . 1e , D is the apparent diffusion coefficient and α is the scaling constant , see Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . It is possible that the homie orientation preference for pairing 23 ( as was also described for other architectural factors , such as CTCF 35 , 36 ) constrains productive passages , thereby contributing to this slower rate . Notably , this rate of pairing is roughly an order of magnitude slower than the rapid transcriptional events that take place in the early fly embryo . This requirement of rapidity is possibly facilitated by closer enhancer – promoter distances , characteristic of early developmental genes , than the 142 kb that we explored here . Examining the other transition rates obtained from our model ( see Fig . 3e inset ) confirms the stabilizing effect of transcription on locus topology : the dissociation of the homie – homie pairing com - plex in the absence of transcription ( b 1 = 0 . 144 min − 1 ) is on average R ed s po t i n t en s i t y ( A U ) 5 15 25 a b PP7 MS2 parS 2 μ m Red - OFF Red - ON Red - ON Red - OFF Time ( min ) – 8 – 4 0 4 8 Time ( min ) – 8 – 4 0 4 8 E nhan c e r – p r o m o t e r d i s t an c e ( μ m ) 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 PP7 MS2 parS 2 μ m Fig . 2 | Sustained physical enhancer – promoter proximity is necessary for productive transcription . a , Average transcription activity ( red ) and enhancer – promoter distance ( r . m . s . distance between blue and green foci ) as a function of time for 286 nuclei transitioning from the Red - OFF to Red - ON state ( red spot intensity in arbitrary units ( AU ) ) .

NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS over ten times faster than the escape from the transcriptionally active state P on ( b 2 = 0 . 014 min − 1 , b 3 = 0 . 011 min − 1 , Supplementary Fig . 9e – g ) . These rates capture the escape from the transcription - ally active state P on ( b 2 and b 3 ) and recapitulate quantitatively the measured durations of transcriptional activity ( length of Red - ON trajectories , Supplementary Fig . 9h ) . Intriguingly , the average dura - tion of the transcriptionally active state is about 40 min ( 1 / ( b 2 + b 3 ) ) , which coincides with the length of the developmental time window in which the eve stripe enhancers are active in nc14 . This transcrip - tion - dependent stabilization might thus serve to reinforce the locus functionality for the appropriate developmental time scales . Ectopic enhancer – promoter interaction results in developmental defects . In our experiments , the eve stripe enhancers , distributed within the ~ 16 kb of the eve locus ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , drive expression of both the introduced reporter gene and the endogenous eve gene , which could possibly lead to competitive dynamics . To test this hypothesis , we compared eve transcriptional activity ( that is , the intensity of the blue MS2 signal ) in each individual nucleus in which the PP7 reporter gene is active to the activity in its neighbor - ing nuclei in which the reporter is inactive ( Fig . 4a , see Methods ) . Strikingly , for each eve stripe , we measured a 5 % – 20 % reduction in endogenous eve transcription in nuclei in which the reporter gene is 1 , 000 E n h a n c e r – p r o m o t e r d i s t a n c e ( n m ) 800 600 400 200 x10 – 3 1 2 3 0 P r obab ili t y den s i t y Enhancer – promoter distance ( nm ) 0 400 800 1 , 200 E n h a n c e r – p r o m o t e r d i s t a n c e ( n m ) 200 600 1 , 000 a b c d homie evePr PP7 mie ev homie evePr PP7 ePr homie evePr PP7 homie evePr PP7 mie e homie evePr PP7 vePr homie evePr PP7 100 % 92 % 8 % 87 % 7 % 6 % Time ( min ) 0 10 20 30 F r a c t i on ( % ) 0 5 10 15 1 - O off P off P on O off P off P on f 1 b 1 b 2 f 2 b 3 e Fig . 3 | Characterization of topological enhancer – promoter conformations , the kinetic transitions between them , and their relation to transcriptional activation . a , Enhancer – promoter distance distribution for three experimental constructs : parS - homie - evePr - PP7 ( n ! = ! 265 , 277 r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distances from 7 , 883 trajectories in 84 embryos ) , parS - homie - noPr - PP7 ( n ! = ! 81 , 629 r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distances from 2 , 566 trajectories in 29 embryos ) and parS - λ - evePr - PP7 ( n ! = ! 49 , 587 r . m . s . enhancer – promoter distances from 1 , 453 trajectories in 15 embryos ) ; black cross on construct label indicates deleted element from original .

NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS also transcribed compared to neighboring nuclei in which it is not transcribed . The average reduction per nucleus is highest for stripe 5 , and lowest for stripes 3 and 7 . eve is a primary pair - rule gene that is essential for segment pat - terning , allowing us to test whether the observed reduction in eve transcription has a phenotypic consequence . We crossed males car - rying a tag - less homie - evePr - lacZ transgene at − 142 kb to females heterozygous for a wild - type eve gene and an eve deficiency ( Df ( 2R ) eve ) ( Supplementary Fig . 10a ) . eve is weakly haploinsuffi - cient and 6 % of + / Df ( 2R ) eve flies display patterning defects in even - numbered parasegments ( Supplementary Fig . 10b – e ) . Consistent with the reduction in the level of eve nascent transcripts , the pres - ence of the homie - evePr - lacZ transgene exacerbates eve haploinsuf - ficiency ( Fig . 4b – d , Supplementary Fig . 10a ) . Altogether , 27 % of the homie - evePr - lacZ / Df ( 2R ) eve flies have abdominal defects , which corresponds to a ~ 5 - fold increase compared with the control crosses in which homie is replaced by phage λ DNA ( Fig . 4e , Supplementary Fig . 10a ) . Taken together , these results suggest that interference between two promoters in the early embryo can have phenotypic consequences for patterning in the adult . These findings reinforce the view that manipulating topological chromatin structures can functionally alter developmental programs 37 , 38 . Discussion Simultaneous multi - color live imaging of gene activity and the positions of genomic foci identifies a dynamic interplay between chromatin topology and transcriptional activity . By analyzing this interplay , we identify a requirement for a distinct topological structure that brings promoter and distant enhancer together in the nucleus , formed through pairing of insulator elements , for the initiation and maintenance of transcription . The temporal concor - dance between cessation of transcription and physical dissociation of this paired conformation argues against a suggested ‘hit - and - run’ model and argues in favor of the requirement for persistent physical enhancer – promoter proximity for sustained transcription . Notably , the physical proximity attained by insulator pairing is not a guarantee for transcriptional activation . This observation will prompt further investigation as to the mechanisms underlying the transition to an active state . These might involve a second , entropy - based search step resulting in direct physical contact between the enhancer and promoter , and / or entail transcription factor bind - ing with the involvement of other components of the transcrip - tion machinery ( for example , mediator , PolII pause - release ) , or a change in local chromatin accessibility , each of which was previ - ously associated with transitions from a transcriptionally ‘off’ to an ‘on’ state 12 , 39 – 43 . Our measurements provide further insights into the open debate on whether topological changes precede transcription 44 , 45 . Specifically , our results argue for a complex interplay , as we observe a transcription - mediated reshaping of the kinetic land - scape of 3D genome organization . While transcription seems to require physical proximity , it is in turn associated with further spatial compaction and temporal stabilization . It is possible that transcription can only occur within close proximity ( even within the range of P off distances ) , and that the observed spatial compac - tion could result from a biased sampling of the P off distribution by transcription and not necessarily an active mechanism of com - paction . The observed compaction is also consistent with recently proposed hypotheses that phase behaviors might contribute to the formation of Pol II ‘factories’ or transcription ‘hubs’ within topo - logically associated domains 46 – 48 . Overall , we identify and characterize three states ; one in which the distal enhancer and the promoter are not together ( O off ) , a sec - ond in which they are ‘within range’ ( as afforded by insulator pair - ing ) but the gene is transcriptionally inactive ( P off ) , and a third , which seems stabilized by transcriptional activation ( P on ) , and in eve activity | Red - ON ( AU ) 7 9 11 e v e a c t i v i t y | R ed - O FF ( A U ) 7 9 11 Stripe 3 Stripe 4 Stripe 5 Stripe 6 Stripe 7 C oun t 100 300 500 700 Wild type Mutant a e 3 4 5 6 7 % e v e a c t i v i t y r edu c t i on 5 15 A1 A2 A3 A5 A6 A4 A7 200 μ m A1 A2 A3 A5 A6 A4 A7 b d P = 0 . 57 P = 3 . 3 × 10 – 21 A1 A2 A3 A5 A6 A4 A7 D f ( 2 R ) e v e S p ho m i e - e v e P r - l a c Z D f ( 2 R ) e v e D f ( 2 R ) e v e S p λ - e v e P r - l a c Z D f ( 2 R ) e v e Cross I Cross II c 200 μ m 200 μ m Fig . 4 | Long - distance - mediated promoter competition results in patterning phenotypes . a , Endogenous eve - MS2 activity in nuclei that also display PP7 reporter activity ( x axis ) is lower than in the neighboring nuclei where PP7 is not expressed ( y axis ) .

NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS which they are close together . These results are consistent with several recent observations obtained from fixed samples , includ - ing observations of proximity of an enhancer to a promoter prior to activation 12 and of an increase in co - localization in expressing tissues 49 . Our observations suggesting that transcription is asso - ciated with a different 3D landscape are also in line with recent Hi - C experiments carried out in the early Drosophila embryo , in which the authors suggest an effect of transcription on local chro - matin organization , such as co - localization of boundaries and local compaction 44 . Interestingly , topological domain boundaries , as captured by recent early embryo Hi - C experiments , coincide with DNA regions that are rich in insulator protein binding 44 , 50 . Indeed , previous stud - ies showed that insulator proteins demarcate regulatory units of the fly genome , often separating differentially expressed genes 51 . These proteins have been suggested not only to contribute to the formation of boundaries but also to facilitate physical interactions between boundaries to form “loop domains” 44 , 50 , probably through protein pairing 52 . Importantly , such interactions between insulators were specifically also implicated in mediating long - range activation 52 , 53 . While such long - range interactions might not be ubiquitous in the very early embryo undergoing rapid nuclear divisions ( 0 – 2 h ) , in slightly older embryos ( 3 – 8 h ) they were found to be prevalent ( with a reporter median distance of 110 kb ) 12 . Our observation of a nearly inactive reporter at a distance of ~ 140 kb in the absence of the homie insulator suggests the necessity of these architectural elements in mediating long - range activation . Naturally , the exact properties of such elements could differ , affect - ing , for instance , the likelihood of pairing even on an encounter ( for example , depending on orientation preferences ) and the stability of the paired configuration . Such differences could then influence to some degree the kinetics of transcription ( for example , affecting the rate of escape from the paired transcribing state ) . In the con - structs presented here , we chose to include the homie element , due a documented role in the endogenous eve locus 22 . This allowed us to obtain pairing over long distances and thereby enabled our live examination of enhancer – promoter interactions , linking 3D topol - ogy and transcription . The overall landscape of the fly genome , as it emerges from mapping insulator binding , chromosome conforma - tion capture experiments , and locus - specific studies , suggests that our genomic constructs ( with activation over > 100 - kb distance , and with physical proximity facilitated by insulator pairing ) are captur - ing fundamental properties of long - range activation in flies , and probably also in other higher eukaryotes . Finally , we show that a perturbation involving long - range activa - tion by an endogenous enhancer can have clear phenotypic implica - tions . This strengthens previous observations linking disease and aberrant transcription to 3D genome structure 38 , 54 , and highlights the necessity of methods to mechanistically study these links 55 . Extensions of our approach to study different genes , regulated by enhancers at different distances , whose interaction is mediated by different architectural proteins , and in various developmental stages and organisms , will thus probably uncover new mechanistic insights into enhancer – promoter interactions .

Plasmid maps and cloning details are available on request . Transgenic fly generation . To tag endogenous eve with MS2 stem loops , a two - step transgenic strategy was used . First , an attP site was integrated into the first intron of eve using CRIPSR - mediated homology - directed repair . The homology arms were amplified from the genomic DNA of BDSC # 51324 , which was used as a genomic source for nos - Cas9 . The two Cas9 cutting sites are at chr2R : 9 , 979 , 604 - 9 , 979 , 605 and chr2R : 9 , 980 , 605 - 9 , 980 , 606 ( dm6 ) , respectively . Second , an attB - MS2 - lacZ - eve3’UTR plasmid was used to deliver MS2 into the attP site . A genomic source of phiC31 integrase ( BDSC # 34770 ) was used for the second injection . The final eve - MS2 transformant carries a ~ 9 . 5 - kb insertion ( selection markers ) between the MS2 - lacZ - eve 3’UTR and the downstream eve enhancers . The eve - MS2 flies were crossed with a 2 × attP genomic landing site at chr2R : 9 , 836 , 454 ( dm6 , − 142 kb to eve promoter 22 ) to obtain recombinants that carry eve - MS2 and the − 142 kb landing site in cis . The reporter transgenes were then integrated into the landing site through recombination - mediated cassette exchange using BDSC # 34770 as the integrase source . For the fluorescence - tagged maternal proteins ( MCP : : 3 × mTagBFP2 , PCP : : 3 × mKate2 and MCP : : mCherry ) , a genomic landing site at 38F1 60 was used . For maternal ParB : : eGFP , LacI : : GFP and PCP : : eGFP , a landing site at 89B8 was used . All microinjections were performed as described previously 61 or through BestGene injection service . FISH . smFISH followed a previously described protocol 62 . Atto labeled probe sets targeting eve CDS and the 5’ 1 . 7 kb of lacZ were used . Raw images were processed following Little et al . 63 to identify all cytoplasmic spots and transcription spots . A cytoplasmic unit ( CU ) that corresponds to the fluorescence intensity of a single cytoplasmic mRNA was calculated . Specifically , a sliding window of 220 × 220 × 23 pixels ( 16 . 5 × 16 . 5 × 7 . 4 μ m 3 ) was applied to the raw image stack and the total pixel values in the window were plot against the number of cytoplasmic spots found in the window . A linear fit in the range of 0 – 100 cytoplasmic spots was applied to extract CU for each probe set ( Supplementary Fig . 2f , inset ) . In order to get the number of Pol II in each transcription spot , a cylinder mask ( d = 13 pixel , h = 7 pixel ) centered at the brightest pixel in each transcription spot was used to calculate total spot intensities , which were converted using the corresponding CU and probe configuration for the transcribed sequence . Because the eve - MS2 allele is targeted by only a part of the eve probe set , a conversion factor was calculated from the proportion of bound probes . The CU obtained from the full - length eve transcripts was then adjusted using this conversion factor to get pol II number on eve - MS2 from the eve channel ( y axis in Supplementary Fig . 2f ) . Phenotypic scoring . The homie - evePr - lacZ / CyO flies or the λ - evePr - lacZ / CyO flies were crossed with an isogenic yw ; Sp / CyO ( BDSC # 8379 ) to get Sp / homie - evePr - lacZ and Sp / λ - evePr - lacZ males . Single males were then crossed with CyO / Dp ( 2R ) eve - virgins 22 in order to score phenotypic defects in the next generation . Since phenotypic penetrance can be very sensitive to environmental conditions ( for example , temperature , humidity , food , etc ) and genetic background , our crossing and scoring scheme included controls for all these potentially confounding factors . Microscopy and imaging conditions . For imaging parS - containing transgenes , virgins carrying three fluorescent protein fusions ( yw ; MCP : : 3 × mTagBFP2 / PCP : : 3 × mKate2 ; ParB : : eGFP / + ) were crossed with males carrying the eve - MS2 allele and the reporter transgene . For the 0 - kb co - localization control , virgins carrying three fluorescent protein fusions ( yw , MCP : : 3 × mTagBFP2 / MCP : : mCherry ; PCP : : eGFP / + ) were crossed with males carrying the hbP2 - 24 × MS2PP7 - kni transgene . For the lacO / LacI control , virgins with three fluorescent protein fusions ( yw ; MCP : : 3 × mTagBFP2 / PCP : : 3 × mKate2 ; LacI : : GFP / + ) were used . The embryos from the above crosses were manually dechorionated and mounted as described 32 . For bead experiments , 200 nm three - color coated TetraSpec beads were used . All images were acquired on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a Leica oil immersion 63 × NA1 . 44 objective . Three laser lines at 405 nm ( 0 . 4 μ W ) , 488 nm ( 1 . 1 μ W ) and 591 nm ( 0 . 5 μ W ) were used to excite the blue , green and red fluorophores , respectively . For bead experiments , we modulated laser powers to get a spectrum of emission signals . Three HyD detectors in photon counting mode were used to collect fluorescence emission spectra . Voxel size for all images was set at 107 × 107 × 334 nm 3 and the total volume imaged was about 110 × 27 × 8 μ m 3 . Frame interval for all time - lapse videos was 30 s , except for the ones shown in Fig . 1c ( 15 s ) . Images were taken at 1 , 024 × 256 × 25 voxels and focused on the posterior half of the embryo , encompassing eve stripes 3 – 7 . Embryos that exit mitosis 13 were timed 64 . Imaging started at 20 ± 2 min into nc14 and finished at gastrulation ( 62 ± 2 min into nc14 ) . Image processing and data analysis . All image processing and data analysis was performed using MATLAB R2015a , MathWorks . Nuclear segmentation and tracking . Nuclear segmentation was performed on the difference between the blue and red channels ( NLS : : MCP : : 3 × mTagBFP2 is enriched in the nuclear compartment while ParB - eGFP is enriched in the cytoplasm ) : the maximum z - projection of the green channel was subtracted from the blue channel , and the resulting image was subsequently Gaussian blurred ( σ = 5 ) , binarized ( using a local Otsu’s threshold at 5 × 5 μ m 2 ) and opened with a disk of diameter d = 5 pixels . A watershed transformation was performed on the distance matrix calculated from the binarized image to get the segmentation for each frame , and a nuclear mask was calculated from each segmented region . Since each frame contains only 70 – 100 nuclei , we used an exhaustive search for nuclear tracking . Because both the whole embryo and the nuclei might move during imaging , we calculated a local vector that recapitulates the nuclear movement by minimizing cross - correlation between nuclear masks of two consecutive frames . After correcting for movement , we multiplied each nuclear mask at time t to all individual nuclear masks from t + 1 , and the matching nucleus was selected based on the total pixel value of the product images . All nuclear segmentation and tracking results were scrutinized manually . Candidate spot identification . We built a candidate spot library for each video . First , raw image stacks from each of the three channels were sharpened using a 3D bandpass filter of size 11 × 11 × 7 pixels , which was derived from subtracting a uniform filter from a Gaussian kernel ( σ = ( 1 , 1 , 0 . 6 ) pixel ) . We treated all local maxima in the filtered image as putative spots , and a cylinder mask with diameter of 13 pixels ( 1 . 4 μ m ) and a height of 7 pixels ( 2 . 3 μ m ) centered at each local maximum was constructed . The size of the mask was determined by the size of the mega - spot images ( Supplementary Fig . 3e - h ) and covered > 97 % of signals emitted from the chromatin foci . Therein we summed up all pixels inside the mask to get the intensity of each putative spot . Finally , for each nucleus at each time point , an intensity threshold was chosen to select candidate spots from the local maxima , in such a way that the maximum number of candidate spots in the nucleus was less than 20 . In the subsequent steps , we filtered the candidate spot library using information on nuclear lineage , spot tracking and the relative location of spot pairs . Spot tracking . The intensity - weighted centroid was calculated within the mask of each candidate spot , and the FracShift algorithm 65 was applied to find the sub - pixel center for each spot . No sub - pixel bias was observed after ten FracShift iterations . We did spot tracking in each nuclear lineage . For each lineage , candidate spots located in the corresponding nuclear region ( from the nuclear segmentation results ) were used for tracking . Spot tracking was performed in three steps : a pre - tracking step , a gap - filling step and a Bayes filtering step . Step I : For the pre - tracking step , we tracked the two brightest candidate spots in each nucleus . The maximally allowable displacement of spots from the consecutive frames was determined from the MSD at Δ t = 30 s ( 1 frame , see “MSD analysis” section below and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) and the measurement error ( e L , see “Estimating localization errors” section below and Supplementary Fig . 3a – d ) for each dimension . Specifically , for each candidate spot at time t , a search zone of size 3 × ( ∕ MSD 2 + e L ) was set up around the spot center . After correcting for nuclear shift , a candidate spot in the searching zone at time t + 1 was recorded , and other candidate spots were discarded . In the < 1 % of cases where there was more than one candidate spot in the search zone , the brightest one was chosen . Finally , all traces shorter than 2 min are treated as false positives and discarded . These false positive traces are usually clusters of completed mRNAs that are undergoing nuclear export . All tracking was performed on videos of 35 min length ( 22 – 58 min in n . c . 14 ) . The three channels ( MS2 , PP7 and parS ) were tracked independently . Pre - tracking results from all channels were compiled according to nuclear lineages . Step II : After collecting the pre - tracking results , we analyzed for each channel ( 1 ) the distribution of spot axial positions , ( 2 ) the distribution of spot intensities , ( 3 ) the distribution of displacement vectors , and additionally for the blue ( eve - MS2 ) channel , and ( 4 ) the distribution of spot anterior - posterior positions . We then implemented a Dijkstra algorithm 66 to find the minimal path that fills the gaps in the pre - tracking results . Specifically , using the distributions described previously , we calculated a cost function ( log likelihood ) for each link that connects any two candidate spots from two consecutive frames and constructed the set of links that minimized the sum of the costs across the gap . At the end of this gap - filling step , we obtained one tracked spot for each nucleus at each time point . Step III : Finally , we filtered these tracked spots using a Bayes binary filter . First , a false positive data set ( FP ) is constructed by re - tracking the candidate spot library after removing spots that were previously tracked . The pre - tracking result from Step I was used as the true positive set ( TP ) . For each spot obtained from Step II , we then used the information ( info ) of its location , intensity , the displacement from the previous frame and the displacement toward the next frame to obtain NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS likelihood P ( info | FP ) and P ( info | TP ) , respectively . Next , we calculated the priors P ( FP ) and P ( TP ) by fitting a two - component Gaussian mixture model for the vectors that connects the tracked blue and green spots in the same nucleus . Finally , we obtained the posterior probability P ( TP | info ) and used a cutoff that maximizes the Matthews correlation coefficient to filter false positive spots . The sensitivity of the filter ranged from 96 . 2 % to 99 . 1 % , and the false discovery rate was less than 1 % . Calibrating chromatic aberrations . Chromatic aberration was corrected to measure distance between spots of different colors . The calibration was data - driven and internally controlled . We assumed that the vector between a spot pair of two different colors in the same nucleus has a zero mean in each dimension . An MS2 spot ( blue ) , for instance , has the same probability of appearing on top of the associating parS spot ( green ) as the probability of appearing below it , and the distribution is symmetric around zero . We performed additional control experiments to verify this assumption ( see below ) . We pooled raw instantaneous spot - pair distances from all nuclei at all time points in all available embryos and analyzed the raw distances as a function of the spot - pair positions in the image field of view ( for example , Supplementary Fig . 3b shows the blue - green distance in the x - direction as a function of the x - position in the image of view ) . We applied a multivariate normal regression model ( A i = p i β + e i , i = x , y , z ) in order to get the correction matrix β , where A i is the 3D response vector for the chromatic aberration , p i is the spot position with a constant term , and e i is a normally distributed error . For each spot pair , chromatic aberration was calculated using β , and the calibrated distances were used in further analysis . The correction matrix was calculated on a weekly basis , using all embryos imaged over the week ( embryo number ranging from 12 to 25 , usually of the same genotype ) . To test the validity of the zero mean assumption described previously , we undertook two control experiments . First , we imaged our co - localization control embryos in which blue , green and red fluorescent proteins co - localized within a genomic distance of 2 kb ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Second , we made videos of the 200 nm three - color TetraSpec beads . These experiments were performed during the same week and under the same optical settings as for the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 embryos , and the images were analyzed using the same code pipeline . Next , we applied the same calibration method to obtain the correction matrix for the control embryos or beads . There was no significant difference between the fitting parameters obtained from the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 embryos and those from the control embryos or beads ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Specifically , applying the correction matrix derived from the control embryos on the experimental embryos introduced < 0 . 6 % difference in the calibrated distances . Estimating localization errors . To estimate the precision in our distance measurement , we used the three - color control embryos described above . Briefly , the standard deviation ( s . d . ) from the fitted line ( Supplementary Fig . 3b , middle ) , which is the mean after chromatic correction , represents the localization error ( e L ) . For example , for the distance between the MS2 ( blue ) and parS ( green ) spots , the s . d . s for the lateral and axial directions are 75 nm and 150 nm , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . These errors were subtracted in the calculations of time or population - averaged r . m . s . distances ( see “Calculating r . m . s . distances” section below ) . We then assessed whether these localization errors result from optics or from the dynamic properties of our live embryos . From the beads videos we measured lateral and axial errors of 20 nm and 50 nm , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . The differences in the measurement errors between embryos and beads were not due to differences in photon counts ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . We conclude that approximately two - thirds of our localization errors were derived from the properties of the live system . At least two factors might contribute to the increased errors we observed in the embryo . First , the nuclei were imaged during S or G2 phase , and individual transcription spots actually represent two sister chromatids . Second , each z - slice takes ~ 1 s , and the expected MSD is ~ 0 . 1 μ m 2 from the extrapolation of our MSD analysis . As a result , the movement of the spots between two consecutive z - stacks introduces ‘motion blur’ , which leads to increased localization error . Since the parS - homie - eve - PP7 embryos are expected to share the same biological and optical properties as the three - color control embryos , we assume the same localization errors . Calculating r . m . s . distances . We report time - or population - averaged r . m . s . distances between the MS2 ( blue ) and the parS ( green ) spot pairs . For time - averaged r . m . s . distances , instantaneous distances measured at different time points in the same nucleus were averaged . We analyzed the distribution of r . m . s . distances calculated at different time scales , either for the complete time trace ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) or for a short time window ( 5 min , Fig . 3a ) in order to characterize topological transitions occurring at the relevant time scales . We further classified all r . m . s . distances into two groups ( Red - ON and Red - OFF ) according to the presence or absence of the red signal ( PP7 transcription ) . For r . m . s . distances obtained from the complete traces , Red - OFF r . m . s . distances were calculated from traces that never show PP7 transcription , while Red - ON r . m . s . distances were calculated from the part of the traces that displayed PP7 activity ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . For r . m . s . distances obtained from short sliding time windows , Red - OFF r . m . s . distances were calculated from traces that never showed PP7 transcription , and Red - ON r . m . s . distances were calculated from traces that displayed PP7 activity at all time points across the window ( Fig . 3a ) . We also calculated population - averaged r . m . s . distances ( Fig . 2 , Fig . 3b – d , Supplementary Fig . 8k ) for a group of nuclei that shared the same temporal or spatial register . For example , we aligned all traces with Red - OFF to Red - ON transitions and calculated the r . m . s . distances from nuclei aligned at the same time relative to the initiation of PP7 transcription ( Fig . 2a ) . Similarly , we calculated r . m . s . distances for all nuclei classified as being in the same topological state ( Fig . 3b – d , Supplementary Fig . 8k ) . Since the measurement errors ( e i ) described in the previous section and spot pair distances did not seem to be correlated , we reported an error - corrected r . m . s . corr , obtained by subtracting the errors from the raw r . m . s . distances : r . m . s . corr 2 = r . m . s . 2 − Σ i = ( dx , dy , dz ) e i2 = Σ i = ( dx , dy , dz ) 〈 i + e i 〉 2 − Σ i = ( dx , dy , dz ) e i2 , where i is the actual blue - green ( MS2 - parS ) distance in each dimension and e i is the localization error in the corresponding dimension , which is the s . d . obtained from the three - color control ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . Gaussian mixture fits . The probability distribution functions of r . m . s . distances ( except for the λ control in Fig . 3c ) were modeled with two - component Gaussian mixtures with five parameters : two means ( μ 1 and μ 2 ) and s . d . s ( σ 1 and σ 2 ) for the two Gaussians and the proportion ( p ) of the components . Maximum likelihood estimates were performed using MATLAB’s mle function . The fitting results were robust to the choice of initial values , and convergence was always reached after 250 iterations . For the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 embryos , the Gaussian component with the smaller mean is composed of two populations . Time trace alignment . Time series of PP7 activities were aligned with respect to 1 ) the initiation of PP7 transcription , that is , the first time point at which nascent PP7 transcripts ( red spots ) could be detected , or 2 ) the termination of PP7 transcription , that is , the last time point at which PP7 transcripts could be identified ; 90 % of nuclei with PP7 activities contained single PP7 activity traces . For the other 10 % of nuclei in which there are two PP7 activity traces , we aligned the initiation of the first trace or the termination of the second . There were cases where eve - MS2 and PP7 transcription started at the same time , presumably because homie - homie pairing occurred before eve enhancers started to function . Therefore , for the initiation analysis , we only aligned PP7 activity traces where eve - MS2 transcription appeared at least 3 min before PP7 transcription was activated . Similarly , for the termination analysis , we only aligned PP7 activity traces where eve - MS2 transcription lasted for at least 3 min after PP7 transcription ceased . MSD analysis . We analyzed the relative motion between two associated spots ( for example , MS2 and parS ) by computing the time - averaged mean squared displacement ( MSD ) , that is , the mean squared change in distances , between a specific spot pair over all time points separated by time interval Δ t ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . We computed an embryo - averaged MSD and a population - averaged MSD by pooling all spot pairs in an embryo and all spot pairs in a population of embryos , respectively . The embryo - averaged and population - averaged 3D MSDs were fit to a model for 3D anomalous diffusion , that is , MSD = 6D ( Δ t ) α with an anomalous diffusion coefficient D and a scaling factor α that were extracted . Non - linear least - squares fits were performed for Δ t < 4 min . Classification of instantaneous topological states . Because of the fast chromatin motion ( D = 0 . 04 μ m 2 s − 0 . 24 , Fig . 1e , Supplementary Fig . 4d ) and the relatively small confinement of the enhancer – promoter locus ( ~ 1 μ m for the open state ) , distributions of the instantaneous enhancer – promoter distance for the open state and the homie - homie paired state overlapped significantly , which hindered the characterization of the instantaneous topological state of the enhancer – promoter locus . We therefore took advantage of the continuity of live imaging and calculated the velocity of the relative enhancer – promoter movement ( displacement across one frame ) at each time point ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . Since the time scale of topological state transitions seems to be at least one order of magnitude slower than the time resolution of our live imaging ( which is validated by our kinetic model ) , the velocities provide extra information for identifying the instantaneous topological state . We therefore used a binary classifier to classify each enhancer – promoter locus at each time point regarding its topological state , either open ( O ) or paired ( P ) . We applied one training sample for each of the two states . For the open state , we used time series traces obtained from the parS - λ - evePr - PP7 embryos , which presumably were composed solely of the open state . For the paired state , we used all traces where PP7 transcription occurred , considering that physical proximity is required for promoter activity so that time series traces accompanied by PP7 activity were exclusively in the paired state . For each training sample , we modeled the joint distribution of the distance vector and the velocity vectors as a multivariate Gaussian ( Supplementary Fig . 8c – j ) . There is a negative correlation ( − 0 . 32 , Pearson correlation coefficient ) between velocities measured in two consecutive frames ( Supplementary Fig . 8g – j ) , which is consistent with the strong sub - diffusive behavior we observed from the MSD analysis ( α = 0 . 24 , Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Using the distance and the velocity information ( Data ) , we calculated the likelihood P ( Data | O - state ) and P ( Data | P - state ) from the two trained joint NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics ARTICLES NATURE GENETICS distributions , respectively . Furthermore , we calculated the priors P ( P - state ) and P ( O - state ) , for each developmental time point , by pooling data from all embryos . Specifically , we used a time window ( 5 min ) centered at the specific time point and calculated the r . m . s . distance for each nucleus . The distribution of these r . m . s . distances was modeled as a two - component Gaussian mixture , and the proportion of the Gaussian component with the smaller mean was used as prior P ( P - state ) for this developmental time point . The posterior probability P ( P - state | Data ) was then calculated according to Bayes rule . Finally , we estimated the errors ( specificity and sensitivity ) of our classifier from the two training samples , and a posterior probability cutoff that maximizes the Matthews correlation coefficient was used for state calling . Modeling topological state transitions and MCMC Inference of kinetic parameters . We used a set of first - order reactions to model the transitions between the three topological states ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . Based on the finding that physical proximity is required for transcriptional activation , we built a model such that P on occurs only after P off is established . Assuming that the parameters f 1 and b 1 are the same for both the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 and the parS - homie - noPr - PP7 constructs , we also used the O off time series from the latter to constrain our parameter inference . To infer the kinetic parameters , we used Metropolis – Hastings algorithm to perform MCMC . Specifically , given a parameter set : θ θ = ⋃ = = … f b f b b F O homie F P homie F O noPrmt { } { , , , , , ( , ) , ( , ) , ( , ) } k k 1 , 2 , 8 1 1 2 2 3 ini off ini on ini off where the three F ini are the initial conditions for the indicated states and genotype , we used time series σ = ⋃ D F t t { ( ) , ( ) } ij j i j i , 2 to calculate the likelihood : ∏ θ θ μ σ ∣ = ∣ = P D N f t F t t ( ) ( ( ) , ( ) , ( ) ) ij j i ij j i j i , , 2 where θ ∣ f t ( ) j i is solved numerically from the coupled ordinary differential equations ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) with MATLAB ode45 . F j = 1 , 2 , 3 corresponds to the measured time series of the fraction of the O off state for parS - homie - evePr - PP7 , the fraction of the P on state for parS - homie - evePr - PP7 , and the fraction of the O off state for parS - homie - noPr - PP7 , respectively , and i = 1 , 2 , … , T are the developmental time points from 25 to 55 min in nuclear cycle 14 . Using prior π θ θ = ∏ ∕ ( ) ( 1 ) k k 0 and a log - normal proposal distribution : θ θ θ ∣ = Σ N J ( * ) log ( log ( ) , ) we generated a Markov chain to sample posterior distributions of the kinetic parameters with acceptance probability : ∏ ∏ α θ θ θ π θ θ θ θ π θ θ θ θ σ θ σ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ − ⎛ ⎝⎜⎜⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟⎟⎟⎟ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟ N N P D J P D J F t t F t t ( , ) min 1 , ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) min 1 , ( ( ) , ( ) ) ( ( ) , ( ) ) * * * * * * i j j i i i j j i i 0 0 , 2 , 2 1 All simulated chains converged after 5 , 000 iterations , and we used 90 , 000 stationary samples to represent the posterior distributions of the kinetic parameters ( Supplementary Fig . 9c – g ) . Transcriptional activity measurements . Transcriptional activity was measured as the sum of the pixel intensities in the spot mask ( d = 1 . 4 μ m , h = 2 . 3 μ m ) . For aligned PP7 activity traces ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) where PP7 was not active ( Red - OFF part ) , a mask around the parS spot ( green ) in the same nucleus was made . The mask was allowed to shift within the range defined by the mean parS - PP7 ( green - red ) distance . The maximal integrated intensity in the red channel was used as the PP7 activity . Endogenous eve activity comparison . For each trace with PP7 activity , we integrated eve - MS2 activity in the same nucleus to get eve - MS2 activity while PP7 transcription is active ( eve | Red - ON , Fig . 4a , x axis ) . Only nuclei with PP7 activity lasting longer than 12 min were used . To obtain the control , which is the eve - MS2 activity while PP7 transcription is not active ( eve | Red - OFF , Fig . 4a , y axis ) , we calculated the mean of the integrated eve - MS2 activities in the neighboring nuclei where PP7 was not transcribed . Neighborhood is defined as nuclei within a 20 μ m anterior - posterior bin centered at the nucleus displaying PP7 activity . The time interval for eve - MS2 activity integration is the same as for the PP7 expressing nucleus . The time - averaged integrated intensity is shown in Fig . 4a . Statistical analysis . Two - tailed Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed to compare enhancer – promoter distances in different topological states . One - tailed Fisher’s exact tests were performed to test for enhanced penetrance of the phenotypic defects associated with the homie transgenes . MCMC inference of the kinetics parameters is described in Image processing and data analysis .

NATURE GENETICS | www . nature . com / naturegenetics Supplementary Figure 1 FISH reveals eve enhancer - dependent expression of a reporter gene located 142 kb upstream of the endogenous eve locus . a , Genomic design of a synthetic long - range enhancer – promoter interaction . An ectopic homie insulator sequence with an eve promoter driving lacZ is integrated at ~ 142 kb upstream of the eve locus . Embryos homozygous for this construct are hybridized with single - molecule FISH probes to label endogenous eve ( red ) and lacZ ( green ) mRNA . b , Top , surface view of a 2 . 5 - h - old Drosophila embryo hybridized with eve - atto633 probes . Anterior is to the left . Bottom , z - stack projection of the marked region in the top panel . LacZ activity ( labeled with lacZ - atto565 probes ) only occurs sporadically within the limits of the eve pattern ( red ) . This lacZ pattern appears in all 13 embryos imaged ( 2 – 3 h old ) and a representative sample is shown here . Supplementary Figure 2 The eve - MS2 allele recapitulates the expression pattern and transcriptional activity of the endogenous eve gene . a , Editing the endogenous eve locus ( top ) to obtain the eve - MS2 allele ( bottom ) . Arrowheads indicate primers for PCR genotyping . Green and red lines mark sequences targeted by smFISH probes ( lacZ - atto565 and eve - atto633 , respectively ) . Loci are not drawn to scale . b , Genotyping the eve - MS2 allele . The PCR result from a single fly carrying the eve - MS2 allele is shown with DNA ladder . The 466 - bo band was verified by sequencing . Primers are shown in a . c – g , smFISH quantification of the transcriptional activity of the eve - MS2 allele from a representative embryo at ~ 45 min into nc14 . Maximum z projections are shown for the lacZ - atto565 channel ( c ) and the eve - atto633 channel ( d ) of an eve - MS2 / eve + embryo . eve stripes 5 to 7 ( from left to right ) are shown . e , Magnified view of the square in c and d . Nuclear regions are marked with yellow dashed lines . Arrows indicate examples of eve - MS2 transcription loci that are labeled by both probes . f , Cytoplasmic spots and active transcription spots were identified by image analysis routines ( Methods ) . A cytoplasmic unit ( CU ) that corresponds to the fluorescent intensity of a single cytoplasmic mRNA is extracted . The panel shows the number of RNA polymerase II ( PolII ) on the eve - MS2 loci from 93 nuclei in which a transcription spot in the eve - atto633 channel was observed at the eve - MS2 locus . The PolII numbers are inferred from either the CU derived from lacZ - atto565 ( x axis ) or eve - atto633 ( y axis ) measurements . The inset shows the calculation of cytoplasmic unit for eve . Specifically , a sliding window of 220 × 220 × 23 pixels ( 16 . 5 × 16 . 5 × 7 . 4 (cid:80) m 3 ) is applied to the raw image stack ( c and d ) and the total pixel values in the window are plotted against the number of cytoplasmic spots found in the window . A linear fit in the range of 0 – 100 cytoplasmic spots is applied to extract CU for each probe set . g , Comparison of the PolII number on the eve - MS2 locus and on the endogenous eve locus ( mean ± s . d . ) . Note that the numbers reported in f and g are for two sister chromatids . The number of nuclei analyzed for stripes 1 to 7 was 25 , 28 , 24 , 23 , 25 , 27 and 54 , respectively . Analysis performed on other embryos ( n = 3 ) imaged at different stages in nc14 also showed no significant difference in PolII numbers on the eve - MS2 locus and the endogenous eve locus . Supplementary Figure 3 Spot localization precision and measurement error . a , Genetic design of a transgene that colocalizes all three reporter systems . MS2 and PP7 stem loops are alternated and repeated 24 times . A knirps ( kni ) reporter gene , which includes the kni CDS ( with the start codon removed ) and 3 (cid:99) UTR , is driven by a hunchback P2 ( hbP2 ) promoter , resulting in expression in all nuclei located in the anterior 10 – 45 % of the embryo . b , Analysis of chromatic aberration and localization error ( Methods ) . Panels show the linear distance ( along the x coordinate only ) for each blue - green spot pair as a function of the pair’s x position for eve - MS2 embryos carrying the parS - homie - eve - PP7 transgene ( left , n = 34 embryos ) , embryos carrying the three - color colocalization transgene from a ( middle , n = 9 embryos ) , and TetraSpec beads ( right , n = 5 independent data sets ) , respectively . Blue data points are for all spot pairs at all time frames for all embryos analyzed . Yellow data points are from one of the embryos ( or one set of experiment for the beads ) . Linear fits in each panel report on the chromatic aberrations between blue and green spots in the x direction . As slopes and intercepts for the different samples show no significant differences , chromatic aberrations can be corrected for each individual embryo dataset internally . c , Summary of the distributions of spot pair distances ( after chromatic aberration correction ) for the three configurations in b . Each direction ( x , y , and z ) is shown for each color combination . For example , for the blue - green ( MS2 - parS ) distances in the x direction , the s . d . of the parS - homie - eve - PP7 transgene ( labeled – 142 kb ) corresponds to the solid black bar shown in the left panel of b . Spot localization errors are estimated from the s . d . measured with the three - color colocalization control embryos ( labeled 0 kb ) . Center values , means ; solid lines , s . d . ; bars , 25 – 75 % quantiles . d , Dependence of localization precision on signal intensities . Since localization precision scales directly with the square root of the number of photons , we can assess localization error of the three - color colocalization control embryos from the localization error measured with immobilized beads of similar fluorescent intensity values ( photon counts ) . Thus , differences in y - axis offset are not due to differences in photon counts but are due to ‘ motion blurring ’ of the moving spot during acquisition , which amounts to about two - thirds of the total localization . The remaining one - third ( corresponding to the error obtained from immobile beads ) stems from optical measurement noise and our analysis pipeline . e – h , Optical characterization of nascent transcription sites and parS foci . For each fluorescent channel , all identified fluorescent spots are classified into eight groups according to their raw intensities . A ‘ super - spot ’ for each group is obtained by aligning all spots of a group with the brightest pixel at the center of a 25 × 25 × 13 voxel region of interest and by taking the average intensity per voxel in that region over all spots . The intensity profiles along the x ( e , f ) and z ( g , h ) cross - sections for the blue MS2 super - spot ( e , g ) and green parS super - spot ( f , h ) are plotted ( darker curves represent brighter spots ) . Dashed lines are from equivalent measurements of TetraSpec beads . Images of the super - spots for the brightest blue ( MS2 ; e , g ) or green ( parS ; f , h ) spots ( top ) and for the beads ( bottom ) are shown as panel insets . Supplementary Figure 4 Different genomic labeling approaches report on similar chromatin dynamics and transcription kinetics . a , Three methods of labeling genomic loci . b , The measured blue - green ( MS2 - parS ) distances are not sensitive to labeling approach . The box plot shows the distributions of the instantaneous distance between spot pairs in the same nuclei . Distances shown are after chromatic aberration corrections . For all three genomic settings , the MS2 - parS ( blue - green ) distances showed no significant differences ( one - way Kruskal – Wallis test on individual embryo mean distances , n = 34 , 9 and 6 embryos for sets A , B and C , respectively ) . This was observed regardless of the absence ( Red - OFF , P = 0 . 17 , (cid:70) 2 = 4 . 3 , d . f . = 50 ) or presence ( Red - ON , P = 0 . 60 , (cid:70) 2 = 1 . 04 , d . f . = 49 ) of PP7 activity . Center values , medians ; boxes , interquantile ranges ( 25 – 75 % quantiles ) ; whiskers , 1 . 5 times the interquantile range . The 0 kb control is the hbP2 - MS2PP7 - kni embryo described in Supplementary Fig . 3 . c , The distances between spot pairs reflect their genomic arrangement . Distributions of the instantaneous distance between spot pairs are plotted . Box - and - whisker plots are as described in b . Distances shown are after chromatic aberration corrections . Note that the parS - PP7 ( green - red ) distance is significantly shorter when the parS tag is located at the 3 (cid:99) side of the PP7 reporter ( P = 4 . 5 × 10 – 6 , two - tailed Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) . d , Mean square displacement ( MSD ) plots for set A and set B . Each MSD trace is a result of the population ensemble of all nuclei in a single embryo ( embryo - averaged MSD ; Methods ) . Results from the two genomic settings display subdiffusive characteristics with a scaling power of ~ 0 . 24 , and their anomalous diffusion coefficients show no significant difference ( two - tailed Student’s t test , P = 0 . 87 , t = – 0 . 1534 , d . f . = 90 ; linear fits with mean ± s . d . across embryos ) . e – g , Transcriptional activation of eve - PP7 is not affected by labeling approach . The fraction of eve - MS2 - expressing nuclei that also contain active PP7 ( mean ± SE ) is plotted as a function of time for three genomic settings . It seems that neither the presence nor the location of the parS tag interferes with either enhancer action or transcriptional activation . This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ParB - DNA complex is formed from specific ParB - parS nucleation sites followed by stochastic binding and trapping . Supplementary Figure 5 Sustained physical proximity is required for transcription initiation and maintenance : individual traces . a , Transcriptional activity ( red spot ( PP7 ) intensity ) and instantaneous enhancer – promoter distance ( blue - green distance ) as a function of time for 286 nuclei transitioning from the Red - OFF to the Red - ON state . Time series for individual nuclei are aligned such that PP7 activity starts at 0 min ( red dashed lines ) . Individual traces are sorted according to the mean enhancer – promoter distance in the 5 min before PP7 activity is observed . b , Distribution of the instantaneous enhancer – promoter distance as a function of time for the Red - OFF to Red - ON transition . Calculated from a . c , Transcription and instantaneous enhancer – promoter distance as a function of time for 203 nuclei transitioning from the Red - ON to the Red - OFF state . Time series for individual nuclei are aligned such that PP7 activity ends at 0 min ( red dashed lines ) . Individual traces are sorted according to the mean enhancer – promoter distance in the 5 min before PP7 activity disappears . d , Distribution of the instantaneous enhancer – promoter distance as a function of time for the Red - ON to Red - OFF transition . Calculated from c . Supplementary Figure 6 Analysis of enhancer – promoter distance for individual embryos and individual nuclei . a – c , The time - averaged RMS distance between MS2 ( blue ) and parS ( green ) spots ( enhancer – promoter distance ) is depicted as a scatterplot for each nucleus from 84 embryos carrying the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct ( a ) , 29 embryos carrying the parS - homie - noPr - PP7 construct ( b ) , and 15 embryos carrying the parS - lambda - evePr - PP7 construct ( c ) located at – 142 kb with respect to the eve - MS2 locus . d , Time - averaged RMS enhancer – promoter distance for ten embryos carrying the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct at – 589 kb with respect to the eve - MS2 locus . Data points marked in red are calculated from the Red - ON part of enhancer – promoter trajectories in nuclei displaying PP7 activity . Data points marked with blue are calculated from full enhancer – promoter trajectories in nuclei that never show PP7 during the imaging time window ( 25 – 55 min in nc14 ) . Notice that the number of time points ( e . g . , length of enhancer – promoter trajectories ) used for calculating RMS distance varies among nuclei depending on the nuclear anterior – posterior position and the view of the image . e , RMS enhancer – promoter distance as a function of the length of the trajectories used for RMS distance calculation . All RMS enhancer – promoter distance samples from the 84 embryos carrying the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct at – 142 kb are shown . Supplementary Figure 7 Tuning stability of the homie element . a – d , The enhancer – promoter distance ( RMS distance ) distribution for four experimental constructs : parS - lambda - evePr - PP7 ( a ) , parS - homie ½ - evePr - PP7 ( b ) , parS - homie ¾ - evePr - PP7 ( c ) and parS - homie - evePr - PP7 ( d ) . A 5 - min sliding window along each time trace is used to calculate RMS enhancer – promoter distances . homie ½ ( chr2R : 9 , 988 , 934 – 9 , 988 , 750 , dm6 ) and homie ¾ ( chr2R : 9 , 989 , 025 – 9 , 988 , 750 , dm6 ) are two truncated homie elements . Red bars in c and d show the probability density of RMS distance samples accompanied by continuous PP7 transcription . e – h , Quantile – quantile plots against the standard normal distribution for the RMS enhancer – promoter distances shown in a – d , respectively . Short enhancer – promoter distances resulting from the paired ( P off and P on ) states are progressively enriched as the stability of the homie element increases . Insets show the complete quantile – quantile plots . i – l , Fraction of each topological state for the constructs shown in a – d , respectively . See Supplementary Fig . 8 and the Methods for details about topological state classification . Supplementary Figure 8 Training of a Bayesian classifier and characterization of the three topological states . a , An enhancer – promoter distance vector ( d x , y , z ) is calculated at each time point , corrected for chromatic aberration . b , The relative velocity ( v x , y , z ) between the enhancer ( blue MS2 spot ) and promoter ( green parS spot ) is calculated from the two consecutive distance vectors . The instantaneous distance vector and the two velocity vectors that connect the two adjacent time points are used for training a binary classifier using a naive Bayes method ( Methods ) . Two training samples are used . For the open state ( O state ) , enhancer – promoter trajectories from the parS - lambda - evePr - PP7 control are used . For the paired state ( P state ) , enhancer – promoter trajectories from the Red - ON part of nuclei displaying PP7 activity are used . The last 4 min of these Red - ON trajectories are removed from the training sample because of PolII elongation . c – f , Joint distribution of the selected dimensions of the distance vectors for the O state ( c , e ) and P state ( d , f ) training samples . g – j , Joint distribution of the selected dimensions of the velocity vectors for the O state ( g , i ) and P state ( h , j ) training samples . From c – j , z projections are raw data and the probability density functions of 2D Gaussian fits are shown . k , l , RMS distance ( k ) and fraction ( l ) for each topological state calculated for individual embryos ( n is the number of embryos ) . Supplementary Figure 9 A kinetic model captures transition rates among the three topological states . a , A series of first - order reactions are used to model the transition kinetics between the O off , P off and P on states . Based on the finding that physical proximity is required for transcriptional activation , we assume in this model that P on occurs only after P off is established . The coupled ODEs describe evolution of the system given the initial conditions . For parS - homie - noPr - PP7 , only the O off and P off states are present and we assume the same f 1 and b 1 values as for parS - homie - evePr - PP7 . b , Fraction of the P off state for homie - noPromoter - PP7 as a function of developmental time . 0 on the x axis corresponds to 25 min in nc14 . The mean ± SE is shown ( n = 29 embryos ) . This curve , together with time series curves obtained from the parS - homie - evePr - PP7 construct ( dashed lines ; same as in Fig . 3e ) , is used to infer the kinetic parameters with Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulations ( Methods ) . c – g , Marginal posterior distributions of the five kinetic parameters in a constructed from 90 , 000 stationary MCMC samples . Medians are labeled . Error bars span from the 25th - percentile to the 75th - percentile quantile ( also shown in square brackets ) . Insets in f and g show the joint distribution of ( b 1 , b 2 ) and ( b 1 , b 3 ) , respectively . Darker color represents higher density . h , The inferred parameters for the disappearance of P on recapitulate the distribution of lifespans of PP7 activity . To calculate PP7 lifespan distribution , PP7 traces are f 1 grouped into cohorts according to the maximum measurable lifespan for each trace ( Methods ) . For each PP7 cohort , a cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) for the PP7 lifespan is calculated ( gray curves ) . Because the lifespan distribution is truncated at the maximum measurable time , the tails of the CDFs ( corresponding to CDF = 1 ) are removed . The solid red line shows the median of these truncated CDFs , which is the CDF of the lifespans of PP7 activity . The dashed red curve comes from the CDF of an exponential distribution with mean = ( b 2 + b 3 ) – 1 = ( 0 . 014 + 0 . 011 ) – 1 min . This exponential CDF is shifted horizontally to account for a deterministic elongation time of 4 min , which coincides with the lifespan of the shortest PP7 trace . Supplementary Figure 10 Scoring mutant phenotypes resulting from promoter competition . a , Cross schemes to test the phenotypic effects of competition between the endogenous eve promoter and the ectopic eve promoter that is activated upon the formation of new topological states . Single males , either homie - evePr - lacZ or lambda - evePr - lacZ , are used for the crosses ( note removal of PP7 sequences ) . For each single cross , the patterning phenotypes in adult abdominal segments A4 , A6 and / or A8 are scored . No conspicuous phenotype in other abdominal segments is noticed . b – f , The adult abdominal phenotypes most likely result from haploinsufficiency of eve , as shown in the cuticles derived from a cross between homozygous homie - evePr - lacZ males and Df ( 2R ) eve - / CyO females . A wild - type cuticle is shown in b . Strong eve phenotypes , i . e . , loss or perturbation of denticle bands in the even - numbered abdominal segments , are observed ( c – f ) .
