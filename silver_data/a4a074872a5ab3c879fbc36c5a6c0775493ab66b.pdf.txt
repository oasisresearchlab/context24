INTRODUCTION Numerous macromolecules such as growth factors or lipopro - teins bound to speciﬁc receptors at the cell surface are inter - nalized by the cell via endocytosis . Initially , macromolecules are internalized into early endosomes and from there they are either recycled to the plasma membrane via tubular extensions or became concentrated within the vesicular main body of the sorting endosomes before being routed towards lysosomes ( Dunn and Maxﬁeld , 1992 ; Hopkins et al . , 1990 ; Ghosh et al . , 1994 ) . Several lines of evidence argue for a role for the cortical actin network in the endocytic process . Sako and Kusumi ( 1994 ) , using video - enhanced contrast optical microscopy , have reported that transferrin and a2 - macroglobulin bound to their receptors interact directly or indirectly with actin ﬁlaments below the cell surface . Although several attempts failed to demonstrate a role for the actin ﬁlaments in the endo - cytosis of transferrin , two recent studies have suggested a role for actin ﬁlaments in the clathrin dependent endocytosis of the a - factor in yeast and the inﬂuenza virus at the apical domain of MDCK ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Evidences also suggested a role for microtubules in endocyto - sis . Microtubules are required in ﬁbroblastic cells to maintain the cellular distribution of late endosomes in the vicinity of the microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) , as well as lysosomes ( Matteoni and Kreis , 1987 ) . In addition they increase the rate of the delivery of ligands to the degradative compartments ( EGF and asialoglycoproteins or the transmembrane proteins G of the VSV ; Oka , 1983 ; Berg et al . , 1985 ; Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ; Brown et al . , 1980 ) . Although these studies clearly indicate the participation of both microtubules and microﬁlaments in endocytosis , they do not address the respective contribution of these two types of ﬁlaments along the pathway to the lysosomes and the recycling pathway . In the present study we have investigated the role for both ﬁlaments in the endocytosis of two ligands internalized via clathrin coated pits in a mouse hepatoma cell line ( BWTG3 ) . The ﬁrst , transferrin , is recycled to the plasma membrane from endosomes located at the cell periphery and in some cells from endosomes located in the juxtanuclear area ( Hopkins , 1983 ; Hopkins et al . , 1994 ) . In contrast , the second , a2 - macroglobulin dissociates from its receptor at low pH in the endosomes and is transferred to lysosomes where it is degraded ( Tycko and Maxﬁeld , 1982 ) . By immunocytochemical analysis with confocal microscopy , and kinetic analysis , we have shown that actin ﬁlaments are involved in 2 steps of the degradative pathway , and that microtubules are required at a stage in between those which involve actin ﬁlaments . Actin ﬁlaments increase the uptake of ligands and their delivery to the degradative compartment , whereas microtubules are required to maintain the distribu - tion of the late endocytic compartment in its juxtanuclear position and facilitate the delivery of the ligands to the degradative compartment upstream of the actin ﬁlament requirement . 457 Journal of Cell Science 109 , 457 - 465 ( 1996 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1996 JCS3292 Recent reports have suggested a role for microtubules in the endocytic process and pointed out the role for actin ﬁlaments for the early steps of apical endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells . However , these studies do not address the respective contribution of these two types of ﬁlaments along the endocytic pathway . In addition , several studies failed to demonstrate the role for actin ﬁlaments in clathrin dependent endocytosis in non polarized cells . In the present study we have investigated the role for both ﬁlaments in the endocytosis of two ligands internalized via clathrin coated pits ( transferrin and a 2 - macroglobulin ) in a mouse hepatoma cell line . By immunocytochemical analysis with confocal microscopy , and biochemical analysis using a temperature sensitive step at 18°C , we have shown that actin ﬁlaments are involved in two steps of the degradative pathway , and that microtubules are required at a stage in between . Actin ﬁlaments increase ﬁrst , the uptake of ligands and second , their delivery to the degrada - tive compartment , whereas microtubules are required to maintain the distribution of the late endocytic compart - ment in its juxtanuclear position and facilitate the delivery of the ligands to the degradative compartment upstream of the actin ﬁlament requirement . Furthermore actin ﬁlaments facilitate the recycling of transferrin from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane . Our data indicate for the ﬁrst time the sequential involvement of actin ﬁlaments and microtubules along one intracellular membrane trafficking pathway .

Micro - ﬁlaments were depolymerized by incubating cells with 1 m M of cytochalasin D in culture medium for 30 minutes at 37°C prior to the experiment . Microtubules were depolymerized by incubating cells with 30 m M of colchicine in culture medium for 5 minutes at 4°C and 30 minutes at 37°C prior to the experiment . Both drugs were main - tained throughout the experiment . Antibodies The monoclonal antibody directed against a - tubulin ( N 356 ) was purchased from Amersham and mouse monoclonal antibody against the lysosomal transmembrane glycoprotein lgp110 was a generous gift from Prof . I . Mellman ( Yale University New Haven , USA ) . Cell culture The mouse hepatoma cell line BWTG3 previously characterized by Szpirer and Szpirer ( 1975 ) was obtained from Dr Weiss ( Institut Pasteur , Paris France ) . BWTG3 cells were grown at 37°C under 10 % CO 2 , in Coon’s F12 modiﬁed medium ( Seromed T085 - 05 ) supple - mented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Seromed ; S 0115 ) and penicillin ( 10 U / ml ) / streptomycin ( 10 mg / ml ) ( Seromed A2213 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy For immunoﬂuorescence analysis cells were grown for 2 days on coverslips , ﬁxed with 3 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with phosphate - buffered saline containing 0 . 01 % saponin and analyzed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence . Staining was performed by two sequen - tial incubation steps . Cells were ﬁrst incubated with puriﬁed IgG in the case of monoclonal antibodies or affinity - puriﬁed antibodies in the case of polyclonal antibodies at a concentration of 10 m g / ml . They were secondly labeled with ﬂuorescent anti - IgG antibodies , conju - gated to either lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride ( Molecular probes ) or dichlorotriazinyl amino ﬂuorescein ( DTAF ) ( Research Inorganic ) according to the method of Brandzaeg ( 1973 ) . Fluorescent phalloidin conjugated to either rhodamine ( Sigma P 5157 ) or ﬂuor - escein ( Sigma P 5282 ) , at 2 U per dish was used to label F actin . Acridine orange ( 2 mM ; Sigma A - 6014 ) in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco 041 - 02402 M ) was incubated with cells for 30 minutes in order to label the acidic compartment . After four washes with cold phosphate - buffered saline cells were immediately analyzed . Cells were viewed with an Axiophot microscope ( Zeiss ) , or a confocal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM , Leica ) depending on the experiment . Fluorescent coupled human a 2 - macroglobulin and human transferrin Iron - loaded human apo transferrin ( Sigma T2252 ) and a 2 - macroglob - ulin ( Sigma M7151 ) were coupled either with DTAF or lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride as previously described ( Maxﬁeld et al . , 1978 ) . Conjugated proteins were separated from free ﬂuoro - chromes by Sephadex G50 gel ﬁltration in phosphate buffered saline . The speciﬁc binding of the coupled proteins to the cell surface receptors was determined by competition experiments using a 100 - fold higher concentration of non coupled proteins . Iodination of human a 2 - macroglobulin and transferrin Human a2 - macroglobulin and human transferrin loaded with iron ( Ciechanover et al . , 1983 ) were iodinated using chloramine T ( Sigma C 9887 ) as described by Mosher et al . ( 1977 ) . After iodination , more than 95 % of the radioactivity was precipitable by 10 % trichloroacetic acid . The speciﬁc activity was 0 . 43 mCi / mg for a2 - macroglobulin and 0 . 66 mCi / mg for transferrin . The speciﬁcity of binding of radiolabeled proteins was determined by competition with non labeled ligand ; 100 - fold concentrations of non labeled ligand reduced the binding of radiolabeled ligand at 4°C by more than 80 % . Ligand internalization , kinetic of uptake and kinetic of degradation Cells ( 10 6 / 3 . 5 cm 2 ) grown for two days on coverslips or in wells were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg / ml of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , and incubated twice for 15 minutes in the same medium at 37°C . Then ﬂuorescent ( 1 ) or radiolabeled ( 2 ) ligands were internalized according to the following conditions : ( 1 ) cells were incubated for 30 minutes with DTAF - a2 - macroglobulin ( 20 m g / ml ) and / or rhodamine - transferrin ( 100 nM ) in RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg / ml BSA at 37°C or 18°C . Unbound ﬂuorescent ligand was removed by three washes with cold phosphate - buffered saline and cells were ﬁxed directly , or incubated with prewarmed RPMI 1640 during speciﬁed times and before being ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde . ( 2 ) For ligand uptake , cells were incubated for 15 minutes in a precooled medium at 4°C and for 1 hour in precooled medium con - taining iodinated a2 - macroglobulin ( 10 m g / ml ) or transferrin ( 100 m M ) . Cells were then rinsed 6 times with cold phosphate - buffered saline containing 0 . 5 mM calcium chloride and 0 . 5 mM magnesium chloride and the radiolabeled ligand replaced by unlabeled ligand ; a2 - macroglobulin ( 10 m g / ml ) or transferrin ( 100 nM ) . Bound radio - labeled ligand was internalized for selected intervals at 37°C . Following these incubations , medium containing the released ligand was collected and cells rapidly chilled to arrest ligand movement . Residual cell surface bound ligand was stripped by treating cells for 2 minutes with 1 volume of cold RPMI 1640 , pH 2 . 8 , followed by 2 volumes of cold RPMI 1640 , pH 9 , for one minute . The intracellular labeled ligand was recovered in cells lysed with 0 . 8 % of Triton X - 100 . The total amount of ligand was determined by adding radioac - tivity in the medium containing the released ligand , the medium con - taining the cell surface bound ligand and the cell lysate . Internalized ligand was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of ligand . To follow transferrin recycling , radiolabeled transferrin ( 100 m M ) was internalized for 30 minutes at 37°C . Then cells were rinsed 6 times with cold phosphate - buffered saline containing 0 . 5 mM calcium chloride and 0 . 5 mM magnesium chloride , and the residual cell surface bound ligand was stripped at low pH as described above . Cells were then incubated at 37°C in RPMI 1640 containing unlabeled ligand ( 100 nM ) . At selected intervals , medium containing the released ligand was collected . At the end of the experiment , cells were lysed as described above . Recycled transferrin was expressed as a per - centage of the total amount of endocytosed ligand . To determine the kinetics of a2 - macroglobulin degradation , radio - labeled a2 - macroglobulin was internalized as described for the trans - ferrin recycling experiment without acidic treatment . The medium containing the released ligand was precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) , and the amount of a2 - macroglobulin degraded was collected in the soluble TCA fraction . No radioactivity was detected in the TCA soluble fraction obtained from the cell lysate . The cell associated and the supernatant trichloracetic acid precipitable and non precipitable radioactivity were determined with a g counter . The amount of radioactivity contained in the TCA soluble fraction corresponding to the degraded a2 - macroglobulin was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of endocytosed a2 - macroglobulin . RESULTS The distribution of internalized transferrin and a 2 - macroglobulin at one pole of the nucleus requires intact microﬁlaments and microtubules To study the role for actin ﬁlaments and microtubules along the endocytic pathway , BWTG3 cells , derived from a mouse A . Durrbach , D . Louvard and E . Coudrier 459 Actin ﬁlaments facilitate two steps of endocytosis hepatoma cell line , were treated with cytochalasin D ( 1 m M ) , or colchicine ( 30 m M ) prior to the internalization of transfer - rin and / or a2 - macroglobulin . The distribution of endocytosed ligands , analyzed by confocal laser microscopy ( CLSM ) , showed that within 5 minutes ligands were mainly internalized in early endosomes located at the cell periphery . In cells treated with cytochalasin D or colchicine the distribution of the ligands was unchanged ( data not shown ) . After 30 minutes of inter - nalization , transferrin and a2 - macroglobulin were predomi - nantly distributed at one pole of the nucleus as previously observed ( Matteoni and Kreis , 1987 ; Hopkins , 1983 ; Hopkins et al . , 1994 ) ( Fig . 1A , B , C ) . In contrast , when cells have been treated with colchicine or cytochalasin D prior to endocytosis , transferrin and a2 - macroglobulin were no longer concentrated in a juxtanuclear position but rather dispersed throughout the cytoplasm indicating that both microtubules and actin ﬁlaments affect the distribution of internalized ligands in this region ( Fig . 1D , E , F and G , H , I ) . At the concentrations used , both drugs did not affect the cell shape or cell spreading ( Fig . 1C , F , I ) . We also checked that cytochalasin D did not affect the organization of microtubules at these concentrations ( as judged by immunoﬂuorescent staining with antibody directed against a - tubulin ) , and that colchicine did not affect the organization of microﬁlaments ( data not shown ) . We have observed that a2 - macroglobulin and transferrin internalized at 18°C were clustered in the juxtanuclear region ( Fig . 2A and E ) . In this region the sorting endosomes and some of the recycling endosomes are found ( Salzman and Maxﬁeld , 1989 ; Hopkins et al . , 1994 ) . Both ligands were redistributed throughout the cytoplasm when cells were warmed up at 37°C suggesting that a2 - macroglobulin moves on along the endocytic pathway to reach lysosomes whereas transferrin recycles ( Fig . 2A versus B , and E versus F ) . Indeed lysosomes were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of the hepatoma cell line ( see Fig . 4 ) . The redistribution of the two ligands also occurred when microtubules were depolymerized before warming cells to 37°C ( Fig . 2D , H ) . In contrast , when micro - ﬁlaments were depolymerized it was inhibited suggesting that microﬁlaments facilitate the exit of the ligands from the jux - tanuclear compartments ( Fig . 2C , G ) . Microtubules but not microﬁlaments are required to maintain distribution of the acidic compartment The endocytic compartments are acidic and with the exception of the early endosomes they can be labeled with acridine orange . In non treated cells and cells treated with cytochalasin D the acidic compartment labeled with acridine orange formed a juxtanuclear ‘cap’ with a few vesicular proﬁles ( Fig . 3A , B ) . In contrast , when microtubules were depolymerized with colchicine , this compartment became fragmented and Fig . 1 . Effect of cytochalasin D and colchicine on the distribution of internalized transferrin and a2 - macroglobulin over 30 minutes . The distribution of rhodamine - conjugated a2 - macroglobulin ( A , D , G ) and DTAF - conjugated transferrin ( B , E , H ) , simultaneously internalized for 30 minutes at 37°C , was analyzed by CLSM on optical sections of 0 . 5 m m through the nucleus in non treated cells ( A , B , C ) , cells treated with cytochalasin D ( D , E , F ) , or with colchicine ( G , H , I ) . Micrographs ( C , F , I ) show the shape of corresponding cells analyzed by reﬂection with the CLSM . Note that ligands are concentrated in the vicinity of the nucleus in non treated cells whereas they are more dispersed in cells treated with cytochalasin D or colchicine .

Durrbach , D . Louvard and E . Coudrier Fig . 2 . Intracellular distribution of a2 - macroglobulin and transferrin accumulated at 18°C and chased at 37°C is affected by cytochalasin D treatment . DTAF - conjugated transferrin ( A , B , C , D ) and rhodamine - conjugated a2 - macroglobulin ( E , F , G , H ) were internalized in separate experiments for 30 minutes at 18°C , chased for 10 minutes at 18°C in order to be accumulated in the juxtanuclear compartment and 20 minutes at 18°C without treatment or in the presence of cytochalasin D or colchicine . Then cells were chased for 30 minutes at 18°C ( A , E ) or 37°C without treatment ( B , F ) or in the presence of cytochalasin D ( C , G ) or colchicine ( D , H ) . The intracellular distribution of a2 - macroglobulin and transferrin was analyzed by CLSM after paraformaldehyde ﬁxation at 4°C . The ligands remained in the juxtanuclear location in cells kept at 18°C ( A , E ) or at 37°C in the presence of cytochalasin D ( C , G ) , whereas they were scattered throughout the cytoplasm in non treated cells chased at 37°C ( B , F ) or cells treated with colchicine and chased at 37°C ( D , H ) Bar , 10 m m . Fig . 3 . Effect of colchicine and cytochalasin D on the distribution of the acidic compartment . The acidic compartment was visualized in non treated cells ( A ) , cells treated with cytochalasin D ( B ) , or colchicine ( C ) by labeling them with acridine orange . Some punctate structures dispersed throughout the cytoplasm , were also observed . However , the rapid fading of this vital staining and the low ﬂuorescent intensity of the punctate structures compare to the juxtanuclear staining make these structures hardly visible on the photographs . Bar , 4 m m . 461 Actin ﬁlaments facilitate two steps of endocytosis using a speciﬁc antibody directed against a transmembrane gly - coprotein , lgp 110 . The punctate structures , stained with anti - bodies directed against lgp 110 were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and in membrane extensions such as lamellipodia in both non treated cells and cells treated with cytochalasin D , however , they were dispersed to a lesser extent in cells treated with colchicine ( Fig . 4A , C , E ) . They were not detected in membrane extensions in these last conditions . Surprisingly the punctate structures seemed to be accumulated together with actin ﬁlaments in lamellipodia of non treated cells doubly stained with phalloidin and antibodies directed against lgp110 ( Fig . 4A versus B ) . Furthermore in cells treated with cyto - chalasin D these structures were codistributed with collapsed actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 4C versus D ) . The distribution of cathepsin D , a lysosomal hydrolase concentrated mainly into lysosomes , was similar to the distribution of lgp110 in control cells and similarly affected in cells treated by both drugs ( data not shown ) . Microﬁlaments but not microtubules facilitate the cellular uptake of transferrin and a 2 - macroglobulin The dispersion of the internalized ligands , in the absence of microtubules or microﬁlaments might correspond either to a delay for the transport of the ligands from the cell surface to the endocytic compartment located in the cell center or to a disorganization of late endocytic compartments . To decide between these two possibilities we compared the kinetic uptake of the two ligands in the presence and in the absence of actin ﬁlaments and / or microtubules . The kinetics of transferrin uptake was similar in untreated cells and cells treated with colchicine but was delayed with a lag time of 2 minutes in cells treated with cytochalasin D ( Fig . 5A ) . The mean half - life for transferrin uptake was 2 minutes in control cells and cells treated with colchicine and 4 minutes in cells treated with cytochalasin D . The maximal amount of internalized transferrin was decreased in cells treated with cytochalasin D . Furthermore cytochalasin D treatment increased up to 30 . 1±4 . 4 % ( n = 11 ) the amount of transferrin bound at the cell surface ( and up to 40 % the number of trans - ferrin receptors ) but did not modify the affinity constant of transferrin for its receptor . Transferrin uptake in Hep - 2 cells was also delayed when actin ﬁlaments were depolymerized by cytochalasin D ( Fig . 5C ) . Similar results were obtained with BHK cells ( data not Fig . 4 . Effect of colchicine and cytochalasin D on the distribution of lysosomes . Cells were double labeled with a monoclonal antibody directed against lgp 110 , a lysosomal transmembrane glycoprotein ( A , C , E ) , and rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( B , D , F ) . Lysosomes were scattered throughout the cytoplasm in non treated cells ( A , B ) , cells treated with cytochalasin D ( C , D ) or with colchicine ( E , F ) . They were detected in lamellipodia of non treated cells ( A , B ; small arrows ) but not in cells treated with colchicine . They were codistributed with collapsed actin ﬁlaments in cells treated with cytochalasin D ( C , D ; see arrows ) . Bar , 2 m m . 462 shown ) indicating that these effects were not restricted to the hepatoma cell line . After internalization , transferrin is recycled from endosomes to the plasma membrane . As it has been pre - viously reported , most of internalized transferrin was recycled within 20 minutes ( Fig . 5D ) . Depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments did not affect these kinetics ( Fig . 5D ) . The kinetics of a2 - macroglobulin uptake , similar to that of transferrin , is delayed with a lag time of 2 minutes when actin ﬁlaments were depolymerized and with a lag time of 1 minute when microtubules were depolymerized ( Fig . 5B ) . The amount of a2 - macroglobulin bound to the cell surface is also increased up to 30 % when the cells were treated with cytochalasin D . Altogether , these results indicated that the depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments impaired the ﬁrst step of ligand internalization and lead to its accumulation at the cell surface . Microﬁlaments and microtubules are both required for the delivery of a 2 - macroglobulin to the degradative compartment We next examined whether actin ﬁlaments or microtubules could participate in movement along the degradative pathway by following the degradation of internalized radiolabeled a2 - macroglobulin . The percentage of degraded a2 - macroglobulin over the total amount internalized after 30 minutes of inter - nalization and 40 minutes of chase decreased from 35 % in non treated cells , to 27 % in cells treated with colchicine , 15 % in cells treated with cytochalasin D and 15 % in cells treated with cytochalasin D and colchicine ( Fig . 6A ) . The degradation of a2 - macroglobulin was signiﬁcantly inhibited up to 22 % in cells treated with colchicine ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 0075 ) , and 55 % in cells treated with cytochalasin D ( n = 3 ; P < 0 . 003 ) or with cyto - chalasin D and colchicine ( n = 2 ; P < 0 . 02 ) ( Fig . 6B ) . These results indicate that both actin ﬁlaments and microtubules facilitate the delivery of a2 - macroglobulin to the degradative pathway . Actin ﬁlaments and microtubules act in sequence in the delivery of a 2 - macroglobulin to the degradative compartment Since cytochalasin D and colchicine do not have a cumulative effect on a2 - macroglobulin degradation the two types of ﬁlaments might be required stepwise for the delivery of the A .

Then after treating or not the cells with cytochalasin D , transferrin released in the supernatant was determined at selected intervals and normalized to the total internalized transferrin ( n = 2 ) . 463 Actin ﬁlaments facilitate two steps of endocytosis ligand to the degradative compartment . To determine at which step of the degradative pathway actin ﬁlaments and micro - tubules might be involved , we took advantage of the tempera - ture sensitive block at 18°C . It has been demonstrated that at 18°C , endocytosed ligands are accumulated in the late endocytic compartment and are not degraded ( Dunn et al . , 1980 ; Salzman and Maxﬁeld , 1989 ) . This block is reversible and ligands are delivered to the degradative compartment when cells are warmed up at 37°C . We examined whether actin ﬁlaments or microtubules are required to deliver a2 - macroglobulin accumulated in the jux - tanuclear compartment at 18°C ( see above , Fig . 1 and Fig . 2 ) , in the degradative compartment . Radiolabeled a2 - macroglob - ulin was internalized at 18°C and after depolymerization of microﬁlaments or microtubules chased at 37°C . Only 10 % of the radiolabeled a2 - macroglobulin internalized and main - tained for 1 hour at 18°C was degraded when microﬁlaments and microtubules remained intact ( Fig . 7 ) whereas lysosomal enzymes were still active at this temperature ( data not shown ) . The percentage of a2 - macroglobulin that was degraded increased 3 - fold in non treated cells as well as in cells treated with colchicine when a2 - macroglobulin was internalized for 30 minutes at 18°C , then chased for 30 minutes at 18°C prior to being chased for 90 minutes at 37°C . In contrast , the per - centage of degraded a2 - macroglobulin in cells treated with cytochalasin D was similar to the percentage measured in non treated cells loaded and chased at 18°C ( Fig . 7 ) . These results indicated that the integrity of microﬁlaments for the delivery of ligands to lysosomes was required downstream of the jux - tanuclear compartment . 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time ( min ) a - 2 - M a cr og l o bu li n d e g r a d e d ( % ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 A 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 AAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA Time ( i ) I nh i b i t i o n o f a - 2 - M a cr og l o bu li n d e g r a d a t i o n ( % ) 40 90 B Fig . 6 .

Then , cells were rinsed free of ligands and reincubated at 37°C for speciﬁed times in the presence or not of cytochalasin D , colchicine or both drugs , similar to the treatment received before .

Effect of cytochalasin D and colchicine on the degradation of a2 - macroglobulin when the ligand was ﬁrst internalized at 18°C and then chased at 37°C to the degradative compartment . 125 I - a2 - macroglobulin was internalized for 30 minutes at 18°C , chased for 10 minutes at 18°C in order to be accumulated in the late endocytic compartment and 20 minutes at 18°C without treatment or in the presence of cytochalasin D or colchicine . Then cells were kept at 18°C ( (cid:100) ) or were chased at 37°C without any drugs ( (cid:106) ) or in the presence of cytochalasin D ( (cid:114) ) or colchicine ( (cid:109) ) similar to the previous treatment . Degraded a2 - macroglobulin corresponding to the radioactivity determined in the soluble TCA fraction was normalized to the total amount of 125 I - a2 - macroglobulin internalized at time 0 and expressed as a function of the chase times ( mean ± standard deviation ) . In non treated cells or cells treated with colchicine , chased at 37°C , the percentage of 125 I - a2 - macroglobulin degraded increased signiﬁcantly as compared to cells kept at 18°C ( P < 0 . 006 , n = 3 ; P < 0 . 02 , n = 2 , respectively , paired Student’s t - test ) . In contrast , the increased percentage of a2 - macroglobulin degradation is signiﬁcantly inhibited in cells treated with cytochalasin D ( P < 0 . 006 , n = 3 , paired Student’s t - test ) . Time ( min ) 464 DISCUSSION What is the functional signiﬁcance of the involvement of actin ﬁlaments in the uptake of ligands ? We have shown that the depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments with cytochalasin D delayed the uptake of the two ligands and lead to their accumulation at the cell surface . This effect was similar in two other cell types ( BHK , HEp - 2 ) indicating a general involvement of actin ﬁlaments in the ﬁrst step of receptor mediated endocytosis . Although it is well established that depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments inhibits patching of ligand - receptor complexes at the cell surface , more recent work failed to demonstrate a role for the actin ﬁlaments in an early step in the endocytosis of ligands such as transferrin in mammalian cells ( Salisbury et al . , 1980 ; Wolkoff et al . , 1984 ; Sandvig and Van Deurs , 1990 ) . In one of these reports cytocha - lasin B instead of cytochalasin D ( which is less efficient ) was used whereas in the other the kinetics of transferrin uptake was not distinguished from its binding to the cell surface . In contrast , in our experiments the ligands were ﬁrst bound at the cell surface at 4°C prior to determining the kinetics of their uptake at 37°C . The different experimental conditions might explain the discrepancy between our observations and these earlier studies . Indeed Ciechanover et al . ( 1983 ) have shown that the half - life of the binding of the transferrin to the cell surface is twofold longer than the half - life of its uptake indi - cating that the binding of the ligand to the cell surface can be a rate limiting step . We cannot rule out that disorganization of the cortical actin network by cytochalasin D has an indirect effect on the early steps of endocytosis . However , the accumulation of transferrin receptors at the surface of cells treated with cytochalasin D is consistent with the data of Sako and Kusumi ( 1994 ) , proposing that transferrin and a2 - macroglobulin receptors at the cell surface could interact directly or indirectly with cytoskeleton components , and those of Gottlieb et al . ( 1993 ) and Kubler and Riezman ( 1993 ) showing an accumulation of coated pits when actin ﬁlaments are depolymerized . Altogether they strongly suggest a model in which actin ﬁlaments participate in the formation of early endosomes . Three steps at least lead to the formation of this organelle , the two last steps occurring also in clathrin independent endocytosis ( Watts and Marsh , 1992 ) , as follows : ( 1 ) the capping of ligand receptor together with the recruitment of clathrin lattice ; ( 2 ) the invagination of the membrane into a constricted pit ; ( 3 ) the severing of the neck of the invaginated membrane to form a vesicle . According to Takei et al . ( 1995 ) and Hinshaw and Schmid ( 1995 ) dynamin participates in the ﬁssion of the vesicles in a clathrin dependent or independent fashion . Actin ﬁlaments together with speciﬁc actin binding proteins could participate in the clustering of ligands and / or membrane invagination whereas dynamin could participate in the severing of the membrane invagination . The observation of cortical actin patches associated with the cell surface invaginations of the plasma membrane and the inhibi - tion of the a factor uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae when Sec 6 ( an actin binding protein homologous to ﬁmbrin ) was deleted support this hypothesis ( Mulholand et al . , 1994 ; Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Alternatively dynamin and actin could both participate in a complex molecular mechanism leading to membrane invagination and severing of the newly formed invagination . Actin ﬁlaments and microtubules are involved stepwise in membrane trafficking along the degradative pathway Depolymerization of microtubules in the hepatoma cell line BWTG3 impaired the distribution of internalized ligands in the juxtanuclear area , the redistribution of the acidic compartment and to some extent lysosomes since we have not detected lgp110 associated structures in lamellipodia of cells treated with colchicine . Depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments also impairs the distribution of the ligands in the juxtanuclear area but does not seem to affect the distribution of the acidic com - partment . In addition depolymerization of the microtubules and actin ﬁlaments inhibits the degradation of endocytosed a2 - macroglobulin . However , the depolymerization of micro - tubules affects the delivery of the ligands upstream of the tem - perature sensitive block at 18°C whereas actin ﬁlaments are required downstream of the temperature sensitive block . Thus our data are consistent with a possible role for microtubules in the transport of ligands within the endosomal compartment , and actin ﬁlaments between endosomes and lysosomes . They are in agreement with in vitro experiments demonstrating that microtubules and dynein increase fusion events between endosomes ( Aniento et al . , 1993 ) but do not affect fusion events between endosomes and lysosomes ( Mullock et al . , 1994 ) . The mechanism by which microtubules and dynein facil - itate in vivo the transport of the ligands through the endosomal compartment is presently unclear . As proposed by Aniento et al . ( 1993 ) , they may facilitate the rate of vesicular traffic , alter - natively they may facilitate the rate of endosomes maturation , and / or stabilize their structure according to the model proposed by Mayor et al . ( 1993 ) and Stoorvogel et al . ( 1991 ) . The enrichment of lysosomes together with actin ﬁlaments in membrane extensions and their co distribution with collapsed actin ﬁlaments after cytochalasin D treatment also support our hypothesis although we cannot rule out the alter - native possibility that actin ﬁlaments participate in the bio - genesis of the lysosomes . However , the observations of Van Deurs et al . ( 1995 ) rather favour our hypothesis . They have shown that depolymerization of microﬁlaments leads to the accumulation of ﬂuid phase markers in multivesicular bodies which are devoid of lysosomal markers and also decreases the degradation and the delivery of ricin internalized via non coated pits in these structures . According to Hopkins et al . ( 1994 ) and Ghosh et al . ( 1994 ) , transferrin accumulated in the pericentriolar area is sorted from the degradative compartment and recycled back to the plasma membrane . The inhibition by cytochalasin D of the dispersion of the transferrin accumulated in the perinuclear area would be consistent with the requirement of actin ﬁlaments to sort the recycled ligands from the degradative pathway . Semi quanti - tative electron microscopic studies from Hopkins et al . ( 1994 ) have indicated that the separation between the recycled ligands and ligands routed to the degradative pathway occurs within tubules . Thus an attractive hypothesis would be that actin ﬁlaments might be required , to form these tubules and / or to cluster ligands in these tubules and consequently facilitate the sorting of recycled ligands from ligands delivered to the degradative compartment . A . Durrbach , D . Louvard and E . Coudrier 465 Actin ﬁlaments facilitate two steps of endocytosis In conclusion we have provided morphological and kinetic evidences to support the proposal that actin ﬁlaments facilitate the uptake of ligands internalized via coated pits , and the sorting of recycled ligands concentrated in the perinuclear area from the degradative pathway . Are actin ﬁlaments involved in a similar molecular mechanism in both steps ? The identiﬁca - tion of the actin binding proteins involved in these two steps may provide an answer . In this respect myosin Is which have been shown to interact between membrane domains and actin ﬁlaments are good candidates for acting in association with actin to exert tension on membrane domain in order to elongate or invaginate membrane domains . In addition our data indicate for the ﬁrst time the sequential involvement of actin ﬁlaments and microtubules along one intracellular membrane trafficking pathway . The identiﬁcation of the two types of motor proteins associated either with microtubules or actin on the same endosome as predicted by the in vitro experiment of Kuznetsov et al . ( 1992 ) raises important questions about the strict regu - lation of these motors proteins . We thank R . Hellio for his contribution and helpful advice for confocal microscopy and Dr M .
