Influenza Viruses Select Ordered Lipid Domains during Budding from the Plasma Membrane * ( Received for publication , September 11 , 1998 , and in revised form , October 30 , 1998 ) Peter Scheiffele , Anton Rietveld , Thomas Wilk‡ , and Kai Simons § From the Cell Biology Programme ‡ Structural Biology Programme , European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Postfach 10 2209 , D - 69012 Heidelberg , Germany and Max - Planck - Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden 01307 , Germany During the budding of enveloped viruses from the plasma membrane , the lipids are not randomly incorpo - rated into the envelope , but virions seem to have a lipid composition different from the host membrane . Here , we have analyzed lipid assemblies in three different viruses : fowl plague virus ( FPV ) from the influenza vi - rus family , vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , and Semliki Forest virus ( SFV ) . Analysis of detergent extractability of proteins , cholesterol , phosphoglycerolipids , and sphingomyelin in virions showed that FPV contains high amounts of detergent - insoluble complexes , whereas such complexes are largely absent from VSV or SFV . Cholesterol depletion from the viral envelope by methyl - b - cyclodextrin results in increased solubility of sphingomyelin and of the glycoproteins in the FPV en - velope . This biochemical behavior suggests that so - called raft - lipid domains are selectively incorporated into the influenza virus envelope . The “fluidity” of the FPV envelope , as measured by the fluorescence polar - ization of diphenylhexatriene , was significantly lower than compared with VSV or SFV . Furthermore , influ - enza virus hemagglutinin incorporated into the enve - lope of recombinant VSV was largely detergent - soluble , indicating the depletion of raft - lipid assemblies from this membrane . The results provide a model for lipid selectivity during virus budding and support the view of lipid rafts as cholesterol - dependent , ordered domains in biological membranes . The hypothesis that lipids from the plasma membrane are not randomly included into the viral envelope , but that budding could occur from specialized domains of the membrane , was put forward several years ago ( 1 , 2 ) . Comparing the lipid composi - tion of various viruses with the composition of the host cell membrane , clear cut differences have been reported , although caution has to be exercised because viruses can be isolated practically pure , whereas plasma membrane fractions cannot be ( 2 – 4 ) . Thus , the role of lipid domains has remained contro - versial and has not so far been given functional significance . New insights into the mechanisms of domain formation in biological membranes have come from the analysis of deter - gent - resistant membrane fractions ( 5 ) . Recent evidence sug - gests that laterally associating sphingolipids and cholesterol form small ordered domains , called rafts , which are resistant to extraction with Triton X - 100 at 4 °C . These domains can incor - porate specific proteins and function as platforms for intracel - lular sorting and signal transduction events ( 6 , 7 ) . Recently , the concentration of GPI 1 - anchored proteins in microdomains has been confirmed in living cells by biophysical and biochem - ical methods without the use of detergents ( 8 , 9 ) . However , when GPI - anchored proteins on the apical surface of epithelial cells were analyzed , no such concentration could be observed ( 10 ) . The reason for this discrepancy is not known , yet one explanation could be that this membrane represents a contin - uous raft domain in contrast to the plasma membrane of non - polarized cells , where raft domains would be noncontinuous ( 6 , 10 , 11 ) . Recent studies have shown that cholesterol promotes the detergent insolubility of GPI - anchored proteins or trans - membrane proteins both in cellular membranes and in artifi - cial lipid vesicles ( 12 – 15 ) . Lipids recovered in detergent - insol - uble glycolipid - enriched complexes ( DIGs ) were shown to have higher melting temperatures than the average lipids from the plasma membrane , suggesting that raft - domains might be formed from lipids with preferentially saturated acyl chains ( 16 ) . Interestingly , for artificial lipid vesicles detergent insolu - bility could be correlated with the formation of a liquid - ordered phase in the membrane ( 15 , 17 ) , suggesting that phase sepa - ration might be the basis for the formation of insoluble lipid rafts in biological membranes ( 7 , 18 ) . Also , specific viral glycoproteins have been described to be associated with raft domains during transport to the cell sur - face . Both the influenza virus neuraminidase and hemaggluti - nin are recovered in DIGs after entering the Golgi complex ( 19 , 20 ) . Efficient surface transport of influenza virus HA requires cholesterol , and the protein stays raft - associated at the plasma membrane ( 14 , 21 ) . Here we used membranes of baby hamster kidney ( BHK ) cells and the viral envelopes of influenza fowl plague virus ( FPV ) , vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , and Semliki Forest virus ( SFV ) as model systems to analyze the formation of detergent - resistant lipid domains in a biological membrane . Our results demonstrate that the viruses contain lipid raft assemblies to a very different extent . Furthermore , we show that in all of the membranes analyzed cholesterol is required for the formation of detergent - insoluble lipid complexes and that such complexes are highly ordered .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture , Virus Stocks— BHK cells ( strain CCL10 , American Cul - ture Collection ) were maintained in G - MEM ( 5 % FCS , 10 % tryptose - phosphate 10 m M Hepes , 2 m M glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin ) in 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator . Virus stocks of influenza virus ( strain A / FPV ) , VSV , SFV , and the recombinant VSV - HA ( 22 ) were produced as described before ( 23 , 24 ) . Preparation of Membrane Fractions— From BHK cells , a light mem - brane fraction was prepared essentially as described ( 25 ) . Briefly , cells were homogenized with a syringe under a nitrogen atmosphere . A postnuclear supernatant was adjusted to 1 . 5 M sucrose and overlayered with 1 . 2 and 0 . 8 M sucrose . After centrifugation for 4 h ( 45 , 000 rpm , 4 °C in a SW40 rotor , Beckman ) , membranes were recovered from the 1 . 2 / 0 . 8 M interface . For radioactive labeling , cells on one 10 - cm culture dish were incubated for 4 h with 25 m Ci of [ 1 a , 2 a - 3 H ] cholesterol ( 48 Ci / mmol ) in infection medium ( see below ) or for 36 h with 80 m Ci of [ 32 P ] orthophosphate in G - MEM without tryptose phosphate . To analyze membranes after viral infection , the cells were harvested 6 h postinfec - tion and processed as above . Purification of Viruses— For the analysis of proteins , lipids , and DPH polarization , the viruses were grown in BHK cells . For the production of nonlabeled viruses , cells from three overconfluent 80 - cm 2 flasks were trypsinized and seeded in 10 275 - cm 2 flasks . After 36 h , viruses were adsorbed to the 90 % confluent cells ( 2 3 10 8 plaque - forming units / flask ) in infection medium ( MEM ; 0 . 2 % BSA , 10 m M Hepes , 2 m M glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin ) for 1 h . The inoculum was removed and replaced by infection medium . After 24 h , the medium was collected and centrifuged two times to remove cell debris ( 1500 rpm , 4 °C , Heraeus centrifuge ) . The supernatant was then layered on top of a step gradient in 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 m M NaCl ( TN ) consisting of 3 ml of 55 % ( w / v ) sucrose and 10 ml of 10 % ( w / v ) sucrose in a SW28 centrifuge tube . After a 2 - h centrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm and 4 °C , the 55 / 10 % interface was collected , diluted 3 - fold in TN , and then applied on an 8 - ml 50 % ( w / v ) glycerol cushion in TN . After a 2 - h spin ( 25 , 000 rpm , 4 °C ) in a SW28 rotor , the supernatant was discarded , and the virus pellet was resuspended in TN buffer overnight at 4 °C . A preparation from 10 275 - cm 2 flasks routinely yielded 1 – 2 mg of viral protein for FPV and VSV and about 0 . 2 mg for SFV . Radiolabeled viruses were produced following essentially the same protocol in smaller scale using two 10 - cm tissue culture dishes . Two hours postinfection , the cells were labeled with 0 . 5 mCi of [ 35 S ] methi - onine in medium containing 5 m M unlabeled methionine . For labeling with [ 1 a , 2 a - 3 H ] cholesterol ( 48 Ci / mmol ) , cells were preincubated for 4 h with 50 m Ci of [ 3 H ] cholesterol / dish in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s me - dium ( 0 . 1 % ethanol , 10 m M Hepes , 2 m M glutamine , 100 units / ml , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin ) . Subsequently , cells were washed twice with infection medium , and viruses were adsorbed and collected as described above . For labeling with 32 P , cells on two 10 - cm tissue culture dishes were incubated with 750 m Ci of [ 32 P ] orthophosphate / dish for 30 h in G - MEM without tryptose phosphate . Then cells were washed , and viruses were adsorbed and collected . Detergent and Cyclodextrin Extractions— Aliquots of virus or mem - brane preparations with a total lipid content smaller than 1 m g were extracted with 50 m l of 1 % ( w / v ) Triton X - 100 , 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M EDTA ( TXNE ) on ice for 20 min . In pelleting experiments , the extract was spun in a TLA - 100 centrifuge ( Beckman ) in a TLA100 rotor for 20 min at 80 , 000 rpm and 4 °C . Proteins in supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Alter - natively , lipids from pellet and supernatant fractions were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer ( 26 ) and subsequently analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica plates ( Kieselgel 60 ; Merck ) with chlo - roform / methanol / water ( 60 : 35 : 8 , v / v / v ) as a solvent . Radiolabeled 32 P - containing lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Rela - tive amounts of [ 3 H ] cholesterol were quantified by scintillation counting . For flotation gradients , virus aliquots containing 10 m g of protein were extracted with 250 m l of TXNE on ice for 20 min . Extracts were then brought to 40 % Optiprep by the addition of 500 m l of Optiprep stock solution ( Nycomed Pharma , Oslo , Norway ) , overlayered with 1 . 2 ml of 30 % Optiprep in TXNE and 250 m l of TXNE . Samples were spun for 2 h in a TLS 55 rotor ( 50 , 000 rpm , 4 °C ) , and six fractions were collected from the top of the gradient . Proteins were precipitated from the fractions by the addition of one volume of 20 % trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . Extractions with methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( CD ; Sigma ) were performed for 15 min at 37 °C in TN containing 5 m M EDTA and 10 m g / ml defatted BSA with gentle agitation . Subsequently , samples were cooled on ice and spun for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor ( 80 , 000 rpm , 4 °C ) . Electron Microscopy— Virions were sedimented by centrifugation in a TLA45 rotor ( 20 min , 30 , 000 rpm , 4 °C ) , and negative staining was performed using glow - discharged carbon - coated Formvar grids and a 1 % ( w / v ) solution of uranyl acetate ( Sigma ) . DPH Polarization Measurements— Polarization measurements were performed essentially as described ( 16 ) . Virus preparations or lipid vesicles were resuspended in 100 m l of TN buffer , and 1 m l of DPH ( Sigma ) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran was added . Samples were incu - bated for 1 h in the dark , and DPH fluorescence intensity was measured at 25 °C in an AB2 luminescence spectrometer ( SLM Aminco ) equipped with Glan - Thompson polarizers ( excitation wavelength , 359 nm ; emis - sion at 427 nm ; band pass 4 nm ) . Lipid vesicles were prepared by sonication of 2 ml of 0 . 5 mg / ml PC from egg yolk ( Sigma ) or 0 . 5 mg / ml DPPC ( Sigma ) in TN buffer . Similar results were obtained using vi - ruses or lipid vesicles at concentrations of 0 . 05 – 0 . 5 m g / ml and DPH at final concentrations of 50 n M to 1 m M . Fluorescence detected without DPH or without the addition of viruses was negligible . RESULTS Glycoproteins in the Influenza Virus Envelope , but Not in VSV or SFV , Are Recovered in DIGs— To study raft domains in different envelopes , the viruses were produced in BHK fibro - blasts and isolated by gradient centrifugation . The obtained preparations were essentially pure as judged by SDS - PAGE and silver staining ( Fig . 1 A ) . The detergent solubility of the viral glycoproteins was analyzed by extraction with Triton X - 100 on ice and centrifugation in Triton - containing density gradients . Influenza virus HA was floating to low density as observed before ( 14 ) , whereas the VSV G or the SFV glycopro - teins stayed in the bottom of the gradient , indicating that they were solubilized by the detergent ( Fig . 1 B ) . Therefore , associ - ation of a glycoprotein with rafts in the viral envelope is specific for influenza viruses and not a general phenomenon . Extractability of Cholesterol in Viral Envelopes— Cholesterol is strongly enriched in detergent - insoluble fractions from cel - lular membranes ( 5 ) . We therefore compared the Triton solu - bility of cholesterol in the different viral envelopes and the host cell membrane . BHK cells were labeled with [ 3 H ] cholesterol , and viruses were produced and purified . The radiolabeled membranes were extracted with Triton X - 100 on ice and cen - trifuged , and radioactivity in supernatant and pellet fractions was quantified by scintillation counting ( material pelleted by this centrifugation at 178 . 000 3 g will be considered “insolu - ble” ) . For comparison , a [ 3 H ] cholesterol - labeled light mem - brane fraction from BHK cells was prepared and detergent - extracted . Strikingly , the cholesterol solubility showed large differences between the viruses analyzed ( Fig . 2 A ) . In the in - fluenza viruses ( FPVs ) 41 6 8 % of the cholesterol was pelleted , in VSV 13 6 6 % , and in SFV only 5 6 5 % . Compared with the BHK light membrane fraction ( enriched for the plasma mem - brane , endosomes , and Golgi membranes ( 27 ) ) , cholesterol sol - ubility in the influenza virus envelope is decreased and in - creased in VSV and SFV . It is important to note that the cholesterol solubility in membranes from virally infected BHK cells was not significantly changed in comparison with unin - fected cells ( data not shown ) . We next used CD to further analyze the extractability of cholesterol in the different viral envelopes . In contrast to detergents , incubation with low con - centrations of CD leaves membranes intact and mediates se - lective efflux of sterols from the bilayer ( 28 , 29 ) . When [ 3 H ] cho - lesterol - labeled influenza viruses and VSV were treated with increasing concentrations of CD , cholesterol was more easily removed from the VSV envelope ( Fig . 2 B ) . For example , 1 m M Ordered Lipid Domains in the Influenza Virus Envelope 2039 CD extracted 70 6 3 % of cholesterol from VSV but only 43 6 2 % from the influenza virus particles . It should be noted that practically no further cholesterol efflux was observed when the extraction times were extended beyond 15 min ( data not shown ) . During the extraction , the viral particles remained intact and did not show any dramatic structural changes as judged by negative staining and electron microscopy ( Fig . 3 ) . The extractability of cholesterol by CD from the SFV envelope was found to be intermediate compared with the VSV and FPV envelope ; however , the results were somewhat variable ( data not shown ) . One possible explanation came from the morpho - logical analysis of the extracted particles . In contrast to FPV and VSV , the structure of the SFV particles was affected upon cholesterol removal , and the particles were penetrated by the stain ( Fig . 3 F ) . This might indicate a perturbation of the mem - brane and result in fragmentation of the particles , especially at higher CD concentrations . Instability of SFV particles has been observed before , when virions were produced in cholesterol - free insect cells ( 30 ) . However , clearly cholesterol in influenza vi - ruses is in a detergent - resistant state , whereas this is not the case for VSV and SFV . The Influenza Envelope Is Enriched for Cholesterol - depend - ent Detergent - insoluble Lipid Assemblies— The observed differ - ences in cholesterol extractability could result from the inclu - sion of raft domains into the viral envelopes to differing extents . To test this hypothesis , viruses were produced in 32 P - labeled BHK fibroblasts and detergent - extracted at 4 °C . Lip - ids from the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis . The major 32 P - labeled lipids detected in the BHK light membrane fraction were phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , and sphingomyelin ( SM ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . While PE and PC were largely solublized by Triton X - 100 , a fraction of the SM ( 41 6 7 % ) was insoluble ( as for the choles - terol extractability , no significant changes in the Triton X - 100 solubility of 32 P - labeled lipids were observed 6 h after viral infection ; data not shown ) . However , the SM solubility in the viral envelopes showed dramatic differences . While in influ - enza viruses 70 6 5 % of the SM could be sedimented after detergent extraction , only 27 6 7 or 15 6 8 % could be pelleted from VSV or SFV , respectively ( Fig . 4 A ) . To analyze the cho - lesterol dependence of the lipid solubility , membranes or virus particles were preextracted with 5 m M CD . We chose this con - F IG . 1 .

BHK cells were infected with FPV , VSV , or SFV , and viruses were collected for 24 h . 3 m g of protein of each preparation obtained by gradient centrif - ugation were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and silver staining . B , glycopro - teins in FPV , but not VSV and SFV , are associated with DIGs . Viral preparations were extracted with 1 % Triton X - 100 on ice , and extracts were adjusted to 40 % Optiprep . The extract ( 750 m l ) was overlayered with 1 . 2 ml of 30 % Optiprep and 250 m l of buffer , both containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , and centrifuged for 2 h at 55 , 000 rpm ( TLS 55 rotor , 4 °C ) . Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient ( lanes 1 – 6 ) and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against the viral glycoproteins . F IG . 2 . Cholesterol extractability in viral and cellular mem - branes . A , [ 3 H ] cholesterol - labeled virions or BHK membranes were extracted with 1 % Triton X - 100 on ice and centrifuged ( 30 min , 80 , 000 rpm , 4 °C , TLA100 ) . Relative amounts of [ 3 H ] cholesterol in supernatant and pellet were quantified by scintillation counting . Free counts not sedimented without detergent extraction ( 3 – 10 % of total ) were sub - tracted from the supernatant samples . B , [ 3 H ] cholesterol - labeled viri - ons were extracted with increasing amounts of methyl - b - cyclodextrin for 15 min at 37 °C . Viruses were sedimented by centrifugation ( 30 min , 80 , 000 rpm , 4 °C , TLA100 ) , and relative amounts of [ 3 H ] cholesterol in supernatant and pellet were quantified by scintillation counting . Free counts not sedimented without cyclodextrin treatment ( 3 – 10 % of total ) were subtracted from the supernatant samples . Ordered Lipid Domains in the Influenza Virus Envelope 2040 centration because it allows the removal of 70 – 90 % of the cholesterol but leaves the particles intact and results only in a minimal loss of 32 P - labeled lipids ( , 5 % ) from the samples ( data not shown ) . Insolubility of SM was cholesterol - dependent , since CD preextraction of the membranes resulted in increased sol - ubilization , both in the FPV and VSV envelopes and in the BHK membrane fraction ( Fig . 4 B , Table I ) . Also , the solubility of PC in the FPV envelope was strongly increased upon choles - terol removal ( Table I ) . Therefore , cholesterol is not only re - quired for the association of proteins with DIGs , but generally for the formation of detergent - insoluble lipid assemblies in a biological membrane . This also confirms that DIGs are not complexes coalescing from intrinsically insoluble components but that an interplay between different lipid species is required to form a detergent - resistant membrane . DPH Fluorescence Polarization Reveals Ordered Domains in the FPV Envelope— Studies with artificial lipid vesicles dem - onstrated that membranes in the liquid - ordered phase and GPI - anchored proteins incorporated into these membranes are insoluble in Triton X - 100 at 4 °C ( 16 , 17 ) . It was therefore proposed that DIGs isolated from biological membranes might also be derived from domains in the liquid - ordered phase ( 7 ) . Fluorescence polarization of the dye DPH incorporated into membranes has been widely used as a measure of acyl chain order . Lipid vesicles containing detergent - insoluble lipids showed significantly higher fluorescence polarization than lipid vesicles from detergent - soluble lipid mixtures , supporting the idea of ordered domains as a basis for insolubility ( 16 ) . While cellular membranes are heterogenous , viral envelopes provide a unique possibility to analyze DPH fluorescence po - larization in a biological lipid bilayer . When DPH was incorpo - rated into the envelopes of FPV , VSV , and SFV , the influenza virus showed the highest fluorescence polarization , whereas the lowest values were obtained for VSV ( Table II ) . For com - parison , DPPC and egg yolk PC vesicles prepared by sonication were analyzed . Clearly , all viral membranes show a higher fluorescence polarization than the egg yolk PC lipid vesicles , which are in the liquid crystalline phase . At 25 °C , the DPPC vesicles are in the gel phase ( T m 5 41 °C ) and accordingly show a very high fluorescence polarization ( 0 . 382 ) . The values ob - tained for the FPV envelope are only slightly lower , suggesting F IG . 3 . Morphological analysis of viral particles after choles - terol depletion . FPV ( A and B ) , VSV ( C and D ) , and SFV ( D and E ) were incubated without ( A , C , and E ) or with 5 m M CD ( B , D , and F ) for 20 min at 37 °C and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min ( 80 , 000 rpm , 4 °C , TLA100 ) . The preparations were then observed in an electron microscope after negative staining . F IG . 4 . Triton X - 100 solubility of lipids in FPV , VSV , SFV , and BHK membranes .

Rather surprisingly , the SFV envelope showed intermediate values between the VSV and FPV indi - cating a limited “fluidity , ” although according to the detergent solubility of the lipids highly ordered lipid complexes were not detected ( Table I ) . Most likely , this can be explained by the fact that SFV is an alphavirus , which is structurally different from the two negative strand RNA viruses FPV and VSV . Alphavi - ruses have a very high protein content , and the icosahedral lattices of the spike and capsid proteins are connected by strong protein - protein interactions ( 31 , 32 ) . These tightly packed pro - tein assemblies might cause the ordered structure of the mem - brane , sensed by the lipid probe . HA Incorporated into the VSV Envelope Is Detergent - solu - ble—In vitro detergent - resistant membranes can be formed solely by lipids ( 16 ) . However , it is not understood how proteins influence these lipid assemblies . Proteins might be required to induce or stabilize such domains in biological membranes . We used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus , which incorpo - rates influenza virus HA into the envelope ( VSV - HA ( 22 ) ) to analyze the detergent solubility of HA in the lipid environment of VSV . BHK cells were infected with VSV - HA , and [ 35 S ] me - thionine - labeled viruses were collected . The ratio of HA to VSV G in the envelope was approximately 1 : 5 , as previously re - ported ( Ref . 22 , Fig . 5 A ) . Virions were extracted with Triton X - 100 on ice and centrifuged . Proteins in the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting with HA or VSV G antibodies ( Fig . 5 A ) . Strikingly , both glyco - proteins were largely solubilized by the detergent . Consis - tently , no significant amounts of HA were floating in density gradients after Triton X - 100 extraction ( Fig . 5 B , compare with Fig . 1 B ) . Furthermore , cholesterol in the VSV - HA envelope was efficiently solubilized in Triton X - 100 ( 8 6 6 % insoluble ) , indi - cating that the presence of HA in a viral envelope is not suffi - cient to create insoluble domains and that the lipid environ - ments incorporated into VSV and FPV during budding are different . DISCUSSION Viruses as Model System to Study Membrane Domains— We have analyzed detergent - resistant lipid complexes in cellular membranes and different viral envelopes . The use of the viral envelope as a model membrane has several advantages over artificial lipid vesicles . Since the envelope is derived from the cellular plasma membrane , it has a natural lipid composition . Furthermore , bilayer asymmetry is preserved . Finally , the membrane contains proteins that will have a profound influ - ence on the membrane structure . Our results demonstrate that the three viral envelopes contain lipid raft domains to a very different extent as judged by the detergent solubility of their constituent proteins and lipids . For artificial lipid vesicles , it was demonstrated that such detergent - insoluble complexes are derived from lipids in the liquid - ordered or gel phase ( 15 , 17 ) . Several of our observations suggest that influenza viruses con - tain lipids in a state similar to the liquid - ordered phase . First , cholesterol , sphingomyelin , and phosphatidylcholine in the in - fluenza envelope are detergent - insoluble to a large extent . Sec - ond , cholesterol is required for the insolubility of the lipids . We have previously demonstrated that cholesterol is required for detergent insolubility of HA in cells as well in the isolated virions ( 14 ) . The cholesterol dependence of SM and PC insolu - bility shows that cholesterol is generally required for the for - mation of insoluble complexes in biological membranes rather than only for a specific interaction between HA and the sterol . This is consistent with the requirement for cholesterol for the formation of ordered domains in the membrane ( 33 ) . Finally , the DPH fluorescence polarization measurements demonstrate that acyl chains in the influenza virus envelope are highly ordered , whereas acyl chains in the VSV envelope are more mobile . In lipid vesicles , detergent - resistant membranes in the gel phase can be formed independently of cholesterol , simply by the addition of high amounts of sphingolipid ( 15 ) . Instead , the lipid composition of the membranes in mammalian cells ap - pears to be such that cholesterol is essential to promote the formation of the liquid - ordered phase , whereas a gel phase does not exist in cell membranes ( 34 ) . However , it has been observed that mammalian cells can remodel their lipid acyl chains when grown under sterol - limiting conditions . Insect cells , on the other hand , remain viable when cellular cholesterol levels are reduced to 1 – 3 % ( 35 ) . Therefore , cells appear capable of chang - ing their lipid composition to allow the formation of laterally organized domains even in the absence of cholesterol as has been observed for glycosphingolipids . However , the properties of such cholesterol - poor domains have not been characterized T ABLE II Polarization of DPH fluorescence in viruses or lipid vesicles at 25 °C Fluorescence polarization of DPH ( 50 n M ) in viruses or lipid vesicles ( each 0 . 05 m g / ml ) was measured .

B , VSV - HA virions were ex - tracted with 1 % Triton X - 100 on ice , and extracts were adjusted to 40 % Optiprep . The extract ( 750 m l ) was overlayered with 1 . 2 ml of 30 % Optiprep and 250 m l of buffer , both containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , and centrifuged for 2 h at 55 , 000 rpm ( TLS 55 rotor , 4 °C ) . Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient ( lanes 1 – 6 ) and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against HA or VSV G , respectively . Ordered Lipid Domains in the Influenza Virus Envelope 2042 ( 36 ) . Influence of Proteins on Membrane Domain Organization— Viral envelopes have a very high protein : lipid ratio . It is there - fore conceivable that , in addition to the lipid composition , pro - teins exert an influence on the membrane structure . Influenza virus HA contains in its membrane - spanning domain a deter - minant that is required for the association with lipid raft do - mains ( 14 , 37 ) . Also , the palmitoylation of HA might contribute to the detergent insolubility , because a mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail with the palmitoylation sites ( 38 ) is fully sol - uble . 2 Both determinants interact with the lipid bilayer and might affect the order of the lipids . However , the fact that HA incorporated into the VSV envelope was mostly soluble sug - gests that this membrane does contain fewer lipids in an or - dered phase and that the inclusion of HA is not sufficient to organize such a detergent - resistant environment . Most likely , the VSV and influenza viruses acquire membranes with differ - ent lipid composition from the plasma membrane . The choles - terol to phospholipid ratios in the envelopes of influenza vi - ruses , VSV , and SFV appear to be similar ( 1 , 3 , 39 ) . Since sphingolipids and saturated phospholipids are known to pro - mote the formation of raft domains ( 15 , 16 ) , these lipids might be preferentially incorporated into influenza viruses . In the future , a detailed analysis of the lipid head groups and acyl chains in the different viral envelopes should clarify this issue . Such an analysis might also allow the identification of raft - promoting lipids without the use of detergents . It has recently been shown that raft domains in the plasma membrane are small and dispersed but that they can coalesce upon cross - linking of their lipid or protein constituents ( 8 , 9 , 40 ) . Similarly , large oligomeric proteins like caveolin could stabilize rafts into macroscopic domains in the liquid - ordered phase . Inversely , the size and stability of the caveolin com - plexes are modulated by raft domains , illustrating an interde - pendence of raft size and protein oligomerization ( 41 ) . Simi - larly , rafts could be stabilized by proteins binding to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the domains ( 42 ) . We speculate that lipids in cellular membranes are kept in an equilibrium state in which specific protein interactions can modulate the dynamics of rafts , leading to coalescence or dispersion of domains in the liquid - ordered phase , depending on the oligomeric state of the protein . Coalescence of domains in the liquid - ordered phase could induce bending of the membrane ( 43 ) . In agreement with this view , caveolae form invaginations on the cell surface but are flattened out when cholesterol is removed ( 44 ) . Similarly , coalescence of a liquid - ordered phase might facilitate budding of influenza viruses from the plasma membrane . In this latter case , the membrane is curved outwards , whereas in the former it is curved inwards . The topology of the invagination might depend on the properties of the specific proteins involved . Lipid Domains in Virus Assembly— We have shown that lipids in the influenza virus envelope are in an ordered state and less ordered in the VSV envelope . This suggests that in - fluenza virus is assembled from raft domains in the plasma membrane . For VSV , fluorescence digital microscopy has re - vealed the formation of domains during the budding step . Both the glycoprotein and the matrix protein were shown to induce lateral organization of lipid within the membrane ( 39 , 45 ) . Consistently , the lipid composition of the VSV envelope was shown to differ from the host cell membrane , indicating selec - tive inclusion of specific lipid components ( 2 ) . For influenza viruses , a detailed comparison of the lipid head groups and the acyl chains in the envelope and the host cell membrane has not been performed . The incorporation of raft domains into the viral envelope may explain some puzzling features of influenza virus assembly . It has been observed that lateral cross - linking of HA by antibodies creates large patches with raft character - istics ( 40 ) . Concomitantly , cytoplasmic proteins with raft affin - ity can be recruited to the raft patches without requiring direct interactions with the influenza spike protein ( 40 ) . It has been a surprising finding that influenza viruses in which the cytoplas - mic tails of both glycoproteins have been deleted still form infectious progeny ( 46 ) . This could be explained by connecting the influenza spike proteins over the rafts with the cytoplasmic matrix protein . Assuming that the spike proteins interact lat - erally with each other , this would lead to exclusion of cellular glycoproteins . A role for raft domains during virus assembly is also highlighted by the fact that the membrane - spanning do - main of influenza HA is required for both its incorporation into the envelope and raft association ( 14 , 37 , 47 ) . Therefore , coa - lescing lipid domains might be employed at sites of particle assembly to facilitate the exclusion of cellular proteins and to favor specific incorporation of the viral components .
