Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of mycolactone is cytotoxic to diverse mammalian cells ( albeit with varying efficiency ) , whereas at lower doses it has a spectrum of immunosuppressive activities . Combined , these pleiotropic properties have a powerful influence on local and systemic cellular function that should explain the pathophysiology of BU disease . The past decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects in a range of different cell types . This review will focus on the current state of our knowledge of mycolactone function , its molecular and cellular targets , seeking to identify commonalities between the different functional and cellular systems . Since mycolactone influences fundamental cellular processes ( cell division , cell death , and inflammation ) , getting to the root of how mycolactone achieves this could have profound impact on our understanding of eukaryotic cell biology . Introduction BU is a chronic necrotising skin ulcer caused by infection with the environmental opportunistic pathogen , Mycobacterium ulcerans . While the mechanism by which infection is acquired from the environment is still controversial ( person to person transmission does not occur except in one reported case of mechanical skin breakage [ biting ] ) , what is clear is that the production of mycolactone by the bacilli is essential to the pathophysiology of the disease . Mycolactone has been shown to cause the two determining features of the ulcers - the cellular cytotoxicity and the pronounced immunosuppression - which act together to drive the progressive ulceration and persistent infections seen in patients . There are many excellent reviews of BU disease pathogenesis [ 1 , 2 ] , treatment [ 3 ] and transmission [ 4 ] as well as M . ulcerans microbiology [ 5 , 6 ] in the literature - this review will therefore focus specifically on the cellular actions of mycolactone on eukaryotic ( host ) cells , and recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which mycolactone mediates these effects . Mycolactone The existence of a factor that contributed to the virulence of M . ulcerans was postulated as long ago as 1965 [ 7 ] , but was first assumed to be a secreted protein toxin . Sterile filtrates of liquid cultures were shown to induce rounding up , detachment and death of L929 fibroblasts in culture [ 8 ] , and also to inhibit the proliferation of T cells and phagocytosis by murine macrophages [ 9 ] . The cytotoxic activity and an ability to suppress cytokine production was subsequently shown to reside in the alcohol soluble lipids ( ASLs ) extracted from M . ulcerans culture supernatants [ 10 , 11 ] ; but it wasn ' t until 1999 that mycolactone was isolated to purity by Pamela Small ' s group [ 12 ] . In contrast to initial expectations , it is now clear that mycolactone largely resides in the extracellular matrix ( biofilm ) that forms around growing bacterial colonies / clusters [ 13 ] . Mycolactone is a polyketide lactone ( Figure 1 ) , consisting of a 12 - membered lactone core and two polyketide side chains [ 12 ] . As such , it is lipid - like in its characteristics and highly hydrophobic . The most virulent strains of M . ulcerans makes a 3 : 2 ratio of mycolactone A / B ( Z - / E - isomers of the C4 - C5 bond in the long polyketide side chains ) and most research into the biological functions of mycolactone has focussed on this . Experimental investigation has been facilitated in recent years by the availability of synthetic mycolactone [ 14 ] with which to carry out biological assays . So far , the biological activity of the biological synthetic compound appears to be identical to that of the purified natural A / B form ( [ 15 ] and Hall and Simmonds unpublished ) . However , a number of naturally occurring variants of mycolactone are produced by clinical isolates from geographically diverse areas as well as other non - pathogenic mycolactone - producing mycobacteria ( MPM ) ( Figure 1 ) . Indeed most strains of M . ulcerans make a range of mycolactone - like molecules [ 16 ] . Each of these mycolactones contain the lactone ring and vary by the length of the side chain , and the location of hydroxyl groups and double bonds within it and they all have differing abilities to induce cellular cytotoxicity and suppress cytokine production ( see below , and reviewed in [ 17 , 18 ] ) . This implies that the biological function is conferred largely by the long polyketide side chain , and this was confirmed in a recent study where synthetic mycolactones A / B , C and F had differing LC 50 values , and loss of this side chain renders the compound effectively inert [ 15 ] . On the other hand , modifications of the short polyketide chain had a less profound influence over cytotoxic activity [ 15 ] . Mycolactone production is due to the giant ( 174Kb ) plasmid pMUM [ 19 ] that is present in all MPM . There is still a paucity of experimental data relating to the timing , regulation and extent of mycolactone production for M ulcerans bacilli . The mls genes encoded in pMUM have been reported to have a strong sigA type promoter that is constitutively expressed during planktonic monoculture under laboratory conditions [ 20 ] . But how this relates to expression in its environmental niche ( itself not clearly defined ) or during different stages of clinical ulcers is not known . What is clear , however , is that during antibiotic treatment of patients with advanced ulcers , a non - inflammatory immunohistochemistry reverts to a granulomatous pattern more similar to that seen in other mycobacterial infections ( such as M . tuberculosis , M . leprae and M . marinum M ) , possibly suggesting that rifampicin / streptomycin are able to switch off mycolactone production as part of the mycobacteriocidal activity [ 21 ] . On the other hand , mycolactone has been successful isolated from ulcer exudates of patients who have completed a sterilising course of antibiotic therapy [ 22 ] and also persists in experimental infections [ 23 ] . It is assumed that mycolactone accesses mammalian cells by means of passive diffusion due to its hydrophobic nature . Bodipy - labelled mycolactone has been detected in the cytosol of cells within 2 minutes of exposure , but interestingly is excluded from the nucleus [ 24 , 25 ] . Other in vivo experiments have demonstrated that mycolactone can diffuse away from the site of injection and can access all bodily compartments with the exception of the brain [ 26 ] . In a patient study , mycolactone could be detected in the serum of 3 out of 6 BU patients prior to starting antibiotic therapy [ 22 ] . Thus is seems that mycolactone can have wide - reaching systemic , yet not universal , effects . Cytotoxic activity At high doses ( usually considered to be above 1µg / ml , around 1 . 3µM ) and / or prolonged exposure times ( > 24 - 48 hours ) , mycolactone is generally cytotoxic to mammalian cells . The most sensitive cells identified to date are L929 murine fibroblasts and these are frequently used as reporter cells . DNA content analysis showed that mycolactone induces cell cycle arrest at G1 / G0 [ 12 ] . The cells also undergo cytoskeletal rearrangements and become apoptotic . Interestingly , different types of cells show different susceptibilities to mycolactone - induced cytotoxicity . For instance , purified human monocytes [ 27 ] show no significant reduction in viability after 24 hours , whereas immature dendritic cells ( DCs ) are relatively more sensitive after 48 hours [ 28 ] . Even prolonged ( > 24 hour ) exposure of PBMCs [ 29 ] , mature DCs [ 28 ] , Jurkat T cells [ 29 ] and myeloid cell lines , such as J774 ( human macrophage - like ) [ 30 ] , RAW264 . 7 ( murine macrophage ; Hall and Simmonds , unpublished ) and CLC ( adherent carp monocytic ) cells [ 31 ] causes only minimal cytotoxicity , growth inhibition or apoptosis . It is also interesting to consider cytotoxicity in the context of infected skin , and different groups have now investigated the sensitivity of myocytes , keratinocytes , adipocytes , fibroblasts and Schwann cells to mycolactone [ 32 - 35 ] . All of these cells can be killed by mycolactone , although adipocytes in particular seem to require extended exposure times even to see small levels of necrosis [ 35 ] . The neurotoxicity has been a suggested mechanism for the painlessness of BU ulcers although the connection between cell cycle arrest and toxicity is unclear [ 33 ] . Even though the keratinocytes at the basal layer of epidermis are rapidly dividing in human skin and are reportedly sensitive to mycolactone , the epidermis is often observed to be undergoing hyperplasia during BU [ 36 ] . On the other hand , relatively resistant adipocytes do not divide beyond puberty but are killed in BU , providing the classic " ghost - cell " appearance of coagulative necrosis in histopathology indicating that they must be susceptible to mycolactone ' s effects , either directly or indirectly . How these different in vitro and in vivo phenomena are related is a highly interesting question , and the mechanism of cell death as a consequence of mycolactone exposure in infections appears to be more complex than simply a matter of cell cycle arrest . In fact , recent work by Caroline Demangel ' s group has shed light on a mechanism of mycolactone induced cell death [ 37 ] . Here , low doses of mycolactone were shown to cause cells to rapidly form filopodia ; clusters of actin bundles associated with wound healing and cell - cell interactions . This was found to be due to mycolactone - dependent enhancement of actin polymerisation following its binding to the GTPase domain of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome Protein ( WASP ) family of proteins . The inappropriate activation of WASP and relocalisation of the actin nucleating complex Arp2 / 3 are thought to explain the well characterised cytoskeletal rearrangement in mycolactone treated cells . These were associated with loss of cell adhesion and e - cadherin - dependent tight junctions which could be partially restored by the addition of the WASP inhibitor , wiskostatin . Indeed e - cadherin itself appears to be down regulated by mycolactone ( [ 37 ] Table 1 ) . It therefore appears that , at least in vitro , cell death is related to anoikis , i . e . apoptosis due to detachment . Immunosuppressive activity One of the most striking features of BU histopathology sections is abundant foci of extracellular acid - fast bacilli in the absence of an inflammatory infiltrate . Instead , mononuclear cells are found the periphery of the infection but not close to the bacilli , suggesting the signals required to access the infection are missing [ 26 , 38 , 39 ] . It is now generally accepted that mycolactone is the immunosuppressive factor . Since this immunosuppression is so central to the body ' s inability to clear the infection ( although it should be noted that this is not always the case - some patients do spontaneously heal and this is associated with a delayed - type hypersensitivity response [ 40 ] ) much research attention has focussed on this area in the last decade . Immunosuppressive doses of mycolactone are generally lower than cytotoxic doses on the same cell type , and are certainly faster acting . For instance , primary human monocytes begin to produce TNF within 40 minutes of exposure to an inflammatory agent and mycolactone effectively obliterates this at a tenth of the cytotoxic dose [ 27 ] . Mycolactone can suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in patients and in experimentally infected mice . Mycolactone is also able to suppress innate responses by restricting many of the functions of tissue resident macrophages . Like other mycobacterial infections , M . ulcerans can be phagocytosed by macrophages in the early stages of infection [ 41 ] , presumably escaping digestion by preventing phagolysosome formation similarly to M . tuberculosis . Over short time periods and at low MOIs it can proliferate inside murine macrophages , until mycolactone causes the apoptosis / necrosis of the macrophages and the release of the bacilli into the intercellular space [ 39 ] . Despite this , it has been shown in vitro that wild type strains of M . ulcerans are not phagocytosed as effectively as mycolactone - negative strains and exogenous mycolactone has the ability to complement this activity [ 41 , 42 ] . One of the other key events that would normally occur upon phagocytosis of a microbe is activation by pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) - including stimulation of Toll - like receptors [ TLRs ] and the NLRP3 inflammasome - resulting in intracellular signalling cascades that result in a rapid , profound and controlled inflammatory response , including the production of cytokines and chemokines to recruit other inflammatory cells to the site of infection . However , cells exposed to mycolactone - producing strains of M . ulcerans secrete dramatically less TNF than those encountering mycolactone - negative strains [ 43 ] . Purified mycolactone profoundly inhibits the ability of monocytes , macrophages , T cells and DCs to do this [ 10 , 27 , 43 , 44 ] . Furthermore , the production of other cytokines and chemokines , ( including IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 and IP - 10 ) is also dramatically reduced in both primary human monocytes and macrophages , as is expression of the pro - inflammatory mediator cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) ( Table 1 ; [ 27 ] and Hall and Simmonds , unpublished ) . Failure to produce cytokines and chemokines at the site of infection is considered a likely explanation for the lack of an inflammatory infiltrate close to bacilli , with the peripheral infiltrate indicating the limit of biologically active doses of mycolactone [ 2 ] . However , the technical expertise to measure or detect such low levels of mycolactone in situ is still lacking . In addition to inhibiting macrophage function , mycolactone also inhibits DC maturation , as determined by the maturation marker CD83 ( see Table 1 ) , and a lack of the expected upregulation of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD40 in response to PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) [ 28 ] . In addition , DC chemokine production is suppressed , principally affecting IP - 10 , MCP - 1 and MIP - 1α [ 28 ] . This may explain the anergy that has been reported in patients , where their T cells no longer respond to mycobacterial antigens after exposure [ 45 ] , and contribute to the reduced Th1 / Th2 / Th17 responses seen in whole blood - restimulations [ 44 ] . In addition to inhibiting the costimulatory and migratory function of DCs , and therefore indirectly affecting T cell activation , T cells themselves are also directly sensitive . Low doses of mycolactone directly block the mitogen - and CD3 / CD28 - depedent production of IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IL - 17 , IFNγ and MIP - 1β from CD4 + T cells [ 44 ] . Furthermore , lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes is inhibited due to a down - regulation of L - selectin and LFA - 1 on the surface of T cells [ 46 ] . Mechanism underlying mycolactone - dependent inhibition of protein production . It is predicted that the proteins affected by mycolactone may share an underlying mechanism of production that could explain their co - regulation . The gene regulatory networks of many inflammatory mediators , including cytokines , chemokines and some PAMP - induced costimulatory molecules have many components in common , making them attractive targets for investigation . Transcriptional regulation by the NFκB and IRF transcription factors is the most widely studied example , as well as mRNA stabilisation mediated by p38 MAPK and AU - rich elements ( AREs ) in the 3 ' UTRs of inflammatory genes [ 47 , 48 ] . Furthermore , some cytokines such as TNFα are translationally derepressed by LPS by a mechanism that is also partially dependent on AREs but is still not yet fully understood [ 49 ] . Production of mature TNFα and IL - 1β are additionally dependent on cleavage of pro - proteins by TACE ( tumour necrosis factor - α - converting enzyme ) and caspase - 1 ( in the NRLP3 inflammasome ) , respectively [ 50 , 51 ] . Early work on the mechanism of suppression by mycolactone was a carried out in Jurkat T cells using ASLs and focussed on the suppression of IL - 2 production [ 10 ] . In this cell line , mycolactone strongly inhibited the activation of NFκB following TNFα stimulation , which led to the initial assumpti on that this was a generalisable mechanism , even though these authors found no effect on NFκB activation in other different model systems ( PMA - induced in Jurkat cells , IL - 1 induced in HeLa cells and LPS induced in RAW264 . 7 cells ) [ 10 ] . Indeed the effect of mycolactone on steady state IL - 2 mRNA levels turns out to be dependent on the stimulus , being substantially reduced during the CD3 / CD28 response and enhanced for PMA / ionomycin [ 29 ] . More recently transcriptional profiling of primary human T cells found no significant changes in mRNA level [ 46 ] . The situation is similar in myeloid cells since a detailed investigation of the effect of mycolactone on the LPS - dependent upregulation of TNFα , IL - 6 and COX - 2 showed that while protein production is completely ablated by low immunosuppressive ( non - cytotoxic ) doses of mycolactone , the steady state induced mRNA levels are not affected or are again e nhanced in the case of TNFα [ 27 ] . This is true for primary human monocytes [ 27 ] , RAW264 . 7 cells [ 41 ] , primary human macrophages and HeLa cells ( Hall and Simmonds unpublished ) . Thus it seems that , with the exception of the transformed Jurkat T cell line , transcriptional regulation cannot explain the immunosuppression seen in mycolactone - exposed cells . A detailed investigation in primary human monocytes was the first to propose a post - transcriptional mechanism for mycolactone function , probably at the level of translation [ 27 ] Analysis of the signalling pathways revealed that neither MAPK or NFκB signalling was affected in these cells , and neither did the proteins appear to be trapped inside the cells . The enhanced or unaffected transcription would also seem to rule out an effect on mRNA stability - indeed even inhibitors such as SB203080 , which targets p38 MAPK , are only cause partial inhibition of TNF production [ 52 ] , in contrast to the complete block seen following mycolactone exposure . While it is clear that mycolactone is acting post - transcriptionally , mycolactone is not a general inhibitor of protein production in monocytes , since it does not suppress total protein synthesis . Total incorporation of 35 S - labelled Met / Cys is not altered by the presence of mycolactone [ 27 ] and neither are general pathways controlling translation : mycolactone does not affect phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 [ MTORC1 ] targets eIF4E or p70s6 kinase or the endoplasmic reticulum stress response marker eIF2α [ 27 ] . This finding was later confirmed in T cells [ 29 ] . Thus it seems that mycolactone is selectively targeting a subset of genes for control . One obvious candidate for mediating such gene - selective control would be microRNAs but there is little evidence to support this . A small yet significant decrease in let - 7b levels has been observed in T cells exposed to mycolactone . Surprisingly , inhibition of let - 7b caused a decrease in L - selectin mRNA and overexpression increased it , suggesting that L - selectin is not a direct target of let - 7b ( since the opposite pattern would have been expected ) . However the findings were not confirmed at the protein level . Our group is currently investigating translational and post - translational mechanisms of protein production inhibition . Conclusion Taken together , the loss of protein production by key players in the immune response and cellular adhesion would appear to be driving the immunosuppression and tissue necrosis in BU ( Table 1 ) . Indeed , when all available literature are surveyed , only three proteins could be identified that are upregulated by mycolactone ( Table 2 ) ; the chemokine receptor CCR7 [ 46 ] and two muscle - specific E3 ubiquitin ligases ( MuRF - 1 and Atrogin - 1 ) [ 34 ] . Of course there are many proteins which escape mycolactone - dependent regulation ( notably constitutive expression of actin , CD28 , p38 MAPK and eIF2α and also the LPS - dependent resynthesis of IκBα , Table 2 ) since total cellular protein production rates are not suppressed [ 27 ] . However , it is currently unclear how the suppression of constitutively expressed proteins such as e - cadherin and CD3 fits with our current models of mycolactone function . While the recent finding of a direct interaction between mycolactone and WASP is exciting , it would not appear to explain the inhibition of cytokine production since wiskostatin treatment does not reverse the action of mycolactone as expected ( Hall & Simmonds , in preparation ) . Instead , the cellular compartments of the sensitive and insensitive proteins may be informative when considering a unifying mechanism for this fascinating pleiotropic molecule .
