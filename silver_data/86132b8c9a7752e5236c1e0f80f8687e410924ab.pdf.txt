Vale , University of California , San Francisco , CA , and approved September 18 , 2013 ( received for review July 25 , 2013 ) Assembly of appropriately oriented actin cables nucleated by for - min proteins is necessary for many biological processes in diverse eukaryotes . However , compared with knowledge of how nucle - ation of dendritic actin ﬁ lament arrays by the actin - related pro - tein - 2 / 3 complex is regulated , the in vivo regulatory mechanisms for actin cable formation are less clear . To gain insights into mech - anisms for regulating actin cable assembly , we reconstituted the assembly process in vitro by introducing microspheres functional - ized with the C terminus of the budding yeast formin Bni1 into extracts prepared from yeast cells at different cell - cycle stages . EM studies showed that unbranched actin ﬁ lament bundles were reconstituted successfully in the yeast extracts . Only extracts enriched in the mitotic cyclin Clb2 were competent for actin cable assembly , and cyclin - dependent kinase 1 activity was indispensi - ble . Cyclin - dependent kinase 1 activity also was found to regulate cable assembly in vivo . Here we present evidence that formin cell - cycle regulation is conserved in vertebrates . The use of the cable - reconstitution system to test roles for the key actin - binding proteins tropomyosin , capping protein , and co ﬁ lin provided important insights into assembly regulation . Furthermore , using mass spec - trometry , we identi ﬁ ed components of the actin cables formed in yeast extracts , providing the basis for comprehensive understanding of cable assembly and regulation . Cdk1 | three - dimensional structured - illumination microscopy | actin nucleation E ukaryotic cells contain populations of actin structures with distinct architectures and protein compositions , which me - diate varied cellular processes ( 1 ) . Understanding how F - actin polymerization is regulated in time and space is critical to un - derstanding how actin structures provide mechanical forces for corresponding biological processes . Branched actin ﬁ lament arrays , which concentrate at sites of clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis ( 2 , 3 ) and at the leading edge of motile cells ( 4 ) , are nu - cleated by the actin - related protein - 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex . In contrast , bundles of unbranched actin ﬁ laments , which sometimes mediate vesicle traf ﬁ cking or form myosin - containing contractile bundles , often are nucleated by formin proteins ( 5 – 14 ) . Much has been learned about how branched actin ﬁ laments are polymerized by the Arp2 / 3 complex and how these ﬁ laments function in processes such as endocytosis ( 2 , 15 ) . In contrast , rel - atively little is known about how actin cables are assembled under physiological conditions . In previous studies , branched actin ﬁ la - ments derived from the Arp2 / 3 complex have been reconstituted using puri ﬁ ed proteins ( 16 – 19 ) or cellular extracts ( 20 – 25 ) . When microbeads were coated with nucleation - promoting factors for the Arp2 / 3 complex and then were incubated in cell extracts , actin comet tails were formed by sequential actin nucleation , symmetry breaking , and tail elongation . Importantly , the motility behavior of F - actin assembled by the Arp2 / 3 complex using de ﬁ ned , puri ﬁ ed proteins differs from that of F - actin assembled by the Arp2 / 3 complex in the full complexity of cytoplasmic extracts ( 19 , 26 – 28 ) . Formin - based actin ﬁ lament assembly using puri ﬁ ed proteins also has been reported ( 29 , 30 ) . However , reconstitution of formin - derived actin cables under the more physiological con - ditions represented by cell extracts has not yet been reported . The actin nucleation activity of formin proteins is regulated by an inhibitory interaction between the N - and C - terminal domains , which can be released when GTP - bound Rho protein binds to the formin N - terminal domain , allowing access of the C terminus ( FH1 - COOH ) to actin ﬁ lament barbed ends ( 31 – 40 ) . In yeast , the formin Bni1 N terminus also has an inhibitory effect on actin nucleation through binding to the C terminus ( 41 ) . Interestingly , several recent reports provided evidence for cell - cycle regulation of F - actin dynamics in oocytes and early embryos ( 42 – 45 ) . However , which speci ﬁ c types of actin struc - tures are regulated by the cell cycle and what kind of nucleation factors and actin interacting - proteins are involved remain to be determined . Here , we report a reconstitution of actin cables in yeast ex - tracts from microbeads derivatized with Bni1 FH1 - COOH , iden - tifying the proteins involved , increasing the inventory of the proteins that regulate actin cable dynamics and establishing that the actin cable reconstitution in cytoplasmic extracts is cell - cycle regulated . Results Reconstitution of Bni1 - Derived Actin Cable Assembly in Mitotic Yeast Extracts . To investigate the regulation and assembly of actin cables nucleated by formins , we took advantage of the yeast cytoplasmic Signi ﬁ cance Actin ﬁ laments are protein polymers that facilitate multiple bi - ological functions , including cell migration , vesicle traf ﬁ cking , and polarity establishment in eukaryotic cells throughout the cell cycle . Mechanisms of spatial and temporal regulation of actin assembly in vivo are incompletely understood . Formin proteins nucleate cables , which are bundles of unbranched actin ﬁ laments . We de - veloped a cell - extract system to reconstitute actin cable assembly nucleated by formins in a physiological context . Using this unique reconstitution system , we identi ﬁ ed an actin cable parts list . We also discovered that actin cable assembly is regulated in a cell - cycle – dependent manner both in vivo and in vitro . Author contributions : Y . M . and D . G . D . designed research ; Y .

These beads were added to cytoplas - mic extracts from yeast expressing Abp140 tagged with three molecules of GFP ( Abp140 - 3 × GFP ) as an actin cable marker . Initially , we incubated the GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads in extracts from unsynchronized log - phase yeast cells . Although Las17 ( yeast WASP ) - functionalized beads incubated in these ex - tracts effectively formed actin comet tails ( Fig . S1 A ) ( 24 ) , no F - actin was detected in association with the GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads ( Fig . 1 A ) . Recently , F - actin assembly was found to be regulated by the cell cycle in vertebrates ( 43 , 45 ) . Actin bundles assembled in metaphase were thicker and / or more prevalent than those as - sembled in interphase ( 43 ) . Cell - cycle regulation of actin as - sembly may be a conserved phenomenon because actin cables in ﬁ ssion yeast are present as thicker bundles and are comprised of longer ﬁ laments in the G2 / M stage of the cell cycle ( 47 ) . We therefore tested for actin cable assembly in yeast metaphase extracts . The yeast cell cycle is regulated by the periodic ap - pearance of distinct cyclins , which activate cyclin - dependent ki - nase 1 ( Cdk1 ) ( 48 ) . We avoided the use of temperature - sensitive cell - cycle mutants to minimize potential heat shock effects on F - actin behavior ( 49 ) . Instead , we used either hydroxyurea ( HU ) or nocodazole to arrest cells before preparing the cytoplasmic extracts . Examination of the cyclin levels revealed that the extracts from the HU - and nocodazole - treated cells showed el - evated mitotic cyclin ( Clb2 ) levels relative to S - and G1 - phase cyclins ( Clb5 , Clb3 , and Cln2 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) ( 48 ) . Strikingly , when GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH beads were incubated in extracts from HU - and nocodazole - arrested cells , actin cables polymerized from the beads ( Fig . 1 A ) . To control for effects of residual chemicals in our assays , we supplemented different concen - trations of HU or nocodazole in unsynchronized cell extracts . We tested HU at 0 . 15 M , 7 . 5 mM , and 0 . 375 mM and nocoda - zole at 15 μ M , 0 . 75 μ M , and 0 . 0375 μ M . We did not observe F - actin assembly in response to any of these treatments . ( Rep - resentative images are shown in Fig . S1 B . ) Beads coated with GST alone were not suf ﬁ cient to assemble actin ﬁ laments ( Fig . S1 C ) . In addition , we tested whether the other budding yeast formin , Bnr1 , can assemble actin cables in the extract system . However , even though GST - Bnr1 FH1 - COOH had a higher activity than GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH for pyrene actin nucleation in a solution assay ( Fig . S1 D and E ) ( 50 ) , GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH on beads incubated in extracts from HU - arrested cells or in solutions of pure actin can nucleate actin cables , but GST - Bnr1 FH1 - COOH cannot ( Fig . S1 F and G ) . Using extracts from HU - and nocodazole - arrested cells , 81 . 6 ± 8 . 7 % and 80 . 3 ± 7 . 8 % of GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads , respectively , were surrounded by actin cables ( Fig . 1 C ) . The actin cables assembled at a rate of 2 . 9 ± 0 . 661 μ m / min , which is equivalent to ∼ 18 subunits / s based on 370 subunits / μ m of actin ﬁ lament ( Fig . S1 H ) . This rate is of the same order of magnitude as actin cable assembly observed for budding yeast in vivo ( 51 , 52 ) . Once formed , the actin cables persisted for longer than 1 h . To explore further the cell - cycle regulation of actin assembly , we performed the actin cable reconstitution in cell extracts prepared fromcellsarrestedinmetaphasebytranscriptionalrepressionofthe CDC20 gene ( 53 ) . The endogenous CDC20 promoter was replaced by a methionine promoter , allowing CDC20 expressiontobeturned off upon addition of methionine - supplemented medium . Similar to extracts prepared from HU - and nocodazole - treated cells , extracts from pMET - CDC20 arrested cells also initiated actin cable for - mation on Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads ( Fig . 1 A and C ) . To analyze the relationship between cable - assembly activity and cyclin expression , we synchronized cdc15 - 2 cells expressing epitope tagged - cyclins ( Table S1 ) and Abp140 - 3 × GFP . cdc15 - 2 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 90 % 100 % 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 90 % 100 % A B D E F C Unsynchronized cell Hydroxyurea Nocodazole pMET - CDC20 HU HU + DMSO HU + 1NM - PP1 Anti - Pgk1 GST - Bni1FH1COOH cdk1 - as1 P o l ys t y r ene bead s A bp140 - 3 X G F P A bp140 - 3 X G F P Beads without F - actin Beads with F - actin Beads without F - actin Beads with F - actin U n s y n c h r on i z ed H y d r o xy u r ea N o c oda z o l e N o c oda z o l e Cln2 Clb2 Clb3 Clb5 Pgk1 G I H Bead Bead 1 500 nm 250 nm Fig . 1 .

PNAS | Published online October 16 , 2013 | E4447 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S S EE C O MM E N T A RY cells were ﬁ rst arrested at late anaphase / telophase by incubation at 37 °C for 180 min ( 54 ) . Then they were released by shifting to 25 °C , and cells were harvested every 30 min for parallel immunoblotting and actin cable - assembly assay . These studies revealed that the mitotic cyclin Clb2 is highly enriched in the extracts producing robust actin cable formation from GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – functionalized beads ( Fig . S2 ) . However , the per - centage of beads containing actin cables was lower ( 42 % ) than in extracts made from HU - or nocodazole - arrested cells . The most plausible explanation for the lower assembly in cdc15 mutant extracts is that the temperature - sensitive mutant is not fully reversible . We next tested whether Cdk1 kinase activity is required for actin cable assembly from Bni1 FH1 - COOH beads . To address this question , endogenous Cdk1 was replaced by an analog - sensitive allele of Cdk1 ( cdk1 - as1 ) , which can be speci ﬁ cally inhibited by the ATP analog 1 - NM - PP1 ( 55 - 57 ) . cdk1 - as1 cells were synchronized by HU addition and then were treated with 20 μ M of the ATP analog 1 - NM - PP1 for 30 min to inhibit the Cdk1 kinase activity speci ﬁ cally or as a control were treated with DMSO before extract preparation . Inhibition of Cdk1 activity caused actin cable - assembly activity to be abolished completely ( Fig . 1 D and E ) , whereas treatment of Cdk1 WT cells with 1 - NM - PP1 did not affect actin assembly ( Fig . S1 I ) . The loss of cable - assembly activity in inhibitor - treated cdk1 - as1 cells was not caused by a difference in soluble protein levels in the cytoplasmic extract , as shown by a phosphoglycerate kinase 1 ( Pgk1 ) loading control ( Fig . 1 F ) . Reconstituted Actin Cables Are Bundles of Actin Filaments . In yeast , actin cables are nucleated by formin proteins , stabilized by tropo - myosin ( Tpm1 ) , are composed of bundles of short ﬁ laments , and are localized near the cell cortex ( 50 , 52 , 58 – 63 ) . To analyze the structuralproperties of theactinstructures nucleatedfromthe Bni1 FH1 - COOH beads in cytoplasmic extracts , we examined the reconstituted F - actin structures by negative - staining EM ( Fig . 1 G – I ) . Actin ﬁ laments were assembled for 30 min on GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH beads and were subjected to negative staining on carbon - coated grids . Because of the high electron density of negatively stained polystyrene beads , a dark blurry area occupied a 200 - to 300 - nm zone around the beads . The actin ﬁ laments assembled from the GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads appeared in EM as bundles comprised of 10 - nm unbranched ﬁ laments with an average thickness of 83 . 8 ± 18 . 5 nm ( n = 52 from 16 bundles , measured within 1 μ m from the bead boundary ) . This di - mension is consistent with the reported in vivo cable thickness ( 90 – 100 nm ) at the G2 / M stage in ﬁ ssion yeast ( 47 ) . Because it was dif ﬁ cult to discern the ends of ﬁ laments , we could not calculate their individual lengths . Because Bni1 has not been reported to have a bundling activity ( 50 ) , the appearance of bundles in the cytoplasmic extracts suggests the presence of bundling factors . Recapitulation of Regulatory Protein Dependence During Actin Cable Reconstitution . To test how faithfully the Bni1 FH1 - COOH – dependent actin cable - reconstitution system recapitulates the in vivo function of actin - regulatory proteins , we generated extracts fromfour mutants inwhich actin - interacting proteinswere knocked out or rendered dysfunctional . These included the actin cable - speci ﬁ c stabilizing protein Tpm1 , the barbed end - capping pro tein ( Cap2 ) , the depolymerization factor co ﬁ lin ( Cof1 ) , and the actin cable regulator Bud6 . HU - arrested cells expressing Abp140 - 3 × GFP were used for actin cable - reconstitution assays . Mutants of different actin - interacting proteins showed distinct actin cable phenotypes ( Fig . 2 A – E ) . Deletion of TPM1 com - pletely abolished cable formation ( Fig . 2 B ) , similar to the in vivo phenotype ( 58 , 61 ) . In contrast , cables formed in cap2 Δ extracts were more numerous ( > 2 . 5 fold ) than in WT extracts ( Fig . 2 F and H ) , whereas aberrantly long actin cables were formed in cytoplasmic extracts from cof1 - 4 mutant cells ( Fig . 2 G ) . These results are consistent with the observations that capping protein antagonizes formin activity and that co ﬁ lin promotes cable turn - over in vivo ( 64 – 67 ) . Addition of 5 μ M Latrunculin A ( LatA ) to WT extracts subsequent to cable assembly caused complete actin cable disassembly within 5 min ( Fig . S3 A and C ) , suggesting that assembled F - actin turns over dynamically in this extract system , similar to observations in live cells ( 52 , 68 , 69 ) . In cof1 - 4 extracts , however , reconstituted cables disassembled more slowly upon LatA addition ( Fig . S3 B and D ) . Compared with WT extracts , bud6 Δ extracts did not show obvious defects in actin cable as - sembly from beads ( Fig . 2 E ) . We found that our membrane - free cytoplasmic extract supernatants contain much less Bud6 than whole - cell extracts ( Fig . S3 E ) , which is consistent with the membrane - associated nature of Bud6 ( 70 ) . Thus it is unlikely that the reason no effect on actin cable assembly was observed in bud6 Δ extracts relative to WT extracts is because Bud6 levels are depleted in our WT extracts . The actin elongation rate in bud6 Δ extracts also was similar to that in WT extracts ( 17 versus 18 subunits / s ) ( Fig . S3 F ) . We found that actin polymerization is initiated with similar timing in WT and bud6 Δ extracts and that the cables showed similar geometry ( Fig . S3 G ) . Taken together , these observations indicate that the Bni1 FH1 - COOH – based actin cable - reconstitution system faithfully recapitulates the functions of actin - interacting proteins and actin cable dynamics and provides functional insights ; therefore Bni1 FH1 - COOH – based actin cable - reconstitution is a robust system for studies of actin cable assembly . MS Reveals the Protein Composition of Bni1 - Nucleated Actin Cables . To identify the proteins associated with the Bni1 - derived actin cables , we performed MS on the F - actin structures assembled from beads in yeast extracts . We avoided using the F - actin – sta - bilizing drug phalloidin , which competes with some actin - binding proteins ( 71 ) . Polystyrene beads with assembled actin cables were washed and prepared for MS ( Materials and Methods ) . The MS analysis identi ﬁ ed 592 yeast proteins ( Dataset S1 ) using stringent criteria with false - discovery rates reduced to 0 – 0 . 5 % ( Materials and Methods ) . Because of the high sensitivity of MS identi ﬁ cation , we used a statistical method to identify the enriched proteins by comparing our MS results with the PeptideAtlas database using protein spectrum counts , as described previously ( Materials and Methods ) ( 24 ) . Using this strategy , 115 proteins ( Fig . 3 and Datasets S2 and S3 ) were found to be enriched in the Bni1 FH1 - COOH – derived actin cables ( P < 0 . 05 ) . We normalized protein extract samples by loading equal protein in each lane ( Fig . 3 B and C ) and found that yeast actin was the most highly enriched and abundant protein ( Fig . 3 B and C ) . The reconstituted cables also were enriched for the actin cytoskeleton proteins , ﬁ mbrin ( Sac6 ) , and Tpm1 ( Fig . 3 D ) , which associate with actin cables in vivo . Pgk1 , a cytosolic 3 - phosphoglycerate kinase with no known af - ﬁ nity for actin , was not detected ( Fig . 3 C ) . Previously , we found that actin networks nucleated in yeast extracts by the Arp2 / 3 complex consisted largely of proteins as - sociated with Arp2 / 3 - nucleated networks in cells ( 24 ) . Here , we detected actin - binding protein 1 ( Abp1 ) , thought to associate primarily with Arp2 / 3 - derived actin patches , associated with Bni1 FH1 - COOH – derived actin cables ( Fig . 3 C ) . However , the en - richment of Abp1 was 10 times less than observed in our actin patch reconstitution ( 24 ) . A null allele of ABP1 did not affect the formation of GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – derived actin cables ( Fig . S4 A ) . Arp2 / 3 proteins similarly were detected by MS ( Fig . 3 A ) , immunoblotting ( Fig . 3 C ) , and detection of ﬂ uorescently tagged proteins ( Fig . S4 B ) . However , we did not detect the Arp2 / 3 nu - cleation - promoting factorsMyo3 / 5 , Las17 , orPan1byMS , Western blotting , or by detection of ﬂ uorescently tagged proteins ( Fig . S4 C and D ) . To test further whether GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – mediated E4448 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1314000110 Miao et al . actin cable assembly was dependent on Arp2 / 3 complex activity , we added the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK - 666 and the control analog CK - 689 at 100 μ M to HU - arrested extracts . First , to test the activity and potency of the inhibitors , we used Las17 - coated beads in HU extracts from cells expressing Abp1 - mRFP . CK - 666 at 100 μ M , but not CK - 689 or a DMSO control , effectively abolished actin tail formation , even though Abp1 still was recruited to the Las17 - coated beads ( Fig . S4 E ) . However , CK - 666 did not inhibit actin cable assembly from GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads in HU - arrested extracts ( Fig . S4 F and G ) ( 72 ) . Furthermore , although Bni1 - derived actin ﬁ laments also form the contractile actomyosin ring in vivo ( 73 ) , we did not detect the type II myosin Myo1 or the IQGAP protein Iqg1 by MS or by detection of ﬂ uorescently tagged proteins ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S4 H ) . These results suggest that the reconstitutedactinstructuresprimarilyresemble actincablesrather than actin patches or the contractile ring . Cdk1 - Dependent Actin Cable Regulation in Vivo . To investigate how actin cables are regulated through the cell cycle in vivo , we ﬁ rst examined actin cables using super - resolution microscopy and Cdk1 inhibition using the cdk1 - as1 allele . We stained yeast actin ﬁ laments with Alexa - 568 phalloidin in cells expressing GFP - tag - ged Tub1 ( α - tubulin ) ( GFP - Tub1 ) , an indicator of cell - cycle stage . To distinguish actin cables better , we resolved them by super - resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) , instead of by conventional ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 4 A and Movie S1 ) ( 74 ) . We measured the average signal intensity of actin cables in metaphase cells with high Cdk1 activity and in G1 cells with the lowest Cdk1 activity ( 75 ) . We found that actin cables in metaphase cells had 21 % higher average signal intensity than those in G1 cells , indicating that metaphase cells have a higher abundance of actin ﬁ laments per cable area than G1 cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . Second , we tested the effect of Cdk1 inhibition on actin cables in bnr1 Δ cells that depend on Bni1 as the sole actin cable nucleator . We mea - sured the speed of actin cable movement , a re ﬂ ection of assembly rates , in living cells by following the positions of cable ends over time using Abp140 - 3 × GFP . Because of the predominant cortical localization of cables ( 76 ) , we monitored the actin cable move - ment close to cell cortex . In HU - arrested cells , actin cable ends moved at 1 . 18 ± 0 . 35 μ m / s ( Fig . 4 C ) , similar to rates previously reported ( 76 ) . However , when Cdk1 activity in cdk1 - as1 cells was inhibited by treatment with 20 μ M 1 - NM - PP1 for 30 min , actin cable velocity was reduced to 0 . 98 ± 0 . 23 μ m / s ( Fig . 4 C and Movies S2 and S3 ) . Finally , we examined the effects of Cdk1 inhibition on the average intensity of the actin cable signal by mixing Cdk1 and cdk1 - as1 cells in the same imaging sample to minimize sample - to - sample signal variation . To distinguish the two cell lines , Abp1 - mRFP , which has a strong actin patch signal , and Bni1 - 3 × mCherry , with a weak cortical signal , were used to distinguish W T c o f 1 - 4 t p m 1 c ap2 bud6 W T c o f 1 - 4 t p m 1 c ap2 bud6 an t i - P g k 1 tpm1 cap2 cof1 - 4 bud6 WT tpm1 cap2 cof1 - 4 bud6 WT F G H A c t i n c ab l e nu m be r / bead I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 cap2 cof1 - 4 bud6 tpm1 WT A B C D E Fig . 2 .

Cells ﬁ rst were arrested in HU for 3 h , followed by treatment for 30 min in DMSO alone as a control or 20 μ M 1 - NM - PP1 . Cdk1 and cdk1 - as1 cells showed similar signal intensities upon DMSO treatment ( Fig . 4 D ) . However , the average actin cable signal was 40 % lower in in cdk1 - as1 cells in which Cdk1 was inhibited by 1 - NM - PP1 than in cells with normal Cdk1 activity ( Fig . 4 D and E ) . To assess the speci - ﬁ city of this effect , we also tested whether Cdk1 activity is im - portant for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is driven by Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin ﬁ lament nucleation . We did not observe detectable changes in the lifetimes or the dynamics of endocytic proteins of the early module ( Ede1 , Syp1 ) , the coat module ( Sla1 ) , or the actin module ( Abp1 ) upon inhibition of Cdk1 activity ( Fig . S5 ) ( 77 ) . Cell - Cycle – Dependent Actin Cable Assembly Is Conserved in Vertebrates . The basic cell - cycle regulatory machinery consisting of Cdk1 and cyclins shows high conservation between yeast and vertebrate cells ( 48 ) . To determine whether cell - cycle regulation of actin cable assembly is conserved from yeast to vertebrates , we per - formed actin cable - assembly reconstitutions in metaphase and interphase Xenopus laevis extracts , using the mammalian formin protein , mDia2 . In mammalian cells , mDia2 plays an important role in generating actin ﬁ lament bundles for ﬁ lopodia protrusion ( 78 – 80 ) . We coated polystyrene beads ( 2 - μ m diameter ) with GST - mDia2 FH1 - COOH and assayed for rhodamine - actin as - sembly in Xenopus extracts . Similar to our observations with GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads in yeast extracts , GST - mDia2 FH1 - COOH – coated beads nucleated actin ﬁ lament as - sembly in metaphase Xenopus extracts ( Fig . 5 A and C ) . Beads coated with GST alone did not nucleate actin ﬁ lament assembly ( Fig . S6 A and D ) . Moreover , actin ﬁ laments were not assembled from GST - mDia2 FH1 - COOH – coated beads in interphase Xenopus extracts , although some actin ﬁ laments not associated with the beads were detectable in the background ( Fig . 5 B and D ) . In addition , supplementation with 10 μ M of the Cdk1 inhibitor RO - 3306 completely abolished actin ﬁ lament assembly from GST - mDia2 FH1 - COOH – coated beads ( Fig .

This reconstitution system also facili - tated the identi ﬁ cation of previously unknown actin cable com - ponents . Understanding how Actin Cables of De ﬁ ned Architecture and Protein Composition Assemble . In yeast cells , both branched endocytic actin networks and cables composed of unbranched actin ﬁ la - ments are assembled from the same actin but are nucleated by distinct factors , the Arp2 / 3 complex and formin proteins , re - spectively . How different actin - based structures with distinct associated proteins and distinct architectures are assembled in a common cytoplasm is an important unanswered question . Results here reinforce the conclusion that the identity of an actin ﬁ lament is established upon its birth , likely mediated by the distinct nucleation factors , and is reinforced by competitive and cooperative interactions of proteins with actin ﬁ laments and by ﬁ lament twist ( 1 , 82 ) . The actin cable - reconstitution system enabled us to identify , in an unbiased manner using MS , factors involved actin cable for - mation . As with our previous actin patch reconstitution ( 1 ) , MS was used to generate an actin cable parts list . This parts list in turn was used to identify candidate cable regulators , whose functions we tested using the reconstitution system and genetics . bnr1 cdk1 - as1 Abp140 - 3XGFP A c t i n c ab l e m o v e m en t s peed ( µ m / s ) HU + DMSO HU + 1 - NM - PP1 Fluorecent signal intensity ( A .

PNAS | Published online October 16 , 2013 | E4451 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S S EE C O MM E N T A RY The cable - associated proteins identi ﬁ ed by MS included Bud6 , a cofactor for Bni1 ( 46 , 83 ) ; the barbed end - capping proteins Cap1 / Cap2 ( 84 , 85 ) ; the ﬁ lament - stabilizing protein Tpm1 ( 58 , 61 ) ; the ﬁ lament - bundling protein Sac6 ( 86 , 87 ) ; and the de - polymerization factors Cof1 , actin - interacting protein 1 , coronin 1 ( Crn1 ) , and Srv2 ( 88 – 90 ) . Function of Actin - Binding Proteins in Actin Cable Assembly . The actin cable - reconstitution system allowed the functions of cable regu - lators to be tested in the context of the full complexity of the cy - toplasm . The actin ﬁ lament - stabilizing protein Tpm1 was enriched in the reconstituted cables , and actin cable assembly showed a pronounced dependence on Tpm1 that recapitulates the in vivo dependence ( 58 , 61 ) . Sensitivity of the reconstituted actin cables to the actin in - hibitor LatA established that the actin ﬁ laments in the cables turn over dynamically in the extract system . In vivo studies using LatA demonstrated that actin cable turnover depends on co ﬁ lin function in vivo ( 67 ) . Co ﬁ lin has different activities on actin ﬁ l - aments in vitro , depending on the concentration ( 91 ) , so it was important to test co ﬁ lin ’ s cable - regulatory role in the context of the full complexity of the extract system . Co ﬁ lin does not localize to actin cables detectably in vivo except in an aip1 - null mutant ( 64 , 86 , 92 ) . In extracts prepared from a co ﬁ lin mutant , actin cables were clearly longer and less sensitive to LatA treatment , consistent with the in vivo observations ( 67 ) . The heterodimeric capping protein competes with formins for actin ﬁ lament barbed ends in vitro ( 64 – 66 ) . Our results with the reconstituted actin cables assembled in yeast extracts reinforced observations made with pure proteins in vitro . We found that more cables assembled in extracts de ﬁ cient in capping protein . We also found that proteins of the small heat shock protein family ( sHsps ) were enriched with the reconstituted actin cables . Three sHsp proteins — Hsp12 , Hsp26 , and Hsp42 — were identi - ﬁ ed in the actin cable preparations . Hsp12 and Hsp26 were unique to Bni1 - derived cables , but Hsp42 also was identi ﬁ ed in association with Las17 - derived actin patches ( 24 ) . sHsps were reported to function as capping proteins or stabilization factors that protect actin ﬁ laments from severing proteins via direct or indirect interaction with actin ﬁ laments , indicating that functions for this family of proteins in cable regulation should be in - vestigated further ( 93 – 96 ) . Cell - Cycle Regulation of Yeast Actin Cable Assembly . The yeast actin cytoskeleton undergoes a precise program of rearrangements throughout the cell cycle ( 97 ) . The basis for these changes is not known , but we showed that inhibition of Cdk1 activity reduced cable - assembly rates and cable intensity in vivo . Recent reports in metazoans revealed up - regulation of actin assembly during metaphase ( 42 , 43 , 45 ) . However , which types of actin ﬁ lament networks are being regulated and which actin nucleation systems are being regulated are unclear . The Arp2 / 3 complex was sug - gested to be responsible for such metaphase - speci ﬁ c events for cell division ( 43 , 45 , 98 ) . On the other hand , the formin protein Fmn2 was suggested to cooperate with Spire to assemble meta - phase actin ﬁ laments for asymmetric cell divisions ( 99 – 101 ) . Here , we found that formin - mediated actin cable assembly was enhanced substantially in mitotic cell extracts in both yeast and vertebrates . Cdk1 activity was indispensible for reconstitution of yeastactincableassembly , andtheextractsthatbestsupportedcable assembly were enriched in the mitotic cyclin Clb2 . Cdk1 activity also showed in vivo regulation of the speed of actin cable movement and cable intensity . No such effects were observed for Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation , consistent with the observation that inhibition of Cdk1 activity did not affect endocytic internalization ( 102 ) . In contrast to Bni1 - derived actin cable reconstitution , Las17 - derived actin networks can be reconstituted successfully in cytoplasmic extracts prepared from unsynchronized cells ( 24 ) . Consistently , we did not observe detectable changes in the lifetimes or the dynamic behavior of endocytic patch proteins upon inhibition of Cdk1 ac - tivity in cells . Presently , we do not know how many cable components are regulated by Cdk1 activity . In previous studies , several cable related proteins were identi ﬁ ed as Cdk1 substrates in both in vivo and in vitro studies , and their phosphorylation levels were changed upon Cdk1 inhibition . These proteins include Bni1 , Bud6 , Crn1 , Cap2 , andCof1 ( 55 , 103 ) . Bni1andBud6 mightnotbe major determinants of cell - cycle – regulated actin cable assembly in our extracts , because weusedconstitutivelyactiveBni1andbecauseBud6absencedidnotaffectactincableassembly .

A serine - to - alanine mutant on Ser4 of Cof1 , cof1 - 4 , shows aberrantly long cables in our extract assay . How Cdk1 affects Cof1 phosphorylation and the biological effects require further study . Furthermore , because we found that Cdk1 regulates actin cable intensity in vivo , bundling proteins should be investigated . The cell - cycle – dependent reconstitution of actincableassembly inextracts from buddingyeast , a favorite model for cell - cycle studies , opens the way toward elucidating the regula - tory mechanism and identifying the relevant Cdk1 targets . Materials and Methods Yeast Strains , Growth Conditions , and Plasmids . Yeast strainsusedinthis study are listed in Table S1 . C - terminal GFP and RFP tags were integrated by ho - mologous recombination , as described previously ( 77 , 104 ) . All strains were grownat30°Cinstandardrichmedium ( YeastExtractPeptoneDextrose , YPD ) or synthetic medium supplemented with appropriate amino acids , unless otherwise noted . Plates were incubated for 3 d before scoring cell growth . Protein Puri ﬁ cation . GST - Bni1 COOH and Las17 were expressed and puri ﬁ ed essentially as previously described ( 105 ) , except for the method for breaking the cells . Yeast cells used for protein puri ﬁ cation were ground using a 6870 Freezer / Mill ( SPEXSamplePrep , LLC ) forsixcyclesconsistingof3minofbeating followed by 1 min of cooling . Protein concentrations were determined using the Gelcode blue staining reagent ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) with BSA as a standard . Actin Filament Polymerization on Beads in Cell Extracts . Two - micrometer nonfunctionalized polystyrene microspheres ( Polybead Microsphere ; Poly - sciences , Inc . ) were incubatedon ice with 100nM GST - forminproteins in 25 μ L of HK buffer [ 10 mM Hepes buffer ( pH 7 . 8 ) , 0 . 1 M KCl ] for 40 min before BSA was added to a concentration of 1 % and incubation for additional 15 min . Beads were washed two times by HK buffer containing 0 . 1 % BSA , were stored in 25 μ L of HK buffer , and were used within 8 h without signi ﬁ cant loss of actin cable - assembly activity . Unsynchronized yeast cells were collected from cultures grown at 30 °C in YPD to OD 600 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 . HU and nocodazole arrests were achieved by adding drugs to cells at an OD 600 of 0 . 7 followed by culture for two additional generations . The drug concentrations used were 0 . 15 M for HU and 15 μ M for nocodazole . To arrest cells carrying pMET - CDC20 , methionine was added to a ﬁ nal concentration of 10 mM to cells at an OD 600 of 0 . 7 , followed by incubation at 30 °C for 3 h before collection . Cells were harvested by cen - trifugation at 3 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C , were washed once in cold water , and were centrifuged again . Cells were resuspended at 180 OD / mL in cold water before being ﬂ ash - frozen in liquid N 2 and were ground by mortar and pestle for actin polymerization assays on beads . Yeast powder was mixed gently and thawed with 10 × HK buffer and protease inhibitors ( Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set IV ; Calbiochem , Merck4Biosciences ) and was centri - fuged for 25 min at 350 , 000 × g . The supernatant under the lipid layer was collected and used within 3 h . For all actin - reconstitution experiments using yeast cell extracts , 1 μ L of the functionalized microsphere beads was added to 19 μ L of extract to induce formation of actin ﬁ laments . Xenopus extracts from oocytes arrested at metaphase by cytostatic factor were prepared and provided by the R . Heald laboratory , University of Cal - ifornia , Berkeley , CA . Cytochalasin D was omitted from all steps during prep - aration . Interphase extracts were prepared from Xenopus extracts by the addition of calcium at a ﬁ nal concentration 0 . 4 mM to crude cytostatic factor extracts followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min . Polystyrene beads coated with GST - mDia2 FH1 - COOH ( 1 μ L ) were incubated with 8 μ L of extract and 1 μ L of 3 μ M rabbit actin [ 20 % ( mol / mol ) rhodamine - actin ] . Actin Cable - Like Structure Puri ﬁ cation and Sample Preparation for MS . Actin cable - like structures were assembled around the polystyrene microspheres for 30 min at room temperature in 500 μ L of extract . Beads were collected and washed essentially as previously described ( 24 ) . Data - dependent tandem MS analysis was performed with a LTQ - Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher ) . Full MS and tandem mass spectra were extracted from raw ﬁ les , and the tandem mass spectra were searched against a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein database ( database released on De - cember 16 , 2005 ) . To estimate peptide probabilities and false - discovery rates accurately , we used a reverse decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the proteins appended to the target database ( 106 ) . Tan - dem mass spectra were matched to sequences using the ProLuCID algorithm . ProLuCIDsearchesweredoneonanIntelXeon80processorclusterrunning under the Linux operating system . The peptide mass search tolerance was set to 10 ppm for spectra acquired on the LTQ - Orbitrap instrument . The mass of the amino acid cysteine was statically modi ﬁ ed by + 57 . 02146 Da , to take into account the carboxyamidomethylation of the sample . No enzymatic cleav - age conditions were imposed on the database search , so the search space included all candidate peptides whose theoretical mass fell within the mass tolerance window , regardless of their tryptic status ( 107 , 108 ) . The validity of peptide / spectrum matches ( PSMs ) was assessed in DTASelect ( 109 , 110 ) using two SEQUEST - de ﬁ ned parameters , the cross - correlation score ( XCorr ) , and normalized difference in cross - correlation scores ( DeltaCN ) . The search results were grouped by charge state ( + 1 , + 2 , + 3 , and greater than + 3 ) and tryptic status ( fully tryptic , half - tryptic , and nontryptic ) , resulting in 12 dis - tinct subgroups . In each of these subgroups , the distribution of Xcorr and Del - taCN values for ( i ) direct and ( ii ) decoy database PSMs was obtained ; then the directanddecoysubsetswereseparatedbydiscriminantanalysis . Fullseparation ofthedirectanddecoyPSMsubsetsgenerallyisnotpossible ; therefore , peptide match probabilities were calculated based on a nonparametric ﬁ t of the direct and decoy score distributions . A peptide probability of 90 % was set as the minimum threshold . The false - discovery rate was calculated as the percentage of reverse decoy PSMs among all of the PSMs that passed the 90 % probability threshold . In addition , we required that every protein be supported by at least a unique peptide with probability greater than 99 % . After this last ﬁ ltering step , we estimate that both the protein and peptide false - discovery rates were reduced to between 0 . 0 and 0 . 5 % . ( Dataset S1 ) . Because of the nature of the complex mixtures from cell extract samples , we took advantage of spectrum counting , which provides more reproducible linear correlations with protein abundance ( 24 , 111 , 112 ) , to identify the enriched proteins in our reconstituted actin ﬁ lament system . To analyze the peptide enrichment in speci ﬁ c protein samples , we compared the spectral counts of the actin assembly samples with spectral counts for peptides in PeptideAtlas ( www . peptideatlas . org / ) ( 113 ) , which contains an inventory of 60 , 313 distinct peptides from Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome ( version Dec . 2011 ) . By comparison with the PeptideAtlas database , the statistical signi ﬁ cance for each protein ( Dataset S2 ) from an actin assembly sample identi ﬁ ed by LC - MS / MS was determined by calculating the one - sided P value of a Fisher ’ s exact test with R ( www . R - project . org / ) . Only six proteins iden - ti ﬁ ed in the actin assembly samples were not recorded in the PeptideAtlas database . We chose a P value < 0 . 05 as a threshold to identify the proteins enriched with the highest probability . Network diagrams for enriched pro - teins were generated by Osprey 1 . 0 . 1 ( 114 ) software by Gene Ontology ( GO ) annotation ( The Gene Ontology Consortium , 2000 ; Dataset S3 ) derived from the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( www . yeastgenome . org ) . Only inter - actions among indenti ﬁ ed proteins were shown to reduce the complexity . EM . Actin cables were reconstituted in 1 . 5 - mL Eppendorf tubes by incubating GST - Bni1 FH1 - COOH – coated beads with yeast extract for 30 min . Beads were collected and washed in HK buffer as previously described ( 24 ) and then were resupended in HK buffer , immediately spotted ( 10 μ L ) onto carbon - coated copper grids , and negatively stained with 2 % ( wt / vol ) aqueous uranyl acetate for 2 min . Air - dried samples were examined at 120 kV in a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) , and images were recorded using an Ultrascan 1000 CCD camera ( Gatan , Inc . ) .

BeadassayimageswereacquiredusinganOlympusIX81microscope equipped with a 60 × PlanApo objective and a CCD camera ( Orca II ; Hama - matsu Photonics ) . For imaging yeast ﬂ uorescent signals in vivo , cells were immobilized as described previously ( 77 , 104 ) , and images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope ( Nikon ) with a solid - state Spectra - Xlightengine ( Lumencor ) , a100 × / NA1 . 40PlanApoVCobjective , and aNeo sCMOS camera ( Andor Technology ) . Imaging data were collected using Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices ) and processed using Image J ( Na - tional Institutes of Health ) . 3D SIM images were acquired essentially as pre - viously described ( 115 ) . The interactive 3D surface plot plugin of Image J was used for actin cable pattern demonstration by measuring the surface ﬂ uo - rescent signal intensity . The lifetimes of actin patches were measured by Imaris software ( Bitplane Scienti ﬁ c ) as previously described ( 116 ) . Western Blotting . Yeast whole - cell extracts were prepared as described pre - viously ( 117 ) .
