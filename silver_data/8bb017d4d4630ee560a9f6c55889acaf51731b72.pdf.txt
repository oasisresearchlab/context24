Martin , 1 , 2 and David G . Drubin 1 , * 1 16 Barker Hall Department of Molecular and Cell Biology University of California , Berkeley Berkeley , California 94720 Summary Actin polymerization essential for endocytic internali - zation in budding yeast is controlled by four nucle - ation promoting factors ( NPFs ) that each exhibits a unique dynamic behavior at endocytic sites . How each NPF functions and is regulated to restrict actin assembly to late stages of endocytic internalization is not known . Quantitative analysis of NPF biochemi - cal activities , and genetic analysis of recruitment and regulatory mechanisms , deﬁned a linear pathway in which protein composition changes at endocytic sites control actin assembly and function . We show that yeast WASP initiates actin assembly at endocytic sites and that this assembly and the recruitment of a yeast WIP - like protein by WASP recruit a type I myosin with both NPF and motor activities . Importantly , type I myosin motor and NPF activities are separable , and both contribute to endocytic coat inward movement , which likely represents membrane invagination . These results reveal a mechanism in which actin nu - cleation and myosin motor activity cooperate to pro - mote endocytic internalization . Introduction Endocytosis is an intricate process , involving the or - dered recruitment of endocytic adaptors , clathrin , and actin cytoskeletal proteins to the plasma membrane in both yeast and mammalian cells ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Merriﬁeld , 2004 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex - me - diated actin ﬁlament nucleation underlies a transient burst of actin polymerization , which coincides with en - docytic membrane invagination and vesicle scission ( Benesch et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 , 2004 , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . In yeast , actin polymerization and organiza - tion of actin ﬁlaments into a meshwork are required for endocytic internalization ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Dru - bin , 2003 ) . However , little is known about the mecha - nism by which actin assembly facilitates endocytic ves - icle formation . Furthermore , the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation machinery and type I myosins both localize to yeast en - docytic sites ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , but the relative contributions of nucleation and myosin motor activity to endocytosis have yet to be determined . The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by NPFs ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . In yeast , at least three NPFs , Las17p ( WASP ) , Pan1p ( Eps15 ) , and Abp1p ( mAbp1 ) , perform endocytosis - related functions ( Figure 1A ) ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . In addition , Vrp1p ( WIP ) stimulates type I myosin NPF activity in vitro ( Geli et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . Live - cell imaging demonstrated that each of these NPFs exhibits unique timing of appearance and dynamic behavior at cortical patches ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) , which are en - docytic sites in budding yeast ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . Las17p and Pan1p are recruited to cortical patches early , arriving w 20 s before actin is detected ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , Abp1p and Myo5p are late cor - tical patch components , arriving around the same time as actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Las17p and Myo5p remain associated with the plasma membrane during endocytic internalization , whereas Abp1p and Pan1p are internal - ized . Despite differences in NPF behavior , genetic evi - dence suggested redundant functions for NPFs ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2000 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , it is important to under - stand why such a high level of complexity in Arp2 / 3 reg - ulation is necessary for endocytosis . Furthermore , be - cause several NPFs arrive before actin assembly is initiated , it is essential to determine how actin assembly is restricted to the late stages of the endocytic internal - ization pathway . Yeast type I myosins ( Myo3p and Myo5p ) localize to endocytic sites and are essential for endocytic internal - ization ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Goodson et al . , 1996 ; Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ) . Myo3p and Myo5p contain an amino - terminal ATPase motor domain and a carboxy - terminal Arp2 / 3 binding ‘‘CA’’ domain like those found in NPFs ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that these myosins may function in both myosin - based and nucleation - based force generation . However , a predicted Myo3p rigor mutant blocked cortical actin polymerization in permeabilized cells ( Lechler et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , it was doubtful that the relative importance of motor function and actin nucleation could be evaluated by separation - of - function mutants . Analysis of puriﬁed , full - length Myo3 / 5p is required to determine whether type I myosin motor activity and NPF activity are functionally coupled . In this study , we use biochemistry in parallel with live - cell imaging and genetics to examine how indi - vidual NPFs , and a type I myosin motor , function to control endocytic actin assembly and to drive endocytic internalization . Results Quantitative Biochemical Analysis of the NPF Activities of Four Yeast Endocytic Proteins We sought to directly compare the NPF activities of the four yeast NPFs , but we ﬁrst needed to establish that budding yeast type I myosin has NPF activity . Vrp1p stimulates the NPF activity of type I myosin fragments containing the Arp2 / 3 binding ‘‘CA’’ domain in both * Correspondence : drubin @ socrates . berkeley . edu 2 These authors contributed equally to this work . budding and ﬁssion yeast ( Geli et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . However , full - length type I myosin containing both a motor and Arp2 / 3 binding do - main has never been puriﬁed . Because NPF truncations can have considerably different activity from the full - length protein ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , we puriﬁed full - length Myo5p and Vrp1p ( Figure 1B ) . Al - though full - length Myo5p was inefﬁcient at activating the Arp2 / 3 complex in a pyrene - actin assembly assay , addition of Vrp1p resulted in a 10 - fold increase in the concentration of nucleated barbed ends , saturating at w 50 nM Vrp1p ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . A Myo5p mutant lacking the Arp2 / 3 binding domain ( Myo5 - CA D p ) failed to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of Vrp1p , demonstrating that increased actin nucleation is due to Arp2 / 3 complex activation by Myo5p / Vrp1p ( Figure 1E ) . In contrast to the TH2 - SH3 - CA domain of ﬁs - sion yeast type I myosin ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) , full - length Myo5p / Vrp1p promoted the formation of stable Arp2 / 3 - dependent y - branches ( Movie S1 ) , demonstrating that Figure 1 .

( F ) Yeast actin ( 1 . 5 m M , 5 % pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) was polymerized with 2 . 5 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and the indicated NPF . Vrp1p ( 50 nM ) was used with Myo5p . The slopes of polymerization curves were measured at 30 % polymerization and were normalized to the maximal rate of Las17p - induced polymerization . Developmental Cell 34 Myo5p / Vrp1p generates a branched actin array , similar to Las17p ( data not shown ) . We next determined whether Vrp1p and Myo5p must bind to each other for full NPF activity . Mutation of a con - served tryptophan in the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of Myo5p ( W1123S ) abolishes Vrp1p binding ( Geli et al . , 2000 ) . We puriﬁed Myo5 - W1123Sp and found that direct binding of Vrp1p to Myo5p is required for Myo5p’s full NPF activity ( Figure 1E ) . In addition , Myo5 - W1123Sp and Vrp1p accelerated actin assembly less than wild - type Myo5p and Vrp1p in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1E ) . Deletion of both the SH3 and CA domains ( Myo5 - TH2 / SH3 / CA D p ) eliminated Myo5p’s ability to increase actin assembly in either the presence or absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex , further suggesting that both the SH3 and CA domains promote actin assembly ( Figure 1E ) . Having established that Myo5p / Vrp1p functions as an NPF in budding yeast , we next compared Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity to that of other yeast NPFs with a homolo - gous system of NPFs , actin , and Arp2 / 3 complex iso - lated from yeast . We used 2 . 5 nM Arp2 / 3 complex to ac - centuate differences between these NPFs . Under these conditions , Pan1p and Abp1p had no detectable NPF activity , whereas both Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p efﬁ - ciently activated the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1F and Figure S1 ) . When we used a higher Arp2 / 3 complex con - centration , Pan1p and Abp1p had detectable NPF activ - ity ( Figure S1 ) , as reported previously ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Goode et al . , 2001 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p have high NPF activity rela - tive to Pan1p and Abp1p . The fact that the most potent NPFs , Las17p and Myo5p , are not internalized during endocytosis strongly suggests that actin ﬁlaments are oriented primarily with their barbed ends facing the plasma membrane during endocytic internalization , as predicted by photobleaching studies ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . A Linear Pathway of NPF Recruitment Precedes Endocytic Vesicle Release Budding yeast NPFs exhibit distinct dynamic behaviors at endocytic sites ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Vrp1 - GFP also had distinct dynamics ( Figure 2A ) , exhibiting a lifetime of w 20 s , longer than both Myo5 - GFP ( w 10 s ) and actin ( w 15 s ) , but shorter than Las17p and Pan1p ( w 30 – 40 s ) . Similar to Las17p , but unlike Pan1p or Abp1p , Vrp1 - GFP remained nonmo - tile throughout its lifetime ( Figure 2A and Movie S2 ) . We next examined the spatiotemporal relationships of all NPFs by using Myo5p as a reference ( Figure 2B and Movie S3 ) . As summarized in Figure 2C , Las17p and Pan1p appear at cortical patches ﬁrst , followed by Abp1p , Myo5p , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arc15p ) ( Jons - dottir and Li , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Vrp1p ap - peared at patches after Las17p but before Myo5p and Abp1p ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Because extensive pro - tein - protein interactions link Las17p , Myo5p , and Vrp1p ( Goode and Rodal , 2001 ) , we tested whether these proteins recruit each other to cortical patches . In las17 D cells , Vrp1 - GFP no longer assembled into corti - cal patches , demonstrating that Vrp1p localization re - quires Las17p ( Figure 2D ) , consistent with results in ﬁs - sion yeast ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . In vrp1 D cells , Las17p still localized to patches ( Figure S2A ) ; however , Myo5p cortical patch intensity was greatly reduced ( Figure 2E ) . Vrp1p appeared to recruit Myo5p via Myo5p’s SH3 do - main , since Myo5 - W1123S - GFP exhibited similar partial mislocalization in the presence of wild - type Vrp1p ( Fig - ure 2E ) . Because the timing of Myo5 - GFP recruitment coincided with the initiation of actin assembly , it was possible that actin ﬁlaments contribute to Myo5p local - ization . Indeed , inhibition of actin assembly by Latrun - culin A ( LatA ) resulted in partial loss of Myo5p from cor - tical patches in wild - type cells ( Figure S2B ) ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) and complete loss of Myo5p in vrp1 D cells ( Figure 2F ) . Overall , these results suggest a functional hierarchy of protein recruitment to cortical patches in which Las17p recruits Vrp1p , which , together with actin ﬁlaments , recruits Myo5p . Because binding to Vrp1p is required for Myo5p NPF activity , Myo5p is likely acti - vated upon its recruitment to endocytic sites . Myo5 - GFP ﬂuorescence was previously reported to appear around the same time as Arp2 - DsRed and to peak immediately before the transition of Arp2 - DsRed from its slow - to - fast movement phases ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ) . Because actin patch fast movement likely rep - resents movement of released endocytic vesicles ( Kak - sonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) , Myo5p was proposed to play a role in vesicle scission ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ) . How - ever , DsRed is an obligate tetramer ( Baird et al . , 2000 ) , thus the DsRed moiety may have altered actin and Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics in those studies . Abp1p tagged with monomeric RFP ( Abp1 - RFP ) is a well - vali - dated marker for actin ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . There - fore , to determine at what stage of endocytic internaliza - tion Myo5p might function , we simultaneously imaged Myo5 - GFP and Abp1 - RFP with a high time resolution of 1 s . Analysis of patch intensity demonstrated that Myo5p peaked before Abp1p and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arc15p ) and was no longer detectable during the transi - tion from slow to fast movement ( Figures 2B and 2C and Movie S3 ) . Recently , the peak ﬂuorescence intensity for a GFP - tagged yeast amphiphysin homolog , Rvs167p , was shown to coincide with its one - step , inward move - ment into the cytoplasm , possibly representing a vesicle scission event ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Importantly , Myo5p / Vrp1p , Las17p , and Pan1p all peaked before the Rvs167p peak ( Figures 2B and 2C ) , suggesting that these NPFs function prior to vesicle scission . To determine the stoichiometry of NPFs and their binding partners in cortical patches , we used GFP - ﬂuo - rescence intensity to compare their local concentrations ( Figure 2G , Movies S5 and S6 , and Figure S2C ) . Because these proteins are dynamic , we measured the peak in - tensity of each fusion protein at endocytic sites . Abp1p was the most abundant cortical patch protein , appear - ing to be 2 - fold more abundant than the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arc15p ) and 6 - fold more abundant than Las17p . Vrp1p had a similar intensity to Las17p , consistent with its lo - calization being dependent on Las17p . There was half as much Vrp1p as Myo5p , suggesting that at most , only half of the Myo5p is activated by Vrp1p at a given time in vivo . This fraction is likely to be even lower since we did not account for Myo3p , which also binds to Vrp1p ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ) . These stoichiometries agree with the observation that Myo5p is only partially dependent on Vrp1p for cortical patch The Mechanism of Actin’s Endocytic Function 35 Figure 2 .

See Figure S2 for further details . All scale bars are 1 m m . Developmental Cell 36 recruitment . Because the total NPF concentration is three times greater than that of the Arp2 / 3 complex , only a fraction of these NPFs can interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex at a given time . Distinct NPF Functions during Endocytic Internalization To dissect the functions of individual NPFs in the endo - cytic pathway , we created precise mutants of the Arp2 / 3 complex binding domains of Las17p ( las17 - WCA D ) , Pan1p ( pan1 - WA D ) , and Myo5p ( myo5 - CA D ) . These mu - tants exhibited wild - type protein expression levels and localization ( data not shown ) . Because Myo3p and Myo5p function redundantly ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Goodson et al . , 1996 ) , analysis of myo5 - CA D was per - formed in a myo3 D background . Mutant cells express - ing a component of the endocytic coat module , Sla1 - GFP , and a marker for actin , Abp1 - RFP , were imaged to visualize endocytosis in real time . In wild - type cells , Sla1 - GFP containing patches are joined by Abp1 - RFP shortly before both of these proteins disappear ( Kakso - nen et al . , 2003 ) . NPF mutations had speciﬁc effects on the timing of Abp1p recruitment . The las17 - WCA D mu - tant delayed actin polymerization at endocytic sites , represented by the delay in Abp1 - RFP recruitment ( Figure 3A and Movie S7 ) . Neither pan1 - WA D , myo5 - CA D myo3 D , nor pan1 - WA D myo5 - CA D myo3 D delayed actin polymerization , suggesting that Las17p is sufﬁ - cient to initiate actin polymerization at endocytic sites ( Figure 3A and Movies S7 and S8 ) . However , when com - bined with las17 - WCA D , both pan1 - WA D and myo5 - CA D myo3 D further delayed actin assembly initiation ( Figure 3A ) . Thus , Pan1p and Myo3 / 5p NPF activity are important for initiating actin assembly only in the ab - sence of Las17p . In wild - type cells , Abp1p recruitment accompanies the slow inward movement of both Sla1p and Abp1p away from the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . This slow Sla1 - GFP movement likely reﬂects en - docytic membrane invagination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . Surprisingly , although las17 - WCA D caused a sig - niﬁcant actin assembly delay , the frequency of Sla1 - GFP inward movement was only slightly lower than that in wild - type cells ( Figure 3A and Movie S7 ) . Furthermore , most Sla1 - GFP patches in pan1 - WA D and pan1 - WA D las17 - WCA D mutant cells showed inward movement ( Figure 3A ) , consistent with the ﬁnding that a double mu - tant defective in Las17p and Pan1p NPF activity shows only a modest defect in a - factor internalization ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , the frequency of Sla1 - GFP in - ward movement was signiﬁcantly reduced in the myo5 - CA D myo3 D mutant ( Figure 3A ) . The myo3 D myo5 D and vrp1 D mutants blocked Sla1 - GFP inward movement ( Figure 3A and Movie S9 ) , further supporting the conclusion that Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity is impor - tant for endocytic internalization . Strikingly , the las17 - WCA D myo5 - CA D myo3 D triple mutant was completely defective in Sla1 - GFP inward movement ( Figure 3A and Movie S8 ) , demonstrating that although Myo5p / Vrp1p is most important , Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activi - ties both contribute to endocytic internalization . The endocytic defect of the las17 - WCA D myo5 - CA D myo3 D triple mutant likely resulted from a defect in actin nucleation since Abp1 - RFP ﬂuorescence was greatly re - duced at endocytic sites ( Figure 3A and Movie S8 ) . The timing of actin assembly in the las17 - WCA D myo5 - CA D myo3 D mutant was indistinguishable from that in the las17 D mutant ( Figure 3A ) . This is probably because the las17 D mutant causes Vrp1p mislocalization , which subsequently affects Myo5p localization and NPF activ - ity . Together , these data demonstrate that the two most potent NPFs , Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p , are most im - portant for endocytic coat inward movement / membrane invagination . Regulation of Actin Nucleation Activity during Endocytosis As shown above , Las17p initiates actin assembly at en - docytic sites . However , Las17p is present in cortical patches for w 20 s before actin is detected ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Sla1p may inactivate Las17p until the ap - propriate activator arrives ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , we tested whether other SH3 - containing proteins can activate Las17p NPF activity in the presence of Sla1p . We found that puriﬁed Bzz1p ( Figure S3 ) , a syndapin - like protein with two SH3 domains , relieved Las17p inhi - bition by Sla1 - SH3p in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig - ures 3B and 3C ) . Relief of Sla1p’s inhibition of Las17p required Bzz1p’s SH3 domains ( data not shown ) . There - fore , this result reveals a novel mechanism for the acti - vation of a WASP - family protein , in which inhibition of NPF activity by one SH3 - containing protein is relieved by another SH3 - containing protein . To investigate whether Bzz1p regulates Las17p NPF activity in vivo , we examined Bzz1 - GFP dynamics in live cells . Bzz1 - GFP remained associated with the plasma membrane during endocytic internalization , similar to Las17p , but exhibited a lifetime of w 17 s ( Figure 2A and Movie S4 ) . Two - color imaging demonstrated that Bzz1 - GFP was recruited to cortical patches immediately before actin polymerization was initiated ( Figures 2B and 2C and Movie S3 ) , consistent with Bzz1p relieving Las17p inhi - bition by Sla1p . Although initiation of actin polymeriza - tion was normal in the bzz1 D mutant , actin polymeriza - tion was delayed in bzz1 D vrp1 D cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Bzz1p contributes to actin as - sembly initiation in vivo . One or several of four uncharac - terized SH3 - containing Las17p interacting proteins may also function with Bzz1p to activate Las17p in vivo ( Ma - dania et al . , 1999 ; Tong et al . , 2002 ) . In total , these data suggest that Las17p activity is regulated by the protein composition of the patch , which changes dynamically . Once actin assembly is initiated , it must be moderated to prevent excessive polymerization , which may impair endocytosis and deplete the pool of actin and its binding proteins ( Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2003 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Bbc1p inhibits Las17p NPF activity in vitro ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) , and bbc1 D cells exhibit exaggerated Sla1p and Abp1p inward movement , with distances of up to four times as far into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Because Bbc1p dynamics were indistinguishable from those of Myo5p ( Figure 2B ) , and Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity appeared most important for Sla1 - GFP slow movement , we determined whether Bbc1p also inhibits Myo5p / Vrp1p Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Bbc1p in - hibited Myo5p / Vrp1p activity in a dose - dependent man - ner , similar to Las17p ( Figure 3D ) . To determine whether the enhanced Sla1 - GFP inward movement observed in The Mechanism of Actin’s Endocytic Function 37 Figure 3 .

( F ) Kymographs from two - color movies of bbc1 D cells expressingSla1 - GFP , Abp1 - RFP , and the indicated NPF mutant ( s ) . The mean distance of Sla1 - GFP inward movement 6 SD was calculated from ﬁve patches for each strain . Developmental Cell 38 bbc1 D cells resulted from misregulation of either Las17p or Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity , we crossed the bbc1 D mutant with the NPF mutants . The enhanced Sla1 - GFP inward movement in bbc1 D cells was speciﬁcally sup - pressed by myo5 - CA D myo3 D and vrp1 D , but not by las17 - WCA D or pan1 - WA D ( Figure 3F and Movie S10 ) . These results suggest that misregulation of Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity contributes to the exaggerated Sla1 - GFP slow movement observed in bbc1 D cells . Therefore , Myo5p / Vrp1p regulation by Bbc1p ap - pears to affect the duration of endocytic coat inward movement . In addition to Bbc1p , Abp1p can also inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex activation by Las17p in vitro ( D’Agostino and Goode , 2005 ) . This inhibition was not speciﬁc to Las17p , as Abp1p also inhibited Myo5p / Vrp1p activity in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 3E ) . Therefore , rather than an Arp2 / 3 complex activator , Abp1p appears to function as a general NPF inhibitor , possibly limiting the level of nucleation that occurs at an endocytic patch . Myo5p’s Motor Activity Functions Independently from Its NPF Activity So far , our study has focused on the importance of actin nucleation during endocytosis . The type I myosin motor is another ‘‘force generator’’ that may also contribute to endocytic internalization . Because Myo3 / 5p motor ac - tivity was proposed to affect actin polymerization in per - meabilized cells ( Lechler et al . , 2000 ) , a critical question is whether Myo5p motor activity can be distinguished from its actin assembly activity . To address this ques - tion , we ﬁrst puriﬁed full - length Myo5p and Myo5p mo - tor mutants to test their motor activities in vitro ( Fig - ure 4A ) . Mutation of glycine 132 to arginine ( G132R ) changes a conserved residue of the nucleotide binding region and is predicted to be a rigor mutant ( Lechler et al . , 2000 ) . Phosphorylation by p21 activated kinases ( PAKs ) is proposed to regulate yeast type I myosin mo - tor activity ( Wu et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore we also mutated the phosporylated serine ( S357 ) of the PAK consensus site in Myo5p to either alanine ( inactive ) or aspartate ( ac - tive ) . In addition , we puriﬁed Myo5p that completely lacked the motor domain ( motor D ) . Using an actin ﬁlament gliding assay , we assessed Myo5p motor activity by measuring the speed of actin ﬁlament translocation across a Myo5p - coated coverslip ( Figure 4B and Movie S11 ) . Wild - type Myo5p moved rabbit actin ﬁlaments at a speed of 0 . 15 6 0 . 03 m m / s , similar to Acanthamoeba type I myosin ( Zot et al . , 1992 ) . Similar gliding speeds were obtained with yeast actin ﬁlaments ( 0 . 17 6 0 . 04 m m / s ) . These observations demonstrate that yeast type I myosin has motor activity . Actin ﬁlament translocation was dependent on the mo - tor domain as Myo5 - motor D p and the Myo5 - G132Rp mutants failed to move actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 4B ) . In ad - dition , Myo5 - S357Ap and Myo5 - S357Dp reduced the speed of actin ﬁlament movement by 80 % and 60 % , re - spectively ( Figure 4B ) . Because both the S357A and S357D mutants were defective in actin ﬁlament gliding , it is not clear whether the S357D mutation fully mimics phosphorylation . To determine whether Myo5p motor activity is re - quired for its NPF activity , we investigated whether Myo5p motor mutants activate the Arp2 / 3 complex with the pyrene - actin assembly assay . All Myo5p motor mutants , including the motor deletion , showed indistin - guishable NPF activity from the wild - type protein ( Figure 4C ) . Furthermore , Myo5 - CA D p exhibited normal motor activity ( Figure 4B ) , demonstrating that the Arp2 / 3 binding region of Myo5p is not required for motor func - tion . Therefore , the motor and NPF functions of Myo5p are separable . Myo5p Motor Activity Is Required for Endocytic Coat Inward Movement We next determined whether Myo5p motor activity is re - quired for endocytosis . We integrated the myo5 - G132R , myo5 - S357A , and myo5 - S357D mutations into the yeast genome , replacing the endogenous copy of MYO5 . Myo5p motor mutant proteins were expressed at wild - type levels ( data not shown ) . Although myo5 - G132R , myo5 - S357A , and myo5 - S357D grew normally in the presence of MYO3 , myo5 - G132R , myo5 - S337A , and to a lesser extent , myo5 - S357D , growth was temperature sensitive when combined with the myo3 D mutant ( Figure S4 ) . Examination of GFP - tagged Myo5p mutants demonstrated that Myo5 - G132R was recruited to corti - cal patches with similar efﬁciency to the wild - type pro - tein ( Figure 5A and Movie S12 ) . In contrast , Myo5 - S357A and Myo5 - S357D were present in cortical patches at reduced levels ( Figure 5A and Movie S12 ) . Because F - actin is important for Myo5p patch localiza - tion , these mutants may decrease Myo5p afﬁnity for F - actin . Myo5p lifetime at patches was increased for all three mutants , with Myo5 - G132R being the longest lived and Myo5 - S357D being the shortest lived ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , Myo5p lifetimes are inversely correlated with the in vitro motor activities of these mutants ( Figure 4B ) . To determine how Myo5p motor activity affects endo - cytic internalization , we analyzed Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - RFP dynamics in myo5 - G132R myo3 D , myo5 - S357A myo3 D , and myo5 - S357D myo3 D mutant cells . Sla1 - GFP inward movement was defective in Myo5p motor mutants , suggesting that Myo5p motor activity is essen - tial for plasma membrane invagination ( Figure 5C and Movie S13 ) . In addition , internalization of a marker for ﬂuid phase endocytosis , Lucifer yellow , was defective in all three motor mutants , similar to the myo5 D myo3 D mutant ( Figure 5D ) . Mislocalization of Myo5 - S357Ap , and Myo5 - S357Dp , is unlikely to be solely re - sponsible for their endocytic defects because the myo5 - W1123S mutant , which was also partially mislo - calized , was only partially defective in Sla1 - GFP and Lu - cifer yellow internalization ( Figures 5A – 5D ) . Further - more , Myo5 - G132R is present at normal levels in cortical patches . Importantly , Abp1 - RFP is efﬁciently re - cruited to Sla1 - GFP patches in the motor mutants , pro - viding strong evidence that Myo5p motor activity is not required for cortical actin polymerization in vivo ( Figure 5C ) . Together , these data suggest that Myo5p motor activity , independent of Myo5p actin nucleation activity , is required for endocytic internalization . To determine whether the elevated NPF activity pres - ent in a bbc1 D mutant can suppress the Myo5p motor mutant internalization defect , we combined Myo5 - G132R - GFP with the myo3 D and bbc1 D mutants and examined Abp1 - RFP inward movement . Myo5 - G132R - GFP mutant cells were completely defective in the The Mechanism of Actin’s Endocytic Function 39 inward movement of Abp1 - RFP patches , which nor - mally move 948 . 2 6 132 . 7 nm ( n = 10 ) in bbc1 D cells ( Fig - ure 5E and Movie S14 ) . Thus , even in the presence of el - evated NPF activity , Myo5p motor activity is required for internalization . This result further suggests that Myo5p motor activity is not required for actin polymerization , but perhaps plays a direct role promoting membrane invagination . Myo5p Motor Activity Is Required for Actin Network Retrograde Flow Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity and Myo5p mo - tor activity are both required for endocytic internaliza - tion ( Figure 6A ) . The mechanism by which these activi - ties promote internalization needs to be investigated . Wild - type actin patches are smaller than the resolving power of a ﬂuorescence microscope , making it impos - sible to observe the structure , organization , and orien - tation of actin ﬁlaments by this technique . However , de - letion of Sla2p , a protein essential for endocytosis , results in elongated actin tails that originate from a stable complex of NPFs , endocytic adaptors , and cla - thrin ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . Pho - tobleaching studies indicated that actin subunits are added near the plasma membrane and are treadmilled back into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , as is expected to occur in wild - type patches . Therefore , we used the sla2 D mutant as a model in vivo system to Figure 4 .

Actin ( 1 . 5 m M , 10 % pyrene labeled ) was polymerized with 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 25 nM Vrp1p , and 15 nM Myo5p or Myo5p mutants , when indicated . Developmental Cell 40 examine how NPF and Myo5p motor activities affect actin dynamics . We expressed either Myo5 - GFP , Myo5 - CA D - GFP ( in a myo3 D ) , or Las17 - WCA D - GFP in sla2 D mutant cells also expressing Abp1 - RFP to label actin tails . Similar to Las17 - GFP , Myo5 - GFP localized to the heads of actin comet tails ( Figure 6B ) . Interestingly , actin tails still formed in both the Myo5 - CA D - GFP and Las17 - WCA D - GFPmutants , albeittheywerelesscontinuous ( Figure6B and Movie S15 ) . A similar phenotype for sla2 D tails was observed withArp2 / 3complex mutants that signiﬁcantly lower nucleation activity and impair endocytic internali - zation ( Martin et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , reducing actin po - lymerization efﬁciency does not block the formation of Figure 5 .

In contrast , Myo5 - G132R - GFP ( in a myo3 D ) resulted in a striking block in actin tail forma - tion in sla2 D cells ( Figure 6C and Movie S16 ) . Actin poly - merization still occurred at Myo5 - G132R - GFP sites ; however , instead of actin ﬁlaments ﬂowing away from the plasma membrane in tails that project into the cyto - plasm , patch - like actin structures that colocalized with Myo5 - G132R - GFP were formed ( Figure 6C ) . Similar re - sults were also obtained with the Myo5 - S357A mutant ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that Myo5p motor activity is required for actin ﬁlament retrograde ﬂow away from the plasma membrane . Discussion A Pathway for Endocytic Actin Assembly and Force Production Actin and actin - associated proteins arrive at endocytic sites in a highly deﬁned temporal order in both yeast and mammalian cells ( Merriﬁeld , 2004 ) . Although bud - ding yeast NPFs are recruited to endocytic sites with distinct timing and have distinct motility behaviors , when they are active and how they function during endo - cytosis was not clear . Combining live - cell imaging of en - docytosis with genetics and biochemical experiments using full - length proteins has enabled us to propose the following model for how NPFs and their binding part - ners function and how they are recruited to , and regu - lated at , endocytic sites in budding yeast ( Figure 7 ) . Las17p ( WASP ) arrives at endocytic sites w 20 s before actin assembly is initiated ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Las17p serves as a scaffold that assembles key compo - nents of the actin machinery for endocytic internaliza - tion . Initially , Sla1p , and possibly other early endocytic proteins , maintain Las17p in an inactive state ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . Vrp1p ( WIP ) and Bzz1p ( syndapin ) are sub - sequently recruited to endocytic sites by Las17p ( this study ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Soulard et al . , 2002 ) . Bzz1p , and possibly other SH3 - containing proteins , relieves Las17p inhibition by Sla1p , initiating actin nucleation at endocytic sites . Vrp1p and F - actin then recruit Myo5p ( type I myosin ) to endocytic sites , and Vrp1p activates Myo5p NPF activity . Las17p augments productive mem - brane invagination , which is most dependent on Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity . Concurrent with membrane invagi - nation , Abp1p and Bbc1p negatively regulate Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity ( this study ; D’Agostino and Goode , 2005 ; Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . In particular , Bbc1p inhibition of Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity regulates the duration of coat protein inward movement . This reg - ulation presumably ﬁne - tunes the level of actin nucle - ation at endocytic sites , ensuring the proper size and architecture of the actin meshwork . Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity and Myo5p motor activity are required for endocytic internalization . We speculate that actin nucleation and myosin motor activity cooperate to generate forces that drive mem - brane invagination . We showed that the NPFs that re - main nonmotile at the plasma membrane , Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p , have the highest NPF activity , which Figure 6 .

First image ( top ) and kymograph representation ( bottom ) from two - color movies ( one frame / s ) . ( C ) First image ( left ) and kymograph repre - sentation ( right ) from a two - color movie of sla2 D myo3 D cells expressing Abp1 - RFP and Myo5 - G132R - GFP . All scale bars are 1 m m . Developmental Cell 42 further supports the conclusion based on photobleach - ing studies that actin nucleation occurs preferentially at the plasma membrane in wild - type cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . The likely actin ﬁlament orientation at endocytic sites indicates that a type I myosin associ - ated with these ﬁlaments would walk toward the plasma membrane . Myo5p motor activity may contribute to membrane invagination by translocating actin ﬁlaments associated with endocytic coat proteins away from the plasma membrane into the cytosol . Sla2p and Pan1p may link actin ﬁlaments to the endocytic coat ( Baggett et al . , 2003 ; Henry et al . , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ; Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) . This model for actin - mediated endocytic membrane invagination is supported by the observation that Myo5p mutants de - fective in motor activity fail to translocate actin ﬁlaments off the plasma membrane in sla2 D cells . In addition , type I myosin motor activity may be required for the proper organization and / or orientation of actin ﬁlaments at en - docytic sites such that actin polymerization effectively generates force . Further investigation is needed to clar - ify the force generating mechanisms that facilitate endo - cytic internalization . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast and mamma - lian cells is far more similar than had previously been ap - preciated . Components of the mammalian endocytic ac - tin machinery , including N - WASP , WIP , and syndapin , share homology to yeast endocytic proteins , and in both instances , these proteins play a role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Merriﬁeld , 2004 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . Type I myosins are also im - portant for endocytosis and other membrane - related processes in a variety of organisms ( Osherov and May , 2000 ) . Thus , the mechanisms proposed here are likely to be widely conserved . Distinct Roles for NPFs during Endocytosis Our biochemical studies showed that Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p have signiﬁcantly higher NPF activity than Pan1p and Abp1p , suggesting that the different NPFs may have distinct roles during endocytosis . The difference in NPF activities may reﬂect the fact that Pan1p and Abp1p lack typical WH2 ( W ) and Central ( C ) domains , which are important for Arp2 / 3 complex acti - vation by WASP ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Each yeast NPF is a modular protein . Our analysis of NPF - related endocytic function therefore depended on theuse of precise mutations targeted to the Arp2 / 3 bind - ing domains . NPFs with the greatest NPF activity in vitro were the most important for endocytic function in vivo . Importantly , we identiﬁed unique endocytic functions for the NPFs , including those with similarly potent NPF activities . Las17p NPF activity is required to efﬁciently initiate actin assembly at endocytic sites . Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity is most important during endocytic coat inward movement . NPFs also appeared to have partiallyoverlappingfunctions . Myo5p / Vrp1pandPan1p could help initiate endocytic actin polymerization in the absence of Las17p . In addition , Las17p and Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activities cooperated to promote endocytic coat inward movement , which likely represents mem - brane invagination . Because blocking invagination pre - vents the analysis of subsequent endocytic steps , new strategies will be needed to determine whether actin nucleation also plays a role during vesicle scission . In contrast to the other yeast NPFs , deletion of Abp1p by itself results in only a slight defect in endocytic events ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . The Abp1p ‘‘A’’ domains , which bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex , have been shown to be re - quired for Las17p inhibition ( D’Agostino and Goode , 2005 ) . This suggests that Abp1p may functionally com - pete with other NPFs for Arp2 / 3 complex binding . Because Abp1p localization at endocytic sites is depen - dent on F - actin , Abp1p is possibly involved in a negative feedback loop to restrain actin nucleation after actin assembly is initiated . Regulation of Actin Assembly by Dynamic Changes in Patch Composition Yeast NPFs contain SH3 or proline - rich domains that mediate a complex array of protein - protein interactions ( Goode and Rodal , 2001 ) . Our results suggest that Figure 7 . A Model for How Actin Assembly Is Regulated and Produces Force during Endo - cytic Internalization See Discussion for description . The Mechanism of Actin’s Endocytic Function 43 dynamic changes in the protein composition of endo - cytic sites , mediated by SH3 / proline - rich domain inter - actions , play a key role in spatio - temporal regulation of actin assembly . We identiﬁed a critical mechanism for the activation of a WASP - family protein in which the SH3 domains of Bzz1p ( a yeast syndapin - like protein ) relieve Las17p in - hibition by the SH3 domains of Sla1p . Consistent with this activity , Bzz1p appears at endocytic sites immedi - ately before actin polymerization is detected . Bzz1p also contains an N - terminal F - BAR / EFC domain that tu - bulates membranes in mammalian cells ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , Bzz1p is a conserved en - docytic component that may link actin assembly to membrane curvature . Not all SH3 - containing proteins are antagonistic with Sla1p because another SH3 - con - taining protein , Bbc1p , further inhibits Las17p in the presence of Sla1 - SH3p ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . In addition to Bzz1p , Bbc1p , and Sla1p , at least four other unchar - acterized SH3 - containing proteins interact with Las17p ( Madania et al . , 1999 ; Tong et al . , 2002 ) . Analysis of their combinatorial effects on Las17p nucleation activity in vitro , as well as their appearance at endocytic sites in vivo , will be required to fully elucidate the mecha - nisms of Las17p regulation . In contrast to Las17p , it appears that Myo5p’s NPF activity is activated upon its recruitment to endocytic sites . Vrp1p cooperates with actin ﬁlaments to recruit Myo5p to cortical patches via its SH3 domain . Further - more , Vrp1p binding to Myo5p’s SH3 domain activates Myo5p NPF activity in vitro . The proline - rich domain of Bbc1p also binds to Myo5p’s SH3 domain ( Mochida et al . , 2002 ) and inhibits Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity . We found that Myo5p / Vrp1p NPF activity , but not Las17p activity , is required for the exaggerated movement of endocytic structures in a bbc1 D mutant . Because Bbc1p and Vrp1p both bind to Myo5p’s SH3 domain , Bbc1p possibly regulates Myo5p NPF activity by com - peting with Vrp1p for Myo5p binding . Based on our quantitative analysis of the relative abundance of these proteins in cortical patches , Bbc1p and Myo5p are pres - ent in similar amounts , whereas Vrp1p is present at about half the concentration of these proteins . The bbc1 D mutant may result in a higher proportion of Myo3 / 5p being activated by Vrp1p . Bbc1p may cooper - ate with Abp1p to restrain actin nucleation at endocytic sites . The abp1 D and bbc1 D mutants exhibit similar pro - ﬁles of genetic interactions , suggesting that they share a common function that is important for efﬁcient endo - cytic internalization ( Mochida et al . , 2002 ) . Type I Myosin Motor Activity Is Required for Endocytic Internalization but Not for Cortical Actin Polymerization Previously , Myo3 / 5p motor activity was implicated in cortical actin assembly in permeabilized yeast cells ( Lechler et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , whether Myo5p’s motor activitycouldbefunctionallyseparatedfromactinnucle - ation was not clear . We conclusively demonstrated that the Myo5p motor and Arp2 / 3 complex activation activi - ties are separable in vitro . Furthermore , actin polymeri - zation efﬁciently occurred at endocytic sites in motor mutants in vivo and motor mutant defects could not be rescued by increasing NPF activity with the bbc1 D mu - tant . Signiﬁcantly , Myo5p motor mutants blocked endo - cytic coat inward movement , the same step blocked by NPF mutants defective in Arp2 / 3 activation . Therefore , we propose that motor and NPF activities function to - gether to promote endocytic membrane invagination . Experimental Procedures Plasmids and Strains Plasmids and yeast strains used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2 , respectively . C - terminal GFP and RFP tags were integrated by homologous recombination , as described previously ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Growth of Myo5 - GFP myo3 D , Vrp1 - GFP , and wild - type strains were indistinguishable , demonstrating that the tagged pro - teins are functional .

Barbed end concentrations nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex were calcu - lated with the rate of actin polymerization at 50 % polymerization and a k + of 8 . 7 m M 2 1 s 2 1 , as described previously ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was used unless otherwise noted .

Myosin Gliding Assay Myo5p ( 200 nM ) was bound to a nitrocellulose - coated coverslip for 4 min , and the coverslip was subsequently blocked with 0 . 5 % BSA for 1 min . Rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) stabilized actin ﬁlaments ( 160 nM ) were bound to Myo5p on the coverslip in the ab - sence of ATP . The motility reaction was initiated by adding ATP ( 2 mM ) and was immediately visualized by using an Olympus IX - 71 ﬂuorescence microscope , with a 100 3 / NA 1 . 4 objective , and an Orca - ER camera .
