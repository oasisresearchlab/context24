Disruption of the Abl2 / Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinase in mice compromises 18 spine stability and size . We provide evidence that binding to cortactin tethers Abl2 in spines , 19 where Abl2 and cortactin maintain the small pool of stable actin required for dendritic spine 20 stability . Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP - actin , we find that disruption 21 of Abl2 : cortactin interactions eliminates stable actin filaments in dendritic spines , significantly 22 reducing spine density . A subset of spines remaining after Abl2 depletion retain their stable actin 23 pool and undergo activity - dependent spine enlargement associated with increased cortactin 24 levels . Finally , tonic increases in synaptic activity rescue spine loss upon Abl2 depletion by 25 promoting cortactin enrichment in vulnerable spines . Together , our findings strongly suggest 26 Abl2 : cortactin interactions promote spine stability by maintaining pools of stable actin filaments in 27 spines . 28 3 Introduction 29 Dendritic spines are protrusions that extend from dendrites and serve as receptive post - 30 synaptic compartments on excitatory neurons . Defects in dendritic spine formation , spine density 31 and spine shape are hallmarks of many brain disorders ( Blanpied & Ehlers , 2004 ; Fiala , Spacek , 32 & Harris , 2002 ; Herms & Dorostkar , 2016 ; Hu , Shih , Shih , & Hsueh , 2016 ; Y . C . Lin & Koleske , 33 2010 ; Penzes , Cahill , Jones , VanLeeuwen , & Woolfrey , 2011 ; Spence & Soderling , 2015 ; van 34 Spronsen & Hoogenraad , 2010 ) . Spine shape and stability are principally supported by a 35 filamentous actin network , which also organizes scaffolding proteins and neurotransmitter 36 receptors at the post - synaptic density ( Alvarez & Sabatini , 2007 ; Fischer , Kaech , Knutti , & Matus , 37 1998 ; Hotulainen & Hoogenraad , 2010 ; W . H . Lin & Webb , 2009 ; Schubert & Dotti , 2007 ) . Spine 38 actin filaments are assembled into higher - order structures that undergo dynamic rearrangements 39 and provide the forces to drive changes in spine shape and size ( Chazeau & Giannone , 2016 ; 40 Luo , 2002 ; Matus , 2000 ; Matus , Brinkhaus , & Wagner , 2000 ; Sekino , Kojima , & Shirao , 2007 ) . 41 Indeed , molecules that regulate spine plasticity and stability , including cell surface receptors and 42 kinases , often converge on signaling pathways that control the polymerization , stability , and 43 contractility of actin networks . Therefore , the cytoskeletal machinery is a key module to regulate 44 spine plasticity and stability . 45 Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments of GFP - actin have 46 determined that most ( 80 - 85 % ) spine actin filaments are dynamic , undergoing ongoing 47 polymerization and turnover within 10s of seconds , while the remainder of actin ( 10 - 20 % ) is more 48 stable . These distinct kinetic pools of actin likely play unique roles in the spine . Dynamic filaments 49 mediate a net retrograde flow of actin from the spine periphery toward the spine core and are 50 perfectly positioned to promote changes in spine size and shape ( Frost , Shroff , Kong , Betzig , & 51 Blanpied , 2010 ; Honkura , Matsuzaki , Noguchi , Ellis - Davies , & Kasai , 2008 ) and also regulate 52 neurotransmitter receptor localization or gating properties ( Borgdorff & Choquet , 2002 ; Kerr & 53 Blanpied , 2012 ; Rosenmund & Westbrook , 1993 ) . Photoactivation of mEOS3 . 2 - actin reveals that 54 the small stable pool of actin is enriched at the spine base and turns over much more slowly ( t 55 ~ 17 minutes ) ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ) . The relative proportion of actin in this stable pool increases 56 during synapse maturation ( Koskinen , Bertling , Hotulainen , Tanhuanpaa , & Hotulainen , 2014 ) . 57 This stable pool may serve as a base for polymerization of new actin during spine enlargement 58 ( Mikhaylova et al . , 2018 ) . The functions of the stable actin pool have been largely understudied , 59 primarily because we lack an in - depth understanding of the molecules and mechanisms that 60 regulate it . 61 4 The Abl2 / Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinase interacts with its substrate and binding partner 62 cortactin to regulate actin - based structures in many cellular contexts ( MacGrath & Koleske , 63 2012b ; Schnoor , Stradal , & Rottner , 2018 ) . Both proteins localize to dendritic spines where they 64 promote spine stability ( Hering & Sheng , 2003 ; Iki , Inoue , Bito , & Okabe , 2005 ; Y . C . Lin , Yeckel , 65 & Koleske , 2013 ; MacGillavry , Kerr , Kassner , Frost , & Blanpied , 2016 ; Mikhaylova et al . , 2018 ; 66 Sfakianos et al . , 2007 ) . Abl2 binds actin filaments cooperatively ( Wang , Miller , Mooseker , & 67 Koleske , 2001 ) and increases the binding stoichiometry of cortactin for actin filaments ( MacGrath 68 & Koleske , 2012a ) . These interactions significantly impact actin filament stability – at saturated 69 binding , Abl2 and cortactin each stabilize actin filaments ( Courtemanche , Gifford , Simpson , 70 Pollard , & Koleske , 2015 ; Scherer , Anand , & Koleske , 2018 ) , but mixtures of Abl2 and cortactin 71 at concentrations far below saturated binding also stabilize actin filaments ( Courtemanche et al . , 72 2015 ) . While Abl2 and cortactin synergize to stabilize actin filaments in vitro , it is unclear whether 73 or how they contribute to actin stability in neurons or how this mechanism might impact dendritic 74 spine shape or stability . 75 Here , we provide evidence that cortactin anchors Abl2 in dendritic spines via an 76 SH2 : phosphotyrosine interface , and mutational disruption of this interface dislodges Abl2 from 77 spines . Depletion of either protein eliminates the pool of stable actin in spines , as measured by 78 FRAP of GFP - actin . Disruption of this stable pool correlates with a significant loss of dendritic 79 spines . We find that a subset of spines remaining after Abl2 depletion exhibit increased spine 80 head widths , which is tightly associated with increased cortactin levels and retention of the stable 81 actin pool . Finally , tonic increases in activity can rescue spine loss upon Abl2 depletion by 82 promoting cortactin enrichment in vulnerable spines that are otherwise lost in basal conditions . 83 Together , our data indicate that Abl2 and cortactin synergize to maintain dendritic spine stable 84 actin , which is critical for spine stability . 85 5 Results 86 Abl2 kinase activity and SH2 domains are critical for Abl2 enrichment in dendritic spines . 87 Abl2 is a large multidomain protein that contains N - terminal Src homology ( SH ) 3 , SH2 , and 88 kinase domains , followed by a C - terminal extension that contains a proline rich PXXP segment , 89 and two F - actin binding domains flanking a microtubule - binding domain ( Figure 1A ) . When 90 expressed in wild type neurons , Abl2 - RFP preferentially localizes to spines . While Abl2 KD 91 decreases spine density , overexpression does not alter spine density ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) . To 92 study the relative contributions of different Abl2 protein domains to its spine enrichment , we 93 expressed different RFP - tagged Abl2 point and truncation mutants ( Figure 1A ) along with GFP 94 as a cell fill ( Figure 1B , C ) . Consistent with previous studies ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) , we find Abl2 - 95 RFP is enriched approximately 2 - fold in spines relative to dendritic shafts in control neurons 96 ( Figure 1B , C ) . The Abl2 N - terminal half ( Abl2 N - term - RFP ) , which contains the SH3 , SH2 , and 97 kinase domains was enriched in spines to a similar extent as full - length Abl2 , while the Abl2 C - 98 terminal half ( Abl2 C - term - RFP ) was not ( Figure 1B , C ) . A kinase - inactive point mutant of Abl2 99 ( Abl2 - KI - YFP ) exhibited significantly less enrichment ( Figure 1C ) , supporting a key role for kinase 100 activity in proper localization of Abl2 to dendritic spines . We also mutated the Abl2 SH2 domain 101 ( R198K ) to abrogate binding to phospho - tyrosine - containing binding partners ( Lapetina , Mader , 102 Machida , Mayer , & Koleske , 2009 ; Simpson et al . , 2015 ) , both in full length Abl2 and in Abl2 N - 103 term ( Figure 1A ) . While both mutants were present in spines , neither was enriched relative to the 104 dendrite shaft ( Figure 1B , C ) . Together , these data indicate that Abl2 requires both its kinase 105 activity and SH2 domains to support its preferential localization to dendritic spines . 106 107 Abl2 kinase activity and SH2 domains are required for dendritic spine maintenance . 108 We previously showed that knockdown of Abl2 in hippocampal neurons caused progressive 109 reduction of dendritic spines over 72 hours and enlargement of a subset of remaining spines ( Y . 110 C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) . These defects were rescued by re - expression of the shRNA - resistant Abl2 . 111 We used this complementation assay to determine which domains of Abl2 are important to 112 maintain normal dendritic spine density ( Figure 1A ) . Similar to our previous work ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 113 2013 ) , we found that Abl2 KD yielded a 65 ± 8 % decrease in spine density after 72 hours and the 114 full - length shRNA - resistant Abl2 - YFP restored spine density to levels observed in the vector alone 115 control . Re - expression of the kinase - inactive ( Abl2 - KI - YFP ) and SH2 domain mutant ( Abl2 - 116 R198K - YFP ) failed to rescue spine density ( Figure 1D ) , which paralleled their lack of enrichment 117 in dendritic spines ( Figure 1C ) . Surprisingly , the Abl2 N - term - YFP , which completely lacks the C - 118 terminal actin binding domains , was sufficient to support normal dendritic spine density , while the 119 6 Abl2 C - terminal half ( Abl2 - C - term - YFP ) did not ( Figure 1D ) . Abl2 constructs that are enriched in 120 dendritic spines ( Figure 1C ) support spine densities ( Figure 1D ) similar to WT Abl2 , while mutants 121 that disrupt spine enrichment do not support normal spine density ( summarized in Table 1 ) . Hence , 122 Abl2 localization to dendritic spines is critical for spine stability . 123 124 Cortactin tethers Abl2 in dendritic spines to support normal dendritic spine density . 125 Abl2 kinase activity and phosphotyrosine - binding by its SH2 domain are necessary for Abl2 to 126 both localize to dendritic spines and support normal dendritic spine density , but the critical 127 partners for Abl2 in these processes are unknown . Abl2 and cortactin co - localize to actin rich 128 protrusions in a variety of cellular contexts and reciprocal interactions between the two proteins 129 have been well characterized ( Courtemanche et al . , 2015 ; Gifford et al . , 2014 ; Y . C . Lin et al . , 130 2013 ; Liu , MacGrath , Koleske , & Boggon , 2012 ) . The cortactin SH3 domain binds to a specific 131 Pro - X - X - Pro - X - X - Pro motif unique to Abl2 ( Lapetina et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Subsequent 132 Abl2 - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin on tyrosine ( Y ) 421 and Y466 creates binding sites for 133 the Abl2 SH2 domain ( Gifford et al . , 2014 ) . 134 We asked whether Abl2 enrichment in spines depends on cortactin , and if so , whether 135 interactions between the proteins are critical for their enrichment . We designed two shRNAs 136 predicted to target cortactin : shcort # 1 and shcort # 2 . Transfection of shcort # 1 in HEK - 293 cells 137 resulted in a 74 ± 9 % ( difference of means ± SEM ) reduction of a mouse cortactin - RFP fusion 138 protein . Shcort # 2 did not impact cortactin - RFP expression ( Figure 2A , C ) , therefore we used 139 shcort # 1 ( shcort ) to knock down cortactin in subsequent experiments . Levels of an shRNA - 140 resistant cortactin ( cort r - RFP ) , bearing silent mutations that disrupted interaction with shcort # 1 , 141 were unchanged up to 72 hrs after transfection with shcort # 1 ( Figure 2B , C ) . 142 We knocked down Abl2 or cortactin in cultured hippocampal neurons to examine how 143 these manipulations impacted the subcellular localization of its reciprocal binding partner . 144 Consistent with Figure 1C and previous studies , we find Abl2 - RFP and cort - RFP are enriched 145 approximately 2 - fold in dendritic spines relative to shafts in control neurons ( Figure 2D , E ) . The 146 enrichment of Abl2 - RFP in dendritic spines relative to the dendritic shaft was decreased by 45 ± 147 14 % ( Figure 2D ) in cortactin KD neurons , demonstrating that spine enrichment of Abl2 is strongly 148 dependent on the presence of cortactin . These data indicate that cortactin is an important tether 149 for Abl2 in dendritic spines . In contrast , the relative enrichment of cortactin - RFP in dendritic spines 150 was reduced by 17 ± 8 % in Abl2 KD neurons ( Figure 2E ) ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) . Abl2 KD neurons 151 re - expressing full length Abl2 or Abl2 N - term also exhibited a 2 - fold enrichment of cort - EYFP in 152 7 spines ( Figure 2F , G ) , an enrichment similar to that observed in control neurons ( Figure 2E ) , 153 indicating that cortactin enrichment in spines only partially depends on Abl2 . 154 We next examined the critical determinants in cortactin required for its enrichment in 155 spines and its ability to support Abl2 enrichment in spines . We first measured the enrichment of 156 shRNA resistant cortactin - RFP and mutant constructs in neurons following treatment with shcort 157 ( Figure 3A - C ) . Cortactin bearing non - phosphorylatable tyrosine - to - phenylalanine substitutions at 158 Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 ( 3YFcort r - RFP , Figure 3A ) was enriched in spines more than WT cort r - 159 RFP ( Figure 3B , C ) . Given that cortactin employs its SH3 domain to engage Abl2 ( Lapetina et al . , 160 2009 ) , as well as other synaptic proteins ( Chen & Hsueh , 2012 ; MacGillavry et al . , 2016 ; 161 Mikhaylova et al . , 2018 ) , we mutated the conserved tryptophan residue in the cortactin SH3 162 domain to alanine ( W525A ) , which disrupts its binding to the Abl2 Pro - X - X - Pro - X - X - Pro motif 163 ( Figure 3A ) . When introduced into cortactin KD neurons , the W525Acort r - RFP was depleted from 164 spines as compared to WT cort r - RFP ( Figure 3B , C ) . Thus , the cortactin SH3 domain is a major 165 tether for its spine enrichment , while mutation of the three tyrosine residues does not impact 166 cortactin enrichment in spines . 167 Cortactin KD neurons exhibited a 31 ± 8 % reduction in spine density ( Figure 3D ) , a slightly 168 larger reduction to that previously reported ( Hering & Sheng , 2003 ) . Expression of W525Acort r - 169 RFP , which did not enrich in spines , did not rescue this reduction in dendritic spine density ( Figure 170 3D ) . Interestingly , even though it was more enriched in spines than cort r - RFP , 3YFcort r - RFP did 171 not rescue the reduction in dendritic spine density resulting from cortactin KD ( Figure 3D , 172 summarized in Table 1 ) . Phosphorylation of Y421 or Y466 is necessary for Abl2 binding to 173 cortactin both in vitro and in cells , suggesting that this deficit in dendritic spine density could result 174 from decreased Abl2 : cortactin interaction in dendritic spines . 175 To test if disrupted cortactin phosphorylation impaired spine stability by impacting Abl2 176 tethering in spines , we co - expressed Abl2 - EGFP with cort r - RFP or 3YFcort r - RFP in cortactin KD 177 neurons and performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis on Abl2 - 178 EGFP ( Figure 3E - H ) . When co - expressed with cort r - RFP a high proportion ( 45 . 9 ± 1 . 1 % , Figure 179 3F , G ) of Abl2 - EGFP does not recover , indicating stable tethering in the spine . The dynamic Abl2 - 180 EGFP pool exhibits slow , one - phase recovery ( t = 39 . 5 ± 2 . 4 s , Figure 3F , H ) . However , co - 181 expression of Abl2 - EGFP with 3YFcort r - RFP resulted in a reduction of the stable pool of Abl2 - 182 EGFP ( 7 . 7 ± 0 . 7 % , Figure 3F , G ) and faster turnover of the dynamic proportion ( t = 19 . 0 ± 0 . 7 s , 183 Figure 3F , H ) , indicating reduced Abl2 tethering within spines . These data , together with the 184 findings that the kinase - inactive Abl2 and phospho - cortactin - binding defective Abl2 - R198K 185 mutant do not support normal spine density ( Figure 1D ) strongly suggest that Abl2 - mediated 186 8 cortactin phosphorylation and subsequent Abl2 binding to phospho - cortactin , promotes Abl2 187 tethering within the spine , thereby promoting dendritic spine stability ( summarized in Table 1 ) . 188 189 Abl2 and cortactin are required to maintain the stable actin pool in dendritic spines . 190 Cortactin - mediated enrichment of Abl2 into dendritic spines is critical to maintain normal dendritic 191 spine density ( Figure 1D and 3D ) . However , this raised the central mechanistic question of 192 whether and how the regulation of actin polymerization and stability by Abl2 and / or cortactin is 193 important to promote normal spine density . Thus , we asked whether alterations in these proteins 194 impacted actin levels and turnover and how these alterations relate to changes in net dendritic 195 spine density , as well as spine size . First , we measured filamentous actin levels using Atto647N - 196 phalloidin staining of fixed cells and quantified regions of interest corresponding to dendritic 197 spines , guided by expression of RFP that revealed neuronal structure ( Figure 4A , B ) . Although 198 filamentous actin levels were broadly distributed among spines , we did not observe shifts in the 199 distribution of total actin levels under any condition ( Figure 4B ) . 200 We also performed FRAP analyses on GFP - actin to test whether manipulation of Abl2 or 201 cortactin impacted the relative proportions of dynamic vs . stable actin content of the spine , and 202 how this related to alterations in spine size or density ( Figure 4C - F ) . Actin recovery time constants 203 are best fit to a two phase recovery ( Koskinen , Bertling , & Hotulainen , 2012 ; Star , Kwiatkowski , 204 & Murthy , 2002 ) : a fast component representing diffusion of GFP - actin monomers into the 205 bleached spine ( t monomer = ~ 1 . 5 - 3 s ) and a slower component representing GFP - actin incorporation 206 into the dynamic polymerizing actin network . The small unrecovered fraction represents stable 207 actin that recovers on the order of 10s of minutes . 208 Consistent with previous reports ( Koskinen et al . , 2012 ; Koskinen & Hotulainen , 2014 ; 209 Star et al . , 2002 ) , we found that 13 . 9 ± 1 . 0 % of the GFP - actin fluorescence did not recover ( stable 210 fraction ) after photobleaching ( Figure 4C - E ) . Abl2 or cortactin KD results in a complete recovery 211 of GFP - actin fluorescence ( Figure 4D , E ) , indicating , at the population level , that loss of Abl2 and 212 cortactin yield spines that lack a stable actin pool . Re - expression of Abl2 r - RFP or cort r - RFP 213 restored the pool of stable actin when expressed in Abl2 or cortactin KD neurons , respectively 214 ( Figure 4D , E ) . Interestingly , complementation of Abl2 KD neurons with Abl2 N - term - RFP , which 215 rescued dendritic spine loss and cortactin enrichment in spines , also completely rescued the 216 stable actin pool ( Figure 4Di , E ) . Unexpectedly , rescue with the Abl2 N - term - RFP also increased 217 the recovery rate of the dynamic pool ( t control = 30 . 5 ± 4 . 1 s , t Abl2 N - term = 12 . 1 ± 0 . 4 s , Figure 4Di , F ) . 218 This may result from the elevated expression levels and consequently elevated kinase activity of 219 Abl2 N - term compared to full - length Abl2 ( Peacock et al . , 2007 ) . 220 9 We next tested how disruption of cortactin phosphorylation impacts GFP - actin turnover . 221 Complementation of cortactin KD neurons with 3YFcort r - RFP yielded partial rescue of the stable 222 actin pool ( Stable fraction = 13 . 9 ± 1 . 0 % for control and 6 . 6 ± 1 . 1 % for 3YFcort r - RFP , Figure 223 4Dii , E ) . 3YFcort r - RFP did not fully rescue dendritic spine density ( Figure 3D ) , indicating that the 224 remaining stable actin pool is not sufficient to stabilize spines . These data demonstrate that Abl2 225 and cortactin are novel key regulators of the stable actin pool in dendritic spines . 226 227 Loss of Abl2 and cortactin differentially impact small versus large dendritic spines . 228 Previous measurements of actin turnover in dendritic spines show that the amount of stable actin 229 is proportional to the spine volume squared ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ) . A subset of remaining spines 230 following Abl2 depletion exhibited gradual spine head size enlargement ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ; 231 Xiao , Levy , Rosenberg , Higley , & Koleske , 2016 ) . These findings led us to examine how changes 232 in actin pool sizes and recovery kinetics correlated with spine head size . For each spine analyzed , 233 we measured the full - width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) of the spine head in the pre - bleach frames 234 and took the average of those frames to approximate individual spine head widths ( Figure 5A ) . 235 The distribution of spine head widths of photobleached spines was significantly broader in the 236 Abl2 KD condition than in control spines ( Figure 5B ) , consistent with measurements made 237 previously ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) . In notable contrast , the distribution of spine head widths for 238 cortactin KD photobleached spines were not significantly different from control spines ( Figure 5C ) . 239 These differences in the populations of spine head widths raise the question of whether spines of 240 different head sizes exhibit differences in the stable pool in Abl2 - or cortactin - KD neurons . 241 To test how the relative size of the stable actin pool related to spine size , we segmented 242 our FRAP dataset based on spine head widths and classified small spines based on FWHM < 0 . 6 243 µ m and large spines with FWHM > 0 . 8 µ m , less than and greater than one standard deviation 244 from the control mean , respectively . Small and large spines in the control and cortactin KD 245 datasets represent approximately 25 % of the total population of spines analyzed in Figure 4 . 246 However , for the Abl2 KD dataset , small spines account for approximately 20 % of the total 247 population , while large spines are 40 % . Small Abl2 KD spines , as well as both small and large 248 cortactin KD spines , exhibited significantly smaller stable actin pools as compared to their 249 respective control ( Figure 5D , E ) , consistent with the pooled data in Figure 4D , E . Dynamic actin 250 turnover rates were not significantly changed in any of these conditions ( Figure 5F ) . The stable 251 pool size trended toward an increase in larger spine head widths , consistent with a previous report 252 ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 5Dii , E ) , although we could not establish significance in our data set 253 due to the small number of large spines in the control neuron comparison group . Large Abl2 KD 254 10 spines had a significantly larger stable actin pool than small Abl2 KD spines , and this was not 255 significantly different from the stable actin pool size in large control spines ( Figure 5Dii , E ) . 256 Together , these data suggest that while cortactin is absolutely required to maintain the stable 257 actin pool in all spines , the subset of large spines in Abl2 - deficient neurons retain the stable actin 258 pool . 259 The remaining stable actin pool in large Abl2 KD spines suggested that there may be an 260 Abl2 - independent enrichment of cortactin in these large spines , that enables actin stabilization . 261 To determine if cortactin enrichment in Abl2 KD spines correlates with spine head size , we 262 quantified the FWHM and cort - RFP spine enrichment for spines on Abl2 KD neurons ( Figure 5G ) . 263 We found a positive Pearson Correlation ( r = 0 . 58 ) between spine size and cortactin enrichment . 264 In cortactin KD neurons reconstituted with cort r - RFP , there is no significant correlation between 265 spine head width and cortactin spine enrichment ( Figure 5H ) . This suggests that elevated 266 cortactin levels in large Abl2 KD spines are sufficient to support a stable actin pool and protect 267 these spines from destabilization . 268 The 3YFcort mutant is enriched in spines to a greater extent than WT cort ( Figure 3C ) , but 269 it untethers Abl2 from spines ( Figure 3F - H ) and only partially rescues the stable actin pool ( Figure 270 4Dii , E ) , resulting in a lower spine density ( Figure 3D ) . Therefore , we used the parsing method 271 above to document and quantify the Abl2 - independent enrichment of cortactin , using 3YFcort r - 272 RFP , and how this correlated with actin stability in large versus small spines of Abl2 KD neurons . 273 Similar to cortactin spine enrichment in Abl2 KD neurons , 3YFcort r - RFP spine enrichment is 274 positively correlated with spine head size ( Pearson correlation r = 0 . 51 ) ( Figure 5I ) . Furthermore , 275 a significant proportion of small spines do not show spine enrichment of 3YFcort r - RFP ( Figure 276 5J ) . Given differential enrichment of 3YFcort in small versus large spines , we performed GFP - 277 actin FRAP in these small and large spines ( Figure 5K ) . While in aggregate , the 3YFcort r - RFP 278 data had a partial rescue of the stable actin pool ( Figure 4Dii , E ) , we found that small spines had 279 no stable actin pool , similar to cort KD neurons , and large spines had stable actin pools 280 comparable in size to spines in control neurons ( Stable fraction = 14 . 6 ± 1 . 8 % , Figure 5L ) . No 281 significant changes in the dynamic actin turnover were observed in the cort KD + 3YFcort r - RFP 282 spines irrespective of size ( Figure 5M ) . These data indicate that even while cortactin tethering of 283 Abl2 is important for maintaining small dendritic spines , in the absence of Abl2 , cortactin 284 associates with another determinant in the spine that scales with spine size . 285 286 Tonic enhancement of synaptic activity rescues cortactin depletion and spine loss in Abl2 287 KD neurons . 288 11 Synaptic activity bidirectionally reorganizes the molecular composition and structure of 289 dendritic spines . Actin is a major substrate for bidirectional plasticity , as changes in actin 290 dynamics rapidly correlate with changes in dendritic spine structure ( Fukazawa et al . , 2003 ; 291 Okamoto , Nagai , Miyawaki , & Hayashi , 2004 ) . Moreover , manipulations of activity modulate the 292 translocation of cortactin and other synaptic proteins into and out of the spine ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; 293 Hering & Sheng , 2003 ; Iki et al . , 2005 ; K . Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Given the impact of Abl2 and cortactin 294 on the stable actin pool ( Figure 4 , 5 ) and this unique link between spine head size and cortactin 295 spine enrichment in Abl2 - deficient neurons ( Figure 5G - M ) , we asked whether tonic changes in 296 activity impacted these phenotypes . 297 During the duration of Abl2 KD , we treated cultured neurons with either 1 µM tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) 298 or 20 µM bicuculline to ask how chronic blockade or enhancement of activity , respectively , 299 modulated dendritic spine density , cortactin localization and gross changes in dendritic spine 300 structure ( Figure 6A ) . There was no significant difference in the dendritic spine density of TTX 301 and bicuculline treated control neurons ( Figure 6C ) . TTX did not impact Abl2 deficient neurons – 302 compared to control transfected cells , they had a significantly reduced dendritic spine density 303 ( Figure 6B , C ; left ) and a 31 ± 10 % reduced spine enrichment of cortactin ( Figure 6B , D ; left ) , 304 similar to untreated Abl2 - deficient neurons ( Figure 2E ) . Interestingly , tonically increasing activity 305 with bicuculline rescued the reduced spine density in Abl2 KD neurons ( Figure 6B , C ; right ) and 306 maintained cortactin enrichment in these spines ( Figure 6B , D ; right ) . Bicuculline treatment also 307 normalized the spine head width distribution in Abl2 KD neurons to mirror the head widths 308 observed in control neurons – the distribution of spine head widths was no longer right shifted 309 ( Figure 6E , right ) , reflecting that loss of Abl2 no longer results in a significant enlargement of spine 310 heads . These data indicate that tonically increasing activity compensates for Abl2 deficiency . TTX 311 did not impact net cortactin depletion from spines or net spine loss in Abl2 KD neurons , but it 312 normalized spine head size ( Figure 6E , left ) . Consistent with normalization of dendritic spine head 313 widths in Abl2 KD neurons by both TTX and bicuculline , we no longer observed the correlation 314 between spine head width and cortactin spine enrichment ( Figure 6F ) observed in Abl2 KD 315 neurons in basal conditions ( Figure 5G ) . 316 12 Discussion 317 Reductions in dendritic spine density are associated with cognitive , perceptual , and affective 318 deficits in psychiatric , neurodevelopmental , and neurodegenerative disorders . The actin 319 cytoskeleton , consisting of both dynamic and stable pools , is a major determinant of spine 320 structure and stability . Here , we identify Abl2 and cortactin as key regulators of the stable actin 321 pool in dendritic spines . We show that disruption of Abl2 SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated 322 cortactin reduces enrichment of both proteins in spines and disrupts the stable actin pool . Loss of 323 the stable actin pool is associated with significant reductions in spine density . Curiously , we also 324 find that a small subset of larger spines in Abl2 - deficient neurons exhibit increased cortactin 325 recruitment and a stable actin pool , suggesting that cortactin acts via both Abl2 - dependent and 326 independent mechanisms . Together our results define new key regulators of the stable actin pool 327 in spines and demonstrate the importance of stable actin in regulating spine shape and stability . 328 329 A role for stable actin in dendritic spine stability . 330 Consistent with previous measurements , we find that only a small fraction of spine actin is stable 331 ( Fukazawa et al . , 2003 ; Honkura et al . , 2008 ; Koskinen et al . , 2014 ; Star et al . , 2002 ) . This stable 332 actin pool appears to localize to the spine base ( Fukazawa et al . , 2003 ) , where cortactin has also 333 been shown to concentrate ( Racz & Weinberg , 2004 ) . We demonstrate that depletion of the stable 334 actin pool is tightly associated with decreased dendritic spine stability and overall decreased spine 335 density . Although stable actin is not very abundant in dendritic spines , it seems to play a major 336 role in dendritic spine stability , raising the fundamental question of how it contributes to spine 337 homeostasis . 338 The ongoing maintenance of spine shape and synaptic transmission requires continual 339 dynamic actin polymerization and turnover ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ; C . H . Kim & Lisman , 1999 ; K . 340 Kim et al . , 2015 ; Krucker , Siggins , & Halpain , 2000 ) . It is possible that these dynamic actin 341 filaments use the stable actin pool as a base for their nucleation . In maturing synapses , this 342 dynamic pool also undergoes continual retrograde flow ( Koskinen et al . , 2014 ) , which likely exerts 343 force on the stable pool at the spine base . Here , the stable pool may play a supporting role to 344 resist this force and stabilize the spine . The size of the stable pool scales with spine size ( Honkura 345 et al . , 2008 ; Koskinen et al . , 2012 ) , consistent with possible roles as a support structure for the 346 peripheral dynamic pool . Additionally , large bundles of actin filaments are enmeshed with the 347 spine apparatus in a subset of spines ( Capani , Martone , Deerinck , & Ellisman , 2001 ) . Although 348 the function of the spine apparatus remains enigmatic , dendritic spines containing a spine 349 apparatus are larger and have more potent synapses ( Holbro , Grunditz , & Oertner , 2009 ) . 350 13 Furthermore , only spines that contain a spine apparatus grow during cLTP ( Borczyk , Sliwinska , 351 Caly , Bernas , & Radwanska , 2019 ; Deller et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , the stable actin pool may 352 support the spine apparatus to promote spine stability . Previous work from Mikhaylova et al . 353 demonstrated caldendrin depletion also results in a loss of the stable actin pool and spine 354 plasticity deficits ( Mikhaylova et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , caldendrin depletion enhances cortactin 355 turnover in dendritic spines , suggesting that these changes in spine actin stability may be the 356 indirect result of cortactin loss from spines . 357 358 How do Abl2 and cortactin maintain the stable pool of actin in spines ? 359 We show here that Abl2 and cortactin are essential to maintain the stable actin pool in dendritic 360 spines . Although Abl2 and cortactin can each independently bind and stabilize actin filaments , 361 they synergize at much lower binding stoichiometries in vitro ( Courtemanche et al . , 2015 ; Scherer 362 et al . , 2018 ) . The Abl2 N - terminal half , which neither binds actin nor promotes cortactin binding 363 to actin , is sufficient to support the stable actin pool in Abl2 - deficient neurons . The Abl2 kinase 364 domain , located in the protein’s N - terminus , phosphorylates cortactin , creating a binding site for 365 the Abl2 SH2 domain . Mutation of this interface , either via point mutations to the Abl2 SH2 domain 366 or the cortactin phosphorylation sites , reduces the stable actin pool and leads to spine loss . We 367 hypothesize that Abl2 phosphorylation and tethering to cortactin keeps it in the spine , promoting 368 interactions with actin and possibly other proteins that are critical for it to maintain the stable actin 369 pool . We also find that the nonphosphorylatable ( 3YF ) cortactin is more enriched in spines , and 370 Abl2 is more dynamic in spines reconstituted with 3YFcort . Uncoupling from Abl2 may free up 371 3YFcortactin to interact with other binding partners in the spine , including , but not limited to , the 372 Shank family of proteins ( MacGillavry et al . , 2016 ) . 373 We also found that rescue of Abl2 with the Abl2 N - terminus yields much faster dynamic 374 actin recovery . The Abl2 N - terminus expresses at elevated levels over Abl2 , yielding increased 375 Abl2 kinase activity ( Peacock , Couch , & Koleske , 2010 ) . In addition to cortactin , Abl family kinases 376 phosphorylate N - WASp and WAVE2 ( M . M . Miller et al . , 2010 ; Stuart , Gonzalez , Kawai , & Yuan , 377 2006 ) , which can both activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Martinez - Quiles , Ho , Kirschner , Ramesh , & 378 Geha , 2004 ) . Abl2 also phosphorylates the RhoA inhibitor p190RhoGAP ( Sfakianos et al . , 2007 ) , 379 which attenuates RhoA / ROCK signaling and could activate actin severing by cofilin ( Bravo - 380 Cordero et al . , 2011 ) . Increasing Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branching and cofilin severing would both 381 result in increases in dynamic turnover . 382 383 How do large Abl2 - deficient spines retain a stable actin pool ? 384 14 Depletion of Abl2 results in a significant loss of cortactin from spines and overall spine loss ( Y . C . 385 Lin et al . , 2013 ; Xiao et al . , 2016 ) . Curiously , while net spine stability is decreased in Abl2 - deficient 386 neurons , a subset of the remaining spines enlarge ( Figure 5 ) . These large spines retain a stable 387 actin pool and are enriched for cortactin . Previous work has also shown that the enlarged subset 388 of spines in Abl2 - deficient mice have larger GluN2B - mediated NMDAR currents ( Xiao et al . , 389 2016 ) . We find that tonically increasing synaptic activity with bicuculline rescues cortactin spine 390 enrichment in Abl2 KD neurons and overall dendritic spine stability ( Figure 7 ) and blocking 391 presynaptic release with TTX prevents spine head enlargement . Paradoxically , other studies have 392 shown NMDAR stimulation causes cortactin to redistribute from spines to dendrite shafts ( Hering 393 & Sheng , 2003 ; Iki et al . , 2005 ) , although it is unclear which class of NMDA receptors trigger 394 cortactin exit from spines . It is clear that in the absence of Abl2 , some large spines retain the 395 ability to maintain cortactin levels and a stable actin pool , suggesting that cortactin may respond 396 differently to NMDARs , possibly dependent on their subunit composition . In addition to Abl2 , 397 cortactin interacts via its SH3 domain with the synaptic scaffolds SHANK2 ( MacGillavry et al . , 398 2016 ) and cortactin - binding protein 2 ( CTTNBP2 ) ( Chen & Hsueh , 2012 ) , suggesting that these 399 large spines may tether cortactin by either of these proteins . Also , the cortactin repeats region of 400 cortactin , which binds and stabilizes actin filaments ( Scherer et al . , 2018 ; Weed et al . , 2000 ) , is 401 sufficient to localize cortactin in spines ( Hering & Sheng , 2003 ) , suggesting that interactions with 402 actin may be sufficient . Neurotrophic cues , such as BNDF , have been proposed to drive cortactin 403 into spines ( Iki et al . , 2005 ) , where it would be able to interact with actin filaments . Therefore , 404 retaining cortactin localization in spines via tethering to various synaptic scaffolds or even actin 405 itself likely compensates for a loss of Abl2 and its disruption of the stable actin pool . 406 407 A model for Abl2 and cortactin in regulation of spine stable actin . 408 While dendritic spines contain two kinetically distinct pools of spine actin , the function of the stable 409 actin pool has been largely understudied . Our data indicate that phosphorylated cortactin tethers 410 Abl2 , via its SH2 domain , in spines and this interaction is essential in maintaining the stable actin 411 pool ( Figure 7A ) . Upon loss of Abl2 or mutational disruption of phospho - tyrosine residues on 412 cortactin , cortactin is lost from small dendritic spines and becomes enriched in a subset of large 413 spines that retain the stable actin pool . Together , our data strongly support a model in which 414 Abl2 : cortactin interactions are critical for maintenance of the spine stable actin pool . 415 Our data also reveal interesting crosstalk between synaptic activity and the regulation of 416 spine stability via the stable actin pool . Tonic enhancement of synaptic activity in Abl2 - deficient 417 neurons protects against cortactin depletion from spines and net spine loss . This observation 418 15 points to a key activity - dependent mechanism that promotes cortactin enrichment in spines to 419 stabilize them ( Figure 7B ) . Gradual spine loss over days in Abl2 - deficient neurons is accompanied 420 by an enlargement of a subset of remaining spines ( this study ; ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) ) . Disrupting 421 activity , with TTX , in Abl2 KD neurons does not protect against spine loss , but it blocks 422 enlargement , again pointing to an activity - driven process for enriching cortactin in spines . We 423 note that the residual spines that remain on cortactin KD neurons do not enlarge , suggesting a 424 direct role for cortactin in spine enlargement . These observations identify the stable actin pool as 425 a key target of activity - mediated control of net spine size and stability . 426 16 Materials and Methods : 427 Animals 428 All animal procedures were compliant with federal regulations and approved by the Animal Care 429 and Use Committees at Yale University , University of Maryland at Baltimore and Hussman 430 Institute for Autism . Balb / c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories . Animals were 431 housed and cared for in a Yale - sponsored OPRR approved animal facility . Neonatal mice of both 432 sexes were sacrificed for neuronal culture preparation . 433 434 Cell culture and transfections 435 HEK293 cells were plated in 6 - well plates and maintained in high glucose DMEM ( Invitrogen ) 436 growth media supplemented with 1 % pen / strep ( Gibco ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( Gibco ) , and 10 % fetal 437 bovine serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from postnatal day 1 438 mouse hippocampus as previously described ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) . Neurons were maintained 439 in serum free media containing 1 % pen / strep , 2 mM L - glutamine , and 2 % B27 - supplement 440 ( Gibco ) in Neurobasal media ( NB - SFM ) ( Invitrogen ) . Glass coverslips in 24 - well plates were 441 coated with 20 µ g / ml of poly - ( D ) - lysine ( Corning Inc . ) overnight at 37°C and 1 µ g / ml laminin 111 442 ( Corning Inc . ) for 2 hours at 37°C . Neurons were plated at a cell density of 0 . 3x10 6 cell / well . 443 Transfection was performed using a calcium - phosphate precipitation method in both HEK293 444 cells and primary neurons . Tetrodotoxin citrate ( 1 µM ; Tocris ) and 20 µM bicuculine methiodide 445 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were added directly to the culture media immediately following transfection and 446 incubated with neurons 72 h before fixation . 447 448 Plasmids 449 Wild type and Abl2 mutants were constructed in N1 - mRFP plasmid as previously described 450 ( Lapetina et al . , 2009 ; A . L . Miller , Wang , Mooseker , & Koleske , 2004 ; Peacock et al . , 2010 ) . The 451 shRNA - resistant mutations ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) were introduced in WT - Abl2 , Abl2 - KI , Abl2 N - 452 term , and Abl2 - R198K mutants and subcloned into shAbl2 plasmid for the experiment shown in 453 Figure 1 . The shRNA targeted to mouse cortactin was generated by synthesizing two 454 complementary oligonucleotides ( shCort # 1 : 5’ - 455 tgcactgctcacaagtggacttcaagagagtccacttgtgagcagtgcttttttc - 3’ and shCort # 2 : 5’ - 456 tcgagaaaaaagcactgctcacaagtggactctcttgaagtccacttgtgagcagtgca - 3’ ) and cloned into the pLL3 . 7 457 vector ( Rubinson et al . , 2003 ) between HpaI and XhoI sites . Three tyrosine sites at 421 , 466 , and 458 482 were mutated to phenylalanine to make 3YFcortactin mutant as described previously 459 ( Lapetina et al . , 2009 ) . The shRNA resistant cortactin cort r - RFP , 3YFcort r - RFP and W525Acort r - 460 17 RFP constructs were made by mutating three nucleotides in the shCort recognition sequences 461 with two PCR primers : 5’ - cgaagctttccaagcactgctctcaagtcgactccgtccggg - 3’ and 5’ - 462 ccgaagccccggacggagtcgacttgagagcagtgcttgg - 3’ . 463 464 Western Blot Analysis 465 Cells were harvested then lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris ( pH7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM 466 EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails . Protein concentration 467 was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein assay Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . 75 µ g of total protein 468 from HEK293 cell lysates were used in immunoblots to determine the knockdown efficiency . 469 Protein samples were run on a 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 470 immunoblotting with antibodies against RFP ( Invitrogen ) and b - actin ( Abcam ) in TBST containing 471 3 % milk . Densitometry of blotted protein was performed on scanned films using ImageJ ( NIH ) . 472 473 Immunocytochemistry and morphometric analysis 474 Neurons were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 475 and 3 % BSA in PBS . Cells were immunostained with primary antibodies against GFP ( Rockland ) 476 or RFP ( Chemicon ) followed by Alexa488 and 594 conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular 477 Probes ) . For total filamentous actin staining with fluorescent - phalloidin , neurons were fixed with 478 2 % PFA in cytoskeleton buffer ( 10 mM MES pH 6 . 8 , 138 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA and 479 0 . 32 mM sucrose ) . Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0 . 3 % TX100 / TBS ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM 480 Tris pH 7 . 4 ) and blocked with 0 . 1 % TX100 / 2 % BSA / 10 % Normal Donkey Serum / TBS . Cells 481 incubated at 4º C overnight with anti - RFP ( Rockland ) . The cells were then sequentially incubated 482 with Alex594 conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) and Atto647N - phalloidin 483 ( Sigma ) . For dendritic spine analysis , 2 - 3 dendrite segments per neuron were selected randomly 484 from secondary or tertiary branches on the apical dendrite for imaging . Images were taken using 485 a LSM710 confocal microscope with 63x NA 1 . 4 objective and 4x zoom . Dendritic spine density 486 was quantified using ImageJ ( NIH ) . Quantified dendrite segments were averaged for each neuron 487 analyzed and each averaged dendritic spine density for a cell is represented as a sample ( n ) in 488 the graphs . To measure the spine enrichment of cortactin and Abl2 content , a region of interest 489 ( ROI ) was selected in the dendritic spine , adjacent dendrite shaft , and over a region in the 490 background . Spine enrichment was quantified using the following equation : 491 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑖𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 = - 𝑅𝑂𝐼 ! " # $ % − 𝑅𝑂𝐼 & ’ ( ) * + , - $ . 2 - 𝑅𝑂𝐼 ! / ’01 − 𝑅𝑂𝐼 & ’ ( ) * + , - $ . 2 492 18 Spine enrichment was quantified for 4 - 6 spines per neuron then an average was taken for the cell . 493 The average spine enrichment for a neuron is represented as a sample ( n ) in the graphs . 494 495 Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching 496 Dissociated P0 - 1 mouse hippocampal neurons were plated onto 35 - mm glass bottom dishes 497 ( MatTek ) . Cells were transfected using a calcium - phosphate precipitation method at 12 DIV with 498 a 1 : 1 ratio of pN1 - EGFP - human beta - Actin to pLL3 . 7 - shRNA - mRFP plasmids targeting either 499 Abl2 or cortactin . Live - cell FRAP imaging of pyramidal neurons in NB - SFM without phenol red 500 culture medium was performed at 15 DIV – 72 hours after transfection , when we see net spine 501 destabilization in Abl2 KD neurons ( Y . C . Lin et al . , 2013 ) – at 37°C using a 60x oil immersion 502 objective on an UltraVIEW VoX ( Perkin Elmer ) spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with 503 the PhotoKinesis ( PK ) Device . Volocity software ( Improvision , Coventry , UK ) was used to select 504 the bleach ROI over the head of a spine on the secondary or tertiary branch of the apical dendrite . 505 Images were acquired at 3 frames per second ( fps ) for 6 - 10 frames prior to bleaching . Prebleach 506 fluorescence intensities were averaged and normalized to 1 , and the curves were fit with two - 507 phase exponential equations , as described with some modifications detailed below ( Koskinen et 508 al . , 2014 ; Star et al . , 2002 ) . Prior to bleaching , 6 - 10 frames were captured then bleaching was 509 performed using the 488 nm laser at 20 % power with the following Ultraview PK settings : 100 PK 510 cycles , 200 ms spot period and 1 PK spot cycle . During the recovery phase images were acquired 511 at 3 fps for 10 seconds then for the duration of the experiment at 1 fps to increase sample 512 protection and reduce phototoxicity on the sample . 3 - 5 spines / cell were bleached . Background 513 fluorescence was determined in an area outside the cell using a ROI size equal to the bleach ROI . 514 Potential FRAP - unrelated bleaching effects were corrected using a ROI with the same dimensions 515 as the bleach ROI placed in an unbleached area with similar initial fluorescence as the bleach 516 ROI . Fluorescence recovery ( mobile fraction ) over time was calculated by the following two - phase 517 exponential equation : 518 𝑦 = 𝑏 ∗ 𝑐 ∗ & 1 − 𝑒 ! " # ! $ % " % " # $ & ’ * + 𝑏 ∗ ( 1 − 𝑐 ) ∗ & 1 − 𝑒 ! " # % $ % " % " # $ & ’ * 519 where 𝑏 is the plateau , 𝑐 is the fraction of dynamic actin , 𝑘 ( and 𝑘 ) are rate constants with the 520 units inverse seconds and 𝑥 * + , is the time immediately following bleaching . The stable actin 521 fraction is then defined as 1 - 𝑏 and 𝜏 , the time constant for the dynamic actin turnover , is defined 522 as 1 𝑘 ( 1 and has units of seconds . Abl2 FRAP was fit to a one - phase exponential equation that 523 was modified from the above equation by excluding the second term . 524 525 19 Spine head width measurement 526 Spine head width was measured in ImageJ using methods previously published with some 527 modifications ( Adrian , Kusters , Storm , Hoogenraad , & Kapitein , 2017 ; Nagerl , Willig , Hein , Hell , 528 & Bonhoeffer , 2008 ) . In short , spine head width was measured by drawing a line on the short axis 529 of the spine . The fluorescence intensity profile was then plotted and fit to the following gaussian 530 curve : 531 𝑦 = 𝑎 + ( 𝑏 − 𝑎 ) 𝑒 " ( ’ ( ) ) % % + % 532 where 𝑎 is the baseline intensity , 𝑏 is the curve’s peak intensity , 𝑐 is the position of the center of 533 the peak and 𝜎 is the standard deviation . FWHM was then defined as 2 . 35 ∗ 𝜎 . For spine head 534 width measurements from live samples the FWHM was averaged from all pre - bleached frames 535 to account for local drifts of the spine in the focal plane . 536 537 Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis 538 All data were from at least 3 independent neuronal cultures per condition . Imaging and analyses 539 were performed while blinded to experimental conditions . Statistical analyses were performed in 540 GraphPad Prism 8 or R software . Specific details on ‘n’ and statistical tests are included in the 541 figure legends . Significance was defined by a p value less than 0 . 05 and a “ * ” symbol is always 542 used for comparisons to the control group of the dataset . All pooled data are represented as mean 543 ± SEM . Normality of data was checked with a D’Agostino and Pearson normality test where 544 appropriate . In cases with simple genetic manipulations , an unpaired t - test was used . To analyze 545 the effects of knockdown and rescue experiments where many manipulations were performed , 546 we used one - way ANOVA to test for differences between groups . We performed a Pearson 547 Correlation test to test for a relationship between cortactin spine enrichment and spine head width . 548 20 Acknowledgements : We thank Aaron Levy , Josie Bircher , Melissa Carrizales and Amanda 549 Jeng for helpful comments on this manuscript , as well as other members of the Koleske lab for 550 their critical discussion and suggestions .

Model of Abl2 : cortactin regulation of dendritic spine stability . A . At the molecular 878 level , a subset of dendritic spine actin is stable ( dark blue ) , while the majority is highly dynamic 879 ( light blue ) . The Abl2 SH2 : phospho - cortactin interaction is essential in maintaining this pool of 880 stable actin ( top , inset ) . Dendritic spine loss upon Abl2 KD is accompanied by loss of the stable 881 actin pool in these small spines ( bottom , left ) and the redistribution of cortactin to large spines 882 that retain a significant stable actin pool ( bottom , right ) , by an Abl2 - independent mechanism . B . 883 A cellular perspective of how Abl2 and cortactin impact dendritic spines . At homeostasis , dendritic 884 spines are all different sizes and maintain different neurotransmitter and synaptic machinery . Loss 885 of Abl2 results in the gradual loss of cortactin from small spines and their eventual destabilization . 886 Spine loss can be prevented in Abl2 KD neurons by tonically increasing activity . Furthermore , 887 31 spine loss is accompanied by the enlargement of some remaining spines , which can be prevented 888 by blocking presynaptic release . 889 32 Figure 1 . 890 891 Figure 1 .
