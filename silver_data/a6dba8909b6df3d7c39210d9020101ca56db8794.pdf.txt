A network of proteins acting in multi - subunit complexes mediates this dynamic event . Their highly orchestrated assembly , rearrangement and disassembly constitute a key part of the events leading to exocytosis ( Augustine et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1997 ) and may require chaperone function ( Morgan and Burgoyne , 1995 ) . The cysteine - string proteins ( Csps ) belong to the DnaJ family of molecular chaperones and were ﬁrst discovered as presynaptic proteins in Drosophila ( Zinsmaier et al . , 1990 ) . Csps are involved in neurotransmission as deletion of the Csp gene in Drosophila causes a temperature - sensitive block of synaptic transmission ( Umbach et al . , 1994 ; Zinsmaier et al . , 1994 ) . The molecular basis for Csp function in exocytosis is unknown . Extensive homology exists between the N terminus of Csps and the J - domain of the Escherichia coli DnaJ chaperone / heat shock protein family ( Caplan et al . , 1993 ) . In bacteria , the prototypical DnaJ acts in conjunction with the heat - shock protein DnaK , an E . coli Hsp70 , and stimulates hydrolysis of ATP bound to Hsp70 / DnaK , while GrpE acts as nucleotide exchanger , promoting continuous cycles of activity ( for review see Kelley , 1998 ) . The triad DnaJ / DnaK / GrpE has the capacity to modulate the structure of native proteins by controlling their oligomerisation state or their association with interacting proteins . Indeed , the J - domain of Csps themselves behaves as a chaperone and stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc70 ( Braun et al . , 1996 ; Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1997a , b ) . Chaperone function of Csps might be required for the ordered interaction of exocytotic proteins . The J - domain is linked to the cysteine string region by an evolutionarily highly conserved domain . The putative involvement of this linker region in Csp function , however , is unknown . Moreover , two splice variants of Csps have been identiﬁed in mammals , Csp1 and the truncated form Csp2 , which lacks the 31 carboxy - terminal amino acids ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1996 ; Coppola and Gundersen , 1996 ; Mastrogiacomo and Gundersen , 1995 ) . Functional differences between the isoforms have not been described although differential expression of Csp isoforms had been observed in Drosophila ( Eberle et al . , 1998 ) . Insulin release from large dense core vesicles ( LDCVs ) of pancreatic b - cells constitutes an established model for peptide hormone exocytosis ( Wollheim et al . , 1996 ; Lang , 1999 ) . Csp1 is found on insulin - containing secretory granules and its transient overexpression induces a considerable reduction in insulin secretion from clonal b - cells ( Brown et al . , 1998 ; Zhang et al . , 1997 ) . Although this effect was not accompanied by appreciable changes in transmembrane Ca 2 + ﬂuxes ( Brown et al . , 1998 ) , the use of intact cells does not allow assessment 1345 Journal of Cell Science 112 , 1345 - 1351 ( 1999 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1999 JCS0277 Cysteine - string proteins ( Csps ) are vesicle proteins involved in neurotransmission . They contain at least four domains : an N - terminal J - domain which can interact with the chaperone Hsc70 , an adjacent linker region , the deﬁning cysteine rich domain and a variable C terminus . As the relevance of these domains for the function of Csps in exocytosis is unknown , we have performed a mutational analysis of Csp domains using insulin release by large dense core vesicles ( LDCVs ) as a model of regulated exocytosis . All mutants were apparently palmitoylated and their subcellular distribution was similar to endogenous Csp . Point mutations within the highly conserved HPD motif of the J - domain abolished activation of Hsc70 . However , these mutations altered the effect of Csp on exocytosis only after additional truncation of the extreme C terminus as found in the Csp splice variant Csp2 . Furthermore , the strikingly conserved linker region adjacent to the J - domain was important for Csp function in exocytosis , but not for the activation of Hsc70 ATPase . The effects of Csp wild - type or mutants were preserved in permeabilized cells excluding an effect on transmembrane ion ﬂuxes . These observations demonstrate a functional difference between the two isoforms and suggest a role for the J - domain co - chaperone function as well as for the newly deﬁned linker region in LDCV exocytosis .

In order to deﬁne now functional domains of Csp in exocytosis , we have performed a mutational analysis using intact and permeabilized insulin - secreting cells as a model system of LDCV exocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Streptolysin - O was produced and puriﬁed as described ( Weller et al . , 1996 ) . Primary antibodies and dilutions were : polyclonal anti - insulin antibody ( Linco , 1 : 400 ) ; monoclonal anti - myc antibody 9E10 ( 1 : 100 for immunoﬂuorescence , 1 : 2000 for immunoblots ) ; the generation and speciﬁcity of polyclonal rabbit anti - Csp1 has been described ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) ( 1 : 200 for immunoﬂuorescence , 1 : 2000 for immunoblots ) . Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence Preparation of homogenates from insulin secreting cell lines and SDS / PAGE immunoblots were performed as published ( Lang et al . , 1997a , c ) . Membrane attachment was tested as described ( van de Goor and Kelly , 1996 ) with minor modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , 80 m g of homogenates were treated for 2 hours at 4°C with buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Hepes , 1 mM EGTA and 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , ﬁnal pH 7 . 0 ) in the absence or presence of 1 M hydroxylamine and analysed by western blotting . Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal laser microscopy were performed with a Zeiss LSM 410 inverse laser scan microscope equipped with an argon and helium - neon laser ( Lang et al . , 1997a , c ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Site directed mutagenesis The cDNA fragments encoding Csp1 and Csp2 ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1996 ) were ﬁrst ligated into the Bam HI / Eco RI sites of pGEM3Zf ( + ) ( Stratagene ) . Single strand DNA was produced by mobilisation with phage VCSM13 ( Stratagene ) in E . coli strain CJ236 and mutagenesis performed by the method of Kunkel ( 1985 ) . The primers used were H43Q : ( 5 ¢ - GGTTCTTGTCAGG - ( G / T ) TGGTATTTCAAG - 3 ¢ ) , D45N : ( 5 ¢ - CAGGGTTCTTGT ( C / T ) - AGGGTGGTATTTC - 3 ¢ ) ; and E93V : ( 5 ¢ - GTGTTCACGTTC ( T / A ) - CCTCCCCGAACTG - 3 ¢ ) . All mutations were veriﬁed by double strand sequence analysis . The Bam HI / Eco RI fragments encoding wild - type and mutant Csps were excised from pGEM3Zf ( + ) and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 . 1 ( Invitrogen ) . To obtain N - terminal myc - tagged Csps , a Hin dIII / Eco RI myc - rab3A fragment was ﬁrst subcloned from pGEM - myc - rab3A ( kindly provided by Dr L . Johannes , Institut Pasteur , Paris ) and ligated with pcDNA3 . 1 digested with the same enzymes . Finally , the rab3A fragment was excised and replaced by the Bam HI / Eco RI fragments encoding the Csps . Cell culture , transient transfection and release studies Cell cultures and transient cotransfections were performed as published ( Lang et al . , 1995 , 1997a , b , c ; Regazzi et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . For expression and secretion experiments , 2 . 5 m g of preproinsulin encoding plasmid ( phINS ) were mixed with either 2 . 5 m g pcDNA3 ( control ) or with 0 . 5 m g Csp - constructs and 2 . 0 m g pcDNA3 per well . Hydroxylamine sensitivity experiments were performed as single transfections using 5 m g of Csp - encoding plasmids per well to ensure optimal detection by the anti - myc antibody . Transient expression of wild - type and mutated Csps were determined in parallel with secretion experiments by scanning of immunoblots using Imagequant v3 . 3 ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Several autoradiographic exposures were made and scanned to determine the region of maximum linearity of ﬁlm and scanner response . Those exposures were chosen in which the signals were above the ﬁlm sensitivity limit and not saturated . The bands were compared using area measurements . Release studies from intact or permeabilized cells were performed as described before and human insulin C - peptide was determined as measure of insulin release from cotransfected cells by a species speciﬁc ELISA ( DAKO ) ( Lang et al . , 1997a , c ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins and ATPase assays Csp fragments were subcloned into Bam HI / Eco RI sites of the vector pGEX - 2T ( Pharmacia Biotech ) and GST tagged recombinant proteins puriﬁed according to the instructions of the manufacturer . pHsc70 plasmid ( Wang and Lee , 1993 ) was transformed into E . coli BL21 ( lDE3 ) and Hsc70 was prepared according to published methods ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ; Wang and Lee , 1993 ) . Recombinant proteins were over > 95 % pure as judged by Coomassie Blue stained SDS - PAGE gels . For Hsc70 products , EDTA was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 4 mM to restore nucleotide dependence . ATPase activity assays were measured as inorganic phosphate release using a spectrophotometric method ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1997a ) . Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± s . e . m . from experiments performed independently on at least three different cell preparations . Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s two - tailed t - test for unpaired data ( 2p ) . RESULTS Csp domains and expression of point mutants In order to deﬁne which domains of Csps were required for their function in hormone release , several point mutants were constructed of the two described isoforms of mammalian Csps , namely Csp1 and Csp2 which differ only in their C - termini ( Fig . 1 ) . Csps contain an N - terminal J domain and an HPD tripeptide motif that is highly conserved in all J domain proteins studied . Point mutations in this HPD motif attenuate or abolish J domain function in many systems ( for review see Kelley , 1998 ) . Therefore the point mutations H43Q and D45N were engineered . Moreover , the linker region between the J domain and the cysteine - rich string is strikingly conserved in all Csps described ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1996 ; Gundersen and Umbach , 1992 ; Mastrogiacomo and Gundersen , 1995 ; Mastrogiacomo et al . , 1998b ; Wilson et al . , H . Zhang and others J - Domain Linker Cys Csp1 Csp2 13 HPD 110 82 198 167 137 E93V D45N H43Q Fig . 1 . Schematic representation of the domains of mammalian Csp splice isoforms and engineered mutations . Csp1 and its splice variant Csp2 contain a short N - terminal domain , a J - domain ( 13 - 82 ) with the HPD tri - motif , an adjacent highly conserved linker region , a cysteine string and a variable C terminus . Numbers indicate the approximate boundaries of the domains . Point mutations H43Q and D45N are located in the HPD - motif of the J - domain , whereas the mutation E93V resides in the linker region . The double point mutant Csp2H43Q / E93V was abbreviated as Csp2DM . 1347 Csp domains involved in insulin exocytosis 1994 ; Zinsmaier et al . , 1990 ) and presented an additional target for mutational analysis ( E93V ) . Finally we constructed a double mutant of the HPD motif and the linker region ( Csp2H43Q / E93V , abbreviated as Csp2DM ) . We ﬁrst examined the levels of transiently expressed proteins in hamster insulinoma HIT - T15 cells by immunoblot analysis of homogenates . To permit identiﬁcation of transiently expressed versus endogenous Csps , constructs were used which express an N - terminal myc - epitope ( Fig . 2 ) . Note that tagged and untagged constructs did not differ in functional assays ( data not shown ) . Incubation of blots with an antibody against the myc - tag revealed comparable expression of all constructs used ( see legend , Fig . 2 ) . The anti - Csp1 antibody stained two bands in homogenates from cells cotransfected with myc - tagged Csp1 constructs , but not in cells cotransfected with a control plasmid ( pcDNA3 ) or with Csp2 constructs . Whereas the lower band represents endogenous Csp1 , the upper band corresponds to transiently expressed myc - Csp1 . Quantiﬁcation of scanned band indicated that myc - tagged wild - type Csp1 was expressed at levels similar to endogenous Csp1 ( 81 . 8 + 15 % ) . Taking into account a transfection rate of 15 % transfected cells as determined by control expression of enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( eGFP ) , overexpression amounts to an approximately ﬁvefold increase as compared to endogenous levels . Effect of Csp point mutants on insulin secretion and exocytosis As transient transfection will result in transgene expression only by a fraction of cells , we employed cotransfections with a plasmid encoding human preproinsulin ( phINS ) . The ensuing expression and release of human insulin C - peptide serves as a reporter for exocytosis in the hamster HIT - T15 cell line and can be reliably distinguished from rodent insulin released from all cells by a species - speciﬁc ELISA ( Lang et al . , 1995 , 1997a , c ; Regazzi et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Total cellular contents of transiently expressed human insulin C - peptide did not differ between control and cells overexpressing Csp constructs indicating that Csp expression did not perturb insulin biosynthesis ( data not shown ) . As given in Fig . 3 ( upper panel ) , overexpression of Csp1 largely inhibited human insulin C - peptide release in response to depolarization evoked Ca 2 + inﬂux as reported previously ( Zhang et al . , 1997 ; Brown et al . , 1998 ) . A similar degree of inhibition , i . e . approximately 80 % , was observed for Csp2 . In the case of Csp1 , constructs with point mutations in its J domain ( Csp1H43Q , Csp1D45N ) or in its linker region ( Csp1E93V ) reduced secretion to the same extent as wild - type Csp1 . In contrast , constructs with identical point mutations in the splice variant Csp2 reduced insulin C - peptide release by only 50 % ( Csp2H43Q , Csp2D45N ) and 33 % ( Csp2E93V ) , respectively . Similar results were observed for Csp2 and Csp2E93V when the insulin - secreting cells were stimulated by glucose ( data not shown ) . Moreover , double mutation in Csp2 of both the HPD - motif and the linker region ( Csp2DM ) completely abolished the inhibitory effect . These results suggest that the mutations in the J - domain or linker region of Csp2 , but not of Csp1 , affect the ability of Csps to interfere with insulin secretion . As Csp may modulate Ca 2 + channel activity ( Ranjan et al . , Fig . 2 . Expression of wild - type and mutated Csps in transiently cotransfected hamster insulinoma HIT - T15 cells . Wild - type or mutant myc - tagged Csps were transiently expressed in HIT - T15 cells and analysed by western blotting with anti - myc ( myc ) antibody or anti - Csp1 antibody ( anti - Csp ) . Quantiﬁcation of blots revealed the following expression levels as compared to myc - Csp1 wild - type ( mean + s . e . % ) : myc - Csp1H43Q 98 . 7 + 8 . 0 ; myc - Csp1D45N 110 . 5 + 7 . 8 ; myc - Csp1E93V 98 . 1 + 12 . 6 ; myc - Csp2 113 . 3 + 23 . 5 ; myc - Csp2H43Q 110 . 3 + 7 . 3 ; myc - Csp2D45N 113 . 0 + 14 . 2 ; myc - Csp2E93V 110 . 5 + 13 . 5 ; myc - Csp2DM 108 . 1 + 16 . 9 .

Effects of Csps on insulin secretion and exocytosis in HIT - T15 cells . Cells were co - transfected with cDNA for human insulin as reporter gene and a control plasmid ( pcDNA3 ) or with cDNA encoding wild - type Csps or mutated Csps . 2 days later , human insulin C - peptide release was measured and normalised to basal release from control cells which was set to 100 % . Upper panel : release under basal conditions ( KRB , open bars ) or after stimulation by 50 mM KCl ( KCl , ﬁlled bars ) . n = 10 - 22 ; * 2 P < 0 . 05 as compared to control ; + 2 P < 0 . 05 as compared to the corresponding wild - type Csp isoform . Lower panel : cotransfected cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O and exposed to 0 . 1 m M free Ca 2 + ( basal , open bars ) or 10 m M free Ca 2 + ( stimulated , ﬁlled bars ) . n = 6 - 24 ; * and + as above . 1348 1998 ; Umbach et al . , 1998 ) , we also tested the effect of transient coexpression in cells subsequently permeabilised by the pore forming toxin streptolysin - O and stimulated by deﬁned concentration of free Ca 2 + . Under these conditions , transient overexpression of wild - type Csp1 or Csp2 again inhibited Ca 2 + - stimulated exocytosis by 59 % and 64 % , respectively ( Fig . 3 , lower panel ) . As already observed in intact cells , this inhibition was not altered by the point mutations H43Q or E93V of Csp1 ( 61 % and 64 % ) , but was affected only by the corresponding single point mutations of the splice variant Csp2 ( 37 % and 22 % ) . Again , the double mutant of Csp2 ( Csp2DM ) was ineffective . Exocytosis from SL - O permeabilised cells can be stimulated independent of Ca 2 + by the stable GTP - analogue GTPS ( Lang et al . , 1997a ; Li et al . , 1993 ) . GTP g S stimulated insulin exocytosis 3 . 5 - fold in controls . Again , Csp1 , Csp1E93V and Csp2 decreased the release by 83 . 7 + 8 . 8 % , 81 . 9 + 5 . 8 % and 72 . 2 + 4 . 4 % , respectively , whereas Csp2E93V inhibited only by 31 . 5 + 8 . 9 % ( n = 6 - 15 ) . These results indicate that Csp action is situated at a late step in exocytosis distal to the regulation of ion ﬂuxes . Subcellular localisation and hydroxylamine sensitivity of transiently expressed Csps Endogenous Csps are located on insulin - containing secretory granules ( Zhang et al . , 1997 , 1998 ; Brown et al . , 1998 ) . In order to address the subcellular localisation of transiently expressed Csp constructs , affinity tagged proteins and secretory granules were visualised by confocal laser immunomicroscopy using the corresponding antibodies . As shown in Fig . 4 , overexpressed Csp1 wild - type ( Csp1 ) , Csp2 mutated in the linker region ( Csp2E93V ) or in both the HPD - motif and the linker ( Csp2DM ) colocalised with secretory granules stained with anti - insulin antibodies . Comparable results were obtained for Csp2wt , Csp2H43Q , Csp2D45N , Csp1H43Q , Csp1D45N or Csp1E93V ( data not shown ) . Csps are postranslationally modiﬁed by palmitoylation of their cysteine residues and chemical deacylation by hydroxylamine induces a shift in the R f values on SDS / PAGE ( Gundersen et al . , 1994 ; van de Goor and Kelly , 1996 ; Mastrogiacomo et al . , 1998a ) . The increased apparent molecular weight of myc - tagged Csps as compared to endogenous Csps suggests acylation of transiently expressed proteins similar to endogenous protein ( see above , Fig . 2 ) . We addressed the question whether transiently expressed Csps were palmitoylated by chemical deacylation of wild - type Csps and those point mutants , which produced the most prominent effects on insulin C - peptide release . To this end , cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNAs and the apparent shifts in SDS / PAGE determined after pretreatment with or without hydroxylamine . As shown in Fig . 5 , all constructs exhibited a comparable shift in R f values after deacylation suggesting similar degrees of postranslational H . Zhang and others Fig . 4 . Subcellular localisation of wild - type or mutant Csps transiently expressed in HIT - T15 cells . Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for myc - tagged Csp1 wild - type ( Csp1 ) , Csp2E93V or CSP2DM . 2 days later , cells were ﬁxed , permeabilised and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the myc - tag and a polyclonal antibody against insulin staining secretory granules . Myc - Csps were revealed using FITC - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( green ) and rhodamine - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG ( red ) was used as a second antibody to stain insulin . Fig . 5 . Hydroxylamine sensitive postranslational modiﬁcation of endogenous and transiently expressed Csp . Wild - type and mutated myc - tagged Csps were transiently expressed in HIT - T15 cells after single transfection ( see Materials and Methods ) . Cells were homogenized , treated for 2 hours either with buffer ( - ) or with 1 M hydroxylamine ( + ) and immunoblots were performed with anti - Csp1 or anti - myc antibody . 1349 Csp domains involved in insulin exocytosis palmitoylation . The anti - myc antibody detected a minor second band at 33 and 26 kDa ( myc - Csp1 and myc - Csp2 , respectively ) in the absence of hydroxylamine treatment which may represent a small amount of non - palmitoylated protein . Mutational analysis of the function of Csps in stimulation of Hsc70 ATPase activity Csps may exert some of their biological effect by interaction with the Hsc70 heat shock protein family , since the J domain of Csps stimulates Hsc70 ATPase activity ( Braun et al . , 1996 ; Chamberlain et al . , 1997a , b ) . Therefore we were also interested to evaluate the effect of some Csp mutations for their capacity to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 . Our results showed that recombinant Csp1 and Csp2 stimulated Hsc70 ATPase in a concentration dependent manner ( Fig . 6 ) . Deletion of the J - domain ( Csp1 D J 1 - 82 ) or mutation in the HPD - motif of the J - domain abolished the capacity of Csp2 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 as predicted from numerous reports ( for review see Kelley , 1998 ) . In contrast to the mutations in the J - domain , the point mutation E93V in the linker region of Csp2 did not alter the stimulation of Hsc70 ATPase . Note that this mutation clearly impaired the inhibitory effect of Csp2 on regulated insulin exocytosis as shown above ( see Fig . 3 ) . DISCUSSION Exocytosis of synaptic or large dense core vesicles is a dynamic process , which is regulated by a large number of distinct gene products . Several of these proteins have been identiﬁed and functional sites mapped whereas others still await functional characterisation ( Augustine et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1997 ) . Clearly , a comprehension of their function in molecular terms is required to understand secretory processes . Cysteine string proteins are likely to be a part of the general exocytotic machinery . Suppression of Csp levels in neurons or clonal pancreatic b - cells leads to an impairment of stimulated exocytosis from SVs and LDCVs , respectively ( Umbach et al . , 1994 ; Zinsmaier et al . , 1994 ; Eberle et al . , 1998 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Moreover , stable overexpression of Csp1 in neuroendocrine PC12 cells potentiated LDCV exocytosis ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1998 ) , whereas transient overexpression of Csp1 in clonal b - cells reduced insulin secretion from intact cells ( Zhang et al . , 1997 ; Brown et al . , 1998 ) . The difference in effects observed in PC12 and b - cells may be due to the different methods used ( stable versus transient transfection ) or reﬂect differences in the levels of endogenous Csp or the organisation of exocytosis in neuroendocrine as compared to endocrine cells . As demonstrated now , the inhibition of insulin release is observed not only for both isoforms , but also more importantly , the effect persisted in permeabilized cells . This excludes any regulation via soluble second messengers ( Augustine et al . , 1996 ; Lang , 1999 ) and therefore reﬂects a direct action on exocytosis . Since experiments were conducted in the presence of ATP , the observed effects may relate to several distinct steps during exocytosis such as priming or fusion ( Martin , 1997 ) . Only evoked , but not basal exocytosis was altered by deletion or overexpression of Csps ( Zhang et al . , 1998 and this study ) in agreement with studies of Csp null mutants in Drosophila at permissive temperature ( Eberle et al . , 1998 ) . These effects concern most likely a general stimulus - evoked mechanism in exocytosis because they were found for both stimuli , GTP g S and Ca 2 + , which are known to differ in their requirements for cytosolic factors and the calcium - sensing protein synaptotagmin ( Kiraly - Borri et al . , 1996 ; Lang et al . , 1997a ) . Similar to the situation for Csp , inhibition of exocytosis by both deletion and by overexpression has been reported for rop , the Drosophila homologue of sec1 / unc - 18 ( Schulze et al . , 1994 ; Gengyoando et al . , 1996 ) . As both rop and Csps are required for normal exocytosis , the observed inhibition upon overexpression may result from the formation of complexes with interacting proteins . They may be located up - or downstream from Csps within the sequence of events leading to ATP - dependent exocytosis . Excessive binding of Csps to Hsc70 is probably not involved . Indeed , inhibition of insulin exocytosis was also induced by Csp1 mutated in the HPD motif , which no longer binds to Hsc70 ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1997b ) . As shown here , overexpression does not alter targeting and seemingly does not change postranslational acylation . We have therefore used overexpression combined with point mutations to investigate which domains of the protein are necessary for function and may thereby be relevant in interactions with other components of the exocytotic machinery . We have focused on : ( i ) the N - terminal J - domain , ( ii ) the adjacent linker region , and ( iii ) the variant extreme C terminus . Within the J - domain , the canonical HPD motif is required to stimulate Hsc70 ATPase by Csp1 ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1997b ; Kelley , 1998 ) and by Csp2 , as shown here . However , only mutations in Csp2 reduced the interference of Csps with LDCV exocytosis . As the two splice variants , Csp1 and Csp2 , differ only in their C - terminal 31 amino acids ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1996 ; Coppola and Gundersen , 1996 ) , our results suggest a functional interaction between the C terminus and the J - domain in the regulation of exocytosis , but not in the stimulation of Hsc70 ATPase in - vitro . To our knowledge , this constitutes the ﬁrst evidence that the two isoforms differ in their function . Interestingly the C terminus varies also widely among Csp isoforms in Drosophila ( Zinsmaier et al . , 1990 ) . 0 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 0 10 20 30 40 * * * * * * Csp1 Csp1 D J ( 1 - 82 ) Csp2 Csp2 - H43Q Csp2 - E93V P i r e l ea s e ( n m o l ) Csp ( m M ) Fig . 6 .

Such a motif may participate in protein - protein interactions as previously shown for other proteins involved in exocytosis ( Lin and Scheller , 1997 ) . The importance of the C terminus of Csps is further underscored by the effects of the point mutant E93V . This construct stimulated the ATPase of Hsc70 to the same extent as wild - type Csp . However , in the C - terminally truncated splice variant Csp2 this mutation largely alleviated the effect of wild - type Csp2 on stimulated insulin release . The amino acid E93 is located between the J - domain and the cysteine - string in a region , which has been strikingly conserved during evolution . Indeed , this ‘linker region’ ( Csp83 - 110 ) displays 68 % , 96 % and 100 % identity in Drosophila , Torpedo and Xenopus Csps as compared to the mammalian protein ( Zinsmaier et al . , 1990 ; Gundersen and Umbach , 1992 ; Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1996 ; Coppola and Gundersen , 1996 ; Mastrogiacomo et al . , 1998b ) and can still be found in a C . elegans Csp homologue ( Wilson et al . , 1994 ) . Bacterial DnaJ proteins contain a glycine / phenylalanine rich linker region ( G / F linker ) next to their J - domain and this linker is known to be important for the efficient stimulation of DnaK ATPase ( Wall et al . , 1995 ) . A homologous domain cannot be found in Csps . However , the residues adjacent to CspE93 are predicted to form an exposed hydrophilic a - helix , which might engage the speciﬁc substrate of Hsc70 to combine a Csp / Hsc70 substrate complex . Similarly , the clathrin - binding domain of auxilin has been mapped adjacent to the auxilin J - domain ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . The mutant Csp2E93V clearly deﬁnes a new domain necessary for the action of Csps in exocytosis and again stresses the functional importance of the extreme C terminus . Interestingly , the effects of the point mutations H43Q and E93V were additive in Csp2 . This suggests that both , activation of Hsc70 and the linker region are required for normal function of Csps in exocytosis . The molecular actions of Csps in neuroexocytosis have been linked to the sites of Ca 2 + - entry rather than to a failure of Ca 2 + action on the exocytotic machinery ( Ranjan et al . , 1998 ; Umbach et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , major alterations in Ca 2 + inﬂux have not been detected following overexpression of Csp1 in PC12 cells or clonal b - cells ( Brown et al . , 1998 ; Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1998 ) . Moreover , as shown in the current study , the effects of Csps on insulin release are fully expressed in streptolysin - O permeabilised cells and they are even apparent in GTP g S - stimulated exocytosis , which proceeds independently of Ca 2 + ( Li et al . , 1993 ; Lang , 1999 ) . Although overexpression of Csps cannot be directly compared to the situation in Drosophila null mutants , we have shown previously that reduction of Csp levels impedes Ca 2 + stimulated exocytosis in permeabilised cells ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Consequently , Csps must exert a part of their action on exocytosis independent of the regulation of ion ﬂuxes . Indeed , presynaptic P / Q - and N - type Ca 2 + channels may also organise the physical site of exocytosis in addition to the mediation of Ca 2 + inﬂux ( Stanley , 1997 ) . Csp1 interacts in - vitro with presynaptic P / Q - type Ca 2 + channels ( Leveque et al . , 1998 ) and this effect may provide the molecular basis for the initially proposed link between synaptic vesicles and presynaptic Ca 2 + channels ( Mastrogiacomo et al . , 1994 ) . In pancreatic b - cells mainly L - , but also P / Q - type Ca 2 + channels are implicated in excitation - secretion coupling ( Bokvist et al . , 1995 ; Ligon et al . , 1998 ) . It is currently not known whether L - type channels bind Csps but a situation similar to neurons may apply for the different types of Ca 2 + channels linked to secretion in endocrine b - cells . In conclusion , Csps regulate insulin exocytosis by a combined functional interaction of their J - domain and their linker region with the C terminus . A precedent for chaperones and ATPase function in exocytosis is given by the role of NSF and a - SNAP ( Morgan and Burgoyne , 1995 ) . It is not surprising that the complex interactions between multimeric protein assemblages necessary for exocytosis require chaperones for correct folding , assembly and disassembly ( Hanson et al . , 1997 ) . As the role of Csps in insulin exocytosis has now been established and functional domains mapped , future research should address the precise nature of effector ( s ) and regulators of Csps .
