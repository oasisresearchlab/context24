We have reexamined the interaction of purified platelet profilin with actin and present evi - dence that simple sequestration of actin monomers in a 1 : 1 complex with profilin cannot explain many of the effects of profilin on actin assembly . Three different methods to assess binding of profilin to actin show that the complex with platelet actin has a dissociation constant in the range of 1 to 5 # M . The value for muscle actin is similar . When bound to actin , profilin increases the rate constant for dissociation of ATP from actin by 1 , 000 - fold and also increases the rate of dissociation of Ca 2 + bound to actin . Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange . On the other hand , po - lymerization assays give disparate results that are in - consistent with the binding assays and each other : profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments ; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle ac - tin ; an6 simple formation of 1 : 1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization . We suggest that the in vitro effects on actin polymerization may be explained by a complex mechanism that includes weak capping of filament ends and catalytic poisoning of nucleation . Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5 - 10 actin molecules , these complex reactions may al - low substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly . We also confirm the ob - servation of I . Lassing and U . Lindberg ( 1985 . Nature / Lond . ] 318 : 472 - 474 ) that polyphosphoinositides in - hibit the effects of profilin on actin polymerization , so lipid metabolism must also be taken into account when considering the functions of profilin in a cell . p ROFI LINS of eukaryotic cells are small , abundant cyto - plasmic proteins that bind to actin monomers ( Cads - son et al . , 1977 ) , polyphosphoinositides ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 ) , and polymers of L - proline ( Tanaka and Shibata , 1985 ) . This multiplicity of interactions led to speculation that profilins might link the regulation of the ac - tin cytoskeleton , the phosphoinosifide signaling pathways and perhaps other unidentified systems exemplified by poly - L - proline ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1988 ; Stossel , 1989 ) . Pro - filin binds to small clusters of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIPx ) ~ ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1990 ; Machesky et al . , 1990 ) and is essen - tial for the biochemical reconstitution of epidermal growth factor - regulated production of the second messenger inosi - tel trisphosphate ( IP3 ) from PIP2 ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ) . How these interactions with lipids interface with the regulation of actin assembly is not clear at the biochemi - cal or cellular levels . Some basic questions about the interaction of profilin with actin also remain to be answered . The original preparations 1 .

In spite of further evidence for a fraction of profilin tightly bound to actin in cellular extracts ( Lind et al . , 1987 ; Safer st al . , 1990 ; Southwick and Young , 1990 ) , the dissoci - ation constants ( Kd ) of reconstituted profilin - actin com - plexes have generally been in the range of 1 to 10 # M ( Stos - sel et al . , 1985 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ; Larsson and Lindberg , 1988 ) . Such moderate affinities raise concerns that the concentration of profilin in cells might not be high enough for profilin to account for the concentration of un - polymerized actin . This has focused our attention on a reevaluation of the affinity of profilin for actin , the concen - trations of actin and profilin in ceils and effects of profilin on actin that might relate indirectly to polymerization . In this study we confirm that human platelet profilin binds to actin monomers with micromolar affinity , show that the concentration of actin exceeds profilin by 5 - 10 - fold in plate - lets , present new evidence that profilin may act catalytically rather than stoichiometrically on actin and suggest ways that profilin might promote rather than inhibit actin polymeriza - © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 91 / 06 / 1081 / 9 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology .

These new ideas are more compatible than the original sequestration mechanism with what is known about the in - teractions of profilin with membrane lipids and the response of the actin system to extracellular agonists . Materials and Methods Materials Outdated human platelets were obtained from the blood bank of The Johns Hopkins Hospital and used within 10 d after phlebotomy . Poly - L - proline ( 14 , 000 mol wt ) , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , Quin2 , 1 , N ~ - ethenoadeno - sine 5 ' triphosphate ( e - ATP ) , pbosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , Triton X - 100 , phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate ( PIP ) , and IP3 were from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . PIP2 was from Calbiochem - Beh - ring Corp . ( La Jolla , CA ) . Pbosphatidylserine ( PS ) was from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Pelham , AL ) . 125I - Protein A was from Dupont - New England Nu - clear ( Boston , MA ) . Freund ' s adjuvant ( complete and incomplete ) were from Gibco Laboratories ( Grand Island , NY ) . Peroxidase - labeled goat antiserum to rabbit immunoglobulin was from Hyclone Laboratories ( Logan , UT ) . Protein Purification and Modification Actin was purified from rabbit skeleton muscle ( Spndich and Watt , 1971 ) , monomers were separated from ofigomers by gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATE 0 . 1 mM CaCI2 , 0 . 2 mM NAN3 ) and used within 7 d . Actin was labeled with pyren - yliodoacetamide ( Pollard , 1984 ) and stored in G - buffer . Profilin and actin were purified from human platelets by a new method . Piatelet extracts were prepared by sonicating 1 vol of washed platelets for 60 s in 5 vol of ice - cold buffer consisting of 5 mM " Iris ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % DMSO , and 10 - 20 pg / mi each of chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain , and pepstatin . The extract was clarified by centrifugetion at 12 , 000 g for 15 - 30 rain at 4°C and loaded on a 30 - ml column of poly - L - proline agerose ( Kaiser et al . , 1989 ) . After extensive washing of the column with 200 ml of 10 mM " Iris , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM glycine , 0 . 1 mM DTT , actin was eluted with 100 ml of 0 . 5 M KI , 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 4 mM ATE 0 . 2 mM NaN3 , 2 mM MgC12 , and 5 mM DTT . The selection of KI to remove actin from the profilin bound to the poly - L - proline was motivated by the previous use of this chantrope to dis - sociate bovine thyroid profilin from actin bound to a DNase I column ( Kobayashi et al . , 1982 ) . As actin remained attached to the DNase I column after the KI wash , we expected that the actin would not be denatured by this treatment . The fractions containing actln were immediately dialyzed against 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 4 mM ATE 0 . 5 M KCI , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCI2 , 2 mM MgCI2 , for 18 h at 4°C . After dialysis , polymerized actin was pelleted by Figure L SDS - PAGE of plate - let extracts and purified actin and profilin . The gels of the extracts and purified proteins were stained with Coomassie blue ( first and second lanes , 15pg of protein per lane ; fifth and sixth lanes , 3 pg of pro - tein per lane ) . The lanes with the extracts were also im - munoblotted ( third and fourth / anes , 20 t ~ g of protein per lane ) and reacted with rabbit serum anti - profilin at 1 : 250 di - lution . Bound antibodies were detected by reaction with horse - radish peroxidase labeled goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin at 1 : 500 dilution . Affinity chromatography of platelet extracts on poly - L - proline agarose quantitatively removed profilin along with some actin . The actin was purified by elution with KI and a cycle of polymerization . The profilin was eluted with urea and renatured . centrifugetion at IO s g for 2 h at 2°C and then depolymerized by dialysis against G - buffer . The sample was gel filtered on Sephacryl S - 300 , as de - scribed for muscle actin . Approximately 50 - 75 % of the actin retained by the poly - L - proline agerose column , possibly as a complex with profilin , was recovered by this procedure . This represents a yield of 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 mg of actin per gram of packed platelets . This actin was > 99 % pure ( Fig . 1 ) and had precisely the same critical concentration in a physiological buffer as muscle actin ( Fig . 2 ) . A higher yield was obtained by elnting the poly - L - proline agarose column with 1 M KI , but the actin obtained did not polymerize nor - really . The actin concentration was measured by UV absorhance at 290 mn using an extinction coefficient of 0 . 026 OD ~ , M - lcm - ~ ( Tseng et al . , 1984 ) . After the KI wash and a 4 M urea wash , human platelet profilin was eluted from the poly - L - proline column with 8 M urea and renatured by dial - ysis for 48 h against G - buffer . The purified profilin was homogeneous by gel electrophoresis ( Fig . 1 ) . The concentration of profllin was measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0 . 015 OD pM - lcm - 1 ( Tseng et al . , 1984 ) . Lipid Preparation The purity of the phosphoinositides , PIP2 , PIP and PI was confirmed by thin layer chromatography ( Goldsehrnidi - Clermont et al . , 1990 ) . Micelles of PIP2 and small vesicles of PIP , PI and phosphatidylserine were obtained by sonication in deionirgd water ( Goldschmidi - Clermont et al . , 1990 ) . Quantitation of Total Platelet Actin and Profilin ( a ) Gel Electrophoresis . Platelets were pelleted by centrifugetion of plate - let rich plasma at 1 , 000 g for 30 rain at 4°C . The supernatant was discarded and aliquots from the pellet weighed . The volume occupied by packed plate - lets was assumed to be 0 . 9 ml / g . Samples of whole platelets and pure prnfilin standards were solubilized in boiling SDS and electrophoresed on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . The gels were stained with Coornassie brilliant blue , and the intensity of the band corresponding to actin in the sample was com - pared with a standard curve ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1986a ) . ( b ) Quantitaffve Imraunoblottlng . Dilutions of platelets and purified profilin were run on SDS polyacrylarnide gels , blotted onto nitrocellulose , incubated with rabbit antiserum to platelet profilin , and then reacted either with peroxidase labeled goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulins or with 125I - protein A . The antiserum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with 0 . 4 nag of human platelet protilin in CFA and boosted with 0 . 3 mg in incomplete Freund ' s adjuvant after 6 and 10 wk . The profilin concentration in packed platelets was estimated by comparison with standards either by eye ( peroxi - dase ; Young et al . , 1987 ) or by counting ( t2sI - Protein A ; Kiehart ct al . , 1984 ) . Total protein in platelet extracts was measured according to Bradford ( 1976 ) using platelet profilin as the standard . ( c ) A ~ inity Chromatography on Poly - L - Proline Agarose . A weighed sample of packed platelets was extracted and chromatographed on the affinity column . All of the immunoreactive profilin in the extract bound to the column ( Fig . 1 ) and eluted with 8 M urea . This profilin was quantitated by UV absorhance . The loss of profilin trapped in the pellet was estimated by weighting the pellet after removal of the clear extract . Measurement of the Binding of Profilin to Actin Monomers ( a ) Poly - L - Proline - immobilized Profl / / n . 40 - / d aliquots of poly - L - proline ngarose beads with 17 . 4 pg of purified pmfilin bound were mixed with vari - ous concentrations of actin monomers in a total volume of 200 pl of G - buffer . Samples were gently mixed for 15 rain at 22 " C . The beads were pelleted and the free actin in the supernatant measured by the Bradford ( 1976 ) method using actin standards . In the absence of profilin < 2 % of the actin pelleted with poly - L - proline beads . ( b ) UItrafiltration . Mixtures of profilin and actin were centrifuged at 3 , 000 g for 3 rain at 22 " C in microconcentrators ( Centricon from Amicon Corp . , Danvers , MA ) with a 30 - kD cutoff ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1986 / 7 ) . About 10 % of the starting sample was filtered . This separates free profilin from profllin bound to actin and free actin monomers , since no de - tectable actin monomers but > 95 % of free profilin passed through the ill - ters . Free profilin in the filtrate was quantitated by the Bradford ( 1976 ) method using profilin standards . Polymerization and Depolymerization of Actin The concentration of polymerized actin was measured by 90 ° light scatter - The J ~ oumal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , 1991 1082 on A ugu s t 17 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m v 4 . o .

As chemical modification of the COOH - terminus of actin has been reported to affect the interaction of actin with profilin ( Lal and Korn , 1985 ) , only tracer amount ( near the criti - cal concentration ) of pyrane - labeled actin was used in this assay . After mix - ing the components to initiate the reaction , the samples were not further sheared . Steady - state polymer concentrations were measured either after spontaneous polymerization from monomers or by dilution and depolymer - ization of concentrated stocks of polymerized actin ( Tobacman and Korn , 1982 ) . Diluted samples were degassed for 5 min and incubated at 22°C to reach steady state as determined by serial readings of the light scattering .

The range of total protein concentration in these pooled platelet pellets was 40 - 70 mg / ml . The values from the study by Lind et al . were calculated by assuming a platalet protein concentration of 57 mg / ml . The difference in methods used in the various reports to pellet plate - lets is a likely source of the range of reported values . The extracellular space in the pellets may represent a substantial fraction of the total volume , so the concentrations of profilin and actin in this table are minimal values . Table II .

Rates of elongation were measured by electron microscopy with Limulus sperm acrosomai processes as nuclei ( Pollard , 1986 ) . Calcium Exchange Assay Quin2 fluorescence was used to measure the dissociation of Ca 2 + from the high affinity divalent cation binding site of actin ( Gershman et al . , 1986 ) . Excitation was at 340 nm , emission at 500 nm . Experiments were per - formed at 22°C in Q2 - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 150 # M Quin2 , 200 ~ tM MgCI2 , and 10 . 4 / ~ M Ca2 + ) . The samples contained 7 # M platelet actin and various concentrations of profilin , both dialyzed overnight against G - buffer without added calcium . Nucleotide Exchange Assay Fluorescence was used to measure the concentration of actin monomers with bound 1 , Nt - ethenoadenosine 5 ' - triphosphate ( eATP ) ( Waechter and Engel , 1975 ; Nishida , 1985 ) . Excitation was at 360 rim , emission at 410 rim . One volume of 60 # M platelet actin in G - buffer was diluted at 22°C into 99 vol of 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 2 containing various concentrations of pmfilin . The reaction was initiated by adding eATP to 50 ~ , M . In control experiments without actin , profilin did not alter the fluorescence of eATP . Computer Modeling The time course of eATP exchange for ATP bound to actin monomers was modeled using the kinetics simulation program KINSIM ( Barshop et al . , 1983 ) . The rate constants for each step in the mechanism were varied in - dependently to obtain the best fit to the kinetics of exchange at several profilin concentrations . The closeness of fit was judged by eye . The fluores - cence coefficient for eATP bound to platelet actin was determined by the steady - state fluorescence of a known concentration of platelet actin satu - rated with eATP . Results Concentration of Profilin and Actin in Human Platelets In a pellet of packed platelets the concentration of profilin is 30 - 50 # tool / liter and the concentration of actin is 230 - 320 # tool / liter ( Table I ) . The immunological and poly - L - proline binding assays for profilin , which are based on com - pletely different interactions , gave similar results . The assay GoldschmJdt - Clermont et al .

Effect of profilin on the time course of the exchange of eATP for ATP bound to platelet actin monomers . At time zero , 50 t ~ M eATP was added to 0 . 6 / ~ M platelet actin - ATP in 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 2 , 1 / xM CaCI2 , 2 / ~ M ATP , 5 # M DTT at 22°C with the fol - lowing profilin concentrations : ( A ) zero ; - ( B ) 0 . 03 t ~ M ; ( C ) 0 . 24 / ~ M ; ( D ) 1 . 92 / ~ M . The fluorescence was converted to the concen - tration of actin with bound eATP ( lef ~ axis ) using the fluorescence of 0 . 6 / ~ M actin saturated with eATP in the absence of profilin . The vertical bars in A are 4 - 1 SD from three separate runs . The grey lines are time courses generated by kinetic simulation using the mechanism and rate constants from Table I ~ . The solid lines are the steady state concentrations of complexes of profilin with all ac - tin species ( ATP - actin , eATP - actin , and actin free of nucleotide , right axis ) calculated by kinetic simulation . ( Inset ) Dependence of the half time ( t / 2 ) of the exchange reaction on profilin concen - tration . for actin assumes no comigrating proteins on the SDS - gel , an obvious oversimplification , but previous work with two - dimensional gels suggests that this assumption does not result in serious overestimation of the platelet actin concen - tration ( Goldschmidt - Clermont , E , unpublished observa - tion ) . These results are in general agreement with previous reports ( Table I ) , although the absolute concentration of ac - tin varies by threefold , most likely due to differences in the way the platelets were pelleted and in the assay used to quan - titate actin . Binding of Profilin to Actin Monomers at Steady State Two different assays , based on different physical principles , gave dissociation constants of 0 . 9 - 5 . 0 / zM for the complex of actin and platelet profilin in a low ionic strength buffer ( Ta - ble II ) . Platelet profilin had a similar affinity for platelet actin and muscle actin in these assays . Effect of Profilin on Nucleotide Exchange We confirmed that profilin increases the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to actin in a concentration - dependent fash - ion ( Fig . 3 ) as originally described by Mockrin and Korn ( 1980 ) and by Nishida ( 1985 ) . Moreover , we now present evidence that the effect of profilin on the nucleotide exchange is catalytic . Thus even when actin is in excess of profilin and the profilin concentration is well below the Kd of the com - plex , profilin can accelerate the exchange of nucleotide of the whole population of actin monomers ( Fig . 3 ) . Using kinetic simulation , we found a relatively simple mechanism with seven reactions that accounts for the effects of a wide range of profilin concentrations on nucleotide ex - Table IlL Mechanism of the Effect of Profilin on Actin Nucleotide Exchange and Rate Constants Obtained by Kinetic Simulation with KINSIM Eq .

For each reaction , the rate constants were varied in - dividually over at least three orders of magnitude in both directions to optimize the fit with the data . Alteration of the constants presented here by more than twofold markedly alters the kinetic curves and reduces the fit of the theoretical curves to the data shown in Fig . 3 .

Starting with the rate constants for reactions 1 and 2 at low concentrations of calcium from Waechter and Engel ( 1975 ) , we varied the values indepen - dently until the simulation fit the time course for the control experiments ( Fig . 3 A ) . To simplify the analysis , we assumed that the rate constants for the reactions of profilin with the three forms of actin ( ATP - actin , eATP - actin , and actin free of nucleotide ) are identical . After trial and error , we arrived at values for reactions 5 , 6 , and 7 that are consistent with the observed Kd of 2 . 5 / zM and a value of 13 s - ~ for the dissoci - ation rate constant of ATP and eATP from the actin - profilin complex . With these constants ( Table HI ) , the mechanism fits the experimental data over a range of profilin concentra - tions of 0 . 03 to 1 . 92 / zM ( Fig . 3 ) . None of these rate con - stants could be changed by more than twofold without alter - ing substantially the quality of the fit at one or more profilin concentrations . A good fit required different rate constants for reactions 1 and 2 , but the fit could not be improved by varying the rate constants of reactions 6 and 7 independently . Other models might also fit our experimental data , but we did not find a simpler model that worked as well . Since ADP dissociates more rapidly from actin than ATP ( Neidl and En - gel , 1979 ) , we considered that profilin might accelerate nucleotide exchange by increasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis by actin . However , previous studies demonstrated that profilin , if anything , decreases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by actin ( Tobacman and Korn , 1982 ) . Our analysis shows that profilin stimulates exchange of the actin nucleotide by increasing the rate of nucleotide dissocia - tion by > 1 , 000 fold when it binds transiently to actin mono - mers . At low concentrations of profilin only a small fraction of actin molecules is associated with profilin ( horizontal lines in Fig . 3 ) , but the profilin catalytically accelerates the nucleotide exchange of the whole population of actin mole - cules by exchanging rapidly between actin molecules . Effect of Profilin on Divalent Cation Exchange Profilin increases the rate of exchange of Mg e÷ for Ca 2 + at the high - affinity site on monomeric platelet actin ( Fig . 4 ) . In control experiments , profilin did not alter the fluorescence of Quin2 in either the presence or the absence of Ca 2 + . Thus there is no evidence that profilin itself binds Ca 2 + The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , 1991 1084 on A ugu s t 17 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 1° i , , , , , [ 6°t t 1 g°f°° t t 2o1 - [ ] . 1 , o ] Profilin ( gM ) 1 - 15 , i , t , , , = , = .

Reactions were initiated by adding 7 # M actin to 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATE 150 # M Quin2 , 200 # M MgCI2 at 22°C with the following concentrations of profilin : ( e ) zero ; ( o ) 0 . 7 # M ; ( , ) 2 . 8 # M ; ( O ) 8 . 0 # M . The actin sample contributed 10 . 4 # M of rapidly exchangeable Ca 2 + and 6 . 9 # M Ca 2 + bound at the high - affinity site on actin . The fluorescence signal from the rapidly exchangeable Ca 2 + has been subtracted from the data . The fluorescence signal was calibrated by titrating Quin2 with known concentrations of calcium . The grey line is the time course in the absence of profilin calculated by kinetic simula - tion using the mechanism and rate constants shown in Results . ( In - set ) Dependence of the half time ( t / 2 ) of the exchange reaction on profilin concentration . ( Mockrin and Korn , 1980 ) . As in the case of nucleotide ex - change , it is possible that profilin concentrations that are be - low saturation of actin could decrease the affinity of the whole population of actin monomers for Ca 2 + ( Fig . 4 , in - seO . However we need to test a larger range of profilin to ac - tin ratios to claim that the effect of profilin on the Ca 2÷ ex - change is truly catalytic . Using rate constants from Estes et al . ( 1987 ) , we were able to simulate the time course of Ca 2÷ dissociation in the absence ( Fig . 4 ) but not the presence of profilin . The model without profilin has three steps : Acfin + Ca 2÷ = = Ca2÷ - Actin ( k÷ : 7 . 4 t ~ M - ls - l ; k - : 0 . 011 S - t ) Acfin + Mg ~ ÷ = = Mg2÷ - Actin ( k÷ : 0 . 2 # M - is - t ; k _ : 0 . 003 S - l ) Quin2 + Ca 2 + = = Ca2 * - Quin2 ( k÷ : 1 . 0 / ~ M - ts - X ; k - : 0 . 060 S - 1 ) Interaction of Quin2 with Mg 2÷ was neglected as the affinity of Quin2 for Mg 2÷ is at least five orders of magni - tude lower than that of Quin2 for Ca ~ ÷ ( Gershman et al . , 1986 ) . We tested some simple models analogous to the one used for nucleotide exchange plus a few reactions to account for the Quin2 assay and the weak interaction of ATP with divalent cations . We selected as starting constants those con - stants which allowed us to model successfully the effect of profilin on the nucleotide exchange . However , we were not able to find a set of rate constants that accounted for the effect 60 ~ 5o ~ o 0 2 3 4 Actin ( pM ) Figure 5 .

A concentrated stock of polymerized actin was diluted into buffer with zero ( o ) or 3 / ~ M profilin ( e ) and allowed to reach steady state . of a range of profilin concentrations on the time course of Ca ~ ÷ dissociation . Effects of Profilin on Actin Polymerization Like other profilins ( Tobacman and Korn , 1982 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Larsson and Lindberg , 1988 ) , human platelet profilin increases the critical concentration for polymeriza - tion measured at steady state ( Fig . 5 ) . Using two different profilin concentrations , the Kd for the profilin - platelet actin complex was 1 . 73 ~ tM ( mean of three experiments , Fig . 5 , Table II ) . Similar results were obtained starting with actin monomers or actin filaments . The / G for the profilin - muscle actin complex calculated from the steady - state polymerization assay was larger than the Ks measured for this complex in low ionic strength buffer ( Table II ) . A micromolar Ke for the profilin - muscle actin complex was also measured using steady - state viscosity in buffer containing MgCI2 ( Larsson and Lindberg , 1988 ) . In a buffer containing MgCI ~ , KC1 , ATP , and EGTA , profilin inhibits elongation at the barbed and pointed ends of platelet actin more strongly than muscle acti n ( Fig . 6 ) . As - suming a model where only free actin participates in the elongation reaction , we calculated the equilibrium constants for the profilin - actin complex from the data at the two ends of each type of actin filament ( Table II ) . Profilin concentrations that have relatively small effects on the steady - state polymer concentration ( Fig . 5 ) or elongation at the barbed end ( Fig . 6 ) markedly prolong the lag phase at the onset of spontaneous polymerization ( Fig . 7 ) . This strong effect of profilin is far in excess of the reduction in ac - tin monomer concentration expected from the binding of profilin to actin . For example , a mixture of 5 txM actin with 4 . 06 aM profilin is expected to contain , ' ~ 2 . 5 # M free actin monomer , but this mixture ( Fig . 7 B ) polymerizes much flower than 2 . 5 # M actin alone ( Fig . 7 A ) . Moreover , when profilin is added 60 - 120 s after initiating spontaneous poly - merization , its effect on the time course of actin polymeriza - tion is markedly reduced ( Fig . 7 C ) . Therefore the inhibition of actin polymerization by profilin is likely to be mediated by the effect of profilin on actin monomers , possibly by alter - ing their interaction with divalent cations and nucleotides . We cannot exclude the possibility that profilin could interaci with small actin oligomers and prevent their elongation ( cap - ping of nuclei ) .

The solid straight lines correspond to the best fit to the data obtained in the absence of profilin .

Theoretical curves for the reactions in the presence of profilin were calculated , assuming that only free actin monomers participate in elongation and using the rate constants measured in the absence of profilin . The best fits were obtained with the following Ke ' s for the profilin - actin complex : 22 . 5 # M for the barbed end of muscle actin ; 7 . 0 # M for the barbed end of platelet actin ; 33 . 0 # M for the pointed end of muscle actin ; and 1 . 2 # M for the pointed end of platelet actin . ( 1985 , 1988 ) on the effects of polyphosphoinositides on the inhibitory effects of profilin on actin polymerization ( Fig . 8 ) . PIP2 has a stronger effect than PIP while PI or other acidic phospholipids such as PS have little or no effect ( Fig . 8 ) . IP3 , the head group of PIP2 , by itself had no effect on actin polymerization in the presence of profilin ( Fig . 8 ) . The effects of equal concentrations PIP2 in homogeneous micelles or mixed with PS in small vesicles were similar . Micelles of PIP2 also inhibit the effect of profilin on the exchange of ac - tin nucleotide ( data not shown ) , suggesting that polyphospho - inositides prevent all interactions between profilin and actin . Discussion AJ ~ inity of Vertebrate Profilin for Actin Monomers Our results confirm that profilin purified from a vertebrate nonmuscle cell has a micromolar affinity for both cytoplas - mic and muscle actin , as originally shown by DiNubille and Southwick ( 1985 ) . In our reconstituted system , we find no evidence for a high - affinity complex that might explain the ability to isolate ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ) and crystallize ( Carlsson et al . , 1976 ; Markey et al . , 1981 ) a stable complex of profilin with actin .

At this time samples without profilin have just reached steady state ( dotted line ) .

Inhibition of the effects of profilin on the spontaneous polymerization of actin by polyphosphoinositides . Conditions : platelet actin ( 5 . 0 # M , 10 % pyrene actin ) and profilin ( 5 . 0 # M ) were incubated for 10800 s in 2 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATE 0 . 1 mM CaCI2 , 0 . 2 mM NAN3 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA at 22°C in the presence of various concentrations of lipids : ( o ) micelles of PIP2 ; ( ~ ) small unilamellar vesicles of PIP ; ( a ) small unilamellar vesicles of PI ; ( < > ) small unilamellar vesicles of PS ; ( 0 ) small unilamellar vesicles of PS and PIP2 ; or in the presence of various concentrations of IP3 ( I ) . The concentration of polymer was measured by the pyrene fluorescence : 100 % corre - sponds to the fluorescence of fully polymerized actin in the absence of profilin , which reached steady state in < 1 , 800 s ( see Fig . 7 A ) ; 0 % corresponds to the fluorescence of actin with 5 / ~ M profilin at 10 , 800 s , which is nearly the same as unpolymerized actin ( see Fig . 7 B ) . In the absence of profilin the concentrations of phospho - lipids and IP3 used in these experiments did not affect the fluores - cence of pyrene actin . because it suggests that there could be an unrecognized mech - anism that regulates the affinity of profilin for actin . In this context , both the phosphorylation of profilin by protein ki - nase C ( Hansson et al . , 1988 ) and proteolytic processing of the COOH terminus of actin ( Larsson and Lindberg , 1988 ) need further study . Our method to purify actin from platelets using an affinity chromatography step should select for actin with the highest affinity for profilin . However , despite this precaution , the reconstituted complex has a micromolar Kd . Effects of Profilin Binding on the Properties of Actin Monomers Binding of profilin to actin increases dramatically the rate of dissociation of ATP and divalent cation from their high affinity binding sites on actin . We confirm earlier observa - tions by Mockrin and Korn ( 1980 ) and Nishida ( 1985 ) and provide for the frst time a quantitative kinetic analysis for the nucleotide exchange . We were unable to account for the divalent cation exchange data with a simple model . The ATP and divalent cation clearly interact with each other ( Frieden , 1982 ; Nowak et al . , 1988 ; Valentin - Ranc and Carlier , 1989 ) and bind to sites in a deep cleft in the actin molecule ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) . Profilin can be chemically cross - linked to actin residue 364 ( Vandekerckhove et al . , 1989 ) , which is located on the surface opposite the cleft . It seems likely that binding ofprofilin alters the conformation of the actin , perhaps open - ing the cleft in a way that allows both the nucleotide and the divalent cation to dissociate more freely than from native actin . Binding of DNaseI has the opposite effect on actin ( Hitchcock , 1980 ; Mannherz et al . , 1980 ) , most likely be - cause it blocks the exit from the cleft ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) . Perhaps the most remarkable feature of these effects of profilin on actin monomers is that the profilin acts catalyti - cally to promote the exchange of nucleotide and possibly of divalent cation . This is possible because the rate of exchange of profilin between actin monomers is relatively rapid but slower than the rapid dissociation of the actin ligands that oc - curs during the transient binding of profilin to each actin molecule ( Table III ) . Thus , substoichiometric profilin causes the rapid exchange of the actin ligands under conditions where only a small fraction of the actin molecules are as - sociated with profilin at any given time . Effects of Profilin on the Polymerization of Actin bIlaments A simple monomer sequestration mechanism can account for some but not all of the effects of profilin on actin polymer - ization . Assuming that only free actin monomers can elon - gate actin filaments , the monomer sequestration mechanism and the independently measured affinity of profilin for actin monomers can explain the effects of profilin on the steady - state critical concentration and elongation at the pointed end of platelet actin filaments . Elongation at the barbed end is slightly less sensitive to inhibition by profilin than predicted by the Ko , but this anomaly is less striking than with Acan - thamoeba profilin ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . The data can be explained by a mechanism where actin - profilin complexes or free profilin can bind to the barbed end of filaments form - ing a weak cap ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . This mechanism is also consistent with recent structural studies showing that profilin binds to the barbed end of the actin molecule ( Van - dekerckhove et al . , 1989 ; Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) . A monomer sequestration mechanism cannot account for the very strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization by profilin , where it appears to poison nucleation substoichiometrically , like its effects on nucleotide and divalent cation exchange . Bound ATP and Mg 2÷ both promote the unfavorable step of nuclea - tion . Therefore the effect of profilin on actin affinity for these ligands might represent the mechanism whereby profilin strongly inhibits actin nucleation . Additional research will be necessary to understand the connection between these processes . Effects of Profilin on Actin in Cells Three factors suggest that profilin accounts for only a small fraction of the unpolymerized actin in platelets and other cells . First , there is general agreement that the concentration ofactin is 5 - 10 times larger than the concentration of profilin in platelets ( Table I ) . Second , the dissociation constant of the complex is in the micromolar range ( Table II ) . Third , at least some of the profilin is bound to membrane lipids ( Hartwig et al . , 1989 ; Machesky et al . , 1990 ) . Consequently , other se - questering molecules such as the 5 - kD protein Fx ( Safer et al . , 1990 ) or members of the actophorin / depactin / destrin group of actin monomer binding proteins ( reviewed by Pol - lard and Cooper , 1986 ) or some other mechanisms are re - quired to account for the unpolymerized fraction of actin in vivo . We speculate that the predominant effect of profilin on ac - tin in cells might be the catalysis of nucleotide and divalent Goldschmidt - Clerrnont et al . Catalytic Regulation of Actin by Profilin 1087 on A ugu s t 17 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m cation exchange . Given an excess of ATP over ADP in the cell , profilin may maximize the concentration of ATP - actin monomers , by increasing markedly the rate of exchange of the nucleotide bound to actin . Since ATP - actin elongates actin filaments faster than ADP - actin ( Pollard , 1986 ) , the effect of profilin on nucleotide ex - change might actually promote rather than inhibit this aspect of polymerization . For example , upon activation of leuko - cytes , the concentration of actin polymers oscillates rapidly as a result of cycles of polymerization and depolymerization ( Oman et al . , 1989 ) , but the general trend is an increase in the concentration of polymers ( Fechheimer and Zigmond , 1983 ; Howard and Oresajo , 1985 ) . The depolymerization cycles will produce monomeric ADP - actin so the rate of reassembly might be limited by the rate of nucleotide ex - change . Since substoichiometric profilin also inhibits actin nucleation more strongly than elongation of filaments , it might limit the number of new filaments and enhance the elongation of preformed filaments . Connection of Profllin - Actin Interactions to Phosphoinositide Metabolism The available evidence suggests that a fraction of the profilin could be bound to PIP2 in the inner leaflet of the platelet plasma membrane and also on the cytoplasmic face of other cellular membranes ( Hartwig et al . , 1989 ; Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1990 ) . This conclusion is based on the high concentration of PIP2 ( 140 - 240 # M ; Cohen et al . , 1971 ) , the 1 : 5 stoichiometry and submicromolar affinity of the com - plex , and the apparent ability of profilin to aggregate PIP2 into small patches ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1990 ; Machesky et al . 1990 ) . An association of profilin with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane of human platelets and leukocytes has been observed independently by electron microscopy ( Hartwig et al . , 1989 ) . Binding of profilin to membrane polyphosphoinositides provides a possible mechanism for the regulation of the in - teraction of profilin with actin ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 , 1988 ) . For example , agonist induced stimulation of flux through the polyphosphoinositide pathway from PI to IP3 and DAG might dissociate profilin from membranes , account for the transient formation of profilin - actin complexes ( Lind et al . , 1987 ) and through nucleotide or divalent cation ex - change promote the observed assembly of actin filaments ( Fox , 1986 ) . Since profilin also affects the rate of hydrolysis of PIPs by soluble PLC isozymes ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1990 ) , it stands at an important regulatory crossroads in the cell . Although we have focused on profilin in this report , we understand that many other molecules are likely to act in concert with profilin in regulating the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton ( see Stossel , 1989 ) .
