SUMMARY The distribution of cell surface receptors for transferrin - iron and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) on the surface of cultured epitheloid ( A431 ) cells has been identified by immunocyto - chemical electron microscopy . The patterns of movement displayed by these two receptor populations as they transfer to their sites of internalization on the cell surface are different . The movement of recycling transferrin receptors over the surface is ligand - independent whereas EGF receptors are more stable residents and remain monodisperse until they bind ligand . Prior to uptake transferrin receptors cluster , predominantly within existing clathrin - coated pits while the aggregates formed by EGF ligand - receptor complexes induce new membrane invag­ inations . These results are discussed in relation to receptor populations concerned with constitutive , high capacity uptake processes and receptors involved in signal transduction . INTRODUCTION Micropinocytosis and plasma membrane turnover In most animal cells the turnover of plasma membrane brought about by vesicular transport is thought to be roughly equal to the replacement of the entire cell boundary every hour ( Steinman , Silver & Cohn , 1972 ; Steinman , Mellman , Muller & Cohn , 1983 ; Haigler , Mckanna & Cohen , 1979 ) . The vesicles involved in the uptake phase of this trafficking are relatively small ( 50 - 150 nm diameter ) membrane - bound elements , which arise by the inward pinching off of the plasma membrane ( van Deurs & Nilausen , 1982 ; Steinman et al . 1983 ) . This process of micropino­ cytosis , like all other forms of endocytic uptake , requires an ordered series of fusions and fissions within the invaginating lipid bilayer . The inward vesiculation involved in micropinocytosis transfers both plasma membrane and bulk phase solutes derived from the extracellular fluid into the cell and it is the means whereby most soluble macromolecules cross the cell boundary ( Steinman et al . 1983 ; Anderson & Kaplan , 1983 ; Helenius & Marsh , 1982 ; Pastan & Willingham , 1981 ) . In most cells a significant proportion of micropinocytic uptake is continuous and independent of stimulus ( Steinman et al . 1983 ; Lloyd & Williams , 1984 ) . A steady - state level of cell surface area is nevertheless maintained and this constitutive import of membrane needs , therefore , to be offset by a similar rate of outward , exocytic transport to the plasma membrane . During constitutive endocytosis , the relative density of surface membrane components appears to be maintained and even remains 174 C . R . Hopkins , K . Miller and jf . M . Beardmore stable for prolonged periods in the absence of protein synthesis ( Brown & Goldstein , 1979 ) . It is believed , therefore , that the bulk of the outward bound membrane is membrane that has been internalized by constitutive endocytosis and is now being recycled back to the surface . The best estimates of the rate at which this form of membrane turnover occurs are derived from studies of recycling integral membrane proteins such as transferrin receptors . These proteins spend between 3 and 7 min on the cell surface and between 5 and 20 min inside the cell ( Bliel & Bretscher , 1982 ; Hopkins & Trowbridge , 1983 ; Ciechanover , Schwartz , Dautry - Varsat & Lodish , 1983 ) . Large capacity uptake processes By delivering their content to an intracellular compartment and then returning to the cell surface , endocytic vesicles are capable of internalizing large amounts of exogenous ligand over prolonged periods ( Pratten , Williams & Lloyd , 1980 ) . Endocytic uptake probably always includes some transfer of solutes in the bulk phase ( Gonatas et al . 1984 ; Helenius & Marsh , 1982 ) , but because these solutes are carried at the concentrations at which they are present in extracellular fluids ( of the order of 10 - 5 m ) it is of relatively low efficiency . Adsorptive endocytosis , which depends upon extracellular macromolecules binding to integral membrane protein receptors that concentrate within the invaginating membrane , is a much more effective process because it is concentrative . In adsorptive endocytosis uptake efficiency is determined primarily by the high affinity ( K d 10 ~ 7 to 10 - 9 m ) with which the internalizing receptors bind their macromolecular ligand . Some populations of these receptors are capable of unloading their ligand within the cell and then recycling back to the plasma membrane so that they maintain a steady - state availability of unoccupied binding sites on the cell surface ( Anderson & Kaplan , 1983 ; Steinman et al . 1983 ) . Constitutive , self - replenishing uptake systems of this kind are not readily saturable and they are ideally suited to large capacity transfer processes such as those involved in the uptake of macromolecular metabolites ( e . g . transferrin - iron complexes and LDL ( low density lipoproteins ) ) ( Watts , 1984 ; Anderson , Brown , Beisiegel & Goldstein , 1982 ) and the removal of end products ( e . g . asialoglycoproteins and anti­ protease - protease complexes ) ( Wall & Hubbard , 1981 ; Hopkins , 1982 ) from the tissue fluids . Uptake of effector ligands Endocytosis is also responsible for internalizing effector ligands such as polypeptide hormones and growth factors . The uptake of these ligands is also receptor - mediated but there is little evidence to suggest that their receptors are involved in constitutive recycling pathways ( Hopkins , 1982 ; Bergeron , Cruz , Khan & Posner , 1985 ) . In the absence of ligand , effector receptors such as those for epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and insulin are presumably relatively stable plasma membrane popu­ lations . The endocytic uptake of these receptors can , however , be induced by ligand binding so that , for example , a half - maximal mitogenic dose of EGF causes the Receptor - mediated endocytosis 175 internalization of up to 60 % of its receptors within 5 min ( Carpenter & Cohen , 1979 ; Stoscheck & Carpenter , 1984 ) . Similar kinetics have been shown for platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( Heldin , Wasterson & Westermark , 1985 ; Bowen - Pope & Ross , 1984 ) . Internalization is followed by degradation of both the ligand and its receptor so that in the continued presence of ligand like EGF , the surface receptor population becomes reduced to a new steady state at about 20 % of the initial level . Regulation of the uptake process The mechanisms involved in regulating the rate of endocytic vésiculation are unknown . Rates of uptake via constitutive and ligând induced mechanisms appear , in general , to be similar ( Pratten et al . 1980 ) but a number of recent reports have suggested that in some instances constitutive uptake may be actually increased by ligand binding ( Schwartz , Bolognesi & Fridovich , 1984 ; Klausner , Harford & van Renswoude , 1984 ) . There is also evidence that this form of uptake may be inhibited altogether during mitosis ( Warren , Davoust & Cockroft , 1984 ) . The mechanisms responsible for driving the directed movement of surface receptors are also unknown . The most thoroughly developed model accounting for membrane recycling is that put forward by Bretscher ( 1976 ) . In this model movement is effected by a continuous , directed flow of membrane , which moves centripetally over the cell surface . Selected components of the flowing membrane are thought to become internalized by endocytic vésiculation , transported internally through the cell and then returned to the surface at a distant , predetermined location . This model was originally formulated to account for the extension and subsequent rearward movement of membrane seen at the leading edge of motile fibroblastic cells ( Bretscher , 1976 ) . However , it has other more general implications and can be applied to observations made on spreading epithelial cells ( Bretscher , 1983 , and see below ) and to the directed membrane traffic seen in polarized secretory cells ( Louvard , 1980 ) . Selectivity of membrane protein uptake The formation of endocytic vesicles can be a selective process in which only a subset of plasma membrane components become concentrated within the invagin - ating membrane . The best evidence for this selectivity has been obtained for coated pits , invaginations of the plasma membrane decorated on their cytoplasmic surface by a distinctive hexagonal lattice containing the 180xl03Mr non - glycosylated protein , clathrin ( Goldstein , Anderson & Brown , 1979 ) . Within these pits the selective concentration of internalizing proteins ( such as the receptors for LDL and transferrin ) occurs at the expense of longer - lived ‘resident’ proteins of the membrane ( such as histocompatibility antigens ) ( Bretscher , 1982 ) . Most recent interest has been focused on the role of coated pits in endocytosis because these microdomains have been shown to be involved in almost all of the constitutive uptake processes thus far examined ( Bretscher , 1984 ; Goldstein et al . 1979 ) . As yet , however , a direct role for the clathrin lattice in selecting proteins for internalization remains to be demonstrated and the possibility that some kinds of receptor - mediated endocytosis may occur via uncoated invaginations has not been excluded . Studies on epidermoid carcinoma , A431 , cells In our recent studies we have been studying various aspects of receptor - mediated uptake by mapping the distribution of cell surface receptors for transferrin—iron and epidermal growth factor on A431 cells growing in culture ( Hopkins & Trowbridge , 1983 ; Hopkins , 1984 , 1985 ) . By following the appearance and movement of these candidate receptor populations in the absence and presence of their exogenous ligands we have compared the pattern of behaviour of receptors that are thought to recycle constitutively ( transferrin ) ( Watts , 1984 ) with those that internalize in response to ligand binding ( epidermal growth factor ) ( Carpenter & Cohen , 1979 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Receptors were identified using 5 - 12nm gold particles complexed to receptor - specific mono­ clonal antibodies . The particles were prepared by standard methods ( Roth , 1983 ) and the antibodies , which are all IgG monoclonals , have all been thoroughly characterized ( Trowbridge & Omary , 1981 ; Waterfield et al . 1982 ) . The B3 / 25 antibody is specific for the human transferrin receptor while the EGFR1 antibody identifies the EGF receptor of A431 cells . Neither of these antibodies interferes with the binding of physiological ligand . The cells were grown in sparse culture , rinsed free of serum and then incubated with or without the appropriate ligand before being fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde . After quenching with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) - lysine the cells were incubated with gold—antibody complexes , rinsed and fixed in 4 % glutaraldehyde . They were then dehydrated , critical - point dried , rotary - shadowed with platinum / carbon , stabilized with more carbon and then prepared as whole mounts by floating off the glass coverslip onto hydrofluoric acid . These techniques have been described in detail elsewhere ( Toison , Boothroyd & Hopkins , 1981 ) . Control preparations were preincubated with free antibody before labelling with gold - antibody . Correlative studies were carried out using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of thin plastic sections or cryosections prepared by standard methods . RESULTS Distribution of transferrin receptors On fixed A431 cells incubated with gold - B3 / 25 particles , labelling was predominantly peripheral and heaviest at the free margins of the cells . At high resolution this label is concentrated within and around depressions of the cell surface , which varied from shallow indentations to deep cavities ( Fig . 1 ) . Thin - section studies showed that these depressions are clathrin lattice - coated micro­ domains . Pre - incubation at 5°C with free antibody reduces the labelling very significantly , demonstrating that non - specific binding is negligible ( Fig . 2 ) . The peripheral distribution of the transferrin receptor population is strikingly similar to that described in the earlier studies of Marcus ( 1962 ) and Bretscher ( 1983 ) on the peripheral distribution of newly inserted membrane proteins on giant HeLa cells . In these studies it was suggested that this distribution identified the free cell margin as the region in which newly added membrane components are being inserted 176 C . jR . Hopkins , K . Miller andj . M . Beardmore Receptor - mediated endocytosis 177 into the plasma membrane . Our earlier studies on A431 cells had shown that the recycling time for transferrin receptors in these cells was of the order of 10 - 15 min ( Hopkins & Trowbridge , 1983 ) and we designed an experiment , therefore , in which a preincubation in free B3 / 25 at 5°C was used to block existing surface receptors , so that on warming to 37 °C newly emerging receptors could be identified with gold— B3 / 25 particles . As shown in Fig . 2 quantification of the number of particles binding with time at 37°C showed a rapid increase over the first 15 min . These kinetics are compatible with the expected rate of appearance of new receptors . They are unlikely to correspond to the dissociation of free B3 / 25 because the dissociation of [ 125I ] B3 / 25 indicates that this occurs much more slowly ( Hopkins & Trowbridge , 1983 ) . During the incubation with gold complexes at 37°C , the spatial distribution of the labelling also changes . During the first 2 - 3 min most of the labelling is in the form of single , monodisperse particles at the cell periphery but within 5 min large , loosely associated aggregates occur . Between 5 and 10 min these aggregates move centri­ petally and , in addition , more closely packed groups of particles , often in ordered array , also appear ( Fig . 3 ) . These closely packed aggregates are commonly associated with the shallow pits and depressions identified as clathrin lattice - coated areas as described above . Essentially the same patterns of labelling are seen when 100 jUg ml - 1 transferrin is included during the incubations at 5°C and 37°C . These and other experiments described in detail elsewhere ( Hopkins , 1985 ) suggest that in spreading A431 cells transferrin receptors appear preferentially at the leading edge of the cell as single elements . With or without ligand they are then capable of moving centripetally to form closely packed aggregates within clathrin lattice - coated domains . These domains have a well - defined distribution forming a narrow marginal band between 1 and 2 ; Um from the leading edge of the cell . They are frequently associated with apparently stable topographical features such as microvilli and folds , and may therefore represent relatively permanent cell surface microdomains to which the mobile receptors are recruited . Distribution of EGF receptors When gold particles complexed to antibodies specific for the EGF receptor are applied to prefixed cells an even distribution of monodisperse label is observed ( Fig . 4 ) . No preferred association with the cell margin , or with topographical features such as pits or microvilli is apparent . Pre - incubation with free EGFR1 antibody reduces the binding of gold - EGFRl very significantly . If the cells are incubated with 10 ngm P 1 EGF at 5°C and rinsed and then warmed to 37°C before fixation and incubation with gold EGFR1 a rapid redistribution in receptors is apparent . Within 1 min at 37°C discrete clusters of gold particles arranged in rings of 40 - 50 nm diameter appear . There are sometimes as many as 25 particles within a particle cluster and in some instances complexes of ring - like arrays forming a ‘chicken - wire’ arrangement occur ( Fig . 4 ) . Initially these particle clusters are not associated with any particular feature of the cell surface but within 3 - 5 min the cell surface immediately beneath them becomes indented ( Fig . 5 ) . Typically , these 178 C . R . Hopkins , K . Miller and J . M . Beardmore Receptor - mediated endocytosis 179 Fig . 2 .

Cells were preincubated for 30 min at 5 °C with 1 - 5 ; Ugml - 1 of B3 / 25 antibody , then incubated with gold—B3 / 25 at 37°C . indented pits have a circular aperture and a diameter of 40—50 nm . They also occur in cells not treated with EGF , but are then much less common . The EGF - induced pits are readily distinguished by their size and form from the larger clathrin lattice - coated depressions with which transferrin receptors become aggregated . In conventional thin sections of preparations treated with EGF and then labelled with gold—EGFR1 a high proportion of the gold particles are clearly associated with 40 - 50 nm diameter invaginations of the cell surface ( Fig . 5 ) . These pits often have a typical U profile and are not associated with a clathrin type lattice . They are thus similar to the ‘caveolae’ of fibroblasts , smooth muscle cells and endothelia and are easily dis­ tinguished from the coated pits within which transferrin receptors become concen­ trated . The EGF - induced redistribution of EGF receptors has also been followed by using the gold - EGFRl procedure to label frozen ultrathin sections . In these preparations , EGF receptors have also been shown to be localized predominantly within uncoated pits before their appearance within the intracellular compartments of the endosome ( Fig . 5 ) . Together these studies demonstrate that in A431 cells EGF induces a monodisperse population of receptors to aggregate and that the aggregates that form delimit plasma membrane invaginations , which then form beneath them . Vesicles derived from these invaginations presumably transfer the EGF receptor complexes to the endosome for further processing . Fig . 1 . A .

Receptor - mediated endocytosis 181 DISCUSSION Previous studies on the uptake and intracellular processing of transferrin—iron and EGF suggest that their receptor populations are representative of two major kinds of endocytic uptake ; constitutive and ligand - induced . Our demonstration of transferrin receptors within clathrin - coated pits even in the absence of bound ligand confirms most previous observations , which suggested that transferrin receptors recycle constitutively ( Watts , 1985 ; Ciechanover et al . 1983 ; Bleil & Bretscher , 1982 ) . Our observations on the emergence of newly inserted transferrin receptors also provide direct support for the view that there is a continuous centripetal flow of recycling membrane components back from the leading edge of spreading cells . The intracellular leg of this recycling pathway has not been dealt with in the present study , but it is worth noting that the cisternal elements of the peripheral endosome , which are the most likely conduit for the intracellular trafficking of internalized receptors ( Hopkins & Trowbridge , 1983 ) , have recently been shown to extend beneath the plasma membrane to the extreme margin of spreading epithelial cells ( Bretscher et al . 1985 ) . In previous work the ligand - induced internalization of EGF receptors has been studied extensively in both biochemical and morphological studies . These studies have shown that an immediate consequence of EGF binding is the autophos­ phorylation of its receptor ( Cohen , Carpenter & King , 1980 ; Hunter , 1984 ) . The aggregation of the occupied receptor into clusters of between 10 and 50 components has also been shown to be an early consequence of ligand binding ( Zidovetzki , Yarden , Schlessinger & Jovin , 1981 ) and a previous study using a ferritin - avidin , biotinylated - EGF labelling procedure identified receptor aggregates of this size on the surface of ovarian granulosa cells ( Hopkins , Boothroyd & Gregory , 1981 ; Schrieber et al . 1983 ) . At present it is not known if the processes of autophosphorylation and aggregation are related . The induction of a transient phase of pit formation on the target cell surfaces has been described previously for both EGF and nerve growth factor ( Connolly , Green & Greene , 1981 , 1984 ) . In these studies , however , the newly formed pits were identified as being coated , whereas in the present study , although some coated pits Fig . 4 . A .

Beardmore were seen to contain EGF receptors , the majority of receptor - bearing invaginations were of the uncoated variety . The stimulation of bulk - phase endocytosis by growth factors has been reported from several systems . In most instances increased uptake occurs only some hours after growth factor binding , but in a study in which uptake in response to EGF was examined in A431 cells a stimulated uptake of the bulk phase was demonstrable within 30 s ( Haigler et al . 1979 ) . Using a protocol that was essentially the same as that used in the present work , it was nevertheless concluded in this study that this bulk - phase internalization was due primarily to a brief phase of EGF - stimulated ruffling and macroscopic pinocytosis and that the internalization of EGF—receptor complexes occurred predominantly via a separate micropinocytic uptake process . The site of receptor clustering before internalization was not identified in these studies but the uptake process did appear to be mediated by small ( < lOOnm ) , smooth - surfaced vesicles . The predominant association of internalizing EGF receptors with small uncoated cell surface pits observed in the present study has not been recorded previously . In previous work on fibroblasts , a semi - quantitative autoradiographic study showed that the majority of EGF receptors were distributed within coated pits along with LDL receptors ( Carpentier et al . 1982 ) . To date , with the possible exception of cholera toxin uptake ( Montesano , Roth , Robert & Orci , 1982 ) , only the transcellular pathways of endothelia have been thought to occur predominantly via smooth - surfaced pits . In future studies it will be of interest , therefore , to establish if the localization we have observed is a feature peculiar to the A431 cell or if it is a general finding for EGF receptor uptake . It is worth noting , however , that in the present study some EGF receptors were also observed within coated pits , and it is conceivable , therefore , that in previous work the association of internalizing ligand with clathrin lattice - coated pits may have been overemphasized . While the relative importance of uncoated invaginations in EGF internalization remains to be established , our observations clearly demonstrate that invaginations other than coated pits can be involved in receptor - mediated uptake . They also show that the formation of smooth - surfaced pits is inducible by physiological ligand binding . In conclusion , therefore , our morphological studies support the view that receptor - mediated endocytosis may occur via both constitutive and ligand - induced uptake systems . They suggest , however , that the mechanisms involved in concen­ trating these receptors within the microdomain of the invaginating membrane may be very different . They also demonstrate that ligand - induced receptor uptake does not necessarily involve clathrin lattice - coated microdomains .
