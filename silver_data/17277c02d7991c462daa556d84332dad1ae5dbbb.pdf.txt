Among them , syndecan - 4 is the only family member that is ubiquitously expressed across nucleated cells and enriched in focal adhesions 1 . The extracellu - lar domain of syndecan - 4 bears heparan sulfate chains that bind to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins containing heparin - binding domains ( HBDs ; for example , fibronectin ) in addition to growth factors 2 . The transmembrane domain drives dimerization , and the cytoplasmic domain promotes binding to focal adhesion compo - nents and intracellular kinases 3 . Syndecan - 4 acts synergistically with integrins to regulate substrate adhesion , focal adhesion assem - bly and cytoskeletal organization 3 – 5 . Syndecan - 4 also complexes with integrin - α 5 β 1 to cooperatively bind Thy - 1 ( CD90 ) , forming a unique dynamic catch bond that strengthens under force to medi - ate adhesion signalling 6 . Much like integrins , syndecan - 4 provides a direct mechanical linkage from the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton and is thus well positioned to support force transmission and act as a mechanotransducer . Syndecan - 4 null mice exhibit delayed wound healing 7 , while syndecan - 4 null cells show impaired contractility , cytoskeletal orga - nization and immature focal adhesions 8 – 12 , all suggestive of mech - anosensation deficits . Indeed , studies in endothelial cells under fluid shear have implicated syndecan - 4 in mechanotransduction both in vitro 13 , 14 and in vivo 15 , 16 . Syndecan - 4 has additionally been shown to respond to directly applied mechanical tension , activat - ing mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and protein kinase C - α ( PKC - α ) signalling 17 , 18 . These studies suggest that syndecan - 4 is directly involved in mechanotransduction , but its specific role and the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown . Here , we have combined biophysical , cell biology , and computational techniques to reveal a role for syndecan - 4 in regulating cell mechanics through a previously unidentified mechanotransduction pathway requiring synergistic integrin activation . Results Tension on syndecan - 4 induces adaptive cell stiffening . Tensional force on mechanosensitive receptors , such as integrins , triggers rapid cytoskeletal remodelling and adaptive cellular stiffening 19 . This response has also been observed in cell – cell junction pro - teins , E - cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( PECAM - 1 ) 20 , 21 , and nuclear envelope component nesprin - 1 22 . To investigate if syndecan - 4 acts as a mechanotransducer , we used electromagnetic tweezers to apply repeated localized mechanical tension to the syndecan - 4 receptor on cells plated on fibronectin via ligand - coated magnetic beads , while tracking bead displace - ment ( Fig . 1a ) . To ensure specificity of the cellular response to force , we coated the magnetic beads with an anti - syndecan - 4 antibody ( Anti - Sdc4 ) that binds specifically to the ectodomain of syndecan - 4 core protein ( Supplementary Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Application of 12 suc - cessive 1 nN force pulses to Anti - Sdc4 beads triggered an adaptive increase in cellular stiffness evident as a decrease in bead displace - ment , reaching a relative displacement reduction of 37 % by the 12th pulse ( Fig . 1b , c and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To mimic physiologi - cal ligand binding to the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan - 4 , we used beads coated with the 40 kDa α - chymotryptic fragment of fibronectin , which contains the CS - 1 HBD ( FN - HBD ) and does not bind integrins 23 . In this case we also observed a reduction in the amplitude of bead oscillation ( Fig . 1c ) . Binding to the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan - 4 was also achieved using fibronectin - coated beads , which were treated with an anti - fibronectin antibody ( clone 3E3 ) that blocks the RGD ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) integrin binding site but leaves the HBD available 23 . Again , we observed a decrease in Syndecan - 4 tunes cell mechanics by activating the kindlin - integrin - RhoA pathway Antonios Chronopoulos 1 , 6 , Stephen D .

Hytönen 3 , 4 * and Armando E . del Río Hernández 1 * Extensive research over the past decades has identified integrins to be the primary transmembrane receptors that enable cells to respond to external mechanical cues . We reveal here a mechanism whereby syndecan - 4 tunes cell mechanics in response to localized tension via a coordinated mechanochemical signalling response that involves activation of two other receptors : epidermal growth factor receptor and β 1 integrin . Tension on syndecan - 4 induces cell - wide activation of the kindlin - 2 / β 1 inte - grin / RhoA axis in a PI3K - dependent manner . Furthermore , syndecan - 4 - mediated tension at the cell – extracellular matrix inter - face is required for yes - associated protein activation . Extracellular tension on syndecan - 4 triggers a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain , the variable region of which is indispensable for the mechanical adaptation to force , facilitating the assembly of a syndecan - 4 / α - actinin / F - actin molecular scaffold at the bead adhesion . This mechanotransduction pathway for syndecan - 4 should have immediate implications for the broader field of mechanobiology .

To ensure this response is specific to syndecan - 4 , we used the same force protocol on beads coated with poly - l - lysine ( PLL ) , which binds the cell membrane non - specifically via electrostatic interactions , and an antibody that binds the extra - cellular domain of transferrin receptor protein 1 ( anti - TfR1 ) , previ - ously shown to be non - responsive to tensional force 19 . A reduction in bead displacement over the 12 pulses was not observed in either case ( Fig . 1c ) . These results demonstrate that tensional force applied specifically to syndecan - 4 core protein or its associated heparan sul - fate chains leads to an adaptive cellular stiffening response . Using a battery of pharmacological inhibitors , we mechanisti - cally investigated this syndecan - 4 - mediated mechanotransduction response . Pre - treatment of cells with the F - actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin A prior to force application prevented the stiff - ening response , with no reduction in relative bead displacement by force pulse 12 ( Fig . 1d ) . Similarly , pharmacological inhibition of Rho with C3 transferase or Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) with Y - 27632 also blocked a reduction in bead displacement ( Fig . 1d ) , demonstrating that a functional contractile cytoskeleton is required for syndecan - 4 mediated cell stiffening . Phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) activation has been shown to play a role in cell – cell junction mediated cellular stiffening 20 , 21 . Intriguingly , syndecan - 4 - mediated stiffening also showed a dependency on PI3K , as treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY - 294002 abrogated the cell’s mechanical adapta - tion to force ( Fig . 1d ) . PI3K activation produces freely diffusible phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , which acts as a lipid second messenger to propagate signalling cascades throughout the cell 24 . A major downstream effector of PI3K / PIP 3 signalling is AKT kinase . However , selective inhibition of AKT using SH - 5 did not prevent cell stiffening in response to force ( Fig . 1d ) , suggesting PI3K acts via an alternative mechanotransduction pathway .

NATuRE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | JUnE 2020 | 669 – 678 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 670 Articles NATuRE MATERIAls a GFP reporter containing the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of AKT ( PH - AKT - GFP ) , which binds PIP 3 . Sustained 1 nN tension for 60 s on syndecan - 4 resulted in elevated PI3K activity , apparent by the accumulation of PH - AKT - GFP around the bead ( Fig . 1e ) . No such accumulation was observed with the same force applied to PLL - coated beads ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) , indicating that force - induced PI3K activation is specific to syndecan - 4 . Receptor tyrosine kinases can activate PI3K in response to ligand stimulation 24 . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is known to form a complex with syndecan - 4 25 . Activated EGFR recruits GRB2 - associated - binding protein 1 ( GAB1 ) , which becomes tyrosine phosphorylated at sites that recruit the SH2 domains of the PI3K p85 subunit , providing an indirect mechanism for EGFR to activate PI3K 26 . To investigate how tension on syndecan - 4 regulates PI3K activity , we treated cells with the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib before application of sustained tension to syndecan - 4 - bound beads ; this treatment abolished cell stiffening ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . As EGFR can be activated by both ligand - dependent and - independent mechanisms , we treated PH - AKT - GFP expressing cells with a neutralizing anti - EGF anti - body that inhibits EGF ligand - dependent EGFR signalling 27 . This treatment prevented force - induced PI3K activation ( Fig . 1f ) and these cells failed to exhibit a stiffening response ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) upon force application to syndecan - 4 . EGF has been shown to sensitize mechanoresponsiveness by enhancing strain - mediated mechanotransduction 28 and increasing rigidity sensing 29 , while the dependence of adaptive stiffening on ligand activation of EGFR and PI3K is analogous to a mechanotransduction pathway mediated by E - cadherin 21 . Hence , ligand - dependent activation of EGFR may amplify syndecan - 4 mechanotransduction to facilitate downstream PI3K signalling . Collectively , these results demonstrate that syn - decan - 4 is a cellular mechanotransducer that tunes cell mechanics in response to localized tension via an adaptive stiffening response involving EGFR - and PI3K - mediated regulation of cytoskeletal remodelling via Rho . Tension on syndecan - 4 drives cell - wide focal adhesion growth . Most ECM molecules contain binding sites for both integrins and syndecans , and there is substantial evidence of a clear synergy between the two receptor families 4 . Cooperative signalling from both integrins and syndecans potentiates force transduction and is required for the assembly of focal adhesion complexes , associ - ated stress fibre formation , regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and directional migration 3 – 5 , 30 . We thus asked if localized tension on syndecan - 4 can actively recruit focal adhesion proteins talin and kindlin under force . These two families of 4 . 1 protein / ezrin / radixin / moesin ( FERM ) domain proteins bind the cytoplasmic tail of integrins , recruit cytoskeletal and signalling proteins involved in mechanotransduction and syn - ergize to activate integrin binding to the ECM 31 . Anti - Sdc4 mag - netic beads adhered to the apical surface of cells on fibronectin prior to treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY - 294002 or vehicle ( dimethyl - sulfoxide , DMSO ) . Using a permanent magnet , a sustained ~ 200 pN tensile force was applied to syndecan - 4 for 5 min ( Fig . 2a ) . In the absence of force , talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 immunofluorescent staining around the bead was limited . With sustained force application to syndecan - 4 , both talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 were recruited to the bead adhesion , leading to an approximate twofold increase in staining intensity ( Vehicle , Fig . 2b , c ) . However , when PI3K was inhibited , talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 were not recruited ( Fig . 2b , c ) . When we assessed talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 localization at the basal membrane where the cell contacts the fibronectin ECM , we found a cell - wide increase in the size and number of talin - 1 - and kind - lin - 2 - containing focal adhesions after sustained force application to apical syndecan - 4 ( Vehicle , Fig . 2d , e ) . PI3K inhibition similarly abrogated the force - induced recruitment of talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 to focal adhesions at the basal surface ( Fig . 2d , e ) . This implies that localized force on syndecan - 4 triggers PI3K - dependent , cell - wide activation and growth of talin - 1 - and kindlin - 2 - enriched focal adhesions to induce a global cellular response , even at sites distal from the point of force application . PIP 3 binding to kindlin - 2 mediates integrin activation . The cell - wide growth of talin - 1 - and kindlin - 2 - containing focal adhesions prompted us to investigate if force on syndecan - 4 leads to inside - out activation of integrin receptors . Binding of the talin FERM domain to the β integrin tail provides one key activation signal , but kindlin - 2 also plays a central role in this process 31 . Unlike talin , the FERM domain of kindlin - 2 contains a PH domain with a binding site for PIP 3 , which promotes talin - mediated integrin activation 32 . Biophysical induction of PI3K activity has been implicated in regu - lating integrin activation , although the molecular mechanisms have not been studied 20 , 21 . We used a permanent magnet to apply sustained ~ 200 pN ten - sion for 5 min to syndecan - 4 in cells plated on fibronectin . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) imaging of the basal surface of cells revealed a cell - wide activation of β 1 integrins upon appli - cation of force to syndecan - 4 , evident as an increase in the size of adhesions positive for the active conformation of β 1 integrin ( Fig . 3a , b ) . This is consistent with our findings showing PI3K - dependent cell - wide growth of kindlin - 2 - and talin - 1 - enriched focal adhesions ( Fig . 2d , e ) . The force - induced increase of activated β 1 integrins mirrored the levels induced by Mn 2 + treatment ( with - out force ) , which shifts integrins into a high - affinity conformation , whereas removal of divalent cations with EDTA treatment reduced β 1 integrin activation ( Fig . 3a , b ) . We observed no change in the lev - els of total β 1 integrin incorporation into adhesions under the same conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Biochemical and structural studies have confirmed that the interaction of PIP 3 with kindlin - 2 is critical to regulating the lat - ter’s function by promoting membrane anchoring and integrin activation 32 , 33 . We thus asked whether force on syndecan - 4 regu - lates integrin activation through an interaction between kindlin - 2 and PIP 3 . siRNA - mediated knockdown of kindlin - 2 suppressed the previously observed activation of β 1 integrins under force ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Re - expression of a kindlin - 2 mutant ( K390A ) lacking phosphoinositide binding activity 34 into kindlin - 2 knockdown cells failed to recover cell - wide activation of β 1 integrins in response to tension on syndecan - 4 ( Fig . 3c , d and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Force - induced activation of β 1 integrins was rescued in kindlin - 2 knock - down cells re - expressing WT kindlin - 2 . Collectively , these results indicate that activation of PI3K in response to localized tension on syndecan - 4 triggers cell - wide inside - out activation of β 1 integrins through PIP 3 interaction with kindlin - 2 at focal adhesions . RhoA activation requires additional ECM – integrin ligation . Although we have shown that Rho is required for syndecan - 4 - me - diated adaptive cell stiffening ( Fig . 1d ) , the role that RhoA plays in this syndecan - 4 - mediated mechanotransduction pathway remains unclear . For this reason , we measured activation levels of RhoA and found that sustained ~ 200 pN tensional force on syndecan - 4 increased RhoA activation in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 4a ) . We next sought to determine whether the observed cell - wide basal acti - vation of β 1 integrins and growth of focal adhesions is a consequence of , or an essential element in , the syndecan - 4 mechanotransduction cascade leading to adaptive cell stiffening . Syndecan - 4 is known to work in concert with integrins to regulate focal adhesion growth and cytoskeletal organization 4 . Thus , we investigated whether force - induced RhoA activation and adaptive cell stiffening downstream of tension on syndecan - 4 requires engagement of integrins . Fibronectin contains domains that can engage both integrins and syndecans via their heparan sulfate chains . The integrin binding NATuRE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | JUnE 2020 | 669 – 678 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 671 Articles NATuRE MATERIAls domain of fibronectin lies within the 10th type III module ( FN - III 10 ) containing the RGD motif , while the HBD lies within type III repeats 12 – 14 ( FN - III 12 – 14 ) . We thus treated cells adherent to fibronectin with an anti - fibronectin antibody ( clone 3E3 ) that blocks the RGD integrin binding site in FN - III 10 ( ref . 23 ) to prevent integrin ligation and the formation of new fibronectin connec - tions . We applied a 1 nN pulsatile force to syndecan - 4 and observed adaptive cell stiffening in the presence of an isotype control IgG1 - κ antibody ( Fig . 4b ) . However , blocking the integrin binding domain of fibronectin ( Anti - FN 3E3 Ab ) inhibited the stiffening response ( Fig . 4b ) , suggesting that syndecan - 4 - mediated force transduction requires engagement of new β 1 integrins with the underlying fibro - nectin substrate . Indeed , when syndecan - 4 on cells in the presence of the same antibodies was subjected to a sustained force of ~ 200 pN for 5 min using a permanent magnet , immunofluorescent staining revealed enhanced engagement of new β 1 integrins in the presence of the IgG control antibody that did not occur when the RGD integ - rin binding site was blocked ( Anti - FN 3E3 Ab ; Fig . 4c , d ) . Consistent with this , blocking of fibronectin’s RGD integrin binding site also suppressed RhoA activation upon sustained force application on syndecan - 4 ( Fig . 4e ) . No changes in cell spread area were observed on blocking of the RGD integrin binding site ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Analogous but slightly attenuated adaptive stiffening and RhoA responses were observed in cells on collagen type I ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , indicating that RGD - specific integrin liga - tion is not a requirement for RhoA induction . These results demon - strate that activation of RhoA in response to tension on syndecan - 4 requires the engagement of new integrin – ECM connections . Syndecan - 4 - mediated tension regulates YAP activation .

YAP is a transcription coactivator with a well - established role in converting biophysical inputs into gene expression signatures 36 . We sought to investigate whether syn - decan - 4 modulates YAP activity to regulate gene expression and cell function . Wild - type and syndecan - 4 null ( Sdc4 − / − ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were plated onto fibronectin - coated glass or 25 kPa polyacrylamide gels . WT cells adopted a spread morphology with prominent F - actin stress fibres and a high nuclear : cytoplasmic YAP ratio ( Fig . 4f , g and Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . In contrast , YAP was mostly cytoplasmic in Sdc4 − / − cells , and while these cells adhered and spread as normal , they lacked F - actin stress fibres , sug - gestive of lower cytoskeletal tension ( Fig . 4f , g and Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Nuclear localization of YAP could be partially rescued with the expression of WT syndecan - 4 - GFP in Sdc4 − / − cells ( Fig . 4f , g ) . These syndecan - 4 - dependent changes in YAP activ - ity altered the mRNA expression of established YAP target genes as both connective tissue growth factor ( Ctgf ) and ankyrin repeat domain 1 ( Ankrd1 ) were found to be downregulated in Sdc4 − / − cells compared to WT cells ( Fig . 4h ) . The role of syndecan - 4 in the regulation of YAP activity is not limited to fibronectin , as we also observed a reduction in the ratio of nuclear : cytoplasmic YAP in Sdc4 − / − compared to WT cells when plated on collagen type I ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Consistent with the attenuated syndecan - 4 force - mediated cell stiffening and RhoA activation observed in cells on collagen type I as opposed to fibronectin , both WT and Sdc4 − / − cells exhibited decreased nuclear : cytoplasmic YAP on collagen type I compared to fibronec - tin ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . These results suggest that syndecan - 4 - mediated tension at the cell – ECM interface is essential for YAP transcriptional signalling . The syndecan - 4 V region is required for mechanotransduction .

The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan - 4 regu - lates interactions with scaffolding and signalling proteins and prob - ably plays a role in mediating syndecan - 4 mechanotransduction . It comprises a pair of conserved ( C1 and C2 ) regions common to all syndecan isoforms , separated by a variable ( V ) region specific to syndecan - 4 ( Fig . 5a ) . Induction of protein phosphorylation is one of the first events that occurs when mechanical force is applied to cells 37 . We inves - tigated the tyrosine residue Y180 in the C1 region of syndecan - 4 , which has been identified as a major phosphorylation site control - ling integrin trafficking , focal adhesion dynamics and migratory behaviour 30 . Pulsatile 1 nN tension was applied to syndecan - 4 bound beads attached to MEFs expressing either a syndecan - 4 mutant that could not be phosphorylated on Y180 ( Sdc4Y180L ) or to a phospho - mimetic syndecan - 4 that emulates c - Src - mediated phosphorylation of the Y180 residue ( Sdc4Y180E , Fig . 5b ) 30 . The observed reduction in relative bead displacement demonstrated that both phospho - null Sdc4Y180L and phospho - mimetic Sdc4Y180E cells were able to stiffen under force , indicating that the phosphorylation status of Y180 is dispensable for syndecan - 4 mechanotransduction ( Fig . 5c ) . The conserved C2 domain contains a PDZ - binding site that interacts with PDZ - domain - containing proteins , which coordinate receptor clustering , exosome biogenesis and the formation of con - nections to the actin cytoskeleton , mainly via calcium / calmodu - lin - dependent serine protein kinase 38 , 39 . We expressed a truncated syndecan - 4 core protein lacking the C - terminal C2 ( EFYA ) domain ( Sdc4 Δ 195 Ε ; Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 16 ) in syndecan - 4 null MEFs . Deletion of the C2 domain had no discernible effect on syndecan - 4 - mediated cell stiffening ( Fig . 5c ) . The syndecan - 4 - specific V region interacts with both PKC - α and the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) to transduce downstream signals for cytoskeletal organiza - tion 39 , 40 . The V region further associates with the actin - crosslinking protein α - actinin to provide a direct mechanical link to the cyto - skeleton 41 . MEFs expressing a syndecan - 4 core protein truncated in the centre of the V region ( Sdc4 Δ 187I ; Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 16 ) were unable to mount a stiffening response upon mechani - cal stimulation of syndecan - 4 ( Fig . 5c ) . The Sdc4 Δ 187I truncation deletes the binding site for PKC - α and α - actinin 41 , 42 . Previously , V region truncation at this site has been associated with defects in cytoskeletal organization , stress fibre assembly and focal adhesion formation , as well as inhibited myofibroblast differentiation 8 , 11 . As expected , adaptive cell stiffening was observed when tension was applied to MEFs expressing WT syndecan - 4 ( Sdc4WT ; Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . These results indicate that interactions between the V region of syndecan - 4’s cytoplasmic domain and its binding partners α - actinin and / or PKC - α are necessary to initiate mechanotransduction and mechanical adaptation to force . External tension alters cytoplasmic syndecan - 4 conformation . To investigate the effect of tensional force on syndecan - 4 at the molecular level , we conducted molecular dynamics ( MD ) simu - lations . The system consisted of homodimeric transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of syndecan - 4 embedded within a membrane bilayer containing a mixture of lipids , including PIP 2 . In equilibrium 50 ns MD simulations ( no applied force ) , the syn - decan - 4 structure showed no major conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain ( Fig . 5d ) . Constant force pulling at 50 pN applied to the extracellular side of syndecan - 4 caused directed movement of the cytoplasmic domain towards the membrane ( Fig . 5d ) . Root - mean - square fluctuations ( r . m . s . f . ) of C α show that the transmembrane helices in the hydrophobic core of the membrane are mostly stable during the simulation , while the C - terminal residues ( C2 region ) are more flexible ( Fig . 5e , f ) . We chose the lysine residue K190 , as one of the most stable positions in the V region , to monitor the conformational changes of the cytoplasmic domain on the membrane plane ( Fig . 5g ) . Directed movement of the cytoplasmic domain led to association of syn - decan - 4 with the membrane , where electrostatic interactions between lysine residues and heads of PIP 2 lipids took place . Using constant force pulling at 50 pN and 100 pN over a 50 ns simulation , we observed similar tilting of the cytoplasmic domain towards the plasma membrane ( Supplementary Figs . 17 and 18 ) . The use of 25 pN constant force caused a similar but slower conformational change within the cytoplasmic domain , with 100 ns required to observe an effect like that seen at 50 ns under 50 pN . Using a higher force magnitude of 200 pN caused increased sliding of the protein through the membrane , resulting in non - directed movement of the cytoplasmic domain ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . The observed force - dependent orientation of the cytoplasmic domain , leading to membrane interactions , may be important in the modulation of intracellular associations between syndecan - 4 and its binding partners , including the scaffolding protein α - actinin , which is known to interact with the region . Force stabilizes a syndecan - 4 – α - actinin – F - actin linkage . We next sought to investigate how the force - induced conformational change in the cytoplasmic V region is linked to syndecan - 4 mechanosig - nalling . α - actinin , via spectrin repeat 4 ( SR4 ) in its rod domain , interacts with syndecan - 4’s cytoplasmic V region to establish a mechanical linkage between syndecan - 4 and the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 6a ) 10 . We used siRNA to knock down the endogenous expres - sion of the predominant α - actinin isoforms— α - actinin - 1 ( Actn1 ) Fig . 4 | Tension on syndecan - 4 activates RhoA via integrin ligation and regulates yes - associated protein ( YAP ) activity . a , PSCs on fibronectin were subjected to sustained tension of ~ 200 pn on syndecan - 4 for 5 – 15 min , with total and active RhoA presented relative to unstimulated control . n Control / 5min / 15min = 9 , n 10min = 6 biologically independent samples .

Discussion It has previously been reported that syndecan - 4 can initiate mecha - nochemical signalling without the need for other ECM receptors , exhibiting vinculin recruitment and activation of ERK 17 and PKC - α 18 . Syndecan - 4 is also implicated in flow sensing in endothelial cells , which ultimately confers atheroprotective effects 15 , 16 .

Our results demonstrate that localized tension on syndecan - 4 initiates an adaptive stiffening response through a mechanosignalling cascade that requires syner - gistic cell - wide activation of β 1 integrins and the formation of new integrin – ECM connections , followed by subsequent RhoA - induced actomyosin contractility . We have established a force - dependent syndecan – integrin crosstalk with these two mechanosensors acting synergistically to induce RhoA activation , adaptive stiffening and YAP transcriptional signalling . Although adaptive cell stiffening and local adhesion strengthen - ing are common mechanosensitive responses shared among integ - rins and cadherins , perhaps the most striking aspect of syndecan - 4 mechanosensing is how a localized force can elicit a cell - wide response , as evidenced by the global growth of focal adhesions and the activation of integrins . Intriguingly , our data suggest syndecan - 4 mechanosignalling is both chemically and mechanically propagated throughout the cell via diffusion of PIP 3 lipid second messengers and mechanical transmission through the tensile cytoskeleton via a syndecan - 4 – α - actinin – F - actin molecular scaffold . This contrasts with the localized stiffening response that occurs when force is applied to integrin adhesions . The dependence of adaptive stiffening on PI3K and integrins parallels in many ways the mechanotransduction pathways medi - ated by PECAM - 1 in endothelia 20 and E - cadherin in epithelia 21 . Localized tension on PECAM - 1 elicits a cell - wide mechanotrans - duction response 20 that is mediated by a mechanosensory complex additionally comprising vascular endothelial cell ( VE - ) cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , which activates PI3K 44 . The analogous global mechanotrans - duction response observed for these distinct mechanorecep - tors—syndecan - 4 , PECAM - 1 and E - cadherin—suggests that the kindlin - integrin - RhoA pathway leading to adaptive cell stiffening may be a conserved mechanism employed by numerous mechano - sensory complexes . The role of integrin - mediated mechanosignalling has been the subject of intense investigation , but a more integrative approach that includes syndecan - 4 as a mechanosensor could unearth new dis - ease mechanisms . In summary , our results suggest that syndecan - 4 is a key cellular mechanotransducer that responds to localized mechanical tension by eliciting a global response that regulates cell Pre - Post - 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 force ( 1 nN 60 s ) R e l a t i v e A C T N 1 - G F P i n t en s i t y * * 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 F - actin CH1 CH2 Syndecan - 4 C1 C2 V S R 4 S R 3 S R 2 S R 1 α - actinin Extracellular Cytoplasmic Variabledomain Conserveddomains Plasmamembrane * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * siNT * si Actn1Actn4 + ACTN1 - GFP * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Force pulse si Actn1Actn4 + ACTN1 - ∆ ABD - GFP 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 Force pulse si Actn1Actn4 R e l a t i v e bead d i s p l a c e m en t Pre - force Post - force ( 1 nN 60 s ) ACTN1 - GFP a b d c e s i A c t n1 A c t n4 + A C T N 1 - G F P Integrins Syndecan - 4 dimer F - actin α - actinin ( 5 ) Adaptive cell stiffening RhoA ( 4 ) ( 3 ) Integrin activation PI3K ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Force ( 6 ) Cell - mediated matrix remodelling ?

Primary human culture activated PSCs ( Caltag Medsystems SC - 3830 ) were cultured at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium / F12 Ham ( DMEM / F12 , D8437 ) with 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U ml − 1 penicillin – 100 μ g ml − 1 streptomycin ( all Sigma - Aldrich ) and 2 . 5 μ g ml − 1 amphotericin B ( Gibco ) and used at passage 4 – 8 . Immortalized MEF cell lines were a gift from M . Morgan and included WT , syndecan - 4 − / − ( ref . 45 ) and lines expressing mutant syndecan - 4 phospho - null Y180L , and phospho - mimetic Y180E ( ref . 30 ) . MEFs were cultured at the large T - antigen permissive temperature of 33 °C in high - glucose DMEM ( Gibco ) with 10 % FBS and 100 U ml − 1 penicillin – 100 μ g ml − 1 streptomycin ( all Sigma - Aldrich ) . All experiments and treatments were conducted at 37 °C . Cells were plated on substrates coated with 2 . 5 μ g ml − 1 fibronectin or 10 μ g ml − 1 collagen type I ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Polyacrylamide gels ( 25 kPa ) were fabricated as described previously 46 . Expression of syndecan - 4 in MEFs and PSCs was confirmed using western blot ( Supplementary Fig . 22 ) . Cells were treated with 0 . 5 μ M latrunculin A ( Merck 428026 ) for 1 h to inhibit F - actin polymerization , with 2 μ g ml − 1 C3 transferase ( Cytoskeleton ) for 4 h to inhibit Rho , with 10 μ M Y - 27632 ( Merck 688001 ) for 1 h to inhibit ROCK , with 30 μ M LY - 294002 ( Sigma - Aldrich L9908 ) for 1 h to inhibit PI3K , with 10 μ M SH - 5 ( Abcam ab141442 ) for 1 h to inhibit AKT , and with 15 μ M Gefitinib ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 202166 ) for 2 h to inhibit EGFR . Cells were treated with 1 mM MnCl 2 ( Fisher Scientific ) for 30 min to induce integrin activation , and 2 mM EDTA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min to sequester the divalent ions responsible for integrin activation . Cells were treated with 5 μ g ml − 1 mouse anti - human EGF antibody , clone 10825 ( R & D Systems MAB236 , RRID : AB _ 2095960 ) , to neutralize EGF . Cells plated on fibronectin substrates were treated with 20 μ g ml − 1 mouse anti - fibronectin antibody ( cell attachment fragment ) , clone 3E3 ( Merck MAB88916 , RRID : AB _ 95479 ) , for 30 min to block integrin ligation to RGD . Mouse IgG1 - κ , clone MOPC - 21 ( Merck MABF1081Z , RRID : AB _ 395252 ) , was used as an isotype control . PSCs were transfected by electroporation using the Neon Transfection system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with one pulse of 1 , 300 V for 30 ms . WT and Sdc4 − / − MEF cell lines were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . After transfection , cells were allowed recover in antibiotic - free medium for 24 h . Experiments were conducted 48 h post transfection . Cells were transfected with siRNA targeting kindlin - 2 ( Mig - 2 , sc - 106786 ) , both α - actinin - 1 ( Actn1 , sc - 43096 ) and α - actinin - 4 ( Actn4 , sc - 43102 ) , or non - targeting control ( sc - 37007 , all Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . The PH - AKT - GFP plasmid was a gift from T . Balla ( Addgene plasmid 51465 , RRID : Addgene _ 51465 ) 47 . The kindlin - 2 - GFP plasmid was a gift from J . Qin 32 . The kindlin - 2 - K390A - HA plasmid lacking phosphoinositide binding activity was a gift from C . Wu 34 . The syndecan - 4 C2 truncation plasmid Sdc4 Δ 195E ( ref . 11 ) and the syndecan - 4 V - domain truncation plasmid Sdc4 Δ 187I ( ref . 8 ) were gifts from J . Couchman . The α - actinin - 1 ( ACTN1 ) - GFP plasmid was a gift from C . Otey ( Addgene plasmid 11908 , RRID : Addgene _ 11908 ) 48 and α - actinin - 1 ( ACTN1 ) - Δ ABD - GFP ( Addgene plasmid 66935 , RRID : Addgene _ 66935 ) was as described previously 43 . Control empty vector pEGFP - N1 was from Clontech . siRNA - mediated knockdown of kindlin - 2 was confirmed with immunofluorescent staining ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) and knockdown of α - actinin was confirmed using western blot against α - actinin - 4 ( Supplementary Fig . 19 ) . Plasmid expression was assessed based on GFP signal or immunofluorescent staining for the HA tag ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . Magnetic bead preparation . Antibodies and ECM ligands were coupled to 4 . 5 μ m epoxide paramagnetic beads ( Dynabeads M - 450 Epoxy , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Beads were washed twice in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , before coupling with 40 μ g antibody or ECM ligand per 8 × 10 7 beads in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 for 30 min , followed by addition of 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and further incubation for 16 h at room temperature with gentle rotation throughout . Beads were washed and subsequently stored in 0 . 1 % BSA – phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) pH 7 . 4 at 4 °C . Beads were coated with mouse anti - syndecan - 4 antibody , clone 5G9 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 12766 , RRID : AB _ 628314 ) , PLL , fibronectin ( both Sigma - Aldrich ) , the 40 kDa α - chymotryptic fragment of fibronectin , which contains the CS - 1 HBD ( Merck F1903 ) , or mouse anti - transferrin receptor - 1 , clone 3B8 2A1 ( CD71 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 32272 , RRID : AB _ 627167 ) . For experiments , ligand - coated magnetic beads were resuspended in medium and incubated with cells for 30 min at 37 °C . Cells were briefly washed with PBS to remove unbound beads before force application . Syndecan - 4 binding to functionalized beads was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and isolation of the bead adhesion complex in cell lysates and subsequent western blotting ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Force application to cell - bound beads . A custom - built electromagnetic tweezers apparatus fitted to an inverted microscope ( Eclpise Ti , Nikon ) was used to apply controlled pulsatile forces to individual ligand - coated magnetic beads attached to cells plated onto fibronectin or collagen type I coated glass - bottomed dishes ( Fluorodish , World Precision Instruments ) . Application of the pulsatile regimen consisting of 12 pulses of 1 nN force for 3 s with intervening 4 s periods of relaxation was achieved through a LabVIEW interface ( National Instruments ) . On force application , bead displacements were recorded with a high - speed CMOS camera ( Andor Neo sCMOS , Oxford Instruments ) at 50 Hz using a 40 × 0 . 6 NA air objective ( Nikon ) . Displacement was tracked using a custom - written particle tracking algorithm in MATLAB that detects the intensity - weighted centroid of the bead with subpixel accuracy . The electromagnetic tweezers device was calibrated before the experiments using a fluid of known viscosity . Beads that showed displacements of less than 50 nm ( detection resolution ) and loosely bound beads were not selected for analysis . Application of sustained 1 nN force was also applied to cells for 60 s with concurrent imaging of GFP localization around the attached bead . To apply a constant force on a larger number of beads , we used a permanent neodymium magnet that allowed us to apply a vertical tensile force on the beads with magnitudes of ~ 200 pN . Immunofluorescent staining and image analysis . Cells were seeded on ECM coated coverslips for immunofluorescent staining . Following pertinent treatment , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich P6148 ) in PBS for 10 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma , T8787 ) in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 5 % donkey or goat serum in 1 % BSA – PBS containing 0 . 01 % Tween 20 ( Sigma - Aldrich , PBST ) . In some cases , required primary antibodies were of the same species as the antibodies used to functionalize beads , or as treatment . To block secondary antibody binding to these sites , cells were incubated with an excess of anti - mouse secondary antibody in 1 % BSA – PBST for 1 h followed by PBS washing before incubation with primary antibodies prepared in 1 % BSA – PBST for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C . Cells were washed in PBST and incubated with donkey or goat Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and phalloidin ( 1 : 40 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ; or 1 : 1 , 000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) in 1 % BSA – PBST for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature . Finally , coverslips were washed in PBST , and nuclei were stained with 1 μ g ml − 1 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI , Sigma - Aldrich ) before mounting using ProLong mounting reagent or mounted in ProLong containing DAPI ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , P36931 ) . The primary antibodies were rabbit anti - syndecan - 4 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam ab24511 , RRID : AB _ 448112 ) , mouse anti - integrin β 1 , clone A - 4 ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 374429 , RRID : AB _ 11012020 ) , mouse anti - integrin β 1 , clone 12G10 ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 59827 , RRID : AB _ 782089 ) , rabbit anti - talin - 1 ( 1 : 400 , Abcam , ab71333 , RRID : AB _ 2204002 ) , mouse anti - kindlin - 2 , clone 3A3 ( 1 : 250 , Merck MAB2617 , RRID : AB _ 10631873 ) , mouse anti - β 1 integrins , active conformation , clone HUTS - 4 ( 1 : 100 , Merck MAB2079Z , RRID : AB _ 2233964 ) , mouse anti - YAP , clone 63 . 7 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 101199 , RRID : AB _ 1131430 ) , rabbit anti - GFP ( 1 : 2 , 000 , Abcam ab6556 , RRID : AB _ 305564 ) , mouse anti - HA . 11 epitope tag , clone 16B12 ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Biolegend 901513 , RRID : AB _ 2565335 ) , mouse anti - α - actinin , clone BM - 75 . 2 ( 1 : 200 , Sigma - Aldrich A5044 , RRID : AB _ 476737 ) . Samples were imaged using epifluorescent microscopy ( Leica DMI4000B , Leica DMi8 , Nikon Eclipse Ti , AE31 Motic ) , TIRF microscopy ( Nikon Eclipse Ti ) , confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM 710 , Nikon Eclipse Ti ) or structured illumination microscopy ( GE OMX ) as indicated in the figure legends . Image quantification was conducted using NIS Elements ( Nikon ) or Fiji ( ImageJ , NIH ) 49 . ROIs with inner diameter equal to the bead size and outer diameter of 9 μ m were used to quantify immunofluorescent staining or GFP intensity at the bead adhesion . In live GFP images , this was applied to a single epifluorescent image for each time point . For localization of adhesion proteins to the bead in immunofluorescently stained cells , the location of the bead was first located in wide - field mode , and then imaged using confocal microscopy with a z spacing of 125 μ m . Intensity within the ROI was summed through five z sections expressed as mean fluorescent intensity . Focal adhesion size was assessed from TIRF microscopy images or confocal z sections of the cell’s basal surface . An intensity - based threshold was applied to images to isolate talin - 1 - , kindlin - 2 - or active β 1 integrin - enriched focal adhesions from the background for selection . To assess the YAP nuclear : cytoplasmic ratio , DAPI - stained nuclei were selected based on an intensity threshold that provided ROIs for each nucleus . Morphological outlines of cell area were manually traced on the F - actin images providing ROIs for each cell . The nucleus ROI could be subtracted from the cell ROI to obtain the cytoplasmic ROI . The mean intensity within each ROI was used to calculate the YAP nuclear : cytoplasmic ratio . RhoA activity assay . Total RhoA and active RhoA - GTP were quantified using total RhoA enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and active RhoA G - LISA assay kits ( Cytoskeleton , BK150 and BK124 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Immediately after treatment , cells were rinsed with ice - cold PBS and homogenized in ice - cold lysis buffer . Protein was quantified and sample concentration adjusted to 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 . For the G - LISA , binding buffer was added and assays were performed in triplicate using 1 . 5 μ g protein per well . Target binding to the Rho GTP - binding protein coated well was facilitated by 30 min incubation at 4 °C with shaking , followed by washing . For the ELISA , protein lysate was added to wells coated with anti - Rho IgY antibody and incubated for 120 min at room temperature followed by washing . Antigen - presenting buffer was added for 2 min , removed , and samples were incubated with the anti - RhoA antibody ( 1 : 250 ) for 45 min ( G - LISA ) or 1 h ( ELISA ) at room temperature . Samples were washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min or 1 h at room temperature . Horseradish peroxidase detection reagent was added , the samples were incubated briefly , and absorbance was measured at 490 nm . NATuRE MATERiALS | www . nature . com / naturematerials Articles NATuRE MATERIAls Gene expression analysis . RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen 74104 ) . A high - capacity RNA - to - cDNA kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific 4387406 ) was used to reverse - transcribe 1 μ g of RNA . Real - time reverse transcription PCR ( RT - PCR ) was performed in a 20 μ l reaction with 100 ng cDNA , 300 nM primers and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems 4309155 ) . The primer sequences were connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) : forward 5 ′ - CATACTCCACAGAATTTAGCTC - 3 ′ , reverse 5 ′ - TTAAGAAGGGC AAAAAGTGC - 3 ′ ; ankyrin repeat domain 1 ( ANKRD1 ) : forward 5 ′ - TGAGTAT AAACGGACAGCTC - 3 ′ , reverse 5 ′ - TATCACGGAATTCGATCTGG - 3 ′ ; glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) : forward 5 ′ - ACAGTTGCCA TGTAGACC - 3 ′ , reverse 5 ′ - TTTTTGGTTGAGCACAGG - 3 ′ . Relative expression was determined using the 2 −ΔΔ Ct method with GAPDH used as endogenous control . MD and SMD simulations . In simulations , we used the syndecan - 4 structure including transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains . The NMR structure of the cytoplasmic domain ( PDB ID 1EJP in Protein Data Bank ) was used , while the transmembrane domain was modelled with the SWISS - MODEL tool using the NMR structure of the dimeric transmembrane domain of human glycophorin A ( PDB ID 1AFO ) as a template . A lipid membrane with 40 % phosphatidylcholine ( POPC ; 144 residues ) , 15 % phosphatidylserine ( POPS ; 54 residues ) , 5 % PIP 2 ( 18 residues ) and 40 % cholesterol ( 144 residues ) was generated using CHARMM - GUI 50 . Embedding of protein into the membrane was performed by applying high lateral pressure on the system , as described previously 51 . All simulations were performed using Gromacs 2016 . 1 ( ref . 52 ) at the Sisu supercomputer , CSC , Finland . The all - atom OPLS - AA force field 53 and explicit TIP3P water model 54 in 0 . 15 M KCl neutral solution were used . Energy minimization of the system was performed in 10 , 000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm . Equilibration of the system was performed in three phases using harmonic position restraints on lipid / cholesterol heads in the Z dimension and on all heavy atoms of protein . ( 1 ) NVT ensemble simulation was performed for 100 ps utilizing the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm 55 at 100 K . ( 2 ) The system was then heated from 100 to 310 K with a constant heating rate over 1 ns using an NPT ensemble at 1 bar , using the Berendsen algorithm to control both temperature and pressure . Semi - isotropic pressure coupling was used for all the simulations to control pressure in the XY plane ( membrane plane ) and in the Z dimension separately . Temperature coupling was applied separately for protein / membrane and solution parts . ( 3 ) The final equilibration phase was performed using the NPT ensemble at 310 K and 1 bar using Nosé – Hoover 56 , 57 and Parrinello – Rahman 58 algorithms , respectively . These conditions were used in all subsequent simulations . An integration time step of 2 fs was used in all the simulations . Equilibrium MD simulations ( with no force applied , for 50 ns ) were conducted , considering the first 20 ns as a relaxation step . Hence , conformation of the system at 20 ns of the first run of the equilibrium MD simulation was used as a starting structure for SMD simulations . The pulling vector was set between the membrane ( centre of mass ) and C α of N - terminal residues of the protein . SMD simulations were performed with constant force pulling using different force regimes : 25 pN , 50 pN , 100 pN and 200 pN . Two simulations were conducted for 25 pN , 100 pN and 200 pN , and four simulations for equilibrium MD and SMD with 50 pN of constant force pulling . All the simulations were run for 50 ns , except SMD simulations with 25 pN , which were run for 100 ns . Statistical analysis . Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 ( RRID : SCR _ 002798 , GraphPad ) or Minitab 18 ( RRID : SCR _ 014483 , Minitab ) . Data were generated from multiple experimental repeats , each containing multiple biological and technical replicates . Details of the data presentation , number of replicates , statistical tests and significance are given in the figure legends . Where datasets followed a parametric distribution , experimental groups were compared using two - sided two - sample or paired t - tests . For multiple experimental variables , analysis of variance was used with Tukey pairwise comparisons . Where datasets were non - parametric , two - sided Mann – Whitney tests or two - sided paired rank tests were used in place of two - sample and paired t - tests , respectively . In the case of multiple experimental groups , non - parametric data were transformed to fit a parametric distribution using a Box – Cox transformation prior to analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons , or the Kruskal – Wallis test was used . Non - parametric bead displacement data over successive force pulses were analysed using the Friedman test with Dunn pairwise comparisons . The significance level for all tests was set at 0 . 05 .
