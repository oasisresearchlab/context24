It is believed that the follicle status is linked to developmental competence of the enclosed oocyte . To explore the link between follicles and competence in cows , previous research at our laboratory has developed an ovarian stimulation protocol that increases and then decreases oocyte quality according to the timing of oocyte recovery post - FSH withdrawal ( coasting ) . Using this protocol , we have obtained the granulosa cells associated with oocytes of different qualities at selected times of coasting . Transcriptome analysis was done with Embryogene microarray slides and validation was performed by real - time PCR . Results show that the major changes in gene expression occurred from 20 to 44 h of coasting , when oocyte quality increases . Secondly , among upregulated genes ( 20 – 44 h ) , 25 % were extracellular molecules , highlighting potential granulosa signaling cascades . Principal component analysis identiﬁed two patterns : one resembling the competence proﬁle and another associated with follicle growth and atresia . Additionally , three major functional changes were identiﬁed : i ) the end of follicle growth ( BMPR1B , IGF2 , and RELN ) , involving interactions with the extracellular matrix ( TFPI2 ) ; angiogenesis ( NRP1 ) , including early hypoxia , and potentially oxidative stress ( GFPT2 , TF , and VNN1 ) and ii ) apoptosis ( KCNJ8 ) followed by iii ) inﬂammation ( ANKRD1 ) . This unique window of analysis indicates a progressive hypoxia during coasting mixed with an increase in apoptosis and inﬂammation . Potential signaling pathways leading to competence have been identiﬁed and will require downstream testing . This preliminary analysis supports the potential role of the follicular differentiation in oocyte quality both during competence increase and decrease phases . Reproduction ( 2013 ) 145 555 – 565 Introduction The understanding of the variability of oocyte quality is particularly important in large mono - ovulating species such as cows , horses , and humans . There is a general consensus that oocyte quality is best during a natural cycle , although several good - quality oocytes can some - times be obtained during stimulated treatments . The bovine species coupled with an efﬁcient in vitro maturation – IVF system offer a good research tool to address the effects of follicular growth and dynamics on oocyte quality . Indeed , it is ethically possible to hormonally manipulate the different parameters of follicular maturation and then assess the related quality of the oocytes obtained using the same females repeatedly and the same bull . In cattle , the follicle status has a signiﬁcant effect on oocyte quality , and through several protocols , it has been demonstrated that hormonal pretreatment of ovaries with gonadotropins can improve oocyte quality in a time - regulated manner ( Blondin et al . 1996 , 1997 , 2002 ) . In parallel , we and others have observed that granulosa / follicular gene expression may be associated with developmental competence of the enclosed oocyte in bovines ( Robert et al . 2001 ) , rats ( Jiang et al . 2010 ) , and humans ( Assidi et al . 2008 , 2010 , Hamel et al . 2008 , 2010 ) . In our previous experiment , it was observed that an improved developmental rate was obtained with a hormonal treatment consisting of 3 days of stimulation using FSH plus a coasting period of 44 h ( Blondin et al . 2002 ) . More recently , it was shown that the best period for ovum pick up ( OPU ) ranges from 44 to 68 h after the last FSH injection and is associated with an average blastocyst rate of 70 % in cows , with some 33 % of animals reaching 100 % ( Nivet et al . 2011 ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . In the above experiment , early ( 20 h ) and late ( 92 h ) recovery time illustrates that the competence window is maximal between two states of lower competence . Based on this phenotypic observation , the current experiment was designed to analyze the granulosa cell transcriptome in relation to the three periods of competence : early , optimal , and late recovery . q 2013 Society for Reproduction and Fertility DOI : 10 . 1530 / REP - 13 - 0032 ISSN 1470 – 1626 ( paper ) 1741 – 7899 ( online ) Online version via www . reproduction - online . org Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 09 / 26 / 2019 09 : 12 : 33PM via free access Results Microarray analysis and principal component analysis Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was performed based on intensity data ( log2 ) at each treatment ( 20 , 44 , 68 , and 92 h ) . In this PCA , genes are considered as variables and coasting periods as samples . Considering the log2 ( signal intensity ) for each gene symbol , three new variables , called principal components , were identiﬁed ( linearly , Supplementary Figure 1A , and 3D view , Supplementary Figure 1B , see section on supple - mentary data given at the end of this article ) . These new variables were not correlated and permitted the deﬁnition of several general patterns signiﬁcant for global changes in gene expression . One clear observation is that two patterns resembled the blastocyst or development pattern while the third one was not related to compe - tence , thereby allowing interesting groupings of related genes . Microarray - positive probes and fold change analysis Using data with a signiﬁcant ANOVA P value ! 0 . 05 , a fold change of 1 . 5 , and a false discovery rate of 0 . 1 , there were 820 probes showing differential expression from 20 to 44 h ( 2 . 6 % of the potential positive probes ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Among them , 508 probes were over - expressed and 312 were under - expressed . This represented the biggest change in 24 h during the experiment , as there were 509 and 498 probes for 44 – 68 and 68 – 92 h respectively . This indicates that granulosa cells are signiﬁcantly affected by the coasting regimen and that most changes occur within the ﬁrst 2 days of FSH withdrawal . Between 44 and 68 h of coasting , as well as between 68 and 92 h , the proportion of probes associated with transcripts differentially expressed ( fold change O 1 . 5 and false discovery rate ! 0 . 1 ) decreased to 1 . 6 % . Real - time PCR Conﬁrmation of the microarray data analysis was performed by real - time PCR with 11 different transcripts selected according to their signiﬁcant changes during the coasting period , their proﬁles , and known function in or out of the ovary . Genes were also selected for being potential biomarkers of the competence period . The chosen candidate genes were transferrin ( TF ) , insulin - like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) , reelin ( RELN ) , potassium inwardly rectifying channel , subfamily J , member 8 ( KCNJ8 ) , tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 ( TFPI2 ) , bone morphogenetic protein receptor , type IB ( BMP1RB ) , neuropilin 1 ( NRP1 ) , ankyrin repeat domain 1 ( ANKRD1 ) , annexin A1 ( ANXA1 ) , glutamine - fructose - 6 - phosphate transaminase 2 ( GFPT2 ) , and vanin 1 ( VNN1 ) . Real - time PCR results conﬁrmed the ﬂuctuation proﬁles observed in microarray data analysis , although some changes were not signiﬁcant for the four different time points ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Functions associated with these potential markers were identiﬁed and are sum - marized in Fig . 3 . DAVID functional annotation and ingenuity pathway analysis Data upload into the ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA ) program permitted the identiﬁcation of extracellular molecules upregulated at 44 h compared with 20 h , i . e . during the period of increasing competence . Some of them have known receptors that are reported to be expressed in the ovary ( Table 1 ) . IPA also allows the identiﬁcation of predicted activated transcription factors . We have performed this analysis with the differentially expressed genes for the following contrasts : 20 – 44 , 44 – 68 , and 68 – 92 h ( Supplementary Figure 2 , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) . Using information from the literature ( Sirotkin 2011 ) , we could assign ovarian function for some of those genes . The functions associated with each contrast ( 20 – 44 , 44 – 68 , and 68 – 92 h ) are cell death , cellular movement , cellular growth and proliferation , cell - to - cell signaling , and interaction ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . For each contrast ( 20 – 44 , 44 – 68 , and 68 – 92 h ) , gene symbols associated with fold changes ( FC ) O 1 . 5 or ! K 1 . 5 ( P ! 0 . 05 and false discovery rate ( FDR ) ! 0 . 1 ) were uploaded to the Database for Annotation , Visual - ization and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) functional annotation tool . For the 20 – 44 , 44 – 68 and 68 – 92 h contrasts , seven groups of functions were similar . These global groups are inﬂammation ( relative DAVID scores ( signiﬁcant when O 1 . 3 ) from 7 . 9 to 9 . 9 ) , angiogenesis ( 5 . 6 – 7 . 7 ) , Smad / transforming growth factor 1 ( SMAD / TGFB1 ) signaling ( 1 . 7 – 4 . 7 ) , cell death / apoptosis ( 2 . 4 – 3 . 9 ) , coagulation ( 3 . 5 – 5 . 7 ) , cell movement ( 2 – 3 . 3 ) , and extracellular matrix ( 3 . 5 – 6 . 1 ) .

Genes of our data set represented in these pathways were respectively inter - leukin 1A ( IL1A ) , caspase 8 ( CASP8 ) , nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B - cells ( NFKBIA ) , and phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) , PERP , and TP53 apoptosis effector ( PERP ) . PTEN is implicated in the inhibition of IGF1 / mechanistic target of rapamycin ( ( IGF1 ) / MTOR ) ) pathway ( DAVID database ) , IL1A , PERP , and CASP8 positively regulate apoptosis . Fifty gene symbols were positively or negatively related to apoptosis . IPA and DAVID bioinformatics analysis permitted us to identify that prolactin ( PRL ) and GH1 signaling path - ways were associated with the optimal developmental competence period . Most of the molecules of these pathways are expressed or over - expressed at 44 h of coasting . The number of genes expressed at 44 and 68 h ( log ( signal intensity ) ) and not expressed at 20 h nor at 92 h reached 205 . DAVID cluster functional analysis was performed on this group and the only signiﬁcant cluster was ion - binding function with a score of 1 . 42 .

DAVID cluster functional analysis yielded three signiﬁcant clusters : the complement function ( score 1 . 81 ) , response to ions ( score 1 . 68 ) , and cell projections ( score 1 . 58 ) . There were 287 genes expressed at 68 h ( log ( signal intensity ) ) and expressed neither at 20 h nor at 92 h . DAVID cluster functional analysis was performed and there was only one signiﬁcant cluster , complement function ( score 1 . 44 ) . Finally , DAVID bioinformatics protein binding site analysis was performed and , using the University of California Santa Cruz , Transcription Factor Binding sites ( UCSC _ TFBS ) database , potential transcription factors linked to 20 – 44 h contrast ( FC O 1 . 5 ) were identiﬁed . Interestingly , analysis of the gene list associated with the potential transcription factor identiﬁed revealed that the ﬁrst two canonical pathways were GH1 ( signal trans - ducer 1 ( STAT1 ) , STAT3 , STAT5 , serum response factor ( SRF ) ) and PRL ( STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT5 ) , interferon regulatory factor 1 ( IRF1 ) ) . FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( FOS ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) are in the PRL pathway and were part of the 20 – 44 FC O 1 . 5 gene list . Parts of the molecules of this pathway were positive at 20 h and almost all the PRL pathway molecules were positive at 44 h . The microarray expression data showed that FOS had a signiﬁcant competence expression proﬁle ( P Z 0 . 007 , FDR ! 0 . 1 ) . Alpha - 2 - macroglobulin ( A2M ) , IGF2 , and FOS are in the GH pathway and A2M , IGF2 , and FOS were part of the 20 – 44 FC O 1 . 5 gene list ( P ! 0 . 05 , FDR 0 . 1 ) . Part of the molecules in this pathway was positive at 20 h and almost all the GH pathway molecules were positive at 44 h . FOS is common at the end of these two pathways ( GH and PRL pathways ) . Discussion The unique genomic comparison undertaken in this study represents a signiﬁcant step in the molecular dissection of the follicle’s role in oocyte competence in a large mammalian species . Modulating oocyte compe - tence via FSH support followed by a withdrawal period before OPU is a new and powerful tool to elucidate the cause of variations in oocyte quality . The use of genomics , although still limited by the information available for each gene , is revealing potential granulosa cell’s signaling that could explain how developmental competence is acquired . The challenge of this study is the proximity of the physiological status of the follicles being compared . The application of all time periods to each individual animal was designed to minimize individual variations in the genomic response . This design is even more important in the context of known variability in the response to hormones both across and within individuals ( Kawamata 1994 , Cushman et al . 1999 , Rico et al . 2009 ) . The physiological observations of oocyte quality as reﬂected by the blastocyst rates across coasting duration indicates an initial increase ( 20 – 68 h ) followed FSH superstimulation ( 3 days ) 0 . 8 0 . 6 Developmental competence 0 . 4 P r ed i c t ed b l a s t o cys t r a t e tO Last FSH injection FSH decreases Anti - proliferation signals ( TP53 , SMARCB1 , SRAT4 and CCL2 ) Apoptosis increases ( FOXO3 , CASP8 and STAT6 ) Globally apoptosis increases ( FOXO1 , VNN1 , GFPT2 and ANKRD1 ) Globally competence decreases No LH pulsing Opimal developmental competence Competence increases Day9 – 10 20 h 44 h 68 h 92 h Time Figure 4 Following FSH ( green line ) superstimulation , FSH withdrawal is associated with oocyte developmental competence ( orange line ) increase . The granulosa cell expression during this period of increasing competence is associated with expression of genes leading to apoptosis increases ( FOXO3 , STAT6 , and CASP8 ) andcellularproliferationdecreases ( TP53 , SMARCB1 , STAT4 , and CCL2 ) . Inthiscontext , thereisnoLHpulseincreasing during coasting . The developmental competence ( orange line ) consequently decreases . Granulosa cell expression during the period of decreasing competence is associated with expression of genes leading to apoptosis and eventually to atresia ( FOXO1 , VNN1 , GFPT2 , and ANKRD1 ) .

The six animals used in this experiment had neither the exact same pattern nor the same number of follicles nor the same size distribution . Despite the fact that these phenotypic variations raise the background noise , the genes that emerge above such background have an even more signiﬁcant value and are more likely to be reproducible phenotypes in a larger population . When looking at all the transcripts expressed , some general trends can be observed . Through a 3 - dimensional representation , the PCA analysis high - lighted higher similarities between 44 and 68 h of coasting compared with before or after ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . These results are interesting as the 44 – 68 h temporal window is linked to developmental compe - tence in terms of blastocyst rate ( Nivet et al . 2011 ) . The 20 and 92 h time points appeared distinctly different . With the 2 - dimensional PCA representation , three types of expression proﬁles emerged over the coasting period . Two patterns of gene expression were similar to the blastocyst or development pattern while the third one was not related to competence , allowing interesting groupings of related genes . Gene analysis In this study , the genes are not analyzed in a standard contrast where a control condition is compared with a treatment but in a dynamic process of terminal folliculogenesis ( see the synthesis Fig . 4 ) . In this context , the ﬁrst thing to look at is the modulation of transcription factors that control cell fate . The ﬁrst obvious observation is the initial rise and then decrease of several transcription factors associated with follicular differen - tiation : CDKN2A ( cell division inhibition , Huang et al . ( 2009 ) ) , STAT3 ( induction of competence in the cumulus , van Tol et al . ( 2008 ) ) , STAT4 , STAT6 , SMARCB1 , and TP53 ( anti - proliferation / pro - apoptosis ( Lee et al . 2002 , Sirotkin et al . 2009 ) , CREBBP , and FOXO3 ( pro - apoptosis , Huang & Tindall ( 2007 ) , Richards & Pangas ( 2010 ) and Matsuda et al . ( 2012 ) ) . Among the genes and / or functions associated with the developmental competence plateau ( 44 – 68 h ) , only one transcription factor ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) , smad family member 7 ( SMAD7 ) , is predicted to be activated speciﬁcally from 44 to 68 h and inhibited from 20 to 44 h and from 68 to 92 h . Only two transcription factors , STAT1 and CCAAT / enhancer binding protein , alpha ( CEBPA ) , are predicted to be inhibited speciﬁcally from 20 to 44 h and from 68 to 92 h . The transcription factors TP53 , CREB binding protein ( CREBBP ) , smad family member 4 ( SMAD4 ) , and forkhead box O3 ( FOXO3 ) seem speciﬁc to the competence - acquisition period ( 20 – 44 h ) , and three of them ( TP53 , CREBBP , and FOXO3 ) are implicated in the mediation of the effect of hormones in the ovary ( Sirotkin 2011 ) . TP53 is upstream of the selected candidates TFPI2 , IGF2 , NRP1 , and ANXA1 , which will be addressed below . The second series of genes that are interesting to analyze are the potential signaling molecules that could reach the oocyte – cumulus complex . Interestingly , an important subset ( 25 % ) of genes differentially expressed between 20 and 44 h of coasting encodes extracellular proteins ( IPA data base ) ( Table 1 ) . This is consistent with the follicular context , in which communication and dialogue between the different cellular compartments ( granulosa , cumulus , and oocyte ) are critical for optimal follicular differentiation ( Gilchrist et al . 2004 ) . Among these extracellular molecules , approximately half have known receptors . The secreted molecules that have known receptors could act in an autocrine manner on granulosa cells or in a paracrine manner on cumulus cells . Four of these molecules have been chosen for real - time PCR validation : IGF2 , RELN , TF , and TFPI2 ( Fig . 4 ) . Approximately one third of the extracellular molecules that we have found are known to interact with the extracellular matrix and remodeling enzymes or molecules associated with collagen , indicating the potential importance of this follicular component in terminal differentiation . Therefore , the molecules associated with maximal competence ( 44 – 68 h ) led to the identiﬁcation of two major signaling pathways , i . e . PRL and GH . These two signaling pathways have in common the end point molecule FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( FOS ) ( IPA database ) . This molecule has an expression proﬁle similar to the competence proﬁle . Among genes speciﬁcally activated during the plateau phase , two are common to the 44 and 68 h time points : IL6 and macrophage stimulating 1 ( MST1 ) . Interestingly , IL6 is involved in the LH response and could be signaling to the cumulus ( Mack et al . 2012 ) . The ovarian role of MST1 , a hepatocyte - growth - factor - like molecule expressed notably in epithelial cells , remains to be deﬁned , but in liver , it stimulates the FOX family ( Huang & Tindall 2007 ) , which is upregulated during the competence activation process . Interestingly , PRL could act positively on IGF2 expression . IGF2 ( Fig . 3 ) is associated with cell survival and IGF2 has been linked to developmental competence and validated by QPCR . In our study , IGF2 has a developmental competence expression proﬁle and would probably act differently from IGF1 , which is associated with FSH response in bovine folliculogenesis ( Lucy 2011 ) . In ﬁshes , IGF2 stimulates follicles and oocyte maturation ( Reinecke 2010 ) but the mouse KO shows no infertility ( Chandra - shekar et al . 2004 ) . Another potential actor on oocyte competence is BMP2 , which has been associated with better oocytes in humans ( Sugiyama et al . 2010 ) . Not only is BMP2 upregulated but its receptor BMPR1B is also increased . BMPR1B is a BMP family member that regulates follicular development by affecting granulosa cell proliferation and steroidogenesis . BMPs modulate 560 A - L Nivet and others Reproduction ( 2013 ) 145 555 – 565 www . reproduction - online . org Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 09 / 26 / 2019 09 : 12 : 33PM via free access FSH actions in the ovary and reciprocally ( Miyoshi et al . 2006 ) . BMPR1B is expressed from secondary to atretic follicles and is the receptor for BMP2 , - 4 , - 6 , and - 7 . BMPR1B gene KO and mutations have an adverse effect on fertility ( compromised cumulus expansion ) in mice and in humans ( Tanwar & McFarlane 2011 ) . This gene , which responds to BMP15 , is also a good candidate for a granulosa signaling back to the oocyte . The ﬁnal part of the analysis will focus on the changes within granulosa cells during the coasting period . These changes are summarized in Fig . 2 . Appropriate follicle growth involves angiogenesis to oxygenate cell layers that reach a thickness of 110 m m or more . Even if the granulosa layer is avascular , it can stimulate angiogenesis in the surrounding stroma . In our experiment , some genes increased expression as a function of time as well as follicle diameter , such as VNN1 and NRP1 ( Fig . 2 ) . When VNN1 and NRP1 reach their maximal expression , at 92 h , the majority of follicles are larger than 10 mm in diameter . These genes are thus potential indicators of follicular growth and / or differentiation . They are necessary to reach the maximal competence status but are not linear compe - tence markers , as their expressions continue to increase in the decreasing - competence period . VNN1 is known to act as a regulator of tissue response to oxidative stress by modulating the GSH store in mouse ( Berruyer et al . 2004 ) . VNN1 K / K mice display downregulated inﬂam - mation ( Berruyer et al . 2004 ) . Our results are consistent with these previous studies . Angiogenesis needs to be ﬁne - tuned in the follicle ; NRP1 is upstream of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) signaling . NRP1 is a VEGFA co - receptor , and the sema domain , immunoglobulin domain ( Ig ) , short basic domain , and secreted ( semaphorin ) 3A ( SEMA3A ) receptor ( Cariboni et al . 2011 ) . Interestingly , VEGFA is lower in Frizzled - 4 ( FZD4 ) KO mice associated with an infertile phenotype ( failure to become pregnant ) ( Hsieh et al . 2005 ) . NRP1 forms a complex with PlexinD1 ( linked to semaphorin ) regulating angiogenesis and vascular growth ( Yamamizu et al . 2011 ) . Granulosa cells could then inﬂuence the degree of expansion of follicular capillaries in the stroma and increase the follicle oxygen level , consistent with previous obser - vations in mice ( Antczak & Van Blerkom 2000 ) . For angiogenesis and follicular growth , extracellular matrix remodeling ( ECM ) is necessary . TFPI2 plays a role in the regulation of plasmin - mediated matrix remodeling ( Neaud et al . 2004 ) . It is interesting to note that full - length TFPI2 as well as RELN are very - low - density lipoprotein receptor ( VLDLR ) ligands , with an antiproliferative activity ( Hembrough et al . 2001 ) . Globally , these two last aspects ( angiogenic action and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) degradation ) are similar in tumors . In fact , as the tumor cell grows , the needs for O 2 and nutrients increase , leading to hypoxia . In order to avoid hypoxia , tumor cells signal ECM degradation / remodeling and angiogenesis . Follicle growth could be compared with this : the follicle is growing , nutrients and O 2 have to reach all the follicle cells . But follicles are not tumor cells , as they have to stop and / or regulate their proliferation . Consistent with this , TP53 transcription factor , which has an anti - oncogenic effect , is speciﬁc to the acquisition of competence period ( from 20 to 44 h ) . TP53 is upstream of ANXA1 . ANXA1 expression is stimulated by 17 b - estradiol , in the anterior pituitary in vivo ( Davies et al . 2007 a , 2007 b ) . ANXA1 has an effect on cell growth , differen - tiation , apoptosis , membrane fusion , endocytosis , and exocytosis ( John et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , ANXA1 is implicated in secretion and signaling and acts negatively on inﬂammation ( Brancaleone et al . 2011 ) . In our study , gene expression associated with inﬂam - mation ( Fig . 4 ) ( TFPI2 , ANXA1 , and ANKRD1 induced by IL1 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) a induced by TLR4 ) , angiogenesis ( TFPI2 ) , and oxidative stress ( GFPT2 and TF ) had a triangular proﬁle ( increasing competence ( 20 – 44 h ) and decreasing competence ( 68 – 92 h ) ) . The ﬁrst increase , from increasing competence ( 20 – 44 h ) , is associated with competence acquisition and possibly preparation for ovulation while the second increase in the triangular expression , from decreasing competence ( 68 – 92 h ) , could be associated with onset of atresia and less competent follicles . The equilibrium between growth proliferation and apoptosis is regulated at various levels , such as angiogenesis , cell proliferation , and inﬂammation , but also at the oxidative stress level with GFPT2 or iron transport with TF . GFPT2 is known to reduce peroxide toxicity associated with oxidative stress ( Zitzler et al . 2004 ) . TF is implicated in iron transport that is positively related to oxidative stress ( conversion of peroxide to OH . ) and transferrin receptor 2 ( TFR2 ) is upregulated at 68 h in granulosa cells in our experiment . ANKRD1 is induced by IL1 and TNF a , which are associated with inﬂammation and apoptosis signaling . In fact , TNF a increases intracellular superoxide and hydrogen per - oxide ( Xia et al . 2010 ) , and hydrogen peroxide increases expression of ANKRD1 ( Kyng et al . 2003 ) . Globally , at 92 h of coasting , the follicle appears to be overwhelmed by apoptosis - promoting signals and developmental competence decrease signals . GFPT2 , VNN1 , and ANKRD1 ( Fig . 3 ) are linked to apoptosis and / or oxidative stress , which is associated with insufﬁcient oxygen supply leading to atresia . Even if early atresia has been associated with developmental competence ( Blondin & Sirard 1995 , Li et al . 2009 ) , it has a negative effect if it is a long - lasting process . Among developmental - competence - associated genes whose expression decreased from 68 to 92 h , KCNJ8 ( Fig . 3 ) was conﬁrmed by real - time PCR to be a potential competence marker . Globally , the proﬁle of this gene over time is positively associated with the proportion of Granulosa cells and oocyte competence in cows 561 www . reproduction - online . org Reproduction ( 2013 ) 145 555 – 565 Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 09 / 26 / 2019 09 : 12 : 33PM via free access medium size follicles , although our analysis was done on pools of follicles . Therefore , progression of gene regulation cannot be directly linked to follicle size . KCNJ8 regulates the ATP response through potassium channels and could signal either protection , like in neurons , or predict atresia by stimulating caspases and apoptotic nucleases ( Perez et al . 2000 ) . KCNJ8 could represent an early marker of terminal differentiation associated with developmental competence . To conclude , this study provides a unique picture of the expression of granulosa genes associated with different degrees of oocyte competence . First , it permitted identiﬁcation of transcription factors ( SMAD7 , STAT1 , and CEBPA ) and canonical pathways ( PRL and GH signaling ) associated with the optimal developmental competence period . Furthermore , it highlighted the importance of extracellular molecules expressed in granulosa cells that potentially reach the oocyte – cumulus complex . Finally , granulosa cell expression was modeled as a progressive gradual hypoxia associated with an increase in apoptosis and inﬂammation . Our study reveals granulosa cell signaling as the potential answer to explain how the oocyte acquires its developmental competence . Materials and Methods All reagents and media supplements used in these experiments were of tissue - culture grade and were obtained from Sigma Chemicals Co . unless otherwise indicated . Granulosa cell’s collection Samples were obtained according to a previously published study protocol ( Nivet et al . 2011 ) . Brieﬂy , commercial milking cycling cows ( n Z 6 ) were stimulated with 3 days of FSH ( 6 ! 40 mg NIH Folltropin - V given at 12 h intervals ) followed by a coasting period of 20 , 44 , 68 , or 92 h . Each animal was exposed to the four conditions and served as its own control ( for a total of 24 OPU ) . The animals were used four times for ovarian aspiration and each session was separated by one or two estrous cycles ( not 24 h ) . Using the same animal sequentially is considered as equivalent if not better than several replicates with different animals . At each OPU scheduled time , transvaginal aspirations of immature oocytes were performed , followed by IVF and in vitro culture to assess the developmental competence of the oocytes . Our evaluation criteria for developmental competence were the ability of the oocyte to develop after fertilization into a transferable blastocyst . This experiment was realized in industry settings , the evaluation of the blastocyst quality was performed according to their standard for embryo transfer ( International Embryo Transfer Society classiﬁcation ) . At the same time , granulosa cells were collected in warm HEPES - buffered Tyrode’s media ( TLH ) containing Hepalean ( 10 IU / ml ) and transferred to the laboratory . Granulosa cells were selected under binocular observation and placed in RNAse - free tubes and were then washed three times with sterile PBS . Cell pellets were snap - frozen in nitrogen and stored at K 80 8 C . Out of the six animals , the same three cows ( for all the four times of aspiration ) were used for microarray analysis and the analysis was done with a within - cow contrast to minimize genetic noise . The theca cell - speciﬁc enzyme cytochrome P450 , family 17 , polypeptide ( CYP17A1 ) was used to assess the possible theca cell contamination of the sample . The expression intensity was never considered positive from 20 to 92 h . Thus , theca cell contamination was considered negligible . RNA extraction and ampliﬁcation Total RNA from each replicate was extracted and puriﬁed using PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . After DNase digestion ( Qiagen ) , the purity , quality , and concentration of extracted RNA were analyzed by Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) . All extracted samples showed good quality with an RNA integrity number O 6 . 9 . For microarray purposes , 5 ng puriﬁed RNAwas ampliﬁed from each individual sample ( n Z 12 ) by in vitro transcription by T7 RNA ampliﬁcation using the RiboAmp HS Plus RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit ( Molecular Devices ) . After two ampliﬁcation rounds of 6 h each , the ampliﬁed RNA ( aRNA ) output was quantiﬁed using the NanoDrop ND - 1000 ( Nano - Drop Technologies , Wilmington , DE , USA ) . Sample labeling and microarray hybridization For each sample , 2 m g aRNA were labeled using the ULS Fluorescent Labelling Kit for Agilent arrays ( with Cy3 and Cy5 ) ( Kreatech Diagnostics , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . The labeled product was then puriﬁed with the Pico - Pure RNA Isolation Kit but without DNase treatment . Labeling efﬁciency was measured using the Nano - Drop ND - 1000 . Samples ( n Z 12 ) were hybridized individually on EmbryoGENE’s bovine 44K microarray ( Robert et al . 2011 ) . Each hybridization was performed in the following design : for each cow individually , each coasting time was compared with others ( i . e . 20 versus 44 h ; 20 versus 68 h ; 20 versus 92 h ; 44 versus 68 h ; 44 versus 92 h , and 68 versus 92 h ) for a total of six comparisons . Overall , 36 hybridizations , corresponding to three cows and six comparisons in dye swap were done . A total of 825 ng of each labeled sample ( Cy3 and Cy5 ) were incubated in a solution containing 2 ! blocking agent and 5 ! fragmentation buffer in a volume of 55 m l at 60 8 C for 15 min and were put on ice immediately after . A 55 m l volume of 2 ! GEx Hybrid - ization Buffer HI - RPM were added for a total volume of 110 m l . The hybridization mix ( 100 m l ) was added onto the array and hybridization was performed at 65 8 C for 17 h using an Agilent Hybridization chamber in a rotating oven . Slides were then washed with Gene Expression Wash Buffer 1 containing 0 . 005 % Triton X - 102 for 3 min at room temperature and then transferred to Gene Expression Wash Buffer 2 containing 0 . 005 % Triton X - 102 for 3 min at 42 8 C . Microarray data analysis The slides were scanned using the Tecan PowerScanner microarray scanner ( Tecan Group Ltd , Ma¨nnerdorf , Switzerland ) 562 A - L Nivet and others Reproduction ( 2013 ) 145 555 – 565 www . reproduction - online . org Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 09 / 26 / 2019 09 : 12 : 33PM via free access and features were extracted using ArrayPro 6 . 4 ( Media Cybernetics , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Intensity ﬁles were analyzed with mean intensities for foreground and median intensities for background with Limma R package . Anova F statistic was used to determine signiﬁcant gene variation during the coasting period . Speciﬁcally , raw data were corrected by background subtraction and then normalized within each array ( Loess ) . Signiﬁcant differences between treatments were determined with a P value ! 0 . 05 . The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI‘s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE40916 . Hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCA ) and PCA analysis were performed with the normalized expression data using Pirouette Lite software ( Infometrix , Inc . , Bothell , WA , USA ) . cDNA preparation and real - time PCR Validation of microarray results was performed by real - time PCR . A 1 ng sample of extracted RNA from three independent samples ( three replicates for each condition ) and the three cows used for microarray hybridization were reverse - tran - scribed using q - Script Flex cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) with oligo - dT ( 20 ) primers following manufacturer’s recommendations . The primers used for real - time RT - PCR were designed using the IDT PrimerQuest tool ( available at Integrated DNA technologies website ) from sequences obtained using the UMD3 . 1 / bosTau5 assemble version of the bovine genome and results from microarray analysis . To conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of each pairs of primers , electrophoresis on a standard 1 . 2 % agarose gel was performed for each ampliﬁed fragment . Primer sequences and accession numbers are provided in Supple - mentary Tables 2 and 3 , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article . Real - time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master and the LightCycler 480 ( Roche Diagnostics ) . The PCR conditions used for all genes were as follows : denaturing cycle for 10 s at 95 8 C ; 50 PCR cycles ( denaturing , 95 8 C for 10 s ; annealing for 10 s ; extension , 72 8 C for 20 s ) , a melting curve ( 95 8 C for 1 s , 65 8 C for 1 s , and a step cycle starting at 72 8 C up to 97 8 C at 0 . 11 8 C / s ) , and a ﬁnal cooling step at 40 8 C . Statistical analysis of real - time PCR results Data analysis was performed using the LightCycler 480 Software 1 . 5 . 0 SP4 ( version 1 . 5 . 0 . 39 ) with the second - derivative maximum analysis method . Analysis of gene expression stability over granulosa cells was performed using the GeNorm VBA applet software ( Vandesompele et al . 2002 ) . The most stable reference genes were identiﬁed by the stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene and recalculating the M values . ACTB , GAPDH , and CHUK were the most stable genes with M values ! 1 . 5 as recommended by the software ( M value Z 1 . 48 ) . One - way ANOVA with the Newman – Keuls post - test was performed on normalized biological replicates , using GraphPad Prism version 5 . 00 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Functional analysis of differential gene expression DAVID software was used to group - overrepresented functions of differentially expressed genes or positive genes into clusters and to identify transcription factors associated with the uploaded list as described ( Huang da et al . 2009 ) . Data were analyzed through the use of IPA ( Ingenuity Systems , www . ingenuity . com ) . A data set containing gene identiﬁers and corresponding differential expression values was uploaded into in the application . Each identiﬁer was mapped to its corresponding object in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base . The functional analysis identiﬁed the biological functions that were most signiﬁcant to the data set . Right - tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a P value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to that data set was due to chance alone . Canonical pathway analysis identiﬁed the pathways from the IPA library that were most signiﬁcant to the data set . The signiﬁcance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways : i ) a ratio of the number of molecules from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway and ii ) Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a P value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the data set and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone .
