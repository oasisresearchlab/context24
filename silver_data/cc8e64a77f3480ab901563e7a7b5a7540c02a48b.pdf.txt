Could this lack of price transparency lead to differential pricing ? To answer this question , we present a generalized framework to audit online markets for differential pricing using automated agents . Consensus is a key idea in our work : for a successful black - box audit , both the experimenter and seller must agree on the agents’ attributes . We audit two competitive online travel markets on kayak . com ( flight and hotel markets ) and construct queries representative of the demand for goods . Crucially , we assume ignorance of the sellers’ pricing mechanisms while conducting these audits . We conservatively implement consensus with nine distinct profiles based on behavior , not demographics . We use a structural causal model for price differences and estimate model parameters using Bayesian inference . We can unambiguously show that many sellers ( but not all ) demonstrate behavior - driven differential pricing . In the flight market , some profiles are nearly 90 % more likely to see a worse price than the best performing profile , and nearly 60 % more likely in the hotel market . While the control profile ( with no browsing history ) was on average offered the best prices in the flight market , surprisingly , other profiles outperformed the control in the hotel market . The price difference between any pair of profiles occurring by chance is $ 0 . 44 in the flight market and $ 0 . 09 for hotels . However , the expected loss of welfare for any profile when compared to the best profile can be as much as $ 6 . 00 for flights and $ 3 . 00 for hotels ( i . e . , 15 × and 33 × the price difference by chance respectively ) . This illustrates the need for new market designs or policies that encourage more transparent market design to overcome differential pricing practices .

You would be frustrated to learn that the seller charged you a higher price due to your online behavior . This raises the question — does the design of typical online markets encourage differential treatment of buyers ? In this work , we show a causal link between behavioral tracking and differential pricing in online markets . Many online markets lack one key feature : price transparency . We say that a market exhibits price transparency if sellers do not withhold prices of previous transactions from consumers . In a trans - parent market ( Figure 1a ) , buyers can be sure that sellers are offering the same price to different consumers for identical goods at the same time ; this price is listed publicly . In an opaque market ( Fig - ure 1b ) , consumers cannot be confident that sellers are offering the same price to different consumers for identical goods at the same time ; the only price they see is private . Given massive transaction volumes online ( nearly 150 million yearly travel bookings [ 18 ] ) ; personalized pricing can cause significant loss to consumers even if sellers employ differential pricing with small probability . There are several broad strategies used to study differential treatment . Auditing online markets using automated agents ( ‘sock - puppets’ ) with different constructed attributes is one . Scholars have found disparate treatment in protected markets [ 6 , 17 ] ( the em - ployment and housing markets are protected by federal statutes in the US ) and other online markets [ 25 , 26 , 28 , 31 ] . In general , these techniques assume that the sellers can correctly infer and act upon the sock - puppets’ attributes . A second method is to theoretically model the market [ 40 ] and develop policy recommendations based on fairness criteria . But in practice , we often lack follow - up work studying the effects of implementing these fair mechanisms in the real world . Finally , another important approach is to develop seller - pricing algorithms that satisfy fairness criteria [ 67 ] . One challenge , however , is that we cannot ensure that all sellers will use these fair pricing algorithms . In this paper , we conduct sock - puppet audits of two non - transparent online markets to discover differential pricing . We assume ignorance of the sellers’ pricing mechanisms , and construct queries representative of varied demand for goods in these markets . Consensus is a key idea in our work : for a successful black - box 717 FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Karan , Balepur , Sundaram 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) 𝑘 𝑖 𝑗 𝑔 𝑖 𝑔 𝑗 ≡ ⇔ ( a ) : transparent price 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) 𝑘 𝑘 𝑖 𝑗 𝑔 𝑖 𝑔 𝑗 ≡ ≠ ( b ) : opaque price Figure 1 : In a transparent market ( a ) , a seller 𝑘 offers equiva - lent goods ( 𝑔 𝑖 , 𝑔 𝑗 ) to buyers ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) at equal prices ( 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) = 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) ) . Transparent markets can be online or in - person ( e . g . , the online stock exchange or an in - person grocery store ) . In an opaque market ( b ) , a seller 𝑘 offers equivalent goods ( 𝑔 𝑖 , 𝑔 𝑗 ) to buyers ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) at unequal prices ( 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) ≠ 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) ) . Opaque markets too can be online or in - person ( e . g . , an online flight market or in - person housing market ) . audit , we need to show that both the experimenter ( auditor ) and seller agree on buyer attributes . Having established consensus , we can ascribe the seller’s change in price between two buyers for the same good at the same time to only the difference in attributes . We implement consensus in our audit with nine distinct profiles based on behavior , not demographics . We use a structural causal model for price differences and estimate model parameters using Bayesian inference . We audit a large online flight market M 𝐹 , and a large online hotel market M 𝐻 ( both at kayak . com ) with nine distinct profiles . In M 𝐹 , we execute 112 distinct queries every day for 58 days , collecting 1 . 1M records resulting in 4 . 2M price comparisons . In M 𝐻 , we execute 50 distinct queries over 116 days , collecting 3 . 6M records resulting in 11 . 1M price comparisons . In M 𝐹 and M 𝐻 , we can unambiguouslyshow thatmany sellers ( but notall ) demonstrate behavior - driven differential pricing . The probability that any pair of profiles will see a price difference by chance in M 𝐹 is 8 . 3 % ; in M 𝐻 it is 2 . 3 % . However , for some profiles and some sellers in M 𝐹 , the probability of a price difference when compared to the best performing profile can be as high as 90 % ; in M 𝐻 it can be high as 60 % . The price difference between any pair of profiles occurring by chance is $ 0 . 44 in M 𝐹 and $ 0 . 09 in M 𝐻 . However , the expected increase in price for a profile in comparison to the best performing profile can range as high as $ 6 . 00 in M 𝐹 and $ 3 . 00 in M 𝐻 . In non - transparent markets with millions of transactions , this is a significant impact . Our contributions are as follows : Generalizable Auditing with Consensus : Our insight is that explicitly establishing experimenter - seller consensus regarding buyer identity is critical to conducting audits . In contrast , past work on ad - delivery [ 6 , 17 ] , and price [ 25 , 26 , 28 , 31 , 38 ] implic - itly assumes consensus — that the party audited can successfully infer the attributes of the agent set by the researcher , and uses those attributes in its response . We conservatively establish con - sensus via distinct behaviors , making no assumptions about demographic inferences made by the seller . Our framework for auditing non - transparent online markets generalizes to other online markets . Causal Differential Treatment : We show significant causal , seller - dependent differential treatment of our profiles in two markets . In contrast , past work [ 62 ] could not establish differen - tial treatment in travel prices due to confounds . We develop a structural causal model [ 51 ] to identify causal factors for price difference and account for common confounds . We infer model parameters through a Bayesian framework ( novel in auditing ) . In online flight ticket and hotel booking markets we find differ - ential pricing dependent on behavior - based profiles . Opacity of these markets enables this outcome — transparent market design is needed to overcome differential pricing . 1 2 RELATED WORK In our work we focus on identifying differential pricing on the basis of behavior . Though we do not aim to audit for bias against any specific demographic group , we do draw from the methods of works that have done so . We utilize prior work to inform our audit methodology and structural causal model . Auditing Markets Protected by Statutes : In the United States , the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 offer protection against employment and housing discrimination on the bases of race , religion , national origin , and sex [ 13 , 42 ] . Focusing on these markets , both government [ 44 ] and private organizations have conducted studies to determine whether lenders [ 54 , 68 ] or em - ployers [ 7 , 21 ] are violating these statutes . In online settings , Datta et al . [ 17 ] and Asplund et al . [ 6 ] use sock - puppet audits to find profile - based discrimination in employment and housing ads respectively . Other works measure bias present in hiring and career recommendation algorithms and propose fixes — usu - ally via algorithms which satisfy some definition of fairness [ 10 , 23 , 29 , 32 , 52 , 65 ] . Auditing Unprotected Online Markets : In other markets , no U . S . federal law explicitly forbids price discrimination based on protected attributes . In such markets , similar products ( e . g . , de - odorant , disposable razors ) may be priced differently depending on the target gender , without legal repercussions [ 12 ] . Note that in this case the differential pricing is due to marketing or segmentation of the product , rather than being dependent on the buyer’s identity ( though the product and buyer are likely correlated ) . Hannak et al . [ 25 ] audit various e - commerce web - sites by collecting the cookies of real - world users . This provides more ecological validity than constructed profiles in typical sock - puppet audits , but still does not guarantee consensus — we do not know what the seller infers . Similar work was done by Hin - dermann [ 26 ] , Iordanou et al . [ 31 ] . Xu et al . [ 67 ] recognize that price personalization on e - commerce websites exists , and pro - pose fairer personalization policies . However , we cannot guaran - tee that sellers will utilize these fairer policies . Vissers et al . [ 62 ] claim that differences in airline ticket prices could come from several hard - to - discern factors . Our sock - puppets and paired - comparison model addresses some of the difficulties mentioned . Mikians et al . [ 38 ] train personas based on personal ( e . g . , afflu - ent or budget - conscious ) , geographic , and technological / system 1 Code to train agents and model data can be found at https : / / github . com / CrowdDynamicsLab / browsing - history - cost 718 Your Browsing History May Cost You FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA information . They then query websites for different products and find price discrimination on these profile attributes . Auditing ML Systems : The first major works on detecting and mitigating algorithmic bias focused on the resulting policies and major social implications of biased algorithms [ 4 , 48 ] . Costa - jussà et al . [ 14 ] , Matthews et al . [ 37 ] , Park et al . [ 50 ] all propose methodologies for assessing bias in machine learning : specifically gender bias in machine learning , fairness and security of machine learning algorithms , and bias in word embeddings . Feng and Shah [ 22 ] investigate whether search engines properly mitigate gender bias , and propose new fair ranking algorithms that could defend against adversarial attacks , along with Tsioutsiouliklis et al . [ 60 ] . These audits for bias have grown substantially over the past several years [ 15 ] . Some are done in conjunction with system providers [ 65 ] , which can lead to charges of conflict of interest [ 69 ] . Crucially many of these audits [ 1 ] require using explicit input features which may not be available in all settings . Ad - Tracking Ecosystem : Researchers have also investigated the connection between web browsing and the ad ecosystem itself . Understanding the link between browsing behavior and per - sonalization online is vital to the validity of our experimental design . Angwin [ 3 ] , Englehardt et al . [ 20 ] , Sipior et al . [ 58 ] study the implications of web tracking for users . Prior work has at - tempted to determine how browsing behavior and user attributes covary [ 34 ] , however covariation does not guarantee consensus even if found . Price Discrimination : Price discrimination in economics refers to the effort of firms to selectively charge based on the buyer’s willingness to pay for a specific product [ 39 , 61 ] . The ability of firms to engage in price discrimination depends heavily on the competitiveness of the market [ 59 ] . Note that willingness to pay can depend on the opacity of the market ; most consumers dislike when prices are personalized and may not pay more if they know another consumer is being offered a lower price [ 70 ] . Previous works try to determine how differential pricing affects consumers . Dubé and Misra [ 19 ] find theoretically and empiri - cally that the total consumer surplus decreased under personal - ized pricing compared to uniform pricing ; however , a majority of consumers actually ended up better off . Khan [ 33 ] explores the rise of Amazon via predatory pricing behaviors . There has also been related work on discrimination unrelated to price . The theoretical model by Monachou and Ashlagi [ 40 ] describes bi - ased hiring behavior — employers discriminate against workers based on their ( perceived ) social status . They find that minority workers receive lower payoffs and propose a matching strategy that decreases discrimination . Cui et al . [ 16 ] discover that posi - tive reviews on Airbnb decrease discrimination against guests with African - American sounding names . Transparency in Markets : In seminal work , Bloomfield and O’Hara [ 9 ] find that varying market transparency can affect market equilibria and both trader and market - maker welfare . Scalia [ 57 ] conducts a case study on Italian bonds , and finds that decreasing transparency leads to higher liquidity and lower volatility . Ionascu et al . [ 30 ] study how market transparency affects housing prices , and find that a decrease in transparency is related to an increase in prices . Researchers also consider market design in general ; Levy and Barocas [ 35 ] consider ten categories of design and policy choices to determine which may decrease discrimination in online markets . Armstrong [ 5 ] finds that whether consumers overall are better off depends heavily on market structure . 3 PROBLEM STATEMENT Consider a large online market M for indivisible goods 𝐺 , with a set of buyers 𝑁 and sellers 𝑆 . Each buyer 𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 has attributes 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 ( e . g . , age , behaviors ) ; we refer to 𝑎 𝑖 as the profile of individual 𝑖 . Buyer 𝑖 issues a query 𝑞 ∈ 𝑄 , where 𝑄 is the set of all valid queries in this market . A query 𝑞 is defined both by the query text and the time at which it was executed ( i . e . , two queries for “blue t - shirts” executed at different times are not identical ) . The set of goods relevant to this query is denoted 𝐺 𝑞 . Each seller 𝑘 ∈ 𝑆 is only able to sell a subset of these goods , and of these , they offer a subset to each buyer 𝑖 . The market M aggregates the responses of all sellers and reveals to each buyer 𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 , the set of goods relevant to the query : 𝐺 𝑞𝑖 . Each good 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺 has attributes 𝑏 𝑔 , a vector of product details . The price of the good in dollars is notated 𝜌 ( 𝑔 ) . Assume two buyers 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 issue identical queries 𝑞 at the same time . In response , assume that seller 𝑘 ∈ 𝑆 reveals to buyers 𝑖 , 𝑗 , goods 𝑔 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 𝑞𝑖 and 𝑔 𝑗 ∈ 𝐺 𝑞𝑗 respectively . We say that the goods 𝑔 𝑖 , 𝑔 𝑗 are equivalent ( i . e . , 𝑔 𝑖 ≡ 𝑔 𝑗 ) if two conditions hold : ( 1 ) the two goods have identical product details , ( i . e . , 𝑏 𝑔 𝑖 = 𝑏 𝑔 𝑗 ) , and ( 2 ) 𝑔 𝑖 and 𝑔 𝑗 are sold by the same seller 𝑘 at the same time . We say a market lacks price transparency if individuals 𝑖 and 𝑗 cannot be sure that 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) = 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) , when 𝑔 𝑖 ≡ 𝑔 𝑗 . Assume that two buyers 𝑖 and 𝑗 with attributes 𝑎 𝑖 ≠ 𝑎 𝑗 issue identical queries 𝑞 ( i . e . , at the same time ) , in market M with sellers 𝑆 . For the following questions , assume that good 𝑔 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 𝑞𝑖 , good 𝑔 𝑗 ∈ 𝐺 𝑞𝑗 , and 𝑔 𝑖 ≡ 𝑔 𝑗 . We ask : RQ 1 ( Differential Treatment ) For all buyers 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 what is the probability that 𝑖 and 𝑗 are offered different prices for equiv - alent goods , by the same seller , at the same time ? RQ 2 ( Differential Loss ) For all buyers 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 what is the expected dollar amount lost ? Our research questions are significant . Differential pricing could cause major welfare loss to consumers , but most online markets do not have laws regulating this . Moreover , much of the existing work on differential pricing [ 6 , 25 ] focuses on steering of goods ( i . e . , where 𝑏 𝑔 𝑖 ≠ 𝑏 𝑔 𝑗 ) while we focus on price differences between equivalent goods . 4 THE CONSENSUS CHALLENGE Establishing experimenter - seller consensus on the buyer’s at - tributes is critical to a successful black - box audit . To test for the existence of differential treatment , RQ 1 ( i . e . , P ( 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) ≠ 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) ) ) , we must be able to experimentally manipulate attributes 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑗 of individuals 𝑖 and 𝑗 respectively . Moreover , we must ensure that the seller perceives the same difference in attributes . Audits of online and physical markets differ in their abilities to guarantee consensus . Consider a typical physical audit conducted by the U . S . Depart - ment of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) ; two individuals , 719 FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Karan , Balepur , Sundaram differing only by a protected attribute ( e . g . , a young White male and young Black male ) contact brokers and observe which housing op - tions and prices are shown to them [ 64 ] . When constructing these audits , the auditor ensures that the broker perceives a difference in the race ( not gender or age ) of the buyers , either by physical appearance or racially - coded names [ 47 ] . In many online marketplaces , sellers do not receive clear signals regarding the identities of the buyers . Early work on bias in employ - ment ads [ 17 ] used automated agents with explicitly set attributes via Google Ad settings . Google and other companies now disallow this practice . Can we successfully manipulate attributes without direct access ? As Papadopoulos et al . [ 49 ] carefully document , a large number of corporations track individuals’ movements over the web , infer - ring detailed behavioral profiles for each person , including demo - graphic information ( e . g . , gender , race , age ) and interests . However , the process of inferring individual attributes from website visits is not well - understood , and tracking companies may differ in their inference methods . Furthermore , since sellers may use inferences made by different tracking companies , sellers may make different inferences about the same behavior . We anchor the notion of consensus in this work to an individual 𝑖 ’s online behavior : the set of websites visited , 𝑤 𝑖 ∈ W . That is , we set 𝑎 𝑖 = 𝑤 𝑖 , where 𝑤 𝑖 is the set of websites visited by individual 𝑖 . In our work , 𝑎 𝑖 refers to behavior , and not demographic attributes . We make two conservative assumptions : ( a ) individuals are tracked and ( b ) both seller and experimenter agree that the individuals behaved distinctly ; this is key to our model . We consider the behavior of two profiles distinct if they visited different sets of websites . We make no assumptions about the technology used for tracking , who tracks the individual , or the inferences made by the trackers . Findings by Papadopoulos et al . [ 49 ] support our assumptions . The authors state that we can find trackers on almost all websites , with Google and Facebook trackers found on over 90 % of websites . Our own investigation of website trackers also supports this claim . 5 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In this section we discuss which markets we audited ( Section 5 . 1 ) , how we constructed behavioral profiles ( Section 5 . 2 ) , and the data collection process ( Section 5 . 3 ) . 5 . 1 Markets Audited We required online marketplaces with the following properties for our audits : the market offers a large number of indivisible goods ; goods are offered by multiple sellers ; goods are uniquely identifiable by the same properties ; goods are consistently offered ; the market is liquid ; an account is not required to purchase goods . Some well - known online markets do not have these desired properties . For example , though amazon . com offers a large number and variety of indivisible goods , there may not be multiple sellers for each good , creating a confound in our analysis . This led us to examine two markets , online flight tickets ( M 𝐹 ) and online hotel bookings ( M 𝐻 ) , via an aggregator ( kayak . com ) . In these markets , each good may be available for sale by multiple different sellers . In M 𝐹 we observed 34 sellers ; in M 𝐻 there were 427 . We anonymize sellers in each market , labelling them “First Party” if they operate flights or own hotels , and “Third Party” oth - erwise . Our numbering convention for flight sellers is 1 - indexed and 1000 - indexed for hotel sellers . 5 . 2 Behavioral Profile Construction Our goal in training profiles was to create distinct profiles that help establish consensus . We set the web - browsing behavior of the agent 𝑤 𝑗 ∈ W to be the defining attribute 𝑎 𝑗 . We obtain these website lists 𝑤 𝑗 from existing literature [ 2 , 6 ] . Agarwal et al . [ 2 ] conducted work on hyper - partisan tracking , and constructed website lists for profiles based on the demographics of visitors to these websites as reported by alexa . com from October 2018 ( Alexa has since been retired ) . In order to create relatively compact profiles , the authors used the amount of unique cookie information as a stopping crite - rion — i . e . , when the number of unique cookies stabilizes , the profile construction is complete . Asplund et al . [ 6 ] conducted an online housing market audit ; to construct profiles , they collected websites’ demographic information from Quantcast ( quantcast . com ) . They added a website to a particular demographic profile if that website was more that 1 . 4 times more popular than the average website within that demographic , while being of average popularity for other groups . Prior work associates demographic ( gender and age ) attributes with these sets of websites . Asplund et al . [ 6 ] tried to validate the identity of their profiles indirectly using correlation , but this was insufficient to guarantee consensus due to unobserved confounds . We do not make assumptions about demographic attributes because we cannot guarantee that our inferences match those of the seller . The resulting profiles from prior work are male ( M A , M B ) , female ( F A , F B ) , youth ( Y A , Y B ) , and senior ( S A , S B ) profiles from [ 2 ] and [ 6 ] respectively , as well as a control profile ( no websites visited — equivalent to incognito browsing ) . We utilize initials ( e . g . , M A ) in this paper to de - emphasize identity while allowing readers to make correspondences with original cited work . 5 . 3 Data Collection Input : market M , queries 𝑄 , agents N ( each with website lists 𝑤 𝑖 ∈ 𝑊 ) , query days 𝐷 Output : Records 𝑅 1 for 𝑡 ∈ 𝐷 do 2 for 𝑞 ∈ 𝑄 ( 𝑡 ) do 3 for 𝑖 ∈ N do 4 𝑖 visits websites 𝑤 𝑖 ∈ 𝑊 5 end 6 In parallel processes , every agent queries market M with 𝑞 7 Market shows agent 𝑖 goods 𝑔 as record 𝑟 𝑖 8 𝑅 ← 𝑅 ∪ ( ∪ 𝑖 𝑟 𝑖 ) 9 end 10 end Algorithm 1 : Data Collection Process We collect data by building off code by Datta et al . [ 17 ] ; see Algorithm 1 . Specifically , we visit the website list 𝑤 𝑖 for agent 𝑖 720 Your Browsing History May Cost You FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA each day prior to executing each query . For the daily website visits we use a new browsing session for each agent with no previous cookie information carried over . This ensures that the agents differ only in browsing behavior . We executed queries for all flight routes on July 6 – July 31 , Oct 14 – Nov 8 , and Dec 4 – Dec 9 , 2021 . An example flight query is : “find roundtrip tickets from Los Angeles ( LAX ) to Chicago ( ORD ) departing June 11 , 2023 and returning June 16 , 2023 . ” The system then aggregates relevant results , of which we collected the first page ( ∼ 20 per page ) . For hotels , we looked at stays from Oct 4 , 2022 – Jan 27 , 2023 . An example a hotel stay query is : “find one hotel room in Chicago from June 11 , 2023 to June 16 , 2023 for one guest . ” The aggregator would again offer relevant results , from which we collected the first 5 results for each star clas - sification of hotel ( 5 ★ , 4 ★ , etc . ) . For each hotel shown , we collected every room configuration ( e . g . , king bed , queen bed with breakfast included , etc . ) . From M 𝐹 we collected 1 . 1M records from 34 sellers ( 9 first party and 25 third party ) , where the average ticket price was $ 270 . 45 . From M 𝐻 we collected 3 . 6M records from 427 sellers ( 23 third party and the rest first party ) where the average room cost was $ 271 . 99 . As described in Section 3 , we compare equivalent goods from the same seller to detect differential treatment of pro - files . After processing our dataset to find the equivalent goods from the same sellers , we had 4 . 2M and 11 . 1M unique price comparisons between profiles for flights and hotels respectively . Further details are in Appendix C . 6 MODELING DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT AND PRICE DIFFERENCES In this section we give details of our structural causal model ( Sec - tion 6 . 1 ) , main model parameter estimation ( Section 6 . 2 ) , and model for price differences ( Section 6 . 3 ) . 6 . 1 Structural Causal Model In this audit , we experimentally control profiles 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 and queries 𝑞 ∈ 𝑄 . To eliminate confounds which may influence the price of a good , we model the effect of profile variation on price differences , rather than the effect of profile on price . We use the structural causal model ( SCM ) framework ( introduced by Wright [ 66 ] but more recently popularized by Pearl [ 51 ] ) to identify our price dif - ference model . An SCM encodes causal relations between factors that the modeler believes could affect the outcome . In these causal diagrams ( DAGs ) , 𝑥 → 𝑦 means 𝑥 causes 𝑦 . Consider this causal model for ticket price ( 𝑃 ) in Figure 2a . We experimentally control 𝐴 and 𝑄 , hence no arrow . A query 𝑄 to the market causes the market to aggregate seller responses for the buyer . Thus we expect the query 𝑄 to cause the seller 𝐾 to appear ( i . e . , 𝑄 → 𝐾 ) . For a buyer to see good 𝐺 , both the query and the seller must cause it ( i . e . , 𝑄 → 𝐺 ← 𝐾 ) to appear . The seller 𝐾 , the good 𝐺 ’s attributes , and unobserved market confounds 𝑈 2 ( e . g . , supply and demand ) may all affect the price ( 𝑃 ) directly . If the seller knows the identity of the buyer ( i . e . , the profile 𝐴 ) , then their interaction ( 𝑍 ) may affect the price ( i . e . , 𝑍 → 𝑃 ) . The profile ( 𝐴 ) cannot affect price directly , but may through an unobserved confound 𝑈 1 ( e . g . , the market M may track the buyer independent of any seller and influence the results ) . Notice two key challenges : a seller 𝐾 may have a sophisticated pricing algorithm independent of the buyer , and unknown to us . Second , unobserved confounds like supply and demand ( 𝑈 2 ) may obscure the effect of changing the profile on price . We cannot estimate differential treatment by modeling price directly , because we cannot estimate these effects on price . The DAG for price difference eliminates unobserved confounds . We answer RQ 1 by examining if changing the profile from 𝐴 𝑖 to 𝐴 𝑗 causes a change in the price ( 𝑃 𝑖 ≠ 𝑃 𝑗 ? ) , while conditioning on seller , query , and good . Figure 2b is the DAG for prices shown to two different profiles 𝐴 𝑖 , 𝐴 𝑗 by the same seller 𝐾 , conditioned on query 𝑄 for a particular good 𝐺 . Notice that the seller ( 𝐾 ) , the good attributes ( 𝐺 ) , and the unobserved external factors ( 𝑈 2 ) are all directly affecting both prices 𝑃 𝑖 and 𝑃 𝑗 . We show the direct effects on the two profiles with different colors for clarity . Because of their common direct effect on each price ( for the same good 𝐺 ) , the seller 𝐾 , the good attributes ( 𝐺 ) and the external effect 𝑈 2 cannot cause any price difference 𝑃 𝑖 ≠ 𝑃 𝑗 . A seller 𝐾 can indirectly affect prices through the interaction 𝑍 𝑖 , 𝑍 𝑗 with the profiles . Unobserved confound 𝑈 1 was also not eliminated because it can affect profiles differently , thus causing a price difference . The DAG we use after eliminating these arrows is Figure 2c . 6 . 2 Model Parameter Estimation We use Bayesian inference to model the probability that one profile will see a higher price than another for the same seller and good given a query ( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) . We model the outcome with a Bernoulli dis - tribution with parameter 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 , the probability that buyers 𝑖 , 𝑗 will see different prices conditioned on the same seller 𝑘 ( Equation ( 1 ) ) . The outcome 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ∈ { 0 , 1 } is conditioned on the same good 𝑔 , but we do not include 𝑔 in the equations for clarity . Notice that outcome 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 is equivalent to asking if 𝑃 𝑖 ≠ 𝑃 𝑗 in Figure 2c . 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ∼ Ber ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) ( 1 ) Logit ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) = ¯ 𝑝 + ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 𝑗 ) + ( 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 − 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑗 ) ( 2 ) 𝛽 𝑖 ∼ N ( ¯ 𝛽 , 𝛽 𝜎 ) ( 3 ) ¯ 𝛽 ∼ N ( 0 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) ( 4 ) 𝛽 𝜎 ∼ Exp ( 1 . 0 ) ( 5 ) 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 ∼ N ( 0 . 0 , 0 . 25 ) ( 6 ) ¯ 𝑝 ∼ N ( − 3 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) ( 7 ) Equation ( 2 ) gives the logit link function to estimate the prob - ability 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 . Notice similarities to the Bradley - Terry Model [ 11 ] which predicts the outcomes of paired comparisons . We can model the effect of the profile 𝑎 𝑖 through the unobserved confound with parameter 𝛽 𝑖 . These parameters affect the probability of seeing a different price through the difference in their direct effects , ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 𝑗 ) . We capture the seller - profile interaction effect through the parame - ter 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 . As a reminder , this is the only way a seller can influence price difference ( see Figure 2c , where 𝑍 𝑖 is an interaction variable ) . This parameter helps us answer to what extent the price difference reflects sellers’ strategies . Thus , we introduce 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 − 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑗 , the dif - ference of the interaction effects to understand their effect on the price difference . Equation ( 3 ) shows our multi - level modeling for the direct ef - fects 𝛽 . We draw 𝛽 𝑖 from a common prior N ( ¯ 𝛽 , 𝛽 𝜎 ) , pooling and 721 FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Karan , Balepur , Sundaram 𝐴 𝐾 𝑄 𝐺 𝑍 𝑃 𝑈 1 𝑈 2 ( a ) : DAG for price 𝐴 𝑖 𝑈 1 𝑍 𝑖 𝑃 𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 𝑈 1 𝑍 𝑗 𝑃 𝑗 𝐾 𝑄 𝐺 𝑈 2 ( b ) : DAG for two prices 𝐴 𝑖 𝑈 1 𝑍 𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 𝑈 1 𝑍 𝑗 𝑃 𝑖 ≠ 𝑃 𝑗 ?

Figure ( c ) , the DAG for price difference , eliminates direct effects of seller , good , and market conditions . regularizing our estimates for 𝛽 𝑖 . We use weakly informative priors for ¯ 𝛽 , 𝛽 𝜎 , and 𝛿 𝑖 , 𝑘 ( Equations 4 through 6 ) . We set the mean of the prior for both ¯ 𝛽 and 𝛿 𝑖 , 𝑘 to be 0 , because a priori , we do not expect either to affect the outcome . Finally , Equation ( 7 ) shows the prior for ¯ 𝑝 , which gives the proba - bility we see a difference in price purely by chance . Our prior belief is that there is no differential treatment in the market . This is why the mean 𝜇 of the prior for ¯ 𝑝 is set to 𝜇 = − 3 . On the logit scale , this implies that prior probability of seeing a price difference is ≈ 4 . 7 % ; 𝜇 = 0 would imply the prior belief of observing a price difference by chance was 50 % . In the case of a single seller market , one can remove Equation ( 6 ) and the 𝛿 parameters in Equation ( 2 ) ; any effect of that single seller will be subsumed by the 𝛽 parameters . We implemented the model in NumPyro ( num . pyro . ai ) [ 8 , 53 ] using SVI ( Stochastic Variational Inference ) [ 27 ] . We opt for SVI because the size of our datasets ( 4 . 2M observations for M 𝐹 and 11 . 1M for M 𝐻 ) makes MCMC too computationally expensive to be feasible . Our original MCMC implementation for M 𝐹 ran for 163 hours on a 10 core , 3 . 6GHz iMac with an Intel Core i9 processor , and then crashed . 6 . 3 Model for Price Differences To answer RQ 2 : the expected dollar loss that a profile incurs , we create the mixture model depicted in Figure 6 in Appendix B . This model in aggregate has the effect of a zero - inflated Gaussian . Our idea for this mixture model is to use the probability of a price difference outputted by our original model ( 1 ) , and multiply this by the expected price different between profiles when it exists . This will give us the expected dollar loss of each profile 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 compared to 𝑎 𝑗 ∈ 𝐴 . We calculate it as follows , where 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 − 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 is the expected price difference between profiles 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑗 when it exists : E [ 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) − 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) ] = 0 × ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) + ( 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 − 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) = ( 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 − 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) × ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) . Thus , to find the expected loss , we need a model that gives us the dollar difference 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 − 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 as an output . We already know ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) , as this is the output of our original model . We choose to tackle the modeling in this way because our price difference data ( in dollars ) is zero - inflated — most of the time , sellers offer profiles the same price for the same object , resulting in a $ 0 . 00 price difference . Though we were able to easily model the zero - inflated data with the Bernoulli distribution ( see ¯ 𝑝 in Equation ( 2 ) ) , we expected that the price - difference data would result in a Gauss - ian distribution , and introducing ¯ 𝑝 to a Gaussian distribution does not have the same affect of skewing the data toward an outcome of zero . Thus we needed to model the zeros separately from the non - zeros . This model is quite similar to the original , however we only look at a subset of the data . 190k of the rows out of 4 . 2M for flights and 204k out of 11 . 1M for hotels in our original datasets have a nonzero price differences — these rows are the input to this model . The differences in the model itself are minimal : we simply model the outcome with a normal distribution rather than Bernoulli , and change some of the prior distributions to match the shift to dollar outcome . This model is fully detailed in Appendix B . 7 RESULTS In this section we give the results of our model , first to answer RQ 1 ( Section 7 . 1 ) then RQ 2 ( Section 7 . 2 ) . 7 . 1 RQ 1 : Differential Treatment We observe differential treatment across profiles ; the degree is seller dependent . Figure 3 illustrates differential treatment for three select sellers in the flight and hotel markets respectively ( full results in Appendix A ) . Consider Figure 3a in detail , which gives results for a flight seller . The figure shows for each profile 𝑎 𝑖 , the posterior probability of receiving a higher price than control ( 𝐶 ) for this seller . The black reference line is the probability ( 8 . 3 % ) that any pair of profiles see different prices by chance , even if 𝛽 𝑖 = 𝛽 𝑐 and 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 = 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑐 ( see Equa - tion ( 2 ) ) . We show the 89 % HDPI region for each density 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑐 | 𝑘 . We see that profiles M B , F B , Y B , S B receive significantly different prices ( i . e . , the curves do not overlap ) . Similarly , all profiles M A , F A , Y A , S A differ significantly in terms of price . Some profiles also receive simi - lar treatment ; F A and Y B do not differ significantly in the probability of seeing a worse price than 𝐶 . Looking at profiles designed to rep - resent the same demographic groups — we observe that S A is 96 % to 97 % more likely to see a higher flight price than 𝐶 while S B is 39 % to 49 % more likely , with no overlap in the HPDI intervals .

The top row shows a comparison with the control profile in the flight market and the bottom row shows a comparison with M B in the hotel market . The plots show 89 % HPDI regions ; non - overlapping regions imply significant differences in effects . The reference value , a black vertical line , represents the base probability of any profile seeing a worse price than any other by chance . Some sellers demonstrate large , distinctive differences : in ( a ) M A , S A have a greater than 90 % chance of seeing a worse price than control . In ( d ) we see that the control profile has nearly a 60 % chance of seeing a worse price than M B . Not all sellers engage in much differential pricing between profiles ( First Party 2 in ( c ) and First Party 1002 in ( f ) ) . posterior distribution variance for 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑐 | 𝑘 differs by profile for this seller as well : S A has lower variance than S B . Now consider Figure 3e , which gives results for a hotel seller . In this figure , we show for each profile 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 , the posterior probability of receiving a higher price than M B . Our reference profile for M 𝐻 is M B because this is the profile that received the best treatment from sellers on average . The black reference line here is at 2 . 3 % , representing the probability that two profiles see different prices by chance . We see that the control profile stands apart from others , having between a 52 % and 66 % chance of seeing a higher hotel price than M B . Profiles F A , S A and Y A cluster together from 10 % to 15 % and Y B , F B are around 28 % to 41 % . We can also observe that between these two clusters there is a noticeable difference in the width of HDPI intervals . The differential treatment we detected in these markets can come from two sources : 1 ) interaction between seller and profile , and 2 ) factors independent of the seller ( e . g . , the market itself ) . First , how much of the differential treatment between profiles 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑗 is due to the seller , profile interaction alone ? To answer this question , we examine the interaction effect variable 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 in Equation ( 2 ) . We show a subset of the 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 in Figure 4 , highlighting sellers with the most and least variation across profiles ( full results in Appendix A ) . Let us revisit the seller Third Party 1 in M 𝐹 . Notice that for this seller , 𝛿 𝑘 , S A = + 1 . 89 while 𝛿 𝑘 , S B = − 0 . 55 . We now want to calculate the odds of seeing a price increase if we were to change from profile S B to S A . Let 𝑂 𝑗 , 𝑖 | 𝑘 be the odds of seeing a price increase when comparing profile 𝑎 𝑖 to 𝑎 𝑗 , for seller 𝑘 . With a little algebra on Equation ( 2 ) , we show that the change in odds for profile 𝑎 𝑗 is : 𝑂 𝑗 , 𝑖 | 𝑘 = Exp ( 𝛽 𝑗 − 𝛽 𝑖 ) (cid:124) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:125) Non - seller effect × Exp ( 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑗 − 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 ) (cid:124) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:125) Seller effect ( 8 ) Thus , when changing from S B to S A , for this seller , the odds of seeing a higher price increased by a factor of Exp ( 𝛿 𝑘 , S A − 𝛿 𝑘 , S B ) = 11 . 47 . S A is more than 11 times more likely to see a worse price than S B . Conversely , some cases result in little effect on the odds . For seller Third Party 1015 in M 𝐻 , we can calculate a similar ratio : 𝛿 𝑘 , M B = + 1 . 72 while 𝛿 𝑘 , c = − 1 . 57 . Here , the control is 26 . 84 times more likely ( Exp ( 𝛿 𝑘 , M B − 𝛿 𝑘 , c ) ) to see a worse price than M B . Next , consider the effect of factors independent of seller on differ - ential treatment . Recall that in Figure 2c we posited an unobserved confound 𝑈 1 . One possibility is that the market M mediates ( via 𝑈 1 ) the prices by examining the profile . In our model , the coefficients 𝛽 𝑖 in Equation ( 2 ) explain this effect . We show these coefficients in Table 1 ; all posteriors have sharp HPDI intervals . For the profiles S A and S B in M 𝐹 , the corresponding coefficients are 𝛽 S A = + 1 . 14 and 𝛽 S B = 0 . 00 . Thus the effect on the odds due to non - seller effects alone is Exp ( 𝛽 S A − 𝛽 S B ) = 3 . 12 ( see Equation ( 8 ) ) . Notice , in contrast , had we changed the profiles from F B to 𝐶 in M 𝐻 , we would see a decrease in odds by a small factor of 0 . 97 . 723 FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Karan , Balepur , Sundaram C F A F B M A M B S A S B Y A Y B Third Party 17 First Party 4 First Party 1 Third Party 9 Third Party 13 Third Party 5 Third Party 22 Third Party 1 0 . 00 0 . 01 - 0 . 01 0 . 02 - 0 . 00 0 . 01 - 0 . 01 - 0 . 00 0 . 02 - 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 01 0 . 04 0 . 01 - 0 . 06 - 0 . 00 0 . 01 - 0 . 42 - 0 . 04 - 0 . 03 0 . 88 0 . 32 0 . 07 - 0 . 67 - 0 . 00 - 0 . 07 - 0 . 49 0 . 03 - 0 . 19 0 . 90 0 . 23 0 . 22 - 0 . 71 - 0 . 00 0 . 01 - 1 . 59 1 . 12 - 0 . 50 2 . 36 0 . 63 1 . 85 - 0 . 60 0 . 29 1 . 26 1 . 19 - 0 . 95 1 . 19 - 0 . 33 0 . 69 - 2 . 92 - 0 . 68 - 0 . 42 - 0 . 82 - 1 . 96 0 . 76 - 0 . 86 2 . 05 0 . 23 1 . 42 - 1 . 00 - 0 . 42 0 . 90 - 1 . 59 1 . 39 - 0 . 48 2 . 55 0 . 68 1 . 89 - 0 . 55 - 0 . 54 1 . 45 ( a ) : Flights , M 𝐹 C F A F B M A M B S A S B Y A Y B First Party 1356 First Party 1301 First Party 1338 First Party 1396 Third Party 1016 First Party 1092 First Party 1255 Third Party 1015 - 0 . 00 0 . 00 - 0 . 01 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 0 . 00 - 0 . 01 - 0 . 00 0 . 00 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 01 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 01 - 0 . 00 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 - 0 . 01 - 0 . 01 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 0 . 01 - 0 . 01 - 0 . 00 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 01 - 0 . 00 0 . 00 1 . 89 - 0 . 38 0 . 36 0 . 23 - 0 . 06 - 0 . 72 0 . 34 - 0 . 02 1 . 04 0 . 08 - 0 . 89 - 0 . 83 - 0 . 57 0 . 91 - 0 . 14 - 0 . 49 0 . 56 1 . 33 0 . 59 - 1 . 58 - 0 . 46 - 0 . 16 0 . 23 - 0 . 66 0 . 75 - 0 . 03 1 . 23 1 . 57 - 0 . 39 0 . 46 0 . 16 - 1 . 72 - 0 . 86 0 . 29 - 0 . 19 0 . 92 ( b ) : Hotels , M 𝐻 Figure 4 : Seller effects : We show the interaction variable 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 , for a subset of high and low variance sellers on the logit scale for both M 𝐹 and M 𝐻 . We see that some sellers have high variation ( Third Party 1 ) while others have very low ( First Party 1356 ) . From this we can see that certain sellers can have nearly opposing strategies : Third Party 1 vs . Third Party 5 in M 𝐹 and Third Party 1015 vs . First Party 1092 in M 𝐻 . In M 𝐹 we see that control often does better ( but not always ) while in M 𝐻 we see the reverse . These results demonstrate that some sellers do engage in differ - ential pricing on the basis of profile . To understand the full scope , we also need to examine the dollar impact . Table 1 : The mean values of the 𝛽 𝑖 coefficients in both mar - kets where 𝐶 is the control profile . The values are in the Logit scale where ± 1 changes in 𝛽 cause the odds to change by a factor 𝑒 and 𝑒 − 1 respectively ( see Equation ( 8 ) ) .

We use a zero - inflated Gaussian to model price difference 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) − 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) for profiles 𝑎 𝑖 , 𝑎 𝑗 . The data is zero - inflated because profile pairs may see an identical price from the same seller for the same object . Despite possible equal treatment among profiles , they may see a significant price difference with the control profile . In the raw data we observe that in M 𝐹 , 25 sellers ( out of 34 ) engage in differential pricing ; in M 𝐻 we see this from 134 sellers ( out of 427 ) . We show the results in Figure 5 , on dollar scale ( full results in Appendix B ) . The black reference lines are at $ 0 . 44 for flights and $ 0 . 09 for hotels ; they represent the average price difference between any pair of profiles , occurring by chance . The effects on price vary by seller . We see for the flight sellers , none of the HDPI overlap with the reference value . Differences between profiles can also be significant . Third Party 1 offers S A prices that result in losses from $ 4 . 07 to $ 8 . 30 ( with maximum density at $ 6 . 19 ) compared to the control . F B loses between $ 0 . 84 and $ 2 . 08 ( with maximum density at $ 1 . 41 ) compared to the control . First Party 1 offers S A prices that result in losses from from $ 2 . 40 to $ 5 . 34 ( with maximum density at $ 3 . 68 ) , and F B prices that results in losses from $ 0 . 46 to $ 1 . 37 ( with maximum density at $ 0 . 83 ) . These results suggest the expected loss is significant across a subset of profiles and sellers . For hotels , our reference profile is M B . We see that Third Party 1015 offers the control profile prices that results in losses from $ 2 . 45 to $ 3 . 28 ( with maximum density at $ 2 . 82 ) , while offering M A prices that results in losses from - $ 0 . 48 to - $ 0 . 12 ( with maximum density at - $ 0 . 29 ) ; this is a better price than M B ; or a gain . Together these results show that the dollar price losses are significant . Across millions of flights sold , this results in a substantial loss to consumers . 8 DISCUSSION Differentiation or Discrimination ? : Our results show differ - ential pricing by sellers for distinct behavioral profiles , but is the outcome discriminatory ? In the US , discrimination based on pro - tected classes is split into two categories : intentional discrimination ( Section VI ) and disparate impact ( Section VII ) [ 43 ] . To prove inten - tional discrimination , one must show that the seller intentionally co - varied prices based on protected attributes . To make this claim , the experimenter must be confident that they and the seller are in consensus regarding buyer attributes . In our framework however , the experimenter and seller can conservatively agree only that the behaviors are distinct . To prove disparate impact , one must show that one group received worse prices in expectation due to the seller’s pricing mechanism . For example , while S A and S B were intended to represent senior profiles in prior work , the website lists are not associated with any real senior individuals . If we had such real data , we could make a claim about seniors . Indeed we see that these two profiles experience quite different treatment ( Figures 3 , 4 , 5 ) from sellers . To make a claim about systemic disparate im - pact , one would need to examine how actual individuals with real browsing histories are affected as a class by a pricing mechanism . Hence , in behavior - based audits , the auditor cannot conclude what 724 Your Browsing History May Cost You FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA 0 . 00 1 . 00 2 . 00 3 . 00 4 . 00 5 . 00 6 . 00 7 . 00 8 . 00 9 . 00 Dollars D e n s i t y ( a ) : Third Party 1 0 . 00 1 . 00 2 . 00 3 . 00 4 . 00 5 . 00 6 . 00 7 . 00 8 . 00 9 . 00 Dollars D e n s i t y ( b ) : First Party 1 0 . 00 1 . 00 2 . 00 3 . 00 4 . 00 5 . 00 6 . 00 7 . 00 8 . 00 9 . 00 Dollars D e n s i t y F A F B M A M B S A S B Y A Y B Ref Value ( 0 . 44 ) ( c ) : First Party 2 - 0 . 50 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 1 . 50 2 . 00 2 . 50 3 . 00 3 . 50 Dollars D e n s i t y ( d ) : Third Party 1015 - 0 . 50 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 1 . 50 2 . 00 2 . 50 3 . 00 3 . 50 Dollars D e n s i t y ( e ) : Third Party 1016 - 0 . 50 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 1 . 50 2 . 00 2 . 50 3 . 00 3 . 50 Dollars D e n s i t y F A F B M A S A S B Y A Y B C Ref Value ( 0 . 09 ) ( f ) : First Party 1002 Figure 5 : Expected Loss : Density plots of dollar differences . The top row shows a comparison with the control profile in the flight market and the bottom row shows a comparison with M B in the hotel market . The reference value is the average price difference occurring by chance between any pair of profiles — $ 0 . 44 for flights and $ 0 . 09 for hotels . The plots show 89 % HPDI regions ; non - overlapping regions imply significant differences in effects . In particular , in ( a ) none of the HDPI regions overlap with the reference , and many do not overlap with each other — these differences are significant ( not by chance ) . In contrast we see in ( d ) that some profiles do better than the reference ( M A , S A ) , while others do worse ( control , F B , S B ) . the seller infers from the behavior , precluding a stronger claim of intentional discrimination or disparate impact . Comparing Markets : We observed varying levels of differential pricing in the two audited markets . Comparing the top and bottom rows in Figure 3 gives a qualitative difference between the markets . Most notably in M 𝐹 , the control profile is on average the best per - forming while in M 𝐻 , M B often does well . We also see in Table 1 the coefficients for M 𝐻 vary less . In Figure 4 , sellers that employ differential pricing to the highest degree in M 𝐻 still do so less than those that do the same in M 𝐹 . In addition , the dollar impact in more extreme cases ( Figure 5 ) is higher for flights compared to hotels . We attribute this to the general volatility of flight prices , from both short term pricing strategies [ 24 , 55 ] as well as long term trends [ 45 , 46 ] . These volatile conditions could potentially allow sellers to more easily employ differential pricing while remaining undetected by consumers — the method shown here can help de - tect this differential pricing even in high volatility scenarios , with enough data . Analysis of the results from our causal model suggests a combination of seller - dependent and seller - independent effects driving this difference between markets . Seller Behavior : Examining Figure 4 , it is clear that different sellers employ different pricing strategies to maximize profits . For example , Third Party 5 has almost an opposite strategy to Third Party 1 , charging each profile more or less than the control respec - tively . These sellers may be making different inferences from the same behavior of our profiles , or their profit maximization could differ based on the type of business they want to attract . Before conducting these audits , we hypothesized that the control profile ( with no browsing history ) would see the best price , as the seller wouldn’t have information with which to inform a price increase . In fact , a seller in the flight market may consider the control profile an unsophisticated or inexperienced consumer , unlikely to purchase a ticket or any add - ons ( trip insurance , checked luggage , etc . ) , and thus not worth targeting . We see that generally , our hypothesis was correct for M 𝐹 , with some exceptions ( see Third Party 5 ) . How - ever we did not correctly predict the results for M 𝐻 . One possible explanation is that price personalization may not always be in the positive direction . Individual hotels may differentiate themselves by catering to ( offering lower prices to ) different demographic groups . Further investigation is needed to test this hypothesis . Designing Markets for Price Transparency : Our results demon - strate that consumers cannot be certain whether they are getting the best price when shopping in opaque markets . Sellers may take advantage of the absence of price transparency in online markets and use behavior - based differential pricing to maximize profits . Users can feel that the system is unfair [ 56 , 63 ] as a result of this differential pricing . In considering how to address this issue , we note that in most online markets , consumers are effectively “shopping alone” — the prices are highly personalized and users don’t have a clear idea of what others are seeing . Price discrimination has been heavily studied , as businesses want to maximize profits by charging as much 725 FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Karan , Balepur , Sundaram as possible . There are some instances where this can be beneficial — by utilizing auctions , sellers can elicit buyers’ true valuations for goods and maximize welfare and profits . However , auctions are only feasible when supply is low and resources are constrained . In our current systems , the seller is making a guess about the consumer’s willingness to pay based on some behavior which could ( knowingly or unknowingly ) be correlated with protected attributes . This is in contrast to auctions which try to more explicitly gauge the consumer’s true willingness to pay . One way to mitigate the impact of differential pricing is increas - ing market transparency ; this has been shown to improve pricing in some markets [ 30 ] . In stock exchanges , the last settlement price is publicly available nearly instantaneously , and in certain markets the price is required by law to be provided . This transparency would give an inexperienced consumer some baseline of typical prices in the market . Unfortunately , a change like this may require law to take effect . Another way to make the opaque shopping experience more ‘public’ is by encouraging users to share information , or shop together . Users could also be invited to help shape pricing deci - sions ; Li et al . [ 36 ] found that including consumers in the pricing design framework reduced perceptions of unfairness . Much of the behavior - based profiling we have observed in these audits relies heavily on the ad - tracking ecosystem to give sellers information about their consumers . Banning or disallowing third parties from tracking users or providing this information to sellers could poten - tially mitigate some of this personalized pricing – though given the centrality of advertising to the online world , this is currently an infeasible goal . More transparent structures overall will help consumers feel more confident that they’re receiving a fair price . 9 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK Other Differential Pricing Techniques : We conducted an audit on an online market with a single seller ; this highlighted that sellers may implement differential pricing strategies that we do not model explicitly . We performed this audit on Macy’s ( macys . com ) because of its variety of items and ease of querying . We found minimal differences in price across profiles . We confirmed that this is not due to lack of tracking — macys . com employs 50 distinct track - ers . This , however , does not preclude Macy’s from any differential pricing techniques . Macy’s could implement personalized pricing more frequently when users are logged in , sending personalized coupons to consumers [ 41 ] . In addition , Macy’s may utilize IP - based ( location - based ) differential pricing , something known to happen in general with e - commerce [ 26 ] , but we held location constant across profiles . Finally , our experimental design may not detect differential pricing that appears due to sellers segmenting the market based on user attributes . For example , a seller may know that the men’s clothing section is often visited by men . If the seller has identified this group as willing to pay a high price , then they may raise the price of all goods in the men’s section compared to the women’s section , regardless of who buys them . Our framework would not detect this differential pricing because we only compare equivalent goods shown to different profiles . Future work can keep these types of differential pricing strategies in mind when designing auditing frameworks . Data : For our flight audit we only collected the first page of results ; the market orders the objects by convenience . Later results show “less convenient” tickets which may include higher prices . For the same reason , we only looked at the first 5 hotel results for each of the “star” options . In our analysis , we assume stationary seller strategies over the collection period . This limitation could be mitigated by including time in the model , though this would complicate analysis . Profiles : Constructing profiles that show an even greater difference in price is an open research question . The effect of profile size ( i . e . , the number of websites in the profile ) on the price difference is also unclear . We expect a diminishing effect of size , and we leave that for future work . Here we consider profiles defined by online behavior without being logged in to any accounts ; the effect of account log - in on differential pricing is a topic for future work . 10 CONCLUSIONS We presented a framework to audit non - transparent online mar - kets for differential pricing by sellers using automated agents and assuming ignorance of sellers’ pricing mechanisms . The notion of experimenter - seller consensus , that sellers agree on the agents’ attributes set by the experimenter , is central to our framework . We conservatively implemented consensus via agent behavior , since consensus on demographics is infeasible . We audited two large online markets and showed significant causal differential pricing effects ; the degree to which they occur varied with the seller . In M 𝐹 , the control ( i . e . , incognito ) profile is almost always offered the best price — sometimes profiles are 90 % more likely to see a worse price . In M 𝐻 , M B performs the best , where some profiles are 60 % more likely to see a worse price . The price difference between two profiles can be as high as $ 6 . 00 in M 𝐹 ( i . e . , 15 × the price difference by chance , $ 0 . 44 ) , and $ 3 . 00 for M 𝐻 ( i . e . , 33 × the price difference by chance , $ 0 . 09 ) . This framework is readily extendable to other online markets and can allow for more nuanced analysis , including quantifying how sellers behave across different markets . These re - sults demonstrate the need for more transparent pricing to inform consumers of pricing practices and mitigate unfair outcomes .

We chose to only show select sellers to save space , but displayed the 89 % HDI regions for each profile . Here we give the mean value 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑐 | 𝑘 for all profiles 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 and all sellers 𝑘 ∈ 𝑆 for M 𝐹 . This is the probability of profile 𝑎 𝑖 seeing a worse price than the control profile 𝐶 ( Table 2a ) . We are unable to show the full table for M 𝐻 in this appendix because of the large number of sellers we observed in this market , however we do present an extended table ( Table 2b ) compared to the one in the main paper . We present the mean value 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 for all profiles 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 where 𝑎 𝑗 = M B . In both markets , sellers’ pricing behavior can vary dramatically — in M 𝐹 , Third Party 5 shows very low probabilities across profiles ( ranging from 1 % – 11 % ) while others like Third Party 18 show a larger range ( 18 % – 80 % ) . In M 𝐻 the range of behaviors still exist but the effect is more muted - Third Party 1010 ranges from ( 6 % – 29 % ) while most others are similar to the base probability ( e . g . , First party 1356 , First Party 1361 ) . Though the original authors of our profiles assign demographic identities to these profiles , equivalent identities from each profile set do not experience similar effects . In particular , in both M 𝐹 and M 𝐻 , F A often experiences a very high probability of seeing a worse price while for the same sellers , F B experiences a lower probability of seeing a worse price . In Section 7 . 1 we also asked how much of the differential treat - ment between profile 𝑎 𝑖 and the control 𝐶 is due to the seller , profile interaction alone . We answer this question by examining the in - teraction effect 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 for all sellers 𝑘 and profiles 𝑎 𝑖 . We showed a truncated version of the figure in the main body , and show the full version for M 𝐹 in Figure 7a and expanded version for M 𝐻 in Figure 7b . Keep in mind that this result must be combined with the seller - independent effect to understand the overall effect of differential treatment . However , even with these general trends for 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 , the seller specific trends can vary quite a bit — Third Party 7 and Third Party 14 have almost opposite strategies ( that is , a given profile will experience a positive coefficient for one seller and a negative for another ) . 1 − 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 − 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 = 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 ≠ 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 Figure 6 : The input to this model is a dataset where each row is a price comparison ( in dollars ) between profile 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑗 , conditioned on a good 𝑔 and seller 𝑘 , 𝑌 𝑖 | 𝑘 − 𝑌 𝑗 | 𝑘 . With probability 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 , profiles 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑗 see different prices . With probability 1 − 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 , they see the same price . 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 is the output from our original model ( see Equation ( 2 ) ) . B PRICE DIFFERENCE MODEL AND RESULTS ( RQ2 ) First we depict the mixture model we described in the main body , which has the aggregate effect of a zero - inflated Gaussian . We model the outcome 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 with a normal distribution with parameters 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 and 𝜎 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ( Equation ( 9 ) ) . 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 gives the mean price difference ( in dollars ) between profiles 𝑎 𝑖 , 𝑎 𝑗 conditioned on the same seller 𝑘 ( Equation ( 10 ) ) . 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 is also conditioned on the good 𝑔 ; we’ve avoided conditioning on 𝑔 in the equations for clarity . On the right - hand side of Equation ( 10 ) , ¯ 𝑝 is the base dollar difference between tickets seen by profiles 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑗 . We can model the effect of the profile 𝑎 𝑖 through the unobserved confound 𝑈 1 with a parameter 𝛽 𝑖 . Thus these parameters affect the dollar difference through the difference in their direct effects , ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 𝑗 ) . We capture the seller - profile interaction effect through the parameter 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 . Thus , we introduce 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 − 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑗 , the difference of the interaction effects to understand their effect on the price difference . Equation ( 12 ) shows our multi - level modeling for the direct effects ( 𝛽 ) . We draw the 𝛽 𝑖 from a common prior N ( ¯ 𝛽 , 𝛽 𝜎 ) allowing for pooling , thus regularizing our estimates for 𝛽 𝑖 . We use weakly informative priors for both ¯ 𝛽 and 𝛽 𝜎 , as well as 𝛿 𝑖 , 𝑘 ( seller profile interaction shown in Equation ( 15 ) ) . Notice that we set the mean of the prior for both ¯ 𝛽 and 𝛿 𝑖 , 𝑘 to be 0 , because a priori , we do not expect either a direct effect of the profile or an effect of the interaction between seller and profile . Finally , Equation ( 16 ) shows the prior for ¯ 𝑝 , which gives the base dollar difference . We set the mean value to $ 5 because we know that the average price difference between profiles ( when it exists ) is approximately $ 5 . We set the standard deviation to $ 30 because we also know that the difference can vary substantially . 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ∼ N ( 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 , 𝜎 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ) ( 9 ) 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 = ¯ 𝑝 + ( 𝛽 𝑖 − 𝛽 𝑗 ) + ( 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 − 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑗 ) ( 10 ) 𝜎 𝑖 , 𝑗 | 𝑘 ∼ N ( 0 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) ( 11 ) 𝛽 𝑖 ∼ N ( ¯ 𝛽 , 𝛽 𝜎 ) ( 12 ) ¯ 𝛽 ∼ N ( 0 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) ( 13 ) 𝛽 𝜎 ∼ Exp ( 1 . 0 ) ( 14 ) 𝛿 𝑘 , 𝑖 ∼ N ( 0 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) ( 15 ) ¯ 𝑝 ∼ N ( 5 . 0 , 30 . 0 ) ( 16 ) B . 1 Results In the main body of the paper , we show the expected loss of each profile compared to the best performing profile for select sellers . We obtain these values by multiplying the expected loss conditioned on the existence of a price difference by the probability of a price difference , as depicted in Figure 6 . Here we show the plots for the expected loss conditioned on the existence of a price difference ( Figure 8 ) , which is the output of the model above . We show the same selected sellers for M 𝐹 and M 𝐻 as presented in the paper . We note that the range of the conditional loss can be quite high . In Figure 8c for First Party 2 , the loss compared to the control ranges from $ 5 . 50 to $ 16 . 00 , while for Third Party 1015 in Figure 8e the loss compared to M B ranges from - $ 2 . 00 to $ 8 . 00 . 729 FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Karan , Balepur , Sundaram We also show the mean price difference over all goods 𝑔 , E ( 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) − 𝜌 ( 𝑔 𝑗 ) ) , where 𝑔 𝑖 ≡ 𝑔 𝑗 for all sellers 𝑘 ∈ 𝑆 and pro - files 𝑎 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 in M 𝐹 ( Table 3a ) . We show a condensed version of M 𝐻 for space ( Table 3b ) . This is the mean loss ( in dollars ) 𝑎 𝑖 incurs when compared to the control profile 𝐶 and M 𝐵 respectively , and are calculated as described in Figure 6 . The range of impacts are noteworthy . In M 𝐹 , Third Party 5 has fairly low and consistent dollar losses while First Party 7 has quite disparate losses ( rang - ing from $ 1 . 17 to $ 8 . 76 ) . Profiles meant to represent equivalent identities from each profile set do not experience similar effects . In particular , M A often experiences a higher expected loss per seller , relative to M B . Also notably , in M 𝐻 we generally see lower impacts across sellers and profiles . For example , the loss caused by Third Party 1015 varies from - $ 0 . 30 to $ 2 . 86 while that caused by First Party 1230 ranges from $ 0 . 04 to $ 0 . 11 . C DATA DETAILS In this section we give additional details about the data we collected from kayak . com . Each record we collected from M 𝐹 contains the following in - formation : the departure and arrival information ( time , airport , carrier , and the number of stops ) , the seller of the ticket , and the price . Each record we collected from M 𝐻 contains the following information : the departure and arrival dates , the city , hotel , seller , room configuration , any amenities , and the price . Notably , in both cases , the seller of the ticket may not be the flight carrier or hotel owner , as aggregators can sell seats for other airlines or rooms in other hotels . We distinguish between first party sellers ( those who sell tickets on their own branded planes or rooms in their own branded hotels ) and third party sellers ( aggregators or other ticketing services that do not operate any actual flights or own any hotels ) . To anonymize our data , we do not list specific cities , routes or sellers . Instead , we characterize sellers as first or third party , cities as large , medium , or small , and airports as large hub , medium hub , small hub , or non - hub . Thus the route types are every combination of airport types , except non - hub - non - hub , because we did not query such routes . See Figure 9 for descriptive statistics of both flight data ( 9a ) and hotel data ( 9b ) . Now we give a few details regarding the implementation of the data collection algorithm — for every query 𝑞 ∈ 𝑄 ( Algorithm 1 , line 1 ) , we train agents 𝑖 ∈ N ( lines 1 – 1 ) using Selenium ( with Fire - fox ) by visiting websites 𝑤 𝑖 ∈ 𝑊 , thus creating each agent’s profile 𝑎 𝑖 . Each agent is trained in parallel on a machine with enough cores such that each process can execute on individual cores . No shared memory is used . Once all agents are trained , all processes are started simultaneously . The queries themselves may not execute exactly at the same time ( due to process scheduling , etc . ) , but the ultimate order is randomized since any delay - causing factors are independent of the market conditions and agent identity , and thus do not affect our results . To ensure consistency ( location and time each day ) in queries , we run each batch of queries on a university Linux cluster . 730 Your Browsing History May Cost You FAccT ’23 , June 12 – 15 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Table 2 : Differential Treatment : Mean value of 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑐 | 𝑘 for all sellers 𝑘 and profiles 𝑎 𝑖 when compared to the reference profile .
