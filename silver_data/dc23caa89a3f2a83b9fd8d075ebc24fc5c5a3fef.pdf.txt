We develop deformable particle ( DP ) model simulations to understand how variations in cell mechanics give rise to distinct wound closure phenotypes in the Drosophila embryonic ectoderm and larval wing disc epithelium . We ﬁnd that plastic deformation of the cell membrane can generate large changes in cell shape consistent with wound closure in the embryonic ectoderm . Our results show that the embryonic ectoderm is best described by cell membranes with an elasto - plastic response , whereas the larval wing disc is best described by cell membranes with an exclusively elastic response . By varying the mechanical response of cell membranes in DP simulations , we recapitulate the wound closure behavior of both the embryonic ectoderm and the larval wing disc . In response to wounding , epithelia carry out com - plex chemical and physical processes to restore tissue in - tegrity . Epithelial wound healing has been studied in numerous species , including Drosophila , zebraﬁsh , and humans [ 1 – 7 ] . Even within a single species , the healing process varies with developmental stage [ 3 , 8 ] . In later stages , wound healing is slower , requires smaller changes in cell shape , and causes more scarring , which have been attributed to diﬀerences in chemical signaling , such as heightened inﬂammatory response [ 8 – 10 ] . However , physical mechanisms , such as force transmission through cell junctions and collective cell motion , have also been shown to inﬂuence wound healing [ 11 – 13 ] . An important driving force for wound closure across many developmen - tal stages and species is the actomyosin purse - string that forms around the wound [ 1 , 2 , 8 , 12 , 14 ] . Cell shape changes [ 15 – 17 ] are another physical mechanism that can aﬀect the dynamics of wound healing in epithelial tissues . An important open question is determining how these physical mechanisms inﬂuence wound closure in diﬀerent developmental stages . Previous computational models of wound closure have investigated contributions from substrate mechanical properties , active driving forces , and tissue tension [ 3 , 12 , 18 , 19 ] . These models assume that cell membranes only respond elastically to deformation , ignoring viscoelastic and plastic response [ 20 – 22 ] . However , recent experimen - tal studies have shown that irreversible cell shape changes [ 23 – 26 ] are necessary for cell stress relaxation and tissue remodeling . Neglecting cell membrane plasticity can give rise to unrealistically large stresses when signiﬁcant cell shape changes are required for wound closure . It is there - fore important to understand the role of viscoelastic and plastic response of cell membranes during wound closure . In vivo studies of wound closure in late - stage Drosophila embryonic ectoderm and late third - instar Drosophila larval wing disc epithelium have found that cells near healed embryo wounds are elongated relative to those near healed wing disc wounds [ 3 ] . ( See Fig . 1c , d . ) Embryo wounds close at a rate of ≈ 6 . 2 µ m 2 / minute with cell shape changes of more than 30 % near the wound , whereas wing disc wounds close at a rate of ≈ 0 . 7 µ m 2 / minute with cell shape changes of less than 10 % near the wound . ( See Fig . 1a , b . ) We propose that epithelial cells in wounded embryos more rapidly remodel their membranes to sustain greater cell shape changes compared to those in wounded wing discs , allowing em - bryo cells to close wounds more quickly . We carry out deformable particle ( DP ) model sim - ulations to explore the relation between cell mechani - cal properties and wound closure phenotypes . We com - pare the simulation results to measurements of cell shape changes and wound closure rates from wounding exper - iments in embryonic and larval wing disc epithelia [ 3 ] . Our simulation results suggest that cell membrane plas - ticity is essential to achieve cell shape changes observed during embryo wound closure . Moreover , plasticity al - lows faster wound closure rates in embryos compared to those in wing discs . Since epithelial wound healing primarily involves in - plane motion , we consider a two - dimensional deformable particle model for wound closure , where the shape energy [ 27 ] for each cell i is U shape , i = k a 2 ( a i − a 0 ) 2 + k l 2 N v X α = 1 ( l αi − l 0 αi ) 2 + U b , i .

We include a moving average of the data in ( b ) with a 20 - minute window size ( solid lines ) . The data for A ( t ) / A ( 0 ) and A ( t ) are from 5 wing disc wounds and 2 em - bryo wounds from Ref . [ 3 ] . Example cell outlines reproduced from Ref . [ 3 ] are shown during wound closure for a single ( c ) wing disc and ( d ) embryo , with the wound shaded in gray . The scale bars are 3 µm in ( c ) and 5 µm in ( d ) . beled by α ) , membrane bond vectors ~ l αi = ~ r αi − ~ r ( α − 1 ) i , vertex positions ~ r αi = ( x αi , y αi ) , equilibrium area a 0 , and equilibrium intervertex membrane length l 0 αi . The area stiﬀness spring constant k a and membrane length spring constant k l penalize deviations of the cell area a i from a 0 and membrane length l αi from l 0 αi . ( See Fig . 2a . ) We quantify cell shape using the shape parameter A i = p 2 i / 4 πa , where p i is the perimeter of cell i and A i ≥ 1 . The bending energy U b , i = k b 2 N v X α = 1 θ 2 αi ( 2 ) determines the energy cost of membrane curvature for cell i , where k b is the membrane bending rigidity and θ αi is the angle between ~ l αi and ~ l ( α − 1 ) i . The cells interact through the pair potential U int , which is a function of the distances between each ver - tex and nearby membrane segments on neighboring cells . U int includes soft - core repulsion and short - range attrac - tion with a variable well depth . We calculate the distance d αi , βj = ( 3 ) | ( x ( β − 1 ) j − x βj ) ( y βj − y αi ) − ( x βj − x αi ) ( y ( β − 1 ) j − y βj ) | | ~ r βj − ~ r ( β − 1 ) j | ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) PS vertex DP vertex PS spring PS - wound bond plastic elastic UnperturbedCell Compressed Cell Decompressed Cells FIG . 2 .

( b ) The distance vector ~ d αi , βj between ver - tex α on cell i and membrane segment ~ l βj on cell j has no component along ~ l βj . ( c ) A cell with A = 1 is uniaxially com - pressed . An elastic cell returns to its undeformed shape ( left ) after the strain is removed , whereas a plastic cell is perma - nently deformed ( right ) . ( d ) A simulated wound is initialized as a cell monolayer , followed by removal of central cells such that the wound size is similar to those in Ref . [ 3 ] . Inset : Close - up of the purse string ( PS ) , modeled as a collection of vertices ( blue ) along the edge of the wound ( red ) . PS vertices are connected by springs ( blue lines ) with rest lengths λ 0 , and each PS vertex is bonded to one DP vertex ( yellow lines ) . between each vertex α on cell i and membrane segment ~ l βj on cell j as shown in Fig . 2b . Having intercellular interactions that are only a function of d αi , βj results in frictionless sliding adhesion by eliminating components of the force on vertex α on cell i from interactions with cell j that are parallel to ~ l βj . ( See the deﬁnition of U int in Eq . S1 , and the simulation parameters in Table S1 in Supplemental Material ( SM ) [ 28 ] . ) The total energy U DP of a monolayer of N cells is U DP = N X i = 1 U shape , i + N X i > j N v X α > β U int ( d αi , βj ) . ( 4 ) We use a viscoelastic description of the cell membrane where the membrane segments are springs that remodel 3 their rest lengths in response to stress ( Eq . 5 ) , simi - lar in approach to models of irreversible deformation of the cytoskeleton and cell junctions [ 24 , 26 , 29 ] . Rest - length remodeling describes membrane stress relaxation processes , such as unfolding and traﬃcking [ 26 , 30 ] . We assume that the membrane segment rest length l 0 αi obeys md 2 l 0 αi dt 2 = − k l ( l 0 αi − l αi ) − η dl 0 αi dt , ( 5 ) with vertex mass m and damping coeﬃcient η . The plastic relaxation timescale τ = η / k l controls the mem - brane remodeling rate . In Fig . 2c , we show a compres - sion test of duration T on a single cell with an elastic ( τ / T ≫ 1 ) and plastic membrane ( τ / T ≪ 1 ) . Cells with elastic membranes recover their undeformed shape , whereas cells with plastic membranes do not . By vary - ing τ , we describe cells with diﬀerent degrees of elasto - plasticity . Wounds are simulated by ﬁrst generating a nearly con - ﬂuent cell monolayer with A = 1 . 2 , similar to A of em - bryo and larval wing disc cells . We then remove the cen - tral cells from the monolayer , resulting in wounds similar in size to those in laser ablation experiments on epithe - lial monolayers [ 3 ] . In the simulations , we focus on the purse - string ( PS ) mechanism for wound closure . While embryonic wound healing features both PS and protru - sive crawling activity [ 2 , 3 ] , our simulations with only PS activity can predict the diﬀerences in embryonic and larval wing disc wound closure . We deﬁne the PS as a collection of N p vertices along the wound boundary as shown in Fig . 2d . Each PS vertex at position ~ r p ( t ) is initially coincident with a wound - adjacent DP vertex at ~ r d ( t ) , such that ~ r p ( 0 ) = ~ r d ( 0 ) . The two vertices are bonded by a spring with stiﬀness k p , length l = | ~ r p − ~ r d | , and yield length l y . For each PS vertex , the interaction energy is U PS = k p 2 (cid:20) min (cid:18) l , l y 2 (cid:19)(cid:21) 2 Θ ( l y − l ) , ( 6 ) where Θ ( · ) is the Heaviside step function , and U PS satu - rates when l ≥ l y / 2 and vanishes when l > l y . Including l y ensures that PS vertices only interact with membrane segments near the wound . The PS contracts linearly in time t with constriction rate ω . Adjacent PS vertices are connected by springs with stiﬀness k ps = k l and rest length λ 0 ( t ) = λ 0 ( 0 ) − ω N p , ( 7 ) which causes the PS to constrict over time . λ 0 ( 0 ) is cho - sen for each PS segment such that there is no initial ten - sion , i . e . λ 0 ( 0 ) = l αi . To compare the wound closure simulation results with those from experiments , we analyze confocal microscopy images of wound closure in embryo and wing disc epithe - lia from Ref . [ 3 ] .

S3 and S4 in SM [ 28 ] . ) We 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 Bulk modulus B ( kPa ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 P l a s t i c t i m e sc a l e ( m i n ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 / m i n ) 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 Bulk modulus B ( kPa ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 P l a s t i c t i m e sc a l e ( m i n ) 1 . 4 1 . 5 1 . 6 1 . 7 ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 3 . ( a ) Cell shape parameter A in the healed system plotted versus the cell bulk modulus B and plastic relaxation timescale τ . ( b ) Closure rate dA / dt plotted using the data in ( a ) . Parameters indicated by the squares represent predic - tions for B and τ of embryo ( red ) and wing disc ( black ) cells . dA / dt is deﬁned as 95 % of the maximum wound area divided by the time it takes for the wound to shrink to 5 % of its max - imum size . Averaging at a given τ and β is performed over 25 simulations with diﬀerent initial conditions . Simulations are carried out at B and τ given by the grid points , and contours are obtained via interpolation between grid points . convert simulation units to physical units using estimates of the adhesive force between two cells f adh ( ≈ 1 nN ) [ 31 ] , cell area ( a 0 ≈ 25 µ m 2 for embryo ectoderm and a 0 ≈ 16 µ m 2 for wing disc epithelium ) , and PS con - striction rate ( ω ≈ 0 . 3 µ m / s ) [ 32 , 33 ] . For example , the plastic relaxation time τ and cell bulk modulus B can be expressed in physical units as τ = τ ∗ √ a 0 / ω ( 8 ) B = k ∗ a f adh a 0 . ( 9 ) 4 By varying τ and using realistic values of B , the wound closure simulations can recapitulate cell shape changes near the wound ∆ A = A − A ( 0 ) ( where A ( 0 ) ≈ 1 . 2 ) and closure rates dA / dt that mimic those for embryo and wing disc wound closure . In Fig . 3 , we show A of cells in the healed tissue that were adjacent to the wound boundary and dA / dt as a function of B and τ . Increasing cell membrane plasticity ( i . e . decreasing τ ) signiﬁcantly increases dA / dt and ∆ A . Elastic - like cells only achieve comparable ∆ A to embryo cells when they are unrealisti - cally soft ( B ≤ 0 . 04 kPa ) , as experimental measurements of cell bulk moduli range from 0 . 3 to 2 kPa [ 34 – 36 ] . In a realistic range of B , elastic - like cells feature decreased dA / dt and smaller ∆ A , with ﬁnal shapes ranging from A = 1 . 35 to 1 . 5 ( Fig . 3b ) . Small B alone does not result in the order of magnitude diﬀerence in dA / dt between embryo and wing disc wounds , suggesting that plastic - ity is essential to achieve ∆ A and dA / dt found during embryo wound closure . In elastic - like cells ( i . e . τ > 85 min in Fig . 3 ) , in - creased B causes decreases in dA / dt and ∆ A . This trend reverses in plastic - like cells ( i . e . τ < 20 min in Fig . 3 ) . Increasing B dramatically decouples changes in membrane length from changes in area . Therefore , work done by U p strains membrane lengths signiﬁcantly more than cell areas , enhancing ∆ A when the membranes are plastic . We conﬁrm this result by demonstrating that stiﬀer , plastic cells are more deformable than softer or more elastic cells , in simulations of a cell experiencing an extensile force dipole . ( See Fig . S5 in SM [ 28 ] . ) We validate the DP model for wound closure by com - paring the results of simulations in Fig . 3 to time - series data for the wound area and cell shape parameter in Fig . 1a , b . The simulation parameters , except τ and B , are identical among diﬀerent simulations in Fig . 3 . We use softer and more plastic cells to model the embryo ( red square ) than the wing disc ( black square ) . This choice reﬂects the expectation that cell stiﬀness increases with greater degree of cell diﬀerentiation [ 23 , 37 ] , and the ob - servation that embryo cell shapes deform faster and more severely than wing disc cell shapes . We ﬁnd that our re - sults for the time dependence of the wound area are con - sistent with the experimental data for the embryo and wing disc ( Fig . 4a ) . A ( t ) in embryos matches the simu - lation results . In contrast , A ( t ) in wing discs ( Fig . 4b ) requires an additional shape memory term in the mem - brane remodeling equation , c . f . Eq . 5 , md 2 l 0 αi dt 2 = − k l ( l 0 αi − l αi − ξ ( l αi − l 0 αi ( 0 ) ) − η dl 0 αi dt , ( 10 ) where l 0 αi ( 0 ) is the segment length before wounding and ξ controls the timescale τ s = τ / ξ for cells to recover their original shape . We use ξ = 0 for the embryo and ξ = 0 . 1 for the wing disc , which leads to a better description of dA / dt and A ( t ) . This result suggests that more diﬀeren - ( c ) ( d ) Simulated Wing disc Simulated Embryo 0 min 0 min 44 min 229 min 57 min 31 min ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 4 .

( b ) A ( t ) averaged over cells adjacent to the wound for the simulations in ( a ) . Solid lines indicate the moving average of A ( t ) from experiments . Results from simulations using Eq . 10 are included in ( a ) and ( b ) to account for shape memory of wing disc cells ( black squares ) . Snapshots of these simulations are shown for ( c ) embryo and ( d ) wing disc parameters . tiated cells may have greater shape memory , perhaps to maintain their specialized functions . Snapshots at several time points in Fig . 4c - d show how wound closure trajectories vary with B and τ . Soft and plastic cells form multicellular rosettes , which are common in embryonic wound healing and developmental processes [ 1 , 3 , 38 ] . Elastic - like cells exhibit less elon - gation towards the wound and fewer cell contacts near the wound , which is attributed to increased intercala - tion , akin to the wing disc wound closure process [ 3 ] . The diﬀerence in elongation between elastic - and plastic - like cells during wound closure arises due to diﬀerences in cell stress relaxation , as plastic cells can relax by elongation whereas elastic cells must relax by changing neighbors . Deformable particle model simulations show that changes in cell stiﬀness and membrane plasticity lead to distinct wound closure phenotypes displayed in Drosophila embryo ectoderm and larval wing disc epithe - lium . By varying the cell bulk modulus B and plastic relaxation timescale τ , we ﬁnd regimes that correspond to fast closure with signiﬁcant cell shape changes , and slow closure with minor cell shape changes , which reca - pitulate the wound healing experiments on embryo and larval wing disc epithelia . We attribute the increased wound closure rates and greater cell shape changes to enhanced cell shape deformability , controlled by B and τ , in embryo cells relative to wing disc cells . Interestingly , increasing B leads to slower wound closure in elastic - like 5 cells , but faster closure in plastic - like cells . The correlation between rapid closure rate and dis - torted cell shapes during epithelial wound healing may suggest that earlier developmental stages prioritize fast healing at the expense of not maintaining the original tissue structure . Future work is necessary to determine whether cell shape plasticity is responsible for distinct patterns of tissue restructuring that occur during devel - opmental processes , such as gastrulation and neurulation [ 39 , 40 ] . In addition , although the current study investi - gates cell shape changes from membrane surface remodel - ing , we will also investigate the role of cell volume plastic - ity that occurs during wound healing and developmental processes .
