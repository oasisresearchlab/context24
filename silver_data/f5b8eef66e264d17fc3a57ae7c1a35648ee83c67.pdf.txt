Whether mycolactone diffuses from ulcerated lesions in clinically accessible samples and is modulated by antibiotic therapy remained to be established . Methodology / PrincipalFinding : Peripheral blood and ulcer exudates were sampled from patients at various stages of antibiotic therapy in Ghana and Ivory Coast . Total lipids were extracted from serum , white cell pellets and ulcer exudates with organic solvents . The presence of mycolactone in these extracts was then analyzed by a recently published , field - friendly method using thin layer chromatography and fluorescence detection . This approach did not allow us to detect mycolactone accurately , because of a high background due to co - extracted human lipids . We thus used a previously established approach based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . By this means , we could identify structurally intact mycolactone in ulcer exudates and serum of patients , and evaluate the impact of antibiotic treatment on the concentration of mycolactone . Conclusions / Significance : Our study provides the proof of concept that assays based on mycolactone detection in serum and ulcer exudates can form the basis of BU diagnostic tests . However , the identification of mycolactone required a technology that is not compatible with field conditions and point - of - care assays for mycolactone detection remain to be worked out . Notably , we found mycolactone in ulcer exudates harvested at the end of antibiotic therapy , suggesting that the toxin is eliminated by BU patients at a slow rate . Our results also indicated that mycolactone titres in the serum may reflect a positive response to antibiotics , a possibility that it will be interesting to examine further through longitudinal studies .

Introduction Buruli ulcer ( BU ) , caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , is the third most common mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy and represents an emerging threat [ 1 , 2 ] . Since the late 1980s , the disease has been developing throughout West and Central Africa , prompting the WHO in 1998 to initiate an awareness and control campaign ( http : / / www . who . int / gtb - buruli ) . Although efficient [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] , cur - rent treatment protocols recommend the daily administration of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin for 8 weeks , with additional surgical intervention when necessary . To control the emergence of BU and to improve the management of the disease , it is vital to develop new tools for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring . A distinctive feature of M . ulcerans among human pathogens is the production of mycolactone [ 8 ] , a macrocyclic polyketide playing a critical role in bacterial virulence ( reviewed in [ 9 , 10 ] ) . We have recently demonstrated the presence of intact mycolactone in punch biopsies from all forms of BU disease , before and during antibiotic therapy [ 11 ] . Moreover , there is evidence from mouse studies that mycolactone may diffuse into the peripheral blood www . plosntds . org 1 July 2011 | Volume 5 | Issue 7 | e1237 5 [ 12 ] . Here we used chemical approaches to determine if mycolactone is present in blood samples and ulcer exudates obtained non - invasively at various stages of antibiotic therapy . Methods Patient cohorts Patients were recruited if they met the WHO clinical case definition of BU disease ; were not pregnant ; had no history of tuberculosis , leprosy , or liver , kidney , or hearing impairment . All subjects provided written informed consent ( thumb print of parent or guardian in the case of children , depending on literacy ) . A cross - section of patients with BU disease were recruited which included a spectrum of patients yet to initiate antibiotic therapy , some at various stages of antibiotic treatment and few who had completed treatment . Healthy controls from the same endemic area were included . In Ghana , patients were recruited by local health workers from villages near Tepa Government Hospital in the Ahafo Ano North District of Ghana , where there is a high prevalence of BU . The study protocol was approved by the ethics review committees at the School of Medical Sciences , Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology , Kumasi , Ghana . In Ivory Coast , patients were either recruited from the Djekanou General Hospital or detected by a mobile medical team actively screening the district of Abidjan . The study protocol was approved by the national ethic review committee . Diagnosis and treatment To confirm the clinical diagnosis , punch biopsy specimens of 4 - mm diameter ( Ghana ) or ulcer exudates ( Ivory Coast ) were tested by PCR for the IS2404 repeat sequence , which is characteristic of M . ulcerans . Positive patients were treated with 10 mg / kg oral rifampicin and 15 mg / kg intramuscular streptomycin daily , administered at village health posts under direct observation , according to the WHO recommendations . Only IS2404 positive samples were considered for analysis of mycolactone presence . Mycolactone standard Mycolactone was extracted from M . ulcerans 1615 ( ATCC 35840 ) , as previously described [ 12 ] . In brief , bacteria were cultivated in Middlebrook 7H9 broth ( Difco ) enriched with 10 % oleic acid - albumin - dextrose - catalase ( OADC , Becton Dickinson ) for 4 weeks in spinner flasks at 30 u C . Total lipids were extracted from bacterial cell pellets with 2 / 1 CHCl 3 / MeOH ( v / v ) for 20 h at 4 u C . After separation from the aqueous phase following the addition of 20 % H 2 O ( w / v ) , the organic phase was dried . The resulting material was resuspended in ice - cold acetone and Author Summary Mycolactone is a diffusible cytotoxin produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans , the causative agent of the skin disease Buruli ulcer . In a previous study using animal models , we reported that mycolactone released by cutaneous foci of infection gains access to the peripheral blood . Here we investigated whether mycolactone circu - lates in human patients and is detectable in clinically accessible samples . Using a combination of solvent extraction , high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis , we found that structurally intact mycolactone was present in ulcer exudates obtained from wound swabs and in the serum of patients . Unexpectedly , high titres of mycolactone were detected in ulcer exudates after completion of antibiotic treatment . In contrast , mycolactone could only be detected in the serum of newly diagnosed patients . Our results demon - strate that mycolactone detection in serum and ulcer exudates may be used to diagnose BU . Moreover , they suggest that the kinetics of mycolactone concentration in serum may be indicative of the clinical response of patients to antibiotic therapy . Figure 1 . Comparison of the performances of the TLC - Fluo and HPLC approaches for mycolactone quantitative detection . A representative picture of the fluorescent signals and elution peaks obtained for mycolactone ( 10 – 500 ng ) detection by TLC - Fluo ( A ) and HPLC ( B ) are shown , with the corresponding standard curves ( C ) . Arbitrary units correspond to fluorescence intensity of the mycolactone band ( TLC - Fluo ) and area of the mycolactone elution peak ( HPLC ) .

The acetone - soluble fraction was then dried , resuspended in ethanol , and loaded onto a silica gel TLC plate and eluted with 90 / 9 / 1 CHCl 3 / MeOH / H 2 O as the mobile phase . The yellow band corresponding to mycolactone ( retention factor of 0 . 2 ) was then scraped and mycolactone eluted from silica particles using 2 / 1 CHCl 3 / MeOH ( v / v ) . Following solvent evaporation , purified mycolactone was resuspended in ethanol . The concentration of the resulting solution was determined by UV absorption , as described [ 13 ] . Mycolactone detection by coupling to 2 - naphtalene boronic acid ( TLC - Fluo ) As recently described [ 13 ] , mycolactone or lipid extracts were applied to a silica gel TLC plate and eluted with 90 / 9 / 1 CHCl 3 / MeOH / H 2 O as the mobile phase . The eluted TLC plate was briefly warmed on a hot plate to evaporate the organic solvents , and quickly immersed into a 0 . 1 M acetone solution of 2 - naphtalene boronic acid ( Sigma ) , then heated to 100 u C for 5 , 10 seconds . The TLC plate was then irradiated with a UV reader equipped with a 312 nm lamp . Mycolactone detection by HPLC / MS / MS Mycolactone or lipid extracts were also analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrom - etry ( HPLC / MS / MS ) . We used a Shimadzu HPLC fitted with a BDS Hypersil C8 column ( 5 m m , 4 . 6 6 250 mm ) , with UV detection at 360 nm . Mycolactone was eluted by a 60 min gradient from 50 to 95 % acetonitrile in water after 22 min . Fractions of interest were collected in glass tubes and analysed on a QSTAR XL , AB - MDS - SCIEX mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source and the following parameters : ion spray voltage ( IS ) , 5200 v ; curtain gas ( CUR ) , 25 ; gas 1 ( GS1 ) , 5 ; Figure 2 .

Data were collected and processed through the Analyst QS 1 . 1 software from AB - MDS - Sciex . Exudates Wound swabs obtained from the undermined edges of ulcerative lesions were soaked into 1 ml ethanol immediately after sampling and stored in polypropylene collecting tubes at - 20 u C , protected from light , until analysis . Ethanol solutions of exudates were concentrated to a volume of 500 m l then processed to TLC - Fluo and HPLC / MS / MS analyses . Serum samples Lipids were extracted from serum samples ( 1 ml ) by sequential addition of 4 / 1 MeOH ( v / v ) , 1 / 1 CHCl 3 ( v / v ) , and 3 / 1 H 2 O ( v / v ) , each step being followed by thorough mixing . The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the bottom organic phase transferred to a glass tube containing 3 ml of MeOH . The resulting solution was centrifuged to sediment insoluble particulate matter . The soluble organic phase was then dried and the resulting product re - suspended in ethanol for TLC - Fluo and HPLC / MS / MS analyses . Mononuclear cell pellets Mononuclear cells were isolated from 10 ml whole blood by differential sedimentation on Ficoll - Hypaque ( GE Healthcare ) . Cell pellets were then dried and stored at 2 20 u C until lipid analysis . Total lipids were extracted from cell pellets by addition of 1 ml 2 / 1 CHCl 3 / MeOH ( v / v ) for 48 h at 4 u C .

Results Efficacy of mycolactone extraction from biological samples We first compared the TLC - Fluo and HPLC / MS / MS ap - proaches for mycolactone detection in the 0 – 500 ng range , using purified mycolactone as a reference . Both methods were highly sensitive , yielding a detectable signal with only 10 ng mycolactone ( Fig . 1A , B ) . However the fluorescent signal of mycolactone modified by coupling to 2 - naphtalene boronic acid was not a linear function of its concentration , whereas the areas of mycolactone elution peaks in HPLC were proportional to mycolactone concentration in the 10 – 500 ng domain ( Fig . 1C ) . To evaluate the efficacy of mycolactone extraction from biological samples , serum samples ( 1 ml ) or mononuclear cell pellets ( 10 6 cells ) were spiked with purified mycolactone . We then proceeded to solvent extraction as described in the Methods section , and estimated the proportion of recovered mycolactone using the above - described standard curves . The estimated yields of extraction with organic solvents were of 20 % from cell pellets and 10 % from serum samples ( not shown ) . Several combinations of solvents were tried that did not improve the recovery of mycolactone . Detection of mycolactone in ulcer exudates Exudate samples were split into two equivalent parts , which were analyzed in parallel for the presence of mycolactone by HPLC / MS / MS or TLC - Fluo . We could not conclude on the presence of mycolactone by TLC - Fluo , because of the co - migration of auto - fluorescent compounds ( Fig . 2A ) . Using HPLC determination , elution peaks corresponding to mycolactone were observed in 3 / 6 newly diagnosed patients and all patients undergoing or completing their course of antibiotic treatment ( 13 / 13 , 4 / 4 respectively ) ( Table 1 ) . To confirm that they effectively contained mycolactone , elution peaks were collected in three patients , and analyzed by MS / MS . In all of them , the characteristic spectrum of mycolactone parent ion ( m / z 765 ) and products was observed [ 14 ] , demonstrating the presence and structural integrity of mycolactone in ulcer exudates ( Fig . 2B ) . Notably , the presence of mycolactone in these samples persisted during and after completion of antibiotic therapy ( Fig . 3 ) . Detection of mycolactone in blood mononuclear cells Since our previous experiments in experimentally infected mice demonstrated the presence of mycolactone in circulating mononu - clear cells , we analyzed this biological material in BU patients . Whole blood ( 10 ml ) was collected in patients from Ghana and Ivory Coast at various stages of the disease ( Table 1 ) and mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation . However , no mycolactone could be identified in any of the samples tested ( n = 52 ) by TLC - Fluo or HPLC / MS / MS ( not shown ) . Detection of mycolactone in serum Total lipids were extracted from 1 ml serum samples then analyzed by TLC - Fluo ( Ghana samples ) or HPLC ( Ivory Coast samples ) ( Table 1 ) . Again , the identification of mycolactone by TLC - Fluo was difficult , because of the co - migration of auto - fluorescent compounds ( Fig . 4A ) . Using HPLC , mycolactone detection was also hampered by the co - elution of UV - absorbing contaminants ( Fig . 4B ) . We could nevertheless identify mycolac - tone - like peaks in 3 / 5 newly diagnosed patients , 1 / 8 patients undergoing treatment , and 0 / 4 patients completing treatment . These peaks were collected in two patients and analyzed by MS / MS . In both of them , the characteristic spectrum of mycolactone parent and product ions could be observed ( Fig . 4B ) . The concentration of circulating mycolactone was evaluated in positive samples by measuring the area of mycolactone elution peaks and subtracting the mean signal of two healthy controls ( Fig . 5 ) . Calculated values were in the 40 – 200 ng / ml range . Discussion In the present study , we investigated whether mycolactone was detectable in easily accessible samples of BU patients . We used two chemical approaches , both requiring the extraction of total lipids by organic solvents . The efficacy of this extraction step , as measured by addition of pure mycolactone to control samples , was mediocre and reduced dramatically the sensitivity of the following Figure 3 . Mycolactone presence is maintained in ulcer exudates during antibiotic therapy . Mean concentration of mycolactone in ulcer exudates harvested before ( 0 week ) , during ( 2 to 8 weeks of treatment ) , or after completion of the 8 week antibiotic treatment . Dashed horizontal line indicates detection threshold . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0001237 . g003 Mycolactone as a Biomarker of Buruli ulcer Disease www . plosntds . org 5 July 2011 | Volume 5 | Issue 7 | e1237 TLC - Fluo and HPLC determinations . An explanation for such a limited yield of extraction may be that mycolactone associates with biomolecules preventing solvent access , a possibility that we are currently testing by studying the impact of various thermal and enzymatic treatments . If the efficacy and selectivity of mycolactone extraction can be improved , the recently described and field - friendly TLC - Fluo detection method may still be an option for mycolactone - based point - of - care diagnostic tests . If not , it will be necessary to design alternative approaches that do not require this purification step . Using HPLC / MS / MS , we could demonstrate that mycolactone gains access to the peripheral blood of human patients . In previous studies in the mouse model , we detected structurally intact mycolactone in mononuclear cell fractions of pooled blood samples harvested from mice subcutaneously injected with mycolactone , or experimentally infected with M . ulcerans [ 12 ] . In the present work , mycolactone could not be identified in blood mononuclear cells . This cell subpopulation was isolated from 10 ml whole blood , and we estimated the maximum yield of mycolactone extraction from mononuclear cell pellets to 20 % . If mycolactone effectively reaches blood mononuclear cells in human patients , its cellular concentration may be too low to be detected in the accessible volume of blood . Alternatively , mycolactone may be unstable in the conditions used in the present study to isolate and store mononuclear cell pellets . In contrast , we were able to demonstrate the presence of structurally intact mycolactone in the serum of 3 / 5 newly diagnosed BU patients ( Table 1 ) . This novel information provides the essential proof of concept for the design of BU diagnostic tests based on mycolactone detection in peripheral blood . Since mycolactone is extracted from serum samples with low efficacy , the number of positive samples and the calculated concentrations of circulating mycolactone are probably underestimated in this study . Whether mycolactone kinetics in serum could be employed to monitor the response to antibiotic treatment will certainly be interesting to investigate further . Our preliminary results suggest Figure 4 . Structurally intact mycolactone is detected in serum samples of BU patients . ( A ) Example of the fluorescence signals given by serum samples ( lanes 2 – 9 ) , following lipid extraction and analysis by TLC - Fluo . Controls include 1 m g pure mycolactone ( lane 1 ) , lipids extracted from a negative serum ( lane 10 ) , and then spiked with 1 m g mycolactone ( lane 11 ) . The band corresponding to mycolactone is designated by an asterisk . ( B ) Representative HPLC elution profiles of lipids extracted from serum samples are shown for one healthy control out of 5 , and one BU patient among the 4 positive ones . The corresponding MS / MS spectra show the presence of the parent and product ions of mycolactone in this positive sample . Similar results were obtained in a second one . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0001237 . g004 Mycolactone as a Biomarker of Buruli ulcer Disease www . plosntds . org 6 July 2011 | Volume | Issue 7 | e1237 5 that , in spite of a sustained presence in ulcer exudates ( Fig . 3 ) , mycolactone concentration ( Fig . 5 ) showed a tendency to decrease in the serum during antibiotic therapy . If confirmed by longitudinal studies , the decay of circulating mycolactone during antibiotic therapy would provide an explanation to the recovery of cellular immune responses during treatment [ 15 , 16 ] and after surgical excision of BU lesions [ 17 ] . Here we considered patients at ulcerative stages of the disease . BU is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms , as the identification of M . ulcerans by means of cultures or PCR requires dedicated facilities and specialized equipment ( reviewed in [ 18 ] ) . Common differential diagnoses of BU include other tropical ulcers ( venous , phagedenic , neurogenic ) , leishmaniasis , yaws and squamous cell carcinoma . The presence of biologically active mycolactone was recently demonstrated in skin biopsies of BU patients [ 11 ] . Here we show that mycolactone can be detected in ulcer exudates obtained non - invasively from wound swabs , in a structurally intact form and at concentrations in the 50 – 200 ng / ml range , which strongly suggests that mycolactone detection in exudates may be of interest for differential diagnosis of the ulcerative forms . Whether mycolactone is present at pre - ulcerative stages in fine - needle aspirates and in the peripheral blood is currently under investigation . We observed significant amounts of mycolactone in exudates at the end of antibiotic therapy . In some instances , antibiotic pressure may not efficiently block , and could even enhance the production of a toxin . For instance , in patients infected with E . coli O157 : H7 , the use of antimicrobials has been discouraged because it stimulates toxin production and augments the risk of detrimental , or even fatal complications [ 19 ] . Whether antibiotics promote the expression of mycolactone by M . ulcerans is unknown . However , their efficacy at killing M . ulcerans is not questionable with 4 weeks of treatment leading to culture negativity [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . Although a stimulatory effect of antibiotics on mycolactone production cannot be excluded , our observation suggests that mycolactone persists in cutaneous tissues after the demise of M . ulcerans . Since mycolactone displays inherent ulcerative properties [ 8 ] , this phenomenon may explain why some BU take considerable time to heal despite remaining culture negative . The administration of antibiotics is sometimes associated with adverse reactions , excessive inflammation and pain sensation , that paradoxically make the symptoms of infection worse [ 20 ] . It is possible that in BU , like in the Jarish - Heixheimer reaction in syphilis or in relapsing fevers , efficient killing of M . ulcerans by antibiotics leads to the sudden and massive release of bacterial antigens locally that act as immuno - stimulants . Mycolactone displays potent immunosuppressive properties in vitro that are thought to contribute to the cellular response defects of BU patients [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] . The rapid decline of mycolactone from the systemic circulation during treatment may thus provoke exuberant inflammatory responses at the level of the lesions , and cause the paradoxical reactions observed in BU disease [ 26 ] .
