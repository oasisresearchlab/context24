Surprisingly , the speciﬁc anti - inﬂammatory effects of GCs on different myeloid cells especially in macrophages remain poorly understood . Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that occurs worldwide and is characterized by granuloma formation in different organs . Alveolar macrophages play a role in sarcoidosis granuloma formation and progressive lung disease . The goal of the present study is to identify the effect of GCs on transcriptomic proﬁles and the cellular pathways in sarcoidosis alveolar macrophages and their corresponding blood myeloid cells . We determined and compared the whole transcriptional signatures of alveolar macrophages from sarcoidosis patients and blood CD14 + monocytes of the same subjects in response to in vitro treatment with dexamethasone ( DEX ) via RNA - sequencing . In response to DEX , we identiﬁed 2 , 834 genes that were differentially expressed in AM . Predominant pathways affected were as following : metabolic pathway ( FDR = 4 . 1 × 10 − 10 ) , lysosome ( FDR = 6 . 3 × 10 − 9 ) , phagosome ( FDR = 3 . 9 × 10 − 5 ) . The DEX effect on AMs is associated with metabolic derangements involving glycolysis , oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolisms . In contrast , the top impacted pathways in response to DEX treatment in blood CD14 + monocytes were as following ; cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction ( FDR = 6 × 10 − 6 ) and transcriptional misregulation in cancer ( FDR = 1 × 10 − 4 ) . Pathways similarly affected in both cell types were genes involved in lysosomes , cytoskeleton and transcriptional misregulation in cancer . These data suggest that the different effects of DEX on AMs and peripheral blood monocytes are partly dictated by lineage speciﬁc transcriptional programs and their physiological functions .

Dexamethasone and Sarcoidosis Macrophage Transcriptomics INTRODUCTION Pulmonary sarcoidosis is characterized by granuloma formation in the lungs . Pulmonary involvement is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sarcoidosis patients in the US , while other organ involvements including eyes , central nervous system , cardiac , and skin may lead to severe functional impairments ( 1 , 2 ) . Lungs are constantly exposed to toxins and microbial products and lung macrophages play important roles in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and are the cornerstone of granuloma formation ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . Due to their immune - modulatory actions , glucocorticoids ( GCs ) are one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of inﬂammatory and immune mediated disorders , including sarcoidosis ( 5 ) . The long - term use of GCs is limited due to profound derangements of glucose metabolism , mineral homeostasis , amino acid metabolism , cognition and eﬀects on the cardiovascular system ( 6 ) . Several studies questioned the long - term beneﬁts of GCs treatment in several respiratory diseases , including chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) . In idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis GCs treatment has been associated with worsening prognosis ( 7 – 9 ) . Similarly , the long term beneﬁts of GC treatments in sarcoidosis is unclear ( 7 ) . While GCs suppress inﬂammation by decreasing lymphocyte activation , proliferation , and survival , there is a knowledge gap in how GCs modulate the immune response of human myeloid cells and tissue macrophages , especially in sarcoidosis . Recent studies highlighted that GCs have little eﬀect in controlling inﬂammation in macrophage - dominated diseases ( 8 , 10 ) . Because AMs originated ontologically from yolk sac and adapt to maintain pulmonary hemostasis and clearance , the eﬀect of GCs on AMs may be diﬀerent as compared to myeloid derived macrophages and monocytes ( 11 ) . Additionally , in sarcoidosis the response to GCs treatment is partly dictated by organ involvement . This posits to question if tissue macrophages , especially AMs as compared to monocytes , are less susceptible to GCs treatment . Dissecting the eﬀect of GCs treatment on cellular responses of two diﬀerent macrophage lineages may uncover important molecular pathways to discriminate beneﬁcial from detrimental eﬀects of this therapy . The goal of this study was to identify the diﬀerential transcriptional signatures and signaling pathways aﬀected by corticosteroids in two relevant macrophage lineages ( AMs and peripheral monocytes ) in sarcoidosis . We performed transcriptomic analysis of isolated AMs and CD14 + monocytes from the same sarcoidosis patients in response to ex - vivo treatment with DEX . We identiﬁed common as well as unique pathways aﬀected by GCs in sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes . METHODS Study Subjects Sarcoidosis diagnosis was based on the ATS / ERS / WASOG statement ( 12 ) . The enrollment criteria for sarcoidosis patient were as previously described ( 13 – 15 ) . A total of 10 patients with sarcoidosis participated in this study . Isolation of AMs From BAL AMs were isolated from BAL ﬂuid as previously described ( 14 , 15 ) . Viability of AMs was routinely about 98 % . Immunoﬂuorescent staining with CD68 antibody conﬁrmed > 99 % purity . Isolation and Puriﬁcation of CD14 + Monocytes CD14 + monocytes were puriﬁed from PBMCs by using the MACS monocyte isolation kit ( Miltenyl Biotech , San Diego , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( 13 , 14 ) . The purity of enriched monocytes was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry using ﬂuorochrome - conjugated CD14 antibody ; the purity of monocytes was > 98 % . mRNA Isolation Sarcoidosis AMs or monocytes were cultured in the presence of DEX ( 100 ng / mL ) or vehicle for 16 h . After 16 h incubation , mRNA was isolated from puriﬁed AMs and monocytes using the Dynabeads mRNA Direct Kit ( Ambion ) as described earlier ( 13 ) . RNA - seq Library Preparation and Sequencing RNA - seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext ultradirectional library preparation protocol ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) as described earlier ( 13 ) . RNA - seq library quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer . Individually barcoded RNA - seq libraries were pooled in equimolar quantities . A pooled library of 40 samples : untreated sarcoidosis AMs ( n = 10 ) , DEX - treated sarcoidosis AMs ( n = 10 ) , untreated sarcoidosis monocytes ( n = 10 ) , and DEX - treated sarcoidosis monocytes ( n = 10 ) was sequenced on the Illumina Next - Seq 500 ( 75 cycles , PE ) . RNA - seq Data Analysis , Differential Gene Expression , and Canonical Pathway Analysis RNA - seq data were analyzed using the Illumina Basespace RNA express application . The sequencing reads were aligned to the reference human genome hg19 using STAR aligner and diﬀerentially expressed ( DE ) genes ( FDR < 5 % ) were identiﬁed with the DEseq2 analysis tool ( 16 , 17 ) . Enrichment of cellular pathway and gene ontology category was calculated using iPathwayGuidetool and Gene Trail 2 Over - Representation Analysis ( ORA ) and comparing the list of DE genes with background expressed genes . Pathway enrichment was determined at FDR < 5 % , using Benjamini and Hochberg procedure to control for multiple testing ( 18 ) .

Dexamethasone and Sarcoidosis Macrophage Transcriptomics RESULTS Effect of Dexamethasone on the Transcriptional Signature of Sarcoidosis AMs Using CD68 antibody as macrophage marker , the purity of isolated AMs was > 99 % ( Figure S1 ) . The subject demographics are displayed in Table 1 . All subjects were non - smokers , and none were on corticosteroid or other immune - suppressive medication . Isolated AMs were cultured either in the presence of DEX ( 100 ng / mL ) for 16 h or vehicle . RNA - seq libraries were prepared from DEX treated AMs ( n = 10 ) and untreated AMs ( n = 10 ) from the same subjects serving as controls . RNA - seq libraries were sequenced on one lane of the Illumina Next - Seq 500 as described previously ( 13 ) . Using DeSeq2 , we identiﬁed 2834 DE genes ( log 2 - fold change ( FC ) > 0 . 6 and FDR < 5 % ) between DEX - treated vs . untreated AMs from same sarcoidosis patients ( Figure 1A ) . The Gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis of DE genes ( FDR < 5 % ) showed that the signiﬁcant biological processes impacted after DEX treatment were neutrophil degranulation ( FDR = 1 . 7 × 10 − 7 ) , regulation of transcription ( FDR = 3 . 3 × 10 − 4 ) , and insulin receptor signaling ( FDR = 4 . 1 × 10 − 4 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Most genes involved in neutrophil degranulation were downregulated . CD14 is a general marker for myeloid cells ( macrophages and monocytes ) , but it has been shown that activated neutrophil exhibit surface CD14 ( 19 ) . The analysis of biological function enrichment showed lysosome and lysosomal membrane as signiﬁcant cellular components aﬀected by DEX treatment ( Figure 1C ) . Table 2 summarizes the most up and down regulated genes in response to DEX treatment in sarcoidosis AMs . Increased expression of several of these genes has been reported in THP - 1 cell lines or monocyte - derived dendritic cells in response to DEX treatment ( 20 – 22 ) . We identiﬁed that DEX - treatment induced the expression of two novel genes ; Ring ﬁnger protein ( RNF ) 175 and amine oxidase copper containing 2 ( AOC2 ) . Other upregulated genes were formyl peptide receptor 1 ( FPR1 ) ( log 2 FC = 2 . 6 , FDR = 1 . 8 × 10 − 7 ) and Vanin 1 ( VNN1 ) ( log 2 FC = 2 . 0 , FDR = 7 . 1 × 10 − 7 ) . FPR1 is a member of the G - protein coupled receptor 1 family encoding protein ( 21 ) , which mediates the response of phagocytic cells to microorganisms . Vanin 1 belongs to vanin gene family and has pantetheinase activity and participates in hematopoietic cell traﬃcking ( 23 ) . Similarly , complement factor properdin ( CFP ) ( log 2 FC = 1 . 3 , FDR = 7 . 4 × 10 − 5 ) was upregulated . This gene positively regulates the alternative complement pathway . DEX - treatment downregulated several small nucleolar RNA box genes , solute carrier families and integrin genes in sarcoid AMs . Pathway enrichment analysis identiﬁed over 50 signiﬁcant pathways aﬀected by DEX treatment ( Figure 1D ) . The most signiﬁcant pathways were metabolic pathway ( FDR = 4 . 1 × 10 − 10 ) , lysosome ( FDR = 6 . 3 × 10 − 9 ) , phagosome ( FDR = 3 . 9 × 10 − 5 ) , FoxO signaling pathway ( FDR = 7 × 10 − 6 ) , transcriptional misregulation in cancer ( FDR = 1 . 6 × 10 − 6 ) , and regulation of actin cytoskeleton ( FDR = 5 . 7 × 10 − 5 ) .

Effect of Dexamethasone on Metabolic Pathway We found that 237 DE genes are involved in metabolic pathway of which 65 genes were upregulated and 172 genes were downregulated . To determine the metabolic pathways impacted by DEX treatment , we performed a pathway analysis of these 237 genes using Gene Trail 2 . The most signiﬁcant pathways were as following ; oxidative phosphorylation ( FDR = 1 . 4 × 10 − 36 ) , carbon ( FDR = 4 . 7 × 10 − 34 ) , purine metabolism ( FDR = 4 . 2 × 10 − 22 ) , pyrimidine metabolism ( FDR = 4 . 8 × 10 − 18 ) , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) ( FDR = 2 . 3 × 10 − 17 ) , glycolysis ( FDR = 2 . 4 × 10 − 16 ) , and fatty acid metabolism ( FDR = 2 . 1 × 10 − 12 ) . Figure 2 shows the heatmap of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism ( A ) , oxidative phosphorylation ( B ) , and lysosome pathway ( C ) in response to DEX - treatment . DEX - treatment led to downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation . Speciﬁcally , DEX - treatment downregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ ( PPAR γ ) co - activator 1 Beta gene ( PPARGC1B ) ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 4 , FDR = 3 . 08 × 10 − 9 ) . PPAR γ co - activator is known to be the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis , oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism ( 24 , 25 ) . In contrast , DEX increased expression of genes involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism . Fucose - 1 - phosphate guanylyltransferase ( FPGT ) increased in response to DEX treatment by 2 folds . Protein encoded by this gene participates in phosphorylation of L - fucose to form beta - L - fucose - 1 - phosphate which is a substrate of fucose - 1 - phosphate Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 3 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 779 Talreja et al . Dexamethasone and Sarcoidosis Macrophage Transcriptomics FIGURE 1 | Differential gene expression and Gene Ontology ( GO ) processes and signiﬁcant pathways between DEX - treated compared to untreated sarcoid AMs . ( A ) Volcano plot : 2 , 834 signiﬁcant DE genes analyzed by DEseq2 analysis tool are represented in terms of their measured expression fold change ( log 2 FC ) on the x - axis and the signiﬁcance of the change ( – log 10 adj p - value ) on the y - axis . The dotted lines represent the thresholds used to select the DE genes : log 2 - fold change ( > 0 . 6 ) and signiﬁcance ( FDR < 5 % ) . The up - regulated genes ( positive log 2 FC ) are shown in red , while the down - regulated ( negative log 2 FC ) genes are shown in blue . ( B , C ) Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis of DE genes . To assess the enrichment of GO terms Elim pruning method was used . GO analysis identiﬁed top ( B ) biological processes and ( C ) cellular components . ( D ) Pathway analysis on the DE genes was performed considering a threshold of log 2 FC > 0 . 6 and FDR < 5 % using iPathwayGuide analysis tool that uses two types of evidence : the over - representation on the horizontal axis ( pORA ) and the perturbation on the vertical axis ( pAcc ) . Signiﬁcant pathways ( FDR < 5 % ) are shown in red , whereas non - signiﬁcant are in black . The size of the circle is proportional to the number of genes in that pathway . guanylyltransferase and GTP to form GDP - beta - L - fucose ( 26 ) . AOC2 gene ( log 2 FC = 3 , FDR = 1 . 1 × 10 − 13 ) catalyzes the oxidative conversion of amines to aldehydes and ammonia in the presence of copper and quinone cofactor and is associated with eye diseases ( 27 ) . Glutamate - ammonia ligase ( GLUL ) expression is also increased in response to DEX ( log 2 FC = 2 , FDR = 3 . 8 × 10 − 11 ) . The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia in an ATP - dependent reaction ( 28 ) . It is a key protein of glutamine synthesis and essential for cellular metabolism including macrophages ( 29 ) . DEX upregulated the genes involved in insulin receptor signaling . For instance ; insulin receptor substrate 2 ( IRS2 ) ( log 2 FC = 1 . 2 , FDR = 5 . 4 × 10 − 5 ) , insulin receptor ( INSR ) ( log 2 FC = 1 . 0 , FDR = 2 . 0 × 10 − 3 ) , and phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase regulatory subunit 1 ( PIK3R1 ) ( log 2 FC = 1 . 0 , FDR = 3 . 4 × 10 − 6 ) . AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is an important energy - sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status . DEX upregulated the expression of genes that encode AMPK subunits , including catalytic subunit alpha 1 ( PRKAA1 ) ( log 2 FC = 0 . 96 , FDR = 1 . 8 × 10 − 5 ) and non - catalytic subunit beta 2 ( PRKAB2 ) ( log 2 FC = 0 . 95 , FDR = 6 . 2 × 10 − 11 ) ( 30 ) . The catalytic subunit of AMPK protects cells from ATP depletion by switching oﬀ ATP - consuming biosynthetic pathways ( 30 ) . Modulation of Phago - Lysosomal Genes by Dexamethasone The lysosomal pathway was the second most impacted pathway in response to DEX treatment . Figure 2C shows the eﬀect of DEX treatment on the gene expression involved in the lysosome pathway in sarcoidosis AMs . Among 44 lysosomal genes only 6 genes were upregulated while the rest were down regulated in response to DEX treatment . Clathrin heavy chain like ( CLTCL ) 1 expression increased 4 fold ( log 2 FC = 2 . 0 , FDR = 8 . 2 × 10 − 8 ) in response to DEX treatment . Clathrin coated vesicles have been shown to endocytose accumulated protein aggregates and direct them to the lysosome for further degradation ( 31 ) . Cathepsins represent the major components of the lysosomal proteolytic system . Cathepsin F ( CTSF ) ( log 2 FC = 1 . 5 , FDR = 0 . 8 × 10 − 7 ) and cathepsin O ( CTSO ) ( log 2 FC = 0 . 65 , FDR = 5 . 4 × 10 − 3 ) were upregulated . Galactosylceramidase ( GALC ) hydrolyzes the galactose ester bonds of galactosylceramide and was increased ( log 2 FC = 1 . 0 , FDR = 9 . 1 × 10 − 5 ) . Lysosomal related genes involved in V - ATPase dependent organelle acidiﬁcation such as T Cell Immune Regulator 1 ( TCIRG1 ) ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 3 , FDR = 1 . 4 × 10 − 16 ) , lysosomal proteases ( CTSK ) ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 1 , FDR = 6 . 3 × 10 − 4 ) , sulfatases ( ARSB ) ( log 2 FC = − 0 . 8 , FDR = 1 . 5 × 10 − 5 ) , and lysosomal membrane proteins ( LAMP ) ( log 2 FC = − 0 . 7 , FDR = 3 . 5 × 10 − 3 ) were signiﬁcantly decreased in response to DEX treatment . Cathepsin K ( CTSK ) expression was downregulated in sarcoid AMs after DEX treatment . CTSK , a lysosomal cysteine protease , is proteolytic for matrix proteins , including gelatin and ﬁbrillar collagens . It has been shown to play a key role in protecting against lung ﬁbrosis ( 28 ) . The Mucolipin 1 ( MCOLN1 ) gene that encodes a member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP ) cation channel gene family was downregulated ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 1 , FDR = 2 . 6 × 10 − 10 ) . MCOLN1 has been suggested to regulate fusion / ﬁssion of vesicles in the endocytic pathway ( 32 ) , and lysosomal ion homeostasis . Mutations in the MCOLN1 gene have been reported with lysosomal storage disease ( 33 ) . The Transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) gene was downregulated ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 7 , FDR = 2 . 2 × 10 − 9 ) . TFEB plays an important role in lysosomal biogenesis , autophagy and cellular metabolism ( 34 ) . These data show that DEX treatment downregulates genes of the lysosomal pathway and lysosomal biogenesis that are involved in uptake and acidiﬁcation processes and in the proteolysis of degraded proteins / debris in lysosomes .

Upregulated genes in response to DEX treatment were as following : member RAS oncogene family RAB5A ( log 2 FC = 0 . 7 , FDR = 3 . 39 × 10 − 11 ) that is required for the fusion of plasma membranes and early endosomes , TLR4 ( log 2 FC = 1 . 5 , FDR = 2 . 8 × 10 − 7 ) , TLR5 ( log 2 FC = 1 . 1 , FDR = 4 . 1 × 10 − 2 ) , TLR8 ( log 2 FC = 0 . 8 , FDR = 4 . 1 × 10 − 3 ) , dynein cytoplasmic 1 light intermediate chain 2 ( DYNC1L ) ( log 2 FC = 0 . 8 , FDR = 5 . 7 × 10 − 15 ) and dynein cytoplasmic 2 heavy chain 1 ( DYNC2H1 ) ( log 2 FC = 1 . 6 , FDR = 1 . 3 × 10 − 6 ) . This gene encodes a large cytoplasmic dynein protein involved in retrograde transport in the cilium and intra ﬂagellar transport , a process required for ciliary / ﬂagellar assembly . Cytoplasmic dynein - 1 transports cargo into cell interior toward microtubule minus ends ( 35 ) . Dynein - 2 , also known as intra ﬂagellar transport dynein , moves cargoes along the axoneme of eukaryotic cilia and ﬂagella ( 36 ) . They are important for ciliary function , neuron and phagolysosome formation ( 30 , 37 ) . Aberrant function of the protein has been reported in ciliary dysfunction ( 35 ) . Three genes encoding subunits of NADPH oxidase complex were downregulated . These were CYBA ( p22 - PHOX ) ( log 2 FC = − 0 . 7 , FDR = 7 . 2 × 10 − 9 ) , CYBB ( log 2 FC = − 0 . 8 , FDR = 1 . 0 × 10 − 3 ) and NCF2 ( log 2 FC = − 0 . 9 , FDR = 1 . 0 × 10 − 4 ) . While NCF - 1 gene expression was upregulated ( log 2 FC = 1 . 72 , FDR = 3 . 7 × 10 − 8 ) . NADPH oxidase is a key producer of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) participating in killing of bacteria in phagosomes . Mutation in this gene is associated with chronic granulomatous disease ( 38 ) . Transcriptional Misregulation in Cancer DEX treatment of sarcoidosis AMs upregulated the expression of 18 genes and downregulated the expression of 20 genes related to transcriptional misregulation in cancer .

( A ) Fatty acid metabolism , ( B ) Oxidative phosphorylation , ( C ) Lysosomal pathway . The thresholds used to select the DE genes : log 2 FC > 0 . 6 and FDR < 5 % . Green shade represents high expression and red shade represents low expression . 15 - hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( HPGD ) was increased log 2 FC = 1 . 5 , FDR = 9 . 3 × 10 − 4 ) . HPGD is involved in the degradation of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE 2 ) and hence suppresses tumor formation and inhibits inﬂammation induced by PGE 2 ( 39 , 40 ) . DEX treatment increased the expression of the FLT3 gene ( log 2 FC = 1 . 5 , FDR = 1 . 4 × 10 − 3 ) . This gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase promoting Ras signaling , which plays a key role in survival , proliferation and diﬀerentiation of hematopoietic cells ( 41 – 43 ) . Myocyte enhancer factor 2C ( MEF2C ) expression was upregulated ( log 2 FC = 1 . 0 × 10 − 6 , FDR = 3 . 8 × 10 − 8 ) . MEF2C , a member of the MADS family of transcription factors , regulates hematopoietic self - renewal and diﬀerentiation , supports the proliferation of leukemias , and is associated with increased risk of relapse in leukemia patients as its phosphorylation leads to chemotherapy resistance ( 44 ) . The NFKB inhibitor zeta ( NFKBIZ ) gene that encodes for IkappaB - zeta , a transcriptional regulator for NF - kappaB , was upregulated ( log 2 FC = 1 . 5 , FDR = 1 . 0 × 10 − 5 ) with DEX treatment . It has been shown to induce pro - inﬂammatory responses and lymphoproliferative disorders and in solid tumors ( 45 ) . The MDM2 proto - oncogene ( log 2 FC = 1 . 5 , FDR = 1 . 0 × 10 − 6 ) encodes a nuclear - localized E3 ubiquitin ligase , promoting tumor formation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins , such as p53 , for proteasomal degradation . The upregulated expression of the FLT3 , MEF2C , NFKBIZ , and MDM2 genes in sarcoid AMs suggests the potential side eﬀect of DEX and it may lead to increased risk of tumor cell proliferation . DEX treatment modulated expression of several genes related to focal adhesion and cytoskeleton , including integrin families . Cyclin D2 ( CCND2 ) functions as regulators of CDK kinases important for cell cycle G1 / S transition was downregulated ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 7 , FDR = 1 . 3 × 10 − 4 ) ( 46 ) . Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton One of the major pathways aﬀected by DEX treatment was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton .

Plakophilin 2 ( PKP2 ) encoding a plakophilin protein , was signiﬁcantly upregulated ( log 2 log 2 FC = 4 . 6 , FDR = 7 . 9 × 10 − 19 ) . Plakophilin 2 participates in linking cadherins to intermediate ﬁlaments in the cytoskeleton and cardiac muscles . It has been shown to be associated with several types of cancers in humans ( 48 ) . PKP2 regulates calcium signaling in cardiac muscles ( 49 ) . The slingshot homolog 2 ( SSH2 ) gene was upregulated ( log 2 FC = 1 . 2 , FDR = 1 . 0 × 10 − 6 ) . SSH2 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase , which regulates actin ﬁlaments by dephosphorylating and activating coﬁlin which promotes actin ﬁlament depolymerization ( 50 ) . The actin regulatory protein , coﬁlin / actin depolymerization factor ( ADF ) , serves a vital function in cells by severing ﬁlaments , thereby increasing the number of ﬁlament ends from which polymerization and depolymerization can occur ( 47 ) . The coﬁlin pathway is important for actin dynamics , cell movement , cytoskeleton , distribution of receptors and synapse formation and migration of immune cells . It is critical for phagocytosis , motility , and antigen presentation in macrophages , dendritic cells , and neuronal cells ( 51 ) . Similarly , we found that DEX treatment downregulated the expression of several integrin membrane protein genes . Few of these genes are : Integrin subunit beta and alpha , ITGB7 and ITGA7 ( log 2 FC = − 1 . 2 , FDR = 4 . 6 × 10 − 5 ) , ITGAM , ITGA6 , ITGB2 . These genes code for integrins / adhesion receptors involved in leucocyte migration . Effect of Dexamethasone on Genes Related to Inﬂammation The TSC22 domain family member 3 gene ( TSC22D3 ) was found to be highly upregulated in sarcoid AMs after DEX treatment ( Table 2 ) . TSC22D3 gene encodes GC - induced leucine zipper transcription factor , whose expression is rapidly induced by GC , IL - 10 and TGF - β ( 52 , 53 ) . This protein has been shown to play a key role in immunosuppressive eﬀects of GCs . DEX upregulated the expression of genes involved in the negative regulation of inﬂammation , including Dual speciﬁcity phosphatase ( DUSP ) 1 , also known as MKP1 , which is a phosphatase involved in the dephosphorylation of MAPKs ( 15 ) , and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS4 and SOCS6 ) . DEX downregulated the expression of various genes that play a key role in inﬂammation . Gene expression for interleukin 6 receptor complex ( IL6R ) , TNF - receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF4 ) and MyD88 , essential signaling molecules in TLR and IL - 1 signaling were decreased in response to dexamethasone treatment . FIGURE 3 | Differential gene expression and Gene Ontology ( GO ) processes between sarcoid DEX - treated and untreated sarcoid monocytes .

Dexamethasone and Sarcoidosis Macrophage Transcriptomics Effect of Dexamethasone on Transcriptional Signature of Sarcoidosis CD14 + Monocytes To decrease the eﬀect of genetic variation , we used the same cohort of patients used for the AMs study . To identify genes responsive to GC on sarcoidosis monocytes , we isolated CD14 + monocytes from PBMCs and treated in a similar fashion with DEX . In response to DEX treatment 1 , 958 genes were diﬀerentially expressed in monocytes ( log 2 - fold change of 0 . 6 and FDR < 5 % ) ( Figure 3A ) . The Gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis showed that the signiﬁcant biological processes impacted after DEX treatment were classic complement activation , leukocyte , T and B cell activation as well as phagocytosis ( Figure 3B ) and signiﬁcant cellular components impacted are shown in Figure 3C . Next , we performed pathway enrichment analyses . The top impacted pathways in monocytes were as following : cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction ( FDR = 6 × 10 − 6 ) , transcriptional misregulation in cancer ( FDR = 1 × 10 − 4 ) , Type I DM ( FDR = 2 . 6 × 10 − 3 ) , cell adhesion ( FDR = 0 . 003 ) , cytoskeleton ( FDR = 2 . 0 × 10 − 3 ) , RAS signaling ( FDR = 2 . 0 × 10 − 3 ) , and JAK - STAT pathway ( FDR = 2 . 0 × 10 − 3 ) ( Figure 4A ) . The top most impacted pathway in CD14 + monocytes in response to DEX treatment was related to cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction . DEX treatment decreased expression of numerous cytokine and chemokine genes in sarcoidosis monocytes , while increasing the expression of CXCL10 and IL - 10 . In contrast , DEX treatment led to a signiﬁcant decrease in expression of CCL22 ( also known as macrophage - derived chemokine ) and CCL24 . CCL22 is produced by myeloid cells and regulates migration of leukocytes ( 54 ) . Many genes related to tumor necrosis factor alpha superfamily members , TNFRSF8 , 9 , 11 , 14 , and 15 were down regulated in response to DEX treatment . Figure 4B shows the heatmap of genes involved in cytokine pathways . Similarly , gene expression for several TNF receptor associated factors ( TRAFs ) that are important for the TLR and TNF signaling activation were decreased . In contrast , FIGURE 4 | Signiﬁcant pathways enriched in DEX - treated compared to untreated sarcoid monocytes .

Similar to AMs , the pathway related to transcription misregulation in cancer was signiﬁcantly impacted in response to DEX treatment of sarcoidosis monocytes . The top most upregulated gene in response to DEX treatment in sarcoidosis monocytes was actin binding LIM protein family member 3 ( ABLIM3 ) ( log 2 FC = 3 . 1 , FDR = 1 . 0 × 10 − 6 ) ( Table 3 ) . The encoded protein interacts with F actin ﬁlaments and is a component of adherents junctions in several cell types , including cardiac myocytes ( 55 ) . Several genes related to retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) and retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) were downregulated in response to DEX treatment . These are important members of the steroid / thyroid hormone receptors acting predominantly as transcription factors ( 56 ) . Concordance Between DEX - Treated Sarcoidosis AMs and Monocytes In response to DEX 2169 genes were exclusively diﬀerentially expressed in sarcoid AMs , while 1293 DE genes were found in sarcoid monocytes as shown in Venn diagram ( Figure 5A ) . These results show that the impact of DEX treatment is more profound on sarcoid AMs as compared to monocytes . Figure 6 shows 665 DE genes overlapping in DEX - treated sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes . We found that the eﬀect of DEX on overlap DE genes was similar except for a few genes . DEX treatment upregulated the expression of activin A receptor type 2B ( ACVR2B ) , MYC proto - oncogene , bHLH transcription factor ( MYC ) , zinc ﬁnger and BTB domain containing 18 ( ZBTB18 ) genes in AMs whereas it downregulated their expression in monocytes . ZBTB18 encodes a C2H2 - type zinc ﬁnger protein and acts a transcriptional repressor of genes involved in neuronal development . Further , we performed the pathway enrichment analysis on the common DE genes in both cell types . The common pathways that were enriched in both DEX - treated AMs and monocytes were Rap1 signaling pathway , lysosomal pathway , PI3kinase signaling pathway , transcriptional misregulation in cancer , Type I diabetes mellitus ( Figure 5B ) . DISCUSSION Macrophages have a central role in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and host - defense . They play a crucial role in granuloma formation and provide metabolic cues for T cell responses in sarcoidosis . Alveolar macrophages , similar to other tissue associated macrophages have evolved to perform phagocytic clearance of pathogens and dying cells in the lungs immune - surveillance of the lung for inhaled pathogens as well as homeostatic regulation of lung tissues ( 11 , 57 ) . Circulating monocytes have the potential to diﬀerentiate into monocyte derived tissue macrophages and to migrate and interact with antigen - speciﬁc T and B lymphocytes to initiate adaptive immune responses . Glucocorticoids modulate host immune responses to pathogens . In inﬂammatory diseases , including sarcoidosis , GCs have been used as an immunosuppressive drug to reduce inﬂammation ( 58 ) . It has been shown that GCs suppress the expression of inﬂammatory genes , including TNF - α and Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 9 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 779 Talreja et al .

IFN - γ , and chemokines that are important for the granuloma formation and cell mediated Th1 responses . GCs are the only FDA approved drug to treat pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis ( 59 ) . However , despite their widespread use , there is a lack of evidence for their long term survival beneﬁt in sarcoidosis or prevention of end organ damage such as lung ﬁbrosis ( 58 ) . In contrast , long term use of GCs has been shown to have signiﬁcant side eﬀects aﬀecting all systems in the body ( 60 ) . The most common side eﬀects are excessive weight gain , insomnia , diabetes , osteoporosis , arterial hypertension and depression ( 60 ) . To determine the eﬀect of GCs on transcriptome proﬁling of sarcoid AMs and CD14 + monocytes , we compared the RNA - seq data of sarcoidosis AMs and CD14 + cells treated with dexamethasone in vitro vs . untreated sarcoidosis AMs and CD14 + monocytes , respectively . To decrease the confounding factors related to human genetic variation , we isolated the CD14 + peripheral blood monocytes and AMs from the BALs of the same sarcoidosis subjects and compared pairwise RNA seq results . We identiﬁed two major pathways impacted after DEX treatment : metabolic and phagolysosomal pathways . Metabolic reprogramming in macrophages is critically important for their eﬀector function ( 61 , 62 ) . Figure 7 summarizes perturbation of genes related to metabolic pathways . We found that DEX treatment leads to suppression of gene expression related to glycolysis , fatty acid oxidation , TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 6 ) . In contrast , GCs enhance the expression of genes related to amino acid degradation pathways and generation of glutamine from glutamate ( GLUL ) . Dexamethasone eﬀected genes involved in metabolism of glucogenic amino acids ( AAs ) and ketogenic AAs , suggesting increased glucogenesis and fatty acid precursors ( Figure 6 ) . These alterations in response to dexamethasone explains some of the adverse eﬀects seen in these patients after treatment with GCs , including loss of muscle mass , and lipodystrophy ( 63 ) . Other important dexamethasone eﬀects were its eﬀects on genes involved in lysosome and phagosome functions . Lysosomes are the common platform for endocytosis , phagocytosis , autophagy and biosynthetic routes . They receive both extracellular and intracellular - derived molecular cargo , Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 10 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 779 Talreja et al . Dexamethasone and Sarcoidosis Macrophage Transcriptomics FIGURE 6 | Effect of DEX on metabolic pathways in sarcoid AMs . The pathway analysis of metabolic DE genes showed that the major pathways affected in DEX - treated sarcoid AMs as compared to untreated sarcoid AMS were : Glycolysis , Citric acid cycle ( TCA ) , Oxidative phosphorylation ( OxPhos ) , β - oxidation of fatty acids and Amino acid ( AA ) metabolism . DEX - treatment resulted in the downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis , TCA cycle , Oxphos and β - oxidation of fatty acids . Alteration in these pathways suggests that glucose metabolism is decreased ; glucose is not being utilized completely to generate energy producing molecules ATP and NADH . Reduced β - oxidation of fatty acids suggests that fatty acids are not being transported and degraded optimally in mitochondria to generate energy . Suboptimal fatty acid oxidation may result in the accumulation of long chain fatty acids and metabolites . The upregulation of genes involved in AA metabolism shows that DEX - treated sarcoid AMs may switch to AA catabolism as a source of energy . AAs catabolism results in the conversion of AAs either to pyruvate or intermediates of TCA cycle for energy production or generation of precursors of glucogenesis and fatty acid synthesis . damaged organelles , engulfed dead cells , and foreign particulates like bacteria for digestion . Tissue macrophages , including AMs , are sentinel cells that are equipped with a series of mechanisms of vesicular traﬃcking to orchestrate the elimination of bacteria as well as dead cells and debris ( 60 ) . Clearance of bacteria by macrophages involves internalization of the microorganisms into phagosomes , which are then delivered to endo - lysosomes for enzymatic degradation . Lysosomes are a central organelle in the processing of exogenous and intracellular biomolecules . Thus , the ﬁnal clearance of pathogens depend on lysosomal function ( 64 ) . Lysosomes integrate and facilitate cross - talk between nutritional signals such as AA and energy levels , membrane damage and infection , and ultimately enable responses such as autophagy , cell growth , membrane repair and microbe clearance ( 65 , 66 ) . Lysosomes are hubs for cellular signaling and nutritional sensing through interplay with mTOR , AMPK , and GSK signaling ( 65 ) . DEX - treated AMs show signiﬁcantly decreased gene expression for the phagosome and lysosome machinery . For instance , transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) , a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and fusion ( 65 ) was signiﬁcantly downregulated in sarcoidosis AMs in response to DEX . Figure 7 shows the downregulation of lysosome pathway genes encoding lysosomal acid hydrolases , membrane proteins , acidiﬁcation and biogenesis proteins . Our results show that DEX - treatment led to the downregulation of two important genes , TFEB and PPARGC1 ( PGC1 ) that play an important role in lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular metabolism . TFEB has been shown to control lipid catabolism and control the expression of PGC1 α ( 34 , 67 ) . The DEX induced downregulation of TFEB , PGC1 α , mitochondrial Acyl - CoA Dehydrogenase short chain fatty acid ( ACADS ) and very long - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) , as well as lysosomal genes in sarcoid AMs . This suggests that DEX - treatment decreases fatty acid oxidation and thus may lead to increased lipid deposition . Furthermore , DEX - treatment upregulated the expression of the CLTC1 gene ( lysosomal pathway ) that may contribute to accumulation of clathrin coated vesicles containing aggregated proteins . In contrast , the downregulation of lysosomal genes involved in proteolysis and acidiﬁcation suggests that DEX - treatment inhibits the proteolytic degradation . This may result in lysosomal overload with protein aggregates and fatty acid deposits . Decreased lysosomal function may lead to an increase in unfolded protein accumulation and ﬁnally to unfolded protein response and ER stress ( 68 ) . Because pathogens and antigens may play a role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis , the downregulation of lysosomes and phagosome by DEX may have negative implications for the disease progression .

Graphic illustration of pathway analysis of DE ( log 2 FC > 0 . 6 with FDR < 0 . 05 ) genes related to lysosome pathway in sarcoid - DEX treated AMs . The pathway diagram is overlaid with the computed perturbation of each gene . The perturbation accounts both for the gene’s measured fold changes and for accumulated perturbation propagated from any upstream genes ( accumulation ) . The color intensity corresponds to the level of upregulation ( red ) or downregulation ( blue ) of the DE genes in sarcoid - DEX treated AMs vs . sarcoid untreated AMs . Similar to rheumatoid arthritis , some studies have shown an increased risk of developing cancer in sarcoidosis patients , while others could not conﬁrm such association ( 69 – 73 ) . While it is diﬃcult to interpret uncontrolled and retrospective observational studies , the increased risk is partly attributed to uncontrolled inﬂammation . Our study showed that transcriptional misregulation in cancer was also one of the enriched pathways in response to DEX treatment . We found that DEX treatment upregulated the expression of numerous genes involved in cell proliferation , tumor formation and lymphoproliferative disorders . Interestingly , DEX treatment led to upregulation of this pathway in the monocytes of sarcoidosis subjects , suggesting that this eﬀect is a global eﬀect . These results demonstrate that long - term usage of DEX may lead to uncontrolled proliferation . For example : RAS superfamily gene are proto - oncogene that are involved in the development of various cancers ( 74 , 75 ) . It has been shown that DEX upregulates several members of this family ( 76 ) . Our data is in line with previous RNA seq data of cultured human pulmonary type II A549 cells showing upregulation of transcriptional misregulation in cancer in response to corticosteroids ( 77 ) . In response to DEX treatment , we identiﬁed derangement of large numbers of genes regulating the cytoskeleton . Most genes belong to integrin family , but also genes involved in desmosomes such as PKP2 gene encoding a protein which links cadherins to intermediate ﬁlaments in the cytoskeleton . Aberrant regulation of these genes , including PKP2 , ITGA6 , and seven are important for cytoskeleton and cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions and are associated with cardiomyopathy , arrhythmogenic R ventricular cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Collectively , these data suggest that dexamethasone drives a broad gene expression program promoting matrix stiﬀening and supporting ﬁbroblast proliferation and selective but coordinated suppression of genes encoding collagen - degrading enzymes . On the other hand , our results show that DEX treatment altered the expression of genes involved in inﬂammation and immune responses . DEX treatment led to decreased expression of genes related to inﬂammation including IL6R , IL - 17R , TNFRSF4 , and MyD88 . Along with this DEX treatment upregulated the expression of several genes that suppress inﬂammation , including Glucocorticoid - Induced Leucine Zipper Protein ( GLIZ , also known as TSC22D3 ) , dual speciﬁcity phosphatase 1 ( DUSP1 , also known as MKP - 1 ) , Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling ( SOCS ) 4 and 6 . We have previously shown that DUSP1 expression is decreased in sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes and GCs induced Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 12 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 779 Talreja et al . Dexamethasone and Sarcoidosis Macrophage Transcriptomics DUSP1 expression at the protein level ( 15 ) . Current RNA seq data in an independent cohort of patients is in agreement with our previous results . CONCLUDING REMARKS For more than 60 years GCs have been used as anti - inﬂammatory drugs to treat a variety of inﬂammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary diseases such as sarcoidosis . Given the fact that macrophages play a critical role in infectious and non - infectious granulomatous diseases ( 78 , 79 ) , it is of surprise that the eﬀects of GCs on macrophages are less well - documented . Here we show that DEX treatment led to profound transcriptomic changes related to cellular metabolisms , lysosomes / phagosomes , and cytoskeleton in lung tissue macrophages . While similar eﬀects were observed after DEX treatment on isolated CD14 + monocytes of the same subjects , the eﬀect on cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction was more prominent in monocytes , suggesting that the eﬀect on lung tissue macrophages are more likely due to lysosomal function metabolic derangement . Further studies need to determine the eﬀects of DEX on proteome proﬁle in diﬀerent cell types and correlation with RNA seq data .
