CYTOSKELETON The mother of all actins ? New insights into the structure of filaments made of crenactin , a homolog of actin found in archaea , shed light on how the cytoskeleton might have evolved . FELIPE MERINO AND STEFAN RAUNSER T here was a time when most scientists believed that eukaryotes had cytoskele - tons and that bacteria and archaea did not . This view changed in the early 1990s when a bacterial protein – that was later identified as a tubulin homolog – was shown to form a ring - like structure that is essential for bacterial cells to divide ( Bi and Lutkenhaus , 1991 ; Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus , 1994 ) . It has since been discovered that bacteria and archaea carry homologs for all the components of the eukary - otic cytoskeleton – actin , tubulin and intermedi - ate filaments ( Shih and Rothfield , 2006 ) . What is more , we now know that many of these homo - logs form complex filamentous structures and fulfill similar roles to the cytoskeleton of eukar - yotes . This indicates that the cytoskeleton most likely evolved further back in the history of life on Earth than originally thought . The first eukaryotic cells are thought to have originated after an archaeal cell engulfed an ancient bacterium and the two established a symbiotic relationship ( Rivera et al . , 1998 ; Yutin et al . , 2008 ) . An archaeon called Pyrobac - ulum calidifontis is believed to be one of the closest living relatives of the ancestral archaea involved in this event ( Guy and Ettema , 2011 ) , and has been studied by many researchers . A key component in the cytoskeleton of P . calidi - fontis – a protein called crenactin – is a homolog of actin . While crenactin is only ~ 20 % identical to eukaryotic actin , of all the proteins found out - side of the eukaryotes , it is the one that is most closely related to actin ( Ettema et al . , 2011 ) . Two years ago , Jan Lo¨we , Thierry Izore´ and colleagues at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology reported that the crystal structure of crenactin was similar to that of eukaryotic actin in many respects ( Figure 1 ) . However , while actin forms double - stranded filaments , crenactin appeared to form only single - stranded helices ( Izore´ et al . , 2014 ) . Using electron cryo - micros - copy , another group later reported that crenac - tin also forms single - stranded helices in solution ( Braun et al . , 2015 ) . Now , in eLife , Lo¨we and colleagues – includ - ing Izore´ as first author – have used electron cryo - microscopy to further investigate the struc - ture of crenactin filaments ( Izore´ et al . , 2016 ) . However , contrary to the previous reports , Izore´ et al . now show that crenactin filaments are more similar to actin filaments than previously thought . Indeed , both form parallel , double - stranded filaments with a similar helical arrange - ment , and the individual subunits in a crenactin filament interact like those in an actin filament . Izore´ et al . note that the earlier studies used salt concentrations much higher than the con - centrations that P . calidifontis needs to grow . Although the salt concentration inside this bac - terium is not known so far , they suggest that this could have interfered with how the filaments formed and could thus explain the discrepancy between the previous and new results . The dou - ble - stranded filaments also seem to be more stable than the single - stranded crenactin Copyright Merino and Raunser .

This meant that Izore´ et al . could , for the first time , study crenactin filaments in enough detail to be able to distinguish their finer features . The strong resemblance between actin and crenactin suggests that actin has looked much like it does today since early on in the evolution of eukaryotes . Interestingly , actin is required for phagocytosis , the process by which a eukaryotic cell engulfs a bacterium . As mentioned above , it is thought a similar mechanism gave rise to the first eukaryotes ( Yutin et al . , 2009 ) , and the presence of a working actin - like cytoskeleton in the ancestral archaea would certainly support this idea . The gene encoding crenactin is part of a group of five genes called the arcade cluster that are found within the genomes of the Cren - archaeota ( Ettema et al . , 2011 ) . This is the group of archaea to which P . caldifontis belongs and which gives crenactin its name . In P . caldi - fontis , three proteins encoded by other genes in the arcade cluster – called arcadin - 1 , - 3 , and - 4 – localize with crenactin filaments inside cells , hint - ing that they might interact . In contrast , arcadin - 2 does not co - localize with filaments ( Ettema et al . , 2011 ) . Izore´ et al . also report that the C - terminal region of arcadin - 2 strongly interacts with indi - vidual crenactin proteins , effectively sequester - ing them and preventing them from Figure 1 . Crenactin is a member of the actin superfamily . Representative structures of individual proteins ( in the non - polymerized conformation ) belonging to each family illustrate the overall similarity between the proteins . The domains of life where homologs for these proteins have been identified are listed in the first column ( distribution ) , and the properties of filaments made of each protein are listed in the second column ( filament characteristics ) . The tree diagram was modified from Ettema et al . ( 2011 ) . The structures use the following PDB entries : 1J6Z ( actin ) , 5LY3 ( crenactin ) , 4A62 ( ParM ) , 5LJK ( MamK ) and 4CZL ( MreB ) .

In turn , this explains why arcadin - 2 has a different distribu - tion pattern to the other arcadins . Izore´ et al . then went on to show , using X - ray crystallogra - phy , that a fragment of arcadin - 2 encompassing its C - terminal portion folds into a helix and binds to crenactin . The binding site corresponds to a site on actin that is used by eukaryotic proteins involved in disassembling filaments . Further experiments showed that arcadin - 1 interacted very poorly with the individual crenac - tin proteins . However , considering its distribu - tion in the cell , it is still possible that arcadin - 1 prefers to interact with filaments rather than individual proteins . Izore´ et al . report that the structure of arca - din - 1 does not look like any other known protein structure , meaning that it represents a new pro - tein fold . They also note that the primary sequence of arcadin - 2 is unlike that of any actin regulator known to date . This suggests that while the actin cytoskeleton might predate the first eukaryotes , its regulation has been invented independently during evolution . The fact that several , evolutionarily - unrelated proteins use similar mechanisms to fine - tune the polymeriza - tion state of actin provides further support for this idea . All in all , the discoveries of Lo¨we , Izore´ and colleagues highlight the remarkable level of complexity in the cytoskeletons of non - eukar - yotes . Moreover , the continuous development of microbiology guarantees that this picture is going to become ever more complex . Hopefully , these advances will bring us even closer to understanding the evolution of the cytoskeleton .
