Benefits of school reopening must be weighed against the morbidity and mortality risks and the impact of enhancing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . We investigated the effects of school reopening and easing of social - distancing restric - tions on dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infections in Israel between March and July 2020 . Methods . We examined the nationwide age - wise weekly incidence , prevalence , SARS - CoV - 2 polymerase chain reaction tests , their positivity , COVID - 19 hospitalizations , and associated mortality . Temporal differences in these parameters following school re - opening , school ending , and following easing of restrictions such as permission of large - scale gatherings were examined . Results . Incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections gradually increased following school reopening in all age groups , with a significantly higher increase in adults than children . Higher rate ratios ( RRs ) of sample positivity rates 21 – 27 days following school reopening relative to positivity rates prior to openings were found for the age groups 40 – 59 ( RR , 4 . 72 ; 95 % CI , 3 . 26 – 6 . 83 ) and 20 – 39 ( RR , 3 . 37 [ 2 . 51 – 4 . 53 ] ) years , but not for children aged 0 – 9 ( RR , 1 . 46 [ . 85 – 2 . 51 ] ) and 10 – 19 ( RR , . 93 [ . 65 – 1 . 34 ] ) years . No increase was observed in COVID - 19 – associated hospitalizations and deaths following school reopening . In contrast , permission of large - scale gatherings was accompanied by increases in incidence and positivity rates of samples for all age groups , and increased hospitalizations and mortality . Conclusions . This analysis does not support a major role of school reopening in the resurgence of COVID - 19 in Israel . Easing restrictions on large - scale gatherings was the major influence on this resurgence . Keywords . COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; children ; schools ; reopening . While the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic has been controlled in many countries by lockdowns and po - tentially early school closings [ 1 ] , the effect of school closing on reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) spread is less clear [ 2 – 4 ] . Potential reasons in - clude low rates of infection in children [ 5 – 7 ] , less severe symp - toms [ 8 – 10 ] , and lower rates of intrafamily infection than adults [ 11 – 14 ] . Nonetheless , US data suggest that school closure might have prevented up to 128 SARS - CoV - 2 infections per 100 000 population and 1 . 5 fewer deaths per 100 000 population during the lockdown [ 15 ] , and proactive school closures in China might have reduced the peak incidence by 40 – 60 % [ 16 ] . In contrast to the rapidity of closing schools in most coun - tries of the world , reopening has been a challenge in many coun - tries . The benefits of school reopening for students’ academic development , social interactions , social equity , and physical fit - ness are well documented [ 17 ] . Nevertheless , the potential im - pact on public health and economics has tempered widespread reopening of schools [ 17 , 18 ] . Frameworks for reopening of schools have been drafted by international organizations and countries with differing recommendations , reflecting this cur - rent challenge [ 19 – 22 ] . During 2 major waves of COVID - 19 in Israel , in March – July 2020 , schools were closed ( 14 March ) and later partially and finally completely reopened ( 3 May and 17 May , respectively ) . As is routine in Israel , high schools and elementary schools ended the academic year on 19 June and 30 June , respectively . This study examined the dynamics of COVID - 19 resurgence in Israel in light of school re - opening , school ending , and the easing of social restrictions . METHODS Data Sources SARS - CoV - 2 Polymerase Chain Reaction Tests Data on the daily number of tests performed on the populace were obtained from several public national data sources ( the sources of information are detailed in Supplementary Material A ) .

Indications for SARS - CoV - 2 polymerase chain reac - tion ( PCR ) testing are detailed in Supplementary Material A . Population The age - specific breakdown of the Israeli population was obtained from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics [ 24 ] . For purposes of analysis the population was stratified into 2 pedi - atric / adolescent groups aged 0 – 9 and 10 – 19 years and 3 adult groups aged 20 – 39 , 40 – 59 , and 60 years and above , respectively . Relevant Time Periods Time periods related to school closure and openings are out - lined in Supplementary Material C . Learning Conditions and COVID - 19 Epidemiology on School Reopening During the first stage of school reopening ( 3 May 2020 ) , chil - dren were divided into separate groups who attended school at different times on different days . However , these restrictions were lifted on 17 May ; schools were completely reopened re - suming all - day in - person learning with instructions to keep social - distancing rules . Children aged older than 7 years were required to wear masks in classrooms and in public areas . Classmates and teachers of SARS - CoV - 2 – infected pupils or teachers were screened for SARS - CoV - 2 regardless of whether they were symptomatic or asymptomatic . Schools were re - opened following a substantial decrease in the incidence and positivity rates of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests from the peak in COVID - 19 spread observed at the end of March 2020 . Statistical Analysis Temporal trends of the following parameters were examined : the numbers of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests ; the positivity rates of tests and numbers of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID - 19 by age group ; the prevalence in the different age groups ; the daily and weekly incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity ( for the total population and for children separately ) , including in - cidence adjusted for the number of PCR tests ; and the cumula - tive proportions of COVID - 19 cases in children as a proportion of all cases . Adjustment of tests was performed on a weekly basis . For each age group , incidence rate ( weekly number of new cases / 100 000 population of the specific age group ) was multiplied by the proportion of this age group in the general population to the proportion of the samples obtained from in - dividuals of this age group . Data were stratified according to SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test results , age groups , and date of testing . The putative effects of partial and complete school reopening and school ending at the close of the academic year and fol - lowing easing of restrictions on COVID - 19 incidence and positivity rates of tests were examined . These were based on data obtained at days 14 – 20 and 21 – 27 days following the im - plemented measures . Differences in the incidence , prevalence , and positivity rates of tests were analyzed using 2 - proportion z - tests and chi - square tests . Associations with hospitaliza - tions and mortality were examined 14 – 27 and 21 – 34 days , re - spectively , after each measure was instituted . These data were compared with the weekly mortality when each measure was instituted , and also with the weekly number of hospitalized pa - tients and mortality in the prior week . We examined the weekly combined number of hospitalized patients classified as moderately and severely ill . This was in - tended to avoid bias derived from changing definitions of se - verity during the epidemic , and also excluded mildly ill patients who might have been hospitalized not for medical reasons but to ensure appropriate quarantine measures . A lag period of 21 – 34 days between possible exposure and mortality that was based on an average time of 17 days be - tween symptoms and mortality and inclusion of an additional period of 4 – 6 days for a child who was infected in school to infect an adult was used . This period was extended to a lag time of 34 days to account for the possible effect of several rounds of infection . Weekly data were used in order to avoid incidental daily fluc - tuations . Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages . RESULTS The incidence rates , adjusted incidence rates ( incidence rates adjusted for the number of SARS - CoV - 2 tests ) , and preva - lence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection gradually increased following complete school reopening in all age groups ( Figure 1A – C and Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 ) . During this period , the number of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests performed also increased for all age groups , and particularly for the 0 – 9 - and 10 – 19 - year age groups ( 7 . 1 - and 8 . 2 - fold higher than the reference , respectively ) ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 4 ) . Positivity rates of samples in - creased gradually following complete school reopening for the adult age groups but not for pediatric age groups . Positivity rate ratios ( RRs ) of samples obtained 21 – 27 days following school reopening relative to positivity rates prior to openings were as follows : 1 . 46 for children aged 0 – 9 years ( 95 % confidence in - terval [ CI ] , . 85 – 2 . 51 ) , . 93 for children aged 10 – 19 years ( 95 % CI , . 65 – 1 . 34 ) , 3 . 37 for adults aged 20 – 39 years ( 95 % CI , 2 . 51 – 4 . 53 ) , 4 . 72 for adults aged 40 – 59 years ( 95 % CI , 3 . 26 – 6 . 83 ) , and 2 . 75 for adults older than 60 years of age ( 95 % CI , 3 . 26 – 6 . 83 ) . A sim - ilar trend was observed when analyzing data 14 – 21 days fol - lowing reopening ( Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . A single peak of a high rate of SARS - CoV - 2 infections was observed at the end of May 2020 in children aged 10 – 19 years , related to a single cluster of COVID - 19 in a high school in D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c i d / a r t i c l e / 73 / 12 / 2265 / 6103916 b y gue s t on 06 A p r il 2022 Reopening Schools and COVID - 19 Epidemic • cid 2021 : 73 ( 15 december ) • 2267 Figure 1 . A , Prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 , by age . Weekly prevalence rates of COVID - 19 were calculated during March – July 2020 in 4 distinct age groups . For each age group , the number of positive samples was divided by its absolute number in the overall population . Major time points , including school closure , reopening , and school ending at the end of the academic year , as well as easing of social restrictions , are noted . B , Weekly unadjusted incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 , by age . The weekly numbers of SARS - CoV - 2 – positive samples tested during March – July 2020 in the various age groups are shown . The incidence for each age group was calculated per 100 000 population . The “two epidemic waves” of COVID - 19 in Israel are depicted , and the lag of new SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children compared with adults is demonstrated , following school reopenings . Major time points , including school closure , reopening , and school ending at the end of the academic year , as well as easing of social restrictions , are noted . C , Weekly age - group – specific incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 . The weekly numbers of SARS - CoV - 2 – positive samples tested during March – July 2020 were calculated for children ( aged 0 – 9 and 10 – 19 years ) and for adults ( aged 20 – 59 and 60 + years ) , as the number of new weekly SARS - CoV - 2 cases per 100 000 of the specific age - group population . The increase in the proportions of children aged 10 – 19 years infected during the “second wave” is shown .

Continued . Jerusalem [ 25 ] ( Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 1B ) . This resulted in a weekly 6 % sample positivity from May 24 to May 30 in that age group . However , during the 2 subsequent weeks ( 31 May – 13 June ) , the proportions of positive samples in children aged 10 – 19 years were substantially reduced to baseline levels ( 1 . 0 % and 1 . 5 % , respectively ) ( Figure 1E and Supplementary Table 3 ) . Following the identification of the first 2 SARS - CoV - 2 cases in a high school in Jerusalem , the school was closed , quaran - tine instructions were implemented , and all students and staff members were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . No additional mitiga - tion protocols were implemented following the reopening of this school after the outbreak . The source of this outbreak has remained unknown [ 25 ] . Infection rates in the community were similar to the low rates observed prior to school reopening ; however , some increases in incidence rates were noted mainly in adults aged 20 – 59 years ( Figure 1B and 1C ) . Adjusted incidence rate ratios ( aIRRs ) were calculated by comparing the incidence adjusted for the number of SARS - CoV - 2 tests performed during the 14 – 20 and 21 – 28 days following complete school reopening with the adjusted inci - dence during the week prior to reopening . The aIRRs increased for all age groups , but mostly in adults . ( Figure 2A and 2B and Tables 1 and 2 ) The increase in aIRR 14 – 20 days following re - opening was most prominent in individuals aged 40 – 59 ( aIRR , 6 . 22 ; 95 % CI , 3 . 6 – 10 . 7 ) and 20 – 39 ( aIRR , 5 . 25 [ 3 . 5 – 7 . 8 ] ) years . The smallest increase was observed in children aged 0 – 9 ( aIRR , 2 . 2 [ 1 . 56 – 3 . 11 ] ) and 10 – 19 ( aIRR , 1 . 29 [ . 94 – 1 . 76 ] ) years . Higher aIRRs were also demonstrated in adults compared with children 21 – 28 days following school reopening ( Figure 2B and Tables 1 and 2 ) . Increases in all the above - mentioned parameters ( eg , inci - dence , prevalence , number of samples tested , and their posi - tivity rates ) were observed for all age groups after school ending at the close of the academic year ( Figure 1A – C , Figure 2C , and Supplementary Table 5 ) . It should be mentioned that school endings occurred in conjunction with the relaxation of social restrictions . The highest increments following school ending were in children aged 10 – 19 years ( Supplementary Table 5 ) .

Following easing of social restrictions undertaken on 20 May ( Supplementary Figure 2 , Supplementary Material C ) , RRs to in - creased SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity test rates were initially similar to those of school reopening ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . However , following the lifting of restrictions on large - scale gatherings on 12 June , increased RRs , aIRRs , and positivity rates were observed in all age groups ( Figure 2A and 2B and Tables 1 and 2 ) The weekly number of hospitalizations and fatal cases in pa - tients with COVID - 19 did not increase following partial and complete school reopening ( Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 , Tables 3 and 4 , Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 ) . The lack of in - creased mortality was observed even up to 49 days following school reopening ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . In contrast , the weekly number of COVID - 19 fatal cases significantly in - creased following high school and elementary school ending for summer vacation ( Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 3 ) . Risk ratios were 15 . 2 ( 5 . 5 – 41 . 9 ) and 17 . 2 ( 6 . 3 – 47 . 3 ) following 28 – 34 days of each measure , respectively . A significant increase in mortality was also observed following a lag time of 21 days ( Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 3 ) . No significant increases in mortality and hospitalizations were observed following par - tial easing of social restrictions on 20 May ( Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 ) . However , a significant increase in hospitaliza - tions ( rate ratio , 3 . 95 ; 95 % CI , 3 . 2 – 4 . 8 ) and in mortality ( risk ratio , 4 [ 1 . 9 – 8 . 3 ] ) occurred at 21 – 28 days and 28 – 34 days , re - spectively , following the permission to attend large - scale social events . A significant increase in hospitalizations and mortality was also observed following a lag time of 14 and 21 days , re - spectively ( Tables 3 and 4 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 ) . There were no fatalities among SARS - CoV - 2 – infected children during the study period . DISCUSSION National data from Israel suggest that school reopening during May 2020 had a limited effect on SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate in children and adults , and that it was Table 1 .

On the other hand , this analysis suggests that easing of restrictions on large - scale gatherings may have been related to the resurgence of the COVID - 19 epi - demic in Israel and may explain the observed increased mortality . The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection increased grad - ually in all age groups following complete school reopening . Due to the high proportion of asymptomatic and mildly symp - tomatic cases , any analysis of COVID - 19 incidence must con - sider the number of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests performed . In contrast to the above , school reopening during May 2020 did not have a significant impact on the positivity rates in chil - dren and adolescents . These age groups had the lowest RRs for increased COVID - 19 – positive rates as well as the lowest aIRRs compared with the weeks before opening . On the other hand , adults in the 40 – 59 - and 20 – 39 - year age groups had the highest RRs and aIRRs . A single - day surge in positivity rates of children aged 10 – 19 years , due to a cluster in a Jerusalem high school [ 25 ] , constituted the only exception to this trend . This outbreak could be at least partially related to the temporary lift of restric - tions on wearing masks from 19 to 22 May in classrooms and in open spaces in the absence of additional mitigation protocols . However , this cluster was followed by a drop in the positivity rate in this age group to a lower rate than was observed during the period preceding school reopening . This negative association led us to explore the other well - es - tablished potential role of lifting social - distancing restrictions on the epidemic curve . We found that easing of restrictions related to large - scale gatherings was temporally followed by significantly increased incidence and positivity rates of samples taken from all age groups . This was followed by significant increases both in the number of patients hospitalized in moderate to severe condi - tion and in mortality following a lag period . Also , individuals aged 20 – 59 years , and not children , seem to have the leading role in the increasing numbers of COVID - 19 infections following school reopening . These findings contrast to those seen in influenza epidemics , in which children had a leading role and their relative risk of infection was higher than that of adults [ 26 , 27 ] . Nevertheless , school reopening should be accompanied by efforts to reduce crowding and to imple - ment appropriate infection - control practices in the classroom [ 17 , 21 ] . In addition , schools should probably reopen only when the SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic is under control . The rates of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among children in Israel are high compared with those reported in other countries . As of 31 July 2020 , the proportions of children aged 0 – 9 and 10 – 19 years infected with SARS - CoV - 2 in Israel were 9 . 5 % and 19 % , respectively [ 23 ] . The respective proportions of these age groups in the total population are 19 % and 16 % [ 24 ] . In comparison , according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) report , as of 26 July , children made up 4 % of cases detected in the European Union / European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom [ 28 ] ; US data demonstrate that the number of COVID - 19 cases in children younger than 18 years has reached 10 % of the total for US cases and this age group consists of 22 % of the population [ 29 ] . The increased SARS - CoV - 2 testing in Israel following re - opening of schools may account for some of the discrepancy be - tween the countries . Another possible explanation for the high proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 detection rates in the 0 - to 19 - year population in Israel is the high person - to - room ratio among populations with disproportionately high rates of SARS - CoV - 2 detection , such as ultraorthodox Jews and Arabs . In addition , young people in Israel , including children , tend to have high degrees of social interaction , which contributes to the high rate of infection . However , it seems that school attendance per se does not seem to have been a significant explanation for this finding since the relative proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 – infected children out of the total SARS - CoV - 2 cases has not increased during school weeks and did not decrease during school ending . In the Israeli model of school reopening , all the students were admitted to schools simultaneously . This is in contrast to school openings in Northern Europe where class sizes were limited and teachers were assigned to 1 class at a time whenever possible [ 30 ] . Clearly , SARS - CoV - 2 did spread in classes and schools in Israel , but this does not seem to have been the major cause for the June – July resurgence in Israel . Our findings regarding the seeming lack of a relation between school reopening during May 2020 and the surge in cases in the community are in agree - ment with the experience in several countries worldwide [ 17 , 31 – 35 ] . and with a recent ECDC perspective [ 27 ] . Probably one of the major factors that contributed to the unsubstantial effect of school reopening on COVID - 19 resurgence during June – July 2020 was that on May 2020 the epidemic was under control with a low incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections among all age groups . Our analysis did not demonstrate any mitigating effect of school ending at the close of academic year on all the param - eters examined . Apparently , school closure may reduce the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infection mainly when combined with a lockdown , as recently described [ 15 ] . On the other hand , in the absence of a lockdown , children may contract infection during regular and casual social encounters outside schools , while at school , children are expected to be super - vised and infection - control measures are encouraged and can be enforced . The physical conditions in schools in Israel , which are more crowded than most Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development countries , and the lack of cohorting that ac - companied full reopening of schools suggest that even under these conditions that would promote the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c i d / a r t i c l e / 73 / 12 / 2265 / 6103916 b y gue s t on 06 A p r il 2022 2274 • cid 2021 : 73 ( 15 december ) • Somekh et al spread of the virus was not an important factor in the resur - gence . These results thus might be translated to other countries where there is cohorting and less classroom crowding . The main limitation of our study is its ecological design and the possibility that some findings presented here may have been related to other concurrent interventions . Due to the obser - vational design , this study cannot inform causal relationships . Since the demographic , cultural , and socioeconomic features of Israel evidently affect our results , particular attention should be given to such factors in assessing reopening in specific geo - graphic areas . Another limitation is that the indication for testing may af - fect the unadjusted incidence among specific age groups . In ad - dition , even incidence adjusted by the number of samples tested could be affected by the testing policies . For these reasons , we examined the putative effects of school reopening and other nonpharmacologic measures by several analyses , namely , incidence adjusted by the number of tests , positivity rates of samples , weekly number of SARS - CoV - 2 – related hospitaliza - tions , and weekly number of deaths . The main strength of our study is that it is based on a solid and reliable national database and that its main findings are supported by several lines of evidence , as previously men - tioned . In addition , we have used several time periods after each measure examined to increase the sensitivity of the study and to strengthen the reliability of the results . In conclusion , our findings suggest that school reopening did not have a substantial effect on the SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion rate in the general population and suggest a major effect of easing of social restrictions on the COVID - 19 resurgence in Israel . Although complete reopening of schools may have contributed to the spread of infection , it does not seem to have played a primary role per se in the June – July 2020 resurgence . Table 4 .
