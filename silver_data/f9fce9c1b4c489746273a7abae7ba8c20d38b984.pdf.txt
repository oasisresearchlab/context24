Two prominent characteristics of epithelial cells , apical - basal polarity and a highly ordered cytoskeleton , depend on the existence of precisely localized protein complexes associated with the apical plasma membrane 1 , 2 , and on a separate machinery that regulates the spatial order of actin assembly 3 . ERM ( ezrin , radixin , moesin ) proteins have been proposed to link transmem - brane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton 4 in the apical domain , suggesting a structural role in epithelial cells , and they have been implicated in signalling pathways 5 . Here , we show that the sole Drosophila ERM protein Moesin functions to promote cortical actin assembly and apical - basal polarity . As a result , cells lacking Moesin lose epithelial characteristics and adopt invasive migratory behaviour . Our data demonstrate that Moesin facili - tates epithelial morphology not by providing an essential struc - tural function , but rather by antagonizing activity of the small GTPase Rho . Thus , Moesin functions in maintaining epithelial integrity by regulating cell - signalling events that affect actin organization and polarity . Furthermore , our results show that there is negative feedback between ERM activation and activity of the Rho pathway . ERM proteins , highly related members of the larger protein 4 . 1 superfamily , can exist in an active or inactive conformation 4 . The inactive conformation is brought about by head - to - tail interactions between the FERM ( four - point - one , ERM ) domain and the carboxy terminus . In this state , ERM actin - binding and membrane associa - tion sites are not accessible . A conformational change induced by Rho pathway activation produces the active ERM form . ERM proteins bind actin and cell - type - dependent transmembrane pro - teins such as CD44 , CD43 and several I - CAMs . Genetic tests of hypotheses regarding ERM protein involvement in signalling and cytoskeletal support have been impeded by functional redundancies between these three proteins in mammals . In contrast , Drosophila has only one ERM gene , Moesin 6 , 7 , enabling us to perform such analyses . To test Moesin function in vivo , we identiﬁed a transposable element insertion in the Moesin gene , P { lacW } l (cid:133) 1 (cid:134) G0323 ( Sup - plementary Fig . 1a ) . Males hemizygous for this insertion display late larval lethality . This lethality can be rescued by a duplication of region 8B , Dp ( 1 ; Y ) 619 , as well as by a complementary DNA - based Moesin (cid:135) transgene ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Taken together , these results indicate that l ( 1 ) G0323 disrupts Moesin function but does not affect any other essential genes , and is hereafter referred to as Moe G0323 . To determine the extent to which Moesin function is disrupted by this allele , we examined Moesin protein level and distribution in Moe G0323 mutants . Moesin protein is not detected in imaginal discs from Moe G0323 hemizygous larvae by immunoﬂuorescence ( Fig . 1d ) or immunoblotting ( Supplementary Fig . 2 , lane 4 ) . Furthermore , animals trans - heterozygous for the Moe G0323 allele and a deﬁciency of the 8B region , Df ( 1 ) lz - 90b24 , display the same lethal period and have phenotypes identical to Moe G0323 hemizygous and homozy - gous mutant larvae ( data not shown ) , establishing that Moe G0323 is genetically null . To investigate Moesin function in the morphogenesis of epithelial structures we examined the imaginal discs from Moe G0323 hemi - zygous larvae . In wild - type epithelial cells , ﬁlamentous actin associ - ates with the cell cortex and accumulates in the apical domain ( Fig . 1a , arrow ) , where it largely coincides with Moesin ( Fig . 1b , arrow ) . In Moe G0323 cells , F - actin undergoes a marked redistribu - tion : it accumulates in ectopic sites within cells ( Fig . 1c , e , ﬁlled arrowheads ) and becomes depleted from the apical region . To demonstrate that actin is reduced in the apical domain , we expressed a Moe (cid:135) transgene only in the posterior compartment of the mutant disc , generating a ‘half - rescued’disc . The rescued cells in the posterior compartment ( Fig . 1e , f , open arrowheads ) have a wild - type phenotype , and have signiﬁcantly more ﬁlamentous actin in the apical domain than adjacent Moe G0323 cells ( Fig . 1e , arrow ) . The imaginal epithelium normally consists of a single layer of tall columnar cells with an obvious apical - basal polarity ( Fig . 2a – d ) . In Moe G0323 imaginal discs , many cells are situated basal to the epithelial monolayer ( Fig . 2e – h , open arrowheads ) . These cells do not express the junctional marker E - Cadherin ( Fig . 2g ) or other epithelial polarity markers , including a - Catenin , Coracle , Crumbs or Discs lost ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that in Moe G0323 organisms , epithelial cells lose intercellular junctions and epithelial letters to nature NATURE | VOL 421 | 2 JANUARY 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 83 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup polarity , and are extruded basally from the epithelium . To determine whethercells lacking Moesin not only lose epithelial morphology but also adopt migratory behaviour , we marked a subset of cells within the imaginal epithelium by expressing green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) under control of the region - speciﬁc patched - Gal4 driver . In a wild - type wing imaginal disc , marked cells stay within a continuous stripe along the anterior - posterior boundary ( Fig . 3a ) . In a Moe G0323 disc , cells expressing GFP under control of patched - Gal4 are found away from the stripe ( Fig . 3d , arrowheads ) , suggesting that these cells have dispersed . Further - more , these cells are able to invade adjacent regions of the disc comprising cells that still retain epithelial morphology ( Fig . 3c , d , arrow ) . Thus , Moe G0323 cells not only lose epithelial markers and intercellular adhesion , but also become motile and show invasive behaviour , suggesting that cells lacking Moesin undergo an epi - thelial - to - mesenchymal transition . Rho - induced phosphorylation of a C - terminal threonine has been shown to relieve the inhibitory intramolecular association and generate the active conformation of the ERM molecule 8 – 10 . This residue is conserved in Drosophila Moesin at amino acid position 559 ( ref . 7 ) . To test the role of Thr 559 phosphorylation in Moesin activation , we generated two mutant cDNA constructs : Moe ( T559D ) , a phosphomimetic form , and Moe ( T559A ) , a form that cannot be phosphorylated at this residue . Moe G0323 hemizy - gous males are rescued to viability by transgenes expressing Moe ( T559D ) , but not by Moe ( T559A ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , Figure 2 Loss of Moesin and overexpression of Rho1 cause loss of apical - basal polarity .

This result contrasts with a recent report 11 , possibly reﬂecting differences in how these constructs were tagged . The phosphomimetic form of ERM proteins has constitutively active properties because it may be locked in the open confor - mation 12 . To examine the effects of ERM activation , we over - expressed Moe ( T559D ) under region - speciﬁc Gal4 drivers in wild - type imaginal discs . We observed a marked upregulation of cortical F - actin in cells that express Moe ( T559D ) ( Fig . 1g , h ; the arrow points to the boundary of expression ) . By contrast , little or no effect was seen with Moe (cid:135) and Moe ( T559A ) overexpression ( data not shown ) . The accumulation of cortical actin induced by the gain - of - function mutant is complementary to the reduction of apical actin seen in the Moesin loss - of - function background , indicating that Moesin controls assembly of cortical actin . The pleiotropic nature of the Moe G0323 phenotype suggests an involvement in a signalling pathway that controls cell adhesion and motility . Given the crucial function carried out by the Rho family of small GTPases in regulating these processes 13 and the evidence for Rho regulation of ERM function 9 , 14 , 15 we next examined the relationship between Moesin and Rho signalling in vivo by manipu - lating the genetic dose of Rho1 , a Drosophila RhoA homologue , in a Moe 2 background . The null Rho1 72R allele 16 was used to reduce by half maternal and zygotic Rho function . We observed that halving the dose of Rho1 not only ameliorated the Moe G0323 disc epithelium organization and actin localization phenotypes ( Fig . 4c ) , but also strongly suppressed Moe G0323 lethality ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . A similar suppression of lethality was observed with other Rho1 alleles and when the dose of Drok , a Rho effector kinase 17 , was reduced , and a weaker effect was observed with another downstream effector of Rho1 signalling , the non - muscle myosin - II heavy chain gene zipper 17 , 18 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We determined that the observed suppression was not due to enhanced Moesin protein production or stability ( Supplementary Fig 2 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Moesin functions antagonistically to activity of the Rho pathway in regulating epithelial polarity and integrity . We examined the ultrastructure of wild - type and Moe G0323 epithelial cells as well as that of Moe G0323 cells that are also heterozygous for Rho1 72R . In transmission electron micrographs , wild - type epithelial cells have apical ﬁnger - like microvilli that tend to congregate near the areas of contact between adjacent cells ( Fig . 4d , arrows ) . In the Moesin mutant , the microvilli are replaced by large apical protrusions ( Fig . 4e , arrows ) that are often of irregular shape . Reduction of Rho activity partially suppresses this Moe 2 phenotype , and results in cells that lack the protrusions but still display abnormally large microvillus - like structures ( Fig . 4f , arrows ) . These results suggest that Moesin may have a Rho - independent role in maintaining apical integrity that is not essential for viability . If Moesin normally functions as an antagonist of Rho pathway activity , then the effects of Rho pathway hyperactivation should be similar to the Moe loss - of - function phenotype . To test this hypoth - esis , we investigated whether Rho1 overexpression phenotypes in wing imaginal discs mimic those seen in Moe loss - of - function mutants . Cells overexpressing Rho1 mislocalize F - actin ( Fig . 1i , arrowhead ) and lose epithelial characteristics . As with Moe G0323 cells , Rho1 - expressing cells in the blade region of the wing imaginal disc lose junctional markers and drop basally ( Fig . 2i – l , open arrowheads ) . These cells also assume a mesenchymal character , becomemotile andinvade betweenwild - typeepithelial cells ( Fig . 3e , f , arrows ) . Similar , but more disruptive phenotypes were observed when a constitutively active form of Rho1 , Rho1 V14 , was over - expressed in wild - type imaginal discs ( data not shown ) . Therefore , Rho1 overexpression strongly resembles Moe loss of function , Figure 3 Loss of Moesin and overexpression of Rho1 induce invasive migratory cellular behaviour .

To test further the relationship of Moesin with the Rho pathway , we investigated whether a reduction in Moe function would sup - press a phenotype associated with downregulation of Rho1 . Pre - vious studies have shown that Rho1 functions downstream of dishevelled ( dsh ) in the planar cell polarity ( PCP ) pathway that regulates the polarity and number of hairs generated by each wing blade cell 16 , 17 . Each wild - type wing cell produces a single hair ( Fig . 4g ) ; however , multiple wing hairs result when Rho pathway function is impaired 16 . In ﬂies that are mutant for the dsh 1 allele , which inactivates the PCP but not the wingless - signalling function of dishevelled , we found double - hair - producing cells at a frequency of 6 . 3 ^ 1 . 0 % ( Fig . 4h ) , consistent with previous results 17 . Removal of a single dose of Moe suppressed the number of cells with double hairs in dsh 1 mutants to 1 . 2 ^ 0 . 2 % ( Fig . 4i ) , suggesting that Rho pathway function is upregulated in response to reduction in Moesin activity . Our genetic results in Drosophila suggest that Moesin functions antagonistically to Rho pathway activity . To distinguish between an effect on Rho itself and effects on a downstream component of the pathway , and to extend our results from Drosophila to mammalian cells , we examined the effect of reducing ERM function in mam - malian LLC - PK1 epithelial cells . We made use of an ERM trunca - tion , ezrin D Act , that has dominant - negative properties in ﬂies and reduces function of all three ERM proteins in these cells ( as assayed by phospho - ERM staining , a marker for ERM activation 19 ; data not shown ) . Expression of ezrin D Act resulted in increased levels of Rho activity , whereas expression of wild - type ezrin caused either no effect , or slightly decreased the level of Rho activity ( Fig . 4j ) . These results indicated that ERM proteins negatively regulate Rho path - way function by altering the activation state of Rho itself , rather than a downstream component of the pathway . The phenotypic analysis presented here clearly demonstrates that Moesin function is required to maintain apical - basal polarity , epithelial integrity , and correct actin distribution . This is consistent with Moesin’s association with the apical membrane in epithelial cells and the ability to bind ﬁlamentous actin 7 , 20 . Our results also show that Moesin promotes epithelial morphology by functioning antagonistically to Rho pathway activity , rather than by providing structural linkage between the plasma membrane and the cyto - skeleton . Moe 2 defects , including lethality , are strongly suppressed when Rho pathway activity is reduced , suggesting that Moesin does not have essential structural functions . Furthermore , we have shown that the diverse Moe 2 phenotypes—decreased cortical actin accumulation , loss of epithelial polarity , and acquisition of migratory cell behaviour—can all be attributed to increased Rho pathway activity . Consistent with this model for Moesin function , increased Rho activity has been linked to invasive and metastatic phenotypes in mammalian epithelial cells 13 . Because ERM proteins are known downstream effectors of Rho signalling , our results further suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop between ERM proteins and the Rho pathway . This negative feedback mecha - nism may be important in inhibiting migratory and invasive cellular behaviours that characterize metastatic cells . Our results with mammalian epithelial cells suggest that the effect of ERM function on Rho signalling occurs upstream to or at the level of Rho itself . Previous studies have detected direct binding between ERM proteins and two known regulators of Rho function , RhoGDI ( Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor ) 21 and Dbl GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho ) 22 . Although one of these studies suggested that ERM proteins function to promote Rho activation in vitro 21 , the in vivo signiﬁcance of these interactions has not yet been examined . Elucidation of the functional signiﬁcance of these interactions may be essential to the further understanding of the relationship between ERM proteins and Rho pathway activity . Of note , the proposed negative feedback loop between ERM and Rho parallels the antagonistic relationship between the ERM - related tumour suppressor Merlin and another Rho - family GTPase Rac 23 , and suggests that ERM and Merlin may have similar roles in regulating Rho - family signalling . A Methods Drosophila cultures and crosses w 1118 was used for wild - type controls and for the transformation of UAS constructs . The following stocks were given as gifts : MS109 - Gal4 ( S .

Protein synthesis takes place on the ribosome , where genetic information carried by messenger RNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids . This process is terminated when a stop codon moves into the ribosomal decoding centre ( DC ) and is recognized by a class - 1 release factor ( RF ) . RFs have a conserved GGQ amino - acid motif , which is crucial for peptide release and is believed to interact directly with the peptidyl - transferase centre ( PTC ) of the 50S ribosomal subunit 1 , 2 . Another conserved motif of RFs ( SPF in RF2 ) has been proposed to interact directly with stop codons in the DC of the 30S subunit 3 . The distance between the DC and PTC is , 73 A˚ . However , in the X - ray structure of RF2 , SPF and GGQ are only 23 A˚ apart 4 , indicating that they cannot be at DC and PTC simultaneously . Here we show that RF2 is in an open conformation when bound to the ribosome , allowing GGQ to reach the PTC while still allowing SPF – stop - codon interaction . The results indicate new interpretations of accuracy in termin - ation , and have implications for how the presence of a stop codon in the DC is signalled to PTC . A highly efﬁcient in vitro system for bacterial protein synthesis was used to generate a release complex ( RC ) containing ribosomes with a UAA stop codon in the A site and fMet - Phe - Thr - Ile – tRNA Ile in the P site 5 . To study the interaction of the RC with RF2 before and after peptide release , we obtained two types of complex : ( 1 ) by reacting wild - type RF2 ( RF2 ( wt ) ) with RC , in which case the peptide was rapidly removed ; ( 2 ) by reacting a mutant RF2 ( RF2 ( GAQ ) ) with RC , in which case the peptide release by RF2 was inhibited . RF2 ( GAQ ) was derived by changing the second glycine residue in the conserved GGQ motif to alanine . This mutation slows down peptide release drastically , but leaves other interactions between factor and ribosome unchanged 2 . Cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) maps depicting the RC bound to RF2 ( GAQ ) ( Fig . 1a ) and to RF2 ( wt ) ( Fig . 1b ) were obtained at resolutions of 10 . 9 A˚ and 12 . 8 A˚ , respectively . The cryo - maps ( Fig . 1a and b ) revealed the presence of an electron density attributable to RF2 . We see RF2 as a mass in the intersubunit space extending from the DC on the 30S subunit to the PTC on the 50S subunit . There is also extra density in the region of the L7 / L12 stalk base of the large subunit that contains the GTPase - associated centre ( GAC ) 6 . Apart from a small change in the density directed towards the PTC ( Fig . 1c and d ) , the open , tri - lobed shape of RF2 and its position on the ribosome are the same for the mutant ( Fig . 1c ) and wild - type ( Fig . 1d ) factors . The open , tri - lobed shape of the RF2 cryo - EM density before ( Fig . 1c ) and after ( Fig . 1d ) peptide release is markedly different from the compact shape of the X - ray structure of RF2 ( ref . 4 ; letters to nature NATURE | VOL 421 | 2 JANUARY 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 87 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup
