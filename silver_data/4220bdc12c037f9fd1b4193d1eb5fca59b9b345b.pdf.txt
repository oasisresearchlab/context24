It is now clear that these infiltrat - ing macrophages have distinct functions from resident microglia and are capable of mediating both harmful and beneficial effects after injury . These divergent effects have been largely attributed to environmental cues , such as specific cytokines , that influence the macrophage polarization state . In this review , we also consider the possibility that different macrophage origins , including the spleen , bone marrow , and local self - renewal , may also affect macrophage fate , and ultimately their function that contribute to the complex pathobiology of spinal cord injury . Keywords Leukocytes · Inflammation · Myeloid cells · Wound healing · Glial and fibrotic scar · Regeneration · Peripheral · Systemic Origin of monocyte‑derived macrophages in the injured spinal cord Splenic versus bone marrow‑derived macrophages Circulating monocytes are blood mononuclear phagocytes with the potential to differentiate into macrophages and / or dendritic cells upon infiltration into the injured CNS . Injured tissue releases cytokines and chemokines into circulation that serve as chemoattractants for circulating monocytes . Monocytes migrate to the injury site and differentiate into macrophages in a multiphasic manner , where they perform multiple functions involved in the wound healing process . The first wave starts around 3 days after injury and reaches a peak at around 7 days . After a slight decline , the second wave begins at 14 days , peaks again at 60 days , and main - tains this level until at least 180 days after injury [ 2 , 18 ] . Humans follow a similar temporal pattern acutely , but it is not known whether humans also display a second wave of macrophages [ 21 ] . Mouse monocytes can be generally classified into Ly6C hi and Ly6C lo subtypes , although Ly6C middle is also used . Ly6C hi monocytes are also Cx3Cr1 lo and CCR2 hi , and considered to be phagocytic and pro - inflammatory . Ly6C lo monocytes are Cx3Cr1 hi and CCR2 lo , and considered to be anti - inflammatory [ 24 , 102 ] . Previous SCI studies on Cx3Cr1 GFP mice have demonstrated the presence of both Cx3Cr1 lo and Cx3Cr1 hi macrophages at the injury site , indi - cating that both pro - inflammatory Ly6C hi , and anti - inflam - matory Ly6C lo monocytes contribute to the macrophage population after SCI ( discussed in more detail below ) [ 17 , 107 ] . Alternatively , either the Ly6C hi or the Ly6C lo mono - cytes could give rise to both pro - and anti - inflammatory macrophages at the injury site . While the bone marrow was once thought to be the only source of these monocytes , the spleen is now recognized as a major monocyte reservoir during the acute injury phase in many organ systems . Using a mouse model of myocar - dial infarction , Swirsky et al . [ 94 ] calculated that the num - ber of circulating monocytes derived from bone marrow could not fully account for the number of macrophages at the injury site . Their investigation into alternative sources of monocytes led to the identification of a population of Lindsay M . Milich and Christine B . Ryan contributed equally to this manuscript . * Jae K .

These splenic monocytes had both Ly6C hi and Ly6C lo subtypes that were similar in proportion to those in blood . After splenectomy , the number of pro - inflamma - tory Ly6C hi monocytes at the site of myocardium infarct decreased by about 75 % by 1 day after injury , while the number of anti - inflammatory Ly6C lo monocytes remained unchanged , implicating the spleen as the major source of the pro - inflammatory subtype . These results give the impres - sion that the pro - inflammatory characteristic is intrinsic to splenic macrophages however , it should be noted that tumor - associated macrophages , which are pro - regenerative , also arise from the spleen [ 11 ] , indicating a complex interplay between splenic macrophages and the tissue microenviron - ment that finally determines the phenotype . Similar results have been reported in many tissues , including the spinal cord . After splenectomy , there is a sig - nificant decrease in the number of macrophages present at the injury site during the first week after SCI [ 3 ] . Whether these macrophages are derived from the pro - inflammatory Ly6C hi monocyte subtype is not known , but splenectomized mice displayed improved locomotor recovery chronically after SCI . Pharmacological depletion of monocytes using liposome - encapsulated clodronate has shown similar results in multiple independent studies [ 36 , 47 , 73 ] . However , it should be noted that liposome - encapsulated clodronate also affects monocytes in the bone marrow [ 100 ] , so its effects cannot be isolated to the spleen . An interesting and poten - tially important observation is that even after a splenectomy , macrophages start to reappear at the injury site , and over time the number of macrophages is similar to non - splenec - tomized animals [ 3 ] . This indicates another source of mac - rophages , such as the bone marrow , and raises the interesting possibility that the benefits observed after splenectomy or other methods of acute macrophage depletion could be due to repopulation of the injury site by anti - inflammatory , pro - regenerative macrophages from the bone marrow , in addi - tion to depletion of pro - inflammatory macrophages from the spleen . Accordingly , under resting conditions , primary splenic macrophages produce higher levels of pro - inflam - matory cytokines , such as TNF , IL - 6 and IL - 12 , than bone marrow - derived macrophages [ 97 ] . The observation of macrophage repopulation after sple - nectomy is consistent with previous findings of macrophage infiltration occurring in a multiphasic manner ( in rodents ) as described above . Interestingly , preventing the late phase of macrophage infiltration via C5a receptor inhibition worsens locomotor recovery , suggesting that this later macrophage population is beneficial to functional recovery [ 2 ] . The source of this late wave of macrophages is unknown , but could be of same origin as macrophages that repopulate the injury site after splenectomy as mentioned above . Whether this popula - tion originates from the bone marrow remains to be tested , but the different contributions of macrophages from differ - ent origins could provide important insight into identification of novel therapeutic interventions that target distinct mac - rophages populations . Self‑renewal of macrophages Macrophages persist chronically at the injury site in both rodents and humans [ 21 ] . This long timespan raises the question of their turnover rate and origin at various stages of injury progression . Although circulating monocytes have a lifespan of 1 – 3 days , monocyte - derived macrophages typi - cally have a lifespan of several weeks [ 37 ] , which means that macrophages must be somehow replenished in disorders such as SCI in which macrophages persist for years . The traditional view holds that since circulating monocytes terminally dif - ferentiate into macrophages , turnover of macrophages must depend on new monocyte influx . However , accumulating evidence indicates that local proliferation of macrophages at the injury site may also significantly contribute to the total population . In a model of peritonitis , proliferation of both resident and monocyte - derived macrophages contributes to the macrophage expansion [ 14 ] . Local proliferation , rather than monocyte recruitment , also seems to be the major mech - anism of accumulation of tumor - associated macrophages in a mouse model of spontaneous mammary carcinogenesis [ 96 ] . Similarly , continuous administration of BrdU labels nearly all macrophages in 4 weeks in a mouse model of atheroscle - rosis , and this turnover kinetics is not altered after monocyte depletion or parabiosis , suggesting that monocyte recruitment cannot fully account for the number of macrophages in an atherosclerotic lesion [ 81 ] . Although local macrophage proliferation needs to be exper - imentally confirmed in spinal cord injury in the future , sev - eral independent reports in multiple disease models discussed above make it highly probable that it also contributes to the maintained presence of macrophages chronically after spinal cord injury . This raises the possibility that the repopulation of macrophages after splenectomy and / or the second wave of macrophage accumulation mentioned above could have significant contributions from local proliferation rather than , or in addition to , infiltration of monocytes from peripheral organs . If local proliferation , rather than monocyte infiltration , is the predominant mechanism behind macrophage renewal at the injury site , this could have important implications on how macrophage - targeting therapeutics are delivered after spinal cord injury . 787 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 Macrophage fate in the injured spinal cord Spatiotemporal distribution of macrophages Resolving the spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage infiltration is complicated by the presence of microglia . Due to the phenotypic and antigenic similarities between microglia and macrophages , it is difficult to differentiate between these two populations . Flow cytometry can distin - guish between CD45 hi / CD11b + macrophages and CD45 lo / CD11b + microglia on a population level , but this method does not provide information on spatial distribution . Many studies have used expression levels of certain antigens to experimentally differentiate between both populations . For example , it has been reported that resident microglia express the chemokine receptor Cx3Cr1 to a much higher degree than macrophages , while macrophages have a higher expression level of CD45 and Mac - 2 ( galectin - 3 ) than microglia [ 26 ] . In addition , lysM - eGFP and Ccr2 - RFP mutant mice specifically label macrophages rather than microglia [ 57 , 84 ] . One of the first studies to address the spatial distribution of macrophages used bone marrow chimeric mice with a Cx3Cr1 GFP donor and wildtype host , resulting in a model in which GFP is expressed in bone marrow - derived mye - loid cells . The authors demonstrated that GFP + cells were present mostly surrounding the GFAP - negative fibrotic injury center , thus concluding that the CD11b + / GFP − cells in the injury center were microglia , whereas the GFP + cells in the surrounding region were macrophages [ 82 , 90 ] . However , these studies failed to account for the fact pro - inflammatory Ly6C hi macrophages express low levels of Cx3Cr1 . Later studies using multiple chimeric models addressed this issue and demonstrated that macrophages occupy both the fibrotic lesion center as well as the sur - rounding glial scar regions , whereas microglia are present almost exclusively in the glial scar region [ 17 , 99 , 107 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Interestingly , the Cx3Cr1 GFP chimera studies clearly show the presence of both Cx3Cr1 hi and Cx3Cr1 lo macrophages at the injury site with different spatial distri - bution ; Cx3Cr1 hi macrophages are present in neural tissue that is characterized by the glial scar , whereas Cx3Cr1 lo macrophages are present in the non - neural tissue char - acterized by the fibrotic scar . Whether these two popula - tions represent anti - inflammatory M2 - like macrophages ( i . e . , Ly6C lo / Cx3Cr1 hi ) and pro - inflammatory M1 - like macrophages ( i . e . , Ly6C hi / Cx3Cr1 lo ) remains a possi - bility to be tested . The fact that Cx3Cr1 lo and Cx3Cr1 hi macrophages occupy distinct regions of the injury site ( fibrotic and glial scar regions , respectively ) suggests that the local environment could be driving the macrophage phenotype , or that these macrophage subtypes drive distinct physiological processes ( i . e . , fibrosis vs gliosis ) . Alternatively , these two types of macrophages could have differential attraction to the glial and fibrotic scar regions . Macrophage polarization spectrum The M1 / M2 macrophage classification system was originally defined in a seminal study by Mills et al . [ 58 ] where the authors investigated fundamental differences in activation of macrophages from different strain of common inbred mice . Using primary cultures of resident peritoneal macrophages from mice that typically display a Th1 response ( C57BL / 6 and B10D2 mice ) or a Th2 response ( Balb / C and DBA / 2 mice ) in response to infection , the authors demonstrated that macrophages from Th1 strains , but not Th2 strains , were readily activated by IFNγ or LPS . Activation of Th2 strain macrophages required both IFNγ and LPS . Macrophage acti - vation was measured by metabolism of arginine into nitric oxide , which is iNOS dependent , or ornithine , which is argi - nase dependent . Thus , macrophages from Th1 strains were labeled M1 macrophages characterized by iNOS activity , and those from Th2 strains were labeled M2 macrophages characterized by arginase activity . This M1 / M2 nomen - clature was soon adopted by the scientific community as a binary classification in a large wave of ensuing publications . However , it is now recognized that macrophage polarization state is more of a continuum between M1 and M2 [ 56 ] , but it should be noted that Mills et al . explicitly stated in their original manuscript that “there may be a continuum of phe - notypes between M1 and M2 macrophages” . The observation that M1 - like macrophages can kill nearby cells and prevent cellular proliferation , whereas M2 - like macrophages can promote cell proliferation and tissue growth [ 59 ] led to the hypothesis that promoting M2 - like polarization would be beneficial in CNS injuries , such as SCI , where cellular regeneration is limited . The first study to define M1 / M2 macrophages in the injured spinal cord was by Kigerl et al . [ 38 ] , which reported that , other than the temporary presence of M2 macrophages during the first 7 days , the SCI site is comprised predominantly of M1 macrophages . In addition , the authors used in vitro BMDM ( bone marrow - derived macrophages ) assays to show that compared to M1 macrophage - conditioned media , M2 macrophage - conditioned media enhance neurite outgrowth even on inhibitory substrates . The persistence of M1 mac - rophages after SCI is in contrast to what happens in typical wound healing process , which is associated with predomi - nantly M2 macrophages [ 43 ] . Thus , this gave rise to the possibility that the persistence of M1 macrophages after SCI contributes to a chronic inflammatory state that impedes cel - lular regeneration . An important issue that remains to be addressed is the origin of M1 / M2 - like macrophages . One possibility is that 788 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 the injury environment is the major determinant of mac - rophage polarization . As monocytes enter the injury site , the injured environment could be favorable to an M1 - like polarization . The fact that most macrophages persist chroni - cally in this state rather than an M2 - like state associated with wound resolution ( as mentioned above ) indicates that the injured spinal cord environment is unique compared to other injured tissues . For example , due to the abundance of myelin debris in the injured spinal cord , macrophages become lipid - laden foam cells that are characterized as pro - inflammatory M1 - like cells [ 99 ] ( discussed in more detail below ) . If M1 - like polarization is mainly due to the injury environment , then altering this environment would be pre - dicted to shift macrophage polarization state . Accordingly , degradation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPG ) by chondroitinase ABC promotes a more M2 - like macrophage phenotype [ 15 ] . An alternative possibility is that macrophage polarization states are cell autonomously pre - determined , which is sup - ported by the original M1 / M2 macrophage study described above where macrophages from Th1 and Th2 mouse strains display distinct activation response . Accordingly , a previ - ous study comparing multiple mouse strains with different susceptibilities to EAE ( experimental autoimmune encepha - lomyelitis ) found that C57BL / 6 mice ( EAE - susceptible Th1 strain ) display a much stronger inflammatory response than Balb / C mice ( EAE - resistant Th2 strain ) , including increased macrophage activation , neutrophil and T - cell infiltration , Fig . 1 Bone marrow chimeras reveal distinct spatial distribution of macrophages and microglia at the spinal cord injury site . a – d LysM - Cre mice were bred to Rosa26 - tdTomato mice to generate LysM tdTom reporter mice in which myeloid cells are labeled with tdTomato . Bone marrow from LysM tdTom donor mice were transplanted into irradi - ated Cx3Cr1 EYFP recipient mice to generate LysM tdTom > Cx3Cr1 EYFP chimera mice in which microglia are labeled with EYFP and hema - togenous macrophages are labeled with tdTomato . At 14 days after SCI , microglia ( c ) are distributed mostly around the lesion site in the GFAP + astroglial scar region ( b ) , whereas macrophages are located both within the GFAP − lesion site and in the surrounding astroglial scar ( d ) . e – h Bone marrow from Cx3Cr1 EYFP donor mice were transplanted into irradiated wildtype recipient mice to gener - ate Cx3Cr1 EYFP > WT chimera mice in which only macrophages are labeled with EYFP . In theory , this should result in a similar distribu - tion pattern as LysM tdTom macrophages shown in d . However , large areas of the GFAP − region ( f ) are devoid of EYFP signal ( h ) even though a large number of CD11b + myeloid cells can be observed immunohistochemically ( g ) . This leads to the false impression that macrophages are located in the surrounding astroglial scar region , and that the CD11b + / EYFP − cells in the GFAP − region are microglia . Scale bar in a , e = 500 µm . Unpublished images from [ 107 ] 789 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 and greater fibrotic response [ 39 ] . However , despite the significantly less inflammatory response , Balb / C mice dis - played similar lesion morphometry and locomotor recovery as C57Bl / 6 mice [ 1 , 39 ] . Other studies have also reported such disconnection between the inflammatory response and behavioral recovery . Although 129X1 / SvJ mice show decreased macrophage infiltration and greater axonal growth into the lesion , their lesion size and locomotor recovery are similar to C57BL / 6 mice [ 54 ] . In fact , in MRL / MpJ mice , which display scarless skin regeneration , attenuated macrophage infiltration is associated with worse locomo - tor recovery and greater lesion size [ 41 ] . Taken together , these studies suggest that there are beneficial and detrimen - tal aspects of the macrophage inflammatory response that must be considered when targeting inflammation after spinal cord injury . Transcriptional regulation of macrophage polarization Cellular changes in phenotype and function often require significant alterations in gene expression , which is regu - lated by transcription factors . Transcription factors that affect macrophage polarization have been an intense area of investigation in various disorders , and are reviewed in detail elsewhere [ 20 , 75 , 98 ] . Thus , we will focus on a few in the context of SCI . IFNγ and LPS are the classical acti - vating ligands for inducing M1 polarization . IFNγ binds to the IFNγ receptor , which signals primarily through STAT1 activation . However , since IFNγ is not highly expressed at the SCI site [ 30 ] , it is not clear whether this signaling pathway plays a major role in macrophage polarization after SCI . Although LPS stimulation is not very representative of sterile inflammatory mechanisms that occur after SCI , its receptor , TLR4 , is one of the major receptors for damage - associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) , such as HMGB1 , that are widespread at the injury site [ 16 ] and present in higher levels in plasma samples from humans with SCI [ 70 ] . TLR4 receptors signal through activation of NF - κB , which is a classic transcription factor for many pro - inflammatory cytokines , including TNF , IL - 1β , COX2 , and IL - 6 , and a potent inducer of M1 - like polarization [ reviewed by 52 ] . TNF and IL - 1β are often used to model sterile inflam - mation that induces M1 polarization in vitro , and both cytokines are expressed highly after SCI [ 72 ] . The peak of TNF mRNA expression is within the 1st hour after injury , followed by peak of IL - 1β mRNA expression at around 12 h after injury [ 72 ] . TNF exists in soluble ( solTNF ) and transmembrane ( tmTNF ) forms , and bind preferentially to receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 , respectively [ 28 ] , both of which are expressed acutely after SCI [ 101 ] . Most of the inflammatory effects attributed to TNF are through the activation of TNFR1 by solTNF , which eventually leads to NF - κB activation and M1 - like macrophage polarization as described above . Importantly , pharmacological inhibition of solTNF signaling has been reported to improve function after SCI , although it is not clear whether the effects were mediated by effects on macrophage polarization [ 61 , 68 ] . IL - 1β also activates NF - κB by binding to the Type I IL - 1 receptor ( IL - 1RI ) , thereby leading to M1 - like polarization . Administration of recombinant IL - 1β exacerbates histopa - thology and loss of function , whereas genetic deletion of IL - 1β has a beneficial effect on these outcome measures [ 4 ] . However , it is not clear whether either the detrimental or the beneficial effects are mediated by changes in macrophage polarization . IL - 4 and IL10 are the classic M2 polarizing ligands . IL - 4 binds to IL - 4Ra , which activates STAT6 that functions as an important mediator of the M2 - like phenotype . STAT6 stimulation leads to activation of several other transcription factors that are important for M2 - like polarization , including PPARγ , PPARδ , and KLF4 [ reviewed by 75 ] . PPARγ acti - vation leads to expression of classical M2 - associated genes such as Arg1 and MMR ( CD206 ) [ 12 , 69 ] . IL - 10 binds to IL - 10R , which activates the JAK1 / STAT3 pathway that indi - rectly suppresses expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines through expression of several effector genes [ reviewed by 64 ] . However , STAT3 is also activated by the pro - inflamma - tory cytokine IL - 6 . A potential explanation for this paradox is that IL - 6 results in a more transient STAT3 activation , whereas IL - 10 results in a more sustained activation [ 8 ] , perhaps due to negative feedback from SOCS family mem - bers after IL - 6 activation but not IL - 10 [ 103 ] . Interestingly , expression of IL - 4 and IL - 10 , along with most other anti - inflammatory cytokines , exhibit transient and acute expres - sion after SCI [ 22 , 46 , 63 ] , which may contribute to the prevalence of M1 - like macrophages that persist chronically at the injury site . Accordingly , exogenous administration of IL - 4 can promote M2 - like polarization that is associated with improved histopathology and behavioral outcomes [ 22 ] . Formation of foamy macrophages after SCI Macrophages are most often defined in terms of the M1 / M2 spectrum nomenclature , which is conceptually helpful , but difficult to apply in practice , especially in vivo . The classic M1 / M2 markers of iNOS and Arg1 are no longer consid - ered to be sufficient as definitive polarization markers , and although most studies now use several markers , there is no clear consensus on which combinations correspond to which region along the polarization spectrum , and these markers often do not provide functional insight . Instead of using indi - vidual markers , an alternative approach is to assess the entire macrophage transcriptional profile , which provides a more comprehensive and unbiased method of comparing cellular phenotypes . 790 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 Using the Ribotag method [ 85 ] to obtain the first mac - rophage - specific transcriptome from the injured spinal cord , Zhu et al . [ 106 ] used single - sample gene set enrichment analysis ( ssGSEA ) to compare SCI macrophages to many other macrophage phenotypes from both in vitro and in vivo samples . This analysis revealed that the transcriptome of SCI macrophages was most similar to that of lipid - laden “foamy” macrophages rather than M1 - or M2 - like mac - rophages . Interestingly , pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed molecular mechanisms that were very similar to those described in the atherosclerosis litera - ture [ 62 ] , suggesting overlapping pathological mechanisms , and therapeutic targets between the two disorders . One of the first reports of foamy macrophages after SCI was in human post - mortem tissue where these lipid - laden macrophages were present in the lesion even at 1 year after injury [ 21 ] . We have only recently started to gain a mecha - nistic understanding of how foamy macrophages contrib - ute to SCI pathology . Foamy macrophages display a pro - inflammatory , M1 - like phenotype in vivo [ 99 ] , and genetic deletion of the classic lipoprotein scavenger receptor , CD36 , leads to decreased macrophage lipid content , smaller lesion size , and improved locomotor recovery [ 106 ] ( myelin debris receptors are discussed in more detail below ) . These results are consistent with the pathological contribution of foamy macrophages in atherosclerosis [ 62 ] , but contradict the anti - inflammatory roles of foamy macrophages proposed in mul - tiple sclerosis [ 5 , 7 reviewed by 40 ] . The exact mechanisms governing macrophage phagocytosis after SCI , including foam cell formation , have yet to be fully elucidated , although existing studies suggest they play a central role in striking the balance between inflammatory aggravation and resolu - tion after SCI . Furthermore , conflicting data on this topic suggest that macrophage phagocytosis is influenced by an array of microenvironmental cues that comprise the complex physiological landscape of the lesion site . Macrophage phagocytosis mechanisms Cellular debris clearance by macrophages In the immediate aftermath of SCI , peripheral neutrophils are recruited to the lesion and enter the CNS through the mechanically compromised blood – brain barrier , beginning in the first hours following injury and peaking at 24 h post - injury [ 67 ] . Subsequent infiltration is further assisted by the secretion of matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) , which disrupt the integrity of the neurovasculature and enhance neutrophil , and later monocyte , transendothelial migration [ 67 ] . This early population of infiltrating myeloid cells are responsible for the initial phase of debris clearance in the injury paren - chyma , stimulating pro - inflammatory mechanisms through their secretion of cytokines such as TNF [ 65 ] , proteases including MMPs , as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [ 2 , 31 , 79 ] . In fact , recent evidence suggests that after a peripheral nerve lesion , clearance of the distal nerve stump during Wallerian degeneration is primarily by neutro - phils rather than macrophages [ 51 ] . As neutrophils begin to undergo apoptosis , monocytes are subsequently recruited to the site via chemoattractive signals such as MCP - 1 ( Ccl2 ) . Accordingly , its receptor Ccr2 has been shown to be essen - tial to monocyte mobilization [ 45 , 55 , 74 ] . Other attractants include the CC chemokines , such as MIP - 1a ( Ccl3 ) , and IL - 1β , which have also been shown in models of neurode - generation to effectively recruit peripheral macrophages , although these have not been specifically implicated in SCI [ 71 ] . Once at the injury site , monocytes differentiate into mac - rophages in response to cytokines and chemokines present in the lesion environment and begin to remove dying neu - trophils through a process called efferocytosis [ 32 , 38 ] . The specific molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage recognition and internalization of apoptotic neutrophils as they occur in SCI have not been fully delineated . How - ever , in vitro work has shown a dependence of macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils on the interaction between the scavenger receptor CD36 with the vitronectin receptor and thrombospondin [ 86 ] . Other molecular cues of apoptotic cells , such as phosphatidylserine from the exposed inner leaflet or ATP , recognized by receptors Mertk and P2Py , respectively , may also drive these interactions [ 49 ] . Receptors mediating macrophage phagocytosis In addition to their role in neutrophil clearance , macrophages also participate in general tissue debris clearance once they arrive at the injury site , expressing a heterogeneous profile of surface receptors to mediate these processes . A large por - tion of the cellular debris after SCI is derived from myelin , and myelin phagocytosis has been largely attributed to CR3 ( Mac - 1 , CD11b ) , SR - AI / II ( Msr1 ) , and FcR [ reviewed by 13 , 78 , 83 ] . However , since antibodies to myelin are absent after SCI , FcR can be most likely ruled out as a potential mecha - nism , and Msr1 has not been investigated in SCI . Injection of purified myelin into the mouse spinal cord triggers a large influx of neutrophils and macrophages that causes increased expression of many pro - inflammatory cytokines , and these effects are significantly mitigated in CR3 knockout mice , implicating CR3 as an important mechanism of myelin phagocytosis in the spinal cord [ 93 ] . However , whether CR3 knockout mice display decreased levels of foamy mac - rophages that lead to reduced inflammation and improved functional outcomes is not known . As mentioned above , class B scavenger receptor , CD36 ( SR - B2 ) , has also been shown to be involved in myelin 791 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 phagocytosis after SCI [ 106 ] . First identified by their abil - ity to bind oxidized lipoproteins [ 9 , 10 ] , scavenger recep - tors are multifaceted and promiscuous in ligand interac - tions and functional capacities . CD36 shows a wide range of interacting partners , including proteins such as integrins , thrombospondins and fibronectin as well as lipid metabolic byproducts such as fatty acids and modified lipoproteins [ 76 ] . Additionally , CD36 can form multi - receptor complexes with receptors like Toll - like receptors to further modulate the macrophage inflammatory phenotype . This can occur either by endocytosis of the CD36 – TLR complex or induc - tion of specific intracellular signaling cascades , including PPAR transcriptional upregulation [ 92 ] . It is important to note that , despite leading to improved histopathology and locomotor recovery , genetic deletion of CD36 only led to a modest decrease in lipid droplet content in macrophages at the injury site [ 106 ] . This underscores the importance of investigating the contribution of other receptors in mac - rophage function and spinal cord pathobiology in hopes that even further benefits can be achieved . In addition to these classical myelin receptors , many oth - ers have been recently implicated . Genetic knockdown of collectin placenta 1 ( CL - P1 ) , a class A scavenger recep - tor ( SCARA4 ) that is upregulated in MS lesions , as well as pharmacological inhibition of MerTK , tyrosine kinase phagocytic receptor of the TAM family , reduced myelin uptake in vitro [ 6 , 33 ] . Inhibition of low - density lipopro - tein - related protein 1 ( Lrp1 ) also reduced myelin phago - cytosis in primary oligodendrocytes , microglia , and astro - cytes [ 23 ] . Induction of the PPAR / LXRα / ABCA1 pathway through ligands such as adiponectin has been show to attenu - ate myelin foam cell formation in vitro through enhanced lipid efflux and decreased production of pro - inflammatory cytokines , as well as restore normal macrophage func - tion , such as phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils [ 105 ] . Similar results were found in vivo where administration of AdipoRon , an adiponectin receptor agonist , decreased mac - rophage recruitment and myelin lipid accumulation at the injury site , and significantly improved locomotor recovery [ 105 ] . Thus , there is a wide range of receptor classes that can mediate myelin phagocytosis , but most of these studies have been performed using in vitro assays , and the contribution of these receptors in animal models of CNS injury remains poorly understood . Macrophage regulation of cellular regeneration There is ample evidence of infiltrating immune cells hav - ing beneficial contributions to tissue repair , a concept cen - tral to the theory of “protective autoimmunity” [ 87 – 89 ] . This school of thought posits that the immune response to CNS injury or disease is not harmful but in fact essential to counteracting CNS tissue damage generated by this insult [ 104 ] . Following this logic , the notion of the CNS as an “immune privileged” site would underlie the devastating effects of secondary damage and its poor intrinsic regenera - tive capacity . Therefore , facilitating this neuroimmune axis would confer protective effects and promote restoration of tissue in response to pathological conditions . Although this theory encompasses T - cell - mediated effects , macrophages are also included as important players in this protective immune response . For example , injection of macrophages pre - exposed to sciatic nerve segments promotes axon regen - eration and restoration of electrophysiological function , as well as hindlimb locomotor recovery in the injured rat spi - nal cord [ 77 ] . Similar results were found where enhancing monocyte numbers and their recruitment to the injury site through either vaccination or adoptive transfer improved recovery , and depleting this monocyte pool through cell - specific ablation worsened histological and functional out - comes after SCI [ 90 ] . Furthermore , depletion of microglia and peripherally derived macrophages has been shown to impair remyelination and alter OPC differentiation and sign - aling processes [ 42 , 50 , 60 ] , which may represent another avenue of macrophage modulation of neural regeneration . Immune activation via mild inflammation is another pro - posed means of promoting regeneration . This phenomenon was demonstrated in a recent study where systemic LPS injection was paired with rehabilitative training , resulting in improved forelimb function than compared to training alone in rats after SCI [ 95 ] . The notion of a “conditioning lesion , ” where a peripheral nerve lesion results in enhanced regeneration of the associated central ascending dorsal col - umn sensory axons [ 80 ] , is also consistent with the idea that priming the immune system can promote regeneration and repair . This conditioning lesion phenomenon has tradition - ally been thought to result from changes in intrinsic growth mechanisms , and has been commonly used to investigate intrinsic regenerative capacity of neurons . However , recent studies implicate macrophages as the major mediator of the axon regenerative response . Hervera et al . [ 34 ] recently demonstrated that NOX2 - containing endosomes released by macrophages at the peripheral nerve lesion site are taken up by severed axons and then retrogradely transported to the ganglion cell body . Here , NOX2 inactivates PTEN , stimulat - ing regeneration of the central DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ) axons . It is not yet known why such pro - regenerative mecha - nism exists only after lesion of peripheral but not central axons . In addition to effects at the peripheral nerve lesion site , macrophages also affect DRG neurons at the cell body region . Conditioning lesion of the peripheral nerve is typi - cally associated with accumulation of macrophages in the corresponding DRG [ 53 ] , and the conditioning effect is diminished upon genetic deletion of CCR2 , or mimicked 792 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 upon overexpression of CCL2 both in vitro and in vivo [ 44 , 66 , 108 ] . Macrophages may also elicit a beneficial effect through interactions with CNS resident microglia by modulating the phagocytic and inflammatory response . This is supported by the observation that the onset of macrophage infiltration to the injury site is associated with a decrease in microglia phagocytosis [ 27 ] . Additionally , co - culturing macrophages and microglia isolated from the injury site resulted in a decrease in microglial expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL - 1β and reduced phagocytic capacity , potentially due to prostaglandin E2 signaling via EP2 receptor activ - ity [ 27 ] . These effects were further probed in vivo using CCR2 - deficient mice incapable of effectively recruiting monocytes to the injury site , which resulted in enhanced microglial activation and impaired motor recovery after SCI , providing further evidence of anti - inflammatory con - sequences of macrophage recruitment after SCI [ 27 ] . How - ever , these results are in contrast to macrophage depletion studies mentioned above , where mostly beneficial effects were observed . One possibility that remains to be tested in the future is that macrophage depletion ( using splenectomy or clodronate liposomes ) and CCR2 genetic deletion target different macrophage populations with distinct effects on SCI pathology . Macrophages may also promote spinal cord repair by mediating tissue remodeling . The injection of a novel polyphosphazene - based hydrogel into the injury site vir - tually eliminated cavitation , significantly improved tissue sparing , and increased axonal growth as well as locomotor recovery after SCI in rats [ 35 ] . Interestingly , these benefi - cial effects were mediated by infiltration of M2 - like mac - rophages into the hydrogel implant , which promoted infil - tration of perivascular fibroblasts and extracellular matrix remodeling . Elimination of macrophage infiltration via minocycline administration , or elimination of fibrosis via taxol administration both led to cavitation at the injury site . These responses are similar to the proper wound healing processes that are mediated by M2 - like macrophages in peripheral tissue [ 43 ] . There is also abundant evidence indicating that mac - rophages are deleterious to regeneration and spinal cord repair . Numerous experiments utilizing models of mac - rophage depletion / ablation , such as liposome clodronate administration , have reported improved functional and his - tological outcomes , suggesting that macrophages are neuro - toxic and impede recovery [ 29 , 48 , 73 , 107 ] . Macrophages may mediate these harmful effects through direct interac - tions , as in vivo two - photon imaging of GFP + bone mar - row chimeras showed that blood - borne macrophages , and not resident microglia , interact directly with axons during secondary dieback after SCI [ 19 ] . Alternatively , it could be the more indirect effects of macrophage depletion , such as reduced fibrotic scarring , that is the predominant mechanism underlying this functional improvement in animals subjected to macrophage depletion after SCI [ 107 ] . These positive and negative effects of macrophages on cellular regeneration have been attributed mainly to their dif - ferent polarization states ( i . e . , M1 like or M2 like ) . In addi - tion to macrophage origin as mentioned above , their mode of entry into the CNS upon injury may also influence the polar - ization state . Reparative and neuroprotective macrophages were found to originate from the choroid plexus and travel to the injury site via the central canal , whereas more inflamma - tory macrophages of hematopoietic origin entered through the meningeal barrier [ 91 ] . However , these divergent effects are not necessarily the byproduct of distinct populations . For example , zymosan - activated macrophages have been shown to elicit both deleterious and pro - regenerative pro - cesses in the spinal cord , suggesting that these responses can co - occur in the same macrophage subtype [ 25 ] . The crux of the issue , therefore , is not completely abolishing inflamma - tion , but ensuring the efficient and proper synchronization of the transition to a more pro - regenerative phenotype at the appropriate time point , a resolving phase characteristic of the classical wound healing model and observed in PNS , but not CNS , injury disease models . Concluding remarks and future directions It is now abundantly clear that macrophages play a central role in the wound healing process after SCI . However , there are fundamental issues that remain to be addressed . The acute origin of macrophages seems to be from a monocyte reservoir in the spleen , but there seems to be an alterna - tive source during the chronic time points ( Fig . 2 ) . Is there an endogenous pool that self - renews , or is there a constant influx of bone marrow - derived monocytes from the circula - tion ? What are the functional similarities and differences between these temporally separated population of mac - rophages ? In addition , although the M1 / M2 classification of macrophages is useful conceptually , these polarization states remain elusive in vivo . In fact , macrophage - specific transcriptomic analysis suggests that SCI macrophages are best characterized as foam cells , and future studies at the single cell level will bring us closer to understanding the true identity and heterogeneity of macrophages in the injured CNS . A better understanding of the origin of macrophages may provide important insight into their fate and function after spinal cord injury , which can help identify novel thera - peutic targets . 793 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 Acknowledgements This manuscript was supported by NINDS R01NS081040 , the Buoniconti Fund , and The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis .

Pro - inflammatory splenic macrophages comprise the major source of the initial wave of macrophage influx . A second wave of anti - inflam - matory macrophages could be from either the bone marrow or from a self - renewing source at the injury site . The spinal cord injury site is comprised of a fibrotic core comprised of non - neural cells such as fibroblasts and macrophages surrounded by neural cells such as astrocytes and microglia . Bone marrow chimera studies ( Fig . 1 ) demon - strate the presence of Cx3Cr1 lo macrophages in the fibrotic region , and Cx3Cr1 hi mac - rophages in both the fibrotic and surrounding neural tissue . These two types of macrophages could correspond to the pro - inflam - matory and anti - inflammatory subtypes from the spleen and bone marrow , respectively 794 Acta Neuropathologica ( 2019 ) 137 : 785 – 797 1 3 plasticity after spinal cord injury .
