Cell Polarity and Movement with Reaction - Diﬀusion and Moving Boundary : Rigorous Modeling and Robust Simulations Shuang Liu ∗ Li - Tien Cheng † Bo Li ‡ August 12 , 2022 Abstract Cell polarity and movement are fundamental to many biological functions . Exper - imental and theoretically studies have indicated that interactions of certain proteins lead to the cell polarization which plays a key role in controlling the cell movement . We study the cell polarity and movement based on a class of biophysical models that consist of reaction - diﬀusion equations for diﬀerent proteins and the dynamics of moving cell boundary . Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase - ﬁled model . We ﬁrst apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp - interface model of the cell boundary from a phase - ﬁeld model . We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level - set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction - diﬀusion equations on the moving cell region . Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimulus , and capture both the linear and cir - cular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time . In particular , we have identiﬁed some key parameters controlling diﬀerent cell trajectories that are less ac - curately predicted by reduced models . Our work has linked diﬀerent models and also developed tools that can be adapted for the challenging three - dimensional simulations . Key words and phrases : cell polarity , cell movement , reaction - diﬀusion equations , interface dynamics , matched asymptotic analysis , the level - set method . 1 Introduction Cell motility is fundamental to many biological functions such as immune response , morpho - genesis , cancer metastasis , and wound healing , and yet it is extremely complicated [ 2 ] .

D S ] 10 A ug 2022 movement of a eukaryotic cell crawling on a surface is a complex process , involving protru - sion , retraction , and adhesion , exhibiting complex geometrical shapes and motion trajecto - ries . Cell polarity , the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of diﬀerent biomolecules such as proteins Rho GTPases inside a cell , resulting from biochemical interactions of biomolecules inside the cell , plays a crucial role in the cell movement [ 13 , 19 , 27 ] . As cell polarity and movement involve multiple spatio - temporal scales and many - body interactions , understand - ing such complex processes is challenging . Recent years have seen the theoretical and computational development in studying cell polarity and motility [ 3 , 18 , 19 ] . Among diﬀerent approaches , continuum models with reaction - diﬀusion equations and moving boundaries provide eﬃcient simulation tools to understand the key mechanisms in cell polarity and movement [ 4 – 6 , 20 , 21 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 35 , 37 ] . An advantage of such modelling is that the motion of cell boundary , which is directly connected to the reaction and diﬀusion of a diﬀerent biomolecules inside the cell , can be simulated and analyzed to link the molecular basis for the cell polarity to the macroscopic cell movement , and to identify the key parameters that control the cell polarization and movement . In this work , we study the cell polarity and movement with a class of models that have been proposed in Mori et al . [ 20 , 21 ] , Shao et al . [ 31 ] , and Camley et al . [ 5 , 6 ] . The basic components of such a model include a moving cell whose boundary motion is determined completely by its normal velocity , i . e . , the normal component of the velocity . In addition to the geometrical eﬀect , such normal velocity is controlled by the amount of a membrane - bound Rho GTPases , e . g . , Rac . Mori et al . [ 20 ] proposed the wave - pinning mechanism for the cell polarization : the reaction and diﬀusion of a membrane - bound active Rho GTPase and an inactive cytosolic form of Rho GTPase with a bistable kinetics lead to the formation of an interface inside a cell that separates a high from a low concentration of the active Rho GTPase proteins , and the propagation of such interface drives the cell polarization that reaches a steady state eventually , as the wave is pinned down . Camley et al . [ 6 ] reduce the two - species ( active form and inactive form of Rho GTPase proteins ) model proposed in [ 20 ] to a single - species model , and also numerically simulated the cell polarization and movement using a phase - ﬁeld method , but carried out analysis with a sharp - interface description of the cell boundary motion . Simulations by Camley et al . [ 6 ] predict the linear and circular trajectories as a result of the wave - pinning dynamics . To be speciﬁc , let us consider a moving cell conﬁned spatially in a bounded region Ω ⊂ R d ( d = 2 or 3 ) . Let us denote the cell boundary by Γ ( t ) at time t and assume it moves with the normal velocity V = V ( x , t ) for each point x ∈ Γ ( t ) . The cell boundary Γ ( t ) separates the region Ω into the cell region , denoted Ω + ( t ) , from the outer region , denoted Ω − ( t ) . As in [ 6 , 20 ] , let us consider the types of proteins inside the cell , a membrane - bound active and fast - diﬀusive inactive Rho GTPase proteins , and denote their concentrations by u = u ( x , t ) and v = v ( x , t ) , respectively . Extended from the one - dimensional model [ 20 ] ( cf . also [ 31 ] ) , our model of an underlying moving cell is governed by the following system of equations and boundary conditions : τV = αu − β − γH for x ∈ Γ ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 1 ) ∂ t u = D u ∆ u + f ( u , v ) for x ∈ Ω + ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 2 ) ∂ t v = D v ∆ v − f ( u , v ) for x ∈ Ω + ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 3 ) ∂ n u = ∂ n v = 0 for x ∈ Γ ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 4 ) 2 where f ( u , v ) = − ku ( u − 0 . 5 c ) ( u − Cv ) . ( 1 . 5 ) In ( 1 . 1 ) , τ is the friction coeﬃcient , α and β are the coeﬃcients of F - actin extension and myosin retraction , respectively , γ is the surface tension constant , and H is the mean curvature of the cell boundary Γ ( t ) . In ( 1 . 2 ) and ( 1 . 3 ) , D u and D v are the diﬀusion constants for u and v , respectively . We shall consider the regime that D v (cid:29) D u . In the reaction term f ( u , v ) deﬁned in ( 1 . 5 ) , k is the reaction rate relative to an average cell motility , c is the constant averaged concentration u in the cell front , and C is a conversion parameter . Estimated values of these parameters are given in Table 1 in section 4 . Note that the total mass M = (cid:90) Ω + ( t ) [ u ( x , t ) + v ( x , t ) ] dx ( 1 . 6 ) is a constant with respect to time t . Assuming an inﬁnite diﬀusion constant D v , Camley et al . [ 6 ] have proposed and studied the following single - species model , reduced from the two - species model ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) : τV = αu − β − γH for x ∈ Γ ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 7 ) ∂ t u = D u ∆ u + f ( u , ¯ v ) for x ∈ Ω + ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 8 ) ∂ n u = 0 for x ∈ Γ ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 1 . 9 ) where ¯ v , depending only on u , is determined by the mass conservation and the fact that v should be a constant with the large D v assumption , and is given by ¯ v = 1 Area ( Ω + ( t ) ) (cid:18) M − (cid:90) Ω + ( t ) u ( x , t ) dx (cid:19) . To eﬃciently track the moving cell boundary in computer simulations , Shao et al . [ 30 , 31 ] and Camley et al . [ 4 – 6 ] have used the phase - ﬁeld model [ 1 , 7 , 14 , 16 ] . In such a model , the moving cell boundary is described by a continuous function , often called a phase ﬁeld , that takes the value 1 in the cell region and 0 otherwise , and smoothly changes its values from 0 to 1 in a thin transition layer , representing a diﬀuse cell boundary . Let us denote by φ ε = φ ε ( x , t ) ( x ∈ Ω , t ≥ 0 ) such a phase - ﬁeld function , where ε ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) is a small parameter and t represents time . Let us also denote by u ε = u ε ( x , t ) and v ε = v ε ( x , t ) the concentrations of the two diﬀerent proteins , respectively , as described in ( 1 . 2 ) and ( 1 . 3 ) . Note that these functions are now deﬁned on the entire region Ω . The phase - ﬁled model that corresponds to the system of equations ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) , which shall be called a sharp - interface model , is then given by τ∂ t φ ε = ( αu ε − β ) | ∇ φ ε | + γ (cid:20) ∆ φ ε − 1 ε 2 W (cid:48) ( φ ε ) (cid:21) in Ω × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 1 . 10 ) ∂ t ( φ ε u ε ) = ∇ · D u ( φ ε ∇ u ε ) + f ( u ε , v ε ) in Ω × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 1 . 11 ) ∂ t ( φ ε v ε ) = ∇ · D v ( φ ε ∇ v ε ) − f ( u ε , v ε ) in Ω × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 1 . 12 ) φ ε = u ε = v ε = 0 in ∂ Ω × [ 0 , ∞ ) , ( 1 . 13 ) 3 where all the parameters and the function f are the same as above , and W = W ( u ) is a double - well potential given speciﬁcally by W ( u ) = 18 u 2 ( 1 − u ) 2 ∀ u ∈ R . ( 1 . 14 ) In this work , we study the reaction - diﬀusion moving boundary model to understand the mechanisms of cell polarization and movement and the cooperation of these two processes . Our goal is two fold . One is to understand the diﬀerences between some of the existing models and make connections of such models . The other is to develop robust computational tools for long - time accurate and eﬃcient simulations of cell movement . Speciﬁcally : ( 1 ) We derive rigorously the sharp - interface reaction - diﬀusion moving boundary model ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) from the phase - ﬁeld model ( 1 . 10 ) – ( 1 . 13 ) . While there are diﬀerent ad - vantages of diﬀerent models , our analysis examines the consistency of these models . ( 2 ) We develop a robust computational program that combines the level - set method and high - accurate discretization method for solving reaction - diﬀusion equations on a moving cell region and for tracking the moving cell boundary . We test our numerical methods . ( 3 ) We apply our numerical methods and algorithms to conduct a serious of computer simulations for the cell polarization and movement . We try to answer several questions : How does a cell respond to an external stimulus to polarize itself and then to move around ? How does a cell keep diﬀerent kinds of trajectories , such as a linear or a circular trajectory , for a very long time ? Our computational analysis predicts several important parameters such a ﬁnite diﬀusion constant ( instead of taking it to be inﬁnite in a reduced model ) , the surface tension constant , and threshold concentration of an active Rho GTPase protein that partially controls the cell movement . Our computational tools prepare us well for future , large - scale three - dimensional simulations of the cell movement , which has been lacking currently in general . The paper is organized as follows . In section 2 , we use the method of matched asymp - totic analysis to derive the sharp - interface limit , the system ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) , of the phase - ﬁeld reaction - diﬀusion moving boundary model ( 1 . 10 ) – ( 1 . 13 ) . In section 3 , we describe a robust and accurate numerical method that combines a high - order ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization technique and a level - set method for the simulation of a moving cell . In section 4 , we show our numerical simulations and analyze our results with various settings . Finally , in section 5 , we draw our conclusions and discuss several issues for further studies . 2 From Phase - Field to Sharp - Interface Model In this section , we carry out the matched asymptotic analysis [ 8 , 9 , 15 , 26 , 29 ] to derive the sharp - interface model ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) from the phase - ﬁeld model ( 1 . 10 ) – ( 1 . 13 ) . Speciﬁcally , we show that as ε → 0 the solution φ ε converges to the characteristic function of the cell region Ω + ( t ) , the normal velocity of the cell boundary Γ ( t ) = ∂ Ω + ( t ) is given by ( 1 . 1 ) , and the solutions u ε and ε ε converge to the solutions to ( 1 . 2 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) . We shall analyze the following more general phase - ﬁeld model in the setting of three - dimensional space : ∂ t φ ε = h ( u ε , v ε ) | ∇ φ ε | + γ (cid:20) ∆ φ ε − 1 ε 2 W (cid:48) ( φ ε ) (cid:21) in Ω × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 2 . 1 ) 4 ∂ t ( φ ε u ε ) = ∇ · D 1 ( φ ε ∇ u ε ) + f ( u ε , v ε ) in Ω × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 2 . 2 ) ∂ t ( φ ε v ε ) = ∇ · D 2 ( φ ε ∇ v ε ) + g ( u ε , v ε ) in Ω × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 2 . 3 ) φ ε = u ε = v ε = 0 in ∂ Ω × [ 0 , ∞ ) . ( 2 . 4 ) Here , Ω ⊂ R 3 is a smooth and bounded domain , ε ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) is a small parameter , γ > 0 , D 1 > 0 , and D 2 > 0 are all constants , and f , g , and h are all smooth and bounded two - variable functions . The double - well function W is deﬁned in ( 1 . 14 ) . Note that the analysis for the single - species system ( 1 . 7 ) – ( 1 . 9 ) or for a two - dimensional setting is similar . Initial formation of a diﬀuse cell boundary . We assume the following expansions : φ ε ( x , t ) = φ 0 ( x , τ ) + εφ 1 ( x , τ ) + ε 2 φ 2 ( x , τ ) + · · · , u ε ( x , t ) = u 0 ( x , τ ) + εu 1 ( x , τ ) + ε 2 u 2 ( x , τ ) + · · · , v ε ( x , t ) = v 0 ( x , τ ) + εv 1 ( x , τ ) + ε 2 v 2 ( x , τ ) + · · · , where τ = τ ( t , ε ) is a time variable that can be diﬀerent from the regular time variable t , and all the functions φ i = φ i ( x , τ ) , u i = u i ( x , τ ) , and v i = v i ( x , τ ) ( i = 0 , 1 , . . . ) are smooth and bounded in Ω , satisfying the boundary conditions φ i = u i = v i = 0 on ∂ Ω ; cf . ( 2 . 4 ) . Considering a fast time scale τ = t / ε 2 , we have ∂ t = ε − 2 ∂ τ . Plugging the above expressions of φ ε , u ε , and v ε into ( 2 . 1 ) , using Taylor’s expansion , and comparing terms of the leading orders O ( ε − 2 ) and O ( ε − 1 ) , respectively , we obtain that O ( ε − 2 ) : ∂ τ φ 0 = − γW (cid:48) ( φ 0 ) and O ( ε − 1 ) : ∂ τ φ 1 = − γW (cid:48)(cid:48) ( φ 0 ) φ 1 . Since W (cid:48) ( s ) = 0 if and only if s = 0 , 1 / 2 , or 1 , with 0 and 1 being local minima of W and 1 / 2 being a local maximum of W , given any point x ∈ Ω and any initial data φ 0 ( x , 0 ) (cid:54) = 1 / 2 φ 0 ( x , τ ) → 0 or 1 exponentially as τ → ∞ . Once φ 0 falls into ( −∞ , ( 3 − √ 3 ) / 6 ) ∪ ( ( 3 + √ 3 ) / 6 , ∞ ) , the convex region of W , then φ 1 ( x , τ ) → 0 exponentially as τ → ∞ . If we consider the next fast time scale with τ = t / ε , then we have ∂ t = ε − 1 ∂ τ . Similar calculations lead to the leading - order equations O ( ε − 2 ) : W (cid:48) ( φ 0 ) = 0 and O ( ε − 1 ) : ∂ τ φ 0 = − γW (cid:48)(cid:48) ( φ 0 ) φ 1 . Again , we see that φ 0 = 0 , 1 / 2 , or 1 , and since W (cid:48)(cid:48) ( φ 0 ) (cid:54) = 0 , we have φ 1 = 0 . Results are the same if we consider the regular time scale τ = t . We can therefore assume that the region Ω is divided by the phase - ﬁeld function φ ε into an outer region O ε ( t ) : = Ω − ε ( t ) ∪ Ω + ε ( t ) , where Ω − ε ( t ) = { x ∈ Ω : u ε ( x , t ) = O ( ε 2 ) } and Ω + ε ( t ) = { x ∈ Ω : u ε ( x , t ) = 1 + O ( ε 2 ) } , and an inner region I ε ( t ) : = Ω \ O ε ( t ) , where φ ε changes from 0 to 1 , representing the diﬀuse cell boundary . The region Ω + ε ( t ) is the cell region at t . Note that , by the imposed boundary conditions u ε = 0 on ∂ Ω , the boundary ∂ Ω is included in the closure of Ω − ε ( t ) . We further assume that the inner region I ε ( t ) is an O ( ε ) - neighborhood of a closed and smooth surface Γ ( t ) , independent of ε , that is the limit of { x ∈ Ω : u ε ( x , t ) = 1 / 2 } as ε → 0 . Moreover , the interior and exterior of Γ ( t ) , denoted Ω + ( t ) and Ω − ( t ) , are the limit as ε → 0 of Ω + ε ( t ) and Ω − ε ( t ) , respectively , with Ω + ( t ) being the cell region . 5 Outer expansions . We assume the following expansions in the outer region Ω ε ( t ) : φ ε ( x , t ) = φ 0 ( x , t ) + εφ 1 ( x , t ) + ε 2 φ 2 ( x , t ) + · · · , u ε ( x , t ) = u 0 ( x , t ) + εu 1 ( x , t ) + ε 2 u 2 ( x , t ) + · · · , v ε ( x , t ) = v 0 ( x , t ) + εv 1 ( x , t ) + ε 2 v 2 ( x , t ) + · · · , where the functions φ i ( x , t ) , u i ( x , t ) , and v i ( x , t ) ( i = 0 , 1 , . . . ) are smooth and bounded , and are independent of ε . They also satisfy the boundary conditions φ i = u i = v i = 0 on ∂ Ω . Note that these functions are diﬀerent from those in the expansions with a diﬀerent time scale τ . Since φ 0 = O ( ε 2 ) in Ω − ε ( t ) , there will be no equations for u ε and v ε at leading order O ( 1 ) , we shall assume that u ε = 0 and v ε = 0 in Ω − ε ( t ) . If we plug the above expansion of φ ε , u ε , and v ε into ( 2 . 1 ) , ( 2 . 2 ) , and ( 2 . 3 ) , we obtain by a series of calculations that , up to the leading order O ( 1 ) , ∂ t u 0 = D 1 ∆ u 0 + f ( u 0 , v 0 ) in Ω + ( t ) × ( 0 , ∞ ) , ( 2 . 5 ) ∂ t v 0 = D 2 ∆ v 0 + g ( u 0 , v 0 ) in Ω + ( t ) + × ( 0 , ∞ ) . ( 2 . 6 ) Local coordinates for the inner region . Let x ∈ I ε ( t ) and denote by s ( x , t ) the signed distance from x to Γ ( t ) , with s ( x , t ) > 0 if x is inside Γ ( t ) and s ( x , t ) < 0 otherwise . Note that s ( x , t ) = O ( ε ) and | ∇ s ( x , t ) | = 1 . Now , let y = P ( x , t ) ∈ Γ ( t ) be the projection of x onto Γ ( t ) , deﬁned by | x − P ( x , t ) | = | s ( x , t ) | . ( We use | · | to denote both the absolute value of a number and the Euclidean norm of a vector . ) For 0 < ε (cid:28) 1 , the projection y = P ( x , t ) ∈ Γ ( t ) is unique , and the vector x − P ( x , t ) is normal to the surface Γ ( t ) at y = P ( x , t ) . Let z = s ( x , t ) / ε . Let n = n ( y , t ) = ∇ s ( y , t ) be the unit normal at y ∈ Γ ( t ) pointing from the exterior to the interior of Γ ( t ) . Then we have a unique expression of x ∈ I ε ( t ) as x = y + εzn . ( 2 . 7 ) We call ( y , z ) the local coordinate of x ∈ I ε ( t ) with respect to the surface Γ ( t ) . We have for 0 < ε (cid:28) 1 that [ 8 , 9 , 15 , 26 , 29 ] ∇ x z = ε − 1 n ( y , t ) + O ( 1 ) , ( 2 . 8 ) ∆ x z = 2 ε − 1 H ( y , t ) + O ( 1 ) , ( 2 . 9 ) ∂ t z = − ε − 1 V ( y , t ) , ( 2 . 10 ) ∇ x y j ( x , t ) · n ( y , t ) = 0 ( j = 1 , 2 , 3 ) , ( 2 . 11 ) where H ( y , t ) is the mean curvature of the surface Γ ( t ) at the point y = P ( x , t ) , V ( y , t ) is the normal velocity of the point y = P ( x , t ) ∈ Γ ( t ) deﬁned by V ( y , t ) = ∂ t y · n ( y , t ) = ∂ t P ( x , t ) · n ( y , t ) , ( 2 . 12 ) and y j ( j = 1 , 2 , 3 ) are the components of y = y ( x , t ) . Let f = f ( x , t ) and ˜ f = ˜ f ( z , y , t ) be smooth functions such that f ( x , t ) = ˜ f ( z , y , t ) with x ∈ I ε ( t ) and ( y , z ) related by ( 2 . 7 ) . Then , by ( 2 . 8 ) – ( 2 . 12 ) and the chain rule , we obtain for 0 < ε (cid:28) 1 that [ 8 , 9 , 15 , 26 , 29 ] ∇ x f ( x , t ) = ε − 1 n ∂ z ˜ f ( y , z , t ) + O ( 1 ) , ( 2 . 13 ) 6 ∆ x f ( x , t ) = (cid:0) ε − 1 2 H ( y , t ) ∂ z + ε − 2 ∂ 2 zz (cid:1) ˜ f ( y , z , t ) + O ( 1 ) , ( 2 . 14 ) ∂ t f ( x , t ) = − ε − 1 V ( y , t ) ∂ z ˜ f ( y , z , t ) + O ( 1 ) . ( 2 . 15 ) Inner expansions . We now assume that following expansions in the inner region I ε ( t ) : φ ε ( x , t ) = ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) + ε ˜ φ 1 ( y , z , t ) + ε 2 ˜ φ 2 ( y , z , t ) + · · · , u ε ( x , t ) = ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) + ε ˜ u 1 ( y , z , t ) + ε 2 ˜ u 2 ( y , z , t ) + · · · , v ε ( x , t ) = ˜ v 0 ( y , z , t ) + ε ˜ v 1 ( y , z , t ) + ε 2 ˜ v 2 ( y , z , t ) + · · · , where x ∈ I ε ( t ) and ( y , z ) are related by ( 2 . 7 ) , and all ˜ φ i = ˜ φ i ( y , z , t ) , ˜ u i = ˜ u i ( y , z , t ) , and ˜ v i = ˜ v i ( y , z , t ) ( i = 0 , 1 , . . . ) are smooth and bounded functions . Let us substitute φ ε , u ε , and v ε in ( 2 . 1 ) – ( 2 . 3 ) with these expansions . By ( 2 . 13 ) – ( 2 . 15 ) and a series of calculations , we obtain − ε − 1 V ∂ z ˜ φ 0 = ε − 1 h ( u 0 , v 0 ) (cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12) ∂ z ˜ φ 0 (cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12) + ε − 2 γ (cid:104) ∂ zz ˜ φ 0 − W (cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) (cid:105) + ε − 1 γ (cid:104) 2 H∂ z ˜ φ 0 + ∂ zz ˜ φ 1 − W (cid:48)(cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) ˜ φ 1 (cid:105) + O ( 1 ) , where V = V ( y , t ) and H = H ( y , t ) are the normal velocity and mean curvature , respectively , at y = P ( x , t ) . Note that , unlike φ ε which varies from 0 to 1 , the concentration ﬁelds u ε and v ε should not vary largely , in the inner region . In particular , we have ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) = ˜ u 0 ( y , 0 , t ) + O ( ε ) and ˜ v 0 ( y , z , t ) = ˜ v 0 ( y , 0 , t ) + O ( ε ) , as | x − y | = | x − P ( x , t ) | = O ( ε ) for any x ∈ I ε ( t ) with the local coordinate ( y , z ) . Therefore , we obtain from the above equation that − ε − 1 V ∂ z ˜ φ 0 = ε − 1 h ( ˜ u 0 ( y , 0 , t ) , ˜ v 0 ( y , 0 , t ) ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∂ z ˜ φ 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) + ε − 2 γ (cid:104) ∂ zz ˜ φ 0 − W (cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) (cid:105) + ε − 1 γ (cid:104) 2 H∂ z ˜ φ 0 + ∂ zz ˜ φ 1 − W (cid:48)(cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) ˜ φ 1 (cid:105) + O ( 1 ) . Now , equating the terms with the same order O ( ε − 2 ) and O ( ε − 1 ) , respectively , we get O ( ε − 2 ) : 0 = ∂ zz ˜ φ 0 − W (cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) , ( 2 . 16 ) O ( ε − 1 ) : − V ∂ z ˜ φ 0 = h ( ˜ u 0 ( y , 0 , t ) , ˜ v 0 ( y , 0 , t ) ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∂ z ˜ φ 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) + γ (cid:104) 2 H∂ z ˜ φ 0 + ∂ zz ˜ φ 1 − W (cid:48)(cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) ˜ φ 1 (cid:105) . ( 2 . 17 ) Similarly , we can plug the inner expansions of φ ε , u ε , and v ε into ( 2 . 2 ) and ( 2 . 3 ) to get in the leading order that O (cid:0) ε − 2 (cid:1) : 0 = D 1 (cid:16) ∂ z ˜ φ 0 ∂ z ˜ u 0 + ˜ φ 0 ∂ zz ˜ u 0 (cid:17) , ( 2 . 18 ) O (cid:0) ε − 2 (cid:1) : 0 = D 2 (cid:16) ∂ z ˜ φ 0 ∂ z ˜ v 0 + ˜ φ 0 ∂ zz ˜ v 0 (cid:17) . ( 2 . 19 ) Inner - outer matching and the sharp - interface limit . Since in the outer region φ ε = O ( ε 2 ) in Ω − ε ( t ) and φ ε = 1 + O ( ε 2 ) in Ω + ε ( t ) , we have the following matching conditions for the leading - order terms of the inner and outer solutions of the phase ﬁeld φ ε : lim z →−∞ ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) = 0 and lim z →∞ ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) = 1 . ( 2 . 20 ) 7 These , together with ( 2 . 16 ) , determine completely ˜ φ 0 to be ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) = 1 2 + e 3 z − e − 3 z 2 ( e 3 z + e − 3 z ) ∀ z ∈ R . In particular , ˜ φ 0 does not depend on y and t . One can verify that ∂ z ˜ φ 0 > 0 and that (cid:90) ∞ −∞ ( ∂ z ˜ φ 0 ) 2 d z = 1 . ( 2 . 21 ) By matching the inner expansion and outer expansion , we have ∂ z ˜ φ 0 ( ±∞ ) = ∂ zz ˜ φ 0 ( ±∞ ) = 0 . Thus , by integration by parts and ( 2 . 16 ) , we have (cid:90) ∞ −∞ ∂ z ˜ φ 0 (cid:104) ∂ zz ˜ φ 1 − W (cid:48)(cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) ˜ φ 1 (cid:105) dz = (cid:90) ∞ −∞ ∂ z (cid:104) ∂ zz ˜ φ 0 − W (cid:48) ( ˜ φ 0 ) (cid:105) ˜ φ 1 d z = 0 . ( 2 . 22 ) Now , by multiplying both sides of ( 2 . 17 ) by ∂ z ˜ φ 0 and then integrating the resulting equation over z ∈ ( −∞ , ∞ ) , we have by ( 2 . 21 ) and ( 2 . 22 ) that V ( y , t ) = − h ( u 0 ( y , 0 , t ) , v 0 ( y , 0 , t ) ) − 2 γH ( y , t ) ∀ y ∈ Γ ( t ) . ( 2 . 23 ) It follows from ( 2 . 18 ) and ( 2 . 19 ) that ∂ z ( ˜ φ 0 ∂ z ˜ u 0 ) = 0 and ∂ z ( ˜ φ 0 ∂ z ˜ v 0 ) = 0 for all z ∈ R . These and the matching conditions ( 2 . 20 ) imply that 0 = lim z →−∞ ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) ∂ z ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) = lim z →∞ ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) ∂ z ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) = lim z →∞ ∂ z ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) , 0 = lim z →−∞ ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) ∂ z ˜ v 0 ( y , z , t ) = lim z →∞ ˜ φ 0 ( y , z , t ) ∂ z ˜ v 0 ( y , z , t ) = lim z →∞ ∂ z ˜ v 0 ( y , z , t ) . Matching the inner expansions and outer expansions , we thus have ∂ n u 0 ( x , t ) = lim z →∞ ∂ z ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) = 0 ∀ x ∈ Γ ( t ) , ( 2 . 24 ) ∂ n v 0 ( x , t ) = lim z →∞ ∂ z ˜ u 0 ( y , z , t ) = 0 ∀ x ∈ Γ ( t ) , ( 2 . 25 ) where u 0 and v 0 are the leading - order terms in the outer expansion of u ε and v ε , and satisfy ( 2 . 5 ) and ( 2 . 6 ) , respectively . We summarize our analysis in the following : Theorem 2 . 1 . Under the assumption that there exists a closed and smooth interface Γ ( t ) , the outer and inner expansions above for the solutions φ ε , u ε , and v ε are valid , and the corresponding matching conditions are satisﬁed , the following hold true in the limit ε → 0 : ( 1 ) The phase - ﬁeld function φ ε converges to 1 in Ω + ( t ) and 0 in Ω − ( t ) , respectively ; ( 2 ) The concentrations u ε and v ε converge to the solution to the boundary - value problem of the reaction - diﬀusion equations ( 2 . 5 ) and ( 2 . 6 ) , and ( 2 . 24 ) and ( 2 . 25 ) ; ( 3 ) The normal velocity V = V ( x , t ) of the sharp cell boundary Γ ( t ) is given by ( 2 . 23 ) . 8 3 Numerical Methods We describe our numerical methods for solving the system of equations ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) in the following non - dimensionalized form for the rescaled normal velocity V = V ( x , y , t ) on the rescaled cell boundary Γ ( t ) at time t , rescaled concentrations u = u ( x , y , t ) and v = v ( x , y , t ) deﬁned on the cell region Ω + ( t ) , respectively : V = u − u ∗ − χH for ( x , y ) ∈ Γ ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 3 . 1 ) ∂ t u = D u ∆ u + f ( u , v ) for ( x , y ) ∈ Ω + ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 3 . 2 ) ∂ t v = D v ∆ v − f ( u , v ) for ( x , y ) ∈ Ω + ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 3 . 3 ) ∂ n u = ∂ n v = 0 for ( x , y ) ∈ Γ ( t ) and t > 0 , ( 3 . 4 ) where H is the rescaled curvature , all u ∗ , χ , D u , D v , K , and C are positive constants , and f ( u , v ) = − Ku ( u − 0 . 5 ) ( u − Cv ) . Details of the non - dimensionalization are given in section 4 . 1 below . We solve these equations in two - dimensional space . Our numerical methods for the one - species system , which is the sharp - interface limit of the system ( 1 . 7 ) – ( 1 . 9 ) , are similar . We set our computational box to be Ω = ( − L , L ) 2 for some L > 0 and cover it with a uniform ﬁnite - diﬀerence grid with stepsize h in each dimension . We discretize a time interval [ 0 , T ] with T > 0 the ﬁnal time of interest by t m = m ∆ t ( m = 0 , 1 , . . . ) with time step ∆ t > 0 . We denote by Γ m , Ω + m , and Ω − m the approximation of Γ ( t m ) , Ω + ( t m ) , and Ω − ( t m ) , respectively , where Ω − ( t ) is the rescaled outer region . For a function w = w ( x , y , t ) with ( x , y ) ∈ Ω and t ≥ 0 , we denote by w m = w m ( x , y ) the approximation of w ( x , y , t m ) , and by w mi , j the approximation of w m ( x i , y j ) for a grid point ( x i , y j ) or the center ( x i , y j ) of a grid cell . Note that we approximate the level - set function φ at grid points while we approximate the concentrations u and v at the centers of grid cells ; see below . The Level - set method for the moving cell boundary . We capture the cell boundary Γ ( t ) at time t by using the level - set method [ 22 , 23 ] , with level - set function φ = φ ( x , y , t ) , i . e . , Γ ( t ) = { ( x , y ) ∈ Ω : φ ( x , y , t ) = 0 } . The level - set function is determined by the evolution equation ∂ t φ + V | ∇ φ | = 0 , where V = V ( x , y , t ) is given in ( 3 . 1 ) that needs to be extended from Γ ( t ) to the entire computational domain Ω . The ﬁrst part of our normal velocity is u ( x , y , t ) − u ∗ . We keep the value of u = u ( x , y , t ) in Ω + ( t ) and additionally extend it from Γ ( t ) to Ω − ( t ) numerically in each step of time iteration . Note , for convenience , we continue to denote the result by u = u ( x , y , t ) , now for ( x , y ) ∈ Ω . ( Details of such extension are given below . ) The curvature H can be extended simply by using H = ∇ · ( ∇ φ / | ∇ φ | ) for all ( x , y ) ∈ Ω . Note that implicitly we require that the level - set function to be close to the signed distance to the interface Γ ( t ) with φ < 0 in Ω + ( t ) ( the cell region ) and φ > 0 in Ω − ( t ) , at least near Γ ( t ) Therefore , the level - set equation and boundary conditions become now ∂ t φ = − ( u − u ∗ ) | ∇ φ | + χ (cid:0) ∇ · ∇ φ | ∇ φ | (cid:1) | ∇ φ | for ( x , y ) ∈ Ω and t > 0 , ( 3 . 5 ) ∂ n φ = 0 for ( x , y ) ∈ ∂ Ω and t > 0 . ( 3 . 6 ) 9 Following [ 32 ] , we rewrite the curvature part of the normal velocity as ∇ · (cid:18) ∇ φ | ∇ φ | (cid:19) | ∇ φ | = ∆ φ − N ( φ ) , N ( φ ) = ∇ φ | ∇ φ | · ∇ ( | ∇ φ | ) = φ 2 x φ xx + 2 φ x φ y φ xy + φ 2 y φ yy φ 2 x + φ 2 y . With a given initial level - set function φ ( x , y , 0 ) for all ( x , y ) ∈ Ω , we can solve ( 3 . 5 ) and ( 3 . 6 ) numerically with ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes in time and over the uniform grid . Speciﬁcally , starting from u mi , j at centers of grid cells , we ﬁrst use polynomial interpolations or extrapolations to approximate u at points where the interface intersects grid lines , itself computed using linear interpolation on values of φ at grid points . We then extend these values from the points on the interface to all the grid points in the outer region Ω + m , constant in the normal direction , by the fast sweeping method [ 34 , 36 ] . We continue to denote the extended function by u m . To then get φ m + 1 , we use the semi - implicit scheme φ m + 1 − φ m ∆ t = − ( u m − u ∗ ) | ∇ φ m | + χ ∆ φ m + 1 − χN (cid:15) ( φ m ) , ( 3 . 7 ) where N (cid:15) ( φ ) is the same as N ( φ m ) except the denominator φ 2 x + φ 2 y in N ( φ ) is replaced by φ 2 x + φ 2 y + (cid:15) in N (cid:15) ( φ ) for a small enough (cid:15) > 0 , to avoid singularities at ∇ φ = 0 while keeping an accurate approximation away from them . We discretize | ∇ φ m | by ﬁfth - order WENO [ 10 ] within Godunov’s scheme [ 24 ] , and discretize ∆ φ and N (cid:15) ( φ ) by second - order central diﬀerencing . At the boundary of the computational domain Ω , we use a second - order scheme to dis - cretize the Neumann boundary conditions ( 3 . 6 ) . The coeﬃcient matrix of the resulting system of linear equations for all φ m + 1 i , j is sparse and nonsymmetric , with the nonsymmetry due mainly to the chosen treatment of the boundary conditions . We solve the linear system of equations using the biconjugate gradient stabilized method preconditioned with the in - complete LU decomposition . Finally , we reinitialize the level - set function φ m + 1 , performing a few iterations of the algorithm of redistancing to signed distance function [ 33 ] , and continue to denote the result by φ m + 1 . Discretization of the reaction - diﬀusion equations on a moving cell region . Given Γ m + 1 , Ω + m + 1 , and Ω − m + 1 , all speciﬁed by the level - set function φ m + 1 on all the grid points , and also given the concentrations u m and v m on all the centers in Ω + m of grid cells , we need to ﬁnd the approximate solution u m + 1 and v m + 1 on all the centers of grid cells that overlap with Ω + m + 1 by the equations and boundary conditions ( 3 . 4 ) . To do so , we ﬁrst employ a second - order extrapolation method proposed in [ 12 ] to extend u m and v m to the centers of grid cells that overlap with the new cell region Ω + m + 1 but are not in Ω + m ; cf . black solid dotes in Figure 3 . 1 . We denote by ˜ u mi , j and ˜ v mi , j the original or an extended u - value and v - value at the center of a grid cell in Ω + m + 1 labelled by ( i , j ) . Note by ( 3 . 2 ) – ( 3 . 4 ) that the integral of u + v over Ω is a constant with respect to time t ( cf . ( 1 . 6 ) ) , and its value is determined by the initial concentrations u and v at t = 0 . We shall still denote this constant by M . To enforce this conservation of the total mass , we modify the value ˜ v mi , j to get v mi , j at centers of all the grid cells overlapping with Ω + m + 1 by 10 v mi , j = 1 Area ( Ω + m + 1 ) (cid:34) M − (cid:90) Ω + m + 1 ( ˜ u m + ˜ v m ) dA (cid:35) + ˜ v mi , j . The ﬁnally extended u and v values are now denoted by u mi , j and v mi , j ; they are deﬁned on centers labelled by ( i , j ) of grid cells overlapping with Ω + m + 1 . Γ m + 1 Γ m III II I Figure 3 . 1 : Illustration of two consecutive cell regions Ω + m and Ω + m + 1 . The cell region Ω + m is the union of part II and part III , enclosed by the cell boundary Γ m ( blue curve ) . The cell region Ω + m + 1 is the union of part I and part II , marked by red . Black solid dots mark those centers of grid cells that are in Ω + m + 1 but not in Ω + m . We now focus on u m + 1 as v m + 1 is similar . We use the semi - implicit scheme u m + 1 − u m ∆ t = D u ∆ u m + 1 + f ( u m , v m ) for ( x , y ) ∈ Ω + m + 1 . Since the interface Γ m + 1 cuts through grid cells , we employ an embedded boundary method developed in [ 25 ] to discretize the Laplacian operator . Fix a grid cell C i , j that overlaps with Ω + m + 1 and that is centered at ( x i , y j ) . Integrating both sides of the above equation over C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 , we have by the divergence theorem that (cid:90) C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 u m + 1 − u m ∆ t dA = D u (cid:90) ∂ ( C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 ) ∇ u m + 1 · ν dl + (cid:90) C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 f ( u m , v m ) dA , ( 3 . 8 ) where ν is the unit vector normal to the boundary ∂ ( C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 ) . The two area integrals can be approximated by (cid:90) C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 u m + 1 − u m ∆ t dA ≈ u m + 1 i , j − u m i , j ∆ t Area ( C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 ) , ( 3 . 9 ) (cid:90) C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 f ( u m , v m ) dA ≈ f ( u mi , j , v mi , j ) Area ( C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 ) . ( 3 . 10 ) 11 The area can be calculated using the level - set function φ m + 1 [ 17 ] . Whether or not the interface Γ m + 1 cuts through the grid cell C i , j , by the boundary condition ∂ n u m + 1 = 0 on Γ m + 1 , we can approximate the line integral in ( 3 . 8 ) by [ 25 ] (cid:90) ∂ ( C i , j ∩ Ω + m + 1 ) ∇ u m + 1 · ν dl ≈ u m + 1 i + 1 , j − u m + 1 i , j h L i + 1 / 2 , j − u m + 1 i , j − u m + 1 i − 1 , j h L i − 1 / 2 , j + u m + 1 i , j + 1 − u m + 1 i , j h L i , j + 1 / 2 − u m + 1 i , j − u m + 1 i , j − 1 h L i , j − 1 / 2 , ( 3 . 11 ) where L i ± 1 / 2 , j ∈ [ 0 , h ] and L i , j ± 1 / 2 ∈ [ 0 , h ] refer to the length of the corresponding edge of the grid cell C i , j inside Ω + m + 1 . These lengths can be calculated using the level - set function φ m + 1 that deﬁnes the interface Γ m + 1 [ 17 ] . The coeﬃcient matrix of the resulting system of linear equations is symmetric positive deﬁnite [ 25 ] , and the system can be solved by the conjugate gradient method with an incom - plete Cholesky preconditioner or by an algebraic multigrid method . Algorithm . Step 0 . Input all the parameters . Set the computational box Ω = ( − L , L ) 2 ⊂ R 2 and cover it with a uniform ﬁnite - diﬀerence grid with grid sizes h . Discretize the time interval [ 0 , T ] of interest with time step ∆ t . Initialize the level - set function φ 0 and the concentrations u 0 and v 0 . Set m = 0 . Step 1 . Extend the normal velocity from the interface to the entire computational box . Solve the semi - implicit discretization equation ( 3 . 7 ) to get the updated level - set function φ m + 1 . Reinitialize the level - set function and still denote it by φ m + 1 . Step 2 . Extend u m and v m to centers of grid cells overlapping with Ω + m + 1 deﬁned by φ m + 1 . Solving the semi - implicit discretization equations ( cf . ( 3 . 8 ) – ( 3 . 11 ) ) to obtain u m + 1 and v m + 1 . Step 3 . Check if the cell region Ω + m + 1 touches the boundary ∂ Ω . If so , shift the computational box so that the cell is centered in the new computational box , still denoted Ω . Step 4 . Set m : = m + 1 . Repeat Steps 1 – 3 until the ﬁnal simulation time is reached . Convergence test . We have tested our numerical methods and code . In Figure 3 . 2 , we show that the total mass conservation is captured numerically in a long time simulation . We have also used our numerical methods to simulate a moving cell with the ﬁnal ( rescaled ) time being T = 10 , using diﬀerent time steps and diﬀerent spatial grid sizes . Figure 3 . 3 shows our simulation results . They indicate that our numerical method and algo - rithm converge both in time and space . 4 Simulation Results and Analysis We perform numerical simulations to study the cell polarization in response to various ex - ternal stimulus and the trajectory of a moving cell , and analyze these simulation results in terms of the modelling and parameters . 12 Figure 3 . 2 : Numerical conservation of total mass . Here U = U ( t ) and V = V ( t ) at time t are deﬁned as the integral of u ( x , y , t ) and v ( x , y , t ) , respectively , over the cell region Ω + ( t ) , and the total mass is deﬁned to be the sum U + V . 4 . 1 Parameters and Non - dimensionalization In Table 1 , we collect all the parameters in the original model ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) , and describe their meanings and units . We also provide their estimated values following [ 6 , 31 ] .

One is the typical cell speed V 0 which is in the range ∼ 0 . 1 µ m / s . The other is the typical radius of a cell R which is in the range ∼ 10 µ m . We then introduce non - dimensionalized pa - rameters according to Table 2 . We now deﬁne ˆ x = x / R , ˆ t = ( V 0 / R ) t , ˆ u = u / c , ˆ v = v / c , and (cid:98) V = V / V 0 , and convert the original system of equations ( 1 . 1 ) – ( 1 . 4 ) into the non - dimensionalized system of equations for (cid:98) V , ˆ u , and ˆ v , which is , after dropping all the hat , the system ( 3 . 1 ) – ( 3 . 4 ) . 13 Figure 3 . 3 : Simulated cell shapes with the ﬁnal simulation otime T = 10 .

We also take the total amount of proteins ( i . e . , the total mass of the two species ) to be M = 6 after nondimensionalization . The computational box is Ω = ( − 2 . 5 , 2 . 5 ) × ( − 2 . 5 , 2 . 5 ) . Note that Ω + ⊂ Ω . We cover Ω by uniform ﬁnite - diﬀerence grid of grid size h = 0 . 05 . Other parameters are taken as (cid:52) t = 0 . 001 , D u = 0 . 3 , D v = 30 , K = 500 , and C = 0 . 8 . Random initial value . We choose the initial value u 0 = u ( · , 0 ) to be a random variable deﬁned on all the grid centers . The values are generated uniformly at random from [ 0 , 0 . 8 ] . We also set the initial value v 0 = v ( · , 0 ) to be a constant , which is 1 . 342 in our case with total mass M = 6 . We then solve numerically the reaction - diﬀusion equations with the zero Neumann boundary conditions . 14 Figure 4 . 1 ( a ) shows the cell region bounded by the blue curve . The red region inside the cell is the set of points at which the initial random concentration value u 0 ≥ 0 . 5 . Figure 4 . 1 ( b ) shows the part of the cell region , marked by the closed red curve , at which the concentration u ≥ 0 . 5 . This shows that the cell is polarized at this ( rescaled ) time t = 0 . 5 . As discussed in [ 6 , 11 ] , the reaction - diﬀusion system tends to minimize the length of the interface that separates the high and low u - concentration regions . Figure 4 . 1 ( c ) shows that at t = 2 the interface between the high and low u - concentration regions does not change , indicating the cell polarization reaches an equilibrium [ 20 ] . Figure 4 . 1 : Cell polarization with a random initial value u 0 . ( a ) Cell region bounded by the blue curve . A random initial concentration ﬁeld u 0 is distributed at grid points inside the cell region . Red spot is the set of points at which u 0 ≥ 0 . 5 . ( b ) At t = 0 . 5 , the region of u ≥ 0 . 5 , bounded by the red curves , is located in the front of the cell , showing a polarized cell . ( c ) At t = 2 , the cell polarization has reached an equilibrium . External stimulus . We introduce an external stimulus and solve the system of equations ∂ t u = D u ∆ u + f ( u , v ) + Sv in Ω + × ( 0 , T ] , ∂ t v = D v ∆ v − f ( u , v ) − Sv in Ω + × ( 0 , T ] , with the same boundary conditions ∂ n u = ∂ n v = 0 on ∂ Ω + and a ﬁnal simulation time T . The stimulus function is Sv with S deﬁned on Ω + × [ 0 , T ] by S = S ( x , y , t ) =    s 1 ( t ) ( 1 . 3 − y ) ( 0 . 7 − x ) if ( x , y , t ) ∈ Ω + × [ 0 , 1 ] , s 2 ( t ) ( y + 1 . 3 ) ( x + 0 . 7 ) if ( x , y , t ) ∈ Ω + × [ 10 , 11 ] , 0 elsewhere , where s 1 ( t ) =   0 . 07 if 0 ≤ t ≤ 0 . 5 , 0 . 07 ( 1 − t − 0 . 5 0 . 5 ) if 0 . 5 < t ≤ 1 , 0 elsewhere , and s 2 ( t ) = (cid:40) s 1 ( t − 10 ) if 10 ≤ t ≤ 11 , 0 elsewhere . Note that the stimulus is strong in certain region of the cell during the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and is strong in a diﬀerent region of the cell during 10 ≤ t ≤ 11 . We set the initial values of u and v to be constant and solve the reaction - diﬀusion equa - tions with the stimulus up to the ﬁnal simulation time T = 20 . When the locally strong 15 stimulus is turned on from t = 0 to t = 1 , the active form u increases locally near the south - west corner . Such increase then leads to the formation of a spatial interface in the cell , separating the high and low concentrations of the active form u , that propagates in - side the cell region . Meanwhile , the concentration v of the inactive form decreases , leading accordingly to the decreasing of u + = Cv in the kinetic form of f . As a result , the mo - tion of the internal interface slows down , and is ﬁnally pinned down , and the cell reaches a polarized steady state [ 20 ] . Figure 4 . 2 ( a ) shows such a polarized state at t = 10 . The cell is re - polarized , with a reversed orientation , after the stimulus is turned on again during 10 ≤ t ≤ 11 but strong in a diﬀerent spatial region of the cell ; cf . Figure 4 . 2 ( b ) . Figure 4 . 2 : A stimulus , strong in a local region of the cell , is applied to the initially homo - geneous state during 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and then turned oﬀ during 1 < t < 10 . The stimulus , strong in a diﬀerent region of the cell , is later turned on during 10 ≤ t ≤ 11 and turned oﬀ again after t = 11 till the ﬁnal simulation time T = 20 . ( a ) At t = 10 , the cell is polarized . ( b ) At t = 20 , the cell is polarized again but with a reversed orientation . 4 . 3 Cell Trajectory We deﬁne the cell trajectory of a moving cell to be the time trajectory of the geometrical center of the cell ( X c ( t ) , Y c ( t ) ) , which is deﬁned by X c ( t ) = 1 Area ( Ω + ( t ) ) (cid:90) Ω + ( t ) x dxdy and Y c ( t ) = 1 Area ( Ω + ( t ) ) (cid:90) Ω + ( t ) y dxdy . We study two typical types of trajectories , straight and circular trajectories , aiming at a qualitative understanding of controlling parameters for such trajectories . We shall also compare the two - species and one - species models in terms of the prediction of diﬀerent trajectories . In all the simulations reported below , the initial cell region is a circle of radius 1 . 3 , which is centered at ( 0 , − 1 ) , with a radius 1 . 3 . The cell is polarized with the concentration of u to be 0 . 8 where y ≥ − 0 . 8 , and u = 0 in the remaining part , while v is uniformly distributed on the cell domain , with the total mass M = 6 . We also set the kinetic parameters K = 100 and C = 0 . 8 , the grid size h = 0 . 06 and time step ∆ t = 0 . 005 . Long - time trajectories . We simulate a moving cell with two diﬀerent sets of parameters D u , D v , and χ , and plot the cell trajectory in Figure 4 . 3 . We observe clearly a straight trajectory ( cf . Figure 4 . 3 ( a ) and ( b ) ) and the circular trajectory ( cf . Figure 4 . 3 ( c ) and ( d ) ) . Note that the parameters we use in these simulations are similar to those used in [ 6 ] 16 to capture both the straight and circular trajectories as in Figure 4 . 3 with the ﬁnal time t = 40 while here we have simulated the cell movement up to t = 150 , indicating that the two patterns are persistent , and the model and our methods are robust . Figure 4 . 3 : Long - time cell movement simulations . In ( a ) and ( b ) , D u = 0 . 1 , D v = 10 , χ = 0 . 2 , and u ∗ = 0 . 2 . In ( c ) and ( d ) , D u = 0 . 5 , D v = 50 , χ = 0 . 1 , and u ∗ = 0 . 25 . The sequence of snapshots of cells in ( a ) are taken at t = 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and those in ( c ) are taken at t = 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 . The blue line or curve in ( b ) or ( d ) is the space - time cell trajectory , while the red line or curve in ( b ) or ( d ) , marked “projection” is the ( two - dimensional ) space trajectory of the moving cell . Eﬀects of diﬀusion . We now set χ = 0 . 1 and u ∗ = 0 . 4 , and vary the diﬀusion constants D u and D v to study how the diﬀusion can aﬀect the cell movement . In Figure 4 . 4 , we plot our simulation results for three sets of diﬀusion constants : case 1 : D u = 0 . 1 and D v = 10 ; case 2 : D u = 0 . 3 and D v = 30 ; case 3 : D u = 0 . 5 and D v = 50 . In Figure 4 . 4 ( a ) , we observe that the cell trajectory is linear ( or straight ) for case 1 , while it is circular for case 2 and case 3 . Note that the plot in the window is the zoom - in of the long - time trajectories for case 2 and case 3 . In all the three cases , there is a preparation time before the cell starts to move in a straight line for case 1 or in a circular pattern for case 2 and case 3 . In Figure 4 . 4 ( b1 ) – ( b3 ) , we plot the x and y components of the velocity at the geometrical center of the moving cell corresponding to the three cases , respectively . We observe that larger diﬀusion constants correspond to a shorter preparation time before the onset of the linear or circular trajectory . Moreover , fast diﬀusion is correlated to a smaller circular trajectory . Contractility . This refers to the cell contraction due to the decreasing of concentration u the rear part of the cell . In the model , the cell contractility is determined by the threshold 17 Figure 4 . 4 : ( a ) Cell trajectories predicted with three diﬀerent sets of diﬀusion constants D u and D v . The small window is the zoom - in of the two circular trajectories . ( b1 ) – ( b3 ) The x and y components of the velocity at the center of a moving cell predicted by our numerical simulations corresponding to the three sets of D u and D v values marked in ( a ) . concentration u ∗ . To study how the variation of u ∗ can aﬀect the cell trajectory , we ﬁx the diﬀusion constants D u = 0 . 4 and D v = 40 and the rescaled surface tension constant χ = 0 . 1 , and simulate the cell movement with diﬀerent values of u ∗ : 0 . 25 , 0 . 3 , and 0 . 4 . Figure 4 . 5 ( a ) shows the three circular trajectories corresponding to the three u ∗ values . We observe that a larger value of u ∗ corresponds to an earlier onset of the circular mode and the circle is smaller . Figure 4 . 5 ( b1 ) – ( b3 ) show the area of the moving cell vs . time for the three sets of u ∗ values as marked in Figure 4 . 5 ( a ) . We observe again that a larger value of u ∗ takes a shorter period of time before circulates . Figure 4 . 5 : ( a ) Cell trajectories corresponding to the three values of u ∗ .

We simulate the cell movement with both the two - species model and the one - species model , in non - dimensionalized forms . We use the 18 same set of parameters including the same diﬀusion constant 0 . 1 for the active form u . For the two - species model , we set the diﬀusion constant D v = 10 , this corresponds to the large - diﬀusion approximation in the one - species model . While the simpliﬁed , one - species model can can capture the leading - order behaviour of the system [ 21 ] , it may be diﬀerent from the full , two - species model in predicting quantitatively some of the biophysical properties of a moving cell . In Figure 4 . 6 , we see that the two - species model predicts a linear trajectory ( left ) , while the one - species model predicts a circular trajectory ( right ) . Figure 4 . 6 : With nearly identical parameters , simulations predict a linear trajectory with the two - species model ( left ) , and a circular trajectory with the one - species model ( right ) . 5 Conclusions We have studied the cell polarity and movement within the modelling framework of reaction - diﬀusion equations and moving cell boundary . In particular , we have carefully examined the wave - pinning model , both the two - species and the reduced one - species model . Early studies included the one - dimensional analysis of the wave pinning mechanism [ 20 , 21 ] and the two - dimensional phase - ﬁled simulation and the sharp - interface analysis with a reduced model for cell polarization and movement [ 6 ] . Here , we have derived the sharp - interface model as the limit of the phase - ﬁeld model as the small parameter ε → 0 with a general two or three - dimensional setting . Our rigorous analysis provides a close link between the two types of models . We have also developed and implemented a robust numerical method for the simulation of cell polarization and movement using the derived sharp - interface model in two - dimensional space . Our approach combines the level - set method for the moving cell boundary and accu - rate discretization techniques for solving the reaction - diﬀusion equations on the moving cell region . The method and algorithm pass the convergence test . We have done extensive numerical simulations using the full , two - species reaction - diﬀusion moving cell boundary model as well as its reduced one - species model in two space dimension . We ﬁnd that the cell polarization is a robust process that can be triggered by various external stimulus with a large set of parameters , conﬁrming the wave - pinning mechanism as proposed in [ 20 , 21 ] . We have also traced the cell trajectory during long - time simulations . By choosing diﬀerent set of parameters of the diﬀusion constants and the threshold value of the concen - 19 tration of an active Rho GTPase protein in the normal velocity , we have been able to capture both the linear and circular trajectories . For a circular trajectory , a period of preparation time is observed . The full , two - species model and the reduced , single - species model predict diﬀerent such preparation times . Therefore , the inﬁnite diﬀusion of the second species which is the assumption of the reduce model , may need to be corrected for quantitative predictions of diﬀerent complex process of cell motility . In our simulations we have observed that the cell area and the x and y components of the velocity at center of mass of the cell to be oscillatory during the period of preparation time before the cell starts to rotate completely ; cf . Figure 4 . 4 and Figure 4 . 5 . These are unlikely caused by numerical errors and instabilities as no such oscillations occur once the cell starts to rotate . We will investigate such oscillations further in our subsequent works . With our analytical tools , robust numerical methods , and computer code , we can study further the cell polarity and movement in several directions . ( 1 ) We can include many more biological components in our models and simulation . The ﬁrst of them is the ﬂuid ﬂow which can be modelled by Stokes ﬂow [ 30 , 35 ] . The boundary velocity of a cell moving around within such a ﬂow can be determined by the force balance . The second component is the combination of attachment to and detachment from a substrate of a moving cell [ 30 ] . ( 2 ) With the similar approach and simulation method , we can study the interaction and movement of a cluster of cells , where the cell coordination and cooperation will be crucial [ 3 , 27 ] . Likely , such studies can help understand better the molecular basis as well as mechanical forces that determine such an important collective biological process . ( 3 ) With speeding up computations , e . g . , by implementation with the GPU , it is possibe now for us to simulate the cell movement in a full , three - dimensional setting . Acknowledgments .
