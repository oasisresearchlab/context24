The cortical premotor nucleus HVC ( acronym is name ) plays a necessary role in both learning stages , as well as the production of adult song . Consistent with neural network models where syn - aptic plasticity mediates developmental forms of learning , exposure to tutor song drives changes in the turnover , density , and morphology of HVC syn - apses during vocal development . A network’s out - put , however , is also influenced by the intrinsic properties ( e . g . , ion channels ) of the component neurons , which could change over development . Here , we use patch clamp recordings to show cell - type - specific changes in the intrinsic physiology of HVC projection neurons as a function of vocal development . Developmental changes in HVC neurons that project to the basal ganglia include an increased voltage sag response to hyperpolarizing currents and an increased rebound depolarization following hyperpolarization . Developmental changes in HVC neurons that project to vocal - motor cortex include a decreased resting membrane potential and an increased spike amplitude . HVC interneurons , however , show a relatively stable range of intrinsic features across vocal development . We used mathematical models to deduce possible changes in ionic currents that underlie the physiological changes and to show that the magnitude of the observed changes could alter HVC circuit function . The results demonstrate developmental plasticity in the intrinsic physiology of HVC projection neurons and suggest that intrinsic plasticity may have a role in the process of song learning . Key words : birdsong ; HVC ; intrinsic plasticity ; ion channels ; modeling ; zebra finch Significance Statement Models of learning commonly focus on changes in synaptic connectivity . Changes in the intrinsic properties of neurons ( ion channels ) , however , may also produce changes in the function of neural circuits . The present experiments show that the intrinsic physiology of neurons in the cortical premotor nucleus HVC change over the course of song learning in the zebra finch . Consequently , models of song learning should account for these intrinsic changes along with changes in synaptic connectivity . More broadly , models of learning and memory should consider intrinsic plasticity of neurons as a possible contributor to how the nervous system encodes new information or novel behaviors . New Research September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 1 – 16 Introduction Motor behaviors , such as speech , require the produc - tion of precise sequences of muscle activation ( Simonyan and Horwitz , 2011 ) . Consequently , the brain must encode accurate sequences of neuronal activity , which are deter - mined by two components : the intrinsic physiology of the neurons in the circuit , and the connectivity between those neurons . Traditionally , studies of the physiology of learned behaviors have focused on synaptic changes and tacitly assume a stable intrinsic physiology . Indeed , many network models of learning focus solely on altering syn - aptic weighting between neurons to account for the en - coding of novel behaviors ( Fiete et al . , 2010 ; Bernacchia , 2014 ; Sinha et al . , 2014 ; Zheng and Triesch , 2014 ; Ben - nett and Bair , 2015 ; Ocker et al . , 2015 ; Rajan et al . , 2015 ) . It remains possible , however , that the intrinsic properties of participating neurons ( passive membrane properties and composition of ion channels ) also change during learning . Indeed , changes in ion channels have been ob - served in a variety of systems and there is a growing appreciation of the possibility of nonsynaptic forms of plasticity contributing to the learning process ( Debanne et al . , 2003 ; Mozzachiodi and Byrne , 2010 ; Sehgal et al . , 2013 ; Cansler et al . , 2017 ) . The present experiments ex - plore changes in the intrinsic physiology of neurons in the zebra finch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) as juvenile birds prog - ress through stages of vocal development . Juvenile zebra finches learn their songs through a pro - cess of sensory - dependent imitation of an adult tutor ( Brainard and Doupe , 2002 ) . Vocal development occurs over distinct auditory and sensorimotor stages ( Fig . 1 ; Tchernichovski et al . , 2001 ) . The auditory stage begins when a juvenile bird is exposed to the song of an adult tutor , resulting in the encoding of an auditory memory of the tutor song . The sensorimotor stage begins with the vocal production of subsong , which shows many acoustic similarities to the unpatterned babbling of human infants ( Lipkind et al . , 2013 ) . Later , birds advance to plastic song where unpatterned vocalizations gradually differentiate into a facsimile of the syllable repertoire and sequence of the tutor song . Birds require auditory feedback through - out the sensorimotor stage to progressively shape vocal output toward the auditory memory of the tutor ( Price , 1979 ) . The present experiments focus on the cortical premotor nucleus HVC ( Fig . 1 ) , which is required for auditory learn - ing ( Roberts et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) , for sensorimotor learning ( Aronov et al . , 2008 ) , and for the production of the adult vocal pattern ( Long and Fee , 2008 ) . HVC’s key roles in the learning and production of song make it an exceptional target for exploring possible changes in intrinsic physiol - ogy of neurons related to behavioral development . HVC contains three major populations of neurons : ( 1 ) HVC RA neurons that project to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( RA ) , the avian homolog of human laryngeal motor cortex ; ( 2 ) HVC X neurons that project to Area X ( basal ganglia homolog ) , an area essential for song learn - ing ; and ( 3 ) interneurons ( HVC INT ) that synapse within the nucleus . Each cell type has a distinct physiology ( Dutar et al . , 1998 ; Kubota and Taniguchi , 1998 ; Daou et al . , 2013 ) . Our lab has previously developed conductance - based models of the three adult neuron types and phar - macologically tested the ion channel composition of the cells ( Daou et al . , 2013 ) , setting the groundwork for ex - ploring possible developmental changes in physiology during song learning . Is it only the connections between HVC cells that are modified as the song is learned , or do the neurons them - selves change ? To answer this question , we obtained patch clamp recordings from HVC neurons during vocal development . This experimental study was supplemented by the development of conductance - based mathematical models of the neurons , to postulate how gradated changes in conductances may underlie the observed changes in neuronal physiology . We conclude that cell - type - specific developmental changes in the intrinsic properties of HVC projection neurons do in fact occur and that the magni - tude of these changes is sufficient to alter the output of a neural circuit . Together , these findings suggest that plas - ticity of intrinsic physiology may play a role in the song learning process . Materials and Methods Experimental subjects Male zebra finches ( n (cid:2) 22 ) were used in all experi - ments and were either hatched in aviaries or in individual breeding chambers at Florida State University . Animal care and experimental procedures were performed in ac - cordance with National Science Foundation guidelines and approved by the Florida State University Animal Care and Use Committee . Juvenile finches were raised with one of two male - female pairs of adult finches in acousti - cally isolated , climate controlled recording chambers . The male tutor of the second pair was the offspring of the first pair and was tutored to that male’s song pattern . Thus , all juveniles used in experiments were tutored to the same song . Juveniles were either the offspring of the above pairs or transferred from the breeding aviaries at 7 d post - hatch ( dph ) . Vocalizations were recorded across de - velopmental stages to identify each juvenile’s stage of vocal development at the time of electrophysiological recording .

Figure 1 shows the behavioral timeline and example vocalizations for finches used in these experiments along with a sche - matic detailing the circuitry of the song system . Subsong Subsong is the initial stage of song production during which vocalizations are largely unpatterned . Subsong typ - ically begins at 30 – 35 dph . By 40 dph , all birds will be producing subsong . Importantly , housing with an adult male up to 40 dph is sufficient to establish an auditory memory of tutor song ( Elliott et al . , 2014 ) . Birds in the subsong group ( n (cid:2) 5 ) were 39 – 42 dph . Plastic song The onset of plastic song is typically between 45 – 50 dph , when juveniles begin to produce syllables that re - semble tutor syllables ( Fig . 1 ) . The transition from sub - song to plastic song is marked by an increase in syllable complexity measured by increased variance in the pitch , pitch goodness , and entropy of syllables ( Tchernichovski et al . , 2001 ) . Plastic song was objectively defined as a (cid:3) 70 % increase in syllable spectral variance ( a composite measure of pitch , pitch goodness , and entropy ) when compared to subsong ( Elliott et al . , 2014 ) . Birds in the plastic song group ( n (cid:2) 7 ) were 54 – 58 dph . Adult song Adult song is defined as a stable vocal pattern where there is minimal variability in syllable repertoire and se - quence across bouts of singing . Finches typically sing a stable song pattern by 90 dph . Birds in the adult song group ( n (cid:2) 10 ) were (cid:3) 120 dph . HVC and cell identification using retrograde tracers Viewed from a dorsal perspective , HVC is easily iden - tifiable in adult finches based on its distinctive ovoid shape and heavy myelination ( Daou et al . , 2013 ) . In juve - niles , however , HVC is more difficult to distinguish due to reduced myelination ( Herrmann and Bischof , 1986 ) . To definitively identify HVC in juvenile birds and provide con - firmation of specific cell types , a retrograde tracer was bilaterally injected into Area X , where it was taken up by HVC X projection neurons and transported back to the cell bodies in HVC . Birds were deeply anesthetized with Eq - uithesin and placed into a stereotaxic instrument . The scalp was resected , exposing the skull . Using the bifur - cation of the midsagittal sinus to set the stereotaxic zero point and as a reference for head angle , craniotomies were made over Area X at 3 . 5 mm anterior to the stereo - taxic zero and 1 . 5 mm lateral to the midsagittal sinus ( Basista et al . , 2014 ) . The tracer DiI ( Life Technologies ; (cid:4) 400 nl volume ) was bilaterally pressure injected 4 mm ventral from the surface of the brain into Area X via a glass micropipette using a gas pressure injection system ( Ap - Figure 1 .

Dye was allowed to transport for at least 7 d before electrophysiological experiments . During patch clamp experiments HVC X neu - rons were identified using epifluorescence illumination . Slice preparation Subjects were anesthetized with isoflurane and rapidly decapitated . A section of the skull was blocked and then transferred to a dissecting chamber containing artificial cerebral spinal fluid ( ACSF ) . The ACSF contained 119 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 . 2 mM NaHCO 3 , and 22 mM glucose . The osmolality of the ACSF was between 290 – 295 mOsm and the pH was (cid:4) 7 . 2 . Throughout the procedure , all ACSF was gassed with 95 % O 2 - 5 % CO 2 . After blocking , the brain was dissected out of the skull and the hippocampus was resected to aid in the sectioning of HVC . The hemi - spheres were separated and transferred to a vibrating microtome where parahorizontal sections of (cid:4) 250 – 300 (cid:2) m were taken . The sections were transferred to an incu - bation chamber for approximately 1 h before the start of electrophysiological recording . Whole - cell electrophysiology After tissue incubation , slices were transferred to a recording chamber containing perpetually oxygenated , room temperature ACSF . Recording electrodes were pulled to a resistance of 5 – 9 M (cid:5) using a Sutter Instru - ments P - 80 micropipette puller and filled with intracellular solution using hand pulled injectors . Electrodes were un - polished . The intracellular solution contained the follow - ing : 125 mM K - gluconate , 15 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM Mg - ATP , and 0 . 3 mM Na 3 - GTP , pH was adjusted to (cid:4) 7 . 2 using KOH and the osmolality was adjusted to (cid:4) 295 – 300 mOsm using su - crose . The AMPA / kainate receptor antagonist CNQX and the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin were bath ap - plied to limit synaptic input to the neurons . Neurons were visualized under a 40 (cid:6) water immersion objective using a camera system attached to an Olympus BX51 micro - scope . Epifluorescence illumination was used to identify HVC and identify HVC X neurons . Electrodes were guided to cells using IR - DIC illumination . Positive pressure was applied to the electrode before being visually guided to a neuron . After observing a dimple in the cell membrane and an increase in pipette resistance , positive pressure was removed and a small amount of negative pressure was mouth applied through the electrode holder . Once a gigaohm seal was attained , short pulses of negative pres - sure were mouth applied until the seal was ruptured . Provided that the neuron showed a stable resting poten - tial below approximately (cid:7) 50 mV , a stable access resis - tance and exhibited action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection , it would undergo a battery of current injection protocols detailed below . The liquid junction potential was measured to be approximately (cid:7) 2 . 8 mV and was left uncorrected . Electrophysiological protocols and feature analysis Recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B am - plifier connected to a computer running pClamp 9 or 10 ( Molecular Devices ) . For most neurons , whole - cell current clamp was used to first determine the passive membrane properties of the neurons by repeatedly injecting a 100 ms pulse of (cid:7) 10 pA of current over 10 sweeps . This small hyperpolarizing current minimizes the activation of voltage - dependent ion channels ( Franzen et al . , 2015 ; Hong et al . , 2016 ) . The sweeps were then averaged . The membrane input resistance ( R M ) was calculated by divid - ing the magnitude of the voltage deflection during the current injection by the value of the applied current ( (cid:7) 10 pA ) . The membrane time constant ( (cid:3) M ) was calculated using a single exponential fit to the first 50 ms after current onset . The membrane capacitance ( C M ) was then calcu - lated by dividing the membrane time constant by the membrane input resistance ( C M (cid:2) (cid:3) M / R M ) . Square current pulses of 300 ms duration were then applied and the voltage responses were analyzed and compared across neurons for a variety of features . All analyses were done using custom MATLAB analysis scripts using the calcu - lations detailed below . Figure 2 illustrates many of the measured features . Neurons were stimulated for a duration of 300 ms . The applied current typically ranged from at least (cid:7) 200 to 200 pA . The resting membrane potential ( V rest ) was calculated by averaging the voltage of the trace before the onset of the current injection . Average spike amplitude was de - fined as the mean of the first spike amplitude for all depolarizing current injections , calculated as the maxi - mum voltage minus the minimum voltage of the after - hyperpolarization of the spike . Average spike - width was defined as the mean of the spike - width calculated at half amplitude for the first spike of all depolarizing current injections . Spike latency was calculated as the time re - quired to elicit a spike after the onset of a 200 pA current injection . Spike frequency was calculated by multiplying the number of spikes elicited by a 200 pA current injection over the current pulse by 1000 / duration of pulse to obtain spikes / sec . This gives the mean spike frequency of the neuron over the duration of the current pulse . Inter - spike interval was calculated as the time in milliseconds be - tween spikes at half - amplitude . Spike frequency adapta - tion was calculated by computing the adaptation ratio ( AR ) between the final inter - spike interval and the first inter - spike interval for pulses of 200 pA . An AR of 1 indicates there is no adaptation whereas a larger AR indicates increased a slowdown of spiking . The sag ratio ( SR ) was calculated as ( V min – V end ) / V min such that V min is the minimum voltage during the hyperpolarizing pulse of (cid:7) 200 pA , and V end is the final voltage at the offset of the current injection . The voltage drop ( V drop ) during hyperpo - larization was measured as V rest – V min for a hyperpolar - izing current of (cid:7) 200 pA . Experimental design and statistical analysis A total of n (cid:2) 5 birds were recorded at subsong , n (cid:2) 7 birds at plastic song and n (cid:2) 10 birds at adult song . The number of cells recorded at each age group are detailed in Results . To compare across age groups the values for each measured feature were averaged together and com - pared using a one - way ANOVA with three levels of com - New Research 4 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org parison ( each age group ) followed by post hoc test ; p values ( Table 1 ) were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction . This method , common to many statistical packages , multiplies the uncorrected p value by the number of comparisons ( in our case three ) and is functionally equivalent to applying the correction to the alpha value . If the resulting , corrected , p (cid:3) 1 , it is rounded down to 1 . Group means were considered to be statistically different if the post hoc test reached p (cid:8) 0 . 05 . Statistics were computed with MATLAB using the ANOVA and multcompare functions . All data points are shown for the features that showed major developmental changes or were indicative of a cellular phenotype . Mathematical modeling Single - compartment conductance - based neuron mod - els were used to predict changes in ion channel properties that may underlie the changes in features of the voltage response to applied currents that occur across develop - ment . Modeling is necessary to describe our experimental results as the models can predict gradated changes in ion channel conductance . Our approach was to fit model pa - rameters to a representative neuron from each subpopula - tion ( i . e . , juvenile or adult ) , and then compare the values to determine which conductances changed substantially . This approach is preferable to fitting models to population aver - ages , since an “average neuron” may , in fact , not behave like any of the neurons in the population ( Golowasch et al . , 2002 ) . An alternative averaging approach , fitting parameters to all cells within a subpopulation and then averaging those values , would be similarly problematic . Our models build on the work of Daou et al . ( 2013 ) , where models were developed and tested using pharma - cology to confirm the presence and the role of several ion channels in shaping the intrinsic physiology of adult HVC neurons . Using the Daou et al . ( 2013 ) models as a foun - dation , we used fits to our developmental data to predict gradated variations in channel properties across develop - ment . This approach , of course , assumes that the con - ductances we previously determined to be present in adult neurons include all of the critical conductances present in juvenile neurons . That is , no juvenile - only con - ductance is responsible for age - dependent differences in physiology . This alternative seems unlikely since good fits to physiologic data were obtained using models based solely on a common set of conductances . The compo - nents of this model are briefly described below , and the source code for the original model ( Daou et al . , 2013 ) and Figure 2 . Electrophysiolgical trace analysis . A , Example from an adult HVC X neuron . B , Example from an adult HVC RA neuron . All traces were analyzed using an automated script that measured a variety of features for each voltage trace . See Materials and Methods for a full list of the features analyzed , along with a detailed explanation of measurment procedures . Many of the depolarizing features ( e . g . , spike ampltide , adaptation rate ) were analyzed at a current injection of 200 pA ( blue traces ) . Many hyperpolarizing features ( e . g . , SR , rebound depolarization ) were analyzed at (cid:7) 200 pA ( black traces ) . New Research 5 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org the models developed in this report are available at http : / / www . math . fsu . edu / (cid:4) bertram / software / birdsong . The code is available as Extended Data 1 . The models consist of voltage - gated Na (cid:9) and K (cid:9) cur - rents ( I Na and I K ) , a hyperpolarization - activated cation current ( I h ) , a high - threshold L - type Ca 2 (cid:9) current ( I Ca - L ) , a low threshold T - type Ca 2 (cid:9) current , a small conductance Ca 2 (cid:9) - activated K (cid:9) current ( I SK ) , a persistent Na (cid:9) current ( I Nap ) , an M - type K (cid:9) current ( I M ) , an A - type K (cid:9) current ( I A ) , and a leak current ( I L ) . Different values for capacitance and other parameters are used for the different neuron types and different stages of development . The currents were modeled as in Daou et al . ( 2013 ) with two excep - tions . First , the M - current replaced the Na (cid:9) dependent K (cid:9) current ( I KNa ) from Daou et al . ( 2013 ) , as the pharmaco - logical evidence for I KNa was equivocal given the nonse - lectivity of blockers . Additionally , modeling the M - current requires fewer assumptions than I KNA since it can be treated as a strictly voltage - dependent current , rather than a current that is dependent on hypothetical changes in intracellular ion concentrations . Second , the present models updated the kinetics of the h - current used by Daou et al . ( 2013 ) so as to match experimental data from zebra finch neurons in the dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus ( Luo and Perkel , 2002 ) . Both of these changes improved the fit of our models to the experimental data . The membrane potential is determined by the following equation : CdVdt (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:2) I L (cid:6) I K (cid:6) I Na (cid:6) I Nap (cid:6) I CaL (cid:6) I CaT (cid:6) I A (cid:6) I SK (cid:6) I M (cid:6) I h (cid:5) I App (cid:3) where C is the cell membrane capacitance , and I App is the applied current .

Results The patch clamp recordings from adult subjects repli - cated previous work showing three distinct physiologic phenotypes of HVC neurons ( Dutar et al . , 1998 ; Kubota and Taniguchi , 1998 ; Daou et al . , 2013 ) . HVC X neurons show spike - frequency adaptation , moderate inward rec - tification and rebound spiking . HVC RA cells often fire only a few spikes , have a resting potential near (cid:7) 80 mV , and show no sag response to hyperpolarizing currents . HVC INT neurons fire spontaneously , have high firing fre - quency compared to the other cell types and a large sag response to hyperpolarizing currents . HVC X neurons were identified by the presence of the fluorescent tracer DiI . HVC RA and HVC INT neurons were identified by the lack of tracer and by the similarity of their responses to the established adult physiologic phenotype for that cell type , and their identification is referred to as “putative” . Re - cently , HVC to Nucleus Avalanche neurons have been identified as a distinct population ( Roberts et al . , 2017 ) . Proportionally , these represent a small percentage of HVC projection neurons ( (cid:11) 1 % ) and possible developmental changes in their physiology were not explored in these experiments . Patch clamp recordings showed that the intrinsic phys - iology of identified HVC X neurons and putative HVC RA neurons changed as a function of song development . Some physiologic features remained stable in one cell type but changed in another , indicating that there are cell - type - specific changes . The traces were analyzed for a variety of features and tested for statistically significant differences across age groups ( see Materials and Meth - ods ) . While only selected properties of interest are dis - cussed in detail below , the population data and statistics for all analyzed features are shown in Table 1 . Recordings from putative HVC INT neurons showed that , as a popula - tion , their intrinsic properties were relatively stable across development . Mathematical models were used to interpret the ob - served changes in physiologic features of projection neu - rons and identify possible changes in the ion channel expression patterns that underlie the developmental changes in intrinsic physiology . To validate the models , the same feature analysis performed on the experimental traces ( Fig . 2 ) was applied to modeled outputs that were generated using applied currents with the same amplitude and duration as those used during the experimental re - cordings . Modeled outputs showed feature values within the range of experimentally recorded values for each physiologic feature . New Research 7 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org Developmental changes in HVCX neurons Examples of the physiologic responses of HVC X neu - rons are shown in Figure 3 , along with model simulations with parameters adjusted to fit the experimental traces . A total of n (cid:2) 33 HVC X neurons were recorded across development : n (cid:2) 11 at subsong , n (cid:2) 11 at plastic song , and n (cid:2) 11 at adult song . Figure 4 shows all data points for some of the key features that were analyzed . Several developmental changes in the properties of HVC X neu - rons reached statistical significance . There was a shift in the passive membrane input resistance and the mem - brane capacitance . In response to a hyperpolarizing ap - plied current , there was an increased V drop and SR , and an increased rebound depolarization following removal of the current . In response to a depolarizing current there was an increase in the spike frequency and spike amplitude and a decreased spike width ( Table 1 ; Fig . 4 , green headings ) . The specific details of physiologic changes are described below . Passive membrane properties Some passive membrane properties of HVC X neurons varied during development .

New Research 8 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org developmental timepoints had a similar resting potential and membrane time constant , membrane input resistance and capacitance showed a nonmonotonic developmental progression . The membrane input resistance was an av - erage of 282 (cid:10) 52 . 65 M (cid:5) at subsong , decreasing to 115 (cid:10) 22 . 72 M (cid:5) at plastic song , and then increasing to 296 (cid:10) 39 . 11 M (cid:5) at adult song . The average membrane capac - itance was 156 (cid:10) 38 . 95 pF at subsong , increasing to 308 (cid:10) 38 . 54 pF at plastic song and returning to 167 (cid:10) 28 . 68 pF by adult song ( Fig . 4 ; Table 1 ) . Response to hyperpolarizing applied current Figure 3 shows sample responses of neurons at each developmental stage . For quantitative comparisons , re - sponses to (cid:7) 200 pA current injections were analyzed when measuring the hyperpolarizing response of the cell . Adult HVC X neurons showed a V drop of 46 (cid:10) 5 . 37 mV and exhibited a sag response to hyperpolarizing currents ( 0 . 04 (cid:10) 0 . 0065 mV ) that is often followed by a rebound spike or prominent after - depolarization on termination of the hy - perpolarization . HVC X neurons from subsong and plastic song showed a smaller V drop of 30 (cid:10) 2 . 72 mV for subsong neurons and 26 (cid:10) 2 . 31 mV for plastic song neurons . Subsong HVC X neurons showed little or no sag response , with an average SR of 0 . 01 (cid:10) 0 . 0013 . The sag response was more variable among plastic song HVC X neurons , with SR ranging from 0 . 00 to 0 . 04 , with an average of 0 . 02 (cid:10) 0 . 0046 . Some plastic song HVC X neurons showed no sag , similar to subsong HVC X neurons , while some had a SR comparable to that seen in adults . Many adult HVC X neurons exhibited rebound spiking . Those that did not had an after - depolarization averag - ing 7 . 0 (cid:10) 0 . 78 mV . In contrast , subsong HVC X neurons never exhibited rebound spiking , having a limited after - depolarization of 1 . 7 (cid:10) 0 . 39 mV . Rebound firing was also not observed in plastic song HVC X neurons , but they did show a moderate mean after - depolarization of 3 . 3 (cid:10) 0 . 52 mV . Response to depolarizing applied current HVC X neurons at all developmental timepoints gener - ated tonic spiking to depolarizing current injections . They showed an increased firing frequency at adult song ( 32 (cid:10) 1 . 72 Hz ) when compared to subsong ( 24 (cid:10) 3 . 93 Hz ) and plastic song ( 19 (cid:10) 2 . 31 Hz ) . All HVC X neurons exhibited spike frequency adaptation during the 300 ms depolar - izations . Although neurons at adult song showed a higher frequency of action potentials to the standard (cid:9) 200 pA current injection , cells at all three behavioral timepoints showed similar adaptation rates . Analyses of individual action potentials showed that , as a population , subsong HVC X neurons had wider action potentials of shorter am - plitude than neurons recorded at plastic or adult song ; however , there was considerable overlap in the data across all developmental timepoints . Figure 4 shows quantification of six of the features of the voltage traces at each developmental stage . Each data point reflects a feature from one neuron in response to a current pulse of (cid:12) 200 pA , with the exception of the first panel , which shows the membrane capacitance . The large outlined circles indicate the neurons shown in Figure 3 , while the small open circles are the mean of the sub - population . Features that changed significantly over de - velopment are indicated with a green heading , while those that did not are indicated with a red heading . We interpret the changes next , employing biophysical models to sug - gest how ion channel parameters change over develop - ment . Mathematical models suggest developmental changes in channel parameters of HVC X neurons Each of the three model calibrations was made to a single neuron ( Figs . 3 A , 4 , outlined circles ) . The feature quantification from the model traces are shown as out - lined squares in Figure 4 . Model parameters for the two different juvenile time - points were compared against parameter values for adult neurons ( Fig . 7 A , positive values indicate that the juvenile parameter value is greater than that for the adult ) . Only select parameter values that differed across age groups are listed in Figure 7 ; however , all parameter values can be found in Table 2 . HVC X neurons showed three main developmental changes in their response to hyperpolarizing currents . The first significant feature change shown in Figure 4 is an increased V drop in the adult HVC X neurons compared with the juvenile . The model attributes this to a developmental decrease in the fast component of the h - current , relative to the slow component . This is reflected in the w h param - eter ( fraction of the h - current conductance that has fast activation ) , which is larger in the model cells of the juve - niles than in the adults ( Fig . 7 A ; Table 2 ) . Thus , in the juveniles , hyperpolarization quickly activates a substantial h - current that opposes the hyperpolarizing current , limit - ing the V drop . In the adult , there is less of this current , so the V drop is greater . The second significant feature change is a developmental increase in the SR . According to the model fitting , this is due to an increase in the slow com - ponent of the h - current , relative to the fast component , again reflected in the larger value of the w h parameter in the juveniles than in the adults . This slowly - activated component slowly depolarizes the membrane , resulting in a sag . The third significant feature change is an increase in the rebound depolarization , reflecting an increase in the number of neurons that spike following removal of hyper - polarizing current . The model fitting suggests that this is due to an increase in the conductance of the T - type Ca 2 (cid:9) current ( g Ca (cid:5) T is larger in the adult model cell than in the juveniles ) , as well as an increase in the slow component of the h - current . We showed previously that these currents are responsible for the rebound in HVC X neurons ( Daou et al . , 2013 ) . One feature change in response to depolarizing cur - rents was an increase in the spike frequency from plastic to adult cells . The model fittings suggest that this is due to a developmental decrease in the conductance and an increase in the time constant for activation of the M - type K (cid:9) channels ( g M , (cid:3) z ; Fig . 7 A ) . In juveniles , this channel activates more rapidly , turning on more of the hyperpo - larizing current during the depolarizing pulse . The result is a lower spike frequency in juvenile neurons . The effect of the SK current in these cells is small , as was shown in New Research 9 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org adult neurons in Daou et al . ( 2013 ) . There were develop - mental variations in spike amplitude and spike width due to changes in the conductance of Na (cid:9) and delayed rec - tifying K (cid:9) currents ( Table 2 ) .

The HVC RA cells shown are termed “putative” although we are confident in our classification based on the comparative similarity to previously identi - fied adult physiology , the lack of fluorescent labeling , and dissimilarity to the characteristic physiology of interneu - rons and identified HVC X neurons . Figure 6 shows all data points for some of the key features that were measured in HVC RA neurons . Developmental changes in properties of HVC RA neurons that reached statistical significance in - cluded a decrease in resting potential and an increase in spike amplitude ( Fig . 6 , green headings ) . No large or consistent changes were observed in the HVC RA mem - brane time constant , membrane input resistance , mem - brane capacitance , V drop , SR , rebound depolarization , spike frequency , adaptation rate , or spike width . Passive cellular properties The passive membrane properties of HVC RA neurons are largely stable except for a decrease in the membrane resting potential over development ( Table 1 ) . The resting membrane potential at subsong averaged (cid:7) 61 (cid:10) 2 . 05 mV , decreasing to an average of (cid:7) 66 (cid:10) 0 . 94 mV at plastic song , before reaching (cid:7) 77 (cid:10) 0 . 57 mV in adults . The resting potential observed in adult HVC RA neurons is com - parable with values previously reported ( Dutar et al . , 1998 ; Mooney and Prather , 2005 ; Daou et al . , 2013 ) . The mem - brane time constant , input resistance , and membrane capacitance were largely stable across development . However , subsong HVC RA neurons trended toward a higher membrane time constant averaging 28 (cid:10) 4 . 09 ms , decreasing at plastic song , averaging 17 (cid:10) 2 . 48 ms , before reaching an average of 18 (cid:10) 2 . 53 ms at adult song . The difference in the membrane time constant across developmental timepoints , however , was not statistically significant . Response to hyperpolarizing applied currents The measurement of V drop during hyperpolarization was stable across development , averaging 30 (cid:10) 6 . 55 mV at subsong , 29 (cid:10) 6 . 01 at plastic song and 28 (cid:10) 3 . 8 mV at adult song . Unlike HVC X neurons , HVC RA neurons show no sag in response to hyperpolarizing currents across development and they show only minor rebound depolar - ization . Response to depolarizing applied currents Adult HVC RA neurons fired at lower frequencies than HVC X and HVC INT neurons , and often fired a single or just a few action potentials . There was an increase in the spike amplitude across development beginning at an average amplitude of 50 (cid:10) 6 . 39 mV during subsong , increasing to 64 (cid:10) 3 . 29 mV at plastic song , reaching 77 (cid:10) 3 . 59 mV at adult song . There was no significant change in spike width across development . The HVC RA neurons shown in Figure 5 all fired at the onset of the current injection ; however , a subset of HVC RA neurons exhibited a spike delay . These neurons typically fired at higher frequencies than their onset - spiking counterparts . Both phenotypes have previ - ously been reported in adults ( Daou et al . , 2013 ) , and were observed at all behavioral timepoints studied . Mathematical models suggest developmental changes in channel parameters of HVC RA neurons Fitting the model to data from Figure 5 A suggests that the developmental change in resting membrane potential of the HVC RA neurons is largely due to the leak current . The adult HVC RA models showed a less nega - tive reversal potential and an increase in the conduc - tance of the leak current relative to earlier experimental timepoints ( Table 2 ) . While HVC RA neurons show no sag in response to hyperpolarizing currents , there is variation in V drop across Figure 6 . Developmental changes in HVC RA neurons .

Outlined circles represent features measured from the experimentaly recorded traces presented in Figure 5 . Outlined squares indicate the measurments from the modeled traces presented in Figure 5 . The means and SEMs are plotted over each data set . Legends for developmental changes that were statistically significant are indicated in green font while features that were developmentally stable are indicated in red . New Research 11 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org cells . The subsong trace shown in Figure 5 has a greater V drop when compared to the other two examples . As a population , however , there was no age - related change in V drop ( Table 1 ) . Nevertheless , the model results suggest that variation in V drop among HVC RA neurons could be explained by differences in the fast component of the h - current . As such , the h - current may be playing a signif - icant role in shaping HVC RA physiology despite the lack of a sag response , which reflects the slow component of the h - current . As in HVC X neurons , spike amplitude was largely set by g Na and g K . The experimental results show that adult HVC RA neurons have a larger spike amplitude than juve - niles . Counterintuitively , Figure 7 shows g Na to be smaller in adult neurons than in the juvenile neurons . This can be explained by the concurrent increase in g K in adults , which regulates the spike after - hyperpolarization . The SK cur - rent plays a large role in limiting the number of spikes produced during the depolarization pulse in HVC RA neu - rons . This is consistent with Daou et al . ( 2013 ) , their Figure 12 , which showed a single spiking HVC RA neuron exhib - iting tonic firing following the application of an SK channel blocker , apamin . Additionally , the SK current along with the M - current sets the voltage plateau , the steady state voltage following the spike ( s ) . The model suggests that there is a developmental increase in the SK conductance ( Table 2 ; Fig . 7 ) ; however , at all timepoints g SK is large enough to terminate the spiking during a 200 pA current pulse . Figure 7 shows that the juvenile models have a larger g M when compared to the adults . The models sug - gest that the larger conductance coincides with differ - ences in the kinetics of the M - current , such that the activation curve of juveniles is shifted rightwards , activat - ing at higher voltages , compared to the adults ( Fig . 7 , negative value of the (cid:8) z comparison ) . This type of devel - opmental change in kinetics is consistent with other model systems ( Protas et al . , 2003 ) . Interneurons show more stability over development The intrinsic physiology of HVC INT neurons was more stable over development than in HVC X or HVC RA neurons . A total of n (cid:2) 25 HVC INT neurons were recorded across development : n (cid:2) 6 at subsong , n (cid:2) 10 at plastic song , and n (cid:2) 9 at adult song . The classification of HVC interneu - rons was based on the similarity in their physiology to that of adults , their lack of labeling , and dissimilarity to HVC RA and HVC X neurons . No dramatic developmental changes were identified in any of the features measured in the putative interneurons . This indicates that the physiologic changes identified in HVC X and HVC RA neurons are not global changes across HVC , but cell - type - specific changes . Passive membrane properties The spontaneous spiking of HVC INT neurons made it difficult to reliably measure passive membrane properties , so these were not analyzed . Instead we focused on the active properties of these neurons . Note that HVC INT neu - rons display spontaneous firing although all experiments were conducted in the presence of synaptic blockers . This phenotype was observed throughout development . Response to hyperpolarizing applied currents HVC INT neurons showed a comparable V drop during hyperpolarization with values largely overlapping at each developmental time point . They exhibited large inward rectifying responses to hyperpolarizing currents that were observed throughout development . Interneurons aver - aged a SR of 0 . 13 (cid:10) 0 . 0267 at subsong , 0 . 11 (cid:10) 0 . 0190 at plastic song , and 0 . 13 (cid:10) 0 . 0204 at adult song . At all developmental timepoints , this ratio was much larger than that observed in HVC X neurons , resulting in a well - defined “sag” in the voltage ( Fig . 8 ) . Similar to adult HVC X neu - rons , HVC INT neurons fired a rebound spike or burst of spikes following hyperpolarization . However , unlike HVC X neurons , HVC INT neurons exhibited this phenotype across development ( Fig . 8 ) . Depolarizing response HVC INT neurons fired at the highest frequencies of the three cell types , with very little spike frequency adapta - Figure 7 . Developmental variation in ion channel parameters relative to adult . Model parameters that differed from the adult cell model are listed along the x - axis . Parameters that did not change are not displayed but can be found in Table 2 . All parameter values were manually fit to representative data from Figures 3 , 5 . In this plot , conductance ( g ) values were first normalized to the capacitance of the model neuron . All values are displayed as a ratio comparing the juvenile model parame - ters to the adult ( on a logarithmic scale ) . A value of zero indicates no difference relative to the adult . A value (cid:3) 0 indicates an increase in the magnitude of the parameter , and a value (cid:8) 0 indicates a decrease in the magnitude of the parameter relative to the adult . The models predict that HVC X and HVC RA neurons undergo different changes in ionic conductances as a function of development . New Research 12 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org tion . HVC interneurons had similar spike amplitudes across development , averaging 67 (cid:10) 6 . 00 mV during subsong , 64 (cid:10) 3 . 02 mV at plastic song , and 58 (cid:10) 2 . 17 mV at adult song , with large overlap in the three developmen - tal timepoints . Spike width was similarly stable , averaging 0 . 94 (cid:10) 0 . 16 ms during subsong , 1 . 44 (cid:10) 0 . 18 ms during plastic song , and 1 . 10 (cid:10) 0 . 13 ms during adult song . Discussion We characterized the intrinsic physiology of HVC neu - rons as a function of vocal development and identified population - specific changes in the intrinsic physiology of HVC projection neurons . Additionally , we modeled the intrinsic physiology of HVC neurons at each developmen - tal time point , implicating specific changes in the pattern of ion channel expression as a function of vocal develop - ment . Given the established role of Area X in song learning ( Sohrabji et al . , 1990 ) , the developmental change in the response of HVC X neurons to hyperpolarizing currents was particularly striking . Indeed , juvenile HVC X neurons lacked many of the phenotypic features held by adult HVC X neurons . At subsong they showed no sag response and no rebound spiking or large after - depolarization . By plastic song , HVC X neurons showed an increased varia - tion in the magnitude of their sag response such that some neurons show little to no sag response and some showed adult - like levels . Still , we did not observe rebound spiking in plastic HVC X neurons , but did see a moderate after - depolarization . Adult HVC X neurons showed an in - crease in sag and V drop compared to juveniles and often exhibited rebound firing or a comparatively large after - depolarization . HVC RA neurons also changed over devel - opment but in different ways than HVC X neurons . There was a downward shift in the HVC RA cell’s resting mem - brane potential over development and an increased spike amplitude . In general , the intrinsic physiology of HVC interneurons appeared much more stable across devel - opment , maintaining many of the phenotypic properties observed in adults . Overall , we determined that the intrin - sic physiology of HVC projection neurons , but not in - terneurons , changes across vocal development . Relationship to prior findings To our knowledge this is the first systematic exploration of the intrinsic physiology of HVC neurons over vocal development . Our results complement the work of others characterizing the physiology of HVC under other condi - tions ( Dutar et al . , 1998 ; Schmidt and Perkel , 1998 ; Mooney and Prather , 2005 ; Long et al . , 2010 ; Roberts et al . , 2010 ; Peng et al . , 2012 ; Stauffer et al . , 2012 ) . This project also helps to clarify some of the data presented in Kubota and Taniguchi ( 1998 ) , one of the earliest attempts to detail the intrinsic physiology of HVC neurons . Their study recorded from juveniles from 37 to 54 dph ; how - ever , the specific ages at which each recording was taken were not reported . While Kubota and Taniguchi ( 1998 ) ’s characterization of HVC neurons influenced our modeling work , we noticed discrepancies between their recordings and those that we reported in Daou et al . ( 2013 ) , which were taken in adults . The results presented here ( Figs . 3 – 7 ) suggest that the discrepancies were due to develop - mental differences in intrinsic physiology . A notable ex - ample is the rebound firing in HVC X neurons observed in Daou et al . ( 2013 ) , but not reported by Kubota and Tani - guchi ( 1998 ) . Their recordings however , show similarities to what we report here in juveniles . Additionally , the sub - song HVC RA neurons reported here show similarities to what Kubota and Taniguchi ( 1998 ) classified as “type 4” cells , which exhibited a resting potential near (cid:7) 70 mv and a “slower” hyperpolarizing response . They hypothesized Figure 8 . HVC INT neurons are comparatively stable across development . Voltage traces of HVC INT neurons recorded at subsong , plastic song , or adult stages of development . As a population , HVC INT neurons show variability in many of the measured features ; however , the distributions of these measured features were relatively stable across developmental timepoints ( Table 1 ) . Cells from all three age groups show high firing frequencies , a large sag and rebound firing . The cells shown here provide examples of the variability observed in HCV INT neurons , however , there was no consistent classifiable difference across groups for any of the features analyzed . New Research 13 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org that these were “immature” HVC RA cells . The present data suggest their hypothesis was accurate . Given these dif - ferences it is important to recognize that the intrinsic physiology of juvenile and adult neurons is not always equivalent . Identifying sources of developmental stability and plasticity Among the three classes of HVC neurons , HVC X and HVC RA neurons show the most dramatic disparity in the stability of their intrinsic physiology across development . HVC X neurons show a pronounced developmental shift in the response to inhibitory currents while HVC interneu - rons , the source of those inhibitory currents , remain largely stable throughout development . It has been shown that inhibition in HVC plays an important role in both song production ( Kosche et al . , 2015 ) and song learning ( Val - lentin et al . , 2016 ) . Vallentin et al . ( 2016 ) showed evidence that inhibitory activity during tutor song playback in - creased for previously learned syllables , suggesting that inhibition is playing a stabilizing role during learning . These results suggest that as the juvenile is learning to sing , synaptic changes lead to an increase in coordinated inhibitory activity . It is possible that the change in inhibi - tory response of HVC X neurons , in conjunction with this increased inhibitory coordination is regulating song learn - ing and stability . One caveat is that our classification criteria for interneurons is based solely on their physio - logic profile , as retrograde labeling of interneurons is not possible . As such , a putative juvenile interneuron was classified as an interneuron given its similarity to the known physiology of the adult . This would naturally bias the results toward the conclusion that there is little change over development . Nevertheless , it is noteworthy that one can readily find adult - like interneurons in the juvenile HVC , which cannot be said for the projection neurons . If the intrinsic physiology of HVC interneurons is in fact estab - lished before onset of subsong , as our data suggest , then developmental changes in intrinsic interneuron physiol - ogy are not a component of , nor a requirement for , song learning . This leaves either change in the physiology of HVC projection neurons and / or changes in connectivity between all classes of HVC neurons as being the key components related to song learning . From a theoretical perspective , it is commonly assumed that changes in synaptic connectivity carry the bulk of any learning - induced change in neural function and , in fact , there is evidence that such changes occur in HVC ( Roberts et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Day et al . , 2013 ) . There is also evidence that there are developmental changes in synap - tic connectivity in RA ( Wang and Hessler , 2006 ; Shank and Margoliash , 2009 ) . It seems equally common to as - sume that the intrinsic properties of the component neu - rons are stable during learning and do not contribute to the ultimate changes in the input - output function of the neural circuit . The age - related changes in physiology ob - served in the present study challenge this latter assump - tion . It is possible that changes in the physiology of the component neurons , not just the synaptic strengths of their connections , contributes to song learning . Alterna - tively , or in parallel , the developmental changes in intrinsic physiology could interact with mechanisms of synaptic plasticity . For example , perhaps the developmental changes in physiology provide a means to regulate when the com - ponent neurons are most sensitive to conditions that can produce synaptic plasticity . Research by Sim et al . ( 2013 ) Figure 9 . Developmental changes in channel properties can affect output of a simple circuit . The schematic depicts a simple circuit model in which the HVC INT neurons are stimulated , inhibiting HVC X neurons that in turn excite HVC RA neurons . The subsong and adult song model circuits vary only in their intrinsic physiology , maintaining the same synaptic weighting between neurons . The subsong circuit reflects the physiology of the neurons recorded during subsong , and the adult song circuit reflects the physiology of the neurons recorded during adult song . The circuit is not necessarily indicative of all microcircuitry within HVC , but rather , to show that the developmental changes in HVC intrinsic physiology observed in the present experiments are of sufficient magnitude to have a significant influence on the output of even a very simple , but plausible , HVC local circuit . New Research 14 of 16 September / October 2017 , 4 ( 5 ) e0297 - 17 . 2017 eNeuro . org has shown that artificially increasing the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons in the Dentate Gyrus leads to synaptic changes . Additionally , they showed that changes in input connectivity are regulated by the activity - dependent tran - scription factor Npas4 . It remains to be seen if the same molecular factors regulate synaptic plasticity in HVC ; how - ever , it does illustrate that changes in intrinsic physiology can alter the connectivity of a circuit . Given this , it is possible that the more depolarized resting potential of juvenile HVC RA neurons makes them more prone to synaptic plasticity , and the later developmental changes in channels that lead to a more hyperpolarized resting potential make them resistant to further change . Such a mechanism could provide an underlying mechanism for closing the developmental sensi - tive period for song learning . At present , we cannot determine if the changes in physiology are driven by song learning , or if they set the developmental window for learning , but we can test the hypothesis that the magnitude of the changes in intrinsic physiology observed in the present experiments are ade - quate to change the output of a neural circuit . To illustrate the dramatic effect that alterations in intrinsic physiology can have on the output of a circuit , we used the model neurons developed in this study to create a simple circuit model ( Fig . 9 ) , one based on an HVC network model presented in Bertram et al . ( 2014 ) . The circuit consists of an interneuron synaptically connected to an HVC X neuron which is in turn connected to an HVC RA neuron . This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the known syn - aptic connectivity within HVC ( Mooney and Prather , 2005 ) , although more complex patterns of connectivity are certainly possible ( Bertram et al . , 2014 ; Kosche et al . , 2015 ; Kornfeld et al . , 2017 ) . We present two circuits , one with the intrinsic physiology of subsong neurons and one with the intrinsic physiology of the adult neurons . Both circuits maintain the exact same pattern of connectivity and synaptic weighting . Despite these circuits having the same connectivity , the output varies greatly based solely on differences in the intrinsic physiology of the constituent neurons . In the subsong circuit the inhibitory input to the HVC X neuron does not elicit rebound firing and , as such , cannot activate the subsong HVC RA neuron to drive sing - ing . Meanwhile , in the adult circuit the inhibitory input to the HVC X neuron from the interneuron triggers rebound firing which in turn activates the HVC RA neuron . Lack of an output response in the subsong circuit is consistent with the findings of Aronov et al . ( 2008 ) , where it was shown that HVC RA neurons make little to no premotor contribu - tion to subsong , which is driven instead by lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( LMAN ) RA neurons . While our results and simulations do not show that learning is a result of nonsynaptic plasticity in the bio - physical properties of neurons , they do suggest that such plasticity can drive significant changes in the input - output function of a neural circuit . The possibility that component neurons of a circuit might change should be more widely considered in analyses of learning and memory ( Debanne et al . , 2003 ; Mozzachiodi and Byrne , 2010 ; Sehgal et al . , 2013 ) . To understand how the brain encodes a behavioral pattern it is important to know the intrinsic physiology of the constituent neurons along with their pattern of con - nectivity . The process of learning may involve modifica - tion of either ( or both ) of these properties .
